  "Milotic": {
    "overview": "<p>Very little has changed for Milotic defensively since ADV, but that's not always a good thing. Diamond/Pearl has brought with it new monstrously powerful sweepers such as Nasty Plot Infernape, Dragon Dance Outrage Dragonite and other threats that Milotic simply doesn't have the power to stand up against. Worse yet, Hypnosis's accuracy is now a measly 60%, and with Wish becoming more and more useful, Milotic finds itself commonly overshadowed by Vaporeon.</p> <p>That being said, Milotic finds itself landing very comfortably in its new niche in Generation 4's UnderUsed tier, where it provides an extremely viable choice as a bulky Water-type and status absorber. Its movepool may not be very large, but it's focused perfectly for its job in UU, where it can stand up against strong threats such as Blaziken, Feraligatr, and Azumarill with ease. With its solid 95/79/125 defenses, access to Recover, and ability to hit back with 100 base Special Attack, Milotic is a great choice for any kind of team in UU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Most of Milotic's effective movepool is covered in the above sets, but there are a couple of novelty options. Dragon Pulse provides perfect neutral coverage in tandem with Surf, but its lack of super effective coverage makes it a poor choice in most situations. Light Screen can be used to support the team and improve Milotic's ability to take special hits. Meanwhile, Mirror Coat can allow you to surprise opponents who try to hit you with neutral Special attacks that won't KO. Hypnosis used to be a staple on Milotic, but between its now 60% accuracy and Milotic's need for another move in its last slot, Milotic has issues putting it into a set. Flame Orb is marginally viable as an item for Milotic, as it provides a 50% increase in Defense and an immunity to status, but the loss of effectively 18% HP per turn (Leftovers recovery + burn damage) makes it a significantly worse item choice.</p> <p>It is possible to run Milotic with an entirely Special Defensive set packing 252 Special Defense EVs and a Calm nature to fully utilize its 125 Special Defense, but weaknesses to common special attacking types such as Grass and Electric make it a less appealing option. 8 Speed EVs may seem random, but with those EVs, Milotic reaches 200 Speed, enough to outpace Adamant Max Speed Aggron.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Grass-types such as Venusaur and Ludicolo can make Milotic's life hard, as they can hit Milotic hard on its Grass weakness with their STABs while taking low damage from Milotic's offensive options. However, beyond Grass-types, the choice of a Milotic counter is largely dependent on which variant of Milotic you're fighting. Variants without Rest are crippled by Toxic, which continually chips away at Milotic's HP, preventing it from staying in against threats for extended periods of time. Variants without Haze or Hidden Power Grass are pure setup fodder for SubDD or SubSD Feraligatr, who can set up an unbreakable substitute in Milotic's face. SubPunch Azumarill can also provide to be the bane of Milotic without a neutral attack, as they can proceed to Substitute for free before assaulting Milotic with powerful Focus Punches. Toxicroak's Dry Skin ability also allows it to easily switch into Milotic and set up on it, as a neutral Ice Beam is the best that Milotic can muster in return.</p> <p>Milotic's offensive sets can be beaten with a little prediction. The safest way to switch into offensive Milotic is by using a Water-type such as one's own Milotic or a Slowbro. Altaria also makes a good choice for switching into Milotic, as long as it stays away from Ice Beams. However, the bar none best way to switch into offensive Milotic is using Chansey, who can proceed to either stall it out with Soft-Boiled/Wish or cripple it with Toxic or Thunder Wave.</p>",

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Milotic's excellent 95/79/125 defenses combined with its superb Water typing cement it as an exceptional defensive Water-type. Milotic is capable of sponging hits from many top attackers in UU and either Recovering off the damage or hitting back from 100 base Special Attack. Hidden Power Grass is used to hit threats such as Feraligatr, Azumarill, and other Water-types who Milotic can wall effectively. Recover gives Milotic great utility as a self-healing bulky Water and makes it very difficult to take down.</p> <p>The last move is an issue of choice. Ice Beam can hit Altaria, Venusaur, and Torterra. However, be wary of faster Venusaur and Torterra variants, as they can easily outspeed Milotic and OHKO with their STAB Grass-type attacks. Haze is incredibly useful to remove stat boosts from opponents such as Feraligatr, Calm Mind Slowbro/Spiritomb, and others. Finally, Toxic is useful for hitting walls such as Slowbro, Tangrowth, and opposing Milotic, who are more than happy to switch into Milotic.</p> <p>In UU, Milotic can't help but be compared to the other bulky Water-types in the metagame. The two top contenders for the Bulky Water title are Slowbro and Azumarill, and each provides a significant advantage over the other. Milotic's main advantages are Haze, which allows it to take on bulky stat-increasing threats, something that Slowbro cannot do. In addition, Slowbro's secondary Psychic typing gives it weaknesses to Ghost and Dark that Milotic does not have to deal with. Milotic also has 45 more base Special Defense than Slowbro, meaning that while Slowbro makes a much better physical wall, Milotic can act as an incredibly efficient mixed tank.</p> <p>Despite Water's excellent defensive typing, it still has its issues. Powerful Electric and Grass-type attacks can still put a large dent in Milotic. As such, it is always a wise idea to have a go-to Pokemon for this purpose. Venusaur is an excellent Pokemon with which to support Milotic, as it resists Grass and Electric, can absorb Toxic aimed at crippling Milotic's walling abilities, and can also threaten opposing bulky waters with its powerful STAB Energy Ball or Leaf Storm. Registeel also resists Grass and is neutral to Electric, as well as possessing an immunity to Toxic. It also has much better Defense than Venusaur, allowing it to take physical attacks as well as special ones. Altaria has a 4x resistance to Grass and neutrality to Electric as well, and it has the potential to be more offensive than either of the aforementioned teammates.</p>"
      },
      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<p>Even though Milotic has access to Recover, there are certain advantages to a Sleep Talk set for a Pokemon such as Milotic. The most significant one is Marvel Scale. Milotic's unique ability increases its Defense by 50% whenever it is affected by a status, which means that while Resting, Milotic is extremely difficult to take down. The other is that Milotic often finds itself as the target of status such as Toxic, which it wants to get rid of as quickly as possible. Surf and Ice Beam comprise the standard Water-Ice offensive pairing, giving the best two-move coverage that Milotic can find. Hidden Power Grass also provides useful coverage, allowing Milotic to hit opposing Water-types such as Feraligatr and Slowbro, but renders you unable to hit Altaria or Grass-types.</p> <p>The EVs give maximum physical bulk, while still preventing Moltres from 3HKOing Milotic with Hidden Power Grass. This also makes Milotic an extremely effective mixed wall with the Defense boost from Marvel Scale, achieving 394 HP / 366 Defense / 330 Special Defense while sleeping.</p> <p>As with the previous set, this Milotic needs two things: a way to deal with Electric and Grass attacks, and a way to deal with bulky Water-types that will wall this set endlessly. Venusaur is once again the best teammate for Milotic, being able to deal with both of Milotic's main threats. Registeel, Altaria, and Tangrowth also provide the required resistances, but none of them perform as well against Milotic's counters as Venusaur.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>This set is focused to make great use of Milotic's special bulk, giving it the role of Toxic staller or Hazer. Surf gives Milotic a reliable STAB move and allows Milotic to do a significant amount of damage to those that don't resist it, thanks to Milotic's decent Special Attack stat. Toxic allows Milotic to inflict status on fellow bulky Water-types who might otherwise be troublesome for the team and forces offensive teams to keep switching out, thereby racking up passive damage. In the third slot, any of the three listed moves are effective depending on Milotic's teammates. For example, a team lacking a hazer/phazer and no reliable way to get rid of bulky set-up sweepers will certainly benefit from Haze on Milotic. Ice Beam can prove useful if your team has problems with Grass-types such as Venusaur and Sceptile; with the correct prediction Milotic can inflict great damage to the opponent's Grass-type Pokemon. Ice Beam can also be used to pick off weakened sweepers that are immune to or resist Surf, such as Toxicroak and Ludicolo. Hidden Power Grass can be used if you like to get rid of annoying entry hazard setup Pokemon such as the Rock/Water type brothers, Omastar and Kabutops, though it is worth noting that this move will be more effective on a more offensive Milotic spread.</p> <p>Milotic can definitely benefit from the use of Hidden Power Psychic to hit Toxicroak, who could prove dangerous if it sets up on Milotic's switch and you lack necessary counters. Although it seems quite unnecessary, Hypnosis may be used instead of Haze to give Milotic double status, automatically hindering 1/3 of the opponent's team. Mirror Coat can come in extremely handy at times, especially in late-game scenarios where the last Pokemon can threaten to sweep your team. Milotic can take almost any unboosted super effective special attack and use Mirror Coat for a guaranteed OHKO. Mirror Coat coupled with Toxic puts the opponent's Pokemon on a timer, forcing it to either switch or attack, so Haze is not necessarily needed.</p> <p>Milotic can be used as an effective Toxic staller or Phazer due to its sheer natural bulk. This set's primary focus is to allow Milotic to Toxic stall other bulky Pokemon such as Milotic, Blastoise, Slowbro, Slowking and even Lanturn. Combined with Haze Milotic can easily win stall wars against other tanks that don't have access to Toxic, as well as defeating many of the common UU sweepers such as Dragon Dance Feraligatr, Bulk Up Hitmontop and Dragon Dance Altaria. Milotic's great defenses on both sides allow it to take all sorts of hits, especially from notorious special sweepers.</p> <p>Milotic enjoys having bulky Grass-type Pokemon on its team, such as Venusaur and Tangrowth, who can absorb almost all the attacks that threaten Milotic. Weezing and Donphan are great allies as they can come in on hard hitting physical sweepers such as Rhyperior and Aggron and hit back with Will-O-Wisp and Earthquake respectively.</p> <p>Any bulky Pokemon that has recovery as well as status healing moves such as Rest/Aromatherapy/Heal Bell can easily take anything Milotic throws at them. Prime examples of these Pokemon are the fairy twins, Chansey and Clefable. Venusaur can deal with Milotic but should try to avoid switching into an Ice Beam. Tangrowth and Leafeon can also dominate provided Milotic lacks Ice Beam. Rest + Sleep Talk variants of Milotic and Blastoise can stall out this set.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Milotic's base 100 Special Attack and base 81 Speed make it a perfectly viable offensive Pokemon. With Choice Specs, Milotic makes an exceptionally bulky Choice user, backed by a STAB Hydro Pump, one of the strongest attacks with one of the best offensive typings in the game. Surf is more reliable, having perfect accuracy but significantly less power. Ice Beam is the staple coverage move for Water-type Pokemon, providing coverage against Grass-types and Altaria. Hidden Power Grass hits Water-types attempting to wall the first two moves and works especially well against Gastrodon and Quagsire. The final move is up to personal preference. Hypnosis can take one of Milotic's counters out of the game relatively early, but its shaky accuracy often makes it little more than a gamble. Surf may seem redundant, but given that Milotic is short on offensive options, having the option of attacking with either Hydro Pump or Surf on the same set can come in handy. Speed is maximized in order to outspeed all base 80 Pokemon, such as Blaziken and Altaria, as well as all neutral variants of base 90 Pokemon such as Moltres and Porygon-Z.</p> <p>Item choice is a matter of preference. Choice Specs provide the maximum amount of power to punch through teams. Choice Scarf gives a solid method of revenge killing many scarfed or speed boosted threats, such as +1 Dragon Dance Altaria or Scarfed Medicham. Finally, Life Orb trades bulk for versatility. If Life Orb is used, Recover is an option in the last slot, as Milotic can use the ability to recover the HP sheared off by Life Orb.</p> <p>Since this Milotic is more offensively minded, it is best complemented by offensive teammates. Venusaur once again comes to mind, as it synergizes well with Milotic defensively, inflicts Sleep on opponents, and deals damage with its strong Special attacks or with Swords Dance boosted Power Whips and Earthquakes. Altaria also does well, as it can use Grass- and select Electric-type attacks as setup fodder for a Dragon Dance sweep. Feraligatr and Azumarill are strong Water-type attackers, who can profit from a predicted Ice Beam or Hidden Power Grass taking out the opponent's Water resist, allowing them to inflict heavy damage on the opposing team. Azumarill is especially notable, as it can easily switch into Chansey and threaten it with either Choice Band Waterfall or a 101 HP Substitute and Focus Punch. Absol can also do the same with a powerful Pursuit, Night Slash, or Superpower.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>With sturdy defenses, excellent type coverage, instant recovery, and a solid 100 Base Special Attack, Milotic has all the tools to be a premier tank in UU. Hydro Pump is the main attack and absolutely tears through most of UU. Ice Beam is for coverage and will make Venusaur think twice about switching in freely.</p> <p>The final attack is a general coverage attack to battle with opposing Water-types. Hidden Power Grass gives you a solid way to deal with Stockpile Gastrodon and can at least dent Lanturn, but Hidden Power Electric has better neutrality as a whole, which can make it more difficult for opponents to switch in. Recover allows Milotic to switch in multiple times throughout the course of the battle and replenish any health lost from Life Orb recoil.</p> <p>The magic in this set is all in the EVs. The HP investment is enough to reach 369, which rounds Life Orb recoil down. The 56 Speed EVs allow Milotic to reach 212, which is enough to outpace slower variants of Mixed Blaziken, Jolly Marowak, and Adamant Torterra. Although the prospect of using a Timid nature and additional EVs may be tempting, Milotic will lose a significant amount of power and durability. Notable Pokemon between 210 and Milotic's maximum Speed usually have priority, like Absol's Sucker Punch, or have a method to increase their speed, such as Feraligatr, Altaria, and Swift Swimmers like Kabutops.</p> <p>With a Modest nature and 220 Special Attack EVs, Milotic reaches its highest possible bonus point total at 319, which makes it an effective wallbreaker. Hydro Pump has enough juice to score 2HKOs on most Uxie, Spiritomb, and Registeel, as well as a very slight chance to 2HKO Clefable. The rest of the EVs are put into defenses to make it an effective check against Fire-type Pokemon. Arcanine will never manage a 2HKO with Choice Banded Extreme Speed while Stealth Rock is in play, and defensive Moltres are unable to 3HKO with Air Slash despite the lack of Leftovers.</p> <p>Since this Milotic is more geared toward wallbreaking or tanking hits than simply walling, its allies should be able to take advantage of the damage that Milotic can deal to opposing teams. If Milotic can catch a crucial Water resist on the switch with either Hidden Power Grass or Ice Beam, it can clear the way for any other Water-type attacker, such as Choice Band Azumarill or Dragon Dance Feraligatr, who can easily deal plenty of damage to opposing teams once their Water resisters are removed. Venusaur can switch into Grass- and Electric-type attacks that can threaten Milotic, as well as bulky Water-types that can otherwise prevent Milotic from dealing damage. Altaria can switch into Grass- and select Electric-type attacks, and potentially use the damage dealt by Milotic to open up for a Dragon Dance sweep. If you're looking to maximize Milotic's offensive potential, Absol can Pursuit opposing Chansey, which can clear the way for Milotic to deal plenty of damage to the opposing team.</p>"

  "Venusaur": {
    "overview": "<p>When Venusaur was first dropped into the UU tier, nobody could've foreseen how dominant he was destined to become. He has just the right stat distribution and movepool to excel as a bulky sweeper; notable features include complementary STAB moves in Sludge Bomb and Leaf Storm, semi-reliable recovery in Synthesis, and the ability to instantly disable an opposing Pokemon with Sleep Powder. Not only this, but Venusaur also has a plethora of other options and the stats to make use of them; he can run defensive, physical, and mixed sets effectively as well. Despite these attributes, Venusaur's middling Speed and predictable coverage ensure that he is far from uncounterable. By no means, however, should this top-tier threat be overlooked.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Surprisingly, Venusaur's movepool is not particularly large, despite the numerous sets listed in this analysis. However, even though he doesn't have a whole slew of other options besides the ones already listed, he has a few extra tricks that can throw an opponent off guard. In terms of stat boosting moves, Venusaur is nowhere near short of them, possessing Growth, Amnesia, and Curse. Growth is the only move that can boost Venusaur's Special Attack stat, and can be a relatively decent option to boost Venusaur's already great Special Attack. However, a simple +1 boost is not nearly worth the time it takes to use Growth, and Venusaur is generally better off simply attacking immediately. Curse is a fairly good option, as with Venusaur's already great Special Defense stat, he can utilize Curse to become bulky on the physical side as well. In addition to this, Venusaur's access to Synthesis and a strong physical move in Power Whip makes it entirely plausible for Venusaur to boost up with Curse and sweep. Despite this, Venusaur simply has too many weaknesses that can be preyed upon, which makes it way too difficult to set up enough to sweep, and Venusaur is neither powerful nor bulky enough after just one Curse. Amnesia can be used to further bolster Venusaur's Special Defense, but pure defensive boosts are rarely worth it, and Venusaur has too many weaknesses that stop him from becoming impervious to attacks. Additionally, while somewhat gimmicky, Venusaur has access to Ingrain to prevent himself from being phazed while attempting to boost up, though forcing Venusaur to stay on the field will generally result in the loss of your Venusaur.</p> <p>Venusaur's alternative attacking movepool is pitifully small, consisting of essentially three moves that are even worth considering: Seed Bomb, Double-Edge, and Outrage. Seed Bomb is a reasonable option instead of Power Whip for a more reliable Grass STAB, but the difference in power is tremendous, and will definitely affect Venusaur's ability to damage opposing Pokemon. Double-Edge is an option if you want an attack that has more power than Return; however, the recoil, in tandem with the Life Orb that Venusaur is likely to carry, will result in him being worn down exceedingly fast. While Outrage may seem like a decent option thanks to its fantastic Base Power of 120, the lack of STAB and the fact that it locks Venusaur onto the field for at least another turn is disappointing. Venusaur's remaining support options are basically limited to Knock Off and Sunny Day. While both of these are decent supporting options in their own right, Venusaur simply has much better things to do than to remove opposing Pokemon's items or set up Sunny Day, the latter being better done better by Pokemon such as Registeel or Chlorophyll users like Tangrowth. Finally, Venusaur is capable of running a Choice Specs set quite handedly, but it is outclassed by the Choice Scarf set, and Venusaur's Speed matches with too many other Pokemon in UU to make it worthwhile.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The first step to countering Venusaur is figuring out which set he is running through smart scouting. Altaria and Weezing are safe switch-ins to just about any Venusaur, and both are capable of running RestTalk sets effectively, ensuring that switching into Sleep Powder will not severely disable them. Altaria must beware of the occasional Hidden Power Ice or Swords Dance-boosted Return, though, and Weezing can be worn down through repeatedly switching into Leaf Storm. Additionally, unlucky Sleep Talk rolls will prevent these Pokemon from successfully handling Venusaur, particularly Swords Dance variants. Arcanine, while not as ideal of a sleep absorber, makes a good initial switch-in to any Venusaur as well, although he cannot act as a dedicated check to both physical and special Venusaur at the same time.</p> <p>After determining the set that Venusaur is running, dealing with him becomes much easier. Registeel is a perfect counter to the Life Orb special set -- even with Sleep Powder, it is impossible for Venusaur to breach its high Special Defense without team support. It also walls physical sets that opt for Return over Earthquake. Chansey is another good counter to special sets, although she can be brought down if, through Sleep Powder, she is prevented from recovering. Drapion resists both Leaf Storm and Sludge Bomb, but he is prone to being worn down through repeated switch ins, even if he invests in Special Defense. He does, however, have Taunt to prevent the use of Synthesis, Sleep Powder, and Leech Seed. Thanks to Magic Guard, Clefable is immune to passive damage, and she can therefore wield a status orb to prevent sleep while countering any Venusaur set based on Leech Seed; furthermore, she has the bulk to take the attacks of the special sweeping set fairly well. Moltres and Scyther take a large amount of damage from Sludge Bomb and are torn up by Stealth Rock, but they are otherwise effective checks to most Venusaur sets and surefire counters to purely physical variants lacking Return. Bulky Grass-types, such as Tangrowth and Leafeon, are fantastic counters to physical variants as well, but they will take a huge hit from Sludge Bomb when against any other variant of Venusaur.</p> <p>If Venusaur does knock out a Pokemon, using a faster Pokemon to revenge kill him is entirely plausible. Because Venusaur has so many weaknesses, and is fairly slow, it isn't difficult to find a Pokemon that can outspeed and hit him super effectively. Houndoom, Alakazam, and Swellow are examples of such Pokemon; while they are rarely able to switch into any of Venusaur's moves due to their frailty, they're more than capable of threatening a KO on Venusaur once they're in play. Unfortunately, this is not a surefire way of removing Venusaur from the battle, as the opponent can always just switch Venusaur out of such precarious situations. As such, Dugtrio is an option to guarantee the removal of Venusaur. However, Dugtrio often lacks the power necessary to take on a healthy Venusaur, making it so that he can only trap and KO weakened variants.</p>",

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This is Venusaur's bread-and-butter set, and it utilizes his fantastic Special Attack and dual STAB to the fullest extent. Venusaur's respectable defensive stats and array of resistances enable him to switch into many prominent UU Pokemon, including Spiritomb, Milotic, and Sceptile, with the threat of unleashing a powerful, Life Orb-boosted Leaf Storm or Sludge Bomb. The main idea of the set is not to outright sweep, but instead use Venusaur as a tank, force switches, and continually bash the opponent to the point where one of your own sweepers and finish off the opponent's team. Only a handful of Pokemon resist Venusaur's STAB combination, the most common being Registeel, Drapion, and Weezing, and this is where Sleep Powder comes into play. Sleep Powder allows Venusaur to incapacitate a counter and net a free turn in the process; in some cases, it even lets Venusaur beat some of his would-be counters. For instance, Venusaur can hit a Chansey switch-in with a powerful Leaf Storm and follow up with Sleep Powder to prevent her from recovering with Soft-Boiled. Natural Cure will ensure that Sleep Clause does not activate once Chansey is switched out, so Venusaur can repeat this tactic every time he switches in until Chansey is KOed, barring a miss or one-turn sleep. Synthesis rounds off Venusaur's moveset, healing damage incurred through Life Orb recoil or from resisted attacks such as Milotic's Surf or Azumarill's Waterfall.</p> <p>This set utilizes a fairly standard EV spread. A Timid nature and maximum Speed are used to tie with the other base 80 Speed Pokemon that plague the UU tier, including Kabutops and Blaziken. Special Attack is maximized to augment Venusaur's damage output. Even with no investment in his defensive stats, Venusaur remains fairly bulky, both physically and specially, a trait that separates it from other Grass-type sweepers such as Sceptile and Leafeon. Unlike them, Venusaur can switch fairly comfortably into Ice Beam from bulky Water-types such as Blastoise and Milotic, for example.</p> <p>In terms of coverage, Venusaur's special movepool is all but barren outside of Leaf Storm and Sludge Bomb, although Hidden Power can be used to hit specific counters if needed. Hidden Power Ground helps against Registeel and Drapion, Hidden Power Rock will OHKO Moltres and Scyther, and Hidden Power Psychic is Venusaur's best option to hit Toxicroak and specially defensive Weezing. Alternate EV spreads, which sacrifice Speed for additional bulk and power, include 164 HP / 252 SpA / 92 Spe and Modest, which allows Venusaur to outspeed positive-nature base 50s, particularly Aggron, and defensive Rotom, and 108 HP / 252 SpA / 148 Spe with Modest, which lets Venusaur also outpace positive-nature Torterra, Omastar, and Exeggutor.</p> <p>Registeel and specially defensive Arcanine are the most common defensive counters to this set; the former is especially problematic, as Venusaur has no chance of defeating it even after putting it to sleep. The most reliable answers to these threats are bulky Ground-types, namely Rhyperior and Donphan. Both are capable of switching into the aforementioned problem Pokemon, forcing them out by the threat of a STAB, super effective Earthquake, and setting up Stealth Rock to limit the switch-ins of the numerous Venusaur counters weak to Stealth Rock. Provided that it doesn't switch in on an attack, Dugtrio is a more immediate way of dismantling the walls that stand in Venusaur's way, with Earthquake OHKOing most Arcanine and 2HKOing most Registeel. Additionally, all three of these Ground-types can handle Poison-types such as Drapion and Muk who, while less commonly used, are troublesome because they resist both of Venusaur's STAB moves.</p> <p>Offensive counters to Venusaur consist primarily of UU's flurry of Flying-types, including Scyther, Swellow, and Altaria. Stealth Rock helps a lot in wearing these Pokemon down, and an excellent choice for setting it up is Registeel, who, thanks to its typing, is a dependable answer to most of the physically-based Flying-types in the tier. Fire-types such as Houndoom and Moltres are just as problematic; the best answers to these Pokemon lie in bulky Water-types, particularly Milotic and Azumarill, who not only manhandle most Fire-types, but also attract Grass- and Electric-type attacks from Pokemon such as Sceptile and Rotom, Pokemon that Venusaur can comfortably switch into. Fire-types, incidentally, also make stellar partners to Venusaur, completing the classic UU Fire-Water-Grass core. For a sturdy partner, Arcanine is a good choice; specially defensive variants wall Houndoom and Moltres, offensive variants wreck Registeel, and physically defensive variants beat Scyther. However, frailer Fire-types such as Blaziken and Houndoom also have niches, the former better equipped to deal with Clefable and Chansey, the latter better suited to take down Weezing. All of these Fire-type Pokemon will also lure in Water-types that Venusaur can take advantage of.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Just when you thought your Chansey and Clefable were safe, along comes this set. With a respectable base 82 Attack stat, a powerful 120 Base Power STAB attack, and the means to gain a free turn via Sleep Powder, Venusaur makes a fairly effective Swords Dance user. While his significantly higher Special Attack stat ensures that this set will remain the lesser of the two offensive sets, Swords Dance has a greater degree of surprise factor behind it, and its existence alone attests to Venusaur's sheer unpredictability. The list of counters to this set is, for the most part, far different from that of the special set.</p> <p>The premise behind this set is simple: put a Pokemon to sleep, set up with Swords Dance, and attempt to sweep. Bluffing a special set for as long as possible is recommended, and opening with Sleep Powder is the best way to maintain this illusion; however, it is sometimes better to Swords Dance first and then Sleep Powder -- if an opponent switches in a Pokemon slower than Venusaur, this tactic will net you an extra turn in which to boost or attack freely, so long as the switch-in does not wake up immediately or use Sleep Talk on the sleep turn. However, if you're facing a purely offensive opponent, then just opening with Power Whip can be a great move. Because most heavy offense players rely solely on type synergy for defense, blasting their go-to special Venusaur counter with a physical attack can quickly garner you the advantage in battle.</p> <p>After a single Swords Dance boost, Venusaur can rip through most of UU with Power Whip. Earthquake hits Registeel as well as Fire-types, such as Arcanine, and grounded Poison-types, such as Drapion, for super effective damage; Return, on the other hand, achieves coverage on Grass-types, most notably Leafeon and Sceptile, as well as Weezing.</p> <p>This Venusaur utilizes a cookie-cutter EV sweeper spread to great success. Maximum Attack makes Venusaur's attacks as strong as possible, while max Speed is necessary due to the important Speed that Venusaur reaches. Because Venusaur is so prominent in the UU metagame, many Pokemon, such as Kabutops and opposing Venusaur, try to outspeed or tie with him, and it's important for Venusaur to at least attempt to beat them, especially since this set is a sweeper.</p> <p>Depending on which move Venusaur uses in the secondary attack slot, he will be walled by different opponents. Though Sleep Powder can help disable one of Venusaur's counters, it isn't a surefire way to beat them, and as such, teammates who can deal with these problematic Pokemon are necessary. If Earthquake is used, bulky pure Grass-types such as Leafeon and Tangrowth wall Venusaur, while Flying-types, such as Altaria, Scyther, and Swellow, can switch in with relative ease. A strong Fire-type such as Blaziken, Arcanine, or Houndoom are perfect choices to deal with the aforementioned Grass-types, and in addition to this, they're amazing at luring in Pokemon such as Milotic, who are easy for Venusaur to switch into and set up. Fire-types can also deal with Weezing, another Pokemon who walls Venusaur if he uses Earthquake, as they can switch into Will-O-Wisp without fear and can take advantage of Weezing's poor attacking prowess to set up. To deal with troublesome Flying-types, physically defensive Milotic is a good option, as it is able to take physical attacks with relative ease and strike back with a super effective Ice Beam. Registeel can also wall the aforementioned Flying-types for an extremely long time and cripple them with Thunder Wave. Additionally, if you keep Stealth Rock on the field, those Flying-types will have issues switching into both Stealth Rock and Venusaur's attacks continually.</p> <p>However, if Return is used, the ubiquitous Registeel becomes a solid counter, as it is bulky enough to take both Power Whip and Return without fear, and can cripple Venusaur with Thunder Wave. Once more, Fire-types become excellent teammates, being able to take on Registeel with their powerful STAB attacks. However, the offensive Fire-types listed previously detest Thunder Wave as much as Venusaur does. Therefore, they cannot be assured to be completely safe when switching into Registeel. In addition to this, they can't beat opposing Arcanine, who can also check Venusaur that use Return. In this case, bulky Ground-types such as Donphan and Rhyperior are arguably better alongside Venusaur, as they make both Arcanine and Registeel suddenly look less threatening. Additionally, Rhyperior turns Arcanine and Registeel into setup bait, which will make the opponent think twice about sending the two into Venusaur haphazardly, in fear of giving Rhyperior a free switch in to wreak havoc on their team.</p>"

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Despite his lower Defense stat, Venusaur can make a superb check against numerous physically offensive threats. Due to his Grass typing, Venusaur can strike physically offensive behemoths such as Rhyperior for massive damage, and he's both fast and bulky enough to take a hit before dispatching them with strong, special attacks, which usually hits these threats on their weaker defensive stat.</p> <p>Each move on this variant of Venusaur allows him to check as many dangerous threats as he can. Grass Knot hits big, heavy threats such as Rhyperior and Aggron for plenty of damage, and it can be used multiple times against bulkier Pokemon such as Milotic and Steelix. However, Leaf Storm is a reasonable option to KO or at least severely damage frailer sweepers in one blow. Sludge Bomb nails pure Grass-types such as Leafeon, Tangrowth, and Sceptile, all of whom are easy enough for Venusaur to check. It also hits opposing Swords Dance Venusaur for decent damage, and in tandem with Sleep Powder, makes this Venusaur more than capable of checking opposing physical Venusaur. If this Venusaur is being used on a stall team, Roar is a decent option over Sleep Powder to still allow him to check Swords Dance Venusaur while gaining the ability to rack up damage from entry hazards. Synthesis is generally better than Leech Seed due to the high-powered attacks Venusaur will tend to switch in on, which make reliable recovery almost necessary. Despite this, Leech Seed can still be a decent option to whittle away at the opposing team while also providing some sort of healing for Venusaur and his teammates.</p> <p>Though it may seem odd to invest so many EVs into Speed, they're actually quite necessary for this Venusaur. 92 Speed EVs allow Venusaur to reach a Speed stat of 219, which outpaces all unboosted variants of Aggron, enabling Venusaur to switch into a strong, physical attack before outspeeding and retaliating. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Venusaur's HP and Defense stats to make him as physically bulky as possible.</p> <p>Due to all the weaknesses that Venusaur possesses, he desperately needs Pokemon who can cover his shortcomings. Milotic and Registeel are fine choices; the former being capable of taking Fire- and Ice-type attacks for quite a while, and the latter resisting Psychic-, Flying-, and Ice-type attacks that might come from the likes of Alakazam, Swellow, and Cloyster, respectively. Since both of these Pokemon also tend to be specially defensive, they can cover Venusaur's uninvested side well. Rhyperior is another option to deal with Flying-types, and though he can't quite cover as many Pokemon as Registeel can, he has the advantage of being able to dish out respectable damage with his STAB attacks, which Registeel cannot boast. In particular, both Milotic and Rhyperior appreciate Venusaur's ability to take on the opposing Grass-types who threaten them, such as Leafeon, Tangrowth, and Sceptile.</p> <p>Entry hazards are useful to this Venusaur, as he can take advantage of them due to Roar, and the residual damage from the hazards helps Venusaur in checking numerous threats as they can allow Venusaur to obtain some OHKOs and 2HKOs. Omastar is great at setting up entry hazards thanks to his great bulk and decent synergy with Venusaur. Spiritomb is also worth considering due to his ability to trap and KO frail threats such as Alakazam, and he's a fantastic spinblocker if you use this Venusaur on a stall team with plenty of entry hazard support. He can also stop Ghost-types with Substitute from setting up on this set, which is greatly appreciated.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Due to Venusaur's plethora of resistances and fantastic Special Defense, he can be a formidable special tank that is capable of checking numerous prominent threats in the current metagame, such as Milotic, Mismagius, Sceptile, Rotom, and opposing Venusaur. With a strong physical attack in Power Whip, Venusaur has the capability to hit these threats on their generally weaker defensive stat, and thus do plenty of damage to them. Furthermore, Venusaur's access to sources of healing in Synthesis and Leech Seed is also appreciated, as they greatly increase his overall longevity and allow him to continue to check special threats throughout the battle.</p> <p>The choice between which move to use as healing, however, depends on what you want Venusaur to check. While Synthesis is the more reliable option, Leech Seed's healing is decent against most Pokemon and its ability to gradually weaken opposing Pokemon can be very helpful at times, especially against special threats that are bulkier and thus will not be dealt with easily by Power Whip or Sludge Bomb. Additionally, this Venusaur will be switching into weaker attacks in comparison to the Physically Defensive set, which gives him more time to spam Leech Seed. Leech Seed also gives Venusaur the ability to beat Registeel and Chansey one-on-one. However, you should know that Leech Seed will not work on opposing Grass-types; most importantly, it won't work on opposing Venusaur, which means that Venusaur will not be nearly as effective at checking them. Fortunately, Sludge Bomb helps alleviate this issue due to its ability to smack opposing Grass-types for plenty of damage, and even without investment, Venusaur's Special Attack is still formidable. Finally, Venusaur can choose between two other support options in Sleep Powder and Roar. Sleep Powder is generally the better option due to its ability to temporarily disable a Pokemon, which helps stop Venusaur from being utter setup bait. However, Roar has some use if you're using Venusaur on a stall team with plenty of entry hazard support, as Venusaur makes a fine shuffler thanks to his great overall bulk and resistances.</p> <p>As this Venusaur is primarily designed to take on special attacks, the EV spread is naturally focused almost completely on Venusaur's Special Defense stat. However, due to the Sassy nature that is used to keep both Power Whip and Sludge Bomb strong, Venusaur needs 16 Speed EVs to beat all variants of Rhyperior. While this set is not designed to take Rhyperior head-on like the Physically Defensive set, Venusaur still needs to outspeed Rhyperior so he can at least act as a check in desperate situations. The rest of the EVs are poured into HP and Special Defense to almost maximize Venusaur's special bulk.</p> <p>As Specially Defensive Venusaur tends to take on Pokemon such as Mismagius, Rotom, and Lanturn, Heal Bell support is appreciated to remove any status that he might pick up after checking these Pokemon. Clefable makes a great user of it due to her great overall bulk and immunity to residual damage thanks to Magic Guard. Additionally, Venusaur can deal with some Fighting-types who tend to target Clefable and check Ghost-types who tend to attempt to set up on her. Also, if this Venusaur is used on a more stall-based team, entry hazard users are greatly appreciated due to this Venusaur's ability to take advantage of them with Roar. Omastar and Cloyster are fantastic choices thanks to Venusaur's ability to take on the Grass-types who can otherwise quickly dismantle them with strong attacks.</p> <p>While Venusaur has numerous resistances, he also has a slew of weaknesses that leave him vulnerable to many threats in Fire-, Flying-, Ice-, and Psychic-type Pokemon. Therefore, Venusaur needs appropriate teammates who can deal with these threats. Milotic, Registeel, and Rhyperior are great teammates for this job, as they each resist at least two of Venusaur's weaknesses and are naturally bulky. Milotic can take Fire- and Ice-type attacks for an exceptional amount of time due to her marvelous bulk and access to Recover, and Registeel can take Flying- and Psychic-type blows from the likes of Swellow and Alakazam with ease as well. The defensive prowess of both Milotic and Registeel combined is amazing for Venusaur, as together they cover all of his weaknesses, creating a strong defensive core. While Rhyperior doesn't quite have the fantastic synergy Registeel has with Milotic and Venusaur, he still makes a great check to physical Flying-types, and he also has the advantage of being able to hit back with strong attacks, unlike Registeel, whose best form of offense is Seismic Toss. However, since this can make your team vulnerable to strong Psychic-types such as Alakazam, Spiritomb can be worthy of a team spot due to his ability to flawlessly trap and KO frail Psychic-types with Pursuit. Altaria can also be a respectable defensive teammate thanks to her important resistance to Fire, which can allow her to set up on the Fire-types that Venusaur tends to lure in.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>With fairly good and balanced offenses, strong STAB options, and Sleep Powder, Venusaur can used a mixed set to great success. This set takes advantage of how each offensive Venusaur set lures out different counters, and abuses this fact to dispatch those would-be counters with ease. For example, special Venusaur tends to lure in Chansey. By using Sludge Bomb to bluff this Venusaur as the Special Sweeper, you can then proceed to lure in Chansey and 2HKO her with Power Whip. Alternatively, you can bluff the physical set with Power Whip to lure in pure Grass-type Pokemon before KOing them with Sludge Bomb. While this set is weaker than both the physical and special sweeper sets, it's still fairly strong and capable of sweeping through the opponent's team.</p> <p>Sludge Bomb is Venusaur's most reliable STAB option on this set, and it can help bluff a special set. In addition to this, it has just enough power to KO Moltres as long as Stealth Rock is on the field, preventing it from switching in on Power Whip too easily. Power Whip is Venusaur's second STAB option, and it's strong enough to obtain 2HKOs against the likes of Milotic, Slowbro, and Chansey. It also tends to be Venusaur's primary sweeping move. Sleep Powder is standard on any Venusaur set, as it guarantees that Venusaur will be able to disable at least one Pokemon during the match. In the last slot, Synthesis increases Venusaur's overall longevity by healing off the damage from entry hazards, Life Orb recoil, and any weak attacks that Venusaur could have switched in on. However, Earthquake hits adversaries such as Registeel, Drapion, and Toxicroak who resist Venusaur's STAB combination. Because these foes are such huge threats, it may be worth giving up Synthesis's healing if your team needs these threats removed for your other attackers to sweep.</p> <p>The EV spread is finely tuned for this set's purpose. Max Speed allows Venusaur to outspeed Swords Dance Feraligatr, as well as tie with opposing Base 80 Speed Pokemon with maximum EV investment. 120 Special Attack EVs allow Venusaur to KO Moltres if Stealth Rock is in play, while the Attack EVs garner a 2HKO on Chansey, Milotic, and Slowbro as long as Stealth Rock is up. A Hasty nature is used to keep both Power Whip and Sludge Bomb strong, and it is preferred over a Naive nature due to the Surfs and occasional Ice Beams that Venusaur tends to switch in on.</p> <p>Entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, are extremely important to this set, as even a single layer of Spikes will allow Venusaur to gain some important 2HKOs or OHKOs. Omastar is a fantastic Pokemon to set up entry hazards with, being bulky enough to set up multiple hazards during the match, and can lure in Grass-types for Venusaur to switch into. Omastar can also take on Arcanine to some degree, who otherwise outspeeds and threatens to KO Venusaur. Registeel is also a respectable user of Stealth Rock due to his great bulk and ability to deal with Flying-types such as Scyther and Swellow.</p> <p>Teammates that enjoy the removal of walls that hinder their sweep are amazing partners to this Venusaur, the prime examples being Houndoom and Swellow. Venusaur's ability to lure in and KO walls such as Chansey is greatly appreciated, as removing even just one troublesome wall drastically increases his teammates' chances of successfully sweeping. Houndoom is able to switch into Fire-types that may try to switch into Venusaur for the revenge kill, and proceed to set up a Nasty Plot, which makes him especially effective. Houndoom also tends to lure in Milotic and other bulky Water-types, which are easy switch in opportunities for Venusaur. Finally, Feraligatr and Azumarill are fantastic teammates since they lure out Tangrowth and Leafeon, both of whom Venusaur can dispose of with Sludge Bomb.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Venusaur's great Special Attack stat makes him a prime candidate for sweeping opposing teams, but he is unfortunately hindered by his relatively mediocre Speed. However, this can be remedied by simply slapping a Choice Scarf on Venusaur, making him extremely fast and fairly strong. Choice Scarf Venusaur is designed to act as a hit-and-run Pokemon early in the game, throwing out powerful Leaf Storms and incapacitating Sleep Powders. Choice Scarf Venusaur can even be used in the lead position due to his blistering Speed and access to a somewhat reliable sleep inducing move. Mid-game, he can act as a great revenge killer, being able to take down Rock Polish Torterra and Aggron, as well as most Water-type sweepers. Late in the game, when the opposition has been severely weakened, he can be a decent choice to clean up the opposing team with as well.</p> <p>Leaf Storm is a nasty attack when fired off of Venusaur's great Special Attack, and helps compound this set's playstyle of a hit-and-run attacker. Leaf Storm's short burst of extreme power makes it a great attack to simply throw out near the beginning of the game, and it's also useful for revenge killing bulkier sweepers. Similarly, Sleep Powder can also be simply thrown out early in the game to guarantee that one of the opponent's Pokemon will be disabled temporarily. Sludge Bomb has decent neutral coverage in UU, and is usually a decent option to use if you're unsure of the incoming Pokemon. Hidden Power Ice rounds off the set by hitting Flying-types such as Altaria, Scyther, and Swellow for super effective damage, as well as Torterra.</p> <p>While the EV spread is extremely standard for this type of set, it's necessary due to the important Speed that Venusaur hits. At max Speed after a Choice Scarf boost, Venusaur hits 426 Speed, which is just enough to outspeed +2 neutral-natured Torterra, and speed tie with max Speed Dragon Dance Altaria. These are important to beat or speed tie with due to Venusaur's capability to revenge kill them with ease. The rest of the EVs are thrown into Special Attack to maximize Venusaur's damage output, and make him as strong as possible to help him revenge kill bulkier sweepers.</p> <p>Aside from Sleep Powder, Venusaur has essentially nothing that can deal with problematic foes such as specially defensive Arcanine and Registeel. Thus, appropriate teammates to deal with such troublesome opponents are appreciated. Rhyperior and Donphan are examples of such teammates, possessing both the ability to easily eliminate the likes of Arcanine and Registeel and to withstand whatever attacks they might throw at them. Dugtrio is also an option to guarantee the removal of these Pokemon, but his frailty makes it extremely difficult to switch him in. Additionally, due to this set's hit-and-run nature, defensive teammates are appreciated to deal with Pokemon who can switch into Venusaur's relatively predictable array of attacks. Bulky Water-types such as Milotic make great partners for this job, as they're extremely resilient and have a fantastic typing to take on foes such as Aggron, Scyther, Swellow, Houndoom, and Alakazam, all of whom have the ability to set up on one of Venusaur's Choice-locked attacks and sweep. The aforementioned Donphan and Rhyperior are also great options to take care of these foes, though they obviously prefer taking on physically-based opponents.</p>"
      },
      "SubSeed": {
        "description": "<p>Most Grass-types are capable of running a SubSeed set with reasonable success. However, Venusaur's access to Sludge Bomb and Sleep Powder sets him apart from his brethren; the former allows Venusaur to hit opposing Grass-types who are immune to Leech Seed for great damage, and the latter makes it much easier to set up. Additionally, Venusaur's great bulk can make it difficult to break his Substitutes, and if the opponent does not have a suitable counter to him, they may find themselves struggling.</p> <p>While Energy Ball does not really set Venusaur apart from other Grass-types, it does allow him to beat Omastar, Kabutops, Donphan, and Milotic, who would otherwise beat this variant of Venusaur. However, you should know that by replacing either Sleep Powder or Sludge Bomb, you are losing the ability to set up as easily or hit opposing Grass-types respectively. Therefore, the choice of using Energy Ball or not depends on whether or not you have lures who can bait Pokemon for Venusaur to set up on, and teammates who can beat opposing Grass-types.</p> <p>The EVs of this set revolve around bolstering Venusaur's great defenses; while maximizing Speed may seem tempting, it's not really worth it, as Sceptile is simply a superior fast SubSeeder. Maximum HP increases both of Venusaur's defenses equally, and add to his overall sturdiness. The EVs in Defense cause Venusaur's Substitutes to never be broken by standard Registeel's Iron Head, while the Special Defense EVs prevent Life Orb Timid Milotic from 2HKOing Venusaur with Ice Beam. Body Slam is an option over Sleep Powder to spread paralysis, which is incredibly useful on this Venusaur due to his overall low Speed.</p> <p>Paralysis support is very useful for this Venusaur, as it allows Venusaur to outspeed opponents and set up a Substitute. From there, Venusaur has the advantage; unless Venusaur used Substitute against a Pokemon that is fairly strong, or can target his weaknesses, his Substitute would have most likely stayed intact. This allows Venusaur to use Leech Seed to regain his lost health, before setting up another Substitute to stall out the opponent. Because of this, Registeel, Chansey, and Clefable are all great partners to this Venusaur, since they all have decent type synergy alongside him, and are bulky enough to spread paralysis effectively. Interestingly, Venusaur has issues with Clefable herself due to her ability, Magic Guard, which prevents Venusaur from stalling her with Leech Seed. Because of this, Fighting-types such as Hitmontop and Hariyama can be used to deal with Clefable, while Ghost-types can set up on her. Speaking of Ghost-types, Ghost-types with Substitute can set up on this set with ridiculous ease, as they outspeed Venusaur and can set up a Substitute to protect themselves from Leech Seed and Sleep Powder. If Venusaur's only attacking move is Sludge Bomb, he will fail to break their Substitutes, which allows them to boost up to their heart's content. Thus, Spiritomb becomes a great partner, as he is perfectly capable of dealing with these Ghost-types thanks to Shadow Sneak and Pursuit.</p>"

  "Charizard": {
    "overview": "<p>Apart from its huge Stealth Rock weakness, you probably couldn't find anything noticeably wrong with Charizard. It has decent stats with a fantastic movepool; however, the reason that Charizard is banished to the depths of NU is the fact that its sets are either outclassed by a better Pokemon or just plain ineffective in the metagame it's trying to compete in. Nonetheless, Charizard is still very capable of being quite deadly in the right hands.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Charizard has a very big movepool and many options that it can use. On the special side, Charizard has access to Focus Blast, Overheat, and Dragon Pulse, while on the physical side, it has Rock Slide, Focus Punch, and Return. A Choice Specs set is usable, but the 4x weakness to Stealth Rock really limits its ability switch in and out, not to mention that Moltres is a better candidate overall. Charizard can also use a Blaze + Sunny Day + Petaya Berry set that makes it absurdly powerful but, like the Belly Drum set, it is extremely hard to stop and difficult to set up. Charizard can also attempt a mixed wallbreaking set with Air Slash, Brick Break, Fire Blast, and Roost, but Charizard generally lacks the power to do so.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Charizard has two huge enemies; one is Stealth Rock, and the other is bulky Water-types. Milotic is the best general counter for Charizard, while Slowking can handle special variants and Slowbro can handle physical variants. Specially defensive Regirock is also an excellent check to Charizard, being able to take most of its attacks while OHKOing back with Stone Edge or Rock Slide. Chansey and Clefable wall any special variant of Charizard as well. In most cases, keep a priority user handy (especially Aqua Jet Azumarill), keep Stealth Rock on the field, don't give it a chance to set up, and you'll fare just fine.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Charizard is most effective as a special attacker; although it seems outclassed by Moltres, which hits a lot harder, Charizard still has some useful perks over the fire bird. Firstly, Charizard's base 100 Speed allows it to outrun, and prevent itself from being revenge killed, by Pokemon that would outspeed Moltres, such as Rotom and Arcanine. Secondly, Charizard's ability, Blaze, gives its Fire-type attacks a significant boost when its health falls below 33%. Charizard's Fire-type STAB attack has excellent coverage alongside its secondary STAB move, Air Slash, while Hidden Power Grass hits Pokemon that resist both Fire- and Flying-type moves. Roost allows Charizard to recover health from Life Orb recoil and Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>The choice between Fire Blast and Flamethrower boils down to whether you prefer power or accuracy; Fire Blast is preferred since Charizard's Special Attack is comparatively poor to Moltres, and because it needs all the power it can get. Life Orb gives Charizard a boost in its power without locking it into a move.</p> <p>Charizard's special movepool extends further than just the moves suggested; Dragon Pulse has perfect coverage alongside Fire Blast and allows Charizard to hit Altaria super effectively without using Hidden Power. Focus Blast is Charizard's most powerful move against Regirock and Clefable, if you can stand to rely on its terrible accuracy.</p> <p>When deciding which EVs to invest in with Charizard, take advantage of Charizard's decent Special Attack and Speed. As for its nature, Timid is almost always preferred, as using a Modest nature means that Charizard is completely outclassed by Timid Moltres, which sports higher Special Attack, superior Speed, and better bulk. Modest Charizard should only be used if you run Charizard alongside Moltres in a \"double-Fire\" combination, using Moltres to break apart walls for Charizard to clean up later. It should be noted that Charizard and Moltres both have a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock as well as sharing common weaknesses.</p> <p>Aside from the omnipresent Stealth Rock, Charizard is hindered by bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Slowking. Specially defensive Pokemon, such as Regirock, Altaria, and Chansey are fantastic checks to Charizard too. Good teammates for Charizard obviously need to provide Rapid Spin support to clear away Stealth Rock while also taking advantage of the aforementioned problematic Pokemon. Hitmontop and Blastoise are arguably the best Rapid Spinners to run alongside Charizard, since they both are relatively bulky and have good defensive synergy with Charizard. Hitmontop resists Rock-type attacks and Foresight allows him to hit Ghosts with Rapid Spin to clear away Stealth Rock. Hitmontop can also scare away Chansey with its powerful STAB Close Combat, but Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan are both viable alternatives if more attacking power is desired. Blastoise can do the same but it instead sports a resistance to Water-type attacks. Although it shares a weakness to Water-type attacks with Charizard, Donphan is a decent Rapid Spinner that can defeat common spinblockers with moves like Assurance, Head Smash, and Earthquake. Venusaur is a fantastic switch-in to bulky Water-types, such as Milotic and Slowking, causing havoc with its powerful STAB moves or Sleep Powder. Dugtrio is also a good partner to run alongside Charizard as it can trap and KO Chansey with Beat Up or Earthquake.</p>"
      },
      "Sunny Day": {
        "description": "<p>With this set, Charizard aims to defeat its bulky Water-type counters. Again, Moltres largely outclasses Charizard in such a role, but Charizard's higher Speed and rare ability in Blaze help it compete for a team spot. After using Sunny Day, Charizard's Fire-type STAB attacks are powered up to ridiculous levels. In the sun, Solar Beam does not require its charging turn, allowing Charizard to 2HKO Milotic and Slowking, its two biggest counters. The last slot depends on how offensively you want Charizard to operate. Roost allows Charizard to recover from Stealth Rock and Life Orb recoil, while Air Slash gives Charizard maximum coverage. Finally, Charizard's item choice depends on the type of team it is in. If Charizard is part of a Sunny Day team, Heat Rock should be considered so Charizard can support the team as well as itself. Life Orb is preferred in most other cases due to the higher damage output it provides.</p> <p>Like all Charizard sets, Rapid Spin support is essential, especially if it's not running Roost. Hitmontop and Blastoise are both bulky spinners that synergize well with Charizard and have reliable ways of dealing with spinblockers. Donphan is viable as well, as it can usually deal with spinblockers with its powerful attacks. Chansey makes a fairly decent counter to Sunny Day Charizard, although it risks getting 2HKOed by sun-boosted Fire Blasts if Blaze is activated. If Charizard is not running Air Slash, Flash Fire Pokemon, such as Houndoom and Arcanine, absolutely wall Charizard. Dugtrio with Substitute can trap and remove Houndoom with some prediction, while Rhyperior is a decent switch-in to most Arcanine.</p> <p>Since SunnyBeam Charizard is good at luring and defeating bulky Water-types, Pokemon that can take advantage of their absence make fantastic teammates. Rock Polish Rhyperior, Dragon Dance Feraligatr, and Nasty Plot Houndoom are a few Pokemon that can sweep when opposing bulky Water-types (especially Milotic) are removed.</p>"
      },
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>With usable Attack and Speed and a workable physical movepool, Dragon Dance Charizard can be very difficult to deal with late-game, especially if you're running an offensive team. With a single Dragon Dance under its belt, Charizard reaches 492 Speed, beating Choice Scarf Rotom and Hitmonlee, two of the fastest revenge killers commonly seen in UU. Flare Blitz is Charizard's main STAB move and is very powerful after a Dragon Dance. Even though Flare Blitz's recoil may be unappealing, Fire Punch is too weak at +1, and Charizard needs all the power it can get. Earthquake punishes Rock-types such as Rhyperior and Regirock, while Thunder Punch is Charizard's best answer to Water-types. Roost can used over Earthquake or Thunder Punch, but Charizard rarely finds opportunities to use both Roost and Dragon Dance.</p> <p>If you find Charizard's power a bit lacking, an Adamant nature can be used, provided your team has a reliable way of removing Choice Scarf Rotom, Choice Scarf Hitmonlee, and other revenge killers. Dragon Claw is an option for coverage if your team has trouble with Altaria.</p> <p>Slowbro is arguably the best counter to Dragon Dance Charizard thanks to its enormous physical Defense. Physically defensive Milotic also counters Charizard very well. Regirock and Rhyperior can take a +1 Earthquake and OHKO Charizard in return. Due to all of this, Charizard is better used in the late-game when every Pokemon on the opposing team has been significantly weakened or crippled, allowing it to clean up. The aforementioned Pokemon and Stealth Rock need to be cleared before Charizard attempts its sweep. Venusaur can easily switch into Slowbro and Milotic and threaten them with Sleep Powder or its STAB Grass-type attacks. Torterra can also switch into Slowbro and set up Rock Polish. Toxicroak does a similar job against Milotic, boosting its stats with Swords Dance or Nasty Plot, and can easily punch holes in the opponent's team. Rhyperior is an excellent switch-in to Regirock that can set up Rock Polish or Substitute to terrorize the opponent. Rapid Spinners are essential to run alongside Charizard, especially when it lacks Roost and its main STAB causes recoil. Hitmontop, Blastoise, and Donphan are all good Rapid Spinners to run alongside Charizard.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>With Charizard's naturally high Speed, it can forego Dragon Dance to boost its attack even further with Swords Dance, allowing it to reach a very high 534 Attack after a boost. Again, Flare Blitz is Charizard's main STAB for its sheer power, but since Charizard is now at +2 after a boost instead of +1, Fire Punch is acceptable if you don't like the absurd amount of residual damage that Charizard would be taking from Flare Blitz. For Charizard's coverage options, Earthquake hits Rock-types and Thunder Punch hits Water-types for super effective damage. Like the Dragon Dance set, Roost can be used over Earthquake or Thunder Punch, though Charizard finds it hard to boost and heal at the same time. Similarly, if your team is having trouble with Altaria, Dragon Claw can be used.</p> <p>To demonstrate Charizard's power after a Swords Dance, here are some damage calculations:</p> <ul> <li>+2 Flare Blitz vs 252 HP / 252 Def Bold Uxie: 64.41% - 75.71%</li> <li>+2 Flare Blitz vs 252 HP / 0 Def Mesprit: 100%</li> <li>+2 Thunder Punch vs 252 HP / 200 Def Milotic: 77.66% - 91.37</li> <li>+2 Thunder Punch vs 252 HP / 252 Def Bold Slowbro: 54.31% - 64.47%</li> <li>+2 Earthquake vs 252 HP / 0 Def Regirock: 62.64% - 74.18%</li> <li>+2 Earthquake vs 140 HP / 32 Def Rhyperior: 60.59% - 71.18%</li> </ul> <p>Without the Speed boost from Dragon Dance, Charizard is revenge killed a lot more easily. Due to this, it is best to scout opposing revenge killers before attempting to set up a sweep. Swords Dance Charizard is especially good at luring out bulky Water-types that expect Charizard to be a special attacking variant (such as Milotic and Slowking) and deal a lot of damage to them with a +2 Thunder Punch. Due to this, Pokemon that can take advantage of a weakened bulky Water-type make excellent partners to Swords Dance Charizard. Dragon Dance Feraligatr and Rock Polish Rhyperior are especially dangerous when opposing Milotic are weakened.</p> <p>Like all offensive Pokemon, Charizard appreciates entry hazard support to achieve some important KOs; for example, 252 HP / 200 Def Milotic is OHKOed by Thunder Punch after she switches into Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. Omastar can set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes while luring Grass-, Ground-, and Fighting-type attacks for Charizard to switch into. Cloyster can set up Spikes while using Rapid Spin to clear away Stealth Rock. On the topic of Stealth Rock, Rapid Spin support is, again, essential for Charizard's effectiveness. Hitmontop, Blastoise, and Donphan are good Rapid Spinners to run alongside Charizard.</p>"

      "Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<p>Charizard is the only Pokemon in the game, apart from Smeargle, to learn the combination of Dragon Dance, Swords Dance, and Belly Drum. BellyZard, once the epitome of an offensive powerhouse, is now possibly one of the highest-risk, relatively-lowest-reward sets in the 4th generation. Still, it is still quite potent when used unexpectedly. Utilizing BellyZard follows quite a strict format. The first step is to switch into a Pokemon that cannot hurt Charizard and scare it out, allowing for Charizard to set up Substitute. Proceed to use Belly Drum to max out Charizard's Attack stat while simultaneously activating Salac Berry and Blaze. From there, Charizard (hopefully) proceeds to sweep with 1068 Attack and 492 Speed. Fire Punch is Charizard's main STAB, which is boosted to acceptable levels with Blaze. Thunder Punch takes out bulky Water-types, while Earthquake takes out Rock-types.</p> <p>If you are more daring, Double-Edge can be used over Substitute. The idea behind it is to use Belly Drum first, possibly luring out a bulky Water-type, which are then KOed with Double-Edge, which allows Charizard to reach Salac Berry and Blaze activation range. The EVs are simple: let Charizard be as fast as possible so it is as difficult to revenge-kill as possible. 30 HP IVs are used so Charizard's HP is divisible by 4, allowing Salac Berry to activate after Substitute and Belly Drum. Earthquake or Thunder Punch can replace Substitute if the coverage is more important to Charizard than the Speed boost.</p> <p>While BellyZard looks horrifically scary on paper, it is very easy to stop in practice. Firstly, if Stealth Rock is up, Charizard will be unable to pull off a successful Belly Drum. Physically defensive Hariyama with Thick Fat can take a hit from Charizard and KO it in return. If Charizard lacks Thunder Punch, bulky Water-types can stop him, while if he lacks Earthquake, Rhyperior and Regirock are hard stops to it. Priority attacks also cut Charizard's sweep very short. These include Aqua Jet Azumarill, Extreme Speed Arcanine, and Sucker Punch Toxicroak. Sand Stream and Snow Warning make Charizard sad as well, since they force it to sweep on a timer. Before bringing Charizard out, scouting the opponent's team is extremely important. Rapid Spinners can clear away Stealth Rock for Charizard, while anti-leads, such as Taunt Ambipom, Electrode, and Choice Scarf Venusaur can prevent them from going up in the first place. Spiritomb, Mesprit, and Uxie are good switch-ins to Hariyama. Claydol is great for switching into Hariyama and also has the ability to use Rapid Spin to clear away Stealth Rock.</p>"

  "Blastoise": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite competition from bulkier Water-types and a plethora of Rapid Spin users, Blastoise remains a strong Pokemon of the UU tier. Its main use is as a bulky spinner, which it does very well with its strong defenses and great Water typing. Its excellent movepool allows it to serve other functions, from utilizing offensive Choice items to stalling opponents out with Toxic. Sadly, Blastoise is weakened by its lack of a reliable recovery move and weakness to Thunderbolt, a move commonly found on many spinblockers, such as Rotom. It is also checked by the numerous UU Grass-types, namely Leafeon, Venusaur, and Sceptile. Even with its flaws, Blastoise is still a staple Pokemon of the UU tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Blastoise has a few handy options that have yet to be mentioned. Haze can get rid of stat boosts, but it is usually overshadowed by Milotic in this department. Another rather gimmicky option is Counter and Mirror Coat, allowing Blastoise to score a surprise KO on an unsuspecting opponent. It can survive most non-STABed Grass and Electric attacks, making Mirror Coat a good option if you are willing to allow Blastoise to take the hit. Meanwhile, it is very difficult for opponents to OHKO Blastoise through physical attacks, so Counter allows Blastoise to bounce back those attacks for heavy damage. Blastoise also carries some nifty physical moves such as Waterfall, Ice Punch, and Earthquake, but these should be avoided as Azumarill, Feraligatr, and Kabutops completely outclass it in this department; however, Blastoise has the element of surprise on its side with these attacks, if nothing else.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Despite its unimpressive defenses, Rotom is a great counter to Blastoise, as it blocks Rapid Spin and can threaten Blastoise with Thunderbolt and Trick. The same can be said for Mismagius, as it usually carries Thunderbolt. Spiritomb can also get in Blastoise's way, but it won't be happy if it gets hit with Toxic. Grass-types are another huge threat to Blastoise in UU, namely Sceptile, Venusaur, and Leafeon. Venusaur can switch in on Blastoise the easiest, as it does not fear Toxic. If Blastoise lacks Rest, Toxic from the likes of Uxie and Milotic will make sure it does not stick around much longer. Lanturn will not enjoy Toxic, but can switch in easily and defeat Blastoise with Thunderbolt. Chansey can switch in on Blastoise at any time and wall it to no end. Substitute users, such as Toxicroak, Feraligatr, and Azumarill, can all set up on Blastoise if it lacks Haze and Roar. RestTalk stat boosters, such as Calm Mind Spiritomb and Curse Registeel, also give Blastoise trouble, as they can shrug off any inflicted status from it. Toxicroak is a big threat because it absorbs Surf thanks to Dry Skin and is immune to Poison, rendering Blastoise's two greatest offensive moves useless. Blastoise's final flaw is the lack of an instant recovery move, meaning that you can keep chipping away at it, but Blastoise can also do the same to you, so beware.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Blastoise is one of a handful of Pokemon gifted with the ever-useful Rapid Spin, and because of its bulk and great defensive typing, it can easily find opportunities to use it. It has little trouble switching in on common walls and using Rapid Spin to blow away any entry hazards. In addition to Rapid Spin, it has a number of good options for further team support such as Roar, as well as good offensive type coverage provided by Surf and Ice Beam. Blastoise makes a great teammate because of its versatility and ability to deal with a large variety of Pokemon.</p> <p>Surf is Blastoise's main form of STAB and a no-brainer on any bulky Water-type. If you invest 32 EVs into Speed, Blastoise can outspeed Jolly Rhyperior and Adamant Aggron and threaten them with a powerful Surf. The last two slots are not as straightforward, as Blastoise's excellent movepool allows it to use lots of moves to support its team. Toxic is a great option for wearing down opposing bulky Water-types and other opposing walls, while Yawn is a decent choice to put an enemy to sleep or force a switch. Foresight allows Blastoise to successfully spin away entry hazards against Ghost-type switch-ins. However, it still must be wary of Mismagius and Rotom who carry Thunderbolt. Ice Beam allows Blastoise to counter opposing Grass-types on the switch-in. If you opt for Toxic in the third slot, Roar is an option to scout the enemy's team, rack up entry hazard damage, and prevent opponents from setting up. Protect is also an option in the last slot, as it can help scout out Choice users and allows for an extra turn of Leftovers recovery while working well alongside both Toxic and Yawn. Rest deserves a mention as well, as Blastoise unfortunately lacks an instant recovery move.</p> <p>Ghost- and Grass-types are Blastoise's two greatest counters; Ghost-type Pokemon prevent Blastoise without Foresight from using Rapid Spin successfully. Furthermore, Spiritomb has the defenses to sponge Surf easily, while Mismagius and Rotom both threaten Blastoise with Thunderbolt. To remedy this, specially defensive variants of Registeel, Spiritomb, and Arcanine all work very well in tandem with Blastoise, walling Ghost-types when outfitted with the proper moves. Additionally, Blastoise can double switch to a Pursuit user such as Spiritomb, Drapion, or Skuntank to rid itself of Mismagius and Rotom. Altaria is one of the best switch-ins to Venusaur, as it does not fear any of its attacks and can absorb Sleep Powder thanks to Natural Cure. Venusaur itself also makes a great counter to Grass-types, although it must be wary of variants that carry Hidden Power Ice or Fire. Arcanine and Moltres can also switch in on Grass-types and scare them off. Fire-types will also benefit greatly from Blastoise due to their weakness to Stealth Rock. RestTalk Arcanine works especially well, as it can absorb Sleep Powder and Toxic. From there, it can use Sleep Talk to pummel opponents with Flare Blitz or shuffle them with Roar to allow entry hazards to chip away at their HP. As Blastoise's primary job is to Rapid Spin, a grounded Poison-type is very useful for absorbing Toxic Spikes. Drapion and Venusaur are two great candidates as they easily handle the Grass attacks aimed at Blastoise while fulfilling this role at the same time.</p> <p>Although not mandatory, a Wish user can prolong Blastoise's presence tremendously. Leafeon makes a great partner because it resists Blastoise's weakness to Grass and Electric, while Blastoise resists Leafeon's Fire and Ice weaknesses. Chansey and Clefable can fill the same role and also provide a special wall for your team. Clerics are also good friends of Blastoise as it fears status moves, especially Toxic. They are also great if you are running Rest in the last slot and do not want to leave Blastoise vulnerable.</p>"
      },
      "RestTalk Shuffler": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes a completely different approach to using Blastoise, while allowing it to keep its defensive role. The \"RestTalk\" strategy not only gives Blastoise a way to heal itself but also allows it to absorb the status moves it normally loathes. Meanwhile, Roar is used to shuffle opponents, allowing entry hazards to take their toll while Blastoise tanks hits. Roar also makes Blastoise extremely difficult to set up on, which opponents will inevitably attempt to do once Blastoise uses Rest. Conveniently, Sleep Talk also overrides Roar's -5 priority, meaning it can phaze slower opponents before they can attack. Surf's STAB and neutral type coverage make it a great attack to use with this set, allowing Blastoise to wear down opponents in its sleep.</p> <p>This set functions well on any team that incorporates Spikes and Stealth Rock, although it functions best on a stall team where it can be supported by other defensive Pokemon. Even without entry hazards, it still serves multiple useful purposes. Roar makes it a great phazer, and its bulk allows it to take many boosted physical attacks and then force the opponent to flee. It is especially useful against Curse and Calm Mind users, such as Registeel, Slowbro, and Miltank, that may prove difficult to take down with attacks.</p> <p>It is worth noting that Rapid Spin can replace Roar, but doing so changes the function and purpose of the set completely. With Rapid Spin, Blastoise plays much like it does when using the utility set, but with the addition of a recovery move and the omission of a status move. Stay away from replacing Roar with Ice Beam or Toxic, as Milotic can fill this niche significantly better.</p> <p>There are plenty of options available for Stealth Rock users, but Registeel is one of the best at handling Blastoise's weaknesses. Do not expect to find a Spikes user in UU that pairs well with Blastoise defensively, as there really is not one (outside of the frail Cacturne). For this reason, Spikes leads such as Omastar, Qwilfish, and Cloyster are best.</p> <p>Grass- and Electric-types, as well as other powerful special attackers such as Alakazam and Mismagius, need to be removed for Blastoise to be truly effective, although Blastoise does enjoy Roaring them away when they try to switch in. Chansey is, of course, the best Pokemon in the tier at walling special threats, and does so with ease. Additionally, it can utilize Aromatherapy to shorten Blastoise's slumber. The aforementioned specially defensive variants of Registeel, Spiritomb, and Arcanine all make for great checks to Blastoise's common switch-ins. RestTalk Weezing does an excellent job at walling Grass-types, and can be used in tandem with Blastoise to shut down almost all physical sweepers in the tier. Venusaur also provides great synergy with Blastoise, as it can handle both Grass- and Electric-types while having its own weaknesses to Fire and Ice attacks covered. Altaria works well also, having access to Heal Bell and Natural Cure while only needing to be wary of Hidden Power Ice and boosted special attacks.</p>"
      },
      "Tortoise of Choice": {
        "description": "<p>Although slapping Choice Specs on Blastoise may seem like an awkward fit, when paired with its recent acquisition, Water Spout, it makes for a very potent combination. Water Spout is a move that, despite its awesome power, is very rarely seen outside of the Uber tier, which is mostly attributable to the low Speed of its two NU owners: Octillery and Wailord. Blastoise, however, is not only considerably faster than these two but also is primarily used as a defensive Pokemon, giving it the surprise factor that its counterparts lack.</p> <p>The beauty of this set lies not in its raw attacking power but instead in its ability to lure in and destroy UU's top spinblockers; Rotom, Mismagius, and Spiritomb. When your opponent has Stealth Rock up in the early-game, switching in Blastoise will immediately coax out their spinblocker and allow Blastoise to KO it with Water Spout. Quickly dispensing of these Pokemon will allow Rapid Spin users such as Donphan and Claydol to perform their jobs with ease. As demonstrated by the damage calculations below, standard variants of Rotom and Mismagius will be OHKOed after Stealth Rock damage, while most Spiritomb will take massive damage and be primed for an easy 2HKO.</p> <ul> <li>87.5% HP Water Spout vs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Mismagius - 87.4% - 103.4%</li> <li>87.5% HP Water Spout vs. 252 HP / 0 SpD Rotom - 98% - 115.8%</li> <li>87.5% HP Water Spout vs. 252 HP / 0 SpD Spiritomb - 73.4% - 86.8%</li> <li>Max HP Water Spout vs. 252 HP / 212 SpD Clefable - 55.8% - 65.7%</li> <li>Ice Beam vs. 0 HP / 0 SpD Venusaur - 77.7% - 91.7%</li> <li>Ice Beam vs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Sceptile - 95% - 112.1%</li> <li>Hidden Power Grass vs. 248 HP / 0 SpD Milotic - 36.1% - 42.7%</li> <li>Hidden Power Grass vs. 252 HP / 4 SpD Slowbro - 51.8% - 61.4%</li> <li>Hidden Power Grass vs. 252 HP / 0 SpD Azumarill - 51% - 60.4%</li> </ul> <p>The attacks on this set are pretty much standard in UU in terms of type coverage. Ice Beam covers Altaria and Grass-types, while Hidden Power Grass smacks bulky Water-types that attempt to wall Blastoise. A second Water-type move is often necessary to give Blastoise a STAB move when its HP drops below a certain point. When running Surf, Water Spout is the preferable attack while Blastoise's HP exceeds 63%. It should be noted that Rapid Spin is also a viable option in the last slot if you do not want to use a dedicated Rapid Spin user. However, switching Blastoise into Stealth Rock twice (once to KO the opponent's spinblocker and once to Rapid Spin) hurts Water Spout greatly, to the point that Hydro Pump will usually be the superior option.</p> <p>Choice Scarf is a viable option over Choice Specs if you want to transform Blastoise into a revenge killer of sorts. With a Modest nature and a spread of 16 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpA / 232 Spe it climbs near the top of the Speed tiers, outpacing all base 120s. Being faster than the likes of Sceptile and Alakazam will certainly surprise your opponent. Without Choice Specs, however, Blastoise becomes significantly less powerful, and will struggle to achieve the KOs it needs. Therefore, entry hazards are important to pair with this set in order to weaken fragile Pokemon. When played correctly, this set's Speed can make it a very potent check to quite a few sweepers. It should be noted that, while it does not score the same OHKOs on Ghost-types, it outspeeds and 2HKOes them easily if they stay in.</p> <p>As previously mentioned, this set is made to be best friends with a Rapid Spin user. Donphan and Claydol both make solid partners and have the added bonus of being immune to Electric attacks. Hitmontop is also an option, although Foresight allows it to effectively take on spinblockers by itself. Pairing Blastoise with any of these Pokemon makes for a trustworthy method of eliminating entry hazards, which allows Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon to reach their full potential. Some of the most fearsome attackers in UU fit this bill, including Scyther, Moltres, Swellow, Houndoom, and even Charizard.</p>"

  "Butterfree": {
    "overview": "<p>Butterfree, at a glance, is a terrible Pokemon. Horrible typing, bad stats overall, a shallow movepool, and a 4x Stealth Rock weakness undermine much of her remaining positive qualities. However, Butterfree does have one thing going for her: a 97.5% accurate Sleep Powder! Compound Eyes remedies Sleep Powder's otherwise problematic accuracy, which plagues other sleep-inducing leads such as Scarf Venusaur and Jumpluff. Having access to a 97.5% accurate Stun Spore is also pretty good, and with U-turn to scout for switch-ins, Butterfree starts to seem like a decent option. In the end, while these things certainly don't make up for Butterfree's large number of shortcomings, they at least help her to stand out as an interesting alternative status spreader.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Unfortunately, Butterfree's movepool is really shallow, so there aren't many viable options here. Roost and Morning Sun may be used if you want some healing, but 50% healing generally doesn't mean much for Butterfree. It could work somewhat decently if you're running a spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 Spe, but even then, Butterfree is rather frail. Butterfree could cobble together a Sunny Day set up set with Sleep Powder, Sunny Day, Morning Sun/Safeguard, and U-turn, but other Pokemon can do a better job of it. Energy Ball can be used if you want to deal with Kabutops, Omastar, and Rhyperior; however, Bug Buzz is generally the better option, as you hit Mesprit and Uxie harder, both of whom are more common than Kabutops, Omastar, and Rhyperior. It should also be noted that even Energy Ball won't OHKO Rhyperior and only has a slim chance of OHKOing Omastar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Butterfree absolutely despises any kind of Sleep Talker, as they can absorb the status effects, especially sleep, that Butterfree spreads around. RestTalk Altaria, Spiritomb, and Rotom are all particularly annoying for Butterfree to face because they can either set up in her face or, in Rotom's case, KO Butterfree with a STAB Discharge or Thunderbolt. Pokemon who can set up Substitute before Butterfree can do anything are also irritating for Butterfree to face, though they must be wary of Stun Spore on the switch-in. Rotom and Mismagius are great examples of this, as they're bulky enough to take Butterfree's weak STAB moves and set up on her.</p> <p>As a lead, Butterfree fears Electrode. Electrode will always outspeed Butterfree and stop her from putting it to sleep with Taunt. From there, Electrode can set up Rain Dance without much fear of any of Butterfree's weak attacks. Leads with Lum Berry are also irksome, as the Lum Berry will remove the sleep instantly while the opposing Pokemon sets up on or KOes you. Lead Swellow is another lead who Butterfree fails against. With Protect, he can stop any attempts by Butterfree to paralyze or sleep him, then become immune to her status attacks via his Toxic or Flame Orb. After this, Swellow can simply KO Butterfree.</p> <p>If you lack a Sleep Talker, sending a bulky Pokemon who can survive being asleep for a couple of turns will do just fine. Milotic, Registeel, Chansey, and Altaria are great choices for this. In the case of the last two, they can remove the sleep upon switching out with their handy Natural Cure ability, so they won't have to stay asleep for long. For Milotic and Registeel, they are easily bulky enough to sleep for a couple of turns and still take a few hits safely. Toxic Orb Clefable is also a good counter to Butterfree, as she becomes immune to Butterfree's status after Toxic Orb activates and can easily shrug off her weak attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf Lead": {
        "description": "<p>This set allows Butterfree to outspeed many Pokemon in UU and quickly cripple them with an accurate Sleep Powder or Stun Spore. This set functions best as a lead, since there is no need to worry about switching into Stealth Rock; she can also stop the opponent from getting up entry hazards, which helps her teammates later in the match. Even though Choice Scarf may lock you into Sleep Powder or Stun Spore, it is still Butterfree's most consistent way of spreading status, as Butterfree's frailty and relatively low base 70 Speed really hurt her ability to status things.</p> <p>Sleep Powder is a given on this set, as the main reason you should be using Butterfree in the first place is her very reliable 97.5% accurate Sleep Powder. It's also (as mentioned previously) a great way to stop your opponent's lead from getting entry hazards up. U-turn provides a way for Butterfree to scout the opposition for any Sleep Talkers who may attempt to absorb your Sleep Powder, while Stun Spore allows Butterfree to accurately spread paralysis that's only blocked by Ditto, Persian and Hitmonlee later in the match. Bug Buzz rounds off the set by providing a nice STAB move from Butterfree's decent base 80 Special Attack.</p> <p>With a Timid nature, 252 Speed EVs, and a Choice Scarf, Butterfree reaches a Speed stat of 393, outspeeding every non-Scarfed lead in UU, barring Electrode. This almost guarantees that Butterfree will outspeed and put to sleep the opposing Pokemon. 252 EVs in Special Attack make Butterfree's Bug Buzz as strong as possible without sacrificing any Speed. Though a Timid nature weakens U-turn further, U-turn is extremely weak anyway, so there isn't much point to using a Naive or Hasty nature. However, if you wish for U-turn to hit harder, and don't find Bug Buzz too useful, max out Butterfree's Attack and give her a Jolly nature. If you opt for this route, you should replace Bug Buzz with another support move, such as Toxic, as Bug Buzz won't be doing much due to the lack of investment. Another alternate EV spread is 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 Spe. This increases Butterfree's overall durability quite a bit and allows you to take Ambipom's Fake Out better. This spread also makes it easier for Butterfree to come in later in the match to spread status.</p> <p>Because this set loses badly to Electrode, having a way to deal with Rain Dance is advised. Pairing Butterfree with bulky Water-types like Milotic and a Registeel can help against Rain Dance teams, as well as providing two solid defensive Pokemon for Butterfree to U-turn to. Stealth Rock greatly hampers Butterfree's ability to switch in later in the match, so Rapid Spinners are useful. Hitmontop, Donphan, and Blastoise are great choices as they resist some of Butterfree's common weaknesses. They also have a way to get a guaranteed Spin off with Foresight or Odor Sleuth.</p> <p>Offensively, Swellow and Ursaring work well in conjunction with Butterfree. Butterfree can give both of them a free switch in with Sleep Powder or U-turn to activate their Orbs. From this point, they can proceed to rip large holes in the opposing team (or at least put immediate pressure on the opponent). Rhyperior and Aggron are also great options because Butterfree can give them a free switch-in or set up turn, which they can use to wreak havoc. Butterfree can also slow down the opposition with her accurate Stun Spore. In general, Pokemon who benefit from free switches and/or free turns are great choices to pair with Butterfree.</p>"
      },
      "Double Status Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Though this set seems extremely similar to the first set, it plays quite differently. Whereas the first set is guaranteed to put a Pokemon to sleep, this set attempts to cripple more of the opponent's team after you've slept the opposing lead, or provide a free switch-in to one of your Pokemon. This set is especially effective against slower leads such as Omastar and Uxie because Butterfree will be able to outspeed and put them to sleep, allowing her to either paralyze the switch-in if they switch out, or simply scout the opponent's move with U-turn. Against faster leads with Taunt, this set does much worse, as it is almost forced to U-turn immediately. However, this can still give one of your Pokemon a free switch-in, so this can potentially benefit your team.</p> <p>Like the first set, Sleep Powder is once again used to stop slower leads from getting their entry hazards up. Stun Spore, with correct prediction, can allow you to cripple a third of your opponent's team in tandem with Sleep Powder via the Double Powder strategy. However, this strategy can be easily telegraphed due to it being commonly used on Butterfree, so U-turn provides a safe scouting move when you're unsure if your opponent will switch out. Protect is yet another scouting move that also allows you to stop the most common lead in UU, Ambipom, from breaking Butterfree's sash with Fake Out and KOing her the next turn.</p> <p>The given EVs make Butterfree as fast as possible without using a Choice Scarf. With 248 EVs in HP, Butterfree has a bit more overall bulk to take light attacks after her Sash has been broken. Maximum HP is not needed because Butterfree would only be able to switch into Stealth Rock once without taking any prior damage, thanks to her HP stat being an even number. Alternatively, you can move the HP EVs into Attack if you want to boost U-turn's power. However, U-turn is still quite weak, even with that much investment, so dropping the EVs into HP is generally the better option.</p> <p>As with the last set, Electrode is a huge threat. Carrying Pokemon like Milotic, Registeel, and Venusaur can help deal with the rain that Electrode is likely to bring. Kabutops and Arcanine leads can be quite threatening as well, seeing as they commonly carry Lum Berry. Milotic can once again be quite helpful in stopping these leads, though Kabutops will still be able to set up Stealth Rock, while Arcanine may try to Toxic Milotic.</p> <p>Once again, Pokemon who can abuse free switch-ins and turns when the opponent is crippled by sleep, such as Swellow and Ursaring, are effective partners to this set. However, this set provides more opportunities for slow, hard-hitting Pokemon such as Absol and Hariyama to set up or punch holes in the opposing team. This set can generally spread paralysis more easily than the first set because you aren't restricted to a single move. The paralysis can then assist these hard-hitting Pokemon, such as the aforementioned Absol and Hariyama, as well as Aggron and Rhyperior, in smashing through these teams that are slowed down from paralysis. Dugtrio is also an interesting partner for this set. Butterfree can U-turn out of a potential victim for Dugtrio, such as Registeel, who may attempt to absorb your sleep, allowing Dugtrio to get in for free and proceed to trap and KO the switch-in.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Beedrill is a bad Pokemon, but he has decent Attack and Speed, with enough of a movepool to use them; access to reliable STAB options, Endeavor, Toxic Spikes, Baton Pass, Swords Dance, and Agility, as well as key 4x resistances; all of which play their part in making Beedrill that much less useless. However, all of Beedrill's other stats are lackluster, and outside the aforementioned options, he does not have much more. A weakness to Stealth Rock doesn't help either. Still, Beedrill is better than most of his oft-forgotten Bug-type brothers, and though he is grossly outclassed, he is definitely a viable Pokemon in his own right.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Band set would seem obligatory with Beedrill's stat distribution, but the boost in power really does not net many additional KOs compared to the Scarf set, making it an almost completely inferior option. Aerial Ace is a fine choice for hitting other Bug-types, but they are few and far between in the UU tier. Bug Bite can be pretty funny if you manage to steal the opponent's Berry and ruin their game plan, but it is gimmicky and unreliable. Payback and Assurance are essentially the same exact move, and they can be used to nail predicted Ghost-type switch-ins. Finally, Toxic cripples bulky Water-types that might switch into Beedrill.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Poison-types, especially Weezing with its high physical defense and access to Flamethrower, are the best counters to Beedrill; resisting both his STABs, without being weak to any auxiliary attack he may possibly carry. Grounded ones can also absorb any Toxic Spikes Beedrill might set up just by switching in. Steel-types also resist both STABs, and usually have the bulk to take even Swords Dance-boosted Brick Breaks. Flying-types resist Bug, and can threaten with a super effective STAB attack; they just have to be a bit wary about poison from Poison Jab or Toxic. Ghost-types only have to fear Payback and Assurance, and can threaten in return with Will-O-Wisp.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Beedrill gets access to Swords Dance, and with his only usable stats being Attack and Speed, it is only natural to have a set based around it. It's not hard to believe that this is Beedrill's best bet at sweeping, and though getting the chance to set up might be a little hard, once you do, Beedrill may just surprise you.</p> <p>X-Scissor is a nice, reliable STAB for general usage, and it is quite powerful if you manage to get Beedrill into Swarm range. Brick Break offers the best coverage with X-Scissor and hits pesky Steel-types for super effective damage. In the final slot, we have Baton Pass, Poison Jab, and Substitute. Baton Pass is the main slash because it allows Beedrill to take his boosts and pass them to an ally (as opposed to wasting them), as well as scout switch-ins in the early-game. Poison Jab is a nice auxiliary STAB move though, hitting Flying-types hard, and having a nifty chance to poison some of the bulky Pokemon that Beedrill lures in. Finally, Substitute is useful for blocking status and easing prediction when you find yourself facing a Pokemon slower than Beedrill.</p> <p>The EVs are cookie-cutter for a sweeper, with maximum Attack and Speed to emphasize Beedrill's only worthwhile stats. An Adamant nature is recommended because the added power is often more useful than the extra Speed a Jolly nature provides. Still, Jolly is a viable option if you require Beedrill to outspeed neutral-natured base 80s, most notably Blaziken.</p> <p>Substitute can be used in conjunction with Salac Berry for some added Speed (be sure to put those last 4 EVs into HP if you do so, so as to activate the Salac Berry in just 3 Substitutes). Beedrill outspeeds everything up to positive-natured base 120s after the boost, which is more than enough to theoretically pull off a successful sweep. However, Beedrill's horrific physical defense makes him extremely susceptible to priority, and his typing leaves him vulnerable to damaging weather, which makes this option fail more often than not.</p> <p>Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin. These are Beedrill's favorite team options; especially when he's trying to sweep. Donphan and Claydol are great teammates to provide Rapid Spin as well as Stealth Rock, and they also resist any Rock-type attacks aimed at Beedrill. In return, Beedrill easily switches into Grass-type attacks. Any Pokemon that appreciates Attack boosts will also be good, and your options are going to be quite broad since every physical attacker does. Rhyperior and Azumarill are possibly the best receivers thanks to their high Attack stats. They also cover Beedrill's weaknesses quite well. If Beedrill happens to scout out a potential threat with Baton Pass early, you're also going to want a Pokemon that can scare out or trap said threat. For example, if a Steel-type comes in, a Magneton or Dugtrio waiting in the wings is going to be able to prevent them from ever ruining Beedrill's fun.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Beedrill can be an effective Choice Scarf user thanks to his decent Attack and Speed. U-turn is what really makes this set worthwhile, so it should be capitalized on, especially if you can get one off on the many Steel- or Fire-types Beedrill lures in, bring in a trapper like Dugtrio, and nab a free KO. X-Scissor is Beedrill's most reliable STAB move, and it can even be used to sweep late-game if Swarm is activated. Brick Break provides nice coverage with X-Scissor, 2HKOing such switch-ins as Aggron and Kabutops. Finally, while Poison Jab is a good secondary STAB move to hit Flying-types, Pursuit is just swell for trapping weakened Pokemon, especially the likes of Rotom and Mismagius, sealing their fate.</p> <p>Maximum Speed with an Adamant nature allows Beedrill to outspeed everything up to positive-natured base 120s, which is where his prime targets are: Sceptile and Alakazam. Attack is also maximized for added power, and the rest go into Special Defense, as Beedrill really shouldn't be investing at all in his terrible Defense. A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed Swellow, but Beedrill is incapable of OHKOing it with any of its moves, and Swellow has Quick Attack to negate this advantage anyway.</p> <p>For any Beedrill set, Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin support is obligatory. But Choice Scarf Beedrill, being the one that will switch in and out the most, almost requires the latter, as having only a maximum of 5 switch-ins as a scout and revenge killer is... pretty bad. Choice Scarf Beedrill also likes stuff that can come in on the bulky Pokemon it will lure in on the U-turn. Fire-types such as Arcanine fear nothing from Weezing, and Pursuit users such as Houndoom can trap and eliminate Ghost-types from the match. A Pokemon that can set up on Pursuit is also useful, as the ever frail Beedrill doesn't like the move one bit.</p>"

      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>This set drops the idea of sweeping completely, and instead aims to support a teammate with the boosts that Beedrill can provide. Agility and Swords Dance are both very useful boosting moves, and the appropriate pinch Berry should be used to make up for the stat that is not being boosted. Substitute eases the Berry activation, and is also useful for blocking status and passing in its own right. Finally, X-Scissor is the obligatory STAB move, ensuring that Beedrill is not complete Taunt bait; without any investment though, it's going to hit like the soft end of a feather duster, so don't expect it to KO anything healthy anytime soon.</p> <p>The EVs maximize the number of potential targets Beedrill can set up on, and give a HP number divisible by 4, activating the pinch Berry after 3 Substitutes (or 2 Substitutes and Stealth Rock). The rest go into Special Defense to ease the damage taken from less powerful special attacks. Even with the investment though, Beedrill won't be taking any powerful attacks anytime soon, especially physical ones, so don't expect him to. It is not advised to have both Swords Dance and Agility on the same moveset, as with Beedrill's defenses, he won't get the chance to obtain more than one boost in a typical match.</p> <p>Rhyperior is an ideal teammate to pass to, as it can easily capitalize on either and any of the boosts Beedrill can provide. It's also awesome that Beedrill and it happen to cover each other's weaknesses almost perfectly. As with other pure Baton Passers, you should keep in mind that Beedrill is more of an accessory to your team, moreso than an actual teammate. Therefore, your team should be able to function even without Beedrill's presence, and having Beedrill on the team only helps the team by providing the tools to sweep late-game.</p>"

      "Toxic Spikes Lead": {
        "description": "<p>While Beedrill may seem outclassed in the role of a Toxic Spikes lead by Venomoth, who has access to Sleep Powder, Tinted Lens, and higher stats in everything that is relevant, Beedrill has one trick up his sleeve, Endeavor, an extremely useful and unique move to Beedrill when used in the lead slot. The idea is quite simple. Against slower leads, Beedrill can set up Toxic Spikes until it gets knocked down to low HP, and then depending on the situation, either set up another layer and get KOed, or Endeavor to bring the opposing Pokemon down to 1 HP. Beedrill's options are limited to just the latter strategy against faster leads. Protect is the option for the third slot so Ambipom and Hariyama don't ruin this strategy with Fake Out, while X-Scissor and U-turn are the predictable STAB options that every Pokemon should have.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Beedrill's two strongest points, and everything else, including the IVs, go into making Endeavor as effective as possible. Obviously, Pokemon that benefit from Toxic Spikes being on the field make the best teammates to this set. Stall teams, SubRoosters, and Pokemon that use Wish + Protect for recovery can all easily abuse the steady damage of Toxic Spikes to great effect. Don't forget spinblockers, such as Spiritomb, either; you never want all of Beedrill's hard work to just disappear.</p> <p>In terms of leading, Beedrill actually fares quite well with most leads thanks to Focus Sash and Endeavor. However, Qwilfish, in particular, can utilize Taunt to prevent Beedrill from executing his strategy and then freely set up its own payload afterwards. To counteract it, a good Rapid Spin user (let's say Blastoise) to remove entry hazards it might set up, and a strong team core to protect against rain are necessary.</p>"

  "Pidgeot": {
    "overview": "<p>With two useless abilities and a lacking movepool, Pidgeot's effectiveness in the UU tier is pretty abysmal, especially when compared to other Normal- and Flying-types like Swellow, and to an extent, Fearow and Dodrio. Pidgeot does, however, have significantly greater bulk, access to moves like Brave Bird and U-turn, and an acceptable base Speed stat, all of which are key factors when deciding whether to use Pidgeot or not.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Outside of using a Choice item, Pidgeot's lacking movepool doesn't hold many other viable options. You can abuse Pidgeot's bulk on a defensive set using Roost and Feather Dance, but this is highly outclassed by defensive variants of Moltres and Articuno, both of which possess better base stat layouts. Similarly, sets utilizing Tailwind, a Life Orb, or even Choice Specs can be used but these options are all terribly outclassed in UU. Also, Double-Edge can replace Return on any set, but as Brave Bird and Double-Edge are illegal together, you will have to use Aerial Ace as Pidgeot's Flying-type STAB move; this change is not recommended, as Brave Bird is an amazing move with excellent coverage that Pidgeot should not leave home without.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Any Pokemon that resists Pidgeot's main attacks and has good enough physical bulk can be called a Pidgeot counter. Pokemon like Registeel and Steelix stop Pidgeot cold with their resistances to Pidgeot's attacks and massive defensive stats. Registeel can cripple the bird with Thunder Wave and smash it with Iron Head, while Steelix can slam Stone Edges in its face. Moreover, set-up Pokemon like Aggron and Rhyperior can comfortably switch in and begin thrashing Pidgeot's team. Rotom can switch into more than half of Pidgeot's moveset with ease and OHKO it with Thunderbolt. Lastly, any defensive behemoth without a Flying weakness, like Uxie, can check Pidgeot as even without resistances to its attacks, its mediocre damage output will still fail to piece their defenses.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>With a useful base 91 Speed stat, a decent base 80 Attack stat, and access to a couple of respectable physical moves including Brave Bird, U-turn, and Return, Pidgeot can effectively utilize a Choice Band, serving as both a revenge killer and a scout on a UU team.</p> <p>Brave Bird and Return are staples on the set as they provide Pidgeot with reliable, strong STAB moves, though the former, unfortunately, causes recoil damage. U-turn allows Pidgeot to scout opposing Pokemon that might switch in and expect to set up on a resisted attack. Pursuit makes Pidgeot a decent check to a couple of Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon in the tier, while Quick Attack can be used to hit faster foes, which is useful since Pidgeot is outpaced by many Pokemon in UU.</p> <p>The EVs are self-explanatory. Maximum Attack and Speed are used to amplify Pidgeot's offensive capabilities, while the rest of the EVs are dumped into Defense to round down the amount of damage from Stealth Rock. The decision between an Adamant or a Jolly nature is dependent upon your team; although an Adamant nature boosts the power of Pidgeot's attacks, a Jolly nature allows it to outpace Pokemon that have a Speed stat of 90 or less, some notable ones including Venusaur, Hitmonlee, and Kangaskhan. You can also use a Choice Scarf on this set to let Pidgeot revenge kill certain foes, such as Alakazam, Blaziken, and Sceptile. However, Pidgeot will be worse off on the long run due to its mediocre Attack stat.</p> <p>As Pidgeot is a Flying-type, Stealth Rock will prove to be a problem for it as Pidgeot will take 25% damage every time it switches in. Including a Rapid Spinner, such as Donphan or Kabutops, on your team will significantly enhance Pidgeot's longevity. Also, Dugtrio is an excellent offensive partner to Pidgeot as it can trap and KO many of Pidgeot's common switch-ins, the significant one being Registeel. Pokemon that benefit from the removal of Venusaur or Milotic also make great partners to Pidgeot, since it is able to easily OHKO any variant of Venusaur with Brave Bird and 2HKO the standard Milotic after Stealth Rock damage.</p>"

  "Pikachu": {
    "overview": "<p>The poster child of the Pokemon franchise is, quite disappointingly, not as great on the battlefield as Ash makes it out to be. While in the anime Pikachu is able to withstand assaults from the mighty Dragonite and electrocute even the ferocious Rhydon (aim for the horn!), Pikachu would be lucky to withstand a rain-boosted Surf from Luvdisc in the real game. Pikachu does wield a lot of power while holding a Light Ball, and has quite the extensive movepool, but that power is easily mitigated by its rice paper-thin defenses and sub-par Speed. Using Pikachu demands an incredible amount of prediction, skill, and some serious cojones. Fortunately there is quite honestly nothing more satisfying than destroying your opponent with the annoying rodent.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Pikachu has many other options, though most are not worthwhile. Surf can be used instead of a coverage move, hitting Pokemon such as Steelix, Aggron, Nidoking, Nidoqueen, and Camerupt for super effective damage. Volt Tackle is a powerful STAB attack, but with a pitiful uninvested base HP stat of 35, recoil moves are going to be wearing out Pikachu extremely quickly. Brick Break can be used to 2HKO Chansey, but Substitute and Focus Punch usually accomplish the same task, and Brick Break misses out on 2HKOes against Clefable, Registeel, and Lanturn. Agility can be used, but Pikachu already outspeeds most of the Pokemon it needs to. Even after an Agility boost, Pikachu will still be extremely vulnerable to priority attacks, making it a somewhat redundant option. Quick Attack can be used for priority, but Pikachu will almost always appreciate a coverage move more. Pikachu also has access to Wish, Teeter Dance, Knock Off, Thunder Wave, and Toxic, which are all good moves; however, Pikachu's poor defensive stats mean that it cannot make good use of them. Finally, Pikachu has access to Magnet Rise, but it is almost completely useless because even resisted attacks will be able to 2HKO Pikachu anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Prediction is the key to defeating Pikachu. Everything with more than 90 base Speed can be called a check, because any Pokemon that outspeeds it will most likely be able to OHKO Pikachu before it can retaliate. Dugtrio is a great counter, being able to switch in on a predicted Thunderbolt or Encore, trap Pikachu, and OHKO it with Earthquake. Special walls such as Clefable, Chansey, and Registeel usually do well too, but should be wary of Focus Punch, which will 2HKO all of them. Finally, specially defensive Venusaur and Lanturn can act as counters quite well; Lanturn takes almost no damage from Grass Knot, while Venusaur does not take a lot even from Hidden Power Ice.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute": {
        "description": "<p>Substitute is one of Pikachu's best moves to utilize, because it eases prediction and protects it from priority attacks. Thunderbolt is Pikachu's main STAB attack, and it will hit a lot of Pokemon hard coming off a whopping 398 Special Attack stat. Hidden Power Ice hits Grass-type Pokemon that resist Thunderbolt for super effective damage, but Grass Knot is a fine option to hit some Ground-type Pokemon that would otherwise be able to survive a super effective Hidden Power and smash Pikachu with Earthquake. If Hidden Power Ice is used, Pikachu loses to Rhyperior and other Water / Ground-type Pokemon, while Venusaur and other Grass-types will easily defeat Pikachu if Grass Knot is used. Encore is a great option in the final slot, capable of granting Pikachu the free turn it needs to set up a Substitute, or allow other sweepers to set up, gaining momentum against the opponent's team. However, Focus Punch is also a viable option as it is very unexpected, and can easily deal large amounts of damage to bulky special walls, such as Chansey and Registeel, that Pikachu often lures in.</p> <p>If Focus Punch is used, a Naive nature with 12 Attack EVs will allow Pikachu to 2HKO Lanturn. Prediction is the key when using Pikachu, as one wrong move can cost the Mouse Pokemon its life. U-turn support is very helpful, as it provides useful offensive momentum which can allow Pikachu to come in more easily, scare away the opposing Pokemon, and set up a Substitute. Entry hazards are also very important, allowing Pikachu to switch in on a slow Pokemon using a set up move and force it to switch out via Encore. It would be wise to use setup sweepers that can come in after Pikachu uses Encore for the free turn of set-up. For example, Pikachu can Encore an Earthquake from a Pokemon it can't deal with from behind a Substitute, then switch to a teammate that is immune to Ground-type attacks to set up. Examples include Scyther and Rotom, who can set up a Swords Dance and Substitute, respectively. If Hidden Power Ice is not used in the third slot, it can be used over Encore or Focus Punch, giving Pikachu more coverage.</p> <p>Choice Band Dugtrio is a great teammate, being able to take on Pikachu's worse nemesis, Chansey. Earthquake 2HKOes, while Chansey cannot switch out due to Arena Trap; Dugtrio is also able to trap other special walls that would otherwise essentially wall Pikachu. If Pikachu has Encore in its movepool, setup sweepers are great teammates, because Pikachu can easily grant them a free turn of set-up with it. Finally, if Focus Punch is used, powerful special sweepers such as Moltres make good teammates, as with Chansey successfully eliminated, Moltres can easily devastate teams with its powerful STAB Fire Blast.</p>"

After this boost, Pikachu reaches a Special Attack stat of 796, more than enough to obliterate the entire UU tier. This firepower coupled with Pikachu's decent Speed allows it to sweep given the chance. Your choice of Substitute or Encore will allow Pikachu to set-up more easily, either by switching on a recovery move in the case of Encore, or forcing a bulky Water-type out in the case of Substitute. Thunderbolt is Pikachu's STAB move of choice, wrecking anything that does not resist it after the boost. Hidden Power Ice is used over Grass Knot on this set because of the better type coverage it provides; with Grass Knot, Pikachu will be walled hard by all Grass-types, while a boosted Hidden Power Ice can OHKO offensive Venusaur even without Stealth Rock, as well as many Ground-types that would otherwise give Pikachu trouble.</p> <p>Pikachu often doesn't have the luxury of having both a Nasty Plot boost and a Substitute at the same time. Hence, scouting and getting rid of priority users is recommended, especially if you choose to run Encore over Substitute. Thunder Wave support can also help Pikachu outspeed those Pokemon that are naturally faster than it, as 90 base Speed isn't really too impressive.</p> <p>As with all sweepers, Pikachu appreciates entry hazard support, even more so because Pikachu is unable to take a hit. Basically, if Pikachu cannot OHKO the opposing Pokemon, it will be KOed in return. Even after a Nasty Plot boost, Pikachu does not have enough damage output to break through Chansey. Therefore, having a way to eliminate Chansey is recommended. Pursuit users, such as Choice Band Drapion or Absol, will generally put her in KO range of Pikachu's boosted Thunderbolt.</p>"

Access to both Encore and Nasty Plot differentiates Raichu from other specially oriented sweepers such as Nasty Plot Mismagius and Nasty Plot Toxicroak. Unfortunately, his frailty and lack of useful resistances mean that it is relatively hard to switch Raichu into battle. With that said, if a quick Encore user who also poses as a powerful offensive threat is needed, then Raichu is a great choice.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Raichu's movepool is surprisingly wide for an Electric-type; despite this, Raichu ultimately falls into the \"jack of all trades, master of none\" category. For example, a specialized support set with Encore and Wish can be used, but Clefable is usually a better choice for this role due to her superior defensive stats and her ability, Magic Guard. Raichu can use Choice Specs with Thunderbolt / Hidden Power Ice / Grass Knot / Focus Blast for outstanding coverage and power, but this set is usually outclassed by Manectric, who boasts similar coverage, access to Switcheroo, and more power and much more Speed. An Agility + 3 Attacks set can be used, but Raichu is too weak to actually sweep after an Agility boost. Raichu has access to Teeter Dance, which in conjunction with Thunder Wave allows Raichu to abuse the ParaFusion strategy. However, Raichu is usually outperformed by Lanturn, who boasts significantly more bulk and a better defensive typing. Raichu also has access to moves such as Charm, Tickle, Surf, Magnet Rise, and Yawn, each of which have a use in certain situations but are better off left unused since they are typically unreliable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Chansey is as an excellent counter to Nasty Plot Raichu due to her phenomenal HP and high Special Defense stats. Chansey can cripple Raichu with Thunder Wave or Toxic, or simply wear him down with Seismic Toss. She needs to be wary of a Nasty Plot-boosted Focus Blast, however, which will 2HKO. Lanturn and Quagsire are both immune to Thunderbolt, and can easily survive most of Raichu's attacks and cripple him with Thunder Wave and Earthquake, respectively. Quagsire who lack Special Defense investment should be wary of a Nasty Plot-boosted Focus Blast, however, as it can potentially OHKO him. Registeel and Steelix are excellent counters to Nasty Plot Raichu without Focus Blast.</p> <p>The Substitute + Focus Punch sets are easily countered by Venusaur, who completely walls Raichu. Steelix is an excellent counter to SubPunch sets. His ridiculously high Defense stat allows him to sponge Focus Punch. Donphan and Rhyperior are also immune to Volt Tackle, take very low damage from Focus Punch, but should be aware of Grass Knot, which can deal heavy damage. Priority moves from Pokemon such as Hitmontop and Arcanine can take out Raichu easily due to his frailty. Finally, Dugtrio is a top-notch check to Raichu, since he is able to trap and OHKO Raichu with Arena Trap and Earthquake.</p>",

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Nasty Plot boosts Raichu's modest Special Attack to incredible levels, giving him an opportunity to sweep. Thunderbolt is Raichu's STAB move of choice and OHKOes Milotic and Slowking after a Nasty Plot boost. Hidden Power Ice provides pseudo-BoltBeam coverage and allows Raichu to hit Ground- and Grass-types for super effective damage. Encore gives Raichu a much better chance to set up a Nasty Plot, but Focus Blast may be used to get past certain defensive Pokemon, including Registeel, Clefable, and Steelix.</p> <p>While Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice provide nearly perfect neutral coverage (only resisted by Lanturn and Shedinja in UU), sometimes that isn't enough for a sweep. Focus Blast can help Raichu break through teams since it scores super effective hits on a number of key targets, as shown in the following damage calculations:</p> <ul> <li>vs 252/156+ Registeel: 83.5% - 98.4%</li> <li>vs 252/252+ Clefable: 103.6% - 121.8%</li> <li>vs 0/252+ Chansey: 57.4% - 67.7%</li> <li>vs 252/252+ Steelix: 140.7% - 165.5%</li> </ul> <p>Although Nasty Plot Raichu is incredibly powerful, he still has trouble with some Pokemon depending on which moves he carries. Chansey is a good counter to Raichu, as she can cripple Raichu with Thunder Wave or Toxic; however, if Raichu carries Focus Blast, he can 2HKO Chansey. Raichu also has difficulty getting past Registeel without Focus Blast. Dugtrio is capable of trapping and removing the aforementioned threats with ease, giving non-Focus Blast Raichu an easier time sweeping. Dugtrio is also an excellent check to Raichu, as he can switch into 3 out of 4 of Raichu's moves with ease and OHKO with Earthquake. Houndoom with Sucker Punch can lure and KO Dugtrio, as can Pokemon who utilize Substitute and are weak to Ground-type attacks. Good Dugtrio users might not fall into these traps, however, so any player using Raichu should be wary of signs that the opponent might have Dugtrio, such as the presence of Scyther or Swellow.</p> <p>Raichu will be hard-pressed to switch into any attack with his sub-par defenses. For example, bulky Water-types will 2HKO Raichu with Surf. Instead, switching into predicted non-damaging moves and using Encore is more reliable. For example, Donphan using Stealth Rock, Toxicroak using Swords Dance or Sucker Punch, and even Chansey using Wish are all opportunities Raichu can use to set up a Nasty Plot. After Raichu has Encored his foe into uselessly repeating a move, he can set up a Nasty Plot on the switch or simply attack with Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Ice to scout.</p>"

      "SubPunch": {
        "description": "<p>Unlike the Nasty Plot set, this Raichu variant attempts to break walls and act as a general annoyer to your opponent's team. The goal of this set is to set up a Substitute on a forced switch, via Encore, and wear down the opponent's team with a combination of Focus Punch and Volt Tackle. Substitute offers Raichu immediate protection and immunity to status, and is necessary to safely pull off a Focus Punch. Focus Punch allows Raichu to smash through many common walls, while also hitting all of the Pokemon that counter the previous set hard. This makes Raichu a decent lure for specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and Registeel expecting to easily counter Raichu's Nasty Plot set. Encore is highly important for this set to succeed, as it allows Raichu to set up a Substitute on Pokemon who would otherwise threaten him. For example, Raichu can switch into a Registeel or a Donphan using Stealth Rock, Encore them, then set up a Substitute on the switch. Raichu can also use Encore to give his teammates an opportunity to set up. For example, if Raichu is behind a Substitute and the opposing Pokemon attacks with Earthquake, Raichu can use Encore and switch out to a Pokemon with a Ground-type immunity to give that teammate a free turn to attack or set up.</p> <p>Raichu can use Life Orb over Leftovers to gain more power. With a Life Orb boost, Raichu is guaranteed to 2HKO Registeel with the combination of Focus Punch and Volt Tackle. However, Life Orb comes with deadly recoil, which when combined with the HP lost from Substitute and recoil from Volt Tackle, will quickly wear out Raichu. Grass Knot is an option over Encore if you want to get by common counters to this set. Pokemon such as Donphan and Rhyperior, who are immune to Volt Tackle and take laughable amounts of damage from Focus Punch, are 2HKOed by Grass Knot.</p> <p>This Raichu set has a hard time getting past Venusaur, who completely walls all of his moves. If Raichu is lacking Grass Knot, Donphan and Rhyperior stop it cold. This makes Moltres an excellent partner to Raichu. Moltres can switch into all three of the aforementioned Pokemon without trouble (assuming Donphan and Rhyperior don't use a Rock-type attack), and threaten them with his STAB and coverage moves. Additionally, Raichu and Moltres share decent synergy with each other. Moltres is capable of switching into Ground-type attacks aimed at Raichu, while Raichu is capable of switching into certain bulky Water-types and weak Electric-type moves.</p>"

Combine these resistances with very solid 90 / 87 / 85 defenses and an immunity to Toxic, and Nidoqueen will find herself with numerous opportunities to switch in and set up Toxic Spikes and Stealth Rock. However, Nidoqueen lacks the stats to use her expansive offensive movepool effectively, and lacks recovery outside of Rest, so having a teammate to buffer any Water-, Ice-, and Psychic-type attacks aimed at Nidoqueen will be required and will greatly increase her longevity, allowing her to continuously support your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Nidoqueen has such a vast offensive movepool that you could expect the words \"super effective\" to appear many times throughout a battle. Aqua Tail, Blizzard, Body Slam, Crunch, Dragon Pulse, Fire Blast, Flamethrower, Focus Blast, Focus Punch, Outrage, Pursuit, Rock Slide, Shadow Ball, Superpower, and Thunderbolt are just some of the moves that she has at her disposal. Unfortunately, Nidoqueen lacks the stats to effectively make use of purely offensive sets, so you are better off using Nidoking, who has an almost identical movepool, higher Speed, and hits harder than Nidoqueen.</p> <p>Nidoqueen also has other support options outside of entry hazards and Roar. Nidoqueen has access to both Taunt and Super Fang, allowing her to take down walls that she wouldn't be able to otherwise. However, because of Nidoqueen's lack of recovery, forcing your opponent to attack will significantly reduce her survivability. Nidoqueen also has access to Charm and Captivate to reduce her opponent's Attack and Special Attack, respectively, forcing them to switch and thus racking up entry hazard damage. However, note that Captivate will only work on male Pokemon, so female special attackers will still be able to set up on Nidoqueen.</p> <p>Rest is Nidoqueen's only method of recovery, but thanks to her typing and defensive stats, a RestTalk set is quite a viable option for Nidoqueen. With Rest and Sleep Talk, Nidoqueen becomes an excellent status absorber and her survivability greatly increases. Nidoqueen has multiple options for her other moves; Roar could be considered the best choice, since Sleep Talk negates its negative priority, and it prevents your opponent from setting up on Nidoqueen. Toxic Spikes can be used, but once you get two layers up, it is a waste of a slot, and Sleep Talk will end up only having a 1/3 chance of selecting a useful move. Ice Beam and Dragon Pulse are Nidoqueen's best options for the last moveslot; Dragon Pulse has amazing neutral coverage, only being resisted by Steel-types, while Ice Beam allows Nidoqueen to hit opposing Ground- and Grass-types for super effective damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Milotic, Blastoise, Slowbro, and Azumarill are perfect counters to Nidoqueen since their bulk allows them to switch into her attacks quite easily. However, they must watch out for Toxic and Toxic Spikes if they lack Rest. Gardevoir and Espeon have respectable Special Defense stats and can switch into Nidoqueen and threaten her with Psychic. Venusaur absorbs Toxic Spikes and brushes off Ice Beam thanks to his high Special Defense stat. He can also incapacitate Nidoqueen with Sleep Powder and set up Swords Dance or attack outright with Leaf Storm or Earthquake.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Thanks to her high Defense and decent typing, Nidoqueen is able to check numerous physical threats. Unlike other physically defensive Ground-types, Nidoqueen has a usable Special Attack stat that allows her to strike physical attackers, such as Aggron and Rhyperior, on their weaker Special Defense stat.</p> <p>Nidoqueen's typing grants her resistances to many common UU attacking types, such as Rock, Fighting, and Bug, which enables her to set up Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes with ease. As for her attacking moves, Earth Power allows Nidoqueen to hit Rhyperior and Aggron for super effective damage, while Ice Beam allows her to strike Donphan, Torterra, and Altaria. Bulky Pokemon, such as Milotic and Slowbro, are severely crippled by Toxic Spikes. Roar can be used instead to rack up entry hazard damage, scout your opponent's team, and phaze out any stat-boosters.</p> <p>The given EVs are self-explanatory, but you can shift some Defense EVs into Speed if you wish. 48 Speed EVs allow Nidoqueen to outspeed Rhyperior and Adamant Aggron, and strike them with a super effective Earth Power. With 96 EVs, Nidoqueen outspeeds Adamant Torterra and minimum Speed Altaria. Finally, Nidoqueen is able to outspeed Jolly Aggron with 124 Speed EVs, but the loss of bulk generally isn't worth it. Nidoqueen can use Toxic in her last slot, giving her a way to poison Levitate users and Flying-types, such as Uxie and Moltres. Nidoqueen can also choose to adopt a purely physical set with a moveset of Earthquake, Stone Edge, and Crunch. A physical set will hit Chansey and Registeel harder, Stone Edge will ward off Moltres, while Crunch will allow Nidoqueen to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types for super effective damage.</p> <p>Since Nidoqueen will most likely be used on defensive teams, it makes sense to add Spikes support, due to Nidoqueen's ability to rack up residual damage with Roar. Cloyster makes a solid Spikes partner since he can set up on Donphan's and Steelix's Earthquake, while Nidoqueen buffers Rock- and Electric-type attacks directed at Cloyster. This set has problems with bulky Waters such as Milotic, Blastoise, and Azumarill. Even Toxic is somewhat unreliable since Milotic and Blastoise both have viable RestTalk sets. Venusaur is a great partner to pair Nidoqueen with since he has the ability to check almost every bulky Water with the appropriate EV investment. Do note, however, that this will give your team an undesirable weakness to Alakazam (and Psychic-type moves in general), so be sure to pack a Spiritomb, Drapion, or Skuntank to remedy this problem. A spinblocker is recommended to keep the hazards Nidoqueen sets up on the field. Rotom and Mismagius make great choices; Rotom can hurt Blastoise with Thunderbolt, while Mismagius can block Foresight with Taunt, and both can use Will-O-Wisp to cripple Donphan and Hitmontop.</p> <p>Nidoqueen makes a great teammate to Pokemon that can make the most of the entry hazards she sets up. Registeel and Spiritomb can take on common counters such as Haze Milotic with two layers of Toxic Spikes on the field. With poison damage increasing every turn, Milotic will have a difficult time erasing their Curse and Calm Mind boosts. Weather stall teams can also make great use of the Toxic Spikes that Nidoqueen sets up, as well as her ability to absorb them on your side of the field. Hail teams in particular enjoy Nidoqueen as a teammate, thanks to her defensive synergy with Ice-types. Nidoqueen is able to buffer Rock- and Fighting-type attacks aimed at your Ice-types, while she benefits from having an 100% accurate Blizzard, and having teammates that are able to take any Ice and Water attacks aimed at her.</p>"

  "Nidoking": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its massive movepool and key resistances to Electric-, Fighting-, and Rock-type attacks, Nidoking is able to fulfill a role on nearly any team. Although it might seem outclassed by fellow wallbreaker Blaziken, Nidoking boasts the ability to single-handily dismantle the hugely popular Fire-Water-Grass core thanks to its diverse movepool. Nidoking's typing grants it immunities to both Thunder Wave and Toxic, allowing it to switch into the likes of Registeel and Chansey with ease, which is something Blaziken cannot do. If you need a Pokemon to break through walls, revenge kill, or sweep late-game, definitely consider Nidoking for a slot on your team, as it is certainly a force to be reckoned with in the UU metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>You can utilize Nidoking's primary STAB with Sludge Bomb and Poison Jab, but the other moves listed in Nidoking's sets provide greater super effective coverage. Surf is another option, although Nidoking's Ground-type STAB paired with Ice Beam gives the same coverage, but it has its uses against Rhyperior. Dragon Pulse is another option, although with Altaria being the only common Dragon-type in UU, it is not worth running, and Ice Beam does more damage anyway. Aqua Tail's only benefit is that it can hit Moltres, which is not affected by Earthquake. Apart from that, it does not provide any good coverage and is outclassed by Earthquake. Fire Blast is a good choice on the Classic Mixed set as it can KO Venusaur, who would usually outspeed Nidoking before it can 2HKO with Ice Beam. Focus Punch, if used on the physical set, can OHKO Chansey, although it would require Nidoking to perhaps use Substitute to ensure it hits. Rivalry can provide a very welcome boost provided Nidoking is facing a male opponent, although Nidoking will have its offense dropped when facing a Pokemon of the opposite gender. However, a boosting item such as Life Orb does compensate for this somewhat. Overall, though, Poison Point is the safer ability.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Due to its massive movepool, countering Nidoking is by no means an easy task. The best way to \"counter\" it is to send in a generic wall, find out Nidoking's set and item, and work from there. Milotic is a good counter due to its impressive bulk and ability to sponge almost any attack that Nidoking is capable of throwing at it. Weezing is not weak to any of Nidoking's attacks and can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp, although it should watch out for Taunt variants. Chansey and Clefable can easily wall the special set and slowly finish it off with Seismic Toss, while the latter can actually use it as setup fodder for stacking up Calm Mind boosts. Physical sets are stopped cold by Donphan, which can easily take any of Nidoking's attacks and retaliate with STAB Earthquake. Any fast Pokemon that can use a super effective move can easily revenge kill Nidoking. Espeon is a good example, as it can Substitute to scout for Sucker Punch as well as OHKO Nidoking with STAB Psychic. Mismagius and Rotom in general aren't the best of counters, but they are immune to Nidoking's Ground-type STAB attack, and can Substitute on an incoming Sucker Punch or dismantle Nidoking with Will-O-Wisp. Positive Speed natured Venusaur can come in on various sets not running a Jolly or Timid nature and proceed to hit Nidoking with Leaf Storm or put it to sleep via Sleep Powder.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Nidoking's main attraction is its awesome type coverage, and this set abuses that coverage to the fullest, making it hard for the opponent to predict around it. The main advantage of using this set over a purely physical one is this set's ability to take care of Water- and Grass-type Pokemon with super effective assaults. The 80 Attack EVs guarantee an OHKO on Chansey with Superpower if it switches into Earth Power with Stealth Rock in play, while Pokemon such as Registeel can barely scratch Nidoking and are 2HKOed by STAB Earth Power. Ice Beam and Thunderbolt create the BoltBeam combo, which hits a good portion of the metagame for super effective damage and is only resisted by Magneton, Lanturn, and Shedinja in UU, the former two which are destroyed by Earth Power. This set is meant to be an effective wallbreaker, weakening and dismantling walls so that your late-game sweeper can sweep with ease.</p> <p>While Nidoking can easily take care of the previously mentioned walls, Nidoking is somewhat limited in breaking others because of the lack of power on the physical side. However, Nidoking makes up for that with its Speed, and with the given EVs, it outspeeds neutral natured base 80s. If you would like, you can transfer 44 Speed EVs to Attack, allowing Nidoking to effectively use Earthquake. This allows Nidoking to beat specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and Clefable, and gives it a much easier time plowing through stall teams.</p> <p>Since Nidoking can still be switched into and outsped by positive natured base 80 Pokemon, most notably Venusaur and Blaziken, defensive teammates are greatly appreciated to sponge hits for Nidoking. Venusaur is a great partner, as it can take incoming Water- and Grass-type attacks directed at Nidoking and incapacitate opposing Pokemon with Sleep Powder. Slowbro and Slowking are good teammates as well, as they can switch into Blaziken and other Fire-types with relative ease and threaten them with their Water-type STAB attacks. Entry hazards are extremely useful, as they can turn many potential 2HKOs into OHKOs for Nidoking. Uxie can set up Stealth Rock while crippling faster sweepers with Thunder Wave, allowing Nidoking to plow through the opponent's team later in the match. Nidoking attracts a lot of Ghost- and Psychic-types, so Spiritomb and Drapion are ideal partners, as they are unaffected by Psychic-type attacks and can proceed to trap and KO Ghost- and Psychic-types with Pursuit.</p>"
      },
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Nidoking fares well against most common leads, having access to both Taunt and Stealth Rock. This set focuses on setting up entry hazards while at the same time preventing slower leads from setting up any of their own. Steelix, Omastar, and Kabutops are all outsped and can be Taunted on the first turn, and then KOed by Earth Power the next; however, Kabutops usually carries Focus Sash and a priority move in Aqua Jet, so immediately attacking it with Earth Power is recommended. As mentioned above, Taunt is great not only for preventing the opposing team's entry hazards from being dispensed, but also for stopping status inducers both early- and mid-game, something most anti-leads do not have access to. Setting up Stealth Rock early in the match puts pressure on the opponent, and is a good method to reduce the presence of threats such as Moltres and Scyther. Earth Power is Nidoking's primary STAB move and enables it to effectively eliminate Omastar and Steelix leads. Ice Beam rounds off this set's coverage, boasting great synergy with Earth Power and hitting Grass-types that resist Nidoking's STAB attack for super effective damage. Toxic Spikes is an option to consider, although it is worth noting that Poison-types are quite common which would render Nidoking's Toxic Spiking attempts moot. Focus Sash allows Nidoking to deal with priority priority users such as Kabutops in a better manner and allows Nidoking to survive if you mispredict. For instance, if you Taunt Mesprit assuming it will use Stealth Rock only to be met with Psychic, you'll get a second chance to outplay your opponent.</p> <p>Spiritomb is an ideal partner, as it can switch in on leads that Nidoking has problems with, most notably Ambipom and Uxie, and set up them or Pursuit them as they attempt to switch out. Compared to Drapion, Nidoking can set up Toxic Spikes with less pressure, thanks to its ability to deal with common spinners and Poison-types that would usually switch into it to absorb Toxic Spikes. A common example of a Rapid Spin user is Donphan, who can easily switch into Drapion and proceed to spin away the entry hazards or Earthquake Drapion to oblivion. Nidoking, however, has Ice Beam, which can easily 2HKO Donphan, and Earth Power, which can annihilate common Poison-types such as Toxicroak and Drapion.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set focuses solely on Nidoking's huge special movepool. Earth Power starts off the set, scoring a KO on most Rock- and Steel-types who lack the special bulk to take an Earth Power. As stated previously, Ice Beam and Thunderbolt form the Boltbeam combo, pairing nicely and having good coverage with Earth Power, hitting a good portion of the metagame for super effective damage. The last slot features both Shadow Ball and Thunder, both of which have their advantages. Shadow Ball is a reliable means of destroying Levitators that are weak to Ghost-type moves, such as Rotom and Mismagius, while Thunder, despite its shaky accuracy, has a chance to KO Milotic if it switches into Earth Power.</p> <p>Since this set only hits from the special side, having a teammate that can remove specially defensive walls before Nidoking attempts to sweep is useful. Blaziken is a good choice, capable of destroying both Chansey and Clefable, two common walls. Pokemon with Trick are good teammates as well, crippling Pokemon that prevent Nidoking from attempting a sweep. Dugtrio, despite sharing a lot of weaknesses with Nidoking, is another excellent teammate, trapping special walls thanks to its ability and finishing them off with its STAB Earthquake. A Timid nature allows Nidoking to outspeed positive nature base 80 Speed Pokemon that would normally switch in on Nidoking and attempt to finish it off, only to find themselves at the mercy of a STAB Earth Power or Ice Beam. Fire Blast is an option to consider as it can nail Venusaur, who would usually survive an Ice Beam, but apart from that it does not have many uses.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to take advantage of Nidoking's decent Attack stat and good physical movepool. Earthquake is Nidoking's primary attack, with the rest of the set offering great type coverage. As most people would expect Nidoking to carry Earth Power, this set a good way to lure and destroy special tanks and Registeel, who usually pack few Defense EVs. Stone Edge is for Flying-types such as Altaria and Moltres; Megahorn rips through Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Leafeon, as well as severely denting Uxie and Mesprit, both of which are immune to Nidoking's STAB attacks; and Sucker Punch is a somewhat reliable priority move for taking out faster threats such as Rotom and Mismagius, although it allows Substitute Mismagius and Rotom to set up on Nidoking if the opponent predicts well. The EVs are set to maximize Nidoking's Attack and Speed, allowing it to outspeed common base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Blaziken and Venusaur and proceed to destroy them with Earthquake.</p> <p>This set is focused on taking out weakened counters and sweeping, rather than weakening and taking out walls like the mixed sets. Superpower is definitely an option to consider, as it allows Nidoking to easily dispose of Chansey and Clefable, both of whom aren't OHKOed by Earthquake. Pursuit users such as Spiritomb and Drapion can take care of Pokemon with Levitate, as the majority of them are Ghost- and Psychic-types, allowing Nidoking to sweep with Earthquake late-game. Nidoking is an excellent recipient of Swords Dance boosts, as it outspeeds a good portion of the metagame with a Jolly nature and needs the boost in its power to expand the number of targets it can OHKO. Dealing with potential revenge killers before attempting a sweep is vital. Milotic and Tangrowth can take incoming hits well and retaliate with an attack or status. Nidoking benefits from Pokemon who can take attacks from opponents who try to revenge kill it, or Pokemon who can take a hit and KO back. Milotic, Steelix, and even Regirock are threats to Nidoking, since all three are able to take an Earthquake and KO back with Surf or Earthquake, respectively. Including a Tangrowth in your team can remedy this problem as it can take Surf and Earthquake all day, while also threatening the aforementioned Pokemon with its STAB Power Whip.</p>"

  "Clefable": {
    "overview": "<p>To try to classify what exactly Clefable does is a monumental task. The reason for Clefable's greatness lies in her unique ability, Magic Guard. With Magic Guard, Clefable will only be hurt by attacking moves, which makes her a dream come true for anyone who hates stall, and a nightmare for stall users, who find their status effects and entry hazards rendered useless. Her stats may seem to leave much to be desired, but her movepool stretches out to the stars, giving her unparalleled versatility. Clefable can fill many roles, including supporting the team with Wish, sweeping with Calm Mind, wallbreaking with a mixed set, and more.</p> <p>However, despite all of Clefable's perks, she does have some major flaws that drag her down. Even Magic Guard cannot mask Clefable's rather meager stats, which ensure that Clefable will always have trouble either walling things or garnering the power to 2HKO and OHKO targets. Her Normal typing is also much more of a curse then a blessing, leaving her with nothing in the way of resistances and a weakness to Fighting-type attacks, which are popular in UU. Regardless, Clefable makes for the ultimate \"glue\" Pokemon and can fit on nearly any team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Clefable's gargantuan movepool gives her nearly endless options to play around with, allowing her to fill almost role you may need. Clefable has access to Stealth Rock, but she usually gets more mileage out of a different support move. Clefable can also pull off a Trick set with a Flame Orb to cripple many of her checks, but as with Stealth Rock, she usually has better things to do. A Belly Drum set is an interesting option considering Clefable's access to Soft-Boiled to heal off Belly Drum recoil, but Clefable will rarely find an opportunity to set it up against a good team. Clefable also has access to Healing Wish, Gravity, Cosmic Power, and Knock Off, but these options tend to be done better by other Pokemon or are just gimmicks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Clefable is very hard to counter due to the numerous different sets and moves she can run. However, there are plenty of individual counters for each set. The support and stall sets can be easily handled by almost any Fighting-type. Hariyama gets special mention due to the fact that paralysis is actually beneficial for him, as it protects him from the more debilitating burn and poison. The Calm Mind sets are a bit tougher to handle, but bulky Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Hitmontop will work well. The wallbreaker is much harder to switch into, but laying on offensive pressure will prevent it from accomplishing much. Finally, if all else fails, Perish Song can ensure that any Clefable will not accomplish anything if it's the last Pokemon.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Though she may be looked at as a poor man's Chansey, Clefable has two big notable advantages over the pink pudgy egg blob: a usable Special Attack stat and access to Encore. Unfortunately, due to the way Clefable is played, she can only take advantage of one of these perks at a time. Ice Beam is the recommended choice because it allows Clefable to break Rotom's Substitutes, as well as provide a nice hit on Torterra and Venusaur. Encore was extremely useful in the past when Ghost-types were running sets with both Substitute + Taunt, but they have now fallen out of favor and been replaced by straight-up Taunt + 3 attacks sets, making Encore somewhat useless against them. Still, Encore is an amazing tool in Clefable's arsenal that allows her to beat multiple Pokemon in UU who rely on Substitute, such as SubPerior and Substitute + Charge Beam Lanturn.</p> <p>Depending on how team-oriented you'd like Clefable to be, Soft-Boiled and Wish are both great recovery options. However, a downside to using Wish without Protect is that Clefable is unable to survive attacks that would otherwise only 3HKO it. Seismic Toss provides consistent damage to everything (excluding Ghost-types) and is the best attack Clefable has against walls like Registeel. Thunder Wave spreads paralysis and helps Clefable's Encore cripple Pokemon later in the match much more easily. Heal Bell makes Clefable more of a team supporter by ridding your sweepers of all status effects.</p> <p>The EV spread given maximizes Clefable's special walling prowess. While this may seem like a futile attempt at making Clefable as bulky as Chansey, it actually allows Clefable to handily wall various special threats, such as Life Orb Venusaur and Milotic, and eventually defeat them. A more physically defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 152 Def / 100 SpD / 4 Spe allows Clefable to more easily defeat Donphan and Rhyperior, but Clefable is much more adept at walling special threats.</p> <p>Since Clefable's main goal with this set is to wall various special threats, teammates who can capitalize on this are the best choices. Slowbro is a phenomenal Pokemon to pair with Clefable, as it patches up Clefable's sole weakness, and in return, Clefable can switch into just about any special Electric-, Ghost-, Dark-, or Grass-type attack. Many sweepers also enjoy having Clefable as a backup when the going gets rough. Feraligatr and Rhyperior both love Clefable's ability to switch into special attacks and essentially give them a second life (through Heal Bell and Wish) should their first attempt at a sweep fail.</p> <p>Since Clefable (especially with Encore) causes a lot of switches, entry hazards are a great way of racking up some free damage. Helpful Stealth Rock users include Donphan, Registeel, and Steelix. Donphan may be the best choice overall, since both of the Steel-type choices share a Fighting-type weakness with Clefable, and with Rapid Spin Hitmontop on the loose, Close Combat isn't something you want to have a weakness to. Good Spikes users include Cloyster and Omastar; again, be wary of stacking Fighting-type weaknesses. Toxic Spikes, though helpful in most other situations, isn't really welcome when Thunder Wave is part of Clefable's moveset, so it's best to omit it from your team when using this set.</p> <p>Rapid Spin users, especially Foresight Hitmontop, pretty much wreck this set. Ghost-types such as Mismagius and Spiritomb are great candidates to block Rapid Spin, though Foresight can cause problems. For this reason, it may be in your best interest to carry a speedy Pokemon with access to a Flying- or Psychic-type attack to remove Hitmontop from the equation altogether. Since Foresight will be the move you will likely switch in on, sweepers like Espeon and bulky walls like Weezing are both good choices; just be sure your counters can take a Mach Punch and stay standing, as it's a featured move on nearly every Hitmontop.</p>"
      },
      "Stall": {
        "description": "<p>Clefable is unarguably one of the best stallers in the UU metagame. This stems from her immunity to all kinds of passive damage, including entry hazards and damaging statuses such as burn and Toxic which usually cripple other walls. In addition to this, Clefable packs great overall defenses, pseudo-instant recovery in the form of Wish and Protect, and Seismic Toss to deal consistent damage against foes that can otherwise shut Clefable down with Taunt. Aside from stalling, Clefable can also provide some valuable team support via Wish and Toxic or Heal Bell. Toxic is always useful to cripple opposing walls that are difficult to beat otherwise, such as Milotic, whereas Heal Bell's ability to cure your team of status can easily prove useful against opponents who possess Pokemon that like to abuse status-inducing moves.</p> <p>Clefable's EVs are geared towards her Special Defense, as special attacking threats are easier for Clefable to deal with than physical ones. This is partially due to the fact that all the Fighting-types in UU use physical attacks and Clefable has little hope of sponging physical hits from the likes of Hitmonlee or Hariyama, whereas she is perfectly capable of taking on special attacks from the likes of Venusaur. However, a more physically defensive spread is still usable, since Clefable still has enough Defense to take on foes such as Rhyperior and Donphan, though she does a worse job than a Pokemon such as Leafeon, who boasts considerably more Defense and a super effective STAB move to take on these physical attackers with.</p> <p>There are numerous changes that can be made to this set. Cosmic Power can give Clefable more stalling power, and thanks to her immunity to dangerous statuses such as Toxic, Clefable is one of the best user of the move in the game. However, it leaves Clefable susceptible to being pseudo-hazed, and using Cosmic Power will force Clefable to drop either Seismic Toss or Toxic; losing either is not particularly desirable, as it leaves Clefable a veritable sitting duck against many foes. Without Toxic, Clefable can't stall without major support, and without Seismic Toss, she is walled by every Pokemon who is immune to Toxic, most of whom can simply take the opportunity to set up. Ice Beam is an option over Seismic Toss to hit Ghost-types, who would otherwise be able to switch into Clefable with ease and shut her down with either Substitute or Taunt, but aside from that, Seismic Toss is superior. Soft-Boiled is an option if you find that Clefable needs a less time-consuming form of recovery, or if you want both Heal Bell and Toxic on the same set, though Wish and Protect are easily superior for stalling purposes.</p> <p>Residual damage is the greatest companion to this set, bar none. Toxic Spikes in particular are a great asset, since they are the easiest way of causing poison status without wasting a moveslot. Drapion and Cloyster are both great Toxic Spikes users, though the former may be the better choice because he does not share a Fighting-type weakness with Clefable. Toxic Spikes can be absorbed by Poison-type Pokemon, so having a counter to common Poison-types such as Venusaur, Drapion, and Toxicroak is a good idea. Donphan is able to handle the latter two reliably with his STAB Earthquake and great bulk, while Arcanine or Moltres are able to defeat the ubiquitous Venusaur. Due to how much Clefable appreciates entry hazards, Ghost-types are useful to block Rapid Spin. Mismagius, Rotom, and Spiritomb are ideal Pokemon for this job; they can even use Will-O-Wisp to burn Pokemon who are immune to Toxic. Ironically, Clefable herself is walled by the former two Pokemon if they possess Taunt or Substitute, but Spiritomb makes a magnificent counter to them due to his ability to trap and KO them with Pursuit.</p> <p>Stat-boosting Pokemon tend to give Clefable trouble as well; due to her poor offensive prowess (Seismic Toss just doesn't cut it against many foes), many Pokemon can set up with ease. RestTalk Calm Mind Uxie, for example, will take little damage from Seismic Toss and will be able to set up several Calm Minds before Resting away Toxic and any accumulated damage. To deal with such foes, pseudo-hazers and Haze Milotic are the best options, the latter possessing monstrous defenses and a great typing for taking on most stat-boosting threats. Defensive Venusaur is a fantastic phazer, as he can check a multitude of different threats depending on whether he is physically defensive or specially defensive. Specially defensive Venusaur can take on Mismagius and Rotom, not really minding burns thanks to Heal Bell support from Clefable, while physically defensive Venusaur can check Rhyperior and Feraligatr. In addition to this, phazers can also take advantage of the entry hazards that Clefable enjoys, since they can shuffle the opposing team around to rack up residual damage.</p>"

      "Life Orb + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Clefable is one of the most dangerous and overlooked threats for defensive teams in UU. Unlike most Calm Mind sweepers, Clefable has solid physical bulk and lacks easily exploitable weaknesses. In addition, Magic Guard grants Clefable an immunity to entry hazard and poison damage, rendering the majority of a stall team's strategy ineffective. To top it all off, an instant recovery move in Soft-Boiled means that even whittling down Clefable's health through repeated weak attacks is not an option.</p> <p>Calm Mind and Soft-Boiled form the core of the set, allowing Clefable to set up on weaker attackers while recovering lost health. Thunderbolt and Ice Beam are the preferred attacking moves, since together they hit every Pokemon in UU with the exception of Lanturn, Magneton, and Shedinja for at least neutral damage. Lanturn and Magneton are setup bait for Clefable anyway, while Shedinja is rarely seen and easily disposed of with Stealth Rock. In addition, Thunderbolt and Ice Beam provide vital super effective coverage against key threats. Thunderbolt zaps Milotic and its fellow Water-types, while Ice Beam nails Ground- and Grass-types, such as Donphan, Rhyperior, and Venusaur.</p> <p>A Modest nature and 252 Special Attack EVs maximize Clefable's offensive potential. 96 Speed EVs put it at 180 Speed, allowing it to outpace Adamant Rhyperior. The remaining EVs are dumped into HP to capitalize on Clefable's natural bulk. If you're concerned about outpacing Milotic, using 172 Speed EVs beats minimum Speed variants, but adding a few additional EVs may be a good idea since Milotic tend to invest slightly in Speed. Unfortunately, Clefable does not have a STAB special attack that it can use. However, there are a few alternatives to the moves suggested. Using Psychic instead of Ice Beam allows Clefable to hit Hitmontop super effectively while retaining power against Venusaur. Alternatively, Toxic can replace Thunderbolt to defeat Haze Milotic; in this case, Ice Beam is preferred as the sole attacking option because no Pokemon is immune to it.</p> <p>There aren't many Pokemon who can reliably stop Calm Mind Clefable, especially on defensive teams, which means luring and weakening the few checks that exist can result in an easy sweep. Haze Milotic will erase Clefable's boosts before Clefable can hit it with Thunderbolt. However, Milotic usually loses in the long run, as the eventuality of paralysis or critical hit will put the odds heavily in Clefable's favor. Stall teams can pair Milotic with Aromatherapy Chansey to PP stall Clefable. To avoid this, it's best to weaken Milotic to 50% HP to prevent it from countering Clefable; if it tries to Haze at that health, Thunderbolt will KO, while if it tries to Recover, +1 Thunderbolt will deal far more damage than it can heal. Many Pokemon, including physical Blaziken, Passho Berry Houndoom, and Choice Band Azumarill, can adequately weaken Milotic. However, a cleaner way to get rid of it is with a lure packing Explosion, such as Steelix or Curse Registeel. Keep in mind that using these recklessly may not be successful since they also lure in Omastar and Cloyster seeking to set up Spikes. Explosion lures are also a good way to eliminate Rapid Spin Hitmontop; Regirock is the best such lure due to its high Attack stat, Clear Body, and its ability to outpace defensive Hitmontop. Pokemon with Choice items and Trick can cripple Clefable, but simply predicting and switching Clefable out for another Pokemon will neutralize the threat. Additionally, since most Trick users are Ghost- or Psychic-type, a Pursuit user such as Houndoom or Drapion can eliminate them with ease.</p> <p>Beyond using Pokemon with super effective Fighting-type attacks, the easiest way for offensive teams to deal with Clefable is to have one Pokemon batter Clefable so that it cannot set up and have a second finish it off. Since these attackers rely on their high Speed to hit Clefable first, paralysis support helps Clefable a lot, particularly against special attackers. When Clefable can use Calm Mind before it is hit with a special attack, it can set up against a much larger range of Pokemon.</p>"

      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<p>It seems ridiculous to think that Clefable could pull off a wallbreaker set when there are offensive behemoths available like Blaziken, who sports 120/110 attacking stats in comparison to Clefable's rather meager 70/85. However, with Magic Guard negating the recoil from Life Orb and Double-Edge, and Soft-Boiled to heal off any damage that Clefable sustains, Clefable is an almost perfect wallbreaker. Double-Edge plows through special walls like Chansey, managing a guaranteed 2HKO even without entry hazards. Fire Blast roasts Grass- and Steel-types like Venusaur and Registeel, while Grass Knot trips up Rhyperior and Slowbro. Soft-Boiled keeps Clefable in tip-top shape so she can continue to break down the opposing team.</p> <p>The EVs offer maximum Attack and Special Attack, while the Quiet nature preserves Clefable's good bulk. A Toxic Orb can be used in place of Life Orb, and Facade in place of Double-Edge, to obtain immunity to status, but this means that there will be a significant drop in power. Psychic is usable if you need the ability to lure in and pummel Fighting-types, but the loss of coverage means Clefable will be walled by far more Pokemon than Psychic will cover.</p> <p>As with every other set, Clefable enjoys entry hazard support to help her garner 2HKOs on the majority of UU's walls. The two best choices for teammates to set up Stealth Rock are Claydol and Donphan, both of whom can also remove any entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Donphan can strike opponents back with a powerful STAB Earthquake, revenge threats with Ice Shard, and Roar to abuse entry hazards. Claydol, on the other hand, offers Levitate, ensuring that it won't be worn down as easily, a valuable resistance to Fighting-type attacks, and much better Special Defense. Spikes can be set up by either Omastar or Cloyster; both are weak to Fighting-type attacks, however, so having something to take these assaults will help. Either Uxie or Spiritomb will work excellently here; Uxie can set up Stealth Rock if you don't want the extra Grass weakness that Claydol and Donphan bring, while Spiritomb can easily switch in on Fighting-types and burn them with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Although Clefable has the reputation of slicing through stall like a hot knife through butter, there are still some Pokemon commonly used on stall teams that give it trouble. Hitmontop is the greatest threat to Clefable, with Intimidate to help it weather Double-Edge and the ability to outspeed and obliterate Clefable with Close Combat. Hariyama is another check, but he runs the risk of being 2HKOed by Double-Edge with Spikes support. Spiritomb is also a huge problem for Clefable, as Fire Blast is only a 3HKO, and Pressure will stall out Fire Blast's PP with ease. Spiritomb can even Will-O-Wisp to ruin Clefable's Attack if she isn't using Toxic Orb. Specially defensive Milotic can stall Grass Knot with Recover, although a timely critical hit will destroy it. An easy way of handling these counters is to run Toxic Spikes. This will allow Clefable to defeat Milotic without a critical hit, force Spiritomb to eventually Rest, and limit the amount of times Hitmontop and Hariyama can switch in. Drapion works quite well in this regard, as he can abosrb Toxic Spikes and lay down his own. Drapion can also take on Mismagius, another Ghost-type who can give Clefable some trouble.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>This set is infamous for dismantling stall teams because of its powerful boosting move, Calm Mind, coupled with immunities to entry hazards and Toxic. Since stall teams rely primarily on residual damage to defeat opposing Pokemon, their attacking moves are almost always backed by zero EV investment and are consequently most efficient at chipping down frail Pokemon that lack recovery. However, Clefable is neither frail, nor does she lack a reliable recovery move. By alternating Calm Mind with Soft-Boiled, Clefable is able to insolently set up right in the face of common defensive Pokemon like Milotic, Chansey, Weezing, and Donphan. Once she reaches +6/+6, she can use the almost-perfect coverage granted by Ice Beam and Thunderbolt to calmly pick apart the opposing team.</p> <p>Although the offensive and defensive Calm Mind sets appear very similar, their playstyles are assuredly distinct from each other. Most notably, the defensive EV spread and presence of Leftovers (instead of a Life Orb) make this set much more resilient, allowing it to shrug off weak attacks more easily. This makes Clefable more suited for taking on heavy stall teams, since she won't have to use Soft-Boiled as often, making it much harder to PP stall. It also means that the set fits better on a defensively-minded team itself, because the additional bulk means Clefable can provide some defensive support without losing too much HP (which would compromise her ability to successfully set up later). For example, the HP investment and Leftovers allows defensive Calm Mind Clefable to take on Charge Beam users, such as Lanturn and Rotom, with greater ease.</p> <p>Of course, there is a tradeoff to going defensive. The lack of Speed EVs means Clefable cannot hope to beat slow heavy-hitters like Azumarill or Rhyperior, who can finish off a slightly weakened Clefable with powerful Choice Band-boosted attacks. Without Special Attack EVs or a Life Orb, Clefable's non-STAB attacks are mere trifles until she is able to boost up with Calm Mind. As a result, she doesn't perform as well against bulky defensive teams, which usually carry a few checks who must be worn down with repeated Thunderbolt or Ice Beam on the switch. It takes much longer to wear down these checks without any Special Attack investment or a Life Orb.</p> <p>The EV spread on this set is self-explanatory. HP and Defense are maximized with a Bold nature so Clefable can take as many hits as possible, while the last 4 EVs are put in Special Defense. Since Clefable has Calm Mind to boost her Special Defense, Defense is prioritized. However, investing in Special Defense makes Clefable a much better answer to threats like Charge Beam Rotom and special attacking Venusaur. A few EVs can be put into Speed to allow Clefable to outspeed Donphan and Azumarill who invest just enough to outpace 0 Speed Clefable, but this isn't reliable, and it's not a guarantee that Clefable will actually be faster.</p> <p>Clefable can't set up against Roar/Whirlwind users like Steelix and Hariyama, especially if they have Wish support from Chansey or opposing Clefable. In a last Pokemon situation, Clefable doesn't fear being phazed out, but Perish Song from Mismagius or Altaria will spell doom. Stall Hitmontop gives Clefable a hard time due to his high Special Defense and STAB Close Combat or Revenge. Milotic can use Haze to erase Clefable's Calm Minds, but it's worth noting that the chance of a Thunderbolt paralysis followed by Milotic being fully paralyzed makes this specific match-up particularly favorable for Clefable. The best way to weaken specific stall Pokemon is heavily battle- and team-dependent, but a generally good idea is to use lures and trappers. Swords Dance Brick Break Scyther significantly dents Steelix, Pursuit Houndoom takes out Stall Mismagius, and Nasty Plot Passho Berry Houndoom weakens or KOes Milotic. Although these lures are nifty tricks, thinking about the team match-up in a battle and forcing the opponent to use specific Pokemon to defend against your other threats is the best way to weaken a defensive pillar.</p>"

      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>Clefable, due to her immense special bulk and amazing ability, has many chances to come in and set up dual screens. What separates Clefable from other dual screen users is her access to Wish and a wide variety of support moves, which most dual screen users lack. While Soft-Boiled is the more reliable healing move, Wish can help your other teammates immensely by restoring 50% of their health as they switch in. If keeping Clefable fully functional isn't a concern to you, then Encore can be used to ruin opposing Pokemon trying to set up on her. Seismic Toss is there so that Clefable isn't complete Taunt bait, and it's your best option to deal a respectable amount of damage to a wide variety of foes. Ice Beam is also an option to get a good hit on Ghost-types, but since Clefable's main focus with this set is to support a sweeper on your team, this isn't a large concern.</p> <p>The EV spread is designed to give Clefable as much special bulk as possible. Light Clay is the recommended item as it gives the dual screens eight turns in play instead of five, thus giving Clefable's teammates more time to wreak havoc. Because Clefable is more specially defensive, setting up Reflect first is generally the best move to make. However, it ultimately comes down to whichever Pokemon the opponent has in play at the time Clefable is ready to start setting up the dual screens.</p> <p>The best teammates to pair with Clefable are those who can capitalize the most from having dual screens in play. Normally frail sweepers, such as Charizard and Belly Drum Linoone, suddenly become difficult to take down when behind the appropriate screen, which can easily turn the tide of battle. Another strategy to use is to pair Clefable with already bulky Pokemon who take a couple of turns to get completely set-up in order to sweep. An example of this is Tangrowth, who, if not on a team based around Sunny Day, needs to set up both Sunny Day and Swords Dance in order to sweep. The added bulk from dual screens can give Tangrowth the extra time he needs to fully set up and rip the opposing team to shreds.</p> <p>Clefable will generally have trouble against Pokemon that have access to powerful Fighting-type moves. Hitmonlee and Hariyama can threaten Clefable with Close Combat and Force Palm, respectively, making Mismagius and Spiritomb excellent partners. They are both immune to Fighting-type attacks and have access to Calm Mind, making it much easier to boost their stats when dual screens are in play. Opposing Ghost-types can walk right into Seismic Toss and start boosting their stats, but Clefable is able to Encore them if they do so, which gives you a good chance of setting up screens.</p>"
      },
      "Lv. 2 Endeavor (F.E.A.R)": {
        "description": "<p>Generally, FEAR sets are shunned as being nothing but gimmicks due to the wide use of Stealth Rock. Clefable, however, manages to break the mold with Magic Guard. The idea behind this set is simple: switch Clefable in on a non-damaging move or after something on your team has been KOed, survive a hit with Focus Sash, and then Endeavor. This set is meant to be used with sandstorm, hail, or Toxic Spikes, which will finish off the opponent at the end of the turn. Even if the opposing Pokemon happens to be immune to your weather of choice, entry hazards will ensure that the fatally crippled Pokemon won't be able to do much of anything for the rest of the match.</p> <p>Every move other than Endeavor is really filler at best, but can prove marginally useful. Protect can scout Fake Out and sleep inducing moves, while Encore can be useful if the opponent is spamming a recovery move. Thunder Wave can hit any Mismagius who think they can get a free switch in, while Toxic will heavily cripple any Spiritomb who tries to come in. If you want to achieve maximum rage from your opponent, using Trick Room with weather will ensure two KOs, and it's also possible to run Cleffa and Clefairy alongside Clefable to get 3 KOs at worst.</p> <p>Clefable's biggest problem is Ghost-types who are immune to Endeavor, so having partners to handle them is the most important thing to consider. Pursuit users are valuable to help get rid of Mismagius and Rotom. Spiritomb is the best option due to his solid defenses and the ability to play mind games with Sucker Punch and Pursuit. Absol and Houndoom are also viable if you want more power, but their lower defenses make them less reliable. Opposing Spiritomb is a bit harder to eliminate, but powerful attackers such as Blaziken can handily deal with it.</p>"

  "Wigglytuff": {
    "overview": "<p>If there's a single word that describes Wigglytuff, it's \"outclassed\". While her movepool is titanic and chock full of marvelous moves, her relatively poor stats and Normal typing hinder her. Her huge HP stat is dwarfed by her horrendous base defenses, and her mediocre offensive stats hinder her from doing much damage outside of Seismic Toss. Being a Normal-type, Wigglytuff also has to compete with numerous other Pokemon that boast massive movepools, and most of the time, they'll have better stats all around, as well as a couple of other nifty moves that Wigglytuff misses out on. However, one shouldn't discount Wigglytuff immediately; with her particularly large support movepool, she can be quite an effective supporter, despite how outclassed she is in that role. In the end, know that Wigglytuff is not a truly bad Pokemon; she's just so horribly outclassed that it's hard to justify using her over any of the other viable Normal-types in UU, and even NU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With a titanic movepool, Wigglytuff has plenty of other options that she can use with some success. As far as alternative support moves go, Wigglytuff has access to Sing, Knock Off, Sweet Kiss, and even Charm. With her nice bulk, she can use the effects of all of these moves to an extent. However, for most of these moves, they're either too unreliable, or have effects that aren't as good as the other support options that Wigglytuff has access to. Wigglytuff also makes a respectable user of Gravity, with plenty of moves that benefit from it such as Sing, Fire Blast, Thunder, and Blizzard. However, with mediocre offenses, she fails to be outstanding at abusing it offensively, while her defenses also aren't quite good enough to continually switch into attacks to set it up. Perish Song would be a fantastic move to use on Wigglytuff; however, the fact that it's incompatible with Wish makes it a less-than-stellar option. Fake Tears and Tickle are options to potentially cause switches and soften up opposing Pokemon, but are poor options in general. With Wigglytuff's huge HP stat and low defensive stats, she makes a respectable user of Counter, though unfortunately, her lack of a one-turn recovery move, and low Speed make it difficult for her to pull it off continually and makes it really only worth it for the surprise value.</p> <p>Physically, Wigglytuff has plenty of options to abuse. Return, Focus Punch, Ice Punch, Thunder Punch, and Fire Punch are just a small portion of the physical attacks that Wigglytuff has access to. Because of this, Wigglytuff can make a decent abuser of a Choice Band or physical Life Orb set, though her mediocre Attack stat prevents this from being a great option. Specially, Wigglytuff has even more options, boasting strong attacks such as Hyper Voice, Ice Beam, ThunderBolt, Fire Blast, and Grass Knot to give a basic idea of how diverse her movepool is on the special side. Like on the physical side, Wigglytuff can use a Choice Specs or a Life Orb set with decent success. Unlike the physical side however, Wigglytuff has access to a boosting move in Charge Beam, which, while not particularly amazing, can help bolster her barely acceptable Special Attack. You could also try to mix some of her physical and special options to turn Wigglytuff into a mixed attacker; however, despite the astounding coverage that Wigglytuff would have with this kind of set, it's still easy to wall due to Wigglytuff's poor offenses.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Wigglytuff's defenses, while decent, are not really top-notch, and strong attackers such as Aggron, Hitmonlee, and Rhyperior should be able to break through them with ease. In particular, Fighting-types work well, as they immediately threaten Wigglytuff with their strong, super effective STAB attacks. However, if Wigglytuff is carrying a status move such as Toxic or Thunder Wave, you will want to use Pokemon that won't have issues with these lest you have a crippled Pokemon on your hands. If Wigglytuff is using Toxic, Venusaur makes a great counter. Swords Dance variants can set up on her easily, while support sets can abuse her huge HP stat with Leech Seed. If Thunder Wave is used, Rhyperior works well, having the ability to set up on her with either Swords Dance or Rock Polish, and threatening her from the get-go with his monstrous Attack stat. Substitute users such as Mismagius and Rotom can block her attempts to status them and can proceed to set up. Taunt will also stop Wigglytuff in her tracks, as most of the time, her best form of offense will be Seismic Toss.</p>",

        "description": "<p>When it comes to defensive Normal-types, Wigglytuff definitely isn't a popular choice in UU, as she is horribly outclassed by Clefable, Chansey, and Lickilicky. However, with useful support moves in Wish, Heal Bell, and Thunder Wave, as well as passable defenses, Wigglytuff can still be fairly effective in that role.</p> <p>Wish is a fantastic move to heal weakened teammates with, and provides valuable team support. Protect can scout for troublesome moves, and alongside Wish, forms a means of reliable recovery that allows Wigglytuff to stick around for quite some time. Seismic Toss is Wigglytuff's best form of offense against most foes, and, while it doesn't do amazing damage, it is the best option Wigglytuff has in that regard (while Wigglytuff's STAB move, Hyper Voice, might seem better, it really only does more damage against frail Pokemon like Sceptile). The last slot depends on what kind of support you need for your team. Heal Bell is a useful option if your team is vulnerable to status, while Toxic and Thunder Wave cripple walls and sweepers, respectively. However, if you lack a Pokemon with Stealth Rock, Wigglytuff can use it in the last slot instead.</p> <p>Because Wigglytuff has such a massive HP stat, investing in her defensive stats first will increase her defensive ability much more than a normal spread. Wigglytuff's EVs, in general, are also slightly biased to her Special Defense stat, to allow her to better take on Pokemon from the special side, who she has an easier time dealing with than physical threats. 44 HP EVs hit a Leftovers number, which further helps Wigglytuff's cause, while the rest are poured into her physical Defense to cushion against lighter physical blows.</p> <p>Bulky Pokemon, such as Blastoise, Hitmontop, and Spiritomb, who lack reliable recovery, work well alongside this Wigglytuff set, as the Wish support she provides can allow these Pokemon to continue doing their duties for a prolonged time. Additionally, Wish can allow certain sweepers such as Mismagius and Hitmonlee to come back in and wreak even more havoc. Depending on the support move in the last slot, the Pokemon that Wigglytuff can assist will vary. For example, if Heal Bell is used, Pokemon who detest certain status effects, such as Milotic, Moltres, and Hitmonlee are great partners. If Thunder Wave is used, Pokemon who can take advantage of the opponent's slower team such as Rhyperior, Aggron, and Hariyama work well. Finally, if Toxic is used, Pokemon who appreciate crippled walls work well alongside Wigglytuff.</p>"

        "description": "<p>While Wigglytuff would seem to be another generic dual screen user, her large support movepool enables her to stand out amongst the sea of possible options. Boasting access to extremely helpful moves in Wish, Heal Bell, and Stealth Rock, and plenty of bulk to use both screens and her support options, Wigglytuff can prove to be an effective user indeed.</p> <p>Reflect and Light Screen help bolster Wigglytuff's mediocre defenses. Stealth Rock support is very important, as some sweepers, such as Belly Drum Linoone, just barely miss out on some necessary KOs against some Pokemon at full health; thus, Stealth Rock is essential to allow these Pokemon to nab these KOs. The last slot depends on what you feel your sweeper will appreciate the most. Heal Bell's ability to cure status can help your sweeper later in the match if your sweeper had been burned or paralyzed earlier. However, Wish can essentially give sweepers a second chance to sweep under screens, and can also help get a frailer Pokemon into the match. Wish also gives Wigglytuff some more longevity to use Light Screen and Reflect with. If you feel that your desired sweeper doesn't need either support option, Seismic Toss is an option to do decent damage and prevent Wigglytuff from being rendered completely useless by Taunt.</p> <p>The EV spread is designed to help Wigglytuff take both physical and special hits well, and because of Wigglytuff's significantly higher HP stat, it's better to invest in her defenses first. A Calm nature is used to increase Wigglytuff's Special Defense, making it easier for her to use both screens against specially offensive Pokemon who she generally has an easier time dealing with.</p> <p>Pokemon who can quickly set up and sweep are great partners to this set, as, due to the screens that Wigglytuff will set up, it won't be hard to get a boost or two at all. Rock Polish Aggron, Rhyperior, and Nasty Plot Mismagius are all extremely powerful after they have set up, and are more than capable of ripping teams apart. Belly Drum users are useful to consider as well; the dual screens that Wigglytuff provides should hopefully be enough to allow them to Belly Drum up safely. However, be aware that using a Pokemon with Belly Drum is a huge risk; if the opponent has a Pokemon that can do more than 50% under screens (depending on the Pokemon, the difficulty of obtaining this can vary), then the Belly Drum user will not be able to set up, and if that's your game plan, it will significantly jeopardize your chances of winning. Thus, you may want to consider carrying more than one set-up sweeper; if one of them falls somehow, then you still have a chance to sweep with the other. Additionally, you can use one of your sweepers to lure out a troublesome Pokemon that the other has difficulty with and weaken it, allowing your other sweeper to plow past it and successfully sweep.</p>"

  "Vileplume": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Vileplume seems to be absolutely inferior to Venusaur. She shares the same great typing yet loses out on a multitude of movepool options (namely, Power Whip, Leaf Storm, Earthquake, and Roar) and possesses poorer base stats (barring Defense, every base stat is less than or equal to Venusaur's). However, the little rafflesia still has a few advantages over Venusaur--most notably, Aromatherapy. Aromatherapy differentiates Vileplume from Venusaur and gives her the ability to function as a sturdy cleric with some special bulk. Like Venusaur, Vileplume also gets the valuable Sleep Powder, and somewhat reliable recovery in Moonlight.</p> <p>Vileplume's main problem is that she is easily walled by Pokemon with a decent amount of special bulk. While such Pokemon do not stop Vileplume from accomplishing her main job as a cleric, they can simply set up against her while she struggles to damage them. In addition, Vileplume has an extremely shallow offensive movepool, as the only special moves she has are Grass- and Poison-type moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Vileplume has a few interesting moves in her very limited arsenal. Stun Spore and Teeter Dance could be used to run a parafusion set that hinders the opponent's ability to fight back. However, such a set is better in the hands of Lanturn, who can do the same but with Thunder Wave, which is 100% accurate. Toxic aids Vileplume in combating Milotic, although Energy Ball already does sufficient damage to her. Charm can be used to lower the Attack of physical sweepers, but has limited usefulness due to Vileplume's low Speed.</p> <p>Vileplume's offensive options are extremely few in number. Grass Knot is an interesting option, doing more damage to Rhyperior, Milotic, Donphan, and Regirock than Energy Ball. However, it loses much of its power against lighter threats, particularly Omastar and Azumarill. Vileplume can choose to run a physical set (with Body Slam and Seed Bomb as her attacking options), but it lacks much power and has poor coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Most of Vileplume's counters do not take away her ability to heal her teammates, but instead force her out with their STAB moves. Fire- and Flying-types such as Arcanine and Swellow fall under this category; however, these Pokemon must all watch out and be careful not to switch into Leech Seed or Sleep Powder. Vileplume also has problems with Pokemon who enjoy setting up on weak attackers. Calm Mind Mismagius and mono-attacking Registeel and Spiritomb take little damage from Vileplume's attacks and can bypass Sleep Powder by using Substitute and Sleep Talk, respectively. However, these Pokemon also do not enjoy being struck by Leech Seed.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Vileplume's main purpose is to heal her teammates of status by using Aromatherapy. While Meganium first appears to be a better candidate for the job due to her superior defenses and access to Reflect and Light Screen, Vileplume avoids being outclassed due to her secondary Poison-typing and access to Sleep Powder. Energy Ball allows Vileplume to take a chunk of health from bulky Water- and Ground-types, while Sludge Bomb aids Vileplume in defeating Sceptile, who could otherwise set up Swords Dance or Substitute, and Venusaur, who takes pitiful damage from Energy Ball. The last moveslot is up to personal choice. Moonlight is Vileplume's only instant-recovery move, but it is troubled by poor PP in comparison to other instant-recovery moves. In addition, its recovery has the unfortunate side effect of being halved under rain, hail, or sandstorm. Leech Seed is an alternate form of recovery that enables Vileplume to serve as an acceptable annoyer. Sleep Powder allows Vileplume to essentially remove one of the opponent's Pokemon from play if it does not have Sleep Talk, Natural Cure, or the rare Insomnia.</p> <p>The given EVs are used to ensure that Vileplume has as much special bulk as possible. Alternatively, a spread of 252 HP / 184 SpD / 72 Spe can be used in order to outspeed Life Orb Moltres in the sun and put it to sleep if Sunny Day teams are a major problem for your team. In addition, such a spread allows Vileplume to outspeed base 55s and 50s who do not invest EVs in Speed, such as Donphan, Registeel, and Omastar.</p> <p>While many of Vileplume's counters do not stop her from healing her teammates, their super effective STAB moves usually pose a threat to her. Fire-types such as Moltres, Arcanine, and Blaziken all have little trouble defeating Vileplume. In the same vein as Arcanine, Swellow also has little trouble KOing Vileplume, even boasting immunity to status after his Toxic or Flame Orb comes into effect. Arcanine herself is a great check to all of these Pokemon, as she possesses Flash Fire to absorb Fire-type attacks aimed at Vileplume and can threaten Swellow with Extreme Speed, forcing him to either switch and endure Stealth Rock damage, or take a hefty chunk of damage from Extreme Speed. Bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Milotic also take little damage from Fire-type moves and can hit back hard with STAB Water-type moves.</p> <p>Calm Mind Mismagius, Calm Mind Spiritomb, and Curse Registeel are also solid counters to Vileplume, mostly due to the fact that they do not fear either of Vileplume's STAB moves and can set up with impunity. Again, Arcanine proves to be a good teammate due to her ability to defeat Registeel, Mismagius, and Spiritomb by hitting them with Flare Blitz. Dugtrio is also very good at removing Registeel, as he traps and 2HKOes it with his STAB Earthquake.</p>"

  "Poliwrath": {
    "overview": "<p>Poliwrath has a very unique and valuable typing, resisting Dark-, Rock-, Ice-, and Fire-type attacks, which are all very common types in the UU metagame, not to mention that it's capable of absorbing Water-type attacks for 25% HP recovery. Poliwrath has no big flaws stat-wise, but this balance is also what kills it as a potential standard. Usually, Pokemon need to hit hard or take hits really well to be very successful, but in this case, Poliwrath is more of a middleman. If you put its EVs where its purposes lie, it will certainly pull its weight for you in a standard team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Payback can be used to hit bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types, such as Uxie and Mismagius, who can cause trouble for Poliwrath in some cases. Body Slam isn't a bad option as it has a chance to cause paralysis which can help Poliwrath in terms of outspeeding crippled enemies, not to mention that it works well in conjunction with Waterfall because of the flinch rate. Counter can potentially gain a surprise KO on a physical attacker that doesn't see it coming, while Endeavor is a decent option to surprise your opponent once Poliwrath is at low health.</p> <p>You may choose to use a Speed IV of 30 in order to move after opposing Poliwrath. That way, you are able to set up a Substitute and fire off Focus Punch safely. However, this is not necessary due to the fact that the only effective move Poliwrath can use against you is Brick Break, which isn't the primary option on most of Poliwrath's sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Poliwrath can generally be walled by any bulky Pokemon who resists or takes neutral damage from its attacks. Bulky Psychic-types are Poliwrath's biggest counters, as they have great physical bulk, resistances to Fighting-type attacks, and access to super effective STAB Psychics that will easily end Poliwrath. Slowbro is Poliwrath's number one counter, boasting a resistance to both of Poliwrath's STAB attacks and takes pathetic damage from its other moves. Uxie is a great counter, shrugging off almost anything Poliwrath throws at it, and striking back for heavy damage with Psychic or Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Venusaur, Leafeon, and Tangrowth are Pokemon who can cause Poliwrath a ton of grief. The former resists both of Poliwrath's STAB moves, has access to Sleep Powder, and can destroy Poliwrath with Leaf Storm, while the latter two pack excellent physical bulk and a hard-hitting Leaf Blade and Power Whip, respectively. Jumpluff, although nowhere near as bulky as the aforementioned Grass-types, can switch into either of Poliwrath's STAB or set up moves, such as Waterfall or Substitute, and can Encore it to force Poliwrath to switch out.</p> <p>Dusclops and Spiritomb can both burn Poliwrath with Will-O-Wisp, draining its effectiveness instantly, unless Poliwrath uses Rest. Weezing pulls off the same role as Dusclops and Spiritomb, except it can also hit Poliwrath with a super effective Thunderbolt. Milotic's great physical bulk and access to Recover and a super effective Hidden Power to Poliwrath can end it reasonably fast as well; it also has access to Haze to get rid of Poliwrath's Bulk Ups.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "SubPunch": {
        "description": "<p>Poliwrath is one of the bulkiest Fighting-types available and also has the benefit of having a secondary STAB in Water to work with. Basically, the strategy of this set is to send Poliwrath into something that it can force out, such as Registeel or Regirock, and set up a Substitute. Your next move would depend on your opponent's switch-in.</p> <p>This set has many viable options to go in the last two slots. The choice between Waterfall and Ice Punch is indeed a tough selection; Waterfall grants decent coverage and STAB, while Ice Punch provides much better super effective type coverage against Pokemon like Altaria and Venusaur. However, both can be used if you are not a fan of Encore, Bulk Up, or Hypnosis. Encore is an excellent move for Poliwrath to use, as it gives it an opportunity to Encore a move like Iron Head from Registeel or Wish from Chansey, allowing Poliwrath to score a free Substitute. Bulk Up allows Poliwrath to set up on weaker physical attackers, such as Regirock and Steelix. It also helps Poliwrath make unbreakable Substitutes on the physical side and OHKO a good portion of the metagame with its powerful STAB Focus Punch. Hypnosis, although not mentioned, is great to hit Pokemon like Slowbro or Venusaur who resist both of Poliwrath's STAB moves. It's a great way to temporarily take Poliwrath's counters out of the game, although the 60% accuracy may be risky. If these three options seem unappealing, Ice Punch can take their place.</p> <p>With Pokemon such as Slowbro, Uxie, and other bulky Psychic-types taking very little damage from Poliwrath's STAB attacks and dealing decent damage back to Poliwrath with their STAB Psychics, Poliwrath is going to need help from certain Pokemon to work more effectively. Absol and Drapion are great partners for Poliwrath, both being immune to Psychic and having Pursuit, Crunch, or Night Slash to deal with these Pokemon. Registeel works especially well because it takes minimal damage from Electric-type attacks, and resists Grass-, Flying-, and Psychic-type attacks aimed at Poliwrath, while also setting up Stealth Rock.</p>"
      },
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>Poliwrath can be a very dangerous bulky sweeper, setting up on many Pokemon while also being able to render many Pokemon helpless with Hypnosis. With a couple of Bulk Ups under its belt, Poliwrath becomes a formidable physical tank, being able to take hits and dish out hard ones as well.</p> <p>The choice between STAB and coverage is always a tough choice for Poliwrath. Ice Punch hits Pokemon such as Venusaur and Altaria hard, as they resist both of Poliwrath's STAB moves, but Brick Break hits any Pokemon who isn't weak to Ice Punch harder. Return is a solid choice as well, as it grants perfect coverage with Waterfall; however, Brick Break and Ice Punch hit many more targets for super effective damage. The last slot is best used as a utility move for Poliwrath, taking advantage of placing a counter to sleep, stopping a potential set-up, or blocking status and critical hits. Hypnosis lets Poliwrath immobilize one of its common switch-ins, such as Slowbro or Uxie, keeping it away from the battle for a decent amount of turns. You can then bring in a counter without taking damage in the process. With Encore, Pokemon like Curse Registeel, Quagsire, or Gastrodon are no longer threats, because Poliwrath can Encore them as they use Curse, forcing them to switch out as Poliwrath uses Bulk Up. Substitute blocks dangerous status, such as Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, and Bulk Up can help make physically unbreakable Substitutes.</p> <p>Poliwrath is unable to sweep with its counters in the way, similar to the SubPunch set. Slowbro and friends come back again, taking little damage from any attack and fighting back with their STAB Psychics. So as they return to the fray, so do Absol and Drapion, who are able to drill these Pokemon with strong Dark-type attacks or trap them with Pursuit. Blaziken and Magmortar also work well with Poliwrath because they can lure and take out Pokemon such as Slowbro with their strong super effective special attacks.</p>"
      },
      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<p>Outside of Water Absorb, Poliwrath has no way of restoring a reasonable amount of health by itself, but with the RestTalk set, Poliwrath now has a decently reliable way of gaining its health back. Sporting decent defensive stats, Poliwrath can be a viable user of the RestTalk combo, allowing it to become a tough tank and a great status absorber. Although, as with every RestTalk set, there will always be downsides. In this case, Poliwrath loses its rather decent Attack stat, becoming very weak on the attacking side and therefore turning into perfect set-up bait for Pokemon such as Feraligatr and Mismagius.</p> <p>The moveset is pretty standard for Poliwrath, since using both of its STAB attacks, Waterfall and Brick Break, provides near perfect coverage, only resisted by Altaria, Slowbro, Venusaur, and Toxicroak in UU (you can use Ice Punch as an alternative option for dealing neutral or super effective damage against some these Pokemon if they cause trouble). Body Slam is another interesting option that may paralyze the opposing Pokemon. As stated before, Poliwrath's poor Attack stat with the given EVs can be solved by equipping a Life Orb, enabling it to deal slightly more damage than usual. If you want to keep Poliwrath as a bulky tank, Leftovers is the superior option as it allows for more survivability.</p> <p>It would be a very good idea to eliminate the opponent's stat boosting Pokemon, since they can easily switch in on Poliwrath with little to no fear and proceed to set up something nasty. Common examples of these Pokemon are Dragon Dance Feraligatr, Nasty Plot Mismagius, and Swords Dance Drapion. Spiritomb and Weezing are decent answers to stat boosters, being able to switch in on them and threaten them with Will-O-Wisp. It should also be mentioned that physically defensive Pokemon, such as Weezing and Milotic, can easily rub off anything Poliwrath fires out at them, leaving Poliwrath vulnerable to a stall match. Venusaur can pose an immediate threat to Milotic, being able to OHKO it with Leaf Storm or put it to sleep with Sleep Powder. Venusaur and Poliwrath also make a great combo, as Venusaur can switch into Electric attacks fired at Poliwrath, while Poliwrath can sponge Fire- and Ice-type attacks thrown at Venusaur.</p>"
      },
      "Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<p>Poliwrath can become an extremely threatening Belly Drum sweeper when played properly, capable of sweeping entire teams who aren't ready for this threat. This set takes Poliwrath to a whole new level as a sweeper, since most of its other sets rely on improving its defensive capabilities and tanking. After pulling off a Substitute and a Belly Drum, Poliwrath's Attack and Speed stats skyrocket to an incredible Attack stat of 1076 and a great Speed stat of 393, the latter thanks to Salac Berry. Poliwrath now outspeeds everything without a Choice Scarf in the UU metagame aside from the occasional Electrode.</p> <p>Waterfall and Return are recommended since that combo hits everything for neutral or super effective damage. Waterfall will obviously be the main attack of choice since it receives a valuable STAB boost and has a chance to flinch, which could help Poliwrath greatly in some cases. Return is the best alternative so Poliwrath can deal heavy damage to Pokemon who resist Water-type moves, mainly Slowbro and Milotic.</p> <p>The procedure is quite simple, yet difficult to pull off. Switch Poliwrath in on a bulky Pokemon who isn't able to deal enough damage to break its Substitute, such as Registeel, or if you're lucky enough, a Choiced Water-type move thanks to Water Absorb. Substitute as they switch, and proceed to use either Belly Drum or attack right away depending on who they switch in. If the switch-in is not that threatening, such as a Pokemon who doesn't have priority moves, set up a Belly Drum and attempt to sweep. If the switch-in does have priority moves or is faster than Poliwrath, it's a good idea to attack right away instead of wasting a potential Belly Drum sweep.</p> <p>Before you start any Belly Drum sweep with Poliwrath, you must make sure that there are no priority attackers that can put an end to its sweep, since Poliwrath fails to receive a reasonable priority move. Sucker Punch Absol, Vacuum Wave Blaziken, and Mach Punch Hitmontop are prime examples of Pokemon who use priority moves. Jolly Drapion threatens Absol due to its resistance to Sucker Punch and ability to knock out Absol with X-Scissor; Slowbro can switch into Blaziken's STAB moves and threaten it with Surf; and, Weezing can switch into Hitmontop and burn it with Will-O-Wisp, draining its effectiveness. Entry hazards can make it much harder to score the Belly Drum boost since Poliwrath will keep getting hit by them as it switches out from a Pokemon who stops it from Belly Drumming, meaning that sooner or later, Poliwrath won't have enough health to set up. Toxic Spikes in particular will ruin Poliwrath since it will only have at most one chance to attack if it ends up receiving a Belly Drum boost behind a Substitute, which is not very useful. Drapion comes to mind again, as it is great at absorbing and setting up its own Toxic Spikes thanks to its overall bulk, while Claydol is capable of Rapid Spinning away any entry hazards and can than proceed to set up Stealth Rock. Poliwrath can be easily revenge-killed by Choice Scarfers with a base Speed stat of 71 or above with a positive nature and max Speed, like Mesprit, Rotom, and Venusaur.</p>"
      },
      "Mono-Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>CroCune has been considered a threatening force in the OU metagame, but now, Poliwrath brings Suicune into the UU metagame by using an identical set. This set allows Poliwrath to become a sturdy tank, a fantastic status absorber, and a threatening sweeper at the same time, being able to destroy most teams that aren't prepared for such a threat.</p> <p>The main attacking choice for this set would be Waterfall, as it receives a helpful STAB boost and hits a lot of types for neutral or super effective damage, while only being resistant to Dragon-, Water-, and Grass-types. The EV spread is pretty simple; maximizing Poliwrath's HP and Special Defense helps it tank on the special side since it is boosting its Defense and not Special Defense.</p> <p>With its great overall bulk, Poliwrath has many chances to switch in and start setting up Bulk Up to attempt a sweep. It's best to switch it in on weaker Pokemon or Pokemon who can't harm it greatly, such as Registeel, Blaziken, and Weezing. Once Poliwrath receives a couple of Bulk Up boosts, it's ready to wreak havoc and eliminate Pokemon who can't take powerful Waterfalls and can't deal much damage towards it. However, Poliwrath will have difficulties with Pokemon who absorb Water-type moves, including Toxicroak, Lapras, Parasect, and Quagsire.</p> <p>Although maximizing Poliwrath's HP and Special Defense helps, Poliwrath will still take a lot of damage from high powered super effective special attacks, as well as high powered super effective physical attacks if it hasn't received a few Bulk Ups under its belt. Leaf Storm from a Timid Venusaur running max Special Attack with a neutral nature will deal 77% - 91%, which is devastating. Registeel is an excellent answer in threatening these Pokemon, since it boasts excellent Special Defense, resists Grass-, Flying-, and Psychic-type moves aimed at Poliwrath, and can cripple Pokemon with Thunder Wave. Providing dual screen support for Poliwrath is recommended to help Poliwrath set up. Clefable and Gardevoir are excellent dual screeners thanks to their decent bulk and massive support movepools.</p>"

  "Alakazam": {
    "overview": "<p>If not the best in class, Alakazam is at least one of the most powerful special sweepers in the UU tier. With excellent Speed and Special Attack stats, Alakazam goes through teams that lack priority moves or a Choice Scarf Pokemon with relative ease. While offense is Alakazam's natural role, it can also run a few useful supporting roles, such as dual screening and Encore support. Alakazam's main drawbacks are its paper-thin defenses and lack of resistances. Most priority attackers will take a huge chunk out of Alakazam's HP, threatening to cripple or OHKO it. While STAB Psychic is a great attacking type in UU, it also allows Dark-types to switch in without taking a scratch. Houndoom, for example, can come in on a Psychic-type attack and then OHKO Alakazam with STAB Sucker Punch or Dark Pulse.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Alakazam can fill the support role fairly well with moves such as Knock Off and Thunder Wave. However, it is extremely frail and will struggle to find the time to use such moves. Recover is another option, as it gives Alakazam the ability to stay in on attacks such as Chansey's Seismic Toss, but the resulting loss in offensive coverage is usually not worth this benefit. Snatch is a great move, but not really usable on Alakazam, since your opponent will usually just try to OHKO Alakazam as soon as possible and not bother using the setup moves that Snatch works on.</p> <p>Offensively, Alakazam also has quite a few options. While Charge Beam might seem inferior to Calm Mind, it gives Alakazam an extra offensive move while retaining the ability to boost that awesome Special Attack. The boost from Charge Beam is not reliable, however, and this strategy is only recommended when you need to make room for Encore or another support move. Alakazam also learns Shock Wave, but you will rarely find a use for it, since few Pokemon take more from Shock Wave than they do from Psychic. Furthermore, Hidden Power Electric is stronger, and thus Shock Wave should only be used on sets where Alakazam is already using a Hidden Power of another type. Energy Ball and Grass Knot are great options if you need coverage against Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types; however, this is only useful on certain teams, since Psychic will usually do enough damage. Hidden Power Fighting can be considered over Focus Blast if you are worried about the latter's accuracy; however, the damage output will be disappointing against Pokemon such as Chansey, Omastar, and Registeel.</p> <p>Lum Berry can be used in combination with Synchronize, letting you switch into a move such as Thunder Wave or Toxic, inflicting the status effect on your opponent while Alakazam is essentially unscathed. Salac and Petaya Berry are also options, since either boost makes it a little easier for Alakazam to sweep; however, Alakazam really misses Leftovers, especially on sets with Substitute. Furthermore, with the omnipresence of residual damage, namely sandstorm, Alakazam will be quickly worn out without the aid of Leftovers.</p> <p>On offensive sets, it is recommended you use a Timid nature, 252 Special Attack EVs, and at least 216 Speed EVs to outrun any base 115 Speed Pokemon. If you are not worried about outspeeding Ambipom, you can give Alakazam 176 Speed EVs, which will outrun any base 110 Speed Pokemon (who max out at 350 Speed). On the other hand, 252 EVs in Speed lets you tie with other Alakazam, Sceptile, and Dugtrio. A Modest nature is perfectly viable on the Aggressive Lead set since the only Pokemon who will outpace it are Ambipom and opposing Alakazam. Ambipom can't OHKO Alakazam thanks to Focus Sash, and it dies to Focus Blast or Counter. Furthermore, Alakazam won't be sticking around for a long time so you don't have to worry about a possible Dugtrio or Sceptile encounter. The only drawback for using a Modest nature is getting outpaced by opposing Alakazam.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Don't expect a broad list of counters because there aren't many that lie in UU. However, Spiritomb is by far the best counter for almost every set thanks to its Psychic- and Fighting-type immunity. Spiritomb can dispose of Alakazam with Pursuit, Shadow Sneak, Dark Pulse, and Sucker Punch. To a smaller extent, Drapion and Skuntank can check Alakazam fairly well thanks to their unique typing. However, 252 HP / 252 SpD Drapion takes 44% - 52% from a Life Orb Focus Blast, so it's probably a good idea to bring him in on a predicted Psychic to avoid a possible 2HKO. Skuntank has Sucker Punch and Pursuit to keep Alakazam second guessing. On a set that doesn't utilize any form of stat-boosting move or item, Chansey is your best bet as it can use Seismic Toss until it eventually drops dead. An Alakazam who is lacking Grass Knot will have problems bypassing a Specially Defensive Milotic since it can take a hit or two and hurt Alakazam with Surf.</p> <p>Although they're not considered counters, priority hits will seriously injure Alakazam or possibly OHKO it. If Alakazam is not behind a Substitute, feel free to use your respective priority hits when the opening is there. Some noteworthy priority hits that can OHKO include Absol's Sucker Punch and Azumarill's Aqua Jet.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Alakazam holds the title for the highest Special Attack in the UU tier, so it's a no-brainer that it can utilize a Choice Specs set. However, wielding a Choice Specs set is a mixed blessing in the UU tier. Alakazam will seriously dent a number of things with a stat of 607 or 553, depending on the nature of choice, but its type coverage allows a number of Pokemon to switch in through immunity. The worst possible scenario would be getting trapped by Spiritomb since it is immune to a good portion of this set. All in all, this set attempts to play riskily while dishing out a good amount of damage. This set holds the best possible coverage Alakazam can have.</p> <p>Psychic will hit anything who doesn't resist it incredibly hard -- a possible OHKO for the most part. Signal Beam and Focus Blast round off the coverage nicely. Signal Beam is your only hope against Spiritomb if you predict right. Grass Knot is another alternative if you chose Shadow Ball in the final slot, as it allows Alakazam to hit Milotic for heavy damage. Focus Blast is your main weapon against Steel-types and Chansey. The final slot comes down to three choices, and they each have their own share of usefulness. Trick is an excellent move for restricting Chansey from doing much, while Shadow Ball allows you to OHKO Mismagius. It also allows Alakazam to hit Spiritomb harder than Signal Beam would. Grass Knot is also another option to provide optimal coverage for Alakazam by allowing it to hit nearly every check it has.</p> <p>Getting rid of Spiritomb beforehand is a good idea before sending out Alakazam. Spiritomb absolutely walls the set with no worry, and it can counteract with Pursuit to remove Alakazam from the entire match. Your best bet is to lure in Spiritomb to ensure it is present on the opponent's team. Swords Dance Absol can come in handy since it usually lures out Spiritomb, and it will faint from a boosted Megahorn. You can work a two-punch combo with Hitmonlee and Houndoom. Hitmonlee can lure out Spiritomb, while Houndoom absorbs Will-O-Wisp directed at Hitmonlee. Houndoom can use a free turn to set up Nasty Plot and sweep on its own. Sometimes Houndoom will lure in Chansey and possibly OHKO it with Fire Blast. With Chansey removed from the match, Alakazam doesn't have to worry about using the inaccurate Focus Blast. Last but not least, if you opt to use Focus Blast, be sure to remove Spiritomb beforehand so Alakazam has an easier time.</p> <p>For the most part you would want to save Alakazam for the late game once everything is revealed and dented. You can chip away the opponent's HP by using Stealth Rock and Spikes, providing Alakazam a string of OHKOs in the end of the match. As previously mentioned, Omastar does the job well with its ability to set up Stealth Rock and Spikes for Alakazam. Although it's not a requirement, a spinblocker would be helpful for the entire team (including Alakazam) to keep entry hazards present on the field.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<p>One of Alakazam's most prominent drawbacks as a sweeper is his miserable Defense stat, which leaves him completely open to the omnipresent priority attacks in the UU tier. Furthermore, Pursuit users can often OHKO Alakazam even if he decides to stay in, making it extremely difficult to pull off a successful sweep. It would only make sense for Alakazam to utilize Substitute to help it overcome these problems. Substitute shields him from priority hits and also helps Alakazam escape from a possible Pursuit trap from the likes of Spiritomb. Behind a Substitute, Alakazam becomes extremely dangerous, and the opponent will usually be forced to resort to sacrifices in order to break its Substitute. Considering Alakazam's monstrous offensive stats, it isn't difficult to use Substitute on a predicted switch out. Psychic, along with Signal Beam / Shadow Ball, and Focus Blast provide the best possible coverage.</p> <p>Alakazam possesses three attacks to provide the best possible coverage. In contrast to the OU tier, where Steel-types are ubiquitous, Psychic makes an excellent STAB attack in UU. Psychic can be used to threaten a number of Poison-types who plague the metagame, letting Alakazam take advantage of a free turn to set up Substitute. Focus Blast is an excellent way of dealing damage to Registeel, Aggron, Chansey, and Steelix, all of whom are hit for super effective damage. The final move provides Alakazam a way to hit Spiritomb and Psychic-types. Shadow Ball can be used to inflict more damage on Spiritomb and Mismagius, but Signal Beam's confusion effect might come in handy in order to make it extra-difficult for the opponent to hit you behind the Substitute. Additionally, Signal Beam reduces the chances of a Dark-type Pokemon switching in. Grass Knot is another alternative if Milotic might be problematic, and it also hits Spiritomb for 100 Base Power.</p> <p>For the most part, Alakazam can sweep on its own, but it still appreciates support. Stealth Rock and Spikes support can increase damage output and punish the switches Alakazam causes. For instance, 252 HP / 116 SpD Spiritomb takes 27% - 32% from Signal Beam, and with Stealth Rock and Spikes support, that can easily turn into a solid 2HKO (assuming Alakazam is behind Substitute). Another noteworthy example is Chansey taking 38% - 44% from a Life Orb Focus Blast. With Stealth Rock and Spikes support, Alakazam has a chance to grab the 2HKO on Chansey. Omastar is one of the few Pokemon in the tier that can provide both Stealth Rock and Spikes, and it is ideally used on the lead slot to dispatch entry hazards as soon as possible.</p> <p>If you're looking to remove Spiritomb without directly using Alakazam, Blaziken makes an exceptional partner since it is resistant to Dark-type attacks, which are often directed at Alakazam. Houndoom can switch into Spiritomb with impunity and can hurt it with Fire Blast.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>This set utilizes Calm Mind to boost Alakazam's already-high Special Attack stat to further heights. The best way to pull off a successful sweep with this, because of the lack of Encore, is to reveal it later in the match once your opponent's team has been mostly revealed. This way, Alakazam can avoid being easily trapped by the likes of Spiritomb or walled by Chansey. Psychic is a given on this set since it provides STAB, while Focus Blast lets Alakazam deal heavy damage to the most prominent special walls in the tier: Chansey and Registeel. With a single Calm Mind boost, Focus Blast deals 83% - 97.8% to Registeel, while Chansey takes 56.8% - 67.1%. The final slot boils down to which Pokemon you need Alakazam to hit. Shadow Ball strikes Mismagius and Spiritomb for heavy damage, while Signal Beam can reliably finish off weakened Dark-types without worrying about Focus Blast's 70% accuracy. Additionally, Signal Beam and Shadow Ball allow Alakazam to hit bulky Psychic-types like Uxie and Slowking for super effective damage. Grass Knot can be used in the final slot if inflicting significant damage to Milotic is priority.</p> <p>Substitute is an option to protect Alakazam from priority moves and Pursuit. It can also guard Alakazam from status and critical hits that bypass Calm Mind. However, if you opt for Substitute, Alakazam will have less coverage. The EV spread is as it is because Alakazam's frailty discourages any defensive investment and it really needs the Speed and Special Attack.</p> <p>Spikes support is valuable to make this set deadlier. With two layers of Spikes down, Alakazam can OHKO Registeel and 2HKO Chansey with +1 Focus Blast. Offensively, Cloyster fits the bill as a Spikes supporter thanks to its ability to threaten opposing Pokemon with Explosion and check Swellow with Ice Shard.</p> <p>Spiritomb presents an immediate problem to this set since it has the ability to lock down Alakazam with Pursuit, Shadow Sneak, or Sucker Punch. It is highly recommended that you remove Spiritomb from the match before attempting a sweep; as such, Blaziken or Houndoom make great partners since they can easily switch into Dark- and Ghost-type attacks. Additionally, Houndoom and Blaziken are both immune to Will-O-Wisp, which make checking Spiritomb that much easier if pivoting from a physical attacker.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind + Encore": {
        "description": "<p>Even with Alakazam's monstrous Special Attack stat, he struggles to muscle through dedicated special walls such as Chansey and Milotic. Calm Mind remedies this by giving him the power he needs to defeat said walls, while Encore gives the frail Alakazam opportunities to set up. After a boost, Alakazam will reach a Special Attack stat of 553 or 607, depending on the nature of choice. This, coupled with his high Speed, allows him to sweep unhindered. This set has the potential to hit just as hard as the Specs set, while allowing you the freedom to switch moves at the cost of coverage.</p> <p>Psychic will dent any Pokemon not resistant or immune to it, while the coverage move helps Alakazam deal with Pokemon who have no trouble with his STAB. Signal Beam is an accurate move that helps deal with Psychic- and Dark-types, while the less reliable Focus Blast allows Alakazam to defeat Registeel, Steelix, and Chansey. If you wish to hit Spiritomb and Milotic as hard as possible, Grass Knot can also be used, but it isn't particularly useful outside of that.</p> <p>Depending on the coverage move of choice, Alakazam will have trouble with certain Pokemon. Without Focus Blast, Alakazam struggles to harm Registeel, Chansey, and Steelix as they switch in to foil his sweep. If Focus Blast is chosen, Alakazam will be completely useless against Spiritomb and will lose the accuracy of Signal Beam to reliably take out Dark-type threats. Alakazam will also be walled by Psychic-types like Uxie and Mesprit, making Signal Beam superior in terms of reliability and coverage.</p> <p>Max Speed with a Timid nature is recommended as Alakazam's frailty means he needs to attack as fast as possible before being attacked himself, but the additional power of Modest cannot be ignored. With a Modest nature, Alakazam only needs Stealth Rock to ensure the 2HKO with a +1 Focus Blast on Chansey. Leftovers is the preferred item to heal entry hazard damage and aid setting up, while Life Orb gives Alakazam a further power boost. With Life Orb, Timid Alakazam has a very slight chance to OHKO standard Registeel (using Focus Blast) with Stealth Rock after a Calm Mind, and has a guaranteed OHKO with Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. The ability choice is up to preference, as bouncing back status with Synchronize is useful, as is Inner Focus for eliminating Ambipom and Technitop as they attempt to flinch you with Fake Out.</p> <p>Alakazam's frailty doesn't allow him many opportunities to set up, and this is where Encore comes in. Encoring setup moves such as Stealth Rock or recovery moves from walls gives him the time he needs to set up without fear of retaliation. With proper prediction, Alakazam can switch in on set-up sweepers such as Toxicroak or Leafeon and foil their attempts at a sweep, while beginning his own. Substitute users are also susceptible to Encore, including SubSeeders and SubPunchers. Encore also allows Alakazam to defeat revenge killers who rely on Sucker Punch to stop him, such as Houndoom, Toxicroak, and Absol. Encoring Sucker Punch allows Alakazam to continue Calm Minding while the opponent remains helpless, and after Sucker Punch's PP wears out, Alakazam can KO the Pokemon with the appropriate move. Alakazam is best played from mid to late game when the majority of your opponent's team is revealed and you've scouted potential threats. Even if the opportunity to sweep hasn't presented itself, Alakazam can fire off a few attacks and Encore key moves to support his team until he can finally attempt a sweep.</p> <p>Although Alakazam hits hard on his own, he still appreciates support from his team. Entry hazards are especially useful, as they allow Alakazam to get KOs he otherwise wouldn't on Pokemon such as Chansey and specially defensive Milotic. Omastar makes a good partner, as he has access to all forms of entry hazards and makes an effective lead. Blaziken and Houndoom make ideal partners for their ability to get rid of Spiritomb and any other threats who may pester Alakazam with the loss of one of his coverage moves. Venusaur can lure Registeel, put it to sleep, and begin setting up Swords Dance. Venusaur can also KO Milotic before she can become a hindrance to Alakazam. Pokemon who can take priority attacks aimed at Alakazam are also recommended. Slowbro is a good choice as his high Defense allows him to easily sponge hits from Arcanine and Azumarill. Hitmonlee can eliminate Chansey and pesky Steel-types with his Fighting STAB while hitting Spiritomb hard with Stone Edge. Dugtrio gets a special mention for being able to trap and defeat Registeel, Chansey, and weakened Steelix on his own, which is especially useful for Alakazam who choose Signal Beam as their coverage move.</p>"

      "Substitute + Encore": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to tone Alakazam down offensively in order to support your entire team with its unique move: Encore. Much like the previous sets, Substitute is used to ensure Alakazam is protected from Pursuit and priority hits. However, the tried-and-true strategy with Substitute is used in conjunction with Encore. The opponent is forced to attack you when you are behind the Substitute, giving Alakazam a chance to use Encore. If the opponent decides to use a Dark-type attack, for instance, you can bring in someone who appreciates a free turn to set up, such as Blaziken. Even without a Substitute, Encore can be useful on something that decides to set up on Alakazam.</p> <p>Much like the previous set, Psychic is already a given, and the choice is between Signal Beam and Focus Blast. Since this set aims to support the team instead of dishing out damage, the choice for the final slot isn't a huge concern. Signal Beam will hit Spiritomb for neutral damage, while Focus Blast will hit Steel-types and Chansey for super effective damage.</p> <p>Take advantage of Alakazam's ability to lure in certain attacks. Dark-type attacks will give Blaziken a free turn to set up Swords Dance. Other candidates include Aggron, who can take advantage of a free turn to set up Substitute and Magnet Rise -- a tough task to accomplish without support. Equally effective offensive partners are Pokemon who can switch into opponents locked into Ghost-type moves. Linoone and Ursaring are ideal partners since they both appreciate a free turn to set up due to their miserable defensive stats. Overall, anyone who enjoys a free turn to set up could be considered as a partner.</p> <p>Since Alakazam creates multiple switch-outs by using Encore, it would only make sense to fit in both Stealth Rock and Spikes to rack up residual damage. Omastar seems to fill this job correctly since it's capable of using them in the same moveset. If you're looking to split the work, Uxie and Cloyster can exchange attacks dished at each other and use a free turn to set up Stealth Rock or Spikes.</p>"
      },
      "Attacking Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Alakazam can fill a nice role in the lead slot thanks to Taunt and its ability Inner Focus, which prevents Fake Out leads from flinching it. In general, this set fares well against a number of popular leads in the UU tier, aiming to dish as much damage as possible with excellent coverage all-around while preventing an easy set up for the opponent. Taunt makes a fantastic opening move on leads such as Omastar and Cloyster since both of them enjoy deploying entry hazards early in the match; it also prevents Uxie from setting up Stealth Rock and paralyzing you with Thunder Wave. Psychic is Alakazam's obligatory STAB move, and it 2HKOes almost any lead that does not outright resist it. Focus Blast will OHKO a number of leads including Omastar, Cloyster, Ambipom, and Snover, but if its accuracy makes you nervous, Counter is also another alternative to look for in order to OHKO Ambipom after it uses Fake Out. Signal Beam is essential on this set in order to hit Uxie for super effective damage.</p> <p>The choice between Modest and Timid nature is ultimately a choice between power and speed. A Modest nature provides Alakazam with a way to deal more damage to Uxie and Spiritomb, while a Timid nature ensures Alakazam is not outpaced by Dugtrio, Sceptile, and opposing Alakazam in later stages of the match.</p> <p>Flying- and Fire-types are excellent partners with Alakazam since it normally shuts down Stealth Rock users in the start of the match. Moltres, Swellow, Arcanine, and Magmortar enjoy coming in later when Stealth Rock is not present. Alakazam not only shuts down the opponent's Stealth Rock user, but it can also severely damage many common leads. Kangaskhan makes an exceptional offensive partner alongside Alakazam since Focus Blast destroys Omastar, one of its few checks in UU. Spiritomb is a match made in hell for Alakazam since it can't deal any significant damage to Spiritomb without some form of boost. Blaziken and Houndoom make excellent teammates, as they are immune to Will-O-Wisp and can check Spiritomb well. A number of Fighting-types including Hitmonlee, Hariyama, and Hitmontop appreciate it when Uxie is dented early in the match.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>Despite Alakazam's paper thin defenses, you have to consider its blistering Speed stat and ability to create an opening for setting up dual screens. Furthermore, Inner Focus allows Alakazam to bypass the flinch from Ambipom's Fake Out and set up both Reflect and Light Screen. Taking all of this into account, Alakazam can open up opportunities for your entire team, and it can make Baton Passing sufficiently easier.</p> <p>Encore is the crux of the set because it prevents the opponent from attacking you if it sets up, and Alakazam can take advantage of the free turn to set up dual screens. For the final slot, it ultimately comes down to what you decide to do. Taunt restricts the opponent's Ambipom from utilizing Taunt on you; however, the chances of Ambipom using Taunt are very slim since many of Ambipom leads expect Alakazam to attack. Generally, Taunt shuts down the opponent from setting up anything. If you feel the need to space in an attack move, Psychic could go over Taunt. If you decide to place Psychic in the final slot, Taunt could be used in the third slot.</p> <p>The EVs are allocated to outpace Ambipom -- the third fastest lead it will face behind Alakazam and the rare Electrode. 252 HP EVs maximize its ability to take hits. The surplus is dumped to Defense EVs in order to take a Fake Out from Ambipom and survive the following U-turn after setting up Reflect.</p> <p>The number of partners for this particular set is endless since anyone appreciates dual screen support. However, there are certain Pokemon who need dual screens as a staple. Ursaring absolutely needs dual screens to set up Swords Dance and deal huge amount of damage while cushioning the blows. Other candidates include Absol, Houndoom, and Blaziken. These three are quite frail, and they can use a free turn to set up their respective stat-up moves. Rhyperior gets a special mention since Solid Rock and dual screens mesh well together, only making it extra-difficult to take down.</p>"

  "Victreebel": {
    "overview": "<p>Victreebel has always been thought of as a run-of-the-mill Chlorophyll abuser. That has been the truth for most of Generation Four. However, with the advent of HeartGold and SoulSilver, Victreebel finally gained new toys to separate it from the rest of the pack: Leaf Blade and Weather Ball. With great offensive base stats of 105 Attack and 100 Special Attack, a revamped movepool, and Chlorophyll, Victreebel can be a fearsome sweeper under the sun.</p> <p>On the other hand, Victreebel's defenses are mediocre at best, and even with its good support movepool, it cannot stand up to the hard hitters in the UU metagame. In the absence of sun, Victreebel's below average Speed stat is also exposed. While resistances to common priority moves such as Aqua Jet, Vacuum Wave, and Mach Punch increase its survivability while sweeping, Victreebel is still easily revenge killed after the sun fades away.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Victreebel's movepool is not very large. Stun Spore, Teeter Dance, and Toxic are usable support moves in order to inflict status and annoy the opponent, but in most situations Sleep Powder will be the superior option as sleep is the most effective status ailment. Victreebel can use an annoyer set, inflicting different status on the opposing team, but bulkier Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Bellossom generally do this job better. A supporting set consisting of Knock Off and Sleep Powder can be used, but it's pretty much outclassed by Venusaur, which is bulkier and faster. Synthesis is a good recovery move, but Victreebel cannot use it well due to its poor defenses. Growth can be used to boost Victreebel's Special Attack, but its frailty prevents it from accumulating many boosts. Double-Edge and Body Slam are options for the Swords Dance set, but are mostly inferior to Return. Energy Ball provides a consistent STAB move, but is mostly outclassed by Solar Beam as the sun will usually be active. Hidden Power Rock can be used to garner an easy KO against Moltres and get a good hit on other Fire-types and Altaria, but it's mostly outclassed by Victreebel's other options. Reflect is a good support option to increase physical defense, while Encore can be used to force switches on slower Pokemon, or allow a sweeper to set up. Gastro Acid and Worry Seed can mess with Pokemon who function well because of their abilities. Victreebel can run Choice Specs, but it is badly outclassed by Sceptile, Exeggutor, and Venusaur, who boast better Speed, Special Attack, and coverage, respectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Since Victreebel's defenses are very poor, almost every offensive Pokemon can OHKO or 2HKO Victreebel with STAB attacks, but they must be able to take a couple of Victreebel's attacks. Victreebel must also be very wary of taking Fire-, Flying-, and Psychic-type attacks as these will easily lead to Victreebel's demise. Victreebel is extremely vulnerable when the sun is not up, as opponents can take advantage of its below average Speed. Without the sun, Moltres, Arcanine, Houndoom, Swellow, Altaria, Alakazam, Uxie, and Mesprit can all switch into Victreebel, and hit it super effectively with their STAB attacks. Note that counters must be wary as Victreebel might be running unorthodox moves such as Hidden Power Rock, Sludge Bomb, or Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Under the sun, Chlorophyll is activated, meaning fast and frail attackers such as Alakazam, Houndoom, and Swellow are no longer reliable switch-ins, as they will be outsped by Victreebel and knocked out. The task thus falls to extremely fast or extremely bulky Pokemon to defeat Victreebel. In the sun, Victreebel can still be outsped by Choice Scarf Typhlosion which blasts Victreebel to a crisp with a Fire-type move. Other Chlorophyll users, such as Jumpluff and Shiftry, can also outspeed Victreebel and hit it hard with a super effective Hidden Power. One can also use powerful priority moves such as Ambipom's Fake Out, Absol's Sucker Punch, Arcanine's Extreme Speed, and Donphan's Ice Shard to bypass Victreebel's Speed.</p> <p>Against specially based variants, Chansey and Clefable counter Victreebel decently, but switching in on a Swords Dance could be devastating. Registeel and Weezing wall the physical set very well, but both must be vigilant for a stray Weather Ball. Weezing can also burn Victreebel to halve its physical damage output. Muk resists both of Victreebel's STAB attacks, but Victreebel often carries secondary attacks such as Return or Weather Ball to hit it neutrally. Uxie is extremely bulky, and Victreebel would do well to flee from a STAB Psychic. Victreebel especially fears paralysis, so it must watch out for Pokemon who can survive one of its attacks and paralyze it, such as Registeel, Uxie, and Clefable.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>With Sunny Day up, Victreebel can become a very powerful special sweeper, abusing its decent base 100 Special Attack stat and doubled Speed thanks to Chlorophyll. Solar Beam is its main attack since Victreebel doesn't have to expend a turn on charging up the move while the sun is out. With 120 Base Power backed by STAB, it is easily capable of devastating Pokemon who don't resist it. Weather Ball is great on Victreebel as with Sunny Day active, it becomes a 100 Base Power Fire-type move receiving a 1.5x damage boost due to the sun, allowing Victreebel to destroy Grass-, Steel-, and Ice-type Pokemon. Sleep Powder can incapacitate one of its counters, allowing Victreebel to safely switch out to an appropriate answer to its counter. Hidden Power Rock hits Fire- and Flying-type Pokemon for super effective damage, who would otherwise cause problems for Victreebel.</p> <p>The EV spread lets Victreebel outspeed Choice Scarf Rotom under the sun, while the rest of the EVs are placed into HP for added bulk. Victreebel has many options for coverage. Hidden Power Ice allows Victreebel to defeat Dragon-type Pokemon that are resistant to Weather Ball and Solar Beam, such as Altaria. You can also use Sludge Bomb in the last slot as secondary STAB, as it is quite strong, and deals a lot of damage to Pokemon who resist its other moves. Life Orb gives Victreebel some much needed power. With Life Orb, you will always OHKO Electrode with Solar Beam, and always 2HKO 252 HP / 4 SpD Uxie after Stealth Rock damage, and do 57.1% - 67.6% to 252 HP / 252 SpD Careful Registeel.</p> <p>Without the sun, a lot of Pokemon can outspeed and OHKO Victreebel. However, if Sunny Day is up, Victreebel outspeeds almost every Pokemon in the tier, and can put its counters to sleep with Sleep Powder, which is why Sunny Day support is essential. Moltres, Meganium, Uxie, and Porygon2 are fantastic choices to set up Sunny Day as they have reasonable bulk. Moltres can use Sunny Day to sweep or to support its teammates. Meganium is bulky and can use Sunny Day very well. Uxie has fantastic defenses, and it almost always can set up Sunny Day. Porygon2 is bulky and sets up Sunny Day well. It can also trace Flash Fire and then beat Arcanine and Houndoom.</p> <p>Fast Fire-types with a Choice Scarf, such as Typhlosion, outspeed Victreebel and can knock it out with their powerful STAB attacks. For this reason, one might want to pack counters to Fire-type Pokemon on their team. Dugtrio can trap and KO most Fire-types, as well as Registeel, Chansey, and Clefable, making it a very good partner. Grumpig is an ideal counter to Fire-types due to Thick Fat, which halves damage from Fire-type moves, and a high Special Defense stat, allowing it to take their STAB attacks and hit back with STAB Psychic. Grumpig has the added bonus of resisting Ice-type attacks as well, which Victreebel often attracts. Bulky Water-types such as Milotic, Slowbro, and Slowking are good counters to Fire-type Pokemon due to their high defensive stats and access to instant recovery. However, it must be noted that the damage output of Surf will be halved under the sun. Thanks to Flash Fire, Houndoom and Arcanine, can switch in on a Fire-type attack aimed at Victreebel, and try to sweep. Regirock and Rhyperior both resist Fire-type attacks, and can deal huge amounts of damage to Fire-types with Stone Edge or Earthquake.</p> <p>This set has problems taking out Clefable and Chansey due to their high Special Defense. These Pokemon have the added bonus of being able to stall out the remaining turns of Sunny Day with the combination of Wish and Protect. For this reason, Fighting-type Pokemon are great teammates for Victreebel. Hariyama, Hitmontop, Hitmonlee, and Primeape are all examples of Pokemon that cause problems to the aforementioned Pokemon, as their STAB Fighting-type moves will devastate both of them.</p> <p>As with all offensive Pokemon, Stealth Rock and Spikes support is greatly appreciated. Registeel, Cloyster, and Uxie can set up entry hazards with relative ease. Registeel's defenses let it take a lot of attacks and set up Stealth Rock. Uxie is also a great support Pokemon, since it almost always sets up Stealth Rock thanks to its high defenses and good Speed.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Chlorophyll and Victreebel's great Attack, a Swords Dance set is perfectly viable. Leaf Blade, which receives STAB and a nifty increased critical hit rate, is Victreebel's main attack, OHKOing a lot of Pokemon that don't resist it after a Swords Dance boost. Sucker Punch is one of the strongest priority moves in the game, and is used to defeat some frail Pokemon such as Mismagius, Alakazam, and weaker Choice Scarf users. As priority is uncommon on sun teams, Sucker Punch can be a nasty surprise for your opponent both in and out of the sun. Return can also be run on the set, as it grants Victreebel strong neutral coverage. Sleep Powder allows Victreebel to incapacitate an enemy Pokemon before proceeding to use Swords Dance without harm. Alternatively, Weather Ball is great for coverage, as it allows Victreebel to beat not only Ice- and Grass-type Pokemon, but also Steel-types who resist Victreebel's other moves.</p> <p>The given EV spread and an Adamant nature maximize Victreebel's Attack, and, in conjunction with sun, allow it to outrun every Pokemon in the tier that doesn't have a Choice Scarf, and even some that do, including Timid Venusaur and Modest Rotom and Moltres. The rest is put into HP to give Victreebel a little bit more survivability. When using Weather Ball, one should use a Naughty nature instead to prevent lowering Victreebel's Special Attack stat. The HP EVs can be shifted to Special Attack to boost the power of Weather Ball. Life Orb is the item of choice, as it gives a power boost to Victreebel's attacks.</p> <p>Sunny Day support is very important, as if it isn't up, Victreebel won't be able to sweep due to its below average Speed. Porygon2, Uxie, Mesprit, and Regirock are good teammates who can set up Sunny Day reliably. Entry hazard support is also important to net Victreebel some KOs and to discourage your opponent from switching. Since Victreebel attracts many Fire-type attacks, Arcanine and Houndoom are good partners as they can switch in with impunity thanks to Flash Fire.</p> <p>This set has problems against Steel-, Poison-, and Fire-type Pokemon such as Registeel, Steelix, Arcanine, Weezing, and Aggron who resist Victreebel's attacks. Steel-types can be somewhat dealt with with Weather Ball. With Arena Trap, Dugtrio can trap the aforementioned Pokemon bar Weezing and maim them with STAB Earthquake. Other Ground- and Water-type Pokemon such as Quagsire, Gastrodon, and Rhyperior also work well, carrying dangerous dual STABs for Victreebel's counters.</p>"

  "Golem": {
    "overview": "<p>Rock / Ground typing has never been sought after on any Pokemon, and Golem certainly is no exception to that rule. However, with base 110 Attack and base 130 Defense, as well as some powerful moves with which to abuse said stats, he can prove useful. Golem is often seen as outclassed by his Ground / Rock-type rival, Rhyperior, but Golem has a few decent options that Rhyperior doesn't. Sucker Punch is very useful for making up for his low Speed and Explosion is a very powerful move in general to go out with a bang. His shortcomings, however, prevent Golem from shining in the limelight of UU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Regardless of his good defensive stats, Golem has one of the worst movepools available. Fire Punch is a really good option for Torterra and still does a good amount to Claydol, his biggest counters. Rock Polish is semi-viable, but disregarding Explosion, Rhyperior completely outclasses Rock Polish Golem. Rest and Sleep Talk can also be used, but Golem has a terrible defensive typing.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Claydol is one of the best switch-ins around, since it is immune to Earthquake and resistant to Stone Edge. Ground-, Water-, and Grass-types with decent Defense are also fine switch-ins. Donphan, Leafeon, Torterra, Tangrowth, and Milotic are all good options. Rotom and Mismagius can come in on Earthquake, Double-Edge, and Explosion. Both are destroyed by Stone Edge though. Uxie can come in on the same attacks as the Ghosts and threaten to cripple Golem's power with Reflect or deal good damage with Grass Knot or Psychic.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Attacking Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Focus Sash is a great item for Golem, as it makes up for his numerous weaknesses and poor Special Defense while allowing him to devote his EVs to Attack and Speed. Guaranteed to survive at least one attack, Golem can make full use of his high Attack stat and excellent attacking options, which include great coverage with just his STAB moves, powerful priority in Sucker Punch, and a potent finisher in Explosion.</p> <p>Rock Blast is mentioned as the top choice of the two Rock attacks due to its synergy with Sucker Punch. While Sucker Punch encourages Pokemon such as Sceptile and Mismagius to use Substitute, Rock Blast punishes the use of Substitute with its ability to break the Substitute with the first hit or two and continue to cause damage afterwards. However, Stone Edge is still a great choice as it always hits for 100 Base Power, allowing Golem to reliably damage opponents (assuming it hits) such as Sceptile and Mesprit to the point that Sucker Punch can finish them off. Earthquake is Golem's most reliable attack, and it hits many leads for super effective damage; notable examples including Omastar, Kabutops, Nidoqueen, and Rhyperior, which are all 2HKOed or OHKOed. Explosion lets him OHKO Cloyster, Donphan, and Claydol, who are all outsped. Sucker Punch is there to finish off Ambipom after Golem hits him with Earthquake, and to OHKO Choice Specs Alakazam leads.</p> <p>This set does excellently against heavily offensive teams for two reasons: first, their leads often prioritize setting up entry hazards or Rain Dance, so they often leave Golem's Focus Sash intact. Second, they tend to have fewer bulky Pokemon, so they will often have to sacrifice a sweeper to break Golem's Focus Sash, or sacrifice part of their generally minimal defensive core to Golem's Explosion.</p> <p>At the same time, this set can be more difficult to use against stall teams that have many bulky Pokemon to take Golem's regular attacks and Ghost-types to take Explosion. Golem can only hurt these teams with good prediction, since their users will often try bait-and-switch tactics to get Golem to Explode on the wrong target. However, Golem can hurt Spiritomb and Rock- and Steel-types with Earthquake, while he can hurt any other Ghosts with Rock attacks, so it is possible to turn an opponent's strategy against them. Still, these prediction wars generally favor the stall team, as Golem only gets one chance to use Explosion. Sometimes the best tactic against stall teams is to save Golem for later, as stall teams can have a tougher time avoiding Explosion after they have been weakened a bit, and Golem outspeeds many stall staples.</p> <p>Golem's teammates should include at least a couple of sweepers who can take advantage of any damage that Golem causes to the opposing team. This set is very good at taking out or severely weakening opposing Stealth Rock leads, and tends to lure Ghosts with the threat of Explosion, potentially taking them out with STAB moves and/or Sucker Punch. This means Rapid Spin users enjoy having Golem on their team, if only to scout the opponent's spinblocker. Golem is well supported by Pursuit users and Flash Fire Pokemon, as Ghost-type Pokemon that switch in will often use Will-O-Wisp. Houndoom is notable as he can both absorb Will-O-Wisp and use Pursuit, but be wary as he shares weaknesses to Water and Ground with Golem. Golem can't do much to opposing sleep leads, so having a cleric or sleep absorber will be helpful. Golem will often sacrifice himself in order to do as much damage as possible, so if your team needs his resistances to Normal and Rock or immunity to Electric, you will want to make sure you have those covered by other teammates as well.</p> <p>Golem's worst lead matchup is against Uxie, who can survive Explosion with its standard set. As such, you will need one or more teammates as a contingency plan for Uxie. A fast Pursuit user such as Houndoom or Swellow can trap and destroy Uxie who have just suffered Golem's Explosion while also finishing off Focus Sash leads who attacked Golem rather than set up. It is also recommended that you have a plan to deal with dual screen Uxie. It will almost always use Reflect first against Golem, so your Mismagius or other Ghost-type teammate can come in and finish it off after Golem uses Explosion, leaving the opposing team without Light Screen. Any Pokemon using Brick Break can undo Uxie's hard work, so Scyther is a good teammate. The riskiest option against the standard Uxie is to go for a surprise KO by attacking the first turn and using Explosion on whichever Pokemon switches in after Uxie U-turns.</p> <p>There are many things to consider if using Golem as a lead. First, consider how well the rest of your team matches up against different play styles. For instance, if your team cannot function with Stealth Rock up, Golem will probably not be a good choice. However, if you have trouble with heavy offense, Golem might be a great help. If you're building a team around a Golem lead, consider using an offensive team yourself, as these teams appreciate Golem's ability to cause lots of early damage. If what you are looking for is a bulky Stealth Rock lead with Rock / Ground coverage, you should probably be using Rhyperior. Rhyperior's defensive ability far eclipses Golem's, which allows him to use Stealth Rock more effectively and switch in and out later in the match. Golem's advantages are the moves Explosion and Sucker Punch, and most importantly, the synergy that they have with Focus Sash. Weigh these advantages carefully to make sure that you are not using an inferior Rhyperior.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<p>With Substitute, Golem can gain some extra leverage and ease prediction against the opponent. Since fast special attackers are generally quite physically frail, those that attempt to switch in on an immunity or resistance will be put into an awkward position. This Golem can also act as an excellent lure for all bulky Water-types in UU, most notably Milotic. When behind a Substitute, he can safely Explode on bulky Water-types without worrying about being outsped.</p> <p>Explosion is required to net a clean OHKO on the bulky Water-types that Golem will lure, while Earthquake and Stone Edge provide strong STABs with good coverage. To illustrate Golem's power, Life Orb Earthquake will OHKO standard Registeel and deal 80% minimum to 4 HP / 0 Def Venusaur, while Stone Edge will 3HKO defensive Uxie and OHKO offensive Rotom. Alternatively, Stone Edge can be dropped for Sucker Punch, which bypasses Golem's pathetic Speed and has good synergy with Substitute.</p> <p>The item choice dictates how Golem plays. On the one hand, using a Life Orb allows Golem to hit much harder, but since Life Orb in tandem with Substitute will be rapidly draining Golem's HP, he is forced to be played as offensively as possible. On the other hand, Leftovers keeps Golem healthy and recovers HP lost from using Substitute. The given Speed EVs allow Golem to outspeed Chansey and Registeel without Speed investment, but 4 additional EVs can be used, as outspeeding 4 Speed Donphan is quite crucial. Attack is maxed so that Golem can dish out as much damage as possible, while the remaining EVs are allocated to HP for additional bulk.</p> <p>This Golem thrives on breaking tanks and walls. Hence, you should consider having sweepers that capitalize on his work. Normal-type sweepers such as Swellow and Kangaskhan love Registeel gone. Blaziken, Feraligatr, and all rain sweepers can take advantage of bulky Water-types being removed. Golem appreciates another Normal-type resistor capable of checking Normal-types. Otherwise, your team can be left vulnerable to Ambipom and Swellow after Golem uses Explosion. Omastar and Kabutops resist Normal-type moves, and they can also sweep with opposing bulky Water-types gone. However, beware of the horrid type synergy they have with Golem.</p> <p>Predicting Explosion and preventing Golem from setting up Substitute are perhaps the easiest ways to counter him. Uxie and Claydol can take his hits and set up on him or break his Substitutes. Ghost-types, like Spiritomb and Rotom, are likely to switch in on a predicted Explosion, which could essentially waste Golem's life. Therefore, Pursuit users are welcome teammates; they can efficiently remove Ghost-types and scare the bulky Psychic-types. However, Claydol and Uxie are bulky enough to survive STAB Pursuits, especially behind Reflect. Since they are often seen in the lead slot, fast Sleep Powder and Taunt leads can effectively shut them down.</p>"
      },
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to his solid base 110 Attack stat and potent Stone Edge and Earthquake combination, an offensive set seems ideal for Golem. Claydol and Torterra, who resist both of Golem's STABs, will take a hefty chunk of damage from Double-Edge. Explosion is also incredibly powerful when boosted by a Choice Band and will decimate opponents. An Adamant nature will yield the highest damage output per attack, but a Jolly nature will allow you to outspeed Milotic. Rock Head is the suggested ability because of Double-Edge's recoil.</p> <p>When using Life Orb, Sucker Punch becomes viable. Sucker Punch's dependency on the opponent's actions makes it a poor choice when using Choice Band, which locks you into the move and can potentially give the opponent free opportunities to set up. Stealth Rock is not a huge issue for Golem, but Spikes can really wear it down fast, especially when using Choice Band, which will likely force you to switch more frequently. For this reason, a teammate packing Rapid Spin will be a great asset for this set, clearing the road for Golem to sweep. Claydol and Torterra are the best answers to this set, and although neither of them particularly enjoy taking Choice Band-boosted Double-Edges or Explosions, they can take whatever Golem can dish out for the most part. A powerful Ice-type pokemon, such as Jynx, makes a good candidate to get rid of these obstacles.</p>"

  "Mr. Mime": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Mr. Mime doesn't look the part, he can make an excellent addition to any team. Whether he's passing stat boosts, Substitutes, or sweeping with Nasty Plot, he does his job well thanks to his wide movepool. Moves such as Taunt and Encore aid Mr. Mime in setting up, while his good offensive movepool helps him sweep. He also has abilities that are both quite useful in their own regard. Baton Pass sets in particular benefit from Soundproof to prevent the opponent from phazing him out with Roar, while Filter weakens the super effective attacks that may connect with Mr. Mime. It's not all good news though, as Mr. Mime's horrible physical defenses give him a terrible weakness to Pursuit users such as Spiritomb and Drapion, greatly limiting his supporting prowess.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mr. Mime may utilize dual screens to support teammates, though he has better things to do with his time, and roles like this are better left to faster or bulkier Pokemon like Alakazam or Uxie. Psych Up is usable to copy the opponent's stat boosts, then pass them to a teammate, though it's unreliable. Grass Knot is an interesting option, as it is good against heavier opponents like Milotic and Rhyperior, though it should not be Mr. Mime's only attack. Barrier is a good choice to pass Defense boosts to a teammate, and helps Mr. Mime with his low Defense stat and Pursuit weakness. Finally, Teeter Dance and Thunder Wave may be used together to form a ParaFusion set, but this is very luck-based and unreliable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Mr. Mime is always specially based, making Chansey and Clefable ideal counters to most sets, though they dislike being Tricked a Choice item. Their high HP and Special Defense stats, along with reliable recovery moves, make them very sturdy and difficult to take out with special attacks. Spiritomb is another excellent counter due to its Dark-typing, great defenses, and access to Pursuit, which is deadly against Mr. Mime's awful Defense. Claydol is an interesting option as it has a resistance to Psychic, an immunity to Thunderbolt, good Special Defense, and Earthquake, which hits Mr. Mime on its weaker Defense; although it must be wary of Grass Knot. Most Dark-types with decent Special Defense, such as Drapion and Skuntank, can take on Mr. Mime with a combination of Sucker Punch and Pursuit.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>Mr. Mime makes a fine Baton Passer due to his above average Speed, great stat boosting moves (including the somewhat rare Nasty Plot), and an amazing ability. Soundproof renders Roar useless, making it harder for the opponent to remove Mr. Mime's stat boosts, although he's still affected by Whirlwind. Taunt makes it more difficult for opposing Pokemon to force Mr. Mime off the field, which is especially helpful against the common Milotic with Haze. Substitute helps Mr. Mime avoid status, and as an added bonus can be passed to other teammates, while Encore is great for crippling Pokemon who used a support move on the previous turn, such as Stealth Rock. Finally, Psychic and Charge Beam are listed so Mr. Mime isn't completely shut down by Taunt. Psychic is a reliable STAB move, and Charge Beam has a good chance to raise Mr. Mime's Special Attack, which is yet another possible boost for Mr. Mime to pass.</p> <p>252 Speed EVs ensure that Mr. Mime outruns Jolly Toxicroak, Nidoking, and Hitmonlee, while outrunning Timid Milotic and tying with Timid Moltres. You may choose to run a more defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 192 SpD / 64 Spe, though this requires support from another Pokemon who can pass Mr. Mime Speed; the best choice for this is Gorebyss, as it may also pass Defense and Special Defense boosts. 64 Speed EVs ensure that Mr. Mime outruns Choice Scarf Rotom after an Agility has been passed to him.</p> <p>As Mr. Mime will be passing Special Attack boosts, a recipient to capitalize on these boosts is necessary. Moltres is an excellent choice, due to its high Special Attack and Speed, while its decent defenses allow it to switch in more easily, though the field must be free from Stealth Rock. Alakazam is another excellent recipient due to its massive Special Attack and Speed, though its low defenses may cause problems when switching in without a Substitute. It also shares the same typing as Mr. Mime, making it more vulnerable to a super effective move.</p> <p>A dual screen user may be an effective teammate, allowing Mr. Mime to accumulate more boosts before he has to use Baton Pass. Uxie is an excellent choice as it can support the team with entry hazards, paralysis support, and even Memento. Alakazam is also a fine choice as it has the Speed to set up screens before the opponent can attack; it also has Taunt to stop the opponent from setting up. Other good Pokemon for this role include Ampharos and Clefable, as both have high defenses and excellent defensive synergy with Mr. Mime.</p>"
      },
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>This set attempts to make Mr. Mime a revenge killer, using Choice Scarf for Speed and Choice Specs for power. Trick is listed in the first slot as it allows Mr. Mime to cripple an opposing wall that could potentially be problematic. For example, a Choice Scarf will make a Pokemon such as Registeel useless, locking it into only one move and barely boosting its pathetic Speed. Psychic is used as STAB, while Thunderbolt is used to provide coverage against Water-types such as Milotic. It also hits Spiritomb, who is immune to Mr. Mime's other attacking moves. The final slot is used for extra type coverage, or in the case of Baton Pass, to allow Mr. Mime to scout the opponent's team and escape Pursuit. Baton Pass is the main reason to use Mr. Mime over Alakazam, though Filter also makes him more difficult to KO than his spoon-holding rival. Focus Blast hits Steel-types like Registeel super effectively. Shadow Ball provides coverage against Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Mismagius and Uxie.</p> <p>When holding a Choice Scarf, Mr. Mime becomes one of the fastest Pokemon in UU, reaching 459 Speed and outrunning everything up to and including Choice Scarf Moltres, Timid Alakazam, Electrode, and many more. 252 Speed EVs ensure that, even without a Choice Scarf, Mr. Mime still reaches 306 Speed, outrunning base 85 Pokemon like Toxicroak and slower Pokemon like Timid Milotic. Filter is the better ability in this case, as Mr. Mime isn't going to pass any stat boosts, and he needs the extra insurance against super effective hits due to his low HP and Defense stats.</p> <p>Spiritomb is a major threat if Mr. Mime isn't carrying Baton Pass, or is unable to use it; Pursuit against a fleeing Mr. Mime is sure to KO him. The best way to cripple Spiritomb is to set up Toxic Spikes, which will slowly drain its health. Qwilfish is a great Pokemon to set them up due to its high Speed and ability to Explode afterwards. Another way to cripple Spiritomb is to Trick a Choice item onto it; just beware that it isn't a Choice Band variant, as they usually have Trick on their own moveset. Registeel is a good counter to Spiritomb, as long as it doesn't get burned by Will-O-Wisp. Registeel's huge defenses and Steel-typing allow it to wall Spiritomb indefinitely.</p> <p>Chansey and Clefable can be difficult to beat, though neither of them appreciate being Tricked a Choice item, or taking repeated hits from Choice Specs Focus Blast. The best way to overcome Chansey or Clefable is by using a Fighting-type like Hitmonlee who can hit them super effectively with its STAB attacks. Dugtrio is another interesting choice as it can trap the opponent's special wall with its Arena Trap ability, then hit them with STAB Earthquake. Dugtrio is also good for dealing with Houndoom (though beware of Sucker Punch) and Registeel.</p> <p>If you opt for Focus Blast in the last slot, Mismagius becomes an excellent choice on your team. With Registeel and Houndoom removed from the match, Misumagius can freely set up Nasty Plot and sweep the opponent's team with boosted Shadow Ball and Hidden Power Fighting. Taunt is a good option for Mismagius as it prevents Chansey or Clefable from using healing or status moves, while Seismic Toss doesn't affect Mismagius due to its Ghost typing.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>This set uses Nasty Plot to raise Mr. Mime's Special Attack, while utilizing Encore or Baton Pass to support the team. Psychic is used as a reliable STAB move, while Thunderbolt is used to cover Steel- and Dark-types. Encore is a good choice if you wish to cripple an opponent, locking them into a support or non-attacking move, Focus Blast hits Steel-, Rock-, Normal-, and Dark-types super effectively, and Baton Pass is used to escape Pursuit users and pass Nasty Plot Boosts.</p> <p>This set may use both abilities, as they both have their good points. Soundproof is a good choice as it stops Pokemon with Roar from removing Mr. Mime's stat boosts, while Filter means that Mr. Mime takes less damage from super effective attacks. Soundproof is the superior choice when using Baton Pass, as this allows Mr. Mime to pass boosts to teammates without the risk of losing the boosts, while Filter is better when you use any other option as Mr. Mime doesn't have a way to escape Pursuit users, and this will weaken the blow.</p> <p>Chansey and Clefable cause Mr. Mime problems due to their huge HP and Special Defense stats. A Fighting-type like Hitmontop is an excellent teammate due to its high Attack stat and STAB Close Combat. Mixed sweepers like Magmortar are also great as they can catch the aforementioned special walls off guard with special moves, then hit them with a super effective Cross Chop.</p> <p>Again, Spiritomb walls this set well due to its huge defenses. Toxic Spikes are helpful to Mr. Mime as they drain Spiritomb's health. Qwilfish is a good lead to set these up due to its high Speed and access to Taunt and Explosion. Houndoom is usable as it resists Dark- and Ghost-type moves, and can switch into Will-O-Wisp thanks to Flash Fire. Spiritomb also has trouble getting past Chansey and Clefable due to their high defenses and access to status moves.</p>"

  "Articuno": {
    "overview": "<p>With its sheer bulk and excellent support movepool, Articuno definitely lives up to its reputation as one of the legendary birds. Unfortunately, its Ice / Flying typing gives it a 4x weakness to Rock-type moves, including the ubiquitous Stealth Rock, which removes 50% of Articuno's health upon entry. Despite this disadvantage, Articuno's enormous base 125 Special Defense and respectable base 90 HP give it more than enough reason to be considered when making a team. It also makes an incredible team player since it has access to Heal Bell, allowing it to remove status ailments from fellow teammates. Articuno reaches a modest Speed of 295, enough to outspeed a respectable amount of Pokemon, and to Pressure stall opposing teams with Toxic and Substitute.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Besides what has already been mentioned, there aren't a lot of other options. Articuno has usable Speed and Special Attack stats, which could work on a Life Orb set with a moveset of Ice Beam / Hidden Power Flying / Roost / Ancient Power. As for support options, Articuno can use Haze to remove stat boosts from slower opponents, such as Curse Registeel or Calm Mind Slowbro, or set up Sunny Day or Rain Dance for a teammate. However, Pokemon such as Registeel and Uxie can also set up weather, and have the advantage of not being weak to Stealth Rock. A RestTalk set could be used with Ice Beam and Roar, but Articuno's Stealth Rock weakness severely hampers its effectiveness.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Articuno lacks a solid offensive movepool, meaning there are plenty of Pokemon that can comfortably switch into its attacks. However, due to its ability to function as a great Toxic staller, Articuno lacks many solid counters. Steel-types in general have little to fear as they are immune to Toxic, take pitiful damage from Ice Beam, and can severely dent Articuno with super effective Steel- or Rock-type moves, such as Iron Head and Stone Edge. Electric-type Pokemon such as Rotom and Manectric outspeed Articuno and can either use Substitute to block an incoming Toxic or fire off Thunderbolts. Encore users such as Clefable, who is also immune to Toxic, can cause severe problems for Articuno, locking it into one move for several turns. Opposing sweepers can take advantage of such opportunities to set up on Articuno; alternatively, bulky walls can cripple Articuno with a status-inducing move, such as Toxic or Thunder Wave.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "SubRoost": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to utilize Articuno's excellent natural bulk and great Speed to stall opposing Pokemon. The idea is to come into an attack that Articuno resists or takes little damage from, force a switch, and get a Substitute up. From there, use Toxic on the opponent and outstall it using a combination of Roost and Substitute. Taking Articuno's ability Pressure into account, the opponent will likely run out of PP before it manages to KO Articuno. Steel-types are immune to Toxic so there is no point in trying to outstall them unless they have moves with low PP. Poison-types are immune as well, although most Poison-type Pokemon have secondary typings that are weak to Ice. For example, Venusaur, probably the most common Poison-type Pokemon in the metagame, is outsped and destroyed by Articuno's Ice Beam. Other Pokemon that are immune to Toxic, such as Toxicroak, are mostly fragile and can be taken out with relative ease.</p> <p>The given Speed EVs enable Articuno to outspeed base 80 Speed Pokemon, such as Venusaur, Blaziken, and Life Orb Milotic. This allows it to switch in regardless of whether Stealth Rock is up and Roost off any damage. 248 HP EVs can be considered as they allow Articuno to switch into Stealth Rock more than twice.</p> <p>Steel-types cause problems for Articuno as they are immune to Toxic and resistant to Ice Beam. Bulky Fighting- and Ground-types such as Hitmontop and Donphan make excellent teammates since they both have access to Rapid Spin to remove the lethal Stealth Rock, as well as powerful STAB moves to deal with Steel-types.</p>"
      },
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Articuno has enough bulk to support its team efficiently. With access to Heal Bell, it can heal itself and its fellow teammates of status ailments. Heal Bell also complements Articuno's ability to stall other Pokemon with Roost and its ability, Pressure. Toxic is an alternative to Heal Bell and is great for dismantling bulky walls such as Chansey and Milotic, forcing them to switch out. Ice Beam is Articuno's sole reliable STAB move and has great overall coverage. Roar is especially annoying if your team can provide Articuno with entry hazard support. As it shuffles the opponent's team, it allows you to scout as well as rack up residual damage.</p> <p>Due to Articuno's typing, it lacks the ability to switch into most physical attacks. For this reason, bolstering its Defense stat is often a futile task. Investing 252 EVs into Articuno's Special Defense stat, on the other hand, allows it to be a great tank and sponge almost any special attack with ease. Articuno is also helpful against Rain Dance teams as both Ludicolo and Gorebyss fail to 2HKO it.</p> <p>This set appreciates entry hazards to maximize Roar's effectiveness. Donphan and Rhyperior make good teammates as they both have excellent Defense, a resistance to Rock-type moves, and the ability to set up Stealth Rock. Light Screen and Reflect are decent alternatives for the fourth moveslot, as they can help sweepers set up with greater ease.</p>"

  "Moltres": {
    "overview": "<p>Even with Stealth Rock littering the battlefield in every match, Moltres sits firmly as one of the top Pokemon in UU. Its plentiful movepool, well allocated stats, and useful resistances are a lethal combination that gives Moltres the tools it needs to tear through teams with ease. Whether it be stalling, supporting, or Choice sweeping, Moltres is capable of performing its role time and time again.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Moltres, the aforementioned Stealth Rock swiftly clips its wings. Losing 50% every switch in is extremely hazardous, meaning Moltres must rely heavily upon its teammates to reach its full potential. Team support must be taken into account when considering Moltres for your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Agility or Taliwind can be used on the Life Orb set over Roost to allow for a more fluid sweep late game once Moltres has done its fair share of damage, though having a way to get back the 50% health lost to Stealth Rock damage is much more useful. The lack of recovery also means you must plan your moves carefully, otherwise Life Orb and Stealth Rock will quickly end Moltres's life before a sweep can even begin. Safeguard can be paired up with U-turn if you're in desperate need of status protection, but it's not really the niche Moltres fits in. Extrasensory deserves a mention, but has redundant coverage with more powerful moves in Moltres's arsenal. Roar can also be used on more defensive sets, possibly even over Toxic on the staller set. Roar can help scout the opposing team and build up residual damage for when foes switch out in fear of getting PP stalled. Will-O-Wisp can also work on more defensive sets to cripple physical attackers. Protect deserves a mention as a possible move on stalling sets, as it allows both for Leftovers recovery and a turn to scout your opponent's strategies. Ancient Power can be used to quickly take out opposing Moltres and Charizard, but does not have much use outside of that.</p> <p>Speed EVs can be added or taken from sets depending on what Pokemon you would like to outspeed. Some important benchmarks: 227 (neutral nature, 44 Speed EVs) outruns minimum Speed Uxie and Drapion, 243 (neutral nature, 108 Speed EVs) outruns most common Blaziken, 270 (neutral nature, 216 Speed EVs) outruns 252 EVs neutral natured Nidoking and Toxicroak, 288 (positive nature, 184 EVs) outruns all Milotic and Blaziken, 301 (positive nature, 232 EVs) outruns Hitmonlee and 252 EVs neutral natured Charizard, and 306 (max Speed) at worst ties with opposing Moltres.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Speeds: 423 (positive nature, 164 EVs) outruns Adamant Torterra after a Rock Polish, and 450 (positive nature, 228 EVs) outruns Modest Scarf Typhlosion and Charizard.</p> <p>Remember, if you're using a Moltres without Leftovers, making the HP odd means that Moltres can switch into Stealth Rock twice and survive with one HP, given that it has not taken any previous hits. If using a simple 252 SpA / 252 Spe spread, the extra four EVs are better placed into Defense or Special Defense.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>If you haven't caught the drift by now, the main thing keeping Moltres from being a total team wrecker is Stealth Rock. As long as you set them up, and have something that outspeeds it, Moltres's wings are clipped.</p> <p>Besides Stealth Rock, Moltres really isn't interested in battling bulky Water-types, most notably Milotic with its excellent Special Defense, and Lanturn, with an additional resistance to Air Slash. RestTalk versions of bulky Water-types can both take hits from Life Orb sets and stall the Sub Toxic set. Azumarill and Kabutops can switch in on Fire moves and a couple of Air Slashes and threaten an Aqua Jet. Water-types are reliable initial switch-ins, but Hidden Power Grass (or Solar Beam on the Sunny Day set) can deal heavy damage to them.</p> <p>Chansey always remains as a huge obstacle to special attackers. Chansey can cripple the Life Orb version with paralysis and wear it out, or stall Fire Blast out of PP if it comes in healthy (above 70%). Chansey will easily be forced out by the Staller set with poison or stalled out of Seismic Tosses. It is not an easy battle for either Pokemon, as Chansey must predict when Substitutes will be set up in order to status Moltres, and Moltres must predict the same. Clefable's ability prevents poison damage, and can Soft-Boiled away Flamethrowers quite easily.</p> <p>Altaria can take most of Moltres's attacks with its high Special Defense and Roost off the damage. From there, it can Heal Bell poison status away, set up Dragon Dances, or even use Perish Song to force the Sub Toxic set out. Be careful though, because even specially defensive Altaria can be 2HKOed by Air Slash after Stealth Rock damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Moltres is one of the most fearsome special attackers in the Underused metagame, capable of OHKOing and 2HKOing the vast majority of the tier with its powerful STAB moves and excellent type coverage. Fire Blast is one of Moltres's strongest moves. To show the power of Moltres's STAB Life Orb Fire Blast, a standard Chansey takes an average of 70% from two Fire Blasts, meaning with support from entry hazards and previous attacks, Moltres taking out the pink blob is a very probable scenario. Air Slash is a great STAB move that is able to quickly take out Fighting-types, in addition to being a great late-game attack due to its high PP and 30% flinch rate. Hidden Power Grass complements Moltres's STAB moves nicely, hitting both Rock- and Water-types very hard. Hidden Power Grass can also OHKO the lesser seen Water/Ground-types Quagsire and Gastrodon. Roost is a great move for Moltres because it can replenish health lost from Life Orb recoil and Stealth Rock (though Moltres should only be switching into Stealth Rock as a last resort), aiding Moltres to further blast away at the opposing team. Roost, coupled with Moltres's Pressure ability, can be used to stall out the PP of moves from weak attackers.</p> <p>Life Orb is the preferred option for this set because it pushes Moltres's power to incredible levels. However, if you prefer durability over power, Leftovers is a fine option. Moltres has the ability to counter Fighting-, Grass-, and opposing Fire-types with its decent defenses and Speed, and Leftovers helps Moltres switch in more easily.</p> <p>The given EVs allow Moltres to deal as much damage as possible while still keeping an eye on threats. An alternate spread containing 200 Speed EVs ensure Moltres outspeeds Modest Magmortar, and the 52 extra EVs should be allocated to HP to help Moltres endure retaliation hits from Pokemon who can handle a hit from Moltres, such as Arcanine.</p> <p>Hitmontop is excellent as both an offensive and defensive partner for Moltres. Hitmontop is one of UU's most reliable Spinners with the Foresight + Rapid Spin combination, freeing Moltres of its worst enemy, Stealth Rock. In addition, Hitmontop has the ability to come in on and threaten many Pokemon who are able to withstand Moltres's assaults, such as Chansey, specially defensive Clefable, and Regirock. Furthermore, Hitmontop can take the Rock attacks aimed at Moltres. Moltres also appreciates having a Pokemon to take Water attacks. Grass Pokemon such as Venusaur can switch in with ease on Water-types with their high Special Defense and retaliate with Grass attacks and status moves. Lanturn also makes a great partner, stopping both Water- and Electric-type attacks from ruining Moltres.</p> <p>For offensive partners, Pursuit users work well with their ability to scare off Chansey. After taking some Pursuit damage, Moltres can proceed to blast away one of UU's toughest special walls, freeing its own sweep. Steelix is a notable partner, in that it can take Rock- and Electric-attacks with impunity, set up Stealth Rock for Moltres, and Explode on Water-types, paving the way for heavy Moltres hits. Steelix is also a great switch-in to Chansey. Dugtrio can trap both Chansey and Regirock, giving Moltres a much easier time sweeping.</p> <p>For a Modest nature, 26 IVs in Attack and 30 IVs in Special Attack is necessary for a maximum Base Power Hidden Power Grass. For a Timid nature, two IVs in Attack and 30 IVs in Special Attack is necessary.</p>"
      },
      "Toxic Stall": {
        "description": "<p>Moltres can also play the role of an extremely annoying staller, aided significantly in this role by its Pressure ability. It can switch in easily on pretty much any purely physical attacker with a base Speed of 80 or below (most notably Absol), and is one of the most reliable counters to Blaziken available. Once it's in, it can proceed to stall out much of an opponent's team, as many of the most intuitive \"counters\" won't actually help much at all. For example, Regirock can be easily stalled out of Stone Edge PP all too quickly thanks to Roost and Pressure. Chansey can Seismic Toss its Substitutes away, but needs good prediction to hit Moltres with status. Otherwise, it will gladly sit there eating away Seismic Toss' PP with Pressure, as it will have inevitably hit Chansey with a status move that will eat away its HP as well.</p> <p>Flamethrower and Toxic are Moltres's best options for stalling, although it does have a few other options at its disposal. Air Slash can be paired with Will-O-Wisp for a set designed to counter physical threats. However, Arcanine outclasses Moltres in this role, especially with Intimidate and a lesser Stealth Rock weakness.</p> <p>Since Stealth Rock is extremely detrimental to this Moltres's ability to switch in on physical attacks, it is absolutely vital to have Rapid Spin support. Hitmontop is probably the best means of this, as using Claydol or Donphan would mean having two defensive team members with a Water weakness. Dugtrio is another excellent means of team support, as it can trap and kill many Pokemon whom this Moltres tends to fear. Getting entry hazards on the field makes Moltres's job that much easier, the greatest for this set being Toxic Spikes.</p> <p>You can go one step further in preventing Stealth Rock by adding a Taunter in your lead spot. Ambipom, Sharpedo, and Houndoom are all capable of helping Moltres, although the latter two share more strategy with Moltres than Ambipom. Houndoom can lure out many of Moltres's common counters, like Milotic, thanks to their common type, Fire. Once these threats are gone, Moltres is free to set up and start stalling. You'll need another Pokemon besides Houndoom to dispose of these threats, however, making Toxicroak another great teammate. Sharpedo tends to lure out Grass-types, like Venusaur, giving Moltres the chance to switch in on a resisted attack and set up a Substitute as they switch out. It should also be noted that the given EV spread allows Moltres to outpace many common variants of Venusaur.</p>"
      },
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>Moltres is able to utilize Choice items effectively due to its type coverage, excellent Special Attack, and decent Speed. Fire Blast is always a great move on Moltres, but Flamethrower is a reliable and acceptable move on Choiced Moltres due to the power of Choice Specs or the sweeping ability of the Choice Scarf set. Air Slash is another great STAB move. The choice of Hidden Power is much different on a Choice set because of the lack of versatility and/or power. Hidden Power Grass is probably the best option with its ability to hit Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types very hard, making it a very good general attack for hitting Moltres's counters. Hidden Power Ice is useful on the Choice Scarf set for revenge killing Dragon Dance Altaria, but other than that it does not have much use. U-turn is a fun move to have, wearing down counters and scouting the opposing team by forcing switches. Overheat is available to deliver a fierce blow stronger than a SpecsMence Draco Meteor on anything without the Flash Fire ability. Choice sets are usually used in a hit-and-run manner, and the significant power drop from Overheat reflects that.</p> <p>A Choice Scarf set with U-turn always makes an effective lead due to its scouting ability and a bit of a surprise factor. Stealth Rock also gets up rather early in the game, so Moltres is free from it on the first turn. Moltres can also scare off Registeel and Steelix leads with its Fire STAB, and prevent Stealth Rock from getting down early. Moltres does not care about opposing Trick Scarf leads like Uxie and Mesprit, and can proceed to wear down the bulky Psychics, either by U-turning or attacking right away. The Choice Specs set does not make Moltres as effective as a lead, but the boost makes Moltres a monstrous attacker capable of taking out many of its counters, provided you use the correct attack. As with any Choice user, keen prediction is needed in order to both blast holes in the opposing team, and conserve Moltres's HP from unnecessary Stealth Rock damage. Be careful about abusing U-turn when Stealth Rock is set up, though, as each switch in will rob it of 50% of its health.</p> <p>A Rapid Spinner is absolutely necessary for a Choice item wielding Moltres, because it loses the ability to Roost and possible Leftovers recovery. Other noteworthy Spinners besides Hitmontop are Claydol, Donphan, and Blastoise. Claydol and Donphan can take Electric and Rock attacks nicely and also can set up Stealth Rock. Blastoise can take Stone Edges from Ground-types, but other than that it doesn't help Moltres much as far as type coverage goes. These Spinners mentioned are not as useful as Hitmontop as a partner, but Spinners are difficult to come by and Choice Scarf or Choice Specs Moltres definitely needs it.</p> <p>With a Modest nature, 26 IVs in Attack and 30 IVs in Special Attack is necessary for a maximum Base Power Hidden Power Grass. For a Timid nature, 2 IVs in Attack and 30 IVs in Special Attack is necessary. If you opt for Hidden Power Ice, 22 IVs in Attack and 30 IVs in Defense is necessary for maximum Base Power. If you're using a Modest nature, 10 IVs in Attack and 30 IVs in Defense is necessary.</p>"

      "Sunny Day": {
        "description": "<p>Sunny Day was one of Moltres's best options in Gen 3. Thanks to the improvements in Moltres's movepool and item choices, it is more commonly seen using a Life Orb, using Choice items, and even stalling. Therefore, many doubt the old Sunny Day set's potential. Sunny Day is still an effective option in the UU metagame and if the conditions are right, Moltres will crush the opposition.</p> <p>Sunny Day benefits Moltres in various ways. Firstly, the shining sun will boost the power of Moltres's STAB moves to the power Choice Specs provides. With a Life Orb, Moltres can actually do more damage with Fire-type moves than if it was using Choice Specs. Secondly, it allows Moltres to use a stronger Grass-type attack in the form of Solar Beam. While some Water Pokemon can switch in on Hidden Power Grass and recover off the damage, Solar Beam will deal a lot more damage and can take down Pokemon other sets struggle with. For example, a defensive Milotic will only take around 35% damage from a Life Orb Hidden Power Grass on average; Solar Beam will 2HKO the same Milotic. And thirdly, the sun will make Moltres neutral to Water. Water is a common type in UU, and most Moltres will be under threat by Pokemon such as Azumarill. By removing this weakness, in conjunction with Solar Beam, Moltres is much more adept in taking out Water Pokemon than other sets.</p> <p>Fire Blast is the primary option for a STAB move, but Flamethrower can be used if the accuracy worries you. Roost is useful for the ability to remove its Electric weakness and soften Rock attacks, but Morning Sun can prove efficient as it recovers 66% health in the sun. Air Slash is mainly put in because Moltres's movepool is fairly limited. It can allow Moltres to use the flinch rate to fight its way past slower opponents. Air Slash isn't necessarily needed, as Fire Blast will do a ton of damage on most Fighting-types. If the sun is shining, a Modest Life Orb Fire Blast will OHKO Adamant Hitmontop and Rash Blaziken, and has a chance of OHKOing Mild Blaziken. It is still a nice move to hit Hariyama super effectively and Fire-types for neutral damage.</p> <p>The item choice is rather tricky. With a Life Orb, Moltres can pack an extremely powerful punch with all its attacks. However, Heat Rock allows Moltres and its teammates to utilize the benefits of the sun for a few more turns. If you have another Pokemon around to set up sun, Life Orb is the superior option.</p> <p>Moltres is a great asset to Sunny Day teams, thanks to a high base Speed and powerful STAB Fire attacks coming off of 125 base Special Attack. If you are using Moltres in a Sunny Day team, it is ideal to have a Pokemon who can quickly set it up. Ambipom can run Sunny Day, as most people expect a standard lead and Sunny Day can be summoned easily, thanks to the element of surprise. If Moltres is using Sunny Day, having some team members that can take advantage of it will be helpful. Tangrowth can use the sun to activate Chlorophyll, doubling its Speed, very helpful when attempting a sweep. Tangrowth also has good defensive synergy with Moltres, easily taking Electric-type attacks aimed at Moltres.</p>"
      },
      "SubRoost": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to fuse Moltres's ability to sweep with its ability to stall. Common problems Moltres encounters when sweeping in the UU tier are Chansey and bulky Waters. With Toxic Spikes support, Moltres can use Substitute to stall these Pokemon to their deaths while avoiding status ailments. On the offensive side, Moltres has great coverage with its dual STAB, which is resisted only by Lanturn and Rock-types like Rhyperior and Regirock. However, most Rock-types in UU use Stone Edge as their STAB attack, which leaves them vulnerable to SubRoost Pressure stalling.</p> <p>Fire Blast and Air Slash are obviously Moltres's dual STABs and hit very hard if unresisted. Flamethrower can be used instead of Fire Blast if you're concerned about accuracy. Substitute and Roost allow Moltres to stall out potential counters like Milotic and Chansey.</p> <p>Timid is the preferred nature to ensure Moltres outspeeds the common base 80 Speed Pokemon, including Venusaur and Blaziken, as well as other Pokemon like Hitmonlee and Toxicroak. However, Modest is still a decent option since it lets Moltres take full advantage of its massive Special Attack stat. Life Orb is the preferred item on this set, as it elevates Moltres's power to massive heights and allows it to 2HKO enemies like Slowbro. Leftovers can also be used to provide more survivability, especially when creating Substitutes; however, the loss of power against neutral targets will be noticeable.</p> <p>Just like against offensive Moltres, Milotic and Chansey can cause this Moltres problems if you use Substitute and Roost at the wrong times. Toxic Spikes are crucial to let Moltres stall them out. Cloyster is a good Toxic Spikes user to use alongside Moltres, as it can easily take Aqua Jet and Waterfall aimed at Moltres while spinning away Stealth Rock. Nidoqueen can switch into Rock attacks aimed at Moltres and proceed to set up Toxic Spikes and Stealth Rock. Venomoth is a good Toxic Spiking lead, as it can incapacitate the opposing lead with Sleep Powder to prevent Stealth Rock from being set up while setting up Toxic Spikes of its own. However, keeping Toxic Spikes up in UU is easier said than done due to the large number of viable grounded Poison-types and proficient Rapid Spinners. Fortunately, most grounded Poison types can be trapped and killed by Dugtrio, while Venusaur (the only one who isn't weak to Ground) hates to switch into Moltres's powerful attacks. Dugtrio can also trap and remove Chansey. To block Rapid Spin, Spiritomb, bulky Mismagius, and bulky Rotom can be used.</p> <p>Offensive partners who pair well with Moltres include Venusaur, who can switch into RestTalk Milotic (possibly the best counter for this Moltres) and set up Swords Dance for a sweep. Swords Dance Leafeon works in a similar manner. Notable Spinners who can be partnered with Moltres (other than Cloyster) include Hitmontop, who can take Rock attacks with ease while utilizing the reliable Foresight + Rapid Spin combination that only a double-Ghost strategy can stop. Donphan is also a reliable Rapid Spinner, capable of taking Rock attacks with impunity while dealing with Levitating Ghost-type switch-ins with Assurance and Spiritomb with Earthquake.</p>"

  "Meganium": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Meganium is outclassed by Venusaur in most areas, it does have a few things going for it, namely its greater physical bulk, useful Ground-type resistance, dual screens, and Aromatherapy. Sadly, its movepool is shallow, and it has less Special Attack, a lack of secondary STAB, and no access to Sleep Powder. Despite these flaws, Meganium can still play as a useful supporter or an unexpected sweeper in place of Venusaur due to its unique traits. Just don't play Meganium like an inferior Venusaur and you'll have a capable Pokemon in your hands.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Meganium could use an SubSeed set, but since Meganium has no reliable way of attacking enemy Grass-type attacks outside of Hidden Power, the idea is moot. There are several Hidden Powers that can be useful. Hidden Power Ice can be used to dent opposing Grass-types and Altaria; Hidden Power Fire can burn Bug-, Grass-, and Steel-types; and Hidden Power Rock can smash Bug-, Flying-, and Fire-types. Meganium could also use a Flail set, though with all the priority attacks in the tier, it will be very easy to take Meganium out. Counter is also usable, because Meganium has a high Defense stat as well as access to Synthesis to take repeated hits and heal the damage off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fire-type Pokemon such as Blaziken, Houndoom, and Arcanine are great counters to Meganium. If you are using Houndoom for countering Meganium, beware of Earthquake because it will always OHKO after Stealth Rock. You also can use Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon to counter it due to their resistance to Grass-type moves. Good examples include Toxicroak, Weezing, and Registeel. Venusaur is one of the best counters to Meganium due to its immunity to both Leech Seed and Toxic, while also quad-resisting Meganium's STAB attack. Other Grass-type Pokemon such as Leafeon and Tangrowth do well thanks to their high Defense stat; Leafeon can freely set up Swords Dances and then fire off deadly Double-Edges while Tangrowth can put Meganium to sleep with Sleep Powder. Flying-type Pokemon such as Scyther, Swellow, Moltres, and Altaria can all defeat Meganium easily as well thanks to their resistance to Grass-type moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>With great physical bulk and access to Aromatherapy, Meganium can successfully fend off dangerous physical threats such as Azumarill, Feraligatr, and Donphan while clearing your team of status. Energy Ball is a reliable STAB move on the special side, but Seed Bomb can be used instead to break the Substitutes of physically frail Pokemon such as Mismagius. Synthesis helps Meganium recover lost health, which is very useful for any supporting Pokemon. In the last slot, Leech Seed is helpful for sapping the opponent's health while restoring Meganium's own health; it can also help your switch-in regenerate some health should your opponent stay in. Toxic can be used over Leech Seed in order for Meganium to cripple Pokemon whom it would not normally threaten, such as Tangrowth, Arcanine, and Moltres.</p> <p>Meganium's most common counters are hard-hitting Fire-types, so bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Milotic make great teammates. Milotic is also the best defensive teammate to pair up with Meganium, as they can defeat most of each other's counters. Meganium is a great lure for Swellow and Scyther, so take advantage of this by using Pokemon who can set up on them, such as Rhyperior, Aggron, and Registeel. The 4 Speed EVs are just enough Speed to outpace Rhyperior before it uses Rock Polish.</p> <p>Meganium can use Grass Knot over Energy Ball to hit heavier Pokemon such as Milotic and Rhyperior with higher Base Power, but don't expect either to be staying in on Meganium. Light Screen could be used over Aromatherapy to protect Meganium and its team from special attacks if status isn't a concern. By using Light Screen, Meganium has more chances to use Leech Seed or Toxic on foes whom it would otherwise have to switch out on.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>Meganium's sturdy defenses make it a great dual screens user, and once it has the right screen up, it will be taking minimal damage from most attacks, even super effective ones. Energy Ball is a reliable STAB move to attack with, and also makes sure that Meganium is not completely shut down by Taunt. Seed Bomb is an option to hit specially bulky Pokemon for more damage. If Seed Bomb is the chosen option, an Impish nature should be used. Synthesis allows Meganium to preserve its HP throughout the match and have more chances to set up dual screens. Aromatherapy is also a good option to heal your team of status; however, Meganium's longevity is greatly affected since it will be running neither Leftovers nor Synthesis.</p> <p>Grass Knot is a good option over Energy Ball to hit heavier foes, but Energy Ball is more consistent, making it the better choice in most situations. Meganium is weak to Bug-, Fire-, Ice-, and Flying-type attacks, so Pokemon who can set up on those attacks will greatly benefit from Meganium's support. For example, Dragon Dance Feraligatr and Swords Dance Blaziken are great teammates, both resist Fire- and Ice-type attacks while the latter also resists Bug-type attacks. Rock Polish Rhyperior and Aggron also have good synergy with Meganium, and will definitely benefit from Meganium's support. Pokemon with Taunt can shut down Meganium, preventing it from performing its job, while also being able to set up in the process. Mismagius is a good example, having access to Taunt, Calm Mind, and Nasty Plot, so packing a Pokemon such as Drapion in your team can help eliminate Mismagius with Pursuit.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>With this set, Meganium's goal is to switch into an attack it resists, set up a Swords Dance, and smash through the opposition. However, this set plays more like a stallbreaker, as the lackluster investment in Speed will only allow Meganium to outpace slow walls. Swords Dance is the main focus of this set, boosting Meganium's 264 Attack to a more reasonable 528. Synthesis gives Meganium a form of instant recovery, which allows it more chances to set up Swords Dances. If you feel that Synthesis is unnecessary, then Substitute can be a valuable replacement so that Meganium can block status, which gives it more opportunities to set up Swords Dance. The choice between Earthquake and Return is a tough one. Earthquake allows Meganium to hit most of its most common counters such as Steel- and Fire-type Pokemon for super effective damage, while Return gives it greater overall type coverage, hitting almost all Pokemon in UU for neutral damage.</p> <p>If another coverage move is necessary, then Meganium can forgo Synthesis and Substitute and instead use Earthquake or Return (whichever move is not being used in the last slot). Faster Fire-type Pokemon who take little damage from Meganium's attacks, such as Arcanine and Moltres, are troublesome. Meganium greatly benefits from bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Milotic or Blastoise in order to get rid of such threats. Weezing can also counter this set well due to its great physical bulk; moreover, it can break Meganium's Substitute with Flamethrower or burn it if it lacks Substitute. Strong Fire-type Pokemon such as Houndoom and Arcanine can help stop Weezing. Aromatherapy may be used over Substitute and Synthesis to cure Meganium and its teammates of status. Life Orb can be used over Leftovers for more power, but the bulk gained from Leftovers is important. The EV spread maximizes Meganium's bulk, which means that it can set up Swords Dance much more easily. 136 Speed EVs allow Meganium to reach 230 Speed, outspeeding all Pokemon with a base Speed of 60 and below. The remaining EVs are dumped into Attack for more power.</p>"

  "Typhlosion": {
    "overview": "<p>With a high Special Attack stat, a great Speed stat, and a wide variety of attacking options, Typhlosion is a powerhouse in UU. He's one of those Fire-types that you'd use on a Sunny Day team but he can still function outside of them. Typhlosion is also exceptional at abusing Choice items. Despite being incredibly powerful, Typhlosion is not without weaknesses. He lacks specific otherwise important coverage moves, and has to rely on Hidden Power Rock for coverage against opposing Fire-types. Also, Typhlosion is quite difficult to use due to his Stealth Rock weakness, and is relatively easy to counter if you know his set. While Typhlosion faces stiff competition from Moltres, his superior Speed and lesser weakness to Stealth Rock along with access to Eruption are enough to differentiate him from the fire phoenix. If you want a powerful Sunny Day sweeper or a useful Choice Scarf user, you should give Typhlosion a chance. A well-played Typhlosion is capable of demolishing entire teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Typhlosion is capable of running a Substitute and Petaya Berry set which possesses devastating power when fully set up, but it's usually outclassed by the Sunny Day set, which does the same thing without whittling down Typhlosion's health and still being walled by bulky Water-types. Extrasensory can be used on any set and is useful against Fighting-types who are resistant to Fire-type moves like Blaziken and Thick Fat Hariyama. Typhlosion has a surprisingly large physical movepool, with gems like Flare Blitz, Howl, Thunder Punch, and Earthquake, and is thus capable of running a physical sweeper set. However, that set is completely outclassed by Arcanine, who boasts more bulk, power, and priority.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Chansey is easily the best Typhlosion counter in the UU metagame. She can switch into nearly anything he can dish out and cripple him with status or wear him down with Seismic Toss. Chansey is 2HKOed by sun-boosted Eruption at full power, but that is a pretty rare circumstance. Specially defensive Arcanine is an incredible counter to Sunny Day Typhlosion. Arcanine can easily sponge any of Typhlosion's attacks, and can wear him down with status. He also gets a boost from Sunny Day, giving him an even greater advantage. However, Arcanine should watch out for Hidden Power Rock, which has a decent chance of 2HKOing Arcanine if Stealth Rock is in play. Specially defensive Altaria is also a good counter to Typhlosion. He's similar to Arcanine in that he can take everything Typhlosion can throw at him and cripple him with status, but he should also be wary of Hidden Power Rock, which has a chance to 2HKO after Stealth Rock damage. Bulky Water-types like Milotic and Slowking are decent checks to Typhlosion provided that the sun isn't up. Water-types in general should watch out for Sunny Day, which not only allows Typhlosion to effectively use Solar Beam, but also decreases the power of their Water-type moves. Thick Fat Hariyama is another incredible counter to Typhlosion, as he can easily take a sun-boosted Fire Blast and weaken Typhlosion with his STAB Fighting-type moves. Regirock is also a decent check to Typhlosion, but it should watch out for Solar Beam, which deals a fair amount of damage.</p> <p>Choiced sets are easier to counter than other sets. All of the above counters apply, and now bulky Water-types are more than capable of switching into Typhlosion, as the worst thing they have to fear is Hidden Power Grass. Typhlosion is even checked by Flash Fire users like Houndoom, who can switch in on a Fire-type move and nail Typhlosion as he switches out with Pursuit. While it may only happen once in a blue moon, you should be wary of Choice Specs max power Eruption in the sun, which can quite literally 2HKO all of the counters listed here, barring Houndoom. In general, Stealth Rock makes Typhlosion significantly easier to deal with as it strips off 25% of his health, limiting the number of times he can switch into battle and weakening Eruption if he's using it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sunny Day Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set can be devastating when used correctly. Sunny Day boosts Typhlosion's Fire-type moves to incredible levels, allowing Typhlosion to deal heavy damage to Pokemon that don't outright resist them. Fire Blast is Typhlosion's STAB move of choice and is quite strong initially, but is even more ridiculous when the sun is out. To put it into perspective, even the standard Chansey is capable of being 2HKOed by a sun boosted Fire Blast with some residual damage. Solar Beam allows Typhlosion to beat common bulky Water-types like Milotic and Slowbro. Sun also reduces the damage taken from of Water-type moves, allowing Typhlosion to reliably beat Slowbro and Milotic without taking heavy damage from their attacks. In addition, Solar Beam allows Typhlosion to bypass bulky Rock-types like Omastar and Regirock, however the latter needs residual damage in order to be OHKOed by Solar Beam. Hidden Power Rock is used for damaging opposing Fire-types like Moltres, Houndoom, and Arcanine who would completely wall Typhlosion otherwise.</p> <p>Here are some damage calculations to demonstrate Typhlosion's power:</p> <ul> <li>Solar Beam vs. 252/0 Milotic: 63.1% - 74.3%</li> <li>Solar Beam vs. 252/0 Blastoise: 79.6% - 93.9%</li> <li>Solar Beam vs. 252/220 Regirock: 61% - 72%</li> <li>Fire Blast (sun) vs. 0/252 Chansey: 39.9% - 47.2%</li> <li>Fire Blast (sun) vs. 252/100 Clefable: 76.1% - 89.8%</li> <li>Bold 0 SpA Milotic Surf (Sun) vs. Typhlosion: 38.4% - 45.1%</li> </ul> <p>While Life Orb is the more reliable item, Heat Rock can be used to extend the number of turns sun stays on the field. The extended turns can also help out Typhlosion's teammates should you choose to run Pokemon who also receive a boost from the sun. Max Special Attack EVs are used to maximize Typhlosion's damage potential. Maximizing Speed is not recommended because Hidden Power Rock drops Typhlosion's Speed stat by 1. Instead, 220 Speed Speed EVs are used to ensure that Typhlosion will outspeed all Pokemon with base 95 Speed. The remaining EVs are placed in Special Defense to give Typhlosion an easier time taking weak special attacks. Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast for more reliability, but it should be noted that the power difference is huge.</p> <p>Typhlosion usually struggles against specially defensive Arcanine and Altaria. Both of them are only 3HKOed by Hidden Power Rock and can wear Typhlosion down with Extreme Speed or Toxic, respectively. Thus, Omastar is a top notch partner for Typhlosion. The two Pokemon share fantastic synergy with each other and Omastar is capable of switching in on and beating the aforementioned counters or using them as setup fodder. Typhlosion massively appreciates the presence of entry hazards because they allow Typhlosion to attain key 2HKOs and OHKOs. For example, Arcanine and Altaria no longer counter Typhlosion if Stealth Rock is present on the field because they have a chance of being 2HKOed by Hidden Power Rock. Typhlosion can also 2HKO Chansey with Fire Blast in the sun if Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes are out. By abusing Typhlosion's ability to easily force switches, you can continually wear down the opponent's team until they are in KO range.</p> <p>Blastoise is also a great partner, as he shares useful defensive synergy with Typhlosion and is capable of using Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock, significantly increasing Typhlosion's staying power. Offensively, Azumarill is recommended due to her ability to take on Typhlosion's counters, as well as the fact that she greatly appreciates the removal of bulky Water-types. Typhlosion's ability to remove bulky Water-types like Milotic and Slowbro can greatly help offensive Pokemon like Moltres, Arcanine, Rhyperior, Feraligatr, and other Pokemon who have a hard time getting past bulky Water-types.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Typhlosion has both the Speed and the power to abuse a Choice Scarf. Eruption is Typhlosion's trademark move, a 150 Base Power Fire-type move that is capable of dealing incredible amounts of damage to most of the UU metagame. Focus Blast is used to target bulky Rock-types like Regirock and Omastar, as well as Houndoom and other Pokemon who are otherwise barely affected by Eruption. Hidden Power Rock allows Typhlosion to hurt opposing Fire-types while Hidden Power Grass targets weakened Water-types. Eruption gets progressively weaker as Typhlosion's health diminishes, and thus Fire Blast is a useful secondary move when Eruption is no longer useful, and is especially powerful if Blaze is activated. When using Choice Scarf Typhlosion, you should never lead with Eruption due to the multitude of Fire-type resistances in UU. Instead, leading with Focus Blast or Hidden Power Rock is recommended to scout for and even OHKO checks like Omastar and Houndoom.</p> <p>The EVs listed maximize Typhlosion's offensive capabilities while allowing him to outspeed most of the UU metagame. If you want Typhlosion to outspeed opposing Choice Scarf Pokemon, a Timid nature with a spread of 72 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 184 Spe allows Typhlosion to outspeed max Speed Choice Scarf Rotom, the fastest common Choice Scarf user in UU.</p> <p>The main drawback of this set is the existence of Stealth Rock. Stealth Rock lowers Eruption's power, costing Typhlosion significant sweeping ability. Keeping Typhlosion at maximum health is definitely required to get the most out of this set. It is highly recommended that you run a Rapid Spin user alongside Typhlosion. Not only does it keep Eruption at peak power, but it also allows him to switch into battle more times. Dedicated spinners like Hitmontop and Blastoise are fine partners for Typhlosion. Blastoise and Typhlosion share decent synergy with each other and, as a bonus, Blastoise is able to use Foresight to bypass any Ghost-types attempting to block Rapid Spin.</p> <p>Unfortunately, even keeping entry hazards off the field alone will not guarantee that this set will succeed. Pokemon like Milotic and Arcanine are capable of walling Typhlosion's attacks and blocking his attempts at sweeping regardless. Both Pokemon are easily capable of shrugging off Hidden Power Grass and Rock, respectively. Sunny Day Regirock is a phenomenal partner to Typhlosion. It is capable of walling Arcanine, and it can lure out and OHKO bulky Water-types like Milotic and Azumarill with Explosion, giving Typhlosion an infinitely easier time at sweeping. It even supports Typhlosion by providing him with Sunny Day support, which greatly boosts the power of Eruption. Healing Wish users like Mesprit are also immensely useful partners. Should Typhlosion take damage or get afflicted by status, Healing Wish can restore Typhlosion to tip-top shape to give him another chance at sweeping. Alternatively, you can use a Pokemon who learns both Wish and Heal Bell, like Clefable and Chansey.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs, when coupled with Typhlosion's high Speed and Special Attack stats, turns it into a fearsome special attacker. Choice Specs boosts Typhlosion's already good Special Attack to incredible levels, letting his Fire-type STAB moves deal heavy damage to Pokemon that don't resist them. Overheat is extremely strong after a Choice Specs boost, allowing Typhlosion to 2HKO specially defensive Clefable even after the Special Attack drop. Only dedicated special walls and Pokemon who resist Overheat can safely switch in. Eruption is only slightly stronger than Overheat, but it can be used repeatedly and has perfect accuracy. Unfortunately, a significant effort is required to keep Eruption at full power. It should be noted that the Special Attack drop after using Overheat isn't detrimental because this variant of Typhlosion is mainly used as a hit-and-run attacker.</p> <p>Focus Blast is used to deal heavy damage to bulky Rock-types like Regirock and Omastar, who take pitiful damage from Overheat. It also OHKOes Houndoom, a common check to Choice-locked Typhlosion. Hidden Power Grass is used to damage Water-types, and is strong enough to noticeably damage them. Milotic, for example, is 2HKOed by Choice Specs Hidden Power Grass after Stealth Rock damage. Hidden Power Rock is used to deal good damage to opposing Fire-types, and is useful against specially defensive Arcanine and Altaria. Fire Blast is used for dealing consistent damage where needed, while Flamethrower is weaker but more reliable. If Hidden Power Rock is used, be sure to change Typhlosion's EVs to 252 SpA / 36 SpD / 220 Spe.</p> <p>Since this set is mostly used as a hit-and-run type of Pokemon, Rapid Spin support is highly recommended to increase the number of times Typhlosion can switch in. Dedicated Rapid Spin users like Hitmontop and Blastoise are fine partners for this reason. Bulky Water-types like Milotic and specially defensive Arcanine are still a problem for this set despite the increase in power, and Typhlosion cannot hope to break through Chansey. Swords Dance Venusaur, while unconventional, is an effective partner to Typhlosion. He can easily switch into Milotic and threaten her with Power Whip, and is capable of beating Chansey due to the physical nature of his set. Venusaur is also capable of luring out and OHKOing specially defensive Arcanine with Earthquake. Dugtrio also deserves a mention due to his ability to guarantee the removal of Chansey with Arena Trap and STAB Earthquake.</p> <p>As mentioned earlier, Eruption is an option over Overheat for a more reliable, high-power move that requires greater support in order to be effective. If you do happen to use Eruption, you should ensure that your entire team is dedicated to supporting Typhlosion. Running a Rapid Spinner is practically required, and the ability to heal Typhlosion is also welcomed. Healing Wish users can safely restore Typhlosion to maximum health and cure him of any status ailments, giving him another chance at sweeping. Sunny Day support is also recommended when using Eruption because Typhlosion's power rises to outrageous levels under the sun. A sun-boosted Choice Specs Eruption is capable of OHKOing most of the metagame. Even the hardiest of special walls and Fire-type resists cannot deal with sun-boosted Eruption. Specially defensive Arcanine, Milotic and Chansey are all 2HKOed by Choice Specs sun-boosted Eruption. However pulling this off is easier said than done and requires extreme precision.</p>"

  "Feraligatr": {
    "overview": "<p>Feraligatr is known as the \"Gyarados of UU\" because his battling style is much the same as Gyarados's. Feraligatr has a high base 105 Attack stat, a decent Speed stat, reasonable physical bulk, and Dragon Dance to boost both his Speed and Attack at the same time. Unlike Gyarados, however, Feraligatr has access to Swords Dance and Aqua Jet, which allow him to quickly double his Attack and still pick off faster foes. The combination of power and Speed provided by both of Feraligatr's setup options easily push him into the top tier of UU sweepers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Feraligatr does have a stronger move than Waterfall in Aqua Tail; however, Waterfall is preferable for a number of reasons. Waterfall has a chance to flinch, which can help Feraligatr score some lucky 2HKOs without being hit by an attack. Aqua Tail also has a chance to miss which could end Feraligatr's sweep. Finally, Aqua Tail fails to achieve any notable OHKOs or 2HKOs in the standard UU metagame.</p> <p>Feraligatr can become a \"bulky Water\" with Rest, Sleep Talk, and defenses on par with Blastoise, but there are many other Pokemon who do this better than Feraligatr. The only advantage Feraligatr has is that he can use a RestTalk set with Dragon Dance included, allowing him to boost his stats as he sleeps and potentially sweep at the same time.</p> <p>Crunch can be used to smack bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Mismagius and Slowbro. Feraligatr can make use of a Substitute and Focus Punch set, but once again, there are Pokemon who are much better choices for this, like Poliwrath. Besides using Focus Punch, Feraligatr has another powerful Fighting-type attack he could use: Superpower. Using Superpower on Feraligatr is not recommended, as it lowers Feraligatr's Attack (which Dragon Dance and Swords Dance both boost, making it a bit of a waste) and Defense stats, leaving him vulnerable to faster physical threats or Pokemon who have access to priority moves.</p> <p>Besides Feraligatr's vast number of physical options, there are a couple of special attacks he can use on a mixed attacker set. Surf can act as a powerful STAB attack; Ancient Power has a potential six stat boost; Dragon Pulse can hit Altaria and others who resist Water-type moves; Focus Blast can be used to nail bulky Steel-types; finally, Ice Beam can be used to hurt the Grass-types who resist Feraligatr's Water-type STAB moves. Even though he has many eye-catching moves on the special side, his lackluster Special Attack stat, when compared to his Attack, makes these options unfavorable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Milotic with Haze is the best counter to any Feraligatr. She can take any attack that Feraligatr throws at her and negate any boosts he has achieved, and then proceed to either Life Orb stall or use Hidden Power Grass to get rid of him. Defensive Tangrowth and Leafeon can take any attack and KO back with their STAB Grass-type moves. Slowbro is also able to take any of Feraligatr's moves and cripple him with Thunder Wave. Priority moves are capable of ending Feraligatr's impending sweep, as are Choice Scarf users. Sceptile and offensive Venusaur can stop Swords Dance Feraligatr with their resistance to Aqua Jet and ability to OHKO him with their choice of STAB Grass-type move. Weezing can take on most sets and incapacitate Feraligatr for the rest of the match with Will-o-Wisp, while Registeel can take anything Feraligatr throws at him bar a Dragon Dance Low Kick and cripple him with Thunder Wave. Relying on status to beat Feraligatr is dangerous, however, as Feraligatr with Substitute can turn such moves into setup opportunities.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Feraligatr received a couple of new toys to play with this generation. Dragon Dance is the largest addition; it allows Feraligatr to boost both his Speed and Attack at once and then proceed to OHKO much of the UU metagame. On top of that, Waterfall became a physical STAB option to complement his higher Attack stat, dealing massive damage to many of UU's top threats. Ice Punch allows Feraligatr to smack Grass-types who resist Waterfall, Sceptile and Venusaur in particular, while Earthquake rounds off his coverage by hitting Water-types and Registeel. With Low Kick, Feraligatr can OHKO Registeel (after Stealth Rock) before it paralyzes Feraligatr, but Feraligatr loses coverage and power on Toxicroak and some Water-types such as Azumarill, Slowbro, and Slowking.</p> <p>The given EV spread allows Feraligatr to reach a Speed stat of 373 after one Dragon Dance, outrunning positive nature base 120 Speed Pokemon like Sceptile and Alakazam. Max Attack is mandatory for Feraligatr to be as threatening as possible, while the 28 HP EVs are used to add more bulk. An alternative spread of 92 HP / 252 Attack / 164 Speed with a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed Swellow and KO him with Ice Punch before he OHKOes Feraligatr with Facade; a noticeable amount of power is lost with this spread, though.</p> <p>Providing Feraligatr with dual screen support is recommended, as it will make his job as a sweeper much easier. Gardevoir and Clefable are great options since they both have decent bulk and access to Wish, which helps Feraligatr immensely in the long run. Dragon Dance Feraligatr has problems with Pokemon such as Milotic, Weezing, and Slowbro. With their great physical bulk, they can switch in on Feraligatr as he Dragon Dances and proceed to cripple him with Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, or Thunder Wave, respectively. A Pokemon such as Blaziken can pave the way for a Feraligatr sweep by weakening Milotic, Slowbro, and Weezing with his 120 Base Power STABs in Superpower and Fire Blast. Defensively, Venusaur has great synergy with Feraligatr as he can switch in on most of the Pokemon who might end his sweep and incapacitate or KO them them with Sleep Powder and Power Whip, respectively. However, Weezing still poses a problem for this combination.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Rather than boosting both Attack and Speed at once, Feraligatr is able to use Swords Dance to gain more immediate power against the Pokemon who Dragon Dance Feraligatr has trouble breaking through. STAB Waterfall off of 678 Attack is monstrous, and if Feraligatr finds himself in Torrent range, it decimates anyone who doesn't resist it. Return combines with Waterfall for neutral coverage on everyone in UU bar Shedinja. Because Waterfall and Return have near-perfect type coverage when used together, the final slot is free to be used on Aqua Jet without losing any coverage. Faster threats who otherwise would revenge kill Feraligatr, such as Mismagius, Swellow, and Alakazam, are all OHKOed by Aqua Jet if Stealth Rock is on the field.</p> <p>The Speed EVs are designed to outspeed Jolly Aggron. An Adamant nature and max Attack EVs provide the highest Attack stat Feraligatr can muster. The rest are dumped into HP to capitalize on Feraligatr's decent bulk. Alternatively, you can add some bulk and run 44 EVs in Speed to outspeed defensive Milotic in order to 2HKO her with Return.</p> <p>The teammates mentioned in the Dragon Dance set can be used with this set as well. Dual screen support becomes more useful since it allows Feraligatr to achieve more than one Swords Dance boost much easier, so Feraligatr can start a sweep with enough health to take a hit or two. Clefable is a great candidate for setting up dual screens because of her great bulk in Special Defense, meaning that she can switch in on Thunderbolt or Grass Knot aimed at Feraligatr. Entry hazard support can also be used to allow Feraligatr to score more KOs on opposing Pokemon whom he would otherwise have trouble KOing. Registeel is superb at setting up Stealth Rock with his bulk and access to crippling moves that greatly ease Feraligatr's sweep. Additionally, Pokemon around the base 80 speed tier, such as Venusaur, Kabutops, and Blaziken, give this set more trouble than they do with the Dragon Dance set. Packing solid counters for these Pokemon, such as Altaria, Tangrowth, and Slowking, can help immensely in enabling a Swords Dance Feraligatr sweep later in the match.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Substitute allows Feraligatr to work around the defensive threats who plague his other sets. Registeel lacking Seismic Toss, Milotic with Toxic but not Hidden Power Grass, and common Will-O-Wisp users such as Weezing and Spiritomb all become setup bait for Substitute Feraligatr. Once behind a Substitute, he can proceed to boost his Speed and Attack with Dragon Dance to his heart's content while recovering HP with Leftovers. As an added bonus, Substitute allows Feraligatr to push himself into Torrent range for an immensely powerful attack or two as needed. The extra power given by Torrent can provide him with the last-minute power needed to finish a sweep.</p> <p>Feraligatr's physical bulk is often forgotten in lieu of his great Attack stat, but by placing extra EVs in HP rather than Speed, it becomes much easier to set up an extra Dragon Dance. The HP EVs are a Substitute number, allowing Feraligatr to make five Substitutes rather than four after Leftovers recovery. The Speed EVs are designed to outpace Pokemon in the base 105 speed tier after just one Dragon Dance. The rest are dumped into Attack to pack some punch after a couple Dragon Dances, but they can be placed in his Defense to instead strengthen his Substitutes.</p> <p>Because of the added bulk and the ability to block status, you may find that this Feraligatr has multiple chances to come in and set up Substitutes and Dragon Dances. Because of this, Feraligatr can benefit greatly from Wish support, restoring any health he might have lost from entry hazards and enemy attacks. Wish will help him get a second sweep in if he cannot finish the job the first time around. Leafeon is a prime candidate at providing Feraligatr with Wish support with his decent bulk and access to other support moves such as Yawn. Additionally, he attracts Fire-type moves for Feraligatr to set up on and resists Feraligatr's Electric- and Grass-type weaknesses.</p>"
      },
      "ChestoRest": {
        "description": "<p>Feraligatr has always had problems dealing with bulky status inducers such as Milotic and Weezing. This set attempts to remedy that problem. The combination of Chesto Berry and Rest allows Feraligatr to set up Dragon Dance regardless of any status inflicted on him until he is at a point where he cannot take any more hits. From there, Rest is used to heal Feraligatr of any status ailments while simultaneously restoring him to full health. Chesto Berry awakens him instantly; thus you have an alligator at full health with several boosts in both his Attack and Speed. Waterfall is Feraligatr's best physical STAB option, dealing massive damage to many of UU's top threats, and is best paired up with either Return or Earthquake. The former has great coverage with Waterfall, the combination hitting every Pokemon in the UU tier for neutral damage (except Shedinja of course). Earthquake does not bring as much to the table as Return because most of the types it hits for super effective damage are still hit for almost the same damage with Waterfall. However, using it over Return does enable Feraligatr to hit bulky Poison-types, such as Drapion, for super effective damage and it gets a clean 2HKO on all Registeel variants after a single Dragon Dance.</p> <p>The given Speed EVs allow Feraligatr to outspeed base 105 Speed Pokemon after a single Dragon Dance. The rest of the EVs are invested in Feraligatr's Attack and HP, thereby significantly increasing his overall bulk. Feraligatr's bulk is often forgotten in lieu of his great Attack stat, but by placing extra EVs in his HP rather than Speed, it becomes much easier to set up an extra Dragon Dance. In fact, both Weezing's Thunderbolt and Milotic's Hidden Power Grass will fail to 2HKO Feraligatr with the investment. Since Feraligatr is expected to get more than one Dragon Dance, an Adamant nature is used as there won't be much that can outspeed the fearsome beast after several Speed boosts. An alternative spread of 96 HP / 252 Atk / 160 Spe makes sure that Feraligatr isn't outsped by Scarfed positively natured Rotom after two Dragon Dance boosts. Since this set has its own type of instant recovery, it requires less support to function efficiently.</p> <p>Speaking of support, Venusaur has great synergy with Feraligatr and can temporarily incapacitate opposing Pokemon who threaten Feraligatr with Sleep Powder. Both Passho Berry Houndoom and Arcanine can lure in the primary check to Feraligatr, Milotic. Arcanine can set a timer on Milotic lacking Rest with Toxic while Houndoom can switch in on a Pokemon it threatens and set up Nasty Plot twice before its Passho Berry is used and destroy Milotic with +4 Hidden Power Grass. Toxic Spikes, despite being a rather unreliable variety of entry hazard due to the omnipresence of Poison-types in the UU metagame, can prove useful by crippling bulky Water-type walls such as Slowbro and Blastoise, thereby significantly limiting the number of times they can hit Feraligatr as he sets up; a critical hit or even Special Defense drop from Psychic is inevitable as the number of hits increases. Both Drapion and Qwilfish are ideal candidates for this role as they can both set up Toxic Spikes as well as get rid of any Toxic Spikes placed by the opponent's Pokemon. Haze Milotic is the primary counter to Feraligatr in general and can effortlessly remove all the stat boosts the alligator has gained.</p>"
      },
      "SubLiechi": {
        "description": "<p>This set focuses on putting Feraligatr into both Liechi Berry and Torrent range at the same time by using Substitute. If properly set up, Feraligatr is then free to rampage through teams with a \"double STAB\" Waterfall and the complementary Return.</p> <p>The HP EVs yield a stat divisible by four, which means it takes only three Substitutes to put Feraligatr in Liechi Berry activation range. This also means he is left at the maximum possible HP after the Liechi boost to take any weak priority moves thrown at him. The Speed EVs with a Jolly nature are enough to beat Swellow after a Dragon Dance. Attack is then maximized to allow for as much sweeping potential as possible, and the rest are placed into Defense.</p> <p>As with all Substitute sweepers who rely on Pinch Berries, Feraligatr is vulnerable to both priority moves and Pokemon holding a Choice Scarf. Common Pokemon who carry priority moves such as Ambipom and Hitmontop can be taken care of or weakened by Weezing with Will-O-Wisp. Others who often carry a Choice Scarf such as Hitmonlee and Rotom are countered by Spiritomb, who is immune to Hitmonlee's Close Combat, can take hits from Rotom, and proceed to hit them with Will-O-Wisp and Pursuit, respectively.</p> <p>Flail is an interesting alternative to Return. After setup, although Feraligatr loses the ability to take weaker priority moves that come at him, he gains the ability to OHKO all forms of Venusaur and 2HKO even the most physically defensive Milotic. This is helpful, but any plans for a 200 Base Power Flail are ruined by Stealth Rock, sandstorm, or hail. Return is better in terms of consistency, but if you can guarantee that the field is clear of all forms of residual damage, Flail is an option. If you are planning to run Flail, use an EV spread of 88 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def / 164 Spe to leave Feraligatr at one HP after four Substitutes.</p>"

  "Togetic": {
    "overview": "<p>Togetic is one of the few Pokemon who can pass Nasty Plot in UU, the others being Ambipom, Hypno, Minun, Mr. Mime, and Plusle. You may be asking yourself: \"What does this NFE Pokemon have that makes it so special?\" The main answer is Roost. With Roost, Togetic is able to set up on weaker opponents such as Chansey and pass boosts to its teammates with ease. Its decent defenses also help it set up, especially because its HP isn't too impressive. Togetic also has a variety of other support moves which include Wish, Encore, Heal Bell, Yawn, and many more. Togetic only has three weaknesses as well, which are all easily covered by Lanturn, Magneton, or even Registeel. Unfortunately, Togetic is cursed with a weakness to Stealth Rock, and outside of Baton Pass, it isn't useful for much else.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Togetic has a very nice support movepool, and it has the necessary stat distribution to abuse it. Wish can be used to support teammates, and can be used alongside Protect to instantly heal Togetic. Charm can be used to weaken physical attackers, Tailwind can be used to temporarily raise your team's Speed, and Psych Up can be used to copy the opponent's stat boosts and pass them to a teammate. Heal Bell is an option over Baton Pass, which turns Togetic into an effective stallbreaker, while Thunder Wave may be used to cripple a dangerous sweeper. Yawn or Substitute may be used on a Baton Pass set to cripple an opponent or avoid status, respectively. Trick can be used with a Choice item such as Choice Specs, effectively crippling a wall such as Chansey for the remainder of the battle. Psycho Shift may be used to pass any status afflictions onto the opponent, and using it alongside a Flame or Toxic Orb may be effective as well. A dual screen set can be used to support teammates, and Togetic's decent defenses and access to Wish are great assets for this purpose. Ancient Power is an obscure choice, though it gives Togetic a 20% chance to boost all its stats thanks to Serene Grace. Believe it or not, Togetic has an amazing offensive movepool, though it has mediocre attacking stats and poor Speed. Flamethrower, Tri Attack, Shadow Ball, and Grass Knot are all viable options, and with Choice Specs equipped, Togetic can become pretty powerful.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Due to Togetic's specially-based movepool, Pokemon with high Special Defense are excellent counters; Chansey, Clefable, and Registeel are the main ones as they take little damage from any of Togetic's attacks, can set up Stealth Rock, and all have a reliable form of recovery. Rock-types such as Rhyperior and Aggron can take on Togetic if it lacks Grass Knot, as can Rotom if Togetic is without Shadow Ball. Most specially bulky Pokemon with reasonable power can take on Togetic; just make sure it can't set up against your Pokemon too easily. Haze Milotic takes little damage from any of Togetic's attacks, while Haze will erase any stat boosts accumulated. Toxic is a pain for Togetic as it makes it more difficult to set up and slowly drains its HP, just watch out for Heal Bell versions. Finally, Stealth Rock takes a quarter of Togetic's health upon it switching in, and is easily set up by most leads.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Togetic's ability to set up on weaker opponents such as Uxie and Chansey, and support its teammates with Nasty Plot boosts. If you manage to pass Special Attack boosts to a sweeper such as Sceptile, Moltres, or Mismagius, they can become virtually unstoppable. Roost is the main selling point of Togetic, which allows it to set up multiple times, recover Stealth Rock damage, and remove its Flying typing temporarily. Hidden Power Flying is used for STAB, and comes in handy if Togetic is Taunted.</p> <p>This set uses 84 Speed EVs to outrun neutral Chansey, Registeel, and Tangrowth, 172 Special Defense EVs for bulk, and maximum HP EVs to help Togetic take hits much better. Alternatively, if you decide to use Togetic on a dedicated Baton Pass team, you may use a spread of 252 HP / 40 SpD / 216 Spe, which allows Togetic to reach 340 Speed after a +2 boost, enough to outpace both Mismagius and Scyther. Encore is a good move to use with this spread as Togetic will outrun the majority of UU and force the opponent to repeat useless support or setup moves, giving Togetic itself more time to set up. 164 Speed EVs and a neutral nature may also be used to outrun Clefable before it has a chance to Encore you.</p> <p>Having a top-notch special attacker to receive the boosts is a good idea; Sceptile, Moltres, and Alakazam are all excellent choices, as they become nearly unstoppable after a Nasty Plot boost. Alternatively, you may use more Baton Pass users and create a whole team centred around the move; Gorebyss, Mr. Mime, and Floatzel are all good choices. A Taunt user is also helpful as it blocks any attempts to erase stat boosts; Floatzel and Mr. Mime are both good choices, and Mr. Mime also has access to Encore, which helps Togetic set up more boosts or avoid damage. Lastly, Pokemon who can switch into Togetic's weaknesses are good teammate choices; Lanturn can switch into Ice- and Electric-type attacks, while Donphan can switch into Rock- and Electric-type attacks and has access to Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards.</p>"

  "Ampharos": {
    "overview": "<p>Ampharos isn't your average Electric-type, as it is neither fast nor frail. Due to its good defenses, access to helpful support moves such as Reflect and Heal Bell, and single weakness, Ampharos makes a great supporting tank. Don't think Ampharos is weak offensively, either; it has access to a strong STAB Thunderbolt coming from 361 Special Attack, as well as Focus Punch to deal with pesky walls such as Chansey. Ampharos's ability, Static, is helpful against physical attackers, as Ampharos has a chance to paralyze and cripple any Pokemon which makes contact with it. Ampharos's biggest downfall is its low Speed stat, which makes it vulnerable to faster opponents which carry Ground-type attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ampharos can use Counter along with a more defensive EV spread, though its weakness to a very common physical move, Earthquake, will make it pretty useless, as Ampharos is an open invitation for Ground-types to come in. Body Slam is another option that can be used alongside Discharge as a paralysis-inducing auxiliary move that hits Ground-types. Magnet Rise is usable to temporarily remove Ampharos's weakness to Earthquake. Finally, Power Gem is an option on Choice sets to hit Scyther and Moltres 4x super effectively, though STAB Thunderbolt is usually more reliable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Chansey is by far the biggest counter to special sets; with its massive HP and good Special Defense, it can wall Ampharos for years with a combination of Soft-Boiled and Seismic Toss. It should watch out for the occasional Focus Punch, though. Lanturn causes problems for most Ampharos sets, thanks to its Volt Absorb ability, which renders Ampharos's STAB Thunderbolt useless, and huge HP and good Special Defense. However, Lanturn can be beaten by Hidden Power Grass or Focus Punch.</p> <p>Ground-types such as Torterra can tackle most of Ampharos's sets lacking Hidden Power Ice, thanks to its immunity to Electric-type moves and access to Rock Polish to boost its Speed. Torterra will usually force a switch, giving it time to set up and cause problems for the rest of your team. Dugtrio is another great choice for this role, as it can switch into Ampharos's Thunderbolt, trap it with Arena Trap, and proceed to annihilate it with Earthquake.</p> <p>In general, the best way to deal with Ampharos is to find out what Hidden Power it has and then to play accordingly.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Why Ampharos Don't Have Wool (Life Orb)": {
        "description": "<p>Ampharos is different than most of its Electric-type brethren due to good defenses and low Speed. It still maintains an excellent base 115 Special Attack stat, and Thunderbolt can obliterate many common Pokemon in UU. This set takes advantage of Ampharos's natural bulk to help set up Substitute on weak walls and begin opening up holes in the opponent's team.</p> <p>The core move of this set is Thunderbolt. With Stealth Rock on the field, Ampharos will nearly always OHKO Bulky Water Milotic. Thunderbolt also gets rid of powerful threats such as Toxicroak and Alakazam in one strike. Because of Ampharos's natural bulk, most offensive threats will not be able to OHKO it, allowing it to go toe-to-toe with top threats and come out the victor. Ground-types have an unfortunate immunity to Electric attacks, but Hidden Power Ice remedies this. Hidden Power Ice allows Ampharos to hit Ground-types hard, having a great chance to OHKO standard Donphan it he tries to absorb Thunderbolt. Hidden Power Ice also OHKOes Torterra, but Ampharos needs to hit max Speed variants on the switch or when safely behind a Substitute. Focus Blast allows Ampharos to 2HKO both Clefable and Registeel, while giving it a way to threaten Chansey. Focus Blast also allows Ampharos to OHKO standard Rhyperior, as Hidden Power Ice can only muster a 2HKO. Substitute is the primary option in the last slot, as Ampharos can use its bulk and power to cause switches. It also helps ease prediction, and guards Ampharos against opposing Dugtrio. Although a dry Focus Punch may seem sketchy, it's Ampharos's best bet at eliminating Chansey.</p> <p>Ampharos can run Hidden Power Grass to reliably OHKO Rhyperior and Water/Ground-types. This also allows Ampharos to hit Lanturn which would otherwise wall it, but Hidden Power Ice is usually the superior option. If you want a bulkier Ampharos, an alternative EV spread of 212 HP / 252 SpA / 44 Speed allows Ampharos to take hits considerably better at the cost of Speed. 48 Speed EVs allow Ampharos to outspeed minimum Speed Clefable, standard Rhyperior, and other slow walls. If using the bulkier spread, Leftovers becomes a viable option. When using Focus Punch, a Mild nature is recommended to hit Chansey harder.</p> <p>Because Ampharos can get rid of bulky Water-types easily, Fire-types are perfect partners. Arcanine is a great choice as it's one of the more durable options. Arcanine can help eliminate pesky Grass-types, such as Venusaur, which plague Ampharos. Because Ampharos's sole weakness is Ground, a resistance or immunity to Earthquake is extremely useful. Mismagius makes an excellent partner with Ampharos because of its ability to KO Registeel with repeated Focus Blasts. Mixed variants of Sceptile pair well with Ampharos, as they weaken each other's counters. Because of potential paralysis from Static, slow but powerful Pokemon such as Torterra make good teammates. Lanturn can be quite the pest for Ampharos, so pairing it with a Pokemon such as Venusaur is also recommended.</p> <p>Dugtrio is a major threat to Ampharos, as blindly throwing out Thunderbolt will cause it to be trapped and OHKOed. Ampharos should always try to be safely behind a Substitute. If Ampharos is somehow revenge killed by Dugtrio, having a threatening partner such as Moltres or the previously mentioned Torterra will allow you to gain back some momentum.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>This set makes full use of Ampharos's potential as a team supporter. 90/75/90 defenses are nothing to scoff at, especially when Ampharos only has one weakness. Discharge's 30% paralysis rate makes it a great option on this set also as it helps compensate for Ampharos's low Speed stat. Hidden Power is mainly used for coverage, hitting the Ground-types which love to switch in on Ampharos for super effective damage. Heal Bell supports Ampharos's teammates by removing status afflictions, while Reflect and Light Screen help weaken the opponent's attacks. Toxic and Thunder Wave may also be used on this set, though they may conflict with Static and Discharge. Hidden Power Ice is preferred for BoltBeam coverage, but Hidden Power Grass is useful as it can hit Lanturn and Rhyperior.</p> <p>The EVs on this set ensure that Ampharos survives a rain-boosted Surf from Omastar, factoring in Stealth Rock and Leftovers. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Attack to give Ampharos's attacks more power. Alternatively, you may use Ampharos in a more defensive role as a dual screener; if you choose to go this route, a Calm nature can be used along with a spread of 252 HP / 80 Def / 176 SpD and with Light Clay instead of Leftovers. When you Ampharos's Special Attack EVs with Defense EVs, it becomes much more difficult to KO.</p> <p>Being completely specially-based, this set is walled by the likes of Chansey and Clefable. There are multiple ways to deal with this, the first being a physical attacker such as Hitmontop or Dugtrio. Dugtrio has the added bonus of being able trap the opposing Pokemon with its ability, Arena Trap. Another option is using Mismagius with Taunt and Nasty Plot, which allows it to boost its Special Attack while muscling through the aforementioned walls with boosted Hidden Power Fighting. Taunt ensures that the opposing Pokemon cannot cripple Mismagius with status moves. Mismagius also makes for a good partner to Ampharos because it can avoid damage from any Brick Break users attempting to break the screens that Ampharos sets up, even if the screens still get broken; it also has an immunity to Earthquake, making it a decent defensive partner.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Unlike the defensive set, this variant of Ampharos takes advantage of Ampharos's huge Special Attack stat and access to STAB Thunderbolt, which enable it to destroy common UU threats such as Moltres, Milotic, and Slowbro. Focus Blast deals huge chunks of damage to Normal- and Steel-types such as Chansey, Clefable, and Registeel, while Hidden Power is used to hit Ground-types which are immune to Thunderbolt. The choice between Hidden Power Ice and Hidden Power Grass depends on which targets you want Ampharos to cover. Hidden Power Grass hits Omastar, Rhyperior, Quagsire, and Lanturn, while Hidden Power Ice hits Altaria, Donphan, and Venusaur. Hidden Power Ice is usually the superior option, as it deals with more common UU threats such as Venusaur and Altaria. Signal Beam is mainly a filler, though it does hit Shiftry and Exeggutor harder than any other move in Ampharos's arsenal.</p> <p>48 Speed EVs are used to outrun 4 Speed Clefable, allowing Ampharos to 2HKO it with Thunderbolt on the switchin before it can move. Max Special Attack paired with Choice Specs gives Ampharos the ability to 2HKO most of UU and seriously dent the rest. The remaining EVs are placed into HP to give Ampharos more overall bulk, which complements its good defenses. If you aren't worried about Clefable, you can pour the Speed EVs into HP instead.</p> <p>Due to Ampharos's low Speed stat, any opponent faster than it becomes an instant threat--especially those with Earthquake. It is recommended that you pair Ampharos with a Pokemon which resists or has an immunity to Ground-type attacks. Mismagius is an obvious first choice due to its Levitate ability and good Speed; however, less-used Pokemon such as Ludicolo and Tangrowth are good options too. Ludicolo and Tangrowth also have access to Leech Seed, which is helpful for recovering Ampharos's health and works very well with its decent defenses.</p>"

      "Rain Dance Support": {
        "description": "<p>Ampharos makes an ideal Rain Dance setter, as it has great defensive stats and access to 100% accurate STAB Thunder in the rain. Hidden Power Water rounds off the set's coverage, hitting Ground-types super effectively and getting a nice boost from rain. The last slot helps complement Ampharos's defensive ability, providing support for its teammates through Safeguard and screens. Heal Bell may be used too, removing status from the team.</p> <p>This set could also use a spread of 252 HP / 80 Def / 176 SpD, making it bulky and difficult to take down. The spread ensures that Omastar won't KO Ampharos with a rain-boosted Surf, even if Stealth Rock is in play. Ampharos may be played more offensively, with a spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD, which allows Ampharos to become a sweeper if necessary. If you choose to go this route, you may swap Ampharos's last move for Focus Blast to hit the likes of Registeel and Chansey super effectively.</p> <p>As the main focus of this set is Rain Dance, Pokemon which can take advantage of the weather are ideal partners for Ampharos. Swift Swimmers are good options, as they can sweep the opponent quickly; such Pokemon include Ludicolo, which has a great special movepool and STAB Surf and Grass Knot, and Kabutops, which, amongst its credentials, has access to Waterfall, Swords Dance, and Stone Edge. Electric-types can also take advantage of the rain, as they can enjoy using 100% accurate STAB Thunder. Rotom is an excellent choice, since it can switch into Ground-type attacks aimed at Ampharos and set up screens to support the team if Ampharos is unable to. Rotom also has access to STAB Thunder and Shadow Ball, along with utility moves such as Trick, Will-O-Wisp, and Discharge. Lanturn is an odd Pokemon to pair with Ampharos, as it shares Ampharos's weakness to Ground-type attacks; however, Lanturn can set up rain as well, while taking advantage of boosted STAB Surf and Thunder in the rain. Lanturn can also switch into Electric-type attacks aimed at your sweepers thanks to Volt Absorb.</p>"

  "Bellossom": {
    "overview": "<p>Unfortunately for Bellossom, it is as average a Grass-type as can exist. Thanks to its average stats, ability, movepool, and even typing, Bellossom has practically nothing over its competition. Don't be fooled, though, as this doesn't make Bellossom a bad Pokemon. Its stats are placed perfectly to allow Bellossom to abuse its ability, Chlorophyll, and its movepool has all the right things in all the right places to ensure that it won't be a disappointment if you use it correctly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bellossom doesn't have many other options, as its movepool is extremely shallow. Bellossom can use a pure offensive Sunny Day with Solar Beam, Hidden Power Fire, and Moonlight, but it is easily walled and lacks other coverage moves that her Chlorophyll brethren possess. It has Stun Spore, Teeter Dance, and Sleep Powder, which are useful on double status and Parafusion sets; however, its lack of offense and Speed are an issue. Bellossom can use a Swords Dance set utilizing Leaf Blade, Return, and Drain Punch, but the same dilemma occurs as the offensive Sunny Day set. Bellossom has access to the SubSeed combination, but it is too slow and can only use it while sun is in play, which isn't reliable. Finally, equipping Bellossom with Choice Specs can give it a lot more power, but its coverage moves end at Leaf Storm, Sludge Bomb, and Hidden Power Fire, so use another Pokemon instead.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>RestTalk Spiritomb is an awesome counter to Bellossom, as it takes little damage from even a full-powered Leaf Storm, absorbs Sleep Powder, doesn't care about paralysis, and threatens Bellossom with Pursuit if it attempts to switch out. Opposing Fire-types terrify Bellossom by taking advantage of the sun it sets up and threatening to OHKO it with any Fire-type attack. Altaria and Chansey are almost perfect counters to Bellossom because they are not harmed in the slightest by Leaf Storm or Solar Beam, and can heal themselves of whatever status Bellossom may inflict on them thanks to their ability, Natural Cure. Furthermore, Altaria and Chansey can threaten the rest of Bellossom's teammates by either setting up or spreading status, respectively.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sunny Day Support": {
        "description": "<p>This set is about as good as it gets for Bellossom, and is the most useful role that it can fulfill in UU. The main idea is to come in on a Pokemon that poses little threat to Bellossom, such as Milotic or Rotom, set up Sunny Day, cripple an opponent with Sleep Powder, and switch out to a teammate that can abuse the remaining six turns of weather. Bellossom works great early in the game if Sunny Day hasn't been revealed yet and some of the opposition has been scouted. The last two slots give Bellossom some auxiliary support to ensure that it isn't completely hapless against the enemy. Hidden Power Fire gets a pseudo-STAB boost under the sun, and pairs well with the Grass-type attack in the last slot for neutral coverage. Solar Beam is the primary choice in the last slot as its synergy with Sunny Day is pretty much a given.</p> <p>Moonlight can be used in place of Hidden Power Fire to give Bellossom much more survivability and allow it to set up Sunny Day more times during the battle. As a bonus, Moonlight heals 2/3 of Bellossom's health under the sun. Leaf Storm can be used in place of Solar Beam to give Bellossom a one-time nuke, but with sun up, Solar Beam is far more reliable. Hidden Power Rock can be used in place of Hidden Power Fire to damage any Fire-types looking to take advantage of the sun Bellossom provides, and it handily eliminates Moltres, a common Bellossom switch-in.</p> <p>The EVs are designed to give Bellossom as much Special Attack as possible, while also giving it enough Speed to reach a Speed stat of 396 in the sun, which outspeeds Jolly Swellow. Alternatively, Bellossom can invest in Special Defense with a Calm nature to make it a more bulky supporter. However, the disparity in power is enormous, and Bellossom becomes more of a liability to your team than an asset when it can be so easily set up on by the enemy.</p> <p>As a supporter, the best teammates for Bellossom are those that can take advantage of the sun and sleep Bellossom provides. Fire-types such as Arcanine and Blaziken make great partners to Bellossom, as they cover its Ice- and Fire-type weaknesses, while enjoying the huge power boost that the sun grants their STAB Fire-type moves. In turn, Bellossom covers their Water-type weakness, and can switch into Milotic and Slowbro with impunity. While pairing Bellossom exclusively with other Chlorophyll users such as Exeggutor and Shiftry is not advised, Bellossom is able to switch into any weak Ice-type attacks aimed at them, and allows them to use another coverage move in place of Sleep Powder. Bellossom's other weaknesses include Bug-, Flying-, and Poison-type attacks, so using Pokemon who can cover them, such as Regirock and Rhyperior, is recommended.</p>"

  "Azumarill": {
    "overview": "<p>With physical STAB, the equivalent of 150 base Attack, decent defenses, and convenient typing, Azumarill can run circles around unprepared teams. With a Choice Band, it can break down even UU's bulkiest walls with the appropriate move, 2HKOing Slowbro, Milotic, Regirock, Registeel, Steelix, and Spiritomb. Substitute variants can take advantage of a wide range of defensive Pokemon including Chansey and Registeel, breaking the mid-game wide open with a massive Attack stat and decent coverage. Azumarill has a niche on offensive teams due to its good defenses, ability to take hits, and STAB priority move. Although Aqua Jet somewhat alleviates Azumarill's Speed concerns, its subpar Speed is still its greatest shortcoming.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>If you don't care about using moves with 90% accuracy, Aqua Tail is a stronger alternative to Waterfall and can be substituted on any of the sets. Leftovers is a viable option instead of a Choice Band on offensive teams looking to capitalize on Azumarill's bulk and resists; this makes it harder for Pokemon like Toxicroak or Mismagius to set up on Azumarill, but obviously comes at the cost of some power--this makes Toxic an attractive option in conjunction with Leftovers. Sing can be used by Azumarill to send its counter to sleep, but it is generally too unreliable.</p> <p>The primary EV spread given in the sets is optimal. Azumarill won't be winning Speed awards any time soon, so maximizing HP and Attack makes the most of its bulk and powers up its attacks. However, moving a few EVs into Speed is an option to outspeed other neutral-nature base 50s who may invest slightly in Speed, including Regirock, Registeel, Chansey, Hariyama, and Tangrowth. Be sure not to take any EVs out of HP for the SubPunch set, though, as 252 EVs are required to allow Azumarill to create 101 HP Substitutes. Using 84 Speed EVs outspeeds minimum Speed base 60 Pokemon such as Clefable and Weezing. On the RestTalk set, the last four EVs are placed into Special Defense to ensure Porygon2 doesn't get a Special Attack boost from Download.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Slowbro stands out as Azumarill's number one counter. It resists all of Azumarill's commonly used moves except for Double-Edge / Return and has access to reliable recovery. Despite this, Slowbro must beware of Toxic, since a Slowbro inflicted with Toxic is essentially neutered (and can be stalled out by Substitute if Slowbro lacks Psychic or Hidden Power Electric). In the same vein, defensive variants of Milotic fare relatively well but risk a 2HKO from a Choice Band-boosted Double-Edge. However, Milotic actually outspeeds Azumarill, meaning it can escape the 2HKO by abusing Double-Edge's recoil damage with Recover, activating Marvel Scale through Rest, or KOing Azumarill with Hidden Power Electric or Grass.</p> <p>Venusaur sports a resistance to Waterfall and Focus Punch and can strike back with powerful STAB Grass attacks or Leech Seed and recover lost HP with Synthesis. With an immunity to Azumarill's STAB, Water Absorb Pokemon are also fine counters. Poliwrath can use Azumarill as an excuse to start using Bulk Up while Encoring Azumarill's Substitute, while Quagsire can Curse. Lapras has a massive HP stat, higher Speed, and access to Thunderbolt, but it will have to beware of Stealth Rock and the possibility of taking a heavy hit from Superpower or Focus Punch. While Toxicroak is also immune to Water attacks because of its ability, Dry Skin, its relative physical frailty means switching it directly into Azumarill is not recommended. However, it does sport a resistance to Fighting-type attacks, which allows it to more easily set up on a Choice-locked Superpower or a Substitute Azumarill without Encore.</p> <p>Weezing is never 2HKOed by Waterfall and can force Azumarill out with the threat of Will-O-Wisp or Thunderbolt, but it lacks reliable recovery. Tangrowth, possessing defensive stats that make Skarmory a tad green, can defeat Azumarill even if it has a Choice Band and Ice Punch (but will lose if it has taken previous or residual damage). Altaria works against variants without Ice Punch, resisting the entirety of Azumarill's moveset except for Double-Edge. Luxray can switch in easily thanks to Intimidate and threaten with a STAB Thunderbolt.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Azumarill's convenient resistances to Water-, Ice-, and Fire-type attacks paired with respectable 100 / 80 / 80 defenses grant it multiple opportunities to switch in and inflict damage. Waterfall and Return provide great type coverage; the attacking combination of Water + Normal is resisted only by Shedinja (in UU) and Empoleon (in OU). Double-Edge's additional power can be useful at times (it allows Azumarill to sometimes 2HKO Slowbro with Stealth Rock support), but in general, the recoil sacrifices too much of Azumarill's bulk. Aqua Jet allows Azumarill to function as a potent revenge killer and even gives it a chance at a late-game sweep once Water-type resists are weakened or eliminated. The last slot is allocated for type coverage; Ice Punch helps Azumarill combat Venusaur, Tangrowth, and Altaria switch-ins, while Superpower gives a super effective hit on the likes of Registeel.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Milotic can shrug off Azumarill's attacks and recover off any damage taken. Other physically bulky Pokemon, such as Venusaur, Tangrowth, Registeel, and Weezing, may also be problematic. Pairing Azumarill with a Grass-type and a specially-based Fire-type is recommended to take advantage of the defensive and offensive synergy inherent in the Fire / Grass / Water combination. Venusaur can easily switch into Slowbro, Milotic, and Tangrowth. Houndoom can take advantage of a fleeing Grass-type to get in a Nasty Plot, and also has access to Dark STAB to combat Slowbro. Blaziken can OHKO opposing Grass-types and even 2HKO bulky Water-types with appropriate prediction.</p> <p>Azumarill can 2HKO the majority of UU with the appropriate move, but choosing the wrong attack can often mean a free turn for the opponent. The key to defeating the set is the same as the key to success--whenever Azumarill appears in battle, it is recommended to read your opponent like a large-print copy of Dr. Seuss and pick your move accordingly. Often, even when Azumarill is brought into a Fire- or Ground-type, opening with Return may be more beneficial than using Waterfall. Your opponent is unlikely to keep his or her Pokemon in or bring in a Regirock, Steelix, Registeel, or physically frail Ghost; on the other hand, Return can hit the majority of Azumarill's common switch-ins like Venusaur or Milotic for neutral damage.</p>"
      },
      "SubPunch": {
        "description": "<p>While the Choice Band set is dependent on prediction to inflict massive amounts of damage, this set takes advantage of Azumarill's ability to create 101 HP Substitutes to function more as a team player in wearing down the opponent.</p> <p>The first two moves are self-explanatory, and Waterfall provides a reliable STAB attack. However, Ice Punch can be used to hit Venusaur and other Grass-types hard. Aqua Jet is the preferred option in the last slot, as it allows Azumarill to reliably revenge kill low-HP opponents and threaten Fire-types such as Houndoom, Ninetales, Arcanine, and Magmortar. Azumarill can also use Aqua Jet and its low Speed to garner a free Substitute: use Substitute as an attack from a faster but weakened opponent hits Azumarill, then Aqua Jet for the KO before the Substitute is broken. Encore is also an option to help Azumarill set up a Substitute more reliably and rack up Spikes and Stealth Rock damage; it also stops RestTalkers such as Milotic in their tracks. Finally, Toxic can be used to cripple Slowbro and Slowking, which easily switch into this set and wall it.</p> <p>Since this Azumarill loses the raw power granted by a Choice Band and Double-Edge, bulky Pokemon like Milotic and Tangrowth become more of a problem, and Toxic can be used over an attack to cripple them. Ice Punch can be used in the last slot, but it is really only useful for Venusaur; furthermore, it doesn't OHKO, and Venusaur outpaces Azumarill, which means this is an uphill battle--Azumarill is generally better off sticking to another attack.</p> <p>Pokemon who can withstand assaults from the Choice Band set will also fare well against the SubPuncher. For example, while Slowbro is occasionally 2HKOed by a Choice Band-boosted Double-Edge, it is never 4HKOed by this set's attacks. However, with the decreased power comes increased unpredictability. While a SubPunching Azumarill cannot defeat Slowbro or Tangrowth through raw power, it can cripple them with Toxic or rack up entry hazards damage by Encoring a Slack Off or Moonlight.</p> <p>As with any Substitute user, Azumarill benefits from a way to restore lost HP. Wish support, perhaps from Clefable, can greatly extend Azumarill's lifespan. Defensive screens are also a great option because they allow Azumarill's Substitutes to live through two hits from Slowbro and four hits from Milotic (unless it has a super effective Hidden Power). Torterra is a fine choice for a partner, as it can set up both Reflect and Light Screen and has access to Leech Seed to restore Azumarill's HP. Azumarill resists Torterra's Fire and Ice weaknesses while Torterra is immune to the Electric attacks that Azumarill attracts. Gardevoir and Clefable can also set up dual screens, and both have access to Wish to replenish Azumarill's HP.</p>"
      },
      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<p>RestTalk Azumarill is a great example of a tank, as it's able to inflict significant damage to opponents while retaining great bulk. Rest and Sleep Talk are the two most important moves of the set as they offer Azumarill several advantages: a somewhat reliable recovery move, safety against some crippling status, such as burn and poison that could turn Azumarill into setup fodder, and the ability to keep attacking the opponent while asleep. Waterfall is a powerful and reliable STAB attack that can dent everything that doesn't resist it. The final slot brings the only choice one should consider when using this set. Return is the preferred move, because even though it offers less power than Double-Edge, it doesn't have recoil, thus providing Azumarill with more durability. Since Water- and Normal-type attacks offer very good neutral coverage, Azumarill won't find itself being walled by many Pokemon in UU.</p> <p>The EV spread is the most logical one when thinking about a physically-inclined tank: The HP EVs are needed to give Azumarill the bulk to take neutral physical and special attacks with relative ease; 252 Attack EVs maximize the damage output and, when paired with Huge Power, let Azumarill dish out some major hits; the remaining 4 EVs go to Special Defense to avoid the rare Porygon2 Download boost. Leftovers is the preferred item because it allows Azumarill to be less dependent on Rest and therefore capable of better performance. Even though Life Orb lets Azumarill hit harder, it isn't recommended. An Impish nature with an EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD can be used to turn Azumarill into a very bulky physical wall but it will miss the extra power dearly.</p> <p>Not many Pokemon are able to take a STAB Waterfall from Azumarill and be in good shape for the rest of the match. Pokemon who do, however, have to be dealt with by Azumarill's teammates. Venusaur is the most common, as it has the ability to either set up on Azumarill or outright OHKO it. Leafeon and Tangrowth can do the same thanks to their great bulk and access to several support options. Finally, Milotic can also wall Azumarill very well due to its great bulk; more offensive variants lack this, but are still able to beat Azumarill one-on-one with superior firepower. Due to the low Speed of the set, fast Pokemon with super effective STAB moves can come in with some prediction and OHKO Azumarill. Rotom is perhaps the best example of a check as it can switch on Return and OHKO with Thunderbolt if Azumarill has been weakened sufficiently; Sceptile is another good check thanks to its STAB Grass-type attacks. However, both have to avoid Waterfall and Return, respectively, or risk being severely crippled.</p> <p>To be able to defeat those Pokemon, specially defensive Arcanine is probably the best teammate Azumarill can have; it beats most of Milotic's sets if it carries Toxic, the four Grass-types thanks to its Fire STAB, and Rotom with its great bulk. Nidoqueen and specially defensive Drapion are also good partners for their ability to set up Toxic Spikes, which help Azumarill in outlasting its opponents, while maintaining reasonable synergy. Finally, Spiritomb is very useful for its ability to spinblock and trap Rotom and the less threatening Mismagius.</p>"

  "Jumpluff": {
    "overview": "<p>Jumpluff is by no means a bad Pokemon because it lacks the stats to attack. Instead, Jumpluff plays the role of supporting its teammates. Jumpluff can take advantage of Sleep Powder, base 110 Speed, and a plethora of support moves like Encore and Memento in UU, OU, and even in Ubers if you know how to take control of the field. Just don't expect Jumpluff to take too much torture, and you should be able to annoy all day.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Worry Seed easily destroys Sleep Talkers like Articuno and also makes Clefable shuffle in fear. Aromatherapy can be thrown onto a set but isn't highly recommended on a Pokemon who can barely take many hits at all. It does have Swords Dance as well but lacks a physical movepool and an Attack stat as well. Bounce works well in conjunction with SubSeed as it helps protect your Substitute for a turn but also leaves you vulnerable once you crash down; however, you have that nice chance of paralysis on your side. Reflect tones down physical hits, but don't expect Jumpluff to be surviving long even with the screen up. Jumpluff can use Toxic to poison opponents; this would be particularly annoying on the SubSeed set, but this conflicts with Sleep Powder, and generally Stun Spore is better for the Double Powder set. Aerial Ace and Hidden Power Flying are other options, mainly for the SubSeed set. They give you a way to hit the many Grass-types in UU. However, Jumpluff's low Attack stats weakens the viability of these moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Sleep Powder makes Jumpluff incredibly hard to counter, as many UU Pokemon capable of absorbing sleep are extremely weak to the SubSeed set.</p> <p>Clefable is one of the best counters to Jumpluff. Despite still being vulnerable to Encore and Sleep Powder, her Magic Guard ability makes Leech Seed useless. To make matters worse Clefable can easily carry a Toxic Orb and prevent any status put upon her. Grass-types are the best counters to the SubSeed set, although Sleep Powder is a pain for most. Sleep Talkers can easily step in on Sleep Powder and take advantage of the field by retaliating, but they won't like the SubSeed set. Primeape can do well as Vital Spirit blocks Sleep Powder and it has many ways of taking out Jumpluff, or it can just U-turn to a faster sweeper while breaking Jumpluff's Substitute.</p> <p>Phazers can take advantage of the situation and simply force Jumpluff far away. And to make your life easier, next time Jumpluff steps in it receives 25% more damage if Stealth Rock is down. Just make sure that use Roar or Whirlwind only after you switch in. Since both moves have a negative priority, you run a risk of an Encore shoved right back at you. A lot of UU Pokemon can switch into Jumpluff but have a lot of issues from there. However, outside of Leech Seed and possibly U-turn you really have no fear of taking damage at all.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "SubSeed": {
        "description": "<p>This set is simple to use: Sleep Powder on the first turn, Substitute the second, and Leech Seed the third. Repeat steps two and three when needed. If you have entry hazard support, the indirect damage received from switching out from Leech Seed can add up very quickly. Encore simply adds to the madness, and thanks to the Substitute, you can switch around appropriately without worries.</p> <p>Aerial Ace or Hidden Power Flying can be used over Encore should you want to be able to hurt Grass-types, while U-turn is another alternative for some scouting and escaping from troublesome Pokemon. Timid and 252 Speed EVs are used so Jumpluff can outrun Mismagius and Speed tie with Froslass. The rest are put into Defense and Special Defense to take weak, resisted attacks better. Don't put EVs in HP; this inhibits its SubSeeding ability as you want Leech Seed to restore a greater percentage of Jumpluff's health.</p> <p>Chlorophyll is the preferred ability as with Sunny Day support, the opponent won't have much of a chance at outspeeding and beating Jumpluff when it is at 700 Speed. This set has potential in Ubers when paired with Groudon. Drought activates Chlorophyll and lets Jumpluff outspeed everything but Choice Scarf Deoxys-S with a positive nature.</p> <p>Breaking through the combination of Sleep Powder and SubSeeding is annoying, but Grass-types can usually do very well. You can scare them off with the STAB moves of powerful Fire- or Flying-type Pokemon such as Moltres or Arcanine. Swellow can deal with the Grass-types with a powerful STAB Brave Bird, but its fragility makes it hard to switch in. Swellow and other Pokemon who can avoid Sleep Powder's effects, such as Primeape, are also threats to Jumpluff. Rotom can therefore make a nice partner to deal with Primeape and Swellow thanks to its solid typing and its possession of Will-O-Wisp to cripple Primeape, as well as STAB Thunderbolt to scare off Swellow.</p> <p>Spikes, Stealth Rock, and Toxic Spikes support are very useful for this set. Substitute + Leech Seed makes your opponent want to switch, but the entry hazards will make them think twice. Cloyster, Omastar, and Qwilfish can set up the two types of Spikes and also take many of the moves commonly aimed at Jumpluff. Qwilfish also has access to Poison Jab to scare off most Grass-types. In the sun, they aren't such great options, though. Nidoqueen and Drapion are great partners for setting up Toxic Spikes. Nidoqueen's Rock-type resistance will be useful, and they can both take Poison-type moves aimed at Jumpluff. Stealth Rock support is a must for punishing your opponent's switches. Claydol and Donphan are great Pokemon to set up Stealth Rock as they have useful Rock-type resistances and can also use Rapid Spin to get rid of your opponent's Stealth Rock; taking 25% each switch in would badly hinder Jumpluff. Other options for setting up Stealth Rock include Steelix, Kabutops, and Omastar, all of whom possess resistances to various attacks super effective against Jumpluff.</p> <p>Sunny Day support isn't required but is very useful. At 700 Speed, barring priority, your opponent will find it very hard to outspeed you, and so SubSeeding will be more effective and annoying. Donphan, Hariyama, and Moltres and Arcanine are possible defensive choices; each resists one or more of Jumpluff's weaknesses. Ambipom can make a nice lead to set up Sunny Day at the beginning of the match.</p>"

      "Double Status": {
        "description": "<p>Due to Sleep Clause, you can only put one Pokemon to sleep with Sleep Powder. However, Jumpluff also has access to Stun Spore, meaning it can still annoy your opponent by not only putting one of their Pokemon to sleep, but also paralyzing a few.</p> <p>Sleep Powder first, and then hopefully status with Stun Spore to hopefully hurt another Pokemon. Encore is an amazing move that can be used to buy free switch-ins. With good prediction, Jumpluff can switch into an Earthquake and Encore it, allowing it a free turn to abuse Sleep Powder or Stun Spore. U-turn is for getting the hell out of there when you're all done. It also helps ease prediction and shift the momentum of the game in your favor.</p> <p>Leftovers is the preferred item for the free recovery it provides, but if you want to use this as a lead, then Focus Sash is a good alternative to guarantee surviving an attack from most (non-Fake Out) leads. Therefore, Protect may be a good option on this set when using Focus Sash, but generally it's better to stick to Encore and U-turn in the other slots. EVs are aimed at maximizing its HP and Speed so it can move first and will never have to take a hit. Chlorophyll is the preferred ability to further boost Jumpluff's Speed in the sun.</p> <p>Countering this set entails switching in Pokemon who don't mind either status. Altaria has Natural Cure to shrug off status and has many moves to hit Jumpluff hard with. Steelix can do well against Altaria who lack Flamethrower as its high Defense lets it take even Earthquake easily. Bulky Water-types can also do well against Altaria. RestTalk Pokemon such as Milotic can shrug off status and attack while asleep. In this case, Ice Beam will make short work of Jumpluff. Powerful Grass-types and Electric-types can also do well against Milotic. Feraligatr and SubPunch Azumarill can make great partners to Jumpluff as they can set up on Milotic who lack Hidden Power Grass, and Haze in the case of Feraligatr.</p> <p>Rapid Spin support from Pokemon such as Blastoise, Claydol, Donphan, or Hitmontop is very useful for this set. Taking 25% from Stealth Rock every time it switches in will badly hinder Jumpluff. Claydol, Donphan, and Hitmontop can also take Jumpluff's Rock-type weakness, while Blastoise can take the Fire- and Ice-type moves aimed at Jumpluff. Sunny Day support can also be beneficial because of the Speed boost, making it almost impossible for your opponent to outspeed Jumpluff.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Jumpluff has a myriad of unique support options that can help the team, and this set puts all of them to good use. Its purpose is to provide a powerful attacker the chance to set up, hopefully opening the game for a sweep.</p> <p>Jumpluff's high Speed allows it plenty of chances to use Sleep Powder. With the opposing Pokemon asleep, Jumpluff can freely use Reflect to provide itself and its teammates more protection from physical attacks and then proceed to use Memento, a self-KO move that harshly lowers the opponent's Attack and Special Attack. At that point, a powerful set-up sweeper, such as Belly Drum Charizard, can enter the battle and use its stat-boosting move with little risk. This would also be a great opportunity for a Baton Passer to set up.</p> <p>Encore is definitely the preferred third move to punish those that think Jumpluff is a setup fodder. Reflect does not have to be used in order for Jumpluff to be successful. It is somewhat of a filler move, but given the fact that UU is a tier crowded with physical attackers, it can prove to be very useful. If this set is used in OU or Ubers, Reflect can be dropped in favor of another move, such as Leech Seed or Toxic. Don't even bother with an attacking move like Grass Knot or Aerial Ace, as the damage output will be always be pitiful.</p> <p>Leftovers as the item works fine, but there are other choices too. Lum Berry, Light Clay, and Focus Sash are the most obvious examples, the latter only being of use if one decides to lead with this set because of the 25% damage that Stealth Rock will deal to Jumpluff upon switching in.</p> <p>The best partners to this set are Pokemon who can take advantage of Memento and possibly Reflect, and set up. Belly Drum Charizard, Substitute + Dragon Dance or Substitute + Swords Dance Feraligatr, and Rock Polish Torterra are good choices; each has natural bulk or Substitute to take advantage Jumpluff's support. Swords Dance Absol, Scyther, and Toxicroak are other good teammates.</p> <p>There aren't many counters to this set as it doesn't aim to stay around for long. Ambipom and Electrode are some of the best, though, as they are faster, barring Sunny Day, and can stop Jumpluff with Taunt. Most Steel-types are good partners to deal with Ambipom, while if it lacks Payback, Ghost-types can deal with it. Therefore, Steelix and Registeel make great partners to deal with the aforementioned Pokemon thanks to their high defenses, resistances to many of their common moves, and ability to hit back with Iron Head / Earthquake. A Rapid Spinner such as Donphan can be useful to spin away Stealth Rock, which badly hurts Jumpluff. However, since this set doesn't aim to survive long, this isn't a requirement.</p>"
      },
      "Sunny Day": {
        "description": "<p>This combo is actually nice in UU and decent to use in OU. Use Sleep Powder first and then proceed to use Sunny Day to boost your Speed to 700. You can then easily U-turn away for your other teammates to tear through your opponent with Fire-type moves or their own Chlorophyll abilities.</p> <p>The main reason for Encore is because once Sleep Clause is activated and you need Jumpluff to make the sunlight return, you have to rely on using Encore to cripple your opponent and give yourself a free turn to set up the sun during the switch. This allows you to U-turn safely from harm right after you set up the sun; however, your switch-in is at risk with the second strategy. Memento can go somewhere should you like the ability to help Swords Dance Tangrowth or Victreebel set up; with +2 Attack and doubled Speed, they will be a major pain to your opponent. This will work better in UU though as there are less Choice Scarf users to revenge them.</p> <p>Heat Rock is the recommended item choice as it gives your team eight turns of sun to abuse. Max HP and Speed is simple as this set needs to be as fast as possible due to Jumpluff's fragility, while the HP EVs help it take weak resisted attacks. The rest are left in Attack to power up U-turn a bit. Chlorophyll is better than Leaf Guard in every way. The opponent won't waste time statusing Jumpluff; they will just try and OHKO it. You therefore want to be as fast as possible.</p> <p>This should only be used on a Sunny Day team. Powerful Chlorophyll sweepers such as Exeggutor, Shiftry, Tangrowth, and Victreebel are very threatening with a Speed boost from the sun. They can also use a boosted Hidden Power Fire to deal with some of the Steel-types who usually wall them. Houndoom, Magmortar, Moltres, and Typhlosion can make great use of the boosted Fire-type moves, and if you keep Stealth Rock off the field, your opponent won't like taking boosted STAB Eruptions from Typhlosion. It can even 2HKO Chansey with a Choice Specs Eruption under the sun when at full health; this actually 2HKOs Blissey as well should you use this in OU. In OU, Heatran and Infernape are both good options for partners as they love the boost to their STAB Fire-type moves. With Flash Fire, Sunny Day and Choice Specs, Heatran can even 2HKO Blissey with Fire Blast.</p> <p>Rapid Spin support is very useful to help Jumpluff stay alive longer to support the team. Donphan is perhaps the best option as it can also set up Sunny Day and Stealth Rock while taking Rock-type moves aimed at Jumpluff. Torkoal can do the same, except it has a weakness to Rock-type moves; however, it does also have useful Fire- and Ice-type resistances. Donphan is generally the superior choice of those two as there are better Pokemon than Torkoal for taking advantage of the Fire-type power boost. Altaria, Arcanine, Camerupt, Cresselia, and Hitmontop can make good partners in UU as they can all set up Sunny Day, but also take moves aimed at Jumpluff, and in the case of Arcanine and Camerupt, take advantage of the Fire-type power boost. In OU, Bronzong and Celebi are solid partners as they can both set up Sunny Day reliably.</p>"

  "Granbull": {
    "overview": "<p>Granbull is a victim of circumstance; that circumstance being the existence of Ursaring. Ursaring outclasses Granbull in almost every way, sporting higher Attack and Speed stats, access to both Guts and Quick Feet, and to top it all off, a very useful boosting move in Swords Dance. While this in no way makes Granbull a bad Pokemon, it does make it so Granbull will almost never see the light of competitive play. However, it should be made clear that Granbull is every bit as threatening as Ursaring, thanks to its monster Attack, STAB Facade, and great movepool. If you're planning on using Granbull, be sure to make use of its perks over Ursaring, namely its access to Intimidate, Heal Bell, and Thunder Wave. Or, simply use Granbull because it's adorable. Seriously, who couldn't love a face like that?</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>As a Normal-type, Granbull's movepool is literally out the wazoo. A Bulk Up set with Intimidate can be run, but Granbull is just too slow and easily countered by Fighting-types. Toxic can replace Thunder Wave on the Support set, but Granbull is a more effective paralysis spreader thanks to its ability to capitalize on the opposing team's loss in Speed. A Trick Room sweeper set with an EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def, a Brave nature, and 0 Spe IVs can be used, but Granbull has nothing over its competition in Trick Room and Ursaring will almost always be a better candidate.</p> <p>Charm can be used in conjunction with Intimidate to really cripple any physical attacker brave enough to stay in on Granbull, but it's usually too situational. The Elemental Fangs can be used, but are too weak in comparison to Granbull's other moves. A SubPunch set can be used, but Granbull will almost always be too slow. Superpower and Brick Break are alternative Fighting-type moves to Close Combat and Low Kick, but the latter two are better suited to Granbull's tactics. Payback is a great alternative to Crunch because Granbull will more often than not be slower than the opposition; however, if Granbull does outspeed its opponent, Crunch will be the better option. A RestTalk set is also viable, but, again, Granbull is too slow to use it effectively. Stone Edge and Rock Slide are good options to pair with Earthquake to form the feared \"EdgeQuake\" combination, but without STAB on either move, Granbull will be better off using the moves listed. Taunt is a good way to prevent setup sweepers from taking advantage of the support set, but there's simply no room for it. Finally, Granbull has a myriad of special moves, including Fire Blast, Flamethrower, Overheat, Focus Blast, Thunderbolt, and Shadow Ball; however, they can't be used effectively with Granbull's meager Special Attack stat.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Weezing, Tangrowth, and Uxie are never 2HKOed by any of Granbull's unboosted moves, and can either cripple it or simply eliminate it with their STAB moves. Fighting-types, such as Hariyama, Hitmonlee, and Hitmontop, will make quick work of Granbull with their STAB moves. Ghost-types are a hard counter to any Granbull lacking Crunch, and Steel-types block any Granbull lacking Close Combat or Earthquake. Typically, strong special attackers, such as Alakazam, Mismagius, and Venusaur, can easily defeat Granbull by hitting it on its weaker defense stat. However, they are unable to switch into any of Granbull's attacks, and the latter two are defeated by the Quick Feet set.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>This set is pretty unique to Granbull, and is something Ursaring could never hope to accomplish. The main goal behind this set is to spread either paralysis or poison, and also to be a cleric to the rest of the team with Heal Bell. The fantastic thing about using Granbull as your supporter is that its Attack is actually so high it can threaten opponents with its auxiliary attacks, unlike its fellow Normal-types, such as Chansey, Clefable, and Miltank. Return and Crunch together provide decent neutral coverage, only missing out on Steel-types. Body Slam can be used over Return for the chance to paralyze opposing Ground-types, such as Rhyperior, Dugtrio, and Donphan. The power difference isn't much of an issue, considering there is no Attack investment on this set; however, Return's slightly higher damage output can be helpful when trying to eliminate crippled Pokemon, such as Moltres and Venusaur. Finally, Earthquake can be used over Crunch in the last slot to get a super effective hit on Steel-types, particularly Aggron and Registeel. However, Granbull will then be unable to damage Levitating Ghost-types, and they would be free to set up a Substitute and then do as they please in Granbull's face.</p> <p>The EVs are designed to take advantage of Granbull's decent physical bulk when combined with Intimidate. The Speed EVs allow Granbull to outspeed minimum base 50s, such as Chansey and Registeel. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Sassy nature can be used, but Granbull excels in physical defense, and its Special Defense is lackluster even with investment. Low Kick can be used in the last slot, as it damages Registeel and Rhyperior more than Earthquake and is nice for hitting opposing Normal-types such as Kangaskhan for super effective damage; however, Earthquake is still better for specific opponents such as Omastar, Arcanine, and Spiritomb. In the end, it really just comes down to personal preference.</p> <p>When fitting Granbull onto a team, you should include teammates that can take advantage of the paralysis and cleric support that Granbull provides. Rhyperior is an excellent example of such a Pokemon, as with a majority of the opposing team paralyzed, Rhyperior can easily set up a Substitute and begin wrecking the opposing team. As a bonus, Granbull's Heal Bell is the perfect remedy for one of SubPerior's biggest downfalls, Toxic. As a Normal-type, Granbull has a single weakness to Fighting-type attacks, so including teammates to absorb them is highly recommended. Ghost-types, such as Mismagius and Spiritomb, are the most pertinent answer and they also benefit from Granbull's paralysis and cleric support. Granbull lacks any form of recovery outside of Rest, which is a problem as Granbull is then limited in the number of times it can switch in to absorb physical attacks and provide support, so including Wish support to keep Granbull healthy is another good tactic. Xatu is an interesting teammate to provide Wish support as it is 4x resistant to Fighting-type attacks, and in return Granbull can freely switch into any Ghost-type attacks aimed at Xatu.</p> <p>While Granbull is not the best physical wall in existence, it is a hard stop to a unique array of physical attackers in UU. Arcanine, Dragon Dance Feraligatr, Scyther, and Kangaskhan lacking Hammer Arm are all stopped cold and crippled by Granbull (assuming Granbull is switching into them with Intimidate). Teammates who can capitalize on the insurance from Granbull against these Pokemon should definitely be considered. Houndoom is a good example, as any sweep it may attempt is usually stopped cold by the aforementioned Pokemon. Just be extra sure to pack a Ghost-type to absorb any opposing STAB Fighting-type attacks if pairing these two together.</p>"
      },
      "Quick Feet": {
        "description": "<p>A monster Attack stat, STAB boosted Facade when inflicted by a status condition, and 310 Speed (enough to outpace neutral-natured base 105 Speed Pokemon such as Mismagius) with a Jolly nature and Quick Feet activated, combine to make Granbull quite the menacing presence in UU. While Ursaring directly outclasses Granbull with the same exact set, it doesn't prevent Granbull from causing just as much mayhem. If you're gutsy enough, you could even use both Normal-types for a \"Double Dragon\"-style strategy, where one of the sweepers opens a hole in the opponent's team and the other finishes it off. Protect allows Granbull to activate its Toxic Orb scot-free and to scout the opponent's next move. STAB Facade is Granbull's main weapon, and even without any Attack boosts, it'll be putting the hurt on a lot of the UU metagame. Crunch crushes Rotom and Mismagius, and Close Combat breaks down Rock- and Steel-types, such as Registeel and Rhyperior. Low Kick is actually a stronger option for Registeel and Rhyperior and comes with the added benefit of not lowering Granbull's defenses; however, Granbull then loses the ability to blast straight through Normal-types, and it's a weaker attack for the lighter-set UU metagame as a whole.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is highly recommended because it allows Granbull to outspeed neutral-natured base 105s, most notably Mismagius, and crush them. An Adamant nature can be used for a little extra power, but Granbull's Attack is already good even with Jolly. Toxic Orb is the recommended item as it reliably inflicts the toxic poison condition on Granbull and boosts its Speed with no other side effects besides the increasing loss in health. Flame Orb cannot be used because, unlike Guts, Quick Feet doesn't negate the Attack drop from a burn. It's important to note that, should the need arise, Granbull can switch into a paralyzing move, such as Thunder Wave, and still get the Speed boost from Quick Feet; unfortunately, the chance to become fully paralyzed still exists, so this isn't recommended. Granbull can also use Life Orb and try to switch into status attacks to activate Quick Feet; however, this strategy is very unreliable, and if Granbull fails to switch into a status move, it's left with just an unboosted Facade for a STAB attack.</p> <p>Granbull is capable of outpacing a majority of the UU tier, but there are still a few threats that it needs some protection against. Registeel makes a great teammate as it can easily switch into Swellow, Sceptile, and Alakazam that lack Focus Blast, all of whom are faster than Granbull after Quick Feet, and either eliminate them or paralyze them with Thunder Wave. Granbull can beat Milotic with boosted Facade after Stealth Rock damage, but is unable to defeat a myriad of other physical walls, such as Tangrowth, Leafeon, Uxie, and Slowbro. Venusaur therefore makes a good teammate, as it can blast the former two into oblivion with Sludge Bomb and defeat Milotic with Leaf Storm. Absol is also worthy of consideration, as it can beat the latter two with a boosted Night Slash. Granbull is actually capable of 2HKOing the aforementioned walls if it runs Bulk Up in place of Crunch. If using Bulk Up, Low Kick should be used in place of Close Combat so that the Defense boosts can amount to something and protect Granbull from the ubiquitous priority attacks in UU.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Granbull is more than capable of running a bread-and-butter Choice Band set, thanks to its massive base 120 Attack stat. The main idea is to switch in comfortably on a weak physical attack with Granbull's respectable bulk, and then fire off the appropriate move. Return is for reliable STAB, Crunch demolishes any Ghost- and Psychic-types, and Close Combat blasts away any Rock- and Steel-types that stand in Granbull's way. The last slot is up to personal preference; Ice Punch nails Altaria and Torterra, while Stone Edge slices Altaria and Moltres.</p> <p>The EVs allow Granbull to outspeed minimum Speed Weezing and Clefable, as well as other slower walls, such as Donphan, Tangrowth, Omastar, Registeel, and Chansey. An alternative spread of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe and a Jolly nature can be used if you decide to run Quick Feet over Intimidate. However, Intimidate is the recommended nature as Granbull makes a much more effective bulky Choice Bander. Earthquake can be used in the last slot, but Electric-types are extremely uncommon in UU, and Granbull will get much more mileage out of Ice Punch or Stone Edge.</p> <p>Ghost-types, such as Rotom and Dusclops, are fantastic teammates to pair with Granbull as they can switch into Fighting-type moves aimed at it for free and proceed to wreak havoc on the opposing team. Even with a Choice Band, Granbull can never hope to break through Tangrowth and Weezing, so Venusaur and Mesprit make amazing teammates to clear the path for Granbull. Including partners that can take advantage of the holes Choice Band Granbull creates in the opposing team is paramount. With the opponent's walls demolished, set-up sweepers such as Dragon Dance Feraligatr and Swords Dance Scyther have a much easier time doing their job.</p>"

  "Hitmonlee": {
    "overview": "<p>Although UU does present an array of options when it comes to Fighting-types, Hitmonlee has certain assets that make him a great choice for a team. His base 120 Attack is a huge plus, and it is backed up by powerful attacks such as STAB Close Combat, Stone Edge, and Sucker Punch, all of which allow him to decimate many common Pokemon in the tier. Hitmonlee is also one of the fastest Fighting-types, sitting comfortably above the omnipresent base 80 speed tier, and Limber actually grants the frail Hitmonlee opportunities to switch in.</p> <p>Even with these advantages, Hitmonlee faces stiff competition for a spot on the team from other Fighting-types. Blaziken's Fire STAB and high Special Attack allow him to destroy Weezing and Spiritomb, common counters for Fighting-types. Toxicroak's Dry Skin gives him more opportunities to switch in, while he can boost both his Attack and Special Attack, aiding his unpredictability. With entry hazards being so popular, Hitmontop is often the Fighting-type of choice because of his ability to Rapid Spin effectively. Although competition between Fighting-types in UU is fierce, Hitmonlee has his perks, which make him a great choice for many teams. Underestimate this \"kicking fiend\" at your peril.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hitmonlee can use Bulk Up to boost his Attack stat, but he's better off attacking right from the start. Double-Edge is Hitmonlee's strongest attack against walls such as Weezing, but the added recoil and the fact that it doesn't 2HKO most variants with Choice Band equipped (specially defensive spreads have a chance to be 2HKOed with Stealth Rock) make it a lesser option, especially since it severely limits his coverage.</p> <p>Hitmonlee has access to Reversal, and it's extremely powerful when set up correctly, but he has trouble using it effectively because of all the priority users running rampant in the tier. He also has trouble setting it up due to his frailty.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Pokemon who have a resistance or immunity to Fighting make great counters to Hitmonlee. Weezing, Claydol, Slowbro, and Uxie can switch into any attack and OHKO with Psychic or burn him with Will-O-Wisp. Nidoqueen also makes a decent counter as long as she avoids Earthquake.</p> <p>The Choice sets are a bit easier to counter, as he cannot switch between attacks. Bringing Rotom or Mismagius in on Close Combat or Earthquake allows them to obtain a free turn to either Substitute or set up Nasty Plot. Take advantage of immunities and the fact that Hitmonlee is locked into one move to set up a dangerous Pokemon.</p> <p>Priority attacks will seriously injure Hitmonlee, due to his frailty. Some noteworthy examples include Azumarill's Aqua Jet and Arcanine's Extreme Speed.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>One of the major benefits of using Life Orb is that Hitmonlee can freely switch between attacks, making him less susceptible to prediction. Since Hitmonlee is already frail, the added power on each attack is a great trade-off for a small amount of recoil. With a base 120 Attack stat, powerful moves, and great coverage, not much can safely switch into this set.</p> <p>Close Combat is the core move of this set, providing Hitmonlee with a powerful STAB attack that effectively demolishes the many Pokemon who do not have the Defense to handle it. Stone Edge complements Close Combat perfectly, OHKOing common Flying-types like Moltres and giving Hitmonlee a powerful attack to deter Ghost-types from switching in. Earthquake is used to handle bulky Poison-types like Nidoqueen who would otherwise wall this set, and lands an OHKO on Toxicroak, although Blaze Kick can be used to deliver an OHKO to offensive Venusaur. The last slot gives Hitmonlee a strong priority attack, as his Speed is still quite average. Mach Punch is the more reliable option, as it doesn't require your opponent to attack, but Sucker Punch is more powerful and allows Hitmonlee to revenge kill special threats like Mismagius and Alakazam (beware of Substitute).</p> <p>Jolly is the preferred nature, since Hitmonlee needs as much Speed as possible to defeat certain threats. Without a Jolly nature, Hitmonlee will be outsped by positive-natured Venusaur, Blaziken, and Toxicroak, lowering his effectiveness when dealing with these threats. With Life Orb, the power of Jolly is usually adequate, although Adamant may be used to grab the 2HKO on specially defensive Spiritomb and a chance to 2HKO standard Tangrowth. Rapid Spin can be used in the last slot to get rid of hazards, as Hitmonlee has the advantage of keeping offensive momentum, unlike other spinners, and doesn't particularly attract many Ghost-types.</p> <p>Eliminating bulky physical walls is recommended prior to sending out Hitmonlee. The biggest nuisances to Hitmonlee are Weezing, Claydol, Slowbro, and Uxie, who can switch in multiple times and cripple him with a burn or retaliate with a STAB attack. Powerful special attackers such as Mismagius and Alakazam can OHKO or 2HKO these threats, while they enjoy Hitmonlee's ability to eliminate Registeel, Chansey, and Spiritomb. Spiritomb can defeat these Pokemon with Shadow Ball or begin setting up on them with Calm Mind. Houndoom and Arcanine can nab a Flash Fire boost, as Hitmonlee attracts Will-O-Wisp users, at which point they can begin firing off boosted attacks. Because of Hitmonlee's frail defenses, a bulky Pokemon is useful to take the priority attacks aimed at him. Milotic can defeat most of Hitmonlee's counters one-on-one because of her access to instant recovery and high special attack, as Hitmonlee's counters aren't generally specially bulky.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Hitmonlee sports the highest base Attack out of all the Fighting-types in UU (tied with both Blaziken and Hariyama), making him a great revenge killer. With Choice Scarf compensating for Hitmonlee's middling Speed, he now has the ability to OHKO faster threats such as Sceptile and Swellow before they have a chance to attack. Although lacking in power, this set focuses on eliminating offensive Pokemon rather than pure wallbreaking.</p> <p>Close Combat is Hitmonlee's STAB move and serves as his main form of attack. Earthquake is used for Poison-types, such as Toxicroak, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen, who can easily soak up Hitmonlee's STAB. Stone Edge complements Close Combat and Earthquake by hitting Flying-types super effectively, as they can switch in on most of this set with ease. The last slot is mostly filler. Blaze Kick puts the hurt on Venusaur while Mach Punch can be used to hit Pokemon that attempt to attack Hitmonlee with priority, or if the opponent has grabbed a Speed boost.</p> <p>When wielding Choice Scarf, with an Adamant nature, Hitmonlee's Speed caps at 409, outspeeding every Pokemon in the tier besides Electrode and opposing Pokemon holding Choice Scarf. Coupled with a 372 Attack stat, his revenge killing capabilities are top-notch.</p> <p>Don't try and play Scarfed Hitmonlee as you would Primeape. Primeape's access to U-turn allows him to switch in and out freely without giving any free turns to the opponent, helping to create momentum. Play to Hitmonlee's strengths, namely higher attack power and greater coverage, which allow him to revenge kill a larger variety of threats.</p> <p>Because Choiced Hitmonlee cannot switch between attacks, he is extremely susceptible to prediction. Ghost-types are particularly threatening, as they can acquire a free Substitute as Hitmonlee is forced to switch. Spiritomb is the best all-around partner for Choiced Hitmonlee, being able to switch in and eliminate Ghost-types with a STAB Pursuit / Sucker Punch combination. Strong physical walls like Weezing, Claydol, and Uxie can easily withstand Close Combat or Stone Edge, and Spiritomb handles them decently as well. Special attackers like Mismagius can take advantage of these offensively inept walls to set up a Nasty Plot and OHKO each of them. Mixed Houndoom can switch in on Will-O-Wisp and Pursuit Ghost- and Psychic-types or scorch Weezing with a boosted Fire Blast. Choice Scarf Hitmonlee appreciates hazard support due to his lower offensive capabilities. Omastar makes a fine choice, as he has access to both Stealth Rock and Spikes.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>When you supplement 120 base Attack with a 120 base Power STAB attack from one of the best attacking types in the game, you know you've got a monster on your hands. Choice Band Hitmonlee hits 508 Attack, enough to easily muscle his way through most of the tier. With the great coverage this set provides, not much can switch in safely. Pokemon that could have easily sponged an unboosted Hitmonlee's Close Combat, such as Regirock and Steelix, now have a chance to be OHKOed with Stealth Rock support, showing how easily Hitmonlee can dispose of the toughest Pokemon in the tier.</p> <p>Close Combat is Hitmonlee's powerful STAB move and is used to eliminate powerful walls such as Registeel and Milotic. Close Combat does up to 38% to the now popular specially defensive Weezing, meaning that with just Stealth Rock support it has a high chance to 3HKO. Earthquake is, again, used to hit Poison-types and now gets the 2HKO on Nidoqueen, eliminating her as a counter. Stone Edge hits Flying-types for an OHKO and prevents Ghost-types from switching in for free. Mismagius is OHKOed after Stealth Rock, and there is a chance to OHKO Rotom as well. Since every move on this set can OHKO or 2HKO every Venusaur bar the physically bulkiest, Mach Punch is a superior option to Blaze Kick, as it grants Hitmonlee a nifty revenge killing tool. Blaze Kick can still be used if you have trouble with physically bulky Venusaur, however.</p> <p>Choice Band Hitmonlee is an excellent wallbreaker that can blow holes in most teams. However, he falls prey to the crippling weakness all Choiced Pokemon share: they are unable to switch attacks between turns. This set is heavily reliant on prediction (much like the Scarfer), but has an easier time dealing with resistances because of the sheer force behind Hitmonlee's attacks (Toxicroak and Nidoking are 2HKOed by Close Combat, for example).</p> <p>Choice Band Hitmonlee partners well with teammates who attract Pokemon he can easily switch in on, such as Registeel. Alakazam and Mismagius are great choices, especially since both can easily handle bulkier threats such as Claydol, Weezing, and Slowbro. Flash Fire or Fire-type Pokemon are useful teammates as well, as they can absorb Will-O-Wisp and are benefited by Hitmonlee's wallbreaking abilities. Houndoom is the best choice because his Dark STAB and access to Pursuit allow him to trap and defeat bulky Psychic-types.</p>"

      "Substitute + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<p>Since Hitmonlee is commonly seen holding a Life Orb, opponents will assume he is Choiced if he doesn't suffer recoil after every attack. This set capitalizes on that assumption, allowing Hitmonlee to obtain a surprise KO against an unsuspecting opponent.</p> <p>Substitute eases prediction, as it allows Hitmonlee to scout the opponent's switch-in and protects him from all forms of status. Close Combat is the crux of the set, and it is complemented by Stone Edge, which delivers a swift KO against Flying-types and provides a way to hit Ghost-types. Rock Slide is a more reliable attack that still OHKOes Scyther and Moltres, but it is weaker against everything else. Sucker Punch has excellent synergy with Substitute, which forces the opponent to attack and therefore ensures it lands.</p> <p>An Adamant nature with Black Belt allows Hitmonlee to feign Choice while giving him just enough power to KO certain threats. Below are several damage calculations demonstrating the power of Adamant Hitmonlee's Black Belt-boosted Close Combat against certain threats.</p> <ul> <li>Close Combat vs. 252/0 Registeel: 94% - 111%</li> <li>Close Combat vs. 248/252 Milotic: 51.9% - 61.3%</li> <li>Close Combat vs. 52/204 Donphan: 53% - 62.3%</li> <li>Close Combat vs. 252/252 Blastoise: 48.9% - 57.5%</li> <li>Close Combat vs. 252/176 Omastar: 92.4% - 108.7%</li> <li>Close Combat vs. 212/252 Torterra: 44% - 52.3%</li> <li>Close Combat vs. 252/224 Miltank: 88.3% - 104.1%</li> <li>Close Combat vs. 4/0 Venusaur: 46.8% - 55.5%</li> <li>-1 Close Combat vs. 252/4 Hitmontop: 55.6% - 66.1%</li> </ul> <p>The strategy to using this set effectively is to switch Hitmonlee in on a Pokemon whom he can threaten instantly, such as Registeel or Chansey, and use Substitute while your opponent switches out. Once that has been accomplished, proceed to hit the switch-in with the most appropriate attack.</p> <p>Although Substitute grants Hitmonlee a great utility move, he still doesn't have the power to break through dedicated physical walls like Weezing and Slowbro. Hitmonlee should be used mid-to-late game when your opponent's team is weakened, or early on if you see the chance to obtain a surprise KO. For example, players may see the large amount of damage Close Combat does to their Venusaur and assume it's a Choice Band variant, and switch to Mismagius in hopes of setting up a Substitute. From here, Hitmonlee can Stone Edge and Sucker Punch appropriately to eliminate her from the match.</p> <p>This Hitmonlee works particularly well on heavily offensive teams, as one surprise KO can turn the entire match around. Powerful special attackers like Mismagius enjoy Hitmonlee's ability to eliminate Registeel and Chansey as well as weaken Spiritomb. Hitmonlee's ability to eliminate Milotic allows Pokemon like Rhyperior and Arcanine to sweep freely. If used on a more balanced team, a defensive pivot like Milotic is useful to sponge priority attacks and status.</p>"

  "Hitmonchan": {
    "overview": "<p>With Iron Fist as his ability, along with a base 105 Attack, Hitmonchan makes a powerful physical sweeper. Factoring in STAB and Iron Fist, Hitmonchan's Focus Punch has an outstanding Base Power of 270, while Mach Punch reaches 72 Base Power, allowing Hitmonchan to become a useful revenge killer. Access to all three elemental punches, which Hitmonlee and Hitmontop lack, is also a bonus for providing near-perfect type coverage. The downside to using Hitmonchan is the fact that he is almost helpless against defensive Ghost-types, though all in all he makes a fine sweeper.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Besides the moves already listed, Hitmonchan has a few more options available to him. Rapid Spin is available, though Hitmontop usually does a better job. Drain Punch is an option if you wish to restore some of Hitmonchan's health, though it is unreliable and other moves deal more damage. Fake Out can be used alongside Mach Punch to weaken opponents and break Focus Sashes. Counter may be used, though Hitmonchan has a low base HP stat and it won't deal a lot of damage. Hitmonchan may use Bullet Punch as a priority move, and it also gains a boost from Iron Fist, but Mach Punch is more powerful and provides better type coverage along with STAB. Earthquake is also usable, though Hitmonchan's Fighting-type moves hit the same opponents super effectively anyway. High Jump Kick is another STAB move, though its low accuracy and chance of recoil is risky at best due to Hitmonchan's low HP stat.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Defensive Ghost-types such as Spiritomb are able to switch in on any Fighting-type move and threaten Hitmonchan with Will-O-Wisp or Hypnosis. If Hitmonchan decides to stay in, Spiritomb is free to set up or weaken him with Ghost moves. Uxie makes an excellent counter to Hitmonchan, as Hitmonchan is unable to deal large amounts of damage or hit the pixie super effectively. Not only does Uxie have Thunder Wave to cripple Hitmonchan, but he also has higher Speed, allowing him to outrun any Hitmonchan running less than 156 Speed EVs.</p> <p>Choice sets are easier to counter as they are locked onto one move. Once you figure out what move is used, you are able to switch to the necessary Pokemon who resists it. This is especially true for Ghost-types such as Mismagius, who can come in on a Choice-locked Close Combat, and proceed to set up. Fast Pokemon should take advantage of Hitmonchan's average Speed and frail defenses and hit him with a super effective move before he has the chance to hit them with Close Combat or an elemental punch. Pokemon such as Alakazam and Swellow are able to outspeed non-Choice Scarf sets and OHKO Hitmonchan with the necessary move.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>This set functions primarily as a revenge killer. Using the Thunder Punch and Ice Punch combination alongside Close Combat will provide perfect type coverage; with the aforementioned moves, Hitmonchan can hit every Pokemon in UU for neutral damage besides the rare Shedinja, who is KOed with Stone Edge. Close Combat is Hitmonchan's most reliable STAB move, being able to 2HKO standard Registeel, Regirock, and Steelix. The second slot is a choice between Mach Punch or Stone Edge. Mach Punch allows Hitmonchan to outrun other priority users, like Azumarill and Absol, while Stone Edge gives Hitmonchan the chance to OHKO even the most defensive Moltres as well as Shedinja. Ice Punch hits Venusaur and Altaria harder than Close Combat and Stone Edge, whereas Thunder Punch will damage Water-types such as Slowbro and Milotic.</p> <p>244 Speed EVs and an Adamant nature allow Hitmonchan to reach 373 Speed, outrunning all Pokemon with base 120 Speed and under. Max Attack is vital to deal as much damage as possible. The remaining EVs are placed into Hitmonchan's disappointing HP stat. An alternative spread of 20 HP / 252 Atk / 236 Spe can be used with a Jolly nature, allowing Hitmonchan to outspeed every Pokemon up to and including Choice Scarf Moltres, though this would reduce the amount of damage done by Hitmonchan due to the lower Attack stat.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Milotic cause problems for this set as Hitmonchan lacks the raw power to even 2HKO either of these threats. Defensively, Chansey makes an excellent partner as she is able to switch into special attacks with little trouble and threaten to poison these Pokemon with Toxic or weaken them with Seismic Toss. On the offensive side, Mismagius can set up a Nasty Plot and hit Milotic with Thunderbolt and Slowbro with Shadow Ball. Ghost-types are a big problem to Hitmonchan, as they are immune to Fighting-type attacks and can burn him with Will-O-Wisp. Pokemon with Pursuit will spell doom for frail Ghosts like Mismagius and Rotom. Drapion is an excellent example; he can switch in on Shadow Ball without taking much damage, then threaten these opponents with Night Slash or chase them out of battle with Pursuit.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>With a Choice Band equipped, Hitmonchan achieves an Attack stat of 508. Pair this with high powered STAB moves, including priority, and Hitmonchan will be damaging a lot of the UU metagame. After all of the boosts are taken into account, Focus Punch has an astonishing 270 Base Power. However, Close Combat is the more reliable option as Hitmonchan doesn't flinch if he takes a hit. Ice Punch allows Hitmonchan to hit Grass-types such as Venusaur and Mach Punch lets Hitmonchan overcome his average Speed stat. The final slot is a choice between Stone Edge and Thunder Punch. Stone Edge OHKOes Moltres on the switch, whereas Thunder Punch gives great type coverage when paired with Ice Punch.</p> <p>Below are some damage calculations demonstrating Focus Punch's power:</p> <ul> <li>Focus Punch vs 248/252+ Milotic: 89% - 105%</li> <li>-1 Focus Punch vs 252/252+ Arcanine: 60% - 71%</li> <li>Focus Punch vs 252/0 Steelix: 116% - 137%</li> <li>Focus Punch vs 252/0 Registeel: 147% - 173%</li> <li>Focus Punch vs 52/204 Donphan: 90% - 106%</li> <li>Focus Punch vs 0/0 Venusaur: 80.46% - 94.7%</li> <li>Focus Punch vs 4/0 Toxicroak: 95.78% - 112.99%</li> <li>Focus Punch vs 0/0 Altaria: 77.32% - 91.41%</li> </ul> <p>248 Speed EVs allow Hitmonchan to outrun Adamant Absol by one point. With max Attack, Hitmonchan can deal as much damage as possible over a single turn. Any remaining EVs are placed into HP. If you decide to use a Jolly nature, 248 EVs allow Hitmonchan to outrun positive-natured Absol.</p> <p>Again, Ghost-types cause Hitmonchan problems as they are immune to Fighting-type moves. Dark-types such as Drapion and Sneasel are good options, as they resist Ghost-type moves and threaten these Pokemon with Pursuit, while Drapion also has access to Night Slash. Support from Encore is an option for this set, as it can force the opponent to repeat a support or ineffective move, such as Stealth Rock, Stone Edge, or Night Slash, allowing Hitmonchan to switch in safely. Clefable is one of the best users of Encore in UU due to her great defensive stats and Magic Guard ability. Encore would also force switches and rack up damage from any entry hazards you may have placed.</p>"
      },
      "Agility": {
        "description": "<p>The aim of this set is to raise Hitmonchan's average Speed to great levels. 88 Speed EVs and an Adamant nature give a stat of 210. This allows Hitmonchan to outrun all neutral-natured Omastar and Gorebyss outside rain conditions, and is fast enough to outspeed Choice Scarf Moltres and positive-natured Electrode after an Agility boost. Close Combat and Ice Punch give great type coverage, while the final slot gives Hitmonchan a choice between OHKOing Moltres with Stone Edge or protecting himself from status with Substitute. Alternatively, you may wish to use Thunder Punch as it deals more damage to bulky Water-types.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types cause this set problems as Hitmonchan is unable to OHKO the likes of Milotic and Slowbro, while both of these Pokemon can hit Hitmonchan with STAB Surf or in Slowbro's case, Psychic. Chansey is a great partner for this set as she is able to cripple these Pokemon with Toxic and weaken them with Seismic Toss.</p> <p>Ghost-types cause problems for this set as they are immune to Close Combat, while Psychic-types take little damage from it. Absol is an excellent teammate as he can deal immense damage to Mismagius, Uxie, and Alakazam with his STAB Dark-type moves. Houndoom is another excellent choice, being able to switch into Will-O-Wisp with his Flash Fire ability, while also hitting Ghosts super effectively with his STAB Dark-type moves. This set has problems with bulky walls such as Milotic, Tangrowth, and even Arcanine. The best option is to slowly drain these opponents with Toxic Spikes from Qwilfish, Drapion, or Nidoqueen. Toxic Stall Moltres is another good choice here too, as it can take on both Tangrowth and Arcanine with ease, while stalling Milotic with Roost and Pressure.</p>"
      },
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>Hitmonchan has a good Attack stat, decent special bulk, and a very useful ability that boosts his high-PP, low-Base Power STAB moves, making him a natural user of Bulk Up. Drain Punch is Hitmonchan's only form of recovery outside of Rest, and its Base Power is boosted considerably thanks to Iron Fist, making it the main STAB move for the set. Ice Punch provides excellent coverage alongside Drain Punch, and is also boosted by Iron Fist. In the final slot, Substitute is very useful, as it blocks status and Trick, both of which could horribly cripple Hitmonchan. After a few Bulk Up boosts, some physical attackers will start to fail to break Hitmonchan's Substitute, thus effectively increasing his longevity. However, Mach Punch is a useful priority move that has the bonus of being boosted by Iron Fist. Finally, Thunder Punch hits bulky Water-types harder than Drain Punch, 2HKOing the standard defensive Milotic after just one Bulk Up boost, and is also powered up by Iron Fist.</p> <p>Focus Punch may be used over Drain Punch in conjunction with Substitute, enabling Hitmonchan to outright OHKO the standard defensive Milotic with Stealth Rock support. However, trying to fully set up for one is quite troublesome, and you'll end up using either just Bulk Up or Focus Punch almost all of the time. The 96 Speed EVs allow Hitmonchan to outspeed Adamant Torterra, Attack is maximized for Hitmonchan to hit as hard as possible, and the rest go into HP to increase Hitmonchan's ability to set up in the face of attacking moves; Leftovers also helps with this.</p> <p>This set is more or less countered by physically bulky Pokemon that aren't weak to any of Hitmonchan's attacks; Weezing resists Fighting, and can cripple Hitmonchan with Will-O-Wisp. Claydol and Nidoqueen also fare quite well against Hitmonchan when he lacks Ice Punch, as they also resist his STAB, and can set up screens or Roar him away and set up Toxic Spikes, respectively. Therefore, a powerful special attacker such as Alakazam, who is able to deal with the aforementioned Pokemon, makes a great teammate. Hitmonchan also appreciates entry hazard support, as would any offensive Pokemon; Uxie is a great choice to set up Stealth Rock due to its defensive synergy with the Punching Pokemon.</p>"
      },
      "SubPunch": {
        "description": "<p>With 105 base Attack and Iron Fist, Hitmonchan can use the SubPunch combination to great success. Along with Ice Punch, he hits everything in UU for at least neutral damage barring Shedinja. Although Hitmonchan has decent defenses, Substitute is great due to Hitmonchan's ability to cause switches. The item choice depends on whether you wish to boost the power of Focus Punch or recover health after making Substitutes. Focus Punch is Hitmonchan's most powerful STAB move, having a Base Power of 270 including STAB and Iron Fist (324 with Fist Plate). Ice Punch allows Hitmonchan to hit Ghost-types, while also striking Venusaur harder than Focus Punch. Finally, there is the choice of Mach Punch, Thunder Punch, or Stone Edge. STAB priority is helpful for faster opponents, Thunder Punch gives perfect type coverage alongside Focus Punch and Ice Punch, and Stone Edge hits Moltres for 4x super effective damage.</p> <p>160 Speed EVs put Hitmonchan at 228 Speed, outrunning 4 Speed Uxie so that Hitmonchan can Substitute before Yawn or Thunder Wave. Max Attack is a must as Hitmonchan wants to deal as much damage as possible. The remaining EVs are placed into HP, giving Hitmonchan a small defensive boost.</p> <p>Support from Encore is suggested when using this set due to Hitmonchan's low HP stat, which means Substitutes are broken easily. Clefable is able to Encore support moves such as Stealth Rock or stat boosting moves such as Agility. This is helpful as Hitmonchan gets a safe switch in to set up.</p> <p>Defensive Ghost-types will cause problems as they can switch in on a predicted Focus Punch and burn Hitmonchan with Will-O-Wisp, weakening any physical move. Dark-types such as Sneasel and Drapion make amazing partners to Hitmonchan as they can hit Mismagius with a STAB-boosted Night Slash (or Punishment, in Sneasel's case) or Pursuit her upon switching out. Houndoom is another fine option as he can switch into Will-O-Wisp, thanks to Flash Fire, and then hit Ghosts with STAB Dark Pulse. Bulky Water-types such as Slowbro cause problems for this set as they take little damage from any damaging moves; Slowbro resists Focus Punch and Ice Punch, and he also has Slack Off to recover his health. Specially-based Grass-types such as Venusaur are helpful, as they can hurt Slowbro with Leaf Storm or Energy Ball.</p>"

  "Hitmontop": {
    "overview": "<p>Hitmontop is often one of the most noticed and used Pokemon out of the three \"Hitmons\". With its unique ability to Rapid Spin, it has a unique niche, and is constantly a top-tier Pokemon. It is also one of the few solid counters for Absol and Rock-types such as Rhyperior. Hitmontop's HP stat is rather low, however with the help of Intimidate and great defenses, Hitmontop is still bulky. With a strong STAB Close Combat or Revenge, strong priority attacks, and Bulk Up, Hitmontop is also a very effective sweeper and revenge killer. If you carry Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock, or just want a Pokemon to absorb Rock-type attacks and revenge kill, Hitmontop is definitely a good choice for your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hitmontop can use many other sets effectively, but it is simply outclassed by the more offensive Fighting-types as Hitmontop outclasses them for bulky Rapid Spin sets. A Choice Scarf set may seem like a good option with Hitmontop's very impressive movepool, however this set is almost always done better by Hitmonlee, due to Hitmontop's much weaker Attack stat. A fast Technician boosted Pursuit is always nice though. A Focus Punch set is better left to Hariyama, because it can make massive Substitutes, has a higher base Attack, and has more HP. Aerial Ace receives a Technician boost as well, and is Hitmontop's strongest attack against Venusaur and nails Exeggutor and other Fighting- and Grass-types for good damage.</p> <p>Toxic can work on the Rapid Spin set, but with Foresight, Hitmontop has a better way to hit Ghost-types than merely with Toxic, as most of them will Rest it off anyway. Endeavor and Mach Punch could work out nicely, but with priority omnipresent, and Snover and Hippopotas somewhat present, odds are it won't work well. The same applies with a Reversal set, though Hitmonlee does that better in any event.</p> <p>Choice Band can be used to catch opponents off-guard, as Hitmontop isn't expected to hit very hard due to its more defensive nature. However, once the surprise is gone, it is outclassed by more powerful and/or bulkier alternatives, such as Hariyama and Hitmonlee.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The Rapid Spin set doesn't have a lot of counters per se, because anything that doesn't block Rapid Spin lets it do its primary job. Ghost-types like Rotom, Spiritomb, and Mismagius come to mind as counters, blocking Rapid Spin and being able to burn Hitmontop, or just attack Hitmontop with a strong STAB attack.</p> <p>Nearly any Psychic-type can deal with Hitmontop, ranging from faster Pokemon such as Espeon to slower and more bulky Pokemon like Slowbro. A STAB Psychic definitely puts a dent in Hitmontop, if it isn't KOed. Weezing is a great example of a Poison-type who easily counters Hitmontop. Weezing can just use Will-O-Wisp to put Hitmontop in a very weak state.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<p>Hitmontop is one of the most reliable users of Rapid Spin in UU, making it a good choice for a team in need of entry hazard removal. In UU, Spiritomb is commonly used on teams who rely on residual damage to defeat the opponent due to Spiritomb's incredible bulkiness and ability to block Rapid Spin. However, Hitmontop is one of the better ways around it, due to the fact that Hitmontop possesses the move Foresight. Foresight allows Hitmontop to basically nullify Spiritomb's Ghost-type attribute, and hit it with Rapid Spin or a super effective STAB Close Combat. Even when used against Pokemon such as Rotom or Mismagius, Foresight allows Hitmontop to reliably Rapid Spin. With Intimidate lowering your foe's Attack, Hitmontop will get many chances to safely switch into Stealth Rock users such as Steelix and spin away the hazards.</p> <p>To make Hitmontop a relative threat to your opponent (other than threatening with entry hazard removal), Close Combat can be used with either Sucker Punch or Stone Edge for coverage. Close Combat and Sucker Punch work well with their near perfect coverage and allow Hitmontop to revenge kill effectively. However, Stone Edge is a nice attack to hit some common Flying-types super effectively, such as Altaria and Moltres. Rest can be used in the last slot as well, because with Hitmontop constantly being hit with burn or poison among other damage it may have taken, it can definitely appreciate the full recovery. A lesser option is Earthquake - while it may seem redundant with Hitmontop's STAB, it hits Toxicroak hard, preventing it from setting up for free on Hitmontop. Close Combat is preferred over other Fighting-type moves because of its high power, perfect accuracy, and the fact that Hitmontop is usually slow enough to go second against harder hitting foes, making the drop in defenses not impact Hitmontop as much.</p> <p>A more specially defensive spread with 252 HP / 80 Def / 176 SpD with a Careful nature can be used for easier spinning against Special Ghost-type threats such as Mismagius and Rotom once their immunity has been removed with Foresight.</p> <p>Pokemon with 4x weaknesses to Stealth Rock essentially rely on Hitmontop to clear the field before they enter battle. Without Hitmontop's Rapid Spin support, Pokemon such as Charizard, Moltres, and Scyther will start the battle with 50% HP, which is a bad thing in most circumstances. With Hitmontop on their team however, they can freely switch in and cause some serious harm to your opponent. If Hitmontop uses Rest, Pokemon like Altaria, Chansey, or Miltank with Heal Bell or Aromatherapy help lessen the time that Hitmontop is asleep.</p>"
      },
      "TechniTop": {
        "description": "<p>With Technician and a whole slew of priority attacks, Hitmontop becomes one of the best revenge killers in the UU metagame. Basically, Hitmontop switches into a given Pokemon whom it can KO, and uses Fake Out to cause it to flinch and deal damage. After Fake Out, the opponent's Pokemon should be in KO range for Mach Punch. Close Combat or Revenge is used as a STAB attack, both of which carry various advantages and setbacks. Close Combat can dent more physically bulky Pokemon such as Steelix for more immediate power, however, Revenge has 90 Base Power because of Technician, or 120 Base Power if used after being hit, making it a very nice option when compared to Close Combat, which lowers Hitmontop's useful and above average defenses. Keep in mind that Revenge has a negative priority, making you attack last, though. Bullet Punch is there to basically be able to revenge kill Ghost-types, and Pokemon who resist Mach Punch more effectively. However, Stone Edge is still a viable option, to hit Pokemon such as Charizard and Moltres who effectively wall this set. After all of your opponent's Pokemon are weakened and their counters are removed, Hitmontop can utilize its strong priority attacks and proceed to sweep late game.</p> <p>This offensively oriented Hitmontop is very easily walled by Pokemon such as Weezing, Spiritomb, Slowbro, and basically any other defensive Poison-, Ghost-, or Psychic-type. Blaziken is a great Pokemon for getting rid of Spiritomb, because not only can Blaziken catch Spiritomb with a Fire Blast on the switch, it can also switch in with ease into Will-O-Wisp or Dark Pulse variants. Blaziken can also lure and 2HKO Slowbro as well. Unfortunately, the weakness to Flying-type attacks is a bad thing in the UU metagame because of Swellow's strong Brave Bird and Moltres' strong Air Slash, and both Blaziken and Hitmontop share this weakness. To get Swellow out of the way, one can try many tactics. Stealth Rock can be used on a Pokemon such as Regirock, so that Swellow is forced out and will have to take large amounts of damage switching in with Stealth Rock in play, on top of status and Brave Bird recoil. Venusaur, Sceptile and other Grass- or Bug-types are decent Swellow lures, and all can take Swellow out with the correct attack, but these plans are not foolproof by any means, so keeping a Swellow counter (such as nearly any Rock-or Steel-type) is ideal.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>Hitmontop normally faces stiff competition from his Fighting-type counterparts Hitmonlee and Hariyama. The selling points of this set that distinguishes it from the aforementioned Pokemon are high Defense and Special Defense along with Intimidate. Additionally, Hitmontop has slightly higher Speed than Hariyama, which ultimately makes him a viable choice and not one inferior to its brethren.</p> <p>Close Combat is the primary attacking choice for this set and is capable of 2HKOing physical walls like Donphan and Milotic with a little residual damage. Sucker Punch allows Hitmontop to hold his ground against offensive teams; his Speed stat is still quite low, but priority will deal with a slew of faster threats such as Mismagius, Alakazam, and Rotom. Stone Edge wards off overzealous Flying-types who would normally switch into the defensive set easily. Mach Punch serves as a secondary priority move to use against Houndoom, Swellow, and Absol. Rapid Spin is also a viable alternative if you want to effectively spin on many physical walls switching into this set. Thanks to Life Orb, this set can feign a pure offensive set and will therefore lure in dedicated physical walls like Tangrowth, Weezing, and Slowbro, ultimately making spinning easier.</p> <p>The Speed EVs hit 212 Speed, allowing Hitmontop to outpace Adamant Torterra by one point. This also means Hitmontop outruns the prominent Milotic, allowing him to 2HKO her with Close Combat with Stealth Rock in play. If you opt not to use Mach Punch in the final slot, an EV spread of 84 HP / 252 Atk / 172 Spe is recommended as it allows Hitmontop to outpace Jolly Aggron, who has a slight chance to 2HKO Hitmontop with Stealth Rock and Intimidate.</p> <p>Foresight and Pursuit are viable options in the final slot depending on what you plan to do. Foresight allows Hitmontop to bypass the Fighting-type immunity of Ghost-types, which can help scare away Mismagius, Rotom, and Spiritomb switch-ins. On the other hand, Pursuit can come in handy against Mismagius and Rotom who flee in fear of Sucker Punch.</p> <p>To demonstrate Hitmontop's ability to hurt Pokemon, here are some calculations:</p> <ul> <li>Close Combat vs. 248 HP / 252 Def Bold Milotic: 48.1% - 56.7%</li> <li>Close Combat vs. 252 HP / 0 Def Adamant Donphan: 50.3% - 59.4%</li> <li>Close Combat vs. 0 HP / 0 Def Venusaur: 43.5% - 51.2%</li> <li>Sucker Punch vs. 0 HP / 0 Def Venusaur: 38.5% - 45.5%</li> </ul> <p>As with the other offensive sets, Hitmontop has difficulty beating Slowbro, Uxie, Mesprit, Weezing, and Spiritomb; the latter two have access to Will-O-Wisp and can greatly reduce Hitmontop's effectiveness. Slowbro and Weezing can be dealt with by using offensive lures such as Swords Dance Leafeon and Swords Dance Blaziken. Spiritomb, on the other hand, is a harder Pokemon to lure, but a good option is Life Orb Mismagius. Uxie and Mesprit can be dealt with by using Close Combat and Stone Edge on consecutive switches until their HP drops to Sucker Punch KO range.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is required to gain a higher chance of 2HKOing Milotic and Donphan. Although it's not completely compulsory, Spikes can also be used to score a higher chance of 2HKOing the defensive juggernaut Tangrowth. Omastar makes a fine choice for setting up both Stealth Rock and Spikes.</p>"
      },
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>Hitmontop can use Bulk Up to increase its decent Attack and already high Defense, making it very tough to take down. With Hitmontop's defenses so high, it would be a shame to waste them with Close Combat, but luckily Hitmontop has Technician to utilize the move Revenge to its fullest potential. The strategy starts by scouting your opponent's counters, and then weakening them with strong STAB attacks. If your opponent either does not have a good counter, or has a counter that relies on physical attacks, you can proceed to Bulk Up right away. With a couple of Bulk Ups, Hitmontop can sweep the opposing team with Revenge for STAB, Sucker Punch for coverage and priority, and Stone Edge to hit the rest of the Pokemon who resist Revenge and Sucker Punch. If you wish, you may use Mach Punch instead of Revenge, even though it isn't nearly as powerful or reliable.</p> <p>Pokemon such as Magmortar help pave the way for this Hitmontop set, because its main counter is none other than Slowbro, as it packs massive HP and Defense stats, resistances to Fighting-type attacks, and a reliable recovery move. Uxie is tough as well, but Pokemon such as Absol can Pursuit Uxie into oblivion, as long as Uxie doesn't carry U-turn. A Choice Scarf Absol or Drapion can be of use as well, to trap and KO Alakazam who will be a prime revenge killer for Hitmontop. Weezing and Spiritomb also put Bulk Up Hitmontop between a rock and a hard place, making Hitmontop either switch out and lose its boosts, or stay in to get burned. Absol is a nice lure for these Pokemon, as it can Swords Dance on their switch-in and 1-2HKO them with Psycho Cut and Night Slash respectively.</p>"

  "Sceptile": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Sceptile is often eclipsed by other Grass-types, such as the omnipresent Venusaur, he has the potential to effectively fill a variety of different roles on a standard UU team. As the fastest non-Uber SubSeeder, Sceptile is one of the most effective users of the strategy. Additionally, with high Speed and Special Attack, Sceptile is tailor-made for the role of fast, deadly special sweeper; access to moves like Swords Dance and Leaf Blade, as well as a usable Attack stat, make Sceptile a viable physical sweeper. Despite his offensive prowess, Sceptile's low defenses often limit his survivability. When used correctly, however, Sceptile can singlehandedly sweep or stall through large portions of the UU metagame. All in all, Sceptile is a very versatile Pokemon who is a mainstay in the UU environment and should always be considered when making a UU team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sceptile can abuse Overgrow, his sky-high Speed stat, and his ability to force switches by running a SubLiechi set. The premise of the set is to Substitute on something Sceptile scares away, and then use Swords Dance. Then, continue to Substitute, which will forcibly activate the Liechi Berry. From here, Sceptile has an astronomically powered +3 STAB Overgrow Leaf Blade at his disposal. This enormously powerful attack, coupled with Sceptile's prodigious Speed, make a SubLiechi set very dangerous. However, this set is somewhat hard to set up, and priority users have a field day with it.</p> <p>Another attractive (albeit unreliable) option that Sceptile has at his disposal is the possibility of running an Endeavor set. After surviving a fatal blow (via Focus Sash or Endure), Sceptile can use Endeavor to lower his opponent's HP to 1, as long as the target in question is not Ghost-type. More importantly, however, Sceptile's Overgrow ability activates, powering up his already powerful Leaf Storm. Even better, Sceptile can use Quick Attack to dispose of Endeavor-weakened opponents. However, the one thing restricting the viability of this set is the abundance of priority users in UU, which nullifies the purpose of this set completely.</p> <p>Sceptile has access to Pursuit, Crunch, and Night Slash, three Dark moves that can work on the physical sets. However, their type coverage is unremarkable. In the healing department, besides Leech Seed, he receives Synthesis and Giga Drain. In terms of an alternative STAB move, Grass Knot is always an option, but generally should not be used unless one is planning to use Sceptile in the OU environment. Sceptile can use Counter in conjunction with Focus Sash to produce some interesting but generally unreliable results. Screech is an interesting option but is generally overshadowed by Swords Dance unless Sceptile is trying to force switches. Sceptile receives Thunder Punch, but not Ice Punch to batter Dragons. Sceptile can throw together a Choice Band set, but Swords Dance packs more power and is generally more reliable. Additionally, Sceptile learns the Sunny Day + Solar Beam combo, but is too frail to pull it off successfully.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Defensively, Weezing is arguably the best Sceptile counter around; he resists Grass, Ground, and Fighting (the most common attack combination Sceptile uses) and can burn physical variants as well as dispatch of any variant with STAB Sludge Bomb. Sceptile is also prone to being revenge killed by Scarfed Pokemon, particularly the likes of Moltres and Typhlosion. Registeel is also a fairly reliable counter to Sceptile lacking Focus Blast or Earthquake. Chansey sufficiently walls any specially based set well; a Specs Focus Blast can only muster a 3HKO (37.29% - 43.99%). Chansey must be wary of the mixed sweeper, though - his prime objective is to lure Chansey out and then strike her with physical attacks. Clefable's Magic Guard ability, which prevents her from being afflicted by passive damage, allows her to serve as a hard counter to SubSeed Sceptile. Venusaur is also a good check to Sceptile, as he can freely switch in on any of Sceptile's Grass-type attacks (watch out for Hidden Power Ice, though).</p> <p>Flying-types, as mentioned before, are Sceptile's Achilles' heel. Swellow is a dangerous late-game threat that can outspeed Sceptile and OHKO him with Brave Bird. However, due to his frailty, he must stay on his toes and not switch in carelessly. Altaria is defensively bulky and can take on pretty much any Sceptile set without fear of retribution unless Sceptile is running Hidden Power Ice. Moltres sports a quad-resistance to Grass and can take care of any Sceptile lacking Rock Slide or Hidden Power Rock.</p>",

      "SubSeed": {
        "description": "<p>With the advent of DPP, Sceptile's ADV title of the fastest SubSeed user in the game was usurped by Shaymin-S. Now, however, with Shaymin-S banished to the Uber tier, Sceptile finally has time to shine. Sceptile boasts numerous advantages over other common UU SubSeeders, such as Tangrowth and the ubiquitous Venusaur. Most notably, Sceptile possesses a magnificent base 120 Speed, which lets him outpace the entire UU metagame (apart from Swellow and Electrode). Sceptile's ability, Overgrow, works perfectly with Substitute, allowing Sceptile to launch more powerful STAB Grass attacks if he ends up Substituting to low health. He also has a respectable base 105 Special Attack to wear opponents down faster.</p> <p>The tried-and-true strategy of SubSeeding is nothing new to Sceptile, having previously been Sceptile's flagship set in ADV. Switch Sceptile in on something he scares away (such as Milotic or Rhyperior), throw up a Substitute, and strike the switch-in with Leech Seed. From here, Sceptile's prodigious Speed allows him to create an near-infinite string of Substitutes to weather the opponent's assault, while simultaneously draining their health every turn. Sceptile can speed up the process by attacking with Energy Ball and Hidden Power Ice. Leaf Storm is a viable alternative to Energy Ball, because Substitute often brings Sceptile under 1/3 of his health (thus activating Overgrow). A STAB Overgrow Leaf Storm is tremendously strong, and can dent many of Sceptile's counters. However, the harsh drop in Special Attack hurts Sceptile's attacking prowess.</p> <p>SubSeed is a strategy notorious for causing switches, so SubSeed Sceptile is best paired up with entry hazard supporters to rack up damage even faster. Sceptile does have the misfortune of being walled easily by bulkier Fire-types, such as Magmortar and Arcanine. Therefore, it is a good idea to use Sceptile in tandem with a bulky Water-type, like Milotic or Slowbro. They provide extra insurance against Fire- and Steel-types, can Ice Beam Grass-types and Altaria, and can pave the way for Sceptile to SubSeed unhindered.</p> <p>One of the most common strategies in UU is to use a so-called Fire + Water + Grass core, which possesses excellent synergy. To complete the trinity, a strong Fire-type that can cover up Sceptile's weaknesses can be used. Arcanine and Blaziken are good choices, as they provide the firepower needed to muscle their way through SubSeed Sceptile's counters -- while trashing any overeager Grass-types who can withstand Sceptile's Hidden Power Ice. Blaziken's STAB Fighting-type attacks also demolish Clefable and Chansey, two annoyances to Sceptile. However, Swellow, one of the two Pokemon in UU that outspeeds Sceptile, is a dangerous threat that the aforementioned Fire-types cannot deal with. To take care of Swellow and other Flying-types, you can use Sceptile in concert with Rhyperior, who provides the perfect answer to these problems. Rhyperior solidly walls Flying-types such as Swellow and Altaria, and has a powerful STAB Earthquake to dispose of annoying Steel-types. Dugtrio is also a satisfactory answer to Steel-types.</p> <p>To fully reap the benefits of Sceptile's great Speed and Special Attack, both stats should be maximized. If one wants Sceptile's Substitutes to have more survivability, EVs can be allocated from Special Attack to HP. Sceptile should preferably invest at least 196 EVs into Special Attack, which allows him to 2HKO variants of Venusaur (with Hidden Power Ice) that do not invest in Special Defense. The IVs allow Sceptile to maximize Hidden Power Ice's strength, as well as provide a Leftovers number. If the need arises, Sceptile can Substitute five times in a row using the specified IVs. Note that the specified IVs should only be used if Sceptile is not running any HP EVs.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Three things make Sceptile a brilliant candidate for a Choice Specs set: his respectable base 105 Special Attack, his blazing base 120 Speed, and his wide special movepool. A STAB Choice Specs Leaf Storm from Sceptile is downright scary and will blast its way through almost anyone who doesn't resist it. Unfortunately, Grass isn't the best offensive type, so this is where the other moves come to the rescue. Focus Blast provides a high-power (albeit inaccurate) tool for hitting the likes of Registeel and Chansey, while Hidden Power Ice strikes Flying-types (specifically Altaria) and fellow Grass-types (specifically Venusaur) who are keen to switch in on Sceptile. The last slot presents a choice of Energy Ball or Dragon Pulse, two moves that are best suited for late-game sweeping. Energy Ball provides Sceptile with a reliable STAB move when Leaf Storm isn't needed, whereas Dragon Pulse offers superior type coverage.</p> <p>Specs Sceptile is a top-tier revenge killer, netting many OHKOs with Leaf Storm alone. The following calculations demonstrate the power of Sceptile's Leaf Storm:</p> <ul> <li>Leaf Storm vs. 252/0 Uxie: 66.4% - 78.2%</li> <li>Leaf Storm vs. 0/0 Swellow: 97.3% - 114.6%</li> <li>Leaf Storm vs. 244/0 Spiritomb: 91.7% - 108.3%</li> <li>Leaf Storm vs. 0/0 Houndoom: 61.6% - 71.6%</li> <li>Leaf Storm vs. 252/100 Clefable: 66.5% - 78.7%</li> <li>Leaf Storm vs. 252/252 Steelix: 78% - 92.1%</li> <li>Leaf Storm vs. 248/0 Milotic: 124.2% - 146.6%</li> <li>Leaf Storm vs. 212/0 Torterra: 88% - 103.6%</li> <li>Leaf Storm vs. 4/0 Mismagius: 108% - 127.5%</li> <li>Leaf Storm vs. 252/0 Mismagius: 79.6% - 93.8%</li> </ul> <p>This variant of Sceptile will be switching out very often, due to the Special Attack drops from his primary move, Leaf Storm. Thus, Rapid Spin support is desirable to keep Sceptile healthy in the long run. Good candidates for this job are Blastoise, who can scare away the Fire-types Sceptile despises, and Claydol, who takes care of both Fire- and Steel-types simultaneously with its STAB Earth Power. Claydol especially serves as a good partner to Sceptile, because it can not only spin away entry hazards, but also lay down hazards of its own to aid Sceptile. Arcanine and Blaziken are both excellent partners to this Sceptile, as they have wallbreaking potential and can easily eliminate special walls such as Chansey (as well as the quintessential Grass-type wall, Tangrowth) that try to block Sceptile. Fire-types also have great synergy with Sceptile, as they resist many of Sceptile's weaknesses (such as Bug, Fire, and Ice), whereas Sceptile himself defensively complements Fire-types (resisting Water and Ground). Dugtrio's useful Arena Trap ability allows him to comfortably dispose of Registeel and Chansey with STAB Earthquake, making him an ideal partner for Sceptile.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>With his excellent Speed and Special Attack, Sceptile functions quite well at sweeping with a Life Orb boost. Sceptile's pure Grass typing helps him switch into many common attacks, such as Surf and Earthquake (unlike Venusaur), and Synthesis allows him to instantly replenish his health, giving him more sustainability. Leaf Storm from Sceptile's base 105 Special Attack will destroy most Pokemon, apart from those who resist it or have obscenely high Special Defense (such as Chansey). Focus Blast is an excellent attack to open with because most of Sceptile's counters are either Steel-type or Normal-type. To round off Sceptile's type coverage, Hidden Power Psychic or Hidden Power Ice can be used. Hidden Power Psychic nails Weezing, Blaziken, Venusaur, and Toxicroak, while Hidden Power Ice deals with opposing Grass-types and Altaria. Most Grass-types, however, will take a lot of damage from or be OHKOed by Focus Blast.</p> <p>At first glance, the EV spread may seem strange, but it's tailored to do specific tasks. Special Attack is maximized because Sceptile needs to hit as hard as possible. Speed is the next thing that's considered, since Sceptile should at least outspeed neutral-natured base 110s and positive-natured base 95s. 176 EVs will suffice, but if you opt for Hidden Power Psychic, invest another 4 EVs to make up for the reduced Speed IVs, making it 180 Speed EVs in total. The remaining EVs are dumped in HP to help Sceptile switch into resisted attacks; however, with Hidden Power Psychic, 76 HP EVs will only allow Sceptile ten attacks before it faints from Life Orb recoil, so 4 EVs should be relocated to Special Defense. Otherwise, with Hidden Power Ice, the spread is a simpler 80 HP / 252 SpA / 176 Spe. Alternatively, maximizing Speed with a Timid nature is also an option. This allows you to outpace Pokemon like Scyther and Mismagius at the cost of 2HKOing Pokemon such as Registeel and losing approximately 6% of Sceptile's total HP.</p> <p>Because Sceptile is a one-dimensional special attacker, he's walled by Pokemon such as Chansey and specially defensive Venusaur. Additionally, bulky Fire-types like Arcanine and Moltres can easily switch in. This makes Azumarill an effective teammate for Sceptile. Azumarill can switch into any of the aforementioned Pokemon besides Venusaur (assuming Venusaur has a Grass-type attack) and OHKO them. Arcanine is also quite effective, since his Flash Fire ability allows him to switch into Fire-type attacks directed at Sceptile and possibly set up a sweep of his own. Sceptile also often lures in Registeel, who resists Sceptile's STAB Grass-type attacks. However, this variant of Sceptile can 2HKO Registeel with Focus Blast, opening up a path for other sweepers such as Alakazam, Mismagius, and Swellow.</p> <p>Also, with Leaf Storm potentially dropping Sceptile's Special Attack stat, Sceptile is often forced out by Pokemon like Life Orb Venusaur and Moltres. Therefore, it is a good idea to carry a sturdy defensive Pokemon to take attacks from these threats. With this in mind, Milotic and Registeel make a great defensive combo: Milotic deals with Moltres, and Registeel deals with Venusaur.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Sceptile is traditionally seen as a specially-based Pokemon because his base 105 Special Attack often overshadows his middling base 85 Attack. However, Swords Dance, the transition of Leaf Blade becoming physical, and a good physical movepool all work to make Sceptile a viable physical attacker. This set is simple - use Swords Dance to boost Sceptile's Attack to an impressive 538, then attack with the remainder of Sceptile's moves. Leaf Blade was pumped up to 90 Base Power during the D/P transition. Its decent power and high critical hit rate make it a solid STAB move for Sceptile and a must on any physical set. Earthquake provides great neutral coverage and allows Sceptile to hit Registeel and Poison-types. X-Scissor can be used over Earthquake, allowing Sceptile a way to dispose of Tangrowth and Leafeon. Rock Slide grants Sceptile universal type coverage in UU, while also taking care of otherwise dangerous threats such as Moltres and Altaria. Double-Edge is a viable alternative to Rock Slide, providing neutral coverage against the likes of Venusaur and Moltres.</p> <p>Swords Dance Sceptile, like the SubSeed variant, dislikes Flying-types, who can come in, outspeed/wall him, and OHKO with their STAB moves. Therefore, this particular Sceptile is best used in conjunction with sturdy Steel- or Rock-types, such as Steelix or Rhyperior, who can eliminate these threats. Rhyperior, again, serves as an especially great partner to Swords Dance Sceptile; Rhyperior and Sceptile have great defensive synergy. Weezing is the biggest threat to any physical Sceptile, walling him with superior Defense and burning him with Will-O-Wisp and KOing with Sludge Bomb. Houndoom is an excellent way to eliminate Weezing, as he can come in on a predicted Will-O-Wisp, which will activate the hellhound's Flash Fire. From here, Houndoom's STAB Fire moves can easily take care of Weezing.</p>"
      },
      "Attacking Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Although Sceptile is commonly seen as a sweeper or SubSeeder, using it as an attacking lead to prevent early setup is a viable alternative. Boasting a base 105 Special Attack stat, Sceptile's Leaf Storm is capable of KOing many of the popular leads utilized in the UU metagame. Quick Attack is Sceptile's best choice to beat faster, frailer leads, like Electrode, before they can cause serious damage to Sceptile.</p> <p>Hidden Power Ice allows Sceptile to beat leads such as Torterra and Jumpluff before they can set up Stealth Rock or put Sceptile to sleep, respectively. Endeavor can be used in place of Hidden Power if you opt for Focus Sash, as it allows Sceptile to beat bulky Pokemon who try to set up after Sceptile's Focus Sash breaks. Such Pokemon include Registeel, who often tries to force Sceptile to switch while setting up Stealth Rock. Rock Slide is a great move for Sceptile, allowing it to effectively dispose of Moltres and Scyther who try to kill it with their STAB attacks, especially the latter, who is a very common lead. Rock Slide also allows Sceptile to beat Swellow if Sceptile holds Focus Sash.</p> <p>The choice between Life Orb and Focus Sash is hard. Life Orb guarantees many kills that cannot be obtained with Focus Sash, such as the surefire OHKO on Ambipom with Leaf Storm and the 2HKO on Mesprit. However, Focus Sash allows Sceptile to abuse Overgrow and Endeavor, making it a deadly attacker at 1 HP. Focus Sash is also Sceptile's only way to beat Swellow and the rare Choice Scarf Scyther. Lum Berry is an option to counter Choice Scarf sleep leads like Venusaur and Jumpluff, while also avoiding Thunder Wave from Uxie, but it usually isn't the best choice due to the power and survivability Sceptile loses without its Life Orb and Focus Sash, respectively. Hidden Power Fire and Earthquake are viable options to beat Steel-types; barring Probopass or Magneton, however, Steel-types can still set up on Sceptile if it doesn't carry Earthquake. Protect can be used to block Fake Out from the swarm of Ambipom leads seen in UU, but it is hard to find a moveslot for it, and it's only important if Sceptile holds Focus Sash.</p> <p>Houndoom is a great teammate due to its ability to set up on Mismagius, whose special bulk otherwise poses a problem for Sceptile. Houndoom definitely appreciates Sceptile's ability to remove bulky Water-types such as Milotic with ease, and it loves switching in on Ice- and Fire-type attacks thanks to its passable special bulk and Flash Fire ability, respectively. Houndoom also beats the Bug-type Pokemon who scare away Sceptile.</p> <p>Spikes Qwilfish, especially with Taunt, can set up on the likes of Registeel; it can safely Taunt and absorb Toxic, netting it some free turns to set up Spikes. Spiritomb with Pursuit utterly obliterates Mismagius, who gives Sceptile trouble with its above-average special bulk. Spiritomb also has a field day with Uxie, whose high defensive stats can also be a problem for Sceptile.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>As mentioned before, Sceptile has good physical and special attacking stats. Additionally, many of his moves became physical during the DPP transition, allowing for both of his potent attacking stats to be utilized. This paves the way for him to become an effective mixed sweeper in the UU environment. This particular Sceptile is capable of destroying stall and does a very good job in taking out the premier walls in UU. Leaf Storm is Sceptile's primary method of attacking, scoring massive damage against the likes of Milotic and Rhyperior. Hidden Power Ice provides Sceptile with a valuable tool for hitting the ever-present Venusaur. The remaining two physical moves should be used in complementary pairs. The advantages and disadvantages of each pair are listed below:</p> <p>Leaf Blade and Earthquake allows Sceptile to 3HKO Registeel with Earthquake and 2HKO Chansey with Leaf Blade. Leaf Blade also provides Sceptile with a reliable STAB move. However, these two attacks leave Sceptile helpless against Moltres. Another combination is Low Kick and Leaf Blade; Low Kick grant Sceptile a valuable 2HKO on Registeel, while Leaf Blade, as mentioned before, cleanly 2HKOes Chansey. Yet, Sceptile sacrifices coverage on Arcanine and Moltres. Rock Slide and Low Kick are another good duo, as Low Kick 2HKOes Registeel, while Rock Slide lets Sceptile OHKO Moltres; this leaves him susceptible to bulky Arcanine, though. Lastly, Rock Slide and Earthquake can be used together, giving Sceptile the best coverage; these two moves allow him to 3HKO Registeel, 2HKO bulky Arcanine, and OHKO Moltres. Earthquake and Rock Slide, however, leave Sceptile without a reliable STAB move.</p> <p>In terms of pure attack power, Sceptile is inferior to other UU mixed sweepers, such as Blaziken and Magmortar. What gives mixed Sceptile viability is the sheer surprise factor. While he serves as an excellent stallbreaker, mixed Sceptile is best used as a late-game sweeper, due to the fact that he has much higher Speed than the aforementioned Pokemon. Mixed Sceptile benefits greatly from entry hazard support, which makes his sweep easier. Unlike the SubSeed set, bulky Water support is not as necessary, because mixed Sceptile has the ability to outspeed and KO most Fire-types with Earthquake or Rock Slide. However, it does not hurt to have one in reserve.</p>"

  "Blaziken": {
    "overview": "<p>Blaziken is arguably the best wallbreaker in the UU metagame, thanks to its awesome mixed attacking stats (120/110/80), Fighting-type STAB to take out common special walls, and powerful Fire-type STAB to deal major damage to everything else. Unfortunately, Blaziken wishes it were faster, as its middling Speed and defenses are the main things holding it back. However, it's a very versatile Pokemon with many viable options and a useful typing that sets it apart from fellow Fire- and Fighting-types. With so many possibilities, no one can ever be sure of what set it is running until it attacks. If you need a Pokemon to break down walls, revenge kill, or sweep late-game, definitely consider Blaziken for a slot on your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Hidden Power</h3> <p>With many of Blaziken's sets using Hidden Power, it is important to know which ones to use and why. Hidden Power Grass is one of Blaziken's commonly used Hidden Power types that can hit Water-type Pokemon. It does more damage to Lanturn, Quagsire, and Gastrodon than Superpower, and is also needed to OHKO defensive Omastar. However, when compared to Hidden Power Electric, Hidden Power Grass leaves Blaziken open to Qwilfish, Moltres, and Charizard. Hidden Power Electric hits Water-type Pokemon as well, but also hits Moltres. In comparison to Hidden Power Grass, Hidden Power Electric leaves Blaziken open to Lanturn, Gastrodon, and Quagsire. The most significant Pokemon hit super effectively by Hidden Power Electric, Moltres, can be dealt with through Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Hidden Power Ice has one use for Blaziken: OHKOing Altaria, who resists both of Blaziken's STAB attacks and has great Special Defense with a recovery move to boot. Using it, however, leaves Blaziken painfully vulnerable to Water-types and Moltres, so it is only recommended if you have those Pokemon covered some other way. The reason it's used on the mixed Choice Scarf set is because it is used in conjunction with Thunder Punch, which hits these Flying- and Water-type Pokemon super effectively.</p> <p>The last viable Hidden Power option is Rock. It OHKOes Moltres and Charizard, and dents physically defensive Intimidate Arcanine more than Superpower or Stone Edge. Again, the issue is that Blaziken needs to be able to hit Water-types hard, as they are the most common switch-ins. Stone Edge is often a better option unless you're using a Choice Specs set.</p> <h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flamethrower can replace Fire Blast on any set if you dislike Fire Blast's accuracy, but there is a significant drop in power. Blaziken can replace Superpower with Sky Uppercut or Low Kick on almost any of the sets if you dislike the stat drops from Superpower or the inconsistent damage from Low Kick, but you'll notice the decreased damage against bulky targets like Milotic. Blaziken can also run a purely physical Agility set, with the same attacks as mentioned for the Swords Dance set. It can sweep in the same fashion that the mixed Agility sweeper can, but Flare Blitz has recoil and Superpower will lower the physical Agility set's only attacking stat. Overheat can go over Fire Blast in some places for the extra power, but it will only work effectively on Choiced sets due to their hit-and-run style.</p> <p>There are still a few sets that Blaziken could run that are not mentioned above. For example, a Reversal set could be devastating, but without a reliable way to remove priority attackers it is very hard to pull off a sweep. A Choice Specs set is also viable because of Blaziken's great coverage and STAB attacks; however, this set is mostly outclassed by the Life Orb set due to Superpower and the ability to switch attacks.</p> <p>Blaziken can also play the role of a Baton Passer, capable of passing Swords Dance, Agility, Bulk Up, and Substitute. It's actually very good at doing it, because Blaziken forces a lot of switches. Choice Scarf sets can take advantage of a Speed-boosting nature to outspeed Torterra after a Rock Polish. This should only be used on the physical set because the mixed Choice Scarf set has its EVs split up already, so the additional drop in power is not worth it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Since Blaziken is such a good mixed attacker, it's hard to switch any Pokemon in safely. That being said, safe initial switch-ins include bulky Water-types such as Milotic, but they need to watch out for Hidden Power, as it lowers them into KO range from Superpower. Altaria is probably the best all around switch-in to Blaziken, as it can take any attack except for Hidden Power Ice and Stone Edge. Since it resists both of Blaziken's STABs, it is probably your best bet if you want to safely switch into Blaziken. Similarly to Altaria, Moltres can switch in on many attacks except for Stone Edge and Hidden Power Electric as long as Stealth Rock is kept off the field.</p> <p>Slowking is an amazing counter to the Mixed Priority and Agility sets, as it takes Fire Blast and Hidden Power better than Slowbro due to its good Special Defense, while Blaziken suffers from Life Orb recoil damage. Dugtrio serves as a good check to most Blaziken sets, as it can trap and KO Blaziken with STAB Earthquake; Blaziken can only muster around 60% damage with a Life Orb Vacuum Wave.</p> <p>Blaziken's main weaknesses are its mediocre Speed and defenses. With mediocre Speed, Blaziken can be easily revenge killed by any Pokemon with a super effective attack who has decent attacking strength. Pokemon such as Drapion can be taken out by a Fire Blast, but they can outrun and OHKO Blaziken. The key to eliminating Blaziken is by predicting an obvious Fire Blast or Superpower and then taking advantage of its base 80 Speed and fragility by either forcing it out or revenge killing it. For example, Pokemon such as Azumarill or Kabutops can switch in on a Fire Blast and then threaten to KO it with Aqua Jet or Waterfall respectively.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>This set focuses on using Blaziken's excellent Attack stat and coverage to deal massive damage to opposing teams. The way to use this Blaziken is rather simple: just switch into a Pokemon whom Blaziken easily forces out, such as Registeel, and fire off any attack that your heart desires. Blaziken's main attack is Flare Blitz, which can OHKO most Pokemon who don't resist it. Low Kick and Superpower hit the Rock-types who resist Flare Blitz, such as Rhyperior, for major damage while also nailing most Water-types on the switch. Thunder Punch hits Water-types such as Milotic harder, achieving a 2HKO, and also strikes Moltres, who resists both of Blaziken's STAB attacks, for a near OHKO. Finally, Stone Edge can be used in the fourth slot to smash opposing Fire-types and Altaria super effectively, but Blaze Kick could be run instead as a great recoil-less move to sweep late-game with (especially if Blaziken is in Blaze range).</p> <p>Superpower and Low Kick are both great moves for Blaziken, and both 2HKO Milotic, making it tough to decide between the two. While Superpower hits Pokemon such as Omastar for an OHKO, Low Kick has more consistent power and doesn't lower Blaziken's Attack stat. With a Choice Band, Low Kick and Superpower are both equally effective; however, the Choice Scarf set prefers Superpower because of its more reliable immediate power.</p> <p>The choice of whether to use a Choice Band or Choice Scarf comes down to personal preference. Choice Band is the recommended item choice, as most of the listed OHKOs and 2HKOs are assuming a Choice Band, and it is much harder to switch into. With a Choice Scarf, however, Blaziken is much harder to revenge kill, but has weaker offense.</p> <p>The sheer power of a Choice Band boosted Flare Blitz can OHKO a good portion of the metagame on its own, as well as 2HKOing most defensive Pokemon as well. Altaria, who would otherwise commonly switch into any of the other sets, is 2HKOed with Stealth Rock in play, and a predicted Stone Edge will easily OHKO the poor dragon. However, Slowbro can switch into this set all day, with Thunder Punch barely missing out on the 2HKO, so pairing Blaziken with a Pokemon who can easily dispose of Slowbro, such as Lanturn, is highly recommended. Grass-types, such as Venusaur and Tangrowth, can switch in on Slowbro as well as other Water-types, and threaten them with a STAB Grass-type attack. This Blaziken is also liable to get set up on by Ghost-types predicting the incoming Fighting-type attack, so packing a Skuntank or Spiritomb on your team will allow Blaziken to easily bypass those threats and continue with its wallbreaking duties. Choice Band Blaziken is prone to revenge killing by faster threats such as Alakazam, Swellow, and Scyther, so pairing Blaziken with a Pokemon who can absorb blows from these threats, such as Registeel, will greatly increase Blaziken's survivability. Spikes help this Blaziken out a lot; with Spikes and Stealth Rock, Choice Band Blaziken can actually 2HKO Slowbro with Thunder Punch, and OHKO Donphan with Flare Blitz. While holding a Choice Scarf, Blaziken will appreciate any residual damage to compensate for the lack of power.</p>"

      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set is designed to take advantage of Blaziken's great offensive stats to break down any wall who dares stand in its way. The strategy works likes this - send Blaziken in on a support move or a weak attack, such as Spiritomb's Will-O-Wisp or Registeel's Stealth Rock, scare off the opponent, and proceed to hit the switch-in with either Fire Blast or Superpower, before finishing it off with another hard-hitting attack.</p> <p>Fire Blast is Blaziken's main STAB attack that can deal a devastating amount of damage to most Pokemon, while Hidden Power covers common Water-type switch-ins. Common walls such as Registeel and Steelix are easily dispatched by either of Blaziken's STAB attacks, and Chansey is easily OHKOed by Superpower, giving special sweepers on your team a new lease on life. Vacuum Wave helps Blaziken become a fairly decent revenge killer as well, nearly OHKOing dangerous Pokemon such as Omastar and Kabutops (if it does not carry Aqua Jet) in the rain. Alternatively, Stone Edge can be used over Vacuum Wave to hit Altaria, who would otherwise safely switch into this set. Vacuum Wave is generally a better choice though, taking into account Blaziken's mediocre Speed.</p> <p>Max Speed allows Blaziken to outspeed Absol and tie with other base 80 Speed Pokemon. A Speed-boosting nature can be used to tie with positive-natured Venusaur and Kabutops, but the loss of power is noticeable. Alternatively, a spread of 240 Atk / 252 SpA / 16 Spe allows much more firepower, giving Blaziken more stallbreaking ability, but less use against more offensive teams. The 16 Speed EVs allow Blaziken to beat Adamant Aggron and minimum Speed Milotic. The added power will allow Superpower to OHKO Lanturn with Stealth Rock and Omastar after a Fire Blast, and have a good chance of KOing Milotic after a Hidden Power. Superpower followed by Vacuum Wave is also Blaziken's only means of 2HKOing Azumarill before getting hit by Aqua Jet. Either a Mild or Rash nature may be used depending on whether you want Blaziken to be able to switch into Houndoom's and Spiritomb's assaults or to have more protection against priority users such as Arcanine, respectively.</p> <p>This Blaziken set is great at breaking your opponent's walls, such as Registeel, Chansey, and Slowbro, who may cause significant trouble for your sweepers. Thus, Mismagius and Alakazam make great teammates for Blaziken, because with Registeel and Chansey out of the way, they can easily set up and sweep the opponent's team. Alakazam also has the added benefit of checking Hariyama, who may cause Blaziken problems with its bulk and Thick Fat. Pokemon such as Swords Dance Drapion can take advantage of a possible Steelix or Regirock kill as well. Azumarill is another good choice to use with Blaziken, because with Slowbro out of the way, Azumarill can sweep more effectively. Stealth Rock support gives this set many more KOs, so a reliable user of it such as Uxie also makes a wonderful partner to Blaziken.</p> <p>Defensively, Venusaur is a great Pokemon to use alongside Blaziken, as it can take the Water-type attacks aimed at Blaziken, while dealing with the bulky Water-types whom Blaziken may have trouble with. It is also recommended that you carry an Ice-type attack on your team when you use Blaziken, because Altaria severely hinders Blaziken's wallbreaking power, especially if it has Roost to heal off damage. Mismagius and other Pokemon who can switch into Ground-type attacks make great partners to Blaziken as well.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Though the common mixed Blaziken is considered a wallbreaker, almost all UU stall teams will carry one of its counters, such as Milotic, Altaria, or Hariyama. However, this Blaziken uses Swords Dance to boost its Attack to sky-high levels, allowing it to OHKO all of its usual counters and run through unprepared stall teams.</p> <p>Low Kick is Blaziken's main STAB move, OHKOing many walls (if Stealth Rock is on the field) without any drawbacks. However, Superpower is another option that can OHKO Milotic and defensive Altaria as well as have a chance to OHKO Donphan with Stealth Rock down (in exchange for the Attack and Defense drop). Superpower will always OHKO 252 HP / 252 Def Milotic, and 252 HP / 40 Def Altaria will take a minimum of 77.68% from a resisted Superpower, which is a guaranteed OHKO with Stealth Rock down. Even after the stat drops, Blaziken will have a +1 boost under its belt and a clear path to sweep. The secondary STAB move is a choice between Fire Punch and Flare Blitz. While Flare Blitz may sound like a dangerous choice for this set because of its recoil, its sole purpose is to grab the OHKO on bulkier Pokemon like Spiritomb, Uxie, and Claydol. On the other hand, Fire Punch provides a safer option without any negative side effects.</p> <p>The final slot comes down to three choices that are dependent on a team's needs. Firstly, Thunder Punch comes in handy when faced with a defensive Slowbro, as it deals 73.15% - 88.83% and has a 7.69% chance to OHKO with Stealth Rock down after a single Swords Dance boost. Secondly, Stone Edge is a nice move to hit Altaria and Moltres without resorting to Superpower and having Blaziken's Attack and Defense drop. Lastly, Quick Attack provides Blaziken with a way to hit faster Pokemon such as Dugtrio and Sceptile. Though its Base Power is less than ideal, with a Swords Dance boost, it nabs some interesting KOs.</p> <p>To illustrate the damage output of a boosted Quick Attack, here are some damage calculations:</p> <ul> <li>+2 Quick Attack vs 0/0 Dugtrio - 96.68% - 113.74%</li> <li>+2 Quick Attack vs 0/0 Sceptile - 59.43% - 70.11%</li> <li>+2 Quick Attack vs 0/0 Espeon - 65.68% - 77.49%</li> <li>+2 Quick Attack vs 0/0 Alakazam - 100.8% - 118.7%</li> <li>+2 Quick Attack vs 0/0 Swellow - 68.2% - 80.5%</li> </ul> <p>A Jolly nature is an alternative to outpace Pokemon who linger around the base 80 speed tier, most notably neutral-natured Venusaur, Nidoking, Kabutops, Toxicroak, and other Blaziken. However, the drop in power means Blaziken loses out on a guaranteed OHKO on Altaria with Stealth Rock down (Superpower and Flare Blitz both do a minimum of 70.90%).</p> <p>Blaziken fits nicely on Spikes-stacking offensive teams that use both Stealth Rock and Spikes. Stealth Rock and at least two layers of Spikes give Blaziken a higher chance to OHKO Slowbro with Thunder Punch, as well as Dugtrio and Sceptile with Quick Attack. Another way to improve Blaziken's sweep is to spread paralysis around the opponent's team. Uxie and Mesprit are great candidates for this due to their natural bulk and ability to set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Blaziken usually has trouble dealing with priority users. Ambipom is a nuisance with its powerful Fake Out + Return combo, which has the power to OHKO Blaziken. Hitmontop also has Fake Out and Mach Punch to reduce Blaziken's HP to smithereens. Azumarill can threaten Blaziken with STAB Aqua Jet, while Blaziken can't even muster a 2HKO with a boosted Quick Attack. On a balanced team, Weezing makes an exceptional partner to Blaziken when it comes to handling these threats, as it can cripple these Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp as well as lure in Chansey to give Blaziken a good opportunity to get a free Swords Dance boost. Cloyster also fits in with Blaziken due to its ability to set up Spikes while scaring away Azumarill. From an offensive standpoint, Choice Scarf Rotom makes an exceptional partner because it is immune to most priority moves and can threaten foes with STAB Thunderbolt.</p> <p>On an offensive team, Curse Registeel makes an excellent partner because Blaziken can lure in and defeat Milotic, Altaria, and Hariyama, all of whom can disrupt Registeel's setup with phazing moves or Haze. With these Pokemon out of the picture, Registeel can stack Curse boosts without fear. Feraligatr also makes a good partner because it shares many counters with Blaziken and appreciates having them significantly weakened or KOed.</p>"
      },
      "Agility": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to take advantage of Blaziken's wallbreaking abilities to sweep late-game with Agility. Fire Blast and Superpower are nearly unresisted in UU, save for a couple of Pokemon, such as Slowbro and Moltres, who are hit hard by Hidden Power. To use this set effectively, send out Blaziken on a weak or harmless attack and start wailing on the opponent's walls. Once a wall is in KO range, use Agility on the switch and begin to sweep.</p> <p>With Fire Blast as its main sweeping attack and a base 110 Special Attack, Blaziken can leave a deep mark on most targets. Superpower deals with what Fire Blast cannot, and the drops in Attack here are not as important anymore, as Blaziken should be sweeping primarily with special moves. Finally, Hidden Power Electric covers bulky Water- and Flying-types, most notably Moltres, who is OHKOed after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Naturally, Blaziken draws out its counters, but what is remarkable about this Blaziken is that it can actually beat its counters before setting up its sweep. The EVs reflect this by allowing Blaziken to KO Milotic with Hidden Power followed by Superpower most of the time, assuming Stealth Rock in play. Maximum Special Attack allows Fire Blast to outright annihilate most Pokemon who do not resist it, and 64 Speed EVs outspeeds Adamant Torterra before an Agility and neutral-natured Choice Scarf base 90s such as Moltres after one.</p> <p>The item choice is not easy. Life Orb is preferred because of the increased damage output against Pokemon neutral to Blaziken's attacks, such as Donphan, but Expert Belt lets it bluff a Choice Scarf or Choice Specs set before it uses Agility, and doesn't inflict recoil damage. A Rash nature is used over Mild because this set needs as much protection against priority attacks as possible.</p> <p>This set works a lot like the previous set, but without priority; instead, it directly bypasses Blaziken's mediocre Speed stat with Agility. Since this variant of Blaziken is a standalone sweeper (as in, it breaks walls for itself), this set only has trouble with Pokemon who normally wall Blaziken with their resistances and bulk, namely Altaria, Slowking, and Hariyama. A Pokemon who can deal with Altaria is a must; Rhyperior and Steelix make good choices due to their great physical bulk and the latter's Dragon resistance. Stealth Rock also helps deal with Altaria by taking away 25% from its health every time it switches in. Even though this set functions fine without any other boosts, it can benefit greatly from Calm Mind boosts from Espeon, who can Baton Pass to Blaziken on any Bug- or Dark-type attack.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to reliably revenge kill as many threats as possible, while also maintaining some late-game sweeping power. Fire Blast will finish off many Pokemon quite easily, while Superpower covers the rest. With Thunder Punch or Stone Edge along with Hidden Power Ice added to the mix, Blaziken will hit many Pokemon for super effective damage, which aids Blaziken with revenge killing. This Blaziken can also be used as a late-game clean up Pokemon, as once it has taken enough damage, it can sweep with its powerful Blaze-boosted Fire Blast.</p> <p>With the given Speed EVs and a Choice Scarf, Blaziken reaches a Speed stat of 384, which outspeeds every unboosted Pokemon (except Electrode) in UU. The rest of the EVs are split between Attack and Special Attack to give Blaziken as much attacking power on both sides. It may seem absurd to run a 30 Speed IV, but this allows you to have your other IVs at 31 and effectively gain a single point of Defense out of the deal for free. If you plan on running max Speed to tie with max Speed Choice Scarf Venusaur, then run the following IV spread: 30 Atk / 30 Def / 31 Spe.</p> <p>The advantage of going mixed over a purely physical Scarf set is that Blaziken's revenge killing prowess broadens. With this set, Blaziken can open with a STAB Fire Blast to deal a lot of damage to whatever it is attempting to revenge kill, and it works well to scout your opponent's Blaziken counters. With \"BoltBeam\" coverage alongside its STAB moves, there are few Pokemon whom Blaziken will not hit for super effective damage, which is important for a Choice Scarf set.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Blaziken works great offensively with Pokemon such as Swords Dance Drapion and Rock Polish Torterra, being able to outspeed and OHKO many of their counters, while defensively, Blaziken needs a Pokemon to sponge hits from opponents who can take a hit while also hitting Blaziken for a KO back. With the lack of a boosting item, Water-types will be even more comfortable switching into this set. Bringing a Grass-type Pokemon to the battle, such as Venusaur, can easily force them out.</p>"

  "Beautifly": {
    "overview": "<p>One of the weakest Bug-types around, Beautifly is simply a terrible Pokemon to use competitively. Her many terrible qualities, including a horrible typing that causes her to be 4x weak to Stealth Rock, poor stats, and a shallow movepool all make her to be a rare sight to behold in battle. Beautifly's only decent stat is her Special Attack, which even then, isn't that great because it's hindered by her poor Speed stat. In addition to this, her only real boon over other Pokemon such as Mothim is her access to Stun Spore, which, due to her frailty, isn't really that much of an advantage. Overall, don't expect Beautifly to be a Pokemon that you can simply throw onto a team and hope that she works; you truly need to base most of your team around her, and even then it's probably not worth it since there is almost always a better Pokemon that can take her place.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Beautifly's shallow movepool doesn't give her many other options to abuse, but she does have a few interesting ones regardless. One of these options is Substitute, which Beautifly can take reasonable advantage of. Depending on what role you want Beautifly to serve, she can act as a SubPetaya sweeper with Swarm, or a simple paralysis spreader with Stun Spore. However, Beautifly is simply far too slow to use such options effectively, and her frailty and weakness to Stealth Rock undermine both efforts. Beautifly also has other special attacking options in Energy Ball and Psychic, but they only hit specific targets (Water- and Poison-types, respectively), and have worse coverage overall. Finally, Beautifly has access to Tailwind as an option to boost her poor Speed, but its effect doesn't last long enough to be effective.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Stealth Rock is the bane of Beautifly's existence, stripping off half of her health each time she decides to switch in. Outside of that, Ghost-types such as Rotom do well against her, being able to take any hit except for Shadow Ball without much trouble, and proceed to retaliate with Thunderbolt. A Ghost-type can also act as a spinblocker, preventing Beautifly's teammates from Rapid Spinning Stealth Rock off the field. Special walls can easily switch in and wall Beautifly all day long. Chansey takes little from even Beautifly's strongest attack, Bug Buzz, while she can set up Stealth Rock or cripple Beautifly with Thunder Wave. Registeel performs similarly to Chansey, but has to watch out for Hidden Power Ground, though even Hidden Power Ground isn't too much of a threat unless Registeel has been already weakened. Overall, Beautifly needs prediction to deal significant damage, so predicting one step ahead of her, along with having Stealth Rock on the field, will easily defeat Beautifly.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Boasting a usable base 90 Special Attack stat, Beautifly makes a decent user of a Life Orb or Choice item. The power or Speed boost from these items greatly assists Beautifly in dealing with her shortcomings. Bug Buzz is Beautifly's strongest attack, and after STAB and an item boost, it packs reasonable power. Hidden Power Ground damages Steel-types who otherwise wall Beautifly; however, it should be noted that Hidden Power won't be able to break through the omnipresent Registeel unless it has been severely weakened beforehand. Shadow Ball nails Ghost-types for decent damage, and is Beautifly's best bet against Flying-types such as Moltres. The last slot depends on your item choice. Stun Spore works alongside Life Orb, and is a fantastic option to cripple faster switch-ins. However, if you opt for a Choice item, then U-turn is the better option to scout the opposing team for Pokemon who resist Beautifly's attacks.</p> <p>While the EVs on this set are extremely simple and cookie-cutter for a special sweeper, choosing between a Timid or Modest nature can be difficult. Modest generally works well with both Life Orb and Choice Specs as they allow Beautifly to hit as hard as possible, while Timid goes with Choice Scarf to allow Beautifly to outspeed max Speed Base 120s. However, Timid is still a reasonable option alongside Choice Specs or Life Orb to nail some Pokemon, such as neutral-natured Blaziken, before they can KO Beautifly with a super effective attack.</p> <p>Because this variant of Beautifly will be worn down quickly from switching into Stealth Rock, Rapid Spinners are useful to preserve Beautifly's health. Hitmontop and Donphan are great partners, since they can both deal with common spinblockers in the UU metagame. Beautifly also enjoys entry hazards of her own since they allow her to reach some 2HKOs and OHKOs. Pokemon who can abuse U-turn are also useful; since Beautifly is so frail, U-turn assists Beautifly by potentially giving her a free switch-in. Swellow, Scyther, and Uxie are good users of the move, the first two packing a strong U-turn to weaken walls with, and the last having bulk and a potentially low Speed stat to get Beautifly in unharmed. However, if you use Swellow or Scyther, it should be noted that you're compounding your team's weakness to Stealth Rock, making one of the aforementioned Rapid Spinners a necessity. Additionally, Beautifly is troubled by special walls such as Chansey and Registeel, so strong Fighting-types can also be good partners.</p>"

  "Gardevoir": {
    "overview": "<p>At first sight, Alakazam and Uxie both seem to outclass Gardevoir, but it can distinguish itself by being offensive and defensive at the same time. Gardevoir has a vast support movepool, including options like Will-O-Wisp, Wish, Taunt, and Encore. Offensively, Gardevoir has base 125 Special Attack, along with a good offensive movepool to deal massive damage to incoming foes. Gardevoir also comes with the rare Trace ability, allowing it to copy an opponent's ability and turn the tables on them.</p> <p>Gardevoir has a few problems to address, however. Due to it being a balance of offense and defense, this means it does not excel at either of these roles, and Alakazam or Uxie may be more suitable. As with Alakazam, Gardevoir has low Defense and HP stats, meaning that it is vulnerable to Pursuit-wielding physical attackers. Gardevoir's 80 base Speed is also rather average, allowing many other Pokemon to outspeed it. Nevertheless, Gardevoir's Trace ability, great movepool, and spectacular special stats all are advantages that make it unique.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gardevoir has an incredible movepool, making gimmicky and unusual sets possible. Signal Beam is a great move for offensive sets, striking Dark- and Psychic-type Pokemon for super effective damage. Trick Room can support Pokemon with low Speed; a Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs coupled with her average base 80 Speed make Gardevoir quite a comfortable Trick Room user. Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Hypnosis are usable to inflict even more status upon Gardevoir's enemies. Encore is mentioned throughout the analysis because it's a wonderful move in general, but Gardevoir is strapped for moveslots; it is also illegal with Will-O-Wisp. Torment is an interesting move but Gardevoir can't use it well because it lacks resistances. Grass Knot and Energy Ball are available if Water-, Ground-, and Rock-type Pokemon are troubling you. As a last resort, Destiny Bond can take a troublesome enemy down, but Gardevoir's base 80 Speed makes the idea mildly lackluster. Confuse Ray with Thunder Wave can be annoying to your enemy. Substitute and Pain Split can be utilized together, but Rotom generally does this better with lower HP, higher Speed, and three immunities.</p> <p>A \"stallbreaker\" set with Taunt / Will-O-Wisp / Pain Split / Encore and 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe as well as a Timid nature can be used. Some of the usual counters to Gardevoir such as Spiritomb and Chansey will regret approaching Gardevoir as they can't do much against this set. But because this set does not have an attacking move, it can be easily countered by any opposing Fire-type Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Any Pokemon who generally strikes hard on the physical side will usually bring down Gardevoir; however, these Pokemon should beware of Will-O-Wisp. Houndoom, although weak to Focus Blast, makes a great counter to any Gardevoir set due to its Flash Fire ability, which absorbs Will-O-Wisp for enhanced Fire-type damage, and Pursuit, which will destroy Gardevoir if it switches. Other Dark-type Pursuit users, such as Drapion, Absol, Skuntank, and Spiritomb, will usually defeat Gardevoir immediately if they avoid switching into Will-O-Wisp (or Focus Blast, in Absol's case).</p> <p>On the defensive side, Chansey, and to a lesser extent Clefable, both wall Gardevoir comfortably, although Clefable is vulnerable to Focus Blast at times. Clefable can come in and Encore any support move that Gardevoir uses. Gardevoir will only end up hindering itself if it tries Tricking Clefable, as the Choice item will usually be swapped for a Toxic Orb in the exchange. Chansey can come in on any move except Trick and wall Gardevoir with its massive HP and Special Defense while draining Gardevoir's HP with Seismic Toss; however, Chansey should watch out for Pain Split stealing its massive HP. Clefable also doesn't mind Will-O-Wisp due to Magic Guard while Chansey has Natural Cure to heal the burn off on the switch. Both must watch out for Taunt though, which can turn both into setup bait for Gardevoir.</p> <p>In addition to the specially defensive Normal-types, Steel-types who can survive a Focus Blast will be a nuisance to Gardevoir. Registeel can switch into a Psychic or Shadow Ball, cripple Gardevoir with Thunder Wave, and strike it down with repeated Iron Heads, although it must be wary of Will-O-Wisp. Having a user of Aromatherapy or Heal Bell, such as Chansey or Uxie, is a great way to heal teammates from Gardevoir's status moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to support the team by burning and cutting the opponent's Attack stat in half while providing overall healing with the help of Gardevoir's immense special bulk. Will-O-Wisp allows Gardevoir to cripple enemy physical attackers, such as Absol, Drapion, and Spiritomb, with a damaging burn. To restore Gardevoir's health, it can use Wish and Protect; the combination essentially gives Gardevoir a 50% recovery move. Protect also helps Gardevoir stall while the opponent is continuously hurt by burn. If a cleric is needed, Gardevoir can perform that role as well thanks to Heal Bell, but note that Wish will become much more difficult to use since you no longer have room for Protect. Therefore, when using Heal Bell, choosing Pain Split as the health recovery move is recommended. Last but not least, Psychic is Gardevoir's STAB option to deal damage.</p> <p>If Pain Split is being used, note that it can perform either better or worse than Wish and Protect depending on the circumstances. Against Clefable, Wish and Protect would be the superior option due to Clefable’s merely fine HP stat. However, if Pain Split is used on Chansey, expect a massive amount of health stolen due to its base 250 HP. In other cases, the opponent could switch in a low HP Pokemon on a Pain Split, essentially making Gardevoir waste a turn hurting itself.</p> <p>Although not mentioned, Thunderbolt can be used in the fourth slot if Protect or Heal Bell aren't necessary. Thunderbolt allows Gardevoir to attack Pokemon who take little or no damage from Psychic, such as Drapion, Houndoom, and Mesprit. Gardevoir can also utilize Taunt, which can stop slower walls from using support moves. Lastly, Hypnosis and Thunder Wave are usable for double status. Hypnosis can effectively remove a Pokemon from play. Thunder Wave can slow down deadly Pokemon such as Arcanine and Houndoom, allowing your teammates to outrun and KO them.</p> <p>The EVs allow Gardevoir to be as specially bulky as possible. 252 HP and 252 Special Defense EVs allow Gardevoir to survive dangerous attacks such as Life Orb Dark Pulse from +2 Modest Toxicroak, Choice Specs Shadow Ball from Timid Rotom, and Life Orb Surf in the rain from Omastar. Gardevoir can also use a more physically bulky spread with 252 HP / 124 Def / 132 SpD. With this spread, Gardevoir takes 42.4% - 50% from Jolly Life Orb Hitmonlee's Close Combat. In return, Gardevoir has a high chance to OHKO Hitmonlee even without Close Combat's defenses drops with Psychic despite no Special Attack investment.</p> <p>Gardevoir will usually run into trouble against Flash Fire Pokemon--namely Houndoom and Arcanine--who can absorb its Will-O-Wisp. Teammates who can deal with these Pokemon are extremely beneficial to Gardevoir. Against these Fire-types, Water-type Pokemon such as Blastoise and Milotic can switch in and destroy them with Surf. Pokemon with Calm Mind and Taunt or Substitute, such as Mismagius and Alakazam, are equally threatening. Encore can be used over Heal Bell to remedy this weakness if the foe isn't using Taunt, but note that Will-O-Wisp is illegal with Encore, so Thunder Wave or Hypnosis will have to replace Will-O-Wisp. Alternatively, Registeel deals with Mismagius, Alakazam, and even certain physical priority users such as Ambipom and Scyther, but be wary that Registeel may take a good chunk of damage in return, especially if you mispredict and switch into the wrong attack.</p> <p>Strong physical attackers who outspeed Gardevoir and have not been burned by Will-O-Wisp will be a problem, especially Pursuit users. Venusaur, Scyther, and Absol all fall in this problematic category. Therefore, a strong physical tank or wall, such as Registeel, Rotom, or Weezing, will make a good partner for Gardevoir. Registeel can Thunder Wave these threats, while the other two can burn them if Gardevoir fails to do so on the switch.</p>"

To top the set off, Trick allows Gardevoir to cripple an incoming wall, such as Chansey, Clefable, and Registeel, with an unwanted item. To deal with Psychic- and Ghost-types, such as the aforementioned Shedinja and Exeggutor, Shadow Ball is a great alternative move over Trick.</p> <p>The EVs listed apply only if Gardevoir is using a Timid nature. 252 Speed EVs allow Gardevoir to reach 426 Speed with a Choice Scarf, outrunning everything up to and including Electrode and Modest Choice Scarf Rotom. If Modest is the chosen nature, 16 Def / 252 SpA / 240 Spe should be used. 240 Speed EVs reach 384 Speed, outrunning max Speed positive nature base 125 Pokemon, namely Swellow. As for the item, Choice Scarf is the main option as it gives Gardevoir's base 80 Speed a grand boost, allowing her to outrun and deal good damage to most threats. On the other hand, Choice Specs does nothing for Gardevoir's Speed, but it does provide an incredible power boost behind every attack; for instance, Gardevoir has a chance to 2HKO standard Registeel and OHKO 252 / 252 Calm Clefable with Focus Blast.</p> <p>Choice Gardevoir has a rough time with Pursuit users, especially those who resist or are immune to Psychic. Drapion, Absol, and Spiritomb are all massive threats for this reason. Unfortunately, there is not much that can be done, especially if Gardevoir finishes off a Pokemon and a Pursuit user switches in for the revenge kill. Caution is therefore required if Gardevoir is needed to KO important Pokemon. Double switching Gardevoir out to a Pokemon who can take on the aforementioned Dark-types, such as Donphan and Venusaur, may seem like a lousy waste of a turn, but this effectively scouts what Pursuit user the foe may have.</p> <p>Even with Trick, Gardevoir will still have problems with special walls, primarily Chansey. Dugtrio will solve any Chansey problems with his Arena Trap ability and Earthquake unless Chansey holds Shed Shell. If Dugtrio isn't suitable, Pursuit users on Gardevoir's side will work as well. Drapion, Absol, and Spiritomb, despite being vulnerable to status from Chansey, are some STAB Pursuit users who can trap and defeat it. Defensive Fighting-types such as Hitmontop and Hariyama will also help out against Chansey, although rare is the scenario where an opponent will leave Chansey in against these Fighting-types. Hitmontop also comes with a Technician-boosted Pursuit.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Gardevoir with Calm Mind can sweep whole teams given the right scenario. With the moves to provide neutral coverage as well as stopping walls or tanks from being annoying, Gardevoir can prove to be a stable Calm Mind sweeper.</p> <p>Calm Mind is the purpose of this set, allowing Gardevoir to increase her special stats to astounding levels. Focus Blast and Shadow Ball together hit every Pokemon for neutral damage, and crucially both can hit Pokemon whom Gardevoir cannot harm with her STAB Psychic for super effective damage, such as Registeel, Uxie, and Absol. Thunderbolt is a great alternative move over Shadow Ball to provide more damage against a different group of Pokemon, such as Milotic, Moltres, and Drifblim. Psychic is Gardevoir's best STAB attack to use, but its coverage may be redundant. As such, Taunt is a great replacement over Psychic to prevent status from incoming walls while also stopping them from restoring their health.</p> <p>If Gardevoir has Taunt in place of Psychic, note that there will be cases where Psychic's reliable STAB will be missed. For example, a Clefable with around 30% HP can faint from Gardevoir's Focus Blast, but in this case Psychic would be the better option due to its 100% accuracy as opposed to Focus Blast's 70%. Against Pokemon who take neutral damage from both Shadow Ball and Focus Blast, such as Arcanine and Lanturn, Psychic does more damage.</p> <p>Although better suited for defensive sets, Will-O-Wisp in the fourth slot can help Gardevoir cripple physical threats, which enables Gardevoir to set up more Calm Minds. This gives Gardevoir two roles in one: a supporter and a sweeper.</p> <p>Maxing Gardevoir's Speed stat gives 284 Speed, Speed-tying with Pokemon such as Venusaur, Kabutops, and Blaziken. All three of these Pokemon can be slaughtered by Psychic (or Thunderbolt in Kabutops's case). As for the item, Life Orb allows Gardevoir to dish out more damage at the cost of being more fragile. However, if that's not favorable, Leftovers can be used to give Gardevoir more survivability.</p> <p>Because Gardevoir has only base 80 Speed and base 65 Defense, faster physical attackers such as Dugtrio, Drapion, and Scyther can switch in on a Calm Mind and threaten with their most damaging move or Pursuit (or plainly trap Gardevoir in Dugtrio's case). Scouting for these Pokemon beforehand and burning or paralyzing them with Pokemon such as Rotom, Registeel, and Clefable would help Gardevoir destroy these Pokemon when they switch back in.</p> <p>Encore users and dedicated special walls, such as Clefable, Chansey, and Spiritomb, also pose problems for this set if it lacks Taunt, as they can lock Gardevoir into one move, which Calm Mind Gardevoir does not like, or just plainly wall and wear down Gardevoir. Physically-minded Pokemon such as Guts Hariyama, Aggron, and Arcanine can help Gardevoir out against these threats. Guts Hariyama can pummel the two Normal-types while absorbing status from all three. Stone Edge or Payback from Hariyama will also eventually destroy Spiritomb who lack Rest. Aggron must watch out for status from the three Pokemon, but if he can get in on an attack, he will deal devastating damage against them with his Head Smash. Non-RestTalk Arcanine plays much more conservatively with Morning Sun and Flash Fire, but watch out for incoming Thunder Wave when using him. Arcanine with Intimidate also helps out against physical Spiritomb.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>The goal of this set is to reliably set up dual screens and then use Memento, giving a sweeper an essential free switch-in. With her sacrifice, Gardevoir ensures that your incoming sweeper has a higher chance of sweeping the opponent's team.</p> <p>With the help of Light Clay increasing the duration of dual screens, Reflect and Light Screen become very potent for handling packs of vicious attackers. Reflect should be used first to patch up Gardevoir's weaker Defense stat, followed by Light Screen as a matter of course. Once both screens have been set up, Memento should be used to faint Gardevoir while crippling both of the opponent's offensive stats. This allows a sweeper to switch in without fear of being damaged greatly while also forcing the opponent to switch out. To help Gardevoir set up the screens and support the sweepers, Taunt can be used to safeguard against annoying status moves, especially sleep, and support moves, such as Stealth Rock, Wish, and Toxic Spikes. Will-O-Wisp is a great alternative to cripple physical attackers; when combined with Reflect, physical attackers will no longer be a problem. Lastly, Psychic allows Gardevoir to avoid being setup bait when Taunted.</p> <p>Healing Wish can be used over Memento if the protection provided by dual screens is generally enough. This allows a sweeper from early-game to be usable again in late-game. However, if Gardevoir did not take the attack beforehand, make sure that when switching in the sweeper won't be KOed by the incoming attack while switching in.</p> <p>This particular Gardevoir specifically wants dedicated setup sweepers who can make use of the dual screens and Memento. Sweepers who are resistant or take little damage from Gardevoir's weaknesses should be considered; examples include Swords Dance Drapion, Rock Polish Aggron, Dragon Dance Altaria, and Swords Dance or Agility Blaziken.</p> <p>Fast Taunt and Encore users can be annoying to this Gardevoir as they can stop her from doing her job or lock her into a useless move. Ambipom, Mismagius, and Alakazam are able to do this, but at the same time are very fragile as well. Choice Band Spiritomb can easily switch into any of these Pokemon and remove them with Pursuit. Toxic Orb Swellow, on the Taunt or Encore, can outspeed and OHKO all three of these Pokemon with Brave Bird or Facade, but needs to be sure he is not switching into an attack. Swellow can also utilize Pursuit to trap the aforementioned threats.</p>"
      },
      "Weather Counter": {
        "description": "<p>This Gardevoir set is a little more specialized, and therefore more situational, than her other sets, but it still functions well in the UU metagame. The basic premise of the set is to use Gardevoir as an all-out attacker, who, at the same time, can act as one of the best Rain Dance checks in the UU tier. When countering rain teams, the idea is to switch Gardevoir into one of the opponent's Swift Swim Pokemon and copy its ability with Trace. After Gardevoir has Traced Swift Swim, she becomes faster than every other Swift Swim abuser (with the exceptions of Floatzel and Qwilfish). From there, Gardevoir can use the rain to her advantage and turn the tables on the opponent, forcing them to go on the defensive. The great thing about Gardevoir as a rain check is that she can continue to sweep outside of the rain, thanks to her good Speed and tremendous Special Attack stats.</p> <p>Psychic is the STAB move of choice and is a strong, reliable move that allows Gardevoir to destroy Venusaur and the multitude of Fighting-types in the tier. The other moves give Gardevoir excellent coverage, as well as the best possible combination of moves to counter-sweep a rain team. Thunderbolt combines with Psychic for near perfect neutral coverage in UU, as it smacks Milotic, Moltres, and Slowbro for super effective damage; it also OHKOes every Swift Swim sweeper outside of Ludicolo. Shadow Ball can be run over Thunderbolt to nail Ghost-types, especially Rotom and Mismagius, and Psychic-types for super effective damage. As Gardevoir is an attacker first and a rain check second, being walled too easily by common walls such as Registeel, Chansey, and Clefable is a problem. Focus Blast solves this problem by 2HKOing Registeel and dealing 74.6% - 88.3% to the standard Clefable, which is a KO if Clefable first switches in on Psychic. Unfortunately, Gardevoir remains utterly walled by Chansey. If you find Focus Blast's accuracy to be a huge turn off, Signal Beam is a good substitute, allowing Gardevoir to hit Ludicolo, the most popular rain sweeper in UU; fellow Psychic-types, such as Uxie, Mesprit, and Slowking; and pure Grass-types, including Tangrowth and Leafeon, for super effective damage; coincidentally, the aforementioned Psychic-types are also common rain starters. Keep in mind that Shadow Ball and Signal Beam should never be used in conjunction, as they have a lot of overlapping coverage, and Gardevoir will be left out in the cold versus a whole myriad of Pokemon. The last slot is left for Will-O-Wisp, which is Gardevoir's best auxiliary move inside and outside rain, allowing it to cripple potential Dark-type counters such as Spiritomb, Absol, Drapion, and Skuntank.</p> <p>Expert Belt can be run over Life Orb thanks to Gardevoir's excellent super effective coverage, and it also gives it a little more survivability. However, the slight loss in power is a turn-off, as Expert Belt makes it so that Gardevoir is required to run Thunderbolt to OHKO the aforementioned rain sweepers. Energy Ball is a nice replacement for Thunderbolt and gets all the same OHKOs on the rain sweepers while also having the added benefit of hitting Rhyperior, Donphan, and Lanturn for super effective damage. If you are hell-bent on stopping rain at all costs, Taunt can be used to ensure that Rain Dance cannot be used in front of Gardevoir. Outside of rain, Taunt lets Gardevoir shut down Chansey, Registeel, and Clefable without the need for Focus Blast. Finally, Reflect or Light Screen can be used to provide a buffer against incoming revenge killers such as Dark-type Pursuit users, as well as to support the rest of Gardevoir's team.</p> <p>If rain is not a factor in the battle, Gardevoir works well as an all-out attacker. Just bring in Gardevoir on weak special attacks, such as Milotic's Surf, and let loose with any attack your heart desires. Gardevoir's ability also comes into play here, as it is able to Trace Lanturn's Volt Absorb as it switches in and be healed from Lanturn's Thunderbolt. It can do the same to Water Absorb users such as Quagsire and Poliwrath and Flash Fire users like Arcanine and Houndoom (extreme caution should be taken around the latter, however). The trickiness comes into play when using Gardevoir as a rain check, as its low physical defense makes it hard for it to switch into the above Swift Swim sweepers safely. It is OHKOed by most of their attacks under the rain, so in most cases, she will have to be brought in after a teammate has been KOed. Another strategy is to employ a double-switch with a teammate such as Registeel, who walls a majority of rain sweepers. U-turn from a partner such as Uxie will also give it the opportunity to come in safely. Coincidentally, Gardevoir also makes a good Sunny Day check. With Signal Beam and Psychic, it has no problem OHKOing a majority of the normal Chlorophyll sweepers, such as Shiftry, Exeggutor, Victreebel, and Vileplume, and gets a near OHKO on Tangrowth.</p> <p>Donphan and Cloyster make good teammates; they can Rapid Spin, wall physical attacks aimed at Gardevoir, and set up their own entry hazards. Lead Cloyster can also prevent Uxie from getting up Stealth Rock while also setting up its own hazards. Priority users can clean up any KOs Gardevoir may have missed; Ambipom, Hariyama, and Hitmontop all make excellent teammates, as do the aforementioned Donphan and Cloyster. Fire-types can make the most of a lack of Rain Dance, especially Arcanine, Houndoom, and Blaziken. Pursuit trappers can trap and KO Gardevoir, so pairing Gardevoir with a Fighting-type such as Toxicroak, Hitmonlee, or the aforementioned Hariyama and Hitmontop ensures that your team can revenge kill the Pursuit trapper should it be KOed while trying to escape. As Gardevoir still has problems with Ghost-types even when using Shadow Ball, pairing it with a Pursuit user can be highly beneficial and can allow it to continue a clean sweep of the opponent's team.</p>"

  "Exploud": {
    "overview": "<p>Discounting the mighty Arceus, Exploud has (arguably) the best mixed attacking stats of any Normal-type in the game. With a diverse offensive movepool to match, Exploud would seem to be a very prominent wallbreaker in the metagame. To the contrary, however, he is not, for his attacking stats come at the expense of his defenses and Speed, and even his beefy base 104 HP isn't enough to save him in this regard. Normal STAB is also not that great, being resisted by a fair number of popular Pokemon, and being super effective against none. Regardless of these issues, Exploud makes a fine offensive Pokemon, and can really shine when given the right circumstances and support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Exploud makes a fantastic Baton Pass recipient, as he has all the right stats and movepool to be one. He also has Soundproof to block out any attempts to Roar him out. A pass could come from either a chain, or from a Pokemon such as Gligar. Fire Blast and Flamethrower are good special attacks, but have rather redundant coverage alongside Earthquake. Going primarily special is an option, using Hyper Voice for STAB, and moves such as Surf, Fire Blast, Shadow Ball, and Focus Blast for coverage. Exploud's physical attacks are generally more powerful though. Choice sets are fine, but Exploud is generally too slow to pull one off effectively. Howl is an interesting move, but Exploud is pretty much outclassed in that area by Swords Dance Zangoose.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Despite his excellent coverage, Exploud can still be beaten by several bulky Pokemon. Bulky Water-types such as Milotic, who are sturdy enough to avoid being 2HKOed by Return, make great checks. Spiritomb isn't 2HKOed by Crunch, and can burn Exploud with Will-O-Wisp. Defensive Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Hitmontop are able to take a few hits and KO with their STAB attacks. Without Surf, physical behemoths such as Steelix and Regirock have little to fear from Exploud, while Torterra is able to take him on when he lacks Ice Beam. Finally, pretty much any offensive Pokemon can come in on the revenge kill quite effectively if Exploud has no Substitute up.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Exploud's eloquent movepool backed up by his impressive mixed attacking stats allow him to put a dent on just about anything in UU with the right move. This set takes advantage of this quality to maximize Exploud's potential. Return is Exploud's most appropriate STAB move, having absolutely no drawbacks and sporting a very respectable Base Power. Earthquake covers those annoying Steel- and Rock-types that resist Return, while Crunch does the same for Ghost-types, who sport an immunity to Return. Having already achieved perfect coverage with those three moves, the fourth slot is for a leisure move more than anything else. Surf OHKOes Rhyperior, who would otherwise be able to take an Earthquake and retaliate, and does more damage to the likes of Steelix and Donphan as well. On the other hand, Ice Beam deals massive damage to Torterra and Altaria.</p> <p>Life Orb gives Exploud the power he needs to achieve the KOs he does, which is why it's the recommended item here. As always, Leftovers is still a viable alternative for survivability. Low Kick has roughly the same coverage as Earthquake, but is only more powerful against Pokemon already covered by Surf or Ice Beam. The EVs maximize Attack and give Exploud enough speed to outpace positive-natured base 50s such as Aggron. The rest is then sprinkled into Special Attack to power up the fourth move.</p> <p>Seeing as Exploud is an offensive Pokemon, entry hazards will be very helpful in improving his chances of success by passively weakening the opposition, securing KOs he may not have had otherwise. Claydol and Nidoqueen are great Pokemon for this, and they both can switch into the Fighting-type moves that Exploud fears. Paralysis support is also favorable for the slow Exploud, and it can be easily provided by an ample number of Pokemon; Rotom, Venusaur, and Uxie being just some of them. Finally, Pokemon that can take advantage of a weakened defensive team make great teammates, particularly those that attempt to set up and sweep late-game.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute": {
        "description": "<p>Exploud's defenses aren't too great, but he has the movepool and attacking stats to threaten anything, making him more than capable of using Substitute to his advantage. While a mixed set is more comfortable dealing with defensive teams, Substitute Exploud can tear apart offensive teams with proper prediction. Return returns (pardon the pun) as the preferred STAB move, with good Base Power and no drawbacks, while Earthquake and Crunch cover everything that resists Return. Substitute is a given, and Leftovers help Exploud cope with the health loss from making Substitutes.</p> <p>As for the given EV spread, Attack is maximized so that Exploud can deal as much damage as he possibly can. Then, HP is pumped so that Exploud can create 101 HP Substitutes, punishing foes that rely on Seismic Toss to deal damage, namely Chansey. The remainder is sent to Speed, conveniently allowing Exploud to outspeed all neutral nature base 40 Speed Pokemon, most notably Rhyperior. Some defensive Pokemon also tend to lurk around this Speed tier, however, so additional Speed EVs can be invested in order to outpace them as well. The benefits of a simple maximum Attack and maximum Speed spread are also there, so that's also an option, and so is everything in between, really. Low Kick and Hammer Arm make viable alternatives to Earthquake here, though Low Kick doesn't have consistent damage and Hammer Arm lowers Exploud's already barely-adequate Speed.</p> <p>Entry hazard support is especially useful here because of the typical switch-causing effect of a Substitute set. Spikes are good for hitting the grounded targets that Exploud usually lures in, and they can be set up by Qwilfish, who resists Fighting. Special attackers such as Mismagius make great offensive teammates here because of their ability to bring out Registeel and Chansey, two Pokemon that Exploud can set up on with particular ease. The reverse is true in the case of Mismagius, who can easily set up on the kind of Pokemon that Exploud attracts.</p>"

  "Mawile": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite possessing great defensive typing, an excellent ability in Intimidate, and an undeniable cool factor, Mawile is almost never seen on UU teams. A quick look at its stats will tell you why; its Attack and Defense are average at best, and the rest are terrible. Justifying a spot on your team for Mawile is difficult when other Steel-types with much better stats are available. Luckily, Mawile does have a few tricks up its sleeve that prevent it from being entirely outclassed by Registeel and Aggron, but only in very specific roles. If you're not catering to Mawile's few advantages, you're better off using another Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An offensive set that boosts Mawile's average Attack with Swords Dance or a Choice Band is the most obvious omission, but Mawile simply doesn't have the bulk, power, or Speed necessary to pull it off. A Swords Dance set will get one or two hits in at most before being KOed, while a Choice Band set just isn't powerful enough. However, if you are set on using Mawile offensively, its best attacking options are Iron Head, Focus Punch, Brick Break, Sucker Punch, Crunch, Payback, Rock Slide, and the elemental punches. Mawile can also act as a stallbreaker with a moveset of Taunt, Super Fang, Sucker Punch, and Rest. This set can consistently beat stalling Pokemon who rely on Seismic Toss and Toxic to do damage, such as Chansey and Registeel, but against most other Pokemon it will fail miserably, so it's usually not worth it.</p> <p>Body Slam can go over Iron Head if you like the 30% paralysis rate, as Mawile won't be doing much damage anyway. Pain Split provides instant recovery, but it is unreliable and Mawile won't be surviving long regardless. Sing can take out a counter and give Mawile a extra turn to set up, but its accuracy is horrible and Mawile cannot afford to miss. Stockpile increases both defenses and gives Mawile another type of boost to pass, but offensive boosts are generally more useful and Mawile will rarely have time to set up both types at once. Charge Beam is even worse, since the boost isn't guaranteed, and Mawile doesn't directly benefit from increased Special Attack in any way, but it's still theoretically an option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Mawile has a rather long list of counters. Blaziken, Moltres, Arcanine, Houndoom, Hitmonlee, and Primeape all outspeed Mawile and easily OHKO it with STAB Fire Blast, Flare Blitz, or Close Combat. Drapion and Gligar are faster than Mawile and can use Taunt to prevent it from passing its boosts. They also have enough physical bulk to take a boosted Iron Head if Mawile chooses to attack rather than switch out. Alakazam and Jumpluff have a fast Encore that will force Mawile to either switch or become setup fodder. Mawile is slow and rather frail, especially on the special side, so any offensive Pokemon with a neutral or super effective STAB attack should be able to take it down without much trouble.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>Baton Passing is one role Mawile can fill that no other UU Steel-type can. With its passable physical bulk and good defensive typing, Mawile should be able to find an opportunity to grab a Swords Dance boost and pass it on to a capable sweeper. Taunt prevents Mawile from being shut down by the opposing Pokemon's Taunt, Haze, or phazing moves, although if the opponent is faster, Mawile will have to Taunt it on the switch. In the last slot, Substitute is useful to provide a buffer from status, critical hits, and powerful attacks that would otherwise KO Mawile, and can also be Baton Passed to Mawile's teammates. However, a Pokemon with no damaging attacks can sometimes turn into dead weight, so Iron Head is a reasonable option instead as a reliable STAB attack.</p> <p>Either ability can be used with this set. Hyper Cutter prevents Mawile's boosts from being lost to Intimidate from Arcanine and Hitmontop, both of whom are common switch-ins to Mawile. On the other hand, Intimidate gives Mawile more opportunities to come in safely and set up against weaker physical attackers. The listed EVs allow Mawile to outspeed Adamant Torterra, who would otherwise OHKO with Earthquake, as well as most of UU's walls. A slower, bulkier spread could be used to try to keep Mawile alive longer and accumulate more boosts, but it leaves Mawile more vulnerable to Taunt, Haze, and other disruptive moves such as Encore.</p> <p>Since Mawile is primarily used as a Baton Passer, it should have teammates who appreciate the Attack boosts it can provide. Rhyperior, Blaziken, and Torterra can decimate teams with a Swords Dance boost, and all three have access to Agility or Rock Polish to patch up their sub-par Speed stats. Scyther is naturally faster than most of UU and can sweep with a Swords Dance-boosted Bug Bite, Aerial Ace, Brick Break, and Quick Attack. All of these Pokemon share weaknesses with Mawile, however, which makes passing to them somewhat risky. Altaria and Charizard resist all three of Mawile's weaknesses, making them excellent partners. Both can also boost their stats further with Dragon Dance to become nearly unstoppable.</p> <p>Dual screen support helps any Baton Passer succeed, especially one as slow and frail as Mawile. The screens will also protect your sweeper as it comes in and accumulates its own additional boosts. Uxie's great bulk makes it a great dual screen user. While Mawile itself doesn't mind Stealth Rock too much, many of its ideal Baton Pass recipients are crippled by it, so it's a good idea to carry a Rapid Spinner on your team. Claydol can both set up screens and spin away entry hazards, making it an excellent partner.</p>"

  "Plusle": {
    "overview": "<p>Plusle comes as the third generation's cute Electric-type mouse alongside Minun. While no one can deny his captivating charm, his stats are unfortunately mediocre, and his movepool is nothing to write home about. Because of this, Plusle is often forgotten in favor of other fast, specially-offensive Electric-type Pokemon such as Raichu and Manectric. Still, Plusle's unique combination of Nasty Plot, Encore, and Baton Pass gives a good reason to use him over his competitors. Plusle might not seem threatening at first glance, but underestimate him at your own peril, as it could result in a Pokemon sweeping through your team with the boosts Plusle has accumulated and Baton Passed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Plusle's movepool isn't particularly expansive, but he does have a couple of interesting options. Plusle has access to Wish and status moves in Sing and Thunder Wave. Since Plusle also has access to moves such as Baton Pass and Encore, he can pull off a support set; however, Plusle's extremely poor defenses make this a mediocre option. Fake Tears can be used, but for the most part Plusle prefers Nasty Plot since it's Baton Passable. Signal Beam is a special attack that Plusle can use, but it has poor coverage alongside Thunderbolt. Plusle could also attempt a gimmicky anti-lead set with Focus Sash, Counter, Encore, Thunderbolt, and Quick Attack; Counter can KO physical leads, Encore can lock a lead into Stealth Rock, and Quick Attack can finish Focus Sash leads off, but it's really just that-- a gimmick.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The main problem with countering Plusle is Baton Pass. Baton Pass makes it so that it isn't just about dealing with Plusle-- it means you have to prevent Plusle from passing his boosts to something more deadly, or have the ability to deal with the recipient. Because of this, the best counters to Plusle are bulky phazers. Venusaur with Roar can easily take anything Plusle throws at it, and can use Roar to phaze Plusle. Lanturn, Registeel, and Chansey are also good counters as they all take little damage from Plusle's attacks and can paralyze Baton Pass recipients with Thunder Wave. It should be noted that Plusle isn't all that powerful on his own, and most of the time, dedicated special sponges aren't really necessary to deal with him.</p> <p>Faster Pokemon can easily outspeed and KO Plusle. Dugtrio is particularly effective since he can trap Plusle with Arena Trap and OHKO him with Earthquake. If a faster sweeper isn't available on your team, then priority is also a great way to take down Plusle. Plusle isn't very bulky, so strong priority attacks should take him down, although some prior damage may be necessary. Arcanine's Extreme Speed is a great example of this, as it will easily KO any variant of Plusle after a little residual damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>This set utilizes Plusle's decent offensive power and access to Encore to make him an effective Nasty Plot Baton Passer that can pose an offensive threat at the same time. Encore allows Plusle to lock defensive Pokemon, such as Registeel, into a harmless move like Stealth Rock, effectively giving Plusle a free turn to set up. As Plusle is extremely frail, Encore is often very important to obtain a Nasty Plot boost. Thunderbolt gives Plusle a reliable attack, which prevents him from being completely useless if he gets Taunted, and is fairly powerful after a Nasty Plot.</p> <p>This EV spread is simple yet effective: A Timid nature and 252 Speed EVs are needed to tie with other positive base 95 Pokemon such as Houndoom. This gives Plusle a 50% chance to Baton Pass the boost in a tight situation against them, or KO the opposing Pokemon with a Nasty Plot boosted Thunderbolt. 252 Special Attack EVs boost the power of Plusle's Thunderbolt, and allow Plusle to strike the opposing team with strong attacks. While it may seem odd to boost Plusle's Special Attack when Thunderbolt is his only offensive move, the Electric-type boasts respectable mono-coverage in UU, and any opponents that resist Thunderbolt can easily be Baton Passed out of. However, some defensive EVs can be transferred from Special Attack to make it easier for Plusle to obtain a Nasty Plot boost, but so many EVs are required that Plusle becomes pitifully weak, which makes this a lesser option.</p> <p>Plusle has a couple of other moves that he can use on this set. Agility is always useful to Baton Pass, but Nasty Plot is what makes Plusle unique. You may, however, forgo the use of Thunderbolt in favor of Agility if you wish. Magnet Rise can be an interesting option to Baton Pass, but like Agility, it should only go over Thunderbolt. It should be noted that replacing Thunderbolt with either Agility or Magnet Rise leaves Plusle rendered utterly useless by Taunt, so it isn't recommended. Hidden Power Ice allows Plusle to hit Ground-types he can't hit with Thunderbolt, but there are no moves that you can really replace on this set.</p> <p>As this set's main goal is to pass Nasty Plot boosts, appropriate recipients are naturally important teammates. If possible, these Baton Pass recipients should also be able to deal with Ground-type Pokemon. Therefore, Moltres, Mismagius, Rotom, and Sceptile are all excellent partners, as they benefit greatly from a Nasty Plot boost, and are immune or resistant to Ground-type attacks. All of these Pokemon pack incredible powerful after a Nasty Plot boost, and are fast enough to attempt a sweep.</p> <p>Because both Plusle and his Baton Pass recipients are specially-based, dedicated special sponges such as Chansey can pose problems. Even after a Nasty Plot boost, Baton Pass recipients may still face problems with the pink blob. Dugtrio is a great choice to trap and KO Chansey in one fell swoop. U-turn users, such as Scyther and Swellow, also help weaken the opposing team and scout for any Pokemon that may pose a problem to your Baton Pass recipient.</p>"

Qwilfish is also a decent option as he can quickly set up a layer or two of Spikes before fainting. Scyther and Swellow can both slowly weaken opposing walls with U-turn, which will gradually allow Plusle to overcome these walls.

  "Minun": {
    "overview": "<p>Minun comes as the third generation's cute Electric-type mouse alongside Plusle. While no one can deny his captivating charm, his stats are unfortunately mediocre, and his movepool is nothing to write home about. Because of this, Minun is often forgotten in favor of other fast, specially-offensive Electric-types such as Raichu and Manectric. Still, Minun's access to the combination of Nasty Plot, Encore, and Baton Pass gives a good reason to use him over his competitors. Minun might not seem too threatening at first glance, but underestimate him at your own peril, as it could result in a Pokemon sweeping through your team with the boosts Minun has passed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Minun's movepool isn't particularly expansive, but he does have a couple of interesting options. Minun has access to Wish and status moves in Sing and Thunder Wave. Since Minun also has access to moves such as Baton Pass and Encore, he can pull off a support set; however, Minun's poor defenses make this a mediocre option. Fake Tears can be used, but for the most part Minun prefers Nasty Plot, since it's Baton Passable. Signal Beam is a special attack that Minun can use, but it has poor coverage alongside Thunderbolt. Minun could also attempt a gimmicky anti-lead set of Counter, Encore, Thunderbolt, and Quick Attack while holding a Focus Sash; Counter can KO physical leads, Encore can lock a lead into Stealth Rock, and Quick Attack can finish Focus Sash leads off, but it's really just that—a gimmick.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The main problem with countering Minun is Baton Pass. Baton Pass makes it so that it isn't just about dealing with Minun—it means you have to prevent Minun from passing his boosts to something more deadly, or have the ability to deal with the recipient. Because of this, the best counters to Minun are bulky phazers. Venusaur with Roar can easily take anything Minun throws at it, and can use Roar to phaze Minun. Lanturn, Registeel, and Chansey are also good counters as they all take little damage from Minun's attacks and can paralyze Baton Pass recipients with Thunder Wave. It should be noted that Minun is quite weak on his own, and most of the time, dedicated special sponges aren't really necessary to deal with him.</p> <p>Faster Pokemon can easily outspeed and KO Minun. Dugtrio is particularly effective since he can trap Minun with Arena Trap and OHKO him with Earthquake. If a faster sweeper isn't available on your team, then priority is also a great way to take down Minun. Minun isn't very bulky, so strong priority attacks should take him down, although some prior damage may need to be done ahead of time. Arcanine's Extreme Speed is a great example of this, as it will easily KO any variant of Minun after a little residual damage.</p>",

      "Defensive Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>This set utilizes Minun's access to Encore and decent special bulk to make him an effective Nasty Plot Baton Passer. Encore allows Minun to lock Pokemon such as Registeel into a harmless move like Stealth Rock, effectively giving Minun a free turn afterward to set up. Since Minun can't set up on moderately powerful attackers even with a defensive EV spread, Encore is often extremely important to obtain a Nasty Plot boost. Thunderbolt gives Minun a reliable attack, which prevents him from being completely useless if he gets Taunted, and does decent damage after a Nasty Plot, even without Special Attack investment.</p> <p>This EV spread is simple, but effective. A Timid nature and 252 Speed EVs are needed to tie with other max Speed base 95 Pokemon such as Houndoom. This can be important, as this gives Minun a 50% chance to Baton Pass the boost in a tight situation against them. 252 HP EVs boost Minun's overall bulk, and allow Minun to switch into a decent amount of weak special attacks. For example, this Minun will never be 2HKOed by 0 Special Attack Milotic's Surf, even after Stealth Rock. A more offensive spread can be used if you wish, but due to Minun's relatively poor defenses, he'll have an even harder time setting up than he does with the above EV spread.</p> <p>Minun has a couple of other moves that he can use on this set. Agility is always useful to Baton Pass, but Nasty Plot is what makes Minun unique. It can, however, go over Thunderbolt if you wish.

  "Kecleon": {
    "overview": "<p>Kecleon is one of several Pokemon introduced in the third generation with a gimmicky ability that heavily influences their competitive value. Color Change takes what would have been just another underpowered Normal-type with a nice movepool and turns it into something unique; combined with its excellent Special Defense, Kecleon makes a great counter to Choiced special attackers or those with limited coverage. The cost is quite high, however, as opposing Pokemon with good coverage can easily take advantage of Color Change. Furthermore, its frequent type-changing prevents Kecleon from having a consistent STAB attack to rely on. Constant prediction is required in order to get the most out of Kecleon, but when used well, it can be a valuable asset indeed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Kecleon has a huge movepool with several other usable options. It can run a decent SubPunch set with Focus Punch and Sucker Punch, but Kangaskhan and many others are superior choices in this regard. Rock Slide, Shadow Claw, Shadow Sneak, and the elemental punches are alternate attacking options that can go on the Choice Band set to cover specific threats. Body Slam and Seismic Toss would seem to be attractive options on the support set; unfortunately, both are illegal with Recover. Body Slam could go on the Choice Band set if you are willing to sacrifice some power for the paralysis rate. Counter can be used to surprise physical attackers, but it too is illegal with Recover, making such a set very situational. Kecleon can learn Nasty Plot, and it has a great special movepool that includes Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, Grass Knot, and Fire Blast, but its low Speed makes pulling off a successful sweep nearly impossible. Trick Room and Nasty Plot could be used together, but Kecleon's Special Attack is mediocre even after the boost, so you'd be better off switching to a more powerful sweeper instead. Toxic and Knock Off are alternate supporting moves if you don't need Kecleon to set up Stealth Rock. Snatch is a very cool move that can steal a Substitute or stat boosts from your opponent, but it requires god-like prediction to use successfully. Protect can scout incoming attacks to see how the opponent plans on taking advantage of Color Change. Skill Swap can be used to rid Kecleon of its ability, but it will usually be a waste unless you manage to use it on Medicham or Azumarill.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Any physically bulky Pokemon that doesn't mind paralysis can set up on the support set with ease. Hariyama shrugs off even Choice Band Kecleon's attacks, doesn't mind being paralyzed, and can force Kecleon out with its STAB Fighting-type moves. Hitmontop won't like paralysis, but it can take any of Kecleon's other attacks and use Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock Kecleon may try to set up. Weezing and Spiritomb take little from Kecleon's attacks, and both can burn it with Will-O-Wisp. Slowbro has great physical bulk and can set up Calm Mind in Kecleon's face. Donphan completely shuts down Kecleon's support options and doesn't mind being Tricked a Choice Band, but it must beware of switching into Choice Band-boosted Aqua Tail. Some Pokemon can take advantage of Color Change to easily defeat Kecleon. Altaria's Dragon Claw will always do super effective damage after the first hit. Shadow Ball from Mismagius or Rotom will do the same, although they will have to hit Kecleon with some other attack first to remove Kecleon's Ghost immunity. Kecleon is not very threatening on its own, so switching in should not be particularly difficult as long as you avoid Trick and Thunder Wave.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Kecleon is surprisingly bulky on the special side, with defensive stats slightly superior to Clefable's. Color Change gives Kecleon a unique advantage over other special walls, as it often causes special attackers to hit it with resisted attacks. Every common special attacking type in UU resists itself, except Ghost, which Kecleon is naturally immune to, meaning it can come in on nearly any Choice-locked special attacker without being 2HKOed. Even Pokemon that don't use Choice items often lack wide enough coverage to land consecutive neutral hits on Kecleon. Life Orb Venusaur, for example, cannot even 3HKO Kecleon with any attack if it switches in on Sludge Bomb.</p> <p>This set focuses on forcing out special attackers and supporting the team. Stealth Rock is an excellent addition to any type of team, limiting the opponent's ability to switch and giving your sweepers the ability to secure additional OHKOs and 2HKOs. If another Pokemon on your team has entry hazards covered, Thunder Wave is a great alternative option. Paralysis will cripple any special attacker foolish enough to stay in, and directly helps Kecleon by allowing it to outspeed many Pokemon it otherwise could not. Although Kecleon can't rely on a consistent STAB boost for Return, it is still a good move that combines with Aqua Tail to hit everything in UU, except Shedinja, for at least neutral damage. Recover gives Kecleon reliable recovery so it can continue walling special attackers throughout the match.</p> <p>With a Careful nature and 252 SpD EVs, Kecleon can switch in on almost any Choiced special attack not named Focus Blast with impunity. Modest Choice Specs Alakazam's Psychic and Timid Choice Specs Moltres's Fire Blast, two of the most powerful special attacks in UU, both fail to 2HKO because of Color Change, which allows Kecleon to resist the second hit. Even special attackers that don't use Choice items can have trouble breaking through; Life Orb Milotic cannot 2HKO Kecleon even by rotating between Hydro Pump, Hidden Power Grass, and Ice Beam, although Kecleon won't be able to do much in return.</p> <p>While Kecleon rarely has trouble taking hits from special attackers, it is quite vulnerable on the physical side. Fighting-types are Kecleon's worst nightmare, as most of them can OHKO with STAB Close Combat. Hariyama and Hitmontop in particular can both switch in on any of Kecleon's moves and force it out. Hariyama can absorb even Thunder Wave for a Guts boost. Donphan can spin away Stealth Rock, is immune to Thunder Wave, and takes pitiful damage from Aqua Tail while striking back with powerful physical attacks. In order to get rid of these threats, a sturdy Psychic-type partner, such as Uxie, is recommended. In addition, bulky setup sweepers like Curse Registeel and Calm Mind Slowbro can come in and set up on Kecleon with impunity. While they may not be immediately threatening, there is little Kecleon can do to stop them from setting up, so it's important to have a teammate that can prevent these Pokemon from sweeping. Milotic with Haze and Alakazam with Encore are both very capable of disrupting any Pokemon that attempts to boost its stats.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Kecleon's usable Attack stat and excellent special bulk, a Choice Band set is viable. Return and Aqua Tail have good Base Power and perfect neutral coverage, meaning nothing can switch into this set for free. Low Kick provides extra power against some of UU's sturdiest Pokemon, 2HKOing both Registeel and Steelix. Trick is a great move for crippling Pokemon that Kecleon would otherwise have trouble with. Mismagius might try to sneak in on a predicted Return or Low Kick to set up a sweep, while Slowbro takes little damage from any of Kecleon's attacks; however, both will hate being stuck with a Choice Band for the rest of the match.</p> <p>The given Speed EVs allow Kecleon to outspeed minimum Speed base 60s. Attack is maximized to hit as hard as possible, and the remaining EVs are put into HP to make it easier for Kecleon to switch in. If you aren't concerned about Clefable and Weezing, a spread of 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe will increase Kecleon's bulk while still allowing it to beat minimum base 50s such as Chansey, Donphan, Aggron, and Registeel. Either way, a couple of extra points in Speed can be used as insurance against Speed creep.</p> <p>This set is generally much harder to switch into, but it still has some solid counters. Defensive Hariyama is not 2HKOed by any of Kecleon's moves and doesn't particularly mind being Tricked a Choice Band. Weezing won't enjoy Trick, but it can take any of Kecleon's other attacks and cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Slowbro is an excellent partner, as it reliably counters these Pokemon and can help Kecleon overcome its low Speed by providing paralysis support. Offensively, Swellow is a good teammate since it can sweep much more easily if the opponent's physical walls are weakened or Choice-locked; it also has no trouble taking out the Fighting-types that threaten Kecleon.</p>"
      },
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Kecleon's low Speed, excellent special bulk, and access to a reliable recovery move make it a natural choice to set up Trick Room, which turns slow, forgotten Pokemon into dangerous sweepers that can tear through unprepared teams. Stealth Rock helps such sweepers get their KOs more quickly, preventing valuable Trick Room turns from being wasted. Return does respectable damage if Kecleon is forced to attack, while Recover helps keep it healthy so it can continue setting up Trick Room throughout the battle.</p> <p>The EVs maximize Kecleon's special bulk while making it as slow as possible, since Trick Room will be inverting Speed. Once Trick Room is up, the only Pokemon that will be \"faster\" than Kecleon are other Pokemon designed for Trick Room (and Gyro Ball Steelix). For this set to be useful, your team should load up on slow, powerful attackers with good bulk and wide coverage. Rhyperior is perhaps the most fearsome Trick Room sweeper, as it has great physical bulk and reaches 832 Attack after a Swords Dance, allowing it to OHKO nearly everything with the fantastic STAB combination of Earthquake and Stone Edge. Strong users of priority, particularly Azumarill, are other excellent teammates to consider when using a Trick Room team. You will also want other Pokemon that can set up Trick Room in case Kecleon is incapacitated. Spiritomb is immune to the Fighting-type attacks that threaten Kecleon and possesses excellent overall bulk, allowing it to set up Trick Room multiple times. Slowking is another cool option, able to both set up Trick Room and sweep inside it with Nasty Plot.</p>"

Possessing good defensive stats, pure Ghost typing, and a number of supporting moves, Dusclops has carved itself a niche in UU as a bulky spinblocker. Its ability, Pressure, also deters a sweeper's offensive advances, sometimes even forcing them to switch out in order to preserve their precious PP. While Spiritomb appears to outclass Dusclops due to its additional Dark typing and higher base offensive stats, Dusclops possesses greater bulk, as well as access to Trick Room, giving it yet another way to reliably support its teammates. With these numerous advantages, Dusclops can prove to be a valuable member to any standard UU team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dusclops has a couple of other options that it can run. A Gravity set is viable, and Dusclops also has access to Dynamic Punch and Earthquake, although they run off of its less-than-impressive base 70 Attack stat. Calm Mind lets Dusclops become more of a special wall, but it is not as effective as the Bulky Spinblocker set at walling. Dusclops can run a more offensive Trick Room set; however, its offensive stats really let it down. As for moves, Spite can quickly wear down the PP of an opponent's move, shaving off 6 PP (factoring in Pressure) each time Dusclops is attacked. Substitute can be used in conjunction with Pain Split, and Focus Punch can be used to discourage opposing Pokemon from switching in freely. Shadow Sneak allows Dusclops to finish off weakened opponents, and Taunt prevents opponents from setting up, although Dusclops's low Speed stat makes it very hard to use it effectively. Memento can set up a partner for a sweep, and Destiny Bond can take down an opponent if you predict correctly and use it on the turn before Dusclops is KOed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Despite Dusclops's bulk, it does have a number of counters. Taunters shut Dusclops down since it mostly uses non-attacking moves. The UU Ghosts threaten Dusclops on the special side with STAB Shadow Ball (or in Spiritomb's case, STAB Dark Pulse). Mismagius deserves a special mention among the Ghost-types because it also possesses Taunt, allowing it to completely shut down Dusclops and set up on the switch. Clefable doesn't mind being burned, and can cause problems with Wish and Trick. Houndoom gets a boost from Will-O-Wisp, while threatening with STAB Pursuit or Dark Pulse.</p>",

        "description": "<p>While all Ghost-types can block Rapid Spin, they are generally frail and easily KOed. Dusclops, however, has the defensive stats to function as a reliable bulky spinblocker on many teams. Seismic Toss gives Dusclops a means of offense so as not to be completely ruined by Taunt. Will-O-Wisp cripples opposing physical attackers, while the combination of Rest and Sleep Talk cures Dusclops of status and is its best means of recovery.</p> <p>Shadow Punch can be used over Sleep Talk to take down Rotom and Mismagius, while Toxic can wear down bulky Fire- and Water-type switch-ins. Although Dusclops becomes somewhat vulnerable while it is sleeping without Sleep Talk, its defenses allow it to survive the two turns of Rest without much fear. Pain Split can be used over Rest to take advantage of Dusclops's naturally low HP stat; however, status can become an issue should you choose to forgo Rest.</p> <p>Due to the physically-based UU metagame, Dusclops will usually switch into more physical attacks than special ones; therefore, physical defense is maximized, with the leftover EVs going into Special Defense. An Impish nature further increases Dusclops's physical bulk, making it even harder to defeat.</p> <p>Dusclops appreciates teammates that can take advantage of burn support. Aggron makes an excellent partner, resisting both of Dusclops's weaknesses, crushing a team weakened by Will-O-Wisp and Seismic Toss, and luring in Fighting-type moves for Dusclops to switch into. Miltank sets up Stealth Rock, cures status with Heal Bell, and possesses an immunity to Ghost-type moves, while also luring in Fighting-type attacks. Dusclops is a magnet for the other UU Ghosts, which can switch in on Seismic Toss and force it out with the threat of STAB moves. Mismagius is especially dangerous because it can carry Taunt, which effectively shuts Dusclops down. Other Taunters, such as Ambipom, Nidoking, and Drapion, outspeed Dusclops easily, though they must be wary of switching into a Will-O-Wisp. Houndoom gains a boost in power from Will-O-Wisp, and threatens with STAB Pursuit or Dark Pulse. Clefable is also immune to Will-O-Wisp, and can carry Trick to ruin Dusclops's fun.</p>"

Will-O-Wisp ensures that any opposing physical sweeper hoping to take advantage of Trick Room is crippled. Pain Split allows Dusclops to steal HP from its opponent, weakening many Pokemon to the point where Trick Room sweepers on your team can come in and easily mow down the opposition.

Steelix is a good switch-in to Regirock, as it takes next to nothing from its Rock-type attacks and very little damage from Earthquake.

Grass-types such as Venusaur can switch into almost any attack except Thunder Wave and threaten Regirock with powerful STAB attacks. Blaziken can also KO Regirock with Superpower if Regirock switches into a Fire Blast or a super effective Hidden Power; however, Regirock can survive a Superpower if it has taken very little prior damage.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This set focuses on Regirock's ability to check numerous threats in the UU metagame, while also being able to pose a threat offensively. Regirock's excellent Defense aids it in countering and checking many physical sweepers. Additionally, Regirock can use its impressive bulk to aid its team through its support moves. Stone Edge and Earthquake create the famous EdgeQuake combination, which provides great type coverage, backed by Regirock's respectable Attack stat. Stealth Rock is secured a spot in the third slot because it allows Regirock to provide some team support while also taking advantage of Regirock's ability to set it up reliably. Explosion differentiates Regirock from Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Aggron. A well-timed Explosion can turn the tide of a match by eliminating a problem Pokemon your team may have trouble facing.</p> <p>Stone Edge is best used with Earthquake, as 8 PP is too little to rely on for a wall such as Regirock. Earthquake also gives Regirock a way to hit Steelix and Registeel, as well as Fighting-types. However, paralysis support is always useful, and if Thunder Wave is chosen over Earthquake, then Rock Slide becomes the superior option over Stone Edge. With Rock Slide, Regirock will not have PP issues, and also gains access to a nice flinch chance. An alternative to Thunder Wave is Toxic, which can severely cripple Pokemon such as Milotic and Donphan as they switch in. If you already have a reliable Stealth Rock user, such as Mesprit or Uxie, Toxic can go in the third slot to complement either Earthquake or Thunder Wave. Rest can be used over Explosion to ensure Regirock sticks around a bit longer; however, it would be wise to pair Regirock with a cleric such as Chansey or Clefable so it's not a sitting duck.</p> <p>With the given EV spread, Regirock can comfortably defeat powerful threats such as Mismagius and Houndoom, never being OHKOed by a +2 Hidden Power Fighting or Dark Pulse, respectively. If a more hard-hitting Regirock is desired, an alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD Adamant may be used, but Regirock now has a decent chance of being OHKOed by Timid Life Orb Alakazam's Focus Blast and Nasty Plot Houndoom's +2 Dark Pulse. Finally, another alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD with a Careful nature can be used to fully maximize Regirock's special tanking abilities, made better if used in a sandstorm.</p> <p>Regirock can also check Pokemon such as Blaziken and Moltres. Blaziken only causes trouble if Regirock is weakened, or if Blaziken runs rare moves such as Focus Blast or Swords Dance. With its amazing defenses, Regirock can switch into Moltres, OHKOing it with its STAB Rock-type move of choice. Regirock really enjoys having a Grass-type to sponge Water-, Grass-, and Ground-type attacks thrown at it. Pokemon such as Venusaur provide nice support for Regirock by bringing down bulky Water-types. Altaria is another Pokemon who can be of use, as it is resistant to Fighting- and Water-type attacks and immune to Ground-type attacks. Both of these Pokemon have instant recovery moves, so Regirock can form a solid defensive core with them. Mismagius can take advantage of Regirock's ability to lure Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, as it can switch into them with impunity. Weezing also makes a great partner as it resists Regirock's Grass- and Fighting-type weaknesses, and is immune to Ground-type attacks. Wish support is greatly appreciated because of Regirock's lack of a reliable recovery move. Chansey makes a good Wish passer to pair with Regirock, as it lures out physical attackers for Regirock to switch into. Leafeon makes a decent alternative Wish passer, possessing great defensive synergy with Regirock.</p> <p>With Explosion, Regirock can punch some major holes in the opponent's team, allowing another Pokemon to sweep. Bulky Water-types like to switch into Regirock and attempt to force it out with STAB Surf. However, Regirock can absorb the Surf and Explode, eliminating said bulky Water-type. Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Feraligatr and Azumarill benefit greatly from these Pokemon being removed from the battle, and thus make good partners for Regirock.</p>"

      "Mono-Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set abuses Regirock's bulk to set up for a late-game sweep. With its excellent defenses, aided by RestTalk recovery, Regirock will have no trouble setting up Curse. After a couple of Curses, the opponent will likely not be able to KO Regirock with any Pokemon who can survive a boosted Rock Slide. This set reaches its full potential in a sandstorm, especially as the last Pokemon standing so that it can't be forced out. With incredible Defense as well as decent Attack and Special Defense, Regirock can set up six Curses quite easily and sweep your opponent's team. Rock Slide is chosen as the single attack due to its high PP, whereas Stone Edge might be more powerful but runs out too quickly.</p> <p>Since Regirock already boasts an insane Defense stat, Regirock's EVs should be put into Special Defense and HP (its Special Defense also receives a boost from sandstorm). Leftovers is the preferred item, but Chesto Berry allows Regirock to instantly wake up upon using Rest, allowing it to sweep and prevent itself from becoming setup fodder.</p> <p>This variant of Regirock needs a Pokemon who can set up permanent sandstorm. Without sandstorm in play, Regirock struggles to take powerful special hits. Unfortunately, Hippopotas is the only option in UU. This Regirock has trouble against Steelix and Donphan, who have great Defense, STAB Earthquake, and Roar to force Regirock out. Pokemon such as Nidoking, Magmortar, and Blaziken can OHKO Steelix, Donphan, and other walls who may be in Regirock's way; however, Magmortar and Blaziken lack sandstorm immunity, so Nidoking is preferred. Unfortunately, all three share an Earthquake weakness with Regirock. Haze Milotic is a big nuisance to Regirock, as it prevents it from setting up. Venusaur makes a fantastic partner, as it can easily switch in on Milotic and threaten it with STAB Grass-type attacks. Regirock should be wary of setting up until Encore and Trick users have been eliminated. Common users of these moves include Alakazam, Clefable, and Uxie. Drapion with Pursuit can be a great partner due to its ability to eliminate common Psychic-type Trick users, and can set up Toxic Spikes to aid Regirock's sweep. Drapion may also utilize Taunt and wear down Clefable as well.</p>"

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Physical attacking Regirock aims to hit its usual counters hard with boosted attacks. Stone Edge nails any Pokemon who doesn't resist it, and deals respectable damage even when resisted. Earthquake and Ice Punch hit Steel-types and Ground-types, respectively. When Regirock has run its course, Explosion makes sure it takes out another Pokemon before it bites the dust.</p> <p>Stone Edge is Regirock's main STAB attack, and will dent almost everything that does not resist it. Earthquake is a nice coverage move which hits Steelix for super effective damage and also takes care of Registeel quite easily. Ice Punch is there to KO Pokemon such as Torterra and Claydol, who completely wall Stone Edge and Earthquake. A boosted Explosion is extremely powerful, easily KOing any wall without a resistance or immunity to it.</p> <p>Regirock takes advantage of Pokemon such as Houndoom and Arcanine who give Regirock a free opportunity to switch in. Venusaur is probably the best partner for this Regirock set, as it lures these Fire-types, and is also able to take hits from the bulky Water-type Pokemon who give this set trouble. With Houndoom and Arcanine out of the way, Grass-types and Pokemon susceptible to priority, such as Alakazam or Absol, have a much easier time sweeping.</p>"
      },
      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<p>As a Rock Polish user, Regirock can work in two different ways. On the one hand, Regirock can play exactly the same as Rock Polish Rhyperior and Torterra as an offensive late-game sweeper. On the other hand, Regirock can also lure in its main counters, Milotic and other bulky Water-types, and blow them away with Explosion, opening the door for another sweeper to come in and finish the job. For the other two slots, Stone Edge and Earthquake come together to form the famous EdgeQuake combo, giving Regirock almost perfect neutral coverage in UU outside of Torterra and Claydol.</p> <p>If using Regirock as a sweeper, an Adamant nature and Life Orb are recommended in order to give Regirock as much power as possible. If using Regirock as a lure, a Jolly nature and Passho Berry are recommended instead to guarantee that Regirock outpaces Milotic, survives Surf or Hydro Pump if need be, and eliminates it with Explosion. Regirock literally doesn't have anything else worth using in the last slot besides Explosion. Superpower or Brick Break could be used to gain super effective coverage on Normal-types, but most times Stone Edge and Earthquake will be sufficient, and Regirock really doesn't like the power drop from Superpower.</p> <p>If you're not planning on Exploding Regirock at the first sign of a bulky Water-type, teammates who can eliminate them in a cleaner manner are recommended. Venusaur is a great teammate to switch into Water-types and blast them with a super effective Leaf Storm; Venusaur is also a good answer to both Claydol and Torterra, who resist both Stone Edge and Earthquake. Stealth Rock and Spikes support are also appreciated to pick up Regirock a couple of secured KOs against bulkier threats. With both forms of support, Life Orb Regirock can easily 2HKO Milotic with Stone Edge. Cloyster and Qwilfish can both provide Spikes support while Uxie and Miltank are both good options for Stealth Rock. Finally, if you decide to blast Milotic with Explosion, then a teammate who can capitalize on its absence is crucial. Dragon Dance Feraligatr and Choice Band Azumarill can both wreck teams without a bulky Water-type, as can Blaziken and Arcanine.</p>"
      },
      "Sunny Day Support": {
        "description": "<p>Sunny Day Regirock is a surprisingly sound strategy; it reduces the damage Regirock takes from Water-type attacks, allowing it to actually beat several of its typical switch-ins, open up a sweep for a Fire-type, such as Typhlosion, or a Chlorophyll user, such as Victreebel, as well as boost the offensive prowess of its teammates in general. In addition to this, Regirock makes a great Stealth Rock supporter, which further facilitates the sweep of said teammates. Regirock is also a fine switch-in to the Fire- and Flying-types that usually trouble a team that revolves around the harsh sunlight, and can quickly dispatch them with its STAB Rock-type attacks. Ghost-types intending to switch into Explosion are also made wary because of its powerful STAB moves.</p> <p>A Heat Rock is the item of choice, prolonging the effects of Sunny Day, and giving Regirock's teammates the best chances of success. The EV spread is simple; HP is maximized for bulk, Attack EVs ensure that Milotic is always OHKOed by Explosion, and the rest are sent into Special Defense for some added leeway against special attackers such as Houndoom. A dedicated specially defensive spread can be used so that Regirock has the bulk to repeatedly set up Sunny Day throughout the match. If such a spread is used, it is recommended that you replace Explosion with Earthquake, as it would be a bit wasteful to just blow up that much beef... err rock.</p> <p>Fire-types, Chlorophyll users, and basically any Pokemon that can benefit from Sunny Day make great teammates to Regirock. Tangrowth deserves special mention for its ability to switch into Donphan, opposing Regirock, and Rhyperior with ease. Typhlosion and Arcanine are amazing partners as well, as both of them benefit from the removal of Water-types such as Milotic and Azumarill, making a potent Choice set much more viable.</p>"

  "Regice": {
    "overview": "<p>Regice looks like the ideal choice for a special wall; its massive base 200 Special Defense, usable HP, and access to support moves such as Thunder Wave and Gravity all look appealing. However, when you look closer you'll notice that it has weaknesses to common attacking types such as Fire-, Rock-, Steel-, and Fighting-type attacks, a crippling weakness to Stealth Rock, and a total lack of reliable recovery. With the correct support, Regice becomes an unequivocal special wall that can counter the likes of Rotom, Milotic, and Sceptile with ease, but just make sure to keep Regice away from super effective attacks and Stealth Rock.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Besides the moves listed, Regice can use any one of the following to some degree of success. Regice may use Blizzard if Snover is present, as it will become 100% accurate thanks to the consistent hail brought by Snow Warning. Amnesia may be used to raise Regice's already monster Special Defense, while Curse may be used on a physical set with Avalanche to raise its Attack and Defense. Block can be used alongside a stat boosting move or Toxic to trap the opponent. Focus Punch can be used with Substitute, while Hammer Arm can be used to hit Rock-, Steel-, and Dark-types super effectively. Icy Wind can be used to lower the opponent's Speed. Rain Dance is nifty with Thunder and Explosion, and Regice's solid defenses make it pretty easy to set up. Psych Up allows Regice to copy stat boosts from the opponent, which is especially helpful against Calm Mind users such as Slowbro and some Spiritomb. Gravity may also be useful with Earthquake-using teammates and low accuracy moves such as Thunder and Blizzard.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Slow Fighting-types such as Hariyama or Hitmontop are the best counters to Regice as Thunder Wave isn't too big an issue and they can smash Regice with their STAB attacks. Chansey and Clefable can take on any of Regice's sets with their excellent special bulk, but must watch out for Explosion. Lanturn resists the BoltBeam combination and is immune to Electric-type attacks such as Thunder Wave, while it can poison Regice with Toxic and stall it until it faints. Steelix is immune to Thunderbolt and Ice Beam only hits it neutrally, while Gyro Ball hits Regice super effectively. Stealth Rock is a big problem for Regice as it loses a quarter of its health each time it switches in, while Toxic and Toxic Spikes will make Regice's stalling attempts futile. Anything that can survive an Ice Beam or Thunderbolt from Regice and can hit it super effectively can probably be called a counter as well.</p>",

      "Tank": {
        "description": "<p>This set turns Regice into a good special sponge capable of taking on a variety of special attackers, crippling them with status and wearing them down with Regice's decent offenses. Thunder Wave slows down incoming physical attackers, while Toxic helps wear down bulky opponents, especially Water-types such as Milotic and Slowbro. Ice Beam is used for STAB and comes off of Regice's useful base 100 Special Attack. Thunderbolt and Charge Beam provide excellent type coverage alongside Ice Beam, and Seismic Toss provides consistent damage.</p> <p>A Calm nature along with 252 Defense EVs make Regice extremely bulky, taking both physical and special attacks with relative ease. If you desire a more specially defensive spread, you may shift the Defense EVs into Special Defense, though you could also run a Bold nature for a more physically defensive set. Rest can be used in the last slot as it rids Regice of harmful status and fully restores its health; however, when Regice is using Rest, a cleric such as Clefable is recommended as Regice becomes setup fodder for numerous Pokemon. Explosion may seem unorthodox on a defensive set, but it deserves a mention because it allows Regice to blow up Fighting- and Fire-types such as Blaziken and Hariyama.</p> <p>As this set lacks reliable recovery, Regice appreciates Wish support. There are a variety of Pokemon that can provide this, namely Clefable, Leafeon, and Chansey, all of which have good defensive stats and access to useful support options of their own. Due to Regice's mediocre typing, you'll need Pokemon that can switch into Fire-, Rock-, Steel-, and Fighting-type attacks. Claydol resists Rock- and Fighting-type attacks, Altaria resists Fire- and Fighting-type attacks, and Moltres resists Fire-, Fighting-, and Steel-type attacks. There are many more teammates to consider, though, as these are just a few examples. Regice is also weak to Stealth Rock, and the only way to remove it is by using a good Rapid Spin user. Claydol and Donphan both resist Rock-type attacks and have access to Stealth Rock themselves, while Blastoise can switch into Fire- and Steel-type attacks with ease.</p> <p>Pokemon that can take advantage of Regice's stalling ability are good partners, particularly those with low Special Defense. As for offensive partners, Aggron can take advantage of Regice's high Special Defense and ability to switch into Water- and Ground-type attacks, while it can set up Rock Polish to pummel the opponent and appreciates the paralysis support Regice can provide against faster sweepers. Blaziken appreciates Regice as a switch-in to Water- and Psychic-types such as Slowbro, Milotic, and Alakazam, and Venusaur appreciates Alakazam taken care of as well. As for defensive partners, Weezing is an excellent choice because it only has one weakness, and Regice can switch into most common Psychic-type attacks with ease. Donphan is another good partner because Regice can take on the Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type attacks aimed at it, while Donphan can remove Stealth Rock and switch into Rock-type attacks.</p>"

        "description": "<p>This set attempts to patch up Regice's lack of recovery with the RestTalk combination, turning it into an excellent staller and status absorber; these attributes, along with STAB Ice Beam, make Regice one of the best Venusaur counters around. RestTalk helps recover damage accumulated from entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock. Ice Beam is used for STAB, and Seismic Toss provides reliable damage, while Thunderbolt or Charge Beam can be used to provide good type coverage with the vaunted BoltBeam combination. Toxic or Thunder Wave can also be used in the last slot, providing status and supporting Regice's teammates.</p> <p>As this set is supposed to stick around for as long as possible, Toxic Spikes are a good option; they poison the opponent's Pokemon, allowing Regice to wear down and stall out bulky Water-types like Milotic as the damage increases to horrifying levels. Pokemon such as Cloyster, Drapion, and Nidoqueen are ideal options to set them up thanks to their good defensive stats and other support options.</p> <p>Being an Ice-type, Regice comes with a large number of common weaknesses, most notably to Fire-, Fighting-, and Rock-type attacks, so a partner that can switch into these types of attacks is ideal. Rhyperior can switch into most Fire- and Rock-type attacks and set up with Rock Polish, while Slowbro can switch into Fire- and Fighting-type attacks and proceed to do the same with Calm Mind or Trick Room. Other good partners include Milotic, Kabutops, and Moltres.</p> <p>Due to its weakness to Stealth Rock, Regice requires Rapid Spin support to be effective; Donphan and Hitmontop are reliable choices as they can switch into Rock-type attacks and pose a decent offensive threat with their STAB attacks. Snover is almost mandatory for this set as it wears down the opponent without damaging Regice; while Blizzard sounds appealing in the hail, the low PP isn't a good idea on a Pokemon that is supposed to be stalling. Finally, this set is stopped cold when Chansey and Registeel appear on the field, especially when Regice lacks Charge Beam to boost its Special Attack. Dugtrio is the best partner to defeat both of these troublesome opponents, since its Arena Trap ability stops them from escaping, while Earthquake completely annihilates them. Strong Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Hitmontop are other good options as they can create big holes in the opponent's team with their STAB attacks.</p>"

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>Although it's primarily used as a wall, Regice does have a nice base 100 Special Attack and a pretty good movepool to boot. Ice Beam and Thunderbolt provide excellent type coverage that is only resisted by Lanturn, Shedinja, and Magneton in UU. Focus Blast is used to beat Steel-types like Aggron and Steelix, while Explosion decimates Chansey and Clefable. Alternatively, Rock Polish may be used in the last slot, as it makes Regice a fast sweeper; with Regice's solid defenses, it shouldn't be too hard to find the time to set up.</p> <p>With 176 Speed EVs, Regice outspeeds Adamant max Speed Rhyperior and 0 Speed Hitmontop. More Speed can be invested if you decide to run Rock Polish, as 244 EVs allow Regice to outrun Jolly Swellow after a Rock Polish boost. 48 Attack EVs allow Regice to OHKO Chansey with Explosion after Stealth Rock damage, and the remaining EVs are placed in HP, making Regice a little more bulky while minimizing Life Orb recoil. Substitute may be used in the last slot to avoid status and ease prediction against switch-ins, while Thunder Wave may be used to cripple opposing sweepers. A Modest nature is preferred because it doesn't lower Regice's defenses, but a Mild nature can be run alongside Explosion to give it some extra power.</p> <p>Stealth Rock and Spikes are helpful as they weaken opponents that switch into Regice; Chansey is a good example, as Explosion will score an OHKO when Stealth Rock is on the field. Spikes will damage grounded opponents, helping against Pokemon like Registeel that resist Stealth Rock. Uxie, Donphan, and Claydol can set up Stealth Rock, while Cacturne, Cloyster, and Qwilfish can set up Spikes. Toxic Spikes, which can be set up by Drapion, Nidoqueen, and Qwilfish, are also helpful as they wear down bulky Water-types such as Milotic.</p> <p>If Regice isn't running Rock Polish, Fire- and Fighting-types such as Moltres, Houndoom, and Hariyama walk all over it. To overcome this problem, Slowbro may be used to take on physical attackers, while Slowking fares well against Moltres and Houndoom. Both Slowbro and Slowking have access to Slack Off and Thunder Wave, while STAB Surf and Psychic can deal with Fire- and Fighting-types, respectively. On the other hand, without Explosion, Regice faces problems with Chansey and Registeel, though this may be tackled by pairing Regice with Dugtrio and its Arena Trap ability, or even a powerful Fighting-type such as Blaziken or Hariyama.</p>"

  "Registeel": {
    "overview": "<p>Registeel is one of the best support Pokemon in the UU metagame. Besides setting up Stealth Rock, it is the quintessential defensive pivot that we see so much of in the current metagame. Offensive and defensive teams alike rely on it to check a whole host of threats—many super effective attacks will barely do over 70% to it. While Registeel does have quite a few Pokemon that can switch in and do serious damage to it, no Pokemon is without its faults, and overall Registeel is one of the most solid Pokemon in UU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Registeel is fairly one-dimensional, it does have a few moves that it can utilize to surprise the opponent. Charge Beam can be used in conjunction with three special moves to form a sweeping set of sorts. More Defense EVs can be used to help beat Pokemon like Kabutops, Swellow, and Scyther better, but that is often better left to Steelix. A specially-based \"RegiLure\" set can be employed to lure out Registeel's normal counters, outspeed them, and KO them; Flash Cannon / Hidden Power Water / Thunderbolt / Explosion with an EV spread of 64 HP / 196 SpA / 248 Spe and a Mild nature and Occa Berry is an example of such a set. Rhyperior and Donphan are both 2HKOed by Hidden Power Water, as are the Fire-types that normally switch into Registeel. Flash Cannon hits many Pokemon quite hard, and Thunderbolt can hit Water-types super effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Registeel has quite a few reliable counters. Rhyperior, Donphan, and Torterra only fear Toxic, and can come in on any of Registeel's attacks and threaten a KO with STAB Earthquake. Even Ice Punch only manages 50% against Torterra, and barely scratches Donphan and Rhyperior. Fire-types such as Arcanine, Ninetales, Moltres, and Houndoom can come in on a Shadow Claw or Iron Head and proceed to threaten to KO Registeel with their STAB Fire move. Hitmonlee's STAB Close Combat OHKOes most Registeel, and he has Limber, allowing him to switch into Thunder Wave with no risk. Omastar can switch into Registeel and set up Spikes and Stealth Rock, while Seismic Toss is only a 4HKO. Dugtrio can switch in on Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, or Shadow Claw and trap Registeel with Arena Trap; Registeel is 2HKOed by a Choice Band or Life Orb Earthquake.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This is the set most Registeel use. It checks many common UU Pokemon, such as Mismagius, Rotom, Alakazam, and Venusaur. Registeel boasts impressive base 150 defenses, which means that it has great staying power, even with a mediocre base 80 HP. Seismic Toss is chosen as Registeel's primary attack to deal reliable damage. Thunder Wave cripples fast sweepers and makes them easier for Registeel's teammates to handle, but Toxic wears down bulkier Pokemon. The last slot comes down to Shadow Claw versus Iron Head. While Iron Head gains STAB, Steel is not a very effective attacking type, so Iron Head hits most Pokemon for less damage than Seismic Toss. Shadow Claw is a specialized option to help Registeel beat the Pokemon that are immune to Seismic Toss. In most situations, Seismic Toss will be Registeel's attack-of-choice, making Iron Head a secondary option.</p> <p>What sets Registeel apart from other bulky Pokemon is two things: the ability to set up Stealth Rock and the ability to spread status. These two qualities make it invaluable when facing offense. Stealth Rock is always an important support move, and having it on a Pokemon like Registeel is a reliable way to set it up. Paralysis is a large hindrance to many sweepers looking to break through Registeel. On the other hand, many of Registeel's main switch-ins are Ground-type or very slow, which is why Toxic can be used instead of Thunder Wave. You will want to get Registeel out early to set up Stealth Rock and possibly Toxic a defensive component of the opponent's team. A Careful nature and maximum Special Defense is used to squeeze as much special bulk as possible into Registeel.</p> <p>While Registeel is not a very diverse Pokemon, there are some moves that it can use to net a surprise KO or to do more damage to some common switch-ins. The most notable one is Toxic, which can cripple quite a few of Registeel's counters, such as Milotic, Rhyperior, Donphan, and Torterra. They will be hard-pressed to take repeated assaults from Seismic Toss while Toxic neuters Leftovers recovery. Another less notable option that can be used is Ice Punch, which hits Torterra for a 2HKO while still breaking Mismagius and Rotom's Substitutes. If an opponent has Torterra, it will often be his primary check to Registeel, and Ice Punch will make it think twice before switching in.</p> <p>The final alternative is to shift 56 EVs from Special Defense into Attack and use Iron Head. The EVs will guarantee that Iron Head 2HKOes Mismagius after it switches into Stealth Rock and uses Substitute.</p>"

        "description": "<p>This Registeel set takes a more durable approach to checking threats. With Rest and Sleep Talk, Registeel works as a good sleep absorber for your team. Curse allows it to become an offensive force after a few turns, while also increasing its defensive capabilities. Registeel's typing and pre-Curse defensive stats allow it to set up with ease on many of UU's top threats, such as Venusaur, Milotic, and Mismagius. Rest allows it to take repeated blows from heavy hitters and makes Registeel a threat throughout a game. Iron Head is chosen as Registeel's sole attack since it receives STAB and is boosted by Curse.</p> <p>While Registeel has many chances to use Curse, if it only has one boost under its belt, there are many Pokemon who it should not stay in on. If Torterra or Donphan comes in and Registeel has not boosted sufficiently, chances are they will land a critical hit on Registeel before Registeel can KO them. You should wait until their checks and counters to Registeel are sufficiently weakened before you attempt to sweep. Additionally, Registeel's Attack may not be high enough to pose a threat to some offensive Pokemon after only one Curse. Sometimes it will be in your best interest to Iron Head right off the bat to scout their switch-in. You may also not want to use Rest to heal minimal amounts of damage, since a sleeping Registeel is far more susceptible to being setup fodder than one who is awake.</p> <p>This set has quite a few merits over the standard Tank Registeel. The most obvious is reliable healing in Rest. However, this set cannot utilize Stealth Rock or status, and is more susceptible to being setup bait for Fire- and Water-types. Curse Registeel is a slightly better switch-in to threats who wear down standard Registeel with their powerful attacks, such as Mismagius, Alakazam, and Scyther. The other notable difference is that Curse Registeel actually poses an offensive threat.</p> <p>There are few other options that Curse Registeel can employ. The main change that is suggested is to remove Sleep Talk for Earthquake and change the item to Chesto Berry. This allows Registeel to boost to a reasonable level and use Rest as a one-time pass to restore itself back to 100% health and sweep using the boosts it obtained. An example of a situation where this would work would be if Registeel Curses as Dugtrio comes in, Curses again, Rests, and sweeps. This, combined with the extra coverage that Earthquake provides, can make Registeel a fearsome sweeper.</p>"

When equipped with an Occa Berry, Registeel can draw in and remove its most common counters, such as Moltres and Arcanine, thus paving the way for one of its teammates to sweep. In the earlier stages of the match, this set is meant to be played just as the standard defensive set, acting as a special wall and check to the plethora of Normal-, Flying-, and Grass-types that roam the UU tier, such as Swellow, Scyther, and Leafeon; this is done in order to bait the opponent into a false sense of security. Once the opposing team has been sufficiently scouted for potential threats, Registeel can grab a boost with Curse and retaliate against the subsequent switch-in with the appropriate move.</p> <p>Regarding the moveset, Iron Head acts as Registeel's always invaluable STAB, hitting both Ghost and Rock-types that like taking chances by switching into Registeel while expecting it to Explode, as well as Flying-types, without having to resort to Explosion. Speaking of Explosion, it's an amazing move that can cripple opposing walls like Milotic, and dispatch of Moltres and Donphan, both of which aren't hit for significant amounts of damage by any of Registeel's other moves. The choice for the last move is perhaps the most important part of this set, as it will determine how often this set will rely on taking a risk and using Explosion to defeat its counters. Earthquake is the preferred option, as it abuses Occa Berry to its fullest extent by taking care of Houndoom, Arcanine, and Blaziken. Ice Punch is another option if Registeel's main purpose is beating Torterra; however, it falls short of OHKOing bulkier versions, even after Stealth Rock damage. If neither of those options sound appealing, Counter is an interesting move that severely hurts Rhyperior, Donphan, and Torterra if they hit Registeel with Earthquake, but will be made useless if any of these Pokemon decide to use Roar or any sort of support move instead. Running a Chople Berry is another option if one's main objective is removing Fighting-types such as Hariyama, Hitmontop, and Toxicroak from play; however, none of these Pokemon can actually OHKO Registeel once it has grabbed a single Curse boost, meaning that it should only be used if Registeel's defensive capabilities are heavily relied upon by the user's team.</p> <p>Because this set's main selling point is its ability to take many of Registeel's usual counters out of commission, pairing it with a Pokemon that can benefit from the removal of said threats is highly recommended. Swords Dance Venusaur makes a nifty partner, given the fact that many of its counters, such as Arcanine, Houndoom, and Moltres, are handily baited by Registeel. Absol is another great teammate, as not only does it benefit from the removal of bulky physical walls like Donphan, Torterra, and Arcanine, but it can also easily get past RestTalk Rotom, which completely shuts this set down.</p> <p>Since this set does not have Leftovers, does not have any heavy investment in Special Defense, and has a frequency of having to Explode on the opponent, Registeel loses a considerable amount of its walling capabilities, which means that having secondary checks to the threats it's usually meant to counter is recommended. Specially defensive Arcanine makes a good partner due to its ability to beat most Grass-types and check Rotom, Mismagius, and Alakazam. Rhyperior can take care of most Flying-types of the tier, has the option of setting up Stealth Rock, and enjoys having both Torterra and Donphan removed from play.</p>"

      "Rain Dance Support": {
        "description": "<p>While Registeel is normally used as a standard defensive pivot, it can go the utility route and set up Rain Dance. Explosion is used because it is a safe way to get in a sweeper and can cripple an opposing defensive wall, such as Milotic. Shadow Claw is used as Registeel's second attack to prevent Mismagius and Rotom from getting free Substitutes, which is a common way of dealing with Rain Dance teams. Seismic Toss is preferred in the last slot as a way to deal reliable damage. Thunder Wave can slow down an opposing sweeper, but it also tends to waste turns, something that rain teams don't like.</p> <p>Registeel is a good user of Rain Dance for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it is almost impossible to OHKO Registeel, virtually guaranteeing that you will get rain going. Registeel can also check quite a few Pokemon that give the average rain team trouble once the weather has run out, such as Alakazam, Mismagius, and Venusaur. Since Registeel can often play such a critical role in a rain team's success, you are advised to switch Registeel out rather than using Explosion in the early game. However, this does not mean that Explosion should never be used; a well timed Rain Dance followed by Explosion can heavily swing the momentum in a rain team's favor. Registeel's typing can work well with quite a few rain sweepers by luring out Fire-types, netting them a free switch-in.</p> <p>Registeel, however reliable, should not be your only Rain Dance user. While frail lead users of the move, such as Ambipom, are a fine choice, another bulky Pokemon to help take hits once the rain subsides is usually going to be the most reliable option. Synergy-wise, some of the best partners to Rain Dance Registeel are Rotom and Uxie. Rotom sports handy immunities to Ground and Fighting, and can threaten a KO against Moltres, a common nemesis of Rain Dance teams. Uxie has base 130 defenses, allowing it to switch in on most non-super effective attacks and set up rain. Uxie also provides a check to Substitute Rhyperior and Toxicroak, while Registeel covers Uxie's Mismagius weakness. It goes without saying that Registeel should be paired with sweepers that can take advantage of the rain.</p>"

  "Torterra": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Torterra may be one of the most predictable Pokemon, it has a few key traits that help establish its niche in the UU metagame. Torterra possesses two high Base Power STAB moves that can break many of UU's common physical walls like Milotic, Registeel, and Steelix, as well as Rock Polish to augment its horrible Speed and set up a sweep. While Torterra is mainly used as an offensive Pokemon, it has several defensive uses as well. Torterra is one of the few Pokemon that resists the Rock- and Ground-type attacking combination, which enables it to act as a check to Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Aggron. It also possesses semi-reliable recovery in Synthesis as well as several support options, including Stealth Rock and Leech Seed. Include this land tortoise in your team, and it's sure to do everything but disappoint.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>On the physical side, Rock Slide can replace Stone Edge if you want a bit more accuracy and PP, but the loss in power is incredibly noticeable. Torterra's special attacking options include Leaf Storm, Giga Drain, Energy Ball, Earth Power, and Grass Knot, none of which should be used when Torterra has Seed Bomb, Wood Hammer, Earthquake, and a great base Attack stat. Torterra can also make use of Hidden Power Ice as a way to bypass the various Grass-types that stand between it and a sweep. However, splitting offensive EVs between Attack and Special Attack could prove detrimental in the long run, and Torterra is pressed for moveslots as it is. Swords Dance and Curse are both interesting options on Torterra, as they boost its Attack to very impressive levels. Still, the Ice-type weakness is too great to ignore, and more often than not, such moves will still deal over half damage to even a Curse-boosted Torterra. Torterra's low Speed also prevents Swords Dance from being useful.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Tangrowth is a full stop to any Torterra, as even a Swords Dance Stone Edge fails to 2HKO. Venusaur and Leafeon may work a bit differently but they have the same goal; they trade bulk for Speed, which allows them to outrun and strike down Torterra. 252 HP / 252 Def Hariyama with Ice Punch is a decent check to any Torterra, as even a Choice Band-boosted Wood Hammer fails to OHKO. Weezing is immune to Earthquake, resists Wood Hammer, and isn't 2HKOed by Choice Band-boosted Stone Edge, making it a very solid Torterra counter. With Will-O-Wisp and Flamethrower, Weezing can threaten Torterra all day long. As long as it avoids Stone Edge, Moltres can come in on Torterra and threaten it with Fire Blast.</p> <p>Torterra's lower Special Defense, weaknesses to Ice-, Fire-, Flying-, and Bug-type moves, and its predictability lead it to its downfall. Take advantage of these, as well as its low Speed, in order to get rid of it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<p>With respectable Attack and subpar Speed, Torterra is a natural candidate for Rock Polish. After a single boost, Torterra reaches an amazing 422 Speed, and when coupled with an Attack stat of 348, becomes a dangerous late-game sweeper. Common walls such as Steelix, Slowbro, and Milotic can't take repeated abuse from its Ground- and Grass-type STAB moves. Stone Edge covers Flying-types such as Altaria and Moltres, both of which are immune to Ground and 4x resist Grass. Wood Hammer is preferred over Seed Bomb as it can OHKO the standard Slowbro roughly 80% of the time and guarantees an OHKO on Milotic and Claydol while 2HKOing Spiritomb and Miltank after Stealth Rock damage. However, Seed Bomb can be used if you want a non-recoil Grass-type STAB move that still hits Pokemon such as Slowbro and Milotic hard enough to 2HKO.</p> <p>Although Torterra packs a ton of power, it gets stopped cold by most bulky Grass-types, such as Leafeon and Tangrowth. The most Torterra can do is hit them with a neutral Stone Edge, which deals only 25% maximum to Tangrowth. With this in mind, Pokemon that can remove bulky Grass-types are ideal partners for Torterra. Life Orb Milotic or Slowbro is an excellent lure for Grass-types such as Venusaur, as Venusaur would normally expect to outspeed and OHKO both with a Life Orb Leaf Storm or Power Whip, only to be hit by a powerful Ice Beam or Psychic on the switch. Torterra can also switch into Electric-type attacks directed at Slowbro or Milotic and get a free chance to Rock Polish. Lastly, Swellow is also an excellent partner that is capable of luring in Steel-types such as Registeel and Steelix, U-turning to Torterra, and allowing it to Rock Polish or 2HKO both with Earthquake.</p> <p>Keep in mind that while Rock Polish doubles Torterra's Speed, it can still be outsped and revenge killed by certain Choice Scarf users. Any Choice Scarf-using Pokemon with 423 Speed or above, such as positive-natured Rotom, Venusaur, Moltres, and Primeape, can easily outrun and revenge kill Torterra. Registeel works well with Rock Polish Torterra because it can absorb attacks from Choice Scarf Venusaur and Rotom easily. It can also paralyze them to give Torterra an easier time sweeping. Against Moltres and Primeape, bulky Milotic can help sponge their hits and retaliate back with Surf.</p> <p>While Leftovers is an option if you prefer Torterra to last longer, it comes at the cost of some power. Although Torterra will likely be sweeping late-game, where most of its counters are weakened to the point that Torterra does not always require a Life Orb to finish them off, the power loss is most noticeable when Torterra is weakening its counters early-game.</p>"
      },
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<p>While Torterra is usually seen as a fearsome sweeper, it can also be played as a tough tank, especially with a beefy 384 HP and 339 Defense. As Torterra holds key resistances to the common Rock-, Ground-, and Electric-type moves, it's easy for Torterra to come in, sponge an attack, and begin Leech Seeding foes. Torterra's usefulness doesn't end there; if needed, it can set up Stealth Rock, and even Roar out opponents, such as Dragon Dance Altaria, which fails to OHKO Torterra even with a boosted STAB attack. Torterra can also scare away sweepers with its powerful STAB moves in Wood Hammer and Earthquake.</p> <p>Torterra ideally works on teams that require a physically-bulky Pokemon that can also hit common switch-ins hard. As a plus, Torterra is one of the more reliable Rhyperior counters in the game, fearing only Choice Band-boosted Megahorn. After surviving Rhyperior's attack, it can then threaten Rhyperior with a 4x super effective Wood Hammer or Seed Bomb. Roar works best in the last slot, as it can help Torterra rack up Spikes and Stealth Rock damage, as well as prevent Baton Pass chains from setting up.</p> <p>The EVs are quite simple: 212 HP EVs give Torterra a Leftovers number, while 44 Speed give it the ability to outpace common Pokemon such as Omastar and Rhyperior. The rest is dumped into Defense to maximize its physical bulk.</p> <p>Even though Torterra is an excellent physical tank, Ice-type attacks will usually be enough to take it down. As such, pairing Torterra with Pokemon that can take Ice-type attacks is a good idea. Lanturn makes a great partner as it can easily sponge Ice-type attacks in addition to Fire-type attacks, while also scaring away the users. In return, Torterra can handle Lanturn's Ground-type weakness. Nonetheless, Torterra has high enough Defense to take even boosted physical Ice-type moves; for example, Dragon Dance Feraligatr without Life Orb fails to OHKO Torterra with Ice Punch.</p>"
      },
      "Synthesis": {
        "description": "<p>While Torterra is normally seen utilizing an offensive set with Rock Polish, this set aims to conserve its health with Synthesis while also inflicting damage with Torterra's excellent type coverage; the combination of Grass-, Ground-, and Rock-type moves is only handled by Weezing, Tangrowth, and Leafeon in UU. This set is notoriously effective against unprepared stall teams that lack dedicated checks to Torterra. In addition to its offensive prowess, Torterra's typing gives it an immunity to Thunder Wave and a resistance to Earthquake, both of which allow it to switch into attacks more frequently.</p> <p>Wood Hammer makes a fantastic move in tandem with Synthesis, as Synthesis allows Torterra to offset the damage taken from recoil. Torterra makes a great user of Earthquake as it frightens most Water- and Ground-types with Wood Hammer, which are the Pokemon that often switch into other common users of Earthquake. With that said, predicting a Flying-type switch-in and using Stone Edge or Rock Slide accordingly is an important skill to have when using this set. Selecting between Stone Edge and Rock Slide is essentially a choice between power and accuracy. Stone Edge allows Torterra to hit defensive Altaria and Articuno for heavier damage (possibly OHKOing them), while Rock Slide is a safer alternative that still OHKOes offensive Moltres.</p> <p>Adamant is the recommended nature as it allows Torterra to nab the listed OHKOs and 2HKOs for the set. However, Jolly can be chosen to give Torterra enough Speed to outpace Jolly Aggron and Omastar, and smack them with Earthquake before they can do anything. Some Milotic also run just enough Speed to outrun Adamant Torterra, so a Jolly nature would help there too. Leftovers allows Torterra to bluff a defensive set, allowing it to hit defensive Pokemon that casually switch in for heavy damage. On the other hand, Life Orb secures an OHKO on defensive Milotic and has a higher chance of OHKOing Slowbro; however, it might deplete Torterra's HP too fast in conjunction with Wood Hammer's recoil.</p> <p>Leafeon, Tangrowth, and Weezing are problematic for this set. Leafeon and Tangrowth can take a Stone Edge while shutting down Torterra with Swords Dance + Leaf Blade and Hidden Power Ice, respectively. Weezing can switch into Torterra's STAB moves with impunity and strike back with Fire Blast or Will-O-Wisp. Moltres makes an excellent offensive partner alongside Torterra, as it can safely switch into Torterra's counters and scare them with a STAB Fire Blast. Should your opponent run an offensive Leafeon instead of a defensive one, Registeel is a better answer, as a Swords Dance-boosted Life Orb Return can OHKO Moltres. If you plan on using Moltres as your dedicated check to the aforementioned threats, Rapid Spin support is required.</p> <p>Moltres can beat this set if played correctly because it can switch into three-fourths of the moveset easily. It is advised that you run a bulky Water-type with a reliable recovery move to effectively combat Moltres for the entire match. Milotic and Slowking make excellent Moltres counters and also resist Torterra's Fire- and Ice-type weaknesses. Using Stealth Rock is also a good idea since it restricts Moltres's opportunities to switch in.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Torterra requires no setup to deal damage, allowing it to immediately enter battle and fire off powerful Earthquakes and Wood Hammers coming off a 522 Attack stat. Wood Hammer is highly recommended over Seed Bomb, as its high Base Power allows it to OHKO every Water-type in UU, as well as deal up to 62% to standard Hariyama. Earthquake is another strong STAB move that lacks Wood Hammer's nasty recoil, and also hits the Steel-types that attempt to absorb Wood Hammer. Stone Edge covers Flying-types such as Moltres, Scyther, and Altaria that are immune to Earthquake and take little damage from Wood Hammer. The last slot is up to you; Seed Bomb hits the likes of Claydol and Mismagius without having to rely on Wood Hammer's recoil or Stone Edge's shaky accuracy, while Superpower is a safer option against enemy Torterra and Magnet Rise Aggron than Wood Hammer. Toxic is an option solely for taking out foes such as Tangrowth that wall this set.</p> <p>Ice-type attacks and Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Leafeon are the bane of Torterra's existence, especially for this set, as Torterra could potentially be locked into an ineffective move. Having Pokemon that can take Ice- and Fire-type attacks as well as threaten bulky Grass Pokemon would benefit Torterra greatly. Fire-types such as Arcanine and Houndoom can help safeguard Torterra from Ice- and Fire-type attacks while simultaneously threatening Grass-types.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Torterra's decent base 85 Special Defense is often overshadowed by its much higher Defense. However, with this set, Torterra can counter some of the most powerful special attackers in UU, including Mismagius, Alakazam, and Rotom. This Torterra is also one of the best checks to Slowbro, as it can easily absorb most of Slowbro's attacks (except Ice Beam) and retaliate back with STAB Wood Hammer. Even without any investment, Torterra's Defense stands at a respectable 246, giving it good mixed walling capability. Its Ground- and Rock-type resistances allow it to switch into Rhyperior, Donphan, and Aggron (beware of Ice Punch) and hit them with the appropriate attack.</p> <p>Wood Hammer is Torterra's main STAB attack and hits hard even without Attack investment. Torterra's STAB Earthquake maims Steel- and Fire-type switch-ins, something its fellow Grass-type Venusaur is unable to do effectively. Synthesis grants Torterra instant recovery and allows it to continuously switch into special threats, like Mismagius. Common Mismagius counters such as Spiritomb and Registeel can eventually be worn down, but Torterra can simply replenish its health to continually prevent Mismagius from sweeping. Torterra's last moveslot is dedicated to utility options. Leech Seed grants Torterra and its teammates extra recovery while sapping the opponent's health. Roar lets Torterra force out stat boosters like Curse Miltank and prevents Scyther and Moltres from switching in too easily while Stealth Rock is up.</p> <p>Torterra has access to Stealth Rock and can use it over Leech Seed or Roar in the last slot. It's an inferior option, however, as there are better users of Stealth Rock and the other two moves grant Torterra far more utility.</p> <p>With maximum EVs and a positive nature, Torterra's Special Defense maxes out at a respectable 295. An unboosted Shadow Ball from Mismagius does a mere 23.1% - 27.4%, while +2 Shadow Ball deals 45.7% - 54.1%. As Mismagius uses Nasty Plot, Torterra can strike it with Wood Hammer, which has a chance to OHKO after Stealth Rock. Another scenario includes Mismagius using Substitute as Torterra switches in; as Mismagius sets up with Nasty Plot, Torterra can hit it with Wood Hammer, survive the incoming Shadow Ball, and OHKO it the next turn. With this spread, Torterra will never be KOed by Psychic followed by Signal Beam from Timid Life Orb Alakazam, even with Stealth Rock factored in. This grants Torterra another advantage over Venusaur, which has no hope of taking on Alakazam.</p> <p>Torterra can invest some EVs into Speed to outspeed certain threats, but this should be done with great care, as losing Special Defense means Torterra will be less adept at its walling duties. With 40 Speed EVs, Torterra can outspeed and hit 4 Speed Clefable before it heals. 96 Speed EVs allow Torterra to outspeed and OHKO 4 Speed Lanturn before Lanturn can strike back with Ice Beam. 4 Speed EVs are usually enough, though, as they allow Torterra to outpace most threats like Rhyperior and Azumarill.</p> <p>Torterra makes a great defensive core with Weezing and Milotic. RestTalk Weezing can handle Venusaur and sponge the strong STAB Fighting-type attacks that Torterra can't. Milotic grants great Ice- and Fire-type resistances for Torterra, (especially against the likes of Moltres) while Torterra provides insurance against Electric attacks in return. Thanks to Torterra's ability to draw out Weezing, Omastar has ample opportunities to set up entry hazards. Because it doesn't enjoy status, Torterra appreciates the support of a cleric. Chansey can use Heal Bell and pass Wish to Torterra if it hasn't had a chance to heal with Synthesis. Altaria makes a nice alternative cleric; it resists Torterra's Fire weakness while Torterra resists Altaria's Rock weakness, but the two share a nasty 4x Ice weakness. Altaria also poses more of an offensive threat than Chansey with Dragon Dance.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>This set is designed to set up Reflect and Light Screen, which enable Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Feraligatr and Swords Dance Absol to set up much more easily before sweeping the opponent. What sets Torterra apart from other UU dual screen users is its typing, as most dual screen users are Psychic-type. Torterra is also one of the few dual screens users that are physically offensive.</p> <p>Reflect and Light Screen, obviously, are used on this set to support the team. Light Clay prolongs the moves' effects, allowing for more setup time. Earthquake and Seed Bomb are two powerful STAB attacks that Torterra can use when in a pinch. Torterra isn't a slouch in Attack either, as even with no EVs, Torterra sits at a respectable 254 Attack. For example, Earthquake OHKOes Pokemon such as Blaziken, Ninetales, and Toxicroak, while Seed Bomb OHKOes Omastar and Kabutops. If you wish to increase Torterra's longevity and give it the option of setting up dual screens multiple times, then Synthesis is a good option over one of the attacking moves. Because Torterra will be taking less damage thanks to Reflect and Light Screen, Stealth Rock can be used to support your sweeper, as the residual damage will help score the OHKOs needed for an easy sweep. The EVs listed maximize Torterra's defenses so that it can take physical and special hits with relative ease.</p> <p>As was previously stated, Torterra's typing is another asset to this set. Torterra is a prime target for Bug- and Ice-type attacks. This makes Torterra a great teammate for Charizard as well as Water-types like Feraligatr. Behind screens, it's very easy for Charizard to set up a Substitute and then Belly Drum. Poliwrath can also set up with Belly Drum, or even Bulk Up. Opposing Brick Break users will be a problem as they can shatter dual screens, even against Ghost-types. Fortunately, most Pokemon in UU that can use Brick Break, such Toxicroak, Blaziken, and Hariyama, have better options in terms of Fighting attacks, and in the case of the former two, are KOed by Earthquake. The only Pokemon in UU that commonly uses Brick Break is Scyther, which resists Seed Bomb and is immune to Earthquake anyway, so you will need to find ways around it. Scyther is hurt most by Stealth Rock, which will reduce its HP by half, allowing it to be picked off easily by many Pokemon. Registeel and Steelix also make good counters to it because of their massive Defense stats and resistances to Scyther's STAB moves.</p>"
      },
      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<p>Torterra is a great asset to stall teams thanks to its handy resistances coupled with its formidable physical bulk. These let it switch in on a large amount of the metagame's most common Pokemon, such as Rhyperior, Registeel, and Steelix, and Roar as they either switch or do a negligible amount of damage. This forces the opponent to lose health to entry hazards and possibly reveal previously hidden members of their team. Rest fully heals Torterra, meaning that it is less worried by weak super effective hits.</p> <p>The real selling point of this set is, interestingly enough, its Speed. Torterra sits in a Speed tier slightly above most other defensive Pokemon, and can really put the pressure on opposing stall teams with the combination of Rest, Sleep Talk, and Roar, which allows Torterra to Roar before slower opposing Pokemon have a chance to heal. The fact that it can switch into a majority of Pokemon on opposing stall teams makes its job even easier. 40 Speed EVs also allow Torterra to outpace standard Clefable by two points.</p> <p>This does not mean that this set is dead weight against offensive teams, either. Torterra can abuse its physical bulk to come in on many of the physically-oriented sweepers of UU, such as Hitmontop and other Fighting-types. Balanced teams will tend to include one of the defensive Pokemon mentioned earlier. Once in, Torterra can opt to add further residual damage with Roar, or to try to hit an opposing Pokemon hard with one of its STAB moves. Wood Hammer is preferred due to the fact that nothing is immune to it, and it allows Torterra to hit bulky Water-types that may switch in and use Ice Beam for the KO. Wood Hammer's recoil is also negated by Rest, meaning that Torterra does not need to worry about being low on health. Earthquake is an option that will allow Torterra to hit more Pokemon for neutral damage, most notably Venusaur, and opposing Fire-types, such as Arcanine, for super effective damage. While it allows Levitators and Flying-types to come in freely, they will likely get Roared out again anyway.</p> <p>This set plays off Torterra's ability to force switches and, as such, needs support from Pokemon that can set up entry hazards to function effectively. Good examples are Omastar, which provides handy Fire-, Ice-, and Flying-type resistances, as well as the ability to set up Spikes; and Chansey, which can cover the special attackers that the opponent will try to use against Torterra, in addition to being able to set up Stealth Rock. Toxic Spikes support is useful but not as high of a priority as the other two hazard types.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types like Slowbro pair up well with this set, as they have the ability to check many of common stallbreakers, such as Blaziken. They can also force switches with their stalling capability, furthering the goal of the stall team. Lanturn gets a particular mention because of its Flying-type resistance, good Special Defense, and ability to threaten the Water-types that try to prey on Torterra's Ice weakness. Having another physically bulky Pokemon with a Flying-type resistance such as Registeel and Steelix is good for dealing with Scyther, which can stop this set dead once it is allowed to switch in.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<p>With its great bulk and typing providing many chances of switching in, Torterra can cause a few switches itself. Substitute is a great move to abuse this, because unlike Rock Polish, Substitute Torterra will easily take out a Pokemon every time it comes in because of the free attack it gets. Substitute and Earthquake are staples on this set, but Wood Hammer and Stone Edge can easily be replaced by other moves. Seed Bomb is an option, since Substitute and Wood Hammer's recoil will wear Torterra down quickly. Leftovers allows Torterra to make more Substitutes, although Life Orb can be used for more power.</p> <p>The EVs are fairly simple. 216 HP EVs give Torterra a Substitute number and excellent bulk. With 40 Speed EVs, Torterra outpaces Pokemon such as Omastar and Rhyperior, and the rest of the EVs are dumped into Attack to maximize Torterra's damage output.</p> <p>First and foremost, this Torterra set needs a Pokemon that will lure out Earthquake and Stone Edge for Torterra to switch into and set up on. Fire-types such as Houndoom, Arcanine, and Magmortar are great partners for this reason. Because Torterra also requires a teammate to switch into Ice Beam, you can kill two birds with one stone by using one of the Pokemon listed above. This set also works well with Spikes because it uses the opponent's switches to its advantage. Cloyster is one of the most effective Spikes users, and it also has great defensive synergy with Torterra.</p>"
      },
      "SubSeed": {
        "description": "<p>Torterra makes an excellent staller due to Leech Seed, its high defenses, and its bulky Substitutes. Additionally, Torterra has the ability to 2HKO Venusaur with its powerful STAB Earthquake. Wood Hammer and Toxic are there for completely different reasons, but both of them are viable. Toxic gives Torterra a way around Grass-types not named Venusaur. Wood Hammer helps Torterra fend off Pokemon such as Mismagius, Omastar, Cloyster, and Donphan. The premise is simple: send Torterra into a weak physical or resisted attack and set up a Substitute on the switch. If the Pokemon that comes in is not a Grass-type or Clefable, use Leech Seed and start stalling until they are in KO range. Venusaur and Clefable are both 2HKOed by Earthquake, so they are no worry anyway. If a pure Grass-type such as Tangrowth comes in, hit it with Toxic and stall its HP away. With Wood Hammer, you trade the ability to handle pure Grass-types for the ability to strike Pokemon such as Cloyster and Claydol super effectively.</p> <p>The EVs look a little obscure at first, but they are quite necessary for this set to work effectively. The 216 HP EVs give Torterra bulky Substitutes and a Substitute number, meaning that it will be able to Substitute five times in a row. 80 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature ensure that Torterra can 2HKO the common support Venusaur. 212 Speed EVs allow Torterra to outpace many threats, such as defensive Milotic and Venusaur, as well as Hitmontop, Donphan, and Omastar.</p> <p>For this set to work to its fullest potential, it needs to be paired with Spikes and Stealth Rocks users, as well as a Ghost to block Rapid Spin. Omastar, Qwilfish, and Cloyster are great at setting up Spikes, and they also all resist Ice. Defensive Mismagius works great as a Pokemon to block Rapid Spin because it can Taunt Foresight users such as Hitmontop. Generally, any SubSeed set requires you to remove Grass-types for it to function well, so Scyther and Moltres make great partners for Torterra, as they can switch into any Grass-type attack and OHKO the user with Aerial Ace and Fire Blast respectively. Common Grass-types that will stand in Torterra's way include Exeggutor, Tangrowth, Leafeon, and physically defensive Venusaur. Exeggutor is easily eliminated with the help of a Pursuit user such as Absol, Drapion, or Spiritomb. Tangrowth and Leafeon can be stalled out with Torterra's Toxic, but having a Weezing with Flamethrower as a partner will make Torterra's life a lot easier, as it can wall and burn every Grass-type except Exeggutor. Finally, even though Venusaur is rather unpredictable, it is easily defeated by faster Fire- and Flying-types such as Houndoom, Arcanine, and Swellow.</p>"

  "Monferno": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Monferno may appear to be outclassed by Blaziken due to its lower defenses and attacking stats. However, this NFE Pokemon has a few tricks up its sleeve that give it a niche in UU battles, such as access to Stealth Rock, Nasty Plot, and a unique base Speed of 81. The most important note to keep in mind is never to play Monferno like Blaziken--otherwise, you will just end up with an inferior Pokemon. However, if you make the most of Monferno's unique traits, it can be an effective sweeper or supporter.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Since Monferno's bulk is essentially nonexistent, its sets should place all EVs in Attack, Special Attack, or Speed. Max Speed is usually the best choice to outpace the abundant base 80s, such as Blaziken, Venusaur, and Kabutops. If going mixed, a Special Defense-decreasing nature rather than a Defense-decreasing nature is usually a better idea, since the majority of priority attacks are physical.</p> <p>Monferno has access to both Swords Dance and Nasty Plot, but both of those moves are hard to pull off due to Monferno's frailty and relatively low power when compared to similar UU sweepers. Blaziken is usually a more effective user of Swords Dance due to its much higher Attack stat, but Blaziken doesn't have access to Nasty Plot. Nasty Plot Monferno is a rather nasty stallbreaker, as a +2 Life Orb Grass Knot has a good chance to OHKO Milotic after Stealth Rock damage, and many other common stall Pokemon will fall to either Fire Blast or Close Combat. However, Monferno faces stiff competition from fellow Nasty Plotting Fire-types Houndoom and Ninetales.</p> <p>Much like its big brother, Infernape, Monferno can try to run a mixed set that takes advantage of Close Combat to OHKO Chansey. Unlike Infernape, Monferno is often too weak to KO even Pokemon who are weak to its attacks. Monferno has access to both Vacuum Wave and Mach Punch, but it is usually hard to fit these attacks on a sweeping set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Defensive Arcanine is usually the best Monferno counter; it has Intimidate to buffer Close Combat, a resistance to both Fire Blast and Grass Knot, and Morning Sun to abuse Life Orb recoil against mixed Monferno. Monferno is so frail that Extreme Speed or Flare Blitz will usually KO it after one round of Life Orb recoil and Stealth Rock. As long as Moltres can avoid switching into Hidden Power Rock, it can outpace Monferno and OHKO with a STAB Air Slash.</p> <p>Milotic is a good counter for most physical and mixed Monferno. It should beware of Nasty Plot versions, though, as they deal 84.5% - 99.7% with boosted Grass Knot. Slowking is a more reliable counter than Milotic due to its higher special bulk and Fighting-type resistance. Slowbro is also a good counter to Monferno, somewhat ironically--while special Blaziken has no problems smashing through Slowbro but cannot break Milotic, special Monferno usually has no problems with Milotic but cannot beat full health Slowbro. This is because Blaziken must resort to the 70 Base Power Hidden Power against Milotic, while Monferno is able to use the 100 Base Power Grass Knot. Against Slowbro, however, Grass Knot only has 80 Base Power, so Monferno's lower Special Attack comes back to bite it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>This set is designed to set up an early Stealth Rock while putting heavy offensive pressure on the opponent's lead as well. While suicide leads are generally less effective in UU than in OU due to the slower nature of the metagame, Monferno sets itself apart from traditional suicide leads through its access to Endeavor. Endeavor sets the opponent's HP equal to Monferno's, so it can use it to bring bulky Pokemon like Uxie and Milotic down to 1 HP before it is KOed. Fire Blast is a standard STAB attack that lets Monferno deal damage before its Focus Sash is broken, or even finish off Endeavored Pokemon who decide to use a support move instead of an attacking one. Finally, Taunt is the primary option in the last slot since it can prevent leads like Omastar from setting up any hazards. However, Vacuum Wave lets Monferno KO faster Focus Sash leads after they are hit by Endeavor.</p> <p>Monferno is not designed to survive past the first few turns of a battle, so not much traditional team support is needed. However, carrying a Pokemon who can easily switch into Ambipom is a good idea since lead Ambipom handily beats Monferno. Also, this lead fits best on offensive teams, since they can make the most of the early pressure made possible by Monferno's sacrifice.</p> <p>Other than Ambipom, dangerous leads include Snover and Hippopotas. Since they automatically induce damaging weather, Monferno won't be able to successfully Endeavor against them. Snover is problematic than Hippopotas since it is 4x weak to Fire Blast and usually doesn't carry an attack effective against Monferno, but its hail will still prevent Monferno from using its Focus Sash against one of Snover's teammates. If using Shoddy Battle, Monferno's Focus Sash will not save it against multi-hit moves due to a glitch in how Focus Sash interacts with them. This means Cloyster, Rhyperior, and Armaldo with Rock Blast (the common multi-hit attack used competitively) may OHKO Monferno through its Focus Sash when they should not be able to. Finally, the most reliable method of dealing with Endeavor leads is to switch to a Ghost-type who can outspeed and KO Monferno before it can use another move. If one suspects the opponent might be planning to switch to a Pokemon like Spiritomb (with Shadow Sneak or Sucker Punch) or Rotom (who is naturally faster than Monferno), you can select Fire Blast instead of Endeavor, which stings quite a bit when Blaze is activated (it OHKOes offensive Rotom, for example).</p> <p>To have the best chance of activating Monferno's Focus Sash, 0 IVs are used in HP, Defense, and Special Defense. Only 504 EVs are used since placing the remaining 4 EVs in one of Monferno's defenses or HP would be counterproductive, while giving them to Attack would be pointless. A Hasty nature is preferred over a Naive nature since many of Monferno's resistances are commonly physical attacks, so lowering its Defense means a wider range of attacks will deal fatal damage.</p> <p>Good teammates for the lead set are not really teammates in the traditional sense, as they should be Pokemon who derive utility from Monferno's sacrifice rather than ones who can back up Monferno. However, one chooses to run a sweeper Monferno, there are some good partners to keep in mind.</p> <p>Defensive Fire- and Water-type Pokemon are usually the largest threats to a Monferno sweep, depending on your specific set. Using lures such as Passho Berry Houndoom, Passho Berry/Occa Berry Explosion Steelix, or Curse + Explosion Registeel can eliminate these problem Pokemon. The best way to combat Fire- and Water- type Pokemon is a Fire/Water/Grass core of your own. Venusaur, Sceptile, and Leafeon are good offensive Grass-type Pokemon to use against bulky Waters. To an extent, Leafeon can lure defensive Fire-type Pokemon and take them out with a Swords Dance-boosted Double-Edge. An Azumarill or Kabutops of your own can be very helpful to combat opposing Fire-types as well.</p> <p>As a sweeper, Monferno naturally loves Stealth Rock to help it get KOs against defensive Pokemon. If one uses a spinblocker, Stealth Rock can be an important component of your contingency plan against opposing Fire-types. Spikes support is also great for weakening opposing walls, but Toxic Spikes won't do anything particularly effective for Monferno--if the opposing Pokemon is out on the field long enough to feel the effects of Toxic Spikes, chances are it has already KOed the frail Monferno.</p>"

  "Arbok": {
    "overview": "<p>Arbok comes across as one of the many inferior Poison-type Pokemon in the UU metagame. Despite having a wide array of powerful moves, Arbok's poor overall stats sorely let it down. Looking on the bright side, its ability, Intimidate, allows it to act as a check for many common UU Pokemon, such as Venusaur and Leafeon. The cobra isn't a familiar sight in the UU metagame, but it should by no means be underestimated unless you want your team poisoned and paralyzed all over.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Arbok has access to the three elemental fangs, however they are too weak, and in addition to that don't provide any significant coverage alongside its other moves. Aqua Tail can be used as it hits most of the targets that both Seed Bomb and Earthquake hit for super effective damage, and has the added benefit of hitting Moltres super effectively. Stockpile isn't worth considering, as Arbok has poor defenses to start with and lacks a reliable means of recovery. Shed Skin has the potential to cure Arbok of any stat disorder and can be used in tandem with Rest, though Intimidate is the better option to help cushion physical attacks, not to mention Arbok's low HP and defenses will rarely allow it to still live after the several turns that it is asleep. Screech can catch common switch-ins to Arbok off-guard, and has the potential to force a lot of switches.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky defensive behemoths such as Donphan and Steelix have little to fear from Arbok as it fails to even 2HKO them with Choice Banded Seed Bomb and Earthquake, respectively. Ideally, they can hit back with STAB Earthquake, putting a swift end to the cobra. Other common Steel-types like Registeel fall in the same category, being able to take anything Arbok can throw at them with ease due to their sheer physical bulk. Aggron hates taking an Earthquake due to its 4x weakness, however it can switch in on anything else. Moltres can switch in on a predicted Seed Bomb or Earthquake and fire off a boosted Fire Blast, although it should be wary of Glare. Both Rotom and Mismagius can switch in on anything bar Crunch and proceed to set up or cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Both Quagsire and Gastrodon can take down Arbok with their STAB Ground-type attacks and fear nothing it can throw at them bar Seed Bomb. Arbok's overall stats make it easy to revenge kill or set up on, hence the only thing to be worried about is being paralyzed or poisoned.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Glare": {
        "description": "<p>Glare is a neat tool for paralyzing common Ground-type switch-ins such as Rhyperior. Where Weezing's Will-O-Wisp would be useless against special attackers, Arbok's Glare cripples both physical and special sweepers alike. Glare also has the added bonus of being able to paralyze anything it hits, regardless of type, though it does come at the cost of a not-so-hot 75% accuracy. Gunk Shot boasts a great Base Power which can deal a considerable amount of damage to almost any Pokemon that doesn't resist it, but has very low accuracy. Poison Jab has risk-free accuracy, although it wields considerably lower Base Power than Gunk Shot, which is vital for a Pokemon of Arbok's caliber. Earthquake has good coverage with Arbok's STAB, hitting Steel- and Rock-types that are immune to or resist Gunk Shot for super effective damage. It also has the added benefit of hitting Fire-types such as Arcanine and Houndoom for a considerable amount of damage. This is followed by an option of Seed Bomb or Crunch. The former is the best way to get some nice damage on Water-types, especially Omastar, Quagsire, Kabutops, and Gastrodon, all of whom are 4x weak to Seed Bomb. Crunch provides better overall coverage, but it hits fewer Pokemon super effectively. However, these few targets, particularly Rotom and Mismagius, take little damage from anything else Arbok can throw at them; so if your team is weak to the aforementioned Pokemon, Crunch might be the superior option.</p> <p>The EV spread allows Arbok to take powerful, resisted hits with some degree of comfort. Combine this with the fact that Intimidate reduces the opponent's Attack by one stage as Arbok switches in, and it makes an excellent physical tank. 252 HP EVs give the cobra all-around bulk, while the remaining EVs are dumped in its Attack stat. One fact that is pretty much overlooked is that Arbok can absorb Toxic Spikes, and thanks to its ability in combination with its high defensive EV investment, it can switch in on all Toxic Spikes users. This can be used to your advantage, as slower sweepers such as Rampardos and Rhyperior can set up and sweep more easily on paralyzed Pokemon. Entry hazards are especially useful if you are running an offensively-inclined team, as the opponent would most likely switch his or her crippled Pokemon as you try to set up or kill them accordingly. Uxie and Mesprit are invaluable teammates as they are immune to Ground-type attacks, which Arbok cannot afford to take, resist Psychic-type attacks, and are able to set up Stealth Rock, amongst other roles such as setting up dual screens. Cloyster's impressive Defense means it can switch into almost any physical attack with ease. In addition to that, it can set up Spikes as well as spin away enemy hazards for Arbok.</p>"
      },
      "Switcheroo": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band is a great asset for a Pokemon who is as desperate for attacking power as Arbok. Despite the unappealing fact of being locked into a single move, Switcheroo, when used with correct timing, can render an opposing Pokemon virtually useless. Common switch-ins to Arbok include Registeel and Clefable, and handing them a Choice Band can significantly cripple them whilst at the same time allowing fellow members to set up more easily. Choice Band is also a great item to ruin the sweeping chances of stat-up boosters such as Dragon Dance Feraligatr and Rock Polish Rhyperior, and to cause the opponent to have to predict a lot more. The second slot features two solid STAB moves, Gunk Shot and Poison Jab. Gunk Shot has a massive 120 Base Power, although with its shaky 70% accuracy, it can cause an almost certain KO or even win to go astray. However, Arbok can do with the extra 40 Base Power Gunk Shot brings, especially when it has given away its Choice Band; although if you prefer having 100% accuracy, Poison Jab is your better bet. Earthquake has good coverage with Arbok's STAB move, hitting both Rock- and Steel-types for super effective damage. However, Registeel and Regirock are 3HKOed most of the time, and hence Arbok is better off switching out before they can fire off an Earthquake of their own or cripple Arbok with Thunder Wave. The last moveslot depends on what your team can handle better. Seed Bomb can do a number to Pokemon who are 4x weak to Grass-type attacks such as Gastrodon, Rhyperior, and Kabutops, while Crunch is Arbok's only method of hurting Ghost-type Pokemon such as Rotom and Mismagius.</p> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allows Arbok to tie with other positive base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Venusaur and Blaziken. The remaining EVs are dumped into Attack to give the purple snake as much bite as it can pack. Entry hazards are very useful for a Pokemon such as Arbok as it comes close to landing an OHKO on most Pokemon in the metagame. Uxie is immune to Ground-type attacks and can set up Stealth Rock consistently throughout the match due its sheer bulk, and it can also aid Arbok by crippling the opposing team with Thunder Wave or Yawn. In addition to the above, Uxie usually has little Speed investment so that it can U-turn after the opposing Pokemon attacks it, thereby giving Arbok a safe switch-in. Cloyster and Donphan can switch into most physical attacks aimed at Arbox with ease, and can also set up and spin away entry hazards that threaten to reduce Arbok's longevity. Donphan can also defeat most Steel- and Rock-types that give Arbok constant trouble with its STAB Earthquake.</p>"

  "Dugtrio": {
    "overview": "<p>Dugtrio is a force to be reckoned with in UU. Its ability to trap and KO some of the biggest threats in UU, including Blaziken, Toxicroak, Absol, and Houndoom, is a very great asset. Dugtrio's impact on stall teams has resounded throughout the tier, causing Shed Shell usage to spike from near-nonexistent numbers. On the other hand, it must have a sufficient level of support to bring down the premier walls of UU, a concept that is easy to understand, but not as simple to execute. While Dugtrio may be harder to use than one would think upon first glance, it is enough of a threat that there is no doubt that one should at least be sufficiently prepared for it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Beyond the moves already listed, Dugtrio's physical movepool is pretty barren. Dugtrio can potentially be used as a lead if it runs Stealth Rock and Protect while holding a Focus Sash, though its use is very limited when compared to the other two sets. Soft Sand is an item option on the first set. It can give opponents the impression that Dugtrio is Choiced and therefore allow Dugtrio to net a surprise KO when Pokemon such as Mismagius try to set up on it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky Grass-types such as Tangrowth, Torterra, and Leafeon are excellent counters to Dugtrio. They take little damage from anything outside of a Choice Band Aerial Ace, which still doesn't do near enough, and can KO Dugtrio with their Grass-type STAB moves or set up on it with Rock Polish, Leech Seed, or Swords Dance. Bulky Levitate users, such as Rotom and Uxie, and bulky Water-types, such as Milotic and Slowbro, are also quite efficient answers to Dugtrio. If Dugtrio is Choiced and locked into the wrong move, beware of being Pursuit trapped by Pokemon like Absol. Speaking of trapping, Porygon2 can Trace Dugtrio's Arena Trap, forcing it to stay in, and KO it with Ice Beam. Gardevoir can do this as well; just make sure it is EVed defensively so that it can survive a Sucker Punch or Earthquake. Make sure you avoid priority moves from Pokemon such as Donphan, Azumarill, Arcanine, and Hitmontop. Finally, EV spreads bulkier than the norm can really mess Dugtrio up—be sure to consider the possibility of these randomly appearing!</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its high Speed stat and Arena Trap, Dugtrio has been a very reliable revenge killer since Advance. Earthquake is your primary attack, not only because it is Dugtrio's only STAB move, but also because it can score some useful OHKOs on Pokemon like Houndoom, Blaziken, and Toxicroak. Dugtrio's Dark-type move will enable it to hit Claydol, as well as Ghost-types with Levitate such as Mismagius and Rotom. Which move is better will often depend on the situation. Rotom and Mismagius can easily bypass the threat of Sucker Punch by setting up a Substitute or burning Dugtrio with Will-O-Wisp. However, Sucker Punch will enable Dugtrio to revenge kill weakened enemies that either are faster or use priority moves, such as Choice Scarf Typhlosion and Aqua Jet Azumarill. Stone Edge complements Earthquake quite nicely, hitting the Flying-types that are immune to Dugtrio's Ground-type STAB move. Keep in mind, though, that many of UU's Flying-types are generally too quick for Dugtrio to handle. More often than not, Altaria and Charizard will all be at +1 Speed by the time Dugtrio switches in to revenge kill them, and it is not uncommon to encounter a Scyther or Moltres holding a Choice Scarf.</p> <p>Substitute, Dugtrio's final move, may seem like an odd choice, but it has a very important purpose: to protect Dugtrio from Sucker Punch. Absol, Toxicroak, Houndoom, and Nidoking are all easily KOed by Earthquake, but they each can hit Dugtrio with a powerful Sucker Punch before it can attack. To remedy this, use Substitute on a predicted Sucker Punch. Next turn, Dugtrio can KO its foe while the Sucker Punch will only break the Substitute. As an added bonus, if the foe is weakened enough, Dugtrio can retain its Substitute by KOing it with a Sucker Punch of its own. Take note that an opponent may suspect that you have Substitute and break your Substitute by using another attack instead of Sucker Punch. In such cases, you will have to outpredict your opponent to come out on top. While evading Sucker Punch is the main perk of using Substitute, it has a few other uses. You can use it to avoid Explosion or the occasional Counter from Registeel or Regirock that have not been weakened enough to be KOed by Earthquake. Additionally, if you can switch Dugtrio in on a Choice-locked Electric-type move, you will be able to Substitute for free, which can help ease prediction and protect Dugtrio from being revenge killed itself, especially by priority moves.</p> <p>For those who feel that they cannot predict well enough to use Substitute effectively, or for those who use Choice Band over Life Orb, another option in this slot is Pursuit, which can be used to hit foes like fleeing Shed Shell Chansey or a Choice Scarf Rotom locked into Thunderbolt. Beat Up is also available in the last slot because Chansey is capable of outstalling Dugtrio's Earthquakes with Wish and Protect. However, with Beat Up and a sufficiently healthy team, Dugtrio is guaranteed an OHKO on Chansey.</p> <p>Both natures are viable, but make sure to note the benefits and drawbacks of both. An Adamant Dugtrio will tie with positive-natured base 105 Speed Pokemon, such as Mismagius without Hidden Power Fighting and Manectric, and will fail to outspeed anything faster, such as Ambipom and Espeon. A Jolly Dugtrio, on the other hand, will outspeed all of those and tie with other positive-nature Dugtrio, Alakazam, and Sceptile. The loss of power will not make you lose out on any notable OHKOs or 2HKOs, but be aware that it can be significant in some situations, mostly when taking into account random or residual damage. For example, an Adamant Choice Band Dugtrio has a good chance of 2HKOing a maximum HP / maximum Defense Bold Milotic with two layers of entry hazards laid on the field, whereas a Jolly one has barely any chance of doing so. If you are using a Jolly nature, maximizing Speed is not required, as Dugtrio will only be tying with opposing Dugtrio, a rare scenario to encounter, Alakazam, which can be KOed (albeit unreliably) by Sucker Punch, and Sceptile, which Dugtrio will generally not be trying to revenge kill. You may instead use a spread of 252 Atk / 40 SpD / 216 Spe, which outruns Jolly Ambipom. The 40 Special Defense EVs will give Dugtrio a better chance of surviving a +2 Vacuum Wave from Toxicroak.</p> <p>As with nature, both items are also viable, and the difference in power is again mostly situational. If you use Choice Band, beware that any Pokemon can set up on Dugtrio if it is stuck on the wrong move. Being locked into Earthquake will give Pokemon such as Moltres the opportunity to fire off a powerful attack for free. A Choice-locked Night Slash grants an easy entrance to Blaziken and Drapion, as does Stone Edge to Nidoking and Donphan. Furthermore, if Absol happens to show up after Dugtrio eliminates something with Night Slash, Dugtrio risks being Pursuit trapped and eliminated, unable to do anything in return.</p> <p>One thing to watch out for is your opponent setting up on Dugtrio, even more so if Dugtrio is Choiced. Because of the potency of UU's Flying-types, locking Dugtrio into an Earthquake is one of the most dangerous things to do. If you dare to do so, make sure you can address your opponent's next Pokemon. Milotic can handle a lot of the common Flying-types, such as Moltres, Altaria, and to an extent, Scyther. It also fares well against Ground-types, which will come in on a Choice-locked Stone Edge, as well as most of the Fighting-types, which have no fear of Dugtrio if it is locked into Night Slash. The most dangerous Pokemon, however, are those that can set up on Dugtrio even if it's not Choiced. Torterra is the best example of this. Dugtrio must have Aerial Ace to even touch it, and even with Choice Band, it has a minuscule chance of a 2HKO. Meanwhile, Torterra can threaten a sweep with Rock Polish. Make sure you have a Pokemon like Tangrowth or Mesprit to deal with Torterra and other similar threats like Swords Dance Venusaur and Leafeon.</p> <p>Shed Shell, while rare, can also be an obstacle to Dugtrio, enabling opposing Pokemon to escape the clutches of Arena Trap. It is found mainly on common walls, mostly Chansey and Registeel. To solve this problem, one can use Trick and Knock Off to rob these Pokemon of their items. Chansey will commonly switch into Espeon and Mesprit, expecting to sponge a special attack, only to have its Shed Shell Tricked away. The threat of a Grass attack from Venusaur and Tangrowth will lure Registeel into play, and Knock Off will easily strip it of its Shed Shell.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>While Dugtrio is certainly fast, there is still a wide array of Choice Scarf users that outspeed the standard set. This set aims to fix this issue. With a Choice Scarf equipped, Dugtrio outruns just about all of UU and most of OU as well.</p> <p>Your attacking moves are virtually the same as those on the standard set; however, they will all suffer a significant drop in power since Dugtrio no longer has the boosts from Choice Band or Life Orb. It will still OHKO the more fragile of sweepers, as well as Pokemon with 2x or 4x weaknesses to Earthquake, such as Houndoom and Nidoking in UU and Heatran, Infernape, and Magnezone in OU; however, you will generally have a much more difficult time scoring OHKOs and 2HKOs on bulkier Pokemon. For example, the standard Chansey will never be 2HKOed if it has Leftovers and can proceed to wear Dugtrio down with Toxic and Soft-Boiled, barring a critical hit. Therefore, Beat Up is again worthy of consideration in Dugtrio's last moveslot. In OU, Earthquake will never OHKO even uninvested Tyranitar, and it can easily dispose of Dugtrio with Crunch.</p> <p>With the loss of power, Dugtrio loses out on many KOs, but the additional Speed gives it a new set of targets. Dugtrio can now safely revenge kill several other Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Blaziken, Primeape, and Hitmonlee, although the latter two must have taken residual damage or a Defense drop from Close Combat for an OHKO to be guaranteed with Earthquake. Charizard with a Salac boost and Altaria with a Dragon Dance can no longer elude Dugtrio, although Altaria must have taken Stealth Rock and Life Orb damage for Stone Edge to have a chance at OHKOing it.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is a must. Dugtrio will need as much Attack as possible if you want it to reliably revenge kill several of the aforementioned threats. With 212 Speed EVs and a Choice Scarf, Dugtrio will reach 493 Speed, which is enough to always outrun Choice Scarf base 100 Speed Pokemon with a positive nature, such as Typhlosion and Jirachi, as well as Omastar in the rain, Choice Scarf Heatran, Choice Scarf Heracross, and Choice Scarf Jirachi.</p> <p>Using Choice Scarf Dugtrio is somewhat similar to using the standard set. Its weaknesses are very much the same, most notably its Pursuit weakness. While it has gained the ability to more easily counter certain Speed freaks, Pokemon like Chansey and Registeel, in UU, and Tyranitar and Blissey, in OU, need to be sufficiently weakened before Dugtrio can KO them. Choice Scarf Dugtrio is usually played mid- to late-game, when your opposing Pokemon will have received sufficient damage. Try and build up residual damage on the Pokemon you are aiming to bring down. Using U-turn on your Swellow and Mesprit will wear down Registeel and Chansey little by little while also allowing you to sustain your momentum in the battle. Spikes from Pokemon like Roserade and Skarmory will also help a lot.</p> <p>Also, make sure you utilize Dugtrio's gigantic Speed stat. Dugtrio now even outspeeds Electrode, which means that if it dares to use Taunt or Thunderbolt, Dugtrio can easily switch into Electrode and OHKO it before it can set up rain, providing that said Electrode has a Damp Rock instead of a Focus Sash. With a Choice Scarf, Dugtrio can outrun Motor Drive-boosted Electivire and, if you can predict the Thunderbolt, easily beat it. Avoid Hidden Power, though. Dugtrio can now also switch in on a Jolteon's Shadow Ball, but sadly, Hidden Power Grass and Baton Pass are still problematic.</p>"

Since then, they have hated Farfetch'd and did everything they could to make this thing suck as much as possible on the battlefield. No Base Stat over 65, a gazillion better Normal/Flying-types, some interesting moves (none of which can be employed to their full potential) and limited ways of obtaining it ever since the beginning of the Pokemon games. The best thing that can be said about Farfetch'd is that it got a personal item (Stick) that makes it get random critical hits. When you don't need them, usually.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Pluck for things that have a Berry, Mirror Move for laughs, and False Swipe for in-game catching. Air Slash is a decent STAB move. Farfetch'd is too fragile to use Curse, Roost or Psych Up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>See the Counters section of all its bird brethren, starting from Pidgeot and going up, and ignore all \"watch out for\" statements.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Violation!": {"description": "<p>Oh boy. Okay, here is the deal. Farfetch'd has amazing coolness value, and with this, it astounds its opponent into switching six times in a row.

      "CH'Ding": {"description": "<p>If you're using Farfy, you should be a rather optimistic fellow. Therefore, you will assume it critical hits as often as it dies.

  },
  "Dodrio": {
    "overview": "<p>Dodrio's combination of high Attack and great Speed makes him a scary offensive threat. Not many Pokemon can stand up to one of the strongest Brave Birds in the game. Although Dodrio's movepool is rather shallow, he still has useful options in Taunt, Acupressure, Agility, and Baton Pass. Dodrio is often compared to Swellow because they play similarly, and many opt to use Swellow instead because of his higher Speed, access to U-turn, and Guts ability. One shouldn't discount Dodrio, however, as he hits harder right off the bat, has an easier time against certain Pokemon because of Taunt, and has a slightly better ability to Roost. Dodrio may not be the easiest Pokemon to use, but he can certainly carry his weight on any team, whether by breaking through common defensive cores or supporting the team with Baton Pass.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dodrio can Baton Pass Agility, but Ambipom and Lopunny generally do that much better. Acupressure is a bit more restricted and is an interesting option to Baton Pass, but Dodrio is better off with offense. Dodrio can also run Baton Pass on offensive sets to scout for the opponent's Dodrio counter, but it's illegal with Brave Bird and forces Dodrio to run the much weaker Drill Peck. Steel Wing can be used to hit Rock-types a bit harder than Payback, but is useless outside of that.</p> <p>Dodrio can run a Flail set that becomes incredibly powerful once set up, but his inability to significantly hurt Rock- or Steel-types makes it a difficult option to pull off. Such a set is also susceptible to priority users as well.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The Choice Band set is extremely difficult to counter without a Rock- or Steel-type. Offensive Pokemon that resist Brave Bird, like Kabutops or Rotom, will be outsped and 2HKOed, and therefore do not make reliable counters. Luckily, Stealth Rock and Brave Bird recoil will quickly wear Dodrio down, and strong priority attacks harm him significantly.</p> <p>The second set hits a bit weaker, so Slowbro and Weezing should be able to take 2 hits as long as Dodrio is using Sharp Beak. From here, they may either status Dodrio, try to stall him out, or flat out attack him. They both must be wary of Taunt, however, and of the fact that this particular Dodrio is more of a lure to help set up another dangerous teammate by weakening the counters.</p> <p>In general, using a Pokemon like Regirock, Rhyperior, or Steelix will make Dodrio seem much less scary. Dodrio is also outsped by several common Pokemon like Ambipom, Alakazam, and Swellow, who can all KO him. He also has trouble switching in because of his frailty, although he does have an immunity to both Ghost- and Ground-type attacks; if you're firing off powerful attacks, Dodrio won't have an opportunity to switch in(besides when a teammate is KOed).</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Dodrio is one of the most fearsome physical sweepers in UU. With just a STAB Brave Bird or Return, he can 2HKO the entire tier, bar bulky Steel- or Rock-types. Powerful physical walls like Slowbro and Weezing don't even stand a chance against Dodrio's STAB attacks. Even Pokemon that resist Flying, like Rotom and Kabutops, are unable to switch in lest they be 2HKOed.</p> <p>Brave Bird and Return are Dodrio's STAB attacks, and are used to punch holes into teams. Common cores like Fire-Water-Grass or Weezing + Milotic are unable to handle Dodrio effectively. Pursuit is useful to catch Psychic- and Ghost-types on the switch, and works excellently on Mismagius that utilize Hidden Power Fighting; however, Payback can be used to hit Rotom and bulky Psychics on the switch without suffering recoil, and is Dodrio's strongest attack against Rhyperior and Regirock. The last slot gives Dodrio a useful priority move in Quick Attack. However, one can choose to run Toxic to cripple bulky Rock-type switch-ins and limit the amount of times they can counter Dodrio.</p> <p>Dodrio's high Speed is a blessing in that it allows him to outspeed a majority of the tier and land the KO before being KOed himself. Dodrio should have a Jolly nature with 252 Speed EVs to ensure he outspeeds the base 95 Speed group and at worst ties with other maximum Speed base 100s. Although an Adamant nature provides even greater power, it's not recommended since Jolly already obtains the same amount of KOs. Dodrio's high Speed allows him to function as a decent revenge killer, while Early Bird allows Dodrio to act as a 'sleep absorber' if the need arises. Dodrio can run the exact same set with a Choice Scarf equipped to further increase his Speed, but other Pokemon like Primeape and Blaziken do this much better because of their greater coverage and lack of a Stealth Rock weakness.</p> <p>Because Dodrio has a weakness to Stealth Rock, using a Rapid Spinner is highly recommended. Hitmontop and Claydol are the best choices for this role because they also provide a handy resistance to Rock-type attacks. Hitmontop's access to Foresight and Claydol's access to Trick allow them to spin more efficiently. Rhyperior and Torterra are great offensive partners because of their ability to set up on Pokemon like Steelix, Regirock, and Registeel, while Dodrio eliminates problematic Pokemon like Milotic, Donphan, and Weezing. Since Dodrio is rather frail, a Pokemon that can take priority attacks comes in handy; Milotic and Slowbro are great options.</p>"
      },
      "Utility Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set has nearly the same wallbreaking capabilities of the Choice Bander, but mixes in utility options like Taunt and Roost to support the team and help Dodrio stick around a bit longer.</p> <p>Brave Bird is Dodrio's main STAB attack and still obtains the 2HKOs on Milotic and Donphan, two common Pokemon that 'glue' many teams together. The second slot is for Dodrio's alternative STAB attack. Return has a good amount of power and can hit Pokemon that resist Flying hard, but Quick Attack allows Dodrio to hit faster Pokemon. Although it may seem odd to use Roost on a Pokemon as frail as Dodrio, he can use it on weaker attacks like Pursuit and on predicted Sucker Punches, giving him a bit more longevity. Taunt allows Dodrio to defeat walls that hope to stall him out, such as Slowbro, and prevents Pokemon like Regirock and Omastar from setting up entry hazards on him. Taunt also prevents Registeel and Uxie from throwing around status attacks, allowing your counters to switch in without being crippled. Toxic is an option to weaken pesky Rock-types like Rhyperior, while Payback can be used to eliminate Rotom without having to take a good amount of recoil; it is also Dodrio's strongest attack against Rock-types.</p> <p>With Sharp Beak and a Jolly nature, Dodrio has a very high chance to 2HKO Donphan and Milotic. Sharp Beak is the main option to prevent Dodrio from suffering more recoil than he has to, although Life Orb guarantees the 2HKOs on the aforementioned Pokemon and allows Dodrio to hit harder in general. With both Taunt and Roost, Dodrio makes an excellent stallbreaker because many stall teams don't have a Flying resist, and he can Roost off the damage from their weak attacks.</p> <p>Dodrio appreciates Rapid Spin support to help patch up his Stealth Rock weakness. Again, Hitmontop and Claydol are excellent options. Fire-types like Houndoom and Blaziken eliminate pesky Steel- and Rock-types while enjoying Dodrio's ability to take down Milotic. This particular Dodrio works well in a 'double Flying' strategy with either Moltres or Swellow. Moltres works great in particular because of its ability to eliminate Steel-types with a STAB Fire Blast and OHKO Rhyperior with Hidden Power Grass, while Dodrio is capable of removing Moltres's number one counter, Milotic, from the game.</p>"

  "Electrode": {
    "overview": "<p>As one of the fastest Pokemon in the entire game, Electrode can roll into the battlefield and unleash swift hell with a handful of useful supportive and offensive options. It's no wonder that its silly grin can also be used as a lightning-fast Taunt to the foe's face, while its ability to call down the rain swiftly and effectively is a niche that only it can claim in the UU tier. Electrode's ability to summon down God's wrath in the form of Thunder makes it all the more terrifying. Combine Thunder with Hidden Power Ice and you've got a neat little Pokemon with great coverage. What makes Electrode even better is its access to Explosion, as unlike Uxie, Ambipom, and Omastar, it is able to immediately take down a dangerous threat while giving a safe switch-in for its Swift Swim buddies.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the fun stops there. Electrode's mediocre stats across the board (excluding Speed) don't do it justice - it is fragile and, most of the time, doesn't hit hard enough. The fact that rain teams are dropping in usage, due to how easy it is to play around them via Pokemon such as Venusaur, Milotic, and Rotom, ruin Electrode's fame. Electrode's severely limited movepool outside of the ones already mentioned is the last nail in the coffin, sealing Electrode's fate as an almost-forgotten NU Pokemon. Still, once Electrode gets the ball rolling, there's really no stopping it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With an incredibly limited movepool, it's no wonder that Electrode doesn't have many useful options. A Choice Specs set utilizing Signal Beam in the last slot is a possibility, but it still doesn't deal much damage. Light Screen is an option to lessen the pain for your team on the special side, but funnily enough, Electrode doesn't usually have room to spare for it. It has access to Sucker Punch, which is interesting, though not effective on a Speed demon. A viable option to use is Hidden Power Grass, which can hit Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types for super effective damage - most importantly, Quagsire and Rhyperior. Another set to consider is Substitute + Petaya Berry, which allows Electrode to do three things: scout the switch-in, stop status from affecting it, and always gain a +1 Special Attack boost. However, it can only be used once on the field. Other gimmicky or interesting but ineffective options include, but are not limited to: Magnet Rise, Screech in conjunction with Explosion, Mirror Coat, Taunt in combination with Toxic, Torment, and Thunder Wave. For alternative items, Shuca Berry or Focus Sash can allow Electrode to survive a Ground-type move such as Earthquake, but you have to ask yourself what exactly will Electrode be doing in retaliation other than Explosion?</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Due to Electrode's mediocre offense, it has a plethora of counters. Bulky Grass- and Electric-types such as Venusaur, specially defensive Tangrowth, Rotom, and Lanturn can switch in with ease and 2HKO with Grass-type attacks, Shadow Ball, or Surf, respectively (Stealth Rock must be present to give a guaranteed 2HKO for Surf). Lanturn is immune to Thunderbolt and resistant to Ice, effectively putting a stop to Electrode's shenanigans. As for Rotom, it has a special niche in that it is immune to Explosion due to its Ghost typing and takes little damage from Hidden Power Ice. Speaking of Ghost-types, any bulky Ghost-type, including Spiritomb and Dusclops, can switch in on a predicted Explosion and save a teammate from fainting. Chansey and Clefable should also be noted since with their great special bulk, they can withstand several special attacks while dishing out a 3HKO with Seismic Toss. However, both walls must watch out for Explosion as it will certainly either put a huge dent on them or OHKO them. Registeel is sturdy enough to absorb every attack from Electrode and respond with multiple Seismic Tosses. Bulky Ground-types such as Claydol, Rhyperior, and Steelix make great counters to Electrode since they can easily take on Hidden Power Ice and OHKO back with Earthquake. As a final resort, a revenge killer such as Choice Scarf Dugtrio, Choice Scarf Hitmonlee, and Fake Out + Mach Punch Hitmontop can KO Electrode without much trouble. Do not be surprised if you cannot outright counter Electrode, as it is meant to use Explosion as a last-ditch effort.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rain Dance Support": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to stop the foe's plans from succeeding while supporting your rain team. With Damp Rock equipped, Electrode can effectively grant seven turns (given that Electrode uses Explosion right after using Rain Dance) of rain to a Swift Swim sweeper. Taunt stops any foe slower than Electrode from using a dangerous support move, such as Stealth Rock, Sunny Day, Sleep Powder, and Thunder Wave. On the offensive, Electrode has Thunder to vanquish the foe. In addition, Thunder has a neat 30% chance to paralyze the foe and has 100% accuracy under rainy conditions. Lastly, Explosion is what makes Electrode so successful - it can not only potentially eliminate a counter, but it can also give a Swift Swim Pokemon a free switch-in so that it can rampage through the opposing side.</p> <p>The EV spread allows Electrode to deal as much damage as possible with Explosion and Thunder and reach 390 Speed, outspeeding neutral-natured base 80 Pokemon with +1 Speed. Naive is chosen over Hasty to take less damage from physical priority moves such as Fake Out and Mach Punch. Static is also the ability of choice over Soundproof as the 30% chance to paralyze a physical attacker can be useful in the long run; moreover, Soundproof only aids against uncommon moves such as Bug Buzz, Sing, and Roar. As an alternative, Hidden Power Water can be used over Explosion to help eliminate Rock- and Ground-type Pokemon. It also gains a nice power boost from Rain Dance.</p> <p>Due to the fact that this set is meant for leading, it is inevitable that it will run into poor match-ups, especially against Timid Choice Scarf Venusaur and TrickScarf Uxie. There are two ways to manage these threats: by testing your luck and see if they actually don't have a Choice Scarf by Taunting, or by immediately switching out to a safe pivot, such as RestTalk Registeel and Chansey, or, in Uxie's case, Choiced Pokemon (especially ones with Pursuit). RestTalk Registeel resists both Grass and Psychic attacks and is immune to Poison. Due to its huge defenses, even Venusaur's Earthquake won't be scratching it hard enough. Chansey has Natural Cure to easily mitigate Venusaur's Sleep Powder and enormous special bulk to take on any special attack it delivers. As for Choiced Pokemon, Choice Band Spiritomb stands out as the most successful one due to its immunity to Psychic, great all-round defenses, and access to STAB Pursuit. Another deadly match-up is against Omastar, since Electrode must try its luck with two risky, consecutive Thunders in order to defeat it. If Electrode attempts to set up Rain Dance, it will not only activate Omastar's Swift Swim, but also fail to destroy Omastar's Focus Sash. The safest option here is to switch out to a sleeper such as Venusaur, or if your team doesn't have one, Ludicolo, and either put Omastar out of commission with Sleep Powder or 2HKO it with Energy Ball.</p> <p>Since this set's goal is setting up the rain, it requires Swift Swim sweepers such as Kabutops, Omastar, Ludicolo, and Qwilfish to take advantage of it. Kabutops is monstrous under the rain; with a single Swords Dance, not much can withstand its might. Omastar is the special equivalent of Kabutops, but it lacks a Special Attack-boosting move to improve its chances of sweeping. Ludicolo is a must-have due to its ability to take care of opposing Water-types, mainly Milotic, which would give other Swift Swim sweepers trouble. Qwilfish is mentioned due to the fact that its STAB Poison Jab can help eliminate a good portion of Grass-types (though sadly, Venusaur is neutral to the attack).</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>Despite its mediocre Special Attack, Electrode can be a potent offensive threat to a variety of Pokemon due to its great coverage and incredible Speed. Thunderbolt is Electrode's main STAB attack that can usually 2HKO most Pokemon that don't resist it, excluding specially-bulky walls. Hidden Power Ice goes hand-in-hand with Thunderbolt by striking Ground- and Grass-type for super effective damage. Hidden Power Water is an alternative over Hidden Power Ice to strike Ground- and Rock-type Pokemon, most notably Rhyperior and Steelix, harder. In order to stop incoming status and recovery, Taunt is a great option, but you may find Charge Beam to be more suitable to your tastes if you want Electrode to have a chance to boost its Special Attack. Lastly, Explosion is available to utterly destroy any Pokemon not of the Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-type, especially Chansey and other special walls.</p> <p>The EV spread maxes out Electrode's special offense while giving it enough Speed to outpace +2 Jolly Rhyperior, Swellow, and +1 neutral-natured base 80 Pokemon. The rest of the EVs are thrown into Attack for a bigger bang with Explosion. Life Orb is the chosen item to dish out as much damage as possible while being able to switch between moves.</p> <p>Although unusual, this Electrode can make a great Baton Pass receiver. All it requires are Special Attack boosts from either Ambipom's Nasty Plot, Drifblim's Calm Mind, or Espeon's Calm Mind, and it can clean up during late-game like a hot knife through butter. It is not an all-powerful combo, though, especially taking into consideration the physical fragility of both the listed Baton Passers and Electrode, so take caution if you decide to use Electrode like this.</p> <p>Due to this set's aim to sweep instead of support, entry hazard support is extremely welcome. Stealth Rock from the likes of Uxie or Mesprit and Spikes setup from Omastar or Cloyster help Electrode gain KOs it wouldn't normally get otherwise. Uxie and Mesprit can also absorb Ground-type attacks that threaten Electrode, use Thunder Wave to neutralize Choice Scarf Pokemon, and batter foes, more specifically Grass-types, with a mixture of Psychic, Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, and/or Grass Knot. Omastar may be weak to Ground, but it is still a very reliable Spikes user due to its high physical bulk and deadly Special Attack. Cloyster has even more Defense, a neutrality to Ground, and Explosion to eliminate troublesome Grass-types. For better insurance against Grass-types and Registeel, using a Fire-type such as Moltres is a good idea. It can switch into Ground-, Steel-, and Grass-type attacks with ease, recover off the damage, and apply heavy pressure with Fire Blast onto the opposition.</p>"

  "Exeggutor": {
    "overview": "<p>Exeggutor is an all-around phenomenal Pokemon capable of playing many roles, both offensive and defensive. Exeggutor faces stiff competition from Venusaur, but it has a few qualities that make it a deadly sweeper, including numerous resistances, STAB Psychic, and a higher Special Attack stat. It also possesses a slew of support options, including Sunny Day, Trick Room, and dual screens. The only thing holding back Exeggutor is its relatively low Speed and Special Defense stats, but its aforementioned assets are enough to outweigh its shortcomings.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Exeggutor can use Ancient Power to deal with Moltres and Charizard on the switch. However, it has limited coverage outside of those two, and Psychic already deals high damage. Exeggutor can act as a physical wall when needed thanks to its unique typing and access to Wish, but one must keep in mind that Tangrowth has better defensive capabilities and is generally the better option. Leaf Storm is also illegal with Wish. Exeggutor can run a physical set with access to Swords Dance and a deadly STAB attack in Wood Hammer, but the Pokemon it usually draws in are always the same and you're better off utilizing its higher Special Attack stat. The only benefit of using a physical set is catching Chansey off-guard. Exeggutor can also run a Choice Specs set if you want to strip a sizable chunk out of nearly anything with Leaf Storm, but Life Orb provides sufficient power anyway, and it is usually essential for Exeggutor to not be locked in on one move lest it grant threats like Moltres and Spiritomb free switch-ins. Stun Spore can also be used on the offensive sets over Sleep Powder if you wish to paralyze faster threats on the switch.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Every time you switch in a potential counter, you risk Exeggutor putting it to sleep, paralyzing it, or Exploding. It is important to keep in mind that your switch-in is never completely safe.</p> <p>The best method with dealing with Exeggutor is figuring out which set it is using. The bulky offense set holds Leftovers and is soundly beaten by Chansey and Registeel thanks to their enormous special bulk. The Life Orb set can be beaten by smart switching through resistances. Anything that is faster and can threaten it with a super effective move, such as Venusaur, Moltres, and Arcanine, is considered a check. Choice Band Spiritomb can switch into Low Kick and Psychic and place Exeggutor in a checkmate position with the threat of one of Sucker Punch, Pursuit, or Shadow Sneak. For the most part, you'll want to play against Exeggutor intelligently and limit its switch-ins.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set exploits Exeggutor's ability to deal high damage to nearly anything. Exeggutor's valuable resistances to Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-type moves allow it to switch in on many common Pokemon and begin attacking. Many of these Pokemon happen to be slower than Exeggutor, which makes up for its relatively low Speed. There are only a few safe switch-ins to this set, the most reliable being the easily-exploitable Chansey and Registeel.</p> <p>Psychic and Leaf Storm are strong STAB moves to work with and have pretty good coverage alongside each other. Psychic is the better move to fire off the bat as it can hit many of Exeggutor's soft-counters, like Fire-types and Venusaur, for high damage. Leaf Storm hits the selection of Pokemon who can withstand Psychic, such as Milotic and Spiritomb. Sleep Powder allows Exeggutor to neutralize potential counters, and Synthesis allows Exeggutor to replenish its health, making it more difficult to take down. Leech Seed can be an alternate option if you want to wear down Registeel and Chansey while they are asleep.</p> <p>The 252 Special Attack EVs maximize Exeggutor's damage output, while the given Speed allows it to comfortably outpace Adamant Aggron. Placing a few additional EVs into Speed can be used to safely outpace the other Pokemon who linger around 200 Speed, such as defensive Milotic and Venusaur. The remaining EVs are placed in HP to give Exeggutor more bulk. An alternate spread of 252 HP / 132 Def / 124 Spe with a Modest nature can be used if you really need to make use of Exeggutor's resistances to combat physical threats like Torterra, Leafeon, Azumarill, Feraligatr, and Fighting-types. It still has a very respectable 314 Special Attack stat even with no investment, which ensures that Exeggutor doesn't turn into an inferior Tangrowth.</p> <p>While this set might seem outclassed by Venusaur due to its lower Speed, Exeggutor has a couple of niches that make it the better choice for certain teams. It boasts a Ground-type resistance and better physical bulk than Venusaur, allowing it to more easily switch into Donphan, Torterra, and Rhyperior. Psychic is also a better STAB move to pair with Leaf Storm than Sludge Bomb in terms of type coverage.</p> <p>Chansey and Registeel are the safest switch-ins to this set. The former has a high Special Defense stat and can easily beat Exeggutor with Thunder Wave or Toxic, while the latter resists both of Exeggutor's STAB moves and can beat it with Thunder Wave and repeated Iron Heads. Therefore, Substitute Torterra makes a good offensive partner to Exeggutor, as it can easily switch into and threaten out both Registeel and Chansey, taking advantage of the predicted switch to create a Substitute. Furthermore, Registeel is commonly paired with Milotic, and Torterra can easily break this core apart with its dual STAB moves.</p> <p>Exeggutor is rather slow and specially frail, and it won't enjoy taking super effective attacks from Fire- and Ghost-types or from specially oriented Venusaur. For this reason, Exeggutor pairs up well with the infamous Registeel and Milotic core, which can easily deal with the most common combination of offensive threats that Exeggutor has trouble blowing off. These include Rotom, Mismagius, Venusaur, and Arcanine, to name a few. Both of them also provide opportunities for Exeggutor to switch in on--Milotic draws in physical Grass-types, while Registeel attracts Ground- and Fighting-type moves.</p>"
      },
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set is perhaps one of the most difficult sets to switch into due to the raw power it commands. Life Orb provides an extra kick to Exeggutor's attacks, allowing it to muscle its way through soft checks such as Houndoom (who even has a chance of being OHKOed by Leaf Storm with Stealth Rock in play), Arcanine, and Mismagius. As opposed to the previous set, Leaf Storm can be used more freely since Life Orb allows it to take a sizable chunk from most Pokemon's HP, even when resisted. This set utilizes a \"hit-and-run\" strategy, so using your best attack when the opportunity arises is preferable.</p> <p>Sleep Powder is a given on this set as it allows Exeggutor to place its initial switch-in into a deep slumber. Leaf Storm and Psychic are Exeggutor's obligatory STAB moves. Low Kick can be squeezed in the last slot to hit Registeel or Chansey on the switch or to damage them while they are asleep. Low Kick deals 47% average to 252 HP/ 0 Def Registeel and 41% average to 4 HP / 252 SpD Chansey, while also hitting Houndoom for super effective damage. Explosion can be used over Low Kick to go out with a bang once Exeggutor's health has been significantly reduced. Its huge power ensures that it will dent most Pokemon who don't resist it. However, Low Kick is the safer and more reliable option for the most part.</p> <p>Running a Speed-boosting nature is an option to outspeed Adamant Torterra, Jolly Aggron, and minimum Speed Drapion, Uxie, and Rotom, but is inadvisable as the power loss generally isn't worth it. This set focuses more on punishing slower teams, and Exeggutor needs all the power it can get.</p> <p>There is no safe switch-in to this set due to the massive power Exeggutor holds and its ability to hurt everything with the appropriate move. However, one can exploit Exeggutor through smart switching and utilizing resistances, and take advantage of its relatively low Speed to threaten it. For example, if you predict the Leaf Storm, you should withdraw to Moltres or Venusaur; predict the Psychic, and you should bring in Absol, Drapion, or Houndoom. Uxie and Scyther can also switch into Psychic or Leaf Storm, respectively, and threaten Exeggutor with a fast U-turn. Choice Band Spiritomb can also switch into both Psychic and Low Kick and scare it off with the threat of Shadow Sneak or Sucker Punch, potentially catching it with Pursuit.</p> <p>Offensive Milotic pairs with this very well, as it has trouble with opposing Chansey and bulky Waters, both of which Exeggutor can weaken or take out, consequently paving the way for Milotic to sweep. Defensively, special defensive Clefable is a good partner as it draws in Fighting-type moves to give Exeggutor switch-ins, while also providing Wish support to Exeggutor to heal Life Orb or other residual damage.</p>"
      },
      "Sunny Day": {
        "description": "<p>This set allows Exeggutor to patch up its middling Speed with Sunny Day by means of Chlorophyll. This set can work as both a supporter of Sunny Day or a sweeper; the former can take advantage of the free switch granted by Sleep Powder to set up Sunny Day (for eight turns thanks to Heat Rock), while the latter can deal huge damage with Life Orb-boosted attacks.</p> <p>Like the other sets, this set is difficult to switch into due to the power it provides. Psychic and Solar Beam severely damage most of the UU metagame, Registeel and Chansey the most notable exceptions. The added Speed means that smart switching through abusing resistances will not work as well against Exeggutor, as it can fire off the appropriate move the next turn. The choice in the final slot depend entirely on how you decide to use Exeggutor. Sleep Powder is favored over Explosion if you want it to mainly be a Sunny Day supporter, while Explosion is preferred if you wish to purely sweep instead. Explosion will hit most things for hard damage and can OHKO Chansey.</p> <p>Exeggutor is a useful asset on a Sunny Day team as it has a powerful secondary STAB in the form of Psychic, which can be used to get rid of opposing Grass/Poison and Fire-types that stand in the way of more typical sun sweepers. Hidden Power Fire will gain a pseudo-STAB boost in the sun, and can deal with Registeel.</p> <p>Fire-types with Solar Beam are great partners if you want to use this on something other than a full sun-based team; Moltres, Arcanine, or Houndoom can all wreck bulky Waters with super effective Solar Beams and most other things with boosted Fire Blasts, while Exeggutor is great at luring and taking out opposing Fire-types and Chansey. Chlorophyll users such as Victreebel, Tangrowth, and Shiftry can make use of the eight turns of sun Exeggutor can provide.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>The combination of Sleep Powder, dual screens, and Explosion makes Exeggutor a brilliant support Pokemon. It gets many opportunities to switch in on one of its six resistances and support the team. Explosion is an absolute staple on this set, as it allows Exeggutor to safely bring in the next Pokemon after providing dual screens. If you prefer to keep Exeggutor for the entire match, then you can swap Explosion with Leaf Storm; however, one might find it too difficult to switch in Exeggutor the second time due to its low Speed, and the dual screening process will be more difficult now that your opponent knows you have Exeggutor in the wings. Leaf Storm can also be used over Sleep Powder if you have another sleep inducer elsewhere on your team; it is still a powerful attack without any Special Attack investment.</p> <p>Jolly should obviously be used if Explosion is the only attack, but if you're running Leaf Storm as well then it is up to personal preference whether you choose to weaken your Leaf Storm or your Explosion with your nature.</p> <p>Rhyperior and Houndoom both work really well with this Exeggutor since they are both excellent at drawing in moves that Exeggutor resists, giving it opportunities to switch in. Additionally, both of these threats are exceptionally deadly behind dual screens--Houndoom is not OHKOed by Milotic's Surf or Azumarill's Aqua Jet and can take them out in return with boosted Dark Pulses. With the combination of natural bulk, Solid Rock, and dual screens, Rhyperior is a vicious threat and can set up Substitute or Rock Polish. Swords Dance Kabutops also works in the same manner as Rhyperior, but it is more potent offensively after a Swords Dance boost.</p>"
      },
      "Trick Room": {"description": "<p>Exeggutor makes a very reliable Trick Room user, as it can almost guarantee a free turn to set up by using Sleep Powder. It can then hit hard with a Life Orb boosted Leaf Storm off its enormous base 125 Special Attack stat or simply get out of the way with Explosion in order to let in another Trick Room sweeper. Exeggutor is relatively bulky and is by no means obliged to explode straightaway: it can try to sweep by itself with Leaf Storm more than once in a game.</p> <p>Rhyperior and Marowak both lure in Grass- and Water-type moves on which Exeggutor can set up. Octillery can draw in Grass- and Electric-type moves, and once Exeggutor has provided Trick Room support, Octillery can sweep with Water Spout.</p>"}

  "Noctowl": {
    "overview": "<p>Noctowl has always been the black sheep... err bird, of the Normal / Flying family. Its stats are completely backwards, and while cool and unique, they don't help it accomplish much. Looking at them, you'd think Noctowl could work as an effective special wall, but with weaknesses to three extremely common attacking types in UU, including an awful wing-clipping weakness to Stealth Rock, a lack of any form of offense, and a low physical defense, Noctowl's goose is effectively cooked. There may still be hope left for Noctowl, as it is one of the single best Grass-type counters available thanks to its special bulk and immunity to sleep moves; however, this niche still is not enough to save it from obscurity. Owls may be wise, but in this case, the most battle-hardened of players are wise enough to steer clear from using Noctowl.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hypnosis can be used in place of Toxic, but its accuracy is unappealing. Feather Dance can provide the same buffer against physical attacks as Reflect, except it doesn't provide support for the whole team. Light Clay can be used alongside Reflect to give Noctowl's sweeper teammates an easier time setting up. Flame Orb and Psycho Shift allow Noctowl to utilize a makeshift Will-O-Wisp, but it's not a great idea since the time it takes to set up is too much and Noctowl just doesn't have the Speed to make it happen.</p> <p>On the offensive side, Air Slash, Psychic, Shadow Ball, and Heat Wave are available alongside the use of Agility, but since Noctowl's attacking stats are so poor, Night Shade will prove to be more useful overall. Noctowl has the bulk to set up Rain Dance or Sunny Day; however, it again lacks the Speed and versatility to do so effectively. Noctowl can make use of Substitute to become a Toxic SubRooster, but with the lack of Pressure to stall out Stone Edge's PP or the Speed to use Substitute before an attack, Noctowl is better off doing something else.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>You don't have to be Ozymandias to take down this Nite Owl. Although setting up on Noctowl is difficult due to Whirlwind, Taunt renders Noctowl almost completely helpless. Furthermore, any physical attack not named Shadow Claw or Earthquake breaks right through Noctowl's low Defense stat. Rhyperior and Aggron beat Noctowl easily with their STAB Rock-type attacks, and so will any offensive Pokemon with STAB Thunderbolt or Ice Beam. All in all, don't try to set up on Noctowl, aim for its weaker Defense stat, and it will usually be forced to wave the white flag.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Due to its excellent special bulk, Noctowl can become an effective special tank. The idea when using Noctowl is to switch it into a special attack and work from there. Whirlwind is for phazing, and works wonders with entry hazards. It can also help Noctowl scout out the opponent's physical attackers and stop a setup attempt. Roost grants Noctowl reliable recovery, and removes its nasty weaknesses to Ice-, Electric-, and Rock-type attacks. Unfortunately, Noctowl is normally too slow to take advantage of this, and when Roosting, Noctowl is exposed to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks. Because Noctowl's offensive stats are rather poor, Night Shade is used to obtain steady damage. The last slot is up to the player's discretion: Noctowl can use Toxic decently while phazing to rack up even more residual damage, Reflect cushions Noctowl's poor Defense and can help out the rest of the team, and Psycho Shift throws back status attacks so that Noctowl isn't crippled by them.</p> <p>Insomnia is what makes Noctowl one of the best Grass-type counters available, as it is able to switch into special Venusaur, Exeggutor, and Tangrowth with impunity and force them out with Whirlwind or whittle their health down with Night Shade. Noctowl has to be careful around physical Grass-types, however, as they can punch holes right through its weaker defensive stat. Noctowl also makes a great switch-in to Venomoth and Butterfree, as well as common Yawn users such as Uxie and Hippopotas.</p> <p>Milotic pairs excellently with Noctowl since it draws out Venusaur; in return, Noctowl lures in Rock-types, such as Rhyperior and Aggron, which Milotic can take out with its STAB Surf. Noctowl appreciates Pokemon with solid physical bulk to cover its weaker defensive stat. Good teammates to fill that void include Rhyperior, Registeel, and Donphan. Donphan gets a special mention as it is also able to provide Rapid Spin support to clear the field of Stealth Rock, which severely hampers Noctowl's ability to switch in. As Noctowl's main job is to phaze out opposing Pokemon and rack up residual damage, Spikes and Stealth Rock support are a must. Good teammates to set up entry hazards include Omastar, Cloyster, Uxie, and Donphan. Having a spinblocker, such as Rotom, will also help Noctowl more effectively accomplish its goal. Magneton gets a special mention as a notable teammate as it resists all of Noctowl's weaknesses and can eliminate most Steel-types that stand in its way. In return, Noctowl is immune to Ground-type attacks and can switch into special Fire-type moves directed at Magneton with relative ease. Noctowl can also be a buffer special wall alongside Milotic and Chansey, as it can handle some unique threats that they struggle against such as Venusaur, SubSeeders, and Mismagius.</p>"

  "Ariados": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Ariados appears nearly useless; its typing is both common and poor, giving it redundant STAB coverage and a weakness to Stealth Rock. Its stats are all mediocre except for its Attack, and even then it lacks the physical movepool to take advantage of it. It's hard to imagine why anyone would want to use Ariados given these flaws, but it does have one thing going for it: it is one of only two Pokemon in UU capable of Baton Passing a trapping move. Successfully trapping an opponent whom one of your Pokemon can set up on will often lead to an easy victory. Access to Toxic Spikes and a useful ability in Insomnia gives Ariados further value as a supporting Pokemon. It can't do much on its own, but on a team built around its strengths, Ariados is nigh-irreplaceable.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There honestly isn't much else Ariados can do. Attack is its highest stat, which might suggest that an offensive set would be possible, but its offensive movepool is tiny and most of the moves have overlapping coverage. Outside of its STAB attacks, its only remotely viable physical options are Sucker Punch, Shadow Sneak, Return, Pursuit, and Bounce. Any offensive set that Ariados tries will be completely walled by Steel-types, Rock-types, and essentially every Pokemon who invests in Defense, given the low Base Power and poor super effective coverage of the aforementioned moves. Night Shade could be useful for consistent damage on the Baton Pass set since Ariados has no Attack investment, although it is useless against Normal-types. Toxic, Swagger, and Disable are all options to cripple a trapped Pokemon, but it's generally better to simply pass the trap to a sweeper right away instead of wasting turns with moves like these.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Moltres is the best counter thanks to its super effective STAB moves and sky-high Special Attack. Even with Light Screen up, it can still OHKO Ariados with Fire Blast. Similarly, Arcanine can KO through Reflect with a combination of Flare Blitz and Extreme Speed. Without screens, almost any Choice Scarf Pokemon who can reach 397 Speed will outspeed and 2HKO Ariados, preventing it from pulling off a trap-pass. Any Pokemon who learns Taunt, Haze, or a phazing move, like Ambipom, Milotic, and Steelix, will also ruin the spider's fun. Barring all that, simply avoid switching a non-threatening Pokemon into Ariados, such as Registeel and Chansey, as its entire strategy revolves around the trapped Pokemon being setup fodder.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>Ariados is mostly known for its near-exclusive ability to Baton Pass a trapping move; other than Absol, who is frailer and usually better off attacking directly, Ariados is the only Pokemon in UU who is capable of executing this strategy. The goal is to trap an opponent with Spider Web, then Baton Pass to a teammate who can comfortably set up on the trapped Pokemon and sweep. Since opponents will often switch out of Ariados in fear of being trapped, it's usually best to use Agility first so Ariados can outspeed the switch-in. If they bring in a Pokemon who can't OHKO Ariados and whom one of your Pokemon can set up on, trap it with Spider Web. Otherwise, simply pass the Agility boost to a teammate and save Ariados for later. Bug Bite is mostly filler, but it does decent damage if Ariados is forced to attack and can occasionally steal a Salac or Liechi Berry boost from an opponent.</p> <p>If you find yourself not using Bug Bite, there are a few other decent options you can try. Poison Jab is an alternate STAB move with a much higher base power than Bug Bite; however, the lack of coverage is disappointing. Substitute eases prediction and can make your sweeper's set-up even easier, although the likelihood of successfully passing Substitute, Agility, and Spider Web all at once is rather low. Toxic Spikes is another alternative to provide team support if Ariados manages to trap a defensive Pokemon who doesn't directly threaten it.</p> <p>Ariados needs teammates who can set up several offensive boosts against a variety of trapped Pokemon. Calm Mind Clefable is perhaps the best example; with good bulk, a pseudo-immunity to status, and Soft-Boiled for healing, it should be able to get six Calm Mind boosts quite easily against nearly any special attacker. If Ariados passes it an Agility boost as well, it can sweep the opponent's entire team with +6 Special Attack, +2 Speed, and the near-perfect coverage provided by Thunderbolt and Ice Beam. Dragon Dance Altaria is another good option. It can set up on any Pokemon who lacks an Ice- or Rock-type attack, heal itself with Roost, protect itself from status with Heal Bell or Safeguard, and sweep with +6 Dragon Claw or Outrage.</p> <p>Maximizing Speed should be your first priority, since Ariados wants to take as few hits as possible. A Jolly nature and 252 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Swellow and neutral-natured Choice Scarf base 80s after an Agility boost. The rest of the EVs go towards improving Ariados's general bulk, but the last 8 EVs should go into Defense rather than HP to reduce the damage Ariados takes from Stealth Rock. Even with this investment in Speed and defenses, there are still many Pokemon who can prevent Ariados from being successful. Choice Scarf Moltres is the most dangerous example. It will outspeed Ariados even after an Agility, and either of its STAB attacks will easily OHKO. The same is true for Arcanine and Houndoom, although they aren't seen holding a Choice Scarf nearly as often. Almost any Choice Scarf Pokemon can 2HKO Ariados, so if Ariados thinks it's faster and tries to trap them, it will be KOed before it can use Baton Pass. Because of this, it is best not to attempt a trap-pass until you have scouted the opponent's team.</p>"
      },
      "Toxic Spikes Lead": {
        "description": "<p>While most people's first instinct when seeing Ariados is to assume it's a Baton Passer, it also has some useful tools that can make it a unique Toxic Spikes lead. Insomnia lets Ariados beat sleep leads such as Venusaur and Jumpluff, and access to priority attacks allows it to take down frail Focus Sash leads like Alakazam. It also has the element of surprise in its favor; since Ariados is mostly known as a trap-passer, many defensive leads will switch out of Ariados in fear of being trapped and set up on, giving Ariados a free turn to set up Toxic Spikes.</p> <p>Setting up two layers of Toxic Spikes is this set's main objective. The rest of the moves are there to help Ariados take on some common UU leads. Sucker Punch is an excellent priority attack that lets Ariados defeat faster leads who would otherwise outspeed and 2HKO it. Shadow Sneak is significantly weaker, but it's still usable if you don't like the risk of an opponent setting up on Sucker Punch. Poison Jab is Ariados's most powerful STAB attack and does solid damage to a variety of leads. Bug Bite is another option to hit Psychic-type leads harder, but the lower Base Power causes Ariados to lose to some leads whom it could otherwise beat, such as Ambipom, and Sucker Punch hits opposing Psychic-types nearly as hard anyway. Protect prevents Fake Out users from breaking Ariados's Focus Sash and can be a useful scouting move later in the match.</p> <p>The EVs focus on Attack and Speed in order to beat as many common leads as possible. With maximum Attack, Ariados can 2HKO Ambipom with Poison Jab + Sucker Punch and Choice Scarf Mesprit with two Sucker Punches, while Focus Sash prevents them from OHKOing Ariados in return. Focus Sash also guarantees that Ariados will set up both layers of Toxic Spikes against slower leads before being KOed, which is why Speed is maximized, as Ariados won't be outspeeding much otherwise.</p> <p>Ariados is completely shut down by Taunt leads and easily defeated by bulky leads who either outspeed it or have access to priority moves. Uxie is never 2HKOed even by Bug Bite and will always 2HKO Ariados with Psychic or Zen Headbutt. Spiritomb takes pitiful damage from any attack that Ariados has and can KO back with a combination of Shadow Ball and Shadow Sneak. Having a teammate such as Drapion or Spiritomb of your own who can deal with these leads is essential. Ariados is also helpless against the occasional Fire-type lead, such as Arcanine and Moltres, so Milotic or another bulky Water-type partner who can take them on is recommended. Houndoom and other Flash Fire Pokemon can also switch into a predicted Fire-type attack to grab a free boost.</p> <p>As this set's primary purpose is to set up Toxic Spikes, it should be used on a team that appreciates the gradual damage they bring to the table. In general, Toxic Spikes are most useful to stall teams that rely on residual damage to wear down the opposition. Pokemon such as SubRoost Articuno and Wish Clefable can perform their job much more easily when Toxic Spikes are in play, as it frees up a moveslot and allows them to start stalling right away rather than taking a turn to poison the opposing Pokemon first. To ensure that your hazards remain on the field, a bulky Ghost-type such as Spiritomb is recommended to block Rapid Spin. Pokemon with powerful Ground- or Psychic-type attacks are also useful to discourage Poison-types from switching in and absorbing the Toxic Spikes.</p>"

  "Qwilfish": {
    "overview": "<p>Qwilfish is a neat UU Pokemon who can support a team by either taking down opponents by sacrificing itself or attempting a sweep. It doesn't have the power of other Swift Swim sweepers like Kabutops and Gorebyss, but it has plenty in its movepool to offer. Its ability to soak up Toxic Spikes, higher Speed, and access to Explosion are the main things that differentiate it from Kabutops; additionally, it can also beat most Milotic. When rain is up, this is one Pokemon whom you shouldn't underestimate.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic Spikes is an option over Spikes, although in UU, there are many Poison-types who can easily absorb them. There's Endure / Substitute and Flail, but that is better left to Kabutops. Counter is rather gimmicky and should only be used with a Focus Sash, but it could surprise some Pokemon. Anything else of note requires Qwilfish to take a hit or be slow (Revenge, Payback, Gyro Ball), which is definitely not acceptable. Aqua Jet is another option, as priority is very useful in UU, but this makes it generally outclassed by Kabutops, who has a higher Attack stat. Also, Aqua Jet + Swords Dance is an illegal move combination, so this further prevents Qwilfish from using it too effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Quagsire and Toxicroak are effective general counters, as they are immune to Water-type moves because of Water Absorb and Dry Skin, respectively, and both resist Poison-type moves. Walrein, Gastrodon, and Cradily with Earthquake will also be effective, although a +2 rain boosted Waterfall is going to hurt both Cradily and Gastrodon. Most healthy Pokemon with decent defenses will be able to take a hit if they're not weak to Water- or Poison-type attacks. Milotic and Lapras are some examples of such Pokemon, although Milotic will need Hidden Power Electric and Lapras will need Thunderbolt. Furthermore, Qwilfish's Speed is noticeably average, so the non-Rain Dance version can be outsped and hit with strong attacks from Choice item users.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Spikes Lead": {
        "description": "<p>This set's main focus is to set up as many layers of Spikes as possible. With 295 Speed, Qwilfish will often be able to set up at least one layer of Spikes and then explode, ideally against the opponent's Spinner. Waterfall allows Qwilfish to break Focus Sashes before using Explosion and acts as a reliable STAB move. Taunt and Aqua Jet both work well on this set for very different purposes. Taunt allows Qwilfish to reliably stop an opponent from setting up with bulky leads such as Omastar, Cloyster, and Rhyperior. Aqua Jet allows Qwilfish to beat Moltres and Alakazam more reliably. Taunt is recommended because it cannot get Spikes up against Moltres and Alakazam and still beat them, so it's often better to have a reliable switch-in; however, keep in mind that they are both quite difficult to switch into.</p> <p>Qwilfish works well with Pokemon who appreciate Spikes early game. Moltres and Swellow are good examples of effective Spikes abusers because they hit hard without requiring any set up. Qwilfish also works well with bulky Stealth Rock Pokemon that can use Explosion to nail Rapid Spinners. Regirock and Registeel both fill this niche because they can both set up Stealth Rock and explode.</p> <p>Since Qwilfish isn't going to last longer than a few turns, a Ghost-type to block Rapid Spin is required. As far as spinblockers go, Spiritomb is an effective partner because it beats Alakazam and Mismagius, who can Taunt Qwilfish to prevent it from setting up Spikes and beat it with Psychic and Thunderbolt, respectively. Mismagius also works well because it has Taunt to beat Foresight Hitmontop.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>This set plays like a less powerful but slightly faster version of Kabutops. One of the big advantages Qwilfish has over Kabutops is its ability to absorb Toxic Spikes, which can badly hurt your team's ability to sweep. Waterfall is its main attack option, its power boosted by 1.5x by the rain. Poison Jab is its secondary attack to hit Grass- and Water-types that resist Waterfall. Explosion takes out anything that doesn't resist it after a Swords Dance boost. Return is an alternate option for use over Explosion as it can hit Quagsire, Gastrodon, Toxicroak, and other Water- and Poison-type resists without blowing Qwilfish up; however, Explosion's sheer power and ability to blow holes in teams is generally preferred. Qwilfish does well against almost all Milotic thanks to resisting Surf and being neutral to Hidden Power Grass. This is a great asset to Rain Dance teams since Milotic can wall many other rain sweepers.</p> <p>Thanks to Swift Swim, Qwilfish reaches 538 Speed when Rain Dance is up, which outspeeds pretty much everything you will encounter in UU, including all common Choice Scarf users. You could drop its Speed, but it's better to run maximum Speed to Speed tie with other Adamant Qwilfish. Jolly is an alternative nature as outspeeding positive base 80 Speed Pokemon outside the rain, such as Venusaur, which could prove useful; however, the extra power makes Adamant the better option most of the time.</p> <p>Rain Dance is a requirement when using Swords Dance Qwilfish on your team because it doubles Qwilfish's average Speed, as well as giving a 1.5x boost to Qwilfish's STAB Waterfall. Claydol makes a great partner to Qwilfish, immune or resistant to all of its weaknesses, as well as being able to set up both Stealth Rock and Rain Dance. Stealth Rock is definitely suggested because it makes it easier for Qwilfish to deal with Pokemon such as Altaria. Uxie is another Pokemon who can set up Stealth Rock while taking the Ground- and Psychic-type moves commonly directed at Qwilfish. Uxie also has access to Memento, which can help Qwilfish set up a Swords Dance, albeit at the cost of Uxie. Rotom is another great partner, taking the Ground-, Fighting-, and Electric-type moves aimed at Qwilfish while setting up Rain Dance; it can also use Hidden Power Grass to hit Quagsire and Gastrodon, which Qwilfish can do nothing but explode on.</p> <p>Ludicolo is very dangerous in the rain and makes a great partner as it has access to Grass-type moves, which can deal with the bulky Water-types that Qwilfish hates. Although it may seem like a conflict of interests, Kabutops can actually make a nice partner to Qwilfish; they have problems with many of the same Pokemon, so when Qwilfish explodes on Quagsire or Gastrodon, it will open up an opportunity for Kabutops to finish off the opponent's team. Dugtrio can trap and kill Toxicroak; however, it has to be careful when switching in on a Nasty Plot because Toxicroak can OHKO Dugtrio with Vacuum Wave.</p>"
      },
      "Rain Dance Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Qwilfish can make a decent Rain Dance lead. The idea is to set up Rain Dance and attempt a sweep of its own, or to explode Qwilfish on someone and send in your secondary Swift Swim abuser unharmed. Waterfall is Qwilfish's main attack again. Poison Jab is better for sweeping and hits the Grass-type Pokemon who resist Qwilfish's main attack, but Taunt has its uses, too. For example, it can prevent opponents from setting up a Substitute or Stealth Rock or throwing status around, which can harm a team member's chance of sweeping. However, Qwilfish is quite slow, meaning Taunt is only useful against slower, bulkier leads unless rain is up. Explosion is the preferred option in the last slot to go out with a bang, but Destiny Bond can be used instead to force opponents to switch or faint, and due to Rain Dance, Qwilfish will be faster than them.</p> <p>Damp Rock allows for eight turns of rain which are so beneficial and against most leads, you can at least get up Rain Dance. However, with Focus Sash, Qwilfish will always survive a hit and get Rain Dance on the field unless it gets hit with Taunt, inflicted with status, or is up against a Fake Out lead. An EV spread of 252 HP / 92 Def / 166 Spe is another option when using Damp Rock as with the extra HP, you'll be able to take an unboosted Earthquake from Steelix. The Speed EVs enable you to outspeed +1 positive base 100s in the rain, allowing you to Destiny Bond them before they attack.</p> <p>Spikes or Toxic Spikes are other minor options for use in the third slot should you want to utilize entry hazards. An Adamant nature is used to hit as powerfully as possible; however, a Jolly nature is a good alternative as it means that outside the rain Qwilfish will, at worst, Speed tie with opposing Qwilfish and Toxicroak and also outspeed positive base 80s, such as Venusaur. One of the main reasons to use Qwilfish over other Rain Dance leads, such as Electrode and Ambipom, is that you can immediately put the momentum of the match on your side.</p> <p>Obviously, this Qwilfish should only be used on a Rain Dance team, and it therefore needs to be supported by appropriate Pokemon. Ludicolo makes a great offensive partner, taking out the bulky Water-types that Qwilfish hates. If Qwilfish can lure in and explode on Quagsire, Gastrodon, and Toxicroak, Kabutops will have an easier time at a sweep and therefore makes an effective partner. Claydol covers all of Qwilfish's weaknesses and so is a great option for a partner. It can also set up both Stealth Rock and Rain Dance to support the team. Dugtrio is a great partner because it can trap Toxicroak and Chansey, who causes problems for the special sweepers in Rain Dance teams.</p> <p>Qwilfish has a lot of trouble with Ambipom leads, as they can use Fake Out to break Qwilfish's Focus Sash, therefore making Rotom a nice partner to switch into Fake Out, while also being able to set up Rain Dance to support the team. It will have to watch out for Payback, though, which will 2HKO 252/252+ Rotom 98.62% of the time if Ambipom is holding Life Orb. However, Rotom can burn Ambipom with Will-O-Wisp, and since Life Orb isn't too common on Lead Ambipom, Rotom will usually be fine. Uxie has great bulk and makes another good switch into Ambipom, and since U-turn and Payback only do around 25% to 252/252+ Uxie, it shouldn't have too much trouble getting in and setting up both Rain Dance and Stealth Rock to support your team.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Spikes": {
        "description": "<p>Although one of its lesser options, Qwilfish can still make a great Spikes user. The handy thing about Qwilfish is that five of the best Rapid Spinners in UU have trouble switching into it, allowing Qwilfish to set up quite easily. Claydol, Donphan, Sandslash, and Torkoal are all weak to Waterfall, and are therefore unlikely to switch in, while Blastoise has trouble doing any real damage and gets worn down by Poison Jab.</p> <p>Waterfall is the main attacking option for Qwilfish, while Poison Jab helps against Grass-types and certain Flying-types who resist or are immune to Water-type attacks, like Mantine and Altaria. Although Qwilfish doesn't have stellar defenses, it can use Taunt over Poison Jab to stop opponents from setting up. For the last slot, Explosion is the preferred option to go out with a bang, but Destiny Bond is a good alternative and might cause some switching if you reveal it early. Thunder Wave is a minor option, but if your team is slow, it could be helpful, and with the 20% flinch rate of Waterfall, Qwilfish can be an annoyer of sorts. Although Qwilfish may seem outclassed by Omastar as a Spikes user, its access to Explosion, Taunt, and higher Speed are some big things which set it apart from Omastar. It can also soak up Toxic Spikes, which stall teams hate.</p> <p>The EVs are aimed at boosting Qwilfish's Attack while also letting it take hits better, with the rest put in Speed. Poison Point is the preferred ability as the odd chance of poisoning your opponent could prove crucial, and with only 4 EVs in Speed, Qwilfish won't be able to make that good use of Swift Swim anyway. Running an EV spread of 252 HP / 32 SpD / 224 Spe is another option; this outruns Timid Life Orb Milotic and anything slower, though at the cost of Attack. Therefore, this is best when running Spikes, Waterfall, Taunt, and Destiny Bond. A Jolly nature can also be used, with an EV spread of 252 HP / 40 Atk / 216 Spe or just maximum Speed with less HP or Attack. The loss of attack power may hurt at times, but the extra Speed could prove useful as you will outspeed positive base 80s.</p> <p>A Ghost-type Pokemon is a requirement as a partner to this set to stop opponents from Spinning away your Spikes and ruining all of your work. Rotom, Spiritomb, and Mismagius are the best options for that slot. They all have access to Will-O-Wisp and various supporting qualities to cripple your opponents. Perish Song Mismagius can put your opponents in a horrible position: they'll need to switch because of Perish Song, but don't want to because of Spikes. Spiritomb is the most defensive of the three and can handle key threats to Qwilfish, like Toxicroak, the best. Rotom can help your team take hits better with dual screens. Obviously, Qwilfish can do well on stall teams as Spikes are very important to stall teams, so Chansey is a great partner to take special attacks aimed at Qwilfish. Donphan makes a nice partner because it has an immunity to Electric-type moves and can also set up Stealth Rock and use Rapid Spin. Altaria has an immunity to Ground-type moves and can use Toxic to poison the bulky Water-types that cause Qwilfish problems.</p>"

      "Defensive Spikes": {
        "description": "<p>With this set, Qwilfish is able to switch into the majority of Water- and physical Fire-types and defensive Pokemon and easily lay down Spikes. Pain Split lets Qwilfish survive longer and therefore set up more layers of Spikes. Poison Jab is your chosen STAB move as it lets Qwilfish hit other Water-types, such as SubPunch Azumarill (whose Substitute will be broken by it), and with Qwilfish's bulk, it will easily take its hits from Azumarill's common attacks, except for Normal-type attacks. In the last slot, Taunt is the preferred option to stop opponent's from using recovery and also lets Qwilfish easily beat both SubRoost Moltres and Articuno. However, Aqua Jet is a reasonable replacement to revenge kill weakened Blaziken, Dugtrio, and Houndoom.</p> <p>While many people would prefer to use Cloyster or Omastar for Spikes, Qwilfish does have some notable advantages over those three. Firstly, due to its Poison typing, it absorbs Toxic Spikes upon entry, and so stops your team from being slowly weakened by the poison. Because of this, it can also relieve your team of reliance on Aromatherapy or Heal Bell support. This Poison typing also means Qwilfish is immune to Toxic, letting it take on defensive Pokemon such as Chansey better than the aforementioned three Pokemon. Qwilfish also has an easier time setting up against bulky Water-types and can wall most Fire-types. It also can do very well against Stallrein since it can Taunt Walrein and resists Water-type attacks, unlike Omastar and Cloyster.</p> <p>The EVs let Qwilfish take physical hits, neutral Hidden Powers from Pokemon like Milotic, and resisted special hits well. Leftovers is the preferred item since the extra recovery can help Qwilfish stay around longer; however, Shed Shell is a good alternative should you be afraid of Dugtrio trapping Qwilfish. Poison Point is the chosen ability as this set does not aim to sweep in the rain, nor will it take that much advantage from opponents using Rain Dance. Therefore, the chance to poison the opponent is more useful. Impish is the preferred nature as it means Qwilfish will take physical hits better.</p> <p>This set aims to set up Spikes to support your team; therefore, a Ghost-type is very useful to stop your opponent from just spinning away Qwilfish's Spikes. Mismagius, Rotom, and Spiritomb are the best options for this. You can even run two Ghost-types to stop Hitmontop from using Foresight + Rapid Spin to spin away any Spikes Qwilfish sets up. Chansey is a very useful partner as this set has trouble taking strong special hits; however, Chansey takes most easily. Donphan and Venusaur are effective partners to take Electric-type attacks commonly aimed at Qwilfish. Donphan can also set up Stealth Rock to help add to the residual damage.</p> <p>Taunt Ambipom can cause this set a lot of problems by stopping it from setting up Spikes or healing itself. Fake Out + Return, with Stealth Rock support and a bit more prior damage, from Life Orb Ambipom can 2HKO Qwilfish, while Poison Jab from Qwilfish will only at best 2HKO Ambipom in return (with Stealth Rock support). Spiritomb therefore can make an effective partner to deal with Ambipom and has Pursuit, Sucker Punch, and Will-O-Wisp to wear it down. Other Ghost-types such as Spiritomb and Rotom do well if Ambipom lacks Payback, while Rock- and Steel-types can deal with Ambipom if it doesn't pack Low Kick or Grass Knot (the latter only being for the Rock-types).</p> <p>Taunt Drapion is a major nuisance to this set, because Taunt stops Qwilfish from setting up Spikes, using its own Taunt, or using Pain Split. Drapion also resists Poison Jab and has the Defense to easily take Aqua Jet. Dugtrio can trap Drapion and OHKO offensive 4 HP variants with a Jolly Life Orb Earthquake 100% of the time. With Stealth Rock up, Adamant Life Orb Dugtrio will always OHKO 252 HP Drapion, while Jolly Dugtrio requires Stealth Rock and Spikes for the definite OHKO. However, Dugtrio needs both a Choice Band and an Adamant nature if it wants a small chance to OHKO 252/252+ Drapion with Stealth Rock up; Jolly Life Orb variants will manage a 2HKO. The aforementioned Donphan also makes an effective partner to deal with opposing Drapion as it has a high Defense stat to take hits and has a powerful STAB Earthquake that will always OHKO offensive versions of Drapion, assuming Donphan has the usual Adamant nature and 252 Attack EVs. Even the most defensive Drapion is always 2HKOed.</p>"

  "Magcargo": {
    "overview": "<p>Magcargo is usually relegated to NU due to its many shortcomings as a defensive Pokemon, mostly courtesy of its typing. Weaknesses to Stealth Rock and extremely common attacking types such as Water and Ground, an underwhelming set of resistances, and a rather paltry HP stat mean the poor snail doesn't see daylight too often. However, with good all-around defensive stats, a surprisingly good support movepool, and an alternative Rock-typing that serves it well when countering some of the most prominent threats in the UU metagame, Magcargo finds itself in an interesting niche.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Magcargo doesn't have a slew of viable move options outside of those that have been mentioned on its main set. Earth Power attains super effective coverage against Rock- and Poison-types; however, Magcargo must rely on hitting its opponents as they switch in, as most of those Pokemon can outspeed and OHKO it. Explosion can be used if you're willing to go out with a real boom, but won't be doing much more than trashing Magcargo's defensive potential, given its unimpressive Attack.</p> <p>Due to Magcargo's access to Light Screen and Reflect, as well as Memento, a dual screens support set is a possibility; Uxie's able to do that better, however, with fewer exploitable weaknesses and superior Speed. Magcargo also has access to an interesting setup move in Curse, and thus the option of employing a boosting set under sandstorm. Nevertheless, given the high number of weaknesses it bears to common attacking types, this set is usually better left for Pokemon like Cradily. Finally, employing a Choice Specs set is a possibility if you desire to deal some real damage with Magcargo, but other Fire-types such as Magmortar and Moltres tend to do that better with their higher Special Attack stats and superior movepools.</p> <p>Even though Dugtrio is by no means omnipresent, it is the ultimate hindrance to all sorts of defensive sets Magcargo could ever dream of running, thus making Shed Shell a viable option over Leftovers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Just about anything that has decent Special Defense, isn't weak to one of Magcargo's STABs, and bears a move that hits it for super effective damage can be considered a counter. However, every Pokemon that relies on physical attacks to beat it must be careful not to be burned by either Will-O-Wisp, Lava Plume, or Magcargo's Flame Body Ability. Water-types that carry Rest, such as Milotic and Lanturn, are prime examples of counters, being able to switch in on all of Magcargo's attacks with ease, including Specs Hidden Power Grass, and retaliate with Surf. Omastar can make use of its 4x resistance to Fire and decent special bulk to scare Magcargo away and set up multiple entry hazards. However, it won't enjoy being hit by Toxic, Earth Power, or Hidden Power Grass. Claydol, with its naturally high defensive stats, can switch in with ease and proceed to either spin away the Stealth Rock that Magcargo might have set up or hit it hard with Ground-type moves. In addition to that, because Claydol mostly runs special attacks, it can afford the risk of being burned. Clefable literally walls Magcargo for an eternity and can use the opportunity to Calm Mind up, set up Stealth Rock, or just slowly stall it out with Toxic and Soft-Boiled. While Dugtrio risks being burned by Will-O-Wisp or Lava Plume if it directly switches in, it can trap Magcargo and OHKO it with Earthquake.</p>",

      "Defensive Snail": {
        "description": "<p>Magcargo is often overlooked in UU due to its low stats and weaknesses to common attacking types, but it can still fill a respectable niche as a wall. Despite Magcargo's lowly reputation, its respectable 50/120/80 defensive stats allow it to serve as an effective counter for some powerful sweepers. Magcargo's Fire/Rock typing, despite giving it 4x weaknesses to Water- and Ground-type attacks, is very useful, giving it resistances to Flying-, Poison-, and Normal-type attacks while reinforcing its Fire-type resistance. Combined with a usable Special Attack stat and a serviceable support movepool, Magcargo can be a useful niche counter to certain threats while supporting his team.</p> <p>Magcargo is a great switch-in against Normal-types without effective coverage moves, such as Ambipom and Swellow, or those that are Choice-locked into a Normal-type move, such as Choice Band Kangaskhan or Tauros. Magcargo can also comfortably take on and force out dangerous Fire-type sweepers such as Arcanine and Moltres. Lava Plume is the STAB Fire-type attack of choice thanks to its high burn rate, which has the potential to give a Rhyperior or Azumarill switch-in a nasty surprise. Flamethrower may be used in that slot, but Lava Plume is generally preferred since Magcargo is not trying to overpower its counters, so a little extra power does not make a large difference. Hidden Power Rock is Magcargo's strongest option for a secondary STAB move, hitting Fire-types for solid damage. Recover gives Magcargo reliable recovery and allows it to stay healthy through repeated attacks and residual damage. There are a multitude of options for the last slot. Stealth Rock is always useful for residual damage, while Toxic and Will-O-Wisp can be used to spread potentially crippling status ailments among the opposing team. Toxic is great for hitting bulky Water-types looking to switch in for free, such as Milotic, Blastoise, and Slowbro, while Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers such as Rhyperior and Feraligatr.</p> <p>There are many other moves that Magcargo can run in the last slot; Yawn can be used to shuffle your opponent's team, Light Screen and Reflect support your own team, and Refresh helps Magcargo defeat Pokemon who rely on status to damage it, such as specially defensive Arcanine and SubRoost Moltres.</p> <p>The EVs and nature maximize Magcargo's defensive capabilities. 252 HP EVs are necessary to patch up Magcargo's poor base 50 HP, while 252 EVs in Special Defense help it tank special hits. Because Magcargo's Defense stat is still higher than its Special Defense even without EV investment, Bold is the preferred nature; it increases Magcargo's Defense more than Calm would boost Special Defense.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types, especially Milotic, can come in for free on any move except Toxic and immediately threaten Magcargo. Thus, Venusaur makes a great teammate. Bulky pure Grass-types such as Tangrowth or Leafeon have excellent defensive synergy with Magcargo, easily taking the Ground- and Water-type attacks aimed at it. Hippopotas is also a good teammate because it sets up a permanent sandstorm, giving Magcargo a free Special Defense boost. Magcargo becomes extremely hard to take down in a sandstorm, comfortably walling all but the strongest neutral hits and healing with Recover. Magcargo greatly appreciates Rapid Spin support due to its weakness to Stealth Rock and vulnerability to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Claydol is an excellent choice to provide this since it can comfortably take the Rock-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks that trouble Magcargo.</p>"

  "Corsola": {
    "overview": "<p>Corsola is a very poor Pokemon. She has an amazing movepool, but her unfortunate typing and terrible stats result in her being outclassed by the vast majority of UU. She does have some merit as a defensive Pokemon with access to Recover, usable defenses, and Natural Cure as her ability, but if you are in the market for a sturdy defender, there will always be a better option than Corsola.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Due to Corsola's poor stats, she is unable to use her wide movepool, which is a shame as she has some pretty nifty options. Calm Mind can be used alongside Power Gem, Surf, and Earth Power, though Corsola lacks the Speed and power necessary to be effective with such a set. Choice items may be utilized to boost her low attacking stats, but this ultimately restricts her even further. Mirror Coat is available to surprise special attackers, though Corsola isn't likely to survive any sort of hit. Reflect and Light Screen can be used along with Recover, helping Corsola support her teammates. Curse may be used with max Special Defense, though all Grass-types on the opposing team must be eliminated for such a set to succeed. Aqua Ring can be used to restore small amounts of health; however, Recover is much more reliable. Amnesia can raise Corsola's Special Defense, and she also has Rock Polish to boost her Speed. Rock Blast can be used with Hustle, dishing out multiple hits and breaking Focus Sashes, though Hustle lowers its accuracy to a horrible 60%. Endeavor and Sucker Punch are usable with a Focus Sash, but this strategy is unreliable. Finally, Corsola can utilize a Rindo Berry to weaken Grass-type attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Corsola is beaten by almost everything in the game, barring Luvdisc, though Grass-types are the most threatening. Basically, any Pokemon who doesn't mind being poisoned and can hit Corsola super effectively is a counter; bulky Water-types with Hidden Power Grass, Electric-types like Rotom, and Fighting-types like Hariyama are just a few examples.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "I Can Tank Too!": {
        "description": "<p>Corsola generally isn't a Pokemon you'd want to use competitively, but if you choose to do so, this set is her best option. She has usable defensive stats, as well as access to Recover, an important asset that Omastar lacks. Corsola also resists Fire-, Flying-, Ice-, and Normal-type attacks, making her a decent supporter. Stealth Rock and Toxic allow Corsola to support her teammates, while Natural Cure allows Corsola to absorb status moves aimed at her teammates, as it removes any status inflicted on her upon switching out.</p> <p>Corsola can run Explosion with a Relaxed nature to go out with a bang, hopefully removing one of the opposing Pokemon from the game in the process; however, her poor Attack stat means that even Explosion does not deal much damage. Sandstorm support from Hippopotas and max EVs in Special Defense may be helpful to turn Corsola into somewhat of a specially defensive \"tank\"; however, the types she resists are normally physically based, therefore investing in Defense is more suitable to Corsola's typing. Finally, a spinblocker is necessary to prevent Stealth Rock from being removed from the field, making Mismagius and Spiritomb good partners.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types, such as Milotic and Slowbro, cause problems for Corsola, so packing an Electric-type like Magneton or Rotom would be smart. Venusaur and Cacturne are also good teammates, hitting bulky Water-types super effectively or draining their health with Leech Seed. Toxic Spikes are also helpful, slowly wearing down bulky Pokemon with increasing poison damage if you can get both layers down.</p> <p>Fire-types such as Moltres and Arcanine are helpful, as they can blast through Grass-types like Venusaur, who can otherwise cause huge problems for Corsola. RestTalk Arcanine is an excellent choice due to his ability to switch into Sleep Powder with ease. Mixed Blaziken is another excellent choice who is able to destroy both physical and special walls. Finally, Altaria can switch into Grass-type attacks with her 4x resistance and set up with Dragon Dance.</p>"

  "Mantine": {
    "overview": "<p>Mantine's stats are the special equivalent of Skarmory's, which would lead one to think that it's actually good. Unfortunately for Mantine, it's not; its only recovery move is Rest. Mantine has a 4x weakness to Electric-type attacks and a Stealth Rock weakness, not to mention poor Defense and mediocre HP, all of which hamper its ability to function as a bulky Water-type Pokemon. From that, it seems pretty clear that Mantine is inferior to its fellow bulky Water-type Pokemon, Slowbro and Milotic.</p> <p>However, if one looks past the flaws, Mantine has a pretty unique niche. First and foremost, its typing helps it a lot. The secondary Flying typing provides Mantine an invaluable neutrality to Grass-type attacks, allowing it to actually switch into Grass-type Pokemon, unlike Milotic and Slowbro, and even threaten them back with STAB Hidden Power Flying. Flying typing also grants it immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, which most other bulky Waters fear, and a welcome resistance to Fighting-type attacks. Water Absorb, Mantine's ability, which restores 25% of its HP if hit by a Water-type move, is the next big advantage Mantine has. This ability allows Mantine to switch into predicted Water-type moves without fearing Stealth Rock damage. Because of these niche advantages, Mantine is a sturdy special wall who, when used right, can be a great asset to balanced or defensive teams; just keep it away from Thunderbolt.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There really aren't that many other moves to consider. Mantine's most notable option is Signal Beam. There are plenty of Grass- and Psychic-types in UU, so if coverage is what you need, then Signal Beam should be considered, although Surf hits Psychics just as hard. Mantine also gets a few nifty options in Haze and Mirror Coat. A set involving Swift Swim is plausible, but Mantine is terrible at it, not to mention being outclassed by plenty of other Pokemon. Mantine has a plethora of physical moves, but base 40 Attack isn't getting it anywhere.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Lanturn walks all over Mantine as even Hidden Power Grass, which Mantine should not be running anyway, barely scratches it. Other Electric-types such as Manectric and Ampharos destroy it and are capable of taking a hit from Surf. Toxicroak and Qwilfish can set up Swords Dance on Mantine and hit its weak physical defense with Stone Edge or Poison Jab, respectively. Stone Edge Quagsire works well if Mantine lacks Hidden Power Grass. Mismagius absolutely destroys Mantine, no matter the set. Boosting sweepers, Calm Mind Alakazam in particular, can muscle their way past Mantine easily, as Mantine can't do much back. Really, just hit Mantine with your hardest physical moves and it will go down rather quickly.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This set aims to capitalize on Mantine's incredible special bulk. Powerful attacks such as Timid Choice Specs Sceptile's Leaf Storm are a 3HKO at best when factoring the special Attack drop, as is Timid Life Orb Alakazam's Psychic. With this specially defensive set, Mantine can switch into the special Grass-types of UU and hit back with STAB Hidden Power Flying. It also laughs at the special Water-types that lack boosting moves, Electric-type attacks, or Taunt, such as the ever-present Milotic, and any Choice-locked Pokemon stuck on a Water-, Ground-, or special Fire-type move, such as Azumarill, Moltres, and Dugtrio. Mantine can also make a fantastic status absorber for your team because of the RestTalk combination.</p> <p>There are multiple options for your fourth move. Hidden Power Flying is your main attack, receiving STAB and hitting many Pokemon in UU hard; it has the ability to 2HKO Sceptile. Signal Beam hits many Psychic-type Pokemon in UU super effectively, while still hitting the Grass-types for super effective damage. Toxic makes Mantine better at stalling, although running Toxic and Surf in tandem leaves Mantine walled by common UU Pokemon Venusaur, Qwilfish, and Toxicroak.</p> <p>Mantine really needs Rapid Spin support to function optimally, as losing 25% of its HP just by switching in seriously hinders its ability to tank hits. Hitmontop, Donphan, and Claydol all make excellent partners with their Rock-type resistance and ability to Rapid Spin; Claydol and Donphan are also handily immune to Electric-type attacks. Claydol and Donphan can both set up Stealth Rock for your team, while Hitmontop can utilize Foresight and Rapid Spin to guarantee the removal of entry hazards. Hitmontop can also check opposing physical threats exceptionally well with Intimidate. Pokemon with high Defense stats such as Aggron and Steelix, especially the latter due to its Electric-type immunity, make great teammates for Mantine.</p> <p>Mantine loses to most boosting sweepers of any type, especially Calm Mind Alakazam and Swords Dance Venusaur. It also cannot break Azumarill's Substitutes and will accomplish pretty much nothing at all against Lanturn. For these reasons, it's good to not rely solely on Mantine to stop such threats. Backing Mantine up with powerful and fast Grass-type Pokemon like Venusaur and Sceptile is a good idea.</p>"

It also makes a good wall to mixed Blaziken without Thunder Punch or Stone Edge. This set works against stall teams, as with Life Orb it becomes somewhat harder to switch into. You should use this set with caution, however, as it loses much of its massive special bulk when using Life Orb, making it less of a safe switch-in to Venusaur, Sceptile, and Alakazam.</p> <p>Rapid Spin is still very valuable on this set, as Mantine hates losing 1/4 of its HP switching into Stealth Rock. The likes of Hitmontop and Donphan perform this job well. With the different EV spread, Mantine is now 2HKOed by Choice Specs Sceptile's Leaf Storm, in addition to losing walling power over other threats. To help adjust for the lower special bulk, having strong offensive checks for powerful Grass-types, like Swellow and Moltres, is a good idea.</p>"

  "Entei": {
    "overview": "<p>Like many Fire-types, Entei is a Pokemon that boasts great all-around stats but has them distributed rather poorly. The fact that its movepool is horrible doesn't help it either. Even with its access to Extreme Speed, Entei still faces tough competition from Arcanine. However, while Entei appears to be shallow, it still can fill niches that no other Pokemon can. It is the only Pokemon in UU outside of Dunsparce and Drifblim that can set up 101 HP Substitutes and use Calm Mind, making it a deadly special sweeper, while its access to Stone Edge differentiates Entei from Arcanine as a physical attacker.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Entei's movepool is small, so it does not have many other options at its disposal. It is one of the select few Pokemon that have access to Eruption, so running a Choice Specs or Choice Scarf set is not a bad idea, although Typhlosion is better at this in nearly every aspect, boasting the same Speed but higher Special Attack and a wider movepool. Will-O-Wisp is an option that can be used to cripple various Pokemon. Roar can be used as a decent phazing move, while Reflect is also available to boost Entei's Defense.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Haze Milotic is easily Entei's number one counter. With Haze, it can remove Calm Mind boosts and threaten Entei with a full-powered STAB Surf. It also has enough bulk to take whatever attack physical Entei tries to throw at it. Azumarill can take on most specially based sets Entei runs by bypassing Calm Mind, while Slowbro utterly walls any physical set. Blastoise can also switch into most Entei, and specially-based sets can easily be phazed with Roar in a pinch. Clefable shuts down most special Entei with Encore and its good special bulk, while Chansey walls the mixed set and the Sunny Day set to an extent. Pokemon with Flash Fire can defeat any specially attacking set that lacks Stone Edge. Depending on the Hidden Power used, Substitute + Calm Mind Entei will run into trouble against either Rhyperior and Lanturn if it is running Hidden Power Electric, or Fire-types if it is using Hidden Power Grass.</p>",

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to take advantage of Entei's excellent Attack stat and powerful STAB Flare Blitz. At first glance, Arcanine might seem like a better choice for this role, but Entei has higher Attack and Speed than Adamant Arcanine. Entei also has Stone Edge as a coverage move to nail opposing Fire-types for super effective damage, allowing it to OHKO a large portion of its common switch-ins. Entei's Extreme Speed is very powerful and makes for a great late-game sweeping tool. Hidden Power Grass rounds off Entei's coverage by hitting Rhyperior, Kabutops, and Omastar for heavy damage. Entei also has excellent bulk for a Fire-type, meaning it can switch in quite easily on resisted or neutral hits.</p> <p>Life Orb is the preferred item, since it grants Entei a boost in power while still allowing it to switch attacks. However, Choice Band can be used for even more power. With a Choice Band attached, Entei can 2HKO 252 HP / 0 Def Slowking after Stealth Rock damage with Flare Blitz, as well as having a slight chance to 2HKO 252 HP / 200 Def Milotic after Stealth Rock and Spikes damage. Choice Band also allows Entei to OHKO Alakazam with Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock damage, while with Life Orb, this is not guaranteed. There are a few other moves Entei can use in the last slot. Iron Head can be used to hit Rock-types if one wants Entei's moveset to stay physical, while Howl can be used to boost Entei's Attack, enabling it to attempt a sweep.</p> <p>Entei is a hard Pokemon to stop later in the game, but in order to reach that point, Entei requires some support from its teammates. Since Milotic and Slowbro are essentially the only safe switch-ins to Entei, it makes sense to use Pokemon such as SubToxic Azumarill, Swords Dance Kabutops, and Swords Dance Blaziken. If the aforementioned bulky Water-types surprise Entei and switch in, having a Grass-type to take the subsequent Surf is definitely a good idea. Venusaur is an excellent candidate, since it has high Special Defense and can devastate opposing Pokemon with Leaf Storm, Sludge Bomb, and Sleep Powder. Miltank is also a problem, albeit not a common one. Rhyperior makes for a great switch-in for Miltank, as it resists the cow's STAB attacks, doesn't care about paralysis, and can cause major damage to the switch-in. Rhyperior also lures Milotic and deals heavy damage to it with Choice Band or Life Orb-boosted STAB attacks, allowing Entei to finish it off afterwards.</p>"

This allows it set up multiple Calm Mind boosts on Chansey, UU's premier special wall. The idea is very simple: come in on a Pokemon that Entei can force out, create a Substitute as the opponent switches Pokemon, and proceed to set up with Calm Mind. With boosted Special Defense, Entei can even set up on bulky Water-types, with the exceptions of Haze Milotic and Azumarill, set up Substitute, and then eventually take them down. The Hidden Power of choice allows Entei to hit bulky Water-types for super effective damage. Without a good counter, this set can be especially hard for stall teams to face, since Entei can use its bulk to continuously accumulate boosts while the opponent watches in vain.</p> <p>The EVs presented allow Entei to make 101 HP Substitutes while being able to switch into Stealth Rock one additional time. The Speed EVs let Entei outspeed positive-natured base 95 Speed Pokemon such as Houndoom and Arcanine, while the remaining EVs are put into Special Attack to give Entei some power. Hidden Power Rock is also an option should one want Entei to hit other Fire-types super effectively, but Hidden Power Grass and Electric are preferred so Entei can beat bulky Water-types, which otherwise would completely shut this set down.</p> <p>Haze Milotic and Azumarill are easily the best counters to Entei. Blastoise can also take a boosted Hidden Power and Roar Entei away in a pinch. Rhyperior walls Entei if it is running Hidden Power Electric, while Fire-types give Entei trouble if it's utilizing Hidden Power Grass. Clefable with Encore also shuts down Entei quite easily. Due to all of this, Venusaur and Toxicroak are great partners for Entei. Venusaur can easily switch into bulky Water-types and use Sleep Powder or Leaf Storm to pierce holes in the opponent's team, while Toxicroak can switch into Water-types and threaten to set up with Swords Dance or Nasty Plot and sweep. Tangrowth and Milotic are decent checks to Rhyperior, while Milotic can also take on Fire-types. Dugtrio can also trap and KO many Fire-types that give Entei trouble. Since Entei is weak to Stealth Rock, Rapid Spin support is highly beneficial. Hitmontop is possibly the best spinner to run alongside Entei, as it resists Rock-type moves aimed at Entei and is neutral against to Water-type attacks. Blastoise can switch into bulky Water-types and pull off a Rapid Spin. Both Hitmontop and Blastoise can use Foresight and Rapid Spin to guarantee a Rapid Spin against an opposing spinblocker, unless the opponent uses two Ghost-types. Donphan can also be used as a Rapid Spinner; while it can't switch into Water-types, its sheer power allows it to defeat spinblockers more directly by using Earthquake or Head Smash.</p>"

      "Sunny Day": {
        "description": "<p>This set combines Entei's access to Calm Mind and the advantages sunny weather brings to Fire-types. The idea is to switch Entei into a Pokemon it can force out and then set up Calm Mind. If the opponent switches in a bulky Water-type, such as Milotic, Entei should then use Sunny Day to weaken Water-type attacks. In the sun, Milotic's Surf only does 23.18% - 28.03% to +1 Entei, while +1 Solar Beam will easily 2HKO Milotic in return. With the opponent's bulky Water-type destroyed, Entei can then continue to devastate the opponent's team with Calm Mind- and sun-boosted STAB attacks, making Entei extremely hard to wall without the use of Flash Fire Pokemon; in the sun, Entei's +1 Fire Blast is so powerful that it can even 2HKO Chansey after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>If Fire-types such as Moltres and Houndoom are bothersome to you, Stone Edge can be used instead of Calm Mind. Calm Mind is still preferred due to the additional power it grants Entei, though. Should one use this set on a Sunny Day team, Heat Rock is also an option for Entei to support the team more; be aware, however, that Entei itself will lose a great deal of power without Life Orb.</p> <p>Flash Fire Pokemon make Entei's life extremely difficult, especially Arcanine. After a Flash Fire boost, Arcanine's Flare Blitz in the sun will maim pretty much any Pokemon, while Entei cannot hurt Arcanine much in return. When using this set, one should scout out the opponent's team for Flash Fire Pokemon before throwing around Fire-type attacks indiscriminately. Dugtrio can trap and remove Houndoom and Ninetales, while Rhyperior is a decent counter to Arcanine.</p> <p>Since Entei lures in bulky Water-types like moths to a flame, Pokemon that can take advantage of weakened bulky Water-types make for great teammates for Entei. Rock Polish Rhyperior, Dragon Dance Feraligatr, and Choice Band Arcanine can easily devastate the opponent's team once their bulky Water-type has been removed. Rapid Spin support also helps Entei immensely, since it loses 25% of its health every time it switches into Stealth Rock, and with Life Orb equipped, Entei will lose health quickly just to residual damage. Pokemon such as Blastoise and Hitmontop are good choices to provide this.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to take full advantage of Entei's great Speed stat, usable Special Attack stat, and access to Calm Mind. While one might compare Entei to Ninetales (which can utilize Nasty Plot and Energy Ball), Entei has much better bulk and access to Stone Edge, allowing it to deal with Fire-types. Even with an Attack-reducing nature, Stone Edge is still powerful enough to KO most Fire-types. As for Arcanine, if it has Intimidate, Entei should just set up with Calm Mind and attack it with boosted Fire-type attacks; if it has Flash Fire, Stone Edge will always score a 2HKO. Hidden Power Grass allows Entei to hurt Water- and Rock-types that resist Entei's STAB attacks and take little damage from Stone Edge.</p> <p>Like for most offensive UU special attackers, Chansey walls this set. Specially defensive Clefable can also take its hits and use Encore or a status-inducing move to make Entei's life miserable. With Haze, Milotic can erase Special Attack boosts from Calm Mind and defeat Entei relatively easily. Azumarill ignores Entei's Special Defense boosts and deals massive damage with Aqua Jet. Dugtrio pairs quite well with Entei, as it can trap and remove Chansey with Beat Up. Hitmontop and Hitmonlee are also great teammates for Entei, since they can scare away Clefable and Chansey while using Rapid Spin to clear away Stealth Rock. As for Milotic and Azumarill, Venusaur and Toxicroak are excellent switch-ins to them, as Venusaur can cripple opposing Pokemon with its powerful STAB attacks or Sleep Powder, while Toxicroak can easily set up Swords Dance or Nasty Plot and proceed to sweep.</p>"
      },
      "Mono-Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes full advantage of Entei's excellent bulk and access to Calm Mind to become a sturdy mono-attacker. While this set is not very efficient against offensive teams, it is an excellent wincon that can sweep opposing stall teams should its counter go down. With Calm Mind, Entei can eventually boost its Special Attack to the point where it is powerful enough to sweep, while RestTalk stops status afflictions, especially Toxic, from taking it down. Lava Plume complements this set perfectly, as it can potentially burn physical attackers that could bypass Entei's Special Defense boosts, crippling them and rendering them next-to-useless. Entei's ability, Pressure, also helps this set greatly, as it allows Entei to PP stall opposing Pokemon should the occasion arise.</p> <p>There are multiple ways to EV Entei. One can strive for a faster variant with 252 HP / 60 Def / 196 Spe to outspeed Venusaur, but the lost bulk is quite significant. Another way to EV Entei is to utilize a spread of 252 HP / 200 Def / 56 Spe, which enables Entei to outspeed Adamant Absol. Lava Plume is the preferred attack, since it has a better burn rate, but Flamethrower can be used in its place to guarantee a 2HKO on Chansey at +6 (should Entei strike a critical hit).</p> <p>Like most mono-attackers, Entei can be stopped by a lot of Pokemon. Clefable can shut Entei down with Encore, while Haze Milotic removes Entei's Calm Mind boosts. Azumarill and Feraligatr, should they avoid getting burned by Lava Plume, can use Waterfall to deal massive damage to Entei. Trick, Encore, Perish Song, and Curse from a Ghost-type like Spiritomb can all ruin Entei. Rhyperior can switch in with relative safety (though it must beware of a Lava Plume burn) and destroy Entei with Stone Edge or Earthquake. For this reason, Fighting-types such as Hitmontop and Hitmonlee are great partners, as they can easily scare away Clefable and remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin. Choice Band Spiritomb can absorb Trick from most Psychic- and Ghost-types and remove them from the battle by using Pursuit. Venusaur and Toxicroak are good switch-ins to Milotic and Azumarill. A Tangrowth or Milotic of your own can also deal with Feraligatr nicely.</p>"

  "Swellow": {
    "overview": "<p>Swellow is really, really fast. However, Swellow struggles early-game because the omnipresent Steel- and Rock-types can easily force it out and make it take repeated damage from Stealth Rock and potentially its status Orb. It's not all bad news though, the amazing Speed it has enables Swellow to become an excellent sweeper late-game, since it can outrun just about all of UU without a Speed boost. With STAB 140 Base Power Facade and Brave Bird added to the mix, Swellow becomes one of the premier threats in UU. Despite the fact that Swellow's movepool is very limited, it is more than made up for by Swellow's capability to hit hard and fast with what it has.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set consisting of Substitute, Baton Pass, Endeavor, and Return can be used with a pinch Berry of your choice, but this set leaves Swellow utterly exposed to priority moves, and with Return as its only attacking option, Swellow has little hope against Rock- , Ghost-, or Steel-types. Sleep Talk is an option to absorb sleep, but Facade does not get the boost it does from other status conditions, so Return is a more reliable move in this case. Steel Wing is another option to hit Rock-types, but it is too feeble to dent even the least defensive of Rock-types in UU. Roost can be used to replenish health, but Swellow will find little opportunity to use it with its low defensive stats, and will likely lose too much health from Stealth Rock, status, and Brave Bird recoil to make it useful.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As stated before, Swellow is walled by most Rock- and Steel-types. Aggron, Probopass, Steelix, Rhyperior, Relicanth, and Registeel are all good examples of counters. Ghost-types can come in on Normal-type attacks, but switching into Brave Bird will OHKO most of them and 2HKO even Rotom. Priority moves from the likes of Hitmontop, Hitmonlee, Azumarill, and Arcanine combined with residual damage can often KO Swellow thanks to its poor defenses and vulnerability to Stealth Rock. Speaking of Stealth Rock, it is one of the most reliable ways to break Swellow before it can even pose a threat to a team. If you can keep your Swellow hard counter, like Registeel, alive long enough to constantly switch into Swellow, the constant switching or U-turns Swellow suffers will break it simply by residual damage alone. Another good way to deal with Swellow is to pack a super effective attack on a Choice Scarf Pokemon. Rotom is especially useful in this role, as he can take one Brave Bird from Swellow thanks to its resistance to Flying-type attacks and OHKO back with Thunderbolt.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Guts": {
        "description": "<p>This set is designed to take advantage of Swellow's ability, Guts. Swellow is a fearsome sweeper late-game, with excellent Speed and access to strong STAB attacks. Thanks to Toxic Orb, Facade has 140 Base Power STAB attack, while Brave Bird allows you to hit the Ghost-types that Facade cannot. Brave Bird will 2HKO both Spiritomb and Rotom that don't invest heavily in Defense, as well as OHKO Mismagius. Protect is a great move if you decide to use Swellow as a lead or need a guaranteed turn to activate the status Orb late-game. It allows you to activate Guts without any risk and scout with a more powerful U-turn. Quick Attack, however, hits faster Pokemon, such as Electrode or a Choice Scarf Pokemon, and allows Swellow to revenge kill and activate Guts in one fell swoop. Pursuit can be useful for dealing with fleeing Mismagius, Rotom, and Chansey.</p> <p>Toxic Orb does less damage to Swellow for the first two turns it is out, but on the third turn, it is tied with Flame Orb for total damage done. If you think you can keep Swellow in for more than three turns, you'll want to use Flame Orb, otherwise, use Toxic Orb. The EV spread is a simple spread to take advantage of Swellow's highest stats and maximize its ability to sweep.</p> <p>This set is perfect for destroying teams late-game and taking care of the more fragile Pokemon in UU, but it is completely walled by Steel- and Rock-types. Swellow works great alongside Magneton, who can come in on Rock-, Electric-, and Ice-type attacks and trap Steel-types. Fire-types like Blaziken, Houndoom, Arcanine, and Magmortar can also force Steel-types out, but be careful not to switch any of the last three into a Rock-type attack aimed at Swellow. Nidoqueen and Nidoking can also scare away Rock-types with their powerful STAB. Defensively, a good partner to take out Rock-types for Swellow is Hitmontop, whose access to Intimidate will enable it to efficiently take the physical attacks directed at Swellow. Hitmontop also has access to Rapid Spin, which helps Swellow by removing Stealth Rock, thus increasing Swellow's survivability and viability in the late-game. Steel-types can come in on attacks directed at Swellow; perfect candidates for this job would be would be Steelix and Registeel. Steelix has a great typing which enables it to come in comfortably on Rock- and Electric-type attacks. Registeel is another option due to the tremendous bulk it has on both sides. Both of these Steel-types also set up Stealth Rock, which Swellow appreciates as a sweeper. Lastly, Dugtrio is a blessing for Swellow due to its exclusive ability to trap Rock- and Steel-types, and Swellow's U-turn used on the switch can safely bring Dugtrio in to trap and KO the opponent's Swellow check.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>This set forgoes a status Orb for the power of a Life Orb and hope that it can switch in on Toxic or Will-O-Wisp to activate Guts. Swellow's main STAB options are Return and Facade. If you are sure you can come in on a status attack, then Facade is appealing for its higher power output; however, Return is more reliable and has a high Base Power regardless of whether you manage to switch into status or not. For example, Return OHKOes Manectric after Stealth Rock, whereas an unboosted Facade falls short. U-turn is to scout for incoming Steel- and Rock-types so that you can switch to an appropriate counter. Quick Attack is preferred in the last slot to hit Choice Scarf users, but Pursuit can be used to trap weakened Mismagius, Rotom, and Chansey.</p> <p>This set is walled by Steel- and Rock-types. Magneton traps Steel-types, while Fighting-types like Hitmontop threaten both Steel- and Rock-types, often causing them to switch out. Fire-types can also come in and force Steel-types to switch out, but double up on Swellow's Rock-type weakness. Blaziken is a good candidate because it has access to both STAB Fire- and Fighting-type moves to scare away Swellow's counters. Dugtrio can remove Steel- and Rock-types early in the match, allowing Swellow to sweep without issue later on.</p>"

  "Pelipper": {
    "overview": "<p>As you might expect of such a ubiquitous Pokemon in-game, Pelipper is not particularly amazing. However, while many of such common Pokemon are usually extremely lackluster, Pelipper is surprisingly decent. His rare typing gives him access to a fantastic STAB combination that's only resisted by Lanturn in UU and a slew of interesting resistances that allow him to check a few common Pokemon in the UU metagame. Additionally, his stats, while not top-notch, are not really poor; a great Defense stat and passable Special Attack give him the ability to be a decent tank. He also has access to all the right moves that allow him to perform his role well. All in all, while Pelipper may seem like another mediocre Water-type that's outclassed by bulkier alternatives such as Milotic, Pelipper has more than enough unique traits to distinguish himself from them and is still somewhat competitively viable.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Pelipper has a movepool that's fairly large, and as such, there are plenty of other options to choose from. Offensively, Pelipper boasts a surprisingly large physical movepool; powerful moves such as Gunk Shot, Seed Bomb, U-turn, Payback, and Fly are usable with a Life Orb or Choice Band. However, Pelipper's lack of strong physical STAB options and poor Attack stat make this a lackluster choice. While Ice Beam may seem like an appetizing option on special sets, it's usually a poor choice since Pelipper can use STAB Air Slash to hit most of the things that Ice Beam is designed to hit. Pelipper also has the option of using Choice Specs or Choice Scarf, but Pelipper's weakness to Stealth Rock undermines this option. Also, Pelipper has more success abusing his great coverage with his STABs, so he prefers the ability to switch attacks. Pelipper also has access to two boosting moves in Stockpile and Agility. Agility allows Pelipper to act as a decent late-game cleaner, and while Pelipper isn't nearly as effective in that role as other Pokemon, he still does a respectable job at it. Stockpile gives Pelipper a way to boost his excellent Defense and mediocre Special Defense; however, even after one boost, Pelipper's Special Defense isn't good enough to take most reasonably powerful special attacks. Finally, Knock Off is an option to remove opposing Pokemon of their items, but it's typically a wasted moveslot since Pelipper has much better options to use.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Despite Pelipper's excellent type coverage, he is unfortunately hindered by his average Special Attack. This makes it so that most special walls will have no problems taking his attacks and crippling him with a status ailment, or simply just forcing him out, which can cause Pelipper to have to take Stealth Rock damage when he switches in again. In addition to this, bulky Water-types don't really mind any of his attacks, bar the rare Toxic, and will eventually stall him out, even if they don't have Toxic themselves. Lanturn is by far the most effective bulky Water-type, boasting a resistance to both of Pelipper's STAB moves and a STAB Thunderbolt that can dispatch Pelipper with ease. While Pelipper has a great Defense stat, his Special Defense is lackluster, so any Pokemon who can target his lesser defensive stat can threaten him. Rotom is particularly effective due to its ability to block Pelipper's teammates from Rapid Spinning, in addition to posing a huge threat to him with a lethal STAB Thunderbolt. Pelipper's low Speed is also a hinderance, as it makes it extremely easy to revenge kill him. Finally, Stealth Rock is a huge obstacle for Pelipper, as the loss of 25% of his health each time he switches in can make it extremely difficult for him to switch in.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>Boasting a respectable Special Attack stat and a fantastic STAB combo that hits everything in UU neutrally barring Lanturn, Pelipper becomes a strong user of a Life Orb. Additionally, Pelipper is a fairly bulky user of the item, as he has plenty of resistances to switch in on, great physical Defense, and Roost, all of which allow him to switch in multiple times and wreck the opposing team with powerful attacks. While his Speed and Special Attack stat are not quite up to par with some of his fellow Water-types, the aforementioned traits allow him to stand out amongst the crowd and give him competitive viability.</p> <p>After a STAB and Life Orb boost, Hydro Pump hits fairly hard, especially coming off of Pelipper's maxed out Special Attack stat. Additionally, it has fantastic neutral coverage, only resisted by Grass-, Water-, and Dragon-types, the last of which are rare in UU. Air Slash covers the Grass-types that resist Hydro Pump, and forms a strong neutral attacking combination alongside it. If your opponent happens to have both a Water- and Grass-type on their team, Air Slash is also a decent option to nail either for respectable damage. Roost gives Pelipper some extra longevity by allowing him to shrug off damage from Stealth Rock, Life Orb recoil, and resisted or weak neutral attacks. Hidden Power Grass nails Water-types for decent damage. While it certainly won't do enough to KO healthy bulky Water-types, it is more than capable of KOing weakened ones. Surf is an option over Hydro Pump if you're wary of its low accuracy and PP, but using Surf results in a massive loss of power.</p> <p>This EV spread is finely tuned to fit Pelipper's purpose. A Modest nature, in tandem with maximum EV investment in Special Attack, gives Pelipper as much force behind his attacks as possible, which is appreciated due to Pelipper's middling Special Attack stat. 212 Speed EVs allow Pelipper to outspeed max Speed Aggron, who Pelipper can then dispose of with ease. However, you can also decrease the amount of Speed EVs if you find that giving Pelipper more bulk is better. For example, 136 Speed EVs is just enough to outspeed Adamant Aggron, and the rest can be poured into HP (though Pelipper still needs to run max Special Attack). 40 HP EV make Pelipper slightly bulkier, and they give Pelipper an odd HP stat. Finally, the 4 remaining EVs are dumped into Pelipper's Defense stat since Pelipper tends to enjoy switching into physical attacks more than special attacks, and so Pelipper doesn't take more damage from Life Orb recoil.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is a particularly annoying problem for Pelipper; although he does have an instant recovery move, the 25% health lost from Stealth Rock, Life Orb recoil, and damage from light attacks will quickly add up and hinder him. Therefore, Rapid Spinners are extremely useful. Donphan is a good choice due to his powerful attacks and ability to hit Ghost-types with Assurance. Furthermore, Donphan can help Pelipper deal with Registeel and Chansey by hitting them with strong Earthquakes on their weaker defensive stat. Hitmontop is also a decent option due to his ability to guarantee a Rapid Spin with Foresight, and hit the aforementioned walls with super effective Fighting-type STAB attacks.</p> <p>The main counters to Pelipper reside in bulky Water-types and special walls such as Clefable, Chansey, and Registeel. Bulky Water-types can take everything that Pelipper throws at them with relative ease, bar Hidden Power Grass, and can stall him out with Toxic, while special walls can have no issues switching into Pelipper's special attacks off his just barely above average Special Attack. The former can be dealt with by Grass-types such as Venusaur and Leafeon, who can strike these Water-types for strong, super effective damage, though Venusaur and Leafeon won't enjoy continually switching into Ice Beams. However, the latter are much harder to deal with, as Clefable, Registeel, and Chansey all possess the means to cripple any Pokemon that dares to switch into them with Thunder Wave. Despite this, there are a few Pokemon that can hit these Pokemon on their weaker defensive stats to do massive damage, while not fearing Thunder Wave. Rhyperior and Donphan are two prime candidates for this job, boasting incredible Attack stats which can easily muscle through these walls, as well as an immunity to Thunder Wave due to their Ground typing. Dugtrio can also be used to guarantee that these Pokemon will be removed thanks to Arena Trap, though he will only be able to KO weakened variants.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Wall": {
        "description": "<p>Pelipper is blessed with an excellent Defense stat, an interesting typing, and a reliable recovery move in Roost, which all assist him in acting as a check to multiple Pokemon in the UU metagame. These include prominent Pokemon such as Arcanine, Leafeon, Donphan, and Azumarill. Though these Pokemon can pack attacks that can dispose of Pelipper (Arcanine can carry Thunder Fang, for example), they typically won't have them, which makes him a decent answer to such Pokemon. Surf is Pelipper's obligatory STAB move, and its ability to hit many important threats such as Donphan and Arcanine is appreciated. Air Slash complements Surf well, and broadens the field of opponents that Pelipper can successfully check by hitting Pokemon that Surf fails to strike for strong enough damage, such as Leafeon and Hitmontop. Roost greatly increases Pelipper's overall longevity, and its secondary effect of removing Pelipper's Flying typing can be greatly appreciated against some foes. Hidden Power Grass rounds off the set by smacking physical Water-types such as Feraligatr and Azumarill for super effective damage. However, Toxic is a respectable option to deal with bulkier Pokemon such as Milotic, and it's Pelipper's best option against foes he can't touch, such as Rotom. If Toxic is used, it's recommended to replace Air Slash with Hidden Power Grass, as Pelipper has more success checking physical Water-types than Fighting-types since they will usually carry a devastating Stone Edge that Pelipper will have trouble taking.</p> <p>The Speed EVs on this set give Pelipper just enough Speed to outspeed Adamant Rhyperior, and the rest are dumped into HP and Defense to bolster Pelipper's defenses. While more Speed EVs can be used to outspeed foes such as Jolly Rhyperior or even Jolly Aggron, it's usually a poor choice to do so; with the given EVs in Pelipper's Defense, he barely has enough Defense to survive some heavy physical assaults anyway. However, it should be noted that by investing more EVs into Speed, Pelipper will have more opportunities to abuse Roost to prevent himself getting hit super effectively by strong Rock-type moves. Similarly, while a more specially-oriented spread is plausible, taking away more Defense EVs will simply make Pelipper a less reliable check to many physical sweepers, such as Leafeon. To demonstrate Pelipper's physical bulk with the given amount of defensive investment, here are some damage calculations:</p> <ul> <li>252 Adamant Life Orb Arcanine Flare Blitz vs. Pelipper: 28.8% - 34.4%</li> <li>252 Adamant Choice Band Azumarill Waterfall vs. Pelipper: 27.6% - 32.5%</li> <li>252 Adamant Choice Band Azumarill Return vs. Pelipper: 47.1% - 55.4%</li> <li>252 Adamant Choice Scarf Hitmonlee Close Combat vs. Pelipper: 23.5% - 27.9%</li> <li>252 Adamant Choice Scarf Hitmonlee Stone Edge vs. Pelipper: 52.6% - 62.5%</li> <li>252 Jolly Life Orb Hitmonlee Close Combat vs. Pelipper: 27.9% - 33.1%</li> <li>252 Jolly Life Orb Hitmonlee Stone Edge vs. Pelipper: 62.5% - 73.7%</li> <li>252 Adamant Life Orb Hitmontop Stone Edge vs. Pelipper: 58.2% - 68.7%</li> <li>252 Adamant Toxicroak Stone Edge vs. Pelipper: 48.9% - 57.6%</li> <li>252 Jolly Life Orb Leafeon +2 Leaf Blade vs. Pelipper: 78.7% - 92.9%</li> <li>252 Adamant Donphan Stone Edge vs. Pelipper: 52.6% - 62.5%</li> <li>252 Adamant Choice Band Donphan Stone Edge vs. Pelipper: 79.3% - 93.5%</li> </ul> <p>Important to note is the fact that Pelipper needs to switch into many of these Pokemon with little or no prior damage, as he barely has enough Defense to take on many of these Pokemon at full health. For example, against Leafeon, Pelipper can survive a +2 Leaf Blade and KO back with Air Slash, but with Stealth Rock, Pelipper is always KOed. This means that Pelipper appreciates two main things: Wish and cleric support, and Rapid Spin. Wish and cleric support can be provided by the likes of Clefable and Chansey, who are both exceedingly bulky and enjoy Pelipper's ability to take on Fighting-types who will give them issues. Also, both of these Pokemon can take hits from specially offensive threats who plague Pelipper. Good Rapid Spin users can be found in Hitmontop and Donphan, who possess sizable strength and a way to deal with Ghost-type Pokemon who may try to block their spin.</p>"

  "Masquerain": {
    "overview": "<p>Masquerain looks like yet another generic Bug- and Flying-type Pokemon, but it has a few tricks up its sleeve that might surprise you. It distinguishes itself from other Pokemon with identical typing by its somewhat superior special movepool, which includes two attacks that are more commonly seen on Water-types--Hydro Pump and Ice Beam--as well as an excellent ability in Intimidate. Intimidate is very helpful, since it allows Masquerain to switch into a slew of physical moves that it wouldn't be able to handle otherwise, despite Masquerain's poor defenses. Hydro Pump and Air Slash together hit every Pokemon in UU neutrally except for Lanturn.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Masquerain is still a mediocre Pokemon, as its horrendous typing and stats hold it back from doing much at all. Being 4x weak to Stealth Rock hinders the usefulness of Intimidate, while its low Speed and Special Attack make its excellent two-move coverage in Hydro Pump and Air Slash not as great as it could be. All in all, Masquerain is a fairly unique Pokemon that, despite horrible, crippling flaws, can be quite useful to your team through proper support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Masquerain's movepool is quite good, and contains quite a few decent special attacking options that can be used instead of Hydro Pump. Energy Ball, Shadow Ball, Hidden Power Ground or Fighting, Ice Beam, and even Blizzard can be useful in assorted scenarios. However, they provide mostly redundant coverage with Air Slash and Hydro Pump. Silver Wind or Ominous Wind can be used if you think you can get lucky with their secondary effect, but they are generally too luck based to be used.</p> <p>Masquerain is capable of using a more defensive set that utilizes Stun Spore and Air Slash alongside Roost, but Masquerain is often too frail or too weak to use it effectively. Haze is an interesting option to remove stat boosts, but Masquerain's poor defenses prevent it from effectively countering stat-boosting threats. Masquerain can use Rain Dance, since its Hydro Pump benefits from the rain, but Masquerain doesn't really have amazing synergy with rain sweepers aside from resisting Grass-type attacks, and it can't use it well due to its poor defenses.</p> <p>Finally, Masquerain can use Choice Specs or Choice Scarf to boost either its Special Attack or its Speed, respectively. Masquerian becomes quite strong after a Choice Specs boost, and with two very good attacks to spam in Hydro Pump and Air Slash, it can be a decent threat. Sadly, being 4x weak to Stealth Rock, having few good immunities and resistances to switch in on, and a low base Speed stat makes Choice Specs a mediocre option. Choice Scarf can make Masquerain fast enough to outspeed some Pokemon, but with only a base 80 Special Attack to fall back on, Masquerain is generally too weak, and many of the issues a Choice Specs set would have are present here as well.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The bane of Masquerain's existence, like every other Pokemon that is 4x weak to Rock, is Stealth Rock. With Stealth Rock chipping off 50% of its HP every time it switches in, Masquerain will have little chance of switching in successfully. Keeping Stealth Rock on the field will result in Masquerain being mostly dead weight on your opponent's team.</p> <p>If, for some reason, Stealth Rock is not on the field, Masquerain can prove to be quite a nuisance. To counter Masquerain, any reasonably specially bulky Pokemon will do, such as Registeel, Chansey, Clefable, and Milotic. It is also noteworthy that the first three can set up Stealth Rock to hamper Masquerain, and can use Thunder Wave to nail any potential Baton Pass recipients. However, these Pokemon aren't a guaranteed stop to Masquerain, since it can easily Baton Pass to a Ground-type such as Rhyperior or Torterra to absorb the Thunder Wave, and that Speed-boosted teammate could then easily rip through your team. Because of this, the best counter to Masquerain is Haze Milotic. Haze Milotic doesn't care about Masquerain's weak attacks, and can easily remove any Agility boosts that it tries to Baton Pass.</p> <p>Bulky Pokemon that use Substitute can be a nuisance to Masquerain. If the Pokemon uses Substitute as it Baton Passes, the Pokemon behind the Substitute can react easily to the Baton Pass recipient. Mismagius and Rotom are good choices for this strategy, as Rotom will often scare Masquerain off with the threat of Choice Scarf Thunderbolt, while Mismagius is fairly bulky, and after a Calm Mind, Masquerain will be hard-pressed to break its Substitutes.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Agility": {
        "description": "<p>Speed is often an issue that plagues Masquerain. Base 60 Speed is quite low, and because of this, Masquerain cannot normally sweep very well at all. Fortunately, Masquerain can utilize Agility to substantially help its chances of ripping through the opposing team. Even if Masquerain cannot plow through defensive Pokemon due to its low Special Attack, it can still prove to be an excellent member of the team due to its ability to Baton Pass Agility boosts.</p> <p>Agility allows Masquerain to reach a very respectable Speed so it can attempt a sweep. Thanks to Intimidate, it isn't too difficult to use Agility either. Air Slash is for STAB and good coverage, while Hydro Pump complements Air Slash to form an excellent attack combination that hits almost everything in UU neutrally. Roost can be used instead of Hydro Pump if you wish to give Masquerain some longevity, but even with Intimidate, Masquerain isn't that bulky. In the last slot, Baton Pass is recommended since Masquerain will often lack enough power to muscle through Pokemon that wall it, such as Milotic, Registeel, and Chansey, so instead, Masquerain can pass the boosts to a teammate to allow it to sweep.</p> <p>The choice between a Modest and a Timid nature is a tough one. Timid allows Masquerain to outspeed Jolly Torterra before Agility, and Choice Scarf Rotom after Agility. Jolly Torterra is important to outpace because Masquerain can 2HKO it before it can smash Masquerain with Stone Edge. Torterra can also be a pain for Masquerain's desired Baton Pass recipients, namely Aggron and Rhyperior. Outspeeding Choice Scarf Rotom allows Masquerain to Baton Pass the Agility before Rotom can strike Masquerain with a lethal Thunderbolt. However, one shouldn't discount a Modest nature immediately. A Modest nature will provide a much needed power boost for Masquerain's low Special Attack and secures many KOs and 2HKOs that Timid Masquerain would be otherwise unable to obtain. For example, against Arcanine, Hydro Pump from a Modest Masquerain is likely to KO Arcanine after Stealth Rock damage, while Timid will rarely KO.</p> <p>Since Masquerain has both Agility and Baton Pass, any Pokemon that enjoys having +2 Speed is a great partner for it. Rhyperior, Aggron, and Torterra are all powerful and slow behemoths in need of a boost, and therefore make excellent recipients. Conveniently, Masquerain can deal with Donphan, Hitmontop, and opposing Torterra, which all wall Rhyperior and Aggron. Torterra is a good Baton Pass recipient because it can deal with most of the Pokemon that wall Masquerain, such as Registeel, Milotic, and Chansey. It should be noted that it is fairly safe for Masquerain to Baton Pass out of all of these Pokemon except for Milotic, as it can use Ice Beam to nail Torterra as it comes in. Alternatively, a Swords Dance Venusaur can be used to beat out the three aforementioned walls, since it's quite bulky and can hit two of these Pokemon with a super effective attack; however, it is quite prone to Thunder Wave from Registeel and Chansey.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Normalize really is an interesting and unique ability, and it's only found on Delcatty and its pre-evolution Skitty. The problem with it though is that Normal attacks are already the go-to moves for generic high damage and interesting effects. Delcatty can do all sorts of things for less than average damage, though its support pool is about as good as it gets, between Sing, Thunder Wave, Heal Bell, AND Wish. It's not even listed but you have a moveset right there. If you're using Delcatty, note that you only have the first few turns for Delcatty to surprise anything, and once its moveset and true motives are discovered, it will be a lot harder to use.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Delcatty learns an absurd number of good moves that it cannot use that well due to low statistics. To give you an idea, Delcatty learns Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, Shadow Ball, Zen Headbutt and Grass Knot. The only times Delcatty should be using any of these moves is if turns out that an opponent's Pokemon is 4x weak to it. Delcatty also learns Copycat which acts like a better Mirror Move, and the ever-reliable Toxic. It can also Psych Up stat boosts and Baton Pass them away, though the fact that the opponent still has those boosts will be a huge problem.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>In the upper tiers, Delcatty is countered by everything and its mother with the possible exception of Dugtrio. Outside of that venue of quick and painful death, Delcatty will have to deal with Persian and Hitmonlee whose Limber trait renders Thunder Wave useless. Aggron, Bastiodon, and Probopass's 4x resistance to Normal attacks will also completely neutralize any sort of offense that Delcatty tries to mount. The moves Taunt and Substitute in general will also end Delcatty's dreams of the big leagues. In the lowest tiers, it doesn't have any particular weaknesses, but it doesn't have any particular strengths either.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Baton Pass": {"description": "<p>This (or a variation of this) is likely going to be the most common form of Delcatty you will see, as Delcatty's best and most sensible moves lean it in the direction of Baton Passing. It's already a very frail Pokemon though, so don't get your hopes up. It can function as a Special Attack boost passer or as a Wish passer.</p> <p>Delcatty can also go for no attacks whatsoever, but beware of Substitute and Taunt.</p>"},
      "Normalize": {
        "description": "<p>Normalize is an unusual ability which turns all of Delcatty's moves into Normal-type attacks, and for the most part this ability is a huge disadvantage as it kills any sort of type coverage Delcatty may offer. Fortunately or unfortunately, Delcatty isn't exactly a champ when it comes to offense, so it's not a huge loss. The main thrust of this set is the Normalize Thunder Wave, which trades its Ground immunity for a Ghost one. Watch as Dugtrio recoils in shock and horror as it waltzes right into a Thunder Wave. Ghosts walk all over this set, so Sing is your only unreliable counter-measure against one. Use the switches caused by Thunder Wave and Sing to find opportunities to use Heal Bell, or use Baton Pass to scout for those switches and send in a better Pokemon for the job. Wish is for some convenient team healing.</p> <p>In terms of offense, the real problem with Normalize is that the Normal type already has on average some of the strongest and most reliable attacks in the game, so turning other attacks into Normal-type attacks doesn't really help. That said, STAB Sucker Punches can deal some damage and spook faster Pokemon. Actually, this set works fine with Cute Charm too. Delcatty is using Normalize just to show some of the options available to it when it does.</p>"

  "Volbeat": {
    "overview": "<p>At a glance, Volbeat is the epitome of many things you would expect of the average Bug-type; poor stats and a mediocre movepool alongside insubstantial abilities are just some of the things that he has in common with fellow Pokemon of his type. However, this little firefly does possess a few interesting qualities that set him apart from his brethren. Notably, he has access to the rare combination of a +2 Special Attack-boosting move and Baton Pass, and though he's outclassed by other users of the combination, such as Plusle and Minun for the most part, he can be a decent user of it. Furthermore, he is the only Bug-type bar Shedinja who can use Trick, which gives him a unique niche as a Bug-type Choice item user. Overall, don't expect Volbeat to be amazing; he is almost always outclassed in whatever role he plays, but can be an interesting and useful team member when used correctly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Volbeat's movepool is marginally larger than other Bug-types, though this isn't really saying much. For offensive options, Volbeat's special movepool consists of useful and interesting moves such as Thunderbolt, Giga Drain, Shadow Ball, Water Pulse, Charge Beam, and Hidden Power, which can be used alongside Tail Glow, though they'll still be depressingly weak even after a boost. Physically, Volbeat's movepool is barren, with only Double-Edge and Focus Punch as noteworthy options. While both of these attacks have their merits; the former in having an attack that has great neutral coverage, and the latter in hitting Steel-types extremely hard, both typically aren't worth using. In the support department, Volbeat has a few useful options such as Confuse Ray and Thunder Wave, which can be utilized to form the irritating ParaFusion strategy, Roost, which can heal Volbeat, as well as Rain Dance and Sunny Day for weather support. However, due to Volbeat's poor defenses, these options are usually better used by another Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Poor defenses, a barely above-average Speed, weak offensive stats, and a truckload of weaknesses all combine to make Volbeat an easy Pokemon to defeat. Most Pokemon that can outspeed Volbeat will typically be able to KO or at least severely damage him; notable examples include Swellow, Scyther, and Moltres, and they can also take most of Volbeat's attacks with ease. Bulky Pokemon also do well due to Volbeat's mediocre offenses. Rhyperior, Aggron, and Donphan are superb choices, possessing the ability to smash Volbeat's lights out with ridiculously strong attacks. Milotic is a fine choice as well, and her access to Haze allows her to be a surefire counter against any Volbeat set. Finally, Stealth Rock is a huge thorn in this firefly's side, as Volbeat is simply too frail to switch into any attack after Stealth Rock has chipped 25% of its health away.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>The ability to Baton Pass +2 Special Attack is a rare and coveted ability, and Volbeat is undeniably blessed to have it. While Volbeat is easily a lesser choice for this role, being outclassed by other users of the combination, such as Plusle and Minun, he is nonetheless a respectable option. However, it is hard to deny that Volbeat has a harder time fitting on teams than his fellow Baton Pass users, having poor defenses and a slew of common weaknesses. Volbeat's only real advantages lie in his resistances to Grass-, Ground-, and Fighting-type attacks and his access to Encore. Fortunately, Encore does give Volbeat a means to circumvent his poor defenses, as with the ability to lock an offensively inept Pokemon such as Registeel into a support move, Volbeat gains a slew of new opportunities to set up. Substitute is also fairly helpful in this regard; not only does it prevent Volbeat from being struck by status and provide a cushion for Volbeat, it can also be Baton Passed to another teammate. Bug Buzz can be used if you fear Taunt, but it will typically do pitiful damage against most foes due to Volbeat's pathetic Special Attack.</p> <p>This EV spread is designed to boost Volbeat's defensive abilities as much as possible, while keeping his Speed maxed to allow him to tie with other max Speed base 85s. However, should Bug Buzz be used, you may shift Volbeat's HP EVs into Special Attack to make him stronger. You may opt to use a Salac Berry to give an additional Speed boost to Baton Pass; Substitute is recommended if you go down that road to consistently bring Volbeat down to the 25% range. With Substitute, Bug Buzz, Swarm, and a Salac Berry, Volbeat can attempt to sweep with Swarm-boosted Bug Buzz with at least +2 Special Attack and +1 Speed, even with this setup though, Volbeat is still incredibly prone to priority attacks.</p> <p>Due to the fact that this set revolves around Baton Passing Tail Glow boosts, appropriate Baton Pass recipients are necessary. Unfortunately, due to the copious amount of weaknesses Volbeat possesses, it's difficult to find a recipient who shares few weaknesses with him. Blaziken and Lanturn are arguably the best recipients for this reason; despite being somewhat slow, they boast a means to boost their Speed stat via Agility, and have great type coverage in their STAB moves. Lanturn also has the ability to defeat Milotic, who can otherwise pose an issue for Volbeat with Haze. However, if you aren't too afraid of synergy issues, receivers such as Espeon, Alakazam, Moltres, Mismagius, Rotom, Sceptile, and other such specially-oriented Pokemon are good choices as well.</p> <p>To deal with special sponges such as Chansey that may give Volbeat and his recipient grief, strong physical attackers such as Rhyperior, Aggron, and Donphan are recommended; they are also helpful for weakening the opposing team via their brutally strong attacks. Furthermore, Donphan can utilize Rapid Spin to prevent Volbeat and the Baton Pass recipient from taking damage from entry hazards. Dugtrio can also be used as a means to guarantee the removal of special sponges, but he can only remove weakened variants due to his mediocre offenses.</p>"
      },
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>While Volbeat's offenses, physical movepool, and Speed are decidedly mediocre, he has one saving grace in his access to Trick, which gives him a slight niche as a Bug-type Choice item user. This, in tandem with U-turn's ability to scout the opposing team, can make Volbeat tricky to play around, since defensive Pokemon will be crippled by Trick, and offensive Pokemon will take a chunk of damage from U-turn. Furthermore, U-turn will help keep momentum in your favor, as well as doing somewhat respectable damage, despite Volbeat's poor Attack stat, and it's Volbeat's strongest STAB option. Brick Break nails Steel-types such as Registeel and Aggron, and with a Choice Scarf, Volbeat can outspeed +2 Adamant Aggron and do hefty damage to it. Zen Headbutt complements Brick Break and U-turn's coverage by hitting Poison-types who resist them for super effective damage, as well as offering neutral coverage on Ghost-types who take minute damage from U-turn and are immune to Brick Break. Alternatively, Ice Punch and Thunder Punch are options to hit other specific foes -- Flying-types, in particular -- for super effective damage, though they don't hit as many important foes as Zen Headbutt does. Quick Attack is also usable as a form of priority, but it is pitifully weak.</p> <p>Depending on which item was utilized in the last slot, an appropriate nature must be chosen. Usually, with a Choice Scarf, an Adamant nature will suffice, since this allows Volbeat to outspeed the entire unboosted UU metagame bar Electrode; however, this does mean Volbeat misses out on beating Choice Scarf users with maximum Speed investment and base 80 Speed, which may pose an issue. Therefore, you must decide whether or not these Pokemon are a big enough issue to sacrifice the much needed power boost that Adamant provides in favor of the ability to possibly revenge kill them. If Choice Band is used, a Jolly nature is a must to outspeed max Speed Base 80s, as well as tie with other max Speed Base 85s.</p> <p>Because Volbeat is simply very weak, even with a boost from a Choice Band, bulky Pokemon tend to be highly annoying. Dugtrio and entry hazards are useful for this reason; Dugtrio can trap weakened walls such as Registeel, whereas entry hazards can slowly wear bulky Pokemon down. Omastar makes an excellent candidate for setting up hazards, with great overall defenses to continually set up throughout the match. With the combination of entry hazards and Volbeat's U-turns, the opponent will find themselves weakening extremely fast. As such, powerhouses who can finish off the opposing team work well alongside Volbeat; Moltres, Alakazam, and Aggron are prime examples, boasting extremely strong attacks to muscle through the opposing team. However, on the flip side, entry hazards are detrimental to Volbeat as he will attempt to switch in and out multiple times during the match, and entry hazards hinder this endeavor greatly. As such, Rapid Spin users such as Hitmontop, Blastoise, and Donphan are good partners.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>While Illumise appears terrible on paper, she does have a few perks that allow her to compete in UU; her biggest advantage is Tinted Lens, which allows any resisted attacks to hit for neutral damage. While it appears that Illumise is outclassed by Venomoth, her superior movepool, which includes moves such as Encore, Wish, and Baton Pass, allows her to differentiate herself from her moth cousin. Given some team support, Illumise could be a reasonable alternative to some of the other Pokemon running around UU; just don't expect anything amazing out of her.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Illumise has a decent movepool, so a few other options can be considered. Growth is useful on the special sweeper set to boost Illumise's Special Attack. Illumise has access to many modes of recovery, namely Roost and Moonlight, as well as Wish, but her lack of bulk really prevents her from abusing these to their fullest potential. If you feel like taking a chance, Silver Wind can replace Bug Buzz on the Baton Pass set, as it has a 10% chance of passing a +1 boost in every stat to the recipient.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Essentially, a Pokemon who has a good Special Defense stat and is not weak to any of Illumise's attacks can be considered a counter. Chansey and Registeel completely wall Illumise, while specially defensive Arcanine can switch in without too much hassle and roast Illumise to a crisp with Flare Blitz. Altaria can switch in, Roost off any damage taken, and proceed to set up Dragon Dance. Toxicroak resists Bug Buzz and can set up on Illumise should she lack Hidden Power Ground. Illumise is also easily revenge killed; Pokemon such as Scyther, Houndoom, and Moltres can all outspeed and OHKO Illumise with their STAB moves.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Bug Buzz is Illumise's main STAB move, and hits most Pokemon reasonably hard, while Thunderbolt allows Illumise to hit Moltres, who resists Bug Buzz even with Tinted Lens, and Milotic for more damage. Hidden Power Ice is Illumise's most powerful attack against Altaria, while Hidden Power Ground lets Illumise hit Toxicroak and Registeel for super effective damage. The final move depends on what item Illumise is using; if Life Orb is being utilized, Encore can be used to shut down stat-boosters, while U-turn should be used in conjunction with Choice Specs to scout switch-ins.</p> <p>Charge Beam is a decent alternative in the last slot, having a 63% chance (factoring in accuracy) to grab a free Special Attack boost while allowing Illumise to finish off a weakened opponent in the process. Roost is another option in the final slot, enabling Illumise to recover lost health, but she generally doesn't have the time to do so.</p> <p>Chansey and Registeel completely wall Illumise. Moltres (as long as it avoids Thunderbolt) and specially defensive Arcanine can take a hit and roast Illumise to a crisp with their powerful STAB Fire-type attacks. Due to this, Dugtrio is a fantastic teammate thanks to his ability to trap and remove most of Illumise's counters. Rapid Spinners are great parters since they can remove Stealth Rock, allowing Illumise to switch in much more easily. Bulky Water-types, such as Milotic and Slowking, are also wonderful as they are excellent switch-ins to the Fire-types who threaten Illumise. For this reason, Blastoise gives you the best of both worlds, as it can switch into Fire-type attacks and use Rapid Spin to clear away Stealth Rock. Hitmontop and Donphan can switch into Rock-type attacks aimed at Illumise, then spin away Stealth Rock.</p>"

Bug Buzz prevents Illumise from being rendered completely useless by Taunt, allowing her to dish out at least some form of damage.</p> <p>Charge Beam can replace Substitute if you wish to utilize Illumise's ability to Baton Pass Special Attack boosts. If you want Illumise to become a pure Baton Passer, Bug Buzz can also be replaced. Wish is also an option to pass to Illumise's recipient. It should be noted that Growth is illegal with Baton Pass. The EVs used are so Illumise has maximum bulk while being as fast as possible.</p> <p>Due to Illumise's crippling Stealth Rock weakness, Rapid Spin support is highly recommended. Blastoise is a fantasic Rapid Spinner who resists Fire-type attacks and can reliably spin away Stealth Rock; additionally, it can even pull off a Rapid Spin against Ghost-types thanks to Foresight. Hitmontop and Donphan can do the same, though these Pokemon resist Rock-type attacks, not Fire. As for recipients, virtually any Pokemon that synergizes well with Illumise works just fine. Feraligatr, Rhyperior, and Toxicroak are all excellent Pokemon who can use the protection of Substitute to set up.</p>"

  "Torkoal": {
    "overview": "<p>Torkoal is usually overlooked in favor of other bulky Fire-types such as Arcanine, or supporters like Donphan, but fortunately, it has several traits that distinguish itself from such Pokemon. Its massive 140 base Defense stat is certainly unique as far as Fire-types are concerned, allowing Torkoal to counter some top physical threats in UU such as Swellow, Absol, Scyther, and the assortment of Fighting-types. This is complemented well by a respectable support movepool consisting of Stealth Rock, Rapid Spin, Yawn, and Will-O-Wisp. While Torkoal does have its uses, with its weakness to Stealth Rock, low Special Defense, and lack of reliable recovery, the Coal Pokemon just falls short of being an ideal defensive Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Torkoal's biggest downside is its lack of instant recovery, and sadly, Rest is the ony way to solve this issue. Should you choose to run Rest, it's recommended that you use Sleep Talk as well; the other moves should preferably be a Fire-type attack and Toxic, allowing Torkoal to pose as much of a threat as possible while asleep. Protect is a decent alternative on the Support set as it gives a turn of free Leftovers recovery, and it can accumulate Toxic damage as well or scout the opponent's move after using Yawn. Torkoal may also invest in Special Defense EVs to handle some special attackers better, such as Moltres and Venusaur, as its massive Defense stat means it will still be able to tank physical hits quite well even without investment.</p> <p>Outside of its usual support duties, Torkoal can make some use out of its respectable base 85 attacking stats. With a mixed attacking set consisting of Fire Blast, Earthquake, Stone Edge, and Explosion with maximum offensive EV investment, Torkoal may nab a few surprise kills on some Pokemon (such as Explosion on bulky Water-types) expecting an easy switch-in. Torkoal has access to Curse; however, with such a shallow physical movepool which lacks even a Fire-type STAB attack, it's best not to dedicate an entire moveset to it. Other than the occasional surprise factor, Torkoal is simply best sticking with defensive and supportive roles.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As previously mentioned, bulky Water-types are the biggest problem for Torkoal, as they resist Fire-type attacks and can threaten to deal heavy damage with their STAB moves. Milotic and Slowbro can continually switch in and shrug off any damage with Recover and Slack Off, respectively. Blastoise can use Rapid Spin to stop Torkoal's attempts to keep Stealth Rock on the field, while Omastar and Qwilfish can set up their own entry hazards. Azumarill must be careful of being burned when switching in, but the Aquarabbit Pokemon can then set up a free Substitute that Torkoal cannot break without Explosion. The only real defense Torkoal has against these Pokemon is hitting them with Toxic or Yawn on the switch.</p> <p>Chansey, Clefable, and Altaria all boast Natural Cure, impressive bulk, and instant recovery, allowing them to completely wall Torkoal. Fire-types also wall Torkoal if it isn't running Toxic or Sleep Clause is already activated (thus making Yawn useless), as they resist Fire-type attacks and are immune to burns from Lava Plume. Houndoom can come in any of Torkoal's attacks to set up a Nasty Plot, or inflict some powerful blows with a Flash Fire-boosted Fire Blast. Moltres is another Fire-type that threatens Torkoal due to its high Special Attack and access to Roost.</p> <p>Speaking of powerful special attackers, targeting Torkoal's weaker Special Defense stat is one of the easiest ways to defeat it or force it to switch out. Mismagius can plow through Torkoal with Shadow Ball after a Nasty Plot boost, or set up with Calm Mind to prevent Torkoal from breaking its Substitutes. Alakazam, and Espeon can OHKO Torkoal with a Life Orb-boosted Psychic after Stealth Rock damage, as can other immediate blows like Altaria's Draco Meteor or Nidoking's Earth Power. Some monstrous physical attackers can also bypass Torkoal's massive Defense stat, most notably Rhyperior and Aggron equipped with a Choice Band; however, these Pokemon must watch out for burns.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Torkoal's fantastic Defense stat gives it many opportunities to switch in and clear entry hazards with Rapid Spin or set up Stealth Rock. At the same time, this set can serve as a counter to many common physical attackers in UU, crippling them with a status move or blasting them with a solid STAB Fire-type attack.</p> <p>Yawn is the favourable status option; other than sleep being a powerful tool, it forces Ghost-types hoping to block Rapid Spin to choose between switching out (thus losing their entry hazards) or being put to sleep. Toxic is an alternative to gradually wear down opposing Pokemon through poison damage, especially those who can shrug off Torkoal's Fire-type attacks. The choice between Lava Plume and Flamethrower comes down to whether you would rather have more power or an increased burn rate. Lava Plume is preferable due to its high burn rate, although it can conflict with Yawn or Toxic, while Flamethrower maintains the chance to burn while boasting slightly more power. Finally, Explosion can also be used in the last slot with a Relaxed nature to inflict some heavy damage before fainting.</p> <p>This set can function in the lead slot, as it matches up favorably against the likes of Ambipom and Uxie, able to set up Stealth Rock or prevent opposing hazards with Rapid Spin. For a more reliable burn-inducing move, Will-O-Wisp can be used in the fourth slot along with Flamethrower. If your team is already packing a Stealth Rock user, the move can be replaced by an extra status move or Explosion.</p> <p>Torkoal requires teammates to patch up the unfortunate weaknesses that come bundled with its Fire typing. Bulky Water-types are the bane of Torkoal's existence, especially those with instant recovery, such as Slowbro and Milotic; therefore, it's important to have an answer to such foes. Grass-types like Venusaur and Exeggutor are great candidates to remedy this problem, as they are able to switch in on the aforementioned Water-types without much fear and heal any damage taken with Synthesis. Offensively, Toxicroak can take advantage of Water-type attacks aimed at Torkoal with its Dry Skin ability in order to set up a free Swords Dance or Nasty Plot. Despite causing issues for it in battle, bulky Water-types complement Torkoal fantastically; they are able to sponge powerful Rock- and Ground-type attacks that it struggles against, while also countering Fire-types that wall Torkoal if it doesn't have Toxic. Additionally, utilizing both a Water- and a Grass-type alongside Torkoal completes the common Fire-Water-Grass core that creates a solid backbone for any team.</p> <p>Generally, Torkoal's high Defense and low Special Defense means it synergizes well with specially defensive Pokemon. Clefable and Chansey can easily come in on the aforementioned Water-types, force them out, then use Wish to pass to a teammate. Torkoal especially appreciates this since it lacks recovery options outside of Rest. Altaria has useful resistances to Water- and Ground-type attacks (although many Water-types do also carry an Ice-type attack), and it can use Roost to continue supporting Torkoal throughout the duration of a battle.</p>"

  "Lunatone": {
    "overview": "<p>Lunatone has had a rough road since its introduction in ADV. It has a very unique typing, a great ability, and an expansive movepool, but it lacks any exceptional stats with which to abuse its good qualities. Add that to the fact that its typing brings with it a whole slew of weaknesses, the absence of a good special Rock-type STAB, and the fact that Lunatone is directly outclassed by its counterpart, Solrock, and there seems to be little reason to use it all. While Lunatone's lower Attack stat compared to Solrock does make for a weaker Explosion, its higher Special Defense and Special Attack do provide it with a niche in the UU metagame. Play to Lunatone's strengths and the results just may surprise you.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lunatone has a plethora of other support options, including Hypnosis, Reflect, Light Screen, and Gravity, but is generally too frail to successfully use any of them. Lunatone can also pass Charge Beam and Cosmic Power boosts, but has a hard time doing so due to its many weaknesses and lack of Speed. A Choice Specs set consisting of Psychic, Grass Knot, Shadow Ball, and Ice Beam is possible, but Lunatone is far too frail and slow to effectively pull it off. Ancient Power is Lunatone's sole special Rock-type STAB outside of Hidden Power Rock, but the Base Power is far too low and the benefits are not worth the effort. Lunatone also has Pain Split, but, again, Lunatone is neither bulky nor fast enough to make use of it. If using Lunatone in the lead slot, Hidden Power Grass can be used in place of Stealth Rock to 2HKO Rhyperior, Omastar, and Kabutops, but has little use otherwise.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Countering Lunatone directly is tricky due to Baton Pass and Explosion, but Chansey, Clefable, and Miltank easily wall anything special that Lunatone may attempt. Registeel fears almost nothing from Lunatone, except maybe a +4 Earth Power, and easily breaks down the Meteorite Pokemon with a super effective Iron Head or Shadow Claw. Altaria and bulky Grass-types not named Venusaur walk all over Lunatone if it lacks Ice Beam. Phazers stop Lunatone's Baton Passing games in their tracks and prevent any stat boosts from being accumulated. Dark-types put Lunatone in a checkmate position if it lacks Baton Pass, and Water-types can easily wash Lunatone away if it lacks Grass Knot. Lanturn sticks out as a Water-type who doesn't fear Grass Knot in the slightest, but it won't like Earth Power much. In general, Lunatone probably won't be attacking any Pokemon directly, but be wary of who it may be passing to and watch out for Explosion.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>This set is designed to actually take advantage of Lunatone's many weaknesses; Lunatone can lure out specific counters, use Rock Polish on the switch, and then proceed to Baton Pass to the appropriate teammate. The last two attacks allow Lunatone to deal decent damage off its respectable base 95 Special Attack stat. With the lack of a good Rock-type STAB, Psychic is the STAB move to use, striking Poison- and Fighting-types for solid damage. Calm Mind gives Lunatone another boost to Baton Pass to its teammates. In most situations, Lunatone will only be able to set up a Rock Polish before needing to Baton Pass out; however, in a Baton Pass chain, Lunatone could be passed some defensive boosts, allowing it to find more time to set up a few Calm Minds before passing to a receiver. Finally, Substitute can be abused in the last slot to bring Lunatone down to a low enough HP total to activate Petaya Berry. Substitute itself can be passed too, and it is very helpful for blocking unexpected status attacks and protecting Lunatone's teammates as it Baton Passes to them.</p> <p>The EVs are designed to allow Lunatone to reach a Speed stat of 233, enough to just outpace max Speed Torterra. After a Rock Polish boost, Lunatone reaches a Speed stat of 466, enough to outspeed Timid Choice Scarf Rotom. The rest of the EVs are placed into HP and Special Defense to give Lunatone some bulk. Lunatone isn't just limited to passing a Petaya Berry boost, either; any of the pinch Berries make for a good replacement, depending on the Pokemon Lunatone is planning on passing to. Charge Beam is a good alternative to use in the last slot, as it allows Lunatone to go on the offensive and pass on any boosts it receives to its teammates. Psychic and Electric also have fantastic coverage in the UU tier. Explosion can be used in the last slot too, but Lunatone's low Attack stat means it usually won't be doing much damage, especially without any EV investment. It can be useful for punching a hole in Chansey and Clefable, who otherwise wall Lunatone until the end of days, thus allowing a specially oriented sweeper to come in and clean up.</p> <p>Because of Lunatone's many weaknesses, there are numerous potential teammates who can make use of Lunatone's boosts while covering its weaknesses. Lunatone tends to draw Water- and Grass-type attacks, especially from the two most common Pokemon of UU, Milotic and Venusaur. Therefore, any partner who can make use of the Speed boost Lunatone provides while eliminating the aforementioned Pokemon makes a great teammate. Life Orb Magmortar or offensive Venusaur can easily come in on Venusaur or Milotic, respectively, while boasting an increase to their average Speed thanks to the Baton Passed Rock Polish from Lunatone. Drapion makes a good partner to Lunatone, covering its Ghost-, Dark-, Bug- and Grass-type weaknesses and enjoying the Speed boosts it provides. As a bonus, Lunatone can easily come in on any Ground-type attacks aimed at Drapion and start the cycle all over again. Some good examples of other Pokemon who appreciate Lunatone's Rock Polishes include Azumarill, Octillery, Cradily, Hariyama, Medicham, and Moltres. Finally, if Lunatone gets a chance to use Calm Mind as well, the aforementioned Octillery and Moltres make even better partners, as they are able to capitalize on the Special Attack boosts to become truly devastating sweepers.</p>"
      },
      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to abuse Lunatone's decent Special Attack, access to Rock Polish, rare Speed stat, and generous movepool to their fullest extent. After a single Rock Polish, Lunatone reaches 466 Speed, enough to outpace Timid Choice Scarf Rotom. From there, Lunatone's goal is to either blast its usual counters with a super effective coverage move, sweep late-game, or Baton Pass out to a teammate if the opposition is too tough. Psychic is Lunatone's STAB move of choice, and is powerful enough to OHKO offensive Venusaur on the spot. Earth Power and Shadow Ball, when combined with Psychic, provide the best possible super effective coverage in the UU tier. Earth Power nails Registeel (though only for 33.5% - 39.6%), Rhyperior, Drapion, and Skuntank, while Shadow Ball blasts opposing Psychic- and Ghost-types into oblivion, dealing 44.6% - 53.1% to 252/0 Uxie and 73.3% - 87% to 4/0 Mismagius. Grass Knot is a good alternative for the last slot, as it 2HKOes Milotic and other bulky Water-types that would otherwise wall Lunatone and drown it with Surf. Finally, Baton Pass is available to allow Lunatone to escape from a bad situation, such as against a full-health Registeel or Spiritomb, and pass the Rock Polish boost to a teammate.</p> <p>An alternative EV spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with a Timid nature allows Lunatone to outpace neutral-natured base 80s before a boost. This can be particularly useful to eliminate neutral-natured Venusaur and Blaziken in emergency situations. Lunatone's movepool has no shortage of other options to use in the last slot. Ice Beam is extremely useful for OHKOing Tangrowth, Altaria, Exeggutor, and Donphan (the latter two after Stealth Rock damage) in one go. Signal Beam is nice to hit Absol for super effective damage, but in most situations it will Sucker Punch and OHKO Lunatone anyway, making the attempt futile. Lunatone tends to lure in Chansey and Clefable, on whom Lunatone can then use Explosion with a Rash nature, OHKOing them and opening the door for a special sweeper to clean up the opponent's team unhindered.</p> <p>Like most offensive Pokemon, Lunatone enjoys Spikes and Stealth Rock support to achieve a few KOs, such as a 2HKO on Registeel with Earth Power. Cloyster and Qwilfish are fantastic teammates for providing Spikes, while Miltank and Steelix are great teammates for setting up Stealth Rock. Chansey and Clefable utterly wall Lunatone if it lacks Explosion, and Registeel does the same if Lunatone isn't running Earth Power, so teammates who can get rid of such threats are highly appreciated. Hariyama can switch in on all of them with ease and smash them with its STAB attacks, and Dugtrio can trap and dispose of them with Earthquake or Beat Up. Uxie and Mesprit wall Lunatone if it doesn't have Shadow Ball or Signal Beam, as do Altaria and Tangrowth if it lacks Ice Beam. Spiritomb easily rips the pixies apart with Pursuit, while Milotic can switch into Altaria with ease and eliminate it with its own Ice Beam. Finally, Venusaur is a great offensive teammate to pair with Lunatone, and it can dispose of Tangrowth with its powerful STAB Sludge Bomb.</p>"
      },
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>As a Trick Room user, Lunatone has a unique array of qualities that separate it from its competition. Lunatone's biggest advantage is its access to both Explosion and Stealth Rock. With Explosion, Lunatone is able to set up Trick Room, Explode on whichever unfortunate Pokemon happens to be across from him, and allow a teammate to come in unscathed with three turns of Trick Room remaining. Stealth Rock is always useful for chipping health off opposing Pokemon, making it easier for Lunatone's teammates to score their KOs. The last slot is mostly filler; Psychic is Lunatone's most reliable STAB, but unfortunately leaves it walled by Spiritomb and Steel-types. Not much else could go there, though, and at least this prevents Lunatone from becoming total Taunt bait.</p> <p>When using Lunatone, the main idea is to come in, set up Trick Room, and use Explosion as soon as possible to give the rest of the team time to abuse Trick Room. However, using Explosion blindly is not always the best course of action; in many cases, it will probably be better to use Stealth Rock and then switch to the appropriate teammate. If your team already has Stealth Rock support elsewhere, Earth Power or Shadow Ball can be used in its place to grant Lunatone far greater coverage, allowing it to function as a moderate sweeper. The EV spread is designed to give Lunatone the strongest Explosion possible, as Lunatone will rarely be using Psychic at all.</p> <p>Lunatone makes an adequate lead, but it suffers from the omnipresence of Taunt, and has no way to stop leads such as Omastar, Uxie, and Qwilfish from setting up entry hazards. However, using Lunatone in the lead position can prove useful at times, as Lunatone is guaranteed to set up Trick Room if the opposing lead lacks Taunt. When being used as a lead, Focus Sash is the recommended item since it allows Lunatone to survive any attack and set up Trick Room. With the EV spread listed, Lunatone has a chance to survive the combination of Life Orb Ambipom's Fake Out and U-turn. However, most times it will usually be better to just switch out to a teammate who isn't threatened by Ambipom, such as Rhyperior or Spiritomb. Using Lunatone in the lead position can also provide your team with Stealth Rock early in the game, while Explosion is useful for punching a hole in the opposing team right from the get-go.</p> <p>Good teammates for this Lunatone include Pokemon who, obviously, can take advantage of Trick Room and cover Lunatone's many weaknesses. Exeggutor and Slowbro can both set up and abuse Trick Room, and they can take Grass- and Water-type attacks, respectively. Porygon2 makes a good partner to Lunatone, absorbing the Ghost-type attacks aimed at it and switching into Spiritomb with little trouble. Porygon2 is also neutral to Dark-type attacks, unique among Trick Room users, though it's crippled by Taunt. Good sweepers to pair with Lunatone include Azumarill, Hariyama, and Camerupt. Azumarill has no trouble switching into the Water-types Lunatone will encounter, and functions well both in and out of Trick Room thanks to Aqua Jet. Hariyama can switch into any Dark-type Lunatone may encounter and smash it with STAB Close Combat. Lunatone and Camerupt get along well because Lunatone can switch into Ground-type attacks aimed at Camerupt and set up Trick Room multiple times throughout the battle.</p>"

It has a unique typing and a great ability, but its plethora of weaknesses to the most commonly used attacking types and below average defenses mean that it'll usually be KOed before accomplishing much on the battlefield. That may seem like a lot of bad news, but this shouldn't deter anyone from choosing Solrock, as it has access to a myriad of supporting and attacking moves, as well as a unique typing and ability that can offer useful resistances to fill specific niches in your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Solrock has a plethora of other support options, including Will-O-Wisp, Reflect, Light Screen, and Gravity, but is generally too frail to use any of them.

A Choice Band set is possible, but Solrock has a limited movepool to work with and is outclassed by Rhyperior and Aggron thanks to their much higher bulk and Attack.

Bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Slowbro take pitiful damage from anything Solrock can dish out, bar Explosion, and easily KO Solrock with Surf. Registeel, Regirock, and Rhyperior take little damage from anything Solrock may use and enjoy Trick Room thanks to their low Speed. Spiritomb puts a good stop to either Solrock set; it is immune to Explosion and Zen Headbutt, benefits from Trick Room, and KOes Solrock with any of its moves. Spiritomb can even pick off Solrock with Shadow Sneak before it can Baton Pass out to its teammate. Venusaur can easily come in on either set and threaten Solrock with Leaf Storm or Energy Ball.

A physical set is a bad idea since the only viable physical attacks Castform learns are Return, Facade, and Avalanche. Thunder Wave and Toxic can cripple switch-ins, but running either will cut coverage. Weather Ball can be a great 100 Base Power STAB move if Castform is being used on a weather team, and if Sunny Day is the weather of choice, then Solar Beam becomes viable too.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>If it's not hit super effectively, it counters Castform. In UU, this includes (but is most definitely not limited to): Absol, Aggron, Ambipom, Arcanine, Blaziken, Chansey, Clefable, Drapion, Hariyama, Hitmonlee, Hitmontop, Houndoom, Kangaskhan, Ludicolo, Mesprit, Miltank, Primeape, Spiritomb, Ursaring, Uxie, and Weezing. Heck, even some Pokemon that are hit super effectively can counter Castform if they're bulky enough, like Milotic, Lanturn, Mismagius, and Registeel, among others.</p>",

Energy Ball is mostly filler, but is useful against Water / Ground-types, who are neutral to BoltBeam. Same goes for Shadow Ball, but for Ghost- and Psychic-types. With these four moves, Castform hits quite a bit of the tier super effectively, which is good since he lacks a reliable STAB attack, so anything he can't hit super effectively can quite easily shrug off any of his attempts.</p> <p>A boosting item is pretty much necessary if Castform wants to be offensively capable at all; Life Orb provides the highest boost possible (while still maintaining the ability to switch moves), but since Castform hits so many Pokemon super effectively, Expert Belt is also a viable option, with a similar boost and no recoil. The EVs are an attempt to bolster Castform's lackluster stats for sweeping, putting Castform a point above Jolly Torterra. A Timid nature and 244 Speed EVs can be used if you want Castform to outpace neutral-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon. The remaining EVs can then be added to HP for bulk.</p> <p>Castform is a slow, relatively weak special attacker; therefore, we can say that he'll appreciate entry hazard, dual screen, paralysis, and wallbreaker support. Uxie can do the former three well, and also makes a great fallback Pokemon when facing powerful attackers. Blaziken is pretty much undisputed as the best wallbreaker in the tier, although Nidoking can give him a run for his money. Castform really shouldn't be used in any competitive team, so it's recommended that you just replace him with one of the many other, better special attackers in the tier if you're at least a little bit serious about winning, and go with their team options.</p>"

Chansey walls any move that Chimecho throws at it, but should be wary of any boosted move on the Calm Mind set (though it will take until +6 for Chimecho to deal any real damage).

Wish is another great move on Chimecho, and allows it to heal its teammates and itself when required, though Recover can be used as a more instantaneous form of healing. The last move slot depends on which form of healing is being used. Wish should be used with Protect as it allows Chimecho to heal itself more reliably, but can also be used to scout the opponent's team.

Pokemon such as Donphan, Hitmontop, and Blastoise are recommended due to their good synergy with Chimecho. Defensive Steel-type Pokemon such as Steelix and Registeel are also recommended due to their good synergy with the wind chime, and also because they can soak up most physical attacks that usually head in Chimecho's direction.

As for its coverage move, Hidden Power Ground is the primary option and allows the wind chime to hit Registeel and Dark-type Pokemon, such as Drapion, Skuntank, and Spiritomb harder, though Shadow Ball is slashed as it allows Chimecho to hit a wider range of Pokemon. Recover is used in the last slot so that Chimecho is able to stick around longer, and hopefully gain more Calm Mind boosts.</p> <p>The EVs and nature are chosen to complement Chimecho's weaker physical bulk, and allow it to tank both physical and special hits with Calm Mind. Leftovers are the chosen item to further add to Chimecho's survivability on the field.</p> <p>As with the Support set, entry hazards are a threat as they limit the usefulness of Chimecho by disabling its ability to switch in and out of attacks as required. As such, Donphan, Hitmontop, and Blastoise are recommended due to their good synergy with Chimecho. Steel-type Pokemon are also recommended due to good synergy with Chimecho. This variation of the wind chime loves having entry hazard support, as they turn many 2HKOs into OHKOs.</p>"

  "Wormadam": {
    "overview": "<p>Wormadam is just another one of the many horribly outclassed Grass-types in UU. It has a decent base 105 Special Defense, but its Bug / Grass typing curses it with far too many weaknesses to wall anything effectively. It does possess a decent base 79 Special Attack stat, but many other Grass-types in UU (such as Venusaur) provide higher offensive power with fewer drawbacks. All in all, while Wormadam is usable, there are far better options.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There aren't many other options Wormadam can utilize. It can change its Hidden Power type to Ground or Fire to hit Steel-types super effectively. However, the primary Steel-type of UU, Registeel, can easily shrug off even a super effective Hidden Power Ground or Hidden Power Fire. Shadow Ball is an option as a coverage move to hit Alakazam or Mismagius on the switch-in, making it a useful attack in the right situations. However, if either of these Pokemon get in safely they can KO or set up on Wormadam, making Shadow Ball situational at best. If Life Orb is Wormadam's item of choice, Toxic may be put over any move on Wormadam's moveset to cripple walls over long periods of time. However, Wormadam never stays alive long enough to outstall a wall and suffers greatly from giving up a coverage move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As Wormadam will often be locked into a single attack by Choice Specs, almost any Pokemon can come in on a resisted attack and force Wormadam to switch out. However, several Pokemon can switch into almost all or all of its assaults. Two Pokemon that come to mind are Chansey and Registeel, each of which can switch into any of Wormadam's attacks and force it out or set up on it. Arcanine and Moltres also take very little damage from anything Wormadam can throw at them if it runs Hidden Power Ice over Hidden Power Rock. In addition, Wormadam suffers from a weakness to Stealth Rock without being immune to Spikes, meaning that several layers of entry hazards from Pokemon such as Omastar and Donphan can prove to be great boons in a fight against a Wormadam.</p>",

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set is Wormadam's best attempt at damaging opposing Pokemon in UU. Despite being outclassed by many other Grass-types, Wormadam still possesses a few tricks of its own. For one, it flaunts a secondary Bug typing that provides it with a resistance to popular Fighting-type attacks, as well as decent special bulk to help it tank neutral attacks effectively. All of this, combined with Wormadam's ever-useful Grass typing that helps it massacre Milotic and other Water-types, makes it a decent if not preferable choice.</p> <p>Leaf Storm is Wormadam's most powerful attack, capable of scoring OHKOs on many of the Water-types in UU, such as physically defensive Blastoise and Milotic. However, the Special Attack drop is extremely crippling to Wormadam. Psychic is a strong alternative against opponents resistant to Grass, such as Venusaur and Weezing. Signal Beam and Energy Ball provide reliable STAB attacks, forming the core of Wormadam's moveset. The choice of Hidden Power is a decision between being able to damage opposing Fire-types such as Arcanine or severely crippling Altaria while also hitting opposing Grass-types such as Leafeon for super effective damage.</p> <p>The EVs on this set are fairly straightforward. Maximum Special Attack and a Modest nature are required for Wormadam to damage things at all, while 200 Speed EVs allow Wormadam to outspeed Weezing and 2HKO it with Psychic before it 2HKOes Wormadam with Sludge Bomb. The rest of the EVs are placed into HP to increase Wormadam's bulk. Choice Specs is the recommended item on this set because Wormadam needs to hit as hard as it possibly can to be at all threatening. Although Life Orb gives Wormadam the freedom to switch moves, the power boost is not as great as Choice Specs. In addition, Wormadam needs to preserve its HP, especially given its crippling weakness to Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Wormadam requires quite a bit of team support to function efficiently. Dugtrio is a very effective teammate for it, as the mole easily traps and destroys Registeel, Arcanine, and Chansey, three Pokemon that give Wormadam a lot of trouble. Donphan is another great partner for Wormadam, as it can use Rapid Spin to remove troubling entry hazards, in addition to defeating Registeel and Arcanine handily.</p>"

  "Wormadam-Sandy": {
    "overview": "<p>Wormadam-G is often considered a joke, and one does not have to think hard to discover why. It has a mediocre Attack stat, an odd typing, and a horrible movepool that somehow lacks Stealth Rock despite its Ground typing. With Earthquake and Bug Bite as its only worthwhile attacking options, it would seem that Wormadam-G has no hope of ever making any sort of contribution to competitive battling. However, even this bug has a couple of surprises. Its Defense stat is just good enough to tank various physical hits and its rare typing gives it resistances to both Fighting and Ground--two very common attacking types in the UU metagame. It also has access to Rain Dance, which allows it to be a decent Rain Dance supporter, especially considering that its typing has good synergy with common rain sweepers. Despite its disadvantages, Wormadam-G's advantages make it an interesting choice for an UU team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Unfortunately, Wormadam-G barely has any viable options that are not already listed on the sets above. Sucker Punch can be used to hurt faster attackers, while Rock Blast can help it take down Substitutes and Flying-types immune to Earthquake. It can also use Endeavor and Flail on a gimmick set, but it will most likely die before it is able to use them. Wormadam-G has Earth Power, Psychic, Signal Beam, and Shadow Ball on the special side, but its base Special Attack stat is truly appalling. Skill Swap has a chance to steal a useful ability that Wormadam-G can then call its own, such as Arcanine's Flash Fire.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Weezing is the best counter to Wormadam-G, due to its immunity to both Earthquake and Toxic, resistance to Bug Bite, and access to Will-O-Wisp and Fire Blast. Bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Blastoise can absorb Wormadam-G's attacks easily, and take advantage of the rain that Wormadam-G provides. RestTalk Milotic is especially threatening, as it can Rest off Toxic, and then attack with super effective Surfs and Ice Beams via Sleep Talk. Moltres is immune to Earthquake, and can OHKO Wormadam-G with STAB Fire Blast and Air Slash. However, it must be wary of Toxic.</p>",

      "Rain Dance Support": {
        "description": "<p>With a rare typing, good Defense, and Rain Dance, Wormadam-G makes a useful Rain Dance supporter. Rain Dance is a given on a set like this, and it also helps Wormadam-G deal with its Fire-type weakness. Bug Bite discourages Grass-types such as Sceptile, which would otherwise greatly threaten Rain Dance teams, from switching in. Earthquake is a strong STAB attack that allows Wormadam-G to damage Pokemon like Lanturn, which are problematic to rain sweepers. Finally, Toxic helps wear down bulky Pokemon such as Milotic and Blastoise.</p> <p>The EVs and nature give Wormadam-G a good amount of bulk and enough power to discourage switch-ins. Wormadam-G lures in many Fire-types, so Omastar and Kabutops make great partners with their 4x resistance to Fire. They are also effective rain sweepers that appreciate Wormadam-G's ability to cripple bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Slowbro with Toxic. Lanturn is another notable teammate to consider, because it defeats bulky Water-types with ease. Additionally, Lanturn's Water STAB becomes boosted and Thunder receives 100% accuracy with Wormadam-G's rain support. Note that bulky Water-types can also take advantage of Rain Dance, so be prepared with Water immune Pokemon such as Toxicroak.</p>"

      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<p>With a RestTalk set, Wormadam-G can abuse its resistances and good Defense to their fullest potential. Rest allows it to recover off damage and cure status, while Sleep Talk gives it the ability to not be entirely useless for the two turns spent sleeping. Earthquake is recommended so Wormadam-G isn't completely ruined by Taunt, and it deters opposing Fire-types from switching in. Toxic deals with bulky Pokemon that attempt to switch into Wormadam-G, such as Milotic, Slowbro, and Arcanine.</p> <p>Since Wormadam-G is weak to Fire-, Ice-, and Water-type moves, bulky Waters such as Milotic make great partners. If Wormadam-G manages to Toxic any of these Pokemon, then Milotic can stall them to death with Recover. Clefable is a decent special wall that can help out Wormadam-G by setting up Stealth Rock, crippling potential counters with Trick, and draining the foe's HP with Seismic Toss; also, its Fighting weakness can be covered by Wormadam-G. Unfortunately, Wormadam-G has a number of other counters. Weezing completely walls this set, thanks to its immunity to Toxic and Earthquake, and can burn off Wormadam-G with Fire Blast. Moltres also threatens Wormadam-G with STAB Fire Blast and Air Slash, but it does not appreciate Toxic. With its immunity to Earthquake and ability to absorb Toxic with Guts, Swellow can switch in effortlessly and threaten to KO Wormadam-G with STAB Brave Bird. To stop Weezing, Moltres, and Swellow, the aforementioned Milotic in combination with Substitute Rhyperior can help. Both Milotic and Rhyperior can survive most of their attacks, and then strike back with Surf and Stone Edge, respectively; Rhyperior has the added bonus of setting up Substitute to block Weezing's Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

  "Wormadam-Trash": {
    "overview": "<p>Wormadam-S has always been considered a bad Pokemon. Its stats are subpar, its movepool is shallow, and it doesn't have anything that makes it stand out from other Bug-types. Simply put, Wormadam-S is basically an inferior Forretress. Nevertheless, this Pokemon shouldn't be considered complete trash (pun intended), as it has a superb defensive typing with only a single weakness, as well as good overall defenses. These attributes mean that the pink bagworm can be a good team supporter in UU if played correctly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There isn't much else that Wormadam-S can do, but there are a few options to choose from. It can utilize Metal Sound, Flash Cannon, Psychic, and a Hidden Power of your choice with a Modest nature to create a special attacking set, but it is usually inferior to every other special attacking Pokemon in UU in all cases. It also has access to Substitute, but with its lack of reliable recovery and a glaring weakness to Fire-type moves, it is not worth using. It is also able to set up rain in the form of Rain Dance, due to it's its great 4x resistance to Grass, which many rain teams struggle with, and can also lure in Fire-types for Pokemon like Kabutops to switch into. Skill Swap is also a viable gimmick move to use on Fire-types, because if Wormadam-S can snag Flash Fire, it will have at least a neutrality to all types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Wormadam-S is not hard to counter. Pretty much any Fire-type is a counter to Wormadam-S, as they can switch in and easily OHKO the floating bug. Arcanine and Houndoom make short work of Wormadam-S with their Fire-type STAB moves, and can also set up on it with ease. Moltres falls in a similar category, and can even set up Substitute as Wormadam-S switches out or attempts to poison it. Altaria can also set up on Wormadam-S with impunity and proceed to sweep, but should be cautious of Toxic (though Natural Cure somewhat remedies this problem). Weezing is another good counter to the pink bagworm, as it resists all of its attacking moves and Toxic, and can OHKO with Fire Blast or Flamethrower. Wormadam-S also has to be wary of Uxie, who can set up dual screens before crippling it with Memento. Registeel, despite not being able to do much to Wormadam-S, can use it as setup fodder and boost its stats with Curse. Basically, don't try hitting it with Grass- or Poison-type attacks and avoid Toxic and you've successfully countered it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>This is Wormadam-S at its best. Wormadam's main strategy will be to set up Stealth Rock as early as possible, and then attempt to cripple a few Pokemon before it faints. Gyro Ball is its main attacking move, as it gains STAB and is quite powerful due to Wormadam's low Speed stat. Wormadam-S has access to both Toxic and Protect, allowing it to effectively Toxic stall opposing Pokemon. Protect also has the added benefit of enabling Wormadam-S to scout for Hidden Power Fire, as Wormadam's ability, Anticipation, does not allow it to detect the type of Hidden Power.</p> <p>Wormadam-S's resistances are more suited to \"countering\" special attackers, and thus the EVs and nature have been chosen to reflect this. Max HP and 240 Special Defense EVs give it a considerable amount of bulk on the special side, and allow it to survive two +2 Thunderbolts from Mismagius, whilst 16 Defense EVs allow Wormadam-S to never be 2HKOed by a +2 Double-Edge from Leafeon, factoring in Leftovers recovery from Protect. Leftovers is chosen to complement Wormadam's bulk, whilst Sassy is the chosen nature to maximize Special Defense and maintain a low Speed stat, in order to give Gyro Ball more power.</p> <p>Milotic is a great partner to Wormadam-S, as it is able to switch in on the Fire-type Pokemon who threaten Wormadam-S and strike back with Surf. Omastar is also an excellent teammate thanks to its 4x resistance to Fire-type moves and ability to set up entry hazards. Slowbro is also a good switch-in, as it resists many of the moves that would normally fatally wound the pink-bagworm, and heal itself with Slack Off or set up dual screens to support the team. Houndoom and Arcanine appreciate Wormadam-S's ability to cripple bulky Water-types with Toxic, and can also switch in on Fire-type moves and receive a boost thanks to Flash Fire, turning them both into deadly sweepers.</p>"

  "Cherrim": {
    "overview": "<p>What sets Cherrim apart from other Grass-types is its unique ability, Flower Gift, which raises its Attack and Special Defense stats in sunlight. A few decent support moves such as Aromatherapy, Grass Whistle, and Leech Seed, not to mention Cherrim's above average defenses, make it a decent Sunny Day supporter. However, Cherrim is not as fast as it would like, and also has a pretty shallow movepool, greatly limiting its potential in battle. This makes it good for only one thing: Sunny Day. Honestly, if you don't use Cherrim with Sunny Day, don't use Cherrim, as it is otherwise worthless.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cherrim has access to Swords Dance, which may be appealing due to Flower Gift's Attack boost, but Cherrim's physical movepool is limited to just Seed Bomb and Return, which get extremely bad coverage. Cherrim's lesser Speed stat also doesn't help when it comes to sweeping. Aside from this, Cherrim really has very few other viable options that it can utilize.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Flying-types cause problems for Cherrim as they resist its STAB Grass-type moves, and some even resist Hidden Power Fire, like Altaria and Moltres. Altaria also has Natural Cure to heal itself in case of Cherrim's Grass Whistle. STAB Flying-type moves usually spell doom for Cherrim, especially physical ones such as Brave Bird. Fire-types can switch into any of Cherrim's attacks and threaten it with a super effective hit. Arcanine and Houndoom can switch into Hidden Power Fire and hit Cherrim with a Flash Fire-boosted attack. Be wary of Hidden Power Ground, though. Chansey, Clefable, Registeel, and most specially defensive Pokemon that resist Grass-type moves can cause Cherrim problems with their tremendous bulk. Chansey and Clefable are generally the best counters as they can recover freely with Wish or Soft-Boiled, while using Aromatherapy to heal any status.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sunny Day": {
        "description": "<p>Cherrim has the perfect ability and movepool to be an effective Sunny Day supporter. While Aromatherapy is great for removing status from the whole team, Grass Whistle can put opponents to sleep and allow Cherrim to set up for free if it hits. The third slot is reserved for a STAB attack, and Cherrim is not short of options to choose from. The STAB move of choice is Energy Ball, providing reliable Base Power and perfect accuracy. Another move you may consider is Solar Beam, which has 180 Base Power when taking STAB into account. Solar Beam's detrimental side effect is circumvented through the use of Sunny Day, so its usability is skyrocketed. Grass Knot is another a good option, as it will deal more damage than Energy Ball to heavier opponents like Milotic, Slowking, and Rhyperior, but unlike Solar Beam, is effective outside sunlight. The final moveslot is for type coverage; Hidden Power Fire allows Cherrim to hit other Grass-types with a 105 Base Power attack in sunlight, while Hidden Power Ground deals with Fire-types like Houndoom and Arcanine. Both attacks also hit Registeel super effectively. Cherrim also gets Weather Ball, which becomes a 150 Base Power Fire-type attack in the sunlight, though it's rather useless outside of it, as it'll be a Normal-type attack with a measly 50 Base Power. Heat Rock is the ideal item for this set as it prolongs the sunlight, and it is recommended you do not swap it for anything else.</p> <p>The EVs on this set focus on Cherrim's special stats; maximum Special Attack gives Cherrim some power behind its attacks, while maximum Special Defense with Flower Gift gives Cherrim 381 Special Defense in the sun, making it much bulkier on the special side. Alternatively, you could use a Calm nature with a spread of 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 SpD for maximum special bulk. You could also focus on Cherrim's lower physical Defense by giving it a Bold nature with 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA. In either of these cases, you should consider Leech Seed or Synthesis on the set as Cherrim will be aiming to stick around for much longer.</p> <p>Houndoom is an excellent partner for Cherrim, as it can switch into Fire-type moves to gain a boost from its Flash Fire ability. Houndoom also reduces the necessity for Hidden Power Fire on Cherrim, as it can defeat opposing Grass-types with its own STAB Fire-type attacks. Registeel is also a good partner, as it can switch into Flying-type moves with ease. This is helpful against the likes of Swellow, Scyther, and even Drapion. Bulky Water-types, such as Milotic and Slowking, are effective against both Fire- and Flying-types, especially Moltres. Unfortunately, their STAB moves are weakened by the sunlight, which is never a good thing.</p> <p>Pokemon that can take advantage of the sunlight make obvious partners for Cherrim. Fire-types like Moltres, Houndoom, and Arcanine can enjoy their STAB moves boosted by 50%, and refined access to Solar Beam, which has no charging turn when used in sunlight. Some Grass-types also enjoy the sunlight due to their abilities; Chlorophyll Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Exeggutor, Shiftry, and Victreebel would greatly benefit from the Speed boost, while Pokemon with the Leaf Guard ability like Leafeon and Tangrowth will appreciate the status immunity. If you decide to use Hidden Power Fire on Cherrim, a way to deal with opposing Fire-types is very important to your team's success. Bulky Water-types like Milotic and Slowking are excellent choices, as they have great HP stats and above average defenses, along with STAB Surf and decent Special Attack with which to deal with them. Dugtrio is another great choice as it can trap the opponent with its ability, Arena Trap, and proceed to KO the grounded ones with Earthquake. Regirock and Rhyperior are two other options as they can switch into Fire-types with relative ease and either set up entry hazards or Rock Polish, respectively. Alternatively,they can pummel the opponent with STAB Stone Edge. If Cherrim is unable to set up Sunny Day, another Pokemon should carry the move just in case. Defensive Pokemon like Uxie and Mesprit make good choices as they can further support the team with screens, Stealth Rock, and paralysis. You may also choose a more offensive, suicidal approach to this. Exeggutor can set up Sunny Day, then sacrifice itself with Explosion, while Ambipom can set up weather and escape with U-turn.</p>"

  "Weezing": {
    "overview": "<p>Weezing makes for a fantastic defensive Pokemon in UU, possessing useful resistances to Fighting, Grass, Poison, and Bug, an immunity to ubiquitous Ground-type attacks, and only a single uncommon weakness, all backed up by a sweet Defense stat. While his lacking Special Defense leaves him vulnerable to powerful STAB attacks from that end, he maintains the ability to switch in on a variety of threats and threaten them with his surprisingly large movepool. All in all, while Weezing may not be up to par with behemoths such as Skarmory or Hippowdon in OU, he has anchored himself as a top-tier wall down in the bright and ambitious little UU tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Specs set actually has a lot of potential with Weezing, thanks to his surprisingly large special movepool. However, while Poison is a great defensive type, it's pretty terrible as an offensive type, dealing super effective damage to only one other type, being resisted by four, and being completely useless against Steel-types. Rain Dance is another promising option; as a supporter, Weezing is able to deal with the Grass-types that usually trouble a Rain Dance team, and can use the rain to weaken the Fire-type attacks he himself usually fears. Sunny Day is a reverse case, making Fire-types even harder to deal with, but giving Weezing an effective STAB on Fire-type moves. Destiny Bond and Memento are useful sacrificial options on Weezing, but he's too slow to make effective use of them. Explosion is another sacrificial move that lets Weezing literally blast any Pokemon that doesn't resist it into oblivion, and is particularly helpful for disposing of Clefable and Chansey, but Weezing is usually better off supporting the team, and Pain Split will do a number on both of the pudgy Normal-types anyway. Weezing gets access to Shadow Ball and Dark Pulse, which can help him smack Psychic-types on the switch-in. Toxic is another fun status move, but many of Weezing's typical switch-ins don't particularly care about being poisoned. Finally, Black Sludge can be used over Leftovers to mess up Trick users. Conversely, it will also mean that the Trick user will have another weapon to use against your team. Going physical on Weezing, even with Curse, is never a good idea, as, to put it lightly, Weezing's physical movepool is mind-numbingly awful.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Houndoom is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, threat to Weezing, due to its Flash Fire ability. Houndoom can easily switch into Will-O-Wisp or one of Weezing's Fire-type attacks to activate Flash Fire, giving it the perfect opportunity to set up Nasty Plot and rip giant holes through the opponent's team with insanely powerful Fire Blast attacks. Any Fire-type can give Weezing trouble since they resist Fire-type attacks and are immune to Will-O-Wisp, but Houndoom remains on the top of the list. Any Pokemon with a decent Special Attack stat and access to a Psychic-type attack will always give Weezing a ton of trouble because of its low Special Defense. Chansey doesn't care if it switches into a Will-O-Wisp because of Natural Cure and can easily stall out Weezing or cripple it with Thunder Wave. Pain Split can become extremely annoying, though. RestTalkers will have fun switching into Weezing since they can cure burn status and give Weezing a ton of trouble to harm them. RestTalkers that pack a boosting move and decent Special Defense, like Poliwrath, are most effective. The only downside to using a RestTalker that packs a boosting move is if Weezing carries Haze.</p>",

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>By focusing entirely on Weezing's lower Special Defense stat and trusting on his naturally high Defense to be sufficient without additional investment, Weezing becomes an effective check to a variety of attackers, both special and physical. In particular, this set is notoriously effective at checking the versatile Venusaur; from Swords Dance to specially-based variants. With the given EV spread, Weezing takes no more than 43.7% from Venusaur's Life Orb Leaf Storm, while Power Whip does even less and can be weakened further by burning Venusaur with Will-O-Wisp. With an immunity to Spikes and a neutrality to Stealth Rock, Weezing can switch in and out without taking any major residual damage, which really helps him in taking Venusaur's assaults. Weezing can also fend off other Grass-types, such as Sceptile, in the same manner.</p> <p>Even with the touched-up EV spread, Weezing is no slouch physically, having enough physical bulk to comfortably keep threats such as Torterra, Hitmonlee, Hitmontop, and Donphan at bay. Will-O-Wisp also somewhat balances this \"loss\" of physical bulk, allowing Weezing to burn overzealous physical attackers attempting to exploit this set's lack of investment in Defense. Sludge Bomb is Weezing's main attacking option, as it has STAB and hits many Pokemon for solid, neutral damage. It also has decent synergy with Will-O-Wisp; Steel-types, immune to Sludge Bomb, will find themselves fainting from Will-O-Wisp in a matter of turns if they lack a recovery move. Rest and Sleep Talk keep Weezing healthy while ensuring that he is not helpless while he is asleep, preventing him from being beaten by Sleep Powder Venusaur.</p> <p>Pain Split is Weezing's other option for recovering lost HP, but it is generally inferior to RestTalk on this set; since Weezing's defenses will most likely be called upon very often, the need for a more reliable means of recovery is much higher. A Fire move such as Fire Blast or Flamethrower alongside Thunderbolt or Sludge Bomb can grant good coverage, but Weezing isn't trying to be offensive here (note the lack of investment), and would generally prefer the more dependable fruits of Will-O-Wisp or RestTalk.</p> <p>Flash Fire users such as Arcanine, Houndoom, and Ninetales are the bane of this set, as they are more than able to comfortably switch into Will-O-Wisp and threaten Weezing with their deadly STAB moves. Milotic can patch up this issue, as its resistance to Fire, excellent defenses, and strong STAB Surf allow it to deal with the aforementioned threats. This two-man core is highly capable of dealing with many combinations of offensive threats, such as Venusaur (or Torterra) and Arcanine; however, Pokemon such as Mismagius and Alakazam can shred this tandem into pieces when played correctly. Using either Registeel or Spiritomb can resolve these issues nicely. While Registeel can add Stealth Rock to the mix, hampering Fire-types attempting to switch into Weezing, Spiritomb adds a valuable Psychic immunity, along with the ability to place Mismagius and Alakazam in a checkmate position with the threat of using either Pursuit or Shadow Sneak.</p>"

Will-O-Wisp and Haze enhance Weezing's walling capabilities further by permanently crippling his opponents or clearing away any stat boosts they may have acquired, respectively. With only one moveslot left, Pain Split is used as a means of recovering off any damage sustained.</p> <p>Fire Blast over Flamethrower is the same power vs. reliability argument that has come and gone through the generations. Most notably, Fire Blast will allow Weezing to 2HKO offensive Torterra, though its imperfect accuracy and low PP make it a lesser option in general, especially considering that Weezing will rarely need the extra power. Hidden Power Grass is another worthy attacking option, particularly for its ability to hit Rhyperior hard, but its power and coverage are otherwise lacking. Finally, RestTalk over Pain Split and Thunderbolt, with Sludge Bomb over Flamethrower for STAB, will grant Weezing greater survivability, but also cause him to lose out on important coverage.</p> <p>With no investment to counteract Weezing's poor Special Defense this time around, special attackers will easily be making their mark on Weezing's hide. Therefore, a special wall such as Chansey or Registeel will be invaluable when using this Weezing. Most of these Pokemon also have a weakness to Fighting-type attacks, which Weezing can conveniently patch up. Chansey also has access to Wish, and can use it to make Weezing's endurance even more formidable. A Dark-type, such as Drapion and Skuntank, to deal with the Psychic-types that Weezing normally lures in is also useful. Finally, even when they're physical, Flash Fire users are the bane of Weezing's existence. Therefore, packing a Water-type, like Milotic, or a Flash Fire user of your own, like Houndoom, will help immensely.</p>"

  "Trapinch": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Trapinch may seem like an inferior Dugtrio, it has a few advantages over the triple mole. Notably, Trapinch has higher Attack, and its low Speed makes it usable in Trick Room. Arena Trap is the main selling point for Trapinch, enabling it to trap the opposing Pokemon while threatening them with STAB Earthquake. Trapinch also, and thankfully, has an immunity to Electric-type attacks, which makes switching in a little easier. The main problem with Trapinch is the fact that it is quite literally unable to take any kind of hit (outside of said Electric attacks). Because of this, Trapinch is very difficult to switch in, and doesn't last very long in battle.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Trapinch has a very limited movepool, though there are a few options to consider. Substitute protects Trapinch from status, though if Trick Room is in effect, it's just wasting turns. Flail can be used late-game when Trapinch has been weakened by entry hazards or Life Orb recoil, hitting the opponent with a powerful Normal-type move with a Base Power of up to 200. Hyper Cutter is a viable ability, though using it forces Trapinch to lose the only thing that sets him apart from most other Ground-types: the ever-useful Arena Trap ability. An Adamant nature could be used with 252 Speed EVs and some Speed passing, though switching in Trapinch is extremely risky.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky Ground-types such as Donphan and Torterra take little damage from any of Trapinch's attacks, while they can threaten him with Ice Shard and Wood Hammer, respectively. Weezing is immune to Earthquake, and can use Will-O-Wisp to cripple Trapinch or damage it with Flamethrower. Cloyster can switch in pretty easily thanks to its huge Defense, and can swiftly KO Trapinch with Ice Shard. Spiritomb can burn Trapinch with Will-O-Wisp, while Sucker Punch will KO him. Almost any Pokemon with a priority move and the ability to switch in safely can KO Trapinch with ease, since its defenses are so awful that it will fall to almost any kind of hit.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room Trapper": {
        "description": "<p>To the common battler, Trapinch seems like a useless Pokemon who is essentially a waste of a team slot. However, it does have a niche in the UU metagame, albeit a very slight one: its low Speed and Arena Trap ability turn him into a good revenge killer when you have Trick Room set up. With a measly 22 Speed, nothing will outspeed Trapinch in Trick Room, unless it carries a priority move. Just beware when switching him in, as he is unable to take any kind of hit. Earthquake hits Registeel and Fire-types, though most Fire-types have priority (Arcanine with Extreme Speed, Blaziken with Vacuum Wave, and Houndoom with Sucker Punch). Crunch deals immense damage to Ghost- and Psychic-types, while Rock Slide is used to hit Flying-types who are immune to Earthquake. Bug Bite hits Dark- and Grass-types hard, and it also has the ability to steal an opposing Pokemon's Berry. Finally, Quick Attack may be used to finish off weakened foes, and brings some priority to the table which can be useful outside of Trick Room. Using a Choice Band gives Trapinch more power, though it doesn't score any notable KOs when compared to Life Orb. It cannot be stressed enough that Trapinch is extremely frail, so much so that he can't afford to take a single hit. Because of this, make sure you bring him in on an Electric-type attack or after a teammate has been KOed. An Exploding partner can manage to bring Trapinch in safely, too.</p> <p>0 Speed EVs and a Brave nature give Trapinch a grand total of 22 Speed, making it one of the slowest Pokemon in the tier (only Munchlax is slower). Max Attack EVs give Trapinch some much-needed power, while the rest of the EVs are placed into HP. Trapinch's defenses are so low that they aren't worth investing in.</p> <p>Trick Room support is vital to Trapinch's success, making it faster than every Pokemon in UU when it's set up. Claydol and Solrock are both excellent choices to set up Trick Room, as they can provide Stealth Rock and dual screens, then Explode afterwards, granting Trapinch a safe switch-in. More bulky partners include Porygon2 and Slowbro, both of which have access to Trick Room and a reliable recovery move.</p>"

  "Leafeon": {
    "overview": "<p>Leafeon's nearly unresisted coverage and auspicious stat distribution make it a very difficult Pokemon for some teams to handle. Leafeon smashes through prominent physical walls such as Slowbro, Donphan, and Milotic and only has approximately three solid counters in Registeel, Steelix, and Weezing. Unlike other UU sweepers, Leafeon doesn't suffer from one-dimensionality, as it can also run two very effective defensive sets to surprise its usual responses. After all of these factors are considered, it becomes clear that Leafeon is one of the most versatile Pokemon in the metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Leafeon has three useful support moves which were not mentioned in the above sets: Knock Off, Charm, and Tickle. Knock Off removes the foe's item, while both Charm and Tickle work to weaken physical attackers and generally force them to switch-out. Curse seems interesting, but you'll need to invest plenty of Special Defense EVs to get the best out of the set, and even then Registeel and Regirock do the job better because of their superior stat distributions for that role.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Weezing is the best Leafeon counter, as even a boosted Double-Edge will fail to OHKO it. Weezing can then strike back with Sludge Bomb or Will-O-Wisp, KOing or crippling Leafeon. Without Stealth Rock on the field, Houndoom and Arcanine can switch into Leafeon and threaten it out with their STAB attacks. Choice Scarf Moltres also breaks Leafeon successfully if it isn't switching into Stealth Rock recklessly. Should Leafeon lack Quick Attack, then faster Pokemon such as Espeon or Swellow can come in and force Leafeon to switch out with their powerful special and super effective attacks, respectively. Registeel completely walls Leafeon thanks to its pure Steel typing, and has access to Thunder Wave to neutralize Leafeon's beloved Speed. Steelix's enormous Defense stat lets it play similarly to Registeel against Leafeon, although it will still be taking respectable damage from boosted neutral Leaf Blade.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>With high Speed and Attack, Leafeon is capable of sweeping an opponent's team with Swords Dance. In contrast to other Swords Dance sweepers such as Venusaur, Leafeon's niche is to obtain a Swords Dance boost on physical attackers due to its enormous base 130 Defense. Furthermore, Leafeon boasts great type coverage in its movepool; in UU, Grass- and Normal-type coverage is only resisted by Registeel, Shedinja, and Drifblim.</p> <p>Leaf Blade is Leafeon's primary STAB move, and it is capable of OHKOing frequently used physical walls such as Slowbro, Milotic, and Donphan after a Swords Dance. Noteworthy physical walls that Leafeon cannot OHKO are Miltank and Steelix, but they are both 2HKOed and cannot significantly threaten Leafeon in return. Double-Edge is Leafeon's primary attacking move against Flying-, Grass-, and Fire-types, which will often try to switch into a resisted Leaf Blade. To better understand why Double-Edge is chosen over the recoilless Return, consider that it can OHKO Moltres and 252 HP Venusaur after a Swords Dance boost. It also deals around 60% to defensive Arcanine, which means that it can be OHKOed with a little residual damage and Stealth Rock in play. Additionally, Double-Edge cleanly 2HKOes specially defensive Weezing after a single boost.</p> <p>The final slot comes down to two moves: Synthesis and Quick Attack. Synthesis is preferred as it allows Leafeon to offset residual damage and the recoil taken from Double-Edge and Life Orb. Given its high Speed and ability to threaten many Pokemon, Leafeon can find itself using Synthesis repeatedly. Quick Attack can be a great option to strike frail and fast Pokemon; but generally, it will not OHKO unless the target has been weakened substantially.</p> <p>Stealth Rock support is essential since it makes it much tougher for Fire-, Bug-, and Flying-type Pokemon like Moltres, Scyther, and Altaria to repeatedly switch into Leafeon. Good Pokemon for setting up entry hazards for Leafeon are Regirock, Omastar, and Kabutops. Kabutops and Regirock can set up Stealth Rock and take on faster Fire- and Flying-type Pokemon that trouble Leafeon, while Omastar makes up for a general lack of offensive prowess by setting up both Spikes and Stealth Rock to facilitate Leafeon's sweep.</p> <p>Dugtrio makes a great partner alongside Leafeon because it can trap and 2HKO Registeel with Earthquake. Due to Leafeon's enormous 130 base Defense and high Speed, Registeel is much more likely to Thunder Wave than Iron Head, which gives Dugtrio an easier time switching in. Another defensive threat is Weezing, which can Haze Leafeon's boosts away, cut its attack with Will-O-Wisp, or attack with Sludge Bomb. Pairing Leafeon with Flash Fire users such as Houndoom and Arcanine allow it to sweep much easier; these Fire-types also have good type synergy with Kabutops and Omastar, which function well alongside Leafeon.</p>"
      },
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>Leafeon is one of the few Pokemon who can Baton Pass effectively due to its high Speed and exceptional Defense. Swords Dance is good for Leafeon to let it hit very hard and then pass it to a better sweeper for the situation if a hard counter comes in. Roar foils phazers such as Steelix or Drapion who would otherwise attempt to phaze Leafeon's boost before it can be passed. Synthesis can replace Roar if you prefer Leafeon to heal instead of stopping enemy phazers. Leaf Blade rounds out the set with an obligatory STAB attack; even with minimal EV investment, it can do surprisingly high damage to Slowbro, Donphan, and Milotic.</p> <p>Max Speed EVs allow Leafeon to Speed tie with Pokemon in the base 95 Speed category, which is especially important against Houndoom and Drapion. 132 HP and 120 Def help optimize Leafeon's bulk so that it can Baton Pass safely. As a testament to Leafeon's bulk, Jolly Life Orb Ambipom's Fake Out will only deal 33.55% - 39.80% to it.</p> <p>Leafeon's attempt to pass a Swords Dance boost may benefit from dual screens. Uxie makes an exceptional dual screen user due to its bulky stat distribution and fair Speed. After it drops both Reflect and Light Screen, it can U-turn to safely switch in Leafeon. Uxie can also set up Stealth Rock to help your Baton Pass recipient score crucial OHKOs. As for receivers, Rhyperior is one of the best thanks to Leafeon's ability to draw in Registeel, making it easier for Rhyperior to set up Rock Polish. Flash Fire Arcanine is also an excellent recipient of Swords Dance as it can score an additional boost with Flash Fire to really send its damage output over the top. Its offensive power meshed with high Speed, solid overall bulk, and a good movepool make it an excellent choice for your team.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Wall": {
        "description": "<p>Leafeon can be extremely effective in the UU tier as a physical wall thanks to its convenient resistances to Grass-, Water-, and Ground-type attacks. Leafeon's staggering base 130 Defense allows it to take on a number of potent physical threats including Feraligatr, Azumarill, Dugtrio, and Torterra. The icing on the cake, though, is having a reliable recovery move, a niche that other physical walls tend to lack.</p> <p>Leafeon has some useful support moves in its arsenal: Wish, Protect, Yawn, Roar, and Heal Bell. As a natural physical wall, Wish is too good to pass up on this set because it supports the entire team and acts as a reliable recovery move in conjunction with Protect. Yawn plays as a reliable scouting move, which quickly identifies the opposing team's responses to Leafeon and helps you form strategies in the long run. If Sleep Clause is in effect, Leafeon will be unable to phaze the foe with Yawn, so Roar is a good alternative. Heal Bell allows Leafeon to clean its entire team of status as needed, and can be invaluable in many situations. Leaf Blade provides Leafeon a way to dish out respectable damage to Pokemon such as Feraligatr and Azumarill, both of which are 2HKOed by Leaf Blade.</p> <p>To demonstrate Leafeon's bulk, here are some calculations:</p> <ul> <li>252 Atk Adamant Azumarill Ice Punch: 35.9% - 42.5%</li> <li>252 Atk Adamant +2 Feraligatr Return: 49.1% - 57.8%</li> <li>252 Atk Adamant +1 Feraligatr Ice Punch: 53.9% - 64.1%</li> <li>252 Atk Jolly Choice Band Dugtrio Stone Edge: 21.3% - 25.1%</li> <li>252 Atk Adamant Torterra Stone Edge: 24.9% - 29.3%</li> </ul> <p>Running Synthesis, Yawn, Roar, and Leaf Blade as the moveset allows Leafeon to circle through teams by alternating between Roar and Yawn to rack up entry hazard damage and potentially reveal your opponent's entire team. Synthesis fits in because it acts as an instant recovery move, as opposed to Wish which takes two turns. This version can perform much better with entry hazards on the field to rack up damage over time. Additionally, on any variant of this set, Return can be used over one of the supporting moves to patch up Leafeon's coverage and give it a way to deal damage to Pokemon like Venusaur when the need arises.</p> <p>A simple 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe spread with a Jolly nature can also be used. Combined with Leafeon's high Speed and great physical bulk, this spread can act as a reliable switch-in to Pokemon such as Absol and Hitmonlee, in addition to those it already checks respectably well. Leafeon can switch into their assaults and threaten them with STAB Leaf Blade before taking a hit in return.</p> <p>Having Spikes and Stealth Rock on the field at the same time is helpful for the entire team due to the fact that Leafeon is capable of forcing many switches. Stealth Rock is more important than Spikes in general because Fire- and Flying-types will switch in most frequently, and taking 25% or more per switch can prevent them from countering Leafeon over time. The best defensive choice for this role is Omastar, as it has good defensive synergy with Leafeon and can set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes.</p> <p>To prevent Fire-types--Blaziken and Magmortar in particular--from recklessly switching in on Leafeon and wreaking havoc, Milotic serves as a great partner to take them on. Milotic is capable of surviving Fire Blast followed up by Superpower from Blaziken and Fire Blast followed up by Thunderbolt from Magmortar, which allows Milotic to OHKO them both back with Surf. Despite its 252 HP EVs, Leafeon is rather naked on the special side, meaning that it will be maimed by even neutral special attacks. Chansey, with its great special bulk, can handle a significant portion of the special sweepers in the UU metagame. Registeel, additionally, can help against Mismagius, one of the specially offensive Pokemon that Chansey can't beat reliably. Registeel is also capable of setting up Stealth Rock while hitting Mismagius with Iron Head until it faints.</p>"

  "Glaceon": {
    "overview": "<p>Glaceon is a flawed Pokemon whose unique assets are somewhat overshadowed by its weaknesses. While STAB Ice attacks are very useful, Glaceon's limited movepool gives it few tools to abuse its huge Special Attack stat with. Glaceon's low Speed forces it to rely on its defenses, which, while decent, are largely wasted due to Glaceon's lack of resistances and multitude of weaknesses (including one from Stealth Rock).</p> <p>It's not all bad news, however. Glaceon finds a niche on hail teams, where it can abuse its immensely powerful Blizzard and avoid some attacks thanks to its Snow Cloak ability. The fact that nothing is immune to Ice, together with Glaceon's lack of coverage, means that more often than not it is preferable to abuse the boosts of Choice items rather than maintain the ability to switch attacks. Overall, few teams specifically prepare for Glaceon, which may just lead to their frosty doom.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Glaceon can work well as a recipient of Baton Passed boosts, especially Speed boosts. In this role, it can use the boosts for its own attacks and then pass them on when it gets low on health. Glaceon can equip a Life Orb and use its low Speed to run a Trick Room set with three attacks and Wish, although the lack of coverage means that it will be easy for the opponent to stall until Trick Room runs out. Wish can also fit on the Choice set over Baton Pass, especially if you have good switch-ins to Glaceon's common counters. With decent defenses and access to Heal Bell and Wish, Glaceon can run a defensive set, especially under hail conditions. However, it is generally outclassed by Articuno in a defensive role, who has much higher defenses, more resistances, Roost, and Pressure.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Glaceon's primary counters are Registeel, Chansey, and Milotic, although Milotic fears Specs Hidden Power Grass. Slowking deserves a special mention as a counter as any set without Hidden Power Grass or Shadow Ball will be walled endlessly by it. Most other Water-types do well, although those who lack reliable recovery will eventually succumb to repeated attacks and hail damage. Poliwrath is a good option since it can threaten Glaceon with Fighting-type attacks. Water/Ice-types, while rare, can easily take any attack that isn't Hidden Power Grass, and hit back with neutral Water-type attacks. Fire-types are decent checks, although they must be wary of Hidden Power Ground or Specs Water Pulse when switching in. Arcanine stands out among these as it has decent special bulk to cushion hits from Blizzard and even Hidden Power Ground. Hitmontop and Hitmonlee have the Special Defense to take a hit and can threaten back with super effective priority moves. Thick Fat Hariyama can easily take on Ice attacks and threaten back with STAB Fighting moves. Stealth Rock makes wearing down Glaceon much easier, as it will have to switch out a lot if it runs up against a bulky Ice resist.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>Glaceon's low Speed and high Special Attack make Choice Scarf the best option for its item. With a Choice Scarf and a Timid nature, Glaceon can outspeed Pokemon with a base Speed of 120, which includes all of UU and NU (except for Swellow and Electrode). Blizzard does plenty of damage even without a boost, making Glaceon a potent revenge killer under hail conditions. Many frail sweepers, such as Alakazam, are OHKOed by Blizzard after Stealth Rock, which means that Glaceon is extremely threatening to offensively oriented teams. This set can also be used with Choice Specs and a Modest nature, which shifts the focus from overwhelming sweepers to breaking past walls. Glaceon generally functions better in the former role, however, as it is easily revenge killed without Choice Scarf's Speed boost.</p> <p>Hidden Power Ground adds coverage against Fire-types and Aggron, and allows Glaceon to at least dent Registeel. Hidden Power Grass is only recommended in conjunction with Choice Specs, as the Special Attack boost is required in order to 2HKO Bold Milotic. Baton Pass allows Glaceon to scout its counters, and is extremely effective together with Dugtrio to trap Registeel and Fire-types. Ice Beam lets Glaceon function outside of hail, but Shadow Ball is an option to provide coverage on Slowbro and Slowking, as well as the rare Jynx and Grumpig. If you are using Choice Specs and Hidden Power Grass, you can use Water Pulse, which OHKOes most Fire-types after Stealth Rock damage. However, the low Base Power makes it generally unappealing.</p>"

  "Shiftry": {
    "overview": "<p>Shiftry is a very straightforward, dangerous Pokemon. Unfortunately, it is often underrated due to its stigma for being just another Sunny Day sweeper. Shiftry, however, has the ability to work both in and out of the sun; and, it has the ability to run both a physical and special sweeper set due to its terrifying boosting moves in Swords Dance and Nasty Plot, making it a force to be reckoned with. It may have poor defenses and a rather limited movepool, but most sweepers aren't meant to take hits and it has enough attacking options to work with, making this tengu sandal wearing, fan wielder a solid Pokemon overall.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Energy Ball can be used in the Nasty Plot set as an in-between for Grass Knot or Solar Beam; however, the prospective higher damage output of the other moves is more appealing. Shiftry may use Hidden Power Ice to OHKO Altaria on special attacking sets, but Hidden Power Fire is usually the better choice as it can hit a wider range of opponents. Shiftry's other special attacking moves include Shadow Ball, Extrasensory, and Focus Blast. While all have their uses, Shiftry is pressed for moveslot space as it is. Shiftry also has access to Rock Slide and Hidden Power Rock to help hit Fire-types, most notably Moltres and Arcanine, since the former resists Grass 4x and the latter will force Shiftry out more often than not with Intimidate and Extreme Speed. Using Rock Slide or Hidden Power Rock, however, leaves Shiftry susceptible to Fighting-types; therefore, sticking with the recommended movesets is the best idea. Shiftry has access to X-Scissor, Payback, and Bounce as other physical options for the Swords Dance set. X-Scissor is a good way to score a super effective hit on Grass-types, including Tangrowth and Leafeon, but the other moves listed are more useful. Payback and Bounce are both detrimental to Shiftry's cause; Payback requires Shiftry to go last for higher damage output and Bounce requires two turns to use, eating up precious Sunny Day turns. Quick Attack is useful as a reliable way for picking off faster threats, but Sucker Punch is more powerful and has STAB backing it up.</p> <p>Shiftry can also employ a SubSeeding strategy, especially in the sun when its Speed is doubled, but this role is better left to more defensive Grass-types like Tangrowth since Shiftry is more effective as a sweeper. With Choice Specs and Leaf Storm, Shiftry makes a fearsome hit-and-run Pokemon under the sun as well.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Arcanine, Blaziken, Toxicroak, and Hitmontop are the bane of Shiftry's existence. They have the ability to take anything but Explosion and KO Shiftry with super effective STAB attacks. Tangrowth is also a very good counter to the Swords Dance set, due to its colossal base 125 Defense and above-average base 100 HP, as well as a resistance to Seed Bomb and ability to handle Low Kick and then circumvent Sucker Punch by putting Shiftry to sleep with Sleep Powder. However, Tangrowth quickly dies to any special attacking set. Weezing is in the same boat as Tangrowth, but has Haze to erase Swords Dance boosts, and can KO Shiftry with a Fire-type move. The best way to deal with Shiftry is to just hit it outright and not let it set up; its defenses are mediocre at best and a decently powered STAB attack should cripple, if not KO, it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>This set makes use of Shiftry's higher Attack stat, which it can quickly boost with Swords Dance. Shiftry has six resistances and one immunity, so finding an opportunity to come in and set up shouldn't be too difficult. Using this set will require a decent amount of prediction, however, as Sucker Punch will only work when the opponent is using an attacking move. When your opponent tries to get around Sucker Punch by using non-damaging moves, you should respond either by using one of Shiftry's other attacking options or by further boosting its Attack with Swords Dance.</p> <p>Shiftry has a rare and powerful tool in its STAB Sucker Punch. Combined with STAB Seed Bomb to hit bulky Water- and Ground-types and Low Kick to hit Steel-types, Shiftry has the ability to hurt both walls and sweepers alike. Still, Shiftry's coverage is somewhat limited by the fact that both Sucker Punch and Low Kick are not consistent. Thanks to Sucker Punch, Shiftry can afford to run an Adamant nature, which allows it to pack quite a punch after a Swords Dance.</p> <p>Here are some damage calculations to demonstrate Shiftry's power.</p> <ul> <li>+2 Life Orb Seed Bomb vs 248/252+ Milotic: 132.8% - 156.2%</li> <li> <ul> <li>+2 Life Orb Seed Bomb vs 252/252+ Slowbro: 106.6% - 125.4%</li> </ul> </li> <li> <ul> <li>+2 Life Orb Seed Bomb vs 80/252+ Hariyama: 68.2% - 80.2%</li> </ul> </li> <li> <ul> <li>+2 Life Orb Sucker Punch vs 4/0 Toxicroak: 71.4% - 84.4%</li> </ul> </li> <li> <ul> <li>+1 Life Orb Sucker Punch vs 252/4 Hitmontop: 39.8% - 47%</li> </ul> </li> <li> <ul> <li>+2 Life Orb Sucker Punch vs 0/0 Blaziken: 77.1% - 90.7%</li> </ul> </li> <li> <ul> <li>+1 Life Orb Sucker Punch vs 252/252+ Arcanine: 50.8% - 59.6%</li> </ul> </li> <li> <ul> <li>+2 Life Orb Sucker Punch vs 252/84 Moltres: 80.9% - 95.6%</li> </ul> </li> <li> <ul> <li>+2 Life Orb Low Kick vs 252/0+ Steelix: 94.9% - 111.9%</li> </ul> </li> <li></li> </ul> <p>While not necessary, sun support will greatly aid this Shiftry, allowing it to reach 518 Speed, outspeeding pretty much anything in the metagame. Only faster Chlorophyll users and Choice Scarf users will outspeed Shiftry in the sun. Of these Pokemon, the most common is Jumpluff, who can outspeed Shiftry and either hit it with a 4x super effective U-turn or Encore Shiftry's Swords Dance. Sun support allows Shiftry to strike first with any of its moves, as opposed to just Sucker Punch. This reduces your reliance on Sucker Punch, so Shiftry can sweep much more reliably against an opponent who is trying to out-predict you with moves like Substitute or Will-O-Wisp. Sunshine will also hurt Toxicroak, who resists every move on this set, due to its Dry Skin ability.</p> <p>When considering Swords Dance Shiftry, you should evaluate the merits of using it over Absol, who sports a much higher Attack stat and Superpower for coverage. In general, Shiftry's advantages over Absol stem from its Grass typing, which provides key resistances to Water-, Grass-, Electric-, and Ground-type attacks. STAB Seed Bomb is an excellent weapon for taking out UU's physical walls, such as Donphan, Rhyperior, and Omastar. In addition, Shiftry has a much higher HP stat than Absol, giving it more chances to make use of its resistances. The choice between the two Pokemon is largely up to the style of play that you want to use with your Sucker Punch sweeper. If you prefer Absol's raw power and don't mind its frailty, it is usually the better choice. However, if you feel that extra bulk and resistances will be more helpful in setting up consistently, or find that Absol runs into too many problems against bulky Water- and Ground-types, then pick Shiftry.</p> <p>This set runs into problems against Pokemon who can outspeed it and set up Substitute or use status moves to circumvent Sucker Punch. Such Pokemon include Mismagius, Alakazam, Espeon, and Sceptile. Shiftry can still come out on top against these Pokemon, but it must predict their moves extremely well by using Seed Bomb as they use Substitute and using Sucker Punch when they decide to attack. Note that with Sunny Day support, this becomes a non-issue. Toxicroak resists every move on the set and can hit Shiftry super effectively with either of its STAB moves. Hitmontop is also a nuisance because it resists Sucker Punch and can hit Shiftry with priority moves of its own. However, these Fighting-types can be finished off if they've been somewhat weakened, as a +2 Sucker Punch hits hard even when resisted. Pokemon who resist Seed Bomb and Low Kick but not Sucker Punch, namely Moltres, Altaria, and Venusaur, can still cause this set problems if they avoid attacking Shiftry at predictable moments. Good teammates to counteract Moltres and Altaria are Milotic, Slowking, and Lanturn. Venusaur is difficult to counter outright, however, Registeel and specially-defensive Weezing have an easy time with most versions of Venusaur. Finally, Claydol and Uxie make good teammates to switch into the various Fighting-types of UU and both are excellent choices to provide Sunny Day and Stealth Rock support.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>This set is the special version of Swords Dance Shiftry; simply use Nasty Plot to boost Shiftry's Special Attack, and proceed to sweep. With sun support, Solar Beam is the recommended choice; however, if you feel keeping the sun up will be a daunting task, Grass Knot is available as a safe alternative. Be wary, however, as Lanturn takes far less damage from Grass Knot than from Solar Beam. Milotic and Blastoise are easily disposed of with either move, so the choice ultimately comes down to preference. Hidden Power Fire takes care of Steel- and Grass-types, while the final moveslot depends on your play-style. Dark Pulse is the secondary STAB move of choice while Explosion provides Shiftry with the opportunity to go out with a bang. Keep in mind that if the sun runs out, having a reliable STAB move in Dark Pulse makes it the more appealing choice. Dark Pulse also provides Shiftry with a way to bypass Fire-types who would wall the set otherwise.</p> <p>Although Shiftry is able to OHKO Registeel with a +2 Low Kick from the Swords Dance set, it is unable to do so with a Nasty Plot-boosted Hidden Power Fire, which only deals 72.5% - 85.7% damage in the sun. It is highly recommended that you employ Spikes and Stealth Rock support since Registeel will pose a problem should it survive and proceed to paralyze Shiftry with Thunder Wave.</p> <p>The same support as the Swords Dance set is needed for this set as well. Sun support is more prevalent to this set's success, so teammates who can reliably set it up are required. Uxie and Ambipom make good Sunny Day leads due to their great Speed. Qwilfish once again is a good choice for Spikes support in order to achieve a possible OHKO on Registeel. Altaria is needed since Shiftry doesn't have a priority move to circumvent Vacuum Wave users such as Blaziken and Toxicroak. Moltres again makes a good partner to switch into any bulky Grass-types who may stand in Shiftry's way; however, Hidden Power Fire should usually be enough to dispose of them.</p>"
      },
      "Attacking Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Shiftry is a useful Attacking Lead in UU due to its ability to KO and cripple many common leads, including Alakazam, Mesprit, Uxie, Cloyster, Omastar, and Qwilfish. Shiftry's strong offensive movepool, stats, and typing allow it to act as a cleaner as well, granting it superb mid- and late-game usability. Dark Pulse is Shiftry's most consistent STAB attack, and it also allows Shiftry to 2HKO the ever-common Uxie and Mesprit leads. With Leaf Storm being Shiftry's strongest STAB attack, it can effectively KO most Pokemon that don't resist it after a Dark Pulse. Low Kick helps damage Registeel, which would otherwise wall Shiftry completely. There are two possible options in the final moveslot. Explosion allows Shiftry to completely wipe out leads that it can't beat otherwise, such as Moltres and Arcanine. However, using Sucker Punch allows Shiftry to deal with Alakazam leads almost 100% of the time, and it also gives it an option to attack Moltres before dying, should you choose to keep Shiftry in.</p> <p>Focus Sash is the best item choice for this set because it allows Shiftry to heavily damage a large variety of leads and continue attacking after a potentially fatal blow from the opponent. Holding a Focus Sash also allows Shiftry to use Explosion more assuredly. Early Bird is the best choice for Shiftry's ability, as sleep moves are more common in UU than Sunny Day. The EV spread allows Shiftry to outrun 4 Speed Uxie and max Speed Omastar leads, with the remaining EVs pushed into Attack to increase the power of Low Kick and Explosion (or Sucker Punch). A Rash nature is required for the 2HKO on standard Uxie leads without weakening Explosion or slowing Shiftry down.</p> <p>The only unfortunate side-effect about using a Shiftry Anti-Lead set is that it has very serious four moveslot syndrome, with many of its lesser options being ousted from the set in favor of the main ones already listed. Protect is an option over Low Kick as it gives Shiftry a chance to beat Ambipom, provided that Shiftry holds a Focus Sash, but Shiftry is usually better off just switching. Extrasensory can hit Venusaur and Fighting-types hard, but there isn't really a place for it. Likewise, Hidden Power Rock can eliminate Moltres and Scyther while dealing heavy damage against any other Fire-type leads, but it doesn't fit into the set any better than Extrasensory.</p>"

  "Raticate": {
    "overview": "<p>Raticate has been the butt of many a joke over the years. While in some respects these jokes are true, Raticate is anything but a joke on the battlefield in DPP. With its ability, Guts, Raticate's Attack can reach sky-high levels; couple that with Raticate's naturally high Speed, and one has quite the potent sweeper. Raticate's only downfalls are its low defenses, its limited usable movepool, and the fact that it has some major competition from fellow Guts abusers such as Ursaring, Swellow, and Hariyama. Don't let the stigma of the beginner's rodent blind you to the fact that Raticate is very capable of sweeping teams with the right support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Other STAB moves in Raticate's repertoire include Return, Double-Edge, Quick Attack, and Last Resort. Return and Double-Edge are left out in favor of Facade's higher Base Power after the Toxic or Flame Orb has been activated. Quick Attack is Raticate's other available priority move, though Raticate needs as much type coverage as it can get, and the coverage provided by the priority Sucker Punch is just too good to pass up. Last Resort has a high Base Power, but it is unreliable and highly situational. Raticate's only other notable physical coverage moves are Flame Wheel and Zen Headbutt. Flame Wheel is Raticate's strongest attack on Registeel if Reversal is not at full power, but other than that, is utterly useless. Zen Headbutt can be used to hit Weezing super effectively and provide flinch hax, but Raticate has much more reliable moves available to it.</p> <p>Thunder Wave is an interesting choice for the last slot in the Guts set to paralyze faster threats on the switch. However, it is hard to use because most Raticate switch-ins are Rock-, Ground-, and Steel-types, most of which don't mind the paralysis. Taunt can be used as well to prevent Pokemon such as Rhyperior or Aggron from using Rock Polish in an attempt to sweep. While useful, it is very risky, as one false prediction would lead to Raticate's quick demise. Screech is another way in which Raticate can cause more switches and rack up more residual damage from Stealth Rock and Spikes.</p> <p>Finally, Raticate is capable of pulling off the infamous F.E.A.R. set. The acronym stands for Focus Sash, Endeavor, (Quick) Attack, Raticate (Rattata / Rodent). The idea is to allow the opponent to activate Raticate's Focus Sash and attack on the same turn with Endeavor, bringing the opponent down to 1 HP. On the next turn, Raticate is free to pick off the opponent with Quick Attack. The strategy is very difficult to accomplish due to the prevalence of Stealth Rock, which effectively renders Focus Sash useless, and Raticate being required to be slower than the opponent, diminishing one of Raticate's better qualities.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Rock- and Steel-types such as Registeel, Rhyperior, and Steelix are the biggest obstacles that stand between Raticate and a clean sweep. Weezing is another hard stop to any sweep that Raticate may attempt. Tangrowth and Leafeon take a large chunk of damage from Facade, but it's not enough to severely threaten them; in return, they can dispose of Raticate with Power Whip or Leaf Blade, respectively. Slowbro makes a good check to non-Swords Dance Raticate since it can take most of Raticate's attacks relatively well, heal off any damage with Slack Off, and remove Raticate with Surf. Physically defensive Spiritomb is another Pokemon that can stop Raticate in its tracks, removing it with Pursuit or Sucker Punch. Additionally, defensive Fighting-types such as Hitmontop and Hariyama can survive Raticate's assaults and hit it for super effective damage with their STAB attacks. Finally, Hitmonlee, Primeape, and Blaziken holding a Choice Scarf can get the jump on Raticate and eliminate it; however, all three are easily OHKOed by Raticate's boosted Facade should they attempt to switch into it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Guts": {
        "description": "<p>Depending on how one wants to use Raticate's Guts-boosted power, with this set, Raticate can be played in two ways: as either a scout or a late-game sweeper. If played as a scout, Raticate should come in during early-game on something it forces out, such as Chansey, and activate its ability. When the opponent reveals their Raticate counter, Raticate should use U-turn to switch to the appropriate teammate and keep momentum on your side of the battle. Facade is the STAB move of choice because after the Flame or Toxic Orb has been activated, its Base Power reaches 210 (with STAB factored in). To demonstrate Facade's power, Raticate is able to 2HKO Milotic and OHKO Chansey after Stealth Rock with a Guts boost under its belt. Sucker Punch is the recommended choice for the second slot as it allows Raticate to deal good damage to Pokemon that are faster than it, such as Sceptile, Alakazam, and Mismagius. Crunch can be used in place of Sucker Punch since it is Raticate's strongest and most reliable move against Rotom and Spiritomb.</p> <p>If using Raticate as a late-game sweeper, Reversal can be used in U-turn's spot to hit Rhyperior and Registeel for super effective damage once Raticate's health has been diminished sufficiently through poison or burn damage. Finally, Swords Dance can be used in the last slot over Protect to provide Raticate with the power to OHKO the majority of the UU metagame that doesn't resist Facade. However, Protect is the recommended choice to allow Raticate to safely activate its Orb of choice and scout the opponent's next move.</p> <p>The choice between Toxic Orb and Flame Orb is rather arbitrary in Raticate's case. Flame Orb is more appealing if you plan on keeping Raticate on the battlefield for an extended period of time; Toxic Orb is the more attractive option if you plan on keeping Raticate in for less than three turns, as after that, the damage from Toxic Orb will outweigh the damage from Flame Orb. Thanks to Raticate's ability, Guts, it is not affected by the Attack drop normally induced by the burn from its Flame Orb, so either option is a safe bet.</p> <p>Jolly is the required nature as it allows Raticate to outspeed base 95s and below such as Houndoom and Rotom. Pursuit can be used in place of Crunch or Sucker Punch, but odds are that most Pokemon will not be immediately threatened by Raticate and won't switch out, so the reliability of the other moves is preferred. Grass Knot can be used to 2HKO Omastar, Kabutops, and Rhyperior, but other than that, offers little coverage and damage output. Super Fang can be used in the last slot to strip Registeel, Weezing, Rhyperior, and Regirock switch-ins of half their health, but then Raticate is forced to simply U-turn out afterward.</p> <p>Raticate is utterly walled by Rock- and Steel-types, so providing it with good teammates to eliminate them is recommended. Dugtrio and Hitmontop are prime examples of such teammates; Dugtrio is able to trap its victims, such as Registeel, and cleanly dispose of them with Earthquake, while Hitmontop can buffer any physical attacks with Intimidate and proceed to unleash STAB Close Combats on the opposing Pokemon. Raticate is also stopped cold by physically defensive Weezing. Claydol is an excellent teammate to scare out Weezing with STAB Psychic, while also providing Stealth Rock or Rapid Spin support. Ghost-types such as Mismagius and Spiritomb are valuable teammates as they are immune to Fighting-type attacks that Raticate will likely encounter. Finally, Registeel makes a great partner as it can switch into a multitude of faster threats, such as Sceptile, Swellow, Scyther, Manectric, and Mismagius, and paralyze them with Thunder Wave. Registeel can also provide useful Stealth Rock support.</p>"

  "Fearow": {
    "overview": "<p>Fearow is one of the worst Normal / Flying Pokemon in the game. He is outclassed by Dodrio, who is stronger; Swellow, who is much quicker and has Guts; and, to a lesser extent, Pidgeot, who is significantly bulkier. Furthermore, all three of the aforementioned birds also have access to Brave Bird, a critical move that Fearow lacks. Fearow is quite frail and weak to Stealth Rock, so don't expect him to stay alive for much of the battle, either. To make matters worse, Fearow's ability, Keen Eye, is practically useless, as accuracy-reducing moves are almost never seen. It's not all bad news for Fearow, however; he has a decent Attack stat and excellent Speed for UU, and he can be an effective Choice Band user thanks to his access to U-turn.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fearow has a few more options, but he is usually outclassed by other Pokemon in these areas. He can run a Baton Pass set with Agility and Substitute, but Lopunny, Ambipom, Dodrio, and Gligar are all much better in that role. Offensively, Steel Wing is an option to hit Rock-types for super effective damage, but Fearow fails to deal respectable damage with it to Rhyperior and Regirock. Feint Attack or Assurance can be used for hitting Psychic- and Ghost-types, but most of them are hit just as hard by Fearow's other moves. Pluck, Aerial Ace, Sky Attack, and Fly are alternative Flying-type attacks that Fearow can use, but they are all outclassed by Drill Peck. Roost can be used to recover HP, but Fearow isn't really bulky enough to make use of it. Toxic and Attract are possible support options, and Mirror Move is interesting, though not altogether useful. Finally, Fearow has a few usable special attacks in Tri Attack, Heat Wave, and Hidden Power, but with Fearow's pitiful Special Attack stat, these moves are not recommended.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fearow has a lot of counters due to his poor defenses and lack of offensive power. Rock- and Steel-types, such as Registeel, Aggron, Steelix, Rhyperior, and Regirock, take minimal damage from Fearow's attacks and can KO him with ease. Aggron and Rhyperior can also use Rock Polish to boost their Speed while Fearow flees, turning into dangerous offensive threats at Fearow's expense. Donphan is also a decent counter, as he is quite bulky and can hit Fearow with Ice Shard and Stone Edge. Rotom is a great counter too, resisting Fearow's STAB attacks and being able to OHKO back with STAB Thunderbolt.</p> <p>There are some frail and fast sweepers who cannot switch into Fearow, but if they come after a KO or predict a weak attack, can outspeed and KO Fearow if he isn't carrying a Choice Scarf. Examples of these Pokemon include Alakazam, Mismagius, Espeon, and Manectric. Fearow is also outsped and KOed by many common Choice Scarf users.</p> <p>When holding a Choice Scarf, Fearow often lacks the power necessary to OHKO the opponent's Pokemon, and with Fearow's frailty, he will take heavy damage from any counterattack. Rotom and Moltres often carry Choice Scarves of their own, and will outspeed and OHKO Fearow unless he runs a Jolly nature.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Fearow's good Attack, awesome Speed, and access to U-turn, a Choice Band set is viable. Return is a very strong STAB move that does good damage to any Pokemon who doesn't resist it. Fearow doesn't learn Brave Bird, so Drill Peck is his best Flying-type attack, hitting Grass-, Bug-, and Fighting-types hard. U-turn is great for scouting, and is one of Fearow's few advantages over Dodrio. Quick Attack is helpful for finishing off faster Pokemon who are low on health. Pursuit can be used to trap Ghost- or Psychic-type Pokemon, but many of them can simply outspeed and KO Fearow.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Fearow's offensive capabilities. A Jolly nature is preferred, as it lets Fearow outspeed important threats, such as max Speed Hitmonlee, Rotom, and Houndoom. An Adamant nature is also acceptable, however, as Fearow always appreciates the extra power. Choice Scarf can be used over Choice Band, since Fearow reaches 448 Speed with an Adamant nature, enough to outspeed most other Choice Scarf users. With a Choice Scarf, Fearow can outspeed and KO Sceptile, Alakazam, and Choice Scarf Adamant Hitmonlee. However, without a boost, Fearow lacks the power needed to KO many Pokemon, allowing them to take his hits and KO him in return.</p> <p>Fearow has significant trouble getting past Rock-, Electric-, and Steel-types. For that reason, Donphan is a great teammate for Fearow, because he can KO Aggron and other Steel- and Rock-types with his STAB Earthquake. Donphan is also able to switch into Rock- and Electric-type attacks aimed at Fearow, while Fearow can destroy the Grass-types whom Donphan fears in return. Dugtrio is another option, since he can trap the Pokemon who give Fearow problems and KO them with Earthquake. Rhyperior and Torterra also make good partners, as they can easily set up with Rock Polish against most of Fearow's counters and proceed to sweep your opponent's team.</p> <p>With Fearow's poor defenses and weakness to Stealth Rock, almost any neutral attack will OHKO him if he switches in on it when Stealth Rock is up. For that reason, Rapid Spin support is necessary. Hitmontop is a reliable Rapid Spinner, thanks to Foresight, and can take the Rock-type attacks directed at Fearow; Donphan is also a good option for this role. While Fearow hates Stealth Rock placed on his side of the field, he greatly appreciates entry hazards on the opponent's side. Donphan is again a great choice to supply this, as his excellent physical bulk gives him plenty of opportunities to set up Stealth Rock. Rhyperior, Aggron, Omastar, and Uxie are great options too, thanks to their ability to set up entry hazards easily.</p>"

  "Sandslash": {
    "overview": "<p>Sandslash has a tough time competing for a team slot with Donphan, who boasts superior stats in everything but Speed. However, Sandslash does have a few advantages over his tusked counterpart, namely access to Swords Dance and a rare ability, Sand Veil. Sandslash's unique access to both Rapid Spin and Swords Dance (a combination only shared by Kabutops in UU) allows him to support the team and sweep when given the opportunity. Sandslash is quite effective on sandstorm-based teams, because Sand Veil boosts Sandslash's evasion by 20%, potentially allowing Sandslash to avoid an attack that would normally KO him. Sandslash may be burdened with low Speed and Special Defense, and he may even face serious competition with Donphan, but he is still a solid choice if you want a reliable defensive Ground-type Pokemon or a powerful offensive sandstorm sweeper.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Moveset-wise, there isn't much else that Sandslash can do without being outclassed by other Pokemon. He can run a Choice Band set, but he is entirely outclassed by Donphan in that respect, as Donphan boasts more power. Toxic is an option on the defensive set if you want Sandslash to cripple bulky switch-ins. X-Scissor is an option on the offensive sets, as it does decent damage to Grass-types. Finally, Safeguard is an option if your team really hates status afflictions.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky Grass-types in general are capable of switching into Sandslash with ease and threatening him with their STAB attacks. Tangrowth only takes 30.4% - 35.9% damage from +2 Stone Edge and KOes back with STAB Power Whip or Leaf Storm. Leafeon and Torterra can easily switch into Sandslash and set up in his face. Bulky Water-types are also great counters to Sandslash, as they can usually shrug off his attacks and threaten him with STAB Surf. Milotic and Slowbro do not mind boosted Earthquakes and are capable of OHKOing Sandslash with Surf. Moltres is able to comfortably switch into most of Sandslash's attacks and destroy him with STAB Fire Blast. Weezing is an effective counter, as it can switch into any of Sandslash's moves and cripple him with a burn. However, Weezing needs to watch out for Sandslash who carry Substitute as he will actually beat Weezing one-on-one unless he carries Flamethrower. Typically, strong special attackers carrying a Grass-, Ice-, or Water-type move can usually dispose of Sandslash without too much difficulty.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Sandslash's unique access to both Swords Dance and Rapid Spin helps him differentiate himself from Donphan as a bulky Ground-type Rapid Spinner. Sandslash is typically used as a physical wall and spinner, acting similarly to Donphan but having the ability to go on the offensive at any given time. Swords Dance boosts Sandslash's already decent Attack stat to powerful levels, making him capable of doing some serious damage to even the bulkiest of walls. Rapid Spin allows Sandslash to remove entry hazards on his side of the field, which greatly aids his team. Earthquake is his primary STAB move and deals solid damage after a Swords Dance boost, even without an Attack-boosting item; Earthquake cleanly OHKOes standard Registeel and, with a little residual damage, OHKOes Steelix and defensively oriented Rhyperior as well. Night Slash is useful for dealing with Ghost-type Pokemon who attempt to block Sandslash's Rapid Spin. After a Swords Dance, even the bulkiest Rotom sets are OHKOed by +2 Night Slash. Stone Edge, on the other hand, is useful for taking out Flying-type Pokemon who attempt to switch into Earthquake.</p> <p>Leftovers is the item of choice since it gives Sandslash significantly more staying power, but Lum Berry is useful for avoiding status momentarily and allows Sandslash to consistently beat bulky Ghost-types who attempt to cripple him with Will-O-Wisp. An alternative EV Spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def with an Impish nature may be used for a weaker but bulkier Sandslash. By doing so, Sandslash may gain more chances of setting up Swords Dance, which could either help negate the power lost or make Sandslash even stronger than before.</p> <p>Sandslash is easily countered by bulky Water-types like Milotic and Slowbro, as they can easily take a boosted Earthquake and OHKO Sandslash in return with their STAB Water-type moves. A bulky Grass-type is an effective partner for dealing with the aforementioned threats, so pairing Sandslash with Venusaur or Torterra is recommended. Strong special attackers like Moltres have an easy time switching into Sandslash on a Swords Dance, Earthquake, or Rapid Spin and obliterating him with powerful STAB attacks. Chansey can help safeguard against special attackers with her incredible special bulk while also paralyzing them with Thunder Wave. Grass-types can deal with Sandslash without much trouble as they resist Earthquake, allowing them to freely set up on him. Torterra and Leafeon can either destroy Sandslash with their STAB moves of choice or set up with Rock Polish or Swords Dance, respectively. Weezing can also switch in with ease and threaten Sandslash with Will-O-Wisp. Moltres himself is a fine partner to Sandslash, as it can switch into most Grass-types and Weezing easily, and roast them with STAB Fire Blast, while Sandslash can return the favor by removing Stealth Rock from the field with Rapid Spin.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Despite facing serious competition from other Ground-type Sword Dancers, Sandslash is able to set himself apart due to Sand Veil. The evasion boost from Sand Veil is highly important to his success, as it gives him the ability to beat his counters by potentially avoiding attacks that would otherwise be fatal. Swords Dance increases Sandslash's Attack to an impressive 656, which allows him to 2HKO all of his counters and become a significant threat to the opposing team. Earthquake is the bread and butter STAB attack of choice that deals amazing damage to any Pokemon not resistant or immune to it. Stone Edge is an excellent coverage move when paired alongside Earthquake, as it gives Sandslash a way to deal with troublesome Flying-types and Levitating Pokemon. Substitute is highly important to this set's success, as it lets Sandslash scout for his counters and gives him an opportunity to dodge an incoming attack without risking his own life if he fails. If Sandslash succeeds in dodging his counter's attack, then he can freely set up a Swords Dance.</p> <p>Bright Powder is the main item on this set, as it goes hand in hand with Sand Veil. The combined evasion boosts give Sandslash a 28% chance to dodge incoming attacks, and that's just against those with otherwise perfect accuracy. The evasion boost is compounded even further versus attacks with less than perfect accuracy, such as Power Whip and Will-O-Wisp. Leftovers can be used if you want a bulkier Sandslash, and it's useful for healing HP lost from Substitute. The EVs are pretty straightforward: 252 Atk EVs and an Adamant nature are used for maximum power, 212 Speed EVs are used to outspeed nearly all defensive variants of Milotic, and the rest is dumped into HP for more bulk.</p> <p>This set absolutely requires Hippopotas support to provide permanent sandstorm in order to function. Despite the rather large evasion boost, keep in mind that bulky Water- and Grass-types are still effective counters to Sandslash 72% of time. Weezing is also a pain for Sandslash to deal with if he is carrying Flamethrower or Fire Blast. Should a counter switch into Sandslash while he is behind a Substitute, Sandslash can opt to Substitute again to increase the odds of the opposing Pokemon eventually missing. Conventional Weezing counters like Houndoom and Moltres are not as effective with this set, as sandstorm adds unwanted residual damage and limits their effectiveness. Cradily is an excellent partner to Sandslash, as it receives a sizable Special Defense boost in sandstorm and is capable of beating both bulky Water- and Grass types. As a bonus, Cradily is capable of taking on Moltres, who otherwise threatens to OHKO Sandslash.</p> <p>Excessive use of Substitute will quickly wear out Sandslash, so pairing Sandslash with a Wish user is recommended in order to replenish lost HP. Clefable, Chansey, and Leafeon are all recommended due to their ability to deal with some of Sandslash's counters. Clefable stands out as the only Pokemon of the aforementioned three whom is immune to sandstorm, and she is also capable of dealing with most of the above threats with ease.</p>"

      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Sandslash can put his good defenses to use by serving as a solid Ground-type support Pokemon. Not only is Sandslash capable of removing entry hazards, but his above-average physical bulk allows him to check prominent physical sweepers such as Rhyperior, Swords Dance Toxicroak, and Hitmonlee. Stealth Rock provides immediate support for the team, aiding your team's sweepers with much appreciated residual damage. Rapid Spin helps Sandslash's teammates preserve their health by clearing away entry hazards. Earthquake is his main STAB attack and is at least strong enough to noticeably hurt frail Pokemon. Access to Night Slash makes it somewhat difficult for Ghost-types to block Sandslash's Rapid Spin, as Night Slash hits Rotom and Mismagius hard even with no EV investment in Attack.</p> <p>You can replace Night Slash with Stone Edge so that Sandslash can better deal with powerful Flying-types who would otherwise easily switch into him. Unfortunately, replacing Night Slash removes one of Sandslash's niche advantages over Donphan: the advantage of being able to reliably hit Levitating Ghost- and Psychic-types for super effective damage. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 204 Def / 32 SpD / 20 Spe can be used in order for Sandslash to outrun any Lanturn who does not invest in Speed, survive a Surf, and 2HKO back with Earthquake.</p> <p>Sandslash pairs up well with bulky Water- and Grass-types like Milotic and Venusaur, as they can take incoming Water- and Ice-type attacks and Grass-type attacks respectively. Moltres is also a good partner, as it appreciates the removal of Stealth Rock and threatens Grass-types with its STAB moves. Wish support is also helpful for this Sandslash, as without a reliable way to restore his HP, he will be worn out quickly. Leafeon, Clefable, and Chansey are great examples of Wish users who have decent synergy with Sandslash. Although he shares an Ice weakness, Leafeon has the advantage of attacking Water-types for super effective damage. Clefable and Chansey have Thunder Wave to slow down faster threats for Sandslash to outspeed.</p>"

  "Ninetales": {
    "overview": "<p>While there is no shortage of Fire-types in UU, Ninetales has some unique attributes that help it stand out from the crowd. It boasts one of the largest movepools of any Fire-type, including assets like Nasty Plot, Hypnosis, and Energy Ball. This movepool, combined with Ninetales's decent bulk and Special Attack, allows it to overcome the biggest threats to UU Fire-types: bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Milotic. These unique characteristics enable Ninetales to step out of the shadows of its more popular Fire-type brethren and take center stage as a powerful special attacker or status inducer.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ninetales has few other viable move choices, although some can prove useful. Dark Pulse has more coverage than Extrasensory but its damage output never exceeds that of a STAB Fire Blast or Overheat. Grudge can be useful against walls and sweepers to drain the PP of one of their attacks. Calm Mind is also available, but Nasty Plot's +2 Special Attack boost is much more useful on a frail sweeper.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Chansey is by far the best counter to Ninetales; her massive Special Defense and HP stats make brute force from offensive sets useless, while her ability, Natural Cure, erases any status effects Ninetales would have hoped to inflict. In a similar vein, Altaria has no problem sponging special attacks from Ninetales, and boasts Natural Cure as well. Unlike Chansey, it can also KO Ninetales much faster with a super effective Earthquake. However, one must be wary of switching in Altaria after Ninetales gets a Nasty Plot boost; +2 Hidden Power Rock will 2HKO Altaria after Stealth Rock damage. Clefable can survive a +2 Life Orb Fire Blast from Ninetales and cripple it with paralysis, but must beware of Hypnosis and will have trouble damaging Ninetales significantly. Thick Fat Hariyama will also be able to overpower Ninetales.</p> <p>Flash Fire Pokemon like Arcanine and Houndoom are also decent answers to Ninetales, especially the Choice Specs set once it has locked itself into a Fire- or Grass-type attack. Blaziken, too, is able to switch in with relative ease and immediately threaten Ninetales with Stone Edge or Superpower. Substitute + Roost Moltres can also handle Ninetales thanks to its ability to outstall the fox. However, Arcanine, Houndoom, and Moltres must be wary of Hidden Power Rock, while Blaziken must beware of Extrasensory. Bulky Water-types are generally good counters as they resist Fire, but they must watch out for a +2 Energy Ball. Milotic can absorb status very well (even better if it is a RestTalk variant), as can the lesser-seen Mantine, which deserves a special mention as it is one of the few UU Water-types that is neutral to Energy Ball while still resisting Fire Blast. Lanturn can also deal with an unboosted Ninetales extremely well, since it can 2HKO any variant after Stealth Rock and eliminate any status problems it might cause with Heal Bell.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Lure": {
        "description": "<p>This is Ninetales's flagship set, which allows it to act as an effective lure for bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Slowbro while also functioning as a sweeper. With a minor investment in its HP, Ninetales is able to take on and defeat the usual Fire-type counters after a Nasty Plot boost. Fire Blast is Ninetales's best STAB move in terms of sweeping, especially since Ninetales doesn't have maximum Special Attack investment. Energy Ball is Ninetales's most important coverage move, and is the key reason why Ninetales is able to take on Water-types. Hidden Power Rock is for Altaria and opposing Fire-types, like Arcanine and Moltres. Fire-, Grass-, and Rock-type coverage also gets perfect coverage in UU.</p> <p>The EV spread allows Ninetales to survive a 0 SpA Milotic's Surf 100% of the time, even after Stealth Rock damage thanks to Leftovers, and hit back with a +2 Energy Ball for a 2HKO. It also allows Ninetales to outspeed base 95 Speed Pokemon with a boosting nature. In addition to Nasty Plot, Ninetales can also nab another power boost by switching into Fire-type attacks, thanks to its Flash Fire ability. This will make its Fire Blast very difficult to wall, especially after Nasty Plot.</p> <p>Ninetales greatly appreciates Stealth Rock support, as it weakens most of its other counters to the point where Ninetales can easily KO them. Ninetales especially likes partners that can weaken Water-types to make sweeping easier and lure Fire-types so it can grab a Flash Fire boost. Grass-types such as Venusaur, Tangrowth, and Leafeon are perfect for this. Toxicroak works as well, since its Dry Skin ability allows it to heal itself by switching into Water-type attacks. It also smites Ninetales' biggest counters: Clefable and Chansey. However, Toxicroak may also lure in Ground-types, so be careful when using it.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>With a single Nasty Plot boost, Ninetales reaches 522 Special Attack, which is just good enough for sweeping mid- to late-game. Switch Ninetales in on a Fire-type attack for a free switch in and begin boosting with Nasty Plot. For which attack to use, Fire Blast is Ninetales's main STAB attack, though Flamethrower is a perfectly fine substitute for more reliability. Energy Ball hits Water-, Ground, and Rock-type Pokemon super effectively. Hypnosis is a valuable (if somewhat unreliable) asset, as it can be used freely as your opponent switches out to a counter, and may grant Ninetales a free turn to boost with Nasty Plot. Hidden Power Rock covers Moltres, Altaria, and other Flash Fire Pokemon, though its coverage is less potent than Hypnosis's crippling effect.</p> <p>Another option over Hypnosis is Substitute; Ninetales can boost its Special Attack from behind a Substitute without fearing status or damage. Since Ninetales' physical defense is rather low, it is best to use attacks with high accuracy. However, Flamethrower may miss out on OHKOing standard Registeel, since it only deals 87.9% - 103.8%.</p> <p>Life Orb is used to squeeze out all of Ninetales's sweeping potential, as it appreciates every bit of power it can get. If Hidden Power Rock is used, an EV spread of 36 HP / 252 SpA / 220 Spe is an option as Hidden Power Rock lowers Ninetales' Speed IV; running maximum Speed still won't allow Ninetales to tie with other base 100s. With 220 Speed EVs, Ninetales will always outpace positive natured base 95s. Maximum Special Attack must always be used with this set, since Ninetales is aiming to sweep through the opposing team. The remaining EVs are simply shunted into HP to increase overall bulk and make setup slightly easier.</p> <p>Ninetales works well as part of a Fire-Water-Grass team core. One helpful teammate includes Venusaur, which can switch into and immediately threaten bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Slowbro. These same bulky Water-types function well as teammates, since they can easily sponge attacks aimed at Ninetales and threaten Altaria, which resists both Energy Ball and Fire Blast. Milotic becomes an even better choice should you forgo Hidden Power Rock, since it can check the likes of Altaria, Blaziken, Houndoom, and Moltres effectively. Blastoise is also a great Water-type teammate that is capable of adding not only defensive synergy to your team, but also Rapid Spin support - something Ninetales should have in order to sweep uninhibited. Taking down Clefable and Chansey is nigh impossible for Ninetales, which is why Hariyama is a good teammate. Its STAB Fighting-type attacks and Guts allow it to deftly handle these threats. Moreover, it can deal with Houndoom, which may try to nab a Flash Fire boost on the switch in.</p>"
      },
      "Double Status": {
        "description": "<p>Ninetales's support movepool also allows it to pull off a double status set quite effectively. Start off with Hypnosis to sleep a foe then cripple the next switch-in, hopefully a physical attacker, with Will-O-Wisp. Energy Ball and your choice of STAB fill out the rest of the moveset, providing Ninetales with the best coverage it can get should it find an opportunity to pick off a foe. Pain Split can be used over Energy Ball if you feel that being able to heal off damage (albeit, somewhat unreliably) would be helpful.</p> <p>Wide Lens is almost mandatory when using this set, due to Hypnosis's and Will-O-Wisp's low accuracy. Since this Ninetales isn't looking to stay in and sweep, Overheat is a perfectly viable attack choice. Fire Blast is better if you want Ninetales to function as both a supporter and a sweeper, since it doesn't lower Ninetales's Special Attack, but with no Special Attack investment, this is still unlikely to have much of an impact. The EV spread allows Ninetales to outrun max Speed base 95s such as Drapion while getting as much bulk as possible out of the remainder.</p> <p>This set's ideal teammates are those that form the Fire-Water-Grass combination, which creates strong team synergy. Specifically, Torterra is able to function well with Double Status Ninetales as it can set up Stealth Rock, which is very useful when using a set that causes as many switches as this one does. It is also suggested that your Water-type has the potential to overcome Morning Sun Arcanine, since it resists or is immune to three of the moves in the moveset. Using a Utility Blastoise with Roar is highly recommended, since it can shuffle your opponent's team and Rapid Spin away entry hazards that ruin Ninetales. Just be sure you don't use Yawn in the third moveslot; it will fail if Ninetales has already put something to sleep.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>One can avoid the shaky accuracy of Hypnosis and the hassle of setting up Nasty Plot boosts by having Ninetales hold Choice Specs. Overheat is more useful early-game, where Ninetales will be switching more often, while Fire Blast becomes a better choice late-game, where Ninetales will want to be sweeping unimpeded. Energy Ball does the same job here as it does on the other sets, cleaning up bulky Water- and Rock- types. Extrasensory, while not commonly seen, does give Ninetales a way to take down Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Blaziken. Hidden Power Rock helps out with other Fire-types as well as Flying-types.</p> <p>The given EV spread allows Ninetales to outspeed base 95 Speed Pokemon, since the 30 Speed IV caused by Hidden Power Rock means outspeeding anything faster is impossible. The leftover EVs are placed in HP, but could also be put back into Speed if opposing Ninetales are of concern. If you decide to use an attack other than Hidden Power Rock, a simple 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe spread could be adopted to reach the next Speed tier.</p> <p>Being locked into a single move often results in a lot of switching, something no Fire-type enjoys doing with Stealth Rock around. Therefore, it is recommended that you add a Rapid Spinner to your team. Cloyster is able to fill this role and can also set up its own entry hazards to help make sweeping easier. Bulky Hitmontop is a fair choice too, since it can hit enemy Rock-types super effectively or employ a Foresight + Rapid Spin combination that can only be stopped by a double-Ghost team.</p>"

  "Golbat": {
    "overview": "<p>Crobat's little brother, Golbat, may seem like a strange choice due to its NFE status. However, Golbat is able to play the same role as Crobat within the lower tiers. Inner Focus allows Golbat to counter Ambipom leads, making it quite effective in the metagame. Furthermore, access to Taunt allows Golbat to shut down set-up leads such as Qwilfish, who try to lay entry hazards. Golbat's typing allows it to switch into the likes of Venusaur, Hitmontop, and Torterra with ease, resisting or being immune to many of their attacks. Nevertheless, as Golbat is part Flying-type, it has a weakness to Stealth Rock. Another downside to Golbat's typing is its weakness to the common Ice-, Electric-, Rock-, and Psychic-type moves of the UU metagame, giving it a hard time switching in. What sets Golbat apart from other Flying-types such as Swellow and Moltres, however, is that it has access to Taunt and Hypnosis. If you can cover Golbat's many weaknesses, it can become a great asset to your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Golbat may use Choice items to some success, though its physical movepool is nothing spectacular, limiting it to Brave Bird, U-turn, Steel Wing, Zen Headbutt, and Pursuit. Haze is another option to reset stat boosts, but Golbat lacks the opportunity to use support moves most of the time due to its lackluster defenses. Substitute may be used with Roost to stall opponents, along with Toxic Spikes or Toxic to wear down walls such as Chansey, Slowbro, and Milotic. Super Fang is useful in stripping walls of half their health, which is useful against the likes of Registeel and Steelix. Finally, Screech can be used to lower the opponent's Defense, making Golbat's attacks more powerful, while forcing switches at the same time.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The main way to beat Golbat is to figure out what set it's running. All of its physical sets can be defeated by Steel-types, such as Registeel and Steelix, as they can wall Golbat forever due to their massive Defense and resistance to Brave Bird. Registeel can wear it down with Iron Head, while Steelix can defeat Golbat with Stone Edge, followed up by Earthquake when it uses Roost. Rhyperior and Aggron are also great counters to Golbat as the bat is unable to deal a lot of damage to them with its physical sets, while they can easily set up Substitute or Rock Polish and proceed to sweep Golbat's team.</p> <p>Rotom and Lanturn are both decent counters to Golbat as they resist Brave Bird, carry STAB Electric-type moves to hit Golbat super effectively, and have many great support moves. Rotom may set up Substitute, Reflect and/or Light Screen, or be a sweeper, while Lanturn can support its team with Thunder Wave and Toxic.</p> <p>Basically any Pokemon who can outspeed Golbat, survive a Brave Bird, and hit it super effectively can be called a counter.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Stallbreaker": {
        "description": "<p>Golbat makes an ideal scout as it has the ability to shut down walls with Taunt, while U-turn allows it to escape the battle safely, effectively revealing the opponent's team. Golbat is able to switch in quite easily, due to its decent defenses, Ground immunity, and three 4x resistances. Although Stealth Rock may be a problem, Golbat can remedy this by carrying Roost, which allows it to restore 50% of its health, while simultaneously losing its weakness to Ice-, Rock-, and Electric-type moves. Brave Bird is Golbat's primary attacking option due to its high power and STAB. However, you must note that it is illegal to use in conjunction with Hypnosis, so if you wish to use Hypnosis, Aerial Ace must unfortunately be used instead.</p> <p>If you want Golbat to be more defensive, you may forgo the Attack EVs and use an alternative spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 Spe, which gives Golbat much more bulk than the previous set, while maintaining its high Speed to outrun the opponent. 248 HP EVs give Golbat the highest bulk possible and it ensures that Golbat survives a fourth switch into Stealth Rock. The remaining EVs are placed into Defense for additional bulk. Alternatively, you may choose to lower Golbat's Speed and use a spread of 248 HP / 44 Def / 216 Spe, giving Golbat even more bulk. 216 Speed still allows Golbat to outrun dangerous threats such as Venusaur and Toxicroak, though it loses the tie with Moltres. More EVs can be placed into Defense to give Golbat more bulk, however, Golbat cannot afford to lose any Speed or attacking power. If using a defensive set, Super Fang is an excellent alternative to Brave Bird or Aerial Ace as it is not affected by the lower Attack, while making it easier to defeat bulky walls such as Registeel.</p> <p>As Golbat is unable to deal a lot of damage to Steel-types, you may choose to use a Ground-type, such as Torterra or Donphan, as they can hit Steel-types super effectively with Earthquake, while also being immune to Thunder Wave. Donphan is the better choice as it can Rapid Spin away Stealth Rock, allowing Golbat to switch in freely. Fire-types are also another wise choice, as they can scorch Steel-types with their STAB attacks. Moltres is an excellent example as it has one of the highest Special Attack stats in the metagame. However, Rapid Spin is even moreso recommended as Moltres is weaker to Stealth Rock than Golbat. Arcanine is another great choice as it can switch into most physical attacks with Intimidate and hit the opponent with STAB Flare Blitz, while using Morning Sun to recover from any recoil damage. Finally, Blaziken can blast its way through the opponent's Steel-types with a variety of physical and special STAB Fire-type moves, or any of its Fighting-type moves.</p> <p>As for the item choice, using Leftovers is the preferred option as it allows Golbat to recover recoil damage from Brave Bird and Stealth Rock, though Life Orb also has its merits. When using a Life Orb, Golbat becomes more of a sweeper, allowing it to potentially 2HKO standard 252 HP / 200 Def Milotic with Brave Bird. As another option, Golbat may use a Lum Berry, allowing it to switch into the likes of Venusaur with Sleep Powder, then scoring an OHKO with Brave Bird.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Although Golbat has a horrible Special Attack, after a Nasty Plot, it becomes an effective special sweeper. Sludge Bomb provides a decent STAB move, while Heat Wave provides great type coverage against Steel-types. Hidden Power Grass scores an OHKO against Rhyperior and deals with Omastar and other Rock- and Ground-types who expect a Brave Bird. Air Slash is a secondary STAB move that deals more damage to Fighting- and Grass-types than Golbat's other attacks. Roost is an option to recover from Life Orb and Stealth Rock recoil, though Golbat is usually KOed before it has chance to use it.</p> <p>For additional bulk, you may lower Golbat's Speed to 216 and combine the leftover EVs and the 4 Def EVs into HP, to ensure that Golbat's HP remains odd, allowing it to survive four switch ins to Stealth Rock without fainting. This spread given allows Golbat to reach 297 Speed, beating all base 85 Pokemon such as Toxicroak, though losing to base 90s such as Moltres.</p> <p>Being completely specially-based, this set is walled by Chansey and Clefable. Their huge HP and high defensive stats will slow Golbat down while they slowly KO it with Seismic Toss. To deal with them, you may decide to use a physical sweeper such as Blaziken who can hit Chansey with its STAB Fighting-type moves, or Dugtrio, who can trap them with its ability and hit them with STAB Earthquake. Alternatively, you may choose to use Taunt Mismagius with Nasty Plot and Hidden Power Fighting. After three boosts from Nasty Plot, Mismagius is able to 2HKO Chansey with Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <p>If you decide to use Roost, Lum Berry is the better option as Golbat can set up multiple boosts from Nasty Plot while recovering health when necessary. Also, when using Roost, Toxic Spikes are helpful as they slowly drain walls of HP, such as Chansey and Milotic. Qwilfish is the best option to set up Toxic Spikes as a lead due to its above-average Speed and the ability to use Explosion on the opponent. Drapion and Nidoqueen are good choices too due to their great bulk.</p>"

  "Parasect": {
    "overview": "<p>Parasect is certainly an interesting and unique Pokemon. His odd typing grants him extremely useful resistances to Water-, Ground-, Grass-, Fighting-, and Electric-type attacks, and his defenses are decent enough to utilize these resistances effectively. His excellent ability, Dry Skin, allows him to switch into bulky Water-types with ease, and also slightly heals him at the end of every turn while in the rain, giving Parasect a unique niche on Rain Dance teams. However, none of the aforementioned factors are Parasect's main selling point. Parasect's most useful trait, by far, is his access to Spore, which gives him the ability to cripple any counter temporarily, almost always allowing Parasect to damage the opposing team in some way. All of these unique characteristics make Parasect stand out amongst both his Bug- and Grass-type brethren, giving him competitive value and usability.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it isn't all good news for Parasect. Parasect's typing grants him horrible, crippling weaknesses to Fire-, Flying-, Poison-, Rock-, Ice-, and Bug-type attacks, most of which are common in the UU metagame. Parasect is also exceedingly slow, and is outsped by almost every Pokemon in the UU tier, except for Slowbro and Steelix (whom he speed-ties with). Due to these two traits, it's extremely easy to hit Parasect with a strong super effective attack once he switches in. In conclusion, Parasect, despite his many faults, can prove fairly useful to a team thanks to his unique assets.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Parasect's movepool, while not particularly diverse, does hold a few interesting options. Swords Dance, Agility, and Growth are all boosting moves that Parasect has access to, and he can use each of them with moderate success. Thanks to Parasect's respectable bulk and access to Spore, he doesn't have too many issues obtaining the boosts. However, in the case of Swords Dance and Growth, Parasect is simply far too slow and has too many common weaknesses to utilize these moves effectively, while with Agility, Parasect is too weak. If one uses Trick Room support alongside either Swords Dance or Growth though, Parasect has a much better chance at pulling off a successful sweep. In a similar vein, Screech is an interesting option to weaken the foe's Defense, and with Pursuit, Parasect can smack fleeing Pokemon for large amounts of damage. Unfortunately, like the aforementioned Swords Dance, Parasect is simply too slow to use this strategy effectively.</p> <p>In terms of support options, Parasect has access to Aromatherapy, Knock Off, Light Screen, and Worry Seed. Aromatherapy can be used to clear status, and, thanks to Parasect's resistances and bulk, can be used with decent success. Sadly, Parasect often has trouble finding room for it. Knock Off is a great move that can remove key items from opposing Pokemon, but just like Aromatherapy, it's hard to fit it in on any of Parasect's sets. Light Screen can bolster Parasect's Special Defense further, and can be used alongside Counter to encourage foes to attack Parasect physically, allowing Parasect to respond with Counter. Worry Seed can remove important abilities from the opposing Pokemon, but changing the opponent's ability to Insomnia heavily clashes with Parasect's main weapon: Spore.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The main problem with countering Parasect is his ability to essentially remove one of his counters with Spore. Once Sleep Clause has been activated though, Parasect becomes much easier to deal with. RestTalkers such as Arcanine and Weezing can easily absorb Spore, and don't really fear being slept thanks to Sleep Talk. They also can easily threaten Parasect with their super effective STAB attacks. Alternatively, you can use a Pokemon with Vital Spirit or Insomnia to act as a decent switch-in to Parasect. Unfortunately, most of the Pokemon who have these two abilities are either frail enough to be overcome by Parasect's attacks or are weak to one of Parasect's STAB moves. Thus, out of the Pokemon who have these two abilities, Primeape and Noctowl are likely the best options to use against Parasect, as Noctowl is bulky enough to easily take Parasect's attacks while Primeape can threaten Parasect with Stone Edge, Ice Punch, or U-turn.</p> <p>If you don't have either of these options, defensive Pokemon are decent switch-ins to Spore, since they should be bulky enough to survive being asleep for a couple of turns. Registeel is a prime example of this, since it's extremely bulky and resists almost all of Parasect's attacks. If Sleep Clause has been activated, Fire- and Flying-types easily wall Parasect. In particular, Swellow is perhaps the most dangerous out of this group, as he will often be burned or poisoned, granting him immunity to Stun Spore, and can easily shift the momentum in your team's favor with U-turn. Really, once Sleep Clause has been activated, any Pokemon who doesn't mind paralysis and resists Parasect's STABs will do just fine against him.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Double Status": {
        "description": "<p>With access to two useful status-inducing moves, a slew of handy resistances, reliable recovery, and respectable defensive stats, Parasect can act as a superb status spreader. Parasect can switch into many common Pokemon, such as Milotic, with ease, which gives him plenty of opportunities to switch in and spread status. Though Parasect's numerous weaknesses can cripple him in this regard, the opponent cannot switch in Pokemon who can target Parasect's weaknesses easily due to the threat of Spore and Stun Spore.</p> <p>Spore is this set's main selling point, forcing the opponent to be constantly wary of switching Pokemon into Parasect haphazardly. It should be noted that Parasect may not wish to use Spore immediately; though it may seem tempting to do so, the constant threat of Spore will pose a psychological threat against the opponent, and you may wish to scout the opposing team for any Sleep Talkers before using up Parasect's precious Spore. Stun Spore allows Parasect to act as an effective paralysis spreader, and, since Stun Spore's paralysis is only negated by Pokemon with the Limber ability, Parasect is almost guaranteed to paralyze an opposing Pokemon once he gets in safely. Stun Spore is also the safer option to use immediately, since it can catch a threatening Pokemon like Arcanine on the switch. Synthesis gives Parasect a means of reliable recovery, and further adds to Parasect's nice bulk. Finally, Seed Bomb rounds off the set by providing a reliable STAB move that still hits fairly hard off of Parasect's respectable Attack stat, despite the lack of EV investment. However, X-Scissor can be used over Seed Bomb to hit Grass-, Psychic-, and Dark-types harder, though Seed Bomb's better type coverage means that it is generally the better option.</p> <p>The EVs of this set go towards increasing Parasect's special bulk. This is because many of Parasect's resistances, such as those against Water-, Electric-, and Grass-type attacks, are more commonly seen as special attacks, which makes investing in Special Defense more worthwhile than investing in Defense. For example, a specially defensive Parasect takes relatively little damage from Milotic's Ice Beam, which allows him to switch into Milotic with ease; it also allows him to survive some strong super effective attacks, such as Life Orb Venusaur's Sludge Bomb. Also, despite being specially-based, Parasect can still take Choice Band Close Combats and Earthquakes when need be. However, a physically defensive spread isn't a terrible option, as it does allow Parasect to check Pokemon like Dragon Dance Feraligatr.</p> <p>This set has numerous options that can be used over the suggested ones. While Dry Skin is usually the better ability, Effect Spore can be useful to allow Parasect to spread status by simply switching into a contact move. The immunity to Water-type attacks that Dry Skin provides is generally too useful to pass up, however. Knock Off can be used in Stun Spore's stead to remove opposing Pokemon's items, but the paralysis offered by Stun Spore is generally more useful. Finally, Aromatherapy is a useful option to cure Parasect and his teammates of status, but it's difficult to find a place for it on this set.</p> <p>Since this Parasect can act as a very effective status-- in particular, paralysis -- spreader, slow, powerful Pokemon work well with him. Rhyperior is perhaps the best of these, as he resists all of Parasect's weaknesses except for Ice-type attacks, and in exchange, Parasect resists Rhyperior's nasty weaknesses to Water-, Grass-, Ground-, and Fighting-type moves. However, Aggron, Hariyama, Azumarill, and Ursaring are all good choices as well, though they unfortunately don't have the almost perfect defensive synergy that Rhyperior and Parasect share.</p> <p>Defensively, bulky Water-types can be useful, since they resist Parasect's weaknesses to Fire- and Ice-type attacks, and the combination of Water- and Grass-type Pokemon is a fairly decent defensive tandem. Milotic, Blastoise, and Lanturn are great bulky Water-types who can also complement Parasect in other ways. Since Parasect is very prone to status, having a cleric on your team can be useful; Clefable, Chansey, and Lanturn are great Pokemon to fulfill this role. Due to his Stealth Rock weakness, Parasect appreciates Rapid Spin support, as Stealth Rock will cause some attacks that would otherwise be manageable to 2HKO or OHKO him, and is generally extremely annoying for Parasect to deal with. Hitmontop, Blastoise, and Donphan are all excellent Rapid Spinners, since they can all deal with spinblockers who may attempt to halt their attempts to Rapid Spin.</p>"

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set attempts to use Parasect's good base 95 Attack in the form of a bulky attacker. Spore is the main option on this set, as it's Parasect's main weapon against his counters. Seed Bomb and X-Scissor have decent coverage together, and are both boosted by STAB. Pursuit is a great attack to use alongside Spore; since Spore tends to force switches, Pursuit can smack the Pokemon who switch out for decent damage. Parasect can also use it to trap unsuspecting Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon. Brick Break is a usable option over either of Parasect's STAB moves, since it hits the Steel-types who wall both of his STABs for respectable damage. However, Parasect probably still won't be able to break through the majority of Steel-types of UU, so it isn't recommended. Synthesis is a decent option over Pursuit to give Parasect a form of reliable recovery, and it complements either item choice well. Life Orb gives Parasect's attacks more sting, but it comes at the cost of reduced longevity. However, with Dry Skin (and possibly Synthesis) to make up for it, Life Orb is a decent option, though Leftovers is always the safer choice.</p> <p>Maximum Attack EVs and an Adamant nature are used, as Parasect needs all the power it can get. To give you an idea of how weak Parasect can be, even with max Attack, Parasect isn't guaranteed to 2HKO a full-HP Milotic with Seed Bomb without Life Orb (factoring in Milotic's Leftovers). Due to this, Parasect really can't afford to sacrifice any of his investment in Attack. While you may feel tempted to invest the remaining EVs into Speed, it's really not worth it. Parasect is so slow that a heavy amount of investment is required to outspeed even slow, defensive Pokemon such as Registeel and Chansey, and, even then, it's hardly worth it since Parasect will rarely be able to muster a 2HKO on the aforementioned Pokemon. As such, the remaining EVs are placed into HP to boost Parasect's respectable bulk.</p> <p>In addition to the numerous options that are presented on this set, there are a couple of other interesting choices that can be used. Return is Parasect's strongest option against Flying- and Fire-types, and it prevents Parasect from being utterly walled by the likes of Moltres and Blaziken. Stun Spore can be used over one of this set's coverage moves to slow down opposing Pokemon so that Parasect can actually outspeed them, but sacrificing coverage isn't good for this set, as this set relies on type coverage to deal damage due to Parasect's mediocre Attack stat. Aromatherapy is an option alongside Synthesis to create a self-reliant and fairly bulky mono-attacker. However, as stated before, sacrificing coverage really hurts Parasect in the long run. Lastly, Choice Band is a decent item choice, but Parasect really despises being locked into one of his heavily resisted STAB moves (or Spore, for that matter).</p> <p>Since this Parasect's main prey are Water-, Grass-, and Ground-type Pokemon, Pokemon that have issues with these types complement this set well. Rhyperior, Aggron, and Blaziken are great examples of Pokemon who lure these types of Pokemon in, and they all pack resistances to some of Parasect's weaknesses. They're also all able to deal with bulky Steel-types, whom Parasect despises. In return, Parasect is able to take out Pokemon such as Lanturn and Donphan, whom the aforementioned powerhouses have issues with.</p>"

  "Venomoth": {
    "overview": "<p>Venomoth is usually considered inferior to other Pokemon, due to its NU status and Bug typing. If one looks past these \"disadvantages\", however, one will find that Venomoth can prove to be a consistently useful team member. This fragile-looking moth has many assets, the most prominent being Tinted Lens, an ability that helps Venomoth hit so-called counters hard, by turning 4x resistances into 2x resistances and 2x resistances into neutral hits. Tinted Lens gives Venomoth unresisted coverage against every UU and NU Pokemon except Shedinja. Combine that coverage with respectable Special Attack and Speed stats, and Venomoth becomes a force to be reckoned with. Venomoth's usefulness doesn't end with offense, though. It can also prove to be a good supporting Pokemon, boasting 4x resistances to Grass- and Fighting-type attacks, Sleep Powder, Toxic Spikes, Stun Spore, Baton Pass, and Sunny Day. With a number of ways to fit into a team, Venomoth is living proof that Bug-types aren't as weak as they are commonly thought to be.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Venomoth has a healthy number of options it can use other than the ones listed in the sets. Shield Dust, Venomoth's other ability, allows Venomoth to take on moves such as Hariyama's Force Palm without fear of secondary effects. It can also use Silver Powder or Insect Plate over Life Orb on attacking sets, but the damage output will be noticeably lower. A Baton Pass set is viable on Venomoth, and works very well with Agility. Unfortunately, Sleep Powder is the only niche that separates Venomoth from other Baton Passers. Sludge Bomb is a good choice on the offensive sets, as it gets STAB and is pretty powerful, though it doesn't mesh well with Tinted Lens's effect. Protect and U-turn can be used along with Sleep Powder and Toxic Spikes to create a lead set, allowing Venomoth to function as a scout, though Venomoth really isn't bulky enough to reliably perform this role over the course of a match. Venomoth also can use Sunny Day pretty well, and it can learn Solar Beam and Morning Sun to benefit from it, but this only increases the danger of enemy Fire-types switching in. Energy Ball is another option, but it is only useful against bulky Water- and Rock-types, and offers mostly redundant coverage with Venomoth's primary attacking moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Chansey takes Venomoth's special attacks comfortably, thanks to its massive HP and high Special Defense stats, as well as access to instant recovery with Wish and Soft-Boiled. It also threatens Venomoth with Thunder Wave, drastically reducing the fragile moth's effectiveness. Additionally, it can take Sleep Powder with no troubles at all as a result of Natural Cure. Registeel also takes on Venomoth's attacks easily, and threatens it with Iron Head against Venomoth's weaker Defense stat. Like Chansey, it can Thunder Wave Venomoth and set up Stealth Rock to discourage it from switching in again. The iron giant doesn't appreciate being slept, though.</p> <p>Drapion also has the potential to ruin Venomoth's fun. It can get a free switch-in on Psychic, proceed to outspeed Venomoth, and then threaten it with Earthquake. As a plus, Drapion has the advantage of absorbing Toxic Spikes upon switching in, making all of Venomoth's set-up go to waste. Milotic, with its high HP and Special Defense stats, can wall Venomoth, and being slept makes it even harder to defeat with physically attacking teammates, though it doesn't like Toxic Spikes. Moltres hates being put to sleep, but if another teammate can take Sleep Powder for it, then Venomoth really can't do anything in return without dying painfully.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>What sets Venomoth apart from other Bug-types is its ability, Tinted Lens, which allows it to have an easier time sweeping. In conjunction with its ability, Venomoth can run a sweeping set with Bug Buzz and Psychic, two of Venomoth's most powerful attacks. Venomoth also has Sleep Powder to put enemies that attempt to counter the moth to sleep. Roost allows Venomoth to heal off damage from Life Orb, entry hazards, and the Grass- or Fighting-type attacks that Venomoth will be switching into. Substitute can be used over Psychic to ease prediction, but it takes away the coverage that Psychic provides alongside Bug Buzz.</p> <p>Rapid Spin support is useful due to Venomoth's Stealth Rock weakness in addition to Life Orb's recoil. Hitmontop is Venomoth's best partner, removing Stealth Rock, Chansey, and Registeel all by itself. Donphan is a viable alternative to Hitmontop, as it possesses essentially the same attributes and is immune to Thunder Wave. This set also appreciates Wish support, since it will be steadily losing health with each attack. Clefable and Chansey are both excellent choices, especially since their lone Fighting-type weakness is covered by Venomoth's 4x resistance.</p> <p>Other Fighting-types, most notably Hitmonlee, Hariyama, and Blaziken, can help finish off Pokemon that Venomoth can't kill and benefit from Venomoth's ability to cripple a team. Rhyperior deals with Fire-, Flying-, and Rock-types, while also luring in Fighting- and Grass-types for Venomoth to switch into; Rhyperior also appreciates Venomoth's ability to soften up the opponent's team. Dugtrio kills off Chansey and Registeel easily and can absorb incoming Thunder Waves. Claydol can switch into Rock- and Psychic-type attacks, while also spinning away Stealth Rock and setting up its own. It also threatens the Chansey and Registeel duo, with Explosion for the former and STAB Earth Power for the latter. Ludicolo and Lanturn can defeat Milotic easily, while also deterring Fire-types from switching in. Ironically, Milotic makes a good teammate, defeating Fire-types such as Arcanine and Moltres, while luring in Grass-types which are beaten by Venomoth.</p>"
      },
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>While Choice sets are dangerous on many Pokemon, Choiced Venomoth is far more dangerous; this is thanks to Tinted Lens, which makes it harder for opponents to switch in on predicted moves. Bug Buzz and Psychic are Venomoth's main attacking moves, as they provide great coverage with Tinted Lens and power. U-turn allows Venomoth to scout the opponent, allowing you to switch in a counter and gain momentum. Sleep Powder rounds off the set by allowing Venomoth to cripple enemies, giving other teammates the chance to sweep.</p> <p>Maxing Speed and Special Attack allow Venomoth to outpace many Pokemon, such as Nidoking and Blaziken, while hitting as hard as possible. The four remaining EVs are dumped into Defense so that Venomoth can switch into Stealth Rock four times without fainting. If a Choice Scarf is being used, the nature can be changed to Modest, since Venomoth will still outrun every non-boosted Pokemon in UU, including Hasty Electrode.</p> <p>Once again, Venomoth greatly appreciates Rapid Spin support. Hitmontop is still a prime candidate as a teammate, because it can do severe damage to both Registeel and Chansey, Venomoth's best counters, while keeping Stealth Rock off the field. Donphan is an excellent option as it can also perform the same job as Hitmontop. Houndoom can switch into Psychic- and Fire-type attacks aimed at Venomoth and can also hurt Registeel, but is helpless against Chansey.</p>"
      },
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Venomoth is one of the only viable users of Toxic Spikes, and it has reliable ways of preventing the enemy from foiling its plan. Sleep Powder puts the enemy to sleep, giving Venomoth the opportunity to set up Toxic Spikes on the switch. Bug Buzz and Psychic are Venomoth's obligatory attacking moves, and Psychic has the additional advantage of discouraging opposing Poison-types from switching in to absorb your Toxic Spikes. Roost can be used over Psychic if you are worried about Venomoth's survivability.</p> <p>This set can function as an effective lead with Focus Sash as the item, but Venomoth will want Leftovers for supporting the team mid-game. 156 HP EVs give Venomoth some bulk and a Leftovers number. 232 Speed EVs allow Venomoth to outrun Hitmonlee, and the rest are dumped into Special Attack for more offensive potential. These Special Attack EVs can be placed in one of Venomoth's defenses if more bulk is desired.</p> <p>Dugtrio is an excellent partner to this Venomoth, as it can trap and KO most Poison-types that would otherwise absorb Toxic Spikes. Venomoth can probably deal with them on its own, though, thanks to Psychic and Sleep Powder. Venomoth also appreciates Houndoom and Blaziken as partners, as they can deal with opponents crippled by Toxic, most notably Milotic. Nidoking can defeat grounded Poison-types easily, and it can also sweep a team that has been sufficiently worn down by Venomoth.</p>"
      },
      "Double Status": {
        "description": "<p>While Sleep Powder is Venomoth's main status move, it also has access to Stun Spore, allowing Venomoth to become an effective double status user. After being slept, many enemies believe that they can switch in on a predicted Toxic Spikes or double switch, only to become crippled by Stun Spore. Bug Buzz and Psychic allow Venomoth to hurt debilitated opponents, leaving the opponent's team vulnerable for another teammate to sweep. Roost can be used over Psychic to give Venomoth a reliable recovery move so that it can survive longer.</p> <p>Timid makes Venomoth fast enough to accomplish its job, and max Special Attack, combined with Tinted Lens, allow it to hit as hard as possible. Leftovers allows Venomoth to survive longer so that it can cripple more members of the opposing team. Wide Lens can be used if Roost has replaced Psychic, and if you are worried about Sleep Powder and Stun Spore's accuracy. If more power is desired, Life Orb can be used, although Venomoth's other sets are able to make better use of it. An alternative spread of 240 HP / 16 SpA / 252 Spe will result in Venomoth being bulkier, so that it can at least survive some hits should its status moves miss.</p> <p>This Venomoth should be paired with a Pokemon that can take advantage of a mostly-disabled opposing team. Blaziken, Arcanine, and Houndoom can switch into Fire-type attacks relatively easily and take advantage of the opponent's switch. Houndoom has the added bonus of being immune to the Psychic-type attacks that could easily KO Venomoth. Rapid Spinners such as Hitmontop and Donphan can keep Venomoth alive longer by removing Stealth Rock. Finally, Wish support from Clefable or Chansey, both of which can also take special Fire- and Psychic-type attacks with ease, will allow Venomoth to keep switching in to hurt or cripple opponents.</p>"

  "Persian": {
    "overview": "<p>Persian's usage in the UU environment is greatly suppressed by the existence of Ambipom, who outclasses Persian in almost every respect. Really, Persian's only advantages are his slightly higher (though admittedly still awful) Special Attack, and access to Hypnosis and Switcheroo. Even if you take Ambipom out of the picture, Persian's stats are still rather lacking, and despite his stellar Technician ability, he has only modest attacking power. Still, with his high Speed stat, Persian can make an excellent scout in his own right, and coupled with his access to Nasty Plot, he can be a fine special sweeper as well. All in all, Persian's rather underrated, and though he is overshadowed by Ambipom, he is a very legitimate threat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>On a physical set, Seed Bomb stands out as Persian's best attack against Rock-types, 2HKOing Rock Polish Rhyperior with entry hazard support. Unfortunately, it's hard to find a moveslot for it most of the time. Payback smacks Ghost-types harder on the switch, but is otherwise a lesser option compared to Bite and Night Slash because of Persian's high Speed stat. Technician Aerial Ace can be used to strike Fighting-, Grass-, and Bug-types harder than any of Persian's other moves, but is resisted by the same Pokemon that resist Normal. Last Resort can make an extremely threatening attack alongside Fake Out, but such a set is gimmicky, and done better by Ambipom anyway. Finally, Persian has access to Knock Off, which can prove extremely annoying to foes that rely on their items to be threatening.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>For offensive sets, the absolute best counter to Persian is Spiritomb, as it is immune to his Normal STAB, has excellent all-around bulk, and can also cripple him with Will-O-Wisp. Persian can't even switch or U-turn out safely, as a Choice Band-boosted Pursuit will do upwards of 95.2% to any offensive set. Bulky Fighting- and Water-types such as Hitmontop and Milotic, respectively, are also trouble for Persian. Physical variants are walled to Timbuktu and back by the likes of Weezing and Donphan. Support sets are harder to counter, technically speaking, but faster Taunt users can limit their options quite effectively. Finally, faster sweepers like Sceptile and Alakazam can revenge kill Persian, but should be wary of switching in directly. Keep in mind that even though Persian has a lot of checks, all of them must be wary of Hypnosis, Switcheroo, Knock Off, and U-turn when switching into him.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>This set capitalizes on Persian's few advantages over Ambipom, specifically his higher Special Attack and access to Hypnosis, as well as his equally high Speed stat, in order to make him a rather effective sweeper. Although Persian's initial Special Attack is still pretty bad, it becomes surprisingly decent after a Nasty Plot; when further boosted by Life Orb, it is at least enough to dispose of many switch-ins that expect a typical physical set, such as Rhyperior and Donphan. Hypnosis can allow Persian a free setup opportunity he would otherwise not have had, which is especially potent if he manages to hit a would-be counter as well. Swift is Persian's strongest special STAB attack after Technician, and it will be his primary attacking option. Water Pulse is boosted likewise, and it achieves perfect coverage in UU (besides Shedinja) alongside Swift.</p> <p>Substitute can be a viable alternative to Hypnosis, and it can be really helpful in easing prediction and blocking status. However, losing the ability to instantly suspend an opponent in sleep is rather disappointing. Taunt is also an option that can allow Persian to grab a few extra Nasty Plot boosts against Chansey or stop opposing setup sweepers from doing their thing. Icy Wind and Thunderbolt can be used in the second and fourth slots, respectively, if you decide against both Hypnosis and Substitute, for impressive coverage. Finally, Dark Pulse and Shadow Ball are options to hit Ghost-types, most notably Mismagius and Rotom, harder.</p> <p>Dual screen support is very helpful to Persian, as he is incredibly frail. Pokemon such as Uxie and Mesprit make great candidates to set them up, as they have impressive bulk and a resistance to Fighting. Both also sport the ability to use Stealth Rock, a most valuable asset to any sweeper. Further Spikes and Toxic Spikes support will also be appreciated, and both can be provided by a Pokemon like Qwilfish. Finally, even after several Nasty Plot boosts, Persian just does not have the power needed to break through the infamous Chansey, and to a lesser extent, Registeel. Milotic can also prove troublesome if Persian is without Thunderbolt. In return, these Pokemon can easily smash him with their own attacks, or cripple him with status. A Pokemon such as Toxicroak can be very useful in dealing with these Pokemon, as it is able to use its Fighting STAB to easily dispose of Chansey and Registeel, or scare them off and set up. Its ability, Dry Skin, also allows it to switch into Milotic with near impunity.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>With his high Speed stat, Persian can work as a fine scout, utilizing his STAB Technician Fake Out to get off free hits before switching to a counter with a fast U-turn. This set plays extremely similarly to Ambipom, but has the advantage of Hypnosis, which allows Persian to put a foe to sleep, rendering them useless. However unreliable its accuracy may be, dropping Hypnosis is not good idea, as without it, Persian is completely outclassed by Ambipom. Bite gets a Technician boost and is Persian's strongest attack against Ghost-types that may switch into Fake Out. On the other hand, Return is a strong STAB move which can be useful in finishing off healthier foes after Fake Out. Taunt can also be used in that slot to mess up any setup attempts, and is especially useful when using Persian in the lead position.</p> <p>Silk Scarf is usually the item of choice, as Persian will most often just be spamming Fake Out, and would appreciate the lack of recoil there. Then again, Life Orb's universal power boost will allow Persian to always KO Mismagius with Bite where it otherwise never would. Persian makes a surprisingly good lead with this set, and can easily prevent opposing Pokemon from setting up entry hazards with Taunt. Pokemon that enjoy this lack of entry hazards, such as Scyther and Moltres, who are both extremely deadly Pokemon with Stealth Rock off the field, make good teammates for this reason. They are both also able to take any Fighting-type attacks aimed at Persian with ease. It should be noted, however, that since Persian is so frail, many neutral attacks will KO him as well. Therefore, strong defensive pivots such as Slowbro and Milotic should be considered, so that Persian always has a fallback. Finally, Spiritomb is a massive headache to this set, making a Pokemon like Houndoom incredibly useful to deal with it. In addition, Houndoom can take out many notable defensive Pokemon (like Uxie and Weezing) that also cause Persian trouble.</p>"
      },
      "Switcheroo": {
        "description": "<p>Switcheroo is one of Persian's few perks over Ambipom; when coupled with Hypnosis, it allows Persian to possibly neuter a third of your opponent's team very quickly. A Choice Band is used to take advantage of Switcheroo as Persian is already quite fast and appreciates a boost in power much more than one in Speed (which it would get from Choice Scarf). Return is a strong STAB move to abuse the power while it lasts, and U-turn is for scouting purposes. In the final slot, both Hypnosis and Night Slash are worthy options; the latter provides a means of hitting Ghost-types, while the former allows Persian to disable yet another Pokemon after he uses Switcheroo. In either case, Limber is the best choice of ability due to the lack of low Base Power moves on the set.</p> <p>The range of Pokemon Persian may potentially lure in and cripple is quite large, so any well-built team should naturally be able to take advantage of this set's main purpose. With that out of the way, this set has trouble dealing with physically bulky Pokemon such as Rhyperior, Hariyama, and Spiritomb, who can all withstand Persian's assaults and do not mind being given a Choice Band and may in fact already be carrying one. Therefore, it would be wise to pack a Pokemon who can deal with the aforementioned; Slowbro can handle most of these Pokemon with its strong STAB moves and impressive Defense, as can Milotic, who trades a resistance to Fighting for a neutrality to Dark. Dugtrio can use its Arena Trap ability to take out the Steel- and Rock-types that wall this set once they've been sufficiently weakened. Finally, if opting for Hypnosis over Night Slash, a Pursuit user such as Spiritomb can be employed to eliminate Ghost-types.</p>"
      },
      "Weather Support": {
        "description": "<p>Persian is tied with Ambipom as one of the fastest weather supporters in UU, but what sets Persian apart from it is his access to Hypnosis, which essentially removes a foe from the match for free. Rain Dance and Sunny Day are the core moves of this set, obviously, and their inherent qualities can turn Persian's otherwise generic teammates into deadly sweepers. A Damp Rock or Heat Rock should be held by Persian according to the choice of weather in order to prolong its effects. U-turn scouts out switch-ins and allows you to bring in an appropriate sweeper to combat them, while Taunt prevents enemy setup of all sorts.</p> <p>This Persian set makes for a great teammate to different Pokemon depending on the choice of weather. With Rain Dance, Swift Swim users such as Ludicolo, Kabutops, and Omastar make great teammates, as do Water-types in general. Sunny Day, on the other hand, makes Chlorophyll users, such as Tangrowth and Exeggutor, and Fire-types, such as Moltres, much more appropriate. As both rain and sun are offensive weathers, these Pokemon will also appreciate entry hazard support in order to aid their sweep. Uxie can set up Stealth Rock incredibly reliably, and can also serve as a very sturdy back-up supporter, as can Claydol, both of which resist Persian's Fighting-type weakness.</p>"

  "Golduck": {
    "overview": "<p>Like many first generation Pokemon, Golduck is blessed with a cool design and a generous movepool, but is held back by a lackluster stat distribution. Golduck's base 95 Special Attack is good, but not great, and the rest of its stats are decidedly average, making it difficult for Golduck to compete with its more specialized rivals. Luckily, Golduck does have a couple of niches in UU that help differentiate it from other Water-types. Cloud Nine is an exclusive ability that turns Golduck into a unique counter to devastating Swift Swim and Chlorophyll sweepers, while Calm Mind makes Golduck one of the few UU Water-types capable of sweeping through boosting its Special Attack. Although it's not the most threatening Pokemon around, Golduck can fill an important role without requiring much support, making it a solid choice for a variety of offensive teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Golduck can use Encore with three attacks to fill a specific supporting role as a counter to weather sweepers and stat boosters. Even without any boosts to its Special Attack, Golduck can still outspeed and OHKO or 2HKO most weather sweepers with Surf, Ice Beam, or Hidden Power Grass, while Encore forces switches and prevents opponents from setting up. However, Golduck can make much better use of the free turns granted by Encore if it has Calm Mind, so it's usually best to stick to that. Golduck can also use a defensive Calm Mind set with Rest and Sleep Talk or a Chesto Berry, but physical attackers can still easily revenge kill Golduck, so such sets would have to be saved until very late in the match.</p> <p>Aqua Jet is a STAB priority move, which is always a helpful asset in UU, but Golduck can't really spare a moveslot for it and lacks the physical power to use it effectively without heavy investment in Attack. Golduck has a nice physical movepool, including Waterfall, Aqua Tail, Ice Punch, Low Kick, Zen Headbutt, Shadow Claw, and Return, so a fully physical set could be used; however, with mediocre Attack and the unreliable Screech and Psych Up as the only options for boosting the power of its moves, it won't be very effective.</p> <p>Signal Beam can surprise Ludicolo and hit Exeggutor, Shiftry, and Slowbro harder than Golduck's other moves, but any other potential targets take more damage from Hydro Pump or Ice Beam. Focus Blast can be used to nail special walls such as Registeel and Clefable harder than Hydro Pump would, but Golduck can often beat them after a boost anyway, so it's usually not worth risking the shaky accuracy. Golduck has access to several support moves besides Encore, including Light Screen, Hypnosis, Yawn, Toxic, Confuse Ray, and Whirlpool, but if you want a support-oriented bulky Water-type, there are many better options available.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Golduck's counters depend heavily on what moves it is running. Chansey can usually come in on any set and stall Golduck out easily, but if Golduck happens to have Cross Chop or Encore, it will force Chansey right back out. Unless Golduck has multiple Calm Mind boosts under its belt, Registeel can switch in and paralyze Golduck, neutralizing it as an offensive threat, but will often take heavy damage in the process. Ludicolo cannot switch into a boosted Ice Beam or Psychic, but shrugs off Golduck's other moves and can OHKO back with Seed Bomb. If Golduck lacks Psychic, Toxicroak can usually force Golduck out with powerful physical attacks, although a boosted Ice Beam will hurt. Without Calm Mind, Golduck will be unable to break through Milotic and other bulky Water-types. Golduck's Defense and Speed stats aren't particularly impressive, so speedy physical attackers such as Leafeon, Scyther, and Primeape can all revenge kill it easily.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Encore Weather Counter": {
        "description": "<p>Golduck, an otherwise decidedly mediocre Pokemon, has two things that set it firmly apart from the many other similarly molded Water-types: its Cloud Nine ability and access to Encore. This set combines both and turns Golduck into a very versatile Pokemon who can fit on many different team types, in particular those which have trouble dealing with opposing weather teams.</p> <p>Cloud Nine is a brilliant ability which effectively negates every effect weather has in battle, from boosting the power of Water-type moves in rain to the Speed-doubling effect of Chlorophyll in sun. Clearly this gives Golduck a great niche in UU as a one-Pokemon answer to rain and sun sweepers alike. Encore allows Golduck to pull his weight in battles against non-weather teams, and with its good base 85 Speed, it can come in on a predicted ineffective move and force the opponent to repeat it, shifting the momentum of the battle in your favor.</p> <p>The other three slots are coverage moves which allow Golduck to inflict good damage on a wide range of foes. Hidden Power Grass is especially helpful on this set as it allows a quick, clean OHKO on Kabutops and Omastar, two common rain sweepers, as well as Quagsire. Ice Beam is a reliable choice for the last slot, but if you are looking to make Golduck an even surer answer to weather teams, Signal Beam can be used to hit Ludicolo and Snover harder than any of his other attacks. It is also a stronger option against Slowbro and Slowking as well. Another option is Psychic, which gets super effective hits on Qwilfish, Toxicroak, and Venusaur, all of whom take little from Surf and Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p>Golduck gets many opportunities to switch in on opposing weather teams. Against rain teams, it can come in on all of the common rain sweepers, with the exception of Ludicolo, with great ease, and then force them out of play with the threat of a super effective Hidden Power Grass. When switching into opposing Chlorophyll users, such as Exeggutor and Tangrowth, Golduck can use its ability to force a predicted Solar Beam to take a charge turn, forcing the hapless foe to stay in and be taken out by Ice Beam. Fire-types won't manage much against Golduck either when their STABs are resisted and don't receive a power boost from the sunlight.</p> <p>Encore combined with Golduck's Speed comes extremely handy when playing against more standard teams. Any supporting move or ineffective attack can be switched into and Encored. From an opposing Milotic's Surf or Recover to Registeel's Stealth Rock or Iron Head, or if you're feeling particularly gutsy, Venusaur's Swords Dance, Golduck can come in and force them all to switch out. This free turn allows you to pummel the opposing team with your choice of attack, and while it doesn't possess the highest of Special Attack stats, the ease with which Golduck can give itself free turns means this constant pummeling process will very quickly begin to take a toll.</p> <p>The 224 Speed EVs with a Timid nature ensure that Golduck outspeeds Jolly Kabutops and Timid Milotic, allowing it to Hidden Power Grass or Encore before they can attack. Maximizing Special Attack gives Golduck's attacks a much needed power boost, just enough to allow Ice Beam to 2HKO the standard offensive Venusaur. Leftovers is the item of choice, providing a steady source of recovery and helps switching into entry hazards a bit easier. Life Orb can be used to increase damage output (as can using Hydro Pump over Surf as your STAB attack), but it's hard to give up Leftovers when you're wanting Golduck to be in good health for switching in multiple times. A good middle ground between the two items is Expert Belt—Golduck will often be receiving the damage boost with the impressive coverage it has on this set, and won't have to take any recoil damage for it either.</p> <p>Overall, this Golduck set is very self-sufficient and needs little in the way of specific team support. Rather, Golduck provides a good catch-all for offensive teams that want a bit of insurance against being destroyed by even more offensive rain teams, while also being an effective tool against more defensive Pokemon. As with most Pokemon, entry hazard support is appreciated, but in Golduck's case, it is especially helpful because of the number of switches Encore forces. Be careful when using one of UU's Water-type Spikers (Omastar, Cloyster, or Qwilfish) alongside Golduck because you will inevitably double up on weaknesses.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Golduck is perhaps the only UU Water-type that can effectively boost its own Special Attack and sweep. While Slowbro and Slowking can also set up with Calm Mind or Nasty Plot, their extremely low Speed makes it easy for opponents to halt an attempted sweep with Toxic or Haze. Golduck, on the other hand, is fast enough to outspeed the defensive Pokemon that commonly carry such moves and can often 2HKO them after a boost, making it a much harder sweeper to stop. Hydro Pump is Golduck's most powerful STAB attack, dealing heavy damage to any Pokemon that doesn't resist it. After a single boost, even sturdy Pokemon such as Spiritomb and Hariyama can be OHKOed, while Clefable and Uxie are hit for guaranteed 2HKOs. Ice Beam takes care of Grass-types as well as Altaria, while Hidden Power Grass covers Golduck's fellow Water-types. With good prediction, Golduck can 2HKO Milotic with a boosted Hidden Power Grass and avoid being stifled by Toxic or Haze. Alternatively, Golduck can use Encore in the last slot to gain free turns. While this makes setting up much easier, it comes at the cost of a coverage move. If you choose to use Encore, Psychic is a good option over Ice Beam, as it has better two-move coverage alongside Hydro Pump. The only common UU Pokemon that resist both Water and Psychic are Slowbro and Exeggutor. Unfortunately, the loss of super effective coverage makes it significantly easier for the opponent to wall Golduck with bulky Water resistors.</p> <p>While Golduck has decent Speed and passable bulk, it is still vulnerable to faster physical attackers. Despite being unable to safely switch in on an attack, Leafeon, Sceptile, and Hitmonlee can all come in while Golduck sets up, and will outspeed and OHKO Golduck with their STAB moves. Because of this, it is usually better to simply fire off unboosted attacks during the early-game and save Calm Mind for later in the match when you have scouted most of your opponent's team. Life Orb is the recommended item thanks to the consistent power boost it brings. Without it, Golduck will often require more than one boost to be able to KO defensive Pokemon. However, Leftovers can be used if you wish to play Golduck more conservatively, especially in tandem with Encore. This will help keep Golduck healthy early on and may give it the opportunity to accumulate multiple boosts when it's ready to sweep. Hydro Pump is usually recommended due to the key KOs that it achieves, but Surf has more PP and better accuracy, and is worth considering for its reliability if you choose to use Leftovers.</p> <p>Golduck's Cloud Nine ability makes it an excellent counter to most Swift Swim and Chlorophyll sweepers. With their weather boosts nullified, Golduck can outspeed and OHKO Pokemon such as Kabutops and Tangrowth that might otherwise do serious damage to your team. Max Speed and a Timid nature are required to outspeed or tie the most common weather abusers along with the all-important base 80 Speed group. Special Attack is then maximized to cause as much damage as possible, while the final 4 EVs are placed in HP. You can instead put those 4 EVs into one of Golduck's defenses and use an HP IV of 29 to minimize damage from Life Orb recoil, although this will also slightly reduce the power of Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p>Entry hazard support is always helpful for an offensive Pokemon, and Golduck is no exception. After a single boost, Golduck gets a guaranteed OHKO on Spiritomb and specially-defensive Weezing and has a decent chance to 2HKO Registeel with Hydro Pump if Stealth Rock is in play. Hazards become even more important when running Encore to punish the switches that it causes while making up for the loss of super effective coverage. With Encore, Golduck can even come out on top against Chansey if Stealth Rock is up, as +1 Hydro Pump will be a guaranteed 3HKO, forcing Chansey to use a recovery move immediately after switching in. Golduck can then Encore the recovery move to force Chansey out and grab another boost. Registeel is a good choice to set up Stealth Rock due to its excellent defensive capabilities and decent synergy with Golduck.</p> <p>This set's counters depend on which moves Golduck is running. With three attacks, the only Pokemon that can safely switch in after a boost is Chansey. In this case, the best teammates for Golduck are mixed attackers or Choiced special attackers with Trick that can cripple Chansey. Blaziken and Rotom are both fine choices for this job. On the other hand, if Golduck is limited to a single coverage move, it will have more trouble breaking through bulky Water- and Grass-types that are not weak to Psychic. This makes Venusaur the best possible teammate, as it can come in on either of Golduck's weaknesses and use its powerful STAB Grass- and Poison-type attacks to destroy the Pokemon that wall Golduck.</p>"
      },
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes full advantage of Golduck's excellent coverage in order to pose an immediate threat to a variety of Pokemon. With Cloud Nine, Golduck is especially effective at countering Pokemon that rely on the weather to boost their Speed and power. Fire-type Sunny Day abusers lose their instant Solar Beam and are swiftly KOed by Golduck's STAB Hydro Pump. Chlorophyll sweepers are easily outsped once their Speed boost is nullified and can be defeated with Ice Beam. Hidden Power Grass takes care of some of the most common Swift Swimmers, while Psychic rounds out the coverage by hitting Qwilfish and Toxicroak hard.</p> <p>The given EVs are standard for a special attacker. A Timid nature is required to outspeed the crucial base 80 Speed group and tie with other base 85s, such as Qwilfish and Toxicroak. Life Orb is the recommended item since it provides a solid boost to Golduck's attacks without limiting its flexibility, but Choice Specs provide a bigger boost and can be used if you plan to play Golduck as a hit-and-run Pokemon. Either way, Golduck will be completely walled by Chansey, so Cross Chop is an option in the fourth moveslot to get past it. With a Life Orb, Mild nature, and EV spread of 120 Atk / 252 SpA / 136 Spe, Golduck can always 2HKO Chansey while still outspeeding neutral-natured base 70s. However, Cross Chop has little value outside of hitting Chansey, and the drop in Speed makes Golduck lose to many key Pokemon that it could have otherwise beat, so using such a spread is only recommended if Chansey poses a huge problem for your team. Once again, using 29 HP IVs to drop Golduck's HP to 299 is an option as it will minimize Life Orb recoil at the cost of a tiny reduction in Hidden Power Grass's power.</p> <p>While this set's great coverage allows Golduck to get past most Pokemon easily, it has trouble beating Pokemon that can take a hit or two. Entry hazards make life much easier for Golduck, softening up bulkier Pokemon and punishing weakened sweepers as they switch out. Most of Golduck's counters are grounded, so Spikes support would be ideal; unfortunately, most of the best UU Spikers are Water-types that don't work very well on the same team as Golduck. Cacturne is an exception, and has good defensive synergy with Golduck; unfortunately, neither Cacturne nor Golduck are very adept at taking Fighting-type attacks. Stealth Rock can be set up by a much wider variety of teammates, including reliable tanks such as Registeel and Uxie, and is therefore likely to be your best bet. Even with entry hazards up, this set is walled by most bulky Water-types. As such, Venusaur makes a great teammate thanks to its ability to consistently beat the most popular Water-types in UU.</p>"

  "Primeape": {
    "overview": "<p>Primeape is just one among many in UU. Its Speed is the highest of the multitude of Fighting-types in UU, its movepool is extensive, and its ability, Vital Spirit, is amazing to have in a tier overrun with Sleep Powder-carrying Grass-types. The only things holding back this furious ape are its low defenses and stiff competition in a tier filled to the brim with other able-bodied Fighting-types. However, Primeape's aforementioned perks are what separate it from the competition and make it a unique and admirable choice for any team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Primeape has a very extensive movepool, but unfortunately most of the moves are too situational to be of much use. Primeape is able to utilize a Hazerider set consisting of Substitute, Close Combat, Ice Punch, and Stone Edge while holding a Salac Berry to utilize its other ability, Anger Point. The idea is to continually use Substitute until the opponent scores a critical hit, causing Primeape's Attack stat to be maxed out, and then unleash all of hell with Primeape's attacks. The is a high risk-high reward strategy but is usually too unreliable to be worth a team slot, and Primeape is much better used as a scout. Primeape also lacks the bulk to pull off the strategy multiple times even with the help of a Wish user.</p> <p>Other Fighting-type moves in Primeape's repertoire include Low Kick, Cross Chop, Focus Punch, and Vacuum Wave. While all of them have their uses, Close Combat is usually the more reliable choice, and its damage output is high enough to outweigh the loss in defenses. Primeape can use Counter in a lead set, but it's better off attacking outright rather than relying on the opponent to attack it. Screech is a unique option to force even more switches and can allow Primeape to easily 2HKO Milotic and Tangrowth, but the accuracy is an issue as Primeape can't afford to miss. Bulk Up is Primeape's only set-up move, but it likes the instant power boost provided by a Life Orb and Choice Band and cannot find time to set up with its below-average defenses. Finally, Primeape's other coverage moves consist of Seed Bomb, Poison Jab, Gunk Shot, Fire Punch, and Payback.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Primeape is hard to counter outright thanks to its constant switching with U-turn. However, whenever it is not switching, Weezing is counter numero uno to any Primeape set. Primeape's only real hope against it is with a Hazerider set as described in the Other Options section, which is highly unreliable. Slowbro is another hard stop to any sweep that Primeape may attempt, as it takes little damage from all of Primeape's moves and can easily heal off any damage from U-turn thanks to Slack Off. Paralysis and burn are two of Primeape's greatest fears and will immediately put a stop to Primeape's fun. Venusaur, Tangrowth, Claydol, and Exeggutor can all comfortably check Primeape as they resist or take little damage from Close Combat and Stone Edge. However, they must be wary of Ice Punch and/or U-turn, and Primeape will usually be immune to Sleep Powder thanks to Vital Spirit.</p> <p>Defensive Arcanine with Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp can easily stop Primeape and eliminate it with either Flare Blitz or Extreme Speed. Donphan survives anything that Primeape throws at it, but it can't take repeated hits due to its lack of recovery. Milotic and Blastoise can withstand multiple Close Combats and proceed to KO Primeape with Surf after its defenses have been dropped. Finally, Ghost-types such as Spiritomb, Mismagius, Rotom, and Dusclops get a free switch into Primeape any time it uses Close Combat and can threaten it with Will-O-Wisp.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Primeape's awesome Speed stat is exploited to the fullest extent with a Choice Scarf, turning it into both an efficient scout and an excellent revenge killer. U-turn allows Primeape to come in on a Pokemon that it can scare out, like Chansey, and scout for the opponent's counter. Close Combat is the obligatory STAB move of choice because of its high Base Power; Primeape will be doing a lot of switching with a Choice item, effectively negating the troubles caused by the defense drops. Stone Edge hits Ghost- and Flying-types, such as Rotom and Moltres respectively, which resist the aforementioned moves. The choice in the final moveslot comes down to personal preference. Ice Punch, in tandem with Vital Spirit, allows Primeape to become an effective check to Venusaur. Earthquake can be used to hit Poison- and Electric-types super effectively, but they are mostly uncommon and are usually already dealt with by Primeape's other moves. Finally, Punishment is an option to score a reliable blow on Ghost-types, particularly Rotom and Mismagius; however, outside of hitting the rare stat boosting Psychic-types, that is quite literally the furthest extent of its uses in UU.</p> <p>The EVs and nature are designed to give Primeape as much attacking power as possible while also giving it enough Speed to outpace the entire UU metagame with a Choice Scarf, including Choice Scarf Rotom. The remaining EVs are placed into HP to give Primeape a minor buffer against weaker attacks from the likes of Registeel and Chansey. An alternative spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with an Adamant or Jolly nature can be utilized to maximize Primeape's offensive game.</p> <p>With a Choice Scarf and U-turn, Primeape works wonderfully as a scout. When using Primeape, the idea is to switch into a Pokemon that Primeape will force out, such as Registeel, and proceed to use U-turn, as opposed to Close Combat, to scout your opponent's Primeape counter. In this way, Primeape ensures that momentum will stay on your side and keeps the opponent on their toes. After the majority of your opponent's team has been revealed, Primeape is free to start raining down STAB Close Combats or one of the appropriate coverage moves.</p> <p>This Primeape can also make an effective lead, as it is immune to Sleep Powder, which forces Choice Scarf Venusaur into attacking on turn one, as well as forcing other sleep inducers out thanks to the threat of Primeape's large movepool. Primeape's early U-turn permits it to do decent damage to Uxie and Mesprit and scout the opponent's early switch-in to Primeape. It easily beats other common leads such as Ambipom (though Primeape will still get hit by a powerful Fake Out), Alakazam, Mismagius, Moltres, and Registeel. Primeape also beats Scyther, Cloyster, and Omastar if they do not carry Focus Sash. While Primeape can gain you early momentum, it does little to prevent entry hazards from being set up by the opponent, which can prove problematic in the long run considering all the switching it will be doing with U-turn. It also has trouble with lead Arcanine, Hariyama, Qwilfish, and Spiritomb.</p> <p>To ensure momentum stays on your side, pairing Primeape with other U-turn users that lure out Pokemon it can counter is a good idea. Swellow and Scyther are both good examples, as they lure out Steel- and Rock-types that Primeape can scare away with its STAB Close Combat. Weezing and Slowbro are hard stops to any attempt Primeape might have for a sweep, so Pokemon which can easily eliminate them, such as Lanturn, will prove useful. Registeel makes a good partner thanks to its ability to absorb various attacks aimed at Primeape when it is locked into the wrong move. Pairing Primeape with a Pursuit user, such as Absol or Skuntank, provides Primeape with a way to easily bypass Rotom and Mismagius and eliminates the need to waste a moveslot for Punishment. Primeape will be issuing a lot of switches, so setting up entry hazards on the opponent's field will help to more quickly wear out the opposition; good teammates to set up entry hazards include Uxie, Omastar, and Cloyster. In the same realm, keeping entry hazards off of Primeape's side of the field is recommended. Claydol is a good teammate to provide Rapid Spin support as it can easily switch into Weezing in addition to setting up Stealth Rock. Finally, as Primeape makes a good scout and wallbreaker, pairing it with a second Fighting-type, such as Hitmonlee, is a good strategy. The main idea is to scout out the opponent's Fighting-type counters with Primeape early game and eliminate them with the rest of your team, which will then allow the second Fighting-type to wreak havoc upon your opponent's ravaged team late game.</p>"
      },
      "Encore": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to disrupt and halt the opponent's strategy with Encore while following up with the appropriate move afterward. Encore allows Primeape to lock the foe into a single move, which is useful against set-up and support moves that are not harmful to Primeape. However, if you predict that your foe will switch out instead of attacking Primeape, using Substitute or U-turn to scout is more beneficial. Substitute essentially gives Primeape a temporary extra life against attacks, as well as immunity to status. U-turn does decent damage and gains momentum for your team by allowing Primeape to switch to a counter at the same time. Offensively, Close Combat is Primeape's main STAB attack, dealing deadly damage to any Pokemon that doesn't resist it. Stone Edge has good coverage in conjunction with Close Combat, hitting Flying-, Bug-, and Fire-type Pokemon, such as Moltres, Scyther, and Arcanine, for super effective damage. Lastly, Toxic helps cripple opponents that resist or take little damage from Primeape's attacks.</p> <p>Leftovers is the preferred item because it recovers HP lost from Substitute and residual damage, greatly extending Primeape's longevity. With the recovery provided by Leftovers, Primeape has more chances to switch in and use Encore on various threats. The HP EVs allow Primeape to use Substitute five times from full health with Leftovers factored in.</p> <p>Entry hazard support from Omastar, Mesprit, or Drapion is excellent with this Primeape since Encore causes a lot of switches. This means more indirect damage will pile up and weaken your enemy, which allows a late-game sweeper, such as Alakazam, Swellow, or Scyther, to clean up more easily. Even with Toxic Spikes support, using Toxic is an option because it hits Flying-types and Levitators which would otherwise wall Primeape. Stealth Rock is perhaps the best entry hazard to use alongside this set, since it smashes the Bug- and Flying-type Pokemon that resist Close Combat.</p> <p>Most physical walls or tanks, such as Milotic, Uxie, and Weezing, are annoying to Primeape. However, Primeape can hinder the aforementioned walls (with the exception of Weezing) with Toxic and clean them up later in the match with Close Combat and Stone Edge. Primeape cannot stall them out by itself, though, so bulky Pokemon such as Rotom, Milotic, and Venusaur can help block their advances while Toxic takes effect. Using Scyther and Arcanine can help defeat Venusaur, which takes little damage from any of Primeape's attacks. Pursuit users are also helpful at removing the Psychic-type walls.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>This set plays very similarly to Choice-locked Primeape, but with one big distinction: the ability to switch between moves, giving Primeape the freedom to fire off Close Combats without the fear of Ghost-types setting up on it. Primeape's main job is the same: scout out the opponent by switching into a Pokemon which Primeape will force out, such as Chansey, and proceed to use U-turn, as opposed to Close Combat, to scout your opponent's Primeape counter. Late-game is where Life Orb Primeape really shines, as it can outpace a large portion of the UU metagame and bring the hurt with its large movepool. The premise is simple: come in after the opposing team has been scouted on a Pokemon that is easily threatened by Primeape, and fire off the appropriate coverage move. Close Combat is the obligatory STAB move, and as Primeape will probably be played at the end of the match and outspeed most threats, the defense drops are negligible. U-turn remains Primeape's strongest hit on bulky Psychic-types such as Uxie, Exeggutor, and Slowbro. Stone Edge has great coverage alongside Close Combat and is Primeape's best attack on Flying-types and scores a good hit on Ghost-types. The last slot is again up to the player's discretion. Ice Punch pairs well with Vital Spirit and gives Primeape a nice way to threaten Venusaur and Tangrowth, which Primeape can come in on with its immunity to Sleep Powder. Earthquake can be used in the last slot to provide Primeape with the feared EdgeQuake combination, but it has a lot of overlapping coverage with Close Combat. Finally, Punishment is Primeape's strongest move against Rotom, Mismagius, and Dusclops.</p> <p>Unlike the Choice Scarf set, since Primeape no longer outspeeds all of the unboosted metagame, it will need some insurance against faster threats. Swellow, Alakazam, Sceptile, Mismagius, and Dugtrio all pose a significant threat to Primeape's existence, so packing checks to them will grant Primeape a new lease on life should it encounter them. Registeel easily switches into the first three threats thanks to its Steel typing and large bulk. Primeape's nemesis Mismagius now outspeeds it, so pairing Primeape with Mixed Houndoom will produce positive results; Houndoom is resistant to Shadow Ball, benefits from Will-O-Wisp, and can eliminate Mismagius with Pursuit. Primeape is again stopped cold by Weezing and Slowbro, so including Lanturn or Milotic, the latter of which also walls Dugtrio, on your team will again bolster Primeape's performance. With a Life Orb and entry hazards, such as Stealth Rock and Spikes, Primeape obtains a few KOs it normally couldn't, such as against Venusaur. Good teammates to provide entry hazards include Uxie, Omastar, Cloyster, and Qwilfish.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>This Primeape plays extremely similarly to the Choice Scarf variant but trades Speed for more power. Choice Band gives Primeape the capacity to 2HKO many prominent defensive walls, such as Milotic and Donphan, with Close Combat, that it normally would miss out on. While rushing onto the battlefield with fists flying may seem like the way to play this Primeape, it's usually smarter to feign a Choice Scarf by utilizing Primeape's now-boosted U-turns to scout out the opponent beforehand. The idea is to switch into a Pokemon which will be forced out by Primeape, such as Registeel, and instead of using the obvious Close Combat, scout the opposition with U-turn. After the majority of your opponent's team has been revealed, Primeape is free to start annihilating its opponents with STAB Close Combats or one of the appropriate coverage moves. The extra power in Primeape's U-turn can stealthily chip away its counter's health faster, allowing it to unleash its Close Combats earlier and surprise the opponent with its boosted power.</p> <p>Primeape may be fast, but it's far from outpacing the entirety of the UU metagame, so you should use it cautiously. Registeel again makes a good partner, as it can absorb blows from most of the fast and powerful hitters that threaten Primeape, including Swellow, Alakazam, and Sceptile. Spikes support is highly recommended with this set, as U-turn + Spikes will quickly rack up a lot more residual damage, especially on grounded walls such as Milotic. Qwilfish and Omastar are good candidates for providing said Spikes, and Omastar can even add Stealth Rock to the mix. Another good teammate to pair up with Primeape is Houndoom, which, with Flash Fire and Pursuit, can switch into the majority of Ghost-types with little worry and eliminate them.</p>"

  "Arcanine": {
    "overview": "<p>While not quite up to snuff with all the standards, Arcanine has a strong presence in UU, where its overall high base stats, both offensive and defensive, can overwhelm a lot of the other Pokemon. Flare Blitz was the 4th generation's greatest gift to Arcanine, finally giving it some powerful physical STAB to use off its neglected base 110 Attack. Combined with Extreme Speed and the bulk to switch into neutral attacks with relative ease, Arcanine can take weakened teams by storm. However, despite being able to hit hard with both physical and special attacks, Arcanine has a limited and predictable movepool which can easily be countered if one knows its set. Stealth Rock often ends up squandering its bulk as well, meaning Arcanine really has to be played strategically to get the most out of it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Arcanine doesn't have too many options other than the ones already listed or mentioned. Arcanine can be made into a Sunny Day sweeper, which allows him to abuse Solar Beam and Morning Sun to their fullest while gaining a buffer against Water-type attacks. However, this job is usually better left to the more powerful and bulkier Moltres. Howl is Arcanine's only method of boosting his Attack and can be used along with three attacks in order to sweep more easily. However, Howl is not particularly effective because Arcanine will suffer from a lack of reliable recovery while still not being powerful enough to muscle through threats like Rhyperior and Slowbro. Crunch can be squeezed into the physical sweeper sets to provide super effective coverage on Uxie and Mesprit, while also hitting Slowbro and Slowking harder than Thunder Fang would. Iron Tail hits Rhyperior and Regirock harder than any move bar Hidden Power Grass, but it is inaccurate. Overall, the aforementioned two attacks provide worse coverage than the recommended options, so they generally shouldn't be used. Finally, Agility could help Arcanine sweep against faster threats, but his already good Speed isn't usually what is stopping him from sweeping in the first place, especially with his access to Extreme Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Arcanine's biggest counters are bulky Water-types, packing a resistance to Arcanine's STAB Fire attacks and generally having the defenses to take neutral attacks without too much difficulty. The most common bulky Waters of UU, Slowbro and Milotic, have skewed defenses and may have trouble with super effective attacks hitting on their lower defensive stat. Milotic doesn't particularly enjoy Choice Band Thunder Fangs, and Slowbro can't withstand Choice Specs Hidden Power Grass. Blastoise has more even defenses and can take all the punishment Arcanine can deliver it. Azumarill has generally bulky stats as well, even though they aren't too heavily invested in normally, but it poses a much more direct threat to Arcanine with a super effective Aqua Jet off its sky high Attack.</p> <p>The Rock/Water types such as Kabutops and Omastar enjoy a 4x resistance to Fire as well resisting Extreme Speed, and their naturally high Defense stats mean that Thunder Fang isn't an immediate problem. However, they have to be very wary of being KOed by a 4x super effective Hidden Power Grass. Regirock is practically a full stop to any Arcanine set, especially in sandstorm, as it can threaten back with big damage from Stone Edge. Rhyperior walls any set without Hidden Power Grass and OHKOes with Earthquake.</p> <p>Moltres counters the lead set particularly well if it can switch in on anything but a Toxic. It can Roost off Flare Blitz damage and quickly deplete Extreme Speed's limited PP with its Pressure ability. However, it has to be cautious of switching into other Arcanine sets as they can threaten it with Thunder Fang, and Arcanine has a naturally higher Speed stat than Moltres and so the fiery bird will be unable to use Roost and remove its Electric weakness. Stealth Rock will also halve Moltres' health every time it comes into play. A physically defensive Altaria functions similarly to Moltres, but won't mind Toxic as much because of its Natural Cure ability. Chances are it can't do too much to Arcanine in return, though, but can use the free turns as a valuable opportunity to support the rest of the team.</p> <p>Hariyama and Miltank have high defensive stats and aren't weak to any of Arcanine's moves, and by running Thick Fat, obtain a useful resistance to Fire. Miltank has Earthquake to scare Arcanine out with, whereas Hariyama wields a wide array of Fighting moves off its own high Attack stat. Porygon2 makes for an interesting counter, since both of Arcanine's abilities can be used against it. It can cripple sweeper sets with paralysis, while Recover off the damage it takes as it slowly chips away at Arcanine's health with Thunderbolt.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Morning Glory (Physical Attacker)": {
        "description": "<p>While Morning Sun's recovery may not be as set in stone as moves like Recover and Soft-Boiled, it goes a long way in aiding Arcanine as it tears through teams, holding either a Life Orb (for increased damage) or Leftovers (for added survivability).</p> <p>Flare Blitz is Arcanine's main attack, while Extreme Speed cleans up anyone who can survive the attack. Morning Sun helps Arcanine recover from repeated recoil damage from both Flare Blitz and Life Orb (if you choose this item) as well as from entry hazard damage, though at the cost of a turn.</p> <p>The move in the last slot is mainly filler, although the choice is mainly decided by how you play Arcanine. More cautious players may opt to use Toxic, helping them to wear down counters, such as Hitmontop and Slowbro, who may try to stop your sweep. Will-O-Wisp is a cautious move, easily incapacitating physical sweepers, although the many Fire-types with Flash Fire and threatening Guts sweepers can diminish its usefulness. If you're looking to use Arcanine as a stand-alone sweeper, you may be interested in Thunder Fang or Iron Head, as they are the most competitively viable attacks Arcanine has at its disposal; Thunder Fang puts dents in Water-types, while Iron Head provides reliable damage with a chance to flinch. The EVs given allow Arcanine to outspeed base 80s who possess a Speed-boosting nature, most notably Jolly Venusaur.</p> <p>Arcanine is often seen abusing strong sunlight in an attempt to increase the HP recovered by Morning Sun to 2/3 of its total HP. Leads who can set up Sunny Day, such as Ambipom, Uxie and Claydol, are great additions to a team based around Arcanine (Uxie and Claydol more so, thanks to their Ground-type immunities). The bulky and powerful Tangrowth is a great complementary sweeper for Arcanine, since it can provide status support and counter Water-types for Arcanine. In return, Arcanine can sponge super effective Fire-type attacks aimed at Tangrowth. Any Grass-type with the Chlorophyll ability will enjoy being on a Sunny Day team with Arcanine.</p> <p>Flash Fire is also a viable ability choice, although it isn't a superior choice unless Arcanine is placed on a Sunny Day team. This is a great environment for Arcanine since it gives Flare Blitz double STAB. Flash Fire's usefulness is also greatly influenced by Arcanine's teammates; if there are any Grass-types on its team, Arcanine can boost the power of its Fire-type attacks very easily, thanks to type synergy.</p> <p>Having a way to take care of auto-weather effects from Hippopotas and Snover is recommended, since Morning Sun's recovery drops from 1/2 Arcanine's total HP in normal battle conditions to a low 1/4. Since both of these threats are typically seen as leads, they can easily be disposed of by your own lead. Ambipom is able to break their Focus Sash with Fake Out and use either Sunny Day to counter their weather effects or Return to nab the KO.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>While Arcanine is usually seen as a sweeper because of his high Attack and Speed stats, he has all the necessary tools to function as an effective specially defensive tank. Arcanine's good HP and Defense, naturally high Attack and Speed, and access to a reliable recovery move, Morning Sun, allow him to safely switch into and beat many top-tier special sweepers one-on-one.</p> <p>With maxed out HP and Special Defense stats, Arcanine becomes a formidable special tank. This Arcanine is able to switch into some of UU's strongest special attackers and eliminate them. Even with no investment in his Attack stat, Flare Blitz and Extreme Speed still hit hard enough to take care of physically frail sweepers such as Alakazam and Mismagius, as well as targets hit super effectively, such as Venusaur. Toxic is Arcanine's main source of damage against walls such as Milotic and bulkier sweepers such as Moltres; both of the aforementioned Pokemon can generally be stalled out with Morning Sun.</p> <p>Here are some damage calculations that demonstrate Arcanine's impressive special bulk:</p> <ul> <li>Timid 252 SpA Life Orb Alakazam Psychic: 43% - 50.8%</li> <li>Timid 252 SpA Mismagius Shadow Ball: 24.5% - 29.2%</li> <li>Timid 252 SpA Life Orb Venusaur Sludge Bomb: 34.6% - 40.9%</li> <li>Modest 252 SpA Life Orb Moltres Air Slash: 36.7% - 43.2%</li> <li>Timid 252 SpA Life Orb Houndoom Dark Pulse: 33.1% - 39.1%</li> <li>Timid 252 SpA Life Orb Rotom Thunderbolt: 35.2% - 41.7%</li> <li>Bold 0 SpA Milotic Surf: 44.3% - 53.1%</li> </ul> <p>With his special bulk, Arcanine can avoid being 2HKOed by the some of the strongest neutral special attacks UU has to offer, provided Stealth Rock is off the field. In return, Arcanine can 2HKO or Toxic stall each of these threats while recovering his health with Morning Sun. Arcanine also serves as an excellent lure for Milotic, whom he can Toxic and stall out with Morning Sun (unless Milotic has Toxic or Rest).</p> <p>Rapid Spin support is extremely important for this Arcanine. Due to his Fire typing, Arcanine loses 25% of his health each time he switches into Stealth Rock. As a result, many of the sweepers who normally only 3HKO Arcanine are able to 2HKO him with Stealth Rock on the field. Arcanine also has problems with strong physical attackers, such as Rhyperior, Azumarill, Feraligatr, and Aggron. Thus, a physically defensive Blastoise makes a great partner since Blastoise can hit Rock- and Ground-types for super effective damage with Surf. Blastoise can also wall any physical Water-types who may otherwise cause Arcanine problems.</p> <p>Other good teammates for this Arcanine include physical walls who can take strong Rock-, Ground-, and Water-type attacks. Leafeon, Torterra, Tangrowth, and Milotic are all excellent choices, especially since each of them has a reliable recovery move. Arcanine also dislikes any form of status, so a cleric is greatly appreciated. Thus, Leafeon is an ideal teammate; he has access to Heal Bell and, as previously mentioned, is an excellent physical wall.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to provide a great switch-in to many threats, hit its counters hard, and eventually sweep late-game. Arcanine has access to Flare Blitz, which is its main STAB attack and hits incredibly hard, with or without a Flash Fire boost. Thunder Fang and Hidden Power Grass provide decent coverage options for Arcanine, and while Thunder Fang seems like the better choice due to Arcanine's superior Attack, most of Hidden Power Grass's targets have a 4x weakness and are thus OHKOed. Thunder Fang is still recommended, however, since it nails Arcanine's most popular counters, such as Milotic, Slowking, and Blastoise harder. Extreme Speed is one of Arcanine's most useful assets, because it allows Arcanine to finish off weak, faster foes who would otherwise KO Arcanine. This is especially important due to the presence of Dugtrio. Morning Sun is used in the last slot so that Arcanine can switch in more often, and with Intimidate and Flash Fire, it definitely will find a turn to use it.</p> <p>With Arcanine's two excellent abilities, it can make a very effective switch-in to various threats. Flash Fire is recommended because not only does it allow Arcanine to destroy Weezing, Spiritomb, and most Fire-type Pokemon, but it also gives Arcanine extra firepower for Flare Blitz. Intimidate is still useful, however, since it allows Arcanine to switch in more reliably against Pokemon such as Leafeon.</p> <p>The choice between an Adamant and Jolly nature is based on what specific functions Arcanine needs to do for its team. If Arcanine needs to be able to revenge kill Rotom and Moltres, Jolly is necessary. That being said, Adamant is generally the better choice because it lets Arcanine more effectively finish off foes such as Milotic, Slowking, and Blastoise. It also lets Arcanine OHKO Dugtrio with Extreme Speed.</p> <p>This set naturally has trouble with bulky Water-type Pokemon. Milotic, for example, is able to switch into Arcanine and Recover off anything Arcanine can throw at it. However, if Milotic has been weakened by a Pokemon such as Blaziken, Kabutops, or Rhyperior, then Arcanine can finish it off with a quick Thunder Fang. Arcanine also needs some defensive support for switching into bulky Water-types. Venusaur and Sceptile easily switch into Milotic, Slowbro, Slowking, and Blastoise, though they need to stay clear of super effective attacks.</p> <p>Based on Arcanine's moveset, it will have trouble with different Pokemon. If Arcanine isn't carrying Thunder Fang, it will have trouble dealing with Moltres, so packing a bulky Water-type to switch in is recommended. Without Hidden Power Grass, Rhyperior poses a problem. Rhyperior is a little more difficult to switch into than Moltres, but once again, Milotic works quite well.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>When donning a Choice Band, Arcanine's power increases to demi-godly levels. Provided you predict correctly, Arcanine is sure to cause major damage to the opponent's team, as hard counters to this set are few and far between. However, it is important to remember that one incorrect prediction can easily spell the end of this legendary dog, since this set lacks the ability to freely switch moves or heal with Morning Sun after being locked into an ineffective attack. In addition, Flare Blitz recoil and entry hazard damage can quickly add up, especially with Arcanine's weakness to Stealth Rock, so this set cannot be played recklessly.</p> <p>Flare Blitz, packing a whopping 180 Base Power with STAB factored in, will easily obliterate any Pokemon who doesn't resist it and even some who do. Extreme Speed is one of the most powerful priority attacks available in the tier, making it a great move for cleaning up frail sweepers who would otherwise outspeed and KO Arcanine. Thunder Fang is Arcanine's best bet against Moltres and bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Azumarill, all of whom would otherwise switch in on Arcanine with impunity. Morning Sun rounds out the set as a sort of filler move, while providing a source of much-needed recovery. Although it might seem counterintuitive to use Morning Sun over a fourth attack on a Choice set, Arcanine actually has a decent amount of opportunities to recover his health, since many times opponents will switch out in fear of a strong Flare Blitz or Extreme Speed. However, keep in mind that Arcanine will be a sitting duck when using Morning Sun; as in all cases when using this set, prediction is imperative to success. Iron Head may be used as an alternative that hits Rock-types super effectively, but it's rather weak and won't even come close to 2HKOing Regirock or Rhyperior. Finally, Hidden Power Grass is useful for doing huge amounts of damage to Kabutops, Omastar, and Rhyperior, but it doesn't really fit in well on a Choice Band set.</p> <p>While it might seem sufficient to simply spam Flare Blitz to inflict copious amounts of carnage on your opponent's team, keep in mind that it will likely be the first move your opponent expects Arcanine to use. Thus, it might be a smart idea to double switch to a Pokemon who can take care of common switch-ins like Milotic or Rhyperior the first time Arcanine is out, such as Venusaur. Alternatively, Arcanine can use his coverage moves to catch these switch-ins off guard; Thunder Fang can nab the 2HKO on Milotic and other bulky Water-types with some hazard support, while Hidden Power Grass may be used to obliterate Rock-types like Rhyperior. After these threats are eliminated, cleaning up the rest of your opponent's team with Flare Blitz should be a breeze.</p> <p>The EVs on this set are pretty straightforward, with Attack and Speed maxed out so that Arcanine can sweep better. Either nature can work fine, and it's important to keep in mind which speed tier Arcanine hits with each nature. If Arcanine is Jolly, he safely outpaces every Pokemon slower than Timid Rotom and ties with other base 95s like Leafeon and Houndoom. Meanwhile, an Adamant nature brings Arcanine down to only outpacing base 80s like Blaziken and Venusaur but provides a significant power kick. Thus, which nature Arcanine uses will usually come down to the rest of your team and which threats you need him to check.</p> <p>Both of Arcanine's excellent abilities work fine on this set; the choice depends on how you plan to use him. Intimidate allows for an easier time switching in on weaker physical attackers, thus allowing Arcanine to act as somewhat of a defensive measure, while retaining his proficiency as an offensive powerhouse. However, Flash Fire can turn Arcanine's Flare Blitz into an unstoppable force if he gets the boost. While this is easier said than done, there are many opportunities to do so with Will-O-Wisp, Flamethrower, and Flare Blitz flying around the metagame.</p> <p>Like any other offensively-oriented Pokemon, Arcanine appreciates entry hazard support. Qwilfish can switch in on Milotic with ease and proceed to set up multiple layers of Spikes, enabling Arcanine to get the 2HKO the next time he comes in. Likewise, Registeel takes little damage from any of Milotic's attacks and can set up Stealth Rock. Arcanine also detests entry hazards on his side of the field, since he will get worn down rather quickly with Stealth Rock stripping 25% of his health every time he comes in. Thus, Rapid Spinners like Kabutops, Donphan, and Blastoise all make fine partners for Arcanine. Finally, Pokemon who can eliminate Arcanine's few checks obviously pair well with him; Venusaur can OHKO any Water-type with his strong STAB attacks, while Milotic can wall Rock- and Ground-types and stall out opposing Milotic with Toxic.</p>"
      },
      "Attacking Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Arcanine's good all-round stats allow it to be both bulky and yet hit extremely hard at the same time. This fact, combined with its Intimidate ability and access to Extreme Speed, allows it to function as a very effective anti-lead.</p> <p>Flare Blitz is a high powered STAB attack that does big damage to pretty much anything that doesn't resist it. Extreme Speed allows Arcanine to beat Focus Sash users without having to take another attack, and can 2HKO some faster, frailer leads. Against Arcanine, the bulky Water switch in is almost inevitable, and a well-timed Toxic can cripple both Slowbro and Milotic (despite activating Marvel Scale, if it doesn't have Rest, it's not going to enjoy Toxic). Steel-types never switch into Arcanine, and Poison is often paired with Grass, meaning there is usually very little risk involved in using Toxic.</p> <p>Arcanine has a couple of different moves that all work well in the last slot. Hidden Power Grass is noted because otherwise, Rock- and Water-types fear next to nothing from this set. Since Kabutops and Omastar are occasionally seen as Stealth Rock / Spikes leads, being able to hit them with a 4x super effective attack has great benefits. Hidden Power Grass also lets Arcanine do a bit of damage to incoming Slowbro, although with no Special Attack investment the damage isn't enough to 2HKO. Overheat is another good choice for the last slot. It can be used when you're low on health and can't afford the recoil from Flare Blitz, when you've been Intimidated, or when you want to hit high-Defense Pokemon, such as Steelix, Cloyster, and Gligar, convincingly hard.</p> <p>Attack is maximized to give Arcanine as strong a Flare Blitz and Extreme Speed as possible, and to allow it to put out enough damage in the lead scenario to KO the opposing Pokemon. The Speed EVs allow it to outrun +Speed base 60s, while the remaining EVs are allocated into HP to bulk Arcanine up. Lum Berry is a great item on a leading Pokemon, allowing Arcanine to easily come out on top against status leads such as Venusaur.</p> <p>One of the most appealing things about this set is that it can function as a good revenge killer with Extreme Speed later on in the game as well. It is not limited to just the lead scenario, and with its decent defensive stats and Intimidate, can become a real asset for the team later on too by revenge killing fast, frail sweepers. Since this set will be leading, it generally doesn't need too much in the way of support to be effective. However, if you're not running Hidden Power Grass, having a way to deal with Rock/Water-types is recommended, as otherwise they can just sit there and Spike (Omastar) or Swords Dance (Kabutops) away. Having a good switch-in to Moltres is useful as well, as Arcanine can't really damage it outside of poisoning it.</p>"
      },
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>While Arcanine's sweeping prowess is certainly his most appealing attribute, it would be foolish to underestimate his bulk and defensive capabilities. With decent HP and Defense stats and an excellent ability in Intimidate, Arcanine has all the necessary tools to shut down many of the powerful physical attackers in the tier. Even though Arcanine can take on a variety of different physical attackers, keep in mind that the UU environment is not especially friendly to physically defensive Fire-types due to the widespread use of Stealth Rock and the popularity of Water-, Rock-, and Ground-type physical attackers, such as Azumarill, Rhyperior, and Donphan, respectively.</p> <p>Will-O-Wisp is the crux of this set, instantly crippling any physical sweeper who isn't a Fire-type or has the ability Guts. It is an especially effective move on Arcanine when you consider that some of the aforementioned physical attackers are among the most popular switch-ins to Arcanine. Thus, Arcanine will often catch Pokemon such as Kabutops, Feraligatr, and Rhyperior looking to switch in and wreak havoc off guard, instantly rendering them nearly useless for the remainder of the match. Morning Sun is another necessity, since Arcanine's HP will frequently need to be replenished after taking entry hazard damage and tanking attacks. Flare Blitz and Extreme Speed are the only two attacks Arcanine really needs, as Flare Blitz provides a reliable and powerful STAB attack that will still hurt many frail sweepers, while Extreme Speed serves as a useful priority move that can pick off faster foes.</p> <p>The EVs are relatively simple, as almost all of them are poured into HP and Defense so that Arcanine becomes as physically bulky as possible. The 28 Speed EVs are thrown in to ensure Arcanine outpaces 252 Speed Jolly Torterra by one point, allowing him to KO or cripple Torterra with Flare Blitz or Will-O-Wisp before Torterra can act. Even though Arcanine can take quite a few hits before going down, he is by no means a dedicated physical tank who can take on any and all attackers. Strong super effective STAB attacks from the likes of Choice Band Azumarill, Choice Band Rhyperior, and Life Orb Kabutops will still threaten to KO Arcanine as long as Arcanine has not hit them with both Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp. Thus, it is advisable to pack Pokemon who can deal with these threats separately and leave Arcanine to deal with physical attackers who can only muster neutral or non-STAB super effective attacks against Arcanine, such as Scyther, Swords Dance Sceptile, and Leafeon.</p> <p>Although the given moveset is probably the best combination of moves in terms of overall utility, there are some other options that can be used. Toxic may be used over Extreme Speed so that Arcanine isn't completely helpless against some of the bulkier Fire-type sweepers with access to reliable recovery, like Moltres and opposing Arcanine. Toxic also comes in handy against bulky Water-types, since they don't particularly mind being burned but are severely crippled by Toxic. If you want Arcanine to effectively wall some set up sweepers, then Roar can be used in the last slot to phaze them out.</p> <p>Since this set is geared towards walling physical attackers, special walls make natural defensive complements. Chansey and Milotic are the most obvious choices for this role, as they are two of the sturdiest special sponges in the tier, easily taking on Moltres and other strong sweepers. Bulky variants of Qwilfish also pair up well with this set, as they can easily come in on most bulky Water-types and proceed to set up Spikes. Finally, Rapid Spin support is an absolute must, since Arcanine will need to switch in repeatedly to take hits. Donphan and Blastoise are two prominent spinners who work well with Arcanine.</p>"
      },
      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<p>Arcanine can be a valuable asset to any team that requires an effective shuffler. His real selling point is his ability, Intimidate, which drops the opponent's Attack by one stage and helps your team deal with physical sweepers much more easily. Arcanine can force the opponent to reveal team members by utilizing Roar on Pokemon like Chansey, Registeel, Steelix, and Scyther as they switch out in fear of his STAB Fire-type moves, expelling the switch-in and revealing the opponent's best answer for Arcanine in general. This is the perfect opportunity to take advantage of entry hazards on the field, which chip away at the opponent's health slowly and wear them down for the sweepers on your team. Since Flare Blitz receives STAB and has 120 Base Power, it can scare away many foes, and Arcanine will find himself juggling the opponent's team the entire match if they don't pack enough strong Water-, Rock-, or Ground-type moves.</p> <p>Rest is essential to the set because it allows Arcanine to heal off the damage after taking previous blows from the opponent. The key move in this set is Sleep Talk, which can surprise an opponent because it is usually the last thing they will find on an Arcanine. Sleep Talk can randomly fire off Flare Blitz or Roar, which can make the opponent think twice before they switch in their Arcanine counter. When selected by Sleep Talk, Roar also loses its negative priority, and thus can be used to phaze out an opposing Pokemon before it even has a chance to move. This 'sleep shuffling' strategy can be particularly effective against more defensive teams, which often don't have many Pokemon who can outspeed Arcanine. The EVs are straightforward: their main purpose is to maximize Arcanine's ability to take physical hits. The remaining 4 Speed EVs can be helpful to outspeed 0 Speed Drapion and other base 95s, such as Uxie.</p> <p>Arcanine naturally forces plenty of switches due to his impressive attacking stats, both physically and specially. It is highly recommended that all three entry hazards are placed on the field to take advantage of this. Toxic Spikes can be critical to help deal with those pesky Water-types who effortlessly counter Arcanine.</p> <p>Venusaur is the perfect partner for Arcanine, thanks to his ability to take both physical and special Water-type attacks well and strike back with a STAB Grass-type attack or Sleep Powder. He can come in on Slowbro (barring Psychic) and Milotic's attacks quite easily and will usually force them out. While they are switching, Venusaur can set up with Swords Dance or Leech Seed. Flash Fire users like Houndoom and Ninetales are a problem for Arcanine, as his Fire-type attacks will only give them more power. Since Houndoom and Ninetales are specially-based Pokemon, Chansey is your safest switch-in to cushion their attacks. Specially defensive Altaria also pairs up well with Arcanine, assuming you can provide Rapid Spin support, as it resists Water-type attacks, is immune to Ground-type attacks, and has a high Special Defense stat to complement Arcanine's focus on physical Defense.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Since most Arcanine sets take advantage of the doggie's excellent base 110 Attack stat, his perfectly usable base 100 Special Attack stat is often neglected. While it is true that Arcanine is better off utilizing a physical set most of the time, a special set is perfectly viable and can pose as a major offensive threat. Although other special Fire-type sweepers like Houndoom and Moltres somewhat outclass Arcanine in this role, Arcanine offers much better bulk and reliable recovery over the former and better abilities, a lesser weakness to Stealth Rock, and superior Speed over the latter.</p> <p>Fire Blast is Arcanine's STAB attack of choice for this set; his lower Special Attack means that the high Base Power of Fire Blast is preferred over the reliability of Flamethrower. In the same vein, a Modest nature is listed as the main option because Arcanine could really use the power boost. The Hidden Power of choice provides excellent coverage alongside Arcanine's STAB move, hitting bulky Water-types super effectively. Hidden Power Grass gives Arcanine a way to OHKO Rhyperior and deal heavy damage to other Rock-types, whereas Hidden Power Electric covers Qwilfish and Moltres. Morning Sun is another necessity for this set, since entry hazards and Life Orb recoil are a pain to deal with without a source of reliable recovery. The last slot is mostly filler, but Dragon Pulse does have some uses, hitting Altaria super effectively and providing a solid attack that garners neutral coverage against Fire-types like Houndoom and opposing Arcanine who would otherwise easily wall or set up on this set. Alternatively, Overheat can be used for a burst of immediate power that boasts better accuracy than Fire Blast; just keep in mind that Arcanine will almost always have to switch out after using it.</p> <p>Just as for the physical attacker, both abilities have their uses. Flash Fire can potentially turn Fire Blast into an extremely powerful attack that will incinerate all neutral targets, while Intimidate has more overall utility and lets Arcanine switch in more easily. Due to Arcanine's comparatively lower Special Attack stat, he will have some trouble breaking down the stronger special walls in the UU tier. Even with entry hazard support, it will be extremely hard to overcome dedicated walls like Milotic, Slowking, and Chansey. Thus, packing a physical wallbreaking partner for Arcanine is a great idea. Grass-types like Torterra, Leafeon, and Swords Dance Venusaur are perhaps the best options for this role, as they can easily break through bulky Water-types. Another option is to pair Arcanine with another Fire-type sweeper like Moltres or Houndoom; one sweeper can sacrifice himself to severely weaken their shared counters, paving the way for the other to clean up.</p> <p>Choice Specs can work as the item here, but it is not recommended as the first option because it takes away much of Arcanine's utility without hitting hard enough to warrant locking Arcanine into one move. However, if you do choose to go this route, Arcanine will have a much better chance to 2HKO Milotic with Stealth Rock support with Hidden Power Grass and will easily do the same to Specially Defensive Arcanine with Hidden Power Rock. Overheat becomes a much more enticing option with Choice Specs, boasting huge amounts of power. Despite this, Choice Specs Arcanine lacks the raw power and priority of Choice Band Arcanine and is directly outclassed by Moltres, who can use the same set but with a stronger neutral option in Air Slash.</p> <p>As with every other Arcanine set, successfully managing entry hazards is paramount for getting the most out of this set. Keeping Stealth Rock and Spikes off the field with a spinner, such as Donphan or Blastoise, makes Arcanine's job much easier by relieving him of the burden of taking huge chunks of health just by switching in. On the other hand, setting up your own entry hazards will greatly aid a potential Arcanine sweep. Omastar is a great candidate, since he can set up all three entry hazards while also luring Grass-types for Arcanine to switch in against.</p>"

  "Machoke": {
    "overview": "<p>Machoke may not be as strong as his OU counterpart Machamp, but his blend of a base 100 Attack stat and decent 80/70/60 defenses provide him with the tools he needs in order to succeed in the UU metagame. No Guard and Dynamic Punch set him apart from other Fighting-types in the UU metagame, and his unique movepool makes him an optimal choice as a lead.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Machoke could utilize a Substitute set, which would allow him to be an effective mid-game attacker, much like SubChamp in OU. Using Dynamic Punch's 100% confusion rate in conjunction with Substitute and coverage moves would enable Machoke to survive and combat opponents for multiple turns. He lacks the immediate power and bulk of SubPunchers like Hariyama, however. A Choice Band set is viable, being able to 2HKO most of the tier. However, aside from the 100% accurate Dynamic Punch, he is greatly outclassed by Hariyama in this regard.</p> <p>Earthquake could prove useful against any of the Poison-types in the tier, including Toxicroak and Muk. However, Dynamic Punch already hits Steel types hard, which lessens Earthquake's potential. Ice Punch is a great coverage move, enabling Machoke to hit Pokemon like Venusaur, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen for big damage. For most sets, Dynamic Punch is obviously the Fighting move of choice, but if one wishes for more power, or if one is running a Guts set, Machoke does have access to Close Combat, Revenge, Superpower, and Cross Chop.</p> <p>In terms of support moves, Scary Face is a viable move and gives Machoke a way to severely cripple switch-ins who outspeed Machoke. Scary Face also works well in conjunction with Spikes and Stealth Rock, enabling Machoke to play the role of a phazer with the numerous switches Scary Face will cause. Encore is a useful move in conjunction with Substitute, locking Pokemon attempting to set up on Machoke into their boosting or status move. Toxic is a great choice to harm Machoke's normal counters, including Slowbro, Slowking, and non-Rest variants of Spiritomb. It is important to note that Toxic will never miss, thanks to No Guard. The only useful boosting move Machoke receives is Bulk Up, which can be used to some effect in conjunction with Dynamic Punch. However, a Bulk Up set is mostly outclassed by Hitmontop and Hariyama due to their higher offensive and defensive stats.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Spiritomb is most likely the greatest threat to Machoke, being immune to his STAB attack and taking neutral damage from all other attacks. In return, he can Will-O-Wisp Machoke, making him near useless, or start setting up with Calm Mind or Nasty Plot. Slowbro and Slowking are close seconds, both resisting his STAB attack, while their ability naturally prevents confusion. They can then fire off STAB Psychics to quickly dispatch of Machoke. Weezing shares similar resistances with Slowbro while having immense physical bulk and access to Will-O-Wisp. Venusaur can come in on Machoke relatively safely, although he will not like the confusion caused by Dynamic Punch nor a hit from Ice Punch. He can then put Machoke to sleep and set up or use Leech Seed.</p> <p>Machoke suffers from incredibly low Speed. This can be taken advantage of by numerous offensive switch-ins, like Moltres and Alakazam. However, there are very few Pokemon that like switching into one of Machoke's Dynamic Punches, so keep this in mind.</p>",

Dynamic Punch is the major pull to using Machoke as a lead, as it not only hits any Pokemon who don't resist it for major damage, but also guarantees confusion on slower leads like Omastar and Rhyperior, as well as incoming Pokemon intended to counter Machoke such as Scyther and Moltres. Confusion is what makes Machoke such a great anti-lead, either giving your opponent a 50% chance of getting up Stealth Rock or Spikes, or forcing your opponent to switch, thus preventing hazards from being set up. Confusion also prevents common switch-ins from a guaranteed attack on Machoke, giving him a chance to retaliate and KO, or switch to an appropriate counter at little cost.</p> <p>The second option comes down to which popular lead your team wants to OHKO: Moltres or Alakazam. Payback hits Alakazam for an OHKO, while Rock Slide guarantees the OHKO on Moltres. Bullet Punch may seem trivial, but it's one of the most important moves on Machoke, helping him take out other Focus Sash leads like Alakazam and Ambipom, and often turning 3HKOs and 4HKOs into 2HKOs and 3HKOs. Protect rounds out the set, allowing Machoke to defeat the popular Fake Out users of UU, like Ambipom and Kangaskhan. It also doubles as a scouting method, effectively dealing with leads he cannot combat using his attacking moves, like Trick users.</p> <p>A choice needs to be made between Rock Slide and Payback. Rock Slide hits Moltres for a guaranteed OHKO, while also hitting the Bug- and Flying-types of UU, which include Scyther and Venomoth, for super effective damage. Note that Machoke must be at full health to deal with the majority of these switch-ins, so that he can use his Focus Sash to survive the would-be OHKO. Payback, on the other hand, guarantees a win against Alakazam leads. Payback also hits non-bulky variants of Rotom and Mismagius for OHKOs, and has a higher Base Power than Rock Slide, assuming that Machoke is the slowest Pokemon on the field. The choice also depends on your own team and determining what opposing leads will give the team trouble in the long run.</p> <p>It is possible to drop Protect altogether, placing Payback and Rock Slide on the same set, to deal with both Moltres and Alakazam leads. However, Ambipom can 2HKO Machoke with Fake Out + Return, forcing Machoke out and reducing his role in the match. Machoke also loses his ability to scout other leads and switch-ins, as well as his ability to scout Trick users.</p> <p>Focus Sash is necessary to survive Psychic from Alakazam and Air Slash from Moltres without getting OHKOed. It's possible to run a Lum Berry to prevent any Ghost from burning Machoke with Will-O-Wisp, allowing you to KO most of them (bar Spiritomb). However, without a Focus Sash, Machoke will automatically lose to leads like Alakazam and Moltres. A type-resist Berry is also acceptable, letting Machoke survive Psychic or Air Slash with slightly more HP than Focus Sash allows, but note that Focus Sash still beats both leads effectively and provides a cushion against powerful neutral attacks.</p> <p>The EVs are designed to give Machoke as much attacking power as possible, while still outrunning certain leads and tanks to prevent Stealth Rock from being set up. With an Adamant nature and 252 Attack EVs, Machoke hits a respectable 328 Attack stat, more than enough to cause massive damage to opposing leads and switch-ins. 100 Speed EVs allow him to outrun the standard lead Hariyama by one point, as well as any Pokemon slower than Hariyama (including Rhyperior, Omastar, Regirock, Donphan, Chansey and Registeel). The remaining EVs are dumped into HP in order that Machoke can take weak neutral hits better.</p> <p>Machoke will have immense problems against Spiritomb leads, against which he can do very little. Machoke also has trouble against Uxie and Mesprit leads because of their Speed, although Mesprit is 2HKOed with Payback. The only popular leads that will be able to set up Stealth Rock against Machoke are Uxie, Mesprit, Kabutops, and Donphan. Donphan is slower than Machoke, but has enough bulk to survive two or three Dynamic Punches. The other three simply are faster than Machoke. For these reasons, pairing Machoke with a Spiritomb is often the best choice to deal with the leads Machoke cannot beat, successfully countering each Pokemon with his bulk and support-based moves. A Rapid Spinner like Donphan or Claydol ensures that Stealth Rock will not be on the field very long after these leads place them down. Chansey, Registeel, and Milotic also make fine partners to combat powerful special attackers like Moltres and Alakazam when Machoke lacks the appropriate move.</p>"

  "Rapidash": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Rapidash may seem like a run-of-the-mill Fire-type who is outclassed by Arcanine and Ninetales, but this is not entirely true. Rapidash plays rather uniquely. It has a few support options, blazingly fast Speed (pardon the pun), an immunity to Fire-type attacks thanks to its Flash Fire ability, and respectable offensive stats. Despite Rapidash's limited movepool, it can still be a valuable asset to any team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There isn't much else Rapidash can do that Arcanine or Ninetales can't. Rapidash is capable of running a SunnyBeamer set, but other Fire-types can generally do this better. Rapidash also has access to Bounce and Toxic for spreading paralysis or Toxic stalling, respectively. However, these sets are not particularly effective since Rapidash is forced out rather easily and cannot afford to switch in many times due to its Stealth Rock weakness. Rapidash also learns Poison Jab, but Megahorn is generally a better choice.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Earthquake from anyone with a respectable Attack stat will KO or cripple Rapidash. Specially defensive Donphan is an excellent counter, as it can shrug off anything Rapidash has to throw at it. Dugtrio is also a good option, but can't switch in on Rapidash safely. Thanks to its ability, however, it can trap and OHKO Rapidash with Earthquake. Slowbro can take on the Standard Pony set, but can be 2HKOed by Hidden Power Grass from the mixed set. Milotic is generally going to be the best answer to any and all Rapidash sets. With its natural bulk and respectable Special Attack, it can switch in on almost any move, take advantage of any status inflicted onto it, and OHKO with STAB Surf. Arcanine can also counter Rapidash well since it resists all of Rapidash's attacks.</p> <p>Anyone with a STAB Aqua Jet will also make Rapidash think twice about staying in. Azumarill is an excellent candidate for this due to its natural bulk and massive Attack stat. Feraligatr and Kabutops can also take on Rapidash, but the latter should be careful about switching into Hidden Power Grass.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>One of Rapidash's best assets is its access to Will-O-Wisp and Hypnosis, which allows it to take out its counters and support its team. These two moves pair wonderfully with Rapidash's above average Speed. Flare Blitz is Rapidash's strongest STAB move, and coming off of Rapidash's base 100 Attack stat, will hurt anyone who doesn't resist it. Megahorn differentiates Rapidash from other Fire-types. While the type coverage may seem redundant, Megahorn helps against bulky Water-type switch-ins, especially Slowbro and Slowking. Return is also an option if you are concerned about opposing Fire-types.</p> <p>A Jolly nature and 252 Speed EVs allow Rapidash to Speed tie with Scyther and Mismagius, while 252 Attack EVs let Rapidash deal as much damage as possible. If you aren't concerned about Mismagius and Scyther, you can opt to run a slightly bulkier spread of 84 HP / 248 Atk / 176 Spe. 84 HP EVs give Rapidash 292 HP, allowing it to switch into Stealth Rock an extra time and slightly increase its overall bulk. 176 Speed EVs allow Rapidash to outpace all positive natured base 95s. The rest of the EVs are placed into Attack. Other options include Hidden Power Grass, which allows Rapidash to take out Rhyperior, Kabutops, and Omastar. Toxic is also a decent option in the last slot, as it allows Rapidash to cripple some hard counters like Milotic and Moltres.</p> <p>Due to Rapidash's Stealth Rock weakness and Spikes vulnerability, a Rapid Spinner would do well as a teammate. Blastoise works well as it can switch into bulky Water-types; in return, Rapidash can take the odd Grass-type attack aimed at Blastoise. Kabutops is also an acceptable spinner if you wish to go for a more offensive approach. In general, anyone who benefits from weakened physical attackers is a great partner for this set. Sceptile and Venusaur are good teammates for Rapidash, as they can come in on the bulky Water-types who Rapidash lures out and set up with Swords Dance or Substitute. Other Grass-types, such as Leafeon and Tangrowth, can work with this set as well. Special walls such as Milotic and, to a lesser extent, Chansey benefit from burned physical attackers.</p> <p>The counters for this set are essentially the same as the counters for every other Fire-type Pokemon: fast Earthquake users and strong Water-types. Aqua Jet Azumarill can counter this set, provided it doesn't get burned. Fire-types can do a pretty good job of taking on this set since they are immune to Will-O-Wisp and resist Flare Blitz and Megahorn. However, they should be wary of Hypnosis. Milotic is a great counter for this set; RestTalk variants work especially well since they can Rest off the burn inflicted by Will-O-Wisp. Rock-type Pokemon can also counter this set with ease. While most of them do not enjoy being burned, Omastar can take the burn and KO from the special side.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Rapidash's decent base 80 Special Attack, respectable base 100 Attack, and high base 105 Speed mean that it is perfectly capable of running an efficient mixed set. Fire Blast is Rapidash's most powerful special attack, while Hidden Power Grass hits bulky Water-types for decent damage and OHKOes Omastar. Megahorn takes out would-be walls, such as Slowking and Grumpig, who can take on Fire Blast and Hidden Power Grass without breaking a sweat. Naive is the preferred nature because it allows Rapidash to run more EVs in Attack while maintaining some more physical bulk, which can pay off if you use Will-O-Wisp as the final move. Hypnosis and Will-O-Wisp can both fit in the last slot, as they allow Rapidash to cripple its counters.</p> <p>If you don't wish to take away from Rapidash's Special Defense, a Mild nature is useable with an EV spread of 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe. With this alternate EV spread, however, you will lose out on some important 2HKOs, such as on Slowking and Grumpig. Morning Sun is a possible option over Will-O-Wisp or Hypnosis if you wish to increase Rapidash's longevity. Those are really the only other options for this set; poor Rapidash was cursed with an extremely small movepool.</p> <p>Rapidash's Stealth Rock weakness limits its ability to switch in, so a Rapid Spinner such as Kabutops or Blastoise will benefit this set greatly. Strong Grass-types such as Sceptile, Venusaur, Leafeon, and company can all benefit from Rapidash's tendency to lure out bulky Water-types, essentially getting a free turn to attack or set up. Other Fire-types can also benefit from this set because of its ability to weaken opposing Water-types.</p> <p>The counters for the above set apply for this set as well. Specially defensive Donphan can survive a Hidden Power Grass or Fire Blast and easily OHKO back with Earthquake, but cannot switch in on either of the aforementioned attacks, as it will be 2HKOed. Milotic fears nothing from this set and can strike back with a super effective Surf or Hydro Pump. Azumarill and Feraligatr can switch in and take Rapidash out with Aqua Jet. Dugtrio can also be used to revenge kill this set, but cannot switch in on any of Rapidash's moves.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>At first, this set may seem odd; in most people's minds, a Pokemon with a Stealth Rock weakness and a fairly limited movepool is not going to be the first candidate for a choice set. Rapidash appears to be outclassed by Arcanine, but it can scout the opponent's switch-in with Baton Pass, something Arcanine cannot do. Megahorn is also a pretty neat move; with a whopping 120 Base Power, it will deal a chunk of damage to most Water-type switch-ins and dent Houndoom as well. Iron Tail may seem like a strange option, as it lacks STAB and has poor coverage. However, it will do a good amount of damage to Kabutops, Omastar, Rhyperior, and other Rock-types.</p> <p>The EVs are pretty straightforward: max Attack and max Speed to hit as hard and as fast as possible. The choice between Baton Pass and Iron Tail in the last slot is dependent on how you wish to play Rapidash. If you want to play conservatively and use Rapidash to scout your opponent's team, then Baton Pass is an ideal option. However, if you wish to be more aggressive, then Iron Tail is an excellent choice. Choosing between a Jolly or an Adamant nature is also a tough decision; an Adamant nature gives Iron Tail a chance to 2HKO Rhyperior, but a Jolly nature will let Rapidash Speed tie with max Speed Mismagius and Scyther.</p> <p>Quick Attack is also a decent option if you wish to pick off weakened, faster threats and pinch Berry users, but doesn't have much use outside of that. Double Kick is also a somewhat viable option, but using it means that Mismagius can switch in on two of Rapidash's attacks for free and proceed to set up.</p> <p>As with every other Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon in the game, a Rapid Spinner makes a wonderful teammate for Rapidash. This is especially true with a Choice set since switching will be more common. Blastoise is a decent option since it can take on most Water-types who Rapidash lures in. Donphan is also a good choice, as it can switch in on the bulky Rock-types who come in on Rapidash. Kabutops is a good option if you want a more offensive approach. Leafeon is a good teammate because it can come in on Rhyperior and get a free Swords Dance on the switch. Offensive Milotic is also a good partner since it can take advantage of the Water-types who Rapidash lures in. As far as counters go, Stealth Rock will wear down Rapidash very quickly, as will sandstorm or hail damage. Spikes further bring down Rapidash's miniscule HP stat; this problem is compounded by the fact that many common Spikes users can set up on Rapidash. Milotic fears nothing on this set and easily shrugs off any damage with Recover. Feraligatr can also set up on this set and force it out. Regirock and Rhyperior can cause problems for this set, as they are able to set up if Rapidash is using an ineffective move.</p>"
      },
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Pokemon XD, Rapidash can use Baton Pass to pass boosts to its teammates or to scout for counters. After an Agility boost, nobody will outspeed Rapidash, allowing it to execute its Baton Pass with incredible speed. Generally speaking, Rapidash will not be able to pass both Substitute and Agility, as it is rather frail and its Substitutes will easily be broken. Flare Blitz gives Rapidash some sort of attack so it cannot be shut down by Taunt users.</p> <p>There really are no other options for Rapidash. You could go with a Timid nature and Fire Blast instead of Flare Blitz, but Flare Blitz is almost always a better option because of its higher accuracy. Unfortunately, you cannot use Morning Sun or Hypnosis with Baton Pass on Rapidash because of breeding conflictions stemming from the fact that Baton Pass is only available on XD.</p> <p>Leftovers is an excellent item choice, but if you wish to take full advantage of Baton Pass, a pinch Berry may be equipped to pass an extra boost. To activate the Berry safely, Rapidash can first use Agility, and then Substitute down to 25% health. The pinch Berry strategy should be used late-game, however, as it only has one shot to work and is more successful when you know your opponent's team.</p> <p>Bulky, offensive Water-types are excellent recipients because of Rapidash's tendency to lure out Water-types. Milotic is a great choice because of its natural bulk and strong attacking moves. Azumarill is also a good option if you are looking for a physical recipient. Leafeon, Venusaur, Tangrowth, and basically any other offensive Grass-type are also good options since they can take the Water-type attacks aimed at Rapidash and proceed to outspeed and possibly OHKO said Water-type.</p> <p>Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes all hinder Rapidash's attempts to Baton Pass effectively, so a Rapid Spinner would be a very welcome teammate. Claydol is a decent option as it resists Stealth Rock and is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, but shares a Water-type weakness with Rapidash. Blastoise is a pretty solid option as well because of its decent bulk and resistance to Water-type moves. Donphan and Hitmontop can also be used, but their poor special bulk leaves them vulnerable against bulky Water-types.</p> <p>Phazers and Hazers shut down this set and strategy. The most threatening of these Pokemon is Milotic, who can take Rapidash's Flare Blitz and OHKO back with Surf. Aqua Jet users, such as Kabutops and Azumarill, can OHKO Rapidash before it can pass its boosts. Bulky Taunt users such as Drapion also mess up this set by preventing Rapidash from using Baton Pass.</p>"

  "Slowbro": {
    "overview": "<p>Slowbro is a bulky and reliable choice for many teams in UU with its ability to check a large portion of the physical sweepers in the tier. It can fit well into frail, offensive teams in need of a little insurance against the likes of Azumarill and Fighting-types, while also providing useful paralysis support and doing reasonable amounts of damage with its own attacks. Slowbro's low Speed is made up for by its good defenses, and this also makes it one of the most reliable users of Trick Room in the game. While commonly seen only as a defensive threat, Slowbro can also very quickly go onto the offensive with Calm Mind or Choice Specs, making the most of its respectable Special Attack and wide movepool.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Slowbro has a very wide movepool for a bulky Water, but unfortunately most of it is of little use. In addition to Surf, Psychic, Ice Beam, and Grass Knot, Slowbro can use Flamethrower, Fire Blast, Shadow Ball, Focus Blast, and Signal Beam. The Fire moves' only target in UU that isn't hit as hard by Ice Beam or Slowbro's STABs is Registeel, and it poses a minimal threat to Slowbro because Registeel has a low Attack stat and no form of recovery bar Rest. All the other moves have no notable targets that aren't hit suitably as hard by one of Slowbro's STABs.</p> <p>There are also several viable support moves that Slowbro can use and could be helpful depending on your team's needs. Yawn can cause a lot of switches, and Slowbro has the bulk to use it effectively. Counter is an interesting choice against Pokemon such as Scyther and Drapion, which will try to overpower Slowbro on the physical side with super effective moves, but it is quite unreliable as most players tend to prey on Slowbro's weaker Special Defense. Curse is quite a gimmicky option, and is better left to Slowking anyway, as its superior Special Defense allows it to pull it off more effectively.</p> <p>With Slowbro receiving physical Water STAB in the form of Aqua Tail from Platinum move tutors, a set utilizing Trick Room, Belly Drum, Aqua Tail and Zen Headbutt could be attempted. A Sitrus Berry is a good idea as it effectively halves the cost of using Belly Drum and is more beneficial for the make or break type of sweep Slowbro attempts with this strategy as compared to Leftovers' more consistent recovery. Slowbro's other physical attacks include Earthquake and Drain Punch, the latter of which might still be viable alongside Aqua Tail, especially if a Chansey comes in expecting a Surf as you Belly Drum. However, the entire strategy is very risky and situational, and so should not be relied on.</p> <p>Putting 252 EVs into Slowbro's HP should be the first step for almost all the sets, since it maximizes its overall bulkiness. Then the remainder of the EVs should be allocated into Defense for the more tankish sets, and Special Attack for the Specs set. Investing significantly in Special Defense is generally fruitless, as it detracts from Slowbro's physical hit-taking ability too much and because Milotic or Slowking perform better at special walling. For example, the standard Blaziken's Fire Blast followed by a Hidden Power Grass will beat Slowbro after Stealth Rock damage. Guaranteeing survival against this, taking into account the damage Slowbro sustains from Stealth Rock upon entry, would require you to run almost max Special Defense alongside max HP, at which point you're just better off using Slowking or Milotic.</p> <p>Running max HP and max Defense allows Slowbro to survive quite a few super effective physical attacks - with this investment, a max health Slowbro is guaranteed to never be OHKOed by a Choice Band Rhyperior's Megahorn, letting Slowbro retaliate with a last-ditch Surf. Reducing the HP stat down to 212 EVs and using a Leftovers number is not recommended, as it detracts from Slowbro's overall bulkiness, and the difference in Leftovers gain is insignificant when taking into account Stealth Rock.</p> <p>If you are particularly worried about Spiritomb, 44 Speed EVs allow Slowbro to outspeed minimum Speed versions. However, this is rarely a worthwhile investment because it is solely for Spiritomb, and Slowbro won't really be beating the ghost even if it is faster.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Venusaur can come in on Surf, Toxic, or Slack Off and pose an immediate threat to Slowbro with its powerful STAB Grass attacks. Sceptile fares similarly, and while it isn't quite as specially bulky as Venusaur, neither is it weak to Psychic. Torterra is immune to Thunder Wave, isn't hit super effectively by either of Slowbro's STABs, and has a high chance to OHKO with a Life Orb-boosted Wood Hammer after Stealth Rock. Ludicolo packs a 4x resistance to Surf and has a high Special Defense for taking Psychics as well. With its Grass STAB, it can use Energy Ball or Grass Knot to quickly dispose of Slowbro. Chansey and Clefable are both undaunted by status, Chansey because of Natural Cure and Clefable because of Magic Guard and its tendency to hold Toxic Orb. Both have very high Special Defense and threaten Slowbro with Toxics of their own. If Slowbro is carrying Thunder Wave over Toxic, Lanturn can come in without much trouble and threaten with a super effective STAB Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Spiritomb doesn't mind Toxic unduly since it often carries Rest, and threatens to come in on its Psychic immunity. Calm Mind versions are particularly dangerous to Slowbro as Spiritomb has 5 higher base Speed, and so can Calm Mind up to take less and less damage from Surf before it hits back with its own STAB super effective Dark Pulse. As long as Mismagius avoids Thunder Wave, it can take a weak hit with its base 105 Special Defense and OHKO Slowbro with Shadow Ball. Specially defensive Drapion can come in on a Psychic, prevent Slowbro from healing or statusing Drapion with Taunt, and then Swords Dance up and beat Slowbro with Crunch. Curse Registeel also sees Slowbro as nothing but setup fodder.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Slowbro is one of the physically bulkiest Water-types in the game, and its useful resistances to Fighting, Water, and Fire allow it to check a lot of UU's biggest threats. Instant recovery in the form of Slack Off means it has incredible staying power against physical sweepers, and its Psychic typing and ability to reliably spread paralysis with Thunder Wave set it firmly apart from other bulky Water-types such as Milotic. The combination of 95 base HP and 110 base Defense is very hard to break with neutral attacks, and when instant recovery is thrown on top of it, physical sweepers will struggle even more to bypass Slowbro. It brings a whole host of very threatening Pokemon, including Azumarill, Hariyama, Feraligatr, Hitmonlee, Hitmontop, Poliwrath, and Arcanine, to a grinding halt.</p> <p>Slack Off is a great asset, with the reliable recovery it provides allowing Slowbro to wall physical attackers all game long. Many physical sweepers cannot do over 50% to Slowbro even with super effective attacks, meaning it has little trouble alternating between attacking and recovering to stall them out. Surf utilizes Slowbro's primary Water STAB and coming off its base 100 Special Attack stat can do a sizable chunk to those that don't resist it, making it an obvious move choice.</p> <p>Psychic is an excellent choice as an auxiliary attack since it makes the most of Slowbro's secondary STAB, and more importantly, allows it to hit the myriad Fighting- and Poison-types of UU super effectively. A strong STAB Psychic makes quick work of Hitmonlee and Hitmontop, whose high Special Defense stats mean they can survive more Surfs than you'd care for, and it also allows you to break the Substitutes of bulkier Hariyama and Azumarill. In addition, it hits Venusaur very hard, ensures that physical Toxicroak doesn't threaten Slowbro in the slightest, and also enables it to actually damage other Water-types such as Milotic. Water and Psychic together have great neutral coverage, with the combination being resisted only by other Slowbro, Slowking, and Exeggutor in UU, whereas the Water and Ice combination used by many other bulky Waters lacks such good coverage.</p> <p>A status move in the last slot provides a way of threatening the Pokemon Slowbro cannot hurt significantly with its attacks. Both Thunder Wave and Toxic are viable options, and which one is more beneficial depends on the rest of the team. Thunder Wave brings many opposing Pokemon down to around Slowbro's Speed level and is very helpful when playing with a team of other slower sweepers such as Torterra and Hariyama. It's also particularly effective since almost all of the Pokemon that are immune to Thunder Wave will take massive damage from Slowbro's STAB attacks (watch out for Torterra, though). Toxic, on the other hand, gives Slowbro a greater ability to take opponents out itself with less support from its team; with Slack Off and its high defenses, Slowbro can outlast the majority of UU. Light Screen is a helpful option as it patches up Slowbro's lower Special Defense while at the same time supporting the rest of the team temporarily. However, it's worth noting that without a status move, many Pokemon will see Slowbro as a non-threat and will simply use it as a free switch in.</p> <p>While Slowbro's Water/Psychic dual typing does bring it many valuable resistances, it gives Slowbro quite a few exploitable weaknesses as well. Despite its bulk, which often allows Slowbro to survive even super effective physical attacks, you'll want to pair up Slowbro with a Pokemon that can take these hits more easily to take some of the pressure off of Slowbro. Venusaur, as well as being a big threat to Slowbro, also makes for a great partner with its ability to take the Grass and Electric attacks that Slowbro attracts. Venusaur also automatically absorbs Toxic Spikes upon switching in, which, despite their rarity, obviously destroy Slowbro's defensive potential. Specially defensive Clefable also has good synergy with Slowbro, possessing an immunity to Ghost-type attacks and the defensive stats to switch into threatening special attackers. If Clefable is already poisoned with Toxic Orb, it can come in on almost all Venusaur sets with ease due to its immunities to Sleep Powder and Leech Seed. It can also spread paralysis with Thunder Wave, and this defensive pairing makes a great backbone for teams based around slow attackers. Both these Pokemon can come into Toxic from defensive Milotic, which is a big problem for Slowbro if it isn't carrying Toxic itself, as it will be forced out by Milotic almost every time.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>While Slowbro usually plays the role of a passive, defensive bulky Water-type, Calm Mind provides a way for it to gradually become a very real offensive threat, while at the same time patching up Slowbro's less than stellar Special Defense. With access to Slack Off for instant recovery and good coverage with its STAB attacks, Slowbro makes for a reliable and powerful tank after a few boosts.</p> <p>Getting good coverage with only two attacks is of great importance on this set, since you will be heavily relying on them to do damage. Thankfully, Slowbro's Water and Psychic STABs pair up for neutral coverage on the vast majority of UU. When using Surf and Psychic, Special Attack investment is not really needed as Surf will 2HKO Chansey at +6, and Psychic will do the same to Milotic.</p> <p>Although it looks hard to stop on paper, Calm Mind Slowbro can run into several problems in practice. The biggest one is status, in particular Toxic. Slowbro is very vulnerable to Toxic from the likes of Milotic and Chansey, both of which can only be beaten by Slowbro after significant set up. Rest and Sleep Talk can be run over Psychic and Slack Off to greatly increase Slowbro's durability, but it would mean Slowbro is completely helpless against Toxicroak and other Pokemon immune to Water. Also, +6 Surf only manages 46% on average against Bold Milotic, and other Milotic might run even more Special Defense than that. Another problem is that strong Electric and Grass special attacks can OHKO Slowbro even after it has started to set up. The Special Defense investment helps this somewhat, and means that after two Calm Minds, Specs Sceptile Leaf Storm (the strongest special attack Slowbro will likely face) won't OHKO. Finally, Slowbro needs to be wary of Haze Milotic, since it can come in for free on 3/4 of Slowbro's moves and erase all its hard work in a single turn.</p> <p>For these reasons, Venusaur makes an almost ideal partner for a Calm Mind Slowbro - it resists both Electric and Grass, comes with a very useful immunity to Toxic, and instantly threatens Milotic. Opposing Venusaur' Leaf Storms will do miniscule damage, while you can threaten a 2HKO back with Sludge Bomb. Chansey and Milotic fail to leave much of a mark, and Venusaur can use Leech Seed to drain their health (which can later be passed to Slowbro if need be) or even set up Swords Dance on them. Nasty Plot Houndoom with a Passho Berry and Beat Up makes a great partner as well, since it lures in Milotic like no other and 2HKOs with +2 Dark Pulse while surviving a Surf because of the berry. It also gets a quick surprise kill on Chansey with Beat Up. Slowbro and Houndoom have pretty great type synergy together too, with Houndoom resisting Ghost, Dark, and Grass, and Slowbro providing Fighting and Water resistances. Chansey and Clefable are also good teammates to have because they can use Aromatherapy to cure any unexpected status ailments Slowbro gets afflicted with. The RestTalk version greatly appreciates Toxic Spikes on the opponent's field to help it beat the likes of Milotic.</p> <p>Encore users will ruin Slowbro's sweep, since it is so slow that they are almost guaranteed to outspeed it. Common Encore users include Clefable, Alakazam, Poliwrath, and Jumpluff. The best way to deal with them is to simply have a hard hitting teammate that can come in for free on the Encore and regain your momentum. Torterra works well with Slowbro here, its powerful Wood Hammer making short work of Clefable, Alakazam, and Poliwrath, and an immunity to Leech Seed helping it deal with Jumpluff. If you invest in its Special Defense, it makes an even more reliable check for Alakazam as well.</p>"

      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Slowbro and Slowking share a lot of things in common, and one of these is the ability to set up Trick Room. When opting for one of them on a Trick Room team, it is important to choose the right one for your team's needs, as both do a slightly different job well. There is little use trying to use Slowbro to both set up Trick Room and sweep during it, since Slowking has access to Nasty Plot, which allows it to become a threat much faster than Slowbro can with Calm Mind. Conversely, Slowbro is usually the preferable choice for a super bulky Trick Room supporter, as Slowbro's higher Defense stat makes the most of its resistances to common physical Fighting and Water attacks and allows it to do the job slightly better than its sibling.</p> <p>Surf and Psychic once again make for the best two attack combination. Slack Off allows Slowbro to come in and use Trick Room multiple times, which is a great asset to have as a Trick Room supporter since the field effect lasts for such a short period of time. Good partners for this Slowbro set are Pokemon that can make the most of Trick Room - namely slow, powerful, and preferably bulky sweepers. Rhyperior and Marowak are both extremely threatening in this regard and have some limited type synergy with Slowbro in that they can come in on predicted Electric attacks for free. However, because of the rarity of Electric-type attacks, and because of the shared crippling weakness to Grass, it's highly recommended to run a Pokemon that can come into Grass-type moves with little trouble alongside them. Hariyama is also a great partner, with Close Combat, one of the strongest physical attacks in UU, at its disposal. It can also increase its firepower even further by deliberately activating Guts with a Toxic or Flame Orb, or by using Bulk Up. However, this can often be hard to pull off, as the former slashes Hariyama's longevity, while the latter may come to naught as Hariyama is forced to switch once Trick Room runs out. Hariyama does have useful resistances to Dark and Bug to come in on, though.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Slowbro's biggest advantages over other more powerful Specs users is its ability to cripple Chansey and other special walls with a Tricked Choice Specs, and the surprise value involved when a cute, defensive hermit crab hits with enough power to 2HKO Clefable. That, and Slowbro's considerable bulk even with just HP investment making up for its abysmal Speed, make Slowbro a slow but powerful Choice Specs tank.</p> <p>Surf and Psychic get great neutral coverage in UU by themselves, and this is an excellent quality for any Specs user since prediction is much less of an issue when you can just choose between your powerful STAB attacks to throw out and catch the switch-in. Trick is a self-explanatory move, ruining the walling potential of any Chansey that comes in to Toxic Slowbro. However, it should be noted that Tricking straightaway against an unscouted team is not advised at all - it's much better to hit an incoming Venusaur or Sceptile with Psychic than give them a power boost, especially in the case of Sceptile, which often wields Specs itself and will then gets a free attack against your team. In the last slot, Slack Off will let Slowbro function more like a wall once it has tricked his Specs away, and even while it is still holding them in a pinch. Grass Knot completes the attacking combination for perfect coverage, 2HKOing the most specially defensive of Milotic and giving you an attack to hit opposing Slowbro and Slowking with as well.</p> <p>Using Pokemon that can take advantage of weakened and Choice-locked special walls maximizes the potency of this set. Since Clefable is 2HKOed by Specs Surf, and if predicted right, Chansey will be locked into a single move, SubRoost Moltres can make for a deadly partner. Clefable is one of its biggest checks because of its pseudo-immunity to Toxic, and so once Clefable is weakened, it can be removed easily with a Flamethrower. Chansey will be unable to touch Moltres at all once it is locked into a single attack, and will be stalled out by Roost and Pressure. If you can keep Stealth Rock off the field, Moltres makes a good defensive complement to Slowbro, with the ability to come into both Venusaur's Leaf Storm and Scyther's Bug Bite with ease and pose an immediate threat. In return, Slowbro helps out against Azumarill, which can use a combination of Waterfall and Aqua Jet to break Moltres's Substitute and then subsequently take it out.</p>"

  "Magneton": {
    "overview": "<p>Because UU does not have the plethora of Steel-types that are found in OU, Magneton has a tough time proving its worth. But due to the prevalence of Registeel and Steelix in the UU environment, Magneton can fill a niche on teams that utilize hard-hitting Normal-, Dragon-, or Flying-type Pokemon by removing those Steel-type Pokemon from play with its ability, Magnet Pull. With a superb Special Attack stat, Magneton can also take the offensive by either boosting its Special Attack with Charge Beam or lowering the opponent's stats and forcing switches with Metal Sound. Magneton also has decent defenses as well as resistances to Dragon, Steel, Bug, Normal, Flying, Rock, Electric, and Ice, allowing it to form sturdy Substitutes and switch in against a wide variety of attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Discharge is another option for an Electric attack that has the added bonus of paralyzing the opponent 30% of the time, as opposed to Thunderbolt's 10%, at the cost of 15 Base Power. Reflect and Light Screen bolster Magneton's decent defenses, allowing it to take many more attacks, while also supporting the entire team. Signal Beam can be used to hit Grass-types and Psychic-types for slightly more damage than Thunderbolt, but it does not have enough utility to take up an entire moveslot. Toxic could pair well with Substitute to cripple some of the special walls, such as Hypno, that do not have Natural Cure or a status recovery move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Chansey is the best counter to any Magneton set that does not have Explosion due to its sky-high Special Defense and HP and access to Soft-Boiled or Wish. Claydol does a good job against sets lacking Magnet Rise and takes little damage from Magneton's super effective Hidden Powers. Camerupt is immune to Thunderbolt, resists Flash Cannon and Hidden Power Fire, and takes neutral damage from Hidden Power Ice and Hidden Power Grass. It can also get around Magnet Rise by hitting Magneton with STAB Fire-type attacks. However, due to Camerupt's low defenses and HP, it must focus heavily on HP and Special Defense.</p> <p>Bulky Grass-types with access to recovery such as Shaymin, Venusaur, and Meganium do a great job against Magneton due to their resistance to Thunderbolt. None of these Pokemon take excessive damage from super effective Hidden Powers due to their good Special Defense stats. Shaymin and Venusaur can KO Magneton with Earth Power and Earthquake respectively. Although Earthquake is rare on Meganium sets, it has that option and can also set up Light Screen to lessen the impact of Magneton's attacks even further.</p> <p>Gastrodon and Quagsire perform exceptionally well against Magneton due to their immunity to Thunderbolt, resistance to Flash Cannon and Hidden Power Fire, and neutrality to Hidden Power Ice. However, they must be wary of any Magneton carrying Hidden Power Grass. Both can hit Magneton with STAB Ground-type attacks or break its Substitutes with Water-type attacks if it has used Magnet Rise. They can then heal off any damage taken with Recover.</p> <p>Gardevoir can Trace Magneton's Magnet Pull and weather a few of Magneton's attacks due to its high Special Defense and access to Wish. Gardevoir can then dispose of Magneton with Focus Blast. Hard-hitting Fighting-types with good Special Defense, such as Hitmontop and Hitmonlee, can absorb one or two Thunderbolts and threaten Magneton with Close Combat or Mach Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Steel Killer (Substitute)": {
        "description": "<p>Like its OU brethren, Magnezone, Magneton's utility lies in its ability to trap and knock out Steel-types. Substitute blocks all forms of status while scouting the opponent's actions. Magneton's Substitutes are not broken by Registeel's Iron Head or Ice Punch or Steelix's Gyro Ball, Stone Edge, or Crunch; however, an Earthquake from either Registeel or Steelix will break the Substitute, due to Magneton's 4x weakness to Ground. With Magnet Rise, Magneton is able to hover safely above the range of normally fatal Ground-type attacks. Magnet Rise should be Magneton's first priority against Steelix in order to prevent Earthquake. At worst, Magneton will be Roared away. For this reason, it is a good idea to save Magneton until Steelix is in range to be KOed by Hidden Power Fire. It should also be mentioned that Substitute is Magneton's first priority when up against Registeel.</p> <p>Hidden Power Fire is used over Hidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Grass for its ability to successfully hit Steelix, one of the main targets of this set. Hidden Power Fighting or Hidden Power Ground could be used in place of Hidden Power Fire due to their ability to deal greater damage to Probopass and Bastiodon, while still hitting Steelix for super effective damage; but due to the type coverage that Hidden Power Fire offers when paired with Thunderbolt (compared to that offered by Hidden Power Fighting or Ground), it is considered the superior choice. Thunderbolt efficiently KOes Probopass and Bastiodon, so the power loss when using Hidden Power Fire is not a big issue. Hidden Power Ice is not listed as an option on this set due to the fact that there are no commonly used Dragon-types in UU that do not take neutral damage from Thunderbolt. Altaria is 2HKOed by Thunderbolt after Stealth Rock damage and UU Grass-types are hit equally hard by Hidden Power Fire as they would be by Hidden Power Ice (with the sole exception of Torterra).</p> <p>Leftovers is the optimal item choice due to its ability to restore HP, allowing Magneton to recover some of the damage sacrificed to create a Substitute. One issue that Magneton faces when switching in against Registeel is the possibility of Thunder Wave, a scenario that frequently presents itself when Magneton attempts to trap a Registeel that switched into a Mismagius or Venusaur. Lum Berry allows Magneton to shed its paralysis status, giving it the opportunity to set up a Substitute before any further status attempts can be launched. Lum Berry also gives Magneton the same opportunity against slower status-inducing foes such as defensive Venusaur with Sleep Powder.</p> <p>148 Speed EVs give Magneton a Speed stat of 212, allowing it to outspeed max Speed Adamant Torterra (a spread normally used by the popular Rock Polish Torterra variant). Magneton can then Magnet Rise before Torterra has the opportunity to Earthquake, meaning Torterra can only damage Magneton with resisted attacks: Stone Edge and Wood Hammer. After maximizing Magneton's Special Attack stat, the remaining EVs are dumped into HP in order to buff Magneton's durability.</p> <p>Magneton's main role is removing Steel-types so that other Pokemon, such as Flying- or Normal-types, have the opportunity to sweep. Mismagius pairs excellently with Magneton due to its immunity to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks; in turn, Magneton traps and removes Registeel. Hard-hitting Normal-type Pokemon, such as Ambipom and Tauros, also enjoy having Steelix and Registeel removed from play. Dragon Dance Altaria is a lesser seen Pokemon who benefits greatly after Magneton has done its job, allowing it to Outrage without the fear of retribution from Steelix or Registeel. In general, offensive Flying-type Pokemon pair nicely with Magneton due to the coverage of weaknesses and the increased possibility of an offensive sweep that Steel-type removal offers. Mismagius also benefits greatly from the removal of Registeel, one of its most sure-fire counters. Once Registeel is out of commission, Mismagius has a relatively easy time of setting up and sweeping the opposing team.</p> <p>Defensive Water-type Pokemon with decent HP and defenses, namely Milotic and Slowbro, do an excellent job of absorbing the various Fire-type attacks thrown at Magneton. Because both Pokemon have access to instant recovery, they can also take a few Ground- or Fighting-type attacks (Slowbro is especially well-equipped for the second) while recovering from the damage. Because Magneton lacks recovery, Gardevoir can be used to provide Wish support and take weaker Fighting-type attacks. But due to its low HP and Defense, the latter is not recommended. Other Wish options include Clefable and Chansey, but they both share a dangerous Fighting weakness with Magneton, diminishing the chances of successfully switching Magneton in to receive the Wish.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Unlike the Steel Trapper set, this set focuses Magneton's often overlooked base 120 Special Attack (the highest of any UU Electric-type). Offensive sets such as this should normally be left to faster, more immediately threatening special sweepers, such as Rotom and Manectric, but Magneton, due to its good defenses and numerous resistances, is able to set up much sturdier Substitutes than the two aforementioned Pokemon. Sturdier Substitutes mean that Magneton can set up against a wider variety of foes, such as Registeel (that lack Earthquake), Spiritomb, and Choice Scarf Venusaur locked into Energy Ball or Sludge Bomb. None of these Pokemon are able to break Magneton's Substitutes with attacks they commonly carry, allowing it to safely boost its stats without fear of immediate offensive assault.</p> <p>With Charge Beam, Magneton keeps its boosts until switching out or being phazed, so it retains more of an offensive presence. Charge Beam also has the benefit of doing damage to the opponent and benefiting from STAB. Metal Sound on the other hand has the ability to force switches, thus dealing Spikes and Stealth Rock damage to the opponent. Due to the somewhat defensive nature of Metal Sound, it is recommend that Magneton be used alongside residual damage support. Flash Cannon can be used in the last slot in order to hit Rock-types much harder, however it does not add much coverage-wise.</p> <p>As is the case with most Electric-type Pokemon, the choice of Hidden Power is a difficult one. Hidden Power Grass is the best choice due to its ability to hit Ground-types, especially Quagsire and Gastrodon, for super effective damage. Hidden Power Ice also performs similarly, but the main target of Hidden Power Ice is Altaria, which is easily taken care of with a boosted Thunderbolt. Another benefit of Hidden Power Ice is the ability to hit Grass-types, which resists both Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Grass, for super effective damage. The combination of Electric and Ice is only resisted by Lanturn, Shedinja, and other Magneton in the UU environment. Hidden Power Fire helps against Steelix and other Magneton while still hitting Grass-types for super effective damage.</p> <p>160 Speed EVs gives Magneton enough Speed to outrun Jolly Aggron. Max Special Attack is a given on such an offensive set. The remaining EVs are placed into HP. Life Orb can be used in place of Leftovers if power is preferred over durability, but Life Orb and Substitute recoil will catch up to Magneton before it is able to do sufficient damage to the opponent's team. If Magneton is using Life Orb, it would be a good idea to forgo the use of Substitute for Explosion and use a Naive nature. The HP EVs would also need to be placed into Attack. With Explosion, Magneton is able to take out some of its counters at the expense of KOing itself. However, this could open the way for a sweep by another Pokemon such as Mismagius.</p> <p>If one of Magneton's teammates is able to Trick a choice item onto the opposing Steel-type, it will make it much easier for Magneton to switch in and set up for the kill. Locking Steelix or Registeel into Stealth Rock will completely incapacitate them once Magneton is brought into play.</p> <p>Like most special-based Pokemon in UU, Magneton has trouble taking on Chansey. For that reason, Magneton should be paired with a Pokemon that can take it out, such as Hariyama, Torterra, or strong Pursuit users. Rest + Sleep Talk Hariyama is the best choice for the job due to the fact that it does not particularly care about status. It can simply Rest away any attempts by Chansey to Toxic or Thunder Wave it. Hariyama also resists both Flamethrower and Ice Beam due to its ability, Thick Fat. With gargantuan HP, Hariyama also doesn't mind Seismic Toss. Hariyama can then retaliate with STAB Fighting-type attacks to scare away Chansey. Torterra is able to switch in against Seismic Toss and Thunder Wave and threaten Chansey with STAB Earthquake. Yache Berry Torterra stands the best chance against Chansey (no pun intended), due to the possibility of Ice Beam. Strong Pursuit users, such as Drapion, Absol, and Scyther can also weaken Chansey to the point that Magneton would be able to finish it off later.</p> <p>Magneton also has issues against Claydol and Camerupt, however rare the latter may be in UU. Like with Chansey, Magneton can be paired with strong Pursuit users in order to remove Claydol from play. However, the better option may be to pair Magneton with a bulky Water-type, such as Slowbro, Milotic, or Azumarill. All three of these Pokemon can withstand any of the attacks that Claydol and Camerupt can launch (except possibly Explosion), and launch super effective Water attacks of their own. Azumarill is particularly a good choice due to its access to Encore, which would allow Magneton to more easily set up against the opponent.</p> <p>Mismagius pairs well offensively with Magneton due to its ability to dispose of the threats listed above, namely Chansey and Claydol, and the fact that it covers Magneton's weaknesses. After Mismagius has weakened the opponent's special walls, Magneton can more easily sweep.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Although the Electric-type Choice set is better left to faster options such as Manectric and Electabuzz, Magneton performs decently in this department due to its access to Explosion. With Explosion, Magneton can suddenly OHKO its main counter, Chansey; something that Manectric has no hope of doing. With 56 Attack EVs, Magneton always OHKOes 252 Def Calm Chansey with Explosion as long as it has taken Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Magneton has much less utility in the UU environment than does Magnezone in the OU environment. However, it can still perform adequately by KOing hard-hitting Flying-types. With Choice Scarf, Magneton outspeeds standard Dragon Dance Altaria after a single Dragon Dance and can switch in against Outrage or Dragon Claw with impunity. Magneton can then OHKO Altaria with Hidden Power Ice, assuming it has taken prior damage from Stealth Rock. Magneton also does a fantastic job of countering Swellow. If Magneton switches in against Facade or Protect, Swellow will normally stay in hoping to U-turn out, but Magneton will outspeed and OHKO with Thunderbolt before Swellow has the chance.</p> <p>As previously mentioned, Magneton can use Hidden Power Ice to KO Altaria, making it the best bet for a Hidden Power. Hidden Power Grass can be used to severely dent Gastrodon and KO Quagsire. Hidden Power Fire can finish off weakened Steelix; however, outside of that, it has little utility. Flash Cannon has decent neutral-type coverage and should be used when Magneton predicts a Grass-type or Ground-type (not Gastrodon or Quagsire!) will switch in to absorb Thunderbolt.</p> <p>56 Attack EVs allow Magneton to OHKO Calm 252 Def Chansey with Explosion, assuming it has taken prior damage from Stealth Rock. 228 Spe EVs, a positive nature, and Choice Scarf give Magneton a Speed stat of 384, allowing it to outspeed +1 Altaria as well as Swellow. Of course, Special Attack is maximized.</p> <p>Due to the fact that Magneton will be locked into an attack after KOing the foe, it is a good idea to pair Magneton with a somewhat defensive Pokemon who can absorb attacks from the Grass-, Ground-, and Electric-type Pokemon who will switch in against it. Shaymin is the best candidate with its 100 / 100 / 100 defenses and resistances to the aforementioned types. Shaymin can also recover away any damage with Leech Seed or Synthesis. Shaymin easily tackles opponents such as Quagsire and Gastrodon that give Magneton trouble. Like the other sets, Water-types, such as Milotic, Slowbro, and Azumarill, pair well with Magneton due to their ability to take hits and remove opposing Ground-types.</p> <p>Swellow and Dragon Dance Altaria create great synergy with Magneton by covering each others' weaknesses. Swellow and Altaria also do a fantastic job of knocking out the special walls that stand in Magneton's way, such as Chansey and Hypno.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>With the abundance of bulky Water-types and other Electric-weak Pokemon in the UU tier, Electric is one of the best STABs to have. Magneton boasts the highest Special Attack stat out of all the Electric-types available in UU, and this set takes full advantage of that by utilizing Choice Specs. With the boost from Choice Specs, Magneton reaches a monstrous 556 Special Attack (factoring in the imperfect IVs from Hidden Power), which allows it to leave gaping holes in the opponent's team. While Magneton's defenses are nothing to write home about and its Speed is subpar, it can still switch in multiple times during a match to dish out hefty blows by relying on its 13 resistances. Thunderbolt is Magneton's main STAB attack and will badly hurt any Pokemon that does not resist it. Flash Cannon is Magneton's secondary STAB move and hurts most Pokemon that resist or are immune to Thunderbolt. While Hidden Power Grass has better coverage alongside Magneton's STAB attacks, Hidden Power Water is preferred since it allows Magneton to take full advantage of its ability, Magnet Pull, by allowing it to severely dent Steelix. However, Hidden Power Grass is still a great option if one is wary about trapping Steelix, as it OHKOes Quagsire and Gastrodon while 2HKOing Lanturn. Explosion rounds out the set by giving Magneton a means to OHKO Chansey after Stealth Rock damage. If one doesn't like blowing Magneton up, Signal Beam can be used over Explosion in order to hit Grass-types like Tangrowth and Leafeon for super effective damage.</p> <p>Below are some calculations to show how powerful Magneton's attacks are against some common threats.</p> <ul> <li>Thunderbolt vs 252 HP / 252 SpD Careful Registeel: 35.71% - 42.31%</li> <li>Thunderbolt vs 4 HP / 0 SpD Venusaur: 39.74% - 47.02%</li> <li>Thunderbolt vs 252 HP / 252 SpD Calm Clefable: 47.21% - 55.58%</li> <li>Thunderbolt vs 252 HP / 216 SpD Careful Altaria: 48.59% - 57.63%</li> <li>Flash Cannon vs 4 HP / 0 SpD Venusaur: 67.55% - 79.47%</li> <li>Flash Cannon vs 252 HP / 252 SpD Careful Torterra - 41.12% - 48.73%</li> <li>Hidden Power Water vs 252 HP / 252 SpD Sassy Steelix: 63.28% - 74.58%</li> <li>Hidden Power Grass vs 40 HP / 252 SpD Careful Lanturn: 50.87% - 59.85%</li> <li>Explosion vs 4 HP / 252 Def Chansey: 93.46% - 100%</li> </ul> <p>The given EVs allow Magneton to outspeed, trap, and OHKO Jolly Aggron. Max Special Attack and a Rash nature allow Magneton to hit as hard as possible, and the remaining EVs go into Attack to power up Explosion. Should one pick Signal Beam instead of Explosion in the last slot, a Modest nature is preferred and the Attack EVs should be distributed into HP so Magneton's average bulk is not compromised. Thunder is another daring option over Explosion. While the 70% accuracy is a huge turnoff, its power allows Magneton to 2HKO Registeel with a layer of Spikes most of the time, while utterly maiming almost all switch-ins. If one is using Magneton on a Rain Dance team, Thunder becomes much more appealing, due to its perfect accuracy in rain, and could even be used over Thunderbolt.</p> <p>It should be noted that while it may be extremely tempting to bring Magneton out and start spamming Thunderbolt from the get-go, one must avoid this temptation, because although Thunderbolt is a fantastic STAB move, it does have its disadvantages. Dangerous Ground-types such as Rhyperior, Torterra, and especially Dugtrio are all itching to switch into Thunderbolt, and can use the free turn Thunderbolt gives them to set up, or, in Dugtrio's case, completely remove Magneton from the field. Due to this, it is usually better for Magneton to start off by scouting with either Flash Cannon or Hidden Power to catch Ground-types or Electric-resistant Pokemon first, only using Thunderbolt later in the match after the opponent's team has been properly scouted.</p> <p>Chansey can switch into any attack Magneton can dish out apart from Explosion and heal itself with Wish or Soft-Boiled. Due to this, strong Fighting-type teammates such as Hitmonlee and Hariyama are recommended, since they can easily scare off Chansey. Dugtrio can also be employed to trap and take out Chansey without too much trouble. Specially Defensive Torterra, when at full health, is also a good check to Magneton, as it is immune to Thunderbolt, isn't 2HKOed by Flash Cannon, and can OHKO back with Earthquake. Swords Dance Leafeon is a good partner to Magneton due to this reason, as it is able to set up on Torterra and proceed to sweep. In exchange, Magneton can trap and severely weaken Registeel beyond repair for Leafeon. After two Thunderbolts, Registeel will be too weak to stand up to Swords Dance Leafeon's assaults. Nasty Plot Mismagius is another Pokemon that can take advantage of a weakened Registeel. Magneton can also weaken Steelix with Hidden Power Water, so Pokemon that can sweep when Steelix is weakened are also good partners for Magneton. With Steelix gone, Swords Dance Scyther, Swellow, Choice Band Kangaskhan and other physical Normal- and Flying-types can sweep teams with a lot less effort. Altaria is possibly Magneton's best teammate, synergizing extremely well with it; in fact, the pair resists every type in the game. With opposing Steel-types weakened or removed, Altaria can fearlessly devastate an opposing team with its Dragon Dance-boosted Outrages. Magneton also easily scares away Milotic (although do not switch into any of Milotic's STAB attacks, as they will greatly damage Magneton), which is helpful because Milotic can severely damage Altaria with Ice Beam or remove its boosts with Haze. Other UU Dragon-types such as Shelgon and Dragonair achieve similar results.</p>"

  "Dewgong": {
    "overview": "<p>Dewgong has never been a common sight in the UU metagame. It's severely outclassed by its cousin Walrein, in terms of both overall stats and ability. Dewgong's defensive stats should by no means be dismissed, however, and its unique ability, Hydration, distinguishes it from its Water- and Ice-type brethren. Dewgong's part Ice typing is quite a mixed blessing. STAB Ice-type moves are always welcome on any team, hitting many common Pokemon super effectively. Defensively, however, Dewgong's Ice typing does it no favors. Stealth Rock hinders Dewgong's ability to tank, as taking 25% damage each time it switches in will wear it down very quickly. Even with these drawbacks taken into consideration, Dewgong can still act as a decent tank in UU play, with handy resistances to the omnipresent Ice- and Water-type attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dewgong can also use a physically based set with Waterfall and Avalanche instead of Surf and Ice Beam; if you decide to use this set, the EVs and nature should be changed accordingly. Ice Shard and Aqua Jet both get STAB, but still do a pitiful amount of damage, even against Pokemon that are weak to them. Blizzard is a viable option if you are using Dewgong in a hail based team, as the additional Base Power is greatly welcomed. Signal Beam is the only other attacking option available for Dewgong besides Hidden Power, but is redundant because Ice Beam offers pretty much the same type coverage while hitting Dark- and Psychic-types almost as hard thanks to STAB. Dewgong can try phazing with Perish Song, but this is usually better left to more defensive Pokemon like Lapras. An interesting alternative is Encore, which can force switches or create openings for fellow sweepers, allowing them to set up on an opposing Pokemon that is locked into a nonthreatening move. Thick Fat can replace Hydration outside of rain, but in that case you may as well use a better Water-type like Milotic or Blastoise over Dewgong.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>With its poor offensive stats, Dewgong doesn't pose much of threat to most of the metagame. Bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Milotic and Blastoise have nothing to fear outside of Toxic against non-Rest variants. Clefable is immune to status and boasts great Special Defense, making it an ideal counter; it is able to inflict status on, set up on, or Encore Dewgong. Poliwrath can easily switch in on any move not named Toxic, set up a Substitute, and proceed to pummel Dewgong with STAB Focus Punch. Bulky Pokemon in general that are either immune to Toxic or can remove status afflictions can easily set up on Dewgong. Keeping Stealth Rock consistently up will limit how freely Dewgong can switch in and out, hindering its performance.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rain Dance": {
        "description": "<p>This set is based around utilizing Dewgong's ability, Hydration. After Rain Dance is set up, Rest becomes a means of recovery that is both instantaneous and reliable. STAB Surf in the rain will hit any Pokemon that does not resist it for significant damage. Ice Beam is Dewgong's secondary STAB move, which, when paired with Surf, provides excellent all-around coverage. Toxic is a useful option to consider, depending on the rest of your team; it can cripple bulky walls such as Milotic and Chansey, forcing them to either switch out or die, which can be an effective way to rack up damage if entry hazards are present.</p> <p>96 Speed EVs guarantee that Dewgong will outspeed notable threats such as max Speed Aggron and Rock Polish Torterra before the boost. 252 HP EVs give Dewgong as much bulk as possible, while the remaining EVs are dumped into Special Attack to give Dewgong some much needed offensive firepower. Unfortunately, since there aren't any Pokemon in the UU metagame that can set up permanent rain, Dewgong is left to perform that task for itself. Damp Rock should always be Dewgong's primary item choice, as it grants three very much appreciated additional turns of rain. However, if you have other Pokemon to set up rain on the team, then Leftovers is a good alternative.</p> <p>Since Dewgong is doubling as a tank and Rain Dance supporting Pokemon, the best teammates are those that can really put the rain to use. Thanks to Dewgong's bulk, it can take a hit or two, set up rain, and let teammates such as Kabutops and Ludicolo wreak havoc. Other teammates to consider are those with weaknesses to Fire-type attacks that appreciate the rain to reduce that damage, such as Venusaur and Leafeon. Because of Dewgong's Ice typing, it picks up weaknesses to Rock- and Fighting-type attacks that teammates will have to address. Donphan makes a great partner because it can take Rock- and Electric-type attacks with ease, and it has massive physical bulk to take a few hits from powerful Fighting-type Pokemon if absolutely necessary. For what it's worth, Donphan can also set up Stealth Rock for Dewgong's team. Uxie also makes a good partner because it can set up Stealth Rock, like Donphan, and because it threatens Fighting-type Pokemon with STAB Psychic and can cripple other things with Thunder Wave.</p>"

  "Muk": {
    "overview": "<p>Muk has probably one of the worst cases of four moveslot syndrome in history. His Poison typing and STAB are rather pitiful; Steel-, Rock-, and Ground-type Pokemon are extremely common in UU and none of them mind it. This means Muk must rely on his big movepool to hurt switch-ins, but the limit of three leftover moveslots hinders him greatly. Explosion is also such a tempting move that it sometimes leaves Muk with only two moves to make up for his bad STAB. His movepool problems aside, Muk is an excellent special tank who can take attacks from the likes of specially oriented Venusaur and Lanturn. Muk's awesome 105 base Attack should not be ignored either, as it allows him to tear massive holes in foes that don't resist his powerful Gunk Shots. Muk may seem lackluster, but he can effectively fill in a variety of roles for your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Besides Ice Punch, Muk also has access to Thunder Punch and Fire Punch. Thunder Punch can strike down Qwilfish, Moltres, and Scyther, while Fire Punch can roast Venusaur, Heracross, and Torterra. Memento is an extremely unorthodox move that Muk can employ in some very circumstantial cases to set up your next Pokemon, but this role is usually better done by faster Pokemon that can also set up dual screens (e.g. Uxie). Mean Look can force something to stay on the battlefield so Muk can Explode on them. Muk can also perform Haze, but Weezing usually does a better job at doing that thanks to his higher Defense stat and immunity to Earthquake. Taunt is decent since it stops Pokemon from setting up and forces Ghosts to attack so Muk can hit them with Payback while also preventing them from burning Muk. However, Muk is usually too slow to utilize Taunt effectively. Screech can force a switch, which sometimes allows Muk to fire off a free Focus Punch.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Muk has a plethora of counters in UU. As mentioned in every set, Muk has a difficult time dealing with most bulky Steel-, Rock-, and Ground-types, which are all very common defensive types in UU. Steelix and Registeel in particular can prevent Muk from doing anything because of their titanic Defense stats. Muk's only way of damaging them is a boosted Focus Punch, but it is unreliable. Nidoking, Claydol, and Nidoqueen are also troublesome to Muk because they resist Muk's STAB and Fighting-type moves. Furthermore, all three have a considerable amount of bulk to take an Ice Punch, outpace Muk, and dispose of him with their STAB Earthquake. Drapion is also another forgotten threat who can set up Swords Dance and scare away Muk with Earthquake.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Curse": {
        "description": "<p>Muk makes a fantastic Curse user in UU due to his superb special bulk and naturally high Attack stat. Unlike other Curse users, Muk is not susceptible to Trick thanks to his ability, Sticky Hold. This allows Muk to set up Curses on common Trick users, such as Clefable and Rotom, with little fear. Poison Jab is Muk's obligatory STAB move, while the third slot gives him better coverage. Brick Break allows him to damage Steel- and Rock-types such as Steelix, Registeel, and Aggron, which usually carry Earthquake to wreck Muk's set-up. Ice Punch allows Muk to hit Ground-types which normally switch in on it, such as Nidoking, Nidoqueen, and Claydol. For the last slot, Explosion is a powerful move that lets Muk takes out at least one last Pokemon, while Shadow Sneak allows him to hit faster Pokemon such as Espeon and Alakazam, which can threaten him with a STAB Psychic attack. Rest is another option if Muk has a couple of Curses under his belt since it allows him to replenish lost health and cure status. Gunk Shot is another option on this set for a stronger STAB attack, but it is not recommended because of its low PP and accuracy.</p> <p>The EVs are designed to give Muk the best balanced bulk possible with a little more emphasis on Special Defense, as Muk can simply raise his Defense with Curse. 80 Defense EVs ensure that Muk is never KOed by Hitmonlee's or Aggron's Earthquake. However, these EVs can easily be moved to either Special Defense, which gives Muk the best special bulk possible, or Attack, which gives Muk a little more power.</p> <p>While combining Rest with Sleep Talk may seem tempting, leaving Muk with only one type of attack is a horrible idea. Muk's Poison STAB has bad coverage in UU, and his biggest counters, Registeel and Steelix, are completely immune to it. Furthermore, leaving Muk with only Brick Break or Ice Punch would leave him utterly outclassed by a multitude of Pokemon in UU.</p> <p>This set has a hard time dealing with Registeel and Steelix due to their titanic Defense stat that allows them to take repeated Brick Breaks from Muk. Steelix can use Roar to prevent Muk from even setting up Curse, and both Steelix and Registeel can deal plenty of damage to Muk with Earthquake. Hariyama makes an excellent teammate for Muk due to his incredible base HP, which allows him to take repeated Earthquakes from Steelix and Registeel and threaten them back with STAB Fighting-type attacks. Pairing Muk alongside Milotic or Quagsire can prove useful as well. They have exceptional bulk and can shrug off attacks from the various Ground-types of UU and then threaten them with Surf or Waterfall. Muk also appreciates dual screen support, which allows him to set up with less difficulty.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>With an impressive base 105 Attack and high defensive stats, Muk can effectively utilize a Choice Band set. STAB Gunk Shot can deal a considerable amount of damage to Pokemon that do not resist it; however, Poison Jab is the safer option due to its higher accuracy. The selection between Brick Break and Focus Punch solely relies on your prediction skills. Focus Punch deals much more damage overall; for example, it deals 62.15% - 73.45% to Relaxed 252/0 Steelix, Muk's number one counter. Brick Break will fail to get a clean 2HKO on Steelix, but is a much more reliable option otherwise. Ice Punch deals with Grass- and Ground-types like Venusaur, Torterra, Nidoking, Donphan, and Claydol. In the last slot, Explosion is a powerful attack that literally OHKOes any UU Pokemon that does not resist it. Payback is another option in place of Ice Punch to hurt opposing Psychic-types, but Ice Punch is preferred, as it damages Ground-types who can hit Muk on his lower Defense stat with Earthquake.</p> <p>An alternative EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe can be utilized to outrun Pokemon such as RestTalk Milotic, Support Venusaur, and Blastoise. It also lets Muk Speed tie with opposing Aggron and Azumarill.</p> <p>This set may hit hard, but it is still stopped by Steel-types. Steelix and Registeel have to be careful about switching in on Focus Punch, but can otherwise easily come in on any of the other three attacks and scare away Muk with Earthquake. Nidoking and Nidoqueen can also come in on a predicted Poison- or Fighting-type attack and damage Muk with STAB Earthquake. As mentioned in the set above, Milotic can stop Muk's counters and drown them with Surf. For additional support, Spikes and Stealth Rock can help weaken Steelix and Registeel switch-ins. Good teammates to set up the aforementioned entry hazards include Omastar, Qwilfish, and Cloyster. Finally, Muk is easily revenge killed by Psychic-types such as Alakazam, so pairing Muk with a Pursuit user such as Spiritomb can greatly aid in Muk's hole-punching.</p>"
      },
      "SubPunch": {
        "description": "<p>With Substitute, Muk can utilize the jaw-breaking Focus Punch to more easily smash through opposing Steel- and Rock-types. This set is quite simple to use: set up a Substitute on a Pokemon whom Muk will scare out, and then use Focus Punch if it can hit super effectively. Poison Jab is the preferred STAB attack and is Muk's most consistent form of dealing damage; however, Gunk Shot offers more power and Muk has extra time to fire it off from behind a Substitute. Ice Punch covers Grass- and Ground-types like Venusaur, Nidoking, and Donphan who resist Fighting and/or Poison. Since Muk can only achieve a 3HKO at best on these Pokemon, you may prefer Payback to maim Ghost- and Psychic-types instead. As always, Explosion is an option in the last slot to allow Muk to go out with a bang.</p> <p>The somewhat arbitrary-looking EVs allow Muk to create 101 HP Substitutes and give Muk as much Attack as possible. With 8 EVs placed in Speed, Muk can outpace opposing minimum base 50s and set up a Substitute before they can status him. The remaining EVs are placed in Muk's lower Defense stat to protect him from the multitude of physical attacks found in UU.</p> <p>As with the aforementioned sets, Steelix is a menace to Muk even when he is behind a Substitute. Steelix is only 3HKOed by Focus Punch, and in the meantime, can easily use Roar to blow Muk away or damage him with Earthquake. Again, Milotic is a good partner, able to shrug off Earthquakes and soak Steelix and other Ground-types with Surf. Because Muk will be losing a significant amount of health from using Substitute, pairing him with a Wish user, such as Clefable or Leafeon, could prove useful. Pairing Muk with a Flying-type, such as Altaria or Moltres, allows him to easily avoid incoming Earthquakes and gives his Flying friends a free turn to do as they please. Grass-types such as Exeggutor and Tangrowth are good teammates as well since they resist Earthquake and can deal with the bulky Water-types Muk has trouble getting past with this set.</p>"
      },
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<p>This set plays a little more differently than the sets above. Its aim is to handle special attacks directed at Muk while dishing out attacks with his impressive base 105 Attack. Poison Jab is the preferred move for better accuracy, while Gunk Shot provides extra power but less accuracy. Unlike the previous sets, this one does not mind the PP drop from choosing Gunk Shot. Brick Break and Focus Punch are a must to damage opposing Rock- and Steel-types who would otherwise wall Muk completely. Ice Punch is useful against opposing Ground-types and Venusaur who attempt to come in on a Poison- or Fighting-type attack. Payback is another option for hitting opposing Psychic-types who could be problematic for Muk. Pain Split is the main option for decent recovery; it can also help do significant damage to Pokemon such as Registeel if Muk is at low health and they are at high health. Explosion is another option for this set as a last ditch effort to take out an opposing bulky Pokemon, such as Hariyama or Azumarill. Giga Drain can surprise and eliminate Rhyperior, Omastar, and Kabutops on the switch, but those are the only significant targets in UU. If you decide to use Giga Drain, then a Brave nature is recommended to maximize Giga Drain's power by not lowering Muk's Special Attack. Shadow Sneak is another option on this set to cover speedy Psychic-types, but it is far too weak without a Curse boost. Fire Blast can also be used to hit Steelix on its weaker Special Defense stat, but that is the extent of its use.</p> <p>Muk will have a harder time dealing with Steel-types like Registeel and Steelix without any form of a boost. Both Registeel and Steelix can shrug off Brick Break, and Focus Punch will still fail to deal any significant damage. Defensive Hariyama can be a neat partner with Muk as it can take repeated Earthquakes while dishing out incredible damage with his STAB Fighting-type move. Moltres is another potential teammate for this set because it can come in on Earthquake and attempt to scare Steel-types away with a Fire-type move. Muk will also attract Psychic-types, and the perfect choice to take Psychic-type attacks is Spiritomb. Spiritomb can utilize Pursuit on fleeing Psychic-types or set up using Calm Mind to handle bulkier Psychic-types such as Uxie and Mesprit.</p>"

  "Cloyster": {
    "overview": "<p>Cloyster is one of the most unique Water-types in the UU metagame due to its secondary Ice typing and large movepool. It is the only Pokemon in the UU metagame to carry all of Spikes, Toxic Spikes, Rapid Spin, and Explosion. These great support moves are backed up by an excellent Defense stat, although its HP and Special Defense are quite pathetic in comparison. While its Ice typing sets Cloyster apart from other Water-types in the metagame, it is often more hurtful than helpful defensively. It gives it two more weaknesses, including one to Stealth Rock, and causes it to lose many resistances that a pure Water-type would otherwise boast. Offensively, Cloyster's STAB Ice Shard is quite useful for taking out faster, frailer Pokemon. Cloyster's decent offensive stats ensure that many Pokemon will have trouble trying to switch into his Surfs and Rock Blasts, especially frail Ghost-types trying to block Rapid Spin.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cloyster can run a decent Choice Band set due to its usable Attack stat, but it is much better off being able to switch between attacks, as it loses a lot of its versatility otherwise.</p> <p>Cloyster also makes a decent wallbreaker with Surf, Rock Blast, Hidden Power Grass, and Ice Beam or Explosion. This will hit Pokemon such as Steelix and Donphan hard while also nailing Chansey and Clefable. However, wallbreaking is better left to Pokemon such as Blaziken and Magmortar because they have much higher offensive stats and better type coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Cloyster is easily countered by defensively oriented Pokemon such as Milotic and Slowbro. However, any Pokemon switching into Cloyster should be wary of Explosion. Otherwise, it depends on Cloyster's attacking moves. Without Rock Blast, Pokemon such as Chansey and Clefable have an easy time switching in. If Cloyster lacks Surf, Rhyperior and Donphan can switch in. Hitmontop works as a counter to Cloyster as well because of its decent bulk and access to STAB Fighting-type attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to stop the opponent from setting up while also setting up Spikes of its own. Rock Blast is Cloyster's most powerful attack bar Explosion and will do a lot of damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Ice Shard is there to finish off Pokemon that use a Focus Sash while also enabling Cloyster to function as an excellent check to various sweepers like Swords Dance Venusaur and Dragon Dance Altaria. Rapid Spin can be used over Explosion to get rid of the various entry hazards that have been set up on your side of the field. This means that Cloyster can set up its own Spikes and simultaneously spin the opponent's entry hazards away.</p> <p>The EVs are specialized for the lead position because they are tailored to beat most of the common leads. The 160 HP and 96 Special Defense EVs allow Cloyster to survive Timid Alakazam's Psychic when it is not holding Choice Specs or Life Orb, and maximum Attack allows Cloyster to do major damage with Ice Shard, Rock Blast, and Explosion.</p> <p>Cloyster has a lot of trouble against Moltres leads because of its weaker Special Defense stat. Milotic, Azumarill, and Slowking provide nice switch-ins to Moltres and other Fire-types that threaten Cloyster; Slowking can also take Fighting-type attacks aimed at Cloyster. Hitmontop also works amazingly well with Cloyster, resisting the Rock-type attacks aimed at it while also being able to spin Stealth Rock off of the field, giving Cloyster more opportunities to switch in. Venusaur, Altaria, Moltres, and other Pokemon that resist Grass-type attacks all make great partners, as they can switch into the Grass-type attacks aimed at Cloyster.</p> <p>Moltres is one of the most powerful Pokemon when backed up with Spikes, making it a great teammate for Cloyster. Pokemon such as Swellow will appreciate the Explosion support that Cloyster gives, it he can greatly damage the physical walls Swellow has a hard time with.</p>"
      },
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Cloyster is a great support Pokemon in UU and is a decent candidate for any team in need of Spikes or Rapid Spin support. Cloyster's main job is to set up Spikes, but it fulfills many other roles as well, unlike Omastar, which is slightly bulkier but nowhere near as versatile. In addition, Cloyster functions as a great Rapid Spin user because it can nail Ghost-types with a reliable attack, unlike Donphan or Hitmontop, which rely on Assurance and Foresight, respectively. Cloyster also has the ability to take a lot of physical punishment, but Slowbro's better typing means that Cloyster is generally outclassed in this role because Slowbro takes physical hits such as Choice Band Waterfall from Azumarill better than Cloyster. If your team has trouble with Pokemon such as Slowbro and Azumarill, Toxic Spikes works well over Explosion.</p> <p>The advantages of Surf include hitting physically defensive Rotom and Spiritomb for decent damage, but Rock Blast will allow you to deal with Substitute users such as Alakazam and Mismagius more effectively, due to their lower Defense stat.</p> <p>Although Cloyster has an already amazing Defense stat, giving it an Impish nature is still recommended to take physical attacks better. However, with a Careful nature, Cloyster can set up Spikes more easily against Pokemon such as Milotic without Hidden Power Electric or Grass and Slowbro.</p> <p>Pokemon that can set up a sweep for themselves, such as Swellow, Mismagius, and Moltres, will definitely appreciate the Spikes support provided by Cloyster. This is because a loss of 25% in health upon switching in means that Registeel can no longer effectively wall Mismagius, and Pokemon such as Blastoise can no longer effectively wall Swellow. The best partner for Cloyster is Spiritomb because it can take Fighting-type attacks aimed at Cloyster and, more importantly, block Rapid Spin. Mismagius and Rotom work fine as well, but they lack Spiritomb's bulk. Hitmontop is quite helpful for Cloyster as well, taking the Rock-type attacks aimed at Cloyster and getting rid of Stealth Rock, which is very detrimental to Cloyster because of its Rock-type weakness. Hitmontop can also revenge kill Belly Drum Poliwrath, which can set up on Cloyster quite easily.</p> <p>Since Cloyster has a Stealth Rock weakness, it will appreciate any Pokemon that use Taunt to prevent the opponent from setting up early-game, as well as Pokemon that can take out Ghost-types so that Cloyster can spin away Stealth Rock. Cloyster also appreciates Wish support, as it has no reliable recovery move, and Stealth Rock damage can build up quickly. Hypno and Espeon are great candidates for Wish passing, because they lure out physical attackers for Cloyster to switch into. Gardevoir is also a good bet, because its resistance to Fighting-type attacks decreases the chance of Cloyster taking a Fighting-type attack as it switches in.</p>"

  "Haunter": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite being largely outclassed by Mismagius, access to toys that Mismagius lacks makes Haunter a solid addition to any UU team. Hypnosis and Explosion are important moves in Haunter's repertoire that Mismagius would love to learn, but what sets Haunter apart from Mismagius is his higher Special Attack stat and good secondary STAB in the form of Sludge Bomb. However, one must not forget Haunter's downsides. His defenses makes Sharpedo look bulky, and his Speed is good but often not good enough. Do not play Haunter like a down-sized Mismagius and he will be happy.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Haunter has plenty of special attacks in his arsenal. Energy Ball can be used to hit Lanturn. Icy Wind is an interesting option, as it allows Haunter to hit some faster switch-ins and lower their speed, allowing for a KO on the next turn. Different Hidden Power types such as Fire and Fighting can be used, but are generally not as effective as Hidden Power Ground. Haunter also has access to various support moves like Taunt, Will-O-Wisp, and Curse, but is much too frail to put them to good use.</p> <p>Haunter can also make decent use of Choice Specs or Choice Scarf, being able to cripple many of its switch-ins with Trick, but is generally too frail and cannot find time to switch in. Also, Mismagius tends to use Choice sets better.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Specially defensive Spiritomb, Registeel, Clefable, Drapion and Skuntank are by far the best counters available to combat Haunter, but all need to be wary of being put to sleep by Hypnosis. Registeel also needs to watch out for Substitute + Pain Split. If Toxic Spikes are not up, Chansey can Life Orb stall the Substitute + 3 Attacks set so long as Haunter is not carrying Explosion. Otherwise, Haunter is not very difficult to revenge kill. Should Haunter not have a Substitute up, Alakazam can outspeed and OHKO with Psychic. Swellow, Ambipom and Tauros can switch into any attack not named Sludge Bomb or Thunderbolt and OHKO with Pursuit, regardless of whether Haunter stays in or not. Mismagius can outspeed and OHKO with Shadow Ball so long as it avoids Haunter's Shadow Ball.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to make full use of Haunter's advantages over Mismagius. With a Life Orb attached, Haunter's Shadow Ball hits almost as hard as +1 Mismagius, making him very difficult to wall without resorting to Registeel. This set is relatively simple to use. Come in on a Pokemon that Haunter can force out and set up a Substitute. From there, proceed to smack the opponent with STAB attacks coming from a base 115 Special Attack. Sludge Bomb is a huge selling point for this set, since it allows Haunter to hit Normal-types that are immune to Shadow Ball, such as Miltank and Clefable, very hard. However, if one wishes to take a chance, Hypnosis is always a reasonable option to incapacitate a counter.</p> <p>The last move is the most variable. Hidden Power Ground is preferred since it allows Haunter to hit Drapion and Skuntank (two of Haunter's biggest counters) for super effective damage. It can also hit Registeel on the switch for more damage than any of its other moves. Thunderbolt is generally a good move, since it has good coverage alongside Shadow Ball and Sludge Bomb, while having the added bonus of being able to 2HKO Milotic and Blastoise. It also allows Haunter to revenge kill Moltres should the need arise. Finally, Explosion can be used to allow Haunter to go out with a bang and potentially remove a counter, thus allowing a teammate to sweep.</p> <p>Max Speed and Special attack is crucial; Haunter likes to outspeed or at worst tie with as many opponents as possible, because any attack will take a very big chunk out of Haunter's health, if not KO it outright. A Naive nature should be used should Haunter be running Explosion, as it allows him to OHKO Chansey after Stealth Rock, something that is not achieved with a Timid nature. Hasty is chosen over Naive to make the most of Haunter's resistances to Poison- and Grass-type attacks, which are predominantly special. While many priority attacks are physical, Haunter is either immune or weak to the vast majority, meaning a marginal difference in defense is inconsequential. Life Orb is used to give Haunter as much power as possible without locking him into a move.</p> <p>Life Orb Haunter is best used either early game to soften up counters for a teammate to sweep or late game to clean up when his own counters have been incapacitated. Like all offensively-minded Pokemon, he appreciates entry hazards, especially Spikes. With a layer or two of Spikes up, even Registeel will start to get whittled down quickly by Haunter's attacks. Of course, Stealth Rock is also helpful to wear down all opponents. Omastar is a great entry hazard user who can set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes, while allowing Haunter to switch into the Fighting- and Ground-type attacks that Omastar attracts. Cloyster is similar to Omastar, but he cannot set up Stealth Rock. Both can set up Toxic Spikes which can allow Haunter to stall out Chansey. Haunter can act as a temporary spinblocker if necessary due to his Ghost typing, but should one want an additional spinblocker, Spiritomb is probably the best choice to run alongside Haunter due to its lack of shared weaknesses with Haunter.</p> <p>Specially defensive Skuntank, Drapion and Spiritomb are some of the best counters to this set. Registeel also walls Haunter as long as he is at reasonable health. Specially defensive Clefable can also give Haunter troubles. Thus, it is best to pair Haunter up with Pokemon that can either trap or set up on these Pokemon. Dugtrio is an excellent partner to run alongside Haunter; it can trap and KO Drapion and Registeel without much problem at all, while using a combination of Substitute (to dodge Sucker Punch) and Earthquake to remove Skuntank. Houndoom can set up on Spiritomb while having decent synergy with Haunter, since Haunter can switch into Fighting- and Ground-type attacks aimed at Houndoom while Houndoom can shrug off Ghost-, Dark- and Psychic-type attacks aimed at Haunter. Bulky Swords Dance Drapion is also a good Pokemon to run alongside Haunter, since he can Taunt Spiritomb to avoid status and set up Swords Dance for a sweep. Hitmonlee and other powerful Fighting-types can easily dispatch Clefable.</p>"

      "SubSplit": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims for Haunter to sustain a longer sweep by using Pain Split. While Mismagius mostly does this better, Haunter still has some notable advantages over his Ghost-type relative. Haunter's higher base Special Attack makes him much harder to wall. Haunter's lower HP stat also allows him to heal more from Pain Split than Mismagius does. The idea of this set is Substitute on an opponent that cannot hurt Haunter. After this, proceed to bombard with your opponent with powerful attacks. When Haunter's health becomes low, use Pain Split and steal HP from the opponent. Shadow Ball is Haunter's bread-and-butter STAB move, and hits anything that does not resist it for a lot of damage. Hidden Power Ground is the preferred option for Haunter's coverage move, since it hits more of his counters like Drapion and Registeel for super effective damage. On the topic of Registeel, it has a much harder time defeating Pain Split Haunter, since Haunter can Substitute down to low health and Pain Split Registeel down to the Hidden Power Ground 2HKO range. Thunderbolt offers greater neutral coverage than Hidden Power Ground and is a better attack to KO Milotic and other bulky Water-types.</p> <p>The EVs are, again, very simple. Max Speed and a Timid nature allow Haunter to outspeed as many opponents as possible, while max Special Attack allows Haunter to hit as hard as possible.</p> <p>Pain Split Haunter should be paired with the same teammates that the Substitute + 3 Attacks set uses. Drapion, Skuntank and Registeel are best trapped and KOed by Dugtrio, while Spiritomb can be set up on by Houndoom and Drapion. Spikes and Stealth Rock will also help Haunter out greatly. Omastar can set up Stealth Rock and Spikes while providing Haunter oppotunities to switch in.</p>"

The former has high base Special Attack and Speed stats, making it a superior attacker, while the pixies have Stealth Rock and U-turn in their arsenal, distinguishing themselves as better supporters. However, Hypno has some qualities that its competition lacks: Wish, Baton Pass, and Insomnia. Wish allows Hypno to be a great team supporter, while Baton Pass makes Hypno a deadly boost passer. Insomnia rounds out Hypno's advantages, allowing it to switch into sleep-inducing moves for free. Combine these features with an excellent movepool and great defensive stats, and you'll find that Hypno is a good support Pokemon that's capable of holding a team together.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hypno has a myriad of options thanks to its large movepool. Hypno can run a dual screen set, despite being outclassed by Uxie and Mesprit. Hypno also has access to Belly Drum, allowing it to possibly threaten opposing teams on the physical side; however, Belly Drum is illegal with both Wish and Baton Pass, and Hypno's physical movepool is a bit lacking. A safer alternative to Belly Drum is Meditate, but Hypno needs a couple boosts to inflict decent damage with its physical movepool. On the Offensive Nasty Plot set, Hidden Power Fighting is an option over Psychic or Baton Pass. With access to Trick and equal base Attack and Special Attack, Hypno would appear to be able to run a Choice set, but its low offensive stats make it hard for Hypno to sweep. A status platform set is possible, as Hypno can learn Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Hypnosis, while possessing enough bulk to pull it off. Trick Room is yet another option due to Hypno's low Speed and above-average bulk. Hypno can also act as a supporter on a weather-based team, as it has access to both Sunny Day and Rain Dance. Counter can screw up opponents that target Hypno's lower Defense stat, while Taunt can prevent slower opponents from setting up. Barrier can compensate for Hypno's low Defense, Magic Coat can prevent status, and Skill Swap, alongside Insomnia, can ruin RestTalkers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Spiritomb is one of the best counters to Hypno, thanks to its immunity to Psychic and Seismic Toss, base 92 attacking stats, and access to STAB Pursuit and Dark Pulse. Registeel also takes little damage from all of Hypno's attacking moves, sets up Stealth Rock without trouble, and targets Hypno's lower Defense stat. Clefable can switch into the Support set easily thanks to Magic Guard, and can ruin Hypno's fun by Tricking it a Toxic Orb. Mismagius can Taunt Hypno and proceed to set up, while Absol threatens with STAB Pursuit and Night Slash. Finally, Rhyperior can switch into the Support set's Thunder Wave, set up Substitute, and proceed to sweep. However, Rhyperior does not like switching into the Offensive Nasty Plot set, as even an unboosted Grass Knot OHKOes it.</p>",

      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>With its great support movepool, it is almost impossible to not use Hypno in a supporting role. Hypno's great defensive stats, resistances to Psychic- and Fighting-type moves, and immunity to sleep allow it to switch in rather easily. Wish is Hypno's main way of supporting the team, restoring the HP of Hypno and its teammates. Seismic Toss inflicts reliable damage, while Thunder Wave paralyzes any non-Ground-type sweeper that attempts to set up on Hypno. Finally, Protect allows Hypno to scout out the opponent, as well as providing Hypno the opportunity to safely recover HP with Wish. Psychic can be used over Seismic Toss or Thunder Wave to deal with Fighting- and Poison-types, although it won't hit too hard due to the lack of EV investment and Hypno's low base Special Attack.</p> <p>The EVs and nature give Hypno enough bulk to deal with both physical and special attackers, while Leftovers adds to Hypno's longevity. Clefable makes a great partner for this set, as it can absorb incoming status thanks to Magic Guard and remove status with Heal Bell. Additionally, Clefable is immune to Ghost-type attacks, and lures in Fighting-types for Hypno to switch in on. However, Taunters such as Ambipom render this set useless, leaving Hypno with no choice but to switch out. Mismagius is the most dangerous Taunter because it is immune to Seismic Toss and can set up with Nasty Plot or Calm Mind on a predicted switch. Also, Rhyperior can switch into Thunder Wave, easily set up a Substitute if Hypno lacks Psychic, and proceed to severely damage your team.</p>"
      },
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>With access to boosting moves and Baton Pass, Hypno can try to set up a teammate for a sweep. The first slot is up to you, as some Pokemon do better with Nasty Plot boosts than Calm Mind boosts, and vice versa. Psychic is the obligatory attacking move, and can dent opposing Pokemon when Hypno has enough boosts. Baton Pass allows Hypno to accomplish its main goal of giving its boosts to a teammate. Substitute gives Hypno time to boost up and use Baton Pass, and can even be Baton Passed to further support the team. You might believe that Wish would work as an option over Substitute; sadly, Wish and Baton Pass are illegal together.</p> <p>Hypno's EV spread gives it enough bulk to successfully pass its boosts without getting KOed. A good partner for this Hypno is Houndoom, which can easily defeat Ghost-types that threaten Hypno. As an added bonus, Houndoom also appreciates being passed Nasty Plot or Calm Mind boosts. Lanturn and Mismagius also love Calm Mind boosts, and, if given enough boosts and the opportunity to do so, can sweep a team without much effort. However, this Hypno also has its fair share of counters. Spiritomb is immune to Psychic, threatens to KO Hypno with STAB Dark Pulse and Pursuit, and can use Will-O-Wisp on the switch-in. Absol also threatens Hypno with STAB Pursuit and Night Slash, while also being able to set up with Swords Dance on the switch.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>While Hypno's good defensive stats allow it to pass boosts effectively, it can also keep them for itself. With the right EV investment, Hypno can surprise many opponents that believe the boosts are destined for another Pokemon. Nasty Plot doubles Hypno's Special Attack, allowing it to quickly gear up for a sweep. Psychic is Hypno's main attacking move, gaining STAB on top of its decent Base Power. Grass Knot provides nice coverage alongside Psychic, hitting many of the Pokemon that commonly switch into Psychic for heavy damage. Baton Pass allows Hypno to escape quickly, while also giving its boosts to another teammate to sweep.</p> <p>Houndoom makes a great partner for Hypno, as it has the ability to deal with Ghost-types such as Mismagius and Rotom, while also luring in Fighting-types for Hypno to switch into. In return, Hypno can pass Nasty Plot boosts to Houndoom and 2HKO Milotic with +2 Grass Knot. Donphan is another good partner thanks to its high Defense stat, access to Stealth Rock, and ability to defeat Registeel. Also, Stealth Rock lures in opposing spinners, most of which are easily handled by Hypno after a Nasty Plot. Unfortunately, Spiritomb is still an issue, although it does not like switching into a +2 Grass Knot. Registeel resists both of Hypno's attacks, while being able to cripple Hypno with Thunder Wave or wear it down with Seismic Toss.</p>"

  "Kingler": {
    "overview": "<p>With outstanding offensive prowess, great physical bulk, coupled with access to moves such as Swords Dance and Agility, Kingler presents a formidable offensive threat to any unprepared team. The only problems truly hindering Kingler's effectiveness are its shallow movepool and mediocre special bulk, making it very vulnerable to any kind of special attack, which is especially significant. But with the appropriate support, Kingler can quite literally crush its way through an opposing team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Unfortunately, other than the mentioned sets, Kingler doesn't have many other options to choose from; although sets revolving around the sole usage of Swords Dance or Agility are perfectly viable, provided you give Kingler the needed support. A Substitute + Salac Berry set with Flail can also be utilized, but this is not recommended due to the prevalence of priority attacks in UU. In terms of other attacking options, Kingler can use Brick Break which will help when facing defensive Steel-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As mentioned several times before, bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Slowbro do a remarkable job at countering most Kingler variants, courtesy of their key resistances and natural bulk. Similarly, bulky Grass-types, particularly Leafeon and Tangrowth, also do a great job at checking and eliminating Kingler with their super effective STAB attacks. However, unlike Water-types, they must watch out for X-Scissor, which will inflict a massive amount of damage. Also, faster opponents, as well as priority attacks, will quickly eliminate Kingler, and if said attacks are specially based, Kingler is almost sure to faint due to its rather pitiful base Special Defense. Lastly, physically inclined walls can easily cripple Kingler with status, and then slowly whittle away its health.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Agility + Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>This set attempts to take advantage of Kingler's great offensive versatility, allowing it to perform excellently as either a wallbreaker or a sweeper depending on the situation, by using either Swords Dance or Agility. The former option, Swords Dance, lets Kingler take on the role of a wallbreaker, abusing its sky-high base 130 Attack stat to plow through unprepared teams, allowing a second sweeper to clean up after it. The latter option, Agility, transforms Kingler into a powerful sweeper, able to clean up with its powerful attacks after its teammates have provided sufficient support for Kingler to sweep. The remaining two moveslots are given to Crabhammer, which is a reliable STAB attack, and Return, which is mainly used for coverage reasons as it can fearsomely strike Pokemon that are resistant to Kingler's STAB.</p> <p>The EVs suggested are designed to reach a couple of key Speed stats; without an Agility boost, Kingler will outrun no-Speed Drapion and Jolly Torterra, while after an Agility boost, it will outrun Timid Choice Scarf Rotom and Moltres. It should be noted, though, that investing 252 EVs into Speed with a Jolly nature will allow Kingler to Speed tie with the fastest unboosted Absol, as well as being able to outspeed weather sweepers, such as Ludicolo and Victreebel, after an Agility. Both a Life Orb and an Adamant nature are recommended as they maximize Kingler's offensive capabilities. In terms of moves, X-Scissor can be used over Swords Dance or Agility to help take down threats such as Tangrowth and Leafeon; also, Double-Edge can be used over Return for a significant increase in power.</p> <p>The counters for this set depend on which boost you decide to take; if you choose to go for Agility, physically inclined walls and priority attacks can be problematic, whereas if you choose the Attack boost from Swords Dance, faster Pokemon with decent Special Attack will generally become threats to Kingler's sweep due to its mediocre Special Defense stat.</p>"
      },
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>Along with being a great set-up sweeper and wallbreaker, Kingler can also efficiently play the role of a devastating revenge killer; courtesy of its impressive offensive prowess and decent movepool, which allows it to dent even the most defensive of Pokemon. Crabhammer is a staple on the set as its acts as a reliable STAB attack, while Return and Rock Slide provide excellent coverage alongside Crabhammer and are generally great attacking options. The final move comes down to your personal preference: while Superpower helps against the likes of Registeel, X-Scissor can come in handy when facing Grass-types who think they can wall Kingler's STAB.</p> <p>The item to be used depends on what you want Kingler to accomplish: a Choice Band gives Kingler's attacks immense power, making Crabhammer powerful enough to occasionally KO even the most physically defensive Steelix after some residual damage, while a Choice Scarf allows it to outspeed Pokemon such as Swellow and Persian in order to swiftly dispatch them. The Speed EVs reach specific benchmarks, while the remaining EVs are invested into Attack and HP for maximum power and bulk. Since the given EVs were made specifically for the Choice Scarf set, a simple 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe spread can be used if you opt for a Choice Band. The recommended nature depends on which item you choose to use. Generally speaking, a Jolly nature is to be used with a Choice Band, while an Adamant nature is to be used with a Choice Scarf. However, in certain situations, this rule can be broken for the sake of extra utility. For example, although the power drop from using a Jolly nature is considerable, it is only with a Choice Scarf and a Jolly nature that Kingler can outrun positive natured base 120s such as Dugtrio, Sceptile, Alakazam, and Swellow, allowing Kingler to revenge kill them without worrying about being outpaced.</p> <p>If needed, you can use Double-Edge over Return, as the former move is significantly more powerful, but comes at the cost of recoil damage. Unlike the previous set, this one is countered much more easily as Kingler will now be locked into one move; bulky Grass- and Water-types such as Tangrowth, Leafeon, Milotic, and Slowbro are perfect checks due to their bulk and resistances, meaning they will be taking minimal damage from Kingler's attacks, although Grass-types and Slowbro must still beware of switching into X-Scissor.</p>"

  "Marowak": {
    "overview": "<p>Marowak sets a good example by wearing a skull as a helmet, because it is recommending other Pokemon to do the same when he's around--his attacking power is right up there with giants like Slaking and Medicham. Sadly, a Pokemon with such great Attack must have drawbacks. Marowak is unable to utilize Leftovers, has very lackluster HP and Special Defense, and is not the quickest Pokemon out there. However, with paralysis, Trick Room, or Baton Pass support, Marowak can be a real wrecking ball.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>In Trick Room, Marowak can invest more in Attack and HP, and also has room for another attacking move in place of Substitute; however, when Trick Room ends, Marowak is a sitting duck and can be easily OHKOed. He has access to a plethora of Fighting-type attacks, such as Focus Punch, Brick Break, and Low Kick, but they offer redundant coverage alongside Earthquake, and are rather inferior when compared to Double-Edge or Stone Edge. Bonemerang allows Marowak to break Substitutes, but most of the Pokemon who will be using Substitute against him aren't affected by Ground-type attacks. Marowak has access to Stealth Rock and Toxic, but he makes a much more effective attacker than a supporter.</p> <p>Marowak also has access to Belly Drum if you're crazy enough to try it. With a Belly Drum boost alongside Thick Club and an Adamant nature, Marowak reaches an almost unimaginable Attack stat of 2,272; however, even with a Salac Berry boost, he will usually find himself outpaced and KOed by faster enemies before he can even land a hit. Marowak also has access to a plethora of special options such as Fire Blast and Ice Beam, but his Special Attack stat is low, and the aforementioned moves have little use outside of hitting Torterra and Tangrowth for more damage than his other moves--and only if he invests fully in Special Attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Marowak is rather defenseless if he isn't behind a Substitute, so Pokemon who can outpace and OHKO him make great checks. However, most Pokemon will be hard-pressed to switch into any of Marowak's attacks. Pokemon such as Venusaur, Sceptile, and Feraligatr all have no problem outrunning and OHKOing a Substitute-less Marowak. Tangrowth, Torterra, and Claydol can all avoid a 2HKO from any of Marowak's attacks (although Tangrowth and Torterra must be wary of Fire Punch) and can break his Substitutes and proceed to KO him.</p> <p>If Marowak is in Trick Room, the best plan is to hit him with priority attacks. Azumarill can OHKO Marowak with Aqua Jet, while TechniTop can maim him with a combination of Fake Out and Mach Punch. Another strategy is to abuse Substitute and Protect as much as possible to burn Trick Room turns. Marowak also hates getting statused, especially burn, so Pokemon like Mismagius and Rotom can outrun Marowak and proceed to cripple him with Will-O-Wisp. However, neither can withstand getting hit by Fire Punch or Stone Edge, so this is a rather unreliable way of stopping Marowak, especially when both can easily 2HKO Marowak with Shadow Ball instead.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<p>With Thick Club doubling Marowak's Attack stat, the only thing stopping him from absolutely destroying the competition is his poor Speed and low defenses. In order to wreak havoc on the other team, Marowak needs some support from his teammates. The most effective form of support is paralysis. With a majority of the opposing team paralyzed, Marowak is free to come in on opponents who pose little threat to him, such as support Pokemon like Chansey or Registeel, set up a Substitute, and proceed to OHKO the opposition with the appropriate move. Earthquake is Marowak's strongest move when factoring in STAB, and is a force to be reckoned with. Double-Edge makes an appearance on this set thanks to its high Base Power and great coverage alongside Earthquake; as an added bonus, Marowak suffers no recoil from using it thanks to his Rock Head ability. The last slot is mostly filler. Fire Punch allows Marowak to hit Torterra and Tangrowth super effectively, which is very useful as defensive versions of both avoid a 2HKO from Double-Edge. Thunder Punch can also be useful as an opening move to scout for counters, and hits most Flying-types coming in to sponge an Earthquake for heavy damage.</p> <p>When using Marowak, the main goal is to come in on someone who you can force out, such as Registeel or Steelix, and set up Substitute as they switch. It should be noted that Marowak should not be revealed until late-game when the majority of the opposing team is KOed or paralyzed. This is important as it allows him to easily pick off foes without having to constantly switch out as the opponent reveals their Marowak counters. With the lack of Leftovers and no form of recovery available to him, Marowak cannot afford to switch out very often. Substitute is the first move you should use because it allows Marowak to scout the opponent's supposed Marowak counters while blocking him from status conditions and priority moves. Once safely behind a Substitute, Marowak is free to wreak havoc upon the opponent with the appropriate moves.</p> <p>Running Jolly is a must for this set, as otherwise Marowak has nothing to separate himself from the likes of Rhyperior. With Jolly, Marowak is able to outpace and 2HKO 8 Speed Milotic, something his competition cannot boast. Adamant may be tempting for the higher damage output, but Jolly already ensures the necessary KOs mentioned and Adamant offers no other notable ones.</p> <p>Stone Edge can be used in the last slot to give Marowak the awesome EdgeQuake combination and a stronger means to hit Rotom and Mismagius, but isn't recommended because Marowak cannot afford to miss. Double-Edge hits many of the Pokemon Stone Edge does for more damage and retains perfect accuracy. Stone Edge may seem tempting to guarantee the kill on Pokemon like Moltres and Articuno, but they are already KOed by Double-Edge/Thunder Punch after Stealth Rock damage. Focus Punch can be used in the last slot as well, but Fighting and Ground have a lot of overlapping coverage, and Earthquake will be hitting Pokemon for OHKOs and 2HKOs anyway. Focus Punch also requires Marowak to be behind a Substitute, which is not always possible, especially with his low defenses and Speed. However, the ability to OHKO Chansey, Clefable, and Kangaskhan can be welcome.</p> <p>Swords Dance can be used on this set in the last slot as well. At +2 Attack, Marowak has no trouble OHKOing most of the UU tier (bar Rotom and Mismagius if using Earthquake and Double-Edge, or Torterra and Claydol if using EdgeQuake) but it is incredibly difficult to accomplish without paralysis support or Trick Room, as Marowak is slow and will very rarely get more than one free turn to set up.</p> <p>As previously stated, this set thrives on paralysis support. Good teammates to provide said paralysis include Slowbro, Chansey, and Registeel. Slowbro draws Electric attacks which Marowak can switch on for free, and in return Slowbro sponges Water- and Ice-type attacks aimed at Marowak. Chansey and Registeel take special attacks like champs and can easily absorb the Grass-, Water-, and Ice-type attacks that Marowak will encounter. The lack of any form of recovery really hurts this set's effectiveness, so Marowak usually only has one shot to deal massive damage or remove a problem Pokemon; however, this can be remedied with a Wish passing partner such as Clefable, who can also provide Heal Bell support in case Marowak gets burned or poisoned. U-turn abusers such as Scyther, Ambipom, and Swellow make good partners to Marowak as they can lure out the Steel-types who he can easily set up on.</p>"

  "Chansey": {
    "overview": "<p>Just like Blissey in OU, with great Special Defense, enormous HP, and instant recovery in Soft-Boiled, Chansey remains the dominant special wall in UU. Access to both Wish and Aromatherapy to keep her teammates healthy also makes Chansey a very important member on stall teams. Unfortunately, Chansey's utility comes to a halt after that; holding the title of the lowest Defense stat in the game, she will crumble to almost any physical attack. Seismic Toss is also Chansey's only viable option of dealing direct damage, which means she is easily shut down by Taunt users, Ghost-types, RestTalkers, and setup sweepers. Even with these glaring issues, Chansey still consistently fulfills her job as a fantastic team player and full stop to most special attackers, cementing her position as one of the most frustrating defensive threats to face.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heal Bell is identical to Aromatherapy, except it fails to heal Pokemon on your team who have the Soundproof ability. It does have one advantage, though: it is legal with Wish, unlike Aromatherapy. This means Chansey can support her team as both a Wish passer and a cleric on the same set, but another move must be sacrificed. Soft-Boiled can also be used with Wish, but it suffers from the same problem: adopting it requires Chansey to forfeit an important moveslot.</p> <p>Special attacks such as Flamethrower and Ice Beam can theoretically be used by Chansey; however, Chansey's base 35 Special Attack stat is so low that Seismic Toss will do more damage in nearly every situation. The exceptions are against Ghost-types, although Shadow Ball doesn't even 2HKO any of them, and some frail Pokemon with quadruple weaknesses, who are not threatening enough for Chansey to specialize against. Calm Mind doesn't rectify this problem either, as even at +6 Special Attack, Chansey fails to 2HKO any special wall unless it's with a super effective attack. Clefable outclasses Chansey as a Calm Mind sweeper in most aspects due to her higher Defense and Special Attack and is a better option for using special attacks if you dislike Chansey being restricted to Seismic Toss.</p> <p>Shed Shell can be used instead of Leftovers to avoid being trapped by Dugtrio. Charm is a neat option to cripple physical attackers on the switch, but it is illegal with Seismic Toss and Wish. Since few neutral physical hits actually OHKO Chansey, Counter is a good option to surprise opponents, although it is risky against Pokemon who may use a setup move like Swords Dance or Dragon Dance. Light Screen may sound like an odd choice considering Chansey's sky-high Special Defense stat, but she gets many opportunities to support her team with it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>This is where Chansey's lack of offensive prowess comes back to bite her. Generally, physical attackers with strong STAB moves will force Chansey to quit stalling and get out of play. Hariyama is easily Chansey's number one counter; his gigantic 144 base HP lets him easily take Seismic Toss, Guts versions appreciate status, and he can OHKO her with Close Combat. Other Fighting-types, including Blaziken, Toxicroak, Hitmonlee, and Hitmontop, can also OHKO Chansey with powerful Fighting-type attacks.</p> <p>Behind Fighting-types are powerful physical attackers who don't care about status. Nidoking is immune to both Thunder Wave and Toxic and can force Chansey out with the threat of Superpower. Thunder Wave variants of Chansey are setup fodder for Torterra and Rhyperior, while Toxic variants cannot do much to Aggron, Drapion, and Venusaur. Drapion and Absol can also threaten Chansey with Choice Band Pursuit, though both must be wary of Thunder Wave. Dugtrio can trap and OHKO Chansey with Beat Up, assuming the majority of its teammates have reasonable base Attack stats and are in good condition. Dugtrio can also 2HKO Chansey with Earthquake, although Life Orb variants can be stalled out with Wish and Protect. Azumarill can set up 101 HP Substitutes on Chansey for a free Focus Punch or just flat out destroy her with Superpower.</p> <p>Some special attackers can break through Chansey with stat boosting or by sheer force. Mismagius must avoid Toxic on the switch, but if she's behind a Substitute, Chansey cannot touch her, merely giving her free turns to accumulate Calm Mind or Nasty Plot boosts. At +6 Special Attack, Hidden Power Fighting is a 2HKO, so PP stalling isn't an option for Chansey either. Similarly, Calm Mind + RestTalk Spiritomb and Calm Mind Clefable don't care about Toxic, so they can use Chansey as pure setup fodder.</p>",

      "Wish Support": {
        "description": "<p>The way this set plays is virtually identical to Blissey in OU, except with weaker defenses and the inability to use special attacks effectively. However, Chansey still has phenomenal special bulk, which allows her to switch into almost every special attacker with ease. She can then proceed to use Wish and Protect to heal herself or pass the Wish to replenish the health of a teammate. Seismic Toss is Chansey's only worthwhile offensive option; its consistent 100 damage will often outdo even super effective special attacks, and despite it not deterring switch-ins too often, the damage eventually racks up.</p> <p>Chansey is almost forced to use a status move in the last slot, but it is by no means just filler. Toxic is the move of choice for stall teams, where Chansey should be played. It hits Flying-types and Levitators who are immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes and works nicely alongside Wish and Protect to stall out opponents. Toxic also cripples Mismagius and Rotom on the switch, who can otherwise render Chansey useless with Substitute as they are immune to Seismic Toss. Thunder Wave is generally more useful on teams that don't rely heavily on residual damage, since it cripples offensive threats for another team member to pick off. A Calm nature is preferred to handle powerful special attackers, like Nasty Plot Houndoom, better; Bold is an alternative for less vulnerability to strong physical attacks.</p> <p>Stealth Rock can be used in the final slot if your team struggles to fit it elsewhere. To reduce the risk of opponents taking advantage of Protect to set up, Soft-Boiled can replace Protect. This allows more freedom when attacking with Chansey, as she does not need to use Wish with a significant chunk of health remaining in order to throw out an attack. However, this is a less attractive option for stalling out opponents, as Wish + Protect decreases the chances of a critical hit ruining the strategy.</p> <p>To maximize the use of Wish, this set is best employed on stall teams alongside physically defensive Pokemon who lack reliable recovery. Cloyster and Omastar welcome the extra health to set up as many layers of Spikes as possible; likewise, Drapion and Nidoqueen can set up Toxic Spikes. Spiritomb, Rotom, and Mismagius fit the essential spinblocking role that is key to stall teams while also providing a valuable immunity to Fighting-type attacks that will often target Chansey. As physical attacks are generally the best way to counter Chansey, other physically-defensive Pokemon such as Slowbro, Milotic, and Tangrowth are optimal teammates.</p>"

      "Cleric": {
        "description": "<p>Like Blissey, Chansey is a natural choice for a cleric. She can safely switch into a majority of special attackers and rid your team of status while the opposing Pokemon switches out. Chansey's ability to switch in so easily also makes her an ideal user of Stealth Rock, as she can often set it up early in the match; its high PP also compensates for Aromatherapy's low PP, thereby allowing her to compete in PP stall wars. Soft-Boiled is the recovery move of choice since it heals instantly and only takes up one moveslot, unlike Wish + Protect, allowing Aromatherapy to fit in Chansey's moveset. Seismic Toss once again functions as Chansey's only viable option to deal direct damage.</p> <p>If your team can fit Stealth Rock elsewhere, Chansey can opt for a status move instead. The choice of move depends on your team and how exactly you want Chansey to threaten opponents. This set in particular needs to be somewhat threatening in order to discourage powerful sweepers from switching in, lest their key Pokemon gets crippled. Thunder Wave is the most reliable, generic option; most teams appreciate paralysis off of 100% accuracy. Toxic is best for stall-based teams that focus on gradually wearing down the opposition. Bold can be used over Calm to take some physical hits better, but Calm is often better in situations against boosting special sweepers such as Nasty Plot Houndoom.</p> <p>Just like Wish Chansey, this set shines on stall teams. Aromatherapy can be used to its fullest potential when Chansey is paired with Pokemon who generally dislike status. Defensive teams can opt for Rest on Pokemon who lack recovery, as Aromatherapy can cure their sleep status. Blastoise, Hitmontop, and Registeel are examples of common stall team members who can take advantage of this. It's just as useful on balanced teams as well, ridding any status that may have rendered one of your sweepers useless.</p> <p>As with any Chansey set, support is required to deal with opposing physical attackers who can merely use her to boost their stats. Milotic, Slowbro, Tangrowth, and Intimidate Arcanine are solid considerations for a teammate thanks to their access to reliable recovery. Other physical walls who can fulfill this job include Donphan, Weezing, and Steelix; however, since they lack instant recovery, Rest should be used if you want them to constantly absorb hits throughout the battle. Omastar and Cloyster are once again fantastic partners to Chansey with their amazing physical bulk and ability to employ entry hazards.</p>"

Solar Beam, Hidden Power Fire, Ancient Power, and Sleep Powder make Tangela quite difficult to switch into when the weather is sunny. However, Tangrowth and other Pokemon with Chlorophyll, such as Exeggutor and Victreebel, are usually better for this role. This is also the case for Choice Specs, which is outclassed by Tangrowth, and Choice Scarf, which is better done by Venusaur. Tangela also has access to Swords Dance, but its Attack stat is way too low to pull it off efficiently.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Tangela is difficult to counter if you do not have the right lead match-up. Ambipom and Flame Orb Hariyama defeat Tangela relatively easily, as do Choice Scarf Venusaur and TrickScarf Mesprit and Uxie. If you don't have any of these leads, however, then Ghost-types such as Mismagius and Spiritomb make good switch-ins to Tangela, as they are immune to Endeavor, although they need to avoid Leaf Storm. RestTalk Weezing and Altaria do not mind being put to sleep by Sleep Powder. Weezing can use Will-O-Wisp to break Tangela's Focus Sash, while Altaria can just set up Dragon Dance in its face.</p>",

      "Sunny Day + Endeavor Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Tangela is one of three Pokemon who have access to Endeavor, a sleep inducing move, and a way of patching up its poor Speed, the others being Smeargle and Tangrowth. Tangela's lower defenses and higher Speed make it a better Endeavor lead than Tangrowth, and Smeargle is not allowed in UU. The idea behind this set is to incapacitate the opposing lead with Sleep Powder, and then use Endeavor to weaken the switch-in. This is done by allowing the opposing lead to critically damage Tangela while it survives with its Focus Sash, then Sleep Powder is used to put them to sleep. As most opponents will switch out their lead, Tangela can use this turn to set up Sunny Day and double its Speed, and then follow up with a fast Endeavor to bring the switch-in to very low health. When faced with leads such as Omastar and Cloyster, it is usually better to just OHKO them with Leaf Storm before they can do anything.</p> <p>Leaf Storm is the recommended Grass-type move, and is used to deal massive amounts of damage to Ghost-types who are immune to Endeavor, although Energy Ball can be used for reliable, consistent damage. Solar Beam is also an option, although the ability to OHKO Omastar and Cloyster without having to set up the sun is usually more appealing.</p> <p>Fake Out leads such as Ambipom and Flame Orb Hariyama stop Tangela's strategy quite easily, as they can break its Focus Sash without Tangela being able to do anything. Ambipom can then KO Tangela with U-turn or Return, while Hariyama is immune to sleep thanks to its Flame Orb. Opposing sleep-inducing leads such as Venusaur and Jumpluff can also put Tangela to sleep before it can move. Leads who can Trick a Choice item onto Tangela, such as Mesprit and Uxie, will also mess it up. For these reasons, Choice Band Spiritomb is a fantastic teammate to Tangela, as it can switch into Fake Out from Ambipom and Trick from Mesprit and Uxie, and then Pursuit them as they flee; it also takes little damage from any of Hariyama's attacks. Choice Band Altaria and RestTalk Weezing also make excellent checks to Choice Scarf Venusaur or Jumpluff, as they can switch into Sleep Powder without too much trouble. Altaria can use Sleep Talk to pick a Choice Band boosted attack, while RestTalk Weezing does not mind being put to sleep at all.</p> <p>Since Ghost-types are immune to Endeavor, Pokemon who can take them on easily are good teammates. Mixed Houndoom can switch into virtually all Ghost-types in UU and Pursuit them as they flee, or use Crunch to KO them if they are brave enough to stay in. Defensive Drapion is a good counter to Nasty Plot and Calm Mind Mismagius who could potentially set up on Tangela.</p> <p>It is important to note that while Tangela is mostly using Sunny Day for itself, the weather still lasts for five turns, which is enough to be abused by yourself and your opponent alike. Houndoom and Flash Fire Arcanine are excellent teammates for this reason, as they are immune to Fire-type attacks, and receive boosted Fire-type attacks in the sun. Other Chlorophyll abusers can also take advantage of sunny weather; Shiftry, Exeggutor, Victreebel, and Tangrowth are all good examples.</p>"

  "Kangaskhan": {
    "overview": "<p>While physical attacking Normal-types normally have their share of troubles with Ghost-types, Kangaskhan is an exception. It is capable of smacking around Ghost-types with Normal- and Fighting-type moves thanks to its ability Scrappy. In addition to this, Kangaskhan is not particularly frail; it has an impressive 105 HP stat along with passable defenses on both ends. While it doesn't exactly have a jaw-dropping Attack stat like most physical sweepers do, Kangaskhan's stand-out features as a sweeper somewhat compensate for this. Overall, Kangaskhan is a cool and underrated Pokemon; this female kangaroo definitely meshes well in the UU tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There are a number of potential sets that are not among the main sets. You could run an Anti-Lead set with the moves Fake Out, Sucker Punch, Focus Punch, and Counter. However, Kangaskhan doesn't have enough power, unfortunately, to face most common leads. Kangaskhan can also run a support set with Wish, Protect, Return, and Toxic, but it is better off attacking and taking advantage of Scrappy to deal with those pesky Ghost-types. Besides, Lickilicky outclasses it in that role because it has more overall bulk. Kangaskhan can also run a RestTalk set to take advantage of its passable bulk on both ends.</p> <p>Reversal can be used with Substitute and Liechi Berry to deal more damage to Steel- and Rock-types. Double Hit is another option as well in order to break Mismagius's and Rotom's Substitutes. Although it is illegal with Scrappy, Kangaskhan has Sing and Yawn if you ever need to put the opponent to sleep. Kangaskhan is also blessed with an impressive special movepool, but its Special Attack stat is incredibly low. You can go for 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe spread with a Jolly nature if you wish the outpace the Base 80 group.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The Choice Band set is difficult to check since Rock- and Steel-types risk losing a hefty amount of their HP to Hammer Arm or Earthquake, and Ghost-types can't exactly switch in on it. As with most Choiced Pokemon, you need prediction to weather its hits. Defensive Hitmontop can take a STAB Return while OHKOing back with Close Combat. Rhyperior, Regirock, and Steelix are bulky enough to take a boosted Hammer Arm or Earthquake, and they can counteract with their respective STAB moves, or, in the cases of the latter two, Explosion. Omastar and Registeel are decent checks to the Choice Band set if they avoid switching into super effective moves.</p> <p>The SubPunch set has troubles dealing with a majority of the physical walls in the tier. Milotic and Slowbro can easily take it down with the combination of Surf and Slack Off or Recover. Tangrowth can do the same with Power Whip or Leaf Storm and Synthesis. Donphan can take Return while 2HKOing back with Earthquake. Blastoise can take a few Returns while striking back with Surf.</p>",

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>In contrast to other Choice Banded Normal-types, Kangaskhan has the unique ability Scrappy, which allows it to hit Ghost-types with Normal and Fighting moves. The Choice Band set is the perfect choice for Kangaskhan, since it can spam its high-powered STAB moves without being completely walled by Ghost-types. Furthermore, Kangaskhan hits a Speed of 306 with a Jolly nature, meaning it will always have a jump ahead over the omnipresent 80 Base Speed group in the UU tier. Return and Double-Edge are givens, while Hammer Arm and Earthquake deal with those Steel- and Rock-types. Sucker Punch is mostly filler, but it comes in handy when facing faster threats.</p> <p>The first slot comes down to two choices: Return or Double-Edge. Return is usually the preferred choice over the latter since it doesn't have any drawbacks for an attacking move, and it can inflict respectable amounts of damage to the opponent with a Base Power of 102. Double-Edge functions as a more aggressive alternative that deals more damage to physical walls in exchange for some recoil. Hammer Arm allows Kangaskhan to smack Rock- and Steel-types for super effective damage, which would otherwise resist its primary STAB move. It also hits Normal-types for super effective damage. Low Kick can be used over Hammer Arm to hit heavier Pokemon such as Steelix, Rhyperior, and Registeel harder; it also has 100% accuracy and lacks the negative Speed-dropping effect that Hammer Arm possesses. However, it comes at the risky price of hitting lighter Pokemon, such as Omastar and Kabutops, for lower damage. Sucker Punch provides Kangaskhan with a somewhat reliable priority move for hitting Alakazam and Espeon. The last slot is given to Earthquake as a way to hit Rock- and Steel-types without the Speed drop associated with Hammer Arm. Fake Out is another alternative that allows Kangaskhan to function as a revenge killer in tighter situations. Overall, the general idea of the set is to lure in Rock- and Steel-types, allowing Kangaskhan to smack them for the possible KO with the appropriate move. Once the opponent's Rock- and Steel-types are gone, the Return / Double-Edge spamming can commence.</p> <p>Life Orb is another option to use over Choice Band if you are worried about getting locked in on a single move. Aqua Tail is an option if you're using Life Orb, as it KOes Rhyperior if it comes in on Return. Adamant can replace Jolly to allow Kangaskhan to truly 2HKO a number of physical walls, including Slowbro, Donphan, and Milotic, on the switch with Double-Edge, as long as Stealth Rock is down.</p> <p>The Choice Band set is usually hard to deal with since nothing can reliably take the hit on the switch. Rock- and Steel-types are major barricades to this set, so it's advised that you remove them beforehand. Dugtrio is an ideal partner as it can fit on offensive teams while removing Rock- and Steel-types from the match. If you feel the need to space in Kangaskhan with several walls, then Donphan would make an excellent partner. Donphan can combat many Rock- and Steel-types while providing Stealth Rock support for Kangaskhan as an added bonus. Another physical wall that tends to mesh with Kangaskhan is Slowbro, because it can check Hitmontop with relative ease thanks to its part Psychic typing.</p>"
      },
      "SubPunch": {
        "description": "<p>Kangaskhan is an ideal choice for a SubPunch set because it can set up sturdy 101 Substitutes and has good defenses, a passable Attack stat, and the ability Scrappy to hit Ghost-types on the switch. Focus Punch, Sucker Punch, and Return can hit everything in UU for neutral damage. The only concern is that Kangaskhan needs to be behind a Substitute to guarantee itself a hit with Focus Punch.</p> <p>This particular set can run over a team if used correctly. The basic premise is to set up Substitute on the predicted switch-out and from there, you select the appropriate attack accordingly. Focus Punch and Substitute make an excellent combo, and Focus Punch can deal a hefty amount of damage to most Rock- and Steel-types. Kangaskhan's Sucker Punch prevents faster Pokemon from destroying its Substitute. The magic of this set comes from the three moves: Substitute, Focus Punch, and Sucker Punch. If you predict correctly, your opponent will have a hard time hitting Kangaskhan with or without Substitute. Lastly, Return makes a fantastic STAB move for hitting stuff for neutral damage.</p> <p>If this set's results come off a bit mediocre in terms of power, then you can pump up its Attack stat in exchange for some Speed. An EV spread of 212 HP / 120 Atk / 176 Spe with a Jolly nature allows it to outpace the beneficial Base 80 group, while pumping up its Attack stat to deal more damage to the opponent.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this set lacks the raw power without Choice Band or Life Orb. Most physical walls will beat this set, especially ones with a reliable recovery move such as Milotic, Slowbro, and Tangrowth. Venusaur makes an ideal partner alongside Kangaskhan since it can combat many of those same physical walls. With its fantastic dual STAB moves, Venusaur can beat Milotic, Slowbro, Donphan, Tangrowth, Hitmontop, and Blastoise, if played correctly.</p> <p>This set tends to lure in Steel-types, so make sure to bring a Pokemon that enjoys having Steel-types removed from the match. Offensively, Dragon Dance Altaria makes an excellent partner, since it can provide a Fighting-type resistance for Kangaskhan, while also wrecking the opposition with its STAB Outrage. Swords Dance Drapion also appreciates it when Steel-types are removed, particularly Steelix.</p>"

  "Seaking": {
    "overview": "<p>Seaking is one of those Pokemon you should probably avoid using at all costs. Keep in mind that if you do decide to use Seaking that it's outclassed by virtually every other Water-type in UU. Its ability, Swift Swim, gives it the ability to outspeed the whole metagame in the rain, but it has little sweeping potential due to its pathetic movepool and stats. Of course, in Pokemon, there is an inverse correlation between the quality of a Pokemon and the amount of satisfaction you get from beating someone with it; let that be your reason for using Seaking.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Seaking has a very shallow movepool, leaving it with only a few options to choose other than those listed. Bounce can be used to nail Fighting-types such as Hitmontop and Toxicroak, while the potential paralysis is also attractive. Bounce is a 2 turn attack, though, meaning the opponent can easily switch-in a counter or even set up on it; it also wastes two turns of rain for a single attack, which is not good. Poison Jab hurts Grass-types such as Leafeon and Tangrowth, however Ice Beam already 2HKOs them. Outside of rain, Seaking can double its Speed using Agility, though due to its fragility there is little it can safely set up on. Even after it has acquired the Speed to outpace the whole metagame bar faster Choice Scarf users, Seaking holds little in its arsenal for it to have a serious chance to sweep.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky Water-types stand out as the best counters for Seaking as it lacks anything that can significantly hurt them. Milotic and Blastoise can take several Megahorns to the face, and in return either Toxic stall Seaking or obliterate it with Hidden Power Grass. Poliwrath is the one Pokemon Seaking is completely helpless against, as its typing gives it a resistance to Megahorn and Ice Beam, and Water Absorb will make Water-type moves useless. Venusaur is 3HKOed by Ice Beam, although it can easily outpace Seaking outside of rain and OHKO it with a STAB Grass-type attack. Both Uxie and Mesprit can take a Megahorn or two and cripple Seaking with Thunder Wave in a pinch. Shedinja is immune to all of Seaking's attacks and can set up on it or even cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Remember that Seaking has poor defenses and Speed, so anything packing a powerful move that can OHKO it will pretty much do this goldfish in if it can find the opportunity to strike.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "FUCK YEAH SEAKING!": {
        "description": "<p>The choice between Waterfall and Aqua Tail depends on whether you prefer the extra power Aqua Tail provides or Waterfall's higher accuracy. Megahorn puts a dent in the likes of Hypno and Espeon and hits Grass-types, particularly Exeggutor, for super effective damage. Return has legitimate coverage with Water-type attacks, as between them they hit every type in the metagame, save for Shedinja, for neutral damage. The set is rounded out with Ice beam, enabling Seaking to 2HKO Tangrowth and Leafeon and destroying both Torterra and Altaria, two Pokemon Seaking would otherwise be helpless against. Swift Swim is the chosen ability because it doubles Seaking's Speed in the rain, not to mention that under rain its STAB attacks could do with the pseudo-STAB boost.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Seaking's Attack and allows it to outspeed Timid Choice Scarf Rotom and Timid Omastar in the rain. The remaining EVs are dumped into Seaking's Special Attack to give Ice Beam some extra power. Life Orb is the chosen item since the goldfish lacks an array of powerful moves and needs the boost to make up for its unimpressive Attack stat. The 10% recoil damage isn't worth worrying about due to Seaking's poor defenses; he won't be taking neutral hits well in the first place.</p> <p>When using Seaking, note that it is a huge liability to your team, and in addition to that, it requires a considerable amount of team support for it to function well. Rain Dance is essential for Seaking to function as it cant do much with its appalling base 68 Speed. Uxie and Mesprit are good candidates for the job of providing rain as their bulk allows them to set up Rain Dance several times during the match. They can also provide Stealth Rock support which not only secures certain OHKOes and 2HKOes (Ice Beam has the potential to 2HKO Venusaur after Stealth Rock damage), but also punishes Pokemon attempting to switch out and waste the turns of rain. Electrode and Ambipom are also great Rain Dance users as they have high Speed and pack Taunt, which acts as a safeguard for Seaking, preventing it from getting statused while attempting to sweep.</p> <p>Other Swift Swim users also make great teammates for Seaking, especially Ludicolo as it can use its STAB Grass-type attacks to get rid of bulky Water-types that stand in Seaking's way. Both Qwilfish and Kabutops can set up Swords Dance and dismantle the opposing team, allowing Seaking to secure an easy late-game sweep. Defensive Pokemon that can take advantage of the temporary rain are also welcome. Registeel is able to withstand a multitude of attacks, negate its Fire-type weakness with Rain Dance, and cripple opposing Pokemon with either Thunder Wave or Toxic; it can also set up Stealth Rock. Rotom and Lanturn can fire off 100% accurate Thunder in the rain and also deal with the opponent's bulky Water-types. Lastly, Venusaur has great synergy with Seaking, resisting both Electric- and Grass-type attacks which Seaking simply cannot take. It can also help take down sturdy walls such as Milotic and Blastoise, both of which wall Seaking with ease.</p>"

  "Scyther": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite a crippling 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, Scyther is an extremely dangerous and often underestimated UU sweeper. Its great dual STABs provide excellent neutral coverage, and also hit many common defensive Pokemon for super effective damage (including Hitmontop, Uxie, Venusaur, and Slowbro). In addition, its high Speed and welcome resistances to Fighting and Grass means that it can check and revenge kill many common offensive Pokemon. However, Stealth Rock is hostile to Scyther, shaving off a substantial 50% of its HP; dedicated Rapid Spin support is nearly essential to ensuring success with Scyther. Despite this admittedly large flaw, mustering up the necessary support is definitely worth it when you consider Scyther's destructive potential.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Using a 29 HP IV on sweeper sets can give Scyther greater longevity in the long-term. This yields an HP stat of 279 instead of 281, which means Scyther loses 1 less HP from both Life Orb recoil and Stealth Rock damage. After two of these events (either a switch into Stealth Rock and a Life Orb recoil or two Life Orb recoils), Scyther breaks even; at three or more, Scyther with a 29 HP IV will actually have more HP than those with 31 HP IVs.</p> <p>176 Speed EVs are a good guideline for Scyther, regardless of nature. With Adamant, it hits 290, which means Scyther can outrun Sharpedo, Jynx, and Primeape without Speed-boosting natures, while with Jolly it attains 319, which outruns all Pokemon with 95 base Speed or less. In Jolly's case, an extra 4 EVs allow Scyther to outrun Speed-neutral base 110 Speed Pokemon. Besides some specifics noted in the sets, aim for maximizing Attack and Speed. Ensure that Scyther's HP is odd, so it can switch into Stealth Rock twice. For most sets, the remaining 4 EVs are placed into Special Defense to ensure the rare Download Porygon2 won't receive a Special Attack boost.</p> <p>Roost is in general a decent move, but Scyther doesn't quite have adequate defenses to use it effectively. Double Hit gets a Technician boost, so it's useful for breaking Substitutes. Thief also gets a Technician boost, but its power is still a paltry 60, and it may snag an item that is useless to Scyther.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As previously mentioned, Stealth Rock will destroy Scyther quickly, but there are also several Pokemon who can weather its assaults.</p> <p>Steelix and Registeel resist both of Scyther's STABs and can set up Stealth Rock to boot. Although they are both weak to Fighting, their high Defense stats mean they can easily survive even a Swords Dance boosted Brick Break; Steelix can KO Scyther with Gyro Ball or Explosion, and Registeel can cripple it with Thunder Wave and wear it down with Iron Head. Steelix has the added benefit of being able to Roar out the Baton Pass set. Although Rhyperior and Regirock don't resist Bug, their physical bulkiness and STAB Rock attacks let them handle Scyther with relative ease. Rotom also resists both of Scyther's STAB attacks and can KO with Thunderbolt.</p> <p>The few Pokemon who are naturally faster than Scyther can check it in a pinch, although they will all have to predict and avoid switching into a move that will OHKO them. Swellow sports a super effective Brave Bird, while Jumpluff can come into a support move like Substitute or Swords Dance and use Encore to stall Scyther while it switches to an offensive Pokemon.</p> <p>Priority moves such as Mach Punch, Fake Out, and Sucker Punch will beat the sets that focus on Reversal, while they can help wear down Life Orb versions for offensive teams.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Scyther has naturally high Attack and Speed, and Swords Dance and Life Orb complement its stats to make it an extremely vicious physical sweeper in UU. Scyther packs resistances to Fighting- and Grass-type moves along with an immunity to Ground-type moves, which gives it setup opportunities on quite a few popular Pokemon. However, due to its relative frailty, Scyther shines most when brought out in the late-game after its counters have been weakened and the other team has been scouted.</p> <p>Aerial Ace is chosen as Scyther's STAB move of choice over Bug Bite due to its superior neutral coverage; Electric-type Pokemon aren't very common apart from Rotom (who also resists Bug Bite); most Rock-type Pokemon take more damage from Brick Break than they would from a neutral Bug Bite; finally, Steel-type Pokemon resist both Flying and Bug. Brick Break ensures Scyther isn't walled by Steelix, Registeel, and Rhyperior, and in conjunction with Aerial Ace provides perfect neutral coverage in UU with the exception of Rotom. In the last slot, Quick Attack ensures quick but frail sweepers such as Alakazam or Dugtrio won't end your sweep, and is a great way to pick off weakened set-up sweepers.</p> <p>Bug Bite can be used over either of the last two attacks depending on what the rest of your team looks like--Brick Break isn't as useful if Scyther has Rhyperior or Torterra at its side, ready to take advantage of Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon; on the other hand, Quick Attack may be dropped if you feel that you're safe against speedy but frail sweepers.</p> <p>There is a multitude of options Scyther can use instead of the moves on this set. In terms of attacking moves, Reversal can be used over Brick Break if you don't have Rapid Spin support, because its Base Power varies and it becomes more powerful when Scyther is under 34.4% HP. Night Slash is usable to hit defensive Rotom (Aerial Ace does a minimum of 87% to offensive Rotom after a Swords Dance anyway), but loses a huge amount of power against neutral targets. Baton Pass is also viable, especially if one intends to use this Scyther early in the game and has other Pokemon who would benefit greatly from a Swords Dance. Potential Baton Pass recipients should be adept at taking on Scyther's common counters, so using a Fighting-type like Hitmonlee or Hitmontop or a Ground-type like Rhyperior or Torterra is recommended.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Scyther frequently won't have time to Swords Dance and doesn't particularly appreciate Life Orb's recoil in tandem with Stealth Rock damage, so using a Choice Band is a logical alternative. The goal of this set is to chip away at the other team with repeated fast U-turns while simultaneously threatening to sweep with its powerful Aerial Ace. This means that while Rapid Spin support is appreciated by Scyther's other sets, it is absolutely vital to the success of this set.</p> <p>Aerial Ace and Bug Bite are still Scyther's strongest STAB attacks, but U-turn is preferred over Bug Bite despite its inferior Base Power due to its wonderful ability to scout. Quick Attack is useful for picking off weakened sweepers who have a Speed boost under their belts. Pursuit can trap the Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon who frequently flee from Scyther's STAB attacks. Finally, Brick Break remains a perfect auxiliary attack for combating Steel- and Rock-types like Registeel, Steelix, and Rhyperior.</p> <p>Donphan is a choice with great offensive synergy with Scyther since it can come into Steel- and Rock-types with the aid of Scyther's U-turn and use Rapid Spin to clear the field for Scyther; in return, Scyther is an excellent check to Venusaur (watch out for Sleep Powder, however). Hitmontop has similarly useful synergy with Scyther's U-turn, but is usually more effective on defensive teams. Cloyster doesn't have much defensive synergy with Scyther, but has enormous physical bulk and can set up Spikes to make Scyther's U-turns much more deadly.</p>"

      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>This set's main goal is to rely on Scyther's good bulk to pass Swords Dance boosts to a dangerous sweeper, and its effectiveness is thanks mostly to the great success of the Swords Dance set; many opponents will switch their walls into Scyther, not expecting it to be bulky enough to set up on them or pass its boost to something else. Swords Dance and Baton Pass are the most important moves as they allow Scyther to set up and pass the boosts to a sweeper. Aerial Ace is the third move to avoid being shut down by fast Taunt users such as Mismagius and Ambipom, and is a powerful STAB move with good coverage. When taking into account the Attack boosts Scyther will grab, it will dent everything that doesn't resist it, being able to grab a few KOs should the opportunity arise. The last slot offers a choice between two moves, but Substitute is often the preferred option as it protects Scyther from status moves, as well as Trick, and allows the recipient of the boosts to switch in unscratched. Leftovers is the superior item for the extra setup turn it may grant Scyther with.</p> <p>A Jolly nature with 216 Speed EVs lets Scyther outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Charizard and Entei. The 224 HP EVs provide Scyther with more bulk while minimizing the damage it suffers from Stealth Rock, and the rest goes to Defense to let it take physical hits better. Agility can be used instead of Swords Dance to help slower hard-hitters. Roost is an alternative over Substitute and it helps Scyther with its 4x Stealth Rock weakness, as well as setting up on weak offensive Pokemon. Salac Berry is an alternative item and, if the plan works, Scyther will find itself passing +2 Attack / +1 Speed, which is often enough for any sweeper to destroy the opponent's team. However, this is a very risky situation because in order to activate Salac Berry, Scyther will have to be at less than 25% health and, at that point, any attack will KO it.</p> <p>The best teammates are Pokemon that benefit from the boosts Scyther will be grabbing. Tauros, Sceptile (even though Sceptile and Scyther have very poor synergy), and Azumarill are examples of Pokemon that can destroy unprepared teams when armed with a Swords Dance boost: the former two have great Speed and therefore become nearly unstoppable, while the latter possesses good bulk and a very strong priority attack. On the other hand, Rhyperior, Octillery, and Blaziken are perhaps the three most prominent Pokemon that, with an Agility boost, can wreak havoc thanks to very high-powered STAB moves and adequate coverage. Finally, Scyther appreciates Rapid Spin support, so Pokemon such as Hitmontop and Donphan are also good teammates thanks to great bulk and good synergy.</p>"

After shutting down her counters with Lovely Kiss and boosting her Special Attack with Nasty Plot, she can devastate unprepared teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Jynx can function somewhat well with a Choice item due to her high Speed and Special Attack. Choice sets should primarily use four of the following moves: Ice Beam, Psychic, Focus Blast, Shadow Ball, Lovely Kiss, and Trick. However, Jynx's relative frailty, Stealth Rock weakness, and vulnerability to the common Pursuit hinder a Choice set's effectiveness.</p> <p>Grass Knot can be used as an offensive option over Psychic or Focus Blast in order to hit Milotic and Slowking harder. However, both Psychic and Focus Blast will offer much better general utility.</p> <p>Jynx is the second fastest Pokemon with a reliable sleep move in UU; as such, she can make a useful anti-lead. A lead Jynx should be holding Focus Sash and have Lovely Kiss, with the other moves depending primarily on the kind of leads the player does not mind losing to. Shadow Ball is necessary for a good chance of KOing Mesprit, Uxie, and Alakazam before they wake up, while Grass Knot guarantees KOs on Omastar, Kabutops, and Rhyperior. Protect allows Jynx to beat Ambipom leads and is useful for scouting Trick, while Ice Beam and Psychic are hard-hitting STAB moves. Counter is an interesting option, but better left to Alakazam. Be very careful against leads suspected of carrying a Focus Sash or a Lum Berry, increasingly common items. This Jynx is best used on teams that appreciate the lack of early-game entry hazards and can set up on leads whom Jynx typically loses to (such as Spiritomb).</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The counters who give Jynx the most trouble are Haze Milotic, RestTalk Registeel, and specially defensive Spiritomb. Milotic is only 2HKOed by +6 Jynx, which is a difficult task since it requires Milotic to be asleep for four turns. Note, however, that if Jynx has forgone Substitute for Psychic, Milotic becomes much more manageable and ceases to be a counter. A similar situation applies for Registeel; Registeel can KO Jynx with Iron Head at any time, and only loses if Jynx can lock it down long enough with Lovely Kiss that Registeel cannot recover with Rest before Jynx eliminates it, or if Jynx chooses to run Focus Blast in her final slot. Specially defensive Spiritomb can survive even +4 Ice Beam, while taking Jynx out of the game with Pursuit or Shadow Sneak. Unlike Registeel and Milotic, Spiritomb beats Jynx regardless of her moveset. Chansey also handily stalls out Jynx, but only if Sleep Clause is active; if not, Jynx will merely put Chansey to sleep and use her as setup fodder. Due to Natural Cure, Chansey will cause Sleep Clause to deactivate if she switches out. Some less common counters include Thick Fat Hariyama, Thick Fat Grumpig, Walrein, Lapras, Lanturn, and Slowking. Note again that all of these counters are only counters if Sleep Clause is activated; otherwise, they don't have much chance of beating Jynx one-on-one.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Jynx is one of the few Pokemon who has access to Nasty Plot, and this set takes full advantage of her unique traits in order to secure a sweep. The idea behind the execution of this set is simple: switch Jynx in on a resisted special attack (or after a KO) and set up a Substitute to circumvent Jynx's terrible defenses. As the opponent switches to a counter, Jynx can put it to sleep with Lovely Kiss. With the opponent's primary answer to Jynx incapacitated, she can safely boost her stats from behind a Substitute. The opponent is forced to bring in a less efficient response, at which point Jynx is free to attack and seriously damage it or KO it and attempt a sweep, depending on your opponent's team and your move options. If you chose to forgo Substitute, just start attacking, unless you are fairly certain that you can successfully sweep the remainder of the opponent's team with a Nasty Plot boost. Either way, you will be able to place incredible pressure on your opponent, and he will likely reveal his Choice Scarfers or priority users in order to force Jynx out as quickly as possible. This will be your chance to eliminate or weaken them with Pursuit users and/or lures, ensuring that Jynx's next attempt at a sweep is decisive.</p> <p>In practice, however, the execution of this strategy may not be so simple. Your opponent may predict your attempt to put Jynx's counter to sleep and double switch to a less important Pokemon or a sleep absorber, preventing you from incapacitating Jynx's main counter. It's even possible that your opponent may have multiple specially bulky resists or enough priority users to ensure Jynx simply cannot sweep. Any well-built team will not immediately lose to a Pokemon with a sleep move and powerful STAB; it is up to Jynx's user to build a team based around removing and weakening her checks, and to play intelligently to avoid wasting Lovely Kiss or needlessly sacrificing Jynx. Otherwise, she will simply not be successful. Give her the necessary support, however, and you will find that she performs in her niche admirably well.</p> <p>The given EVs allow for maximum sweeping potential, with 8 EVs placed in HP to attain a Leftovers number. Life Orb may be used if a coverage move is deemed preferable to Substitute in the final slot; note, however, that Substitute makes Jynx much harder to kill and shields her from faster threats like Swellow and Mismagius, so you should only opt for a coverage move if your team does better against offensive teams than it does against stall teams. Psychic offers better neutral coverage than Ice Beam, but it is not recommended as the mono-attack on this set, as Dark-types will completely wall Jynx. Given that Pokemon like Spiritomb, Houndoom, and Skuntank frequently carry Pursuit, using Psychic as the only attack will ensure that Jynx accomplishes nearly nothing against any team with those Pokemon.</p>"
      },
      "Luna (SubCM)": {
        "description": "<p>While the Nasty Plot set emphasizes plowing through the opposing team with powerful boosted attacks, this Jynx takes a much more defensive approach towards sweeping. This set takes advantage of the fact that many of the Nasty Plot set's counters are specially-oriented Water-types, and aims to easily set up on them. The given EVs make Jynx very specially bulky; Pokemon like Milotic and Lanturn cannot break Jynx's Substitutes with their neutral STABs after a Calm Mind boost, and even Pokemon like Weezing cannot break Jynx's Substitutes with Flamethrower after two Calm Minds. Jynx can even survive monstrously powerful special assaults, like Life Orb Moltres's Fire Blast, after a couple of boosts. If, upon realizing this, the opponent switches to a physically-oriented counter, Jynx can simply put it to sleep and continue boosting.</p> <p>This set is very frustrating for frailer offensive teams and balanced teams to face, as they often don't have more than one Pokemon who can both survive Jynx's assaults and prevent her from setting up, and they can no longer merely use a bulky Water-type or a specially-oriented Choice Scarf user to force this Jynx out. However, bulky offense teams have a significantly easier time with this set, as the entire idea behind bulky offense is to have Pokemon who can both take a hit and hit back hard. Against these teams, it is recommended to preserve Jynx as a late-game sweeper for when the opponent's Ice-type resists are either weakened or gone.</p> <p>The given EVs allow for significant special bulk while still enabling Jynx to Speed tie and often outrun threatening Pokemon such as Arcanine, Drapion, and Houndoom. While the relative lack of Special Attack EVs may make Jynx appear \"weak\", do not be fooled; even with minor investment, Jynx's Special Attack is nearly as high as maximum Special Attack Timid Rotom, and she will definitely hurt most neutral targets after a boost or two. If more power is desired, a spread of 8 HP / 248 SpA / 252 Spe may be used, but this is not recommended due to the significantly higher amount of damage Jynx will take from special assaults. Moreover, if this Jynx does not meet the user's offensive requirements, the Nasty Plot set should probably be used instead.</p>"
      },
      "Attacking Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Jynx is the second fastest Pokemon in UU with a reliable sleep-inducing move, and her offensive capabilities and support options allow her to function as an effective anti-lead. Lovely Kiss is the main merit of this set, allowing Jynx to disable bulky leads, like Uxie and Mesprit, both of whom few Pokemon can immediately KO; this prevents them from executing their strategy while giving you time to execute your own.</p> <p>Ice Beam is the primary option for an attacking move due to its excellent neutral coverage. Grass Knot's main purpose is for OHKOing Cloyster, Kabutops, and Omastar, as well as for doing substantial damage to Milotic and Blastoise. Psychic is useful for getting quick kills on Hariyama and Qwilfish, while also letting you hit Arcanine very hard. The final slot depends on the general function that Jynx needs to fulfill. Nasty Plot allows Jynx to immediately place great pressure on opposing teams, forcing them to reveal more Pokemon and putting Jynx in a position to do major damage to key Pokemon like Milotic and Houndoom. However, note that even at +2 Special Attack, several Pokemon can still wall Jynx depending on the offensive moves you choose to run, which allows them to set up on or KO her. For instance, Registeel can switch in after the opposing lead absorbs sleep and takes next to no damage from Psychic, Ice Beam, or Grass Knot. It can then set up Stealth Rock, start spreading paralysis with Thunder Wave, or start using Curse. However, Taunt allows Jynx to stop such setup from occurring. In addition, Jynx is faster than or ties with every user of Stealth Rock in the tier, barring the rare Dugtrio, making her effective at preventing entry hazards. Taunt is also useful to prevent any switch-ins that she cannot hurt from setting up in her face.</p> <p>As mentioned above, Ice Beam is the best option for a primary attack since it has amazing coverage in UU. However, Focus Blast, Shadow Ball, and any other move slashed in as an alternative are all viable options over Ice Beam. Focus Blast allows Jynx to take on Registeel, while Shadow Ball allows Jynx to more efficiently dispose of Uxie and Mesprit. If Ice Beam is replaced with a move option that was slashed in on another slot, Jynx becomes more optimized for leading but less so for the mid game.</p> <p>Lum Berry can be used in place of Focus Sash to guarantee that an unlucky Lovely Kiss miss does not result in Jynx being paralyzed by the likes of Uxie or Mesprit. It also lets you defeat Jumpluff and other sleep-inducing leads who are employing Choice Scarf. However, the use of Lum Berry requires the user to be much more careful when using Jynx, as most physical attacks will outright KO her without a Focus Sash.</p> <p>This Jynx can also be used with Choice Scarf as the item. If using Choice Scarf, Trick becomes an invaluable move, and should be used over Nasty Plot/Taunt. In addition, Focus Blast becomes the most viable secondary attacking move despite its poor accuracy, since it OHKOes Ambipom, Cloyster, and Omastar. Choice Scarf allows Jynx to incapacitate even Scarf Uxie before it can use Stealth Rock, making her one of the most reliable anti-leads in the tier; however, the cost is a significant loss in versatility compared to using Focus Sash.</p> <p>Counter can be used in the final slot, as it enables Jynx to get surprise KOs on Arcanine and any leads who attempt to U-turn to one of her counters. However, note that Spiritomb, one of the most popular counters to Jynx, is immune to Counter. Many of the Pokemon who would be seeking to wall Jynx are also specially inclined. Moreover, without the added power of Nasty Plot or the ability to Taunt the opposition, Jynx does not pose much of an threat to opposing leads once Counter has been revealed.</p> <p>Fake Out is an option in the final slot as Jynx's only form of priority. It eliminates the Focus Sash of leads such as Qwilfish, Cloyster, and Scyther, while allowing you to block slower users of Fake Out, such as Hariyama. However, Jynx's attack is pathetic, so Fake Out's use is very specific to beating those particular leads. Protect is another option along these lines, allowing you to beat Ambipom and scout moves from possible Choice Scarf leads, but like Fake Out, it has little use otherwise.</p> <p>When used in the lead slot, Jynx functions best on a team dedicated to abusing the lack of early-game entry hazards. Powerful scouters, such as Scyther, and Stealth Rock-weak sweepers, such as Moltres and Arcanine, will very much appreciate the lack of entry hazards. Pokemon who are walled by Omastar, Uxie, and other bulky leads will have an infinitely easier time attempting a sweep once Jynx cripples those leads. Jynx's ability to scout and weaken the opposing team also helps dangerous but easily-walled endgame sweepers, such as Dragon Dance Feraligatr and Swords Dance Leafeon.</p> <p>Ideally, Jynx should be paired with Pokemon who are able to take advantage of the leads she typically loses to. Spiritomb, for instance, can easily switch in on Ambipom and Pursuit it, start spreading burns, or set up with Calm Mind. It can also switch in easily on uncommon Hariyama variants who carry both Fake Out and Bullet Punch. Rhyperior and Donphan use Registeel as set up bait, and even sweepers such as Moltres and physical Venusaur can safely come in if Jynx has Taunted Registeel beforehand. Houndoom can easily set up on any Spiritomb lead lacking Hidden Power Fighting, while Toxicroak can set up on any Spiritomb lacking Will-O-Wisp and Psychic.</p>"

  "Electabuzz": {
    "overview": "<p>Electabuzz, a highly popular Underused Pokemon in RSE, received both a blessing and a curse in the transition to the DPP metagame - while it struggles to regain its old popularity in the Underused tier, it was blessed with an evolution, Electivire, who ascended the ranks into Overused. Pokemon whom Electabuzz once dominated entirely and Pokemon who didn't exist in RSE now compete with Electabuzz for a spot on a team, and Electabuzz simply does not have enough going for it to merit its old popularity. The most notable of the Pokemon who have crept out from Electabuzz's old shadow is Manectric, who is now blessed with an extended movepool and is almost always a far more usable choice. Despite this, Electabuzz is still a reasonably good mixed sweeper, and unlike Manectric, it is still able to defeat Chansey one-on-one. Though certainly not the best, it is definitely not the worst at its job and occupies its own unique niche in the metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>On the special side, Discharge and Thunder are both alternatives to Thunderbolt as the STAB move of choice, with Discharge having lower raw power than Thunderbolt but a higher paralysis chance, and Thunder having more power, less accuracy, and the same paralysis chance as Discharge. Neither is wholly reliable, however, so Thunderbolt is usually the best choice. Focus Blast is another notable option for its ability to OHKO Steelix, but its low accuracy is a massive turn-off. Other moves that have some utility are those that catch some of the lesser seen special walls off-guard: Signal Beam hits Hypno, Uxie, and Grumpig for slightly more damage than a neutral Thunderbolt would.</p> <p>On the physical side, one can employ a SubPunch strategy with Substitute and Focus Punch, allowing Electabuzz to 2HKO Registeel and OHKO Chansey. The only other physical moves of note, aside from Return, are the elemental punches. Each may be used as a coverage move or as an alternative to Hidden Power in certain situations. Toxic allows Electabuzz to hit bulky Pokemon such as Uxie and Spiritomb on the switch-in. Charge Beam can boost Electabuzz's Special Attack, but Charge Beam Electabuzz is pretty much entirely outclassed by Manectric. Lastly, Screech can allow Electabuzz to OHKO Chansey with Cross Chop.</p> <p>Electabuzz's most indispensable asset is undoubtedly its Speed, and so it is almost always profitable to invest as much as possible in it. 252 Speed EVs and a Naive nature allows Electabuzz to outpace Timid 252 Speed Hidden Power Fighting Mismagius and tie with other positive-natured base 105s such as Scyther and Manectric. If you wish to invest more in other stats, 216 Speed EVs and a Naive nature allows Electabuzz to beat positive-natured base 100s such as Typhlosion. Next in order of importance are its offensive stats. The majority of EVs should be invested in the attacking stat you are focusing on, while you can divert some EVs to the other if you wish. When going mixed, remember that the most prominent special wall, Chansey, is 2HKOed by Cross Chop without any investment, and the most prominent physical wall, Steelix, is 2HKOed by Focus Blast without investment. Thus, not many EVs are needed to bypass common threats to solo stat sweepers. The more Electabuzz invests in its main attacking stat the better, for it is nowhere near as strong as some other popular mixed sweepers. Lastly, your HP stat should end in a 9 if you use Life Orb to minimize recoil damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Registeel is almost a complete stop to Electabuzz, easily shrugging off anything Electabuzz has to throw at it thanks to its titanic defenses. The best Electabuzz can muster is Cross Chop, which is not even guaranteed to 3HKO specially defensive variants. Steelix is more or less in the same boat, though it fears Hidden Power Fire and Focus Blast. Earthquake from Registeel or Steelix easily puts away Electabuzz for good. Uxie has great defensive stats as well, taking little damage from Signal Beam or Thunderbolt and hitting back with Thunder Wave or STAB Psychic. Rotom resists nearly everything from a standard mixed Electabuzz and can use STAB Shadow Ball, Thunder Wave, or Will-O-Wisp to cripple physical variants.</p> <p>Ground- and Grass-types are immune to or resist Electabuzz's STAB attacks, and while they are often at risk of being hit by a super effective Hidden Power, those who are bulky enough to withstand one or two onslaughts make decent checks. Tangrowth and Donphan have high Defense and can take Ice Punch from physical Electabuzz, while specially defensive Venusaur can brush off Hidden Power Ice or Fire with Synthesis and hit back with its STAB moves. A special mention goes to Claydol, who resists all three entry hazards and has decent defensive stats, Rapid Spin, and STAB Earthquake. If Electabuzz lacks Hidden Power Grass, it is easily countered by Lanturn and Gastrodon.</p> <p>Hypno and Grumpig both have high Special Defense and resist Cross Chop, making them excellent counters to Electabuzz. Keep in mind that Electabuzz is quite frail and easily revenge-killed, though there are not many Pokemon who are faster than it who are commonly used in UU. Swellow can revenge with Facade, but cannot risk switching into Thunderbolt. A special mention goes to Dugtrio, who is faster and can trap Electabuzz and kill it with STAB Earthquake.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>What sets Electabuzz apart from the crowd is its excellent Speed, which coupled with its acceptable offensive stats makes it an effective mixed late-game cleaner. Thunderbolt is the STAB move of choice, with good neutral coverage as well as useful super effective coverage on bulky Water-types. For the second moveslot, a Hidden Power of your choice can be employed in order to hit certain targets. With Hidden Power Grass, you can hit Pokemon who are immune to Electabuzz's STAB, such as Rhyperior, Lanturn, and Quagsire, super effectively, usually making it the best choice. Hidden Power Ice, on the other hand, achieves much more general coverage, with the combination of Thunderbolt + Hidden Power Ice hitting almost every Pokemon in the game for neutral damage.</p> <p>Electabuzz suffers from being perpetually compared to Manectric on all counts since they share the same ability, same typing, same Speed, and similar movepools, though Manectric has slightly higher Special Attack to Electabuzz's slightly higher Attack. While Manectric is certainly a more accomplished special sweeper, Electabuzz has a number of moves that give it an advantage in certain situations. The most notable of these is Cross Chop, which with minimal investment 2HKOes standard 252 Defense Calm Chansey, who is the most prominent special sponge in UU and Manectric's greatest nemesis. If you run Hidden Power Ice, however, it may be worth your while to run Focus Blast, a stronger special attack that can OHKO Steelix and offensive Rhyperior. In the last slot, Psychic is necessary if you chose Hidden Power Grass in order to strike Venusaur, who otherwise walls Electabuzz. If you chose any other Hidden Power, then Substitute is an excellent choice to allow Electabuzz to scout, ease prediction on the switch, and avoid status afflictions.</p> <p>If you don't like Cross Chop's accuracy, there are a number of alternatives available. Focus Punch pairs well with Substitute and can OHKO Calm Chansey after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKO 252 HP Registeel, but is useless if you don't have a Substitute up. Low Kick is stronger against Registeel but fails to 2HKO Chansey. Toxic is also an option to increase residual damage on walls such as Donphan and Uxie, making them more easily worn down over time. Charge Beam can be used in the hope that it will grant Electabuzz a Special Attack boost. Hidden Power Fire is also an option, as it provides coverage against Steelix and Grass-types. The EVs are fairly straightforward sweeping EVs, while a 29 HP IV is advised to allow a maximum of 11 uses of Life Orb rather than 10.</p> <p>It is necessary to weaken Electabuzz's common responses, most notably Registeel and Steelix (if you lack Hidden Power Fire or Focus Blast), if you want it to clean up. If they lack Shed Shell, both can be trapped by Magneton and Dugtrio. However, you must be wary, as Earthquake and Iron Head from either will do significant damage to Magneton and Dugtrio, respectively. For a more general response, a bulky Water-type is your best shot at taking down Steelix and other Ground-types, and a strong Fire- or Fighting-type can deal with Registeel. Lacking Hidden Power Fire, Ice, or Psychic leaves Electabuzz vulnerable to Venusaur, so Registeel can be a useful ally to deal with it and other specially oriented threats. However, using Registeel with Electabuzz comes at the expense of creating a large Ground-type weakness for your team.</p> <p>Another useful partner to consider is Venusaur itself, whose STAB moves gain super effective coverage on Ground- and Grass-types, the most common types in UU that resist Electabuzz's STAB. Venusaur is also useful for taking care of such foes as Donphan, Tangrowth, Lanturn, and Quagsire, since all of them give Electabuzz trouble depending on what Hidden Power it is running. Other Pokemon to watch out for include those who have very high defensive stats and no weaknesses to the moves Electabuzz commonly carries. This overall category is serviced adequately by wallbreakers; Absol and Drapion both have STAB Night Slash and Pursuit to deal with the Psychic- and Ghost-types while Blaziken's powerful Fire Blast will weaken Uxie and Arcanine. Weezing makes for another good partner as it is a fairly solid stop to most Grass-, Fighting-, and Ground-types, while also having excellent defensive synergy with Registeel.</p>"

  "Pinsir": {
    "overview": "<p>Pinsir is often overlooked due to his bad Special Defense, only decent Speed, and more importantly, his Stealth Rock weakness. Luckily, Pinsir is a great Pokemon if used properly, as he has a monstrous Attack stat and enough Speed to outrun the common base 80 Speed Pokemon, such as Blaziken and Venusaur. This, coupled with a great offensive movepool including X-Scissor, Close Combat, Stone Edge, Earthquake, and Swords Dance, makes him a potent threat in the UU metagame. His abilities are very good too; Mold Breaker allows Pinsir to hit Levitating foes with Earthquake, while Hyper Cutter makes him immune to Intimidate. However, it isn't all good news for Pinsir. Besides the aforementioned Stealth Rock weakness, fast Pokemon such as Swellow, Arcanine, and Alakazam easily revenge kill him if he is not carrying a Choice Scarf. His lackluster HP and Special Defense also make him susceptible to strong special attacks. All in all, if you play Pinsir to his strengths, he won't disappoint you.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bulk Up is an option, but Pinsir's terrible Special Defense makes it unappealing. Similarly, a mono-attacker set with Bulk Up, X-Scissor, Rest, and Sleep Talk can be used, but with Pinsir's pitiful Special Defense, such a set is not recommended. Brick Break and Superpower are also options, but Close Combat is a much better choice. They should only be considered when Pinsir is running Quick Attack, as Close Combat + Quick Attack is an illegal combination. Flail with Endure or Substitute can also be used, but it's very unreliable. Feint Attack is Pinsir's only attack to hit Ghosts super effectively, but its poor Base Power makes it a lackluster option. Knock Off and Toxic are options for crippling walls, but Pinsir is much better off simply attacking.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Hariyama is quite bulky and can take Pinsir's attacks with ease, making him an excellent counter. Hitmontop can do the same thanks to Intimidate, but Pinsir could be running Hyper Cutter as his ability, so Hitmontop must be wary. Most Fire-types such as Arcanine, Entei, Typhlosion, Houndoom, Magmortar, and Moltres can outspeed and KO Pinsir, especially if they are carrying a Choice Scarf, but if Pinsir is carrying a Choice Scarf of his own, they will have problems with Earthquake or Stone Edge. Similarly, Flying-types such as Scyther and Swellow can KO Pinsir with Aerial Ace or Brave Bird, but Stone Edge will destroy them. Rhyperior and Regirock can also beat Pinsir with Stone Edge, while Registeel can paralyze him with Thunder Wave, rendering him useless. Spiritomb and Dusclops can burn Pinsir with Will-O-Wisp, turning him into deadweight. Finally, Stealth Rock is Pinsir's biggest problem, since when the floating horror is on the field, Pinsir loses 25% of his health upon switching in, thus giving a lot of Pokemon the opportunity to OHKO him.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Pinsir's tremendous Attack stat by using Swords Dance to boost it to a whopping 698, which is enough to allow Pinsir to OHKO or 2HKO the entire metagame with his great coverage. X-Scissor is Pinsir's main attack, destroying almost every Pokemon who doesn't resist it. Close Combat hits Rock- and Steel-types for super effective damage, while Earthquake is also a viable option over Close Combat. Thanks to Mold Breaker, Earthquake even hits Pokemon with the ability Levitate, most importantly Rotom and Weezing, who would wall Pinsir otherwise. Close Combat is still usually the preferred option, as it's stronger and has a great chance of OHKOing 252 HP / 252 Def Impish Registeel after a Swords Dance boost (it always OHKOes after Stealth Rock damage if Registeel switches in on it). Finally, Stone Edge destroys Altaria, Articuno, and Moltres, who would otherwise wall Pinsir.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Pinsir's Attack and Speed. An Adamant nature can be used to give Pinsir more power, but Pinsir really needs the Jolly nature to outspeed base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Venusaur, Blaziken, and Kabutops. The choice of ability depends on the attacks you use. If you use Close Combat, Hyper Cutter is usually the better choice, since it makes Pinsir immune to Intimidate. If you use Earthquake, Mold Breaker is better as it allows Pinsir to attack Levitating foes with Earthquake. Mold Breaker is also viable without Earthquake, as it lets Pinsir hit Rhyperior harder with Close Combat, bypassing the aforementioned Pokemon's Solid Rock ability.</p> <p>It should be noted that this variant of Pinsir is easily revenge killed by Fire-types and Swellow. For this reason, a defensive Rock-type Pokemon, such as Regirock, is a great partner for this Pinsir, as it can beat most Fire- and Flying-type Pokemon due to his good defenses and access to STAB Stone Edge. Dugtrio is also a good teammate, as he can trap and KO Fire-, Rock-, and Steel-type foes who would otherwise cause problems for Pinsir. This set really appreciates paralysis support since it allows Pinsir to beat some powerful, fast sweepers who would otherwise stop him in his tracks. Bulky Fighting-types, such as Hitmontop and Hariyama, can put a sudden halt to Pinsir's sweep. Hariyama can to phaze Pinsir and remove his Swords Dance boosts. If Pinsir does not have the ability Hyper Cutter, then Hitmontop can Intimidate him and threaten with Stone Edge. As such, Psychic-types such as Uxie, Slowbro, and Espeon are great partners for Pinsir, as they can take care of those pesky Fighting-types with their STAB Psychic. Weezing and Spiritomb are also great choices, but Spiritomb must be wary of Foresight Hitmontop.</p>"

      "Attacking Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Pinsir can work as an effective anti-lead against many common UU leads by balancing considerable attack power with decent physical bulk and Speed. This set makes great use of one of the only moves not shared by Pinsir and his little brother Heracross: Stealth Rock. Although Stealth Rock is an important tool for almost all teams, in this set it takes a back seat to attempting to KO the opposing lead.</p> <p>X-Scissor is another move that Pinsir has that Heracross does not, and although it sacrifices a massive amount of power compared to Heracross's Megahorn, it boasts perfect accuracy, which is especially important at the start of the game. X-Scissor is very useful for Pinsir, allowing him to 2HKO Uxie and Mesprit while also scoring powerful hits on Alakazam, Ambipom, and Electrode. Alakazam and Electrode can then be disposed of with Quick Attack, the third competitive move that Heracross does not have. Unfortunately, Adamant X-Scissor + Quick Attack only has an average shot to 2HKO Ambipom, and Pinsir will also lose to Life Orb-boosted Fake Out + Return. Close Combat is another good tool for Pinsir to use, since it can easily OHKO Ambipom. It is also useful to hit Cloyster, Rhyperior, Registeel, and Steelix for super effective damage. However, it is illegal with Quick Attack, so you should think carefully before using it. Hence, Close Combat pairs well with Stone Edge to hit Flying- and Fire-types, and Quick Attack pairs well with Earthquake to beat Rock-, Steel-, and Poison-types.</p> <p>As Pinsir has many options for covering different threats, this set has a great deal of customizability. Generally speaking, a Jolly nature is most useful if you want to get Stealth Rock up reliably, as it allows you to outrun Modest Moltres, as well as Timid Venusaur and Mesprit, and also gives you more utility mid-game. However, an Adamant nature can also be useful in order to more easily obtain vital KOs against such bulky threats as Kabutops and Omastar. There are four moves that can be used in your two attacking move slots, and almost any combination of moves and nature is usable depending on the foes you wish to prioritize on beating.</p> <p>Stone Edge is effective against several Pokemon who wall Pinsir otherwise, most importantly Moltres. It is also a powerful weapon against Arcanine, usually OHKOing after Flare Blitz recoil, and can 2HKO suicide lead Cloyster. The only real problem with it is its low accuracy. Earthquake provides much of the same coverage as Close Combat, albeit with less power. However, it gives Pinsir a better chance than Close Combat at taking on some lesser-seen leads, such as Qwilfish, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen. Earthquake also has a lot of mid-game utility in hitting Rotom, Weezing, and Mismagius. However, it cannot 2HKO bulky Omastar with Leftovers. It is not advisable to use a combination of Close Combat + Earthquake due to overlapping coverage, and Close Combat + Quick Attack is illegal, but any other legal combination of these four moves is usable. However, any combination lacking Quick Attack is beaten by faster offensive leads such as Alakazam, any combination lacking Close Combat loses to dedicated Spikes leads such as bulky Omastar and Cloyster, any combination lacking Stone Edge loses to Moltres and other Flying-types, and any combination lacking Earthquake loses to Qwilfish and other Poison-types. Generally speaking, Jolly Pinsir should use Close Combat + Stone Edge as this provides the best balance between sheer power and coverage, and as such is most useful both early- and late-game. However, for an Adamant Pinsir, Earthquake + Quick Attack is usually better, since this allows Pinsir to better take advantage of its extra power. Lastly, although Close Combat is illegal with Quick Attack, Superpower is not, and can allow Pinsir to beat Kabutops with greater ease. However, it will leave him as setup fodder for just about everything else.</p> <p>Focus Sash is usually the best item, preventing Pinsir from being OHKOed by the likes of Moltres and Kabutops. Lum Berry can also be useful to avoid Uxie's Thunder Wave and Yawn. Mold Breaker is the most useful ability, though Hyper Cutter will negate Arcanine's Intimidate. The EVs and nature generate maximum Attack, allowing Pinsir to deal as much damage as possible to the opposing team. The Speed stat is also maximized, allowing him to outrun most lead Arcanine and Kabutops. The 4 leftover EVs go in Defense rather than in HP in order to give Pinsir five switches into Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Stealth Rock benefits all kinds of teams, but this Pinsir will usually work best on pure or bulky offense teams. You should also note that if Pinsir lacks Close Combat, bulky lead Omastar or Cloyster can set up two layers of Spikes against him, so you should also carry a Rapid Spinner. Rapid Spinners are also helpful to remove Stealth Rock from the field, which will badly hurt Pinsir if you save him for later in the battle. Good partners on offensive teams include Pokemon who benefit from early-game Stealth Rock, such as Blaziken and Venusaur. Neither of these enjoy taking the Rock-type attacks aimed at Pinsir though, so tread carefully. In an offensive role, Pinsir's greatest joy is in beating down slower Psychic- and Dark-types such as Slowbro and Uxie; thus, he makes a good partner to Fighting-types such as Hitmontop, who in return can Rapid Spin away Stealth Rock for Pinsir. Fast Psychic-types such as Alakazam also make good partners since they are able to strike down Fighting- and Poison-types. Lastly, bulky Water-types such as Milotic can be helpful to deal with Fire- and Rock-type Pokemon, as well as helping to some extent against Swellow and other fast Flying-types who give Pinsir problems.</p>"

      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>Pinsir makes good use of Choice items thanks to his great Attack and decent Speed stats, similarly to Choice Heracross in OU. X-Scissor is again Pinsir's STAB move of choice, hitting Psychic- and Grass-types such as Slowbro, Uxie, Tangrowth, and Leafeon extremely hard. Earthquake and Stone Edge form the infamous EdgeQuake combo, which gives Pinsir almost perfect coverage with only two moves. Earthquake benefits from Mold Breaker, as it negates Levitate. Finally, Close Combat hits Rock- and Steel-types, such as Registeel, Regirock, and Rhyperior, harder than Earthquake can, 2HKOing all of the aforementioned foes.</p> <p>Pinsir becomes much harder to revenge kill when holding a Choice Scarf, while a Choice Band makes him much more powerful. An Adamant nature is generally better when running Choice Scarf, while a Jolly nature is preferable when Choice Band is Pinsir's item. Jolly can also be used with Choice Scarf to outspeed base 80 Speed Choice Scarf users with a +Spe nature, such as Blaziken. As this set will be utilizing Earthquake, Mold Breaker is the main ability, but Hyper Cutter can be used instead to stop Intimidate from lowering Pinsir's Attack stat. Quick Attack can also be used, especially with Choice Band, as it allows Pinsir to hit frail sweepers such as Alakazam and Swellow quite hard before they manage to hit him. It's illegal with Close Combat, though.</p> <p>Rapid Spin support is mandatory for Pinsir, and this set is not an exception. Stealth Rock support is also important, as it facilitates Pinsir's job. Claydol, Kabutops, and Donphan can provide both quite reliably. Pokemon such as Blaziken, Primeape, Rhyperior, and Donphan who appreciate Choice Scarf Pinsir's ability to get rid of frail sweepers like Alakazam and Sceptile are good partners, too. With Rapid Spin support, using Scyther and Pinsir in the same team is a viable strategy, as they can both break down each other's counters pretty effectively. Scyther can OHKO the Fighting-type Pokemon who trouble Pinsir, while Pinsir has a very strong Close Combat to deal with Rock- and Steel-types.</p>"

  "Tauros": {
    "overview": "<p>In the first generation, Tauros was known as the \"King of RBY\"; however, due to severe changes in the game since, he now lingers in the lower tiers, where he faces stiff competition from his fellow Normal-type, Kangaskhan. While Kangaskhan has the ability to hit Ghost-types thanks to Scrappy, Tauros has higher Speed and Attack as well as Intimidate, which gives him more chances to switch into physical attacks and makes up for his lack of resistances. When used properly, Tauros can be a potent physical threat in UU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Body Slam can be used as another STAB option if you want to spread paralysis; an Adamant nature would work well with this move to compensate for the loss in power. Zen Headbutt can be used if you want to hit Weezing and Venusaur super effectively and potentially score a flinch, but it is very unreliable due to accuracy and type coverage issues. Surprisingly, Tauros has access to a slew of special moves, most notably Fire Blast, but his low Special Attack stat makes these moves completely useless. Tauros can run a defensive spread with a set of Rest / Sleep Talk / Return / Earthquake, but he ultimately has better things to do than absorb hits. Endeavor can also be spaced in on the Angry Bull set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Steelix, Rhyperior, Omastar, and to a lesser extent Registeel, can take Tauros's hits quite well and hit back with with their respective STAB moves. Defensive Ghost-types like Spiritomb, Rotom, and Mismagius make excellent switch-ins to Tauros as well since they are immune to Return and the latter two Earthquake. They can also cripple Tauros with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Without a Choice Band, Tangrowth and Slowbro can take on Tauros; Tangrowth can severely hurt him with Leaf Storm or cripple him with Sleep Powder or Stun Spore, while Slowbro can do the same with Thunder Wave. A defensive Donphan can take on Life Orb Tauros as well. Defensive Fighting-types like Hitmontop can weaken Tauros's physical hits with Intimidate and strike back with Close Combat or Mach Punch. A defensive Hariyama can take on Tauros who lack Choice Band and hit back with Force Palm, potentially paralyzing Tauros. If facing the Angry Bull set and Tauros's ability activates, your best bet would be to combat him with priority moves from Pokemon such as Hitmontop, Azumarill, or Absol; otherwise it's game over.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This Tauros variant is a standard offensive Normal-type. The basic premise of this set is to switch into weak physical attacks, and then choose the right move to use accordingly. Double-Edge is recommended with Choice Band in order to 2HKO sturdier physical walls such as Donphan, Slowbro, and Tangrowth; however, success is dependent on either an Adamant nature or entry hazard support. For example, a Jolly Choice Band-boosted Double-Edge will fall short of securing the 2HKO on Slowbro, dealing only 42.1% - 49.7%. However, with an Adamant nature, you have a much better chance of 2HKOing Slowbro, as Double-Edge will now deal 45.9% - 54.3%. Earthquake is a staple on this set, as it inflicts high damage to Steel- and Rock-types, who would otherwise wall Tauros.</p> <p>The choice in the third slot is between Return or Stone Edge. Return is generally more convenient if you opt to use Life Orb, since the recoil from both Life Orb and Double-Edge can spell doom for Tauros in only a matter of turns. However, Stone Edge is recommended with Choice Band to hit defensive Ice- and Flying-types such as Walrein, Staller Moltres, Altaria, and Articuno for higher damage. Finally, Payback allows Tauros to catch Ghost-types on the switch, OHKOing most of them. However, Pursuit is always an option if you want to trap and KO fleeing Ghost-types. Using Pursuit, however, is sometimes risky, and because of its weak Base Power, healthy Ghost-types can survive if they choose not to switch. They then can use Will-O-Wisp to render Tauros useless.</p> <p>There are two items to choose from: Choice Band and Life Orb. Choice Band is great in tandem with an Adamant nature as it allows Tauros to muscle his way through bulky physical walls such as Tangrowth, Donphan, and Slowbro. With Stealth Rock down, Tauros has a high chance of 2HKOing Slowbro and Donphan, and a small chance of 2HKOing Tangrowth. However, it's important to note that positive-natured Scyther and Mismagius will outpace Tauros if you opt to use an Adamant nature. On the other hand, if you're not looking to break specific walls, Life Orb lets Tauros fare better against offensive teams, as it allows him to switch moves accordingly.</p> <p>Steel- and Rock-types are major barricades to this set since they can easily switch into Tauros's STAB. Because of this, Torterra works exceptionally well alongside Tauros since he can check a good portion of the Rock- and Steel-types in the UU tier. If you want to maintain offensive pressure, Rock Polish Torterra is probably the best set to use. Dugtrio is another offensive partner to consider if you want to trap the aforementioned threats, though it's sometimes risky to switch into them due to Dugtrio's paper-thin defenses. A defensive Hitmontop with Intimidate and STAB Close Combat can fend off Tauros quite easily. Moltres can also mesh in quite well with Tauros since he can absorb Close Combat and threaten Hitmontop with Air Slash. Furthermore, Moltres can switch into a predicted Earthquake from Steel-types and Rhyperior and threaten them with Fire Blast and Hidden Power Grass, respectively.</p>"
      },
      "Anger Point": {
        "description": "<p>This seems like a fairly generic Substitute and boost Berry set, but there are some unique assets that make it more attractive on Tauros than others. Anger Point is a ridiculous ability if your opponent scores a critical hit on Tauros, and the idea here is to make that critical hit happen when Tauros is behind a Substitute; his Attack will then maximize, making him virtually unstoppable. This is a much more \"high risk, high return\" option compared to using Intimidate, but if you manage to pull it off, very little can stand up to Tauros's might. This is made much more effective with a Salac Berry, as it will allow Tauros to outspeed every relevant threat in UU.</p> <p>The moves are identical to the first set, providing Tauros with the best possible coverage. Unlike the first set though, Double-Edge's side effect is counterproductive for this type of strategy; therefore, Return is Tauros's main STAB move. Earthquake hits Rock- and Steel-types for super effective damage. Payback is more reliable than Stone Edge on this set to hit defensive Ghost-types, as everything that Stone Edge might have been used to hit previously is OHKOed by Tauros's +6 Return.</p> <p>Intimidate can be used as an alternative if you find relying on Anger Point too luck dependent. It also allows Tauros to safely set up Substitutes on weak physical attacks and helps keep physical threats in check late-game if Tauros becomes death fodder. However, doing this causes Tauros to lose his perk as a SubBerry user. Using Leftovers is an option as it also allows Tauros to make one more Substitute if you find the critical hit rate too low. Liechi Berry can be used as a backup in case Anger Point doesn't activate.</p> <p>Dugtrio is highly recommended to pair alongside this set, even more so than with the first, since Steelix can repeatedly use Roar to completely foil Tauros's strategy. As mentioned in the All-Out Attacker set, Dugtrio's paper-thin defenses makes it difficult to switch him in; therefore, pairing it with a solid U-turn user like Uxie would work well. Tauros is nearly impossible to stop if Anger Point is activated; however, should his ability not activate, Tauros may become more of a liability. To ensure Tauros's ability activates, pairing him with a Wish user such as Leafeon or Clefable is highly recommended. Tauros also highly dislikes status effects, so using him alongside a Heal Bell user such as Chansey or Altaria can prove to be useful as well.</p>"

  "Lapras": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Lapras seems inferior to the UU Water-types due to its Ice typing, but it has a couple of useful traits that it can utilize well. Its high HP and Special Defense make it an excellent counter to common UU Water-types such as Milotic and Omastar. Lapras's Stealth Rock weakness may seem disappointing, but this is balanced by the ability to heal itself with Water Absorb, which allows Lapras to switch into any Water-type move and heal a quarter of its health. Due to Lapras's wide movepool, it can be used as a sweeper or as a supporter. This versatility gives the opponent a tough time at predicting what role Lapras plays on its team. These traits also make Lapras a reliable check to common Rain Dance teams thanks to Water Absorb, its 4x resistance to Ice-type moves, access to Thunderbolt, and its mammoth HP stat. All in all, Lapras should not be underestimated.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lapras has a great variety of moves not listed on the above sets due to the lack of moveslots. Body Slam can be used on the Dragon Dance set if you wish to abuse the 30% paralysis rate, though Return is probably better due to its higher Base Power. Confuse Ray is a risky option, but deals huge damage to an incoming Choice Band user if it hits itself. Icy Wind is an option for overcoming Lapras's average Speed, though the low Base Power can be a turn off. Rain Dance alongside Thunder and Hydro Pump is an excellent offensive option for Lapras. It can also support other teammates who have abilities that benefit from the rain, Water-type attacks, and Thunder. With Rain Dance, a Damp Rock can be used to prolong the rain, or a Life Orb can be used to deal more damage. Sing is an option on the Special Attacker set, though the low accuracy makes it unreliable. Finally, Hidden Power Grass can be used to hit Quagsire, who is immune to Thunderbolt and Water-type moves due to its Water Absorb ability.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Lanturn is the best all-around counter to Lapras, as it can switch in on Thunderbolt thanks to Volt Absorb and takes little damage from either of Lapras's STAB attacks. It can then proceed to hit Lapras with an STAB Thunderbolt or cripple it with Toxic. Venusaur can also easily switch in on any move barring Ice Beam or Avalanche and threaten Lapras with a super effective Grass-type attack or Sleep Powder. It also benefits from Lapras's huge HP stat, as it will recover more health with Leech Seed. Venusaur's ability to absorb Toxic Spikes is useful as well.</p> <p>Chansey can counter special attacking sets with ease, though it should beware of any physical or mixed sets due to its lower Defense stat. Natural Cure lets Chansey laugh at Lapras's Toxic all day. It can then cripple Lapras with Toxic or Thunder Wave and attempt to weaken Lapras with Seismic Toss. Clefable makes an excellent counter with Encore, which allows it to foil Lapras if it decides to set up with Dragon Dance or Curse. With its high defensive stats, Clefable can switch in on unboosted attacks with little trouble, while Magic Guard will prevent poison damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set focuses on Lapras's excellent defensive stats and the ability to hit many UU threats with its great type coverage. Surf, Ice Beam, and Thunderbolt together hit every Pokemon in the UU tier for neutral damage (barring Lanturn and Shedinja). The final slot brings a support move to the set, allowing Lapras to heal its team or cripple an opponent.</p> <p>The choice between Surf and Hydro Pump depends on whether you prefer power or accuracy. Hydro Pump is recommended if you wish to play more offensively. For example, with Life Orb equipped, Hydro Pump scores OHKOs on both Nidoqueen and Absol, which Surf cannot do. In the second slot, Ice Beam strikes Pokemon such as Venusaur and Altaria for major damage. To round off the coverage, Thunderbolt hits helpless Water-types such as Milotic and Blastoise for super effective damage. Finally, the last slot depends on what role you wish Lapras to fulfill. Toxic allows it to wear down walls such as Lanturn and Chansey, Perish Song allows Lapras to force switches when it is faced with an unfavorable match up, and Heal Bell allows it to support its teammates by removing crippling status.</p> <p>252 HP and 56 Special Defense EVs ensure that Lapras will never be 2HKOed by Hidden Power Grass or Electric from Gorebyss and Omastar, even if they hold a Life Orb. The remaining EVs give Lapras great offensive power and type coverage. If you wish to play more offensively, you may move 52 EVs from HP into Special Attack and have Lapras hold a Life Orb, though this carries the risk of being 2HKOed by the previously mentioned Gorebyss and Omastar.</p> <p>As with any special sweeper, Lapras has trouble with Chansey. Toxic and Perish Song may work for a limited time, but by then, Chansey will have crippled Lapras with Toxic or Thunder Wave. Powerful physical attackers, such as Hitmonlee and Hitmontop, are excellent choices to deal with Chansey; both Pokemon are able to batter it with super effective STAB Fighting-type moves. Hitmontop is also an effective Rapid Spin user, which is helpful due to Lapras's Ice typing. Dugtrio is another option, as it can trap both Chansey and Clefable with Arena Trap and 2HKO them with Earthquake, though Clefable needs to have taken prior damage to ensure this.</p> <p>Venusaur causes problems for this set as it can switch in on any move (barring Ice Beam) and threaten Lapras with a super effective Grass-type move or Sleep Powder. RestTalk Arcanine makes an excellent check to Venusaur as it can absorb status, while also hitting Venusaur super effectively with Flare Blitz. Altaria with RestTalk is another option who is capable of switching into all of Venusaur's moves. Sleep Talk allows it to set up Dragon Dance boosts or hit Venusaur with a powerful Outrage.</p>"
      },
      "LapDance (Dragon Dance)": {
        "description": "<p>On this set, Dragon Dance is used in order to raise Lapras's average Attack and Speed stats into much higher degrees. Lapras makes an excellent Dragon Dance user thanks to its respectable defenses and Water Absorb ability, giving it numerous opportunities to switch in and boost its stats.</p> <p>A combination of Waterfall and Return provides near-perfect type coverage in UU, with Shedinja being the only Pokemon who is immune to both moves. Zen Headbutt is an option if you need Lapras to hit Weezing and Fighting-types such as Poliwrath or Toxicroak harder. However, if you leave out Return, Slowbro will cause problems. Substitute grants Lapras safety from crippling status moves, but Ice Beam, although being a special attack, will hit Grass-types for more damage than any of Lapras's other physical options.</p> <p>224 Speed EVs give Lapras 212 Speed, which allows it to outrun base 95 Pokemon with a positive nature, such as Drapion and Houndoom, after a single Dragon Dance boost. Maximum Attack EVs allow it to deal as much damage as possible. The remaining EVs are placed into HP, giving Lapras more bulk while also allowing Lapras to create Substitutes bigger than 101 HP. This requires Chansey to use Seismic Toss twice before Lapras's Substitute breaks.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types cause this set problems as Lapras is unable to hit them super effectively. Grass-types, most notably Venusaur, are good teammates as they can hit Water-type Pokemon for super effective damage with their STAB Grass-type attacks or cripple them with status or Leech Seed. Venusaur is an outstanding candidate because of its great bulk and diverse movepool.</p>"

      "Mixed Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>This set functions as a wallbreaker; with Lapras's above-average offensive stats and great type coverage, it is capable of removing some of UU's most troublesome walls, including Steelix and Chansey. This set also utilizes Dragon Dance, which boosts Lapras's Speed and Attack, and turns it into a powerful sweeper.</p> <p>Dragon Dance gives Lapras a great boost in power and the Speed to outrun common UU threats such as Drapion and Houndoom. The choice of which physical move to pick depends on your personal preference: use Waterfall for flinch rate and power, or use Return to damage Water-types. With 64 Special Attack EVs and a Life Orb, Hydro Pump gives Lapras a chance to OHKO the most defensive Steelix with Spikes support, while also dealing huge damage to Donphan and Weezing. The final slot depends on whether you wish to hit Grass-types super effectively with Ice Beam, or if you want Lapras to hit Water-types with Thunderbolt. Thunderbolt is recommended if you use Waterfall as your physical option.</p> <p>The EVs on this set ensure that Lapras is able to OHKO most defensive Steelix with Hydro Pump and Spikes support. 224 Speed EVs allow Lapras to outrun positive nature base 95 Pokemon after a single Dragon Dance, including Leafeon and Houndoom, who are OHKOed by Ice Beam and Hydro Pump, respectively.</p> <ul> <li>64 SpA Naughty Lapras + Life Orb Hydro Pump vs 252 HP / 252 SpD Careful Steelix = 84.7% = 100%</li> <li>64 SpA Naughty Lapras + Life Orb Hydro Pump vs 252 HP / 0 SpD Impish Arcanine = 99% = 117.2%</li> <li>64 SpA Naughty Lapras + Life Orb Hydro Pump vs 52 HP / 0 SpD Adamant Donphan = 142.5% - 168.9%</li> <li>64 SpA Naughty Lapras + Life Orb Hydro Pump vs 252 HP / 0 SpD Bold Weezing = 63.2% - 74.9%</li> <li>64 SpA Naughty Lapras + Life Orb Ice Beam vs 0 HP / 0 SpD Jolly Venusaur = 84.4% = 99.7%</li> <li>220 Atk Naughty Lapras + Life Orb +1 Return vs 0 HP / 252 Def Calm Chansey = 58.5% = 69%</li> <li>220 Atk Naughty Lapras + Life Orb +1 Waterfall vs 0 HP / 252 Def Calm Chansey = 68.8% = 81.1%</li> </ul> <p>This set isn't easy to counter after a Dragon Dance or two; however, bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Milotic cause trouble for this set if Lapras lacks Thunderbolt, due to their massive physical defense stats. Venusaur comes in handy here as it can hit them super effectively with Grass-type moves or Sleep Powder. Lanturn is one of Lapras's biggest problems thanks to its mammoth HP stat and ability to switch in on any Water-, Ice-, or Electric-type move. Support from Toxic Spikes can cripple Lanturn as it lacks a reliable recovery move. Drapion is an option as it can prevent Lanturn's Thunder Wave by using Taunt, and can set up Toxic Spikes or phaze the opponent's team with Whirlwind. For a more offensive approach, Venusaur can hit Lanturn with STAB Leaf Storm or Power Whip, while Dugtrio can switch in on Thunderbolt and trap Lanturn with Arena Trap.</p> <p>If Lapras lacks Ice Beam, Venusaur can switch in on Hydro Pump or Return and threaten Lapras with Sleep Powder or a super effective Grass-type move. RestTalk Arcanine is an excellent check to Venusaur as it can absorb status while also dishing out huge damage with Flare Blitz. Altaria also makes a fine RestTalk user due to its high defensive stats and great typing. Natural Cure also helps Altaria remove its own status upon switching out.</p>"
      },
      "Curse": {
        "description": "<p>Lapras's huge HP and respectable Special Defense stats make it an ideal Curse user. Curse allows Lapras to boost its Attack and Defense stats at the cost of lowering its Speed, which turns it into a monstrous tank who is difficult to remove without landing a critical hit or leeching its health with Toxic or a burn.</p> <p>Ice Shard works great with Curse as its priority will negate the drop in Speed. Avalanche is another option, as it doubles in power by moving last, which Lapras will almost always be doing after a Speed drop. Waterfall is a strong STAB attack that will deal huge damage to any Pokemon without a resistance or immunity after a few boosts from Curse. Return provides excellent type coverage alongside Waterfall, while Rest allows Lapras to fully restore its health and remove harmful status. Using a Chesto Berry with Rest is a good option as it wakes Lapras up instantly.</p> <p>An alternative set of Avalanche, Curse, Rest, and Sleep Talk is viable, as it gives Lapras the ability to recover its health and absorb status effectively. Sleep Talk is helpful to ensure that Lapras isn't wasting the two turns of sleep, and is instead using them as an opportunity to raise its stats further with Curse or attack with a boosted Avalanche.</p> <p>The EVs on this set give Lapras the highest possible special bulk. Maximum HP also gives Lapras a Leftovers number. 252 Special Defense EVs allow Lapras to withstand powerful specially-based hits, even those that are super effective. The remaining EVs are placed into Attack, giving Lapras a little more offensive power. Critical hits are a problem to this set as they will overcome any boosts from Curse and deal huge damage to Lapras. This is where Shell Armor, which protects Lapras from any critical hits, comes in handy. However, Water Absorb is usually the preferred ability, allowing Lapras to restore 25% of its health and come in freely on Water-type attacks, which can sometimes be a more reliable form of healing than Rest.</p> <p>As this set is designed to stick around as long as possible, support from Toxic Spikes is recommended, as it allows Lapras to stall opponents, such as Lanturn, who it cannot damage sufficiently. Drapion is an excellent option as it has access to various support moves such as Taunt, Whirlwind, and Knock Off which allow it to cripple the opponent's team and set up for Lapras at the same time. To keep these hazards on the field, a way to block Rapid Spin is necessary; Spiritomb is a great defensive option, while Calm Mind or Nasty Plot Mismagius is the preferred option if you'd like an offensively oriented Pokemon to block Rapid Spin.</p> <p>Lapras has major problems when faced with a Fighting-type opponent such as Hitmonlee or Hitmontop. Spiritomb is an ideal partner for Lapras as it can switch into a predicted Close Combat and threaten physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp. Uxie is another option as it takes little damage from physical attacks and can cripple the opponent with Thunder Wave or Yawn.</p>"

  "Flareon": {
    "overview": "<p>Flareon is often considered one of the weaker 'Eeveelutions' due to his bad Defense, HP, and Speed; lack of strong physical STAB despite his high Attack stat; and Stealth Rock weakness thanks to his Fire typing. However, even with all these drawbacks, Flareon can still perform some niche roles with his high Special Defense and access to Wish. Flareon is not 2HKOed by most bulky Water-types and is a great counter to specially-offensive Grass-types and Moltres (without Toxic), which allows him ample opportunities to support his teammates with Wish while attempting to stall out the opponent.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flareon's movepool is shallow but he still has some options. Yawn can be used to force the opponent out under the threat of sleep. A Life Orb boosted mixed attacker set with Superpower / Fire Blast / Return / Hidden Power Grass may be used for breaking down walls such as Clefable and Steelix, but is outclassed by Magmortar and Blaziken as they are faster and hit harder. Quick Attack provides priority, but with no STAB and weak Base Power, Return is almost always a better option. Will-O-Wisp burns physical attackers such as Azumarill and Rhyperior who want to hit Flareon on his weaker Defense stat, but Lava Plume still has a good 30% chance to burn switch-ins. You can use Fire Fang and a Careful nature on the Wish set since Flareon's Attack is higher than its Special Attack; this allows Flareon to hit Chansey and specially-defensive Pokemon such as Registeel harder, but with the low Base Power of Fire Fang and high Defense stats of other counters such as Rhyperior and Donphan, it is a lesser option. Iron Tail damages Rock-types and doesn't lower Flareon's Attack and Defense like Superpower does but it has no real use outside of that. Flareon can use Heal Bell but it's hard to give up one of his other moves and there are better choices for clerics such as Chansey and Clefable. Roar is good for shuffling the opponent's team around and stopping stat-uppers.</p> <p>A Choice Band set lets Flareon hit harder but again is outclassed since Flareon has no good physical STAB outside of Fire Fang. Choice Specs runs off Flareon's lower Special Attack stat, but Overheat can dent any Pokemon who doesn't resist it. A Baton Pass set with Wish, Lava Plume, and either Substitute or Curse could be useful, but Flareon has no real opportunities to set up and is outclassed by Blaziken, who has access to Agility and Swords Dance. For more Speed, 140 EVs with a neutral nature allow Flareon to outspeed 4 Speed Milotic and Venusaur, while 168 EVs outspeed 0 Speed Base 85s. However, it is almost always more useful to invest in Flareon's defenses as he already outspeeds some slower walls like Slowbro who don't invest in Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Most Rock- and Ground-types are counters to sets without Hidden Power Grass or Superpower but they need to watch out for a burn from Lava Plume. Bulky Water-types can be outstalled by the standard set but are good counters to the offensive sets. Although not as common, more offensive Water-types such as Calm Mind Slowbro and Life Orb Milotic can 2HKO Flareon with Surf or even OHKO with Hydro Pump. RestTalkers, such as Spiritomb, can just Rest off the poison and stall Flareon out.</p> <p>Flareon is suspect to all forms of entry hazards and has many weaknesses to common types, such as Ground and Water, so getting Stealth Rock and Spikes on the field will severely limit his lifespan.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wish Support": {
        "description": "<p>This is something that Fire-types like Blaziken and Houndoom can't do. Flareon's job is to keep his team healthy with Wish and stall enemies such as Chansey and even Milotic out with a combination of Wish, Protect, and Toxic. He can also counter common threats such as offensive Moltres, special Venusaur, Sceptile, Arcanine (special and bulky sets without Toxic), Rotom, and Alakazam. The basic idea is to switch Flareon in on a Pokemon he can force out, such as Sceptile, and proceed to use Wish as it switches out. When the opponent reveals their Flareon counter, he is free to switch to the appropriate teammate who can tank the incoming hit and then regain health from Flareon's Wish. Protect allows Flareon to heal himself with Wish and also stall for Toxic damage. Lava Plume keeps physical attackers from switching in freely as they risk a burn, while Flamethrower has more Base Power and a lower burn rate, which may be more beneficial when dealing with bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Slowbro as the burn grants them immunity to Toxic.</p> <p>The EVs ensure that 0 SpA Milotic, one of the most powerful bulky Water-types, never 2HKOes Flareon with Surf when factoring in Leftovers. They also let him take some physical attacks such as Arcanine's Extreme Speed, mixed Blaziken's Life Orb Superpower, and unboosted Life Orb Venusaur's Earthquake.</p> <p>As Flareon's Defense is nothing to write home about, a defensive Ground-type such as Donphan or Claydol is a good teammate to take the Rock- and Ground-type attacks aimed at Flareon. Fighting-types like Hariyama and Hitmontop can also take Rock attacks and don't have a shared Water weakness. A Water-type such as Milotic is also a good partner to combat Fire-types who Flareon can't handle, such as Blaziken. Milotic also checks most Ground- and Rock-types, such as Rhyperior. Since Flareon can outstall bulky Water-types and troublesome walls, Pokemon who love having these out of the way like Azumarill, Feraligatr, and Sceptile, are also good partners.</p> <p>Flareon is weak to Stealth Rock, so Rapid Spin support is valuable. Donphan and Claydol are again good choices as they can spin Stealth Rock and Spikes away and also lay Stealth Rock down themselves. Blastoise can take the Water-type attacks that Flareon can't take, such as Azumarill's Waterfall. In return, Flareon's Wish lets Blastoise last longer to spin. Hitmontop can take Rock-type attacks and spin against Ghost-types thanks to Foresight.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Although Flareon is often shunned in favor of faster Fire-types such as Magmortar and Blaziken, it can boost its offensive potential by holding a Choice Scarf to overcome its middling Speed, allowing it to outspeed all non-boosted Pokemon in the metagame bar Electrode and Swellow. Flareon's offensive stats ensure that it can tear through opposing teams, while its base 110 Special Defense stat gives Flareon much needed bulk, a trait that other Fire-types like Houndoom lack. Fire Blast is Flareon's STAB move of choice, defeating bothersome Pokemon such as Sceptile with ease. Return deals neutral damage to many UU Pokemon, while Superpower punishes Rock-types such as Rhyperior and Aggron hoping to switch into a predicted Fire Blast or Return. Hidden Power Grass rounds out the set, providing valuable coverage against difficult Pokemon like Quagsire, who would otherwise threaten Flareon easily with Toxic and Earthquake.</p> <p>Toxic may be used over Hidden Power Grass or Return to cripple bulky Pokemon like Milotic; however, this takes away from Flareon's coverage, which may often prove deadly in battles. Lava Plume may be used over Fire Blast if one is concerned about physical attackers such as Hitmontop, but Flareon almost always needs Fire Blast's power more than Lava Plume's burn rate. A purely physical or special Choice Scarf set is also possible, but Flareon's physical movepool is sorely limited, and the power of Flareon's special attacks leave much to be desired. The EV spread allows Flareon to outspeed base 120s with a positive nature while augmenting Flareon's offensive stats, but a more offensively oriented EV spread may be used. This is discouraged, however, as Flareon loses the ability to outrun Pokemon such as Alakazam and Sceptile, an advantage that many teams appreciate.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Flareon does have a number of problems, even with the Speed boost. Milotic's bulk and access to Recover allows it to stall and eventually defeat Flareon, although it does not appreciate a surprise Toxic. Arcanine can also switch into any of Flareon's attacks with ease and threaten Flareon's weaker Defense stat, but it too fears Toxic. Swellow can outspeed and revenge kill Flareon easily, and Mismagius's immunity to Normal- and Fighting-type moves allows it to switch into Return and Superpower and set up. To deal with these threats, Donphan makes a good partner, thanks to its ability to take physical attacks with ease, provide Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin support, and defeat many of Flareon's counters. Leafeon can provide Wish and Heal Bell support while taking physical hits aimed at Flareon, as well as eliminating Rock- and Ground-types in Flareon's way. Additionally, it lures in Fire-type attacks for its fiery-hearted kin to switch into, allowing Flareon to take advantage of the opponent's misprediction. Milotic's bulk and offensive power also makes it an excellent partner, defeating many of Flareon's counters while using Recover to heal off damage.</p>"

  "Omastar": {
    "overview": "<p>In spite of facing stiff competition from other bulky Water-types, namely Milotic, Blastoise, and Azumarill, Omastar can still hold its own. Omastar is the only Pokemon in UU capable of setting up both Stealth Rock and Spikes, which has turned our little prehistoric friend into a staple on stall teams. Furthermore, Omastar's base 115 Special Attack and access to Swift Swim allows it to function as a fearsome rain sweeper that is capable of plowing through teams in a matter of turns.</p> <p>Omastar is not without its fair share of faults, however. Its awful defensive typing, which grants it weaknesses to Ground-, Fighting-, Electric-, and Grass-type attacks; low Special Defense; and lack of a reliable recovery move are major drawbacks that severely hinder Omastar's durability. Despite these disadvantages, do not underestimate Omastar, as it can run (or slide...) circles around unprepared teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Omastar doesn't have many viable options outside of those that have already been mentioned. Toxic Spikes can be used on the Support set either over Spikes or in the fourth slot, but Spikes tends to be the superior option given the amount of Poison-types in UU that render Toxic Spikes useless, and Omastar becomes severely overloaded if it decides to employ all three entry hazards. Hidden Power Rock gets STAB and can be used on the fourth slot of the Support set as well, but offers inferior coverage when compared to Ice Beam and Earth Power, and doesn't hit anything worthwhile. Omastar also has access to Haze in order to shut down stat boosters, but it is more suited for attacking due to its great Special Attack, and its inability to take on Calm Mind users further diminishes Haze's usefulness on Omastar.</p> <p>Offensively, Omastar can make use of a Choice Specs set in order to hit common switch-ins harder, most notably 2HKOing Chansey with Hydro Pump 100% of the time if Stealth Rock is down and rain is in play. If one doesn't want to rely on Rain Dance to boost Omastar's Speed, Rock Polish can be used, which has the advantage of not wearing off after eight turns like rain does. However, without the boost from weather, Omastar will fail to OHKO several threats with Surf and will need to waste a turn boosting its own Speed rather than having it augmented by any other Pokemon that carries Rain Dance.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Although it's one of Omastar's greatest allies, Ludicolo also happens to be one of the most reliable counters to the snail. Ludicolo's typing, access to Swift Swim, and superior Speed guarantee that not only will it not take much damage from any of Omastar's attacks, but it also has the option of outspeeding and OHKOing Omastar before Omastar even has a chance to move. Milotic is another great option, as it can shrug off two consecutive super effective Hidden Power Grasses and OHKO Omastar in return with a Hidden Power Grass of its own. Specially defensive Venusaur, despite being unable to take two consecutive Ice Beams, can easily switch into Surf or Hidden Power Grass, take the subsequent Ice Beam, and OHKO Omastar with Energy Ball. Chansey is a complete roadblock for offensive sets, but turns into complete fodder for defensive sets to lay down entry hazards against.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Although Omastar's typing isn't very auspicious for a defensive Pokemon, one would be foolish to overlook its gargantuan base 125 Defense stat that, when paired with its access to a wide array of support moves, turns Omastar into an amazing asset for defensive teams. The main idea of this set is to switch into something that doesn't threaten Omastar too much, such as physically-based Flying-, Normal-, or Fire-types, then proceed to set up either Spikes or Stealth Rock as the opponent switches out. If they decide to stay in, Omastar can make use of its impressive Special Attack and STAB Surf to crush most of these threats.</p> <p>The last moveslot is entirely dependent on personal preference. Ice Beam is the most desirable option, as it deters Grass-types from switching in too readily and deals massive damage to Flying-types, especially Altaria. However, if one doesn't find the aforementioned Pokemon too troublesome, Earth Power is an interesting option that enables Omastar to hit Toxicroak, Qwilfish, and opposing Omastar harder; it especially comes in handy if this set is being run in the lead position, where the latter two are commonly seen. Alternatively, Rest is a viable option that rectifies Omastar's lack of a recovery move, but should only be used with Heal Bell support.</p> <p>Because Omastar's ability to set up all kinds of entry hazards is what makes this set so dangerous, pairing it with a Ghost-type in order to block Rapid Spin is mandatory. Given the defensive nature of this set, RestTalk Rotom is the most advisable choice for the role, as it can easily switch into most Fighting- and Ground-types that threaten Omastar and scare them away with Will-O-Wisp. Bulky Mismagius is another good option, as, despite not having very high defenses, it has access to Taunt, which shuts down Foresight users such as Blastoise and Hitmontop. Chansey is another great partner, as it can provide Omastar with Wish support, heal any harmful status inflicted on its teammates with Aromatherapy, and take on the majority of the special attackers in the tier. Venusaur possesses resistances to Grass-, Electric-, and Fighting-type attacks, has access to Roar, and is capable of luring Flying- and Fire-types out, thus giving Omastar many free opportunities to switch in.</p>"
      },
      "Rain Dance Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Due to bearing the highest Special Attack of all Water-types in UU and an underwhelming 55 base Speed, Omastar makes a prime candidate for a Rain Dance sweeper. Surf is Omastar's main source of damage, and OHKOes most Pokemon that don't resist it. If more power is desired, Hydro Pump is a good alternative that puts more pressure on bulky special walls such as Clefable and Registeel, even 2HKOing Chansey with Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes down. Ice Beam allows Omastar to hit Grass-types and Altaria for super effective damage, while Hidden Power Grass is used mainly for Water-types. Because these three moves provide Omastar with amazing coverage (only resisted by Shedinja), Omastar can afford to run a support move in the fourth slot. Rain Dance is the preferred option, as it allows Omastar to act as a self-sustaining sweeper on all sorts of teams while supporting its teammates on dedicated rain teams. Earth Power, despite not achieving much when it comes to coverage, allows Omastar to OHKO Toxicroak, one of the most dangerous threats to rain teams, thus paving the way for one of its teammates, namely Kabutops or Qwilfish, to sweep unhindered.</p> <p>Omastar has a much easier time sweeping when bulky Water-types and Chansey are removed from play, which means having a reliable switch-in to these Pokemon is mandatory. Ludicolo immediately sticks out due to its secondary Grass typing, ability to run a physical set, good Special Defense, and access to Swift Swim; these factors combine to allow Ludicolo to get past a good portion of the aforementioned threats. Swords Dance Qwilfish, despite not being able to switch into any of those Pokemon for free, is a great bait for Milotic and Venusaur, and can use Explosion to remove a troublesome wall from the game. Registeel is another thorn in Omastar's side, as it can easily shrug off a hit and paralyze Omastar, rendering it useless. Because of this, Lanturn makes a nifty partner, soaking up Thunder Wave, thanks to Volt Absorb, and being able to abuse rain with its STAB Thunder while also reliably replenishing the rain with its respectable bulk.</p> <p>The most efficient kind of support one can provide Omastar with is pairing it with Pokemon that can set up Rain Dance prior to its entrance on the battlefield. This makes it so that Omastar doesn't have to take a hit when attempting to set up or abdicate the boost provided by Life Orb in order to use Damp Rock, which would cause Omastar to miss key OHKOs on Pokemon such as offensive Venusaur. Uxie is the most recommended partner, as it can set up Stealth Rock, counter Toxicroak and Technician Hitmontop, both of which are huge hindrances to many commonly used rain sweepers, and heal Omastar from status with Heal Bell. Mesprit is in the same boat, but trades bulk and access to Heal Bell for the ability to use Healing Wish, which can essentially give Omastar a second life. Because of its blistering Speed, Electrode makes an extremely reliable Rain Dance user in the lead position, thus helping Omastar establish offensive momentum early on in the battle.</p>"
      },
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Omastar is blessed as the only UU Pokemon with access to both Stealth Rock and Spikes; coupled with its decent bulk and high Special Attack, this makes Omastar an excellent lead for any UU team in need of entry hazards. This Omastar is built to function as a suicide lead, setting up as many entry hazards as possible before fainting. If an opportunity arises where Omastar can KO the opponent's Pokemon, it should do so; having an immediate advantage against the opposing team while still having a chance to set up entry hazards can be invaluable. Omastar matches up well against almost any common lead, including Uxie and Mesprit without Grass Knot, Registeel, Moltres, Kabutops, Cloyster, other Omastar, and even Rain Dance Electrode, which Omastar can simply outspeed and OHKO with Surf in the rain. With so many favorable match-ups and a Focus Sash, Omastar should be guaranteed either a kill or two layers of entry hazards.</p> <p>Stealth Rock and Spikes are both key to this set. Putting both moves on Omastar can not only free up an extra slot on your team, but it also gives Omastar a chance to set up multiple layers of hazards if it finds itself in a favorable lead matchup. Omastar's typing, decent Speed, and high defensive stats allow it to set up easily on any Pokemon that is not carrying a Grass-type attack, such as Registeel or Spiritomb (although stronger versions of Shadow Ball Spiritomb can deal serious amounts of damage to Omastar). Surf is a reliable STAB attack that can OHKO Moltres leads and deal significant damage to almost any other lead; even Qwilfish leads take over 40% from Omastar's Surf. The last attack is based on preference, and depends on what Pokemon you would rather have Omastar be able to defeat. Hidden Power Grass can OHKO opposing Omastar that do not run Focus Sash or Rindo Berry, and also ensures that Omastar can outspeed and 2HKO Cloyster with ease. Earth Power allows Omastar to easily handle Toxicroak leads, as well as guaranteeing the 2HKO on Qwilfish.</p> <p>It may seem silly to maximize Speed on such a slow Pokemon, but the extra Speed will often prove invaluable. Not only does it give Omastar a good chance to outspeed and kill any opposing Omastar leads, but it also allows Omastar to outpace leads such as Cloyster or Kabutops if they do not invest in Speed. Even Uxie, a Pokemon with base 95 Speed, will be outsped by Omastar if it runs no Speed EVs. However, if running so much Speed doesn't sound alluring, alternative EV spreads that feature max HP and some Defense EVs can be used very effectively, especially if combined with Rindo Berry. A bulkier spread allows Omastar to take even special hits extremely well, easily tanking attacks such as Spiritomb's assaults or weaker Grass Knots; many of these attacks now become 3HKOs or even 4HKOs. A team looking to use Omastar should highly consider these spreads, as Omastar can easily switch in later to wall attacks as well as to set up more entry hazards.</p> <p>With Omastar carrying both Stealth Rock and Spikes, a Ghost-type to block Rapid Spin is almost mandatory, especially if Omastar plans on going down early. In fact, it may even be wise to use two Ghost-types to prevent Foresight-using Rapid Spinners from doing their job. Offensively, special sweepers such as Moltres have a much easier time with Chansey and Milotic after they've been damaged by Stealth Rock and Spikes. Choice Banders, such as Tauros, also benefit from Pokemon being weakened upon switching in; repeated hits and entry hazard damage will quickly take a toll on any potential counters. Defensively, a team built around using Roar and Whirlwind to rack up entry hazard damage can find many advantages to using this Omastar lead.</p> <p>Although Omastar has a favorable match-up versus most leads, it can be stopped by Taunt and has problems with any Grass-type attack. Mismagius is perhaps the most dangerous threat Omastar can face, as it has access to Taunt, a high Special Defense stat, and a super effective Thunderbolt. Alakazam is another lead that severely troubles Omastar, given its higher Speed and ability to 2HKO the snail with Psychic. Despite running the risk of being 2HKOed, Ambipom and Qwilfish can use Taunt in order to prevent Omastar from setting up.</p>"

  "Kabutops": {
    "overview": "<p>Kabutops packs quite a punch (or... slash) with dual STAB on Water and Rock, a combination resisted by only a handful of Pokemon. With its STAB Aqua Tail, backed by Swords Dance, Life Orb, and rain, Kabutops can march through anything that does not resist Water, and it can deal with just about everything else with STAB Stone Edge. Kabutops is almost impossible to revenge kill as well--thanks to Swift Swim, Kabutops's Speed doubles in the rain, and it has STAB Aqua Jet to deter common priority users such as Blaziken, Hitmontop, and Absol. Kabutops can also function well outside of rain, as its base 80 Speed is relatively high even without a boost. If Kabutops gains a free turn, it is almost guaranteed at least one kill, especially under rain. One would do well not to underestimate it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Waterfall and Aqua Tail are the competing STAB Water-type moves on all sets, and both have their own advantages and disadvantages. Waterfall's primary advantages are its 20% flinch rate and 100% accuracy. The increased accuracy means that Waterfall is much more reliable on frailer opponents that both Waterfall and Aqua Tail will KO anyway. However, Kabutops will need Stealth Rock support to ensure the guaranteed OHKOs under rain on Miltank, Hitmontop, Weezing, and Registeel on the Swords Dance set with Waterfall, whereas it is not needed with Aqua Tail. The difference in power becomes much more apparent on the Choice Band set. For example, under rain Aqua Tail has a 90% chance (due to accuracy) to OHKO 252 HP / 252 Defense Impish Hitmontop after Intimidate, whereas Waterfall only has a 51% chance, even with the possibility of a flinch. It is up to you to make the choice between power and reliability.</p> <p>A +2 Aqua Tail, even in rain, has only a minuscule chance to OHKO max HP/max Defense Impish Registeel. Low Kick is therefore an option,as it will always OHKO the Steel-type behemoth with a Swords Dance boost. Natural Gift and a Liechi Berry provides an 80 Base Power Grass-type attack to maim Quagsire with. A Lum Berry can be handy on the Swords Dance set, so Kabutops's sweep isn't ruined by paralysis or burn. This is especially useful against the likes of Weezing and Uxie. Lastly, Kabutops can set up Rain Dance itself, but it generally needs the moveslot more than other Rain Dance sweepers such as Gorebyss, Omastar, or Ludicolo.</p> <p>With the exception of the Support set, Kabutops should always max out Attack. For the Swords Dance set, 242 Speed (184 EVs, Adamant) is the recommended minimum to outrun positive base 60 Speed Pokemon. Kabutops can also aim for 250 (216 EVs) and 256 (240 EVs) Speed to beat Adamant Absol and Feraligatr, respectively. Kabutops can also run max Speed to tie with other base 80s, such as Gardevoir and Altaria. If you are supporting Kabutops with rain, 136 Speed EVs is probably the minimum amount of Speed you should invest. Those EVs give Kabutops a Speed stat of 230, which beats Timid Scarf Moltres in the rain. Other useful investments are 144 EVs, for Timid Scarf Rotom and 168 EVs, for Scarfed +nature base 95s.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Under rain, there isn't much that can stop Swords Dance Kabutops without relying on a low damage roll or a Stone Edge miss. Quagsire and Poliwrath are the best options; they 2HKO Kabutops with Earthquake and Brick Break, respectively, and Kabutops's +2 Stone Edge only musters a 3HKO on max HP/max Defense Quagsire and Poliwrath. However, both must be wary of Return, which will always 2HKO after a Swords Dance. Slowbro and Tangrowth take massive damage from a boosted Stone Edge or X-Scissor but will survive both attacks and OHKO Kabutops with Grass Knot or Power Whip. Both must invest heavily in HP and Defense to do so, though.</p> <p>In the absence of rain, Kabutops is a bit easier to stop, as many Pokemon are no longer KOed by a boosted Aqua Tail or Waterfall. Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Intimidate Hitmontop can take any of Kabutops's assaults and OHKO with powerful STAB attacks. Registeel, Miltank, and Uxie can cripple Kabutops with Thunder Wave. Milotic cannot take a boosted Stone Edge, but in the absence of Swords Dance can cripple Kabutops with Surf or Hidden Power Grass. Offensive variants can also switch in on Swords Dance, outrun Kabutops, and OHKO it with Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p>When the skies are clear, a lack of Speed will also hurt Kabutops. Toxicroak can switch in on any move, outspeed Kabutops, and KO with Cross Chop. Venusaur works in the same manner, although it must take care not to switch in on Stone Edge, especially not one boosted by Choice Band.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>With Swords Dance to back up those great STAB moves and that impressive Attack stat, this version of Kabutops can be a devastating sweeper. Stone Edge and Aqua Tail provide superb coverage, only resisted by Toxicroak, Poliwrath, and Quagsire in UU. Waterfall is a deadly, reliable STAB move that carries a potential flinch chance, and it is the primary option for Kabutops's main STAB move. However, Aqua Tail becomes noticeably more powerful in the rain, where a Swords Dance boosted Aqua Tail OHKOes Miltank, Hitmontop, and Weezing, as well as Registeel and Uxie most of the time. A Swords Dance and Life Orb boosted Aqua Jet is a very potent weapon and can OHKO many fast but frail sweepers, such as Blaziken, Nidoking, Houndoom, and Hitmonlee.</p> <p>If you want some more coverage on Kabutops, you can swap Aqua Jet for one of several coverage moves, though this is not recommended since Aqua Jet's safeguard against priority is far more valuable than covering certain niche Pokemon. X-Scissor is perhaps the most notable option to deal slightly more damage to two of Kabutops's deadliest foes--Slowbro and Tangrowth--although it barely out-damages STAB Stone Edge and will not come close to OHKOing either without a lot of previous damage. On the other hand, Return will 2HKO Poliwrath and Quagsire after a Swords Dance, both of whom Kabutops cannot beat otherwise.</p> <p>There are two separate sets here: Standard and Rain Dance. In both cases, maximizing Kabutops's Attack stat should be your first priority. If you are not running rain, Kabutops needs maximum Speed to at worst tie with other base 80 Speed Pokemon, such as Venusaur, Mesprit, Blaziken, and Altaria. Waterfall should also be used with this set due to its reliability. However, if you are running a Rain Dance team, an Adamant nature and Aqua Tail are preferable for the greater damage output, which guarantees the death of such threats as Uxie and Registeel. Alternatively, you can try a bulkier spread of 112 HP / 248 Atk / 148 Spe, which gives Kabutops a much easier time setting up on physical threats such as Swellow and Arcanine when rain is not up, while still enabling it to beat Choice Scarf Rotom in the rain.</p> <p>If not running Rain Dance on your team, you should note that Kabutops is much easier to stop. Kabutops's greatest threats are bulky Water-, Grass-, and Fighting-types. Thus, Venusaur makes an excellent partner to Kabutops, as it resists the STAB attacks of all those types and can hit back with its own STAB moves; Slowbro and Tangrowth are both OHKOed by special sets. Drapion is another option, as it too can deal with Tangrowth and can also trap Slowbro with STAB Pursuit. Bulkier versions are also helpful, as they can use Whirlwind to rack up residual damage. Both Drapion and Venusaur can also absorb Toxic Spikes. Lastly, strong Fire-types such as Thunder Fang Arcanine and Passho Berry Houndoom can bait out and weaken Water-types, allowing Kabutops to overpower them later on. Fire-types, particularly Moltres, can also break down Grass- and Fighting-types.</p> <p>While Swords Dance Kabutops is fully capable of being used as a standalone sweeper, it truly excels on a Rain Dance team. Electrode is the fastest Rain Dance lead in the game and is guaranteed to set it up. As for other teammates, Uxie is extremely reliable at setting up Rain Dance and can also set up Stealth Rock, Reflect, and Light Screen to aid in Kabutops's sweep. It can also grant Kabutops a free switch with Memento and is a good stop to Toxicroak. Entry hazards are also helpful for Kabutops's sweep and can be set up by Pokemon such as Registeel and Uxie, both of whom also have access to Rain Dance. Below are some damage calculations to show off Kabutops's potentiel.</p> <ul> <li>+2 Aqua Tail in rain vs. 252/252+ Uxie: 97.5% - 114.7%</li> <li>+1 Aqua Tail in rain vs. 252/252+ Hitmontop: 105.9% - 124.7%</li> <li>+2 Aqua Tail in rain vs. 252/252+ Weezing: 109% - 128.7%</li> <li>+2 Aqua Tail in rain vs. 252/224+ Miltank: 103.8% - 122.6%</li> <li>+2 Aqua Tail in rain vs. 252/0 Registeel: 109.9% - 129.7%</li> <li>+2 Aqua Tail in rain vs. 252/0 Venusaur: 91.8% - 108%</li> <li>+2 Stone Edge vs. 252/0 Leafeon: 91.6% - 107.8%</li> <li>+2 Stone Edge vs. 248/252+ Milotic: 91.1% - 107.6%</li> <li>+2 Stone Edge vs. 0/0 Toxicroak: 98.7% - 116.3%</li> <li>+2 Aqua Jet in rain vs. 252/0 Hitmontop: 87.2% - 103%</li> <li>+2 Aqua Jet in rain vs. 4/0 Hitmonlee: 175.2% - 207%</li> </ul> <p>One problem with Rain Dance is its limited duration. Therefore, there are two ways to use this Kabutops in the rain. The first is to bring it in early and break your opponent's team, while relying on other rain sweepers to clean up afterward, and the other is to whittle down your opponent's team with the relentless pressure of other rain sweepers, bringing in Kabutops to take down anything left standing. On this note, Ludicolo is an excellent partner to Kabutops for its ability to frighten away Tangrowth, Slowbro, and Milotic. Qwilfish can also break the opponent's team--by setting up Swords Dance and threatening a sweep, the opponent may be forced to sacrifice their bulky Water-type to Qwilfish's Explosion. Alternatively, it can also set up Spikes. On the special side, Gorebyss and Omastar are the most potent teammates. Gorebyss is indifferent to the priority moves that plague Kabutops and has Psychic to get rid of Toxicroak and Poliwrath; however, Omastar is faster and hits slightly harder.</p>"

      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Moderate defensive ability and great attacking power make Kabutops a reliable lead. One of its main selling points is its ability to almost always be able to set up Stealth Rock at the beginning of the match. The most common Taunt lead, Ambipom, cannot touch Kabutops with its STAB moves and takes heavy damage in return, though you must beware of variants with Low Kick.</p> <p>Stone Edge is a solid attacking choice that will OHKO Moltres and 2HKO Cloyster, Qwilfish, Mesprit, and Spiritomb. A Stone Edge combined with an Aqua Jet will finish off Intimidate Arcanine and Ambipom. Aqua Jet will also handle the occasional Focus Sash lead such as Alakazam, as well as giving Kabutops the ability to revenge kill some Pokemon like Blaziken later in the game. The final slot is not as important as the first two. Rapid Spin is really what differentiates Kabutops from other suicide leads--with it, Kabutops can stop Omastar from setting up more than one layer of Spikes and get rid of the opposing lead's Stealth Rock. On the other hand, Waterfall is a solid and reliable STAB choice that doesn't have Stone Edge's accuracy issues. However, its only real use is on Hippopotas and Nidoqueen, and the utility from Rapid Spin is usually more valuable for a lead.</p> <p>Lum Berry will enable Kabutops to beat the Venusaur leads who try to put it to sleep on the first turn. It will also allow Kabutops to set up Stealth Rock on Uxie without fear of Thunder Wave or Yawn. On the other hand, Focus Sash will ensure that Kabutops will survive Alakazam's Focus Blast or Moltres's Hidden Power Grass and KO both of them with Stone Edge. It will also provide some security against Arcanine; no longer will you have to worry if it is carrying Hidden Power Grass. Bear in mind that outside of a critical hit, however, Kabutops will not beat it, because Arcanine's higher Speed means that it will Extreme Speed Kabutops before Kabutops can Aqua Jet. The 132 HP EVs allow Kabutops to survive Life Orb Ambipom's Fake Out + Low Kick, and either attack back with Stone Edge or set up Stealth Rock. Attack is then maximized, and the remaining EVs are placed in Speed, which allows Kabutops to outrun 0 Speed Uxie.</p> <p>As good as Kabutops is, there are a number of common leads who can cause it trouble, such as Uxie and Mesprit. Standard support Uxie is 4HKOed by Stone Edge at best when factoring in Leftovers, while Mesprit is 2HKOed by Stone Edge but is still faster and can set up Stealth Rock before escaping with U-turn. Both also have the potential to do serious damage to Kabutops with Thunderbolt or Grass Knot. Absol and Drapion are immune to Psychic and can either trap the pixies with Pursuit or set up with Swords Dance. These Pokemon will also be helpful in removing Ghost-types who block Kabutops's Rapid Spin.</p> <p>If Kabutops does not carry Rapid Spin, it has trouble with other entry hazard leads. While Cloyster and Qwilfish are 2HKOed by Stone Edge, bulky Omastar is one of Kabutops's worst match-ups; Kabutops can only 4HKO through Leftovers, while Omastar can set up Spikes and Stealth Rock or 2HKO Kabutops with Surf. Offensively inclined Omastar can be 2HKOed by Stone Edge, but can OHKO back with Hidden Power Grass. Thus, if your Kabutops does not have Rapid Spin, you should consider investing in another Rapid Spinner, such as Blastoise. You should also consider Ghost-type support in order to maintain your own Stealth Rock on the field.</p> <p>When facing a lead such as Ambipom or Alakazam, prediction is key. If you manage to predict a Taunt, Kabutops can use the turn to strike back with Stone Edge, finishing both off on the subsequent turn with Aqua Jet. Theoretically, the most advisable move is to attack first, since regardless of whether they Taunt or not, Kabutops will still 'win' the match-up. However, on teams where Stealth Rock is immensely important, such as overtly offensive teams, getting Stealth Rock down regardless of Kabutops's sacrifice should be your priority. The decision will usually boil down to the team you are running alongside Kabutops, and whose presence your team will benefit most from--Kabutops's or Stealth Rock's. If your team has the momentum to recover, Stealth Rock is important enough to warrant starting on the back foot, provided you have the means to make the most of it.</p>"

      "Offensive Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<p>The attributes that make Kabutops a successful sweeper--namely, a stellar base 115 Attack and excellent attacking STAB--also make him a great Rapid Spinner. One of the difficulties entailed in Rapid Spinning is eliminating the Ghost-types who switch in to block Rapid Spin, and while most other UU spinners are walled by common spinblockers, Kabutops can hit every Ghost in the UU tier for solid, neutral damage with his STAB Stone Edge. Offensive Ghost-types such as Rotom and Mismagius are KOed by a combination of Stone Edge and Aqua Jet, and even the most defensive Spiritomb is 2HKOed by a +2 Stone Edge. In most cases, an opponent will have to risk losing a Pokemon to Kabutops in order to successfully preserve his or her entry hazards.</p> <p>Stone Edge is Kabutops's strongest STAB option and is therefore absolutely necessary on this set. Aqua Jet provides excellent additional coverage and is invaluable as a priority move. In addition to finishing off weakened Mismagius and Rotom, Aqua Jet protects Kabutops from Dugtrio and allows Kabutops to pick off weakened or frail Pokemon such as Houndoom. Swords Dance enables Kabutops to beat Dusclops and Spiritomb, who will otherwise drain all of Stone Edge's PP with Pressure. It also lets Kabutops threaten a sweep and prevents other defensive Pokemon such as Milotic from walling him. Waterfall is not as useful without rain support, but it is an option over Swords Dance to hit the likes of Rhyperior, Steelix, and Donphan.</p> <p>Attack is maximized so that Kabutops can hit Ghost switch-ins as hard as possible, making spinning easier. With a Jolly nature and 252 Speed EVs, Kabutops ties with other +Speed nature base 80s, including Venusaur, Blaziken, and Mesprit, which can be important when trying to sustain a sweep. If one does not wish to risk a tie with these Pokemon, there are a few lower benchmarks that can be aimed for instead. With a Jolly nature and a spread of 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe, Kabutops outruns max Speed, +Speed nature base 70s, such as Cloyster and Ludicolo. With an Adamant nature and a spread of 132 HP / 252 Atk / 124 Spe, Kabutops outpaces base 95s who lack Speed investment, such as Uxie. It is possible to go lower than this, although it is not advisable. Kabutops should be able to definitively outrun most Milotic, allowing him to perform a last-ditch Rapid Spin before being KOed should the need arise.</p> <p>While it may be hard to switch in on Kabutops, it is considerably more difficult for him to switch in than it is for other Rapid Spinners. It is easiest to get Kabutops in after a KO or on a double switch, especially on a Pokemon such as Swellow whom Kabutops can easily threaten and force out. Outside of that, offensively weak Pokemon, including Chansey, Clefable, and Miltank, as well as Fire- and Ice-types who lack super effective coverage moves, such as Arcanine (without Hidden Power Grass) and Articuno, are Kabutops's best opportunities to switch in.</p> <p>Kabutops is an excellent partner to any Pokemon in dire need of Rapid Spin support. Moltres is a notable example, capable of luring in Chansey, whom Kabutops can switch in on and threaten out, and forcing out many of the Pokemon who give Kabutops trouble, including Registeel, Donphan, Hitmontop, and Venusaur. Scyther also makes a good partner, as he can deal with Venusaur and Hitmontop as well as lure in Arcanine. Scyther can also be paired with Dugtrio in order to immediately get rid of Registeel--who walls both Kabutops and Scyther--by U-turning to Dugtrio as Registeel switches in. Dugtrio also traps and KOes Toxicroak, another Pokemon Kabutops struggles against.</p> <p>While Kabutops can handle all of UU's spinblockers by himself, doing so requires accurate prediction, not to mention relying on Stone Edge's shaky accuracy. In order to ease prediction (or cushion the blow of a Stone Edge miss), Pursuit Spiritomb can be used alongside Kabutops to trap and KO (or severely damage) most Ghost-types. Spiritomb also handles most Fighting-types, who are prone to switching in on Kabutops, especially if he has yet to Swords Dance.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Kabutops's mediocre typing and Speed ensure that it will have a difficult time setting up on most of the metagame. A Choice Band set tries to amend these problems. Stone Edge will make Venusaur think twice about switching in, as those without any investment in Defense take 95% minimum. Kabutops's main Water-typed attack will score a super effective hit on most Ground-types trying to switch in on Stone Edge. Aqua Jet enables Kabutops to revenge kill faster, weakened Pokemon such as Arcanine and Houndoom. For its final moveslot, Return gives a nice neutral attack that has the added advantage of being able to hit Toxicroak, Poliwrath, and Quagsire.</p> <p>There are a couple of options in the last slot if you don't want to go with Return. Rapid Spin is a useful option, as common spinblockers such as Mismagius and Spiritomb would be suicidal to try to switch in on something as powerful as Choice Band Kabutops, allowing it to get a surprise Rapid Spin off without much difficulty; however, this does mean that Kabutops will be locked into a weak attack, giving your opponent a very good opportunity to turn the tables on you. Superpower is another option that hits Registeel for more damage, but lowers Kabutops's stats, leaving it very vulnerable. Another point that merits a mention is an alternative, faster EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Speed with a Jolly nature, which enables you to tie with all other positive base 80 Speed Pokemon, most importantly Venusaur and Blaziken.</p> <p>Kabutops is likely to run into far more obstacles with this set than with the Swords Dance set due to the loss of power and the inability to switch moves, particularly because it cannot switch to Aqua Jet to ward off revenge killers. Thus, you should play this set to its advantages, namely its ability to hit hard off the bat and impressive STAB coverage. These factors lend themselves more to a wallbreaker or cleaner than to a sweeper. You should consider carefully whether you want your whole team to benefit or to focus your efforts around one sweeper. Choice Band Kabutops tends to draw in Water- and Grass-types, who resist its primary STAB. Standard Tangrowth and Slowbro are both taking around 40-45% damage on average from Stone Edge, whereupon Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Arcanine can take advantage of them. Steel- and Fighting-types, such as Registeel and Hariyama, will also be worn down by repeated attacks, which can be good for sweepers such as Absol. Entry hazards such as Stealth Rock accentuate this weakening process, so make sure to include them on your team.</p> <p>There are a number of solo sweepers who work well with Kabutops. Swords Dance Scyther and Nasty Plot Mismagius are good examples of fast boosting sweepers, while Swellow and Alakazam represent frail but potent late-game cleaners. On Rain Dance teams, specially inclined cleaners include Omastar and Gorebyss, both of whom have enough power to muscle through a weakened team with STAB Hydro Pump backed by the rain. If you want a physical sweeper to take advantage of Kabutops's weakening of physical walls, however, Swords Dance Ludicolo or Qwilfish are two of the best options.</p>"
      },
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Being weak to the ever popular Close Combat and Earthquake means that Kabutops's good Defense stat is somewhat wasted. In fact, you are better off specializing in Special Defense and running Sand Stream to capitalize on Kabutops's resistances to Ice and Fire, as well as improving its ability to take Surf from bulky Water-types.</p> <p>This Kabutops can act as a pretty decent Rapid Spinner, mainly because of surprise factor. Pokemon like Venusaur and Hitmontop are more often the first switch-ins to Kabutops than Ghost-types like Spiritomb. Also, once your opponent catches on to the set, Kabutops can remove the spinblocker's Leftovers with a well-timed Knock Off, which, combined with sandstorm support, will significantly decrease its longevity. Stealth Rock is also a support option, but Hippopotas, the only Sand Stream Pokemon in UU, has access to it anyway. If you are using Kabutops outside of sandstorm, however, Stealth Rock is usually a better option than Knock Off for support.</p> <p>In order to take resisted attacks better, this Kabutops should maximize its Special Defense stat. Since sandstorm gives Kabutops a 1.5x Special Defense boost, it will gain the most possible stat points this way. After that, some HP EVs are recommended, not only to increase the overall Special Defense but also to improve Kabutops's ability to take hits from physical threats such as Arcanine and Swellow. A minimum of 52 HP EVs will ensure that Jolly Swellow's Guts-boosted Facade cannot 2HKO, and 200 EVs may be used so that Facade will never 2HKO with Stealth Rock factored in. Heavier investment does not serve any particular purpose but will also allow Kabutops to survive unexpected attacks such as Life Orb Arcanine's Thunder Fang. The remaining EVs should be used to buff Kabutops's respectable Attack.</p> <p>Hippopotas is almost essential in order to activate sandstorm, which is necessary if you want to make Kabutops's special bulk worth using. However, this can cause the rest of your team to suffer if they are not immune to sandstorm, as the residual damage can wear them down quite quickly. Bulky Grass-types have the greatest type synergy with Kabutops. Venusaur has reasonable special bulk and can take Electric-, Grass-, and Fighting-type attacks aimed at Kabutops with ease, while in return Kabutops can switch in on Fire-, Ice-, and Flying-type attacks. Both can also cause heavy damage to the Ground-types that trouble them with their super effective STAB moves. Venusaur can also spread status, absorb Toxic Spikes, and deal with Slowbro and Tangrowth, two of the biggest threats to Kabutops.</p> <p>Rapid Spin support is extremely helpful to those weak to Stealth Rock, such as Moltres and Scyther. They and other sweepers also benefit from the Stealth Rock and Knock Off support Kabutops provides. To compound the residual damage, dedicated Spikers such as Omastar are useful, as well as Toxic Spikers such as Drapion. Drapion is also a useful teammate since it, like Venusaur, can absorb Toxic Spikes and beat down Slowbro and Tangrowth, as well as stopping Ghost-types who try to block Rapid Spin, and shuffling with Whirlwind.</p>"

  "Dragonair": {
    "overview": "<p>Dragonair is often overlooked in UU due to its mediocre stats and NFE status; however, it does have a few strong points. In addition to the sheer power of STAB Outrage, Dragonair has a very impressive movepool, which makes up for Dragonair's not-so-great offensive attributes. The dragon snake is also a great choice for teams that need a wallbreaking partner or late-game sweeper. Access to a priority attack in Extreme Speed, combined with the fact that Dragonair lacks a 4x weakness to Ice-type attacks, gives it advantages over Altaria and Gabite. Overall, Dragonair's excellent type coverage, powerful STAB attacks, many resistances, and lack of a Stealth Rock weakness make it a powerful Pokemon that should not be underestimated.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dragonair has been blessed with a huge movepool. However, most of its viable options are limited due to its poor stats. Dragon Rush is an option if you dislike the prospect of being locked into Outrage for several turns, though its inferior power and accuracy are unattractive. Return has little reason to be considered, as it has poor coverage alongside Outrage. While many players think of Dragonair as a physical sweeper, it actually has an extensive special movepool. Fire Blast can be used on a special or mixed set, and it is the only way Dragonair can take on Registeel. Dragonair also learns Surf and Thunderbolt, the former annihilating Rock-types such as Rhyperior, as well as dealing with Fire-types, while the latter can hit Water-type Pokemon for serious damage, landing a 2HKO on Milotic after Stealth Rock damage (considering maximum EV investment). Draco Meteor is Dragonair's strongest attack, capable of picking off physical walls, as well as denting almost anything that does not resist it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Cloyster is one of the best counters to Dragonair thanks to its impressive physical bulk and STAB Ice-type attacks. Bulky Pokemon such as Milotic and Omastar can 2HKO Dragonair with Ice Beam, and can take a boosted Outrage pretty well. Registeel resists every attack Dragonair commonly carries bar Aqua Tail and Fire Blast, which the former will not deal much damage after a boost, and can temporarily hinder Dragonair with Thunder Wave and proceed to finish it off with Ice Punch or Iron Head. Slowbro falls in the same category, able to take repeated attacks and beating Dragonair with STAB Psychic, or Ice Beam. Due to Donphan's sheer bulk and great Attack, it can easily take boosted hits and finish off Dragonair with a combination of Earthquake and Ice Shard. Torterra can take a boosted hit or two and retaliate with STAB Earthquake. Weezing, despite not resisting Outrage, has the physical bulk to take several hits and can temporarily cripple Dragonair with Will-O-Wisp.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Despite its impressive movepool, Dragonair cannot successfully utilize many of its potential moves due to its mediocre stats, which is typical for a NFE Pokemon. Nevertheless, its access to Dragon Dance allows Dragonair to function as a moderately powerful physical sweeper. Additionally, unlike other sweepers, Dragonair does not fear getting inflicted with status thanks to its awesome ability, Shed Skin.</p> <p>After a single Dragon Dance, Dragonair hits a respectable 341 Speed, outspeeding everything up to positive-natured base 105s, a large majority of the UU metagame. Although there are Pokemon that outspeed Dragonair even after a Dragon Dance boost, such as Dugtrio and Alakazam, they are also fragile enough to be taken down by a boosted Extreme Speed. As stated above, Extreme Speed is one of the biggest reasons to consider Dragonair over the other Dragon-types in UU; it not only allows it to revenge kill weakened, faster threats, but also to protect itself from priority revenge kills after it has set up a Dragon Dance or two. Outrage is Dragonair's most reliable physical STAB move, since Dragon Rush's poor accuracy can cause a potential sweep to go astray, not to mention the vital extra power that Outrage provides. Aqua Tail has almost unresisted coverage alongside Outrage, and helps Dragonair deal with bulky Ground- and Steel-types, hitting the likes of Registeel for neutral damage. One of the primary reasons Aqua Tail is used over Waterfall is that it can OHKO 140 HP / 0 Def Rhyperior after Stealth Rock, something Waterfall can only very rarely accomplish.</p> <p>The EV spread is tailored to outspeed specific Pokemon, as well as giving Dragonair maximum power. 204 Speed EVs with an Adamant nature allows Dragonair to outspeed and crush the likes of Mismagius and Scyther after a single Dragon Dance boost. If 341 Speed is not sufficient for you, a Jolly nature combined with 232 Speed EVs allow Dragonair to outrun even positive-natured base 125 Speed Pokemon after a Dragon Dance, though Dragonair will miss out on the power provided by the listed EV spread.</p> <p>Due to Dragonair's mediocre offensive stats, entry hazard support is greatly appreciated. Omastar and Qwilfish have good synergy with Dragonair, and can set up multiple entry hazards. Donphan shares an Ice-type weakness with the dragon snake, but it still makes a good teammate due to its ability to set up Stealth Rock, as well as utilize Rapid Spin to remove them from your side. Donphan can also deal with Steel-types that would otherwise trouble Dragonair, such as Registeel, with its powerful STAB Earthquake. Venusaur is another great teammate for Dragonair, as it can put opposing Pokemon to sleep, thereby granting Dragonair a safe switch-in (and possibly a few turns to set up). Dragonair's defensive stats are mediocre at best, so finding time to set up is quite a task. Dragonair can set up against Chansey and Clefable, due to Seismic Toss being the main form of offense for the aforementioned Pokemon. Non-offensive Spiritomb are good set-up bait as well, since Shadow Sneak and Will-O-Wisp won't be doing much to Dragonair. Paralysis support is also invaluable, as Dragonair finds it much easier to set up and sweep when the opposing team is crippled thus. Uxie and Chansey have access to Thunder Wave, and are bulky enough to reliably utilize it throughout the match, as well as absorb powerful physical and special attacks aimed at Dragonair, respectively.</p>"

  "Furret": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Furret looks like a mediocre Pokemon in competitive play due to its mediocre stats and Normal typing, which prevent it from proving to be a 'real' offensive or defensive threat in the UU tier. However, its stats are just sufficient enough to allow it to exploit its considerably wide movepool, letting it fill a niche as a revenge killer or, to an extent, a late-game wallbreaker, among other things. Due to the number of options it has, Furret is versatile and unpredictable, but its lack of firepower is a huge setback, as, without high offensive stats, Furret cannot function properly in the roles it has the movepool to play with.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Unfortunately for Furret, outside of using a Choice item, there's really not much else it can hope to accomplish in the UU environment, due to the fact that its lacking base stats and mediocre offensive and defensive prowess hold it back tremendously. Super Fang and Toxic can be used, but they're highly outclassed, as Return is almost always the better option when compared to Super Fang, and it makes minimal sense to be running Toxic on such a frail Pokemon. It should be noted that Furret does have access to Baton Pass, but has basically nothing to Baton Pass other than Amnesia, Defense Curl, and Focus Energy, all of which are basically useless in a competitive environment. Lastly, Furret can run a special attacking set due to the massive special movepool it has but unfortunately, it only has a base 45 Special Attack stat to try to abuse its movepool with.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Due to the lack of firepower Furret has, anything significantly bulky will be able to wall this ferret all day; examples of such Pokemon include Uxie, Rhyperior, Steelix, Registeel, and Regirock as they all are all significantly bulky on the physical side. Also, bulky Water-types, such as Slowbro and Milotic, along with bulky Grass-type Pokemon, particularly Tangrowth, will be able to wall Furret and even set up on it. However, Cloyster must beware of switching into a Brick Break, as offensive variants of Cloyster can be 2HKOed by a Choice Band-boosted Brick Break. Registeel also falls into the same vein as Cloyster. Lastly, Pokemon such as Hitmontop and Blaziken can easily remove Furret from a battle due to their access to the priority Fighting-type attacks, Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, respectively; Hitmontop gets a special mention as not only can it defeat Furret through Mach Punch, it can also Intimidate Furret, and since Hitmontop is quite bulky, even set up on Furret.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>Due to Furret's lacking base stats, utilizing a Choice item is the best bet it has in playing an offensive role on any UU team, as the boosts granted are absolutely necessary in order to allow Furret to present any kind of offensive threat whatsoever. By using a Choice Scarf, Furret becomes a great scout courtesy of its access to U-turn; also, by using a Choice Scarf, Furret functions nicely as a revenge killer due to its passable Speed stat and nice coverage among its attacking options. However, with a Choice Band, Furret becomes a decent late-game wallbreaker as it can abuse its respectable base 76 Attack stat and decent attacking options, as well as shutting down defensive cores through Tricking a Choice Band onto a wall such as Chansey.</p> <p>The given EVs are quite straightforward. They are designed to maximize Furret's offensive capabilities by maximizing Attack and Speed while chucking the leftovers in HP. Trick is utterly necessary on this set as it allows Furret to shut down defensive Pokemon such as Registeel which hate being locked into a single move; Return is a reliable STAB attack, while Brick Break is chosen for coverage purposes. The choice for the last move depends on your personal preference, as although Shadow Claw and Sucker Punch help considerably with Furret's move coverage, U-turn in combination with a Choice Scarf makes Furret a great scout Pokemon.</p> <p>Since it is evident that Furret will struggle against bulky opponents such as Uxie and Regirock due to its lackluster base Attack stat even with a Choice Band, Pokemon that can counter or remove them would prove to be excellent partners to Furret. Also, as bulky Psychic-types will be problematic for Furret locked into anything but Shadow Claw--which, even so, barely 3HKOes the standard support Uxie--it may be wise to pack a strong Pursuit user on your team, such as Absol or Spiritomb. Lastly, setup sweepers such as Swellow are great offensive partners to Furret, as they take advantage of the holes Furret creates in the opposing team, as well as the offensive momentum Furret builds up.</p>"

You have some of the worst attacking stats of all fully evolved Pokemon, arguably the worst typing in the game, and abilities that do little to help you. At least your movepool, Special Defense, and Speed are decent, but that's not enough to save you from being in the same laughing stock realm as Luvdisc and Farfetch'd.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute, Light Screen, and Knock Off round out Ledian's other support options. Substitute is useful to protect Ledian from status and can be used to bring Ledian's health down low enough to activate a pinch berry. Using Substitute and a pinch berry is very risky, however, and usually means Ledian only has one shot to pull off a successful pass. Light Screen can be used in the lead position in place of Swords Dance to give teammates such as Rhyperior or Octillery a much needed boost in Special Defense. Knock Off is always useful to rid a wall, such as Milotic, of Leftovers, or a sweeper, such as Alakazam, of Life Orb. Ledian has moves like Bug Buzz, Aerial Ace, Mach Punch, Double-Edge, and Focus Blast for attacking options, but he is too weak to use them effectively, even with potential boosts from Choice Specs or Swarm.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Anything with Taunt will immediately end Ledian's fun, especially leads like Electrode, Alakazam, and Ambipom. Haze Milotic will also put an immediate stop to Ledian's Baton Passing games and force him to switch to a teammate to eliminate her. Roar and Whirlwind are another big problem for Ledian; however, be warned, as Ledian may be passing to Octillery or Cradily, both of whom are immune to phazing. Any non-resisted physical attack will easily KO Ledian as well.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is Ledian's biggest enemy, stripping him of half of his health and decreasing his survivability. The problem is, in most cases, Ledian will be banking on the opposition to use Stealth Rock on turn one to allow him to Encore it and proceed to safely use Swords Dance or Baton Pass. So, when facing Ledian, the best bet may be to delay setting up Stealth Rock and instead attack Ledian outright to ensure he won't be able to pull off his strategy.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>Ledian has all the right moves he needs to be a great Baton Passer or even an adequate lead. Encore is the selling point of this set, and allows Ledian to separate himself from his fellow Bug-type Baton Passers. The main idea when using Ledian is to switch into an attack that poses little to no threat, Encore it, use either Agility or Swords Dance as the opponent switches out, and Baton Pass out to the appropriate teammate. Unfortunately, Ledian's lack of an attacking move on this set means he is utterly dismantled by Taunt; however, Ledian's Attack stat is pitiful and he wouldn't be damaging much anyway. When considering Ledian for a slot on your team, it is important to realize that he is only improving your team of five with Agility and Swords Dance boosts--like an accessory--and that your team should be able to function without Ledian.</p> <p>The EVs maximize Ledian's surprisingly good special bulk while giving him max Speed to ensure he outspeeds the omnipresent base 80s that riddle the UU metagame. When using Ledian, the best attacks for him to switch in on are non-damaging moves or Grass-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks. Ledian should then proceed to Encore the move, use Agility or Swords Dance as the opposing Pokemon switches out, and Baton Pass to the appropriate teammate when the opponent's switch-in is revealed. All of this switching can quickly deplete Ledian's health, especially if Stealth Rock is in play, so Roost can be used in place of Swords Dance to increase Ledian's longevity.</p> <p>If considering Ledian for the lead position, it is important to remember that he will be forced out immediately by half of the most commonly used leads in the metagame. Examples of leads that immediately force out Ledian are: Ambipom, Alakazam, Moltres, Arcanine, Snover, and any Pokemon with Taunt. Losing against all of these leads may seem overwhelming, but Ledian is perfectly capable of setting up on the half not mentioned. Against any other lead, the best idea is to Agility on turn one. This way, Ledian is able to outspeed the other lead and Encore whatever they used on the first turn. After Ledian has successfully Encored their first move, he is free to use Swords Dance as they switch out. After they have revealed their switch-in, Ledian can then Baton Pass to the appropriate teammate. The item choice in the lead position can vary. Lum Berry is the most useful as it protects Ledian from one turn of status, allowing him to pass at least the Agility he used on the first turn to the appropriate teammate. Focus Sash can be used to protect Ledian from Stone Edge or Fire Blast from leads such as Pinsir, Moltres, or Nidoking, but these leads are rare, so most times Lum Berry will prove more useful.</p> <p>Because Ledian will be passing Agility and Swords Dance boosts, the best teammates are those that can capitalize on said boosts and cover Ledian's weaknesses. One of the best partners for Ledian is Rhyperior. Rhyperior can easily switch into the Fire-, Rock-, Electric-, and Flying-type attacks that Ledian will encounter, is a great immediate switch-in to Ambipom if using Ledian in the lead position, and really enjoys the boosts Ledian provides. In turn, Ledian can easily switch into the Ground-, Fighting-, Water-, and Grass-type attacks that plague Rhyperior. They both share an Ice-type weakness, but it is an uncommon attacking type in the UU metagame. Other good teammates include those that cannot be phazed out, such as Octillery or Cradily. If using Ledian in the lead position, Pokemon that can switch in immediately into Alakazam or Mismagius, such as Spiritomb or Absol, make good teammates as well. Thanks to Ledian's ability, Early Bird, and the Lum Berry, he can also Agility on the first turn against sleep-inducing leads such as Venomoth or Venusaur, Swords Dance and absorb the sleep the next turn, and have an increased chance of awakening immediately the next turn to Baton Pass to a teammate as the opponent switches out. This strategy is risky, but the payoff is usually greater than the risk involved.</p>"

  "Lanturn": {
    "overview": "<p>Almost no other Pokemon can hold its own in the diverse special attacking metagame of UU, catching switches on bulky and offensive Fire- and Water-types alike. However, even with formidable resistances to Fire-, Water-, Ice-, and Electric-type attacks, Lanturn simply cannot take repeated beatings, resisted or not, without proper team support. Smart play and knowing Lanturn's limits are important when using it. With enough practice and experience, Lanturn makes a unique and colorful addition to any team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lanturn has access to Aqua Ring, which when used in tandem with Leftovers, heals 1/8 of Lanturn's health every turn; however, every moveslot is worth a lot to Lanturn, and Lanturn will find itself struggling against certain opponents when Aqua Ring is used. Lanturn can make use of a parafusion set, utilizing Thunder Wave and Confuse Ray to make it almost impossible for the opponent to attack. Icy Wind can be used to slow an opponent down, but it is severely outclassed by Ice Beam in terms of power, and Agility and Thunder Wave in terms of Speed modification. Finally, Toxic can be used to severely cripple an opponent, but common Lanturn switch-ins such as Toxicroak and Venusaur are immune to Toxic, making Thunder Wave the best option in most cases.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>In UU, specific Pokemon who can switch in neutrally on Lanturn's main attacking moves and come prepared with a super effective STAB attack do well. Quagsire, Ludicolo, and Gastrodon are excellent examples, all of which are armed with either Earthquake or a super effective Grass-type attack. Other Grass-types do exceedingly well at stopping Lanturn, especially those who don't mind taking a Thunder Wave while switching in; bulkier Grass-type Pokemon such as Tangrowth can absorb the paralysis in confidence that they won't have to worry about more dangerous damaging statuses. Chansey can switch in on any status move and simply dispose of them when she switches out thanks to her ability, while absorbing any weak special attacks Lanturn throws at her.</p> <p>Dugtrio can trap and kill Lanturn if it can get in without eating Surf. It will survive Ice Beam at full health most of the time unless Lanturn is running more than 247 Special Attack (which is close to its maximum without a Modest nature). Other strong Ground-type attackers in UU like Donphan, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen can KO Lanturn if they get the chance to switch in.</p> <p>In general, considering Lanturn's mediocre Defense stat, most strong physical attackers will easily dispense of Lanturn should they be able to safely switch in, either on a predicted resisted move or to revenge kill following a kill by Lanturn. Faster Ground-types do well, however most will have to watch out for STAB Water-type moves, especially from more offensive Lanturn. Toxic and Toxic Spikes also spell doom for Lanturn if it lacks Rest, and they help to wear Lanturn down enough to sweep.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Tank": {
        "description": "<p>Lanturn is a great special tank, having the bulk to absorb many special hits in the UU tier. Surf is a reliable, yet reasonably powerful attack, and is one of Lanturn's main attacks. Thunderbolt is another STAB attack, and hits a lot of Pokemon that Surf does not for super effective damage. Discharge is an option over Thunderbolt, offering lower power but having a much higher chance of paralyzing a threat, allowing Lanturn and its teammates to have an easier time with them. Heal Bell turns Lanturn into a cleric, allowing it to clear status off all its teammates. It also prevents Lanturn from getting crippled by Toxic coming from the likes of Arcanine and Milotic. Thunder Wave guarantees an opponent paralyzed, and if Lanturn utilizes it, Thunderbolt should be used over Discharge.</p> <p>The Defense EVs allow Lanturn to survive an Earthquake from Impish Donphan, boosted Facade from Swellow, and +2 Return from Life Orb Feraligatr. The Special Defense EVs allow Lanturn to tank Moltres's Fire Blast assaults. The Special Attack EVs allow Lanturn to OHKO Rhyperior and 2HKO specially defensive Donphan with Surf. The remaining EVs are put into HP to give Lanturn more bulk and to hit a Leftovers number. Calm nature allows Lanturn to tank special hits more easily, while not altering any of its necessary stats.</p> <p>Though Lanturn has a reasonable amount of physical bulk, it cannot take repeated hits of any kind, meaning a sturdy physical wall will greatly benefit Lanturn. Leafeon pairs well with Lanturn, having impressive physical bulk and great synergy with Lanturn. Leafeon also has access to Wish, allowing it to heal itself and Lanturn, making it an ideal teammate. Entry hazards are also welcome, as special attackers will often find themselves unable to harm Lanturn, forcing them to switch out. Registeel is a good candidate for Stealth Rock thanks to its huge amount of physical bulk and access to Thunder Wave, allowing it to cripple opposing Pokemon if Lanturn lacks Thunder Wave itself.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Charge Beam": {
        "description": "<p>Lanturn can utilize Substitute and Charge Beam to easily destroy unprepared teams, thanks to its ability to set up on many special walls, gain Special Attack boosts easily, and manage to come out on top. With a combination of Substitute and Charge Beam, Lanturn can beat Chansey and other Pokemon who rely on Seismic Toss to deal damage, as it will take two Seismic Toss to break Lanturn's Substitute. Lanturn hits hard with max Special Attack, and very hard after just a few boosts from Charge Beam. It has perfect coverage with its moves, bar opposing Lanturn and Shedinja, and is a very good weapon against stall and slower teams. It has a very good typing, ability, and coverage, which is very helpful for Lanturn.</p> <p>Thanks to its wide coverage, it can easily defeat teams that rely on a Fire-Water-Grass core, as each type is hit for super effective damage by one of Lanturn's attacks. The EVs allow Lanturn to outrun 8 Speed Milotic, defensive Venusaur, Rhyperior, and Adamant Aggron. The HP EVs allow Lanturn to create 101 Substitutes, while also giving it an extra point of healing each turn via Leftovers. Special Attack is maxed out so that Lanturn can hit as hard as possible, while the remaining EVs are put into its lower Defense to help it tank hits better.</p> <p>Even with the investment in Defense, Lanturn appreciates teammates who can take powerful physical attacks, especially Ground- and Grass-type attacks. Altaria, Scyther, and Moltres all make decent partners, although Rhyperior will cause issues for everybody because Lanturn cannot switch into even Stone Edge. Tangrowth is a good counter to Rhyperior, and can switch in on an Earthquake and force it out with Power Whip. Offensive Venusaur can cause problems for Lanturn, so Altaria is again a great option for defeating Venusaur. Other options include Toxicroak, who can deal with the special variants, and Scyther and Moltres, who can deal with the physical variants. However, all counters must beware of a potential Sleep Powder.</p>"
      },
      "Rain Dance": {
        "description": "<p>This set utilizes Lanturn's ability to set up Rain Dance, which can boost the power of its Water-type moves, while bringing its powerful Thunder to 100% accuracy. Hydro Pump is the main option, because it allows Lanturn to 2HKO Clefable in the rain, which is a great bonus. However, Surf can still be used if you are wary about Hydro Pump's shaky accuracy. Heal Bell allows Lanturn to also act as a cleric, while Ice Beam provides Lanturn with almost perfect coverage, hitting all Pokemon for at least neutral damage, except for other Lanturn and Shedinja. This set works very well thanks to Lanturn's invaluable Electric-type immunity, combined with good special bulk. Lanturn can easily switch in on Choice Scarf Rotom, amongst other Electric-type Pokemon, and set up Rain Dance with ease. While Lanturn works well as a bulky user of Rain Dance, Lanturn does a much better job when hitting hard, allowing it to beat several Pokemon that usually enjoy setting up on relatively weak Lanturn, such as Mismagius and Toxicroak.</p> <p>A Modest nature is used so Lanturn can hit as hard as possible. Damp Rock is the recommended item choice so that the rain will last for eight turns, allowing Lanturn and its teammates to abuse it more easily. The EV spread brings Lanturn to 401 HP, maximizes Lanturn's Special Attack stat, and heavily reinforces Lanturn's Special Defense, turning Lanturn into a sturdy special tank.</p> <p>Though not a direct counter, Dugtrio is a major threat to Lanturn. It can switch in on a Rain Dance or Thunder, and immediately threaten Lanturn with a STAB super effective Earthquake. As an answer to this threat, a Pokemon such as Torterra makes for a great teammate, being able to setup on Dugtrio after Lanturn faints. Venusaur is also problematic, so a Pokemon who can take it out will greatly aid Lanturn and all of its teammates.</p>"
      },
      "Agility": {
        "description": "<p>Lanturn can make great use of Agility, turning it into a fearsome endgame sweeper. It doesn't quite have the power to get through bulkier teams, but if they are weakened from previous assaults and entry hazards, it can sweep many teams with its great coverage. Agility doubles Lanturn's Speed, allowing it to hit 466 Speed, outspeeding almost all Pokemon in the UU tier, unless they hold a Choice Scarf. Hydro Pump is Lanturn's most powerful attack, gains STAB, and hits very hard. Surf is an alternative, trading power for accuracy, and is much more reliable. Thunderbolt is for secondary STAB, and hits opposing Water-type Pokemon hard. Ice Beam hits Grass- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Venusaur and Altaria, respectively.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Lanturn's Special Attack and Speed stat, allowing it to hit as hard as possible while outrunning Choice Scarf Rotom after an Agility, and Jolly Torterra before an Agility. The remaining EVs are put into Defense to allow Lanturn to take physical hits a tad easier. Thunder Wave is an option over Agility, and if you decide to make this change, the Speed EVs should be shifted into HP and Special Defense to turn Lanturn into a serviceable Life Orb tank. Lanturn loves switching in on bulky Water-types, making Moltres an ideal teammate as it attracts Water- and Electric-type attacks, and they form a powerful specially offensive core.</p> <p>Choice Band Dugtrio is a great teammate, trapping special walls such as Chansey, Registeel, and Clefable, and being able to 2HKO them with Earthquake, allowing Lanturn to have a much easier time sweeping. Opposing Lanturn are also taken care of by Dugtrio. Entry hazards are crucial to Lanturn's success, so teammates that can set up hazards will greatly benefit Lanturn. Though not often seen in the tier, Cacturne makes a decent teammate, resisting both of Lanturn's weaknesses, and being able to set up Spikes. Uxie is a great candidate for Stealth Rock, having Levitate to avoid Ground- attacks aimed at Lanturn, and having a lot of bulk to easily set up.</p>"
      },
      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<p>Lanturn has access to impressive bulk, great typing, a great ability, Rest, and Sleep Talk, allowing Lanturn to effectively switch into powerful assaults and heal itself thanks to Rest. Sleep Talk prevents Lanturn from being a sitting duck while it's asleep, and prevents Lanturn from being set up on. Surf and Discharge are both reasonably powerful STAB moves, and have good coverage with each other. Thunderbolt is an option over Discharge to pack more power, but since this set lacks impressive offensive capabilities, Discharge is usually the better option thanks to its relatively high paralysis rate.</p> <p>Ice Beam is an option over Surf to create the BoltBeam combination that hits all Pokemon for neutral damage bar Magneton, Shedinja, and opposing Lanturn, but the extra STAB power that Surf provides is usually more appealing. Most enemies will be left unimpressed by a non-STAB Ice Beam from this set's relatively low Special Attack. The HP EVs allow Lanturn to hit a Leftovers number, the Defense EVs allow it to take more powerful physical attacks, the Special Attack EVs allow Lanturn to hit hard against switch-ins such as Donphan and Rhyperior, and the Special Defense EVs turn Lanturn into a sturdier special tank.</p> <p>Grass-types do well against Lanturn, resisting both of Lanturn's attacking moves, while being able to threaten Lanturn with powerful super effective STAB attacks. Sceptile can switch in easily, and either set up a Substitute or hit Lanturn hard with a Leaf Storm. Venusaur can easily set up Swords Dance on Lanturn, before knocking it out with Power Whip. Therefore, a Pokemon that can deal with the aforementioned Grass-type Pokemon is helpful. Moltres complements Lanturn well, having great defensive synergy with it and being able to scout switch-ins with Substitute and toast Lanturn's enemies with a powerful Fire Blast. Arcanine can also deal with Grass-types thanks to its powerful Flare Blitz, but it shares a common Ground-type weakness with Lanturn.</p>"

  "Xatu": {
    "overview": "<p>Although this strange mystical bird seems outclassed, she has a few perks over fellow Psychic-types like Alakazam and Uxie. High Speed and Special Attack, along with a decent offensive movepool, turn Xatu into a respectable sweeper. Her typing gives her a 4x resistance to Fighting-type attacks, making her a decent supporter as well. Xatu's movepool includes great supporting options, such as Wish, Roost, Haze, and Light Screen; she even has access to Baton Pass to escape Pursuit users and/or pass Calm Mind and Substitute. While Xatu seems like an impeccable Pokemon, her weakness to Stealth Rock and Pursuit make it harder to switch her in, and she requires good prediction against Dark- and Ghost-types. All in all, Xatu will make a great addition to your team, just make sure she uses a set that isn't outclassed by anything else in UU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Xatu may utilize Sucker Punch or Quick Attack for priority, which work well with her usable Attack stat. Feather Dance can be used on a more defensive set to weaken physical attackers, though Reflect is normally better as its effect isn't removed upon the foe switching out. Grass Knot deals more damage to heavy Pokemon like Milotic and Rhyperior, while Night Shade can be used for consistent damage against any opponent (bar Normal-types). Psycho Shift is a nifty option to bounce status conditions, such as burn and poison, back onto the opponent. This can be useful in some scenarios, such as burning Fighting-types with a self-inflicted burn from Flame Orb, but it is highly situational and none too reliable. Finally, Substitute and Pain Split can be used on a makeshift SubSplit set, though Xatu's weaknesses to Stealth Rock and common attacking types make it difficult to pull off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Spiritomb is probably Xatu's biggest counter, its high Special Defense, immunity to Psychic-type moves, and STAB Pursuit and Sucker Punch make it very difficult to beat. In fact, most Dark-types give Xatu trouble; Houndoom can switch into Psychic and Heat Wave and has access to STAB Dark-type moves, while Drapion can Speed tie with Xatu and threaten her with Night Slash or Pursuit. Chansey and Clefable are both great counters, having huge HP and high Special Defense, a good support movepool, and reliable recovery in Wish and Soft-Boiled. Registeel is another great counter, taking little damage from anything that isn't a boosted Heat Wave, and it has the ability to cripple Xatu with Thunder Wave, hit her with Ice Punch, or set up Stealth Rock to make switching in more difficult. Other specially defensive Water-types can take on Xatu with ease; Milotic, Slowking, and Lanturn have good defenses, high HP, and Ice Beam to hit Xatu super effectively. Basically anything with good Special Defense and a super effective attack can take on Xatu, just beware of Trick and boosted attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wish Passer": {
        "description": "<p>Xatu is the Jirachi of UU, having access to Wish, U-turn, and STAB Psychic. The idea behind this set is to support Xatu's teammates with Wish and possibly one of the dual screens, then U-turn to another Pokemon who can take advantage of them. Psychic is used for STAB, hitting the likes of Venusaur and Hariyama super effectively. Protect is used in the last slot as it guarantees that Xatu will restore her health with Wish, all the while gaining Leftovers recovery. If you decide to use a screen in the last slot, you may consider Light Clay as Xatu's item to prolong the screen.</p> <p>224 Speed EVs allow Xatu to reach a Speed stat of 310, outrunning Timid Rotom and all base 90s like Moltres. Max HP gives Xatu the bulk she needs to support her teammates with Wish. The remaining EVs are placed into Defense, helping Xatu with her weaknesses to Pursuit and priority moves like Ice Shard and Shadow Sneak.</p> <p>As this set will be switching a lot, Stealth Rock will take its toll on Xatu, meaning a Rapid Spinner is almost essential to keep her alive. Donphan is an excellent choice for this role as he can switch into Electric- and Rock-type attacks aimed at Xatu, has access to Assurance to hit Ghost-types, and benefits from Wish (as he has no reliable recovery of his own). Hitmontop is another good choice as he can use Foresight to hit Ghost-types, and can switch into Dark- and Rock-type attacks for Xatu.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>Xatu is the only Pokemon in UU with access to Light Screen, Reflect, U-turn, and Wish all on the same moveset, making her an ideal dual screener. To make the most of this set, switch into a weak or resisted attack and proceed to set up dual screens, then use either Wish to support Xatu's teammates, or U-turn to escape the battle. Xatu's restistances to Grass- and Fighting-type attacks is very helpful, as is her immunity to Ground-type attacks. Light Clay is the most useful item for this set as it prolongs Xatu's dual screens and gives her teammates more time to set up.</p> <p>This set uses 224 Speed EVs, allowing Xatu to outrun Timid Rotom and all base 90 Pokemon. Maximum HP gives Xatu more bulk, increasing her ability to take hits. The remaining EVs are placed into Defense for extra bulk, which helps Xatu take common physical priority moves like Ice Shard and Shadow Sneak.</p> <p>Setup sweepers can take advantage of the defenses provided by the dual screens. Swords Dancers such as Scyther and Drapion are great options, as they are relatively frail and have massive Attack and high Speed. On the special side, Nasty Plot Mismagius and Calm Mind Alakazam are both dangerous sweepers who are difficult to wall after enough boosts. Dragon Dance Altaria is another good option as she can recover her health with Roost, and has Natural Cure to rid herself of status upon switching out. Alternatively, you may use this time to set up entry hazards with frail Pokemon like Qwilfish, Cacturne, and Cloyster (who isn't frail on the physical side, though Light Screen helps with his poor Special Defense).</p>"
      },
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>Xatu also has access to Baton Pass through Pokemon XD, turning her into a great Calm Mind passer. Her high Speed, access to Roost (which also temporarily removes Xatu's Electric-, Ice-, and Rock-type weakness), and her decent defenses also help. Psychic is useful as it provides good STAB, and gives Xatu something to do in case she gets Taunted. Substitute isn't really important to this set's success as Synchronize will (or should) discourage status users. The main idea of this set is to switch into a resisted attack, set up a boost or two with Calm Mind, and then escape with Baton Pass before the opponent has chance to hit Xatu.</p> <p>224 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Xatu to outrun positively natured Rotom, escaping before it has chance to hit Xatu with either of its STAB moves. Max HP makes Xatu more bulky, and helps her take hits much better. The remaining EVs are placed into Defense, which helps Xatu switch into physical attackers more easily, especially Fighting-types.</p> <p>Recipients for the boosts are essential teammates. Special attackers such as Milotic and Moltres are good choices as receivers as they are unable to boost their own Special Attack, though Moltres can raise its Speed with Agility. Be careful when using Moltres as it loses half its health upon switching into Stealth Rock, making a Rapid Spinner vital for success. Finally, while Octillery is a strange option, he can be an integral part of a Baton Pass chain; if you pass him some Speed and Special Attack, he'll be breaking through the opponent in no time. Octillery has the added benefit of Suction Cups, making it impossible for the opponent to phaze him out with Roar or Whirlwind.</p> <p>As this set aims to gain as many stat boosts as possible, support from Reflect may be used to raise Xatu's Defense. Uxie, Alakazam, and Grumpig are all excellent options to set it up. Alternatively, Spiritomb and Mismagius may use Will-O-Wisp to cripple physical attackers and cut their Attack in half with a burn.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>This set uses Calm Mind to boost Xatu's already decent Special Attack, turning her into a dangerous sweeper. Psychic is used for STAB, Heat Wave hits Steel-, Bug-, and Grass-types, and Roost is to recover any HP lost from Life Orb, Stealth Rock, and other extraneous damage. Hidden Power Ground is an option in the last slot as it takes care of Houndoom, Skuntank, and Drapion, who are dangerous threats and wall the rest of this set. The basic premise behind this set is to switch into an opponent who can't deal a lot of damage to Xatu and proceed with Calm Mind; her good typing gives her the opportunity to set up on most Grass-types and the occasional Choiced Fighting-type that lacks a super effective attack.</p> <p>Special walls like Chansey and Clefable give this set difficulty due to Xatu's inability to break through them. A strong Fighting-type such as Hariyama is a good partner for Xatu as he can switch into Rock- and Dark-type moves aimed at Xatu, while Xatu switches into most Psychic-types pretty easily. Hariyama also doesn't mind status if he's running Guts as his ability. Blaziken, Hitmontop, and Toxicroak are good options too. Dark-types such as Spiritomb and Houndoom are also troublesome, making Hitmontop an ideal partner; its STAB Fighting-type attacks, along with priority, Foresight, and Intimidate, will scare away most Dark-type enemies.</p> <p>Toxic Spikes are another answer to bulky walls like Milotic and Slowking, gradually draining them with worsening poison damage. Qwilfish, Nidoqueen, and Cloyster are all reliable users of Toxic Spikes; Nidoqueen is especially helpful as she can switch into Rock- and Electric-type attacks aimed at Xatu. When using any sort of entry hazard, support from a spinblocker is recommended to keep them on the field; this makes Ghost-types such as Mismagius, Spiritomb, and Rotom good choices as teammates; just watch out for overlapping weaknesses with Xatu.</p> <p>Baton Pass is an option in the last slot as it allows Xatu to escape Pursuit users, and passing Calm Mind is always helpful.</p>"

      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>Xatu's good movepool and decent Special Attack make her an ideal user of Choice items, which can turn her into a great revenge killer. Psychic is used for STAB, severely damaging Fighting- and Poison-types, Heat Wave hits Steel-types like Registeel, and Hidden Power Ground hits Drapion, Skuntank, and Houndoom super effectively. Hidden Power Flying can be used for secondary STAB, hitting Grass- and Bug-types harder than Heat Wave, it also provides good neutral coverage. The last slot is reserved for Trick or Shadow Ball; Trick can cripple a troublesome wall and aid a teammate's setup, while Shadow Ball allows Xatu to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types super effectively. Be careful when firing off Psychic with a Choice item, as this gives Dark-types an easy switch in, and makes Xatu incredibly vulnerable to Pursuit and Sucker Punch.</p> <p>With 224 Speed EVs, a Timid nature, and a Choice Scarf, Xatu reaches 468 Speed; this is enough to outrun almost everything in UU, including Choice Scarf Rotom. When using Choice Specs, it's better to use maximum Speed, which allows Xatu to tie with other base 95 Pokemon. As for alternative move choices, Baton Pass may be used in the last slot as it allows Xatu to escape Pursuit users, and it also turns her into a scout Pokemon, revealing the opponent's team and easing prediction. U-turn may also be used to scout the opponent's switch-in, allowing you to switch to an appropriate counter.</p> <p>Chansey and Spiritomb cause problems for Xatu, mainly because of their huge Special Defense and decent typing. Toxic Spikes help wear down both threats, weakening them more with every passing turn they stay in. Qwilfish and Nidoqueen are good choices to set them up, just make sure that your opponent doesn't have a Pokemon who can abuse Guts. Blaziken is another great partner as he is immune to Will-O-Wisp from Spiritomb, takes reduced damage from Dark-type attacks, and can scare Chansey away with Superpower. Finally, Dugtrio can trap Chansey and KO her with STAB Earthquake.</p>"

  "Sudowoodo": {
    "overview": "<p>Since its introduction, Sudowoodo has always been shunned in favor of more powerful alternatives. Pure Rock typing is surprisingly poor defensively, and as an offensive Pokemon, Sudowoodo is overshadowed by the likes of Rhyperior, Kabutops, and Aggron, all of which boast superior stats and useful secondary STAB moves. Luckily, Sudowoodo does have one big advantage over its rivals in the form of Wood Hammer, which lets it turn the tables on Water- and Ground-types that counter other Rock-types. Explosion and Sucker Punch also help set Sudowoodo apart, making it a very dangerous Pokemon when behind a Substitute. Overall, Sudowoodo still lacks the power and Speed necessary to be a top threat, but when played well it can be a powerful force that is sure to punch some holes in your opponent's team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rock Polish is a tempting option for boosting Sudowoodo's Speed and attempting a sweep; unfortunately, Sudowoodo is so slow that even after a boost it will still be outsped by most common revenge killers, and its typing leaves it weak to many popular priority attacks. Hammer Arm can work as an alternative Fighting-type move that hits many Normal-types harder than Low Kick, most notably OHKOing Kangaskhan with a Choice Band, but Sudowoodo will miss Low Kick's extra power against Registeel and Steelix. Double-Edge is a drawback-free 120 Base Power move when used with Rock Head, but the great power and coverage of Sudowoodo's main options makes it unnecessary. Sudowoodo also has access to the elemental punches; Ice Punch can be useful for surprising Torterra, but otherwise, their low Base Power makes them useless. Rock Slide can be used in place of Stone Edge if you prefer its increased accuracy and PP over Stone Edge's higher power. Sudowoodo learns Calm Mind, but with a ridiculously low Special Attack stat and a nonexistent special movepool, it's nothing more than a joke option (and a hilarious one at that).</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Hitmontop and Hariyama are excellent counters; with great physical Defense and a resistance to Stone Edge, they take little damage from any of Sudowoodo's attacks and can strike back with STAB Close Combat. Bulky Grass-types, such as Torterra and Tangrowth, can usually switch in freely and and force Sudowoodo out with their STAB attacks, although they must watch out for Explosion and the rare Ice Punch. Unless it has Substitute, Sudowoodo is easily revenge killed by nearly any special attacker (beware of Sucker Punch), but switching in requires good prediction.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>With a solid base 100 Attack and plenty of powerful physical moves, Sudowoodo can be a dangerous offensive force. While its terrible Speed and poor defensive typing prevent it from sweeping teams, it excels as a wallbreaker that very few Pokemon can safely switch in on. Sudowoodo's STAB Stone Edge allows it to immediately threaten the abundant Fire-, Flying-, and Bug-types in UU. Wood Hammer is Sudowoodo's secret weapon that sets it apart from other Rock-types; whereas Rhyperior and Aggron are forced to retreat at the first sign of a bulky Water-type, Wood Hammer gives Sudowoodo a chance to OHKO even Milotic after Stealth Rock damage. Low Kick puts a big dent in the heavy Steel-type walls that resist Rock and Grass, while Earthquake hits the same Steel-types nearly as hard and has more consistent power against other targets. In the last slot, Explosion essentially guarantees Sudowoodo will KO at least one opposing Pokemon per match, but the priority Sucker Punch provides can be very useful to overcome Sudowoodo's abysmal Speed.</p> <p>The EVs are standard for a physical attacker. With 252 Speed EVs, Sudowoodo outspeeds base 60 Speed Pokemon that do not invest in Speed, such as Weezing and Clefable. Since Sudowoodo will mostly be operating as a hit-and-run attacker, Choice Band is the ideal item for this set. With a Choice Band equipped, Sudowoodo has the power to OHKO would-be checks such as Venusaur and Azumarill as they switch in, while common physical walls like Weezing, Slowbro, Steelix, and Donphan are all outsped and 2HKOed by the appropriate move. However, if you opt for Sucker Punch in the last slot, Life Orb becomes the superior item, as locking a Pokemon into Sucker Punch is never wise.</p> <p>Sudowoodo's wallbreaking ability makes it a great teammate for any physical sweeper that struggles to beat bulky Water- and Ground-types. However, defensive Grass- and Fighting-types such as Tangrowth, Torterra, and Hitmontop counter Sudowoodo very effectively; thus, another Pokemon will be required to deal with them. Blaziken can tear through teams once their Milotic or Slowbro is KOed and easily defeats Grass-types with STAB Fire Blast or Flare Blitz, making it an ideal partner. Moltres and Scyther can also switch in practically freely on Grass- and Fighting-type attacks and force their users out with STAB Flying-type attacks. As an offensive Pokemon, Sudowoodo appreciates entry hazard support; Spikes are particularly effective, weakening Sudowoodo's grounded counters. Omastar and Cloyster are the most reliable Spikers in UU, but both share unfortunate weaknesses to Grass- and Fighting-type attacks with Sudowoodo. Qwilfish and Cacturne have slightly better synergy with Sudowoodo; Qwilfish resists Fighting- and Water-type attacks and can use Explosion to give an offensive team early momentum, while Cacturne resists Grass-, Ground-, and Water-type attacks and thrives in sandstorm, which also boosts Sudowoodo's mediocre Special Defense.</p>"
      },
      "SubPunch": {
        "description": "<p>With Substitute, Sudowoodo can take advantage of a switch to ease prediction and guarantee a powerful hit on whatever Pokemon the opponent brings in. This makes Sudowoodo an excellent lure for popular walls such as Milotic and Registeel, which are both easily crippled by Sudowoodo's powerful super effective attacks. By weakening or removing these defensive threats, Sudowoodo can pave the way for a teammate to sweep.</p> <p>Focus Punch is an excellent attack to use when behind a Substitute, and together with STAB Stone Edge, it provides near-perfect coverage. Sudowoodo has several options for its third attack. Wood Hammer is usually the best choice, as it cripples Water- and Ground-types such as Milotic and Rhyperior without any drawbacks. It also helps differentiate Sudowoodo from Golem, which otherwise performs this set better in nearly every way. Explosion guarantees Sudowoodo will take down the Pokemon it lures in; this is especially useful against Grass-types like Tangrowth that it would otherwise struggle with. Finally, if you wish to use Sudowoodo as a more traditional SubPuncher, Sucker Punch is a good option in the last slot thanks to its priority and wonderful offensive synergy with Substitute and Focus Punch.</p> <p>Life Orb is the best item if Sudowoodo is being used as a lure, as the power boost ensures Sudowoodo's attacks will cripple the opponent's switch-in. For a more conservative SubPunch set with Sucker Punch, Leftovers is the superior choice to help recover the HP lost by setting up Substitutes. The given EV spread makes Sudowoodo faster than Weezing and Clefable that do not invest in Speed, along with the multitude of base 50 Speed walls, while also allowing Sudowoodo to set up five Substitutes if it carries Leftovers.</p> <p>As this set's purpose is to remove a troublesome wall that Sudowoodo can lure in, it works best with sweepers that can dominate once their primary counters are out of commission. For example, with the opponent's bulky Water-type down, Blaziken and Moltres become very difficult to stop. Likewise, a crippled Registeel or Steelix gives Swellow a free pass to wreak havoc, while Exploding on Venusaur or Tangrowth allows Kabutops and Torterra to walk all over your opponent's team.</p>"
      },
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Sudowoodo doesn't have the best defensive typing, but it does sport a solid Defense stat and handy resistances to Normal-, Fire-, and Flying-type attacks, giving it plenty of opportunities to come in and set up Stealth Rock. Even without any investment in Attack, Stone Edge is still a powerful STAB move that prevents opposing Pokemon from setting up on Sudowoodo. Wood Hammer provides great complementary coverage and prevents Water- and Ground-types from switching in freely, but it does leave Sudowoodo walled by Toxicroak and Steel-types, so Earthquake and Low Kick are both acceptable replacements. The last slot is reserved for further support; Toxic is a great catch-all move to gradually wear down Sudowoodo's foes, while Explosion allows Sudowoodo to take an enemy down with it when its job is done.</p> <p>The given EVs capitalize on Sudowoodo's respectable physical bulk, allowing it to survive all but the most powerful super effective attacks. Sudowoodo is typically quite vulnerable to special attacks, so sandstorm support from Hippopotas can be very helpful. A spread of 252 HP / 16 Def / 240 SpD with an Impish nature will maximize Sudowoodo's overall defenses in sandstorm, allowing it to take hits from physical and special attackers alike while wearing down the opposing team with Stealth Rock and Toxic. Grass- and Fighting-types will still pose a problem for Sudowoodo, especially those with a Poison subtype or Guts, both of which render Toxic useless. Moltres can handle most of the Pokemon Sudowoodo fears and is a very capable staller with the SubRoost combination, although it doesn't particularly enjoy sandstorm. Gligar is often overlooked, but it can use Aerial Ace to deal with Grass- and Fighting-types and is very effective on a sandstorm team. Cacturne also appreciates sandstorm and can add additional entry hazards in the form of Spikes; it also resists the Grass-, Water-, and Ground-type moves that Sudowoodo hates.</p>"

  "Politoed": {
    "overview": "<p>Politoed is often overlooked in UU, as it is faced with competition for a team slot from its bulky Water rivals Milotic, Slowbro, and Blastoise. What Politoed does have and what sets it apart from its rivals are its ability, Water Absorb, and useful support moves, including Encore, Haze, and Hypnosis. Politoed also has excellent Special Defense, high HP, and a decent typing, and can even pose as a powerful offensive threat thanks to its impressive Special Attack and good offensive movepool. The downside to using Politoed are its below-average Speed and lack of recovery outside of Rest and Water Absorb. However, if you provide it with adequate support and play to its strengths, Politoed can become quite an effective addition to your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Politoed can remedy its lack of recovery with a RestTalk strategy, though it's unreliable, and Politoed lacks the sheer bulk to pull it off. Perish Song is an interesting option for Politoed, as it forces many switches, racking up damage from entry hazards and acting as a win condition against the opponent's last Pokemon. Whirlpool can be used alongside Perish Song to trap the opponent, but its accuracy and reliablity becomes an issue, as you have no guarantee it'll last the three turns you need. Haze is another great choice to erase any stat boosts the opponent has accumulated, and it isn't hard to pull off due to Politoed's good defensive stats. Politoed also has a few physical options; it has access to Belly Drum, though it lacks the Speed to use it effectively, and it also lacks a secondary STAB, making Poliwrath a better user of this move. It might be tempting to run a completely physical set of Earthquake, Waterfall, Return, and Bounce, but again, Politoed lacks a secondary STAB, and its Attack isn't particularly impressive.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Due to Politoed's special nature, Chansey and Clefable can take on most sets with their huge HP, good Special Defense, and access to recovery moves. Lanturn is another good counter, as it can switch into most attacks and threaten Politoed with Thunderbolt, though Toxic and Hidden Power Grass are troublesome. Uxie and Mismagius can set up against special sets, as Politoed is unable to hit them super effectively; they can also inflict status on Politoed with Thunder Wave or Toxic. Grass-types such as Venusaur and Sceptile can take on Politoed, with their resistance to Water-type attacks, powerful STAB moves, and Leech Seed to drain Politoed's HP; Venusaur even has Sleep Powder to shut Politoed down temporarily.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Politoed's great defenses and dangerous support moves by using a combination of Encore and Toxic to mess with the opponent's strategy. Although Politoed isn't the fastest Encore user, it has enough Speed to outrun common walls and slower set-up sweepers, such as Spiritomb, Clefable, and Registeel, and Toxic them to inflict residual damage on your opponent's Pokemon. Surf is the essential STAB move, and allows Politoed to retain some usefulness after it is struck by Taunt, while Ice Beam is used to damage Grass-types such as Venusaur, who resist Surf and are immune to Toxic. Protect can also be used in the fourth slot in place of Ice Beam, which stalls the opponent and increases their torture from Toxic while also buying Politoed time to recover damage with Leftovers. Finally, Refresh is helpful, as it can remove damaging status such as poison or burn.</p> <p>This set is designed to stick around for some time, so maximizing HP and Special Defense is the best way to go for the EV spread; a Pokemon sporting 384 HP and 328 Special Defense is nothing to scoff at. As for the item choice, Politoed can also decide to use Lum Berry to block status a single time. This is best used when Politoed is without Refresh; otherwise, it would be a waste of an item slot.</p> <p>Entry hazard support is especially helpful when using Politoed, as Encore and Toxic will cause a lot of switches, causing the opposing Pokemon to take damage on the switch-in. Stealth Rock is the most dangerous entry hazard, hitting all Pokemon and even causing some to lose half their health upon switching in. Donphan is an excellent option to set it up, as it also serves as a lure for bulky Water-types and has Assurance to hit Ghost-types who switch in. Toxic Spikes are also useful alongside Politoed, and with two layers, steadily increasing poison damage will cripple the likes of Milotic, Chansey, and Spiritomb. These are best set up by Drapion or Qwilfish, who both have high Speed and access to Taunt. If using Toxic Spikes, Toxic can be dropped for either Protect or Refresh. Finally, Spikes are also dangerous, depending on how many layers you've set up; three layers can prove devastating to the opponent's team. Cloyster is a fine choice for setting up Spikes due to its massive Defense and access to Explosion. When using entry hazards, a spinblocker is essential for keeping them on the field, making bulky Ghost-types such as Spiritomb excellent partners.</p> <p>Setup sweepers can take advantage of an opponent locked into a weak or resisted attack, especially those who become dangerous after a single boost. Dragon Dance Altaria is an excellent choice, as it can switch into Grass-type moves aimed at Politoed, and has an immunity to Earthquake to take advantage of. Nasty Plot Mismagius is an excellent option as well, boasting immunities to Ground-, Fighting-, and Normal-type attacks. Other Pokemon can take advantage of their abilities to set up on Encored attacks; Houndoom can easily set up on opponents locked into Fire-type attacks, while SubCharge Lanturn can start boosting on an Electric-type attack.</p> <p>Grass-types also make great partners, as they share great defensive synergy with Politoed, being able to switch into Electric- and Grass-type attacks while Politoed can easily take Fire-type hits. Venusaur is an excellent choice, as it has great defenses, powerful STAB moves, access to Sleep Powder, and the ability to take on bulky Water-types with ease. Sceptile is another great option, as it can set up Leech Seed and fast Substitutes against the opponent; Politoed appreciates the health recovered from Leech Seed. On the other hand, Politoed has trouble getting past Grass-types as well, making Fire-types great additions to your team. Moltres is one of the best choices for this role due to its massive Special Attack, decent Speed, and powerful STAB moves; however, Rapid Spin support is essential to Moltres's success, as it loses half of its health upon switching into Stealth Rock. Blaziken is another good choice if you wish to go the physical or mixed route, pounding the opponent with STAB Superpower and Flare Blitz.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>This set is played offensively, using Politoed's base 90 Special Attack and Choice Specs to cause a lot of damage. Surf and Hydro Pump are both reliable STAB moves, so the choice between them ultimately comes down to whether you would rather have power or accuracy. Hydro Pump will always score a 2HKO on defensive Clefable, while Surf misses out. Ice Beam is used to hit Grass-types such as Venusaur, while Hidden Power Grass is used to smash Water-types, especially Lanturn, Quagsire, and Milotic. In the last slot, Focus Blast can 2HKO Registeel and Clefable, while Psychic deals more damage to Poison- and Fighting-types, specifically Toxicroak.</p> <p>This Politoed runs enough Speed to outrun positive-natured base 50 Pokemon such as Aggron and neutral-natured max Speed Torterra. Max Special Attack turns Politoed into a dangerous threat, and the remaining 84 EVs are placed into HP, giving Politoed extra bulk. Alternatively, you might decide to maximize Speed investment, outrunning Ludicolo outside of rain and tying at worst with other base 70s.</p> <p>As this set requires a lot of prediction, it's better used for late-game sweeping; you should also consider adding a scout Pokemon to your team to ease prediction. Scyther is a good example of an effective scout, as it causes a lot of switches while escaping to another teammate with U-turn; other options include Swellow, Ambipom, and Moltres. Another way to scout the opponent's team is to use a dry Baton Passer. Good choices for this role include Ambipom, Scyther, and Espeon.</p> <p>Because this set is completely based on special attacks, Chansey is a troublesome Pokemon. With its huge HP and decent Special Defense, it walls Politoed comfortably, even if Politoed tries to nail it with a powerful Focus Blast. To get past Chansey, you can carry Dugtrio on your team; with its ability, Arena Trap, Chansey is unable to escape while Dugtrio demolishes it with STAB Earthquake or Beat Up. Alternatively, you can use a strong Fighting-type such as Blaziken or Hariyama to take out Chansey. As much as Chansey is an awful nemesis to special sweepers, it is an excellent teammate for Politoed, as it can take on bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Grass-types such as Venusaur. Bulky Water-types are difficult to break through, making Toxic Spikes an excellent option to wear them down; Qwilfish and Nidoqueen are excellent Pokemon to set them up. Finally, Venusaur is an excellent way to break through bulky Water-types, with its powerful Leaf Storm and crippling Sleep Powder.</p>"

  "Sunflora": {
    "overview": "<p>This pretty flower has been blessed with a great Special Attack stat, two useful abilities in Chlorophyll and Solar Power, and a pretty good movepool to take advantage of. Although she seems great at first glance, you'll notice her poor Speed and defensive stats make it difficult for her to sweep and leaves her vulnerable to priority moves. Her lack of useful supporting moves is also a disappointment; her support movepool is so shallow, she is even forced to use the horribly unreliable Grass Whistle instead of Sleep Powder. With the correct teammates and/or field effects, Sunflora is a decent offensive Pokemon; just play it safe, she's as delicate as a rose.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sunflora has a pretty good movepool, though half of her attacks are rendered useless by her mediocre stats. Encore can be used against slower Pokemon trying to set up stat boosts, giving a teammate extra time to set up. Leech Seed can be used alongside Substitute to restore Sunflora's health, though her low Speed makes it difficult to pull this off before she gets KOed. Endeavor can be used with a Focus Sash to severely weaken the opponent, but a lack of priority makes it difficult to finish them off. Growth can be used to raise Sunflora's already high Special Attack. Grass Whistle can put an opponent to sleep, just beware of its shaky accuracy. Light Screen raises Sunflora's Special Defense and supports her teammates, and Sludge Bomb hits other Grass-types super effectively, though it provides poor coverage. Swords Dance can be used alongside Seed Bomb and Return, but Venusaur is a much better user of this strategy as he has access to Sleep Powder and Earthquake.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Most Flying-types can take on Sunflora with ease as they resist her main STAB and have super effective attacks to KO her. Moltres, Swellow, and Altaria are just a few examples. Chansey and Clefable can take on any Sunflora thanks to their massive HP and Special Defense stats, access to status moves, and reliable recovery. Golduck can cause problems with Cloud Nine as he outruns Sunflora without her Chlorophyll boost and has access to Ice Beam to hit her super effectively. Specially defensive Weezing is immune to Earth Power, has a resistance to Grass-type attacks, and has Sludge Bomb to dispose of Sunflora. Specially defensive Arcanine is another good option as he can survive Earth Power, has a resistance to Grass-, Ice-, and Fire-type attacks, and has STAB Fire-type attacks to scorch Sunflora. Although Sunflora is fast when her Speed is boosted by Chlorophyll, she's still too slow to beat Pokemon such as Alakazam, Dugtrio, and Sceptile, all of whom can hit Sunflora on her frail defenses and KO her. Finally, Sunflora's poor Defense leaves her vulnerable to physical priority moves such as Sucker Punch and Ice Shard, so take advantage of them when you can.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sunny Day Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Although Sunflora looks like \"just another Chlorophyll user,\" she has higher Special Attack and a better offensive movepool than most of them. When the weather is sunny, Sunflora has enough Speed to outrun base 95 Pokemon and base 105s with a Timid nature. Solar Beam is used for STAB, as the sun removes its charging turn, Hidden Power Fire is used to hit other Grass-types and gains a boost from the sun, and Earth Power provides coverage against Fire-types. Grass Knot can be used for STAB outside the sun and deals a lot of damage to heavy opponents.</p> <p>Sunflora needs partners who can switch into Fire-type attacks as she is unable to stay in against them. Bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Milotic are great examples because of their great defenses and access to reliable recovery moves. Flash Fire Pokemon such as Houndoom and Arcanine are good choices as well. Finally, bulky Rock-types such as Rhyperior and Omastar are good partners as they take little damage from Fire-type attacks and can hit back super effectively--watch out for Hidden Power Grass, though.</p> <p>As Sunflora is so frail, she usually requires a teammate to set up Sunny Day for her. Uxie is a great defensive option and has access to other support moves such as Yawn and Stealth Rock--great assets to offensive teams. Ambipom is another good option because of his blistering Speed, access to Taunt, and the ability to scout the opponent's team with U-turn and Fake Out. Finally, Exeggutor can set up Sunny Day, cripple an opponent with Sleep Powder, then Explode in their face allowing you to bring in Sunflora unscathed. Sunflora also appreciates teammates who take advantage of the sun along with her. Fire-types such as Moltres and Blaziken get a boost to their STAB moves, Chlorophyll users such as Shiftry and Vileplume have their Speed doubled, and Leaf Guard Pokemon such as Leafeon and Tangrowth gain an immunity to status; all are excellent teammates.</p> <p>Sunflora has trouble breaking through special walls such as Chansey and Clefable, making a teammate who can dispose of them a necessity. A powerful Fighting-type such as Hariyama is a good option as it can thrash special walls with its STAB Fighting-type attacks and Guts will turn status into an asset rather than a liability. Dugtrio is another option as Arena Trap will stop them from fleeing the field and a STAB Earthquake OHKOes them with ease.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Sunflora's alternative ability Solar Power, boosting her Special Attack to insane levels. This does come with its drawbacks however. Using a Life Orb when the sun is active causes Sunflora to lose 22.5% of her health per turn, making her extremely frail, and giving her little time to sweep. Leaf Storm is an immensely powerful attack coming from 105 base Special Attack, boosted by Life Orb and Solar Power, and gaining STAB as well. Earth Power is used to hit Fire-types such as Houndoom, Blaziken, and Magmortar on the switch, while Hidden Power is used to hit opposing Grass-types. Synthesis is used to recover Life Orb and Solar Power recoil, and also benefits from the sun by restoring 2/3 of Sunflora's health.</p> <p>A Modest nature along with 244 Speed EVs allow Sunflora to outrun the likes of Weezing and Clefable not investing in Speed, while maximum Special Attack is used for extra power. Alternatively, a Quiet nature can be used with 2 Speed IVs and Trick Room support. Choice Specs is also viable to boost Sunflora's attacking power, though this makes Synthesis pretty useless and doesn't help her much in the long run.</p> <p>If Trick Room is used, Pokemon who can set it up are important. Slowking is a great example as he is slow, has a resistance to Fire- and Ice-type attacks, and access to Slack Off. Porygon2 is another defensive partner with reliable recovery. Slow sweepers such as Camerupt, Rhyperior, and Omastar can be used to plow through the opponent's team. Sunny Day is required to activate Solar Power, making defensive Pokemon like Uxie prime examples of good teammates to set the sunny weather up. More offensive Pokemon such as Shiftry and Exeggutor can be used as well.</p> <p>Again, Chansey and Clefable will be difficult to break through, making powerful physical attackers great teammates. Outside of physical attackers, Taunt Mismagius is immune to Seismic Toss, blocks status and stat boosting moves with Taunt, and has access to Nasty Plot to boost her Special Attack. A +6 Hidden Power Fighting can 2HKO Chansey with ease. Neither Chansey nor Clefable like being Tricked a Choice item, so Pokemon such as Choice Band Spiritomb or Choice Scarf Uxie can catch the opponent off-guard and make a sweep much easier.</p>"

  "Yanma": {
    "overview": "<p>While Yanma may seem harmless at first glance, it can actually deal quite some damage, having the ability to 2HKO many common leads in UU. Yanma has two great abilities in Compound Eyes and Speed Boost, increasing the accuracy of its moves and raising Yanma's Speed every turn, respectively. After two boosts to its Speed, Yanma is capable of outspeeding everything in UU. Yanma also has access to Bug Buzz and Air Slash, two reliable STAB options with good coverage in UU, as well as a useful support move in Hypnosis, which has its accuracy issues alleviated somewhat by Compound Eyes. Yanma does have its fair share of drawbacks despite these many advantages, mainly its paper-thin defenses and relatively shallow movepool. Also, Yanma's all around awful typing makes it 4x weak to the ever present Stealth Rock, pounding one more nail into its coffin. Nonetheless, Yanma is a very unique Pokemon who can be a real asset to a team that is designed to support it appropriately.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>U-turn is a decent option to consider, though given Yanma's vulnerability to Stealth Rock, it's not recommended. Psychic and Shadow Ball are alternate attacking options that offer good coverage, but are quite weak unless they manage to score super effective damage on an opposing Pokemon. Ancient Power enables Yanma to almost assuredly OHKO Moltres, which is otherwise only 3HKOed by Air Slash, when run with a Modest nature. Lastly, Quick Attack can be used for picking off Focus Sash users that are faster than Yanma, though it should only be used in tandem with Compound Eyes, as it is a redundant move alongside Speed Boost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Spiritomb is a great counter to Yanma because it can take any attack Yanma typically uses, can set up on it with Calm Mind, and with a RestTalk setup can take Hypnosis with ease. Spiritomb also has decent offensive stats, and with Yanma's frail defenses, it isn't hard for Spiritomb to remove Yanma from the battle with a timely Shadow Ball or Pursuit. Chansey and Registeel are also issues for Yanma with their impressive special bulk and ability to set up Stealth Rock, making sure Yanma will not be coming back into play safely. Both of the aforementioned Pokemon can also slowly wear Yanma down with Seismic Toss, or cripple it outright with Thunder Wave. Other than the above threats, Sleep Talk Pokemon or those with Insomnia and respectable bulk can counter Yanma. Any Pokemon that can take a hit from Yanma and strike back with a powerful STAB move will usually be able to defeat it once Sleep Clause has been activated.</p>",

      "Attacking Lead": {
        "description": "<p>This is the only set Yanma can run without being harshly outclassed by another Pokemon in UU. Bug Buzz and Air Slash provide Yanma with two powerful STAB moves that hit Pokemon that don't resist them for solid damage. Air Slash also has a 30% flinch chance, which can come in handy once in a while. Protect allows Yanma to scout, beat Fake Out leads such as Ambipom, and gain a free boost of Speed if Speed Boost is the chosen ability. Hidden Power Ground is also an option, allowing Yanma to defeat Aggron, who would otherwise wall it, and hits Registeel and Regirock for at least super effective damage. Hypnosis is important so that Yanma can incapacitate a Pokemon that it cannot defeat directly. As for the choice of ability, Compound Eyes is very useful, increasing the accuracy of Hypnosis from 60% to 78% and Air Slash to perfect accuracy. Speed Boost is still a great ability, though, allowing Yanma to outspeed most Pokemon after just one turn, and defeat them before they can retaliate.</p> <p>Yanma's EV spread allows it to hit as hard as possible, while outrunning most common UU leads. The remaining 4 Defense EVs are filler, and even with the extra point in Defense, Yanma isn't able to stand up to even powerful neutral hits. Spiritomb is a major issue for Yanma, as it's able to take all of Yanma's attacks with ease and retaliate with a powerful STAB attack, such as Pursuit.</p> <p>Some common leads that Yanma can outspeed and put to sleep include Mesprit, Qwilfish, Cloyster, and most Uxie. Against faster leads such as Scyther, Yanma should use Hypnosis to incapacitate it before proceeding to attack. Focus Sash protects Yanma from being OHKOed, so you needn't worry about Yanma's well-being before it can successfully sleep the opposing lead. Alternatively, Yanma can use Protect to stall out a turn if packing Speed Boost, after which it can use Hypnosis without fear of sustaining major damage. Against faster leads who may Taunt Yanma, such as Mismagius, Yanma should switch out immediately to a counter. Unless Yanma can OHKO or 2HKO the opposing lead, Yanma should first use Hypnosis to severely cripple it. After the other lead has been incapacitated, Yanma can proceed to batter the opponent's team with its powerful attacks.</p> <p>Chansey and Clefable are good teammates for Yanma, as both are capable of outspeeding Spiritomb and able to take it on with Toxic. Chansey is also able to set up Stealth Rock, which is very helpful for an offensive Pokemon such as Yanma. Hitmontop is an excellent teammate because of its access to Rapid Spin, which is able to rid your side of the field of Stealth Rock, giving Yanma the much needed ability to switch in repeatedly. Hitmontop can also defeat Pokemon that trouble Yanma, such as the special walls Chansey and Registeel. Finally, Milotic makes a great partner as it can switch into most Fire-types and Rhyperior with ease and threaten them out with STAB Surf. In return, Yanma can switch into Choice-locked Grass-type attacks aimed at Milotic.</p>"

  "Quagsire": {
    "overview": "<p>Quagsire has a great defensive typing and an excellent support movepool, but what really sets Quagsire apart from the other standard UU bulky Water-types, such as Milotic and Slowbro, is its ability, Water Absorb. Having Water Absorb allows Quagsire to take on threats like Choice Band Azumarill and Swords Dance Feraligatr without the fear of eating boosted Water-type moves. Another advantage Quagsire boasts over its fellow Water-types is an immunity to Electric-type moves, making it a good counter to Choiced Magneton and Rotom locked into Thunderbolt. Quagsire also has access to Encore, giving it the advantage of being able to ruin any Pokemon that attempts to set up or use supporting moves; this makes up for Quagsire's lack of offensive power, and prevents it from becoming complete set up bait.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Quagsire has a variety of alternative options available. Counter is an option to surprise powerful physical attackers that often fail to KO Quagsire in one shot. Body Slam is available if you wish to abuse its 30% paralysis rate, which could be helpful for crippling faster opponents. Finally, Quagsire is one of the few Pokemon with the move Haze; however, while it may be helpful for removing stat boosts, Quagsire is outclassed by Pokemon such as Weezing and Milotic in this respect. You may choose to use Surf on the Bulky Water set, as it hits Rhyperior and Donphan harder than Waterfall, although Quagsire would then need to use a Relaxed nature, allowing Slowbro to almost always outpace it.</p> <p>If status moves are a major problem for your team, Quagsire may run a set of Curse, Waterfall, Rest, and Sleep Talk. This allows Quagsire to set up on and remain healthy against opponents that rely on status-inducing moves to wear down Quagsire, such as Weezing. Waterfall is the attacking move of choice, as it gives Quagsire a great STAB attack that nothing is immune to (outside of Pokemon with Water Absorb or Dry Skin and Shedinja).</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Grass-type Pokemon are great counters for Quagsire, as they are able to hit it for 4x super effective damage while also resisting Quagsire's STAB moves. Venusaur is the best counter to any Quagsire set; Sleep Powder and Power Whip both cripple Quagsire beyond repair. Tangrowth makes another great counter to all sets, as it takes little damage from Ice Punch while being able to KO Quagsire with Power Whip. Outside of Grass-types, bulky Water-types cause problems for Quagsire since it is unable to deal great amounts of damage to such foes with any of its moves. Blastoise and Milotic are great options, as they are able to switch in on any of Quagsire's moves and proceed to poison it with Toxic or hit it with Hidden Power Grass, with Milotic being the better of the two as it can Recover until Quagsire is unable to survive the damage from poison. All bulky Water-types that lack Rest need to watch out for Quagsire's own Toxic, however, as it could potentially cripple them for the remainder of the battle.</p> <p>Weezing and Mismagius make great counters to Quagsire, as they can both switch into Earthquake without worry thanks to Levitate and proceed to burn it with Will-O-Wisp. When Quagsire's Attack stat is reduced from burn status, frail sweepers such as Alakazam and Absol can switch in and set up. Quagsire can be beaten by most Encore users; Jumpluff and Clefable are the most reliable in this regard. They can switch in and use Encore as Quagsire uses Curse or Recover, forcing Quagsire to switch out. This also gives a free turn for Jumpluff to set up Leech Seed or Clefable to set up Stealth Rock. Clefable also has the advantage of being able to switch in on Toxic, as its Magic Guard ability prevents damage from harmful status effects.</p> <p>Pokemon with Trick can spell doom for Quagsire. Rotom is a great choice, sporting an immunity to Earthquake. This allows Rotom to switch to a Pokemon that doesn't mind the move Quagsire is using, then set up for free as Quagsire switches out. Clefable is another excellent option, as it is able to switch its Toxic or Flame Orb with Quagsire's Leftovers and cripple Quagsire for the remainder of the match.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wall": {
        "description": "<p>Quagsire makes an excellent defensive Pokemon due to its great typing and ability. Thanks to its Water / Ground typing, Quagsire has resistances to Fire-, Poison-, Rock-, and Steel-type moves, immunities to Electric- and Water-type moves (due to Water Absorb), and a lone 4x weakness to Grass-type moves. With Recover and its high HP and Defense stats, Quagsire is able to stall out opponents and take repeated hits without trouble. During this time, Quagsire can support its teammates and cripple opposing Pokemon with its great support options. Earthquake and Waterfall provide reliable STAB attacks and have good type coverage together, netting solid damage on most of the UU tier. Alternatively, Stone Edge may be used to hit Flying-types harder, though the only notable ones that Waterfall does not already hit for at least neutral damage are Mantine and Altaria.</p> <p>The EVs listed focus on Quagsire's higher defensive stat. 252 EVs in HP give Quagsire the highest possible overall bulk, while max Defense EVs are a must, allowing Quagsire to survive some of the most powerful physical assaults in the tier with little trouble. The remaining EVs are placed into Attack, giving Quagsire's attacks a small boost in power.</p> <p>Quagsire encounters major problems when faced with Grass-type Pokemon, as they are able to exploit its 4x weakness with their STAB attacks and OHKO it while switching in with near impunity thanks to their resistances to both of Quagsire's STAB moves. Flying-types, such as Altaria, are great partners for Quagsire, as they resist Grass-type moves. Altaria also has the ability Natural Cure, allowing it to absorb status moves aimed at Quagsire and be cured upon switching out. Moltres is another option to pair with Quagsire, as it can switch into Grass attacks with ease and threaten to OHKO opposing Grass-types with its STAB Fire- and Flying-type moves. Moltres's 4x Stealth Rock weakness should be taken into account, however, as it cannot switch in nearly as freely without Rapid Spin support.</p>"
      },
      "Curse": {
        "description": "<p>Quagsire has access to an overlooked stat-boosting move, Curse, which allows it to boost its average Attack and Defense stats. A base 65 Special Defense stat doesn't look too impressive at first glance, but with immunities to the commonly used Electric- and Water-type moves and only one weakness in Grass-type attacks, Quagsire can be tough to take down after a few boosts from Curse. After a couple of Curses, Quagsire becomes a fearsome tank, capable of tearing holes in any Pokemon that don't resist or aren't immune to its STAB Earthquake. Curse is a given on this set to boost Quagsire's Attack and Defense, Recover allows Quagsire to restore half of its HP in a single turn, and Earthquake and Waterfall provide Quagsire with powerful STAB moves that hit most threats in UU for at least neutral damage. Stone Edge can be used over Waterfall to hit Flying-types for super effective damage, but Waterfall provides better overall type coverage.</p> <p>The EVs on this set focus on Quagsire's Special Defense stat. 252 HP EVs give Quagsire a large amount of bulk and allow it to survive both physical and special moves with little trouble. Max Special Defense is a must to allow Quagsire to survive most neutral special attacks aimed at it. The remaining EVs are placed into Attack to give Quagsire a small boost in power.</p> <p>Again, Grass-types are an obstacle for Quagsire, meaning Flying- and Fire-types, such as Altaria and Moltres, are needed to remove these threats before Quagsire can safely set up. Scyther is another good option to destroy Grass-types thanks to its STAB Bug- and Flying-type moves and resistance to Grass-type attacks. Weezing is a problem for this set as well, since Will-O-Wisp can cripple Quagsire and render all of its attacking options worthless. To ensure this doesn't happen, Houndoom is a great addition to your team, being able to switch in on Will-O-Wisp, net a Flash Fire boost, and instantly OHKO Weezing with Fire Blast.</p> <p>Drapion makes an excellent partner for Quagsire, as it can absorb Toxic Spikes set up by the opponent while being able to set up its own; this helps Quagsire by crippling walls such as Slowbro and Tangrowth. Drapion's typing also makes it an ideal switch-in to most Grass-types, though it should beware of Venusaur's Earthquake. Funnily enough, Venusaur is another good option, as it can absorb Toxic Spikes on the switch-in, then proceed to cripple the opposing Pokemon with Sleep Powder.</p>"

  "Espeon": {
    "overview": "<p>Espeon has high Speed and Special Attack, making her an excellent sweeper and Baton Passer. Access to great support moves such as Wish, Baton Pass, Reflect, Light Screen, and Trick make her an excellent teammate, especially when she can easily lure in special walls onto whom she can Trick her Choice item. Synchronize deters status users from attempting to cripple Espeon, as the same status will also be inflicted on them. Espeon's major downfall is her horrible Defense, making her vulnerable to physical Dark-type moves, particularly Pursuit and Sucker Punch. Although Espeon faces stiff competition from Alakazam, Baton Pass and Wish make her a unique Psychic-type who can support the team while still dishing out powerful attacks. When using Espeon, just be sure to cover her weaknesses and avoid Pursuit users, and you'll find you have a powerful and useful Pokemon on your hands.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Most of Espeon's useful options have already been mentioned, though she can use a few other moves to some degree of success. Fake Tears is helpful for forcing switches, and Pokemon who stay in face a powerful hit from one of Espeon's coverage moves. Charm also forces switches, and lowering the opponent's Attack cushions Espeon on the physical side. Heal Bell may be used on any of the sets mentioned to remove status, though Espeon would have to sacrifice an essential move. Finally, Psych Up allows Espeon to steal the stat boosts of opposing Pokemon and then proceed to Baton Pass them to her teammates.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The best way to counter Espeon is with a Dark-type such as Spiritomb and Drapion, who are both immune to Espeon's STAB Psychic-type attacks and have STAB Dark-type moves like Pursuit at their disposal. Chansey and Registeel are both good options thanks to their huge Special Defense, good typing, and decent support movepools. If entry hazards are on the field, beware of boosted Hidden Power; in this case, a revenge killer such as Swellow is recommended to take out Espeon. Dugtrio can use its ability to trap Espeon and KO her with Night Slash, while faster versions of Espeon can be hit with Sucker Punch. Finally, Sucker Punch in general is a major problem for any Espeon, bypassing her Speed and hitting her super effectively. Common users of STAB Sucker Punch include mixed Houndoom and Absol.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "EspyJump (Baton Pass)": {
        "description": "<p>This is Espeon's signature set, featuring the factors that set her apart from other Psychic-types such as Alakazam and Uxie. Calm Mind and Baton Pass, combined with Espeon's excellent Speed, make her an ideal Baton Pass user. Substitute protects her from status, while Psychic offers a way to hit the opposing Pokemon with a powerful STAB move. The idea behind this set is to switch into a Pokemon whom Espeon can force out and proceed to set up a Substitute. If the opponent sends in a wall Espeon cannot damage, simply pass the Substitute to a teammate. When the opponent runs out of Espeon counters, either attempt a sweep with Calm Mind boosts, or pass the boosts to a sweeper with better coverage.</p> <p>216 Speed EVs ensure that Espeon outspeeds positive-natured Scyther and Mismagius, allowing her to Baton Pass before taking a hit. Maximum HP is used to give Espeon more bulk, enabling her to sponge special hits more easily. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense, helping Espeon set up on weak special attackers such as Lanturn.</p> <p>Ambipom and Drapion are both troublesome due to their high Speed, access to Taunt, and, in Drapion's case, immunity to Psychic-type attacks. Bulky Ground- and Rock-types such as Donphan and Rhyperior are good options to defeat these threats, as they can switch in with little difficulty and set up Stealth Rock; Rhyperior can even begin a potential sweep with Rock Polish or Swords Dance.</p> <p>Chansey and Registeel are difficult to break through with this Espeon, making mixed sweepers and Fighting-types excellent partners. Magmortar and Blaziken can take advantage of Calm Mind, while Substitute grants them an easier time switching in. Fighting-types, such as Hariyama and Hitmonchan, appreciate Substitute, as it blocks status and helps them set up Focus Punch. Moltres is another good receiver of Calm Mind since it is unable to raise its own Special Attack, and its access to Agility turns Moltres into a dangerous threat who is difficult to revenge kill. Magneton is another option; it has great defensive synergy with Espeon, taking Dark-, Ghost-, and Bug-type attacks directed at her with ease.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>This set also utilizes Baton Pass, though it's played much more offensively, foregoing Substitute for a second attacking move. Espeon has enough power to 2HKO Registeel with Hidden Power Ground after a single Calm Mind boost, although Spikes support is needed to guarantee this. Hidden Power Ground is mainly used to KO Drapion and Houndoom, two dangerous Dark-types who threaten Espeon. Psychic is Espeon's best STAB attack, dealing immense damage to most opposing Pokemon after a boost or two. In the final slot, Baton Pass is used to escape Pursuit users while also passing Calm Mind boosts to Espeon's teammates. Two alternatives in the last slot are Shadow Ball, which hits Ghost- and Psychic-types super effectively, and Signal Beam, which hits Dark- and Psychic-types. Grass Knot is yet another option in the last slot and it deals more damage to heavy Pokemon, such as Milotic and Rhyperior.</p> <p>216 Speed EVs enable Espeon to outrun positive-natured Mismagius and Scyther, allowing her to hit them with a powerful attack or escape from them with Baton Pass before they can move. Max Special Attack is vital for a sweeper, making Espeon as deadly as possible. The remaining EVs are placed into HP to give Espeon a little more bulk. Espeon may use Substitute on this set, though she loses a valuable coverage move in doing this. If you do choose to go down that route, a spread of 8 HP / 248 SpA / 252 Spe with Leftovers instead of Life Orb is recommended, as it allows Espeon to make 5 Substitutes (provided she doesn't take any damage beforehand).</p> <p>Entry hazards are helpful on this set, helping to weaken opponents and increase the chance of a KO. A good example of a target who is defeated more easily with entry hazard support is Registeel; with a single layer of Spikes, Espeon will 2HKO it with a +1 Hidden Power Ground. Stealth Rock is also helpful as it cripples Moltres and other Pokemon who are weak to it. Qwilfish and Cloyster are good choices to set up Spikes, while Donphan and Omastar are good options to supply Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Although Espeon is boosting her Special Attack, she still has trouble with Chansey and her infinite fatness. Fighting-types, such as Hitmontop, are the easy answer to this problem because they hit Chansey super effectively with their STAB moves in her weaker defensive stat. Mixed sweepers are also effective, luring her in with special attacks and hitting her hard physically. Magmortar and Blaziken are both excellent mixed attackers who appreciate boosts from Calm Mind. Spiritomb is another dreadful counter to Espeon, as it is immune to Psychic and has access to Pursuit and Sucker Punch. To get past Spiritomb, Toxic Spikes may be set up to wear him down, while Fire-types can switch in rather freely, as they are immune to its Will-O-Wisp; Blaziken does especially well, as he even has a resistance to Dark-type attacks.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>Espeon's high Speed and access to Wish make her a great dual screen user. Since she's a Psychic-type, common Brick Break users (mostly Fighting-types) will avoid Espeon like the plague, as they risk eating a super effective Psychic if they attempt to shatter the screens. Reflect is usually the first move Espeon should make, raising Espeon's average Defense and helping her against Pursuit users. After Reflect, Espeon should proceed with Light Screen, then switch to a teammate who can set up. Psychic is used as a reliable STAB move, while Baton Pass allows Espeon to scout and escape from Pursuit users without taking damage.</p> <p>This Espeon runs enough Speed to beat positive-natured Mismagius and Scyther, hitting them or escaping from them with Baton Pass before they have the chance to attack. Maximum HP gives Espeon some much needed bulk, while the remaining EVs are placed into Defense, allowing Espeon to take physical hits better. Leftovers may be used in the item slot to restore health, though the extra turns of dual screens that Light Clay provides are preferred.</p> <p>With dual screen support, a variety of frail sweepers now have an easier time to shine. With boosted defenses, you may run more risky strategies like Belly Drum Linoone and Charizard; make sure you have Rapid Spin support when using Charizard, though. Nasty Plot Mismagius is another good choice, as she appreciates the boosted Defense from Reflect when using Nasty Plot to make her Special Attack skyrocket to insane levels. Finally, Swords Dance Drapion is a dangerous threat after a boost or two, and even survives Dugtrio's Earthquake behind Reflect. Bulky Substitute users are also excellent choices, as their Substitutes will be almost impossible to break behind screens. Hariyama, Poliwrath, and Azumarill are all fine choices.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<p>Espeon is fast, frail, and hits like a truck, so a Substitute + 3 Attacks set is a natural choice. Having three attacks instead of two upgrades Espeon's type coverage substantially, which alleviates the need to boost her Special Attack in order to beat bulkier Pokemon. Since Espeon forces many Pokemon to switch out, setting up a Substitute should always be her first priority. Substitute also helps to ease prediction, allowing Espeon to fire off the optimal attack twice against slower Pokemon. Furthermore, Substitute shields Espeon from Dark-type switch-ins eager to trap her with Pursuit or nail her with Sucker Punch. While Spiritomb remains a threat, Drapion and Houndoom who lack HP or Special Defense investment will be OHKOed by Hidden Power Ground after Stealth Rock, and Skuntank is likely to meet the same fate.</p> <p>Espeon has a number of viable attacks in her arsenal, but the combination of Psychic and Hidden Power Ground gives the best core type coverage. Unlike in the OU environment, STAB Psychic can steamroll many Pokemon in UU, where only a handful resist it. Hidden Power Ground 2HKOes Steelix, and scores OHKOs on Aggron and the aforementioned Dark-types after Stealth Rock damage. Shadow Ball is the preferred attack to round out the set, but Signal Beam is also a viable option depending on which Pokemon you want Espeon to hit. Shadow Ball roughs up Slowking, Uxie, and Mesprit, who would otherwise shrug off Espeon's attacks. It also allows Espeon to OHKO Mismagius, which she fails to do with Psychic even after Stealth Rock damage. Signal Beam allows Espeon to hit pure Dark-types such as Absol super effectively, though it doesn't have much use outside of that, as Shadow Ball covers all the same types. Grass Knot scores a very important 2HKO on all common Milotic variants, OHKOes Rhyperior and Donphan, and hits Spiritomb for 100 Base Power. All three options nail Slowbro and Claydol for super effective damage. As the above examples demonstrate, having Stealth Rock support is absolutely imperative for Espeon to achieve several key OHKOs.</p> <p>In UU, this set struggles to avoid being overshadowed by Alakazam, whose higher Speed and access to Focus Blast give him an edge over Espeon. There are, however, several advantages to running this Espeon set. The most obvious difference is in defensive stats, as Espeon is significantly bulkier than Alakazam; however, this is strictly relative, since Espeon is still moderately fragile by objective standards. Another difference is that opponents will initially anticipate Espeon's trademark Baton Pass set, which may cause them to inadvertently put a Pokemon such as Encore Clefable or Haze Milotic in the line of fire. Additionally, using this set in tandem with Alakazam is also an option. Alakazam makes a great anti-lead whom can prevent entry hazards from being set up, and can also lure out Espeon's counters so that you can plot a way to destroy them before revealing Espeon.</p> <p>Not many Pokemon can handle Espeon once she is hiding behind a Substitute; Registeel and Chansey are the two main exceptions to this. Standard Registeel avoids being 3HKOed by any attack, although it won't enjoy frequently switching in without reliable recovery, while Rest variants and Chansey can wall Espeon to Timbuktu and back with ease. Spiritomb can be added to the counters list under most circumstances, and is Espeon's most immediately threatening counter since it commonly carries Pursuit. However, Choice Band variants must be at full health to avoid a 2HKO from Grass Knot, and even then there is a small chance of it occurring. Specially defensive variants, especially those with Pursuit and a priority move, fare the best and will force Espeon to flee while she still has her Substitute up. Espeon's teammates should definitely aim to take advantage of these three Pokemon, as they are really the only three surefire counters to this Espeon in UU. Blaziken walks all over these Pokemon, and can set up with Swords Dance or Agility while Espeon's counter flees. Dugtrio makes an amazing partner as well, as he can trap and KO Registeel and Chansey, opening the door for Espeon to wreak havoc. Substitute Rhyperior can also set up on all three aforementioned counters and proceed to hammer the opposing team with its powerful STAB moves.</p> <p>Between Substitute and Life Orb damage, Espeon won't be sticking around for long, so it is important to preserve what little health she does have. Entry hazards take their toll quickly, as do most attacks. Therefore, it is important to pair Espeon with Pokemon who can get her free switches. U-turn users, such as Scyther and Primeape, will lure out Pokemon like Weezing and Donphan, both of whom Espeon can set up on easily. If you can fit Wish support onto your team, do so by all means, as it will greatly increase Espeon's lifespan. Clefable can use Wish and torture Registeel and Chansey with Encore, making her a solid teammate.</p>"
      },
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>Espeon's high Speed and Special Attack make her a perfect candidate for Choice sets. Psychic is Espeon's main attack, providing a nice source of STAB. Hidden Power Ground hits Steel-types such as Aggron and Registeel, while also scoring super effective damage against Drapion and Houndoom. Baton Pass is a good scouting move which allows Espeon to escape Pursuit users such as Spiritomb and Drapion. Shadow Ball hits Psychic- and Ghost-types super effectively, while Signal Beam smashes Dark- and Psychic-types. Trick allows Espeon to cripple walls by giving them her Choice item; this can cause major problems for your opponent late-game when one of your sweepers attempts to set up.</p> <p>252 Speed allows Espeon to outrun positive-natured Mismagius and Scyther, giving her the opportunity to smack them with a powerful attack before they can move. Max Special Attack is used to deal as much damage as possible, and the remaining EVs are placed into HP. If Espeon is holding a Choice Scarf, 252 EVs and a Timid nature allow her to outspeed Adamant Kabutops in the rain. A Modest nature tends to work better with the Choice Scarf set, allowing Espeon to outrun Choice Scarf Rotom and crush it with Psychic.</p> <p>Being a specially-based Choice user, Espeon should have partners who can deal with Dark-types and special walls, especially Chansey and Registeel. Fighting-types such as Hariyama are good choices for teammates due to their super effective STAB moves against the aforementioned Pokemon and high Attack stats. Hitmontop is another good choice; he also has Foresight, enabling him to hit Spiritomb with his Fighting-type attacks. Dugtrio is a good option as well, trapping Chansey and Registeel with his Arena Trap ability and KOing them with Beat Up and Earthquake, respectively.</p>"

  "Murkrow": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite terrible defenses and a lack of overall power, Murkrow can often be a valuable team member. Possessing potent STAB moves and a fantastic ability in Insomnia, which allows him to switch into the common Venusaur's Sleep Powder, Murkrow has the potential to wreak the havoc that his evolution, Honchkrow, once did upon the tier. However, though faster than his evolution, Murkrow lacks the same raw power - he is not a Pokemon to simply throw onto a team as a wallbreaker. Indeed, Murkrow requires quite a bit of support to be effective.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Murkrow has multiple support moves, such as Whirlwind and Feather Dance, that are unfortunately unusable due to his extremely low defenses. However, Murkrow can make relatively good use of Substitute to ease prediction on switches, but Stealth Rock damage combined with Life Orb and Brave Bird recoil lead to a swift demise when taking into account the 25% health sacrifice for Substitute. Murkrow has access to Roost, but there is little time to use it, and time is much better spent using Brave Bird. A Lonely nature is possible, but Murkrow needs all the Speed he can get - indeed, it is Murkrow's redeeming factor. Murkrow can use Hidden Power Fighting to nail Aggron, but Hidden Power Grass is generally superior.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Though Life Orb Heat Wave can heavily damage it, Registeel easily survives and can cripple Murkrow with Thunder Wave or take a sizable portion of health simply with Iron Head. Steelix, although he has lower Special Defense, performs in the same way as Registeel, though he lacks Thunder Wave. Rotom is also a great counter as defensive variants can neuter Murkrow with paralysis or a burn. If outspeeding Murkrow is not possible, strong priority moves, such as Aqua Jet from Azumarill, can also deal with Murkrow. Be warned, however, that Sucker Punch will still strike and inflict decent damage. Milotic makes a decent counter - though not able to switch into repeated Brave Birds, she can use Recover to negate the damage.</p>",

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>Though by far not the most powerful wallbreaker in the tier, Murkrow makes up for his mediocre Attack with powerful STAB moves in Brave Bird and Sucker Punch. Heat Wave dents Registeel and Steelix switch-ins, while Hidden Power Grass 2HKOes Omastar and Rhyperior. Despite the fact that Life Orb adds even more passive damage in addition to Brave Bird recoil and Stealth Rock, it is needed to bolster Murkrow's lackluster Attack.</p> <p>The EVs listed are simple - Attack is maxed to grant Murkrow as much power as possible, and maxing Speed allows him to outspeed the common base 80 Pokemon in the tier, such as Venusaur, whom Murkrow can OHKO with Brave Bird. Due to Murkrow's generally low damage output, however, entry hazard support is almost a necessity - after Spikes and Stealth Rock damage, Pokemon other than dedicated walls or those with resistances to Murkrow's STAB moves will find it difficult to avoid a 2HKO.</p> <p>Murkrow is best compared to Swellow, one of the most powerful sweepers in the tier, with access to Guts to boost his own Brave Bird. The factor that stops Murkrow from being outclassed by Swellow is his decent Special Attack, which, for instance, allows him to 2HKO Omastar and Rhyperior, two Pokemon whom Swellow can never break without the help of his teammates. Murkrow also has a strong priority move in Sucker Punch, which can super effectively hit threats such as Scarf Rotom, against whom Swellow would be helpless. He plays a very different role than other wallbreakers such as Kabutops and Blaziken - the latter seek to break through the cores of teams with brute force and high coverage, while Murkrow makes good use of his relatively high Speed to pick off weakened threats and dent switch-ins for other Pokemon to defeat.</p>"

  "Slowking": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite facing stiff competition from its cousin Slowbro, Slowking stands strong thanks to its excellent special bulk. Plus, its access to Nasty Plot allows it to quickly go on the offensive. Instant recovery in the form of Slack Off only adds to Slowking's credentials as a top-tier UU bulky Water-type, and despite its poor Speed stat, it can play various roles effectively. However, weaknesses to Electric, Grass, Bug, Ghost, and Dark are not very appealing, and that's the main reason why Slowking usually gets the shaft in favor of other special walls like Chansey. Nevertheless, Slowking's Special Attack is higher than Chansey's, and its array of special attacks is much wider, making it capable of hitting its counters harder. If your team is ever in need of an all-purpose wall that is capable of attacking back, then Slowking is just right for you.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Slowking has a rather large special movepool, although most of it isn't suitable for UU play. The most interesting special attacks include Flamethrower, Fire Blast, Grass Knot, and Focus Blast. Sadly, Flamethrower and Fire Blast are the only valuable moves as they can hit Registeel for more damage than Surf, but are essentially useless besides that. Registeel cannot do much back to Slowking anyway, other than use Toxic, Thunder Wave, or Explosion, meaning that it is often a wasted moveslot. Grass Knot can give a world of hurt to Omastar, Quagsire, and Kabutops that would usually try and set up on Slowking, although outside of that it does not have many uses as it fails to do significant damage to other Water-types. Focus Blast is a shaky option simply because of its unwelcoming accuracy and the poor coverage it provides with Slowking's STAB moves. Yawn is an interesting option for Slowking because it can cause an unsuspecting opponent to switch and reveal other members of the opponent's team.</p> <p>Support-wise, Slowking gets a few noteworthy moves. Light Screen can be used to further increase Slowking's large Special Defense and can provide overall team support. Psych Up is an interesting option to steal boosts from a stat booster like Calm Mind Slowbro. Curse can be utilized pretty effectively thanks to Slowking's relatively high base Special Defense and the fact that Curse will boost its average Defense stat. Although Slowking has a rather pitiful base 75 Attack stat, a few Curses can make Slowking a rather terrifying sweeper. However, due to the absence of Waterfall from Slowking's movepool, it must rely on the shaky accuracy of Aqua Tail. The lack of a reliable way to cure itself of status is another reason why Slowking is rarely seen carrying Curse.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Generally, the best counter to Slowking is Toxic. The likelihood of Slowking running Rest is extremely low, meaning that Toxic can slowly deplete Slowking's health. Chansey comes out as the number one counter to Slowking, as it is able to take any attack easily and cripple Slowking with Toxic, although it should watch out for Trick. Grass-types are usually a safe bet to defeat Slowking, specifically Exeggutor. Exeggutor resists both Surf and Psychic, and can retaliate with a powerful Power Whip or Leaf Storm. Although it takes quite some damage from Psychic, Venusaur can switch in on Surf and Toxic with ease, and either render Slowking useless with Sleep Powder or smack it with Power Whip or Leaf Storm. Dark-types such as Absol and Drapion can switch in on a predicted Psychic, and threaten with Dark-type attacks. Clefable falls in the same category as Chansey, as it has the special bulk to take repeated hits well enough, although it should steer clear of Nasty Plot variants. It also has access to Encore, allowing it to lock Slowking into a single move and switch to an appropriate counter or begin setting up. Basically, any Pokemon that can hit hard with a super effective move and outspeed Slowking can easily deal with it as long as they avoid being afflicted with status.</p>",

      "Bulky Water": {
        "description": "<p>With access to instant-recovery in the form of Slack Off, useful resistances to Fire, Water, Ice, Fighting, and Psychic, and solid overall bulk, Slowking can become a sturdy wall that is capable of blocking many of UU's largest threats, such as Azumarill and Hitmonlee. Slowking also has the additional benefit of always being able to take on Blaziken, something that other bulky Waters cannot always claim.</p> <p>This set allows Slowking to alternate between replenishing its health and attacking, or inflicting status on an opposing Pokemon and stalling. Surf from Slowking's base 100 Special Attack stat provides a solid STAB attack that hits the majority of the metagame neutrally, and Psychic provides good coverage alongside it, as well as dealing with Fighting- and Poison-types. Ice Beam is a valuable alternative over Psychic for super effectively hitting Grass- and Flying-types. Psychic, however, is the better choice if one is concerned about Venusaur. Slack Off makes sure that Slowking can keep switching in throughout the game. Finally on the last slot, Toxic is usually the preferred choice, as it allows Slowking to slowly weaken other bulky Pokemon such as Milotic and Blastoise, though Thunder Wave does have its merit against hyper-offensive teams by crippling fast switch-ins such as Mismagius, Scyther, and Sceptile. Thunder Wave also allows your sweepers to have an easier time plowing through the opponent's crippled team.</p> <p>The EV spread allows Slowking to function as an effective mixed wall, being able to take both physical and special attacks. With 144 Defense EVs, Slowking can more comfortably take on Altaria's +1 Outrage, Ambipom's Return, and Donphan's Earthquake, while with 112 SpD, Slowking is never 2HKOed from Moltres's Hidden Power Grass, +0 Leftovers Mismagius's Shadow Ball, and Lanturn's Thunderbolt. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with the same Calm nature can be considered so that Slowking is never 2HKOed by +2 Curse Miltank's Return, Choice Band Azumarill's and Kangaskhan's Return, and +1 Feraligatr's Earthquake. However, Slowking's value as a special wall will slightly diminish and you'd be better off using Slowbro if your goal is a physically defensive Water-type.</p> <p>Slowking appreciates Pokemon that can cover its five weaknesses and benefit from the status it spreads around. Nidoking and Venusaur make good offensive partners for Slowking by covering its Electric- and Bug- or Grass-type weaknesses, respectively, and having the tools to sustain offensive pressure upon the opponent. Both Pokemon also love Thunder Wave support from Slowking to make up for their average Speed. Defensively, Chansey and Clefable are valuable choices to consider, especially since their Fighting weaknesses are covered by Slowking. If Slowking has Toxic, it is likely to cripple most bulky switch-ins with ease; as such, the aforementioned Pokemon can help by stalling the opponents with their great bulk and access to Encore (for Clefable) and Wish. Suffice to say, Slowking appreciates support against Chansey and Clefable as well, as they will wall it to no end. As such, Fighting-type Pokemon like Toxicroak and Hitmonlee make great partners as they can eliminate the special walls in a single swoop. Lastly, Steelix can make a splendid defensive core with Slowking as they cover each other's weaknesses well, with the exception of Ground and Grass. Also, Steelix is capable of taking the physical attacks aimed at Slowking, while Slowking takes the special attacks aimed at Steelix.</p>"

      "Defensive Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Slowking and Slowbro share a lot of things in common, and one of these is the ability to set up Trick Room. When opting for one of them on a Trick Room team, it is important to choose the right one for your team's needs, as both do have their advantages. Despite Slowbro being chosen more often over its sibling, mostly due to its higher physical bulk being better suited for the metagame, Slowking does possess the ability to come in on special attackers more easily.</p> <p>Surf and Psychic have perfect coverage in the UU metagame, outside of Shiftry, Cacturne, Exeggutor, Shedinja, Slowbro, Sharpedo, Crawdaunt, and opposing Slowking. Slack Off allows Slowking to come in and use Trick Room multiple times, which is a great asset to have in a Trick Room supporter since the field effect lasts for only five turns. The way this set works is simple: switch into a Pokemon that cannot severely hurt Slowking, such as a bulky Water-type, and set up Trick Room. Afterward, switch in a Trick Room sweeper resistant to the opponent's attacks and thrash the opponent. A Sassy nature is beneficial to this set as it lowers Slowking's already poor Speed, and combined with a reduction of its IVs to 0, Slowking will outspeed almost every Pokemon in the metagame after Trick Room is set up.</p> <p>Good partners for this set are Pokemon that can make the most out of Trick Room, specifically slow and powerful bulky sweepers. Rhyperior and Marowak are both extremely threatening in this regard and have some limited type synergy with Slowking in that they can come in on predicted Electric attacks unscathed. However, because of the rarity of Electric-type attacks, and because of the shared crippling weakness to Grass, it's highly recommended to run a Pokemon that can come into Grass-type moves with little trouble alongside them. Exeggutor is a wonderful Trick Room partner as it resists Slowking's Electric and Grass weaknesses, can wreak havoc with Leaf Storm, sleep foes with Sleep Powder, and take down a threatening Pokemon with Explosion. Additionally, Exeggutor can reset Trick Room again in case it runs out of turns. Hariyama is another great partner, as with Close Combat at its disposal, it can demolish teams. It also has useful resistances to Dark and Bug.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Due to Slowking's bulk on both sides, ability to set up Trick Room, and high Special Attack, it is a prime candidate for an offensive Trick Room set. Unlike its counterpart, Slowbro, Slowking is able to quickly boost its Special Attack with Nasty Plot, distinguishing itself. Slowking's bulk allows it to come in on a wide array of Pokemon and set up Trick Room for its teammates, while also potentially allowing Slowking itself to sweep. Slowking's base 30 Speed enables it to \"outspeed\" almost every Pokemon in UU when under Trick Room, which makes sweeping easier. After a single Nasty Plot, Slowking reaches a beastly 658 Special Attack, making it more than capable of tearing through teams that lack Chansey. Psychic and Surf are STAB moves that provide excellent coverage in UU. Life Orb is equipped since Slowking appreciates the extra power to turn 2HKOs into OHKOs. In addition, Slowking actually has a chance to 2HKO Chansey with a +2 Surf after Stealth Rock damage, which is an impressive feat.</p> <p>Since this set is Trick Room based, minimum Speed is recommended for Slowking to outspeed almost everything in the metagame once Trick Room is set up. A Quiet nature helps lower Slowking's Speed, while also boosting its Special Attack. Although Slowking's Water / Psychic typing is primarily advantageous, it does cause some trouble at times. Dark-types such as Drapion and Absol are often seen switching in on Slowking and posing an immediate threat. It is therefore best to pair Slowking with a Pokemon that can handle both of these threats. Rhyperior is perhaps the best partner to aid Slowking against these threats. Not only does it take advantage of Slowking's Trick Room with its sluggish 40 base Speed, but it also has incredible physical bulk to cushion their attacks and the ability to OHKO both of them with a single Earthquake.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Although a bit of a novelty, Slowking sports the devastating Trick, which has the potential to cripple one of the most common Slowking switch-ins, Chansey, allowing it to viably run a Choice Specs set. Additionally, this set has the power to 2HKO Clefable, and Slowking's considerable bulk makes up for its lacking Speed, making it a very practical slow and powerful Choice Specs user.</p> <p>Surf and Psychic are staples on any Slowking set, as they provide great coverage in the UU metagame, which is an excellent quality for any Specs user to have since it makes prediction much less of an issue when you can just choose between Slowking's powerful STAB attacks and catch the switch-in. Choice Specs Psychic has the ability to OHKO Support Venusaur after Stealth Rock damage, as well as all Weezing variants. Trick is self-explanatory and is the real reason why this set is viable in UU, although it is not advisable to use it before scouting the opponent's team, as Slowking may end up giving Choice Specs to Pokemon such as Venusaur or Mismagius. Slowking also runs the risk of receiving an unfavorable item in return, such as a Choice Band from Spiritomb; afterward, Spiritomb can trap and remove Slowking with Pursuit as it switches out. Slack Off keeps Slowking alive for a longer period of time once it has Tricked an opposing Pokemon.</p> <p>Complements to this specific set should be Pokemon that can take advantage of special walls locked into a single move. Bulky special sweepers with Substitute and Calm Mind can often take advantage of a Choiced Chansey. Espeon is a nice offensive teammate, being able to boost up and sweep with its high base Speed. Similarly, Nasty Plot Houndoom is able to decimate locked special walls after it gets the necessary boosts. Slowking also complements Houndoom defensively, taking Water-type attacks with ease. Of course, it is important to take into account common switch-ins to Slowking, such as Mismagius and Rotom, which can be quite problematic after receiving Choice Specs as a result of Trick. For the aforementioned common switch-ins, packing a Pursuit user such as Skuntank or Drapion can be useful to remove the Ghosts.</p>"

His most powerful move, Hidden Power, rips through Magikarp, Hoppip, and Feebas with its unimaginable power, 2HKOing and OHKOing Magikarp and Hoppip with Hidden Power Ice, respectively. A neutral Hidden Power gives Feebas the ol' one-two-hit KO. When facing such opponents, Unown is unbeatable.</p> <p>As if this wasn't proof enough of Unown's superiority, Hidden Power Ice OHKOs Flygon. Transporting to prehistoric ages, Unown can 2HKO the powerful T-rex, Tyranitar, with Hidden Power Fighting. And going even higher up on the evolutionary ladder, Groudon is 2HKOed by Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p>Supporting Unown is essential, for it performs best in an environment with which it is comfortable. As Unown can sometimes get temperamental when dropped into a situation outside of what it is used to (caves, incest), it is wise to pair Unown with familiar environmental hazards. Stealth Rock can be set in play by Donphan and Jigglypuff. Dual screens are also helpful, as they remind Unown of the old, mysterious days, steeling him against attacks. Uxie, Mesprit, and Mewtwo are excellent choices.</p> <p>A Dugtrio is a popular choice for befriending your Unown. They often reminisce about caving, and if Dugtrio is feeling particularly adventurous, Unown can explore Dugtrio's lower half. In return, Dugtrio traps Chansey, who otherwise walls Unown, and 2HKOs her with Earthquake.</p> <p>Having a Normal-type on your team also helps; as Unown has been secluded for thousands of years, it needs a normal Pokemon to teach it the ropes in today's modern world. Chansey is a magnificent choice; it is immune to Ghost-type moves such as Shadow Ball that threaten Unown. Chansey also supplies paralysis support, which raises Unown's low self-esteem about its Speed.</p> <p>Fighting-types like Hitmonlee and Machop will help toughen Unown up; they will also take Dark-type moves for it. Scarf Primeape can come in and scare Dark-type Pokemon out with Close Combat, but he can't take multiple hits well.</p> <p>Being an outcast, Unown is oft a target for Pursuit. To help Unown feel less insecure and lonely, it is suggested to pair it with a teammate that allows you to get a free Swords Dance, Calm Mind, or Nasty Plot in, while at the same time not take too much from a switch-less Pursuit. Superb choices are Lucario, Suicune, and Darkrai.</p> <p>Taking care of Unown is difficult, but ultimately worthwhile. With the right care and attention, it will grow into a wonderful Pokemon. Good luck in your endeavor--we wish you the best!</p>"

  "Girafarig": {
    "overview": "<p>From an evolutionary point of view, you would think that Girafarig is at an advantage due to its additional head. However, having two heads only provides the giraffe with a decent base 90 Special Attack, and those stone-hard hoofs can only march so far with its average base 85 Speed. Its laughable defenses, coupled with the fact that its Normal / Psychic typing provides almost no resistances, means that you've got yourself a completely ludicrous Pokemon. On the bright side, Girafarig is at least fast and strong enough to tangle with some of UU's forces. With an absolutely vast movepool consisting of moves such as Thunderbolt, Sucker Punch, Baton Pass, and Calm Mind, Girafarig can damage a wide variety of opponents while passing along possibly game-changing stat boosts to a suitable partner. Girafarig is also the only Psychic-type Pokemon in the game that is immune to Ghost-type attacks. While new players ought to avoid using Girafarig at all costs, veterans and other practiced individuals may have a blast when utilizing Girafarig's unique perks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>For such a sad Pokemon, Girafarig surprisingly has some nice other options; however, it cannot utilize most of these moves effectively. Wish is usable, but Girafarig is unlikely to be able to pull it off due to its terrible defenses and bad typing. You would think that Girafarig could set up dual screens to support the team, but when attacks from Pokemon such as Choice Band Hitmonlee still 2HKO it, you are often better off with another dual screens user. Girafarig has access to fun field support moves such as Gravity and Trick Room and actually has the Speed to pull them off. Thunder Wave is available to spread around paralysis. A full physical moveset with Life Orb or Choice Band and Zen Headbutt, Sucker Punch, Earthquake, and Return could work; with an Adamant nature, Return does 57.9% - 68.2% to Chansey. However, once you get one hit in (that doesn't even OHKO, mind you), the surprise is over, and a physical wall such as Steelix will ruin the fun.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Girafarig is actually hard to counter due to Baton Pass, but otherwise, it's a piece of cake. The best initial switch-ins consist of Dark-types with decent special bulk and great Speed. Drapion and Houndoom are wonderful counters to most Girafarig sets, as they can outspeed and KO Girafarig before it can escape. Slower Dark-types such as Spiritomb and Absol are still threatening to Girafarig, but they are easily eluded by Baton Pass. Registeel is a pest to Girafarig, as it can cripple Girafarig with Thunder Wave while taking boosted Hidden Power Fighting without too much trouble thanks to its excellent special bulk. Fast and powerful sweepers such as Sceptile, Scyther, and Kangaskhan will have no trouble OHKOing the giraffe with their respective STAB attacks. Chansey and Clefable are great at sponging basically all of Girafarig's attacks, and can strike back with multiple Seismic Tosses.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>With usable Speed and passable Special Attack, Girafarig can utilize an offensive Calm Mind set to varying degrees to success. After a Calm Mind boost, Girafarig reaches 418 Special Attack, which is generally enough to dish out some pain on the opposition. Together, Psychic and Thunderbolt hit every Pokemon in UU for at least neutral damage, except for Steelix, Magneton, Shedinja, Shiftry, Cacturne, and Exeggutor. The fourth slot depends on your preference. Baton Pass is recommended so that Girafarig can pass its Calm Mind boosts to a Pokemon better suited to sweep. Hidden Power Fighting deals with Steel-types such as Steelix, Magneton, and Registeel, although it leaves Girafarig with an imperfect Speed IV and the inability to outwit special walls, Shedinja, and Exeggutor. Shadow Ball covers Ghost- and Psychic-types such as the aforementioned Shedinja and Exeggutor.</p> <p>Do not panic when you see a slower Pursuit user, such as Absol or Spiritomb, switch in. If you decide to let Girafarig use Thunderbolt, you are risking a Sucker Punch to the face. It is safer to just use Baton Pass when such a threat switches in, because Pursuit, unlike U-turn, will not have priority over Baton Pass. Blaziken is a great receiver as it can counter Absol and Spiritomb, make good use of the Calm Mind boost via Fire Blast and Vacuum Wave, and keep the chain running with its own Baton Pass. Faster Pursuit users, particularly Drapion and Scyther, are a bit harder to handle; thus, if put in such a situation, it is best to scout by immediately using Baton Pass just in case your opponent has such a Pokemon. However, if they are already in, it's over for Girafarig.</p> <p>This Girafarig has trouble with physically inclined Pokemon that have more than base 85 Speed, such as Kangaskhan, Swellow, and Hitmonlee. If they switch in as Girafarig uses Calm Mind, they can begin wreaking havoc. Although not a physical attacker, Alakazam with Encore can also be irritating against this Girafarig. Choice Scarf Rotom can help protect Girafarig from Swellow and Hitmonlee due to its immunities to Normal- and Fighting-type attacks. Moreover, Rotom can switch in as Alakazam uses Encore and OHKO it with Shadow Ball. Against the physical attackers, Rotom can also use Will-O-Wisp on all these threats bar Swellow to soften their blows. Another ideal partner is Registeel, which can absorb most of Kangaskhan's, Alakazam's, and Swellow's assaults, and set up Stealth Rock in the process. Stealth Rock helps Girafarig obtain KOs that it wouldn't have gotten otherwise, so it is an important form of support to provide this Girafarig.</p>"
      },
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>At first glance, this set looks relaxing to the mind, as it revolves around simply picking the correct attack in the given scenario. However, it can be complex when predicting what moves your opponent is actually choosing. For starters, firing off Psychic is the logical choice as it deals the most damage out of all of Girafarig's moves against a neutral target. However, Thunderbolt should be used at first to neutrally cover a wider range of Pokemon. Grass Knot is an option over Thunderbolt to smack Spiritomb, Milotic, Omastar, and Rhyperior harder, but it has poor overall coverage when compared to Thunderbolt. Sucker Punch is Girafarig's selling point here, as it can strike weakened opponents before they can attack back. Hidden Power Fighting wraps up the coverage by hitting Dark- and Steel-types such as Absol and Registeel, respectively, for super effective damage.</p> <p>A Naive nature is recommended as the main option as it lessens Girafarig's vulnerability to physical priority attacks; moreover, most neutral special attacks would still 2HKO Girafarig even if its nature were Hasty. For instance, bulky Milotic's Surf deals 51.6% - 61.2% damage to Hasty Girafarig and SubPunch Azumarill's Aqua Jet manages 40.6% - 48% damage to Naive Girafarig. Natures aside, you can split the offensive EVs even more so that Sucker Punch can deal more damage, but most of the time, Stealth Rock will eliminate the need for this. 64 Attack EVs allow Sucker Punch to OHKO any Alakazam without any HP investment.</p> <p>Due to the wide coverage gained from four attacks, this Girafarig can be used as an attacking lead. Girafarig has the ability to beat some leads, though it is a little on the weak side. For example, Life Orb Psychic deals 95.2% - 112.4% damage to offensive Venusaur, Ambipom is beaten by a combination of Psychic and Sucker Punch, and 252 HP Omastar takes 82% - 96.5% damage from Thunderbolt (or 91.9% - 109.3% from Grass Knot). Energy Ball is an alternative over Grass Knot for the guaranteed OHKO on Omastar, but it deals less damage against Spiritomb leads. Both of Girafarig's abilities are extremely handy when it's leading: use Inner Focus to deal with Fake Out users, and use Early Bird to manage sleep leads. Focus Sash can be swapped over Life Orb so that Girafarig can survive a potential fatal attack. Also, switching from Naive to Rash can help improve the odds of KOing the enemy's lead; this is relatively safe, as there are not many leads that can outspeed Girafarig if it uses a Rash nature that wouldn't outspeed it anyway.</p> <p>This set is even more vulnerable to Pursuit users than the first set, due to the absence of Baton Pass. The best option is to double switch, which is sadly inferior to using Baton Pass due to the inability to scout what your opponent's switch-in actually is. Having an all-around general Pokemon with status moves to cover Girafarig's back in this case is recommended. Venusaur makes a good partner as it can sleep an opponent (hopefully the Pursuit user) while dishing out incredible damage with its STAB attacks. Registeel can usually block most of Girafarig's switch-ins with its excellent defensive stats and Steel typing. It can then cripple the opponent with Thunder Wave, which will allow Girafarig to outspeed the opponent on the next encounter. If a Pursuit user seals Girafarig's fate, then take advantage of the opponent with a Dark-type resistant Pokemon with a boosting move, such as Aggron or Drapion. Although it is fragile, Primeape is a great partner for Girafarig, as it resists Dark- and Bug-type attacks and has U-turn to safely bring in the giraffe. Primeape can also deal with Chansey, Registeel, and Steelix, all of which will cause troubles for this set (even with Hidden Power Fighting).</p>"
      },
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>Although Girafarig may not have the greatest of defenses, it at least has enough Speed and a wide enough movepool to easily abuse Baton Pass. Switch in on a Pokemon that is most likely to switch out, then set up a Substitute. Afterward, use your selected boosting move. If the foe breaks Girafarig's Substitute, then keep using Substitute until its chosen pinch Berry activates. Girafarig will likely have a total of three boosts; at this point, proceed to pass the boosts to a more reasonable partner that suits what boosts Girafarig has attained.</p> <p>There are two boosting moves to choose from. Calm Mind is recommended because Girafarig may actually have a chance of setting up multiple Calm Minds on weak special attacks due to the Special Defense boost. The Special Defense boost also helps your receiver take incoming special hits more easily. The alternative is Agility, which doubles your Pokemon's Speed. With Agility, Girafarig can outrun many more Pokemon, allowing it to safely set up Substitutes until its Berry activates. Substitute does two things for Girafarig: it blocks harmful status for additional set-up time, and it helps activate the pinch Berry. The final slot is saved for Psychic, just in case Girafarig needs to attack Taunt users that aren't Dark-types.</p> <p>252 HP solves Girafarig's fragility issue to an extent; it can now easily Calm Mind up against Milotic without Haze, but it still cannot withstand super effective physical attacks from the likes of Scyther. Putting 252 EVs into Special Attack isn't recommended as Girafarig only has one attack that it will rarely use, as its sole job is to only pass boosts. Max Speed is important in order to set up a Substitute before a slower Pokemon cripples Girafarig with an untimely status move.</p> <p>If you are confident enough, you can swap out either Substitute or Psychic for Agility so Girafarig has two boosting moves to pass. With both Agility and Calm Mind, passing to Moltres, Milotic, or even Venusaur could be extremely devastating to your opponent. Watch out, though, as doing this will make Girafarig far more vulnerable to status and Taunt. If the Baton Pass fails, Girafarig is essentially a helpless toy without Psychic.</p> <p>When choosing a Baton Pass receiver, you need to pick out Pokemon that will not only benefit from the Berry boost, but also the move boost. A combination of Calm Mind and a Salac Berry requires special sweepers with decent Speed; the aforementioned Moltres, Milotic, and Venusaur are great candidates for this. Agility and a Petaya Berry can help out slower special sweepers such as Tangrowth, Exeggutor, and Glaceon. Using a same-stat boost combination such as Agility and a Salac Berry is not recommended as it's overkill; balancing between offense and Speed is a better way of allocating stats. Also, Liechi Berry can be used over the other Berries to help a physical sweeper out. Remember to use Agility instead of Calm Mind when doing so, as physical sweepers won't benefit from passed Calm Mind boosts. Notable receivers of Liechi boosts are Aggron, Rhyperior, and Absol.</p>"

      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>As with most Pokemon, Girafarig can make decent use of a Choice set. Using Choice Specs will help Girafarig plow through slow teams, while a Choice Scarf makes Girafarig into a decent revenge killer. Trick is one of the most important moves on this set; if Girafarig isn't doing any damage, then it should at least cripple its target. Do not just wildly select Trick, however, as Girafarig may Trick a Pokemon it doesn't want to Trick, such as a low HP Pokemon. For coverage, the tried-and-true combination of Psychic and Thunderbolt is utilized to toast the enemy. In the last slot, Baton Pass is suggested, as even though Girafarig is passing nothing, it lets the giraffe scout for potential Pursuit users that would otherwise easily trap and OHKO it. If you're keen on your predicting skills, then Shadow Ball, which is good for striking down enemy Ghost- and Psychic-types, or Hidden Power Fighting, which is used for smacking Dark- and Steel-types, make great alternatives to Baton Pass.</p> <p>The choice of nature boils down to your personal preference. Timid is suggested on the Choice Specs set to outrun base 80 Speed Pokemon, while Modest is recommended on a Choice Scarf set to compensate for the loss of power. This isn't set in stone, though, so you can adjust the nature and item at your leisure.</p> <p>This Girafarig appreciates defensive Pokemon that can take care of its weaknesses. Although most Bug-types such as Scyther will use U-turn, retreating back to a Steel-type wall such as Steelix and Registeel is usually the best course of action. Both of the above Steel-types can also set up Stealth Rock to support Girafarig. Additionally, they can provide a defense against Dark-type threats such as Absol and Drapion. Specifically, Houndoom and Spiritomb can cause major problems to this set due to Pursuit. Houndoom doesn't mind being Tricked a Choice item, while Spiritomb has great special bulk to withstand Girafarig's attacks. If, for some reason, they do not use Pursuit, then it is probably best to switch in a bulky Water-type such as Milotic and wear them down with Surf and Toxic.</p>"

  "Dunsparce": {
    "overview": "<p>Dunsparce is a really cool Pokemon, but unfortunately, he isn't a great choice competitively. Dunsparce is very similar to most generic Normal-types; he has a large movepool, but mediocre stats. Due to this, Dunsparce can't effectively utilize many of the useful moves in his repertoire, as he is either too frail or too weak to make good use of them.</p> <p>Fortunately, Dunsparce has one utterly amazing advantage that turns this extremely generic-but-cool Pokemon into a ridiculously aggravating opponent to face. This advantage is his ability: Serene Grace. With Serene Grace, Dunsparce is essentially a Jirachi or Togekiss of UU. If you've ever faced a Jirachi or Togekiss in OU, you should know just how annoying Serene Grace complemented by paralysis support can be. Serene Grace alone makes Dunsparce have unique, high flinch-rate moves; therefore, when using him, make sure to abuse it as much as possible.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Like most Normal-types, Dunsparce has an extensive movepool with many cool attacks that could work with Serene Grace. Sadly, most of his other physical options have mediocre coverage with Headbutt. Some of these notable attacks include Poison Jab and Iron Tail. Poison Jab's chance to Poison and Iron Tail's chance to lower defenses rise to a 60% chance with Serene Grace, making them somewhat viable, though they still have bad coverage.</p> <p>On the special side, Dunsparce has two notable moves that can boost his low Special Attack stat: Calm Mind and Charge Beam. Unfortunately, Dunsparce isn't bulky enough to abuse either of these, and doesn't hit hard enough with special attacks even after a boost. However, Dunsparce does have a plethora of special attacks that can take advantage of Serene Grace. These include: Thunder, Water Pulse, Shadow Ball, Ancient Power, Ice Beam, and Fire Blast. The increased secondary chances of these attacks make them more viable, though many of their effects are still unreliable.</p> <p>Dunsparce can use a support set with Stealth Rock, Roost, Thunder Wave, and a filler move, but doesn't really have the bulk to serve this purpose effectively. Alternatively, he can use Agility rather than paralysis to support his flinching moves. However, a 60% chance to flinch isn't particularly amazing by itself, and Dunsparce generally prefers paralysis since it adds another obstacle for the opponent to break through.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky Fighting types can give Dunsparce some issues. Pokemon such as Hitmontop and Hariyama are bulky enough to take numerous Headbutts, and if they stop getting flinched for one turn, they can strike Dunsparce with a super effective, STAB Fighting attack. Hitmonlee is also problematic; although he isn't particularly bulky, Hitmonlee is immune to paralysis thanks to Limber and can outspeed and smash Dunsparce with a Close Combat.</p> <p>Generally, Rock- and Steel-types do well against Dunsparce. Although he can hit them with a super effective Earthquake, Dunsparce is so weak that even Earthquake won't do much damage. Due to this, Rhyperior, Registeel, Steelix, and even Aggron can counter Dunsparce. Rhyperior and Aggron can simply set up in Dunsparce's face, though Aggron can only set up with the SubPunch set and still has to predict properly. Dunsparce won't be getting past Registeel and Steelix anytime soon since they're both exceedingly bulky. Registeel can also paralyze Dunsparce, preventing him from outspeeding other paralyzed Pokemon.</p> <p>In general, any physically defensive Pokemon will do fine against Dunsparce. Although they risk getting haxed to death by Headbutt and paralysis, they are generally bulky enough to eventually PP stall out Headbutt. Even if these physically bulky Pokemon lack a recovery move to stall out Dunsparce, they can probably knock out Dunsparce eventually, or at least do enough damage to ensure that the next switch-in can easily KO him.</p>",

      "ParaFlinch": {
        "description": "<p>Dunsparce is a very annoying Pokemon to fight against, and this set allows Dunsparce to whittle down the opposing Pokemon as the opponent is forced to watch and hope for Dunsparce to stop flinching their Pokemon. However, even if they do manage to land a hit on Dunsparce, they'll have to hit him another time before he faints, as Dunsparce is generally bulky enough to take a hit or two before healing the damage off with Leftovers.</p> <p>Dunsparce will often need a paralysis move to get the endless stream of flinches going. Either Body Slam or Thunder Wave is perfect for this purpose. Body Slam has a nice chance of paralysis, and can do damage at the same time, while Thunder Wave is more reliable. In the end, the choice between the two is mainly up to preference. Headbutt is Dunsparce's main flinch move, as it has a solid 60% flinch rate and is boosted by STAB. Bite and Earthquake hit the Ghost-, Rock-, and Steel-types that Headbutt cannot hit, and Bite has a high flinch rate as well. It should be noted, however, that Earthquake is fairly weak, so it should only be used to deal with weakened Rock- and Steel-types.</p> <p>The EVs look complicated at first, but in reality, they're actually fairly simple. An Adamant Nature and 252 Attack EVs allow for maximum power, while the remaining EVs are placed into Dunsparce's defenses to make him bulkier. Investing in Speed is generally unnecessary, as Dunsparce should ideally be used with paralysis support. However, you can use a simple 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe spread if you want Dunsparce to outspeed some Pokemon without paralyzing them first, though this sacrifices bulk.</p> <p>Dunsparce has a couple of good alternative moves. Roost can be used to make Dunsparce bulkier, but it's hard to find room for it on this set. Zen Headbutt can be used over Bite to hit bulky Fighting-types that Dunsparce has issues with while retaining the ability to hit Ghost-types. Unfortunately, it only has a 40% flinch rate. Rock Slide can go over Earthquake if you feel that your team can cover Rock- and Steel-types well enough, rendering Earthquake's Rock- and Steel- type damaging services unnecessary. Iron Tail can be used to hit Rock-types harder; it also has a 60% chance to lower their defenses. However, it's unreliable due to its poor accuracy, so Earthquake is generally the better option.</p> <p>This set particularly enjoys team members who can spread paralysis, as well as slow, strong Pokemon who can take advantage of paralysis support. Slowbro and Slowking are good choices for this purpose, as they resist Dunsparce's only weakness and are bulky. Registeel can also spread paralysis, as well as set up Stealth Rock to punish switches; however, it shares a Fighting weakness with Dunsparce. Examples of Pokemon who can take advantage of paralysis include Rhyperior and Aggron. Though both are weak to Fighting, they're both strong and bulky and can abuse paralysis support with hard-hitting attacks.</p>"

      "Substitute + Paralysis": {
        "description": "<p>Dunsparce tends to force switches, as opponents will often try to switch out to avoid being flinched. With Substitute, Dunsparce can protect himself and paralyze the switch-in. Since Dunsparce has the ability to create 101 HP Substitutes, he can easily set up on Pokemon that rely mainly on Seismic Toss for damage, such as Chansey and Registeel.</p> <p>Substitute is what differentiates this set from the previous one. As mentioned above, Substitute allows Dunsparce to take advantage of switches. Thunder Wave or Body Slam can be used to paralyze the switch-in. Thunder Wave is recommended over Body Slam on this set, as its perfect accuracy is generally more useful than Body Slam's damage, though Body Slam is still a viable option. Headbutt is Dunsparce's main STAB once again, and has an excellent 60% flinch rate. Earthquake or Bite can be used in the last slot to hit Rock- and Steel-types or Ghost-types respectively. Unfortunately, since you can only choose one move, he'll always walled by at least one opposing type; Ghost-types if you pick Earthquake, and Steel-types if you pick Bite.</p> <p>The EVs of this set are quite simple. 252 HP EVs allow Dunsparce to create 101 HP Substitutes, while 44 Speed EVs allow Dunsparce to outspeed Chansey and set up a Substitute in her face. The remaining EVs are poured into Attack to make Headbutt and Earthquake or Bite stronger. This spread, though simple, is necessary for the set's success. Without 252 HP EVs, Dunsparce can't set up on Seismic Tosses, while 44 Speed EVs are important because Chansey could otherwise hit Dunsparce with Toxic before he gets behind a Substitute.</p> <p>Since this set will only use one coverage move, Pokemon that can deal with the type that walls Dunsparce are necessary. If you choose Earthquake, Choice Banded Spiritomb is a good Pokemon to trap and KO Ghost-types. Spiritomb also has the advantage of being immune to Fighting, which allows him to switch in easier. If you opt for Bite, Dugtrio can come in, trap the Steel-type Pokemon, and KO it with Earthquake (or at least severely damage it). However, since Dugtrio is so frail, be wary of switching him directly into attacks.</p>"

  "Gligar": {
    "overview": "<p>With a useful base 85 Speed and superb base 105 Defense to compliment its unique Ground / Flying typing, Gligar should not be frowned upon in the UU tier, despite its NFE status. Gligar's typing grants it both an Electric and Ground immunity, as well as neat resistances to Bug, Fighting, and Poison. Perhaps the most impressive niche about Gligar is its versatility; it can set up Swords Dance and/or Agility and Baton Pass the boosts to a teammate, use Toxic to stall its opponent, break stall with Taunt, or be a deadly set-up sweeper with Swords Dance. It's not all good though, Gligar's special stats are pitiful and its Attack stat is only average. However, as long as its teammates are able to cover up its unfortunate weaknesses to common Water- and Ice-type attacks, Gligar will make a formidable addition to your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Due to its good physical movepool, Gligar could be an ideal Choice user, but its mediocre Attack makes the idea moot. Gligar can also use Screech to force switches, and use U-turn to take advantage of the switch. In terms of other attacking options, Night Slash allows Gligar to hit Ghost-types, most notably Rotom, for super effective damage. Aqua Tail can be used to hit bulky Ground-types, like Claydol, Rhyperior, and other Gligar. Since most physical attackers will have trouble 2HKOing Gligar without any super effective attacks, Counter can be used to strike back at them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Most physically bulky Pokemon that can take a boosted attack from Gligar and deal super effective damage back make good counters for it. Any specially-based Water-type like Milotic and Slowbro can OHKO Gligar with Surf. Donphan can use its excellent physical bulk to switch in on Gligar and hit it with Ice Shard. Both Claydol and Torterra resist Gligar's EdgeQuake coverage and can OHKO or 2HKO it with Ice Beam or Wood Hammer, respectively, but neither will enjoy taking a boosted X-Scissor. Pokemon with access to priority that super effectively damages Gligar can remove it once it has been weakened enough. Cloyster, Azumarill, and Feraligatr are all great examples of such Pokemon.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "SubRoost": {
        "description": "<p>Due to its great Defense, superb typing, access to Taunt, and an instant recovery in Roost, it's no surprise that Gligar can run a SubRoost set effectively. This set makes a great addition to teams that have trouble breaking through key pieces of stall teams, such as Chansey, Spiritomb, and Clefable. The premise of this set is simple: bring Gligar in on something that can't do much to it, such as a Choiced Fighting-, Ground-, or Electric-type attacks, and Substitute on the switch. Then, let Gligar proceed to whittle away at its opponent's health with Toxic, while simultaneously preventing them from healing via Taunt and keeping itself healthy with Roost.</p> <p>The Speed EVs allow Gligar to outspeed max Speed Milotic, while the HP EVs gives a Leftovers number, allowing it to use Substitute five times. The rest of the EVs are thrown into Defense for additional bulk. You can run 232 Speed to outrun any neutral natured base 95 Pokemon, or you can move the Defense EVs into Special Defense if you want Gligar to be able to take special attacks slightly better. For instance, 56 Special Defense EVs stop Offensive Lead Uxie from 2HKOing Gligar with Psychic. Substitute prevents Gligar from being hit by status and allows it to stall its foes while Toxic damage accumulates.</p> <p>If you choose to use Toxic, Poison- and Steel-types like Venusaur and Registeel, as well as Clefable and any Pokemon that can get behind a Substitute, will wall Gligar to no end. Earthquake allows Gligar to hit the aforementioned Pokemon, but leaves it vulnerable to Flyers and Levitators, such as Moltres and Rotom. You can choose to run either Aerial Ace or Rock Slide in the last slot so that Gligar can guarantee some damage against all opponents, particularly Weezing, but the damage output is less than sub-par.</p> <p>A bulky Water-type like Milotic can switch into any Water- and Ice-type attacks aimed at Gligar, while luring Electric-type attacks for Gligar to switch in on. Drapion can set up Toxic Spikes, which frees up a moveslot space, trap Rotom and Mismagius with Pursuit, and attracts Ground-type attacks that Gligar can take advantage of. Cloyster can set up both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, but neither it nor Gligar like being targeted by special attacks.</p>"

      "Wall": {
        "description": "<p>While this set may look similar to the SubRoost set, it has a different function: to be a reliable check to a number of physical threats in the tier. Gligar is able to check threats like Rhyperior, Aggron, and Hitmonlee without much trouble, thanks to its typing and base 105 Defense. Roost is a given on a defensive set, since it allows Gligar to recover half of its health, as well as play mind games with the opponent by removing its Flying-type. Due to Gligar's weak damage output, opponents will try to setup on Gligar; Taunt solves this issue by preventing Gligar's opponent from setting up on it. Earthquake is Gligar's STAB move of choice, as it allows Gligar to hit Rock-, Poison-, and Steel-types for super effective damage.</p> <p>An alternative spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe and a Jolly nature can be used. While Gligar will lose a significant portion of its bulk, this spread will allow Gligar to outrun max Speed Venusaur and Taunt the incoming Sleep Powder. It also lets Gligar outrun neutral natured base 95s and tie with Jolly Toxicroak. Toxic can be used over Aerial Ace if you want to have an easier time breaking stall. If you don't have any Stealth Rock users on your team, Gligar can use Stealth Rock instead of Taunt or Aerial Ace. Rock Slide and Knock Off are both viable options for Gligar's final moveslot. Rock Slide can 2HKO both Moltres and Scyther, while Gligar can have an easier time Roosting off damage if it manages to Knock Off a boosting item.</p> <p>Rotom and Mismagius are both troublesome to this set, partially due to Levitate, so Pokemon that can remove them, or set up on them, such as Spiritomb, Drapion, or Registeel, make great partners to this set. Spiritomb and Drapion can utilize Pursuit to prevent both threats from simply switching out, while Registeel can paralyze them with Thunder Wave and attack with Shadow Claw. As Gligar tends to lure in specially-based bulky Water-types, having a special wall such as Chansey can be helpful. Chansey has incredible special bulk, access to Thunder Wave, and the ability to lure in Fighting-type attacks for Gligar to switch in on. Slowbro also deserves a mention as a teammate, as it can take physical Ice and Water attacks that neither Gligar nor Chansey can take very well, while Gligar can switch into any Electric and Bug attacks that are aimed at Slowbro.</p>"

      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>Being only one of three Pokemon in UU that has access to the combination of Swords Dance, Agility, and Baton Pass, Gligar takes after Gliscor as being one of the best Baton Passers in their respective tiers. The moves are fairly simple. Taunt can prevent Gligar's opponent from halting its boosts or phazing it out. Running both Swords Dance and Agility can make your recipient a deadly sweeper if Gligar can manage a successful pass. However, you can opt to use Earthquake instead of a second boosting move because it can be difficult to gain a +2 boost in both Attack and Speed without dual screen support or Defense boosts. The choice between Yache or Passho Berry depends on the resistances of your team; if your team has multiple Water resistances, Gligar is better off holding a Yache Berry, while if your team has more Ice resistances, Gligar should hold a Passho Berry.</p> <p>Providing dual screen support is an absolute must if you want this set to be as effective as possible. There are a slew of Pokemon that can set up dual screens for Gligar. Both Uxie and Gardevoir can set up dual screens and have access to Memento, which weakens the foe offensively and gives Gligar a free switch in. Mr. Mime has a great support movepool that includes Encore, Taunt, Calm Mind, and Baton Pass, and has Soundproof to prevent sound-based moves, like Perish Song and Roar, from working. Clefable can also set up dual screens with ease due to its great bulk, while also luring Fighting-type attacks that Gligar can switch in on.</p> <p>As for selecting a receiver, there are several Pokemon to choose from. Physical Water-types are able to switch in easily on incoming Ice and Water attacks, and can make great use of any Swords Dance and Agility boosts. Azumarill has a max Attack stat of 436, thanks to Huge Power, and with a +2 boost on both Attack and Speed, it can absolutely tear through opposing teams. Feraligatr may not pack as much of a punch as Azumarill, but it is significantly faster, so it will be able to outspeed certain threats that Azumarill wouldn't be able to. Perhaps the best recipient for Gligar's boosts is the often mocked Bibarel. With Simple, Swords Dance and Agility each give an effective +4 boost, which allows Bibarel to hit harder than Azumarill after a boost and outrun much more threats than Feraligatr. Add in an unresisted (excluding Shedinja) STAB combination of Waterfall and Return, and Quick Attack for priority, and Bibarel can tear through teams if it can get the required boosts.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>While Gligar's other sets tend to play a more supportive or defensive role, this set is meant to remedy its rather mediocre Attack stat with Swords Dance, and use its respectable base 85 Speed to sweep. After a boost, Gligar reaches 498 Attack which allows it to OHKO or 2HKO all but the sturdiest of walls with its great coverage. As for the moves, Earthquake is Gligar's main way of dealing damage, thanks to its STAB, and Stone Edge completes the feared EdgeQuake combination, resisted only by Claydol and Torterra in UU. X-Scissor allows Gligar to hit the previously mentioned Pokemon, in addition to bulky Psychic-types like Uxie, Mesprit, and Slowbro, for super effective damage.</p> <p>There are a few other options for Gligar to use in its last moveslot. Roost allows Gligar to heal any Life Orb recoil and turn walls like Registeel, Chansey, and Clefable into set-up bait, but you must be cautious of status attacks. Taunt can stop the opponent from inflicting Gligar with status, and can be used to help beat Weezing, which is a great counter to this set. Aerial Ace can ensure certain KOs against Fighting- and Grass-types. Baton Pass can let Gligar escape from its counters, while passing its boosts to a teammate that can handle your opponent's switch-in. Rock Polish can be used instead of Swords Dance as Gligar reaches and impressive 538 Speed with an Adamant nature. However, Gligar will not be dishing out much damage if it isn't hitting its opponent for super effective damage.</p> <p>In order for this set to live up to its potential, it requires Stealth Rock and at least one layer of Spikes on your opponent's side of the field to get the necessary OHKOs. Registeel is a great candidate for Stealth Rock because it can lure Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, which Gligar can easily switch into. Qwilfish and Cloyster can both lay Spikes and then Explode, giving Gligar a free switch in and likely eliminating your opponent's Pokemon with it. Dusclops and Weezing are able to take a boosted attack from Gligar and cripple it with Will-O-Wisp, so a Flash Fire Pokemon like Houndoom or Ninetales can help by absorbing Will-O-Wisp and blasting the opposition with boosted Fire Blasts. Venusaur and Sceptile also make good teammates, since they can remove any bulky Waters with their STAB attacks, while luring Registeel for Gligar to set up on.</p>"

  "Steelix": {
    "overview": "<p>Steelix has fallen a long way from the titanic status it once had back in GSC, but that doesn't make it a bad Pokemon by any means. Its amazing physical defense and 11 resistances, including immunities to Poison and Electric, make Steelix a reliable user of Stealth Rock in UU. Its rival, Registeel, is more popular thanks to a wider support movepool and much higher Special Defense, but Steelix makes up for what it lacks with its unique typing, which is great offensively and good defensively, its access to Roar, and its Attack, which is just enough to pose a threat to its frailer would-be counters. It is also one of the handful of Pokemon who are immune to both Toxic and Thunder Wave. On the other hand, Steelix's shortcomings in its low Special Defense and Speed, defenselessness against Taunt, and common weaknesses in Water-, Fighting-, Fire-, and Ground-type attacks put Steelix at the bottom of the UU support ladder. Don't let these drawbacks fool you though, Steelix is a solid choice for any team looking for a Steel-type defensive pivot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Fang and Ice Fang have a chance of causing status effects and give Steelix greater coverage, but their utility is otherwise limited compared to Stone Edge (and even Crunch). Iron Tail is stronger than Iron Head and can lower the opposing Pokemon's Defense, but is far less accurate. Steelix gets Taunted often, so utilizing a RestTalk strategy without a boosting move is not a good idea. Steelix's horrid Speed also make Rock Polish and Screech rather ineffective.</p> <p>Giving Steelix an Iron Ball halves its already sluggish Speed, powering its Gyro Ball to the same level as 2 Curses. Shed Shell allows Steelix to escape trappers such as Magneton and Dugtrio, but is useless against anything else, and Steelix can usually bypass them with Roar anyway. Finally, Steelix can make use of a Choice Band to nail common switch-ins for a surprise heavy hit. However, using a Choice Band leaves Steelix even more exposed to Fire- and Water-types if it's locked into the wrong move. Finally, if you want Steelix to pose more of a threat offensively, transfer the HP EVs to Attack EVs, but keep a +Special Defense nature as without it, Steelix is helpless against any special attack it doesn't resist.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The way to go when handling Steelix is to come in on Stealth Rock and fire off powerful Fire-, Water-, and Fighting-type attacks. Steelix's Explosion and a proper type-resist Berry can reduce the number of effective counters, but even then some Pokemon are just too powerful to be stopped due to Steelix's low Special Defense stat. Pokemon who can blow right past any Steelix include Choice Specs Ninetales, Life Orb Blaziken, and Houndoom after a Nasty Plot boost. The offensive sets have to predict perfectly to catch these Pokemon on the switch, or Steelix will be forced out for certain. Milotic and Slowbro generally take pitiful damage from Steelix and can wear it down with STAB Surf. Defensive Tangrowth and Leafeon don't fear anything that Steelix throws at them, and can KO back with STAB Grass-type attacks. Moltres has been mentioned multiple times, and for good reason: it threatens any Steelix without Stone Edge with its strong Fire STAB attacks.</p> <p>Spiritomb is immune to Explosion and takes little damage from anything Steelix can dish out; it can also cripple Steelix with Will-O-Wisp or set up in its face with Calm Mind if Steelix doesn't carry Roar. Claydol, Donphan, and Blastoise take hardly any damage from Steelix, and can remove its Stealth Rock from the field with Rapid Spin. Hitmontop reduces Steelix's Attack with Intimidate and can fire powerful super effective STAB Close Combats straight at it. Hariyama can Force Palm or just Whirlwind Steelix out if it tries to Curse up. Steelix is too slow to retaliate more than once against these threats, so a few special attacks will eventually bring it down. Plan ahead for Explosion, and you'll be fine.</p>",

      "Standard Wall": {
        "description": "<p>Steelix's basic walling set returns for another round in the UU tier. Its great resistances cause many switches, which it can exploit by laying down Stealth Rock while the opposing Pokemon flees. Due to an uninvested Attack stat, the residual damage will probably do more harm than any direct attacks that Steelix can dish out, so you'll want Stealth Rock set up as soon as possible.</p> <p>STAB Earthquake deals respectable damage, and no Steelix should walk out the door without it. The third slot depends on whether you want coverage with Stone Edge, or STAB and accuracy in Gyro Ball. Both hit Flying-types and frail Ghosts; Stone Edge does better against Moltres, while Gyro Ball does better against Mismagius. A Sassy or Relaxed nature with 0 Speed IVs should be used with Gyro Ball in order to increase its Base Power. The fourth slot provides additional support. Roar works well after you've eliminated the opponent's Taunt user, as it scouts the opponent's team and racks up Stealth Rock damage. Toxic can wear down Steelix's usual counters gradually, making it harder for them to stall, but Explosion can leave a lasting dent on them or even OHKO them outright. Unfortunately, Steelix will then no longer be able to supply its valuable resistances to the team.</p> <p>The EVs are designed to give Steelix as much Special Defense as possible. The reason for this is that Steelix's Defense is already so monstrous even without any investment, and most opponents will be preying on its weaker Special Defense stat anyway. If you feel that Steelix's physical walling capabilities are diminished too greatly by this, then an alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def can be used. Be warned, however, as now almost any special attacker will have no problem dealing with Steelix. Steelix can run Payback in the third slot to nail Rotom for super effective damage, as it resists Gyro Ball and is immune to Earthquake. It is also useful for hitting other Levitators, such as Mismagius, Uxie, and Mesprit, harder than Steelix's other moves.</p> <p>Steelix's resistances create a solid defensive pivot, especially for teams that rely on a powerful special attacker to clean up. With Stealth Rock weakening the opponent's team and priority sweepers kept at bay, Pokemon such as Ludicolo and Ninetales can breathe easier and sweep more reliably. Slowking makes an excellent partner for Steelix in many aspects. While Slowking provides the same Water-, Fire-, and Fighting-type resistances that Slowbro does, Slowking is better suited as a partner since its higher Special Defense complements Steelix's lower Defense stat much better, making it a great check for many threats who like to switch into Steelix - from Moltres and Milotic to Hitmontop and Hariyama - and can support Steelix with paralysis to make up for its low Speed. It's worth noting that running Thunder Wave on Slowking when Steelix is running Gyro Ball is a conflicting strategy; it is better then to run a neutral Speed nature on Steelix and use Iron Head to make the most of its flinch chance while the opposing Pokemon is paralyzed.</p>"

      "BaitLix": {
        "description": "<p>With Fire- and Water-types rising in dominance, Steelix's role as a Normal-type resister is constantly put into question. This set runs type-resist Berries that help mitigate its inherent weaknesses by taking advantage of the two assets that Registeel doesn't have: a good Attack stat, and STAB Earthquake.</p> <p>The purpose of this set is to lure in some of Steelix's usual counters, bulky Waters such as Milotic and Slowbro or Fire-types like Houndoom, and then use Explosion or Earthquake to clear the path for a sweeper, such as Dragon Dance Feraligatr or Swords Dance Venusaur, who are normally troubled by them. Stealth Rock should be used early-game when your opponent is still playing conservatively with weak attacks such as Fake Out and U-turn. The last slot is up to preference; Stone Edge hits Flying-types the hardest and allows Steelix to check Moltres (if Steelix still has or even has an Occa Berry, of course) and Altaria, but Iron Head is more reliable and does more damage to Ghost- and Grass-types. Roar can scout for counters so you can better assess what Pokemon your team needs to eliminate.</p> <p>The EVs are geared to give Steelix a good amount of Special Defense, while also giving its Explosion the power to significantly damage or take out most foes. Steelix can survive even a Life Orb Milotic's Hydro Pump or a Blaziken's Fire Blast with the EV investment, provided it's holding the appropriate type-resist Berry, and then act accordingly to take the foe out. A Passho Berry is for Water-types such as Azumarill and offensive Milotic, while Occa Berry is for Fire-types such as Blaziken, Magmortar, and Houndoom. The type-resist Berry of choice should be specific to your team's needs, so choose with that in mind.</p> <p>Be wary, as BaitLix is less physically-defensive than the Standard Wall Steelix, which can often lead to it not fulfilling its commonly perceived role of a physical wall as well as one might expect. It is often a good idea to have some other physically-bulky Pokemon, such as Donphan or Milotic, in reserve if you're running this Steelix set.</p>"
      },
      "Torment": {
        "description": "<p>This is a rather unique Steelix set that utilizes Torment in conjunction with Substitute to halt the enemy's attacks. By doing this, Steelix can stall the foe with Toxic or attack freely with Earthquake and Gyro Ball.</p> <p>Steelix should first use Substitute to scout the switch-in; beware of overusing Substitute, however, since Steelix's HP stat is fairly low. If the switch-in is a Pokemon who carries only one super effective attack or you know is Choiced, use Torment, which allows Steelix to stop foes from using the same move twice in a row. This is especially useful if the foe has only one super effective attack or is Choiced because it is forced to use an ineffective move or Struggle. Afterward, if Steelix's Substitute has been broken, set up another one while the foe either stays in and uses an ineffective attack or switches out. Depending on the switch-in, use Toxic if the foe can take Steelix's attacks relatively well, or Earthquake or Gyro Ball if it will devastate the opposing Pokemon.</p> <p>The choice between Earthquake and Gyro Ball depends on what Pokemon your team can handle. Earthquake is preferred since it can strike Poison- and Steel-types who are immune to Toxic. However, if your team employs Toxic Spikes from supporters such as Omastar, Drapion, and Cloyster, it may be better to attack Flying-types and Levitators, such as Swellow, Mismagius, and Scyther, with Gyro Ball.</p> <p>Some potential options to use on this set are Protect and Roar. Protect helps Steelix stall the opponent with Torment, gain HP from Leftovers, and better stall for increasing poison damage on the foe. Roar can shuffle the opponent's team around so you can identify key threats and take them out beforehand. Steelix is strapped for moveslots as it is, however, and it needs all of the listed moves to work as effectively as possible.</p> <p>The nature and defensive EVs allow Steelix to take less than 25% damage from 0 Special Attack Milotic's Ice Beam, which means Steelix's Substitute will never break. The remaining EVs are placed in Attack to deal as much damage as possible with Earthquake or Gyro Ball. Note that if Steelix is using Gyro Ball, you should choose Sassy over Careful and set the Speed IVs to 0 to increase Gyro Ball's damage output. Also, with Gyro Ball, you can use an alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 48 Atk / 208 SpD so Houndoom's Dark Pulse doesn't break Steelix's Substitute; this is important since Steelix lacks a way to OHKO Houndoom. Sandstorm support from Hippopotas is welcome to increase the residual damage done to the opponent over time.</p> <p>Walls who are immune to or take little damage from Earthquake and Gyro Ball, and are also immune to poison or carry Rest, such as Milotic and Weezing, are huge threats to this Steelix. Against these Pokemon, Electric-type special attackers, such as Manectric and Rotom, can switch in on a weak attack and then strike back with STAB Thunderbolt. Watch out, however, as repeated attacks from these walls will eventually KO these fragile Electric-types. Wish support is appreciated from Chansey and Leafeon to keep these relatively frail Pokemon healthy. Wish can also help Steelix regenerate more HP if Substitute is taking its toll on Steelix's health. Moltres, Taunt users such as Mismagius, and Encore users such as Clefable and Poliwrath are also major pains to this set. Using specially defensive Hariyama can help remove Clefable and Mismagius with Close Combat and Payback, respectively. Against Poliwrath and Moltres, Rotom can use Thunderbolt, but beware of switching into both Waterfall and Fire Blast. Alternatively, Lanturn is a much safer option due to its Water typing and bulk; however, using Lanturn comes at the cost of fewer immunities and mediocre offensive stats.</p>"
      },
      "Curse": {
        "description": "<p>This set is much harder to use than the other sets, as the Pokemon who can interrupt its sweep attempts are numerous. However, the benefits cannot be ignored in comparison to the other sets. By using Curse, you have the advantage of powering up all of Steelix's moves, while strengthening its already massive Defense, and after a couple of Curses, Steelix can surpass the damage capacity of the other sets easily. Naturally, you'll want to start Steelix's sweep later in the match, when all Fire-, Water-, and Grass-types on the opposing team have been taken care of.</p> <p>Gyro Ball is the main attack this time, as the synergy between it and Curse comes naturally. As Steelix's Speed lowers, the number of targets Gyro Ball can hit at peak damage increases. With just two Curses, Steelix's Speed becomes 29, which allows Steelix to nail foes with a Speed stat of 174 or higher with full-powered Gyro Balls. Earthquake is still Steelix's most reliable STAB move though, and gets decent coverage with Gyro Ball. Either of these attacks can be replaced with Stone Edge if you need Steelix to take on Moltres, but that's a job that would be done better by another Pokemon on your team.</p> <p>Explosion lets Steelix take its hard-earned boosts and go out with a bang, but Rest gives Steelix greater longevity and prevents status from getting in the way of its sweep. If using Rest, Chesto Berry can be used to give Steelix a one-time full health regeneration at no cost. You could also use type-resist Berries on this set, namely Passho Berry or Occa Berry, to protect Steelix against specific threats that the rest of your team may not be able to remove. The EVs are designed to reinforce Steelix's vulnerable Special Defense, as its monstrous Defense will already be boosted to tremendous heights by Curse.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this Steelix isn't much of a team player, and needs a lot of support in order to effectively sweep. Stealth Rock works wonders for its sweeping potential, keeping Moltres off its back if Steelix is not running Stone Edge. Clefable and Chansey can absorb special attacks aimed at Steelix, lay down Stealth Rock, and provide Wish support so that Steelix can attempt multiple sweeps. Claydol and Uxie synergize well with this Steelix set in numerous ways: they resist or are immune to Steelix's Ground and Fighting weaknesses, can set up Stealth Rock, and can provide Light Screen support to give Steelix a much easier time setting up.</p>"

  "Shuckle": {
    "overview": "<p>Shuckle has the highest Defense and Special Defense stats in the game, which would be great if it had a higher HP stat to go along with them. Shuckle functions the best inside of a sandstorm, though, where its already high Special Defense is further increased. Not even Alakazam, which boasts the highest Special Attack in all of UU, can get past Shuckle in a sandstorm.</p> <p>Although Shuckle's sky-high defensive stats make it seem like a great Pokemon, there are a number of factors stopping it from being as useful as it should be. Shuckle's crippling Stealth Rock weakness, pathetic HP stat, lack of instant recovery, lack of a useful ability, and incredibly limited movepool all play into this. However, with the right support and given the right conditions, Shuckle can still wall most Pokemon until the end of days when the need arises.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shuckle has a very poor movepool, so there aren't many sets it can run. It can use an Acupressure set, but Shuckle's Attack stat at +6 will only reach 520, and it's outclassed by Drapion, who has higher Attack and Speed. Another niche that Shuckle has is a Power Trick set under Trick Room conditions. Once Shuckle uses Power Trick, its Attack stat will raise to 614, but its Defense stat will suffer, enabling common priority attacks to KO it with ease. Also, Rhyperior makes a much better Rock-type Trick Room sweeper than Shuckle due to Swords Dance and having great bulk and a substantially higher Attack stat. Wrap seems like a good option at first for its ability to trap Pokemon, but Shuckle will usually end up facing a Pokemon it doesn't want to trap, thus essentially wasting a turn.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Hard hitting Rock-types such as Rhyperior, Aggron, and Kabutops can break Shuckle down to size with their powerful STAB attacks. Additionally, these Pokemon are capable of setting up Stealth Rock, which makes Shuckle easier to deal with by the rest of their team. Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon are also an effective response to Shuckle due to their immunity to Toxic--Shuckle's only way of dealing damage. Any Pokemon with Taunt can stop Shuckle's strategy cold, although it can still Knock Off the Taunt user's item. A great strategy for beating Shuckle is changing the weather. If you change the weather, Shuckle will lose its Special Defense boost, and your Pokemon will no longer lose 6.25% health each turn. Players rarely keep their Hippopotas alive throughout an entire match, so once you change the weather, sandstorm will likely not get set back up.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Toxic Stall": {
        "description": "<p>Although Shuckle's movepool is incredibly limited, it has everything it needs to be an effective poison stalling Pokemon. Shuckle's titanic defensive stats make it extremely hard to KO, and setting up on it with stat-boosting moves is not an option due to Encore. Once Shuckle's HP is low, it can fully heal itself with Rest. Knock Off is the best choice for the last slot; a lot of Pokemon hold Leftovers and will be greatly weakened by losing it. Knock Off is also great for removing Choice items from Pokemon that might try to Trick them onto Shuckle. Protect is another option to use in the last slot, as it allows Shuckle to get a free turn of Toxic buildup and grants it free Leftovers recovery.</p> <p>248 HP EVs are used so that Shuckle can switch into Stealth Rock 5 times and live, while 252 Defense EVs buffer the stat that sandstorm doesn't help. Shuckle can use a specially defensive EV spread of 248 HP / 252 SpD / 8 Def with a Careful nature to be even more difficult to take down on the special side. With that EV spread, Shuckle isn't even 5HKOed by Alakazam's Psychic. Shuckle can then safely Toxic the opponent from behind the Substitute without fear of being KOed. Stealth Rock can be used in the last slot since Shuckle is almost guaranteed to set it up unless Taunted, but if you are using a sandstorm team, you should consider other Pokemon for the move.</p> <p>Shuckle requires support against Steel- and Poison-types due to their immunity to Toxic. Dugtrio can trap and kill most Poison- and Steel-types, and is immune to sandstorm. Shuckle also appreciates Toxic Spikes support so that it can run Protect in Toxic's place. Cacturne can be used to set up Spikes if you're dead-set on none of your Pokemon taking sandstorm damage, but Qwilfish has better type synergy with his resistance to Fighting-, Steel-, and Water-type moves. Wish support also helps Shuckle out due to Rest's unreliability; Clefable is probably the best choice to supply this since it is immune to sandstorm through Magic Guard. Cleric support from Leafeon and Clefable is also very helpful to wake Shuckle up after he uses Rest.</p>"

  "Sneasel": {
    "overview": "<p>Sneasel may often be overlooked due to its Not Fully Evolved label, yet it fares quite well in the lower tiers due to its high Speed and Attack stats. What really makes Sneasel worth using is its ability to trap, threaten, and revenge kill some of UU's most potent threats. Its ability to trap and kill Ghosts is completely unrivaled in UU due to its Speed and power. Its movepool also makes it well-suited to be a lead. Sneasel's main drawbacks are poor defenses, low Base Power attacks, and a weakness to Stealth Rock.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sneasel's movepool is good, but far from deep. Aerial Ace can hit Fighting-types if you are desperate to do so. Return is always an option, but Sneasel likes to hit super effectively in order to score OHKOs. Feint Attack has the same Base Power as Bite and Punishment, and cannot miss, but Bite's chance to flinch is generally the more valuable secondary effect. Taunt is also an option on non-lead sets and can come in handy to slow down stat boosters and walls.</p> <p>As far as EVs are concerned, avoid putting 4 EVs into HP, as this is a Stealth Rock number for Sneasel, meaning it will only be able to switch into Stealth Rock four times instead of five. Always maximize Sneasel's Attack and Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Hariyama and Hitmontop are two of the best counters to Sneasel, as both can take its attacks quite well and OHKO back with ease. Hitmontop can either lower Sneasel's Attack with Intimidate or hit it with Mach Punch, depending on the variant. Hariyama, meanwhile, takes Sneasel's STAB attacks easily, although it must be wary of Low Kick due to its girth. Weezing completely rains on Sneasel's parade, as it can take any attack with ease and use Will-O-Wisp to end any chance Sneasel had to be effective later in the match. Milotic also makes a great counter, as it can Recover away just about any attack Sneasel throws at it. The same can be said for Quagsire and, to a lesser extent, Slowbro.</p> <p>On the offensive-based side of things, Arcanine fares very well, as it can switch in on any of Sneasel's attacks, Intimidate it, and threaten with Extreme Speed and Flare Blitz. Blaziken can also switch in easily, as it resists both of Sneasel's STAB moves and forces Sneasel out with STAB of its own, which can be difficult to switch into. Azumarill has little trouble switching in and can blow Sneasel away with Aqua Jet.</p> <p>On the whole, Sneasel is not terribly difficult to \"counter\", but its value lies in its ability to take out multiple Pokemon before it gives you the chance to get rid of it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Straight out of Weavile's playbook, this set takes advantage of Sneasel's movepool and Speed to form an awesome revenge killer. Pursuit allows it to OHKO Mismagius after Stealth Rock regardless of whether or not it flees, in addition to trapping other weakened Pokemon. Punishment, meanwhile, makes it a great check to stat boosters like Venusaur. Ice Shard is great for priority and severely damages Sceptile, Dugtrio, and Swellow. Low Kick rounds out Sneasel's excellent type coverage by pounding UU's Steel- and Rock-types.</p> <p>Sneasel is one of the most effective and underrated revenge killers in UU. Like Weavile, its movepool lends itself very well to revenge killing and is reinforced by its dual STAB moves.</p> <p>Pursuit is what makes this set shine, as it becomes extremely powerful with Choice Band equipped. Even when Ghost-types stay in on Pursuit, most of them are still OHKOed by it. After Stealth Rock damage, Mismagius is OHKOed 100% of the time, while Rotom is OHKOed over half of the time. This effectively means that if Sneasel switches in on any of these Pokemon, they're toast. The only things Sneasel needs to watch out for are switching in on a Choice Scarf Rotom's Thunderbolt or Mismagius's Hidden Power Fighting (or Substitute followed by Hidden Power Fighting) and Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Ice Shard is also a given to allow Sneasel to beat other Pokemon with priority moves, as well as do heavy damage to Sceptile, Swellow, Dugtrio, and Alakazam, all of which outspeed it. Ice Punch might seem like a good idea due to Sneasel's high Speed, but Ice Shard is the better option for pure revenge killing due to its priority. In the third slot, Low Kick gets the edge over Brick Break, although Brick Break still has its uses. Low Kick is typically much better against bulkier Pokemon such as Rhyperior, Steelix, Hariyama, and the Regi trio, who Sneasel struggles to hurt with its other moves. Brick Break fares better against lightweights like Clefable and Umbreon, although Low Kick still hits the frail ones for massive damage.</p> <p>Punishment also makes a great move for a revenge killer, as the more boosts an opponent has accrued, the harder Sneasel hits. After three Calm Minds, it easily OHKOes the most defensive Slowbro, and does 94% minimum after two Calm Minds. It also has a chance to OHKO Venusaur and Raikou after they have used Swords Dance and Calm Mind once, respectively. The majority of Pokemon who have boosted their stats more than once will stand no chance, as they will be hit with a 140 Base Power attack (assuming they are +4) boosted by STAB and Choice Band. The exceptions are Curse users and those that resist Dark-type attacks.</p> <p>Anything that fears Ghost-types (other than Spiritomb, which Sneasel doesn't counter) will appreciate the company of Sneasel. Other Ghosts come to mind, such as Drifblim, as many of them fear faster Ghosts. Fighting-types, especially those running Choice Scarfs or Bands, such as Hitmonlee, will also enjoy not having Ghost-types switching into their STAB attacks with ease. Sneasel also does a great job of clearing out Spin blockers not named Spiritomb, so any Rapid Spinner will love to have Sneasel on its team and vice versa. Having a reliable check to Calm Mind users is also a great benefit to any team.</p> <p>As shown by the figures above, Stealth Rock is a necessity for Sneasel to OHKO Mismagius and Rotom. Donphan and Claydol can both Spin away and set up Stealth Rock, and can take many of the attacks Sneasel fears. Uxie and Slowbro both work well with Sneasel, as they can come in on the Fighting-types and bulky Pokemon whom Sneasel fears and cripple them with Thunder Wave or set up screens (in Uxie's case). Milotic and other bulky Waters also make good switch-ins to most of Sneasel's counters.</p>"
      },
      "Attacking Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Sneasel makes an excellent lead in the UU metagame, thanks to its excellent Speed, movepool, and Inner Focus ability. Taunt can be a huge nuisance to leads hoping to set up entry hazards or screens. Fake Out is always a great move on a lead, as it is essentially free damage on most leads and will also get rid of Focus Sashes. Access to Inner Focus and Counter makes Sneasel a natural candidate for a lead, especially in a metagame swarming with Ambipom. Other physical attacking leads are Counter bait, and those that will attempt to Stealth Rock on the first turn will fall victim to Taunt. Special attackers often cause trouble, but will not get by without taking a Fake Out and possibly a Taunt.</p> <p>Physical attackers, such as Ambipom, Arcanine, and Regirock, will easily fall victim to Counter should they choose to attack. Not many players will see Counter coming, and simply Fake Out with Ambipom, which will result in an instant KO with Counter. Ice Shard is also an option over Pursuit and allows Sneasel to beat Swellow with Protect and Alakazam.</p> <p>Although one may be inclined to use a Hasty nature to increase Counter damage, this is largely overkill, as Sneasel's Defense is already very low. Additionally, with a Jolly nature, Sneasel can often survive a Fake Out from Ambipom with over 25% health remaining, which means it can switch in again later in the match even if Stealth Rock is up.</p> <p>Special attackers in general cause problems for Sneasel, especially those that are not fazed by Taunt or Pursuit. Moltres, Omastar, and Electrode are all common leads that Sneasel cannot beat, so it is better off switching after using Fake Out. Alakazam with Inner Focus can also beat Sneasel, as it is faster and will typically carry a Focus Sash. Rhyperior and Cloyster spell trouble due to Rock Blast, which will OHKO Sneasel through Focus Sash since it hits multiple times in a turn. These Pokemon, along with others that Sneasel cannot counter, such as Omastar, may still be worth using Taunt on, as they may choose to use Stealth Rock or Spikes on the first turn - but don't count on it. Uxie, meanwhile, is always a roll of the dice to face since it commonly carries Trick and U-turn, both of which Sneasel fears.</p> <p>Sneasel's teammates should be able to switch into the aforementioned leads that it fears. Chansey is, of course, a great switch-in to most special attackers. Milotic can also switch into Moltres, Cloyster, Omastar, and Rhyperior quite easily. Rapid Spinners are also beneficial, as they will allow Sneasel to switch out with its Focus Sash intact and have the opportunity to switch in again later without taking any damage from entry hazards.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Fast, frail, and moderately powerful, Sneasel makes a natural candidate for a Swords Dance set. Its dual STAB and priority attacks come in handy here once again, although it unfortunately lacks a truly powerful attack. Ice Shard and Ice Punch provide priority and power, respectively, and either will be very valuable. Low Kick will devastate many of the bulky Pokemon who think they can shrug off Sneasel's attacks, while your Dark STAB moves comes down to Punishment, Bite, or Pursuit, depending on what function it is intended to serve.</p> <p>Sneasel's excellent Speed allows it to utilize Swords Dance to boost its above average Attack stat to greater heights. This set allows Sneasel to be more multi-dimensional than the Revenge Killer set, and take out some of the threats that would normally find it easy to switch into.</p> <p>Ice Shard is preferred over Ice Punch, since after a Swords Dance, it will become quite powerful, in addition to having priority. Ice Punch is still an option, however, as Sneasel's Speed will allow it to act first most of the time. Low Kick deals heavy damage to most Steel-types in UU, OHKOing Registeel after a Swords Dance. It also does an average of 90% to standard variants of Rhyperior and Steelix. Aggron and Magneton should just stay home. It also hits Normal-types, such as Miltank and Kangaskhan, hard, although not all Normal-types are heavy like Steel-types, so some, such as Ambipom, are hit harder by Ice Punch or a Dark-type move.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Night Slash is missing in action from Sneasel's movepool, so the remaining options for Dark-type moves are listed in the last slot. Each has its benefits and drawbacks: Punishment can hit for very high damage against Pokemon who have boosted their stats, but suffers from low PP; Bite is limited to 60 Base Power, but has a chance to flinch; Pursuit can help Sneasel's revenge killing ability, but can only muster 40 Base Power against Pokemon who stay in against it.</p> <p>Sneasel's life will be short-lived without a Rapid Spinner present, so that is a must-have for a set using Life Orb. Bulky Pokemon who are neutral to all of Sneasel's attacks are the bane of this set, and are certainly something to consider when choosing Sneasel's teammates. Entry hazards will help wear down switch-ins, and also help Sneasel achieve KOs more easily.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Ursaring is quite a beast... err bear. Its Attack stat is one of the best out there, and Ursaring has two great abilities that complement it. The only letdowns that Ursaring has are its just-decent defenses and low Speed. Ursaring is also cursed with being on a timer, thanks to the status conditions that have to be inflicted on it in order for Quick Feet and Guts to kick in. However, with the right amount of support, Ursaring is capable of unleashing some of the strongest attacks found in UU onto its unfortunate victims. Whatever you do, don't let this bear set up, or it will lead to the quick and painful demise of your awe-stricken team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ursaring has a diverse movepool, which is unusual for a physical attacker. It has access to the elemental punches, but STAB Return or Facade usually deal more damage even when the punches are super effective. The only Pokemon Ursaring would OHKO without any boosts are Torterra and Altaria with Ice Punch. Ursaring has access to Brick Break, Cross Chop, Focus Punch, Low Kick, Superpower, and Hammer Arm as alternative Fighting-type attacks, but Close Combat is usually the better choice. Payback is also present in its repertoire and can find use on its slower sets, but Crunch is a more reliable option. Other physical moves Ursaring has in its movepool include: Stone Edge, Rock Slide, Shadow Claw, Seed Bomb, and Gunk Shot.</p> <p>As for stat-boosting moves, Ursaring has Belly Drum and Bulk Up. Swords Dance is usually the preferred option as it is faster at boosting Attack than Bulk Up, and the Defense boosts from Bulk Up will generally not help Ursaring take any hits better. Swords Dance also doesn't strip Ursaring of half of its health, unlike Belly Drum, which would decrease the length of Ursaring's sweep; with a Swords Dance boost, Ursaring is already capable of achieving all of the OHKOs it needs.</p> <p>Yawn is interesting as it allows Ursaring to force switches, and gives it a much easier time setting up. Ursaring also has Scary Face to slow down incoming fast sweepers, allowing Ursaring to threaten them without worrying about getting knocked out first. Lastly, Ursaring can run a RestTalk set with Defense investment, but it is usually better off focusing on attacking rather than cushioning hits.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Due to Ursaring's ability to hit unnaturally hard, it's hard to counter it straight-up. Your best bet is to prevent it from setting up anything. However, if it does set up, then your next best move is to use faster Pokemon and priority attacks. Hitmontop is the best check to Ursaring, provided that it switches in on Crunch; it can use Fake Out followed up by Mach Punch to take Ursaring out. Ambipom can also check it (Jolly Ambipom outspeeds Ursaring even after a Quick Feet boost), but can't switch in on any of Ursaring's damaging attacks. Although they are not considered surefire counters, Substitute Mismagius and Rotom can beat Toxic Orb Ursaring by stalling its HP away. Steelix and Rhyperior can survive assaults from non-Swords Dance sets and can use Earthquake to take a chunk out of Ursaring's health. Donphan, Tangrowth, Weezing, and Slowbro also handle non-Swords Dance sets fairly well by surviving a hit and dishing back an attack.</p>",

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Out of all of Ursaring's sets, this one is probably the most frightening. The biggest problem with using Ursaring as a sweeper is its lack of Speed. Fortunately, Ursaring has the ability Quick Feet, which boosts its Speed by 1.5x when it has a status affliction. Swords Dance with Quick Feet make a lethal combination by boosting both Ursaring's Attack and Speed by two and one stage(s) respectively. This, along with the excellent coverage provided by Facade, Close Combat, and Crunch, is what makes Ursaring so dangerous.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is preferred when using Quick Feet. With an Adamant nature, Ursaring won't outspeed Timid Houndoom, but with a Jolly nature, Ursaring hits 343 Speed, outpacing everything up to positive-natured base 105s. Please note that Quick Feet doesn't prevent the Attack drop from burns, so using a Flame Orb is out of the question.</p> <p>This set is essentially a cross between a Swords Dance and Choice Scarf Ursaring, since it hits a high Speed but is extremely powerful at the same time. Facade is used over Ursaring's other STAB attacks because after Toxic Orb kicks in, it'll do more damage than Return, and Ursaring's new-found Speed makes the occasional paralysis from Body Slam unnecessary. Close Combat hits the Rock- and Steel-types that resist Facade. A +2 Close Combat will always OHKO 252 / 0 Registeel and has a 50% chance of OHKOing 252 / 0 Steelix after it has taken damage from one layer of Spikes. Crunch, on the other hand, hurts the Ghost-types immune to Ursaring's other offensive options.</p> <p>There are several ways to improve Ursaring's ability to sweep: dual screens, Thunder Wave support, and entry hazards. First off, dual screens are a great way to reduce damage and possibly give Ursaring the chance to pull off another Swords Dance. Secondly, paralysis support patches up its depressing Speed because Ursaring is far too slow to pose any threat to faster sweepers. Finally, Stealth Rock and Spikes are recommended since they allow Ursaring to get certain OHKOs on bulkier walls. Uxie fits the bill really well as it has both Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave to help out Ursaring, as well as access to dual screens if you wish. Spikes is particularly important, because Ursaring will gain some important OHKOs that Stealth Rock wouldn't achieve alone. With only one layer of Spikes, Ursaring has a chance to OHKO Steelix with +2 Close Combat. A full three layers grants Ursaring the ability to OHKO max HP / max Def Donphan with Facade. Cloyster and Omastar are good candidates for using Spikes in the lead slot thanks to their high Defense stat.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance + Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>Ursaring is a great wallbreaker with Life Orb equipped, because it can then muscle its way through opposing walls without losing as much HP as from Toxic Orb or Flame Orb. Ursaring's Attack can reach astonishing heights with a Swords Dance boost, Life Orb, and a potential Guts boost. In addition to this, Ursaring's movepool allows it to hit every Pokemon in UU neutrally with just three moves. Return and Double-Edge provide a solid STAB move for hitting Pokemon who take neutral damage from all of Ursaring's attacks; because a status affliction boost is not guaranteed, these two moves are considered much more reliable than Facade. Earthquake grants Ursaring a way to hurt opposing Steel-types that resist its STAB move. Steelix with 0 Defense EVs won't enjoy a boosted Earthquake, as it deals a minimum of 94.92%. Registeel is always OHKOed by a boosted Earthquake. Close Combat is an option over Earthquake to OHKO Steelix and Regirock without entry hazards, but the defense drops are very noticeable. Finally, Crunch is a great move to OHKO the Ghost-types of UU, as they typically have mediocre physical defense.</p> <p>224 Speed EVs allow Ursaring to outpace max Speed Donphan and Tangrowth along with 0 Speed Milotic. 252 Attack EVs maximize its ability to crush the opponent. The remaining 32 EVs are allocated to HP, and conveniently give a Life Orb number. It also helps Ursaring weather some weaker hits from defensive Pokemon.</p> <p>Stopping Ursaring is generally a hard task, but faster physical sweepers and priority abusers can eventually take it down. TechniTop can chip Ursaring's HP away with Fake Out and finish it off with Mach Punch. As such, packing Weezing can prove useful as it helps check Hitmontop by crippling it with Will-O-Wisp. Rotom can work great alongside Ursaring to cover its weakness to Fighting-type moves. Life Orb Rotom can take Bullet Punches well and also 2HKO Hitmontop with Thunderbolt; additionally, Rotom can set up dual screens. Like the previous set, Ursaring enjoys Stealth Rock and Spikes support which allows it to nab more OHKOs. Good teammates to pair with Ursaring include Uxie, Claydol, and Omastar as they can easily set up entry hazards, and both Uxie and Claydol resist Ursaring's Fighting weakness.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance + Guts": {
        "description": "<p>This set is almost identical to the previous set, but with a slightly different approach to boosting Ursaring's Attack stat to sky-high levels. The previous set depended upon the opponent utilizing status to achieve a Guts boost, but this set automatically gives Ursaring a 50% Attack boost courtesy of Toxic Orb or Flame Orb. Much like the previous set, Ursaring's job is to rip holes in unprepared stall teams. Ursaring's hunger for fortifying its power doesn't stop merely at Guts, as Swords Dance is a great way to increase its already-high Attack. It may seem like overkill, but this helps Ursaring score a clean OHKO on certain walls. Facade is the STAB of choice, because with its Base Power now raised to 210 (factoring in STAB), Facade can deliver a bone-shattering blow on any physical wall that doesn't resist it.</p> <p>The remaining moves help improve Ursaring's type coverage. Close Combat is the main option because it guarantees an OHKO on Steelix and Regirock that run a physically-defensive nature. Earthquake acts as a safety option, and still has a high chance of OHKOing Steelix and Regirock. Crunch hurts opposing Ghost-types such as Rotom, Mismagius, and Spiritomb. Although Spiritomb won't pose much of a threat, Mismagius and Rotom have Substitute in their arsenal to foil Ursaring's sweep by stalling its HP down, so it's preferred that Ursaring catch Mismagius and Rotom on the switch with Crunch.</p> <p>Ursaring has two options for the item slot: Flame Orb and Toxic Orb. Flame Orb inflicts consistent damage with burn, while Toxic Orb deals less damage than Flame Orb for the first two turns; on the third turn, the damage is equal. After the third turn, the poison will deal more damage than the burn, making Flame Orb the superior choice if you plan on keeping Ursaring in for a period of time.</p> <p>Ursaring may not be easily walled, but it is vulnerable to getting revenge-killed by most Pokemon faster than it. To ensure Ursaring's sweep goes unhindered, it needs some team support. Packing Pokemon who can absorb any Fighting-type attacks from the likes of Hitmonlee or Primeape will greatly increase Ursaring's survivability survivability, good candidates include Slowbro and Uxie. Registeel makes a good partner as well, since it can absorb attacks from many of the common fast-and-hard hitters of UU, such as Swellow, Sceptile, or Alakazam. Bringing a good priority user to the battle, such as Hitmontop or Azumarill, can also give Ursaring an easier time sweeping. Unlike most of Ursaring's other sets, this one doesn't require Stealth Rock or Spikes support as Ursaring's damage output is so high. Providing dual screens support, however, can give Ursaring more bulk and allow it to survive a hit or two from the aforementioned faster Pokemon. Good teammates that can set up dual screens include Mesprit, Uxie, and Claydol as they all resist the Fighting-type attacks aimed at Ursaring.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Slapping a Choice Band on Ursaring lets it deal out immediate punishment to the opponent. If you're lucky enough, Ursaring can come in on a status move (preferably Will-O-Wisp or Toxic) and increase its Attack or Speed depending on the ability that you choose. Double-Edge is a sweet STAB option to punch holes in many physical walls in the UU tier, including Tangrowth, Donphan, and Milotic. Close Combat is picked over Earthquake because 252 HP / 0 Def Steelix will always survive two Earthquakes but has a chance to be 2HKOed by Close Combat, even without any residual damage. Since most of Ursaring's attacks are walled by Ghost-types, Crunch is a great way to lure out and smash Ghost-types right off the bat.</p> <p>Ursaring gets walled easily by Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon if it is locked into Double-Edge, so Pokemon that can easily dispose of them, such as Dugtrio or Milotic, make good partners. Ghost-type Pokemon can prove to be an obstacle as well if Ursaring is locked into Double-Edge or Close Combat, so packing a Pursuit user, such as Drapion or Spiritomb, will greatly aid it. Ursaring is also easily revenge-killed by a multitude of faster Pokemon, including Sceptile, Alakazam, and Swellow, so a Pokemon that can cover a variety of these threats, such as Registeel, will make a helpful teammate. Spikes and Stealth Rock support from Omastar, Qwilfish, or Uxie help increase Ursaring's KO rate. Will-O-Wisp could be quite problematic if you decide to use Quick Feet, so pairing Ursaring with Houndoom or Arcanine can help keep the offensive momentum running.</p>"

  "Piloswine": {
    "overview": "<p>Ever since its introduction, Piloswine has been continually bashed as a bad Pokemon due to its terrible defensive typing, in addition to horrid Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed stats, which was particularly bad since Ice-type moves were entirely special attacks. However, the 4th generation changed Piloswine's fortunes by introducing the physical/special split and giving it Ice Shard and Ice Fang, as well as an evolution in Mamoswine. Despite being overshadowed by every other Ground-type, including its evolution, Piloswine has enough tools at its disposal to inflict damage in UU, thanks to its good Attack stat, decent physical bulk, and STAB moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Piloswine has a couple of other options that it can use. Superpower is pretty awesome coming off of a base 100 Attack stat, but has overlapping coverage with Earthquake, which is more powerful, and also has that hateful Attack drop. A mixed attacking set with Ice Beam can catch physical walls off guard, but Piloswine's base 60 Special Attack stat is a huge letdown. Piloswine can attempt to run a physically defensive set with Curse, or patch up its horrid Special Defense with Amnesia; however, its poor typing leaves it vulnerable to many common attacking types. The furry pig can also run an Endeavor set, with its immunity to damaging weather, but priority is still an issue. A lead set is possible, thanks to access to Stealth Rock and Ice Shard, but many common leads beat it. Piloswine's other supporting moves include Reflect, Light Screen, Roar, and Charm, but its typing undermines the possibility of a support set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Due to Piloswine's excellent coverage, it is actually hard to switch in a counter, as a misprediction could easily result in the loss of the switch-in. Weezing is the best Pokemon to deal with Piloswine, thanks to its naturally high Defense, immunities to both Earthquake and Toxic, access to Will-O-Wisp, and ability to melt Piloswine away with Fire-type attacks. Uxie can set up Stealth Rock in Piloswine's face while taking its attacks easily. Bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Blastoise are also safe switch-ins against anything but Toxic. Hitmontop resists Stone Edge, significantly reduces Piloswine's offensive capabilities with Intimidate, and threatens it with STAB Close Combat and a Technician Fake Out/Mach Punch combination. Moltres can switch into either of Piloswine's STABs if Stealth Rock is not up, then proceed to burn it away with its Fire-type STAB. However, a mispredicted switch into Stone Edge would be a death sentence for the fiery bird.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Despite Piloswine's low Speed, its Attack stat is hard to ignore when combined with its natural bulk, coverage, immunities to both hail and sandstorm, and STAB Ice Shard. Ice Shard is Piloswine's primary attacking option, since it ignores Piloswine's horrible Speed stat thanks to its priority. Earthquake, running off STAB and Piloswine's above-average Attack stat, devastates any Pokemon that attempts to switch in on a predicted Ice Shard. Substitute gives Piloswine more time to survive, while also forcing the opponent's hand by revealing their switch-in without any risk to Piloswine itself. In addition, Substitute protects Piloswine from priority moves and status, two problems that severely limit Piloswine's potential. However, Ice Fang can be used to net important kills that Ice Shard does not. Stone Edge rounds out the set, providing excellent coverage with Earthquake, while also making Pokemon such as Moltres less keen to switch in.</p> <p>Toxic is a viable option over Ice Fang in order to hamper bulky Pokemon that love to switch into Piloswine, such as Blastoise, Milotic, and Rotom. Avalanche also deserves a mention over Ice Fang, as Piloswine will usually be going last, ensuring that Avalanche's secondary effect will almost always activate. Piloswine also has the physical bulk to survive a hit, making Avalanche even more worthy of a mention. A Choice Band can be used to increase Piloswine's power at the cost of being locked into a move. For example, with a Choice Band and a Jolly nature, Earthquake has a chance to 2HKO Utility Blastoise and Mono Attacker Spiritomb after Stealth Rock damage. A Jolly nature maximizes Piloswine's Speed, and is preferred so that Piloswine is not outrun by 8 Speed Milotic, but an Adamant nature is also viable for more power; with an Adamant nature, Piloswine has a higher chance of 2HKOing Donphan (with Ice Fang) and RestTalk Milotic (with Earthquake).</p> <p>Weezing is an excellent teammate because it cripples Fighting-types, such as Hitmontop and Hitmonlee, that may give Piloswine trouble. Moreover, Weezing can act as a decent status absorber with RestTalk. Chansey can also absorb status, sponge special attacks aimed at Piloswine, and provide Wish and Heal Bell support. Uxie and Mesprit resist Fighting-type moves, and can also set up Stealth Rock before crippling potential threats with Thunder Wave. Additionally, both Psychic-types can help against opposing Weezing, which is a huge threat to Piloswine. Houndoom appreciates Piloswine's abilities to lure Fire-type attacks and weaken the opposing team, giving it an opportunity to clean up stragglers. Slowbro and Slowking can take any Fire-, Water-, and Fighting-type moves that Piloswine attracts, and slow down other threats that might hinder Piloswine's sweep with Thunder Wave.</p>"

  "Octillery": {
    "overview": "<p>Octillery has always been a mixed bag. On one hand, its offenses are potent, and its movepool is phenomenal. On the other hand, its low Speed tends to hold it back from offensive stardom. That being said, its Suction Cups ability, combined with an amazing movepool and above-average offensive stats make it a top-notch recipient of Speed boosts, and unprepared foes will often be swept by it before they know what sucked them in. Octillery generally needs a bit of help to achieve its full offensive potential, but when it gets that support, it can be extremely deadly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Signal Beam, Flamethrower, and Psychic have yet to be mentioned, as they are largely overshadowed by Ice Beam, which covers many of the Pokemon these attacks are meant to hit. However, these attacks do allow Octillery to hit Psychic-, Steel-, and Fighting-types, respectively, for super effective damage. A Scope Lens set could be in tandem with Sniper to deliver more frequent and powerful critical hits, which are sure to decimate any opponent with the misfortune of encountering one. However, Octillery is a bit too slow and fragile to make this truly worthwhile, and it is better off boosting its power in more reliable ways. Toxic and Thunder Wave also have their merits. Toxic can hurt switch-ins such as Milotic and Ludicolo, while Thunder Wave is an unexpected way to bring opponents down to Octillery's level of Speed.</p> <p>Finally, a physical set, likely with a Choice Band attached, could wreak havoc on unsuspecting opponents. Octillery's Attack and Special Attack stats are equal, but special attacks are the focus of most of the sets due to their higher Base Power. However, it does get access to an impressive physical movepool that includes Waterfall, Gunk Shot, Seed Bomb, Bounce, Rock Blast, and Return. In addition to Choice Band, Octillery could also fare well as a physical Baton Pass recipient for the same reasons it makes a great special attacking one.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As expected, Chansey and bulky Waters make the best counters to Octillery. However, due to Octillery's awesome power, they all must be careful when switching in. Chansey must be wary of rare physical moves and switching in at low health, as Water Spout packs quite a punch. Ludicolo is probably the best all-around switch-in, as it can take any of Octillery's attacks, barring Gunk Shot and Signal Beam, for neutral damage and can threaten with a STAB Grass attack. Although rare, Mantine rivals Ludicolo for the best switch-in, with its high Special Defense, convenient typing, and Water Absorb ability, although it must watch out for Charge Beam. Milotic is extremely difficult to 2HKO and can wall Octillery with Recover. Toxicroak, with its Water Absorb ability, also makes a great switch-in, as it is only hit neutrally by Ice Beam on most Octillery sets.</p> <p>Baton Pass recipients, however, are typically a different story. Electrode outspeeds even +2 Modest Octillery and OHKOes with Thunderbolt, making it a great check to Baton Pass recipients. Sucker Punch from Pokemon like Absol and Cacturne will pack quite a wallop, as will Mach Punch from TechniTop and Extreme Speed from Arcanine. Fortunately, Octillery benefits greatly in this department from its Water-type, as it resists Bullet Punch and Ice Shard. Octillery can still struggle against many of the Pokemon listed in the last paragraph if it has not amassed any Special Attack boosts, although Charge Beam can certainly help.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Baton Pass Receiver": {
        "description": "<p>Octillery makes a natural choice for a Baton Pass recipient due to its offensive prowess and Suction Cups ability. The goal of this set is to Baton Pass Octillery the stat boosts it needs in order to sweep. Speed is the number one priority, as Octillery's base 45 Speed will not get the job done on its own. Special Attack boosts are also great, as Octillery will be looking to score OHKOs to avoid relying on its mediocre defenses. With four strong attacks in its arsenal, it hits almost every Pokemon in UU for super effective damage. Fire Blast is recommended, as it 2HKOes Registeel after Stealth Rock damage. Charge Beam is great for boosting Octillery's Special Attack if you can find the opportunity to use it. Life Orb nets Octillery some key KOs against common opponents and thus is the recommended option, but Lum Berry can also come in handy, as sleep or paralysis will end any chances of a sweep.</p> <p>Octillery's ability, Suction Cups, as well as its amazing movepool and poor Speed make it a prime recipient of Speed boosts in UU. Its respectable base 105 Special Attack combined with effective coverage makes Octillery a top-notch sweeper in UU after it is passed some Speed.</p> <p>The hard-hitting trio of Surf, Energy Ball, and Ice Beam provide excellent type coverage. Surf is a given for STAB, Energy Ball hits pesky Water-types that will inevitably attempt to wall you, and Ice Beam hits Grass-types and Altaria. In the last slot, Fire Blast is recommended for super effective type coverage, as it hits Magneton, Dry Skin Toxicroak, and, most importantly, Registeel, whom it 2HKOes 100% of the time after Stealth Rock. It also hits Grass-types harder than Ice Beam if you are willing to gamble with its 85% accuracy and can OHKO 4/0 Venusaur without Stealth Rock damage, which Ice Beam can only do 75% of the time after Stealth Rock. Charge Beam is also a nice addition to this set, as it allows Octillery to boost its Special Attack in addition to damaging Water-types that attempt to wall it. The drawback is finding a time it can actually squeeze in a Charge Beam, which can be rare and risky. However, if Octillery can get a boost or two in this way (or better yet, from a Baton Passer), it will turn into an absolute wrecking ball and can sweep entire teams in a heartbeat.</p> <p>Life Orb is the recommended item, as Octillery needs the extra power, especially if it is not receiving Special Attack boosts. The important KOs listed above are typically only achievable with the aid of Life Orb. In addition, Milotic is 2HKOed almost 90% of the time by Energy Ball after Stealth Rock damage, which is extremely important, as Recover would otherwise allow it to wall Octillery. Lum Berry, however, is a good secondary item for a number of reasons. First, it allows Octillery to come in on expected status moves and shrug them off, especially in the case of Registeel. It also protects against specially defensive Clefable and Altaria, who usually resort to Toxic in order to damage Octillery. Additionally, powerful priority moves, such as Absol's Sucker Punch, can do up to 2/3 damage on Octillery, which makes Life Orb dangerous at times.</p> <p>There is certainly no shortage of Speed Passers in UU. Ambipom, Solrock, and Lopunny all specialize in this, just to name a few. Blaziken actually pulls this off very well, despite its rarity as a Baton Passer. Passing Agility is about the last thing opponents expect Blaziken to do, which certainly works to its advantage, as common switch-ins like Milotic and Slowbro can do nothing to prevent it from sending boosts Octillery's way. Octillery also handles Surfs aimed at Blaziken quite easily and can utilize Charge Beam for super effective damage and a chance to boost its Special Attack. Nasty Plot Passers are also certainly welcome and will greatly increase Octillery's chances of sweeping. Mr. Mime, Ambipom, and Hypno can all do this effectively in UU. Stealth Rock also helps Octillery net some key KOs, as shown by the above calculations, so it is a must-have for this set if Special Attack boosts are not in the cards.</p>"
      },
      "Trick Room Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Octillery's low speed and good offensive stats make it a natural beneficiary of Trick Room. The key to using this set is to get Octillery in for free after using Trick Room and letting it run wild on your opponent's team. Water Spout is the focal point of this set, as it will score a KO for Octillery the vast majority of the time when used at full health. Surf is necessary to supplement Water Spout, although Waterfall is also an option if you fear Chansey. Expert Belt is preferred over Life Orb, as the latter would be shooting yourself in the foot due to the nature of Water Spout. Wave Incense is also an option to boost Water Spout's power against neutral opponents.</p> <p>For similar reasons to the Baton Pass Recipient set, Octillery also benefits immensely from Trick Room support. In Trick Room, it can not only utilize its terrible Speed, but also its newest move, Water Spout. Water Spout hits tremendously hard and essentially 2HKOes (at worst) everything that doesn't resist it. Water Spout is also the reason Life Orb should not be used, as Octillery will need to preserve its HP as best it can to do maximum damage. Expert Belt is a great option and will help score important 2HKOes on Water-types. Wave Incense is also an option if you would rather boost Octillery's Water-type moves, which isn't a bad idea on this set. Ice Beam and Energy Ball naturally follow Water Spout for type coverage, allowing Octillery to hit Grass-types, Water-types, and Altaria for super effective damage. Surf supplements Water Spout and is the stronger attack once Octillery's HP drops below 63%. Waterfall is also an option here, but is really only useful against Chansey.</p> <p>This set clearly revolves around giving Octillery the maximum amount of turns in Trick Room, which essentially means it needs a teammate that can twist the dimensions then get the hell out of the way. There are a number of Pokemon who can do this especially well, including Uxie, Mesprit, Exeggutor, and Solrock. All four of these Pokemon can set up Trick Room, and the former two can use U-turn, while the latter two can use Explosion. Both of these moves allow Octillery to not only get a free switch in, but also scout the opponent in some cases. Banette (Destiny Bond), Claydol (Explosion), and Cresselia (Lunar Dance) can also pull this off.</p>"
      },
      "Special Choice": {
        "description": "<p>The goal of these sets is to hit opponents as hard as possible with varying Speed and power, depending on your choice of items. A Modest nature with Choice Specs maximizes Octillery's power and allows it to outpace most walls in UU, as well. A Timid nature with Choice Scarf, meanwhile, morphs Octillery into an unexpected revenge killer, as it will outspeed all neutral base 100s and maximum Speed base 90s. Water Spout is the key to making both these sets successful, as it will hit extremely hard, even when unboosted. It is also very difficult to switch into, due to its excellent neutral type coverage, so Octillery won't mind being locked into it. Surf is necessary to cover Water Spout when Octillery's HP falls below 63% while Energy Ball and Ice Beam are givens as they provide excellent type coverage.</p> <p>Thanks to its newest move, Water Spout, Octillery makes a respectable Choice Scarf user in the lower tiers, while a Choice Specs set is a no-brainer. Although it is slower than fellow Water Spout users Blastoise and Wailord, it hits the hardest (even with a Timid nature). It also has the benefit of Energy Ball, which not only hits Water-types for higher damage than Hidden Power, but also has the opportunity to lower Special Defense.</p> <p>For Choice Specs, a Modest nature is recommended, as Octillery will want all the power it can get. A full-powered Choice Specs-boosted Water Spout is incredibly powerful coming off a 105 base Special Attack, especially when it gets STAB. To put it in perspective, it has a tiny chance to 2HKO Chansey after Stealth Rock damage, an incredible feat for any special attacker. Water Spout's impressive neutral type coverage also makes it very difficult to switch into safely, especially considering Octillery manages to outspeed many of UU's top walls. To avoid sounding like a broken record, Ice Beam and Energy Ball serve the same purpose here that they do in every Octillery set. When your HP falls below 63%, Surf will hit harder than Water Spout, which makes Surf a necessary supplementary STAB attack. It is also a good idea to use Surf if you are forced to take an attack before firing off one of your own, as Octillery's defenses will not keep it above 63% for long.</p> <p>For Choice Scarf, either nature is acceptable; as per the usual, the decision comes down to what you want to outspeed. Unfortunately, with a Modest nature, Octillery falls one heartbreaking Speed point shy of tying maximum Speed base 80s, which is necessary for it to fully check threats like Blaziken, Kabutops, Medicham, and Venusaur. It still does a decent job of checking these Pokemon, as they often will be running neutral-Speed natures. Timid nature earns the recommended choice, as you not only outspeed all base 80s, but also neutral base 100s and maximum Speed base 90s, a list that includes common variants of Arcanine, Magmortar, Miltank, Nidoking, Leafeon, and Moltres.</p> <p>With a Choice Scarf, Octillery excels as a revenge killer, as opponents will not expect Octillery to be attacking before sweepers like Moltres and Venusaur. Water Spout also makes it tricky to switch into, as any fragile Pokemon who doesn't resist it will surely take a beating. With its added Speed, Octillery can also rampage through teams in the late game once bulky Waters and speedy revenge killers are taken care of.</p> <p>Although these sets function quite differently, they benefit from many of the same teammates. Grass-types like Venusaur and Sceptile are recommended to cover Octillery's weaknesses and take out the bulky Waters that stand in its way. Taking out the few Pokemon who can easily take Octillery's attacks is important, as it will allow Octillery to punch holes in the rest of your opponent's Pokemon with ease. A Rapid Spinner is a must-have due to Water Spout's dependency on HP. Entry hazards of your own also help, as Octillery will often force switches. A Pokemon with Thunder Wave, such as Registeel, can help make opposing Pokemon slower than Octillery, which is a huge benefit.</p>"

It can learn Rapid Spin but it happens to be the worst spinner out there since it loses 50% of its health from Stealth Rock simply by switching in. Quick Attack is a priority option over Ice Shard if you want Delibird to hit those annoying Fire-types a little harder. Brick Break requires less prediction than Focus Punch, but it also has only half the power. Toxic is a generic option and can be used on any of the sets to inflict some status. Icy Wind can be used on a predicted switch-in to lower your opponents' Speed and aid in countering it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As far as UU Pokemon go, Blastoise makes an excellent counter. It doesn't fear any of Delibird's attacks, besides perhaps a Choice Specs Hidden Power Grass, and can KO back with ease. The same premise also holds for Dewgong. Fire-types such as Ninetales and Flareon can switch in on anything barring Water Pulse and set up. Stealth Rock will also ruin Delibird, forcing it to lose a full half of its health upon switching in. In short, Delibird has bad defenses and mediocre attacks. With its poor type coverage, low Speed, and poor defenses, almost anything can switch in on an attack that isn't super effective and KO back with a neutral attack.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Delibird has terrible stats, and its Attack is no exception. However, the Santa bird has a little trick in its bag in the form of Hustle. With this ability, the power of its physical attacks are boosted at the cost of their accuracy. By using Aerial Ace, you get to enjoy the Attack boost while still retaining the ability to always hit your opponent. Focus Punch hits the Rocks and Steels that are resistant to Flying attacks. Ice Shard is useful against faster opponents as it makes up for Delibird's average Speed, especially those that try to use Flail, Reversal, or Endeavor sets. Ice Punch provides a stronger STAB than Ice Shard, but Seed Bomb will allow Delibird to hit bulky Water-types such as Quagsire, Gastrodon, and Blastoise.</p> <p>Sleep Talk is an interesting option that can also be used in the last slot to absorb sleep attacks from foes like Venomoth. If you prefer the power that an Adamant nature provides, you may use that as an option. However, be aware that Delibird will lose the ability to outspeed positive-natured base 70s such as Luxray and Poliwrath and tie with other positive-natured base 75s such as Absol and Kingler.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {"description": "<p>Its special movepool is even worse than its physical, but Delibird does have higher Special Attack than Attack without Hustle, and Vital Spirit is a very useful ability. Ice-type moves will obviously be your main mode of attacking. Ice Beam is the more consistent choice, but when using Delibird you may find you need the extra power that Blizzard brings to the table. Signal Beam will allow Delibird to hit Grumpig and Hypno harder, who will otherwise wall this set. Water Pulse hits Ninetales and Flareon who can switch in freely on any other move. Hidden Power Grass is effective against Water-types except for Mantine, which will shrug it off easily, so if you are intent on hitting Mantine hard, use Hidden Power Electric.</p> <p>The EVs given maximize Delibird's Special Attack and Speed stats, as these are really the only stats in which Delibird benefits from investment.</p>"}

  "Houndoom": {
    "overview": "<p>Houndoom is UU's most powerful Nasty Plot sweeper, and often the most deadly as well. Its great dual STAB and auspicious stat distribution allow Houndoom to cut through unprepared or weakened teams like a hot knife through butter. Although its function is fairly one-dimensional, Houndoom's methods can vary greatly between sets, and this versatility is what makes Houndoom such a dangerous threat. Each of its sets has a different trick up its sleeve, and making assumptions about which set you're facing can often lead to your demise. Unfortunately, Houndoom's Stealth Rock weakness and subpar defensive stats mean it cannot take hits nearly as well as it gives them out.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>For all sets using Life Orb, a 29 HP IV decreases Life Orb recoil. With a perfect IV, Houndoom has an HP stat of 291, meaning it loses 29 HP to Life Orb recoil, while with a 29 HP IV it only has an HP stat of 289, corresponding to 28 HP lost to recoil. Although 29 HP IV Houndoom initially starts off with two fewer HP than 31 HP IV Houndoom, it gains one point relative to its counterpart every time it attacks; after two attacks, both Houndoom have equal HP, and at three or more attacks, 29 HP IV Houndoom comes out ahead. Basically, your choice should come down to how many attacks you expect Houndoom to fire off before it is KOed.</p> <p>Essentially all of Houndoom's viable moves and items have been mentioned in one set or another, and you can mix and match these moves and items to other sets to fit specific needs. For example, if you find that you like the power that Life Orb brings but want to retain the ability to OHKO Chansey with Beat Up, you can replace Sucker Punch with Beat Up on the Life Orb set. One option that hasn't been mentioned, though, is the Rest + Early Bird combination. This grants Houndoom the ability to fully restore HP and remove status effects at the cost of only one turn. Early Bird Houndoom can use Nasty Plot along with Flamethrower and Dark Pulse, or it can even use Flamethrower, Toxic, and Taunt with a specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 SpD with a Calm nature to serve as an effective stallbreaker.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Houndoom's most reliable counter is specially defensive Milotic with Haze. Physically defensive Milotic also works quite well in most cases, although it has issues dealing with the uncommon Passho Berry Houndoom. Other Water-type Pokemon are also good switch-ins since they resist Houndoom's STAB Fire attacks. The physically oriented ones, such as Azumarill, Kabutops, and Feraligatr, commonly pack Aqua Jet, which can KO Houndoom before it is able to attack. Blastoise is essentially a lesser Milotic in terms of countering Houndoom, but can check it neatly in a pinch.</p> <p>Priority attacks are also a great way to check Houndoom. Arcanine's Extreme Speed, Blaziken's Vacuum Wave, Hitmontop's Mach Punch, and the aforementioned Aqua Jet all guarantee OHKOs on Houndoom with Stealth Rock damage. Speaking of Arcanine, specially defensive versions counter Houndoom as well since Extreme Speed (even without Attack investment) 2HKOes Houndoom, while a boosted Dark Pulse doesn't OHKO Arcanine. Finally, Houndoom's frailty leaves it easy prey for faster Pokemon with a decently powered attack, such as Scyther, Tauros, Sceptile, and Swellow. Dugtrio deserves a special mention since Houndoom cannot switch out of its Earthquake due to Arena Trap. If Houndoom has Sucker Punch, Mismagius and Alakazam should be careful when revenge killing, and Dugtrio needs Substitute to come out on top.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This is Houndoom's bread-and-butter Nasty Plot set. Fire Blast and Dark Pulse are both used on this set to make the most of the excellent coverage afforded by Houndoom's dual STABs. Fire Blast is Houndoom's preferred sweeping move due to its high Base Power, while Dark Pulse hits the Fire-, Water-, and Rock-type Pokemon who resist Fire Blast for heavy damage. After a Nasty Plot, Moltres, Arcanine, and Rhyperior are OHKOed, and Milotic loses upwards of 70% HP.</p> <p>It may be odd to see Sucker Punch, a physical attack, on a Nasty Plot set, but the move is actually an excellent tool for Houndoom, both in assisting its own sweep and in putting a stop to opposing sweepers. Sucker Punch always OHKOes 4 HP Dugtrio after Stealth Rock, which means without Substitute and good prediction it cannot stop Houndoom's sweep. Sucker Punch also prevents Choice Scarf Rotom, most Alakazam, and some Mismagius from revenge killing Houndoom. Finally, even when Houndoom is not attempting a sweep, Sucker Punch allows it to finish off faster, weakened foes.</p> <p>Flash Fire is used instead of Early Bird to boost Houndoom's offensive potential; for example, if Houndoom switches into Weezing's or Arcanine's Will-O-Wisp, the subsequent +2 Fire Blast will be able to 2HKO Chansey. Since Houndoom is using both physical and special attacks, a Timid nature isn't optimal. Hasty is advisable instead of Naive because it makes more sense to lower Houndoom's already dismal Defense rather than to sacrifice its decent Special Defense. Also, Houndoom's resistances are usually seen in the form of special attacks (notably Shadow Ball), and higher Special Defense means it is easier to set up on weak special attackers, such as Weezing with Sludge Bomb.</p> <p>The EVs may seem complicated at first glance, but fulfill specific purposes. 224 Speed EVs and a Hasty nature are used to outpace Timid Rotom along with all slower Pokemon, including Timid Moltres and Venusaur. 100 Attack EVs with a Life Orb are necessary to ensure Sucker Punch always OHKOes 4 HP Dugtrio after Stealth Rock damage. The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack to maximize Houndoom's offensive punch. If you want Houndoom to tie with opposing base 95 Speed Pokemon, such as Leafeon and Drapion, you can shift a few EVs into Speed; however, this isn't the recommended spread since Houndoom needs as many EVs as possible to spread between its attacking stats.</p> <p>Houndoom is hard to counter perfectly because of its high damage output, but there are a few Pokemon who are good switch-ins. Milotic, particularly specially defensive variants, can take a boosted Dark Pulse at full health and KO Houndoom with Surf. Physically defensive Milotic should be wary of taking too much previous damage, though, as Dark Pulse deals 63.4% - 74.8%. Chansey can stall Houndoom out with Toxic and Wish / Protect as long as Houndoom doesn't get a Flash Fire boost. Note that if Houndoom starts using Nasty Plot on Protect, Chansey will probably have to switch out a turn or two before Toxic kills Houndoom (perhaps to a Pokemon who resists or is immune to Fire, or a sacrifice). Azumarill resists Houndoom's primary STAB, doesn't lose too much HP to an unboosted Dark Pulse, and can use its priority Aqua Jet to OHKO Houndoom before Houndoom can attack again. There are three Pokemon in UU that resist the combination of Fire- and Dark-type attacks: Houndoom, Blaziken, and Thick Fat Hariyama. Against other Houndoom, the Houndoom who has more boosts under its belt wins with Dark Pulse. Blaziken is frail and doesn't appreciate eating Fire Blast too often, but its Vacuum Wave makes quick work of Houndoom. Thick Fat Hariyama with a specially defensive spread is an excellent Houndoom counter. Its \"weakness\" is its low utility outside of this role, as other common Fire-types in UU either have strong physical attacks (Arcanine and Blaziken) or have a super effective STAB attack (Moltres). Faster Pokemon who can take a Sucker Punch, such as Tauros, Scyther, and Ambipom, are good revenge killers.</p> <p>If you're not keen on using Sucker Punch on this set, there are some Hidden Powers that may interest you. Hidden Power Flying hits two of the three UU Pokemon who resist Houndoom's STAB combination (the last, other Houndoom, is not a big concern) super effectively, but has no utility outside of that. Hidden Power Grass is one-sixth more powerful than Dark Pulse against Water-types, but even so, cannot OHKO Milotic. Obviously, if you use Hidden Power in the last slot, Houndoom doesn't require any Attack EVs, so a simple 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe spread with a Timid nature works best. A Modest nature also becomes more viable with Hidden Power Grass, since Houndoom can then OHKO Bold Milotic with a bit of residual damage.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Even though Houndoom's higher offensive stat is Special Attack, it would be a shame to waste its base 90 Attack stat, especially when it is backed up by STAB attacks like Pursuit and Sucker Punch. The main draw of this set is its ability to efficiently eliminate opposing Ghost-types, especially Rotom and Mismagius. While there are several viable UU Pokemon with STAB Pursuit, Houndoom is the only one immune to Will-O-Wisp, which greatly enhances its performance against defensive Ghost-types.</p> <p>Pursuit is a given to take advantage of Houndoom's ghostbusting abilities. Sucker Punch is an excellent utility move for Houndoom, as with proper prediction it allows Houndoom to eliminate weakened sweepers and faster threats like Alakazam. Crunch is the preferred option in the third slot; while it may seem odd to use three physical Dark-type attacks on the same set, Pursuit and Sucker Punch are only situationally useful attacks, while Crunch provides reliable power. Thunder Fang is also an option in this slot if you're concerned about hitting Moltres and Milotic for more damage. It almost always OHKOes Moltres after Stealth Rock damage (Crunch doesn't on average) and means Milotic must think twice before switching in if it is moderately weakened. Finally, Houndoom uses a high-powered special Fire-type attack in the last slot to blast through Pokemon like Donphan, Tangrowth, Venusaur, and Registeel. Fire Blast deals more damage than Overheat over two turns, but Overheat is more effective against physically bulky targets neutral to Fire, such as Donphan, and against Pokemon who would force Houndoom out before it gets a second chance to attack.</p> <p>The Speed EVs let Houndoom outpace Timid Rotom. Attack is maximized, and the remaining EVs are placed into Special Attack to power up Fire Blast. Houndoom needs a Speed-boosting nature that doesn't lower either of its offensive stats; Naive is out of the question as it makes Houndoom take more damage from Mismagius's and Rotom's Shadow Ball and Thunderbolt, so Hasty is chosen.</p> <p>Mixed Houndoom is arguably the best way to eliminate Ghost-type Pokemon in UU. It cannot be burned, and the combination of Pursuit and Sucker Punch means the only way Rotom and Mismagius can escape is if they use Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Fighting on the switch and also win the subsequent prediction game. Spiritomb, the final UU Ghost-type, is not hit super effectively by Houndoom's Dark-type attacks, but usually cannot deal any significant damage in return. Combined with the possibility of Houndoom using Nasty Plot, Spiritomb is likely to switch out, allowing Houndoom to weaken it with Pursuit. Pokemon that benefit from the absence of Ghosts are good teammates for Houndoom. Donphan is probably the most effective; Houndoom traps and eliminates the Ghost-types that threaten to block Rapid Spin, and in return Donphan spins away Stealth Rock for Houndoom. The pair also have decent synergy together, as Mismagius or Rotom switching into Donphan are more likely to use Shadow Ball or Will-O-Wisp than Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Fighting. Choice Band users like Tauros or Hitmonlee also enjoy Ghost-types out of the way so they can use their STAB attacks with greater freedom. Swords Dance Toxicroak is also a very effective partner. Defensively, Toxicroak loves switching into Water attacks aimed at Houndoom, while Houndoom gets free switches when Toxicroak is targeted by Psychic-type moves. Many teams counter Swords Dance Toxicroak with either a Ghost-type packing Will-O-Wisp or a Psychic-type like Uxie; Houndoom is able to remove both of those counters, although it might get paralyzed by Uxie's Thunder Wave.</p> <p>Using a specially-based spread and Dark Pulse over Crunch is also an option. 100 Atk / 184 SpA / 224 Spe is recommended; the Attack EVs guarantee a Sucker Punch OHKO on Dugtrio after Stealth Rock. This variant performs better against Registeel, Slowbro, Moltres (Dark Pulse OHKOes with Stealth Rock while Crunch does not on average), and Intimidate Arcanine, but cannot 2HKO Chansey and deals less damage to Milotic. Pursuit and Sucker Punch become weaker as well; while Houndoom still OHKOes switching Rotom and Mismagius with Pursuit, the decrease in power is noticeable when using non-switch Pursuit and Sucker Punch.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Standard Nasty Plot Houndoom has issues getting past Water-type Pokemon--both defensive ones, such as Milotic, and offensive ones with Aqua Jet, such as Azumarill and Kabutops. With a Passho Berry, Houndoom has a good shot at beating all three. After one Nasty Plot, Hidden Power Grass 2HKOes Milotic, OHKOes Kabutops, and has a good chance of OHKOing Azumarill after Stealth Rock damage. Fire Blast and Dark Pulse provide great coverage in tandem, hitting every UU Pokemon outside of Blaziken, Houndoom, and Thick Fat Hariyama for at least neutral damage. Beat Up can be used instead of Hidden Power Grass in the last slot. If your team has three or four healthy team members left, it will usually OHKO Chansey, who otherwise walls this set. This does make Houndoom less effective against opposing Water-types, but Dark Pulse can usually pick up the slack, as it will still OHKO Kabutops and 2HKO Bold Milotic.</p> <p>A Timid nature and straightforward EV spread are used to maximize sweeping potential. To deal more damage to specially defensive Milotic, especially variants with Haze, a Modest nature can be used instead. This still allows Houndoom to outpace base 80 Speed Pokemon like Venusaur and Kabutops, but makes it slower than Rotom, Moltres, Toxicroak, and Qwilfish.</p> <p>In contrast to most Houndoom sets, this one is supposed to take a hit when it attempts a sweep. This means you should take care in keeping Houndoom's health relatively high, lest it gets weakened to the point that a Water attack KOes it through the Passho Berry. For example, Azumarill's Choice Band Aqua Jet has a fair chance to OHKO Houndoom if it has taken Stealth Rock damage but cannot KO a full HP Houndoom. Alternatively, if Houndoom switches into a mispredicted Sludge Bomb from defensive Weezing and Stealth Rock is up, it won't have enough health left to survive Milotic's Surf. Beyond highlighting the importance of playing this set carefully, these examples also illustrate why Rapid Spin support is important for this Houndoom. Donphan and Kabutops are the spinners most likely to fit on a team with Houndoom due to their offensive nature, but Hitmontop and Blastoise are solid choices as well.</p> <p>Since Houndoom often lures and KOes the opposing team's bulky Water, it makes a good teammate for Pokemon that appreciate their absence. Feraligatr, especially bulky variants, have a much easier time sweeping when Milotic is eliminated. Bulky stat boosters like Curse Registeel, Calm Mind Spiritomb, and Calm Mind Clefable also benefit from the absence of Haze Milotic, since Milotic is many teams' primary counter to these Pokemon. Rock Polish Rhyperior and Aggron become more effective when Aqua Jet Azumarill and Kabutops are eliminated, and they certainly don't mind Houndoom weakening Milotic and Blastoise.</p> <p>This set mainly has problems with faster sweepers, priority attacks, and Chansey. Alakazam, Swellow, Scyther, Dugtrio, and most other faster, moderately powered sweepers can take Houndoom down with a STAB or super effective attack. While Passho Berry provides a buffer against Aqua Jet, it does nothing to alleviate the damage done by Arcanine's Extreme Speed or Blaziken's Vacuum Wave, both of which deal upwards of 70% to Houndoom.</p>"
      },
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Houndoom has the Speed and offensive capabilities to act as an effective anti-lead. It has great coverage with its dual STAB, and the given moveset allows Houndoom to effectively deal with the most common UU leads. Dark Pulse deals with Uxie, Mesprit, and Alakazam, while Fire Blast is useful against Spiritomb, Scyther, Nidoking, and Pinsir. Sucker Punch gives Houndoom the advantage over other attacking leads as it allows him to beat Focus Sash and priority users. Hidden Power Grass allows Houndoom to win against Cloyster, Omastar, Kabutops, and Rhyperior leads, but Pursuit can be used to trap leads like Mismagius who will most likely switch out.</p> <p>Houndoom has a variety of options to choose from depending on specific team needs. Focus Sash protects Houndoom against faster Pokemon and mispredictions, while using Lum Berry aids it against Uxie's Thunder Wave. Counter, when combined with a Hasty nature, Defense IV of 0, and Focus Sash, can be used to score a surprise KO against physical leads. Taunt prevents entry hazards from being set up. An alternative EV spread of 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe can be used to Speed tie with Leafeon and Arcanine at the cost of a slightly weaker Sucker Punch. Picking Early Bird will make it easier for Houndoom to come out on top against sleep-inducing leads, but Flash Fire has more overall utility.</p> <p>Although Houndoom is frail, it still has its uses later in the game. The given EVs allow it to outspeed Rotom, which also means it is faster than Moltres and Venusaur. Toxicroak makes a great teammate for Houndoom as it loves switching into Milotic, one of the most reliable counters for this set.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Houndoom usually doesn't have Speed issues, but attaching a Choice Scarf makes it a competent revenge killer for Rock Polish sweepers as well as naturally faster Pokemon like Mismagius, Alakazam, and Sceptile. Houndoom's Overheat and Dark Pulse provide great coverage, hitting the majority of the metagame for at least neutral damage. Pursuit is really what sets Houndoom apart from other Choice Scarf Pokemon, since it places Rotom and Mismagius in a checkmate position. Hidden Power Grass hits Rhyperior for big damage, while Toxic can cripple a predicted Milotic switch-in.</p> <p>228 Speed EVs ensure Houndoom is one point faster than Jolly Rock Polish Torterra and three points faster than Timid Choice Scarf Rotom. It takes too many Attack EVs to guarantee that Pursuit always OHKOes a switching 252 HP Mismagius, but 84 EVs ensures that if Stealth Rock is up and Mismagius switches out of Pursuit, it cannot switch back in without fainting to entry hazards (in other words, Pursuit takes off at least 13/16th of Mismagius's HP). The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Attack to power up Houndoom's main moves. If you find this set isn't hitting hard enough, changing its nature to Mild and / or shifting EVs into Special Attack is acceptable. A Mild nature and 160 Speed EVs will beat Jolly Rock Polish Aggron, while 124 EVs are required to outpace Adamant Rock Polish Torterra. As always, a Defense-lowering nature is preferable to make the most of Houndoom's decent Special Defense and resistance to Ghost- and Dark-type attacks.</p> <p>As with most revenge killers, Houndoom is prone to being setup bait after it scores a KO. Opposing Houndoom and Blaziken set up on all of Houndoom's attacks, Water-type sweepers like Kabutops and Feraligatr set up on Overheat, and Toxicroak and its fellow Fighting-types set up on Dark Pulse. Finding Pokemon to cover every possible sweeper isn't very efficient, so checking to see if your team can handle the opponent's likely set-up sweeper during a battle is recommended before you lock Houndoom into an attack. It may be tempting to use Fire Blast instead of Overheat to let less Pokemon set up, but Overheat's extra power is appreciated for a set that doesn't have a boosting item or maximized Special Attack. Plus, any Pokemon that can set up on -2 Overheat can probably also set up on Fire Blast.</p>"

  "Donphan": {
    "overview": "<p>Donphan is one of the more reliable Pokemon to consider for any balanced team in UU because of its ability to spin away entry hazards. The common presence of Stealth Rock and even Spikes in UU makes Donphan ever more popular. Another interesting thing to note about Donphan is its ability to beat just about every Ghost-type you are likely to encounter in UU, ranging from Spiritomb to Rotom. However, its lack of recovery really does hamper Donphan's ability to tank hits repeatedly, and outside of Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, Donphan has very few support moves to take advantage of. The sturdy elephant is not the most spectacular Pokemon around, but it is a solid and reliable supporter that can hit hard when the need arises.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Donphan does not have many competitively viable options outside of what has already been mentioned. A combination of Rest + Sleep Talk can be utilized if your team is in essential need of a defensive tank that is guaranteed to last, but the mediocre type coverage between Earthquake and either Assurance and Stone Edge is not enough in consideration of the number of Pokemon that can potentially set up on Donphan while it's asleep. Donphan can run Toxic in the fourth moveslot of either of the two sets, but Toxic is largely unneeded when Donphan can simply eliminate common switch-ins with Earthquake or Assurance. A Rock Polish set can be considered, but Donphan lacks the Speed and type coverage to pull off a sweep most of the time. Body Slam can be used to paralyze opposing Pokemon if you're lucky, but the lack of power is noticeable. Poison Jab hits Tangrowth super effectively, but Tangrowth's massive Defense stat makes it a worthless option. Counter can nab a surprise KO against physical attackers like Altaria. Endeavor and Flail are gimmicky options at best.</p> <p>On the Rapid Spin set, transferring 80 EVs from HP to Speed will enable Donphan to outpace minimum Speed base 60 Pokemon, such as Clefable and Weezing. This change can have situational utility; for instance, Donphan can hit a weakened Weezing with Head Smash before being burned by Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Most Water-types are capable of switching into Donphan with ease and threatening it with a STAB Surf. Both Milotic and Slowbro have enough physical bulk to withstand an Earthquake or two, with the former also outpacing Donphan. Ludicolo resists Earthquake and can threaten Donphan with either of its STAB moves. Azumarill can survive one Earthquake and deal heavy damage with boosted Waterfalls. Even Blastoise can come in a few times and KO Donphan with Surf, although its lack of recovery hurts. Poliwrath can also switch into Earthquake with little trouble and deal huge damage with Waterfall in return.</p> <p>Flying-types are capable of switching into Donphan's Earthquake with impunity and threaten Donphan with boosted attacks, provided Donphan does not have Stone Edge or Ice Shard in the fourth moveslot. Moltres can scorch Donphan with a Life Orb-boosted Fire Blast, and Swellow can easily wear down Donphan with a Guts-boosted, STAB Facade, while Altaria can set up on Donphan with Dragon Dance and proceed to deal heavy damage with Outrage.</p> <p>Torterra and Tangrowth can switch into any of Donphan's sets with ease due to their mighty physical bulk and KO it with a super effective Grass-type attack or stall it out with Leech Seed. Venusaur, while it doesn't resist Earthquake, can switch in and KO Donphan with Leaf Storm, set up Swords Dance, or put something to sleep with Sleep Powder.</p> <p>Outside of Torterra and Tangrowth, Weezing is the most reliable counter to Donphan, as its high Defense and immunity to Earthquake means that Donphan will hardly be able to land a scratch. Will-O-Wisp also shuts down Donphan completely, further nullifying its attempts to wear the opposing team down. With some EV investment in Special Attack, Weezing can even 3HKO Donphan with Flamethrower or Fire Blast.</p> <p>In general, a reliable (special) Grass-, Ice-, or Water-type will do a lot of damage to Donphan, so the best counters have such a move as well as a high defensive ability to take Earthquakes or Assurances.</p>",

      "Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<p>Donphan is one of the few viable spinners in UU, with several key traits that make using it advantageous over using Hitmontop and Claydol, such as its monstrous base 120 Attack and Defense stats and ability to hurt Ghost-types with either Earthquake or Assurance. Donphan, being so physically defensive, also acts as a counter to some of the major physical threats in the metagame, such as Swords Dance Drapion, Swords Dance Toxicroak, and, assuming you are running either Ice Shard or Head Smash in the fourth moveslot, Swords Dance Scyther.</p> <p>This set revolves around Rapid Spin, which removes any entry hazards your opponent might have laid down during the match, in particular Spikes and Stealth Rock. Earthquake is the main STAB move of choice, as even a common switch-in in Spiritomb is heftily damaged by it, possibly being 2HKOed after Stealth Rock damage. Assurance prevents Ghost-types with Levitate, namely Rotom and Mismagius, from coming in freely, as even the most defensive variants will lose at least 75% of their health from a 100-Base Power Assurance, with Stealth Rock factored in. Finally, the last moveslot is up to preference. Stealth Rock is a useful support option on Donphan, as it gets many opportunities to switch in and cause further trouble for the opponent. Ice Shard allows Donphan to hit Flying-types for a decent amount of damage and pick off weakened Dragon Dance Altaria and Rock Polish Torterra. Despite Stone Edge's higher Base Power, its mediocre accuracy makes it slightly inferior to Ice Shard.</p> <p>The EVs for this set are rather straightforward. Maximum Attack is used on Donphan. as it needs the ability to immediately threaten Ghost-types that attempt to switch in to block Rapid Spin, while maximum HP maximizes its overall bulk. The old standard of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe can also be run on this set, along with the possible support options of Roar, Rest, or Knock Off, but the lower physical bulk of Pokemon in UU makes maxing out Attack a better option, as Donphan now has the chance of threatening counters instead of simply stalling them out.</p> <p>Donphan is best paired with teammates that can switch into the most common attacking types aimed at Donphan, such as Water, Ice, and Grass. Milotic is a useful partner that can switch into Water- and Ice-type attacks, and its access to recovery along with largely superior defenses allows Milotic to also counter some other special attackers that can give Donphan trouble, such as Life Orb Blaziken and Calm Mind Mismagius; granted, they are unlikely to switch into Donphan to begin with. Grass-type attacks are easily covered by Scyther and Moltres, which both pack a 4x resistance to them. Both are dangerously weak to Stealth Rock, but pairing either of them with Donphan is extremely beneficial because of its ability to spin away the entry hazard.</p> <p>If you want to use Donphan on a more defensive team, there are several noteworthy teammates you can consider for Donphan. Chansey is a useful partner because it can switch into the special attacks that threaten Donphan and can make up for Donphan's lack of recovery with Wish. Venusaur has the benefit of carrying resistances to the Grass- and Water-type attacks normally directed at Donphan and can absorb Toxic Spikes, the entry hazard that Donphan has most trouble with.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Although Donphan is normally seen as a defensive tank that focuses on taking hits, this set instead focuses on Donphan's base 120 Attack stat and its great STAB move in Earthquake. Choice Band provides Donphan with an Attack stat of 558, which is simply overwhelming against some of its usual counters. For example, Spiritomb is always outsped and 2HKOed by Earthquake, while Rotom and Mismagius are always OHKOed by a 100-Base Power Assurance after Stealth Rock damage. Simply put, with an already great Defense and an even higher Attack with Choice Band equipped, Donphan is capable of putting large holes in the opponent's team with little effort.</p> <p>Earthquake is Donphan's primary attacking option, and it puts a serious hurt on anything that doesn't resist or is not immune to it. Assurance is needed to hit Levitating Ghost-types like Rotom and Mismagius, both of which enjoy switching into Donphan to block any attempts to Rapid Spin and setting up themselves. The third moveslot gives Donphan an option to hit Flying-types, which are immune to Earthquake. Head Smash has a much higher Base Power than Ice Shard, making it the preferred option, despite the shaky accuracy; nevertheless, Ice Shard is a useful option for its 100% accuracy, lack of recoil, and ability to prevent Torterra from walling Donphan with ease. For the last moveslot, Rapid Spin is quite a useful option for eliminating the opponent's entry hazards, which is capitalized by this set's ability to beat any Ghost-type one-on-one. If your team does not have much of an issue with entry hazards, Ice Shard can be used over Rapid Spin as well.</p> <p>The EVs maximize Donphan's offensive capabilities. 84 Speed EVs allow Donphan to outspeed base 60s, such as Clefable and Weezing, that do not invest in Speed, as well as most Chansey, Registeel, and Azumarill. Maximum Attack is obvious, while the rest of the EVs are dumped into HP to cushion Donphan's reasonable bulk.</p> <p>This set's teammates should handle Flying-types, Torterra, and Milotic, all of which can switch into Donphan's Earthquake with impunity. Registeel counters most of the Flying-types of UU and can set up Stealth Rock to cripple the ones it doesn't. It also provides support with Thunder Wave to allow Donphan to outspeed and 2HKO Pokemon it normally couldn't, though Earthquake will no longer 2HKO Milotic with Marvel Scale activated. Venusaur is a good teammate for countering Milotic if your team does not have paralysis support, as it can switch into Milotic's Water-type attacks with ease and threaten it with a STAB Leaf Storm or Power Whip or set up a Swords Dance as Milotic deals minimal damage. Spikes, in particular, is a very useful strategy, since Donphan is great at forcing switches, and they can be set up easily by Qwilfish or Omastar. Torterra is a bit trickier to handle, as not many Pokemon can switch into Torterra without the risk of getting outsped after a Rock Polish; however, having a Pokemon that can bypass Torterra's Speed with priority, such as Hitmontop, or simply having a revenge killer, such as Choice Scarf Rotom with Hidden Power Ice, is often the best response to Torterra. Defensive versions are easier to handle, since you don't have to worry about taking too much damage from Earthquake or Wood Hammer and getting outsped, but it's often best if you can just force Torterra to switch out by switching in a Pokemon likely to carry an Ice-type move. Moltres is an overall good counter to Torterra lacking a Rock-type move, and it can even benefit from Donphan's ability to spin away Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Offensively, Moltres is one of the best partners to this set, as it can usually sweep through a team that has been weakened by Donphan's Earthquakes and hopeful entry hazard support. As mentioned many times before, Donphan even has the ability to spin away Stealth Rock, meaning Moltres has little reason to worry about taking any damage as it switches in. Mismagius carrying Taunt is also an interesting option for an offensive partner, as with Calm Mind, it also gets multiple opportunities to benefit from the holes in the opponent's team made by Donphan and sweep. For example, Milotic, normally a counter to Mismagius, will often be weakened enough by Donphan's Earthquake to where it can no longer switch in and Haze away Mismagius's stat boosts.</p>"

  "Porygon2": {
    "overview": "<p>Porygon2 is a quirky Pokemon, both aesthetically and competitively. The bizarre Internet duck is one of the most versatile Pokemon available. Two great abilities, Trace and Download, allow it to become a good tailor-made counter to just about any bothersome Pokemon your team may be having trouble with. Not only that, but it also has an expansive movepool, good defenses, and a decent Special Attack stat. However, Porygon2's Speed is troubling, and its Normal typing, without a giant HP and Special Defense stat to back it up like Chansey has, is just OK defensively. Also, if you tailor Porygon2 to counter a specific threat and your opponent doesn't even have that Pokemon on their team, then it essentially becomes dead weight. Porygon2 can really mess with teams in the right hands, but most times it will be too specialized to warrant a team slot, especially when there are better general answers to UU's top threats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Porygon2's movepool is exceptional, so there are lots of options and sets it can perform that are not listed above. A Choice Specs set can be run using the same moves as the Choice Scarf set; however, the lack of Speed is quite terrible and leaves Porygon2 utterly exposed to faster threats and Fighting-types. A Gravity support set of Gravity, Thunder, Blizzard, and Recover with Leftovers and a defensive EV spread can be run, but most Gravity teams are gimmicky and Porygon2 is better off utilizing Trick Room. Pain Split can be used as an alternative healing option to Recover, but it is unreliable and Porygon2's HP is too high to make much use of it. Porygon2 can also make a great weather supporter with Rain Dance or Sunny Day.</p> <p>Porygon2's signature moves Conversion, Conversion 2, and Sharpen can all be used, but they are gimmicky at best and Porygon2's physical movepool and stats are anything but flattering. Magic Coat is a neat little trick that can reflect Leech Seed and status onto the foe, but there isn't any room for it on the sets listed. Shadow Ball is a nice move to nail Ghost-types for super effective damage, but Porygon2 is better off using the BoltBeam combo alongside Tri Attack. Finally, Psych Up is available, but is far too situational to see any use.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Specially bulky Fighting-types, such as Hitmonlee and Hariyama, make the best possible counters to Porygon2, as they are able to smash right through its defenses with their STAB attacks, are immune to or don't mind paralysis, and also don't provide Porygon2 with a Special Attack boost should it be running Download. Azumarill, Absol, and Ursaring also easily break Porygon2 with Superpower (in the case of the former two) or Close Combat (in the case of the latter). Rhyperior easily switches into Porygon2 without fear for the most part and tears it to shreds with either Stone Edge or Earthquake. Finally, Chansey, Clefable, and Registeel wall non-Charge Beam Porygon2 thanks to their high Special Defense.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Duck": {
        "description": "<p>This is Porygon2's best defensive set for covering the wide variety of threats that reside in UU. Discharge and Ice Beam are the main choices, as they form the BoltBeam combo that nails every Pokemon in UU for at least neutral damage, with the exceptions of Lanturn, Magneton, and Shedinja. Discharge is the recommended move over Thunderbolt for the raised paralysis chance, which can help Porygon2 not only to get the jump on foes but also to support its teammates. However, Thunderbolt can be chosen if you find the damage output from Discharge disappointing. Recover lets Porygon2 keep itself healthy and allows it to become a general nuisance to your opponent. Finally, Toxic is chosen for the last slot to whittle down bulky foes, such as Regirock, Miltank, Uxie, and Spiritomb. If you find Toxic to be conflicting with Discharge's paralysis too much, then Thunder Wave can be chosen for the last slot to ensure that Porygon2 spreads paralysis on faster threats, such as Mismagius, Absol, and Kangaskhan.</p> <p>The EV spread is designed to give Porygon2 as much special bulk as possible, with 40 EVs placed into Special Attack for a chance to 2HKO offensive variants of Moltres with Discharge. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 216 Def / 40 SpA with a Bold nature can be used, but most physically attacking threats in UU carry a Fighting-type attack that easily smashes through Porygon2's invested defenses anyway.</p> <p>Trace is the recommended ability, as it is more defensive in nature than Download and allows Porygon2 to solidly counter some of UU's top threats. Porygon2 can Trace Flash Fire from Houndoom and Arcanine and absorb their Fire-type attacks; the same can be done to Volt Absorb Lanturn and Water Absorb users such as Quagsire and Poliwrath. Porygon2 can also Trace Intimidate from Arcanine and Hitmontop to buffer their attacks and then proceed to zap them with Discharge. Some other strategies include Tracing Dugtrio's Arena Trap and eliminating it with Ice Beam and Tracing Pressure from Spiritomb and Moltres and stalling them out of PP, assuming they aren't carrying Toxic.</p> <p>Download can be used over Trace to turn Porygon2 into a more offensive tank. Porygon2 will almost always be looking for Special Attack boosts, so some Pokemon that it can take advantage of include Slowbro, Cloyster, and Donphan. However, even with the Special Attack boost, Porygon2 still only manages a 2HKO on them, making the boost near worthless and Trace the better choice.</p> <p>Porygon2's main goal with this set is to paralyze and/or cripple as many foes as possible while also countering some problem Pokemon your team may be having trouble facing. Examples of excellent teammates that excel with the majority of the opponent's team paralyzed are Rhyperior, Marowak, and Azumarill. Great defensive teammates for Porygon2 include Ghost-types such as Mismagius and Rotom, which can absorb Fighting-type attacks. In return, Porygon2 can take on most Houndoom and other Dark-types and paralyze them or put them out of commission, though Porygon2 must beware of Absol's Superpower. Registeel and Aggron also make good teammates, as they can absorb hits from other strong physical attackers, such as Swellow, Scyther, and, in Registeel's case, Azumarill. Claydol gets a special mention as a teammate, as it can effortlessly switch into users of the EdgeQuake combination, such as Rhyperior without Megahorn, Aggron, and most Fighting-types, and threaten them out with Earth Power and Psychic.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>This set capitalizes on Porygon2's ability to be a self-supporting Trick Room sweeper. After setting up Trick Room, Porygon2 can begin its BoltBeam-backed assault, hitting everything but Lanturn, Magneton, and Shedinja for at least neutral damage in UU. The fourth moveslot comes down to how you would like to play Porygon2. Tri Attack hits Lanturn for neutral damage and adds a STAB attack to Porygon2's arsenal. Recover is the more defensive option, allowing Porygon2 to attempt multiple sweeps and shrug off any damage it may take upon switching in. Be wary of using Recover in Trick Room, however; Trick Room only lasts for five turns, during which Porygon2 needs to be focused on sweeping. Finally, Hidden Power Fighting is a reliable option to hit Steel- and Dark-types harder and make a larger dent in Chansey as it switches in. Note that Porygon2 can't KO it, however.</p> <p>If you'd like to make Porygon2 a bit bulkier, an alternative spread of 252 HP / 156 SpA / 100 SpD is available. Utilizing this spread makes setting up Trick Room against the likes of Milotic and special Venusaur much easier. However, with this spread, Porygon2 will miss out on a 2HKO against specially defensive Clefable with Tri Attack.</p> <p>Because this set's goal is to sweep under Trick Room, Porygon2 needs to garner as much power as possible. With Download, Porygon2 has the chance to raise its Special Attack by one stage. So, when you're ready to commence a sweep, switch Porygon2 into a foe like Exeggutor or Weezing, get a Special Attack boost, use Trick Room, and proceed to sweep.</p> <p>Porygon2's teammates are quite variable and should depend on how you plan to use Trick Room, whether for Porygon2's benefit alone or for the team as a whole. While Trick Room is in effect, Pokemon with low Speed such as Azumarill, Hariyama, and Slowbro are all decent options, since all three have a much easier time sweeping in Trick Room. Azumarill is a fantastic Trick Room sweeper thanks to its low Speed and its ability to continue the sweep when Trick Room ends with Aqua Jet. Hariyama's ability Guts allows it to absorb status afflictions that might hinder other Pokemon. In fact, while under Trick Room, paralysis boosts both Hariyama's Attack and Speed, since it will quarter Hariyama's already low Speed stat and activate Guts at the same time. Slowbro's ability to set up Trick Room and use Slack Off to recover lost HP makes it an excellent supporting tank on Trick Room teams, although its sibling, Slowking, is a better offensive choice, since it can boost its Special Attack more quickly via Nasty Plot.</p> <p>Should you choose to make Porygon2 a standalone Trick Room sweeper, your options for teammates become much more conventional. Absol makes a great switch-in against Ghost-types that expect Tri Attack, as does Skuntank. Skuntank may be the better of the two, however, since it's not weak to the Fighting-type attacks that many Ghost-types carry. Blaziken is able to go on the offensive much more easily with the absence of Milotic—which this set KOes with minimal effort—and can handle any Registeel that may try to stall out Trick Room or wall Porygon2. This set struggles against Hitmontop, especially the TechniTop set, so plan accordingly. Common checks for Hitmontop include Flying-types such as Swellow, Ghost-types like Spiritomb, and Psychic-types such as the aforementioned Slowbro.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb Duck": {
        "description": "<p>When equipped with Life Orb, Porygon2 becomes both an effective all-out attacker and a good tank. Tri Attack is a must on this set, as it gives Porygon2 an effective STAB move to work with and nails a majority of UU for neutral damage. Ice Beam and Thunderbolt are the recommended choices for the next two slots to form the BoltBeam combination, which, when paired with Tri Attack, gives Porygon2 neutral coverage on all Pokemon in UU, with the exceptions of Magneton and Shedinja. Hidden Power Fighting can be used over Thunderbolt to nail Registeel, Clefable, and Chansey for super effective damage and even has a chance to 2HKO Registeel after Stealth Rock. If you're using Hidden Power Fighting, Substitute is the recommended choice for the third slot, as it gives Porygon2 protection against status and allows it to scout the opponent's switch-in. Recover is placed in the last slot to allow Porygon2 to offset any entry hazard and Life Orb damage.</p> <p>The EV spread allows Porygon2 to outrun minimum Speed base 80s, Adamant Torterra, Modest Exeggutor, Jolly Aggron, and many variants of Milotic. The Special Attack EVs allow Porygon2 to 2HKO most Uxie, OHKO Blastoise and special sweeper Moltres, and put a considerable dent in 248/0+ Milotic by dealing 79.4% - 93.6% with Thunderbolt after a Download boost.</p> <p>Discharge can be used over Thunderbolt for the added paralysis chance; however, the difference in power is very noticeable. Agility can be used over Tri Attack to allow Porygon2 to become a decent late-game cleaner; however, without a reliable STAB option, Porygon2 will find the chance to sweep difficult to come by. Finally, Hidden Power Grass can be used over Tri Attack to hit Lanturn, Quagsire, and Rhyperior harder, but outside of those examples, it has little use.</p> <p>Ghost-types, such as Mismagius and Rotom, make great partners, as they can switch into Fighting-types with little trouble. Uxie makes a great partner as well to switch into Fighting-types, and it can also provide Stealth Rock support. Porygon2 can eliminate threats such as Slowbro, Dugtrio, and Altaria to help ensure a Blaziken sweep. Porygon2 is stopped cold by the likes of Lanturn and Chansey, so pairing it with a strong physical attacker such as Hitmonlee will easily let Porygon2 bypass these defensive threats.</p>"
      },
      "Charge Beam": {
        "description": "<p>With Charge Beam, excellent coverage alongside it in Ice Beam, and Recover, Porygon2 becomes a great boosting tank. The idea is to come in on a Pokemon that poses little threat to Porygon2, such as Milotic, and start blasting away with Charge Beam. The more boosts Porygon2 gets, the more offensively threatening it becomes. Ice Beam is used for coverage and creates the BoltBeam combination alongside Charge Beam. Tri Attack rounds off Porygon2's coverage and is a nice STAB move with which to nail Pokemon neutral to BoltBeam coverage, such as Uxie, Lanturn, and Clefable. If coverage is not a problem, Substitute can be used in its place to turn Porygon2 into an effective SubCharge user. When using Substitute, it's best to use it first to scout your opponent's switch-in and also to protect Porygon2 from status, particularly Toxic. Recover provides Porygon2 with consistent recovery and allows it to set up on Chansey that lack Toxic, beating it one-on-one with +6 Tri Attack.</p> <p>The EV spread gives Porygon2 enough Speed to outpace Adamant Rhyperior and enough Special Attack to beat Chansey at +6, with the rest put into HP to balance Porygon2's defenses. A fully defensive spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature can be used to turn Porygon2 into a more defensive tank; however, Porygon2 then loses to Rhyperior and Chansey and requires four boosts instead of three to 2HKO Milotic with Tri Attack.</p> <p>This Porygon2 isn't a great team player; it acts as a standalone sweeper, so it enjoys a lot of team support for itself. Ghost-types are almost a necessity as teammates, since they can absorb any Fighting-type attacks aimed at Porygon2. Porygon2 requires a Pokemon to absorb Toxic Spikes off the field and to take any Toxics aimed at it, so pairing Porygon2 with a Poison-type, such as Venusaur and Nidoking, is highly recommended. If Porygon2 were to be poisoned by Toxic, it essentially becomes unable to sweep, so packing a cleric on your team, such as Vileplume or Clefable, is highly beneficial as well. Clefable also has the added benefit of providing Wish support and can absorb Toxic aimed at Porygon2 as well. Claydol makes a great partner because it can switch into Fighting-types with ease and provide Rapid Spin support to blow Toxic Spikes, Spikes, and Stealth Rock off the field. Not only that, but Claydol can also set up Stealth Rock of its own. In return, Porygon2 easily switches into Milotic and Ghost-types that threaten Claydol.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>This set capitalizes on the fact that most Pokemon in UU are more specially frail and equips Porygon2 with a Choice Scarf to turn it into a revenge killer that can easily sweep late-game if given the opportunity. Ice Beam and Thunderbolt form the BoltBeam combination, and, alongside Tri Attack, grant Porygon2 perfect neutral coverage in UU with the exceptions of Magneton and Shedinja. The last slot comes down to personal preference. Trick is the recommended choice, as it allows Porygon2 to potentially cripple its counters, such as Registeel, Chansey, and Clefable, since none of them can make use of Choice Scarf. Psychic can be selected over Trick for additional type coverage, as it hits the ever-present Fighting- and Poison-types of UU for super effective damage and allows Porygon2 to effectively revenge kill Blaziken and Toxicroak.</p> <p>The EV spread given allows Porygon2 to outrun positive-natured base 105s, with the remaining EVs placed into Special Attack for power and HP for bulk. Modest can be used over Timid for additional power; however, Porygon2 then loses out on outpacing base 105s such as Mismagius and Scyther.</p> <p>Download is the recommended ability to effectively garner Porygon2 a Special Attack boost as it switches into a Pokemon with a higher Defense than Special Defense stat, allowing it to more easily revenge kill a majority of the UU tier. If the opposing Pokemon has equal defenses, like in the cases of Absol and Scyther, Porygon2 will get the Special Attack boost. Trace can be used, however, as it allows Porygon2 to counter weather teams centered around Chlorophyll and Swift Swim. As Porygon2 switches in, it'll Trace the opposing Pokemon's Chlorophyll or Swift Swim; Porygon2 is then free to outpace the sweeper and KO it with the appropriate move. This strategy is highly situational, however, and therefore Download is the more practical option to counter most teams.</p> <p>Fighting-type Pokemon that can remove Chansey, Clefable, and Registeel, such as Hitmonlee and Hariyama, are excellent teammates for Porygon2. Pursuit users, such as Drapion and Skuntank, make great teammates that can remove Ghost-types, which will aid Porygon2 in a Tri Attack sweep. Spiritomb is another great teammate, as it can Pursuit trap the aforementioned Ghost-types and cripple any Fighting-types with Will-O-Wisp. Many common sweepers, including Mismagius and Houndoom, love to have Milotic out of the picture, and so they appreciate Porygon2 as a partner.</p>"

  "Stantler": {
    "overview": "<p>Though seemingly outclassed by both Kangaskhan and Tauros, who are bulkier and have greater attacking prowess, Stantler does have a much wider movepool that keeps his opponents guessing. Complemented with his good Attack, this turns Stantler into a potent offensive force; this also makes Stantler a good user of the ParaFusion technique, while Intimidate helps soften physical blows. His diverse movepool doesn't stop there; Stantler has a variety of good support options such as Gravity, Thunder Wave, and Trick Room, along with the defenses to use them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stantler has a pretty good movepool with a large amount of moves not mentioned. Other physical options include Bounce, Double-Edge, and Zen Headbutt; Bounce can damage a Fighting-type switching in, Double-Edge deals more damage than Return or Headbutt at the cost of recoil, and Zen Headbutt nails Poison-types such as Weezing and Fighting-types such as Toxicroak. On the special side, Stantler has access to Calm Mind, Charge Beam, Energy Ball, Hidden Power, Psychic, Shadow Ball, Signal Beam, and Thunderbolt; it's just too bad Stantler doesn't have any STAB Normal-type moves and is completely outclassed by almost every other Calm Mind user under the sun. Me First can be a nasty surprise for the opponent, especially if they use an attack that they themselves are weak to. Magic Coat and Roar are two more support moves that Stantler can use, though there is little room on any of his sets to fit them in. A set composed completely of status moves may be used; with access to Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Hypnosis, Stantler becomes a surprisingly good status platform who can cause a lot of switches. Stantler may also use Trick Room to some level of success, though he is usually too weak offensively and isn't slow enough to properly use it himself (Rhyperior without Speed investment will outspeed Stantler under Trick Room, even if Stantler has 0 Speed IVs).</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Most Fighting-types can take on Stantler, especially Guts Hariyama and Limber Hitmonlee as neither mind paralysis. Even after Intimidate, Fighting-types can easily take out Stantler with their STAB attacks. Hitmontop is a good example as it weakens Stantler further with Intimidate of his own. Ghost-types are also decent counters, Mismagius being one of the best as she is immune to Earthquake (provided Gravity isn't in effect) and Return, has the ability to set up on Sucker Punch, and create a Substitute to block status moves. Claydol is a pretty good counter as he can switch into Earthquake and his good Defense means he'll take little damage from any of Stantler's attacks (bar Megahorn). Most bulky Water-types can take on Stantler with their good defenses, reliable recovery, and powerful STAB; Milotic, Slowbro, and Cloyster are all decent examples. Rhyperior is immune to Thunder Wave, takes little damage from any of Stantler's attacks, has Solid Rock to weaken Earthquake, and can set up with Rock Polish to sweep your team. Almost any physically defensive Pokemon who doesn't mind paralysis can be called a counter, especially Ground-types.</p>",

      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Stantler's good Attack stat, turning him into a potent sweeper. His diverse movepool makes it difficult for most of his counters to switch in safely, while Intimidate gives him an easier time switching into physical attackers. Return is used for reliable STAB, Earthquake destroys Rock- and Steel-types, and Sucker Punch will overcome faster opponents such as Mismagius and Scyther. Megahorn deals immense damage to Grass-types such as Leafeon and Tangrowth, though Bite can be used to hit Ghost-types reliably. The item choice is down to personal preference. A Choice Band can be used over Life Orb in exchange for more power, though it locks Stantler into a single attack. Sucker Punch isn't advised when Stantler is holding a Choice Band as an opponent can use this opportunity to set up.</p> <p>Stantler should watch out for opposing Fighting-types, since they make light work of him. Weezing can switch into almost any Fighting-type and cripple them with Will-O-Wisp; unfortunately, Weezing is also a good counter to Stantler due to its high Defense and immunity to Earthquake. Venusaur is another partner who can handle Fighting-types, being able to cripple the opponent with Sleep Powder and then use its powerful STAB to weaken them. Mismagius is another good switch-in to Fighting-types, and she also has a helpful immunity to Ground-type moves and access to Will-O-Wisp; again, Mismagius is also a good counter to Stantler as she can switch into Return and Earthquake, while using Will-O-Wisp to cut his Attack.</p>"

      "Parafusion": {
        "description": "<p>Stantler is an effective user of the parafusion strategy; thanks to Intimidate and his good Attack stat, Stantler can cause some real problems for the opponent. Headbutt can make things even worse for the opponent, having a small chance at causing them to flinch; although this doesn't seem like much, when combined with paralysis and confusion, this can severely reduce the opponent's chance of attacking. Alternatively, Stantler may use Return for more power. Earthquake deals with Rock- and Steel-types, while Bite can be used to hit opposing Ghost-types. Body Slam is another option for this set, giving Stantler another way to paralyze the opponent. However, this should only be used alongside Bite, as Ghost-types completely wall him.</p> <p>As this Stantler can severely cripple the opponent's team, your teammates can gain more opportunities to set up and sweep. Alakazam and Mismagius can take advantage of the holes created by Stantler by setting up Calm Mind or Nasty Plot, respectively. Mismagius and Rotom can be troublesome for this set if they switch into a predicted Return or Earthquake, making a Dark-type such as Drapion or Absol a good partner. Both of them have access to Pursuit, while Drapion can set up Toxic Spikes and Absol can set up Swords Dance. Donphan is immune to Thunder Wave and his huge Defense means he'll take little damage from Earthquake or Headbutt. Furthermore, his STAB Earthquake cleanly KOes Stantler. To get past Donphan, a bulky Water-type such as Milotic is helpful as she can hit Donphan hard with a STAB Surf. Poliwrath is another good option due to his good Attack and Defense stats, access to Bulk Up, and ability to switch into most of Donphan's attacks.</p>"

Torterra is a good teammate as he can switch into Donphan with ease and threaten him with Wood Hammer, while Gravity makes his STAB Earthquake unavoidable.</p> <p>Mismagius can be a problem under Gravity, as she can switch into Return and her Will-O-Wisp becomes 100% accurate. A Flash Fire Houndoom is a good teammate option as it can switch into Will-O-Wisp and gain a boost, and Water Veil Wailord can switch into it as well. Chansey can take on Mismagius if she doesn't carry Taunt, and Dark-types like Drapion can threaten Mismagius with Night Slash and Pursuit.</p>"

Bolstering your team with teammates that can support it can be very much worthwhile, as a properly used Miltank can easily sweep entire teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Miltank doesn't really have any other sets worth using. A Choice Band set can hit somewhat hard and has some unique options with the elemental punches and Zen Headbutt, but Kangaskhan outclasses it with Sucker Punch and a higher base Attack. Miltank's only other viable option is Counter, which it can use as is or alongside Curse. Chople Berry and Counter can help Miltank lure in Fighting-types and OHKO them back.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fighting-type attacks are generally the strongest type of attack in UU, and they happen to be Miltank's only weakness. Hitmontop, Primeape, Hitmonlee, Poliwrath, Toxicroak, and Hariyama all present huge problems for Miltank. Steel-types and bulky Rock-types are all big threats for Miltank as well, resisting its STAB attacks and usually dealing significant damage back to Miltank.</p> <p>Encore and Taunt can stop any set-up or healing that Miltank might try and will generally force Miltank out. Haze Milotic can easily remove any Curses that Miltank might have gotten, and with Haze's massive PP, Miltank cannot hope to stall it out. Venusaur can be a serious obstacle for Miltank, using Sleep Powder on it and then proceeding to heavily damage it with Leaf Storm or set up Swords Dance or Leech Seed.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This is the most well-known Miltank set and one of the best pure sweepers of all UU. Although it seems as though Miltank would be slow to set up, access to both HP and status recovery moves, an attack with no immunities and only two resists, and above-average defenses give it all the time in the world to set up a few Curses and start cleaning up teams.</p> <p>Milk Drink and Heal Bell give Miltank a reliable recovery engine that allows it to stand up to most Toxic stallers and physical attackers. With a few Curses under its belt (or udder), Miltank can begin to take even STAB Fighting-type attacks with ease and recover with Milk Drink. Body Slam becomes a much more powerful attack when Curse-boosted and has enough PP and an excellent secondary effect to allow Miltank to sweep with it. If Body Slam seems too weak on Miltank, Return is a very good substitution, reaching 48 more Base Power after STAB is factored in. Return gives no chance of paralysis, but the extra Base Power make it a fair price to pay.</p> <p>Miltank's Defense is boosted through Curse, so it is important to focus on boosting your Special Defense with the EVs. This allows it to set up on Pokemon such as Rotom or Milotic. It also allows it to serve as a counter to many specially-based threats, since the rest of your team should be dedicated to fending off many of Miltank's physical counters.</p> <p>Hammer Arm can be used over Heal Bell, allowing Miltank to KO Registeel and Steelix much more easily than with Body Slam after Curse. Rest is another option to consider, providing both status removal and full health recovery in one move. In order to not waste turns, Sleep Talk can be used in the other free slot, or alternatively, you can use both Milk Drink and Rest.</p> <p>This Miltank is meant to clean up the opponent's team, so it should be used in conjunction with Pokemon that benefit it, not the other way around (although it can be a mutually beneficial relationship). Spiritomb can be a very valuable partner, switching in on Fighting-types and using Pursuit on them for small amounts of damage. Although this minor damage won't seem important at first, it will eventually add up and let Miltank set up more easily. Toxic Spikes support can wear down any potential counters as Miltank sets up, and also allow it to set up on Pokemon such as Milotic while poison slowly whittles down their health. It also allows Miltank to continuously Curse up and Milk Drink against Fighting-types while Toxic Spikes damage eventually kills them off.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Miltank is a very bulky Pokemon that has access to Stealth Rock. That alone should make it a Pokemon to consider adding to your team. What separates Miltank from Chansey, however, is its base 100 Speed, as well as a more-than-decent Attack stat. This allows it to not only support your team, but to also deal consistent damage to opponents.</p> <p>The main reason to use this set is the reliability of Miltank's Stealth Rock. With base 100 Speed, only one weakness, and good defensive stats, Miltank has almost no issue with setting it up. Its second trick is Heal Bell, which gives any statused sweeper on your team a chance to sweep again. Milk Drink gives Miltank durability, and Body Slam allows it to spread paralysis through the opponent's team. Miltank's useful Thick Fat ability also allows it to counter common UU Pokemon such as Moltres and Arcanine.</p> <p>184 Speed EVs allow Miltank to outspeed max Speed Moltres and Rotom, two huge threats that it may encounter. Since most opponents would expect Curse Miltank, you can very easily surprise and sometimes kill these weakened Pokemon. The rest of the EVs can be put into HP and Defense, allowing it to take attacks such as Scyther's U-turn much more handily. These EVs can also be transferred to Special Defense to create a makeshift Rotom or even Mismagius counter, although Rock Slide is required over Stealth Rock in order to hit them. Rotom cannot even rely on burning Miltank as it can just Heal Bell to cure the status.</p> <p>As with any Pokemon using Stealth Rock, partnering Miltank with a sweeper that abuses entry hazards is recommended. Slower Pokemon that also benefit from paralysis would be ideal, as they are generally less frail than faster Pokemon. Pokemon that rely on Rest and Sleep Talk also benefit as partners, as they can sponge hits and have Miltank rid them of their sleep next time it comes out.</p> <p>Miltank is a very effective wall, capable of taking hits from both physical and special attackers, but unfortunately, it doesn't have the special bulk of Chansey or the physical bulk of Regirock. Repeated hits from Pokemon such as Scyther or Venusaur will take it down and will force Miltank to keep relying on Milk Drink. Other walls, such as Milotic or Registeel, can make things very difficult for Miltank, as it has no way to boost its own Attack with this set. It is best to use this Miltank only as a pivot, switching in to Heal Bell or Stealth Rock and then trying to spread status a few times with Body Slam.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Although Miltank prefers to play more defensively with its sets, it still has offensive assets in its base 100 Speed, its respectable Attack, and a STAB attack with a Base Power of 120. It becomes a very powerful sweeper with a Life Orb, outspeeding and OHKOing many common threats.</p> <p>Double-Edge is Miltank's strongest physical attack (with the exception of Giga Impact), and it can easily 2HKO even the most bulkiest of threats. Earthquake provides coverage versus Steelix and Registeel, while Heal Bell can relieve Miltank of any status ailments it receives. Its base 100 Speed lets it outpace almost every Fire-type in UU, almost all of which can be OHKOed by Earthquake. With constant recoil from Life Orb as well as Double-Edge, Milk Drink is needed to keep Miltank healthy and able to sweep longer.</p> <p>Return can be used over Double-Edge if recoil is too worrisome. However, the lack of power will make Pokemon such as Milotic and Venusaur much more daunting to face. Toxic can be used instead of Earthquake as a scouting device, allowing Miltank to scout for any common counters; however, Earthquake is the preferred option to do substantial damage to Pokemon such as Arcanine and Drapion.</p> <p>Entry hazards are very important for Miltank, letting it 2HKO some variants of Milotic as well as OHKO many more possible threats. Moltres is an excellent partner to Miltank, as it can easily wear down potential counters such as Milotic and Chansey and switch in on Fighting-type attacks directed at Miltank. Mismagius makes another good partner, as Miltank can often lure in and OHKO opposing Mismagius, as well as lure in counters to other sets such as Registeel. Although Miltank may not be able to KO Registeel, it will often force Registeel into either using Explosion or taking a loss of 70% HP.</p> <p>The best counter to this Miltank is just keeping a faster pace. Miltank will slowly wear itself out with recoil from Life Orb or Double-Edge, allowing other Pokemon to simply pick it off later. Hitmontop can Intimidate Miltank, cutting its Attack, and use Mach Punch to deal plenty of damage. Rhyperior is not 2HKOed by Earthquake and can use the opportunity to set up a Rock Polish, or abuse Choice Banded attacks. Scarf Fighting-types will force Miltank out and slowly wear down teammates with Close Combat.</p>"

  "Mightyena": {
    "overview": "<p>Mightyena scavenges the DPP battlefield as arguably the worst fully evolved Dark-type in the game. Aside from its Attack—which is just barely decent—Mightyena's stats are awful, and its movepool—which somehow lacks Pursuit, an even more perplexing issue considering that Mightyena is based on a hyena—is horrid. Its only saving grace is its access to two great abilities, Quick Feet and Intimidate, that allow it to at least function in the UU metagame. When it comes down to it, though, if you're looking for a Dark-type for your team, you're probably better off choosing one that does what Mightyena can and then some, such as Absol, Drapion, or Skuntank.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Band set is conceivable; however, Mightyena's lack of a secondary STAB and utterly horrible physical movepool puts that idea to rest. Fire Fang is Mightyena's most powerful attack against Tangrowth and Registeel, but even then Mightyena is unable to 3HKO them without Stealth Rock and Spikes support. Rock Smash is Mightyena's alternative answer to Steel- and Rock-types, especially Aggron, but has no use outside of that. Finally, Toxic can be used alongside Protect and Wish support to effectively stall out the enemy; unfortunately, Mightyena is almost directly outclassed by Arcanine in this regard thanks to the latter's access to reliable recovery in Morning Sun.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>There is no shortage of counters to this poor mutt, as its mediocre Attack stat and low defenses make the hyenas from the Lion King seem more intimidating. Spiritomb is an excellent counter thanks to its immunity to Super Fang and Facade and ability to rip Mightyena to shreds with Hidden Power Fighting. Registeel, Aggron, and Steelix take almost no damage from any of Mightyena's attacks outside of Super Fang and can easily retaliate with Earthquake, and in Aggron's case, Head Smash. Weezing easily outstalls any Mightyena thanks to Pain Split and its immunity to Toxic. Rhyperior takes little damage from anything Mightyena can dish out and can proceed to use it as setup fodder. Bulky Fighting-types, such as Hariyama and Hitmontop, will easily pound Mightyena into dust with their STAB moves. Tangrowth, Leafeon, Milotic, Blastoise, and Miltank can soak up any attack Mightyena throws at them and eliminate it. Ultimately, when dealing with Mightyena, use a bulky Pokemon, avoid Super Fang, and you've countered it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Stallbreaker": {
        "description": "<p>Mightyena has just enough Speed, a satisfactory movepool, and the Intimidate-enhanced bulk to function as a usable stallbreaker. Super Fang and Taunt form the crux of the set, and when combined completely shut down many of the common walls found on stall teams, such as Chansey and Registeel. The idea when using this Mightyena is to switch in on a wall as it uses a harmless move, such as Soft-Boiled, and Taunt them. Mightyena is then free to use Super Fang to immediately strip the wall of half of their health, and because of Taunt, they are unable to recover HP. Crunch is recommended for a reliable STAB move, although Rest can be used in its place to ensure stall teams can't wear down Mightyena with status or repeated attacks. Sucker Punch is used in the last slot to pick off faster threats and Choice Scarf users like Rotom, a common sight on stall teams. Finally, Toxic can be used in place of Sucker Punch to bring down Milotic and Spiritomb when combined with Rest and Taunt.</p> <p>Intimidate is used as it allows Mightyena to soften the hard-hitters of UU, and allow another teammate, such as Rhyperior, to switch in and set up with greater ease. This usually comes into play when facing more offensive teams, against which Mightyena is more of a liability. However, Mightyena is still able to pick off faster threats with Sucker Punch, notably Mismagius and Alakazam, so don't throw Mightyena under the bus too soon. The EV spread is designed to allow Mightyena to outpace Adamant Torterra before a Rock Polish, OHKO Rotom, Mismagius, and Alakazam with Sucker Punch, and give Mightyena the most bulk it can get out of the remaining EVs.</p> <p>Without Quick Feet, Mightyena is not immune to status, so including a partner who can absorb or heal them is highly recommended. Clefable makes the perfect teammate in this regard, as it is able to absorb all forms of status and cure Mightyena of any status trouble with Heal Bell. Be aware, though, that they both share a weakness to Fighting-type attacks, so include a Ghost-type on your team to remedy this problem. An amazing partner to stallbreaker Mightyena is SubSplit Rotom, as they are able to cover each other's weaknesses almost perfectly and can beat each other's counters reasonably well. Finally, bulky Psychic-types, such as Uxie and Claydol, make good teammates due to their ability to set up Stealth Rock and absorb any Fighting-type attacks sent at Mightyena.</p>"
      },
      "Quick Feet": {
        "description": "<p>After Toxic Orb activates Quick Feet, Mightyena reaches a blistering Speed stat of 393, enough to outspeed the entire unboosted UU metagame bar Electrode while keeping the ability to switch between moves. This would make Mightyena the quintessential revenge killer if it weren't for Mightyena's lack of offensive power. With a status condition inflicted, Facade becomes Mightyena's strongest attack, which is highly disappointing as it doesn't even get STAB. Fortunately, Mightyena is still powerful enough to KO many frail UU threats with Stealth Rock support being necessary for several of these KOs. The main idea when using Mightyena mid-game is to bring it in on a Pokemon it can revenge kill with Sucker Punch, such as Rotom, Mismagius, and Alakazam, and eliminate them. After this, Mightyena's Toxic Orb will activate, firing its Speed stat up to the heavens and beyond.</p> <p>Crunch is used primarily so that Mightyena doesn't have to rely on the oftentimes unreliable Sucker Punch for STAB, although Mightyena's movepool is so poor there isn't really any other option anyway. The last slot comes down to personal preference. As Mightyena's Attack stat is quite lackluster, Howl can be used to raise it, which will allow Mightyena to 2HKO bulkier threats, such as Venusaur and Uxie. Taunt can be used in its place to shut down walls that will inevitably switch into Mightyena, like Registeel, and it can also prevent specific threats from setting up on Mightyena as it switches out, such as Rhyperior and Aggron.</p> <p>Some other options that can be used in the last slot include Protect, Super Fang, and Yawn. Protect allows Mightyena to activate its Toxic Orb scot-free while scouting your opponent's switch-in; however, Howl and Taunt are hard to replace, and so are Mightyena's attacking moves. Super Fang strips bulky walls, such as Weezing and Rhyperior, of half their health, allowing Mightyena's teammates to eliminate them more easily. Yawn can cause switches to help Mightyena activate its Toxic Orb and may even put something to sleep heaven forbid.</p> <p>Toxic Orb is the chosen item for this set as it activates Quick Feet with no drawbacks other than inflicting poison on Mightyena. Flame Orb cannot be used as, unlike the ability Guts, Quick Feet will not cancel out the Attack drop caused by the burn condition. Finally, Mightyena can switch into Thunder Wave safely, as Quick Feet will still activate and Mightyena will receive the Speed boost as normal. Unfortunately, there is a chance that full paralysis will occur, so don't play too loosely with Mightyena in that regard.</p> <p>In order for Mightyena to be successful, it needs some heavy duty team support. U-turn users are amazing partners, particularly slow users such as Uxie, as they can get Mightyena in safely and activate its Toxic Orb without the need for Protect or utilizing the Sucker Punch strategy described above. Mightyena is easily walled by Registeel, Milotic, Rhyperior, and Weezing, so including a powerful special sweeper on your team will allow Mightyena to bypass these threats. Life Orb Milotic and Physical Sweeper Venusaur make great teammates as they can handle the aforementioned Pokemon quite nicely, and they appreciate Mightyena's ability to pick off faster sweepers, such as Swellow, Sceptile, and Rotom.</p>"

  "Linoone": {
    "overview": "<p>Linoone is truly a blessed Pokemon. What would otherwise be a run-of-the-mill, throwaway Normal-type rodent along the likes of Raticate and Furret has access to a one-turn, game-ending sweep setup. Belly Drum turns the mild-mannered mustelid into a pillar of hellfire, a screaming Harrier jet, a towering tornado of fury wielding 1048 Attack, 405 Speed, and an 80 Base Power, STAB priority attack. Packing Linoone gives you a deadly secret weapon for when your enemy shows a moment of weakness, and once its presence is known, Linoone becomes a powerful psychological threat that will have your opponent on his toes the entire match. Adding in team support makes Linoone a fairly reliable late-game sweeper. If you have an opportunistic, high-risk high-reward playstyle, Linoone may be for you.</p> <p>Beware, however, that Linoone is extremely frail and unforgiving; improper scouting, or a single mistake in prediction, will quickly turn Linoone into a dead weight.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Linoone has a fairly decent special movepool which includes even Ice Beam and Thunderbolt, but Linoone is unable to take advantage of it with its middling Special Attack stat. If you want a high-powered move, Linoone can learn Gunk Shot, but with the poor coverage it gets with it, coupled with the low accuracy, it is generally not a viable option. A gimmick set with Belly Drum and Last Resort can be fun, dealing a ridiculous amount of damage to most enemies. Physically Defensive Weezing takes 117.7% - 138.6% from a boosted Adamant Last Resort, and Cloyster with maximum Defense investment takes 95.7% - 112.8%, a clean OHKO with Stealth Rock. Pursuit is another option; however, with Linoone's poor base Attack, it won't be netting many kills apart from the rare Ghost-type that is locked into a Ghost-type move and needs to switch out. As tanks that wall Linoone such as Steelix and Registeel are bound to switch into its attacks, Super Fang can rob them of half of their current health, which is by far the best amount of damage Linoone will be able to inflict on them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The best way to counter Linoone is to prevent it from setting up a Belly Drum. If there are no screens in play, almost any STAB attack along with Stealth Rock will deal more than 50% damage to Linoone. If screens are in play, it takes a fairly powerful STAB or Fighting-type attack from a sweeper or tank to deal the appropriate damage, although this is still not hard to do. Taking out a screen-shielded Linoone after eating a Memento takes powerful Fighting-type STAB from the likes of Hitmonlee, Hitmontop, Primeape, or Medicham. Many support moves are also viable ways to halt Linoone's setup, and are unaffected by screens or Memento: Encore, Trick, burn, sleep, Haze, and phazing moves can all put Linoone on the sidelines for the rest of the match by making it waste its Belly Drum.</p> <p>Once Linoone has used Belly Drum, it still has several solid counters. Steelix is undoubtedly the best counter: with an Impish nature and 0 Def EVs, it is 3HKOed at best by Seed Bomb, and can KO Linoone with Earthquake or Gyro Ball, or phaze it away with Roar. Spiritomb is also an excellent counter, being immune to Linoone's STAB, 2HKOed by Seed Bomb and able to strike back first with its own priority STAB Sucker Punch, or burn Linoone with Will-O-Wisp. Registeel counters Linoone well, as long as it has Defense EVs or doesn't switch into Return; however, 0 Atk Registeel needs Explosion to put 50% HP Linoone down, as Iron Head will not KO. Shuckle almost always survives 2 Seed Bombs, even with Stealth Rock in play, but cannot do much back besides Toxic. Choice Scarf Mismagius and Timid Choice Scarf Rotom can both switch in on any Normal-type attack, outspeed the incoming Seed Bomb or Shadow Claw, and KO Linoone with Hidden Power Fighting or STAB Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Without Shadow Claw, Linoone cannot OHKO the aforementioned Ghost-types (Dusclops, Bold Rotom, Mismagius, Drifblim, and Shedinja), which in turn can usually manage to KO, or at least burn, Linoone. Without Return, physically bulky Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Torterra, Torkoal, Gligar, and Weezing can survive a hit from Linoone if they are running max HP and Def. The same goes for physically bulky Pokemon weak to Grass-type attacks, such as Slowbro, Sandslash, Cloyster, and all Rock-types, provided Linoone lacks Seed Bomb. Linoone needs Stealth Rock in play to get many key OHKOs; without it, almost any bulky Pokemon with max Defense will be able to survive a single +6 hit at full health, as will any Pokemon with Focus Sash.</p> <p>Some battle conditions can prevent or hamper a Linoone's sweep. Toxic Spikes (either one or two layers) are the most harmful, limiting the number of turns for which Linoone can sweep after a Belly Drum to 3, or 2 if Linoone switches in mid-turn. Stealth Rock and Spikes hamper Linoone's ability to take hits on the turn it uses Belly Drum. Sandstorm and hail don't cut sweeps short quite like poison does, but can finish off a damaged Linoone. Reflect on the defender's side reduces Linoone's attacking power by 50%, enough to halt its sweep.</p> <p>If you carry a Pokemon with Intimidate, you can sap Linoone's Attack until it is unable to KO your Pokemon. At +5 Attack (after one Intimidate), Linoone fails to OHKO many walls, such as the aforementioned max Defense Uxie, Weezing, and Slowbro, sometimes even with Stealth Rock in play. Offensive teams lacking a wall may have to sacrifice a Pokemon or two in order to harass Linoone with multiple Intimidates. Other abilities such as Static, Flame Body, Rough Skin, and Aftermath can, with a little luck, disable or finish off Linoone in a pinch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<p>Linoone possesses a holy trinity of sweeping power: Belly Drum, STAB Extreme Speed, and Gluttony. These three elements combine to form the ultimate one-turn setup. After a Belly Drum, Linoone's shabby Attack stat of 262 skyrockets to an amazing 1048, ready for immediate sweepage. At the same time, Gluttony activates its Salac Berry, sending its Speed stat from 270 (136 EVs) to 405, outspeeding everything up to neutral-natured Pokemon with a Choice Scarf and base 85 Speed. Linoone can then proceed to sweep with Extreme Speed, a STAB 80 Base Power priority move that essentially ensures that the flipped-out polecat will almost never be struck before it can hit, and likely KO its opponent. Seed Bomb is the second attack in Linoone's sweeping arsenal, KOing many of the Rock-types that resist Extreme Speed, as well as doing a hefty number on bulky Water- and Ground-types. Assuming maximum defensive investment, Slowbro, Milotic, Claydol, Omastar, Quagsire, Cloyster, Rhyperior, Sandslash, Relicanth, and Gastrodon will all survive a +6 Extreme Speed, but will all fall to +6 Seed Bomb after Stealth Rock. Despite its large movepool, Linoone has very few usable offensive options. After Extreme Speed and Seed Bomb, those options boil down to the two in the last moveslot. Shadow Claw is for Ghost-types, and will OHKO any Ghost-type in UU, bar Spiritomb and Sableye, without fail (Stealth Rock is needed for an OHKO on Dusclops). Return, however, may prove more useful in the long run.</p> <p>Return may seem like redundant coverage with Extreme Speed, allowing you to be walled by many more opponents, but consider the following; there are five Ghost-types in UU that +6 Shadow Claw can OHKO but +6 Seed Bomb cannot. These are Drifblim, Dusclops, Mismagius, max Defense Rotom, and Shedinja. Drifblim and Dusclops, while not unseen, are rare. Drifblim is often used as a lead in UU and will probably have Substituted down to 25% of its health (easily KO range) by the time Linoone is on the scene. Bold Rotom is also a rare sight - offensive variations are much more common and are all KOed by Seed Bomb. Shedinja is the rarest of all, and though lacking Shadow Claw will leave you completely walled by Shedinja, even with Shadow Claw most will either kill you after Focus Sash activates, or with a Sucker Punch. This is, of course, assuming there is no Stealth Rock on the field, which renders Shedinja useless anyway. Return, meanwhile, rivaling in power practically any Explosion found in UU, will ensure a few KOs that Extreme Speed cannot. Max Defense Weezing, Nidoqueen, Torterra, Uxie, and Drapion are all OHKOed by +6 Return after Stealth Rock damage, while Extreme Speed (or Shadow Claw vs. Uxie) will fail to KO in each case by a small margin. Return also has a 65% chance of 2HKOing a 252 HP / 4 Def neutral-natured Registeel holding Leftovers and taking Stealth Rock damage. Finally, after possibly taking an Intimidate or two, the added power of Return will be welcome.</p> <p>Steel-type Pokemon are the one thing Linoone absolutely cannot sweep through, as they resist Linoone's STAB attacks as well as Seed Bomb. Two attack options - Dig and Rock Smash - were available in the past as Linoone's only super effective attacks against the Steel-types, but neither is recommended over the listed attacks. Dig is nearly useless; not only is it easy to avoid and fails to OHKO Steelix, but Steelix and Registeel usually carry Earthquake, which will hit you underground. Rock Smash is generally a waste of a moveslot, considering a 2x super effective Rock Smash has only 80 Base Power, and a resisted STAB Return has 76.5 Base Power. Seed Bomb hits Steelix with 80 Base Power as well. The only Steel-types that Rock Smash is able to hit for decent damage are the three Rock / Steel-types (Bastiodon, Probopass, and Aggron), which, except for Aggron, are rarely seen.</p> <p>It therefore falls upon Linoone's teammates to remove its counters if Linoone hopes to sweep. Before firing off a Belly Drum, scouting for opposing Steelix, Registeel, and Spiritomb is wise. Shuckle, Cradily, and Armaldo are not as common nor as perfect of counters, but can all pose problems for Linoone as well. These sweep-stopping Pokemon should be eliminated, or else brought within KO range, before Linoone Belly Drums. Assuming Stealth Rock is in play, Linoone will always KO these counters if they are taken down to a certain hit point percentage first:</p> <ul> <li>+6 Seed Bomb vs. 252 HP / 0 Def Impish Steelix - 35.6% - 41.8%</li> <li>+6 Return vs. 252 HP / 252 Def Impish Registeel - 36% - 42.6%</li> <li>+6 Return vs. 252 HP / 0 Def Careful Registeel - 47% - 55.2%</li> <li>+6 Seed Bomb vs. 252 HP / 252 Def Bold Spiritomb - 57.2% - 67.4%</li> <li>+6 Seed Bomb vs. 252 HP / 240 Def Careful Cradily - 55.1% - 64.9%</li> <li>+6 Seed Bomb vs. 244 HP / 252 Def Impish Armaldo - 52% - 61.4%</li> <li>+6 Seed Bomb vs. 0 HP / 4 Def Jolly Aggron - 54.1% - 63.3%</li> </ul> <p>Keeping these Pokemon in mind, a team packing Linoone would do well to carry Pokemon who can handle Linoone's counters. Powerful wallbreakers such as mixed Blaziken, Swords Dance Pinsir, and Choice Specs Typhlosion can soften these counters enough for Linoone to sweep, if not KOing them outright. Also, as with any setup sweeper, lures and trappers make Linoone's life much easier. Mismagius, Scyther, and Swellow are all terrific lures that can coax your opponent's Linoone counter early. Dugtrio and Magneton are fairly efficient at eliminating the Steel-types that give Linoone nightmares, especially when paired with lures. Dual Screen users such as Uxie and Mesprit can help soften blows that Linoone might take whilst setting up, thus making its job easier.</p> <p>If you are worried about outspeeding certain Choice Scarf Pokemon (such as Venusaur and Rotom), a Jolly nature is optional. However, you will miss out on many crucial OHKOs if you do this, namely Slowbro, who is always OHKOed if Stealth Rock is in play, with a high chance of OHKOing without Stealth Rock. A Jolly nature will cause you to only OHKO with Stealth Rock set up. A different EV spread of 36 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def / 216 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used to guarantee the ability to outspeed certain other Pokemon; however, there is a noticeable lack in power. Finally, Memento Gastrodon is one of the easiest ways to guarantee a successful set up. Gastrodon has access to three extremely helpful support moves: Block, Memento, and Yawn.</p>"

First and foremost, it poses a psychological threat. Feigning a Belly Drum set, it intimidates many weakened sweepers into attacking instead of switching out, and many tottering walls will give up the chance to recover damage in order to get a hit off on Linoone. Second, it is the only user of STAB Extreme Speed in UU, which by all accounts is a powerful and reliable priority attack, even on a Pokemon with a pathetic 70 base Attack. Third, it has access to Switcheroo (as well as its identical twin Trick), which it can use to foil many of its counters. Steelix, Registeel, and Spiritomb, the three best Belly Drum Linoone switch-ins in UU, are all crippled by receiving a Choice Band, unless they are already holding one, which is a rare sight for the former two. With an Adamant nature, Linoone reaches a decent 393 attack. Extreme Speed is Linoone's primary attack, allowing it to put a huge dent on fragile sweepers which outspeed Linoone, such as Swellow and Alakazam. As mentioned before, Shadow Claw is Linoone's only way of dealing with Ghost-types, whilst without Seed Bomb, the badger has no chance taking on the likes of Rhyperior and Omastar. Although Switcheroo is the preferred move for the fourth moveslot, Return can net a lot of OHKOs and 2HKOs that Extreme Speed cannot, namely cleanly landing a fatality on Dugtrio and Swellow, as well as 2HKOing Life Orb Milotic.</p> <p>The layout of the EVs is quite simple, allowing Linoone to outspeed as many threats as possible while at the same time maximizing its Attack. A Jolly nature is optional if you are worried about needing to outspeed opponents that resist Extreme Speed, in which case Return is the STAB move that you should use. Rock Smash is an alternative to hit Pokemon such as Aggron super effectively, but has no use outside of that, seeing as a neutral Extreme Speed is more powerful than a super effective Rock Smash. Entry hazards are a must here, as Linoone is typically only able to do 50% to bulky Pokemon with Extreme Speed. Because sweepers typically carry Life Orb, the combination of residual damage plus the damage done from entry hazards adds up to allow Linoone to revenge kill with minimal losses.</p>"

  "Dustox": {
    "overview": "<p>Unfortunately for Dustox, it's hard to deny that he's simply a terrible Pokemon to use competitively. The combination of poor stats, a shallow movepool, mediocre typing, and a weakness to Stealth Rock means even his best efforts to succeed are usually futile. While he does have a reasonable Special Defense stat, instant recovery in Roost, and Whirlwind to prevent him from being completely useless, it's not nearly enough to make this unfortunate Bug-type a popular choice. If, for some reason, you find yourself tempted to use Dustox, be warned that he will rarely be able to accomplish anything, and there is almost always a better option.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dustox's movepool is unfortunately shallow, so he doesn't have too many other options at his disposal. In terms of special attacks, Dustox has Shadow Ball, Energy Ball, and Psychic, each of which hits a different target that Dustox has issues with (Ghost-, Water-, and Poison-types, respectively); Dustox also has Sludge Bomb as an alternative STAB attack. However, Dustox generally prefers Bug Buzz because the STAB boost is important on most foes, and Bug Buzz has better coverage than Sludge Bomb. Additionally, Dustox can utilize Choice Specs alongside the aforementioned attacks to make him decent offensively, though this is not advised since even with the boost, Dustox isn't very powerful. In terms of support, Light Screen and Iron Defense are usable options to buff Dustox's defenses. Dustox could also use Sunny Day in tandem with Moonlight, though compounding Dustox's weakness to Fire-type attacks probably isn't a good idea. Finally, U-turn is a decent scouting move that can be used, though on defensive sets, Whirlwind is better due to its ability to phaze and rack up entry hazard damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>It really isn't hard to counter a Pokemon as mediocre as Dustox. While he can be a nuisance with entry hazard support due to Whirlwind, this problem is easily alleviated by Rapid Spinners such as Hitmontop, Donphan, and Blastoise. Poison- and Steel-types, RestTalkers, and teams with cleric support are immune to Dustox's main form of damage in Toxic; thus, they shouldn't have any issues dealing with the Poison Moth Pokemon. Pokemon who can prey on Dustox's weaknesses will generally be decent options as well, since even though Dustox is reasonably bulky on the special side, he still can't take on strong super effective special hits, which aren't hard to find due to his mediocre defensive typing. This fact is especially compounded if Stealth Rock is on the field, as by stripping Dustox of 25% of his health each time he switches in, his longevity is severely limited. Finally, any Pokemon with Taunt will completely shut down Dustox, as his pathetic offensive prowess will cause him to do little damage against any common Taunt user, though they should be wary of switching in directly due to Toxic.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Toxic Stall": {
        "description": "<p>With Dustox's decent Special Defense stat and Roost, he can Toxic stall with some success. Toxic and Roost allow Dustox to stall out a surprising range of opponents. Whirlwind prevents opposing Pokemon with Substitute from setting up, forcing them out before they get a chance to abuse Substitute. It can also be useful alongside entry hazards to help deal with the Steel- and Poison-types who wall him. In the last slot, Bug Buzz prevents Dustox from being rendered completely useless by Taunt. However, because Dustox's Special Attack stat is so poor, you may wish to opt for Protect or even Substitute to help Dustox stall better. To top it all off, Dustox's ability, Shield Dust, prevents attacks such as Ice Beam from ruining his stall attempt with untimely secondary effects.</p> <p>Dustox's EVs should be focused in Special Defense, as that's his only decent stat. Although many of Dustox's resistances are usually physical, they're often complemented by an attack that targets Dustox's weaknesses. However, by shifting some EVs from Special Defense into Defense, Dustox can survive some attacks, such as a Swords Dance-boosted Return or Earthquake from Venusaur, which makes such an EV shift a reasonably good option. Alternatively, you can give Dustox a few Speed EVs to allow him to outspeed some additional Pokemon; this would enable Dustox to Roost off the damage before an opposing Pokemon can KO him.</p> <p>It is important to note that this set is brutally walled by Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon, as well as RestTalkers, Clefable, and teams with cleric support. In reality, the aforementioned threats can be difficult to deal with due to the fact that most of these types of Pokemon are fairly bulky. However, there are some Pokemon who you can use to mitigate the effectiveness of these Pokemon against Dustox. For example, Dugtrio is a great choice to trap and KO Steel- and Poison-types, while Rhyperior can threaten both of these types of Pokemon and pose a huge threat to the opposing team with his powerful STAB attacks. Rhyperior also happens to work decently against some clerics such as Clefable and Chansey, as they lack the ability to threaten Rhyperior; in return, he can simply use them as set-up bait. Many RestTalkers and clerics aren't too strong offensively, as they're EVs tend to be geared towards their defensive stats, so Pokemon that can take advantage of their poor offenses to set up are decent options.</p> <p>As this set's goal is to stall out opposing Pokemon with Toxic, entry hazards are immensely helpful in punishing the opponent for switching out. Omastar and Cloyster are superb partners for this job since they're both rather bulky, which allows them to switch in multiple times to set up hazards. Dustox is horribly crippled by status and often takes heavy damage when switching in, so support from Wish users and clerics is also useful. Chansey and Clefable are effective partners, as their weakness to Fighting-type attacks is easily covered by Dustox, and they can provide the aforementioned support that he enjoys.</p>"

  "Ludicolo": {
    "overview": "<p>Ludicolo is one of the most essential Rain Dance sweepers because of its Grass typing, which allows it to strike down the annoying Water-type Pokemon that cause havoc for Rain Dance teams. In the rain, it outruns the majority of UU Pokemon and has enough power to slay them with Energy Ball, Surf, and Ice Beam. Ludicolo also has impressive special bulk, enabling it to stay in and set up against a wide range of foes. Lastly, Ludicolo has access to Swords Dance and an adequate physical movepool, which allows it to foil foes that think it's running a special moveset.</p> <p>However, Ludicolo has a couple of problems. Its base 90 Special Attack is not especially impressive, even when using Surf in the rain. Ludicolo can also be picked off easily by a number a priority moves, such as Extreme Speed, Fake Out, Quick Attack, and Mach Punch. Even then, Ludicolo stands out as a useful Rain Dance user that helps keep the offensive momentum going.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There aren't many other moves to use other than the ones already mentioned. Synthesis has potential outside of Rain Dance for restoring Life Orb recoil or just healing HP in general. Fake Out could potentially be useful on a Ludicolo that switches out frequently for chip damage, but it won't deal much damage. Icy Wind has its use for lowering the foe's Speed, but Ludicolo will likely already its his Speed boosted via rain. Return on the Swords Dance sweeper could work for overall neutral coverage, but the lack of super effective moves will hinder Ludicolo against specific foes.</p> <p>A Substitute + Leech Seed combination looks fine at first sight, but it is actually mediocre. Ludicolo will become walled by Grass-types (excluding standard Leafeon or Tangrowth) because his Ice Beam will be weakened as a result of pumping EVs into HP and Special Defense and running a defensive nature. It also doesn't help that Ludicolo takes neutral damage from Grass-type moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Chansey can switch into a Life Orb rain-boosted Surf without taking too much damage from Ludicolo and Thunder Wave or Toxic it. Then, Chansey can stall out the rain with repeated Soft-Boileds or wear Ludicolo down with Seismic Toss. Clefable can do the same, but it must be wary of switching into Surf or Hydro Pump as it will 2HKO it. Both of these Pokemon must beware of the Swords Dance set, however. Toxicroak is a viable counter to any set without a Psychic-type attack due to its Dry Skin ability and resistance to Grass-type attacks.</p> <p>Against the Swords Dance set, physically defensive Tangrowth and Leafeon can survive an Ice Punch and threaten back with Sleep Powder or Leaf Blade. Any Hitmontop can threaten physical Ludicolo with either impressive physical bulk and Intimidate or Technician plus Fake Out and Mach Punch. Uxie can usually survive an assault and paralyze Ludicolo with Thunder Wave, but it will end up crippled.</p> <p>Switching to Pokemon on a predicted attack to outstall the rain is usually the best idea. For example, you can switch in Milotic on a Surf or Ice Beam and then switch to Registeel to take the incoming Energy Ball, and repeat. Doing this also lets Ludicolo take in more Life Orb recoil so you can finally pick it off with a priority move such as Arcanine's Extreme Speed, Hitmontop's Mach Punch, or Scyther's Quick Attack. Pokemon already under a Substitute or with Protect are also great at stalling out Ludicolo's rain.</p> <p>If all else fails, the best strategy is to let your least important Pokemon faint and then switch in the Pokemon that takes the least amount of damage from all of Ludicolo's attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to sweep through teams once Rain Dance is present. As Ludicolo is usually paired with other Rain Dance sweepers, its main role is to remove Water-type Pokemon that may annoy them.</p> <p>In the rain, Surf will be the main source of damage. If Ludicolo needs more power, then Hydro Pump is a great alternative. Energy Ball allows Ludicolo to strike down Water-type Pokemon that resist Ludicolo's Water attacks. Ice Beam hits Grass-type Pokemon and Altaria for super effective damage. Surf, Energy Ball, and Ice Beam grant Ludicolo great coverage, leaving the fourth slot open for a support move. Rain Dance lets Ludicolo set up rain to maintain offensive momentum. Hidden Power Psychic OHKOes Toxicroak, while Focus Punch can be used to hit Clefable and Chansey while they recover.</p> <p>To figure out if you need to use Surf or Hydro Pump on Ludicolo, here are some damage calculations:</p> <ul> <li>Surf vs. 236 HP / 156 SpD Careful Registeel: 40.7% - 48.1%</li> <li>Hydro Pump vs. 236 HP / 156 SpD Careful Registeel: 51.1% - 60.2%</li> <li>Surf vs. 80 HP / 0 SpD Impish Hariyama: 86.9% - 100%</li> <li>Hydro Pump vs. 80 HP / 0 SpD Impish Hariyama: 100%</li> <li>Surf vs. 52 HP / 0 SpD Jolly Mesprit: 78.7% - 93%</li> <li>Hydro Pump vs. 52 HP / 0 SpD Jolly Mesprit: 99.4% - 100%</li> <li>Surf vs. 252 HP / 0 SpD Bold Uxie: 39% - 46%</li> <li>Hydro Pump vs. 252 HP / 0 SpD Bold Uxie: 49.2% - 57.9%</li> </ul> <p>As seen in the calculations, there are several cases where Hydro Pump's increased Base Power changes 2HKOs into OHKOs. If you're not worried about such Pokemon or have Stealth Rock on your team, then you should use Surf.</p> <p>When using Focus Punch, you should change the nature to Mild and move the HP EVs to Attack. Grass Knot is also an option over Energy Ball for increased damage on Milotic, but Energy Ball is sufficient enough to 2HKO Milotic EVed in Defense. Energy Ball also deals more damage to Lanturn and Azumarill, with a high chance of OHKOing the latter with Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>The EV spread provides Ludicolo with maximum power and enough Speed to outrun most of the UU metagame. 224 Speed EVs put Ludicolo at 464 Speed in the rain, allowing it to outrun Timid Choice Scarf Rotom by two points. The remaining Speed EVs are placed into HP for additional bulk. You can also move the HP EVs into Speed if you want to at worst Speed tie with other Ludicolo.</p> <p>It should also be noted that Ludicolo can perform on a standard team despite the lack of Rain Dance sweepers present on its side. This may seem odd, but using Rain Dance is essentially using Agility, but with the added bonus of increasing the power of Surf.</p> <p>Pokemon that can survive an attack from Ludicolo and paralyze it, such as Registeel, Clefable, and Lanturn, are a general annoyance. Although Registeel and Lanturn may die the next turn after they use Thunder Wave, Ludicolo will be helpless when the next Pokemon appears. Also, Clefable can stall the rain turns out by using Soft-Boiled repeatedly, waiting for Ludicolo to be fully paralyzed. Rain Dance Lanturn can help against Registeel, absorbing the Thunder Wave and striking back with boosted Surfs or Hydro Pumps. Lum Berry Toxicroak can switch in on Clefable and threaten with Cross Chop. Against Lanturn, Quagsire could be used to absorb Electric-type moves and attack with Earthquake. Dugtrio can be used to trap and eliminate Lanturn, Registeel, and Clefable. Using a Registeel yourself would also be useful since it can Explode on Clefable or Lanturn.</p> <p>Chansey is a big problem for this Ludicolo since it is only 5HKOed (with Leftovers factored in) by Hydro Pump, while it can cripple Ludicolo with either Thunder Wave or Toxic. Again, Lum Berry Toxicroak can be helpful against Chansey by absorbing a Thunder Wave or Toxic and striking back with Cross Chop. Dugtrio can also switch in on a Thunder Wave and strike Chansey down with two Earthquakes.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>While Ludicolo is generally seen as a special sweeper, this set can surprise opponents who switch in their special walls on Ludicolo. With a Swords Dance set up, Ludicolo reaches 524 Attack, which is deadly factoring in rain, which improves Waterfall's damage and Ludicolo's Speed, Life Orb, and great coverage.</p> <p>Swords Dance is the purpose of this set, allowing Ludicolo to boost its pitiful Attack stat to greater levels. Waterfall gives Ludicolo a strong STAB attack in the rain while also having a 20% chance to flinch lethal targets. Seed Bomb uses Ludicolo's secondary STAB to strike down Water-type Pokemon. Ice Punch rounds the set off by hitting Grass-type Pokemon and Altaria. In the last slot, Ice Punch is generally the preferred option for striking down Grass-types and Altaria, but Zen Headbutt can be used for eliminating Toxicroak while still hitting Venusaur.</p> <p>Adamant and max Attack is needed to give Ludicolo's base 70 Attack as much power as possible. The Speed EVs, like those on the special set, are geared to outrunning Timid Choice Scarf Rotom. Lastly, the remaining EVs are dumped into HP for additional bulk.</p> <p>Ludicolo appreciates other Rain Dance sweepers that can wear down the opposing team so Ludicolo can finish off the rest. Kabutops and Qwilfish can pair up with Ludicolo as additional Swords Dance sweepers to further break down the opponent's team. Omastar and Gorebyss can aid Ludicolo by attacking on the special side. Pokemon that can set up Rain Dance are beneficial to Ludicolo's ability to sweep. Uxie, Rotom, and Lanturn can all back up Ludicolo well, with Rotom and Lanturn covering Ludicolo's Flying weakness. Rotom also covers Ludicolo's Bug weakness as a bonus.</p>"

  "Vigoroth": {
    "overview": "<p>Vigoroth is easy to overlook, as it lies in the shadow of its much more powerful evolution, Slaking. Although it lacks the spectacular power of its fully-evolved counterpart, Vigoroth possesses the ability Vital Spirit, rather than the crippling Truant, making it a much more conventional physical attacking Normal-type. Unfortunately for Vigoroth, it faces stiff competition in that popular role from the likes of Kangaskhan, Tauros, Ursaring, Miltank, Zangoose, and more. Access to Encore and Bulk Up prevent it from being completely outclassed, but unless these narrow advantages fill a vital role on your team, there is usually a better option than Vigoroth.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Vigoroth can run a generic Choice Band set with Rock Slide or one of the elemental punches as the fourth attack, but base 80 Attack is simply too low for it to be worthwhile, and many other Normal-types can run the same set much more effectively. Vigoroth learns both Flail and Reversal, which can provide the power Vigoroth so desperately needs, but sets relying on such moves are easily ruined by priority and entry hazards, both of which are very common in UU. Shadow Claw is a Ghost-type clone of Night Slash, but the latter is generally preferable as no types are immune to Dark. Gunk Shot is one of Vigoroth's most powerful moves, but its unreliable accuracy and terrible coverage make it a poor option. Pursuit can hit enemies as they switch out of Encore, crushing frail Ghost- and Psychic-types in particular. Yawn is an alternative to Encore for forcing switches and generating free turns, but it requires Vigoroth to take a hit, and becomes useless if Sleep Clause is activated. Taunt prevents setup and status moves entirely, but does not create free turns for teammates. Vigoroth could also use Roar to force switches, but this is better left to more defensive Pokemon. Slack Off provides reliable instant recovery, but Vigoroth is 2HKOed by most special attackers and can't spare the moveslot anyway. Finally, Counter can be used to surprise a physical attacker, as Vigoroth can survive most unboosted physical hits.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Physical tanks with phazing moves can check any set that Vigoroth runs. Defensive variants of Torterra, for example, are not 2HKOed by even a Bulk Up-boosted Return, allowing it to come in and Roar Vigoroth away along with any boosts or Substitute it has set up. Hariyama and Hitmontop take little from Vigoroth's attacks and can KO it with their STAB attacks, but they must be wary of Vigoroth Encore locking them into a Fighting-type move and turning them into setup bait for one of its teammates. Mismagius with Taunt can prevent Vigoroth from using Encore; it can then burn Vigoroth with Will-O-Wisp or set up with Nasty Plot freely unless Vigoroth has Night Slash. Special sweepers and Fighting-types that are faster than Vigoroth can easily revenge kill it, but they cannot switch into Bulk Up-boosted attacks, and they must be careful when breaking Vigoroth's Substitutes to not use a move that will turn them into setup bait for an opposing sweeper. In general, Vigoroth itself threatens very little and is not difficult to defeat; the greater concern is to prevent it from helping its teammates set up.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Encore + Substitute": {
        "description": "<p>Vigoroth's underwhelming power often leaves it struggling to accomplish much on its own, so this set focuses on using Encore to turn opposing Pokemon into setup bait for Vigoroth's more powerful teammates. With its nice base 90 Speed, Vigoroth outspeeds the majority of UU, allowing it to switch in on a setup move (or sleep move, thanks to Vital Spirit) and Encore it without taking a hit. As the opponent is forced to repeat a harmless move, you can bring in your own sweeper for free and begin setting up. Alternatively, if you predict that the helpless foe will immediately switch out (or if you Encored a sleep move), Vigoroth can set up a Substitute and become even more dangerous. Vigoroth can then safely Encore whatever move the switch-in uses. If it's a setup move, Vigoroth is free to attack from behind its Substitute or switch to a teammate for free. If they attack to break the Substitute, then switch to a teammate that resists or is immune to the attack. Most opponents will leave in a Pokemon locked into an attack if they believe they can KO Vigoroth, giving you both a free switch on the resisted attack and a free turn afterwards to set up as the Encored Pokemon switches out.</p> <p>The final two moves are not critical to this set's success, as Vigoroth's primary goal is helping out its teammates rather than attacking, but they allow Vigoroth to do some damage if the situation calls for it. Return is a reliable STAB move that hits most Pokemon for neutral damage and requires little prediction to use. Focus Punch is a very viable alternative, however, as Vigoroth will usually only want to attack when it's safely behind a Substitute anyway. In the last slot, Sucker Punch is used to hit Ghost-types as they attack; it also works extremely well with Encore, which discourages opponents from setting up (something the aforementioned Ghost-types are apt to do).</p> <p>This set's performance depends on Vigoroth being faster than its opponent, so 252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature are used to ensure it outspeeds as many Pokemon as possible. 16 HP EVs give Vigoroth a Leftovers number plus 1, allowing it to create five Substitutes. The remaining EVs are placed in Attack to increase the power of Vigoroth's offensive moves. Despite the investment in Speed, there are still several faster Pokemon that can spoil Vigoroth's plans. Mismagius and Alakazam are especially dangerous, as they can use Taunt or Encore to shut Vigoroth down and proceed to set up. Running Night Slash over Sucker Punch is an option to hit them more reliably, but it's also a good idea to have a teammate with Pursuit, such as Spiritomb or Drapion, that can trap and KO them.</p> <p>Since Vigoroth's main objective is to create opportunities for its teammates to set up, it works best when paired with Pokemon that can become extremely threatening when given a free turn. Mismagius is an ideal partner; it can come in for free on Encored Fighting-, Ground-, and Normal-type attacks and set up a Substitute, then double its Special Attack with Nasty Plot and sweep through the opposing team. It is also a good idea to lay down multiple forms of entry hazards to punish the switches that Encore causes. Uxie is a reliable Stealth Rock user that can also fill a variety of defensive roles on a team, but many other Pokemon can perform this duty as well. Omastar has the rare ability to set up all three types of entry hazards, making it a good option to consider. Nidoqueen can set up Toxic Spikes as well as Stealth Rock, shuffle the opposing team with Roar, and is a great check to the Fighting-type Pokemon that threaten Vigoroth. A spinblocker such as Dusclops or RestTalk Rotom will also prove valuable to ensure the hazards stay on the field for the entire match.</p>"
      },
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>Although Vigoroth is mostly outclassed as an offensive Normal-type by Kangaskhan and Tauros, it does have the advantage of being able to boost its own power with Bulk Up. After a boost, Vigoroth's Attack reaches an impressive 388, allowing it to do some real damage. Bulk Up also boosts Vigoroth's respectable Defense, which helps it survive most priority attacks and carry on sweeping. Return is a consistent STAB attack that can OHKO most offensive Pokemon after a boost. Sucker Punch hits the Ghost-types that are immune to Return and also provides useful priority to make Vigoroth much harder to revenge kill. However, many Ghost-types carry Substitute and can set up freely on Sucker Punch, so Night Slash is a viable alternative to hit them more reliably. In the last slot, Low Kick is recommended for its power against Steel-types, allowing Vigoroth to 2HKO Steelix and Registeel, but Earthquake has nearly as much power against them while hitting Fire-, Poison-, and lighter Rock-types much harder. Alternatively, Encore can be used to give Vigoroth additional opportunities to boost up and prevent opposing Pokemon from setting up on Sucker Punch.</p> <p>The EVs are standard for a physical sweeper. An Adamant nature might be tempting to help make up for Vigoroth's low initial power, but Jolly is absolutely essential to ensure Vigoroth outspeeds the myriad of threats that rest between base 80 and 90 Speed, many of whom Vigoroth can OHKO with a boosted Return. Entry hazards help make up for the lack of power; after Stealth Rock damage, Vigoroth will always OHKO Life Orb Venusaur with a boosted Return. Uxie is a solid Stealth Rock user that can switch in on Fighting-types and spread paralysis to help guarantee that Vigoroth outspeeds the opposing team.</p> <p>Vigoroth requires a lot of support in order to actually sweep. Dedicated physical walls that aren't weak to Low Kick, such as Spiritomb, Torterra, and Slowbro, can come in on any move and cripple Vigoroth with status, phaze it, or heavily damage it with special attacks. Furthermore, any special attacker that is faster than Vigoroth can revenge kill it easily. Therefore, Vigoroth should not attempt to sweep until late in the match when walls have been weakened and potential revenge killers have been removed. If Encore is chosen over Low Kick in the fourth moveslot, Dugtrio support is almost mandatory to trap and defeat the Steel-types that would otherwise endlessly wall Vigoroth. Dugtrio is also very capable of taking out opposing sweepers that try to set up on Vigoroth and get Encore-locked into a harmless move.</p>"

  "Slaking": {
    "overview": "<p>While Slaking boasts immense physical strength, a phenomenal movepool, and excellently distributed stats, he is severely hampered by his ability, Truant, which causes him to be idle every other turn. Because of this, Slaking performs best when holding a Choice item, as it allows him to make the most of his discrete turns. Generally, Choiced Pokemon require some level of prediction to be used successfully, but this requirement is of far greater importance when using Slaking. Bringing Slaking onto the field is a huge gamble, and it will almost always result in a casualty; whether it is Slaking's or your opponent's, however, depends on who made the right move.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Slaking has many other options that he can use. Aside from Return, Slaking has four other decent STAB moves that can be used in its place. The first option is Body Slam, which has a cool 30% paralysis rate; however, Slaking is actually quite fast and almost always prefers the extra power that Return offers. The second and third options are Double-Edge and Facade in conjunction with Toxic Orb, and while both are more powerful than Return, they both also greatly undermine Slaking's bulk. The final (and most controversial) option is Giga Impact, and while it is without a doubt Slaking's most powerful attack, it also prevents Slaking from switching out the next turn, which can lead to some disastrous scenarios.</p> <p>Slack Off and Rest are options to keep Slaking healthy. However, Slaking is better off sticking to attacking moves instead, since the recovery is normally negated when Slaking loafs around. Slaking also has access to Rock Slide, but most of the time the elemental Punches offer greater coverage. Brick Break can be used for a reliable Fighting-type move, but with Earthquake being stronger, and there being no part-Flying or Levitating Steel-types in UU, it's almost always better to use the latter. Night Slash and Shadow Claw are practically interchangeable, so use whichever appeals to you more. Sucker Punch is a powerful priority move, but using it on a Choiced Slaking makes it one of the worst examples of setup bait in the game. A Life Orb set utilizing Sucker Punch is not completely out of the question, though. Taunt can stop Pokemon from setting up on Slaking, and for a huge surprise, Encore can be used to cripple Pokemon that get greedy in doing so. Yawn is also unexpected on Slaking, but many opponents will find themselves switching out from Slaking's attacks anyway.</p> <p>A wallbreaker set with a Rash nature, an EV spread of 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe, and a moveset along the lines of Fire Blast / Ice Beam / Thunderbolt / Return has a huge surprise factor, but clever opponents will take advantage of this in any way they can. Other than scoring an occasional KO on the likes of Tangrowth and Donphan, the above set is significantly easier to wall than any of Slaking's other sets, and is therefore less reliable. A Life Orb set is also fine if you feel that the inability to switch attacks is more detrimental than the power boost granted by Choice Band is beneficial. Finally, a Jolly nature can be used on the Choice Band set to outspeed up to positive-natured base 95 Pokemon such as Moltres, Leafeon, and Drapion.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>While Slaking seems like a divine force that is able to outright destroy just about anything with the right move, he can easily be countered by a number of strategies. The first strategy is to use Protect to stall out Slaking's attacking turn, and then strike him on the turn he loafs around. With this strategy, even physically fragile Pokemon such as Wish + Protect Chansey can easily stall him out. Another strategy is to use Substitute. Similar to Protect-abusing opponents, Slaking cannot win against a Substitute-abusing opponent that is faster than him. A dangerous example of a Pokemon that can abuse this strategy is Mismagius, which can switch in on the majority of Slaking's moveset, set up a Substitute, and then obtain a Calm Mind or Nasty Plot boost before sweeping Slaking's entire team. Substitute Dugtrio is particularly useful as he can trap Slaking with Arena Trap, and take it out, though it can only be brought in on a revenge kill. Finally, Slaking can easily be wasted by using a Pokemon that can take a hit and then use a recovery move to heal off the damage. Slowbro is a perfect example of a Pokemon who can effectively utilize this strategy, taking only a maximum of 66% from a Choice Band-boosted Return, Slaking's strongest attack against it; and by alternating between Slack Off and another one of its moves, it will ultimately triumph over Slaking. Be warned, however, that this last strategy is more prone to being ruined by critical hits than the previous two.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Slaking exhibits great distinction as a physical sweeper because of his herculean base 160 Attack (the third highest in the game) and quick base 100 Speed. Coupled with an unbelievably wide movepool, a hefty amount of bulk, and the power boost from Choice Band, Slaking will be flattening opposing teams in no time.</p> <p>STAB Return coming off 690 Attack is no joke at all, and it OHKOes a great number of Pokemon, while at the very least 2HKOing every Pokemon that doesn't resist it. However, using it randomly in the hopes of hitting an opponent hard is not recommended, as Slaking's ability firmly punishes any misplays. Instead, you should initially have Slaking scout with a coverage move to keep your opponents on their toes. Earthquake hits Rock- and Steel-types that resist Return very hard, 2HKOing the standard Steelix and Regirock, as well as OHKOing Registeel with Stealth Rock and two layers of Spikes on the field. Fire Punch also hits Steel-types super effectively, and although it is not as powerful as Earthquake, it also OHKOes frail Levitating Ghost-types such as Mismagius and Rotom with Stealth Rock support. In the final slot, Slaking has two promising options in Shadow Claw and Pursuit. The first is a reliable option to nail defensive Ghost-types, 2HKOing even the bulkiest of them after Stealth Rock, but Pursuit can be used to trap foes that might attempt to flee from Slaking.</p> <p>Because any opponent will gladly set up on Slaking whenever they can, a number of partners can help to counter these nuisances. Having a phazer on your side can dramatically help in defeating Substitute-using stat boosters. Defensive Hariyama with Whirlwind is a great choice for this role, and if Slaking mispredicts against Rock- and Steel-types, Hariyama can also use its super effective STAB Fighting-type attacks to crumble them. In general, Pokemon that are immune to Will-O-Wisp, able to switch in on Fighting-type attacks and threaten their users, and can deal with Rock- and Steel-types are great teammates to Slaking.</p> <p>This Slaking greatly benefits from the use of entry hazards. With three layers of Spikes and Stealth Rock on the field, Slaking deals a minimum of 99% to the standard Regirock with Earthquake. Similarly, other physically defensive opponents such as Tangrowth and Torterra are also potentially OHKOed with these entry hazards in play. Defensive Drapion is a fantastic partner as it can set up Toxic Spikes, use Whirlwind to phaze, and threaten Slowbro and Mismagius with Crunch. Using a spinblocker to prevent opponents from spinning away any entry hazards you set up is also recommended. Pokemon like Rotom and Spiritomb are the best at the job because they are immune to Fighting-type attacks, and sport good, balanced stats; furthermore, RestTalk versions can absorb any status that opponents might have attempted to inflict upon Slaking.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Slaking is designed to use a hit-and-run approach to pick off opposing Pokemon one by one. While the loss of Choice Band's power is disheartening, an Attack stat of 460 is still very threatening, and with an Adamant nature, Slaking reaches a Speed stat of 448, which is enough to outrun numerous common Pokemon; up to Scarfed positive-natured base 85s, which is essentially the entire metagame. These characteristics allow Slaking to become a great revenge killer that can even take a hit or two when needed.</p> <p>Return is the obligatory STAB move, and it packs an insane amount of power; in fact, it even hits harder than a 2x super effective elemental punch, which is why most of them have been omitted from the set. Earthquake is Slaking's response to Rock- and Steel-types that arrogantly believe they can wall him, while Shadow Claw deals with Ghost-types that are immune to Return. The final slot goes to Ice Punch, which is great for revenge killing Rock Polish Torterra and Bulky Dragon Dance Altaria, both of which are not OHKOed by Return.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Slaking is unable to do much damage to bulkier walls, allowing them to have a very easy time with him. Calm Mind Slowbro is more than happy to face Scarf Slaking, as it is able to Slack Off any damage taken, set up with Calm Mind, and cause immense problems for your team. Steelix, Regirock, and Registeel don't take too much damage from Slaking's unboosted Earthquake, and they resist the rest of Slaking's moveset. Tangrowth can easily take whatever Slaking decides to use against it and threaten with Leech Seed, Power Whip, or Sleep Powder. The key to using Choice Scarf Slaking is to realize one very important thing: even with 460 Attack, Slaking still loses to many opponents. Therefore, it would be wise to scout first, know what Slaking can and can't deal with, take down the Pokemon that he can't harm, and then send him in.</p> <p>To trap and KO Steel-types, Magneton and Dugtrio are sensational options. Dugtrio is particularly great because it can take out both Rock- and Steel-types, as well as Blaziken, all of which Slaking has trouble taking on. As with Choice Band Slaking, bulky phazers and entry hazards will help immensely against stat boosters and for securing KOs, respectively.</p>"

  "Shedinja": {
    "overview": "<p>Shedinja is far and away the most unique Pokemon in the game. It has just 1, yes 1, HP, but it's protected by its ability Wonder Guard, which makes Shedinja completely immune to any damage that isn't a super effective attack or passive damage. While immunity to a whole slew of attacks sounds awesome and would make Shedinja one of the premier walls in the game, it is unfortunately KOed by literally any passive damage, which is rife in today's metagame. Shedinja's stats are also pretty unimpressive; it's extremely slow and has a terrible movepool which undermines its good Attack stat.</p> <p>Shedinja is hard to use, but it does have a valuable niche in the metagame; it's one of the best counters available for Water-, Grass-, Poison-, and Electric-type Pokemon that lack Toxic or a super effective attack, which normally includes Pokemon such as Milotic, Venusaur, Leafeon, Exeggutor, Lanturn, Slowbro, Azumarill, Feraligatr, and Cloyster, among many others. Shedinja is the definition of high-risk high-reward, and if you can keep it away from Ghost-, Fire-, Rock-, Flying-, and Dark-type attacks, as well as burn, poison, sandstorm, hail, Leech Seed, and entry hazards, it can prove to be the ultimate \"win condition\" Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There really isn't much else Shedinja can do. Life Orb and Substitute cannot be used, as the recoil from both will faint Shedinja. A Choice item + Trick set can be utilized, and can really mess with some of Shedinja's common counters such as Registeel that carry Shadow Claw, but Shedinja works much better with Swords Dance as an end-game sweeper. Shadow Claw is an alternative STAB move to Shadow Sneak, but Shedinja really wants priority to bypass its middling Speed. Aerial Ace is a nice move to put the hurt on Venusaur, Scyther, and Fighting-types, but there just isn't any room for it on the Swords Dance set. Shedinja is a good sleep absorber and can make use of Sleep Talk, but it can't use Rest. Finally, Toxic can be used instead of Will-O-Wisp, as it is a nice way to defeat Pokemon such as Milotic, but Shedinja's utility in burning physical attackers is too good to pass up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Outside of entry hazards, poison, burn, Leech Seed, and damaging weather, Pursuit is the easiest way to dispose of Shedinja. Drapion, Absol, Skuntank, and Spiritomb are all good users of it, just be sure to avoid Will-O-Wisp when switching in (though the decreased Attack won't matter when facing Shedinja). Literally any Fire-, Rock-, Ghost-, Dark-, and Flying-type attack will KO Shedinja, it doesn't even need to be powerful, you just have to hit the husk. Finally, if all other options are exhausted, confusion is a great way to mess with Shedinja. However, if you lack any of the above options, the Shedinja user will win automatically unless you can somehow manage to PP stall it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>This set tries to abuse Shedinja's decent base 90 Attack stat and mediocre movepool to its fullest. Using Shedinja is a very complicated ordeal, and the strategy of this set is actually not as straightforward as you'd think. Because there are so many Pokemon that counter Shedinja, the best move to use when you successfully get Shedinja in on a Pokemon that can't harm it, such as Venusaur and Azumarill, is to burn the switch-in with Will-O-Wisp, instead of using Swords Dance right away. The reason behind this is because the go-to counter for Shedinja for most players are Pursuit users, since they can KO Shedinja whether it stays in or not. Shedinja essentially has two lives with a Focus Sash, so after it (hopefully) burns the switch-in and gets hit with Pursuit as it switches out, Shedinja will have one life left to come in again, and the opponent's Pursuit user will be severely crippled by the burn from Will-O-Wisp. This will make it much easier for your team to dispose of the opponent's Pursuit user, and lets Shedinja come in later in the match to set up on whatever Pokemon are left on the opponent's team, without fear of getting trapped by Pursuit.</p> <p>Shedinja is incredibly slow, so its main attack is left to a priority move. The choice between Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch is entirely down to personal preference. Shadow Sneak is preferred though due to its consistency, and it is only slightly weaker than Sucker Punch thanks to STAB. X-Scissor is a nice powerful STAB move that grants Shedinja coverage on Normal-types. Shedinja should not begin to Swords Dance until you are confident you know the opponent's team and can predict the opponent's next switch-in. Once you are sure all threats are eliminated, Swords Dance to your heart's delight and watch as your opponent just succumbs to Shedinja's silent might.</p> <p>The only EVs that matter to Shedinja are those in Attack, since even with a Jolly nature, Shedinja isn't going to be outpacing much, and the priority move of choice bypasses its low Speed stat. Any EVs in its defenses or HP won't do anything, as Shedinja only has 1 HP. Focus Sash is the recommended item, as it grants Shedinja a second life as described above, and protects Shedinja from an unexpected super effective attack, such as Rock Slide from Tangrowth. Lum Berry can be used to save Shedinja from a potentially fatal poison or burn. This is particularly useful against Pokemon like Lanturn or Milotic, who can surprise Shedinja with Toxic. Baton Pass may seem like a golden move to have on this set, but unfortunately, due to legality issues, Shedinja cannot run both Swords Dance and Baton Pass on the same set. Theoretically you could just run Baton Pass over Swords Dance because Shedinja will eventually KO what it needs to KO if the opponent can't touch it, but a Swords Dance-boosted Shadow Sneak OHKOs Mismagius, Alakazam, and Rotom, which can prove invaluable if you're unaware that your opponent was in possession of those Pokemon.</p> <p>If at all possible, the best way to play with Shedinja is to keep it hidden for as long as you can, and only bring it out when you've scouted the entirety of the opponent's team or if you really have to absorb an attack or stop a sweeper. A good way to scout the opponent's team is to enlist U-turn abusers, such as Swellow, Scyther, or Primeape, on your team. When using Shedinja, Rapid Spin support is absolutely mandatory, as any entry hazard spells doom for it. Good users of Rapid Spin to pair with Shedinja include Hitmontop and Blastoise. Both have Foresight to ensure that Rapid Spin will execute properly, and both are relatively bulky so they can survive long enough to make sure that there are no entry hazards on the field when you do bring out Shedinja. Sandstorm and hail also cannot be in play, so either Rain Dance or Sunny Day support should be available if using Shedinja. Your team need not be centralized on the choice of weather, though they should be able to take advantage of it. Lanturn can make great use of Rain Dance and Moltres is fearsome with the sun shining.</p> <p>Toxic and Will-O-Wisp are fatal if they come into contact with Shedinja when it isn't holding a Lum Berry, so having Pokemon to absorb these attacks is necessary. Venusaur and other Poison-types, Clefable, and Steel-types are immune to Toxic, while Arcanine and other Fire-types are immune to Will-O-Wisp. A Swords Dance-boosted Shadow Sneak will OHKO Mismagius and Rotom, but Spiritomb and Dusclops will both prove problematic, so having a teammate to eliminate them is essential. Flash Fire Houndoom is an incredible Pokemon to pair with Shedinja because they cover each other's weaknesses almost perfectly; Houndoom can switch into any Fire-, Ghost-, or Dark-type attack aimed at Shedinja, and can easily blast both Spiritomb and Dusclops into oblivion with its STAB attacks. Clefable is another great partner as it can switch into any status or Ghost-type attack without fear. Milotic, Slowbro, and Slowking are amazing partners for Shedinja as well because they can switch into Moltres, Arcanine, Rhyperior, and Aggron with near-impunity and drench them with a super effective STAB Surf. However, while Shedinja requires a lot of support, it does provide useful protection for a variety of Pokemon and those that can capitalize on its unique qualities are the best teammates for Shedinja. Rhyperior loves Shedinja's ability to burn physical attackers and absorb Water-, Fighting-, Grass-, Ice-, Steel-, and Ground-type attacks. In return, Rhyperior can switch into Rock-, Flying-, and most Fire-type attacks for Shedinja.</p>"

  "Hariyama": {
    "overview": "<p>Hariyama fills a very exclusive niche in UU as one of only two bulky Fighting-types. Packaged with excellent base 144/60/60 defenses, an auspicious typing, and Thick Fat to provide a most fortunate set of resistances, Hariyama makes for an excellent tank, checking a variety of threats while simultaneously dishing out the hurt with his potent Fighting STAB. Access to Guts only makes Hariyama that much more dangerous, and he's more than capable of going on the offensive with moves such as Close Combat, Stone Edge, and Payback. Not to mention his awesome base 120 Attack stat, which is one of the highest in the tier.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it's not all cyanide and happiness for Hariyama; as with any Fighting-type in UU, he's faced with stiff competition. Hitmonlee and Blaziken, though lacking the same amount of bulk, are significantly faster than Hariyama, and often leave him in the dust when there's a spot for a more offensive role. Similarly, Hitmontop's access to Rapid Spin, Intimidate, and myriad priority moves also has Hariyama faltering on the defensive and supportive side. Regardless, in the face of his rivals, Hariyama is still a most formidable, most threatening, and most unique Pokemon, so one would be wise to prepare for him whatever the case.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Looking at other potential sets, a Choice Band set is actually completely viable, and would be listed if it was not for the fact that Hariyama gets Guts, which outclasses it set-wise in most ways. Belly Drum is just plain bad on Hariyama, as he simply does not have the Speed to use it effectively at all. A Bulk Up set is also viable, but is either way too easily walled, phazed, or just defeated in general. In terms of other STAB options, Hariyama has plenty; Revenge, Brick Break, and Low Kick being the actually viable ones. While all of them are fine moves in their own right, they are simply not as good as the STAB moves already listed. Rock Slide can go over Stone Edge on any set. Knock Off can be extremely annoying for Pokemon that rely on their items for success, and finally, Refresh can work, but has its uses shared with (and done better by) Rest and Guts.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Hariyama's sheer power, coverage, bulk, and versatility makes outright countering him a herculean task. Spiritomb comes close, with good bulk, an immunity to Fighting, and no weaknesses. It even has Taunt to block Whirlwind, and can set up on Hariyama with Calm Mind. However, it is not completely safe, as a Guts-boosted Stone Edge will 3HKO even its most defensive set, and if further boosted by a Life Orb, Spiritomb will be 2HKOed. Weezing is a similar case, and though faring slightly better against offensive variants, it is largely useless against the defensive set. Besides those two, bulky Psychic-types also make good general switch-ins; they must be wary of Payback, however, as it 2HKOes all of them when boosted by Guts. Taunt Mismagius can play similarly to Spiritomb against the defensive set, but shouldn't be trying to face down offensive variants anytime soon. It's usually best to not try to out-tank Hariyama, but rather focus on his low Speed stat and weaken him gradually before taking him out. In this case, powerful Psychic- and Flying-types such as Alakazam and Swellow are best.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Although Hariyama may often be thought of as too slow, a Guts-boosted STAB Close Combat coming off a base 120 Attack stat is still pretty scary, and with moves such as Payback for coverage on those pesky Ghost-types, and Bullet Punch for ever-useful priority, it's no wonder that Hariyama has made himself known as a most formidable offensive threat. The final slot is a mish-mash of useful options; Fake Out is usually the best choice so Hariyama may activate his Toxic Orb in complete safety, while also getting off some free damage. If using Life Orb, however, the last two become much more viable for their invaluable coverage on Flying-types. It is noteworthy to point out that Hariyama makes a surprisingly effective lead with this set, getting favorable match-ups against common foes such as Ambipom (with Protect over Bullet Punch or Payback), Cloyster, Omastar, and Hippopotas.</p> <p>Toxic Orb is the first item slashed because of its larger power boost and ability to block status. The turn it takes to activate can also be made inconsequential thanks to Fake Out. Life Orb, on the other hand, is still a good option, as it prevents Protect and Substitute users from wearing Hariyama down so easily. In addition, if you manage to activate Guts on top of it, Hariyama will pack gratuitous amounts of power, and will be able to 2HKO just about every opponent in his path. The EV spread is fairly simple, with maximum Attack for power, enough Speed to outpace minimum base 60 Speed Pokemon such as Clefable and Weezing, and the rest in Defense for bulk. Because Hariyama's HP is so massive already, investing in a defense is always the better course of action. Thus, shifting all of those Defense EVs into Special Defense can also be a good idea, and would depend on what you find Hariyama switching into most often. An evenly-distributed spread is also an option, but this is sort of a jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none scenario.</p> <p>If using this set as a lead, one must make note of the unfavorable match-ups as well. In particular, Hariyama has trouble dealing with opposing Moltres, Spiritomb, and Alakazam leads. A defensive core along the lines of Milotic and Registeel can help patch up this weakness remarkably well. Hariyama will also appreciate entry hazard and paralysis support, as the secured KOs and ability to actually outspeed things will allow for a much cleaner sweep on his part. Conveniently, both of these forms of support can be provided by the aforementioned Registeel. Finally, Houndoom makes a very good teammate, simply because of its ability to deal with Spiritomb, a major thorn in Hariyama's side.</p>"

      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<p>Hariyama is one of only two bulky Fighting-types in UU, and though he lacks the movepool and utility of his competitor, Hitmontop, he more than makes up for it with his greater bulk, power, and Thick Fat ability. This Hariyama can reliably switch in and check a variety of threats, including, but not limited to, Aggron, Absol, Tauros, Houndoom, Arcanine, and Registeel. Force Palm is the STAB move of choice, as it deals enough damage to what it needs to and has a very nifty paralysis chance, which makes many offensive Pokemon, even those that resist it, wary of switching into Hariyama. Cross Chop is the more powerful alternative for STAB, but it has imperfect accuracy, and does not have any useful secondary effects. It does, however, grant Hariyama the OHKO on Aggron and Chansey, the 2HKO on Registeel, Rhyperior, and Clefable, and the 3HKO on Regirock, whereas Force Palm would not. Whirlwind is the other key move of the set, as the ability to directly cause switches and phaze are most valuable assets indeed, and are things that Hitmontop can only dream of doing itself. Finally, RestTalk is used to keep Hariyama healthy throughout the match and allow him to absorb status.</p> <p>Payback can be used to smack down Ghost-types that attempt to sponge Hariyama's attacks, while Stone Edge and Ice Punch are options to hit Flying-types such as Altaria super effectively. These moves would have to go over Rest and Sleep Talk if you decide to use them, as a STAB move and Whirlwind are considered mandatory. This also means that Hariyama won't have any form of recovery outside of Leftovers, so keep that in mind. The 12 EVs in HP hit a Leftovers number, and the rest of the EVs maximize both of Hariyama's defenses. An Impish nature is more appropriate for the metagame, but if you find Hariyama switching into special attackers more often on your team, a Careful nature would then be preferred.</p> <p>This particular Hariyama set works well as a defensive pivot; coming in, taking a few hits, dishing some back, maybe using Whirlwind once in a while, and switching out again. Because of this, Wish support can be useful so that Hariyama does not have to waste time using Rest and relying on the shaky Sleep Talk. Hypno is ideal for this, as Hariyama resists both its Dark- and Bug-type weaknesses, while Hypno can absorb any Psychic-type attacks aimed at Hariyama. Chansey and Clefable are also good for Wish, and even though neither have any resistances that benefit Hariyama, they are more useful Pokemon in general. Entry hazards are also helpful, as with Whirlwind shuffling your opponent's team again and again, passive damage will easily be taking their toll very quickly. A Pokemon such as Omastar, who happens to resist Flying, can do this very well.</p>"

      "SubPunch": {
        "description": "<p>It would be a waste to not at least try Focus Punch on Hariyama; coming off a base 120 Attack stat and boosted by STAB, it is indeed a thing to be feared. Being Focus Punch, however, it requires that Hariyama charge up before it is unleashed, and during that time, his concentration can be interrupted by even the slightest pinprick. Thankfully, Hariyama also gets access to Substitute, which he can set up against a variety of foes thanks to his great bulk, and use it to protect himself whilst he achieves zen, guaranteeing that he is able to fire off his brutal attack unhindered. Payback covers the Ghost- and Psychic-types that may attempt to endure Hariyama's forceful fists, OHKOing all but the most defensively dedicated, whereas the last slot covers the Flying-types that also resist Focus Punch.</p> <p>Attack is maximized so that Hariyama's Focus Punch is as powerful as possible, while the 4 Speed EVs enable him to outspeed minimum Speed base 50s. After that, things start to get a little trickier; because the attackers in UU are so powerful, Hariyama is unable to gain many new setup opportunities with the EVs he has left. A specially defensive spread will at least make it so that Houndoom will be unable to break Hariyama's Substitute with Dark Pulse, and only sometimes with Fire Blast. Even then, many other dedicated special attackers will still be able to punch through them fairly comfortably. The same can be said with a physically defensive spread. So really, those last 252 EVs come down to preference, and are pretty much free game.</p> <p>Houndoom is an awesome teammate to Hariyama, as it often attracts special walls to itself, all of whom Hariyama can set up on with particular ease. It also conveniently handles Weezing, Slowbro, and Spiritomb--all of which are Pokemon Hariyama has trouble breaking through. Second to that, dual screen support will help immensely in Hariyama's ability to set up, practically increasing the number of Pokemon that can't break his Substitute three-fold. Such a defensive platform can be provided by a Pokemon like Uxie, who is also able to set up that awesome entry hazard everybody loves--Stealth Rock. Last but not least, Wish support is helpful in helping Hariyama recover the HP he lost from making Substitutes; Chansey and Clefable are generally the best Wish users in the tier.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>As a Pokemon without any type weaknesses, you'd think Sableye would stand out as a god among simpletons. Unfortunately, the real deity of Pokemon, Arceus, was none too kind to our little gem gremlin; a quick look at its base stats and abilities will tell you exactly why that is. Without a single stat above base 75, two horrible abilities that do nothing to help it, and a movepool that somehow lacks Pursuit, Sableye is left utterly outclassed by its Ghost / Dark compatriot, Spiritomb. If ever there was a Pokemon in need of an evolution, it's this one. If you're planning to use Sableye on your team, it's probably best if you choose Spiritomb instead.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sableye's movepool is surprisingly wide, though it lacks the base stats to use most of its moves effectively. Sableye has access to Calm Mind and Nasty Plot for boosting sets, though they focus on Sableye's weaker special stats. Sableye can make use of a Choice Scarf or Choice Band set with Trick, though unfortunately, without Pursuit, it's horribly outclassed by Spiritomb. A lead set consisting of Fake Out / Payback / Shadow Sneak / Taunt with a Focus Sash can be run, but Sableye is just too slow to use it effectively. Moonlight is an alternative healing option to Recover, though it should only be considered if using Sableye on a Sunny Day team. Finally, Sableye has access to the elusive Gravity, though Dusclops and Clefable are better users of this move due to their superior bulk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Milotic is the perfect counter to Sableye, as it can take advantage of the burn from Will-O-Wisp with its ability, Marvel Scale, and easily breaks down Sableye by hitting it in its weaker Special Defense stat with Surf. Rest-less Milotic should be wary of Toxic, however. Steel-types, such as Registeel, Steelix, and Aggron, are immune to Toxic, and Choice Band Aggron can easily stomp Sableye into the dust even when crippled by a burn. Guts Hariyama, Swellow, and Ursaring easily defeat Sableye thanks to the Attack boost they gain from Will-O-Wisp and Toxic. Basically any strong special attacker that you would consider running in UU, such as Venusaur, Moltres, and Sceptile, can OHKO or 2HKO any Sableye without much trouble.</p>",

Sableye's goal with this set is to spread burn with Will-O-Wisp and stop the opponent from Rapid Spinning your team's entry hazards off the field. Sableye's typing grants it immunities to Fighting-, Normal-, and Psychic-type attacks, making it a natural candidate for burning many of the physical Fighting- and Normal-type attackers in the UU tier, such as Hitmonlee, Hitmontop, and Tauros. Taunt stops set-up attackers and turns Sableye into an effective stallbreaker. Will-O-Wisp and Taunt together allows Sableye to beat most slow RestTalk Pokemon one-on-one, particularly Curse Regirock and Curse Registeel. Toxic is an alternative to Taunt that weakens many of Sableye's switch-ins, such as Arcanine, Houndoom, and Spiritomb. Seismic Toss and Night Shade are for consistent damage, and make sure that Sableye isn't totally helpless against opposing Taunt users. Seismic Toss is the recommended attack, as it hits Normal-types who Sableye should be attempting to counter; on the other hand, Night Shade hits Ghost-types who are common switch-ins into Sableye, as most times Sableye won't be running a threatening attacking move. Finally, the last slot is given to Recover, which allows Sableye to outstall Rest-less Spiritomb if using Toxic, and it is generally helpful for a defensive Pokemon to have reliable recovery anyway.</p> <p>An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD can be run; however, Sableye has a tough time taking physical attacks even with full investment and the opposing Pokemon burned, so it's recommended to stick with physical bulk. Another optional spread of 252 HP / 120 Def / 136 SpD can be used to balance Sableye's defenses, but it's better off fully investing in one stat or the other, as with no particular stat emphasized, Sableye will have a tough time standing up to any sort of attack. Finally, Sableye can run enough Speed to outrun common Rapid Spin users, such as Donphan and Blastoise, though it is not recommended as Sableye needs all of the bulk it can get.</p> <p>Sableye can fill its third moveslot with an alternative attacking move, though such moves are highly situational and, without investment, will usually be significantly weaker than Night Shade or Seismic Toss. Shadow Sneak is the primary alternative move, as with it, Sableye can pick off weakened Alakazam, Mismagius, and Rotom. Shadow Claw and Shadow Ball are Sableye's strongest STAB moves, but most of the time Night Shade or Seismic Toss will prove to be more useful. Knock Off is an alternative support move to strip opposing walls of Leftovers or attackers of Life Orb, but it's hard to find a move to give up in its place. Finally, Pain Split can be used instead of Recover, but instant and reliable recovery is almost always the better choice.</p> <p>Stall teams love Pokemon capable of spinblocking, and Sableye's typing fits the bill perfectly; good teammates to set up entry hazards include Omastar, Qwilfish, and Uxie. Unfortunately, Sableye has a tough time dealing with a couple of Rapid Spin users, particularly Donphan and Blastoise, so having a back up spinblocker, such as Mismagius or Rotom, is recommended. This strategy is commonly referred to as the 'double Ghost' strategy, and provides a way to ensure that entry hazards are maintained on your opponent's side of the field. If using two Ghosts, Sableye should utilize Toxic to help its teammates stall more effectively.</p> <p>Sableye is in its element when switching into Normal- and Fighting-type physical attackers and burning them, so partners that enjoy having those Pokemon burned love Sableye as a partner. Registeel, Chansey, and Clefable all appreciate a teammate to take Fighting attacks for them, and in return can absorb most special attacks aimed at Sableye. Registeel can also switch into Swellow with ease, who would normally switch into Sableye's Will-O-Wisp for the Guts boost. Milotic is a great teammate due to its ability to switch into Fire-types, such as Arcanine, Houndoom, and Moltres, with ease. Weezing makes another great partner, as it's able to switch into the Guts-abusing Hariyama and Ursaring easily, and loves Sableye's ability to switch into Psychic-type attacks for free.</p>"

  "Aggron": {
    "overview": "<p>Aggron is a neat Pokemon with good stat distribution and a good movepool--it is just hampered by two terrible 4x weaknesses to very common attack types. Aggron is a real force in the UU environment, battering everything in sight with STAB Head Smash from an impressive base 110 Attack.</p> <p>What sets Aggron apart from other Rock-types is its Steel typing. This gives Aggron a whole slew of resistances, which means it will have an easier time switching into moves such as Ice Beam and U-turn than most Rock-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aggron can run Screech in order to beat some of its common counters. After a Screech, Head Smash OHKOes most Pokemon without a Rock resistance, and Donphan, Claydol, and Rhyperior are all KOed by Aqua Tail. Since it doesn't need an Adamant nature to attain these KOes, Aggron can run a Jolly nature, which allows it to outpace defensive Milotic and OHKO it with Head Smash after Screech. However, most of Aggron's common switch-ins are 2HKOed by Head Smash or by a Head Smash followed by the appropriate coverage move anyway. As such, you are better off just outright attacking in most cases.</p> <p>Aggron could run a more defensive set with sandstorm support, but it is almost always outclassed by other bulky Rock-types due to its low HP. Stealth Rock is also an option as a filler, but Aggron will almost always be doing more harm by crushing the opponent with Head Smash.</p> <p>Iron Tail is an option as well, especially if you pair Aggron with Gravity to compensate for its poor accuracy. It has decent coverage with Head Smash and has a chance to lower the target's Defense.</p> <p>A decent Trick Room set could be used since Aggron is slow and hits like a mack truck; Head Smash will destroy almost anything that doesn't resist it. The trouble is when Trick Room isn't up, Aggron is too specially frail to do anything without getting OHKOed first. Even with Aggron's horrible Speed, Choice Scarf is a viable option. With a Choice Scarf, Aggron can outrun Pokemon with base 95 Speed, and it still hits hard enough to 2HKO Milotic after Stealth Rock.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Switching into a 225 Base Power (factoring in STAB) attack, from an Attack stat of 350, is no easy task. Resisting Head Smash isn't enough; you need to resist it and have impressive Defense. Donphan, Nidoqueen, and Claydol wall Aggron's Fighting and Rock attacks, but they need to beware of Choice Band Ice Punch and Aqua Tail. Milotic can switch in and OHKO Aggron if it packs 8 Speed EVs to outrun Aggron as well. Hitmontop can switch into Head Smash after an Intimidate and OHKO with a STAB Fighting attack. Quagsire and Gastrodon are only 3HKOed by Aggron's Head Smash as long as there are no Spikes on the field, and they can Recover and set up Curse. In OU, Swampert and Hippowdon are the two best counters since they resist Head Smash and aren't hit too hard by Aggron's coverage moves. They can both send STAB Earthquakes at Aggron, which will easily OHKO.</p> <p>Revenge killing is far easier, especially if Rock Polish isn't in effect. Any Pokemon with a super effective special attack, or simply any Fighting- or Ground-type attack, will easily OHKO Aggron. Vacuum Wave works great if you need to revenge kill Aggron after Rock Polish, since it will likely not be able to survive it as long as it's coming from a decent Special Attack stat. Mach Punch will do well too, but Aggron can survive as long as it has a decent amount of HP left.</p> <p>Most neutral special attacks will do good damage; just beware of Aggron's high attack power when using frail special sweepers.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>With Choice Band and a Jolly nature, Aggron reaches an astounding 478 Attack. Aggron is easily capable of switching into battle thanks to its numerous resistances. Head Smash is Aggron's main form of attack due to its absurd Base Power, good offensive typing, and STAB. Aqua Tail pairs nicely with Head Smash, hitting those Pokemon hoping to switch into a Rock attack (such as Rock/Ground-types) for super effective damage. Low Kick nails Pokemon such as Steelix, Regirock, and Registeel for an easy 2HKO, while Ice Punch destroys Torterra. If you don't fear Torterra setting up, and you need a way to reliably take out bulky Grass or Water Pokemon, Toxic is a good option over Ice Punch.</p> <p>With a Jolly nature, Aggron will almost always outrun defensive Milotic, and basically any other defensive Pokemon. However, an Adamant nature is viable, boosting Aggron's Attack to 525, meaning Aggron will hit that much harder. Aggron still outpaces most of the walls in UU, but there are defensive Pokemon, such as Milotic and Venusaur, who can easily be faster than Aggron with just 8 or 12 EVs invested in Speed.</p> <p>Aggron works best when used with a sandstorm. In UU, unfortunately, Hippopotas is the only option to set up sandstorm, but it at least can support Aggron with Stealth Rock as well. Speaking of Stealth Rock, Aggron will force a ton of switches regardless of which set it is using, so residual damage of any kind is beneficial.</p> <p>Offensively, Aggron will easily clear the path for fast and frail physical sweepers such as Swellow and Ambipom, since a Choice Band boosted STAB Head Smash will 2HKO or even OHKO many physical walls. With its monstrous Attack and Head Smash's absurd Base Power, Aggron can destroy many of the common physical walls in UU. If you are aiming to sweep with Aggron, using Pokemon such as Blaziken to clear out some of the physical walls is a good idea. Packing a strong Pursuit user to get rid of Claydol is also recommended.</p> <p>Since Aggron will always be locked into an attack, it needs much more defensive support than the other two sets. Pokemon such as Donphan and Steelix easily force Aggron out if it's using Head Smash, so using Pokemon such as Tangrowth or Slowbro to take the physical hits with ease and hit back with STAB attacks is a good idea. Also, almost any special Water-type attack will OHKO Aggron outside of sandstorm, and special attacks in general hurt Aggron. This makes Chansey and Clefable great teammates for Aggron since they can take special hits quite easily, while also being able to set up Stealth Rock and spread paralysis. Clefable can also Encore a Pokemon to help Aggron set up. Mismagius and Rotom have amazing synergy with Aggron, since they resist each other's weaknesses, except for Aggron's Water weakness. Altaria is also a great partner since it resists every one of Aggron's weaknesses.</p>"
      },
      "SubPunch": {
        "description": "<p>Aggron has decent bulk with some HP investment, especially on the physical side, allowing it to easily set up a Substitute on many Pokemon. It also helps that Aggron has quite the ability to force switches with its dangerous 150 Base Power Head Smash attack. The major thing holding Aggron back is its 4x weakness to the ever-common Ground-type attacks, so that's where Magnet Rise comes in. With Magnet Rise, Aggron is barely touchable by its usual counters, who rely on Earthquake to hit Aggron. This means Pokemon such as Donphan will be forced to use Stone Edge, which merely 3HKOes Aggron's Substitute. Pokemon such as Steelix and Donphan are also hit hard by Focus Punch, another 150 Base Power move (though it lacks STAB). The strategy is pretty straightforward: you come in on one of the many attacks that Aggron resists and set up a Substitute. If the opponent switches in a Pokemon such as the previously mentioned Donphan or Steelix, use Magnet Rise. Proceed to destroy your opponent's team from behind your Substitute with Head Smash and Focus Punch. If your opponent has Roar on their Steelix or Donphan, it may be wise to just use Focus Punch instead of Magnet Rise, especially if you have used Magnet Rise earlier in the match.</p> <p>84 Speed outruns minimum Speed Clefable and Weezing, allowing Aggron to hit them with Head Smash or set up Substitute before getting hit by a status effect. This also helps against Brave Cloyster who runs Surf and would otherwise break your Substitute or even OHKO you before you can OHKO it. 160 HP EVs reaches a Leftovers point +1 HP, allowing Aggron to use Substitute five times from full health. The remaining EVs are put in Special Defense to allow Aggron to more easily switch into Choiced Shadow Ball and Dark Pulse, but they can also be placed into Speed.</p> <p>This set is exceptional with residual damage. It forces switches with Magnet Rise, and Stealth Rock and Spikes turn many 2HKOes into OHKOes, such as against Venusaur. Sandstorm support is also great; it gives Aggron an impressive Special Defense stat to go along with its decent defensive typing. This means Aggron will be able to set up Substitutes on more Pokemon.</p> <p>Since this is essentially a lure for physically defensive Pokemon, Aggron makes a great Pokemon to use alongside Pokemon such as Swellow or Ambipom. With Donphan, Regirock, Registeel, or Steelix out of the way, Swellow and Ambipom can abuse their Speed and powerful Normal-type attacks. Unfortunately, while Aggron has great resistances and Defense, it still has trouble with Water- and Fighting-type attacks. This makes Slowbro and Slowking great teammates for this Aggron set, as they easily fend off both of those attacking types while also spreading paralysis, which always helps any Pokemon with Substitute.</p>"
      },
      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<p>With Head Smash and a very respectable Attack stat, the only thing stopping Aggron from plowing through teams is its poor Speed. Of course, this can be remedied by Rock Polish, which boosts Aggron's Speed to a whopping 398, outrunning Pokemon such as Dugtrio, Alakazam, and Sceptile, even with a Speed boosting nature. It also outpaces neutral natured base 80s with Choice Scarf, but with a Jolly nature, Aggron is faster than base 80s with Choice Scarf and a Speed boosting nature; however, it really appreciates the power from Adamant, as it secures 2HKOs on Tangrowth and Regirock, while giving Aggron a much higher chance of OHKOing Rhyperior.</p> <p>Aggron needs to focus on super effective coverage, as Head Smash is so powerful that it will do more than almost any other attack even when resisted. Aqua Tail 2HKOes Donphan and OHKOes almost every Rock- or Ground-type, which are Aggron's most common switch-ins. Low Kick 2HKOes Regirock and can KO Registeel if it switches into Stealth Rock and a Head Smash. Ice Punch can be used over Low Kick if you prefer beating Torterra, who is KOed after switching into Head Smash.</p> <p>Aggron has trouble with different Pokemon depending on what it uses in its last move slot. If Aggron uses Low Kick, Torterra will cause some serious trouble. This is easily remedied by using a Pokemon such as Venusaur to switch in and hit Torterra with a strong Sludge Bomb, or better yet, using something like Swords Dance Leafeon to set up on Torterra. If Aggron uses Ice Punch, it will have some trouble with Regirock and Registeel. Registeel is pretty easy to deal with by using a Pokemon such as Donphan or even Torterra to switch in and set up Stealth Rock. Dugtrio can come in and trap it as well. Regirock is more difficult as it hits much harder, meaning you need to carry a Pokemon with respectable defenses that resists Stone Edge and is preferably immune to Thunder Wave. Torterra and Donphan are still both good choices, but Dugtrio isn't powerful enough to trap and KO Regirock as long as it has a decent amount of HP. Using a Pokemon such as Blaziken or Arcanine to break the opponent's walls makes it a lot easier for Aggron to sweep as well, since they will weaken or KO bulky Water-types, such as Slowbro and Milotic, while possibly also taking care of Dugtrio with priority.</p> <p>Aggron definitely benefits from Spikes support as well, because it can then use a Jolly nature, making it less susceptible to Choice Scarf revenge killers. Qwilfish is a pretty good partner, being able to switch into weak Fighting-type attacks and set up. Claydol is also a great teammate, as it not only sets up Stealth Rock and screens, but it also easily takes Fighting- and Ground-type attacks.</p>"

  "Medicham": {
    "overview": "<p>Medicham's phenomenal Attack, thanks to Pure Power, decent base 80 Speed, and great offensive movepool make it a top offensive threat in the UU metagame. However, Medicham's frailty and average Speed means that it can be easily demolished by faster sweepers, especially Rotom and Mismagius, that haunt the UU tier. Much like a double-edged sword, smart playing will turn Medicham into a one-man demolition crew, 2HKOing most opposing Pokemon, but recklessness will leave you one Pokemon short and your opponent free of a major threat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Medicham can attempt to diminish its frailty by running a Bulk Up set with 200 HP / 56 Atk / 252 Spe and Recover. After a single Bulk Up, Medicham is never 2HKOed by a combination of Waterfall and Aqua Jet from maximum Attack Azumarill and still has a high enough Attack stat to 2HKO max HP Donphan and Milotic. However, Medicham rarely gets opportunities to set up due to its lack of bulk and average Speed. Substitute and Focus Punch can be used to nail opponents with a 225 Base Power attack while sparing Medicham from being KOed in an instant, but Medicham will find it difficult to consistently create Substitutes due to its low HP and slightly above-average defenses.</p> <p>Toxic is a viable option to weaken physically defensive Pokemon like Slowbro and Tangrowth that easily switch into Medicham. Rock Slide is an alternative for Ice Punch or Thunder Punch to deal with Flying-types like Moltres, Swellow, and Altaria with a decent 30% flinch rate, but the 90% accuracy may end up hurting Medicham as any of the previously mentioned Pokemon can OHKO it should Rock Slide fail to hit. Baton Pass is useful for passing Bulk Up boosts or Substitutes and scouting opposing teams for possible threats, but Medicham lacks the Speed necessary to use it effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Few Pokemon can reliably counter Medicham due to its incredible Attack. Spiritomb stands out as a counter due to its immunity to both of Medicham's STAB moves. With overall great defenses, Spiritomb can switch into any of Medicham's attacks with impunity and force it out with the threat of being KOed by Shadow Ball or Shadow Sneak. Tangrowth easily walls Medicham and can cripple it with sleep or paralysis and dispose of Medicham with Leaf Storm or Power Whip. A non-boosted High Jump Kick barely 3HKOes 252 HP / 252 Def Tangrowth even after a switch into Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Bulky Psychic-types have no trouble coming in and ruining Medicham's sweep. Slowbro resists Fighting- and Psychic-type moves, as well as Ice Punch, and with its superb Defense, can easily switch into Medicham and threaten it with STAB Surf and Psychic. However, it has to watch out for Thunder Punch and Trick, which ruin its walling capabilities. Uxie functions in the same vein as Slowbro, as it can easily withstand any attack in Medicham's repertoire due to its base 130 Defense and resistances to both of Medicham's STAB moves, as well as threaten it with Thunder Wave, Yawn, and Psychic. Offensively, Mesprit can 2HKO Medicham with Psychic or Zen Headbutt while switching in easily due to its reasonable bulk and resistances to Medicham's STABs.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>An exceptional Attack stat, along with decent Speed, makes Medicham a perfect candidate for a Choice Scarf, transforming it into a potent revenge killer and late-game sweeper. Due to Medicham's mediocre defensive stats and lack of resistances, it is best to bring it in for a revenge kill, which should prove to be a simple task as Medicham has good type coverage with its attacks to KO most opponents. From there, Medicham can muscle its way through weakened teams with its titanic Attack.</p> <p>High Jump Kick is Medicham's main attack and reaches 150 Base Power after STAB, which can OHKO many neutral targets, such as Swellow and Sceptile. Bulkier sweepers such as Leafeon and Drapion will not have an easy time against High Jump Kick either, as most are 2HKOed even without residual damage factored in. Despite this, High Jump Kick should not be used haphazardly, as it invites Ghost-types to switch in and cause Medicham to lose a significant portion of its HP. Brick Break is a weaker alternative that does not suffer from High Jump Kick's flawed accuracy and potential recoil. Psycho Cut is a good secondary STAB that allows Medicham to handle Poison-types that resist High Jump Kick, primarily Venusaur and Weezing. Most Venusaur are OHKOed, while Weezing is always 2HKOed, regardless of residual damage. Support and SubSeeder Venusaur, however, are only OHKOed with residual damage. Psycho Cut also puts a large dent in Rotom and Mismagius that try to switch into a predicted Fighting-type move. Thunder Punch and Ice Punch are for additional coverage, mainly against specific Pokemon that resist or are neutral to either of Medicham's STAB attacks. Thunder Punch assures a 2HKO on Moltres and Slowking, while Ice Punch can OHKO Gligar and Altaria and 2HKO Claydol. Trick cripples defensive Pokemon like Slowbro and Uxie that would otherwise wall Medicham, making it easier for Medicham or another team member to dispose of them.</p> <p>A Jolly nature and Choice Scarf bring Medicham's Speed to 426, which is enough to outspeed Adamant Rock Polish Torterra and Aggron after a boost. Alternatively, Medicham can use an Adamant nature to improve its chances of scoring an OHKO against threats such as Scyther and Alakazam. The loss of Speed from using an Adamant nature, however, will leave Medicham vulnerable to boosting sweepers such as Rock Polish Rhyperior, which Medicham can normally take on when using a Jolly nature.</p> <p>Since High Jump Kick scores most of Medicham's KOs, a means of handling Ghost-types is necessary to let Medicham smash through opposing teams. Therefore, a Pursuit user is an excellent teammate for Medicham, and Houndoom fits that role perfectly. Mixed Houndoom eliminates Ghost-types with ease, as its Life Orb-boosted Pursuit OHKOes Mismagius and most Rotom as they switch out, and its Sucker Punch will always KO them. Additionally, Houndoom absorbs Will-O-Wisp aimed at Medicham to gain a Flash Fire boost, which will let it weaken the opposing team with a boosted Fire-type attack, so Medicham can come in and clean up later in the match.</p> <p>Phazers help Medicham tremendously when coupled with entry hazards, as they allow you to scout opposing teams for any Ghost-types or physically defensive Pokemon that cause Medicham trouble and rack up entry hazard damage by inducing multiple switches. Specially Defensive Drapion works well for this role because it can also KO Ghost-types that it may expose with Whirlwind or wear down opposing Pokemon with Toxic Spikes so Medicham can finish them off.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>Medicham's amazing Attack, coupled with its decent Speed, make it a potent sweeper in UU. With the boost Life Orb provides, a quite extensive list of what High Jump Kick 2HKOes is created. Defensive threats, such as Milotic, will be 2HKOed if they attempt to come in on a High Jump Kick; for example, 248 HP / 252 Def Bold Milotic takes 55.2% - 65.1% damage. Low Kick is a safer option over High Jump Kick, as it has the same or greater Base Power as High Jump Kick when used against bulky Pokemon like Torterra and Donphan. However, the inconsistency in its Base Power can make more of a liability for Medicham than an asset, since Medicham will lose OHKOs that High Jump Kick would have scored against lighter Pokemon, such as Lanturn. Zen Headbutt deals with Pokemon that resist Medicham's Fighting-type STAB move, as well as having a 20% flinch rate to potentially spare Medicham from taking serious damage. Fake Out and Bullet Punch provide priority and let Medicham revenge kill weakened threats, such as Alakazam and Sceptile, with ease. Thunder Punch and Ice Punch can be used for coverage on Pokemon like Claydol or Slowbro, which resist both of Medicham's STAB attacks. Additionally, they serve as safer alternatives for High Jump Kick when used on Pokemon that are hit for super effective damage by the respective attack.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is a viable option on Medicham to ensure OHKOs on bulkier Pokemon that it still outspeeds, such as Dragon Dance Feraligatr (before the Speed boost from Dragon Dance) and Weezing. However, that will leave it unable to at least tie with many of the positive base 80 Pokemon in UU, most notably Venusaur. Since Psycho Cut is illegal alongside Bullet Punch, Zen Headbutt is the only physical Psychic-type STAB available to this Medicham set. While one can forgo Bullet Punch to use Psycho Cut, Bullet Punch is Medicham's most reliable priority move, as Fake Out only works once, and Medicham needs a reliable priority move to handle faster Pokemon.</p> <p>Medicham enjoys having entry hazards and paralysis support to sweep through opposing teams with greater ease. Registeel is a good teammate for this task as it can set up Stealth Rock, paralyze opposing Pokemon with Thunder Wave, and resists Flying- and Ghost-type attacks aimed at Medicham. Wish support is recommended to compensate for the loss of HP from Life Orb, which would leave Medicham at more risk than usual. Leafeon and Chansey are good choices due to their bulk.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>A Choice Band provides Medicham with the necessary boost to break through even the sturdiest of physical walls. High Jump Kick coming off 657 Attack can OHKO walls such as Steelix and Regirock with minimal residual damage. Even Pokemon that take neutral damage from High Jump Kick are effectively 2HKOed after a switch in; for instance, Tank Torterra is dealt a minimum of 54.2% damage. Despite this destructive power, one should be wary of Ghost-types on the opposing team, which enjoy switching into Medicham locked into High Jump Kick, causing it to lose a significant portion of its HP in the process. Brick Break is a good option to avoid the perils of High Jump Kick, but Medicham will have to settle for 2HKOs on Pokemon that it would normally OHKO with High Jump Kick. Psycho Cut deals with Pokemon that High Jump Kick or Brick Break cannot dispose of, such as Venusaur and Weezing. Thunder Punch is for Flying-types and an alternative for High Jump Kick against Water-types. Slowbro, which normally counters Medicham, takes 51.8% - 60.9% damage from Thunder Punch, making it difficult for it to wall Medicham. Ice Punch is for additional coverage alongside Thunder Punch, mainly for Ground-types like Claydol and Gligar. Trick cripples defensive threats like Uxie by ridding them of their Leftovers, and is especially useful when partnered with Brick Break, so Medicham can at least ruin an opposing wall if it cannot KO it.</p> <p>This Medicham is an asset to offensive teams that need a reliable wallbreaker. While Medicham normally appreciates an Adamant nature to boost its already phenomenal Attack stat, Jolly is necessary to tie with other positive Speed nature base 80 Pokemon like Venusaur, Blaziken, and Altaria. A Pursuit user is also necessary to ensure that Medicham can attack without the fear of Ghosts switching in. Once again, Houndoom is an excellent candidate for the position as it also absorbs Will-O-Wisp aimed at Medicham. Entry hazards help Medicham tear through bulky Pokemon much easier. Omastar is a good choice to provide this due to its access to all three entry hazards and resistance to Flying-type moves.</p>"

  "Manectric": {
    "overview": "<p>Overshadowed by the likes of Jolteon and Raikou in higher tiers, Manectric finds its niche in the UU metagame as one of the more fearsome Electric-types available. While its movepool is nothing spectacular, Manectric is one of the only Electric-type Pokemon with access to powerful Fire-type attacks, and when paired with Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Grass, Manectric gains near flawless coverage, resisted only by the rare Shelgon and Dragonair who both lack the bulk to absorb powerful special attacks. It also has access to Switcheroo, making it unique as far as Electric-type Choice users go. On the downside, poor defenses and lack of resistances means Manectric rarely finds time to switch in safely, in addition to being relatively easy to KO with priority and neutral hits from faster Pokemon. Despite these downfalls, if you play Manectric's offensive attributes to their maximum potential, you will quickly find it to be a dangerous and commonly underrated special attacker.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Modest can be used over Timid for the extra power at the loss of outspeeding base 95 Pokemon such as Houndoom and Leafeon, and tying with Mismagius and Scyther. Manectric can run a Choice Scarf set quite well, acting as a reliable revenge killer to many threats thanks to its great offensive stats. Discharge can replace Thunderbolt or take up the fourth slot to spread paralysis, although Manectric's high Speed and the need for as much power as possible generally makes it unnecessary unless your team significantly appreciates paralysis support. Manectric can fill the role of a fast Rain Dance supporter with Damp Rock, while also benefiting itself with a powerful 100% accurate Thunder and powered up Hidden Power Water. Manectric has access to some decent support moves including Roar, Light Screen, Thunder Wave, and Toxic, but it unfortunately lacks the defensive qualities to use them effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Chansey and Clefable are the most solid counters to Manectric, being able to stall it out with ease thanks to their great Special Defense and instant recovery, although they must be wary of Switcheroo from Choice sets. Specially defensive Venusaur, Torterra, Registeel, and Steelix must be careful of Overheat (and sometimes Flamethrower), but they can otherwise safely take Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Grass and retaliate with status or strong STAB attacks. Ground-types who also invest heavily in Special Defense, such as Donphan and Nidoqueen, counter Manectric well thanks to their STAB Earthquake and Electric-type immunity, and they can even handle a super effective Hidden Power or two. Arcanine is yet another specially defensive Pokemon who can counter Manectric with Morning Sun to heal and Extreme Speed for priority; however, it is 2HKOed by Timid Choice Specs Thunderbolt after Stealth Rock damage. Finally, Lanturn's Volt Absorb, resistance to Fire, access to Thunder Wave, and natural bulk makes it an excellent Manectric switch-in.</p> <p>Revenge killing with a Choice Scarf, priority moves, or naturally faster Pokemon is usually the easiest way to remove Manectric. Aqua Jet Azumarill, Mach Punch Hitmontop, and Sucker Punch Absol are examples of common priority attacks, all dealing severe damage. Swellow, Sceptile, Alakazam, and Ambipom can all outspeed and OHKO Manectric, as can Dugtrio who of course seals its fate with Arena Trap. Blaziken, Moltres and Hitmonlee are notable Choice Scarf users who can swiftly OHKO Manectric with strong STAB attacks.</p>",

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>Manectric's fantastic Speed, exceptional type coverage, and above-average Special Attack make it a natural candidate for a Life Orb set. Thunderbolt is the primary option and main draw of this set, being one of the most potent STAB attacks in the game. Flamethrower and Hidden Power Grass complement Thunderbolt well by hitting Pokemon who can safely take a hit from it; the former hits Registeel, Steelix, and Grass-types such as Venusaur and Torterra, while the latter hits Lanturn and Ground-types including Rhyperior, Claydol, and Donphan. Charge Beam rounds off the set by providing Manectric with a means of raising its Special Attack for greater offensive potential.</p> <p>Overheat is a viable alternative to Flamethrower despite lowering Special Attack, as its incredible Base Power can secure some important KOs which would otherwise be impossible with Flamethrower. For example, a combination of Thunderbolt and Overheat has a high chance of OHKOing specially defensive Venusaur after Stealth Rock damage, while Registeel takes a minimum of 78% (factoring in Leftovers recovery) when switching into Charge Beam followed by a +1 Overheat. In general, Overheat is useful for hit-and-run approaches rather than sweeping. Substitute can replace Charge Beam in the final slot to minimize prediction and protect Manectric from status and revenge killers. It will also make your opponent think twice before switching in Dugtrio in an attempt to trap and OHKO Manectric with Earthquake.</p> <p>Expert Belt is an alternative item option, as it allows Manectric to bluff a Choice item and increases its survivability. This is especially handy when running Substitute, as Life Orb's recoil in conjunction with Substitute will whittle down Manectric's health in no time. While these are good perks, Life Orb is still the superior option in most cases due to its greater power and consistency. Hidden Power Ice can be used over Hidden Power Grass to hit Altaria, Torterra, Nidoqueen, and Nidoking harder while still maintaining coverage on Ground-types; however, this allows Rhyperior, Lanturn, and Quagsire to completely stop Manectric in its tracks.</p> <p>Chansey, Clefable, and Registeel are among the most common counters to Manectric thanks to their high Special Defense and ability to cripple with status or recover health. Pokemon such as Rhyperior, Hitmonlee, and Torterra make ideal teammates for Manectric due to their Thunder Wave immunity while also appreciating the free switch-in to wreck havoc. Dugtrio is another option to handle them, being able to trap and 2HKO all three with Earthquake, which allows Manectric to sweep more easily. Specially defensive Venusaur and Torterra counter this set effectively, stalling out Life Orb's recoil with Synthesis (although they must be wary of Overheat). Likewise, specially defensive Arcanine can take Thunderbolt well, recover with Morning Sun, and hit back with Extreme Speed. Uxie, with a Ground immunity and amazing defenses to sponge priority attacks, is a valuable teammate who can also set up Stealth Rock and use Yawn + U-turn to allow Manectric to switch in safely. Weezing, Altaria, and Mesprit are similar options for this role who can also switch into the aforementioned Grass-types.</p> <p>This set definitely appreciates Spikes support. It's a highly valuable weapon to wear down all of Manectric's usual counters, turning some important 3HKOs into 2HKOs. Qwilfish can set up Spikes in the lead position for offensive momentum, while defensively Omastar can take advantage of Chansey and Registeel switch-ins for setup opportunities. Of course, this comes with the need to carry a spinblocker; Mismagius's Ground-type immunity and tendency to lure Manectric's counters makes it one of the best options. With Manectric taking Life Orb's recoil and being vulnerable to entry hazards, Rapid Spin support from Pokemon such as Donphan or Hitmontop is certainly handy to help it survive longer.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>105 base Special Attack and Speed, access to important coverage with access to important coverage moves, and Switcheroo to hinder special walls that try to sponge his attacks all enable Manectric to run a Choice Specs set well. This set is best used with a hit-and-run strategy in mind and for revenge killing. Manectric can also disrupt the opponent's strategy with Switcheroo and potentially cripple one of his or her Pokemon.</p> <p>Thunderbolt is Manectric's primary STAB attack and does serious damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Access to both Overheat and Flamethrower separate Manectric from its fellow Electric-types, as they allow him to hit Grass-, Steel-, Ice-, and Bug-type Pokemon for super effective damage. Overheat is the better option over two turns if you don't mind the Special Attack drop; however, Flamethrower is more accurate and won't drop the power of Manectric's other moves, which is relevant once you have used Switcheroo. Hidden Power Grass is used to round off Manectric's coverage by allowing him to hit 8 types for super effective damage and everything else for neutral damage. An alternative Hidden Power type could be used here if you have a special need for it on your team. Switcheroo allows Manectric to cripple potential counters, most notably Clefable, Registeel, and Chansey, by handing them Manectric's Choice Specs.</p> <p>The EVs are self-explanatory; Speed and Special Attack are maximized to make the best use of Manectric's potential, while 4 EVs are placed in Special Defense so that the rare Download Porygon2 doesn't get a Special Attack boost. Alternatively, you can run 216 Speed to outrun positive base 100 Speed Pokemon, only losing the ability to Speed tie other Manectric, Scyther, and Mismagius. This will allow you to put 32 EVs into HP, which is a Life Orb number--that is, if Manectric picks one up with Switcheroo. A Timid nature is necessary on this set, as otherwise the many positive base 95 Speed Pokemon in UU will outrun Manectric.</p> <p>Choice Specs Manectric really appreciates Rapid Spin support due to its frailness and how often it will be switching in and out. Like all sweepers, entry hazard support is also helpful for securing KOs. Claydol makes a great partner since it is immune to Manectric's Ground-type weakness, absorbs Thunder Wave, has access to Rapid Spin, and can set up Stealth Rock. Bulky Blastoise can come in on most Ground-types, threaten them with a STAB Water-type attack, and Rapid Spin entry hazards away. Blaziken is an excellent offensive partner for Manectric because it eliminates the special walls that Manectric has trouble with, while Manectric can threaten Milotic and other Water-types in return.</p>"

  "Roselia": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, many people will doubt Roselia's effectiveness in UU due to its frail physical defense, low Speed, and the existence of better Grass-types. However, if you take a closer glance at its movepool, you will find that it has a interesting variety of moves that give it its own special niche. Unlike the common Grass-types, Roselia has access to the ever-so-useful Spikes, in addition to Toxic Spikes, and the ability to absorb status with ease thanks to Natural Cure. Roselia also comes equipped with a high base 100 Special Attack, which ties with the omnipresent Venusaur. Last but not least, Roselia's usable base 80 Special Defense gives it plenty of opportunities to set up deadly entry hazards on helpless foes. As long as you abuse its niches to their fullest, Roselia can be well worth the use.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Every viable option for Roselia is mentioned in this analysis. The only moves with some use that are not given a mention are Cotton Spore and Aromatherapy. However, there is almost no need to temporarily lower an opponent's Speed with Cotton Spore when Stun Spore will permanently disable it, and Roselia cannot waste turns using Aromatherapy, especially when there are much more capable Pokemon that can use it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Roselia's low defenses and average Speed give it a disadvantage against many Pokemon. Fire-types, Flying-types, and hard-hitting Pokemon in general can easily kill it. Pokemon that set up, such as Mismagius and Swords Dance Scyther, can also easily kill it and get free turns to set up. If a Rapid Spinner manages to spin, then Roselia becomes almost dead weight, as it will be unlikely for it to re-set up its entry hazards again, given the scenarios.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Spikes": {
        "description": "<p>If your team is in need of a Pokemon that is able to set up Spikes and take on many defensive threats, Spikes Roselia may indeed be the Pokemon for you. Roselia is one of two Grass-types with access to Spikes (the other being Cacturne) and has the typing and Special Defense necessary to set up Spikes on many Pokemon. Milotic, Registeel, Chansey, Rotom, and even some Venusaur (although it may require the -2 Special Attack drop from Leaf Storm first) can all be Spiked upon with ease. If Roselia's HP drops too much, Synthesis or Leech Seed can be used to restore health, while its ability, Natural Cure, cures any status ailments afflicted upon Roselia. Stun Spore can be a huge boost for Roselia by paralyzing offensive threats, especially since there are no other viable status moves available (Sleep Powder and Spikes are illegal together). Common switch-ins to this set include Arcanine, Moltres, and Mismagius, all of which are extremely hindered and almost unusable after being paralyzed with Stun Spore. To prevent Roselia from being stopped completely by Taunt, Energy Ball is used in the last moveslot. Energy Ball also deals impressive damage to many common Rapid Spinners, including Donphan, Kabutops, and Blastoise.</p> <p>Synthesis is the preferred option over Leech Seed, as Synthesis gives Roselia a reliable recovery move that can't be blocked by immunities, missing, or Substitute. However, Leech Seed can force more switches, giving it more time to use Spikes. The decision ultimately comes down to how long you wish to keep Roselia alive. If its purpose on your team is to set up Spikes whenever possible and just sit as a filler, Leech Seed is probably the better option. However, if you want Roselia to be able to stay alive and be a decent answer to many Rapid Spinners as well as other special attackers, Synthesis is much better. The last attack should usually be Energy Ball to deal with Rapid Spinners, but Sludge Bomb is the stronger STAB attack. However, Sludge Bomb has many problems as an attacking move, allowing Pokemon such as Rhyperior to set up easily on it and giving Milotic an easier time surviving and eventually damaging Roselia.</p> <p>Shed Shell can be a somewhat useful item, as Roselia is dreadfully weak to Dugtrio. If your team relies on Spikes, Shed Shell may be a good item to use, if only to ensure Roselia's safety. 60 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Hitmontop, which sometimes might allow Roselia to finish Hitmontop off with Energy Ball before it can Rapid Spin your Spikes away. You could add to bulk and make Roselia's EV spread 252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Spe, but there is no reason to not try and take advantage of outspeeding a Rapid Spinner. Roselia could run 96 Speed EVs to outspeed Jolly 252 Speed Rhyperior, although the current spread will outspeed Adamant 252 Speed Rhyperior. The choice depends entirely on how much bulk you are willing to sacrifice. Rest can be used over either of the healing moves, giving Roselia full recovery at very low cost due to Natural Cure's status healing ability. However, it forces Roselia to switch out and back in to be useful again, giving the opponent free turns as well.</p> <p>Offensive teams truly benefit from Roselia's Spikes, as they turn many 2HKOs into OHKOs. It can also help cover many holes found in offensive teams, such as weaknesses to Registeel, Chansey, and even Rotom. However, Roselia is not much of an attacker and should not be used to keep the momentum rolling; instead, use it set up more layers of Spikes to ensure that other sweepers can clean up. Stall teams appreciate Roselia very much, as it provides a valuable check to many Pokemon that threaten stall-based Pokemon. A partner such as Milotic to take Fire-type attacks without much harm can help Roselia obtain extra turns for Spiking.</p> <p>Roselia's major issue is its general lack of stats. Being a pre-evolution, it unfortunately doesn't have the Speed and defenses to defend against many powerful Pokemon found in UU. Every Fire-type and any strong physical attacker can easily OHKO Roselia. It must also beware of Hitmontop that carry Foresight - if Roselia switches to a Ghost-type to try and block Rapid Spin, Hitmontop can use Foresight to KO them, while if Roselia stays in, it risks being taken out by Hitmontop due to its low bulk. Therefore, bulky Water-types and a double Ghost strategy can be useful. Milotic can safeguard Roselia from Fire-types with ease due to its huge special bulk, while utilizing two of either Rotom, Spiritomb, or Mismagius can help block Hitmontop's spin easily.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Spikes": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes a much more offensive approach that is still designed to set up entry hazards. Egg move limitations prevent Roselia from running certain move combinations, meaning that which form of Spikes you want to run will influence the rest of the moveset.</p> <p>Sleep Powder and Leaf Storm, both of which are illegal with Spikes and are meant to be used with Toxic Spikes, turn Roselia into a fierce weapon that can force switches, giving it even more chances to use Toxic Spikes. Leaf Storm has 210 Base Power after factoring in STAB, making Roselia a frightening threat. The last slot is saved for Sludge Bomb, which gives great neutral coverage all-around. Spikes is an alternative over Toxic Spikes for laying the hurt on every grounded Pokemon, while not being easily absorbed by Poison-types, unlike Toxic Spikes. If you opt for Spikes, then running Synthesis and Energy Ball over Sleep Powder and Leaf Storm, respectively, is a must. Synthesis gives Roselia a instant recovery move that allows for more set up time throughout a match, while Energy Ball enables Roselia to deal consistent damage overall.</p> <p>The Speed EVs allow Roselia to outspeed almost every variant of Milotic except Life Orb versions. Thanks to the Special Attack investment, Roselia can then 2HKO or OHKO Milotic, depending on entry hazards, its move (Energy Ball or Leaf Storm), and Milotic's defenses. 252 EVs in HP give Roselia survivability and the chance to still set up Spikes or Toxic Spikes against more defensive Pokemon.</p> <p>This set can be transitioned into a lead, putting slower Pokemon to sleep and then setting up Toxic Spikes early. Omastar, for example, can be put to sleep and then set up on or simply KOed. Focus Sash should be used over Leftovers in this case, protecting it from faster leads such as Moltres and putting them to sleep.</p> <p>Houndoom makes an excellent partner to Roselia, absorbing Fire-type attacks while also using Nasty Plot against sleeping opponents. As an added bonus, many of Houndoom's counters, such as Chansey, Milotic, and Blastoise, despise Toxic Spikes and Spikes. Dugtrio and Fire-types are useful for eliminating grounded Poison-types that absorb Toxic Spikes. Moltres can not only keep them at bay but also use Toxic Spikes to its advantage with a SubRoost set. An odd combination of Roselia and Venusaur can actually work well, despite their redundant typing together. Roselia will lure in the opponent's Grass/Poison-type counter (usually reserved for Venusaur) and allows you to act accordingly. Afterward, Venusaur can be brought in to set up Swords Dance or wreck opposing teams with Leaf Storm and Sludge Bomb.</p> <p>Just as Venusaur can be used as an ally, it also is Roselia's great enemy, doing a lot of damage with Life Orb Sludge Bomb or even OHKOing with Swords Dance boosted Returns. Venusaur can also take Roselia's Leaf Storms with ease and absorb Toxic Spikes. In order for Roselia to excel, Venusaur's removal must be prioritized. Other Pokemon to watch out for are faster Fire-types and other Poison-types that can absorb Toxic Spikes and resist Roselia's two STAB attacks. Mismagius is a very dangerous threat, as it is able to Taunt or set up a Substitute on Roselia and then proceed to set up Nasty Plots or Calm Minds.</p>"

  "Swalot": {
    "overview": "<p>Swalot has always been looked upon as a lesser version of Muk, as with its lower HP and Special Defense stats, along with certain key moves missing from its moveset, it is quite easy to make this mistake. However, it does have more balanced defenses and a greater supporting movepool with access to Encore, which makes it a much better mixed wall than the purple slime could ever hope to be. Although its lack of resistances make it hard to wall certain foes, the Purple Bag Pokemon is an underrated threat that can whip up a storm in UU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stockpile can be used to boost Swalot's defenses to ridiculous levels, but it is pretty outclassed by other Pokemon, and not just Muk either, in that role. Toxic can be used to help wear down bulky Pokemon into the KO range, and is especially effective against bulky Water-types. Counter can be used to screw over physical sweepers such as Donphan, but can also be used in conjunction with a Shuca Berry to net a surprise KO. Explosion can be used to try and faint something before Swalot faints itself. Curse can also replace Sludge Bomb on the RestTalk set in conjunction with a Careful nature to create a physical boosting tank.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Gastrodon and Quagsire wall the purple blob well due to their typing, but should be wary as Yawn and Toxic can cripple them. Scyther can come in on anything but Ice Beam and proceed to KO Swalot. Kabutops can use Swalot as setup fodder, but only if Swalot lacks Earthquake. Steelix and Registeel can take pretty much anything Swalot can throw at them and bring it down with Earthquake, but both should be wary of Yawn on the switch. Grumpig and Hypno are decent but they cannot take repeated Earthquakes too well.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Although Swalot has competition from Muk and Weezing as a Poison-type wall, it manages to separate itself by being the only one of the three to have access to Encore. Encore allows Swalot to effectively stop setup sweepers and certain walls from using Swalot as setup fodder. Yawn is used to effectively cripple any switch-ins, and also stops the majority of setup sweepers indifferent to Encore. Pain Split is Swalot's only way of recovering health outside of Rest, and although it is rather unreliable, Swalot's low HP stat usually makes up for this. The last moveslot is up to personal preference, although STAB Sludge Bomb is usually the better choice, Ice Beam can be used to hit dual Grass-types like Venusaur harder.</p> <p>Leftovers is basically mandatory on any wall for extra recovery, though Black Sludge can be used if Swalot is using Sticky Hold as its ability. The given EVs maximize Swalot's defensive prowess, while the small amount of HP EVs make Pain Split much more effective. The nature is chosen to complement its bulk on the special side, whilst Liquid Ooze is the preferred ability to stop SubSeeders in their tracks.</p> <p>This set highly appreciates the presence of entry hazards, as both Encore and Yawn will cause many switches when used together. Toxic Spikes are highly recommended in this case as it allows Swalot to defeat Water-types more easily. As for teammates, Swalot appreciates Pokemon that can cover both its Psychic- and Ground-type weaknesses. Slowbro is the most effective candidate against Ground-types, as it can hit back hard with STAB Surf, but Spiritomb is a better option against Psychic-types, turning those counters into setup fodder. In general, setup sweepers appreciate how Swalot can cripple other setup sweepers and walls with Encore.</p>"
      },
      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<p>Swalot has higher HP and Special Defense stats than Weezing, thus creating a niche of being a Poison-type that is bulky on both ends. These attributes allow Swalot to run a viable RestTalk set. Sludge Bomb is for STAB and allows Swalot to hit other Pokemon for a reasonable amount of damage. Earthquake is required to hit Steel-types that are immune to Swalot's STAB, and often catches many switch-ins off guard.</p> <p>Swalot walls any specially-oriented version of the versatile Venusaur 100% with this set. Leftovers is the preferred item on any wall, as it provides longetivity, although if Sticky Hold is the chosen ability, Black Sludge can be used as an alternate recovery option. The EVs give Swalot good defenses on both sides, and a Sassy nature complements this whilst allowing Swalot to have a slightly more powerful mixed moveset. Liquid Ooze is the preferred ability as it allows Swalot to wall Leech Seed users more effectively, but Sticky Hold is also effective to prevent Trick.</p> <p>This set is built for survivability, and as such, Wish support is highly recommended. Entry hazards also work well with this set as many Pokemon will be forced to switch in and out, or risk being hit by one of its high-power moves. Bulky Grass-type Pokemon such as Venusaur, Leafeon, and to a lesser extent, Meganium are effective against the Ground-types that wall Swalot. Hitmontop can defeat Steel-types such as Registeel and Steelix that like to come in on this set, and can also get rid of entry hazards with Rapid Spin, which goes a long way in adding to this set's survivability.</p>"

  "Sharpedo": {
    "overview": "<p>Sharpedo's excellent offensive stats and decent Speed make him an effective sweeper in UU. This is complemented by his decent movepool and reliable STAB moves. Sharpedo's main downfall is his awful defenses and poor defensive typing, giving him weaknesses to common Grass-type moves, as well as common Fighting-type moves like Mach Punch. This is disappointing, as Sharpedo works excellently when it's being used against crippled or weakened opponents or hiding behind a Substitute.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sharpedo has a pretty vast movepool, but most of what matters is already suggested in the sets. Super Fang is a respectable move, halving the HP of a wall who's causing problems. Agility may be useful to boost Sharpedo's Speed, allowing you to focus EVs on his offensive stats.</p> <p>Choice items may be used in place of Life Orb for more power, though this makes Sharpedo easy to predict and will force you to switch more often. This causes problems as Sharpedo's awful defenses will make it difficult to switch in, and Stealth Rock will take its toll after repeated switch-ins.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky Water-types can wall the majority of Sharpedo's attacks, barring the rare Choice Specs-boosted Hidden Power. Milotic makes light work of Sharpedo, having a resistance to his STAB Water-type moves, and taking little damage from Crunch and Dark Pulse due to her great defenses. Hidden Power Grass deals a minimum of 72% to Sharpedo even without EV investment, always scoring a 2HKO. Blastoise also takes little damage from any of Sharpedo's attacks, regardless of them being physical or special. Blastoise can use this time to support his team with Rapid Spin, or cripple Sharpedo with Yawn or Toxic. Finally, Poliwrath resists Sharpedo's Dark-type moves, whilst having has an immunity to Water-type attacks thanks to Water Absorb. Venusaur can handle most sets, though repeated hits from Ice Beam will wear him down over time. Sleep Powder can be used to cripple Sharpedo, while Energy Ball or Power Whip will OHKO him. Hitmontop is a decent counter as he can exploit Sharpedo's low Defense with his super effective priority moves. A combination of Fake Out and Mach Punch will KO Sharpedo, while his Intimidate ability will weaken Sharpedo's physical attacks.</p> <p>Chansey can handle most specially-based sets with her huge HP and good Special Defense, while she can beat Sharpedo with Seismic Toss and Soft-Boiled. Lanturn also does an excellent job at countering Sharpedo who lack Earthquake, and can hit Sharpedo with STAB Electric-type moves.</p> <p>Weezing can handle most physically-based sets with his immunity to Earthquake, huge defensive stats, and access to a variety of moves that can deal with Sharpedo. Thunderbolt will OHKO Sharpedo, while Will-O-Wisp cuts his Attack score in half. Weezing should be careful of Hydro Pump from mixed and specially-based sets, however. Cloyster can also take on any physically-based set, using his great Defense to set up entry hazards, while he can play offensively with Rock Blast or Explosion. Tangrowth is another decent choice, though his low Special Defense is an issue if Sharpedo is running some kind of mixed set.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Attacking Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Sharpedo is an effective lead in UU as he can hit the opponent with his powerful STAB attacks and proceed to finish them off with Aqua Jet. Rhyperior leads are KOed with Waterfall followed by Aqua Jet, while Crunch has a chance to 2HKO Uxie and OHKO Alakazam (or 2HKO Focus Sash versions with Crunch followed by Aqua Jet). Taunt is the best option in the final slot as it shuts down lead Cloyster, who causes problems due to his huge physical defense and his typing, which gives him a resistance to Water-type moves. Earthquake allows Sharpedo to hit Registeel, while Ice Fang deals huge damage to Altaria and Torterra switch-ins. Focus Sash is the ideal item as any attack is likely to KO Sharpedo.</p> <p>The EVs focus on Sharpedo's Attack, giving his physical moves more power. 252 Speed EVs aren't used to outrun a specific threat; they are used because Sharpedo's defenses are not worth investing in.</p> <p>Ambipom leads cause Sharpedo problems as Fake out will deal a large amount of damage, and his high Speed allows him to attack again before he can hit back; Aqua Jet is unable to KO Ambipom after he has used Fake Out, making Sharpedo easy to defeat. Spiritomb also causes Sharpedo problems as his great defenses make him take little damage from any of Sharpedo's attacks, while he can hit Sharpedo super effectively with Hidden Power Fighting and finish him off with Sucker Punch. Registeel is a decent partner for this set as it can switch into both Ambipom and Spiritomb with ease and attempt to set up with Curse, or cripple Ambipom with Thunder Wave (providing he doesn't carry Taunt). Its great defenses mean that Registeel will take reduced damage from Hidden Power Fighting, and its Steel-typing gives it a resistance to Dark-, Ghost-, and Normal-type moves. Machoke leads also cause Sharpedo problems as he hits you super effectively with Dynamic Punch and can finish Sharpedo off with Bullet Punch. Slowbro is an excellent choice to deal with Machoke leads due to his Own Tempo ability and high defensive stats; his Psychic-typing also gives him a resistance to Dynamic Punch.</p>"

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Sharpedo's excellent Attack and decent movepool, which make him a powerful physical sweeper in UU. Waterfall is the most important move on this set, dealing massive damage to Pokemon like Donphan, Regirock, and Moltres. Crunch is used as secondary STAB, hitting Psychic- and Ghost-types like Slowbro and Rotom super effectively. Earthquake is used to hit Steel-types like Registeel and Magneton, while dealing more damage to Aggron than Waterfall would. The final slot is down to personal preference; Substitute is the best option if you choose to use a Life Orb as it protects Sharpedo from status and critical hits, while also covering his awful defenses. Ice Fang may be used to hit Altaria and Torterra with more power, and Zen Headbutt deals more damage to the likes of Venusaur and Hitmontop.</p> <p>252 Attack EVs are used on this set to deal maximum damage with his attacks, while 252 Speed EVs are used to tie with positive base 95 Pokemon. Sharpedo is so frail that it isn't worth investing in his defenses. When using a Choice Band, an Adamant nature is recommended to deal as much damage as possible over a single turn, though Jolly can be used to outrun the likes of Rotom and tie with positive-natured Drapion and Houndoom.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types cause problems for this set as Sharpedo is unable to hit the majority of them super effectively. Problems arise when facing Blastoise, Milotic, and Cloyster. Venusaur is an excellent partner for Sharpedo as he can switch into these threats with ease thanks to his immunity to Toxic and resistance to Water-type attacks. Venusaur can proceed to Sleep Powder or Swords Dance and sweep. Venusaur is also helpful as he absorbs Toxic Spikes, a common move on Cloyster. Torterra is another option as STAB Wood Hammer mauls the likes of Slowbro and Milotic; though he should watch out for Ice Beam. Support from Toxic Spikes is helpful as it cripples bulky walls who attempt to stop Sharpedo's sweep. These include Leafeon, Tangrowth, and non-RestTalk Spiritomb. Drapion is an excellent choice to set up Toxic Spikes due to his excellent typing and decent defensive stats. Qwilfish is another great choice as he can act as a suicide lead and explode on the opponent, giving Sharpedo a safe switch in.</p> <p>Pokemon with priority moves-such as Hitmontop, Absol, and Scyther-cause big problems for Sharpedo as his defenses are horrible. Donphan is a good teammate to cover this, as he takes little damage from common priority moves in UU, can set up Stealth Rock, remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin, and hit incoming Ghosts with Assurance. He also has access to Ice Shard, dealing huge damage to Scyther, and Earthquake coming from base 120 Attack will hit anyone who doesn't resist it for serious damage.</p>"

Although this seems inferior to a physical or mixed set, this set carries surprise value, and his special movepool is equally as impressive as his physical movepool. Surf and Hydro Pump act as reliable STAB, both dealing exceptional damage to the likes of Moltres, Regirock, and Donphan. Surf is the most reliable option as Sharpedo's defenses are so horrible that he cannot afford to miss an attack; however, Hydro Pump can OHKO standard Regirock after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes have taken their toll. Ice Beam allows Sharpedo to hit Altaria, Torterra, and Tangrowth super effectively, scoring an OHKO on each. Hidden Power Grass is used to deal with Slowbro, Milotic, and Quagsire. The final slot is down to personal preference, though Substitute is recommended when you use a Life Orb due to Sharpedo's weak defenses. Dark Pulse can be used as secondary STAB, hitting Ghosts like Rotom, as well as Psychic-types like Uxie. Using an Expert Belt in place of Life Orb is an option as it helps Sharpedo bluff a Choice item, which can lure an opponent into thinking they are safe when switching into Sharpedo when they are not.</p> <p>252 Special Attack EVs ensure that Sharpedo's attacks deal as much damage as possible, and 252 Speed EVs along with a Timid nature allow Sharpedo to outrun the likes of Rotom and tie with positive-natured Drapion and Houndoom. The choice between a Timid and Modest nature depends on whether you wish for more Speed or more power.</p> <p>Due to his lack of a physical move, this set encounters problems with special walls like Chansey. There are numerous ways to deal with Chansey, the first being a mixed sweeper acting as a lure with special attacks. Magmortar is an excellent option as he can bluff a Choice item with Expert Belt and 2HKO Chansey with Cross Chop. Another way to beat Chansey is to use a Mismagius with Taunt and Nasty Plot. After three Nasty Plot boosts, Mismagius can 2HKO Chansey with Hidden Power Fighting. Registeel will also cause problems as Sharpedo is unable to 2HKO it with Choice Specs Hydro Pump, while Registeel can cripple him with Thunder Wave and finish him off with Iron Head. Nidoking is a great choice to beat Registeel as he can switch into Thunder Wave for free due to his Ground typing and threaten Registeel with STAB Earthquake or Earth Power. Rhyperior and Donphan are also excellent choices as they can switch into any of Registeel's attacks and hit it with STAB Earthquake.</p> <p>To ensure an OHKO against Regirock, Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes is required. Omastar is a fine choice for this role as it has a huge Defense, allowing it to set up against physical threats such as Scyther and Arcanine, while scaring away common Rapid Spinners like Donphan and Claydol with STAB Surf. Another way to set up entry hazards is to use a dedicated Spikes user like Cloyster or Qwilfish along with a defensive partner like Chansey or Donphan with Stealth Rock.</p>"

  "Wailord": {
    "overview": "<p>Wailord is one of the most underrated threats in the UU metagame. At a glance, it seems to have lackluster base defenses, even with its enormous base 170 HP, and only passable base offenses, which are further hindered by Wailord's low base Speed stat of 60. However, if you take a closer look, it becomes clear that Wailord does actually have a niche in the UU metagame; its access to Water Spout, a powerful 150 Base Power move that is dependent on the user's HP at the time of use, allows Wailord to act as a destructive special attacker. By simply spamming Water Spout, Wailord can become a dangerous offensive threat to any team not prepared for it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aside from the sets given, there aren't many other options that Wailord can effectively run, as it lacks a proper base stat distribution to run any other types of offensive or defensive roles on a team. RestTalk sets can be utilized to an extent, but as Wailord's base defenses are quite mediocre, the viability of this set is questionable. Likewise, a Curse set can be used, but it would be quite ineffective due to Wailord's poor Special Defense. Due to Wailord's 90 base Attack and access to a great physical movepool consisting of Waterfall, Earthquake, Double-Edge, Avalanche, and Self-Destruct, a physical moveset with Choice Band or Life Orb can be an option to surprise your foes. However, the damage output will be overall lower than the standard special sets. Lastly, a special Life Orb set can be utilized with Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, Hidden Power Grass, and Self-Destruct, as well as a Naive nature. This set has the niche advantage of switching between attacks while applying pressure on your opponent, but it lacks the Speed and ability to properly use Water Spout.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Anything that can outpace Wailord and has a decent amount of offensive prowess can generally beat Wailord as long as they switch into the right attack. Examples of such Pokemon include Sceptile, Scyther, and even Blaziken. Bulky Water-types like Milotic and Lanturn have a field day when facing Choiced Wailord, as they resist half of Wailord's moveset and can wear down the whale with their own attacks. Ludicolo also spells trouble for Wailord due to its 4x resistance to Water, neutrality to Ice Beam and Hidden Power, and ability to OHKO Wailord with Energy Ball. Likewise, bulky Grass-types like Venusaur and Leafeon are great checks to Wailord due to their key resistances and immense bulk, although the aforementioned Grass-types must beware of repeated Ice Beams from Wailord. Toxicroak deserves a special mention thanks to its ability to absorb Water-type attacks, resistance to Hidden Power Grass, and access to boosting moves that can take advantage of Wailord's switch-out. Lastly, if Wailord is at low health, a large array of Pokemon can easily set up on it once Water Spout's power has been significantly reduced.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>As one of Wailord's biggest setbacks is its mediocre base Speed stat, running a Choice Scarf set in order to remedy the aforementioned problem is a logical choice, allowing Wailord to act as a great revenge killer or even a late-game sweeper. Water Spout is Wailord's strongest attack that can dent any Pokemon bar Chansey, specially defensive Water- and Grass-types, and Pokemon immune to Water-type attacks. Hydro Pump is used as a secondary form of STAB since, if Wailord is low on HP, Water Spout's Base Power will decrease. Surf can be utilized over Hydro Pump if you value accuracy over power. The third moveslot depends on what foes you want Wailord to specifically revenge kill; Ice Beam hits Flying- and Grass-types, like Altaria and Venusaur, while Hidden Power Grass takes care of bulky Water-types, like Lanturn and Milotic. Finally, Self-Destruct allows Wailord to go out with a bang after it has served its purpose on its team.</p> <p>A Naive nature is recommended over a Timid nature as it boosts Wailord's Speed without decreasing Self-Destruct's power. 228 Speed EVs allow Wailord to outpace Pokemon with up to base 110 Speed stat. Special Attack is maximized to peak the power of Wailord's special attacking moves, and the rest of the EVs are put into Attack in order to slightly power up Self-Destruct. If you wish, you can use Hidden Power Grass or Ice Beam over Self-Destruct for greater coverage. If you decide to go with this, then use a Timid nature with the extra EVs put into a different stat, preferably Defense or Special Defense (but not HP).</p> <p>This set appreciates Pokemon that can remove special walls, such as Clefable, Chansey, and Milotic, with ease. Although Self-Destruct is available to dent the walls, it is not a reliable tool, especially when Wailord has a Choice Scarf. Thus, Fighting-types, most notably Toxicroak, are great partners to Wailord as they can eliminate most of the special walls with their powerful physical attacks. Toxicroak is immune to Toxic, has Dry Skin to absorb Milotic's Surf, and Swords Dance to smash through the opposition. Hitmonlee can also be considered due to its immunity to Thunder Wave and high Special Defense.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>With the use of Choice Specs, Wailord's special attacks will become insanely powerful. Water Spout can 2HKO even the most defensive of Pokemon, such as Clefable, as well as inflict large amounts of damage to other considerably bulky Pokemon. Hidden Power Grass allows Wailord to dent Water-types such as Milotic, Blastoise, and Lanturn, which would otherwise wall Wailord. Ice Beam further complements Wailord's moves by blasting through Grass-types like Venusaur and Leafeon. The last move comes down to personal preference; Surf (or Hydro Pump) can be used as an alternative to Water Spout if Wailord gets low on health, although Self-Destruct allows Wailord to potentially take down a foe with it after it has peaked its usefulness in a battle.</p> <p>The EVs maximize Wailord's offensive prowess while simultaneously making it significantly bulky in order to lengthen a potential sweep. Also, note that if you opt for Self-Destruct on the set, moving a couple of EVs from either defenses to Attack would be a good choice. For instance, 108 Attack EVs guarantee an OHKO on Chansey. Due to Wailord's low Speed, it's highly recommended that you utilize Trick Room support, as without it, Wailord will fall before it can even attempt a sweep. Good Trick Room partners to consider include Claydol and Exeggutor, as both can use Explosion to bring in Wailord with ease. However, if you want to use Wailord outside of Trick Room support, you can run a faster EV spread with a Timid or Naive nature, although this approach is not recommended due to the fact that without it, Wailord will become more susceptible to faster attacks than it already is.</p> <p>Since all forms of entry hazards will slowly diminish Wailord's most powerful attack, you will find it very useful to include a Rapid Spinner on your team. Donphan is a great choice as not only can it provide Rapid Spin support, but it also shares great type synergy with Wailord. As much as Wailord hates entry hazards set up by the opponent, it loves entry hazards set up by your teammates, since oftentimes the residual damage collected allows Wailord to more efficiently do its job. Although rarely seen, Defensive Spikes Cacturne is one of the best Spikers to use alongside Wailord due to its resistances to Electric- and Grass-type attacks. Alternatively, you can opt for Nidoqueen to set up Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes. Also, Wish support can help preserve Wailord's health throughout a battle, which is important to keep Water Spout's Base Power as high as possible. Lastly, any Pokemon that can deal with the ever-so-troublesome Water- and Grass-types make great offensive partners to Wailord; Sceptile and Registeel are both prime examples of such Pokemon, which share great offensive synergy with Wailord.</p>"

  "Camerupt": {
    "overview": "<p>Camerupt arduously competes with fellow Fire-types in almost every role, but it is greatly let down by its terrible Speed, defensive stats, and 4x weakness to Water. However, unlike most other Fire-types, Camerupt can alleviate its Speed issues with Rock Polish, which together with its powerful STABs makes it a very intimidating offensive threat. That same Speed stat also allows it to thrive in an environment that no other UU Fire-type can survive in: Trick Room. With effective methods to overcome his Speed, an immunity Electric-type attacks, and a vast offensive movepool, which includes Explosion, unique dual STABs, and great attacking stats on both ends, Camerupt can make for a solid Pokemon on any team that is willing to support it, despite its shortcomings.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Camerupt's movepool is quite large, and he has many options to choose from. In terms of other STAB moves, Flamethrower, Eruption, and Lava Plume are decent substitutes to Fire Blast, each having their own ups and downs; however, Fire Blast is generally the best for sweeping due to its perfect blend of power and reliability. Sunny Day augments Fire Blast, weakens Water-type attacks, and also makes the powerful Solar Beam viable, but requires a turn of set up that is hard to find with Camerupt's defenses, not to mention the coverage you may lose depending on what you replace with it. Speaking of set-up, Camerupt also has access to Charm, Stockpile, and Amnesia, which could help it survive longer, as well as Howl to boost his Attack. Finally, Toxic can be used to disrupt  regular switch-ins to Camerupt, especially bulky Water-types, since its STABs are usually enough to send any Steel- or Poison-type running. However, keep in mind that running any of these support moves will result in lost coverage that Camerupt really can't afford.</p> <p>Outside of the above sets, there are many other viable ones that Camerupt can run, but there it faces uphill competition from his fellow Fire-types, who simply have better stats. A special Choice set with STAB Eruption is viable, but Typhlosion can pull this off better. Going physical, Camerupt will have Arcanine and Blaziken, both of which get the powerful Flare Blitz, to grapple with. On the defensive supporter route, Camerupt will have to go up against higher defenses, instant recovery, and trials such as Arcanine's Intimidate, or the awesome pallet of resistances brought forth by Moltres. Camerupt isn't completely outclassed in these aspects as he does have that valuable Electric immunity, as well as neutrality and access to Stealth Rock, but in most cases, you're better off using the aforementioned Fire-types in these roles.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Camerupt's sweeper sets are incredibly versatile and very deadly. With Explosion, there are technically no safe switch-ins to them; prediction could work around Camerupt, but this is far from reliable. Instead, removing it with strong priority gives it the best chances to not do anything; Aqua Jet will quickly send even Solid Rock Camerupt smashing into the ground, and so will boosted Fake Outs and Sucker Punches. Faster Choice Scarf users such as Primeape are also great, easily knocking out Rock Polish Camerupt with their powerful STAB attacks.</p> <p>Camerupt will have a hard time getting past certain Pokemon depending on the attack that it doesn't have. Bulky Water-types can handle Camerupt when it is without Explosion, as they are not OHKOed by anything else it may carry (except Solar Beam), and can retaliate with Surf for an assured KO. Altaria and Moltres can deal with those without a boosted Hidden Power Ice or Stone Edge, and Chansey can wall any Camerupt without Explosion or Earthquake.</p> <p>Setting up on Camerupt is an easy way of making your opponent regret using him. Bulky Dragon Dance Altaria is perfect, as it resists almost all of Camerupt's movepool and can block any status with Safeguard before setting up Dragon Dances with impunity, using its natural bulk and Roost to shrug off anything but a boosted Hidden Power Ice. Milotic can come in on any move bar Explosion, sponge status with Marvel Scale, and swiftly KO any Camerupt with STAB attacks, making it another excellent check.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to help Camerupt solve its Speed issues through the use of Rock Polish, which doubles it to respectable levels. Though this set may seem outclassed by Agility Blaziken, who has a higher Speed stat to work with and can split offensive EVs to cover more threats, Camerupt has a wonderful Electric-type immunity, and by extension, an immunity to Thunder Wave, which gets it some setup opportunities that Blaziken would not, as well as access to Explosion to make sure nothing is ever safe switching into it.</p> <p>Rock Polish is the crux of the set as it doubles Camerupt's otherwise horrific Speed stat, allowing it to outspeed the majority of UU. Fire Blast is Camerupt's most powerful attack on the special side, and it deals massive damage to anything that doesn't resist it, bar Chansey, and also hits Registeel, another prominent special wall in UU, super effectively. Earth Power is a strong secondary STAB that deals with opposing Rock- and Fire-types that resist Fire Blast, while also hitting Water-types for neutral damage. Explosion is recommended for the final slot as without it, Chansey completely and utterly walls Camerupt. However, by running Stone Edge, Camerupt will have less trouble against Moltres and Altaria. The choice all comes down to what your team can deal with better.</p> <p>216 Speed EVs are used in order to outspeed everything up to positive-natured base 105s after a Rock Polish. After that, Special Attack is maximized so that Camerupt can deal as much damage as possible with his STAB attacks. The remaining EVs go into Attack for an added oomph on Explosion. Maximizing Speed is an option to outspeed Swellow after a Rock Polish, but then Camerupt will lose the guaranteed OHKO on Milotic with Explosion. A Rash nature is preferred in order to take priority attacks, which are mostly physical, more easily, but Mild may be used to take advantage of Camerupt's slightly higher defensive stat.</p> <p>Depending on the final moveslot, Pokemon that either benefit from the removal of bulky Water-types or check them effectively make great partners to Camerupt. Water- and Grass-types in general fit these roles perfectly, and also synergise very well with Camerupt. Stealth Rock supporters and Pokemon that can check the stronger priority users of UU make great partners for this set. Uxie is a fine example of such a Pokemon, and can also come in for free on Ground-type attacks that threaten Camerupt.</p>"
      },
      "Trick Room Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Camerupt is the only Fire-type in UU that can effectively abuse Trick Room, thanks to its impressive mixed attacking stats, wide movepool, and most importantly, its low Speed. With minimum Speed, Camerupt will move before even base 30s that run hindering natures under Trick Room. This information becomes especially useful when the nearest viable competitor Camerupt has is Blaziken, who sits at base 80, and so can't even go lower than the many UU Pokemon that lurk around the base 55 range. With Camerupt's Speed issues solved, his offensive prowess skyrockets, and it becomes very dangerous.</p> <p>Fire Blast and Earth Power are Camerupt's most effective and stable STAB options, and together are only resisted in standard UU by Altaria and Moltres, both of which are KOed by Stone Edge with Stealth Rock support. Hidden Power Ice and Rock Slide may be used over Stone Edge if the accuracy is an issue for you, but the former will be useless against Moltres while the latter has much less power. With Explosion, Camerupt becomes an excellent lure for bulky Water-types, as it can OHKO even the bulkiest of them with it. Earthquake is a very practical replacement though, 2HKOing many of the special walls in the tier, including Chansey, without the need to sacrifice Camerupt. However, without Explosion, Camerupt is effectively walled by the aforementioned bulky Water-types and will need proper team support to deal with them.</p> <p>Since Camerupt does not have to worry about its Speed on this set, both attacking stats are maximized to give Camerupt the muscle to obtain many important KOs, with the remaining EVs going into HP. Attack EVs can be siphoned into HP for some added bulk, but this is not advisable as Camerupt really doesn't have that much natural bulk to play with, and would rather have those EVs added to his strong points.</p> <p>Reliable users of Trick Room are important teammates for this Camerupt to excel. Slowbro is able to set it up reliably, and also has decent synergy with Camerupt, capable of switching in on the Water-type moves that plague him, while it can come in for free on Electric-type attacks aimed at Slowbro. Other than that, the usual other Trick Room supporters such as Uxie and Mesprit work just fine. Stealth Rock is very useful for Camerupt, guaranteeing OHKOs on such Pokemon as 252/0 Donphan and 4/0 Mismagius with Fire Blast, as well as 252/216+ Altaria with Hidden Power Ice or Stone Edge. Unfortunately, reliable users of Stealth Rock that also pair up well with Camerupt are hard to find, as many of them share similar typings, and thus, common weaknesses. Torterra works well though, as its part Grass typing complements Camerupt's Fire typing nicely. Depending on the choice for the final moveslot, Pokemon that benefit from the removal of bulky Water-types (such as Rhyperior), or those who can check them (such as Ampharos) also pair up well with Camerupt. Water- and Grass-types in general can perform these roles admirably, and synergise nicely with Camerupt as well.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<p>While a specially-based Camerupt is much less affected by common factors such as Intimidate, physically-based Camerupt has a number of advantages to its name as well, such as a stronger Explosion and less trouble dealing with Altaria, Clefable, and Chansey. Camerupt still has perks over Blaziken in its Electric-type immunity and access to Explosion, but it is recommended to choose which offensive side to base Camerupt on, which depends on what Pokemon can better deal with these walls.</p> <p>Once again, Rock Polish is the basis of the set, allowing Camerupt to outspeed much of UU after a single turn of setup. Earthquake is the main STAB move here, packing quite the punch with the investment, 2HKOing most of the special walls in the tier, most notably Chansey, while STAB Fire Blast covers many of the Pokemon that give other physical Speed boosters trouble, namely Leafeon, Steelix, and Tangrowth. Explosion is recommended in the final slot to separate Camerupt from Blaziken by giving him a way to deal with Water-types, of which even the bulkiest are KOed, but Stone Edge may be used to hit Altaria and Moltres without having to resign Camerupt for the rest of the match.</p> <p>The likeness of the EVs to the special Rock Polish set is not very surprising seeing as how both are attempting to boost their Speed and then sweep. The EVs maximize Attack, and provide sufficient Speed for Camerupt to outspeed positive-natured base 105s after a Rock Polish. The rest go into Special Attack for added power on Fire Blast, increasing the chance of outright OHKOing common physically defensive Grass- and Steel-types. A Naughty nature is preferred, as priority will otherwise be a tremendous hindrance to Camerupt's sweep, but Lonely may be used so as not to lower Camerupt's higher defensive stat.</p> <p>Camerupt's perfect partners always stay the same. Depending on the final moveslot, Pokemon that either benefit from the removal of bulky Water-types or can check them well make great partners to Camerupt. Water- and Grass-types in general are able to fulfill these roles quite well, and also synergise very well with Camerupt. Stealth Rock supporters and Pokemon that can check the stronger priority users such as Uxie are great teammates, especially if they are immune to or resist Ground.</p>"

  "Grumpig": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Grumpig seems outclassed by its fellow Psychic-types, it does have some advantages over them; Grumpig has higher Special Attack than Uxie, while Thick Fat allows it to take on Fire- and Ice-types much more easily, which is especially helpful as UU is filled with Pokemon such as Moltres, Blaziken, and Arcanine. Grumpig also has decent Speed, and excellent Special Defense and HP. This makes it a great supporter, which is further reinforced by its support movepool, which includes moves such as Taunt, Heal Bell, Reflect, and Light Screen. Unfortunately, Grumpig's average Defense doesn't help its Pursuit weakness at all, and its lack of recovery outside of Rest is disappointing. Overall, Grumpig is a decent defensive Pokemon, making it usable on stall teams and those with plenty of entry hazards.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Grumpig can use RestTalk to remedy its lack of recovery, though it's pretty unreliable considering the number of weaknesses Grumpig has to common moves. Counter is an interesting option and allows Grumpig to take on many physical attackers, especially Fighting-types, by hitting them back twice as hard. On the special side, Grumpig may use Mirror Coat to bounce back powerful hits such as Mismagius's Shadow Ball. Utilizing a ParaFusion set may be tempting with Confuse Ray and Thunder Wave, though it's pretty luck-based and very risky. Finally, Grumpig may use Trick Room along with a Quiet or Sassy nature, obtaining a Speed stat of 148, slow enough to outrun most of UU under Trick Room conditions, especially since it has the defenses to take an attack while setting up, and support the team afterwards.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Chansey, Clefable, and Registeel are by far the best counters for Grumpig; they all have high Special Defense, many support moves to cripple Grumpig, and two of them have reliable recovery moves. They'd better watch out for Grumpig with Trick or Choice Specs Focus Blast though; using Stealth Rock is an easy way to see if Grumpig doesn't have Leftovers, so be wary of Trick. Dark-types, particularly Spiritomb, also make excellent counters as they have an immunity to Psychic, good Special Defense, and powerful STAB moves, such as Sucker Punch and Pursuit. Drapion is another good choice as it can set up Toxic Spikes, or shut down Grumpig with Taunt; Skuntank is also a good, uncommon counter. Almost any Pokemon with good Special Defense and access to a super effective attack can take on Grumpig. Just watch out for Choice sets, as Choice Specs boosted attacks may hurt.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Grumpig makes an excellent support Pokemon. Its good defenses, Thick Fat ability, and decent movepool are the main selling points. Heal Bell turns Grumpig into a good cleric, healing dangerous status, such as poison and burn, from its teammates; the second slot gives Grumpig its own status to play with, crippling the opponent with paralysis or poisoning them with Toxic. Reflect helps Grumpig compensate for its lower Defense stat, aiding it against Pursuit users, such as Absol and Spiritomb, while Magic Coat helps Grumpig bounce back status moves and other damaging moves like Leech Seed. Finally, Grumpig should use Psychic in the last slot to cover itself against Taunt users, though a lot of them will be Dark-types. Psychic also acts as STAB, hitting the likes of Venusaur and Toxicroak super effectively.</p> <p>This Grumpig is EVed as defensively as possible; 252 HP and 176 Special Defense EVs ensure that Grumpig survives a Fire Blast followed by two Air Slashes from Timid Moltres 100% of the time. The remaining EVs are placed into Defense, giving Grumpig some much needed physical bulk, which helps against Pursuit users.</p> <p>This Grumpig needs to survive as long as possible to support its teammates, and without its own recovery, it needs extra Wish support. Chansey and Clefable are excellent choices due to their high HP and Special Defense, along with great support moves to cripple the opponent. Leafeon and Espeon are other good choices, as they both have access to Baton Pass, allowing them to escape the battle while passing any boosts too. Using Espeon is a little risky, however, as it shares the same typing with Grumpig, and thus the same weaknesses.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Grumpig's good HP, Thick Fat ability, and decent defenses make it a fine Calm Mind user. Calm Mind boosts its already high Special Defense, while the Special Attack boosts turn it into a dangerous sweeper. Substitute is a great move, blocking harmful status such as poison and burn, and Grumpig's Substitutes are difficult to break by special attackers after a few Calm Minds. Psychic is used for reliable STAB, and when paired with Signal Beam, it covers most types in UU barring Steel. Hidden Power Fighting can be used in the last slot instead of Signal Beam to cover Steel-types, but only if you don't mind losing to Psychic-types like Uxie. Focus Blast may also be used in the last slot, and although the lower accuracy is a turn-off, it does have the advantage of not lowering Grumpig's Speed IV that Hidden Power Fighting does.</p> <p>The EVs ensure that Grumpig ties with positive natured Venusaur and Blaziken, but remember that if you use Hidden Power Fighting you miss out on that chance by one point. Max HP is used for making sturdy Substitutes, and making Grumpig as bulky as possible. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense for more bulk. You may try 252 Special Attack EVs over HP, though it makes Grumpig much more frail. Taunt may be used over Substitute in this case, as the Substitutes will be much easier for the opponent to break. Shadow Ball is another alternative to use on this set in place of Psychic, and it gives perfect coverage alongside Hidden Power Fighting, though the loss of STAB isn't recommended.</p> <p>Depending on what move is in the last slot, you'll need partners to help with type coverage; when using Signal Beam, Grumpig is vulnerable to Steel-types, and when using Hidden Power Fighting, Grumpig is unable to hit other Psychic-types. If Signal Beam is used, Fire-types such as Blaziken or Moltres should be on hand to blast through troublesome Steel-types, and if you decide to use Hidden Power Fighting, Dark-types like Spiritomb and Drapion are a good way to get past other Psychic-types.</p> <p>Due to Grumpig's specially-inclined nature, Chansey and Clefable are major problems for this set; Fighting-types, such as Blaziken, Hitmonlee, and Hariyama, are therefore great partners, as they can KO the aforementioned Pokemon with ease thanks to their STAB moves. Dugtrio is another excellent partner as it can trap the likes of Chansey, Clefable, and Registeel with its ability, and then proceed to KO them with STAB Earthquake. Dugtrio also makes short work of Houndoom and Drapion, both of whom are very dangerous foes for Grumpig to face.</p> <p>Dark-types in general are problematic, especially Spiritomb with its massive defenses, lack of weaknesses, and access to super effective moves such as Sucker Punch and Pursuit. The best way to defeat Spiritomb is to cripple it and wear it down slowly. This is easily achieved with Toxic Spikes, and the best Pokemon to set them up are Drapion and Qwilfish. Fire-types like Blaziken also do a decent job at tackling Spiritomb as they have an immunity to Will-O-Wisp, and Blaziken takes reduced damage from Dark-type attacks as it's part Fighting-type. Blaziken can scorch Spiritomb with STAB Fire Blast or Flare Blitz for an easy KO.</p>"

      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>This set makes the most of Grumpig's decent defenses, Thick Fat ability, and access to both of the dual screens. Reflect and Light Screen allow Grumpig to support its teammates by giving them an easier setup. Heal Bell also helps with supporting teammates by removing harmful status such as poison, burn, and sleep; this then makes a RestTalker a good choice for your team as it can then be woken up quickly. Alternatively, Thunder Wave or Toxic can be used in the last slot to spread status and cripple the opponent's team; any Spiritomb switching in certainly won't like being poisoned. Psychic is mainly used as filler and gives Grumpig something to do should it be Taunted, though this slot can be switched with Signal Beam to hit the Dark- and Psychic-types who will likely be switching in. Taunt may also be used to cripple slow set-up sweepers, such as Clefable and Slowking, as well as walls that attempt to lay entry hazards or spread status like Registeel. Light Clay is the item of choice as it prolongs the number of turns you will have screens on the field.</p> <p>The EVs on this set focus on Grumpig's good Special Defense and above average HP. The remaining EVs are placed into Speed, which allows Grumpig to outrun positive natured Rhyperior, who will usually be swichting in on a predicted Thunder Wave and an opportunity to pierce Grumpig with Megahorn. Grumpig may also run a Timid nature with a faster spread of 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe. This allows Grumpig to set up the dual screens quickly, tying with all base 80 Pokemon like Venusaur and Blaziken, who can't deal a lot of damage to Grumpig anyway.</p> <p>Setup sweepers make excellent partners for this set as they can exploit the boosted defenses that the dual screens provide while they set up stat boosts. Dragon Dance Altaria is a fantastic choice for a teammate as it already has high defenses, and its decent typing grants it an immunity to Ground-type moves and resistances to Water-, Grass-, and Fighting-type moves. Scyther is another great option as the dual screens help it set up more easily, and after a single Swords Dance it becomes a fearsome sweeper, capable of tearing the opponent's team apart if they lack a Steel-type. Finally, Mismagius is another great choice as it can set up Nasty Plot behind the dual screens, and has enough power to 2HKO Chansey with +6 Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <p>As Grumpig lacks its own recovery outside of Rest, support from Wish users is very welcomed. Chansey and Clefable are two excellent options; they are able to switch into a variety of special attackers with their high HP and Special Defense, cripple the opponent with status, and support Grumpig with Wish. Leafeon is another good option as it has much higher Speed and access to Baton Pass; Leafeon may also pass Swords Dance boosts to other teammates as well.</p>"

      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>With a Choice item equipped, Grumpig turns into a potent threat and revenge killer; utilize Trick to cripple walls and setup sweepers like Clefable. Psychic is Grumpig's most powerful STAB move and hits Fighting- and Poison-types, such as Hariyama and Toxicroak, super effectively. Shadow Ball and Focus Blast provide perfect type coverage, hitting everything in UU for at least neutral damage; you may use Hidden Power Fighting instead of Focus Blast for its higher accuracy, though the drop in power isn't usually worth it. Modest Choice Specs Grumpig can 2HKO Tank Registeel with Focus Blast, and 3HKO Chansey.</p> <p>Grumpig's attacks will leave huge dents in the opponent's walls and make them vulnerable to other special sweepers. Mismagius makes a good partner for this reason as it can really take advantage of any holes in the opponent's team. With a weakened Registeel and Chansey, Mismagius's chances of sweeping are much higher, and after setting up with Nasty Plot, it has a chance to 2HKO Chansey with Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <p>As this set uses Choice items, you may wish to use a scout Pokemon to ease prediction, and keep Grumpig for late-game sweeping. Pokemon with U-turn and Baton Pass make good choices to reveal the opponent's team and force switches; Scyther and Swellow are excellent users of U-turn, while Espeon and Mr. Mime are excellent Baton Passers, even if they aren't passing any stat boosts.</p> <p>Specially defensive walls like Chansey and Milotic are difficult to get past, though none of them appreciate being Tricked a Choice item, or being hit with multiple Choice-boosted attacks for that matter. Fighting-types, like Hitmonlee and Hariyama, can break through Normal- and Steel-types like Chansey and Registeel, while bulky Grass-types can wear down Milotic with Leech Seed or even KO it with Leaf Storm. Toxic Spikes are also helpful for wearing down walls; Drapion, Qwilfish, and Nidoqueen are great choices to set up Toxic Spikes due to their bulk, or in Qwilfish's case, its high Speed. Toxic Spikes are also handy for wearing down Spiritomb, who is a major threat to this set's success. Chansey can be trapped by Dugtrio's Arena Trap ability, and it is KOed by Dugtrio's STAB Earthquake. Chansey may also be beaten by Taunt Mismagius with Nasty Plot, as it is 2HKOed by +6 Hidden Power Fighting. Finally, Fire-types can take on Spiritomb thanks to their immunity to Will-O-Wisp; Blaziken is one of the best for the job as it also sports a resistance to Dark-type attacks. These Pokemon can then proceed to blast Spiritomb with their powerful STAB moves.</p>"

Putting that ugly face behind a Substitute will surely make your opponent happy, since they won't have to look at it; however, they are actually in for a nasty surprise. From there Spinda can use either Teeter Dance or Body Slam. Spinda's Attack is so awful that confusing its opponent is sometimes its best way of damaging them; this is where Teeter Dance comes in. Then, Spinda can use its paper body to slam the opponent with Body Slam, betting on the 30% chance of paralysis. Spinda can then Substitute, if needed, hoping for some parafusion. After the opponent is both paralyzed and confused, they will only be able to attack you three-eighths of the time, while Spinda is safely behind its Substitute. Spinda can then fire off Rock Slide, which has an additional 30% chance of causing the opponent to flinch.

  "Cacturne": {
    "overview": "<p>Few Pokemon are more frustrating to face than Cacturne. As a Swords Dance sweeper with STAB Sucker Punch and base 115 Attack, it would already be sufficiently threatening, but throw in a 20% chance to evade any attack in sandstorm and you have a truly evil cactus. With access to Spikes, Cacturne is also a surprisingly effective team supporter, capable of setting up multiple layers of entry hazards against some of the most common defensive Pokemon in UU. Cacturne does have its flaws, however. Its low base 55 Speed forces it to rely on the fickle Sucker Punch to take on most offensive Pokemon, and its pitiful defensive stats and weaknesses to common types such as Bug, Fighting, and Fire make it easy to KO, provided the attacks connect. Like it or not, Cacturne is a Pokemon that relies on luck to reach its full potential; one roll of the RNG dice can be the difference between a wasted team slot and a devastating sweep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cacturne learns Nasty Plot and has equal base attacking stats, so a special set with Dark Pulse, Energy Ball, and Focus Blast is just as powerful as the standard Swords Dance set. While this set does allow Cacturne to beat a couple of its usual counters, such as Weezing and defensive Hitmontop, Cacturne will have a very difficult time trying to sweep without the priority of Sucker Punch. With such low Speed and pitiful defenses, a Nasty Plot set is unlikely to land more than one attack, so you're almost always better off using Swords Dance.</p> <p>Destiny Bond is always a nasty surprise for opponents, but Cacturne's low Speed makes it difficult to use. Superpower, Brick Break, and Drain Punch are alternative Fighting-type moves that Cacturne can use, but most of the Pokemon Cacturne wants to hit with a Fighting-type move are heavy Pokemon that Low Kick hits for 100 or 120 Base Power anyway. Thunder Punch can surprise Moltres on the switch, but it offers very little value otherwise. Poison Jab hits Tangrowth and other Grass-types slightly harder than Cacturne's other moves, but its overall coverage is disappointing. Needle Arm is Cacturne's signature move and comes with a nice 30% flinch rate, but Seed Bomb is significantly more powerful, and Cacturne is too slow to make good use of the secondary effect.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Hitmontop can fire off a Technician-boosted Mach Punch to easily OHKO Cacturne before it can do anything back, and it also has Rapid Spin to rid the field of any Spikes Cacturne has set up. Blaziken, Arcanine, and Toxicroak similarly dodge Sucker Punch with powerful priority attacks of their own, although they will take some serious damage in the process, as their priority moves will only 2HKO. Moltres can use Substitute to block Sucker Punch and resists all of Cacturne's other moves. Scyther's Aerial Ace ignores Cacturne's evasion boosts, and it also has Quick Attack to stop Cacturne from striking first with Sucker Punch. Weezing resists Seed Bomb and Low Kick and can cripple Cacturne with Will-O-Wisp or wipe out its boosts with Haze. If Cacturne lacks Seed Bomb, Ghost-types such as Mismagius can switch in with impunity and burn Cacturne with Will-O-Wisp or set up a Substitute and boost with Nasty Plot. Any faster Pokemon with Encore can force Cacturne out by locking it into Substitute or Swords Dance, although this should be done with caution, as you don't want to end up Encoring Spikes.</p> <p>When Sand Veil is active, remember that none of these counters are guaranteed to succeed. There is a good chance (close to 80%) that you will miss at least once against a Cacturne that is spamming Substitute. Make sure your Cacturne counters are healthy enough to take a hit and still do their job, or you will find yourself furiously cursing at your opponent as Cacturne wipes out your team.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>With an excellent base 115 Attack stat and access to STAB Sucker Punch, Cacturne is a fearsome Swords Dance sweeper. After a boost, Cacturne has the power to 2HKO the entire tier with the appropriate move. Sucker Punch covers Cacturne's low Speed and OHKOes the vast majority of offensive Pokemon, including common bulky attackers such as Milotic, Venusaur, Moltres, and Torterra. Seed Bomb is a more reliable STAB attack to use against defensive Pokemon and those that try to play around Sucker Punch with Substitute and other non-attacking moves. Low Kick rounds out Cacturne's coverage by OHKOing Registeel and Steelix; it is also Cacturne's best move against other walls that resist Seed Bomb, such as Tangrowth.</p> <p>This set is frightening enough as it is, but it becomes truly terrifying when sandstorm is up. Sand Veil makes every counter a shaky one and gives Cacturne the ability to sometimes come out on top in matchups where it would otherwise always lose. Using Substitute in the third slot allows Cacturne to really take advantage of the evasion boost by stalling out the opponent's hits until the near-inevitable miss. Substitute also allows Cacturne to use Focus Punch in the last slot, giving it even more power against defensive Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Arcanine, and Hitmontop.</p> <p>Cacturne can also use Encore to further aggravate opponents. Encore can simplify Cacturne's initial setup by forcing a switch, and it also punishes foes such as Mismagius and Moltres that may try to avoid Sucker Punch by setting up a Substitute in Cacturne's face. With sandstorm support, Leftovers and Bright Powder are both viable items that can make Cacturne even more difficult to take down. Leftovers allows Cacturne to create at least one additional Substitute, giving the opponent more opportunities to miss, while Bright Powder decreases the opponent's accuracy even further to 72%. In the long run, both items have similar effectiveness, but Bright Powder gives Cacturne a slightly better chance of getting at least one free turn.</p> <p>Whether or not Cacturne is using Substitute to stall for misses, sandstorm support from Hippopotas is very beneficial. Not only does sandstorm activate Sand Veil, but it also adds residual damage to the opponent's Pokemon, allowing Cacturne to KO opponents that otherwise might barely survive its assaults. Furthermore, Hippopotas can set up Stealth Rock, which severely weakens some of the Pokemon Cacturne fears, and spread status with Toxic or Yawn. Priority users such as Arcanine, Blaziken, Hitmontop, and Toxicroak can bypass Sucker Punch and prey on Cacturne's poor defenses, making a sweep impossible. Slowbro is an excellent check to all four of these Pokemon thanks to its excellent physical bulk and resistances to Fire- and Fighting-type moves. SubRoost Moltres is also a major problem for Cacturne, as Substitute protects it from Sucker Punch and it resists both Seed Bomb and Low Kick. Milotic can handle Moltres quite easily with a RestTalk set, and it also fares well against most of the other Fire- and Fighting-types that trouble Cacturne. Rhyperior is another excellent teammate in general, especially with sandstorm boosting its Special Defense. It can force out nearly all of the Pokemon that Cacturne fears with its incredibly potent STAB combination, and its immense bulk allows it to brush off hits that would destroy Cacturne, while Cacturne can switch in on the Water- and Grass-type moves that are Rhyperior's Achilles' heel.</p>"
      },
      "Spikes Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Cacturne is most often seen as an extremely dangerous Swords Dance sweeper, but with access to Spikes, Encore, and Sucker Punch, it can also be an effective lead. Encore locks opposing Pokemon into non-damaging moves such as Stealth Rock, giving Cacturne free turns to set up multiple layers of Spikes, while Sucker Punch punishes foes that try to attack. As one of the very few Pokemon that can set up Spikes while retaining an offensive presence, Cacturne is a good fit on offensive teams in need of entry hazards.</p> <p>Spikes and Encore are the two most important moves on this set. Cacturne's Focus Sash guarantees it will get at least one layer of Spikes up against any opposing lead that lacks Taunt, but Encore often creates opportunities for Cacturne to set up the second and third layers as well. Sucker Punch works extremely well in tandem with Encore; Encore encourages opponents to attack Cacturne directly, and Sucker Punch nails them when they oblige. Sucker Punch also deals heavy damage to most common U-turn leads, including Ambipom, Uxie, and Mesprit. Furthermore, the priority is very useful in finishing off opposing leads after knocking them down to their Focus Sash. Seed Bomb is the best option in the last slot, as it provides a reliable STAB attack that hits leads such as Omastar, Kabutops, and Cloyster for super effective damage.</p> <p>Protect can replace Seed Bomb if Ambipom and Persian are major concerns, as both can otherwise use Fake Out to remove Cacturne's Focus Sash and finish it off with Return before Cacturne gets a chance to move. However, the loss of Seed Bomb makes Cacturne extremely vulnerable to any opposing leads with Taunt. Adamant is usually the best nature, since Cacturne has Sucker Punch to deal with faster foes, but a Jolly nature does allow Cacturne to outspeed minimum Speed Uxie, tie with Timid Omastar, and beat an assortment of other Pokemon later in the match, such as Adamant Torterra and Modest Exeggutor. Either way, a simple EV spread that maximizes Cacturne's Attack and Speed is the way to go.</p> <p>Ambipom and Persian are major problems for this set, as they can use Taunt or Hypnosis to shut Cacturne down before it gets a chance to set up Spikes, or simply KO with Fake Out and Return if Cacturne lacks Protect. Scyther and Arcanine are also common leads that come out on top against Cacturne; each can bring Cacturne down to its Focus Sash with their super effective STAB attacks, then avoid taking a second Sucker Punch by finishing Cacturne off with Quick Attack or Extreme Speed. Rhyperior is an excellent switch-in to all four of these foes thanks to its titanic HP and Defense stats, although it must beware of Hidden Power Grass from Arcanine. Rhyperior can also use its matchup advantage to take the opportunity to set up Stealth Rock or begin a sweep with Rock Polish, maintaining the offensive momentum that is so important to most teams that employ Cacturne. Azumarill is another worthy teammate thanks to its solid overall bulk and ability to destroy Fire-types such as Arcanine with Aqua Jet. Since Cacturne's primary purpose is to set up Spikes, it's a good idea to also bring sweepers that appreciate residual damage on their grounded counters. Blaziken, Swellow, and Aggron are all examples of Pokemon that can turn 2HKOs into OHKOs with Spikes support.</p>"
      },
      "Spikes": {
        "description": "<p>While Cacturne's base stats clearly favor offense, it also functions fantastically as a defensive Spikes user. Cacturne holds several advantages over its fellow UU Spikes users: it's the only one with access to Encore, the only one with instant recovery (barring the extremely rare Roselia), and its typing allows it to comfortably set up against common Pokemon such as Spiritomb, Rotom, Milotic, and other bulky Water-types. Sand Veil further increases Cacturne's effectiveness, often giving it one or more free turns even against Pokemon that would otherwise counter it. Finally, Cacturne's fantastic Special Attack stat allows it to threaten most common Rapid Spinners with super effective Grass-type attacks, making it difficult for opponents to quickly remove the Spikes that Cacturne sets up.</p> <p>Synthesis provides reliable instant recovery, allowing Cacturne to stick around longer and set up as many layers of Spikes as possible. Dark Pulse and Energy Ball are both solid STAB attacks that hit hard even without any investment in Special Attack; Energy Ball hits Rapid Spin users such as Donphan, Cloyster, and Kabutops hard, while Dark Pulse grants valuable neutral coverage. If Cacturne has sandstorm support, Synthesis becomes less useful, so the set plays a little differently. Substitute works well with Sand Veil by creating opportunities for a miss, and Leech Seed provides recovery and causes switches, which will rack up residual damage and give Cacturne free turns to set up additional layers of Spikes. Encore is also a good option in the third slot, regardless of the situation, as it is very effective at generating free turns and forcing opponents to switch.</p> <p>Grass Knot is a valid alternative to Energy Ball for extra power against many walls, especially if Cacturne already has a consistent STAB attack in Dark Pulse. Bright Powder may be a tempting item to use in sandstorm to lower the opponent's accuracy even further to 72%, but Leftovers is almost always better in the long run as it allows Cacturne to create more Substitutes, giving the opponent additional chances to miss. The given EVs focus on Cacturne's special bulk, enabling it to set up easily against bulky Water-types and other weak special attackers. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with a Timid nature can be useful with Substitute and Leech Seed; this allows Cacturne to get a Substitute up before opposing walls can hit it with status, but it comes at the cost of some survivability.</p> <p>If you're planning to abuse Sand Veil with this set, Hippopotas support is obviously mandatory. A spinblocker such as Mismagius, Rotom, or Spiritomb is also highly recommended; they also provide an invaluable immunity to Fighting-type attacks from the likes of Hitmontop, which counters Cacturne easily. Cacturne's 4x weakness to Bug-type attacks makes it very vulnerable to U-turn users. Scyther is particularly dangerous, as it has Aerial Ace to bypass Sand Veil's evasion effect and is immune to Spikes. Registeel and other Steel-types therefore make great teammates with resistances to Bug-, Ice-, Poison-, and Flying-type attacks that Cacturne fears. Finally, bulky Water-types such as Milotic pair well with Cacturne, as they can sponge Fire-type attacks from the likes of Houndoom and Blaziken.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Altaria is often known as the \"UU Dragon\" because it's simply outclassed by Dragonite and other Dragons in OU. While it is outclassed in OU, it has a very interesting niche in the UU metagame. Being able to resist many of the most common attacks that are used in UU (Grass, Fire, Water, and Ground) as well as resisting common priority moves (Aqua Jet, Vacuum Wave, and Mach Punch), Altaria makes a great special wall and bulky Dragon Dance sweeper. Altaria's Special Defense is often high enough to even take Ice-type attacks after a Roost.</p> <p>While Altaria is a great defensive Pokemon, it's often held back by its mediocre offensive stats. Draco Meteor and Outrage compensate for this to an extent; however, even with these moves Altaria has trouble dealing enough damage to sweep without Dragon Dance boosts. After a Dragon Dance, however, with perfect coverage granted in two moves, decent Speed, and a 120 Base Power STAB attack, Altaria will be able to devastate unprepared teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A mixed set works great for Altaria as well, since it doesn't need to worry about Calm Mind Pokemon setting up on Draco Meteor. However, Altaria simply isn't strong enough to abuse both its Special Attack and Attack with the same set. A Toxic stalling set could also work on Altaria, since Altaria boasts impressive defenses and Roost. However, Moltres outclasses Altaria in this regard with Pressure and a much more powerful Fire-type STAB attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>If Altaria doesn't carry Earthquake or Fire Blast, any Steel-type will have an easy time beating it, though Registeel and Steelix need to be careful when facing the Sleep Talk set because it can heal off the damage they cause and set up Dragon Dance. Altaria also has an easily exploitable 4x weakness, so bulky Water-types who invest in Special Attack should have no trouble walling and KOing Altaria.</p> <p>Regirock and Donphan make great checks to the Sleep Talk Dragon Dance set, as they don't take much damage from Outrage and can easily 1-2HKO with Stone Edge and Ice Shard, respectively.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>This set moves away from Altaria's defensive prowess and focuses on its decent Speed, movepool, and Dragon Dance. Altaria reaches 388 Speed after a Dragon Dance, which outpaces everything (without a boost) in UU minus Electrode. After a Dragon Dance, Altaria will OHKO a good portion of the metagame as well. For example, Venusaur, who is fairly bulky, is easily KOed by a +1 Outrage.</p> <p>Earthquake grants Altaria perfect coverage with Outrage, since there are no Skarmory or Bronzong in UU, and it allows Altaria to take out its counters before it lets loose with Outrage. Roost takes advantage of Altaria's natural bulkiness and is especially useful to avoid Sucker Punch. That said, Fire Blast is a decent option to hit Steelix harder than Earthquake would on the switch, but reduces Altaria's long-term viability substantially by cutting out Roost.</p> <p>This Altaria set really benefits from Pokemon such as Venusaur who can deal with Steelix and Regirock with its STAB special attacks. Wallbreakers such as Blaziken and Nidoking work quite well too, easily switching into Steel- and Rock-type attacks, respectively, and OHKOing with their STAB special attacks.</p> <p>Defensively, Altaria appreciates Steel-types who can absorb Ice and Rock attacks. Altaria will also often be forced out by Regirock or Donphan using Stone Edge or Ice Shard, respectively, meaning something that can switch into these Pokemon and threaten them is also greatly appreciated. Bulky Water-types such as Milotic can switch into Regirock and Donphan with ease and OHKO them with Surf, making these Water-types great teammates for Altaria.</p>"

      "Bulky Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Solid defenses allow Altaria to set up on many of UU's weaker attackers and get several Dragon Dances under its belt before smashing through teams with its nearly unresisted STAB Dragon Claw. This Altaria set has two uses: it can serve as a cleric with Heal Bell and as a check to many of UU's threatening special sweepers throughout the match, and also set up a sweep for itself near the end of the match.</p> <p>Dragon Claw is chosen over Outrage as Altaria's attacking move for several reasons. Altaria is designed to serve as a supporting Pokemon for the majority of a match, but Outrage leaves it vulnerable to revenge kills if it has to attack without any gathered Dragon Dances. Dragon Claw also lets Altaria alternate between attacking and Roosting to bring down foes without recovery. This Altaria set is expected to get multiple Dragon Dances, so Dragon Claw's power loss is not as detrimental to Altaria's sweeping chances as Outrage's confusion. Heal Bell lets Altaria support its team by curing all status afflictions, but Safeguard is the better choice for improving Altaria's chances of setting up. Safeguard protects Altaria from sleep attacks and only needs to be used once every five turns; Heal Bell's 8 PP can be stalled out quite easily by an opponent spamming Toxic.</p> <p>Max HP and 176 Special Defense EVs along with a Special Defense boosting nature allow Altaria to set up on most of UU's Ice Beam-wielding bulky Waters, something offensively-inclined sets cannot do. For example, the standard Milotic's Ice Beam only manages an average of 31.6% against a Roosting Altaria. With Leftovers healing an additional 6.25% of your health every turn, as well as UU's general lack of sandstorm and hail, it is not too difficult to alternate between Dragon Dance and Roost to set up; Safeguard counteracts Ice Beam's freeze chance, and a critical hit will only KO if it occurs on Altaria's non-Roosting turn. The 64 Speed EVs let Altaria hit 318 Speed after one Dragon Dance, outspeeding everything up to and including +Speed natured base 95s, such as Drapion and Houndoom. The remaining 16 EVs are placed in Attack to bring Altaria's unboosted stat to a well rounded 180.</p> <p>Toxic Spikes support is excellent for setting up on bulky Waters since Altaria can just alternate between Dragon Dance and Roost as increasing poison damage takes out the foe. Omastar is able to set up Toxic Spikes as well as Stealth Rock and Spikes and has high physical Defense to complement Altaria's high Special Defense. Venusaur and Drapion are also decent choices; Altaria can take Fire attacks for Venusaur and Ground attacks for Drapion, but it must beware of Ice attacks. Altaria cannot sweep when Steel-types such as Registeel and Steelix are alive; both Dugtrio and Magneton can trap and take them out but must beware of switching into Iron Head or Ice Punch for Dugtrio or Thunder Wave or Earthquake for Magneton. Rapid Spin support is also much appreciated, especially since Altaria is designed to act as a cleric and special sponge throughout the match.</p>"

      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Altaria's great typing and access to rare supporting moves make it a valuable addition to any defensive team. Altaria boasts resistances to Fire, Water, Grass, and Fighting, and an immunity to Ground. In addition to this, Altaria has access to an instant recovery move in Roost and pseudo status immunity from its Natural Cure ability.</p> <p>To maximize its support options, Altaria only has space for one attacking move. Using Altaria's Dragon STAB is recommended due to its excellent neutral coverage. Altaria has equal attacking stats, but Dragon Claw is preferred over Dragon Pulse because most of the Pokemon Altaria prefers to take on, such as Venusaur, Houndoom, Mismagius, Espeon, and Sceptile, have lower Defense than Special Defense. Aerial Ace is another option because it hits Grass- and Fighting-types such as Venusaur and Blaziken for super effective damage.</p> <p>Roost grants Altaria reliable recovery and lets it reduce its quadruple Ice weakness to a double weakness and gain a resistance to Electric-type attacks for a turn. Heal Bell supports the entire team by healing all status afflictions. If you already have a cleric, Earthquake can be used in the third slot to hit Steel- and Fire-types. In the last slot, there are three options to use against stat-up Pokemon: Perish Song, Roar, and Haze. Perish Song is very helpful on stall teams for dealing with the last Pokemon scenario, when the foe can no longer be phazed. Roar has the advantage of causing the opponent to immediately switch; however, it is useless in a last Pokemon situation. Haze is the most reliable option for eliminating stat boosts, but it doesn't encourage the opponent to switch nearly as much as the other two options (which means less residual damage).</p> <p>Registeel resists all three of Altaria's weaknesses and makes an ideal partner on a defensive team. It can provide paralysis and Toxic support and set up Stealth Rock to make the most of Altaria's shuffling moves. In return, Altaria resists the Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks that plague Registeel and allows Registeel to use Rest without having to use Sleep Talk due to Heal Bell. Altaria needs a field clear of Stealth Rock to be able to do its job properly. Hitmontop is a good candidate due to Intimidate, its resistance to Rock-type attacks, and access to Foresight for an almost guaranteed Rapid Spin.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>At first, it may seem odd to attach a Choice Band to a Pokemon with middling Attack and Speed stats. However, Altaria's Attack stat is sufficient to smash through many common defensive Pokemon, while its lower Speed stat is counterbalanced by bulk that frailer, more powerful sweepers can only dream of. Altaria's true strength lies in the excellent neutral coverage of Dragon-type attacks. While it cannot claim to 2HKO every single Pokemon in the tier with \"the right attack,\" this is a strength, not a weakness--for the most part, there is no need to predict which Pokemon the opponent will switch in.</p> <p>Outrage is Altaria's primary attack, and the one it should be using the majority of the time. Since there are no levitating Steels in UU, Earthquake hits every Pokemon that resists Outrage for super effective damage. Even though there are only three Steel Pokemon in the UU metagame, predicting a switch-in with Earthquake can enable you to more easily spam Outrage later in the game. Sleep Talk makes Altaria a more offensive reaction to Venusaur. If Venusaur puts Altaria to sleep with Sleep Powder, Altaria would ordinarily have to switch out in order to wake up with Natural Cure, which would give Venusaur a free turn to set up or attack. Sleep Talk means that Altaria has a high probability of attacking Venusaur in its sleep, at the very least ensuring a free switch-in for a teammate on the next turn as Venusaur heals with Synthesis. Dragon Claw is usable over Sleep Talk since it gives Altaria a secondary STAB move if you're afraid of locking Altaria into Outrage, but it misses out on many significant OHKOs and 2HKOs. Finally, Rest heals off damage taken from attacks or Stealth Rock, and is particularly effective against stall teams.</p> <p>The given EVs are designed to maximize offensive potential while still taking advantage of Altaria's natural bulk. 252 Attack investment is a given, while 148 Speed lets Altaria hit 233 Speed, which outpaces Jolly Torterra. The primary Pokemon that resides between 148 Speed and max Speed is Adamant Absol, which isn't an important benchmark since it will just Sucker Punch Altaria anyway. Lowering Speed further is perfectly fine if you aren't concerned about Jolly Torterra; 92 EVs hits 219 Speed, which beats Jolly Aggron, and 64 EVs sits Altaria at 212 Speed, just enough to beat Adamant Torterra. An Adamant nature is necessary to compensate for Altaria's low Attack stat. A Jolly nature is basically worthless because it keeps Altaria from doing enough damage to defensive Pokemon; even worse, it is pointless as Jolly Altaria cannot even OHKO the offensive Pokemon it Speed ties.</p> <p>This set is, first and foremost, a bulky attacker, not a glass cannon. It doesn't pack the pure power of some other Pokemon, but its Outrage is powerful enough to get the job done, especially with Natural Cure and its multitude of resistances preventing common defensive Pokemon from hitting Altaria effectively in return. A Choice Banded Outrage can be a nasty surprise for Pokemon such as Milotic planning to sponge a weak Dragon Claw, or at worst a Dragon Danced Outrage, due to its abnormally high damage output. Here are some damage calculations that show the fearsome power of 70 base Attack:</p> <ul> <li>Outrage vs 252/0 Torterra: 52.5% - 61.9%</li> <li>Outrage vs 248/252+ Milotic: 45.8% - 54.2%</li> <li>Outrage vs 252/200 Milotic: 52.8% - 62.4%</li> <li>Outrage vs 252/0 Venusaur: 69.2% - 81.6%</li> <li>Outrage vs 252/252+ Spiritomb: 48.4% - 57.2%</li> <li>Outrage vs 252/0 Spiritomb: 66.4% - 78.3%</li> <li>-1 Outrage vs 252/96+ Hitmontop: 40.5% - 47.7%</li> <li>Outrage vs 136/0 Rhyperior: 42.2% - 49.9%</li> <li>-1 Outrage vs 252/80 Arcanine: 40.6% - 47.9%</li> <li>-1 Earthquake vs 252/80 Arcanine: 45.3% - 53.6%</li> <li>Earthquake vs 252/0 Registeel: 46.7% - 54.9%</li> <li>Outrage vs 0/0 Venusaur: 83.7% - 98.7%</li> <li>Outrage vs 0/0 Mismagius: 124.1% - 146.4%</li> <li>Outrage vs 0/0 Moltres: 73.2% - 86.3%</li> </ul> <p>As to be expected, this set mainly has problems with Steel-type Pokemon. Registeel and Steelix are usually more than willing to switch into Altaria, but Aggron lives in fear of a boosted Earthquake OHKOing it. However, once Altaria locks itself into Outrage, Aggron can easily switch in and either KO Altaria outright or set up with Rock Polish or Substitute. This makes Donphan and Hitmontop great teammates for Altaria, since they switch easily into all Steel-type Pokemon and resist Rock-type attacks aimed at Altaria. Cloyster shares a Rock-type weakness with Altaria, but can set up Spikes all day long against the offensively inept Registeel and Steelix. All three of these Pokemon are able to use Rapid Spin to clear the field for Altaria as well. It may be tempting to use Dugtrio to trap these Steel-types, but seeing as Choice Band Altaria is not a win condition, rather a wallbreaker, the downsides and risks associated with using Dugtrio are generally not worth the rewards. Altaria can 2HKO Registeel and Aggron anyway, and both it and Dugtrio have problems with Steelix, so nothing is really gained.</p> <p>Other than Steel-types, Altaria also has some problems breaking through especially bulky Pokemon that are neutral to Outrage. Tangrowth can easily tank two Outrages, heal with Synthesis, and strike back with Hidden Power Ice. Defensively EVed Rhyperior and Regirock also shrug off Outrage before bringing Altaria crashing to the ground with Stone Edge. Finally, Altaria can be checked by faster Pokemon, but usually only by those with super effective attacks backed up by STAB or a 4x weakness, such as Kabutops and Hidden Power Ice Sceptile. If you try to revenge kill Altaria with a Mismagius, well... congratulations on dealing a little damage with Shadow Ball then getting OHKOed by Outrage.</p>"

      "Mono-Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set, while functioning similarly to the above set, takes advantage of Altaria's 120 Base Power STAB Outrage and the way it functions with Sleep Talk. If Sleep Talk picks Outrage, the move functions normally, but its negative secondary effects are ignored. This means Altaria can get away with using Outrage without worrying about being locked in or affected by confusion. With Rest over Roost, Altaria can heal and recover from status both in one turn, as opposed to being forced to use Roost then Heal Bell. This gives Altaria a chance to smack the opponent with a hard boosted Outrage on the switch. The premise of this set is simple: use Dragon Dance until you are forced to Rest, then hit the opponent with boosted Outrages.</p> <p>The EVs on this set are more offensively-oriented because of Altaria's natural bulkiness and because it's important for Altaria to hit hard with Outrage, since the opponent will likely switch to their best counter once Altaria uses Rest. The 36 Speed EVs are all that is needed to outpace all Moltres and other base 90s after a Dragon Dance.</p> <p>This Altaria specifically benefits from Aggron being removed, since Aggron completely walls Altaria and is more dangerous than any of the other Steel-types. Swellow will usually lure out the opponent's Aggron if they have one, and Dugtrio can trap and KO it, meaning Altaria would be free to sweep after that. Spikes are also important for this set since with three layers of Spikes, Altaria can 2HKO Registeel at +6 Attack assuming your opponent switches in Registeel after you have set up as a last resort attempt to stop your sweep via Explosion. Ironically, this set also benefits from Aggron as a teammate, since any strong Ice- or Rock-types may come in hoping to KO Altaria before it sets up. As a bonus, Altaria and Aggron resist every type together except for Electric and Steel.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Although Altaria's Special Attack stat is mediocre, it is still strong enough to pull off a Choice Specs set by abusing its Dragon STAB. Since many of Altaria's usual switch-ins, such as Rhyperior and Donphan, are lacking in Special Defense, Altaria can lure them in and crush them with a powerful Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor. With opposing physical walls severely damaged, physical sweepers of your own will have a much easier time sweeping.</p> <p>Draco Meteor is Altaria's main STAB, and even with Altaria's pitiful base 70 Special Attack, it can still punch surprisingly large holes in the opponent's team. Fire Blast hits Steel-types that resist Draco Meteor, capable of 2HKOing Registeel after a layer of Stealth Rock and Spikes. Dragon Pulse is a more reliable STAB option than Draco Meteor, but Sleep Talk allows Altaria to switch into Venusaur's Sleep Powder with ease. Rest is used in the last spot so Altaria can instantly recover any health it has lost, switch out to remove sleep with its ability, Natural Cure, and and come back in later in the battle to continue pounding the opposition.</p> <p>To demonstrate Altaria's power, here are some damage calculations:</p> <ul> <li>Draco Meteor vs 252 HP / 0 SpD Donphan: 98.70% - 100%</li> <li>Draco Meteor vs 140 HP / 0 SpD Rhyperior: 99.75% - 100%</li> <li>Draco Meteor vs 120 HP / 0 SpD Arcanine: 85.75% - 100%</li> <li>Draco Meteor vs 252 HP / 0 SpD Hitmontop: 75.99% - 89.80%</li> <li>Draco Meteor vs 136 HP / 252 SpD Careful Tangrowth: 72.07% - 85.37%</li> <li>Draco Meteor vs 252 HP / 252 SpD Weezing: 73.95% - 87.43%</li> <li>Draco Meteor vs 252 HP / 0 SpD Uxie: 64.41% - 76.27%</li> <li>Draco Meteor vs 252 HP / 4 SpD Slowbro: 76.14% - 89.85%</li> <li>Draco Meteor vs 252 HP / 220 SpD Careful Regirock: 51.10% - 60.16%</li> <li>Draco Meteor vs 252 HP / 4 SpD Omastar: 97.09% - 100%</li> <li>Draco Meteor vs 252 HP / 100 SpD Calm Clefable: 56.60% - 67.01%</li> <li>Fire Blast vs 252 HP / 252 SpD Careful Registeel: 42.86% - 50.55%</li> <li>Fire Blast vs 252 HP / 252 SpD Careful Steelix: 76.27% - 89.83%</li> </ul> <p>The given EV spread allows Altaria to hit as hard as possible on the special side, as well as outspeed unboosted Jolly Torterra. The rest of the EVs go into reinforcing Altaria's decent bulk.</p> <p>Although Altaria is good at taking down walls, it still has problems with Milotic, who can avoid getting 2HKOed by Draco Meteor, heal itself with Recover, and strike back with Ice Beam. Venusaur and Toxicroak can easily switch into Milotic and wreak havoc, while Altaria can take on the Fire-types that threaten the aforementioned Grass- and Poison-types. Since Altaria is weak to Stealth Rock, Rapid Spin support is highly beneficial. Hitmontop and Blastoise are both bulky Rapid Spinners that synergize well with Altaria, and they can both pull off a Rapid Spin on Ghost-types thanks to Foresight.</p> <p>Since Altaria is good at luring out physical walls and damaging them beyond repair, physical sweepers that can take advantage of this are ideal teammates. Swords Dance Scyther, Swellow, Tauros, and Kangaskhan can all sweep more freely after the removal of Steelix and Registeel, while Dragon Dance Feraligatr, Rock Polish Rhyperior, and Swords Dance Leafeon can easily take advantage of a highly battered Weezing. Swords Dance Drapion also shines when opposing Donphan or Rhyperior are removed from the battle.</p>"

  "Zangoose": {
    "overview": "<p>Shunned and rejected in favor of better options in standard play, it could be considered a true blessing that Zangoose set his sights lower and plunged into the unsettled waters of the UU tier. Sadly for the demon furball, however, he has failed to make any sort of impact in even this lower metagame and is still ousted from teams in favor of bulkier, faster, or harder-hitting alternatives.</p> <p>However, let us not be too hasty in condemning the white wonder to disuse. Though his stats are low, they are distributed excellently; he has a very reliable STAB to use and a collection of moves that back it up with both excellent coverage and desirable boosts. That said, he is hard to use correctly, but with adequate support, there is very little in UU that can stop him from doing what he was designed to do: cause a lot of damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice items are useful tools for Zangoose to have, as they alleviate concerns about either power or Speed in exchange for being locked into one move; however, for the most part Tauros and Kangaskhan can use those sorts of sets better. Zangoose also has STAB Flail in its arsenal, which can be useful alongside Swords Dance, Close Combat, and Shadow Claw, but with all the priority running around in UU, Flail sets have a much lower chance of succeeding in sweeping in comparison to the Swords Dance set. If running a Jolly nature on Zangoose, you may miss out on some OHKOs due to the loss in power. Zangoose has two stronger STAB moves than Return in the form of Double-Edge and Mega Kick. Both have 120 Base Power to Return's 102, but both also have very nasty drawbacks. Double-Edge has good accuracy and PP but deals recoil damage whenever Zangoose hits someone, which can be crippling with Zangoose's low HP stat on top of possible Life Orb recoil. Mega Kick has the same power and no damaging effect, but it has very low accuracy and PP.</p> <p>Silk Scarf is a viable alternative to Life Orb, as it does not have a detrimental side effect and can also lure your opponent into believing that Zangoose is Choice-locked, provided of course you do not use Swords Dance prematurely; however, it lacks the all-around power of Life Orb. Don't bother with Taunt; everyone 2HKOes him. Zangoose packs an astounding special movepool, including Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, Flamethrower, Shadow Ball, and Focus Blast, and thus a gimmick mixed set is somewhat viable, though not advised owing to Zangoose's very low Special Attack stat. Of the Elemental Punches, Ice Punch is the most viable, but is only more powerful than STAB Return against Altaria, Gligar, Torterra, and Tropius in UU. Lastly, Counter can be used with a Focus Sash to KO an unsuspecting opponent.</p> <p>You should always run max Attack and at least near max Speed. The recommended Speed EVs are the minimum you should be using, with any spare EVs dumped into a preferred defensive stat, but not HP. With 0 EVs, Zangoose has 287 HP, which is ideal; residual damage rounds down, so you lose 35 HP from Stealth Rock, 28 from Life Orb, and 17 from sandstorm. With 4 EVs and 288 HP Stealth Rock deals 36 damage and sandstorm deals 18.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Countering the Swords Dance variant of Zangoose directly is more difficult than one would imagine, because of its ability to at least 2HKO anyone in UU. Because of this, it is generally easier to attempt to force him out as he Swords Dances with someone faster with OHKO potential, such as Swellow; however, this runs the obvious risk of switching straight into a Life Orbed Return.</p> <p>Of the Pokemon considered at least decent checks to Zangoose, Spiritomb is by far the best. Spiritomb is not OHKOed by even a Swords Dance boosted Shadow Claw, and can cripple Zangoose with Will-O-Wisp or defeat him with some combination of Sucker Punch, Dark Pulse, and Hidden Power Fighting. Next on the list is Hitmontop, who can function as a wall or a revenge killer. Defensive Hitmontop can Intimidate Zangoose, destroy him with a STAB Close Combat, or Spin away entry hazards. Technitop can beat Zangoose through a combination of Fake Out + Mach Punch, but must be careful not to switch into Return. It should also be noted that Zangoose's Quick Attack will 2HKO Technitop after a Swords Dance, so using Mach Punch first with Hitmontop rather than opening with Fake Out is probably a better strategy.</p> <p>Far more popular methods of dealing with Zangoose involve simply outspeeding and OHKOing him. However, Zangoose can and will occasionally run a Scarf set and is also capable of bluffing one with Silk Scarf, so this is not an entirely reliable strategy. The most popular Pokemon who are naturally faster are Mismagius, Alakazam, Swellow, Ambipom, Scyther, Arcanine, Drapion, and Rotom. Note that most of these Pokemon will usually fail to OHKO a full HP Zangoose with an unboosted attack. For reference, Mismagius's unboosted Hidden Power Fighting will do about 70% damage to Zangoose, so Mismagius may have to abuse Life Orb recoil through strategic switching before attacking. Most faster Pokemon will have to watch out for Quick Attack, however. Finally, if Zangoose lacks Quick Attack, priority users such as Blaziken and Absol can revenge him.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Zangoose is one of a whole host of physical Normal-type sweepers once deemed too powerful for UU, and have since returned to the tier in order to justify that claim. Unfortunately though, they have for the most part failed to make any significant impact on the metagame. On paper, Zangoose does not have many distinguishing features to make himself stand out from his Normal-type brethren -- Tauros and Ambipom are faster, and Ursaring and Slaking have more initial attack power. However, this should not deter you from using Zangoose -- he has above average stats in both Speed and Attack, and has one key factor that makes him exceptional: a very wide physical movepool.</p> <p>Swords Dance enables Zangoose to boost his Attack and possibly open up a sweeping opportunity. Return is the given STAB move, boasting both a relatively high Base Power and reliable accuracy. Close Combat is a blessing for Zangoose, as he can retaliate with feeling against Steel- and Rock-types who resist his STAB. The last slot has a number of options going for it. Quick Attack is the superior option since it can OHKO faster Pokemon like Alakazam, Sceptile, and Swellow after Stealth Rock. It also lets Zangoose defeat priority users such as Blaziken, Absol, and Hitmonlee. Shadow Claw can also be used to hit Ghost-type Pokemon; however, it is not very reliable, since Mismagius and Rotom are faster and usually carry Substitute for scouting, while Spiritomb is not hit super effectively.</p> <p>After a Swords Dance, Zangoose has the ability to break slower walls with relative ease -- even with a Jolly nature, just about everyone in UU is at least 2HKOed by him after a Swords Dance, and plenty more Pokemon are OHKOed:</p> <h6>Damage Calculations</h6> <ul> <li>+2 Jolly Zangoose Life Orb Return vs. 252 HP 252 Def Bold Milotic: 84.0% - 99.2%</li> <li>+1 Jolly Zangoose Life Orb Return vs. 252 HP 252 Def Impish Hitmontop: 73.0% - 86.2%</li> <li>+2 Jolly Zangoose Life Orb Close Combat vs. 252 HP Registeel: 120.3% - 141.8%</li> <li>+2 Jolly Zangoose Life Orb Close Combat vs. 252 HP Steelix: 96.0% - 113.0%</li> <li>+2 Jolly Zangoose Life Orb Close Combat vs. 252 HP Regirock: 93.4% - 109.9%</li> <li>+2 Jolly Zangoose Life Orb Close Combat vs. 136 HP Rhyperior: 92.1% - 108.4%</li> <li>+2 Jolly Zangoose Life Orb Close Combat vs. 252 HP Bold Cloyster: 111.8% - 131.6%</li> <li>+2 Jolly Zangoose Life Orb Quick Attack vs. 4 HP Alakazam: 115.9% - 136.9%</li> <li>+2 Jolly Zangoose Life Orb Quick Attack vs. 4 HP Sceptile: 78.7% - 92.9%</li> <li>+2 Jolly Zangoose Life Orb Quick Attack vs. 4 HP Dugtrio: 127.8% - 150.5%</li> <li>+2 Jolly Zangoose Life Orb Quick Attack vs. 4 HP Absol: 86.4% - 101.8%</li> </ul> <p>All of the above calculations were done assuming a Jolly nature. With an Adamant nature, however, Zangoose is guaranteed to OHKO many of these walls with one of his attacks, even without entry hazards, but will fail to outrun faster Pokemon such as positive nature Venusaur and Blaziken. Even so, an Adamant nature can be helpful to assure OHKOs on faster Pokemon with Quick Attack, such as Sceptile. With a Jolly nature, Zangoose has a fair chance to miss an OHKO on many walls, and while they will likely fail to OHKO him with one attack, their attack's damage on top of Life Orb recoil can end his sweep prematurely. Thus, it is recommended strongly that you save Zangoose for lategame when the opponent's walls have had a chance to accumulate some damage. However, although his Speed is decent, he is outrun and halted by a number of common threats. Drapion, Mismagius, and Rotom all outrun him and, while none of them can OHKO with a single unboosted attack, they highlight the point that Zangoose can easily be revenge killed before he has a chance to sweep. Quick Attack can remedy this, but if you lack Shadow Claw you are setup fodder for Mismagius and Spiritomb. The item choice is also an important one -- Life Orb is almost always the best choice, as it gives more power to all of Zangoose's moves, and without it he can miss some crucial OHKOs. A Jolly nature is best here to outrun neutral base 95s and 100s, such as Drapion and Arcanine, as well as positive nature base 80s like Kabutops and Venusaur. With no EV investment in HP, Zangoose takes minimum damage from indirect damage, such as Stealth Rock and the rare sandstorm.</p> <p>Although Zangoose's damage output is spectacular, the process of actually setting up Swords Dance to sweep can be a difficult one. Zangoose has to both switch in, possibly taking entry hazard damage, and set up, giving the opponent two turns in which to end him. Zangoose's defenses are gut-wrenchingly frail even for UU, and even those with the poorest offenses can find a way to damage him, not to mention the fact that even those at the bottom of the offensive barrel, such as Registeel and Chansey, can find a way to ruin him through status afflictions. To help Zangoose set up, you can try to reduce the damage dealt to him by opponents by using dual screens, which can be set up by someone like Uxie, who can also set up Stealth Rock and use Memento to give Zangoose a free switch in. The use of Memento also lowers the opponent's offensive power, forcing them to switch and giving Zangoose that all-important turn to set up. In other situations you can simply wait and sacrifice one of your Pokemon in order to switch Zangoose in for free, or try to clear a hole using Explosion. When Zangoose is actually in play, you will need to find a way to set him up without taking too much damage. Against offensive teams, dual screens support is a great help, and you may also consider Baton Passing a Substitute to Zangoose to protect it from status.</p> <p>As for who Zangoose can actually set up on, those Pokemon with mediocre assaults are the best bets, the most notable being Chansey, since Zangoose can take a Seismic Toss and is immune to Toxic (just try to avoid Thunder Wave). You can also try Tricking a weaker Pokemon such as Registeel and letting Zangoose set up on him, but this has a very high chance of failing. If Zangoose can force an opponent out, either because you bluff the intention of attacking (if your opponent's Pokemon is on low health but still needed) or your opponent believes that the appropriate move is to switch to someone bulkier or a faster revenge killer (which can be good or bad depending on who they choose, but by this point you should have worked out your opponent's team accurately enough to know what this will entail).</p> <p>Stealth Rock support is heavily recommended for this set, as it can make the difference between a 2HKO and an OHKO. Paralysis support or a Baton Passed Agility is also viable in case Zangoose should be outsped, since the extra Speed can occasionally mean the difference between a win and a loss. Defensive Spiritomb is one of this set's greatest foes, and thus Blaziken can be one of this set's greatest allies since he resists Spiritomb's Dark-type STAB and is immune to Will-O-Wisp, and has the potential to OHKO with STAB Fire Blast. Rest Talk Hariyama also resists Dark-type attacks, can heal off burns with Rest or use them to activate Guts, but does not have anything to hit back at Spiritomb with. Houndoom also resists both Ghost- and Dark-type attacks and can take advantage of Will-O-Wisp with Flash Fire. In the case of Hitmontop, a Spiritomb of your own will hinder your opponent, as it is immune to Fighting-type moves and Rapid Spin.</p>"

  "Seviper": {
    "overview": "<p>Let's be honest here, Seviper isn't exactly everyone's first choice for a UU sweeper, but with two base 100 attacking stats and a hugely diverse movepool, the Fang Snake Pokemon can definitely cause some havoc and become a great wallbreaker. Seviper is somewhat frail defensively, but it can survive most neutral STAB attacks, and has resistances to common Grass-, Bug-, and Fighting-type attacks, making it capable of slithering into some niche roles on the average UU team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Seviper has a decent special movepool so a Choice Specs set is viable, with Sludge Bomb, Giga Drain, Flamethrower, and Dark Pulse, but keep in mind that most targets in UU are hit harder by Seviper's physical attacks. X-Scissor is another decent physical move that Seviper has at its disposal, but it has redundant coverage with Poison Jab and Sucker Punch. Seviper has some decent support options, including Glare, Knock Off, Haze, Taunt, and Toxic, but its defenses are really nothing to write home about, so a support set on Seviper will always be inferior to just outright attacking.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Seviper has naturally poor Speed and defenses, so it's not too hard to switch your Pokemon in on a resisted attack and threaten to outspeed and KO it. Donphan and Rhyperior can switch in on a predicted Poison Jab and proceed to threaten with STAB Earthquake, but they must watch out for Aqua Tail. Registeel is immune to Poison Jab, and once switched in can begin to support its team or just take Seviper down. Powerful Flying-types such as Swellow and Moltres can switch in on Earthquake and eliminate Seviper with their respective STAB moves of choice; Altaria does likewise and can also choose to set up with Dragon Dance. Bulky Psychic-types, such as Mesprit, Uxie, and Slowbro, can survive Crunch or Sucker Punch and KO back with STAB Psychic. Milotic shrugs off Seviper's assaults with ease, and can wash its poisonous advances away with Surf.</p>",

      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Seviper's excellent movepool provides it with a wide range of coverage and attacking options, making an all-out attacker set a natural fit for this wicked reptile. Poison Jab is the all-important STAB attack, capable of 2HKOing the pink nuisances Clefable and Chansey. Earthquake punishes Steel-types who think they can switch in for free on Seviper's Poison Jab. Sucker Punch is a nifty option on this set as it remedies Seviper's poor Speed, and is a great way to take out the Ghost- and Psychic-types that pervade UU. Aqua Tail hurts the Ground-types who are resistant to Poison Jab, especially Rhyperior; it's also a good way to eliminate Moltres, who might otherwise be tempted to switch in on Earthquake or Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Life Orb is the obvious item for this set as Seviper appreciates the boost in power and the freedom to switch moves, meaning it can better take advantage of its coverage moves. 212 Speed EVs allow this hissing fiend to outpace Rock Polish Torterra and Rock Polish Aggron, Attack is maximized to capitalize on Seviper's offenses, and the rest is dumped into HP for some bulk. This Seviper is not meant to be played as your average all-purpose wallbreaker, but rather as a Pokemon who softens up the opponent's core in preparation for a teammate's sweep, so it's a good idea to pair it up with late-game sweepers such as Blaziken or Rock Polish Aggron. This Seviper also has trouble breaking through bulky Waters, so it's best to have Venusaur as a teammate to handle the ubiquitous Milotic.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>A fast Seviper is something your opponent won't see coming, and the Choice Scarf set accomplishes exactly that. The element of surprise is further aided by Seviper's wide movepool, making it difficult to predict what attack it's going to throw out next. Poison Jab is a fantastic STAB move that puts huge dents in fragile sweepers who think they can outspeed Seviper. Earthquake shuts down Steels and other Poison-types who like to switch in on a predicted Poison Jab. Crunch deals with Ghost- and Psychic-types, but most Psychic Pokemon are so frail they'll likely get knocked out by Poison Jab anyway. Alternatively, Aqua Tail provides good neutral damage on most foes, and is Seviper's best way of handling Rhyperior and Moltres. In the final slot we have Switcheroo, which passes the Choice Scarf onto the opposing Pokemon, so it's a fine way to ruin bulky walls such as Registeel and set-up sweepers such as Dragon Dance Feraligatr.</p> <p>The Speed EVs, Jolly nature, and Choice Scarf allow Seviper to outspeed threats such as Dugtrio and Sceptile, so the venomous menace can eliminate them before they can get a hit in. Seviper's ability to cripple an opposing wall with Switcheroo is very unexpected and should not be underestimated, and it's a good idea to pair up this Seviper with Pokemon who can take advantage of a crippled wall and set up; prime examples include Dragon Dance Feraligatr, Dragon Dance Altaria, and Calm Mind Spiritomb.</p>"

  "Whiscash": {
    "overview": "<p>With passable offense, decent bulk, and access to key moves like Dragon Dance, Whiscash is a perfect example of an underrated threat of UU. Although Whiscash seems to be outclassed by Feraligatr in an offensive role, it has some advantages, including its significantly larger special bulk and Ground typing. Similarly, it has advantages over Quagsire and Gastrodon due to the fact that it can play a much more offensive role than those two are capable of. Given a significant amount of support from its teammates, along with an opportunity to set up, Whiscash can be a fearsome offensive threat that is capable of plowing through well-built teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Outside of Dragon Dance, Whiscash's uses on a team are limited. A Choice Band set can be utilized to transform Whiscash into a decent wallbreaker, although even with the Choice Band boost, Whiscash is noticeably weak, so this route is not recommended. A special set consisting of Hydro Pump, Earth Power, Ice Beam, and Hidden Power Grass can be used, but due to Whiscash's lackluster Special Attack stat, this is gimmicky at best. Rock Slide can be used over Stone Edge if you prefer the extra accuracy over power. Also, Zen Headbutt can be used to hit Venusaur for super effective damage, although it fails against other Grass-types. Lastly, Substitute can help stop status problems, one of Whiscash's greatest concerns.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Several Pokemon can threaten Whiscash but the foremost problems are bulky Grass- and Water-types, both of which take almost nothing from Whiscash's attacks and can KO back with a super effective Grass-type attack or stall him out, respectively. Tangrowth, Venusaur, and Milotic are excellent examples of such Pokemon due to their natural bulk and decent offensive prowess; Sceptile is also a great counter since it can outpace even a Speed-boosted Whiscash and KO with a Grass-type attack. Moving on, physical tanks carrying Will-O-Wisp screw Whiscash over; both Weezing and Defensive Mismagius with max Speed are prime examples of this. Weezing can remove all stat-ups via Haze while Mismagius can outspeed Speed-boosted Whiscash and cripple it with Will-O-Wisp.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Due to Whiscash's great offensive typing and acceptable movepool, it can effectively utilize Dragon Dance in order to sweep. After a Dragon Dance, Whiscash reaches 328 Speed, allowing it to outspeed up to positive-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Miltank, Houndoom, and Drapion. Waterfall is advised as the main STAB attack because of its reliability, although if you prefer the extra power, Aqua Tail can be used at the cost of lower accuracy. Earthquake is the secondary STAB move, as it is able to dent foes like Milotic and Slowbro, while also having decent coverage with Whiscash's Water-type STAB. Bounce is recommended in the final slot as it allows Whiscash to deal with Grass-types that would otherwise wall this set, although Stone Edge can be utilized if you want Whiscash to hit Flying-types such as Altaria and Scyther for super effective damage.</p> <p>The EV spread is standard for a physical sweeper, and it lets Whiscash just barely outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon after a boost and with an Adamant nature. Whiscash really needs the Adamant nature, since its Attack stat is otherwise unimpressive, even when boosted. In order to give Whiscash that much more oomph with its attacks, a Life Orb is equipped. Since Whiscash really won't be tanking hits very well anyway, the recoil is no big deal.</p> <p>Entry hazard support is extremely useful for Whiscash, as said support will help it dent foes more heavily while also getting KOs on certain Pokemon if they have taken previous damage. Similarly, dual screens support is a good idea to use on your team as it will help Whiscash set up much more easily on a wider array of opposing Pokemon. In addition, including Pokemon that can deal with bulky Water- and Grass-types, Whiscash's number one counters, is a great idea as they will allow Whiscash to more efficiently execute its sweep. Defensive variants of Moltres and Arcanine are great Pokemon to help deal with Grass-types, while Venusaur and Sceptile can help with bulky Water-types like Milotic. Finally, including a Pokemon that can take status is useful, as status conditions will sink Whiscash's already unsteady ship. RestTalk Arcanine is a great example of a Pokemon that can perform this role sufficiently while also hitting those Grass-types hard.</p>"

  "Crawdaunt": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Crawdaunt seems to have quite a bit going for it: strong STAB moves, great mixed attacking stats, and a movepool with gems such as Dragon Dance and Swords Dance. However, a closer look reveals some equally serious problems. Its defenses are average at best, and its Speed borders on pitiful. Despite these downfalls, Crawdaunt can become a threatening force in UU with proper support, and should by no means be underestimated.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swords Dance can be used to an extent, although the amount of support it requires to effectively sweep is extremely prohibitive to its success. While Crawdaunt may have the offensive stats to go mixed, it has neither the Speed nor the bulk to pull off a set successfully. Crawdaunt is decent as a Trick Room sweeper, but it is generally outclassed by the heavier-hitting Rhyperior and Azumarill.</p> <p>Rock Slide can hit Flying-types hard, especially Altaria. Knock Off allows Crawdaunt to support its team, but this role is better left to Drapion. Brick Break is a weaker Fighting-type move that does not lower Crawdaunt's physical stats, but Superpower is generally superior as Crawdaunt is more of a hit-and-run attacker on the Choice Band set. Night Slash is an option over Crunch if you feel like abusing its high critical hit rate. Crabhammer is a more powerful Water-type attack than Waterfall, but has lower accuracy, making it a less reliable option. Payback can hit hard on the switch, but two Crunches will do more on average than two Paybacks, as the second one will be weaker. Endeavor can weaken the opposing Pokemon as a last resort, but Crawdaunt is too slow for it to be effective. Due to its great base 90 Special Attack, Crawdaunt could use special attacks such as Surf, Ice Beam, Dark Pulse, and Hidden Power Grass to surprise its foes. However, running a pure special attacking set would make Crawdaunt quite inferior to the physical sets once the surprise has been shown, and utilizing a mixed set causes Crawdaunt to spread its EVs in three different locations, which greatly degrades Crawdaunt's ability to sweep.</p> <p>Crawdaunt's ability is a matter of personal preference. Shell Armor prevents critical hits, allowing Crawdaunt to switch in on moves such as Night Slash and Shadow Claw with near impunity, while Hyper Cutter prevents Intimidate users like Hitmontop and Arcanine from lowering Crawdaunt's damage output. As Shell Armor is purely based on luck, Hyper Cutter is usually the preferred choice overall when it comes to sweeping.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Crawdaunt's list of bona-fide counters in UU is actually fairly small. Toxicroak and Poliwrath have very little to fear from Crawdaunt, with Aerial Ace being the only move that Crawdaunt has to land a super effective blow, while they can easily outspeed and KO Crawdaunt in return with a super effective Fighting attack. Weezing can simply switch into Crawdaunt and threaten it with Will-O-Wisp or Thunderbolt. Tangrowth and Leafeon fear almost nothing from Crawdaunt, and can OHKO it with STAB Grass attacks, although both will have to worry about taking heavy damage from boosted X-Scissor. Hitmontop can use Mach Punch to smash Crawdaunt, provided it switches in on the right move. Crawdaunt's biggest weaknesses are its low Speed and poor defenses, making it easy to revenge kill. A faster Pokemon wielding a Choice Scarf, or a Pokemon with Fighting-type priority moves, can easily finish off a weakened Crawdaunt.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>With its newly acquired move, Dragon Dance, Crawdaunt gains the ability to raise its above-average Attack and meager Speed stats. Water and Dark is a powerful type combination in UU, resisted only by Toxicroak, Cacturne, Shiftry, and Poliwrath. Crawdaunt may seem very easy to revenge kill, but it is very difficult to switch into after a Dragon Dance, as nothing enjoys taking a hit from an Attack stat of 558. Waterfall and Crunch are compulsory for their STAB and great type coverage. X-Scissor helps Crawdaunt dent some of its biggest counters: Tangrowth and Leafeon. Additionally, Taunt may be used in the last slot to stop Haze Milotic and Will-O-Wisp Weezing from spoiling Crawdaunt's fun.</p> <p>The EVs are straightforward: 252 Attack EVs are for maximum damage output, while the Speed EVs allow Adamant Crawdaunt to outspeed everything up to positive base 90s after a Dragon Dance boost. A Jolly nature is usable to outpace key threats, such as Mismagius, Scyther, and Houndoom, that target Crawdaunt's poor Special Defense. An Adamant nature is almost always the better option though, as it allows Crawdaunt to obtain several key OHKOs and 2HKOs.</p> <p>Thanks to its ability to switch between moves, Dragon Dance Crawdaunt is more difficult to counter than the Choice Band set. However, there are some hard counters that one needs to bear in mind when building a team around this Crawdaunt variant. Tangrowth and Leafeon can take Crawdaunt's hits very well with their sturdy Defense; the former can cripple it with Stun Spore, whereas the latter can destroy it with Leaf Blade. Pokemon that utilize Fighting-type priority moves, such as Blaziken, Hitmontop, and Hitmonlee, can revenge kill Crawdaunt after it sets up. Milotic can come in, erase Crawdaunt's boosts via Haze, and KO it with Hidden Power Grass. Weezing can switch in on X-Scissor, then burn Crawdaunt with Will-O-Wisp. Registeel can also take a Waterfall at full health, and proceed to smack Crawdaunt with a crippling Thunder Wave. To cover these threats, utilizing Pokemon like Moltres and Venusaur can prove useful. Moltres can switch in on Grass- and Fighting-types, Weezing, and Registeel with ease and proceed to destroy them with Fire Blast and Air Slash. Venusaur can block Milotic's advances and waste it with Leaf Storm. In addition, Venusaur provides a safe backup switch in for Grass- and Fighting-types and can sleep threats with Sleep Powder.</p> <p>Pokemon that can take specially-based Electric- and Grass-type attacks are effective partners to this set. Such partners include Registeel, Chansey, and Exeggutor. Blaziken also makes a great teammate, as Crawdaunt weakens the bulky Waters that prevent Blaziken from sweeping. Life Orb Arcanine is another good choice, as it dents Registeel, Leafeon, and Tangrowth with its STAB Fire-type attacks. Claydol can take Electric- and Fighting-type hits for Crawdaunt, and put the hurt on Hitmonlee, Hitmontop, and Blaziken with Psychic. Stealth Rock is a necessity for Crawdaunt, and Spikes may also be used to weaken walls such as Registeel, putting them into Waterfall's KO range. Toxic Spikes are another useful tool for their ability to cripple Tangrowth and Leafeon.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Crawdaunt's high Attack and excellent physical movepool make it a decent Choice Band user that can outspeed and bulldoze many common UU walls. Crunch should be treated as the primary move on this set, as nothing is immune to or 4x resists it, and it has a chance of lowering the opposing Pokemon's Defense. Waterfall is a strong and reliable secondary STAB move, and it gets excellent neutral coverage with Crunch. The last two moveslots are mostly filler, but they can be useful for certain situations. Superpower smites Registeel, while also OHKOing Chansey and Clefable. X-Scissor is the strongest move that Crawdaunt has against Tangrowth and Leafeon (although it will fail to OHKO either); Return has nice neutral coverage and power; and Aerial Ace is worth consideration because it hits Toxicroak, which would otherwise have an easy time switching into and setting up on Crawdaunt.</p> <p>Choice Band Crawdaunt greatly appreciates entry hazard support, which is best provided by Gligar and Qwilfish due to their great defensive synergy with Crawdaunt. Paralysis support is also greatly appreciated, as it makes Crawdaunt's job much easier. Rotom, Uxie, or Tangrowth make good choices for providing this. Since paralysis support is so useful, Body Slam can be considered, but its mediocre Base Power when compared to Return is a major turn-off.</p> <p>Because the Choice Band restricts Crawdaunt's freedom to switch between moves, it must rely on prediction to get the job done. Bringing Crawdaunt in early in the game is not a good idea, as you will have no idea what Pokemon your opponent plans to counter it with. Save it for mid- to late-game, when you have scouted your opponent's counters and have a good idea of how they'll react to Crawdaunt. The EV spread may seem odd due to Crawdaunt's atrocious Speed, but it's actually quite necessary; maximum Speed EVs allow Crawdaunt to tie with Exeggutor, while outspeeding minimum Speed Milotic. Most UU walls lurk around that speed tier, so hitting it is critical.</p>"

  "Claydol": {
    "overview": "<p>Claydol is best described as quite a mixed bag. It has impressive defensive stats but mediocre offensive stats, six excellent resistances but six crippling weaknesses, and a vast movepool but little to take advantage of it with. It is one of the best support Pokemon in the game, with access to Stealth Rock, Rapid Spin, and dual screens, as well as less commonly seen methods of support such as Trick Room and Rain Dance. In addition to this, it can wall a great number of Pokemon, and its defensive stats allow it to take hits from both sides and come in on a wide variety of opponents. Also, it has access to moves such as Calm Mind as well as reliable offensive moves, which includes desirable STAB Ground-type moves. It is as unpredictable as the British weather and can be quite as depressing for the opponent's team.</p> <p>On the downside however, Claydol's many weaknesses are often its undoing. All six weaknesses are to very common types, and the Pokemon who use them are often very common as well; for example, Venusaur, Milotic, Moltres, and Mismagius are all top-flight Pokemon who Claydol is almost always beaten by. This is also the area where Claydol's lack of offense comes back to haunt it, meaning that many Pokemon are not as threatened by it as they otherwise could be.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Claydol seemingly has an endless array of support moves. It learns both Rain Dance and Sunny Day, but its utility on these teams is limited, as it receives no boost itself from weather. Ways for Claydol to boost its stats include Rock Polish, which is generally outclassed by Trick Room, and Cosmic Power, allowing it to slowly become an impenetrable fortress over time, especially when in tandem with RestTalk, but also leave it exposed to boosting sweepers such as Swords Dance Absol and critical hits. RestTalk can be used on its own too, but this gives Claydol a serious case of moveslot syndrome.</p> <p>Zen Headbutt is Claydol's only physical Psychic STAB, and having no great coverage is not usually worth the moveslot. Rock Slide is an alternative to Stone Edge on physical sets if you dislike Stone Edge's accuracy. On the special side, Shadow Ball hits Ghosts who may try to block Rapid Spin, in particular Mismagius and Rotom, and Toxic is a nice weapon to use against the bulky Water-types who may attempt to switch in. In the same vein, Grass Knot can also be used against heavier Water-types in general.</p> <p>Claydol is primarily a defensive Pokemon, and as such maximum HP is a must on all of its sets, as it will frequently be required to check opponents on both sides. After this, most of the remaining EVs should be placed in Defense, as Claydol is going to need it to take on powerful Fighting- and Ground-types. Some EVs should also be placed into Special Attack or Special Defense, and Claydol has the potential to run Speed EVs as well to outspeed slower threats since it is one of the faster walls at 75 base Speed. In particular, 60 EVs allow you to outrun 16 Speed Rash Blaziken, whom you can usually OHKO with STAB Earth Power or Psychic, as well as 0 Speed Milotic. If you wish to invest more heavily, 108 Speed outspeeds most bulky Milotic, Torterra, and 64 Speed Blaziken.</p> <p>The Calm Mind set requires a great deal of Special Attack in order to maximize damage output, and Speed EVs are generally also advised here since Claydol can benefit greatly from outspeeding certain key threats and dealing damage before it can be harmed. For Trick Room, Claydol is inclined to be more offensive, so maximum Attack is usually the best choice along with a Brave nature to make it more effective under Trick Room, although a Relaxed nature is also plausible if you want a more defensive Claydol. You should also use a Speed IV of 0 in order to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible under Trick Room conditions.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The best counters for Claydol are generally bulky Water-types who can take its moves with ease; for example, Milotic works very well, taking little damage from Earth Power and resisting Ice Beam while able to hit back with STAB Surf. Spiritomb does not have any notable resistances but can block Claydol's attempts to Rapid Spin and eliminate it with Pursuit if it tries to flee. Grass-types such as Venusaur also work very well, and although Venusaur itself does not resist Earth Power, it takes little damage from unboosted Ice Beams and can outspeed and hit back with STAB Leaf Storm. Scyther is immune to Earth Power and both it and Absol can OHKO with their STAB moves, but Scyther fears Ice Beam and Stone Edge, while Absol will not enjoy taking repeated Earth Powers.</p> <p>In general, most Pokemon who can hit Claydol hard can check it, as its offensive stats are not great. Mismagius is immune to Earth Power and can deal serious damage to Claydol with Shadow Ball, though it must be wary of Claydol's own Shadow Ball. Azumarill and Feraligatr can take an Ice Beam and attack back with STAB Waterfall. Lastly, if Claydol lacks Ice Beam or Shadow Ball, other Claydol may pose a problem.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Rapid Spin is the core move of this set, and can be used with any team style, while Claydol's natural bulk combined with the lack of damage taken from all entry hazards allow it to get its job done with ease. Claydol can also set up Stealth Rock itself, thereby doing two support jobs in one team slot. Claydol's relative indifference to Fighting- and Ground-type moves means that it can usually afford to switch into Hitmontop or Donphan as they spin, and then either set up Stealth Rock again as they run, or kill them with STAB Psychic or Ice Beam.</p> <p>Of its two STAB choices, a Ground-type move gives the best coverage. Claydol can use both physical and special moves equally well - however, while Earthquake has more power on paper, Earth Power is preferable for several reasons. Firstly, many Pokemon who Claydol will be aiming at are hit harder on the special side. Secondly, most of the important moves that Claydol should be using in the last slot are special moves, and having both moves working off the same attacking stat means that you do not have to split EVs. For the last slot, there are a number of choices depending on what you feel threatens Claydol the most. Psychic is a reasonably good secondary STAB, Ice Beam has the best coverage alongside Earth Power, while Shadow Ball is useful to hit Ghosts who try to block Rapid Spin.</p> <p>Psychic is the first option as a secondary STAB move, allowing Claydol to take on Fighting-types much more easily, but does not have any notable cohesion with Earth Power. Ice Beam offers far more in coverage, creating an unresisted Ice + Ground move combination. In particular, Ice Beam allows Claydol to hit Swellow and other Flying-types, as well as Grass-types who resist Earth Power, for super effective damage. Shadow Ball hits Ghost-types coming in to block Rapid Spin; however, it cannot touch Swellow. Lastly, Toxic is an option to cripple Spiritomb or Milotic on the switch.</p> <p>For the EVs, you should first max out HP, as Claydol is noted for being able to wall attacks from both ends with reasonable success. As for the rest, allocating a reasonable amount to Defense, as well as a Bold nature, is the advisable course of action to take since Claydol is primarily a physical wall; 144 Defense EVs give Claydol about equal defensive stats on both ends, while the remainder is pushed into Special Attack to bolster Claydol's otherwise quite average offense.</p> <p>Claydol itself is a good check to many physical attackers because it resists Close Combat, Stone Edge, and Earthquake. Thus, it makes an excellent partner to boosting sweepers such as Absol and Kabutops, who are more than happy to let Claydol dispose of Fighting-type foes while also setting up Stealth Rock to support the sweepers. Claydol's access to Rapid Spin benefits Pokemon who are weak to Stealth Rock; for example, Moltres and Scyther both greatly value the removal of the rocks, as they would be the death of them without a spinner. Other Rock-weak Pokemon such as Swellow and Arcanine also value Stealth Rock's absence, saving them a great deal of health. Choice Band Spiritomb makes an excellent partner, as not only can it trap and OHKO Ghost-types such as Mismagius and Rotom with STAB Pursuit, but it can also use its own Ghost typing to block any Rapid Spin attempts made by the opponent, keeping Claydol's Stealth Rock on the field. For these reasons, Spiritomb is Claydol's best friend and worst enemy from a strategic point of view.</p> <p>The most effective way to deal with an opposing Spiritomb is generally to employ a Fire-type wallbreaker, such as Blaziken or Arcanine, who can dispose of it with Fire Blast or Flare Blitz respectively, and have the benefits of being immune to Will-O-Wisp and possessed of a Dark-type resistance or Intimidate respectively. Due to Claydol's numerous weaknesses, there are a wide variety of offensive Pokemon who give Claydol trouble, the most common being Mismagius, Venusaur, and Milotic. Specially defensive Registeel can deal with the former two, as well as being a good check to Swellow and Scyther. It also has good defensive synergy with Claydol, as it resists five of Claydol's six weaknesses while Claydol resists two of Registeel's three weaknesses, without them sharing a single weakness. Together, they resist 15 of the 17 types in the game. The two unresisted types are Fire and Water, and as such a bulky Water-type can be useful. Milotic is one of the best choices since it has good all-round defensive stats, access to Recover and can take Water and Ice attacks aimed at Claydol with ease, as well as taking Fire attacks aimed at Registeel. Opposing Water-types can be dealt with through Grass-types, so including Venusaur or Sceptile on your team would be a good investment, though you must be careful as it will make you susceptible to Moltres. Stealth Rock whittles Moltres and other Flying-types down quite quickly, allowing you to usually bring it down with repeated assaults, if you lack a bulky Water-type such as Milotic.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Claydol has access to Calm Mind as well as STAB Earth Power, allowing it to perform the role of a bulky setup sweeper. Thanks to its good bulk and resistances, Claydol can come in on something it frightens and begin setting up. Claydol is usually weaker to special attackers, but by boosting its Special Defense stat it can survive most major assaults and return fire with its own moves. Claydol can then recover health and remove status using Rest, the major drawback of which can be negated once by using Chesto Berry for the item.</p> <p>Calm Mind boosts Claydol's decent Special Defense stat while also raising its rather average Special Attack stat to make it an offensive threat. Earth Power is Claydol's most useful special STAB option. For its second offensive move, STAB Psychic is a strong choice, as greater overall power is more important to Calm Mind Claydol than super effective coverage. Earth Power hits the Steel-types who resist Psychic, as well as Houndoom and Drapion, for super effective damage while Psychic hits common Grass-types such as Venusaur, as well as Weezing, for super effective damage. For the last slot, Rest is the primary option, giving Claydol a bit more durability, recovering lost HP, and also preventing the opponent from attempting to stall you out with Toxic.</p> <p>For other options, Ice Beam has the best coverage with Earth Power, hitting Grass-types and Flying-types for super effective damage. In the item slot a Chesto Berry is used in order to wake Claydol up immediately after the use of Rest. The reason why a Lum Berry is not used is because the Chesto Berry cannot be accidentally removed by a different status condition. Claydol is given maximum Special Attack EVs, as otherwise it is unlikely to be doing any serious damage even when boosted. After that enough EVs are allocated to Speed to beat 52 Spe Blaziken and everything slower, although you do also have the alternative of running 108 EVs in order to beat 56 Spe Milotic and Adamant Torterra. 160 EVs are given to HP, which is important as Claydol gains a HP stat of 301. This means that it can take three Seismic Tosses, allowing it to set up on Chansey by alternating between Calm Mind and Rest. Although Claydol cannot ever 2HKO Chansey even when at +6, both Earth Power and Psychic have a chance to lower Chansey's Special Defense, so it is likely that Claydol will win the stall-war.</p> <p>Without Shadow Ball, Mismagius can Calm Mind up alongside Claydol and destroy it with its own Shadow Ball. Registeel makes a good check to most Mismagius but it cannot beat Substitute + Charge Beam Rotom, who can be revenge killed by Pokemon such as Pursuit Dugtrio and specially defensive Drapion. You will also want a way to beat the bulky Water-types who love to switch into Claydol, whom Registeel and Milotic both cannot beat either. Specially defensive Venusaur makes a great check to almost all bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Slowbro, taking even the most powerful Ice Beams with ease, recovering health with Synthesis, and killing with STAB Energy Ball or Power Whip.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Claydol's versatility as a lead allows it to pull off a Trick-oriented set quite effectively. Tricking is only half the fun; deciding how to capitalize on your opponent's misfortune is the second part of this set's strategy.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is always welcome on any team, but the two remaining moves are more dependent on the rest of your team. The moves listed are obviously the most general, since all teams enjoy Rapid Spin support and Earth Power / Explosion allows Claydol to attack after Tricking away its Choice Scarf. However, many other utility moves can be used in lieu of these moves. Claydol has access to dual screens which can come in handy on offensive teams that employ fragile sweepers, and can use Toxic to shorten the life expectancy of enemy walls. No matter how you decide to use Claydol, its reliability as a team supporter cannot be ignored.</p> <p>The given EV spread helps Claydol switch in against strong physical threats, like Aggron, Donphan, and Hitmonchan. However, if Claydol is using Explosion (or any other physical attack) in its moveset, use an Impish nature instead of Bold.</p> <p>Claydol has troubles with a few other popular leads, including Alakazam, Ambipom, Mesprit (especially Trick variants), and Uxie. Luckily, all of these Pokemon can be countered by one teammate: Choice Band Spiritomb. Spiritomb has no troubles switching in against these threats and Pursuiting them as they try to switch out. Other than these leads, however, Claydol should be able to pull off its strategy without a hitch.</p> <p>Pokemon locked into one attack make prime setup fodder. Teammates such as Venusaur, Rhyperior, or other boosting Pokemon or Substitute users have no problem switching in and setting up. Be wary of switching in blindly, however; many players will switch out their Tricked Pokemon if they feel threatened. Luckily, common leads such as Cloyster and Omastar will stay in and continue to lay down entry hazards, lessening the chance of a blind switch. Choice-locked Pokemon are also prime candidates for Dugtrio, whose Arena Trap makes picking them off simple. The shared Water weakness between Claydol and Dugtrio should not be overlooked, however, and should be covered by the rest of your team. It should be mentioned that Tricking your opponent's lead may not always be the best way to go about using Claydol; locking walls or boosting sweepers such as Chansey and Swords Dance Venusaur into non-attacking moves may be just as important as setting up Stealth Rock or dual screens at the beginning of the match.</p>"
      },
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Claydol's pure support set is about as far as you can go in terms of team support. This set's only concern is bringing the full force of Claydol's movepool onto the opponent very early in the game and by using Claydol's impressive defensive capabilities in tandem with its excellent support movepool to make an early sweep possible by a fast, powerful boosting sweeper such as Nasty Plot Mismagius or Swords Dance Scyther.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is used to support the team, allowing your sweepers to get the necessary OHKOs and 2HKOs that they may not achieve otherwise. It also breaks any Focus Sashes that your opponent may be trying to hide. Reflect and Light Screen make up the popular 'dual screen' combination, shielding your team from attacks. Explosion is your final move, and grants your sweeper a free switch after Claydol's death. Light Clay increases the duration of Light Screen and Reflect by three turns, and is the item of choice on this set, while Lum Berry is the other recommended item, allowing you to live through Venusaur's Sleep Powder, though admittedly it could also simply attack with Energy Ball or Power Whip.</p> <p>The set is most effectively used as a lead, where the idea is to set up both screens and Stealth Rock, and then Explode on your opponent's face, taking down or weakening one of your opponent's Pokemon and allowing your sweeper to come in for free. From there, your sweeper can boost up and take down the rest of your opponent's team. With Light Clay, assuming you have used Light Screen, Reflect, and Stealth Rock, with a turn to explode and a turn to set up once with your sweeper, you still have three turns of Reflect and two turns of Light Screen left, hopefully granting you enough time to wreak irreparable damage and allowing your team to clean up where your sweeper left off. A Calm nature and high Special Defense EVs allows you to take beatings from specially-inclined leads before falling thanks to Claydol's impressive Special Defense stat, assuming Claydol used Reflect first. 80 Defense EVs are invested to give Claydol reasonable defensive stats on both sides.</p> <p>The order you use dual screens should be determined by the sweeper you intend to send in; for example, Dragon Dance Altaria is quite weak on the physical side, so Reflect should be used first, just in case you are knocked out next turn. As previously mentioned, setup sweepers work best alongside this Claydol variant, coming in immediately after Claydol has Exploded and setting up stat boosts under the protection of Claydol's lingering screens. Nasty Plot Mismagius works well within this capacity, being able to set up more bulky Substitutes and boost its Special Attack. Another tactic is to use Claydol in tandem with a Baton Passer such as Scyther to set up a Swords Dance or Agility before passing it off to another powerful Pokemon, though this tactic requires much skill and half your team to pull off. The most likely ways that this strategy will fail are if your opponent has a Taunt lead such as Ambipom or Electrode, completely shutting Claydol down, or a Pokemon with Brick Break, who can make your efforts all for naught in one turn.</p>"
      },
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Claydol's good overall defensive stats it makes for a top choice Trick Room activator in Underused, giving it another way to support its teammates. With a Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs Claydol reaches 139 Speed, enough to outspeed all Pokemon of base 55 Speed or higher under Trick Room, with its offensive moves able to cause some trouble to the opponent's team.</p> <p>Explosion acts as a single safe switch for your Trick Room sweeper, though generally Claydol will not want to sacrifice itself so quickly until late-game, as its bulk means it can usually set up Trick Room more than once per game. This leaves you with two moveslots, giving you a choice of combination between Ice Beam and Earth Power or Stone Edge and Earthquake. To avoid splitting EVs, as Earthquake and Explosion are both physical attacks, the \"EdgeQuake\" combination is the preferred set of moves here.</p> <p>A Brave nature lowers Claydol's Speed, a useful tactic on a Trick Room team, while increasing Claydol's Attack. To maximize Attack, 252 EVs are invested, as well as 252 EVs in HP to promote overall bulk, while the leftover EVs are slotted into Defense. A Speed IV of 0 is used to minimize your Speed stat for optimal efficiency under Trick Room conditions.</p> <p>One of the great benefits of using Trick Room is that its effects are carried on to the next Pokemon, allowing it a maximum of four turns of wrecking time. On the physical side, Rampardos has a massive Attack stat and can destroy almost any Pokemon it walks into, with its low Speed and horrible defensive stats made up for by Trick Room, allowing it to outspeed most competition. Marowak is also extremely powerful, with its signature item Thick Club boosting its Attack, allowing it to fire off very powerful STAB Earthquakes. Rhyperior has strong STAB moves and a good offensive typing as well as decent defensive stats and access to Swords Dance, with its poor Speed now an extra bonus. Ursaring, too, has Swords Dance and can use a Flame Orb to activate Guts, also granting it a 140 Base Power STAB move in the form of Facade to use off its 130 base Attack stat. On the special side, Clamperl works a lot like Marowak, with its signature item DeepSeaTooth boosting its Special Attack to a maximum of 540, added to the fact that it is faster than almost anything else under Trick Room. Glaceon is another good special choice, being able to fire off powerful Ice Beams from its base 130 Special Attack stat, and its low Speed now considered a great asset.</p>"

  "Cradily": {
    "overview": "<p>Cradily has improved vastly with the additions of Platinum and HGSS, which imbued it with Seed Bomb and Curse, respectively. These moves have allowed it to find a niche in the lower tiers as a bulky sweeper, while remaining a formidable wall on sandstorm teams. Cradily can be incredibly potent when used effectively, as most teams are unprepared to take it on. However, many sets require strong team support (namely Hippopotas) to be used to their full potential.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cradily can utilize Mirror Coat to score some surprise KOs on unsuspecting opponents. Its combination of high Special Defense and a reliable recovery move make it a respectable and durable user of the strategy, but unfortunately most opponents will attack Cradily from the physical side, especially in a sandstorm. There are still plenty of opponents, however, that would feel comfortable wearing down Cradily with special attacks, such as Alakazam, Mismagius, and offensive variants of Milotic. Cradily takes all of their super effective attacks with ease and can OHKO back with Mirror Coat in some scenarios. Cradily also gets access to Confuse Ray, which can be used alongside or in place of Toxic on the Support set to rack up damage on opponents. If used on the switch, it can also leave physical sweepers with a nice parting gift, since they will generally be the most likely switch-ins to Cradily.</p> <p>Rock Polish can be used to achieve a respectable Speed stat, but unfortunately, Cradily might not know what to do with it without a significant Attack boost. This strategy is probably best left to its fellow Rock-types Rhyperior and Aggron. Cradily's Attack and Special Attack stats are equal at base 81, but its special movepool borders on disgraceful and can really only be made useful with copious boosts passed to it.</p> <p>As far as EVs go, maxing out HP is a wise choice on any Cradily, unless Speed is required to pull off a sweep. For Curse variants, it relies on its bulk to sweep, and since Attack and Defense will be boosted, pouring all its EVs into HP and Special Defense is the recommended choice. For the support set, the EVs should be split between its defenses as needed after maxing out HP. The Support set likes as much Defense as possible to compensate for its inferior base stat, but still needs enough Special Defense to fulfill Cradily's role as a Special Wall. The suggested 252 HP / 96 Def / 160 SpD spread allows Cradily to survive two Life Orbed +2 Hidden Power Fighting from Mismagius, as well as any other unboosted special attack in UU.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fighting-types in general give Cradily major problems and should usually send it running for the hills. Nearly all of them will be throwing physical attacks at Cradily, which does not suit Cradily's stat distribution at all. Toxicroak in particular can essentially come in on Cradily for free, as it resists everything but the rare Earthquake, and Nasty Plot or throw up a Sub, knowing Cradily can do nothing but switch. Similarly, anything with Superpower can probably 2HKO Cradily at worst if Cradily has not Cursed multiple times. With Low Kick's rising popularity in UU, it is worth noting that this move hits Cradily for 80 Base Power. This is safely out of OHKO range for any of its likely users with the exception of Adamant Choice Band Aggron, which has a decent chance to OHKO.</p> <p>Registeel can come in and wall anything Cradily throws at it, assuming that something isn't a rare Earthquake. It will also likely have Iron Head, which both hits Cradily for super effective damage and has a 30% chance to flinch. Weezing is an especially unwelcome switch-in to Curse variants, as it can Haze or Will-O-Wisp Cradily, while taking its attacks with ease. Rhyperior can also take Rock Slides easily and pummel Cradily with Megahorn, but must watch out for Seed Bomb.</p> <p>In general, it is quite easy to switch into Cradily while its stats remain unboosted, due to its mediocre Attack and a Speed stat worthy of a Pokemon with no legs that can't swim or fly. However, once the Curses begin, Cradily can be very hard to stop, and if unprepared, you might see your possible switch-ins go from half your team to zero in no time at all.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mono-Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>The addition of Curse to its movepool really gave Cradily a new lease on life. Curse lets Cradily not only boost its Attack, but also allow its Defense to catch up to its already stellar Special Defense (when boosted by sandstorm). Coupled with its unique ability, Suction Cups, a deadly combination is spawned.</p> <p>The goal of this set is to slowly accrue Curses, using Cradily's bulk to take attacks while gaining Attack and Defense. Cradily is very difficult to take down, as it is free to Rest as often as it pleases, allowing it to absorb status as well as take most attacks. Sleep Talk allows Cradily to stack Curses or fire off Rock Slides while sleeping, meaning that the longer Cradily is in, the more difficult it will be to take down. Although it may seem as though a Pokemon like Milotic could switch in easily and Ice Beam away, the reality is that unless the opposing Pokemon carries extremely powerful super effective special attacks, Cradily will take shockingly low damage from them, as its Special Defense will be sky-high in sandstorm (where it should always be used).</p> <p>This set can be very difficult to stop once it begins setting up, so it can be quite difficult to counter, but an assortment of moves and Pokemon can easily stand in its way. First and foremost, Fighting-types will stop it in its tracks, as they can switch in for free the instant Cradily begins using Curse. Unless Cradily has stacked three or more Curses, it should get out of the way of Fighting-type attacks, leaving them for its teammates, that should be well-equipped to take them on. Other powerful physical attackers, such as Aggron and Rhyperior, can also get the job done, assuming they don't switch in too late. Registeel completely walls Cradily, assuming it either has Curse, to boost alongside Cradily, or Rest, to PP stall Cradily. If it has neither of these moves, Cradily can prevail in a lengthy battle, barring some bad luck.</p> <p>After these Pokemon, stopping Cradily gets a whole lot trickier. Haze is hands-down the best option, as Cradily can do absolutely nothing to stop it. Encore is a great bet because Cradily is so slow that you can simply switch a Pokemon into three of its four moves and use Encore. Fortunately for Cradily, both of these moves are relatively rare, and their potential users are few and easily identified. Taunt can either prevent Cradily from Resting or setting up in the first place, but it cannot check Cradily once it has built up enough Curses; by that point Cradily can attack and take hits until the Taunt wears off. Tricking a Choice item onto Cradily devastates it, so Cradily should proceed with extreme caution around Pokemon like Uxie, Mesprit, and Rotom.</p> <p>Rather than getting Cradily in as soon as it is convenient, the best way to ensure Cradily sweeps is to play semi-stall in the early stages of the match, attempting to identify the Pokemon that can halt Cradily's impending onslaught. From there your goal should be to knock out or neutralize these foes in any way possible, and use Cradily sparingly until late in the match when the coast is clear. When used correctly, Cradily should have little trouble making mince meat out of your opponent's team.</p> <p>It is worth noting that Regirock can run an identical set, but with over double the physical Defense. Cradily, however, boasts neutralities to Water-, Grass-, and Ground-type attacks, which are critical for surviving onslaughts from special attacking Pokemon like Sceptile and Life Orb Milotic. Suction Cups also sets it apart from Regirock and all other Curse users by preventing it from being Roared out by Pokemon like Donphan or Steelix.</p>"
      },
      "ChestoRest": {
        "description": "<p>While the previous set requires Cradily to stack quite a few Curses to take on opponents, this one allows the set up process to be hastened by adding a second attack, and thus, better type coverage. The addition of Seed Bomb allows Cradily to take on bulky Pokemon, such as Milotic, Donphan, and Rhyperior without having to maximize its Attack stat, as you can now hit them for super effective or neutral damage. In addition, Seed Bomb is a more reliable attack, as it has 100% accuracy (Rock Slide is the preferred move on the mono-attacking set due to superior type coverage).</p> <p>The key to this set is essentially to use Curse as many times as possible before being forced to Rest, then awaken instantly and sweep. This is quite different from the gradual process discussed in the last set, yet it plays quite similarly for the most part. The main difference is that Cradily can begin attacking earlier, and only stack excess Curses when it is convenient, rather than attempting to nearly maximize its stats before sweeping. The advantage of this set is that your opponent basically has less time to \"react\", meaning that Encore and Taunt will be futile once Cradily is a few Curses deep and free to begin attacking.</p> <p>In general, the same counters and team options for the last set apply to this set. Fighting-types, Encore, Haze, and Registeel with Curse or Rest can still bring Cradily to a halt when used properly. Due to the absence of recovery from Leftovers, Seismic Toss is a 4HKO, which can cause problems for Cradily if it is asleep and at low health. Steelix, Aggron, and Rhyperior are now considerably less threatening, as Cradily can hit them neutrally with Seed Bomb (or 4x effectively in Rhyperior's case), but it will need Curses under its belt to beat the latter two due to their high Attack stats. Note that status becomes slightly more of an issue for Cradily once its Chesto Berry has been used, but again, chances are, it will be able to Rest multiple times with sufficient boosts from Curse.</p>"
      },
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>This is the classic Cradily set, which handles special assaults as well as nearly any Pokemon in UU with sandstorm support. Its great typing, above average defenses, and access to Recover make it a very formidable wall. The strategy is simple: switch in on a special attacker like Mismagius or Milotic, shrug off their attacks, and hit them with Toxic or an attack when appropriate.</p> <p>There are very few special attackers Cradily does not beat or stall out with relative ease. It does, however, need to watch out for status moves on this set. Toxic is especially problematic, as Cradily cannot cure itself like it can on sets with Rest. This is the one downside to Recover, which otherwise gives Cradily remarkable longevity. Using Pokemon with Heal Bell or Aromatherapy on your team can allow you to use Cradily much more fearlessly.</p> <p>The last slot is a matter of preference and depends on what you want Cradily to do. Hippopotas should be your team's Stealth Rock user, assuming you are running a sandstorm team. If this is the case, Seed Bomb complements Cradily's Rock-type move nicely, providing excellent type coverage. It also allows Cradily to hit Pokemon like Steelix and Aggron, which would otherwise laugh at all of its moves. Protect can also be viable in this slot, as it simultaneously allows Cradily to restore its health with Leftovers and let passive damage from poison and sandstorm wear down its opponent.</p> <p>The suggested EV spread ensures that a Life Orb-boosted +2 Hidden Power Fighting from Mismagius is a 3HKO in a sandstorm. However, the EVs on the defenses can be tweaked as needed. The more Defense EVs that can be spared, the better, but Cradily's primary objective is to be your team's special wall and should be EVed as such.</p>"
      },
      "Stockpile": {
        "description": "<p>This set is quite similar to the last, with one large change: Stockpile. Stockpile lets Cradily boost both of its defenses up to +3 (Stockpile's limit), at which point it is nearly impossible to take down with unboosted attacks. Unlike the previous set, this one is designed to function outside of sandstorm, although sandstorm support is certainly a plus. This set also makes use of Suction Cups, as Cradily would normally be an easy target for phazing moves.</p> <p>Toxic and Recover are givens on this set, as Cradily's primary goal is to stall out opponents with poison damage. Toxic is Cradily's main method of racking up damage, which it can do easily after it has boosted its defenses sky high with Stockpile. Against many opponents, Cradily can simply laugh as they throw themselves at it with unsuccessful attacks while their HP slips away. The nature and EVs allow Cradily to be a more balanced staller, as its Defense and Special Defense are equalized.</p> <p>The attack to supplement Toxic is a matter of preference. Earthquake may appear a little out of place on this set, but it allows Cradily to beat Poison- and Steel-types, which is critical as they are immune to Toxic. Rock Slide is, of course, Cradily's typical STAB option and has good neutral type coverage. The EVs here are designed to equalize Cradily's defenses, as it will need to take special and physical hits equally in order to stall out as many different Pokemon as possible. If you plan to use this set with sandstorm support, all of Cradily's EVs can be committed to Defense, as sandstorm and Stockpile will give it more than enough Special Defense to work with.</p> <p>Entry hazards work extremely well alongside this set and are important to its success. Opponents will naturally want to switch out soon after they are poisoned, so entry hazards will both discourage and punish this course of action. Spikes also allow Cradily to handle Steel-types better. Omastar and Qwilfish are also good options to fill this role. Omastar receives a boost to its mediocre Special Defense in sandstorm while Qwilfish is noteworthy for its resistances to every single one of Cradily's weaknesses, although unfortunately, its defenses hardly allow it to even take resisted attacks. If you do not opt for Earthquake on Cradily, most Steel-types can be dealt with efficiently by Magneton, that can trap and beat them. If you want to use this set with sandstorm support, then Hippopotas will, of course, be a necessary component of your team.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>This set is designed to make Cradily an offensive threat outside of sandstorm, where the Curse sets dare not stray. Although using two moves to boost its stats may seem like overkill, the unique combination of Suction Cups, Recover, and balanced all-around stats makes Cradily the perfect Pokemon to do it. Possessing two stat boosting moves is also convenient because it gives you the freedom to choose what Cradily boosts, which can be very beneficial in many situations.</p> <p>Due to its bulk and instant recovery move, Cradily will find it quite easy to switch into a lot of Pokemon, although it must be cautious of status moves. Once it finds a Pokemon it can set up on, Cradily can begin to boost its stats, typically starting with Stockpile to defend itself against powerful attackers. After multiple Stockpiles, Cradily is extremely difficult to take down in two hits, meaning it will be able to Recover away most damage it takes. When it is convenient, Cradily should have little trouble using Swords Dance multiple times to boost its Attack to high levels. Rock Slide is yet again the preferred option on this set, due to its superior neutral type coverage over Seed Bomb.</p> <p>Status ruins this set, which is unfortunate because Cradily is too slow to do anything to prevent it. Therefore, clerics, and even Safeguard users, make great partners for this set. Altaria makes a good teammate, as it can use Heal Bell and Safeguard, although not on the same set. It also resists Fighting- and Bug-type attacks, which Cradily is weak to, and can absorb status moves thanks to Natural Cure. Like the other offensive variants, Cradily struggles to deal with Registeel, and users of Encore, Haze, and Trick. Fighting-types are, as always, a huge problem for this set, even with the Impish nature, as Cradily fails to hit them very hard with Rock Slide. For this reason Ghost-types make good partners, as they are immune to Fighting assaults and can Will-O-Wisp in return.</p>"
      },
      "Baton Pass Receiver": {
        "description": "<p>Like its aquatic counterpart, Octillery, Cradily is a good Baton Pass receiver due to its excellent ability, Suction Cups. Although it lacks the raw power of other Baton Pass candidates, it brings great typing and impressive bulk to the table. Furthermore, the attacking combination of Rock and Grass provides nearly flawless neutral type coverage in UU, resisted only by Registeel and Toxicroak.</p> <p>Despite Cradily's miserable Speed stat, 252 EVs and an Agility boost will vault it into the upper echelon of UU, allowing it to reach a Speed stat of 370, which outspeeds maximum Speed base 115s. A +1 boost allows it to reach 277 Speed and beat maximum Speed Hitmonchan, neutral natured Hitmonlee, maximum Speed base 75s, and neutral natured base 85s. If you are not concerned with its poor Speed, those EVs can be dumped into HP to increase Cradily's durability.</p> <p>Cradily needs all the power it can muster in order to score OHKOs, so Stone Edge gets the nod over Rock Slide, although the latter is still a good option for its accuracy. The third moveslot in this set is really a matter of preference. Earthquake provides even better type coverage, and is notable for its ability to hit Registeel and Aggron. Swords Dance helps to boost Cradily's power and sweeping ability, and is especially valuable if your team struggles to pass Attack boosts, which Cradily will certainly need in order to sweep. Toxic can help get rid of pesky defensive Pokemon that can Recover or Rest away the attacks you throw at them.</p> <p>One thing Cradily does not have going for it is its vulnerability to priority moves. Life Orb TechniTop will deal an average of 80% damage with Mach Punch, while Leftovers variants will still 2HKO. In addition, Blaziken's Vacuum Wave and Hitmonlee's Mach Punch both surpass 50% damage. Fortunately, Donphan's Ice Shard and Choice Band Azumarill's Aqua Jet are 3HKOs, and Sucker Punches thrown by Cacturne and Absol can be Recovered away. All of these Pokemon should also be OHKOed by the appropriate move after a Swords Dance.</p>"
      },
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Cradily is constantly seen as a bulky supporter Pokemon lacking in the offensive department; however, this set attempts to take advantage of its ability to reliably set up Stealth Rock (thanks to its great overall bulk) and its great dual typing to turn it into a solid, effective Stealth Rock lead. With a Life Orb attached, Cradily becomes surprisingly powerful, capable of 2HKOing or OHKOing almost every common lead, such as Arcanine, Omastar, and Cloyster, as well as becoming a decent late-game sweeper.</p> <p>Even though Cradily has equal offensive stats, its physical movepool is much stronger than its special movepool; as such, Cradily's moveset is geared towards the physical side. Seed Bomb and Stone Edge are the two primary STAB moves, the former hitting Omastar and Kabutops for extreme damage, and the latter smashing Moltres. Recover is used in the final slot to allow Cradily to heal any damage taken and to lengthen Cradily's survivability during the match, especially since Life Orb's recoil will be gradually reducing Cradily's health.</p> <p>The suggested EV spread focuses primarily on Cradily's offensive stats, but leaves enough EVs to be used in HP so it doesn't become defensively weak and can still tank some hits. With 104 Speed EVs, Cradily is always able to outpace Omastar and 16 Speed Azumarill and smack them with a powerful STAB Seed Bomb. The 176 Attack EVs and Adamant nature give it a good chance at OHKOing the previously mentioned Omastar, which takes 91% - 100% from Seed Bomb. Finally, the rest of the EVs are added to HP so Cradily is never OHKOed by a Life Orbed Fire Blast from Timid Moltres, as it only does 63% - 75%, which gives you enough HP left over to OHKO Moltres and not die from Life Orb recoil. Although rarer, Cradily is even able to survive a Life Orbed Fire Blast from Modest Moltres with enough HP left to survive Life Orb's recoil.</p> <p>There are a few leads whom Cradily has no chance at winning against, most notably Uxie and Hariyama. Cradily will struggle to break through Uxie's high Defense stat and Hariyama's great HP stat, and it will easily fall to the latter's Close Combat. Spiritomb is one of the best choices to deal with the aforementioned threats, especially for bulky, offensive teams. Spiritomb possesses immunities to Uxie's Psychic and Hariyama's Close Combat, as well as access to Calm Mind to set up against them. Bulky Steel-types like Registeel and Steelix will also pose a big problem, as Cradily isn't strong enough to break through their massive Defense. In this case, Water-types, particularly Milotic, can work exceptionally well against these threats. To keep the bulky offense feel of your team, Milotic can run the Life Orb Tank set to hit very hard and still take neutral and resisted attacks to good effect.</p>"

  "Armaldo": {
    "overview": "<p>Armaldo is one of those Pokemon who seems to try to do too much with just too little a stat total. It can be defensive or offensive, but not both, with the result that it is often all too easily discarded in favor of more specialized options. On the defensive side, it has just two resistances to rarely seen attacking types, a weakness to Stealth Rock, and a lack of reliable recovery. On the offensive side, Armaldo's horrible Speed comes back to haunt it with a resounding clang. Even past that, there are many who feel that Rhyperior can do everything that Armaldo does better, and with good reason. Unlike Armaldo, Rhyperior has no Stealth Rock weakness, a higher Attack stat, and STAB Earthquake, while also having access to Megahorn, which is more powerful than Armaldo's STAB X-Scissor, as well as Solid Rock to compensate for its higher slew of weaknesses.</p> <p>However, one should not put down Armaldo all that quickly. It has a fantastic support movepool that can be used in all sorts of situations, and it still has its powerful Attack stat, backed up by useful boosting moves and an excellent offensive STAB combination. And make no mistake, it has its own advantages over Rhyperior, most importantly a lack of quadruple weaknesses, making it less easily revenge killed, as well as higher Special Defense and Speed stats, allowing it to outspeed both Milotic and opposing Rhyperior. All in all, it has to be said that Armaldo is, whatever its shortcomings, a powerful Pokemon with acceptable defensive stats and a good movepool, so don't take this arthropod too lightly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>As far as physical options go, Rock Slide is available if you want more accuracy than Stone Edge and Rock Blast, Superpower is more powerful than Earthquake initially but has a disadvantageous side-effect, and Cross Poison has completely redundant coverage with X-Scissor. Curse is a pretty useful boosting move, especially considering that sandstorm boosts Armaldo's Special Defense and as such allows it to be surprisingly bulky. However, Cradily does that sort of set much better thanks to Suction Cups and Recover, despite Armaldo's higher Attack stat. For Armaldo, Rock Polish or Swords Dance outclasses Curse as a boosting move anyway. Screech may force switches, and can be useful on a team with Spikes support. Brick Break is also available, more for its utility than its power.</p> <p>Armaldo has a more-or-less decent base 70 Special Attack, which would make a gimmick mixed sweeper set possible if it wasn't for the absence of nearly any sort of decent special move, the most remarkable of which is Earth Power. Lastly, Substitute is always available to scout out switches and enable Armaldo to hit the switch-in with the appropriate attack, in a similar vein to the infamous Substitute Rhyperior. However, Stealth Rock means that Armaldo is unlikely to have all that much HP to spare, so unless you are running a Rapid Spin user, it is generally not worth it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>In general, Armaldo's worst enemy is its own poor Speed. Failing to outrun such a wide range of Pokemon hinders its ability to sweep and forces it to switch out on Pokemon it could otherwise KO, such as Blaziken. In general, however, finding a semi-solid counter to the set depends largely on discovering the set. After this, it is not too difficult to stop with the appropriate Pokemon. Hitmontop is probably the best universal counter, having decent defensive stats, resistances to both of Armaldo's STAB moves, and Intimidate, as well as a range of moves with which to defeat Armaldo, such as Close Combat and Bullet Punch. Hariyama has the same resistances, is also quite defensive, and can beat down Armaldo with STAB Fighting-type attacks.</p> <p>Once Armaldo has gotten a Swords Dance in, the best option is really to revenge kill with a faster Pokemon. In terms of bulkier Pokemon, Weezing can take a +2 Stone Edge and burn Armaldo with Will-O-Wisp, while Steelix and Rhyperior can easily take a hit and attack back with their respective STAB moves. For the Rock Polish set, the list of paper counters extends much further, where reasonably defensive Pokemon such as Registeel and Milotic can all effectively take on Armaldo.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Armaldo returns for another bout of carnage in DPP with little change as far as the basic idea behind it goes: attempt to sweep, or support, but not both. This set is the most ambiguous of all its potential sets to identify in this context--while Rock Polish constitutes a straightforward sweep and the support variant is so named for obvious reasons, this Armaldo can attempt to sweep slower or weakened teams, as well as punch holes in the walls of the opponent's team, thus supporting its own team. It can therefore modify its game to suit any opponent, not only making it the most easily adaptable of Armaldo's sets, but often the most profitable when used competitively.</p> <p>Swords Dance is naturally the most important move on this set, boosting Armaldo's Attack as far as it can go in preparation for a sweep. After Armaldo has set up, you can show off its excellent STAB moves. Stone Edge and X-Scissor are both decently powered and provide a wide range of coverage together, resisted only by Fighting- and Steel-types. Earthquake is placed in the final slot to deal with Steel-types, as well as Toxicroak and Nidoking, and it is Armaldo's best bet against Fighting-types such as Primeape and Hitmontop. Between these three moves is a conglomeration of EdgeQuake and Bug-type STAB that hits every Pokemon in the game for at least neutral damage.</p> <p>The EVs and nature are the standard sweeper spread. A Jolly nature and 252 Speed EVs are necessary to allow Armaldo to outrun defensive Milotic and other slower Pokemon, such as Aggron and Rhyperior. The ability to outrun Milotic is something Rhyperior does not share, and is hence a massive advantage in competitive play. Attack is then maximized, and the remaining EVs are placed in Defense to give Armaldo an HP number indivisible by four, which allows Armaldo to switch into Stealth Rock five times at most without fainting. Life Orb is recommended in the item slot to make up for the loss of the Adamant nature, allowing Armaldo to OHKO Milotic with Stone Edge and Tangrowth with X-Scissor after a Swords Dance; however, its recoil makes Armaldo far easier to revenge kill. Leftovers is another good choice in order to make the most of Armaldo's bulk, especially if you pair it with sandstorm support, but the loss in power is significant.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is an always useful support to have, since as powerful as Armaldo is, it simply does not have the power, even after a Swords Dance, to OHKO most bulky Pokemon. Armaldo is also easily outsped and revenge killed by faster threats. For these reasons, Hippopotas is recommended as a partner to set up sandstorm and Stealth Rock, the former of which gives a very useful defensive boost to Armaldo's weaker special side, which makes it so that standard Milotic cannot OHKO Armaldo with Surf even after Stealth Rock damage; however, you should make sure you are aware of the potential damage the sandstorm can do to the rest of your team if they are not immune to it. In all cases, Armaldo will be glad of some extra Speed to work with, since its low Speed stat is its biggest complaint as a sweeper. This can be mitigated in three ways: Baton Passed Speed boosts from something such as Scyther or Gligar, paralysis support from Uxie or Tangrowth, or Trick Room. For the last option, you will want to run a Brave nature and shift all of Armaldo's Speed EVs to HP in order to maximize Trick Room's effectiveness.</p> <p>In the way of troublemaking bulky Pokemon, Weezing can survive a Swords Danced Stone Edge, just barely, and cripple Armaldo with Will-O-Wisp. Luckily for Armaldo though, should Weezing be lacking Will-O-Wisp, then its Flamethrower will not even 3HKO, and if Armaldo is running Leftovers, neither will Fire Blast. Aside from this, Fighting-types cause Armaldo the most trouble, notably Hitmontop and Hariyama, since Toxicroak, Medicham, and Blaziken can be taken care of with Armaldo's coverage moves. Both Hariyama and Hitmontop resist Armaldo's STAB moves and take little from Earthquake; Hitmontop in particular has Intimidate and Bullet Punch to threaten Armaldo with, and both have STAB Close Combat. To combat these threats, a sturdy Psychic-type, such as Uxie or Claydol, or Spiritomb is worth consideration.</p>"
      },
      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<p>This set is far more concentrated upon sweeping, and getting the job done, than simply going for as much power as possible. Rock Polish allows Armaldo to boost its Speed to respectable levels at the cost of a moveslot that could have been used for Swords Dance, thus allowing it to outpace and hopefully run through the opponent's team. This set should be played in a similar fashion to Rock Polish Rhyperior, with the difference being that Armaldo has STAB X-Scissor and Stone Edge with Earthquake for coverage, while Rhyperior has STAB Earthquake and Stone Edge with Megahorn for coverage. Armaldo also has slightly higher initial Speed to compete with Rhyperior's extra attacking power, which means that it can afford to run an Adamant nature and still outpace Alakazam and Dugtrio after a Rock Polish, which is a massive plus.</p> <p>With 244 EVs in Speed, a Rock Polish grants Armaldo a Speed stat of 374, allowing it to outpace everything up to Adamant Choice Scarf Absol and Timid Alakazam, and hopefully tear apart a weakened team, while the remaining 12 EVs are allocated to HP to provide some bulk. Alternatively, you can use a Jolly nature to hit the same Speed tiers as Jolly Rhyperior, while retaining plenty of EVs to give Armaldo some bulk. Since this set single greatest objective is a sweep this Armaldo should be saved for late-game when most walls are either weakened or gone, and Swellow and Sceptile are hopefully absent and unable to revenge kill Armaldo. The surprise factor for Armaldo is critical--since once the surprise is gone, a sweep becomes a far more difficult task. For all these reasons, as well as the much-needed power it provides, Life Orb is heavily recommended as the item of choice.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is still a useful support to have, and is critical in wearing down your opponents to KO range for Armaldo at the time of the sweep. Faster Pokemon are now less of an issue--Blaziken will not enjoy eating an Earthquake after attempting to switch in on an X-Scissor. However, at the same time, bulky Pokemon become greater threats--Weezing and Spiritomb have no difficulty burning Armaldo with Will-O-Wisp, while Registeel can ruin its sweep with Thunder Wave and beat it up with STAB Iron Head. Regirock has an even higher Defense stat and a more powerful STAB Stone Edge to use against Armaldo. Steelix has the potential to carry Gyro Ball, which can hurt badly after a Rock Polish, or to simply Roar Armaldo out. Not far behind are bulky Water-types such as Milotic, who have reliable recovery and can use status moves or simply STAB Surf to end Armaldo for good. For these reasons, Blaziken can make a useful ally, as it is immune to Will-O-Wisp and has STAB Fire Blast and Superpower to beat Regirock, Registeel, and Steelix, while Weezing and Spiritomb dislike Fire Blast and can do nothing significant back. Bulky Water-types also help, as they can deal with such Pokemon as Weezing, Steelix, and Regirock with ease, provided none of them pack Explosion. Claydol can use STAB Earthquake or Earth Power on Steelix, Regirock, and Registeel, as well as ridding Armaldo of entry hazards with Rapid Spin, and can also set up its own Stealth Rock to aid Armaldo's sweep.</p>"
      },
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Armaldo has the potential to support its teammates rather than rely on them for a sweeping opportunity, by virtue of its excellent support movepool. One would expect that, with the many ways it can support its team, coupled onto its reasonable defensive stats, and lack of Speed making it a less potent offensive threat than it could be, this would be Armaldo's most used set. However, its typing gives Armaldo a mere two resistances, to Normal- and Poison-type moves, widely accepted as the worst attacking types outside of STAB, and with weaknesses to Rock-, Water-, and Steel-type moves, which is incredibly detrimental. The Rock-type weakness is really the killer, whereby Armaldo obtains the infamous 'Cloyster syndrome' (being a Rapid Spin user weak to Stealth Rock), and this weakness both limits its survivability and also undercuts its utility as a Rapid Spin user. However, this should not discourage you from using Support Armaldo, as it can be a very useful tool when a lot of jobs need doing.</p> <p>Rock Slide is advised as your attacking option for reliability, though there are always other options. Rock Blast may seem an odd choice when Stone Edge and Rock Slide are available, but it can also be used to support the team in a way Armaldo's other STAB moves cannot. Similar to Marowak's Bonemerang, Rock Blast can be used to break Substitutes; for example, against a Substitute + Toxic Moltres, Armaldo can break the Substitute with its first Rock Blast, then follow it up with up to four more 4x super effective STAB hits. Its accuracy is shaky at best, but then again Stone Edge has the same accuracy anyway. Stealth Rock is, naturally, a useful entry hazard with which to build up damage, and can be useful if you have no other Pokemon on your team capable of setting it up. Rapid Spin removes the entry hazards on your side of the field, which is beneficial to those Pokemon that have to keep switching, as well as those that are vulnerable to entry hazards, including Armaldo itself. Knock Off is best used by removing the item from more specialized Pokemon--walls such as Slowbro hate to lose their Leftovers, and sweepers will also miss the extra kick from their Life Orb or Choice item. Lastly, Toxic can go over either of the previous moves, its main use being to cripple walls, as well as Spiritomb that attempt to block Armaldo's Rapid Spin attempts.</p> <p>Armaldo is naturally physically defensive, so the EVs serve to reinforce that. Its Special Defense can be patched up with sandstorm if you feel it is exposed, but this may harm your other team members, so be sure to take it into account. The remaining EVs are placed in Attack.</p> <p>Armaldo can support a great variety of Pokemon with its moves, and so can cater to a great variety of strategies that require adequate support. For example, as a Rapid Spin user it can clear the field of Stealth Rock, which is a great help to Pokemon such as Moltres and Scyther who are quite crippled by it, as well as giving more switching opportunities for Pokemon such as Arcanine. One of its notable advantages over its fellow Rapid Spin users is, on offensive teams especially, that unlike Claydol or Cloyster, the opponent will not always assume that it is a Rapid Spin user, and so Ghosts will not always converge upon Armaldo en masse; after all, even 252/252+ Spiritomb takes hefty damage from a +2 Stone Edge, and Mismagius is not exactly the first choice to defeat the Rock Polish set. Thus, in a similar vein to Kabutops, Armaldo can often find itself clearing the field of entry hazards set up by stall teams, though this facade will only work once, and without the power of the offensive sets, it cannot hope to get past Spiritomb (though Toxic can remedy this). Armaldo will still almost always break a Mismagius Substitute with Rock Blast, however, and more often than not can deal damage past it through consecutive hits.</p> <p>In the vein of offensive teams, Toxic, Stealth Rock, and Knock Off all hamper the opponent's walls and can indeed aid in a sweep for any offensive Pokemon, yet they also have utility on stall teams as well, so make sure to choose your Armaldo's moves not only on personal preference, but also on what benefits your team the most. In terms of bulkiness, Armaldo is fairly good physically, but a lack of useful resistances as well as recovery hurts it badly, so it is best to relegate him to a simple secondary physical shock absorber. Lastly, it should be noted that although Armaldo certainly benefits from sandstorm, be cautious about its impact on the rest of your team; Armaldo can often play its role more readily without sandstorm than the rest of your team could with sandstorm.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>There is rarely an offensive Pokemon who cannot in theory run a viable Choice set, and Armaldo is no exception to the rule. A Choice Band allows Armaldo to hit hard right off the bat, which can be handy since the Swords Dance variant can often be forced out before it has had the chance to wreak havoc, thanks to everything vaguely popular being able to outspeed it. This set gives Armaldo the opportunity to hit its switch-in with a very painful, boosted attack. The downside to this is, of course, that Armaldo loses the ability to change moves, and so a misprediction can be a fatal mistake. Armaldo has a real potential to get stuck on the wrong move, as its STAB moves do not have a great deal of neutral coverage individually. Even then, if Armaldo uses Stone Edge on the switch and nails Moltres, expecting an X-Scissor, Pokemon such as Torterra then essentially get a free turn on Armaldo, which can be terminal to your chances in the battle if you don't have a way to stop them.</p> <p>The first three moves should be self-explanatory: a three slot combination that hits every Pokemon in the game for at least neutral damage. The fourth move is somewhat of a filler option, and does not really affect your battle chances should you leave the house with one but not the other. Aqua Tail, as demonstrated by Tyranitar in OU, is a good move with which to defeat its counters, Hippowdon and Gliscor, who are indifferent to its other moves and can generally wall the tar out of it, literally. Armaldo would no doubt put this to good use if either Gliscor or Hippowdon were allowed in UU, or if you intend to use this in OU. In a normal UU context, it is only really useful for Donphan, Rhyperior, and the odd Gligar or Hippopotas. All other Pokemon mostly take higher damage from its other moves. Superpower is a more powerful attack than Earthquake to use against Steel-types, though its coverage is somewhat redundant, but because it is as powerful as STAB X-Scissor when hitting for neutral damage, it is worth consideration.</p> <p>For the EVs, 252 EVs and a Jolly nature are again necessary to allow Armaldo to outrun defensive Milotic and everything slower, and the EVs in Defense leave Armaldo with an HP stat that allows it to switch into Stealth Rock a maximum of five times, which is handy as Armaldo will be switching a lot, as is often the case with Choice sets. On the other hand, if you want to bulk Armaldo up a bit, you can run 216 Speed EVs and an Adamant nature, which not only nets you more power but also an extra 40 HP EVs, while still allowing Armaldo to outrun Adamant Rhyperior. Again, Rhyperior is a competitor for this sort of spot on a team, but it has to be said that Rhyperior can use a Choice set slightly better, since it resists Stealth Rock and so is not limited to five switches. Do not let this discourage you from using Armaldo, though, as it still has the strong points of outspeeding Milotic and others around that Speed tier, as well as a somewhat more advantageous defensive typing.</p> <p>As previously mentioned, Armaldo has a lifeline of five switches in the presence of Stealth Rock, which isn't much. Therefore, a Rapid Spin user is heavily advised for use with Armaldo, as well as a Pokemon that can remove Ghosts. Claydol, as always, makes a good partner, checking Hitmontop and Hariyama while spinning away Stealth Rock, and also being able to set up its own Stealth Rock in order to aid Armaldo's episode of chaos. Wish support from a Pokemon such as Hypno or Chansey can also be a worthwhile investment by simultaneously healing Armaldo and also covering its weaker defensive side.</p>"

  "Banette": {
    "overview": "<p>Banette is an extremely overlooked Ghost-type, mainly because of its limited movepool, pathetic defenses, and pitiful Speed. Mismagius is always a better sweeper than Banette, while Dusclops is better at walling. In fact, Banette is only used because of its great base 115 Attack stat and Trick Room. It's one of the best suicide Trick Room leads in the UU metagame, and its ability, Insomnia, helps it better accomplish that role.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Many of the moves Banette can use are usually utilized much better by other Ghost-types. Banette can use a support set with Will-O-Wisp, but Dusclops is usually a better fit for that role due to its much higher defenses. Calm Mind can be used, but Drifblim and Mismagius pull it off better. Since Banette has such low Speed, Sucker Punch can be used to accommodate that and give Banette a strong priority move to use. Using Thunder or Thunderbolt off of Banette's decent base 83 Special Attack are useful against bulky Water-types, such as Milotic. Banette can PP stall the opponent with a combination of Spite and Pain Split, but it's usually better used by a Ghost-type with better defenses, like Dusclops. Trick can be used on the suicide Trick Room set in the place of Taunt with Choice Scarf instead of Focus Sash, but since Banette is already very slow, Tricking the Choice Scarf to the opponent won't really help it move first in Trick Room. Finally, a Choice Band set can be used to take advantage of Banette's high Attack, but with such a pathetic movepool, it's pretty underwhelming.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Banette doesn't necessarily have any counters, as it's basically meant to kill itself once it has set up Trick Room. The best thing you can do to stop Banette from setting up is by utilizing a Taunt lead, particularly Ambipom as it's immune to Banette's Shadow Claw. Another thing you should prepare for is Destiny Bond. Since Banette will most likely use this move after using Trick Room, avoiding attacking it directly will stall out Trick Room time and save your Pokemon's life; however, you must be careful of Taunt, as it will force you to use an attacking move. The easiest way to avoid Destiny Bond is by constantly switching around until Banette uses another move or switches out itself, or by crippling it with Toxic or Will-O-Wisp so you aren't affected by Destiny Bond.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Combine Banette's horrible Speed, Insomnia, Trick Room, and Destiny Bond, and you get yourself one of the best suicide Trick Room users in the UU metagame. This combination of traits is what makes Banette stand out from other Ghost-types and other Trick Room users in general, as none of them are capable of pulling off this combination of moves. Taunt is useful in allowing Destiny Bond to work properly, as the opponent is no longer able to avoid it with indirect attacks. Shadow Claw is a basic STAB move to use in emergencies.</p> <p>Depending on the opposing lead, there are simple strategies to use this set effectively. If you are up against a lead who doesn't use Taunt, such as Omastar, set up Trick Room on the first turn and use Taunt the turn after. That way, the opposing lead will have to attack Banette directly, leaving them vulnerable to Destiny Bond. If you do happen to Taunt the opponent, try to avoid using Destiny Bond and go directly to one of your Trick Room sweepers, as your opponent will likely switch out due to the fear of Destiny Bond.</p> <p>Since Banette is setting up Trick Room, it's obviously a good idea to use Trick Room sweepers and supporters. Excellent Trick Room sweepers to look into are Marowak, Rhyperior, and Rampardos, all of whom pack massive Attack, fairly low Speed, and powerful STAB moves. Other viable Trick Room sweepers you can use include Hariyama and Aggron, both of whom resist Banette's Dark-type weakness, and in Aggron's case, Ghost-type weakness, too. Pokemon who can keep Trick Room on the field include Slowbro, Claydol, and Porygon2. It's strongly recommended to read through the Trick Room guide to gain a better understanding of how Trick Room teams work and perform.</p>"

  "Tropius": {
    "overview": "<p>Tropius isn't a great Pokemon; its offensive stats aren't very good, and its Speed is poor. Tropius's defenses are decent, but they're undermined by its terrible defensive typing, being vulnerable to Stealth Rock and weak to Fire-, Flying-, Poison-, and especially Ice-type attacks. However, Tropius can be a force to be reckoned with in UU, as it has access to many good attacking and support options. Tropius resists Fighting-type moves, is immune to Earthquake, and has two great abilities to abuse Sunny Day with in Solar Power and Chlorophyll. All in all, Tropius isn't fantastic, but it can a good choice on teams that benefit from its particular traits.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tropius has a few additional moves that it can run, but they are generally worse than the options that have been listed. One of these moves is Dragon Dance, which is a great move that Tropius can't use properly. Dragon Dance Tropius can't use any good STAB attacks, as Leaf Blade and Dragon Dance are illegal together, so you would then have to rely on Razor Leaf and Aerial Ace, which aren't strong enough. Apart from Sky Attack, Fly is the strongest STAB attack that Dragon Dance Tropius can use.</p> <p>Return can be used on physical sets because it's your best bet against Swellow, Weezing, Altaria, and Moltres. Outrage is an okay option, but Tropius doesn't like getting locked into one attack that it doesn't even pick up STAB on. You can use Synthesis instead of Roost in sun for the added healing, but it doesn't remove any of Tropius's critical weaknesses. A set consisting of Curse, Leaf Blade, Earthquake, and Aerial Ace / Roost can work, especially under Trick Room, but other Pokemon like Registeel and Regirock tend to fare better given their lack of dangerous weaknesses. Growth can also be used in the Solar Power set to boost Tropius's Special Attack, but Tropius is too slow to use it effectively. Tropius can also set up Sunny Day by himself, but that isn't recommended because Tropius really needs the attacking coverage to succeed in any of its roles.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Weezing counters Tropius pretty well, thanks to its resistance to Grass-type attacks and immunity to Earthquake and Toxic. It can also attack with Fire Blast and STAB Sludge Bomb, or burn physical-based Tropius with Will-O-Wisp. Fire-types can switch into a Grass-type attack and hit Tropius with super effective attacks. Moltres is also immune to Earthquake, and can defeat Tropius with STAB Air Slash and Fire Blast. Other Fire-type Pokemon, such as Typhlosion, Houndoom, and Magmortar, can switch in a predicted Grass-type attack and kill Tropius, but they must be wary of Earthquake. Altaria is bulky enough to take many hits, and can Roar Tropius away from its Substitute or Swords Dance boosts, and then Roost off any damage from Tropius's attacks. Muk is a great counter to special Tropius, as it resists Grass-type attacks, and can attack with STAB Gunk Shot or Fire Punch.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is also very harmful for Tropius, as losing 25% HP when it switches in is something that breaks Tropius defensive capabilities wholly. Many of the following Pokemon that check Tropius can also set up Stealth Rock, too. Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon such as Registeel, Steelix, Bastiodon, Muk, Venusaur, and Swalot are almost immune to the defensive set because they take very little damage from Tropius's attacks and are immune to Toxic. Venusaur is also immune to Leech Seed and can attack Tropius with a super effective Sludge Bomb. Swalot's ability, Liquid Ooze, ruins Leech Seed as well. Glaceon is also a good counter because it can take a hit and OHKO Tropius with STAB Ice Beam. Clefable is also great, as defensive Tropius literally can't do anything to it. Tropius also hates status, especially poison, so if you have a bulky Toxic inducer not named Quagsire nor Gastrodon, you'll win. As Tropius's offensive stats are lackluster, especially without any investment, many Pokemon can survive its attacks and return fire with gusto.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Tropius's defenses are actually very good, making Tropius quite difficult to KO even with some super effective attacks. Roost is used to recover HP while also removing some of Tropius's weaknesses temporarily. Toxic is a fantastic support option, and this Tropius can use it effectively thanks to its bulk. Energy Ball and Air Slash are good offensive options, and give Tropius something do to should it get Taunted, but Whirlwind is a very useful phazing move that can keep Tropius from being set up on by the likes of RestTalk abusers.</p> <p>The EV spread given maximizes Tropius's ability to tank hits. Provided Stealth Rock is not on the field, Tropius is even able to take an Ice Beam from defensive Milotic, and will never be 2HKOed by a maximum Attack Donphan's Ice Shard. Scenarios such as these are all very common, therefore Rapid Spin support will help Tropius perform its tanking duties admirably. Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon wall this set badly, because they are immune to Toxic and resist Tropius's STAB attacks. Registeel, Weezing, Steelix, and Muk are examples of Pokemon that resist this set perfectly. For these two reasons, Donphan makes a great teammate for Tropius, as it can switch in on most Rock-, Steel-, and Poison-types and threaten them with its STAB Earthquake. Donphan is also able to use Rapid Spin quite effectively. You usually need a Psychic-type attacker for Weezing, because of that pesky Levitate.</p> <p>If you are using Whirlwind, entry hazards on your opponent's side will be greatly beneficial. Toxic Spikes support from Pokemon like Nidoqueen or Qwilfish is also awesome, as it frees up a moveslot for Tropius. Stealth Rock support is also recommended as it is for every other Pokemon in the game. Omastar is an awesome partner to supply entry hazards including Stealth Rock, as it resists many of Tropius's weaknesses, while Tropius helps to cover those of Omastar.</p> <p>Substitute can be used to protect Tropius from status and provide a buffer against incoming attacks. Tropius's Substitutes are also quite sturdy due to its good defenses and HP, but with Tropius's Speed, you won't be able to avoid poison and other negative status, effectively halving its potential uses. You can also use Leech Seed in this set instead of one of the attacking moves to drain your opponent's HP, especially when Tropius is behind a Substitute. With Sunny Day support, Tropius's Speed will double thanks to Chlorophyll, effectively making Substitute a viable option. Unfortunately, without any Speed investment, Tropius still fails to outspeed max Speed positively natured base 80s, such as Venusaur, and neutral natured base 90s, such as Moltres.</p>"

Leaf Blade's power after a Swords Dance is awesome, OHKOing almost every Pokemon that doesn't resist it. After a Swords Dance, Aerial Ace always OHKOes Scyther and destroys most Venusaur and Meganium after Stealth Rock damage. Roost is also a viable option to recover HP thanks to Tropius's great bulk. Earthquake OHKOes Magneton and Aggron, and 2HKOes Steelix after a boost.</p> <p>Sunny Day Support is needed for this set to succeed, as it allows Tropius to reach 402 Speed, which is enough to outspeed +2 Aggron, +2 Rhyperior, Alakazam, and Dugtrio. Uxie, Clefable, Jumpluff, Chansey, and Porygon2 are all great partners to provide Sunny Day support. If Sunny Day isn't up, Tropius still outruns Adamant Aggron and Tangrowth and can attack them with Earthquake or Aerial Ace. It's worth noting that this Tropius isn't outclassed by other Chlorophyll Swords Dance users such as Victreebel and Shiftry because of its bulk and access to Earthquake, Roost, and STAB Aerial Ace.</p> <p>Rapid Spin support is something you must remember to include when using Tropius. Blastoise is a fantastic teammate for Tropius, as it resists Fire- and Ice-Type attacks and can also use Rapid Spin. Like all offensive Pokemon, entry hazards are fantastic to net Tropius more KOs. Omastar is a great teammate for Tropius because it can take Fire-, Poison-, Ice-, and Flying-type attacks with ease; it can also set up all the entry hazards.</p>"

      "Solar Power": {
        "description": "<p>If Sunny Day is up, this Tropius's Special Attack raises to 546 with Choice Specs (600 with a Modest Nature). Leaf Storm will OHKO a lot of Pokemon, such as Milotic, Lanturn, Slowking, Regirock, and Slowbro. Solar Beam is a great attack on a Sunny Day Sweeper, and it's more reliable than Leaf Storm. However, if the sun fades, Energy Ball is much better since it doesn't require a charging turn. Air Slash is a good secondary STAB, and it's great against Grass-types such as Venusaur and Tangrowth, almost always OHKOing them with the Solar Power boost. It's also your best bet against Flash Fire Pokemon such as Houndoom and Arcanine. In the sun, Hidden Power Fire 2HKOs 252/252 Registeel and Regice after Stealth Rock damage with a Life Orb boost.</p> <p>The EV spread lets Tropius outspeed Jolly Aggron, neutral nature 0 Speed Rotom and most defensive Pokemon. If you run a Modest nature on Tropius, it will be unable to outspeed the aforementioned Aggron and Rotom, neutral max Speed Torterra, or Cacturne, but Tropius will be much more powerful. For instance, Modest enables Tropius to to OHKO Spiritomb with Leaf Storm. If using a Modest nature, run 252 EVs in Special Attack and in Speed. To show you the strength of this Tropius, here are some damage calculations assuming a Timid Nature and Life Orb with Sunny Day up:</p> <ul> <li>Leaf Storm vs. 252/116+ Spiritomb: 76% - 89.8%</li> <li>Leaf Storm vs. 252/0 Uxie: 67.8% - 79.9%</li> <li>Leaf Storm vs. 252/0 Mesprit: 79.4% - 94%</li> <li>Leaf Storm vs. 4/252+ Chansey: 32.9% - 38.8%</li> <li>Solar Beam vs. 252/0 Milotic: 100%</li> <li>Solar Beam vs. 212/252+ Slowking: 90.6% - 106.8%</li> <li>Solar Beam vs. 252/252+ Regirock: 100 %</li> <li>Solar Beam vs. 252/116+ Spiritomb: 65.1% - 77%</li> <li>Solar Beam vs. 252/252+ Steelix: 68.9% - 81.4%</li> <li>Air Slash vs. 136/252+ nature Tangrowth: 94.4% - 110.9%</li> <li>Air Slash vs. 216/144 Meganium: 91.3% - 108.2%</li> <li>Air Slash vs. 252/252+ Venusaur: 64.3% - 75.8%</li> <li>Hidden Power Fire vs. 252/252+ Steelix: 79.7% - 94.4%</li> <li>Hidden Power Fire vs. 252/252+ Registeel: 44.5% - 52.7%</li> <li>Hidden Power Fire vs. 0/0 Magneton: 100%</li> </ul> <p>Don't use this set without Sunny Day support, as it would then be outclassed by many other offensive Pokemon, especially by Venusaur and Moltres. Mesprit, Moltres, and Clefable are good options to set Sunny Day up. Stealth Rock support is also very important, as it allows Tropius to score some more KOs. Remember that Solar Power Tropius is very slow, and Flamethrower or Ice Beam can ruin you. Because of this, you can Baton Pass Agility to Tropius from Pokemon like Ambipom and Lopunny; paralysis support can be good too.</p>"

  "Absol": {
    "overview": "<p>Absol is considered the \"Disaster\" Pokemon because it is thought to bring bad luck to anyone who meets it, including its opponent. Absol's biggest selling point, its STAB Sucker Punch, is the most powerful priority move in the game. Swords Dance and a monstrous base 130 Attack stat make switching into Absol difficult; and if that weren't bad enough, Super Luck gives Absol a good chance of landing a critical hit. Absol's only real downfalls are its lackluster defenses and average Speed stat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>One of the main problems with Absol's Swords Dance set is that it suffers from having too few moveslots for all of Absol's necessary options. Therefore, if you want, you can remove Swords Dance from the set altogether and run a simple Life Orb attacker set, relying on Absol's immense power—even without a boost—and benefiting fully from the coverage granted by Absol's movepool without being locked into a single move. By doing this, you are able to run both Night Slash and Psycho Cut alongside Sucker Punch and Superpower or include another option such as Megahorn or Pursuit. Without the power from Swords Dance, Absol won't be sweeping teams, but in exchange it can hit hard off the bat and punch holes into any walls who try to absorb the blows. It should generally function similarly to the Choice Band set, but with the added ability to act as a potential late-game cleaner should the need arise.</p> <p>Megahorn is a powerful weapon that can OHKO Tangrowth after a Swords Dance, something few physical sweepers without a super effective STAB can boast. It is stronger than a STAB Night Slash against neutral opponents, and, besides low accuracy, has no detrimental side-effect. However, Megahorn is a lesser option since Night Slash has the ability to effectively hit Rotom and Mismagius. Stone Edge is extremely strong against Flying-types, but for the most part its coverage is redundant or inconsequential. Zen Headbutt has 10 more Base Power than Psycho Cut, but the latter's higher critical hit rate and better accuracy make up for the slight power drop.</p> <p>Taunt may seem a poor option on something as frail as Absol; indeed, its uses are mostly situational. However, if you are especially worried about status attacks, it can completely shut down Spiritomb and turn it into setup fodder. Weezing can also be shut down unless it attacks off the bat (since Sludge Bomb will deal decent damage to Absol). However, despite Absol's big weakness to status effects, Taunt's utility is fairly limited, as revenge killing is a far more popular way of dealing with Absol. Absol is also capable of Baton Passing Mean Look, Swords Dance, Calm Mind, and Curse. Baton Passing Mean Look is one of Absol's few niches compared to the rest of the UU Baton Passers. Swords Dance is better left to Scyther, while Hypno and Mr. Mime pass Calm Mind much better than Absol. It is one of the few Pokemon who can Baton Pass Curse as well, but there are still better choices for this job.</p> <p>Will-O-Wisp can burn opponents while Thunder Wave can cripple some fast sweepers. Perish Song can be used to ruin Baton Pass chains as well. Absol can also learn Wish as a NYPC move, but it is illegal with many of Absol's Egg moves. You are probably better off using a bulkier Pokemon if you are set on using these moves, as even with defensive investment, Absol can barely survive neutral hits.</p> <p>Since Absol will only ever be used as a sweeper and cannot take a hit from anything, max Attack and Speed are essential to maximize its chances of a successful sweep. This leaves 4 EVs unaccounted for, and while it may seem irrelevant where you place them, 4 HP Absol reaches 272 HP, which is divisible by 4, 8, and 16, which means that Absol will take more damage from residual damage such as Stealth Rock and Spikes. This is of concern on the Choice sets in particular, where a lot of switching is likely, since Absol will faint upon 8 switch-ins to Stealth Rock rather than 9. To avoid this, place the last 4 EVs in the defensive stat of your choice—which one you choose is largely irrelevant, but putting them in Special Defense ensures Porygon2 won't get a Special Attack boost from Download. Another point that should be considered is that with a 29 HP IV, Absol takes less damage from Life Orb, and thus after three attacks and beyond, a Life Orb Absol with a 29 HP IV will have more HP remaining than one with a 31 HP IV.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Hitmontop with Intimidate is a good Absol counter. It isn't OHKOed by Sucker Punch and can do heavy damage in return with Mach Punch or Close Combat. It must be wary of Psycho Cut, though, as it will do massive damage even with Intimidate factored in. Hariyama resists Absol's Dark-type attacks, rubs off Superpower, and can threaten to OHKO Absol with Force Palm or Close Combat. However, a Swords Dance-boosted Psycho Cut will OHKO Hariyama. Drapion resists Sucker Punch and is immune to Psycho Cut, and the only concern Drapion should have is a Swords Dance-boosted Superpower. Unfortunately, Drapion cannot OHKO Absol without resorting to a niche move such as Brick Break or X-Scissor. Fighting-types with Mach Punch make most Absol think twice before retaliating. Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan work best as both of them are faster than Absol and can use their strong Fighting-type attacks to OHKO it. Blaziken can revenge kill Absol with Vacuum Wave, as it can survive a boosted Sucker Punch, but just barely. Steelix, Rhyperior, and Regirock can survive an unboosted Superpower and retaliate with Earthquake or Stone Edge.</p> <p>There are a couple of Pokemon who, while not having the resistances for the job, can attempt to thwart Absol by means of sheer defensive stats and the strength of their secondary moves. Chief among these are Spiritomb and Weezing, who can cripple Absol for the rest of the game with Will-O-Wisp. Be wary, though, since Weezing will take massive damage from a Swords Dance-boosted Psycho Cut. Tangrowth can actually survive two Night Slashes if Absol gets a low damage roll, cripple Absol with Stun Spore or Sleep Powder, or else simply eliminate Absol with STAB Leaf Storm or Power Whip. Leafeon is less defensive than Tangrowth, but is faster than Absol and can take a Night Slash. Milotic is similarly bulky and can use Haze to remove boosts, but Absol will be able to do massive damage if Milotic mispredicts. Offensive Milotic outruns Absol and can do large amounts of damage with Hydro Pump, but is OHKOed by boosted Sucker Punch. Lastly, Donphan can take an attack and hit back with Earthquake or use Ice Shard to pick off a weakened Absol.</p> <p>In reality, it is rather difficult to switch into Absol with \"prediction\". After a Swords Dance, Absol can severely damage many of its counters while outpacing a lot of them. The best strategy to take down Absol is to target its two key vulnerable points: its defenses and its Speed stat. Pokemon who use Substitute and are faster than Absol can basically force Absol to use Sucker Punch to get the KO, meaning you can get a free Substitute up to block Sucker Punch damage. For example, Alakazam can threaten to OHKO Absol with a powerful super effective Signal Beam, use Substitute when Absol uses Sucker Punch, and proceed to OHKO Absol from behind its Substitute. Dugtrio can employ a similar strategy with Substitute and Earthquake. Other methods of dodging Sucker Punch include Swellow's and Scyther's Quick Attack, Venusaur's Sleep Powder, and Mismagius's Will-O-Wisp.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Absol's amazing base 130 Attack stat, coupled with Swords Dance and the strongest priority move in the game, makes it a devastating sweeper against those who aren't prepared.</p> <p>Sucker Punch helps mitigate its mediocre Speed. With it, Absol becomes a challenge to take down as Sucker Punch can severely dent or even OHKO would-be revenge killers. Superpower is a great move to pair with Sucker Punch, as it damages Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon, such as Steelix and Drapion, who take little damage from Absol's STAB Dark-type attacks. Night Slash allows Absol to eliminate Pokemon who try to outsmart you by refusing to attack while Absol tries to Sucker Punch, and works extremely well with Absol's Super Luck ability. Psycho Cut, which also benefits from Super Luck, can maim incoming Poison- and Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Weezing, Hitmontop, and Hariyama.</p> <p>The EVs generate maximum Attack and Speed to increase Absol's potency as a sweeper. The remaining 4 EVs go in Special Defense rather than HP in order to give Absol a HP stat of 271, decreasing the damage it takes from Stealth Rock. If you want, you can also choose to give Absol a 29 HP IV, which means it will take less damage from Life Orb recoil. Adamant is the recommended nature as the extra power can prove very useful; Blaziken can be OHKOed after Stealth Rock by +2 Sucker Punch, and the extra damage can ensure KOs on bulkier walls such as Milotic and Donphan with a little bit of residual damage. However, a Jolly nature can sometimes be useful to get the jump on opponents such as offensive Milotic and Venusaur that run neutral natures. A Jolly nature also allows Absol to outpace slower Blaziken and Toxicroak, enabling it to use Sucker Punch before they can use Vacuum Wave. While Life Orb is the recommended item to boost Absol's power, Lum Berry is also a nice option as it gives Absol a cushion against Weezing's and Spiritomb's Will-O-Wisp. It also helps against Venusaur who may try to evade Sucker Punch by using Sleep Powder.</p> <p>Entry hazards are a good idea to facilitate your sweep—Stealth Rock can be easily set up by a lead such as Kabutops or Uxie, while Spikes can be set up by Omastar or Cloyster. If you can manage to get Absol set up and ready to go, there's very little in the UU metagame that can actually stand in its way. However, in practice, using Absol is rarely such a smooth ride, as its poor defensive stats and relatively low Speed immediately highlight two big problems—first, setting it up without being killed or crippled, and second, stopping faster Pokemon from simply revenge killing it or forcing it out. As for the first point, Absol generally can only set up on weaker attackers with resisted STAB moves. While luring out a Rotom or Alakazam carrying a Choice item with something like a weakened Venusaur can do the trick, you can do more than that. For example, Uxie can provide dual screen support to allow Absol to set up more easily, or give Absol a free switch-in with strategic U-turn pivoting. As for revenge killers, you can first try to ascertain what Pokemon are likely to be faster or carry priority and whether they can avoid Sucker Punch—for example, Alakazam could revenge kill Absol with Signal Beam, but Absol can beat it to the punch with Sucker Punch. However, Alakazam has the potential to carry Substitute or Encore to thwart this strategy. Having heavy hitters such as Blaziken and Azumarill on your team to weaken your opponent's team is also a good thing to keep in mind, as it allows Absol to sweep weakened enemies much more easily. Fire Blast from Blaziken and Waterfall from Azumarill are both powerful STAB attacks that can severely dent your opponent's bulkier Pokemon, giving Absol a chance to score many kills later in the battle.</p> <p>Bulkier threats to Absol are hard to come by, yet still exist. While frailer Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee and Primeape are OHKOed by boosted Sucker Punch, more defensive Pokemon such as Hitmontop and Hariyama can be problematic, especially if you lack Psycho Cut. Hitmontop's Technician-boosted Mach Punch is a guaranteed OHKO on Absol, while defensive Hariyama can take anything Absol has, bar Psycho Cut, and hit back with Revenge or Brick Break. Thus, a partner such as Claydol or Weezing who can take down Fighting-types is greatly recommended. Threats that don't immediately attack can be quite threatening as you cannot rely on the extra strength of Sucker Punch. Will-O-Wisp Weezing and Spiritomb can cripple Absol, but can be taken care of by most Fire-types. Moltres can make a pretty good partner to Absol provided you have Rapid Spin support, as Moltres can come in for free on Will-O-Wisp and threaten Weezing and Spiritomb with its STAB Fire Blast, while also checking many of Absol's common counters with its STAB Air Slash and resistance to Fighting-type attacks. As an added bonus, it also beats Tangrowth and Steel-types while drawing out Pokemon such as Chansey that Absol can set up on. Milotic can be a potent foe, as it can Haze away boosts and then attack with STAB Surf or even potentially outspeed Absol. If you are concerned about Milotic, Venusaur can be employed to deal with it, while also helping out by absorbing Toxic Spikes, checking Fighting-types, and crippling opponents with Sleep Powder.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf makes up for Absol's mediocre Speed, boosting it to a reasonable 373 with an Adamant nature. Due to this great increase in Speed, Sucker Punch becomes a lesser option; Night Slash is a far better choice to hit almost as hard without worrying about opponents potentially using non-damaging moves. Superpower will intimidate those who resist Absol's Dark-type STAB attacks, such as Steelix and Registeel, while Psycho Cut eliminates Fighting-type Pokemon who also enjoy switching in on Absol's STAB attacks. Pursuit is Absol's best choice for the last slot, as it allows Absol to take out retreating Ghost- and Psychic-types.</p> <p>With an Adamant nature, Absol reaches 373 Speed, which means that it can outrun Timid Alakazam and everything slower—essentially the entire unboosted UU metagame. The loss in power from the Swords Dance set is severe, so Adamant is the superior option. A Jolly nature does not allow Absol to outrun anything more of real significance, aside from the odd Dragon Dance Feraligatr or Altaria. Aside from that, the EVs are the standard Absol EVs.</p> <p>This Absol is very fast, and hence less prone to revenge killing, but unfortunately it is also a lot less powerful, making it much more susceptible to being walled by defensive threats. Weezing and Spiritomb can burn Absol and render it useless, so a Fire-type teammate such as Blaziken or Arcanine can be useful, as they are immune to Will-O-Wisp. Houndoom, in particular, can be a very good partner since Will-O-Wisp activates its Flash Fire ability. However, be aware that Absol and Houndoom have similar weaknesses and are both poor defensively, so don't expect much defensive synergy. Fire-types are also useful for dealing with Tangrowth, who can survive two Night Slashes and either cripple Absol with Stun Spore or Sleep Powder or simply OHKO Absol with STAB Leaf Storm. Lastly, Milotic is still an issue, so Venusaur can be employed as a check.</p> <p>One of Choice Scarf Absol's main attractions is its fast STAB Pursuit, which allows it to checkmate slower, frail sweepers such as Alakazam and Mismagius, both of whom are OHKOed regardless of whether they switch or not. You can also use it to get rid of a weakened Chansey permanently should it attempt to flee. Pokemon who are threatened by these Pokemon, such as Venusaur, Rotom, and Moltres, value this kind of support. Bear in mind, however, that being locked into a weak move—not just Pursuit, but also Psycho Cut or Superpower after its Attack drop—can give your opponent the free turn they need to destroy your team.</p> <p>It is worth mentioning that Choice Scarf Absol can have some merit in the lead position, acting as an anti-lead that also has a strong presence later on in the game. With its strong STAB Night Slash, it can 2HKO Mesprit and less bulky Uxie, while Superpower allows it to beat Kabutops, Ambipom, and, to a certain extent, Omastar, although Absol is unlikely to 2HKO the last with Superpower. Night Slash scores an OHKO on Alakazam and a 2HKO on Qwilfish, and Pursuit can catch Alakazam attempting to flee. Psycho Cut's main target is Qwilfish, but you cannot OHKO it, so you may prefer Megahorn to improve Absol's chances of OHKOing Mesprit and 2HKOing bulky Uxie and Spiritomb leads.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band allows Absol to forgo Swords Dance and hit hard right off the bat. Absol is capable of reaching a whopping 591 Attack, making it a fierce competitor.</p> <p>Absol should generally always run Sucker Punch as it helps support its mediocre Speed and is Absol's strongest option to deal huge amounts of damage. However, it is well worth noting that locking yourself into Sucker Punch can be a very dangerous move if the opponent outpredicts and decides not to attack. Superpower is a great secondary option, as it allows Absol to deal super effective damage to Dark- and Steel-type Pokemon who resist Absol's STAB moves. The standard Steelix takes a minimum of 66% damage, meaning Absol can always 2HKO. Like on the Choice Scarf set, Pursuit is an excellent option to rid your team of Ghost-types and special walls. In this case, it is stronger against Chansey, and therefore carries less risk in case of a misprediction. However, it cannot be used to checkmate Rotom and Mismagius the way it can with the Choice Scarf set, though it is still quite effective against them. Night Slash is a reliable attack and serves as Absol's \"safe\" option on this set, since all three other moves have undesirable side-effects.</p> <p>While Choice Band Absol has more raw power than the Choice Scarf set, it still isn't quite strong enough to break the most defensive of Pokemon. Thus, the checks and counters of the Choice Band set are usually a mixture of those that resist its STAB attacks and those that are faster and can revenge kill. As this Absol will be switching a lot anyway, faster revenge killers are of less concern than with the Swords Dance set, and the defensive threats are mostly the same as those of the Choice Scarf set.</p> <p>Where Swords Dance Absol is meant to be a sweeper and Choice Scarf Absol a revenge killer, Choice Band Absol is generally best played in the role of wallbreaker, supporting the team by dealing massive damage to anything that switches in to pave the way for a sweep by another team member. With Stealth Rock support, defensive Pokemon such as Milotic and Donphan can be broken by the sheer power of Absol's STAB moves, paving the way for a sweep by a setup sweeper such as Swords Dance Scyther. Pursuit is also useful to rid you of a fleeing Chansey, meaning that special sweepers such as Nasty Plot Houndoom will have an easier time. Another point to take note of is that Choice Band Absol can lure in Fighting- and Steel-types quite easily, thus allowing you to immediately ascertain what threats your opponent is carrying to your sweepers. This is especially useful if Absol and your sweeper have similar checks; if you can manage to get rid of them with prediction, it can be very useful for your team. Nasty Plot Houndoom in particular values the absence of Fighting-types such as Hitmontop and Hariyama, as well as Milotic; in return, it can switch in on Will-O-Wisp from Weezing and Spiritomb directed at Absol.</p>"
      },
      "Attacking Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Absol's combination of an outstanding Attack stat, high critical hit rate, superb coverage, access to a priority move (albeit the unreliable Sucker Punch), and trapping abilities allow it to function as an effective offensive lead. It takes some daring and knowledge of the metagame for Absol to flourish, but if used well, the rewards can be excellent. Absol also boasts the most powerful priority attack in the game, allowing it to function decently in the mid-game as well.</p> <p>Night Slash is a given. Backed by base 130 Attack, a boosting nature, STAB, and a 25% chance to score a critical hit, it is Absol's best general attack. Superpower gives Absol nearly unresisted coverage when paired with Night Slash, as well as hitting several common leads for super effective damage. Sucker Punch, despite its unreliability, allows Absol to threaten faster Pokemon and perform some revenge killing duties. The final slot is up to personal preference. Pursuit can trap opposing Pokemon attempting to switch out of a predicted Sucker Punch and immediately threaten some common leads, such as Alakazam and the pixies. Taunt is another option, stopping slower leads from setting up, as well as forcing them to attack and run right into Sucker Punch. However, Absol's base 75 Speed means it is less effective at stopping setup compared to faster Taunt users such as Alakazam and Ambipom. The final option in the last slot is Psycho Cut. Many Pokemon will attempt to bypass Absol's Sucker Punch with their own, faster, priority moves. Several common UU priority users such as Nidoking, Blaziken, and Toxicroak are hit super effectively by Psycho Cut. It is also Absol's best attack against Weezing, although physically defensive variants will still remain relatively unscathed.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is not recommended because Absol has priority to bypass its low Speed. Nonetheless, it is wise to invest in Speed because of the chance that your opponent might Trick a Choice Scarf onto Absol. With maximum investment, Absol makes good use of a Choice Scarf, outspeeding almost the entire unboosted metagame. However, one must be very careful of locking Absol into Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Much of Absol's value as a lead stems from its ability to put the opponent under pressure. However, the same unpredictability that makes the opponent uncomfortable also makes Absol's best move unclear at times. Therefore, if you choose Absol as a lead, you must be prepared to take calculated risks. Some knowledge of the metagame is very helpful as well. For example, if your opponent leads with Moltres and it shows Life Orb recoil, it probably has Roost. On the other hand, if it doesn't show Life Orb recoil, it is probably carrying a Choice Scarf. This kind of knowledge will greatly aid your choice between Pursuit, Night Slash, and Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Like every lead, there are other leads that give Absol trouble. Ambipom and Hariyama are particularly troublesome, as they are capable of breaking Absol's Focus Sash with Fake Out and KOing it the next turn. Sleep-inducing Pokemon such as Venusaur and Jynx cause problems as well, while bulky leads such as Rhyperior and Cloyster can easily set up if Absol doesn't have Taunt. Having Pokemon that can deal with all these problems is recommended. Individually, Ambipom is walled by Steel- and Rock-types such as Steelix and Regirock, while Hariyama has trouble with Slowbro and Weezing. Both Ambipom and Hariyama also cannot get past Spiritomb, which can switch in for free on Fake Out. To deal with sleep, a RestTalk user is ideal, but any bulky Pokemon will suffice. Finally, because Absol cannot reliably stop other leads from putting up entry hazards, Rapid Spin support is useful. Hitmontop is a great choice, with access to Foresight to guarantee a successful Rapid Spin and Close Combat to hit bulky Spikes users, namely Cloyster and Omastar, super effectively. However, it is worth noting that suicide Cloyster and Omastar leads can be knocked out by a Night Slash followed by a Superpower.</p>"

  "Glalie": {
    "overview": "<p>Glalie has often been shunned as a Pokemon since its competitive debut. It's average at both offense and defense, and it has a very limited movepool. The creation of its evolutionary partner, Froslass, meant that Glalie was forced to reside in the dank, overcrowded recesses of the NU tier. However, with Froslass banished to the Borderline tier for the remainder of the DPP generation, Glalie finally has a comfortable niche in the Underused tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lead Glalie can run a set with a specially offensive spread and Ice Beam in place of Ice Shard, but the loss of power from Explosion is a real letdown. Crunch is also a possible option over Ice Shard if you feel that Alakazam and bulky Psychic-type leads are a problem. Ice Fang is a more powerful attack than Ice Shard, but it doesn't OHKO or 2HKO anything of note, so Ice Shard is generally superior for breaking Focus Sashes. Super Fang is plausible if you want to take chunks out of bulky Steel-type leads like Steelix and Registeel, but otherwise it's rather lackluster. Light Screen is an option to make Spiking easier, but Glalie is usually better served by using that moveslot for Taunt or Explosion.</p> <p>Aside from the Lead set, Glalie's options are few and far between. A Choice Band set is viable, due to Glalie's access to STAB priority and Explosion. However, Glalie has a rather lackluster movepool and weak stats, as well as a weakness to Stealth Rock, leaving it utterly outclassed by Pokemon like Kabutops, Qwilfish, and Regirock. In the same vein, Choice Specs is also plausible, with Explosion to punish special walls like Chansey, but again, there are better Pokemon for the job.</p> <p>On the defensive and support side, Glalie can run a bulkier Spikes set, but it is generally outclassed in that role by Qwilfish and Omastar, thanks to their superior typing, lack of Stealth Rock weakness, and access to more types of entry hazards. Glalie can also work in a hail team to make use of Ice Body, but Walrein outclasses Glalie for this role. Lastly, Glalie can run Sing from Pokemon XD; however, its shaky accuracy makes it very risky.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Glalie hates dealing with Arcanine and Kabutops when in the lead position. Both of them can hit Glalie with a super effective STAB move, and then follow up with priority, meaning that the most you can do is either throw out a single layer of Spikes or Taunt Kabutops to prevent Stealth Rock. Moltres also poses problems for Glalie, as it is faster than Glalie and can 2HKO with Flamethrower, forcing Glalie to set up only a single layer of Spikes. Leads with U-turn, such as Scyther and Swellow, are also an irritation for Glalie because they can break its Focus Sash, leaving Glalie open for a faster sweeper to come in and finish it off.</p>",

      "Spikes Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Glalie makes an excellent lead thanks to its above-average Speed, Taunt, and the ability to lay down Spikes. With decent stats, Glalie fits comfortably into many different types of teams. Taunt prevents slower leads from setting up their own entry hazards, and also stops opposing Taunt leads from ruining your fun. Glalie can then reliably set up multiple layers of Spikes before using Explosion to take a chunk out of one of your opponent's Pokemon. Leads like Uxie, Ambipom (thanks to Inner Focus), Mesprit, Spiritomb, and Omastar are all setup fodder for Glalie if you play it right. Ice Shard's primary purpose is to consistently break Focus Sashes, regardless of what lead you are up against, unless you're facing a faster priority lead like Pinsir.</p> <p>Glalie is one of only two Pokemon to get the combination of Explosion, Spikes, Taunt, and a STAB priority move, the other being Qwilfish. This set takes full advantage of all these blessings in tandem. Using Glalie is a simple process, although it varies depending on what lead your opponent is using. Against Ambipom, the wisest move is to simply lay Spikes on the first turn while it tries to Fake Out or U-turn out. Versus Omastar, Taunt is always the safest move, as it will prevent Omastar from setting up its own entry hazards. Against Mesprit and Uxie, Taunt and Spikes are both viable choices as the first move, depending on whether or not you believe your opponent is holding a Choice Scarf. In the case of Cloyster, your first move depends on whether you think your opponent will use Rock Blast or Spikes. Finally, against Spiritomb, throwing out as many layers of Spikes as you can is always the best option.</p> <p>The first thing to consider when choosing teammates for any Spikes lead is \"Which spinblocker do I use?\" In Glalie's case, Mismagius is its best partner; its ability to set up Substitute and either Nasty Plot or Calm Mind can cause serious problems for your opponent when coupled with Glalie's Spikes support. Rotom and Spiritomb are also viable partners, as they possess better typings than Mismagius and can thus offer you more possibilities on the defensive side. Venusaur also makes an excellent Glalie partner, especially the special and physical Life Orb variants; Sleep Powder forces many switches, and when this is combined with Venusaur's ability to hit hard on the switch, your opponent will have to play very carefully in order to survive. Donphan is also a great teammate for Glalie because Stealth Rock adds another entry hazard to the mix, and Rapid Spin support can help mitigate the effects of a bad prediction on your part. Heracross is a reasonable choice as a Glalie partner, however it is much better off being paired with Cloyster, who does a better job of clearing out a few spots on the opponent's team for a Heracross sweep. Finally, bulky Water-types, particularly offensive Milotic and Dragon Dance Feraligatr, are good teammates for Glalie. They offer decent synergy, and make great use of the Spikes that Glalie provides.</p>"

  "Walrein": {
    "overview": "<p>Though hail is a more viable strategy in OU due to the presence of Abomasnow, Walrein is still a great candidate for hail in the lower tiers. With hail support from Snover, Walrein can easily stall out many powerful threats with just Protect and Substitute alone. Add in a generous helping of entry hazards and you will find Walrein to be one of the most difficult Pokemon to take out. Unless you have a specific Pokemon to counter Walrein, it won't be easy to defeat it, as passive damage can easily knock you out. While it's not going to be everywhere, it's definitely worth having some way to plow through this Pokemon when it rears its ugly head.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There were many possible sets left out of the main options due to Walrein's poor defensive typing. Walrein can run a set with Curse, Avalanche, Earthquake, and Rest, but its poor defensive typing along with unreliable healing makes the set's effectiveness questionable. Walrein can also run a decent RestTalk set, but it won't be sticking around for long due to its many weaknesses. Walrein could also run Encore to help its teammates set up, but don't push your luck. A Choice Band set with Body Slam, Rock Slide, Ice Fang, and Waterfall is plausible, but Walrein is better off stalling rather than attacking. A Choice Specs set could also work, especially with hail on the field for a 100% accurate Blizzard.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As for defensive options, Clefable pretty much wrecks Walrein thanks to its ability, Magic Guard. Clefable isn't afraid of poison, hail, or whatever else Walrein thinks it can do, and can just set up with Calm Mind or do any dozens of other things at Walrein's expense. If Walrein lacks Super Fang and has Blizzard instead of Surf, Registeel can come in and PP stall out Blizzard, forcing Walrein to switch out most of the time.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Stallrein (Toxic Stall)": {
        "description": "<p>This set performs best in conjunction with Snover because it allows Walrein to activate its near exclusive ability, Ice Body. With Ice Body and Leftovers, coupled with its 110 / 90 / 90 defensive stats, Walrein becomes incredibly durable despite its terrible defensive typing. The full potential of this set can only be unlocked with substantial team support, however, most notably in the form of Toxic Spikes on the opposing team's field. The main idea behind this set is to increase residual and poison damage by alternating between Protect and Substitute. Super Fang is for halving the opponent's health, decreasing the time it'll take to wear out the opponent and decreasing the window of opportunity for your opponent to take out Walrein. Toxic can still be used on Walrein in order to poison Pokemon immune to Toxic Spikes or if you haven't had a chance to set them up yet. Surf or Blizzard guarantees that Walrein has an attacking move should it be Taunted by the opposing Pokemon.</p> <p>For Walrein, 232 HP EVs puts its HP stat at 419. This is of great importance as with its max possible HP of 424, Walrein's Substitutes would require 106 HP to make, but over the two turns it spends stalling with Substitute and Protect it would only recover back 104 HP. An HP stat that leaves the same remainder when divided by 16 and 4 is necessary, as it allows Walrein to stall until out of PP. 56 Speed EVs give Walrein the jump on neutral-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon, most notably Hitmontop, as well as Adamant Rhyperior. This allows Walrein to poison stall them by alternating between Substitute and Protect without getting hit by Close Combat or Stone Edge. Alternatively, you may choose to ignore Speed, as there are circumstances in which it is better for Walrein to be slower, and Walrein can benefit from additional investment into its defenses.</p> <p>Snover is absolutely mandatory on any team that includes Walrein. Walrein needs hail in play in order to function adequately. Poison stalling is also vital to Walrein's strategy, especially if not packing Toxic itself. Nidoqueen makes an excellent Walrein partner for several reasons; it provides Toxic Spikes support and can reliably place two layers down thanks to its bulk. Nidoqueen also covers Walrein's weaknesses by taking Electric-, Rock-, and Fighting-type hits. Last but not least, Toxic Spikes on your team's side will severely hinder Walrein's stalling capacity, and Nidoqueen can easily absorb them just by switching in. As an added bonus, Nidoqueen also provides Stealth Rock for Walrein to help deal with Flying-types who are immune to Toxic Spikes.</p> <p>Walrein will appreciate spinblocking support because it generally needs entry hazards to stay on the opponent's side of the field. Spiritomb is an ideal partner because its Ghost-typing allows it to block Rapid Spin and switch in on Fighting-type attacks directed at Walrein. Spiritomb has access to Rest and great bulk, allowing it to switch in throughout the game to block Rapid Spin. As for other spinblocking candidates, Mismagius makes an exceptional partner due to its ability to threaten common Rapid Spin users such as Donphan, Hitmontop, and Blastoise with its powerful special attacks. Furthermore, Mismagius has Taunt to prevent Hitmontop or Blastoise from using Foresight to bypass its Ghost typing. Cloyster is a good teammate for Walrein as well, despite sharing the same typing. Cloyster provides valuable Spikes support, which can be deadly when Walrein is in play. With all three entry hazards on the field, it becomes extremely hard for the opponent to take down Walrein.</p>"

  "Clamperl": {
    "overview": "<p>Don't be fooled by Clamperl's baby face and charms; she's one of the most deadly Pokemon in UU. Deep Sea Tooth doubles her Special Attack stat, giving her more immediate power than even the feared Deoxys-A. However, without her signature item, Clamperl is essentially useless. Clamperl also has awful Speed, making Trick Room a necessity to her success. If you can provide adequate support for her, Clamperl will be a dangerous addition to your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Clamperl has a very limited movepool, giving her few options to play with. Deep Sea Scale can be used on a defensive set, along with Toxic and Protect to stall, though Pokemon such as Milotic do this much better thanks to their reliable recovery moves and much higher HP stats. Substitute may be used on a switch to ease prediction, though if Trick Room is in effect, this will waste a valuable turn.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Pokemon with high Special Defense are the best counters, taking reduced damage from Clamperl's attacks and having a way to stall or retaliate. Chansey, Clefable, and Registeel are good choices, with all of them having access to some form of recovery (in Registeel's case, using Rest to recover damage), while hitting Clamperl with Seismic Toss or Earthquake. Bulky Water-types also do a decent job, as they don't take much damage from Surf or Ice Beam, and usually carry a super effective Hidden Power that will KO Clamperl. Just be careful about switching into Hidden Power Grass, as most bulky Water-types can be 2HKOed by it. Ludicolo is a lesser-used counter, though he can switch into Surf and Hidden Power thanks to his handy resistances, and takes less damage from Ice Beam due to his high Special Defense. Provided you can switch in safely, priority moves will be deadly towards Clamperl. Arcanine can switch into Ice Beam or Hidden Power Grass and hit Clamperl with Extreme Speed, while Spiritomb does a fine job with Sucker Punch and his good defensive stats. Finally, Clamperl is useless without her signature item, so Knock Off, Trick, and Switcheroo users utterly destroy Clamperl.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Although Clamperl is slow and frail, she hits like a truck. When Trick Room is in effect, Clamperl becomes one of the fastest Pokemon in the game. Additionally, Her Water-typing gives her a resistance to many common priority moves, such as Ice Shard, Bullet Punch, and Aqua Jet, making her the ideal Trick Room abuser. Deep Sea Tooth doubles Clamperl's Special Attack to an insane 542, turning her into a dangerous threat when used correctly. Surf provides reliable STAB, Ice Beam hits Grass-types, and Hidden Power Grass is for rival Water-types, like Quagsire and Milotic. Finally, Brine deals more damage to weakened opponents, which is especially helpful against Chansey and Registeel, while Toxic cripples defensive Pokemon who are difficult to get past. Keep in mind that when using Clamperl, it is very important that you switch her in unscathed, as her defenses are very low.</p> <p>The idea behind this set is to be as slow as possible, so a Quiet nature and 0 Speed EVs are used. The IVs give Clamperl the lowest possible Speed while keeping Hidden Power Grass at 70 Base Power. Hidden Power Electric is an option instead of Hidden Power Grass, as it allows Clamperl to use a lower Speed IV of 2, though this leaves Clamperl vulnerable to Quagsire, Lanturn, and Gastrodon.</p> <p>Clamperl appreciates the presence of entry hazards, as they greatly aid her sweep. Spikes and Stealth Rock are both capable of damaging the opposing Pokemon upon switching in, eliminating Focus Sashes and crippling bulkier Pokemon such as Registeel. Cloyster and Cacturne are wonderful choices to set up Spikes, while Registeel and Donphan are good choices for Stealth Rock. Toxic Spikes are also awesome, as they cripple bulky Water-types like Milotic and Slowking, though they also activate Guts, which is the main downside to using them. Omastar and Nidoqueen both do a good job at setting up Toxic Spikes due to their high defensive stats.</p> <p>Trick Room support is vital to Clamperl's success, making Uxie, Claydol, and Solrock good partners. Claydol and Solrock are probably the best, as they can set up Stealth Rock and then Explode after setting up Trick Room, allowing Clamperl to switch in unharmed. Rain Dance support is also helpful, boosting the power of Clamperl's Surf. This can be set up by Pokemon such as Uxie, Slowbro, and Mesprit.</p>"

  "Huntail": {
    "overview": "<p>Huntail is an unfortunate Pokemon. It's stuck in a sea of Water-types that share its ability, Swift Swim, and has no shining stat or quirk to separate it from the pack. As a physical rain sweeper, Huntail is generally outclassed by the likes of Kabutops, Qwilfish, and Ludicolo; as a special rain sweeper, it's outclassed by Omastar and its pink counterpart, Gorebyss. Huntail, however, has one saving grace available to it: its ability to act as a mixed rain sweeper.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Huntail doesn't have many other moves available to it. Super Fang has its merits on both sets, allowing Huntail to strip its counters, such as Milotic and Toxicroak, of half of their health, which can let a teammate like Ludicolo or Gorebyss to come in without taking damage and finish the job. Huntail also has access to Bounce, which grants Huntail the great type combination of Water/Flying, though the lack of STAB and the two turns required to use it usually leave it out of favor to moves like Return or Double-Edge. Huntail has Baton Pass, but can only pass Iron Defense and Substitute. Hidden Power Psychic can be used to annihilate Toxicroak and get a strong hit in on Poliwrath, but the other moves listed are usually more helpful.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky Water-types, such as Milotic, Blastoise, Poliwrath, Slowbro, and Slowking, have little trouble with either of Huntail's sets and take little damage from Hidden Power Grass. Milotic and Slowbro/Slowking don't even mind Super Fang as they can just recover off the damage and continue to whittle down Huntail's health. Toxicroak can take anything from the Mixed Sweeper set and Swords Dance or Nasty Plot in Huntail's face. However, Toxicroak takes massive damage from Double-Edge on the Physical Sweeper set, and Huntail can surprise Toxicroak with Hidden Power Psychic for an OHKO.</p> <p>Physically defensive Uxie and Registeel take little damage from anything from the Physical Sweeper set, but both take massive damage from Hydro Pump on the Mixed Sweeper set. Gardevoir with Trace and Golduck with Cloud Nine can both end Huntail's sweep. Gardevoir cannot switch into both Stealth Rock and Aqua Tail, but can outspeed Huntail once in and KO with either Thunderbolt or Energy Ball. Golduck can 2HKO Huntail with Hidden Power Grass if it switches into Aqua Tail and Encores it; however, if Golduck switches into Double-Edge or Hidden Power Grass, it will be KOed before it can KO Huntail. Electrode can outpace the Mixed Sweeper set and OHKO with Thunder or Thunderbolt, but unless it runs maximum Speed, it will be outsped by the physical sweeper and take massive damage from Aqua Tail before KOing Huntail. Scarf Rotom and positive Speed Scarf Venusaur can both outrun either set and OHKO Huntail with Thunderbolt or Leaf Storm respectively; however, Rotom must be wary of Sucker Punch and Venusaur will be maimed by Ice Beam if it switches into it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rain Dance Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set is designed for Huntail to come in late-game and finish off the remainder of an opponent's team, hitting the final few Pokemon in their weaker defensive stats. In order to be effective, Huntail needs to have rain falling, which not only doubles Huntail's awful Speed with Swift Swim, but also increases the power of its STAB moves.</p> <p>Aqua Tail is Huntail's strongest physical STAB move, and with it, it can 2HKO 252/0 Registeel and OHKO Chansey after Stealth Rock. Waterfall can be used instead if you're worried about accuracy issues; however, it misses out on many KOs that Aqua Tail provides, making it an inferior choice. Ice Beam is for any Grass-type who would otherwise wall Huntail, such as Tangrowth and Leafeon, dealing an OHKO to each after Stealth Rock. A combination of Aqua Tail and Ice Beam also KOes 252/252 Calm Venusaur. Hydro Pump deals a clean 2HKO on physically defensive Uxie and Registeel, which would normally wall this set entirely. Hidden Power Grass is for weaker Water-types that would normally have their way with Huntail; however, it still isn't strong enough to break through bulkier Water-types, such as Milotic, Blastoise, Poliwrath, and Slowking.</p> <p>The given EVs allow Huntail to get the KOs listed and ensure that it is dealing the most damage as possible from both attacking stats. With this spread, Huntail reaches a Speed stat of 390, enough to outpace every Pokemon in the tier under rain bar Electrode and certain Choice Scarf users, such as Rotom and positive Speed Venusaur.</p> <p>Other notable moves available to Huntail include Sucker Punch and Super Fang. Super Fang can be used in place of Hydro Pump to strip Huntail's counters of half of their health and force them to heal themselves, during which one of Huntail's teammates, such as Ludicolo, can come in for free. However, without Hydro Pump, Huntail misses out on the KOs on Uxie and Registeel, which can then proceed to paralyze Huntail with Thunder Wave, effectively ending its sweep. Sucker Punch can be used in place of Hidden Power Grass, giving Huntail some utility and priority outside of rain; however, it doesn't give Huntail any further coverage and has little use under rain, which is where Huntail should always be used. Huntail can set up its own Rain Dance, with its decent defensive stats protecting it from whatever onslaught may ensue; however, it needs as much coverage as possible to allow it to sweep, and Huntail is usually too slow to set up itself.</p> <p>As a mixed rain sweeper, Huntail faces competition from Floatzel, which can use almost the same set and is faster than Huntail even without any Speed investment. Huntail, however, has a few notable perks over Floatzel. Firstly, Huntail has far greater bulk than Floatzel, which protects it from random weak attacks like Mach Punch from Hitmontop and Earthquake from Tangrowth. Second, Huntail has access to Hydro Pump and a slightly higher Special Attack stat, allowing it to bypass physically defensive Uxie and Registeel, which Floatzel can't do. And lastly, Huntail's priority in Sucker Punch provides greater power than Floatzel's Aqua Jet outside of rain, though in rain, Aqua Jet proves more powerful.</p> <p>As mentioned earlier, Huntail is stopped cold by bulky Water-types, so teammates that can dispose of them make good partners to Huntail. Ludicolo in particular can easily dispose of the pesky Water-types and also makes a good sweeping partner to Huntail, either softening up the opposing team and removing Water-types that would otherwise prevent Huntail from sweeping, or sweeping after Huntail has disposed of problematic Pokemon such as Uxie, Registeel, or Venusaur. Lanturn also makes a good partner to Huntail, absorbing any Electric attacks or Thunder Waves that may come in Huntail's direction. Lanturn also enjoys Huntail's ability to remove special walls such as Chansey from play, which would normally wall Lanturn to oblivion and back.</p> <p>Gardevoir with Trace, Golduck with Cloud Nine, Toxicroak with Dry Skin, and Electrode have few problems countering this set, so bulky Pokemon that can withstand their attacks make good partners to Huntail. Uxie makes a good partner, taking little damage from whatever the opposing Pokemon may throw at Huntail and paralyzing them with Thunder Wave (or in Toxicroak's case, removing it with Psychic) to allow Huntail to come in later in the match and dispose of them. Uxie can also provide Stealth Rock support, which Huntail thrives on, as it allows it to accumulate many of the listed KOs.</p>"

      "Rain Dance Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Unlike the previous set, this one focuses on Huntail's higher base 104 Attack stat. While offensively weaker than Kabutops, Huntail sports better typing and a way to bypass bulky Grass-types. Because of this, Huntail and Kabutops can be used on the same team, with Huntail softening up the opposing team and Kabutops coming in later to finish the job. Aqua Tail and Double-Edge provide Huntail with the awesome type combination of Water / Normal, resisted only by Shedinja in UU. Ice Beam is for any bulky Grass-types that are bull-headed enough to think they can counter this set. Crunch makes an appearance on this set to allow Huntail to dispose of Slowking and also deals decent damage to its counterpart, Slowbro. Sucker Punch gives Huntail some use outside of rain and is a nice way to hit Pokemon like Scarf Rotom or Mismagius, which would otherwise outpace Huntail even in the rain and KO with Thunderbolt.</p> <p>The EVs are simple and maximize Huntail's physical prowess. With this spread, Huntail reaches a Speed stat of 406 under rain, outrunning the standard lead Electrode by two points. Naughty is the recommended Nature to allow Ice Beam to get the 2HKO on Leafeon and Tangrowth while still raising Huntail's attack stat.</p> <p>Unlike the previous set, this one has some troubles with physically defensive Uxie, which can paralyze Huntail and end its sweep. Therefore, partners that can set up on or wall Uxie, such as Mismagius or Registeel, make good teammates for Huntail. However, Mismagius must also be wary of Thunder Wave, and Registeel has to watch out for Trick sets. Ludicolo and Lanturn make good partners to Huntail, removing any bulky Water-types that block Huntail's path. Special sweepers that enjoy special walls such as Chansey out of the picture, such as Omastar and Gorebyss, also make good teammates, as they in turn remove Pokemon such as Toxicroak, Uxie, and Registeel with little trouble.</p>"

  "Gorebyss": {
    "overview": "<p>Rain teams are a powerful force to be reckoned with in 4th Gen UU, and it's no accident that Gorebyss is a common feature on most of them. Its praiseworthy Special Attack and its ability to outspeed the entire tier in the rain make it a dangerous foe to face. Gorebyss can even function as a successful Baton Passer when rain is not in play. Despite less-than-stellar base HP and Speed stats, Gorebyss remains a serious threat for an unprepared team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gorebyss has very few options outside of these specific niches. Turning Gorebyss into an Agility sweeper is possible, but it lacks the raw power of the rain sweeper, and will still fail to outpace Choice Scarf Rotom. On the Baton Pass set, passing Aqua Ring, Iron Defense, or Amnesia instead of Substitute is possible, but it is an inferior option. Shadow Ball and Signal Beam round off Gorebyss's special movepool, but they are highly inferior options to its other attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>When utilizing the Swift Swim Sweeper set, Gorebyss's true counters are sparse. Specially Defensive Milotic can work if Gorebyss is carrying a Life Orb, as it can cripple Gorebyss with Toxic or KO it with Hidden Power Grass while healing off damage with Recover. Toxicroak also poses a problem if it switches in on anything other than Psychic, as it can KO a weakened Gorebyss with Sucker Punch. Ludicolo is a dire threat, since Gorebyss has nothing that can even hit Ludicolo for super effective damage (outside of Bounce), while Ludicolo will always OHKO back with Energy Ball. One of Gorebyss's greatest fears are priority moves, which can quickly wear it down to KO range. Rotom, the most common UU Choice Scarf user, is also one of Gorebyss's most common checks, since it will always outspeed Gorebyss with a Timid nature. Positive nature Choice Scarf Venusaur and Electrode do likewise, while Registeel can survive Gorebyss's onslaught and cripple it with Thunder Wave.</p> <p>The counters list for the Baton Pass set is much less specific. Phazers can cause problems, as they mess up the Baton Pass chain and negate Gorebyss's boosts. Haze Milotic or Weezing also stop Gorebyss from doing anything productive. Taunt prevents Gorebyss from passing on its boosts or setting up, leaving it a veritable sitting duck, well, fish.</p>",

      "Swift Swim Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>With an admirable base 114 Special Attack stat and enough Speed to outpace any UU Pokemon with Swift Swim activated, this South Sea Pokemon makes an excellent rain sweeper. Hydro Pump is Gorebyss's most powerful STAB attack, capable of OHKOing or 2HKOing almost anything that lacks a resistance or immunity to it. Surf is also an option for more accuracy, though it lacks the raw power of a rain-boosted Hydro Pump. Ice Beam complements Gorebyss's Water STAB nicely, landing super effective hits on the annoyingly ubiquitous Grass-types. Hidden Power Grass allows Gorebyss to cut through opposing Water-types, creating nigh-unresisted coverage in UU. In the last slot, Psychic is used to eliminate Toxicroak, Poliwrath, and Qwilfish, the former two of whom sport abilities that give them immunity to Water and would otherwise create endless amounts of trouble for a Rain Dance team.</p> <p>The current EV spread maximizes Gorebyss's potent Special Attack, and maximum Speed ensures that Gorebyss will always outspeed Jolly Swellow and anything slower with Rain Dance in play. Life Orb gives Gorebyss the power it desires and the versatility to switch moves, but Choice Specs is also a noteworthy option, as a Choice Specs rain-boosted Hydro Pump hits extremely hard, capable of 2HKOing Chansey and Milotic with just Stealth Rock support.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Gorebyss's movepool is extremely shallow, which leaves this fish high and dry with few remaining options. What little that it does get, however, should be used in the last slot in lieu of Psychic. Rain Dance can be used on a Life Orb set to prolong Gorebyss's sweep even after the previous bout of rain has ended. Baton Pass can be used on a Choice Specs set to scout the opponent's rain checks before committing Gorebyss to an attack. Aqua Tail can be used with Life Orb and a Rash nature if you really fear Chansey; Gorebyss will be able to 2HKO Chansey after Stealth Rock, though it's probably more efficient to just blast her with Specs Hydro Pump anyway.</p> <p>This Gorebyss requires the use of entry hazards, particularly Stealth Rock, to function to its maximum potential. Uxie and Mesprit can both set up Stealth Rock and provide Rain Dance support, making them excellent partners for Gorebyss. Registeel can do the same, while Gorebyss scares away the Ground- and Fire-type Pokemon that are the bane of Registeel's existence. Other rain sweepers are also excellent teammates. Ludicolo deserves a special mention because it can defeat Milotic, the most troublesome rain check in UU.</p>"

      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>This set lets the pink menace take a more supportive role as a Baton Passer. Although Gorebyss has a plethora of moves it could pass, Agility is the most effective, allowing a teammate to reach blistering levels of Speed for a lightning-fast sweep. Substitute safeguards Gorebyss and the Baton Pass recipient from harmful status effects, in addition to providing cover from incoming attacks. Finally, Surf ensures that Gorebyss isn't rendered a complete deadweight by Taunt, since even with only a meager investment in Special Attack it still hits decently hard.</p> <p>Gorebyss's EV spread allows it to outpace positive nature base 80 Speed Choice Scarf Pokemon after an Agility. This ensures that it can create a Substitute or Baton Pass against Choice Scarf Venusaur without worrying about being tranquilized by Sleep Powder.</p> <p>In addition to Agility, Gorebyss could also potentially pass Iron Defense, Amnesia, or Aqua Ring to a suitable recipient. The latter is worth noting because Gorebyss is the only Pokemon in UU capable of Baton Passing Aqua Ring. Pinch Berries, such as Liechi or Petaya, could be used in conjunction with Substitute to send offensive boosts along with Agility.</p> <p>Baton Pass Gorebyss requires two types of Pokemon: lures so it can switch in and set up, and recipients to pass its boosts to. Grass-types such as Venusaur and Tangrowth can fulfill both roles, since they draw in Fire- and Ice-type attacks, which are resisted by Gorebyss, and also resist Gorebyss's Electric- and Grass-type weaknesses. Other Baton Passers, such as Leafeon, Gligar, and Ambipom, also make good teammates, as they can form a Baton Pass chain for Gorebyss to fit into.</p>"

  "Relicanth": {
    "overview": "<p>Although it's seen as \"just another Rock-type\" by many, Relicanth has several positive niches that make it a strong Pokemon. It is faster than most other Rock-type Pokemon, has usable Attack, and has splendid physical bulk. In comparison to Aggron, its Water sub-typing makes it less susceptible to Ground-type Pokemon. Relicanth's Water / Rock typing also grants it a useful dual resistance to Fire, along with resistances to Normal, Flying, Ice, and Poison. Movepool-wise, Relicanth has access to a variety of moves that offer great coverage and support. However, the main selling point of using Relicanth is its access to Head Smash, which, when combined with Rock Head, makes for a deadly sweeper.</p> <p>It's not all sunshine for Relicanth though. Relicanth's horrible Special Defense stat makes it unlikely to live through several neutral special attacks. That poor Speed in comparison to the rest of the metagame makes you want to gouge your eyes out. It also comes with a dual weakness to Grass, as well as weaknesses to Fighting, Ground, and Electric. Nevertheless, Relicanth can be one of the most devastating Pokemon in a blink of an eye.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Relicanth is really limited in its movepool, so there's no doubt that there are hardly any other moves to use. Bounce has the niche of hitting Grass-types super effectively off of Relicanth's Attack stat, but it requires two turns, can miss, and is, most of the time, just not strong enough. A RestTalk set can be used courtesy of Relicanth's bulky physical defense, though Relicanth has too many weaknesses and will be too weak offensively to be much of a threat. Toxic is available to cripple bulky Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Leafeon, and Donphan, but it's better to just chip their HP away with Head Smash or Waterfall. Substitute is a neat option to prevent status and critical hits from ruining Relicanth's day if you can find a moveslot for it. Due to the presence of Yawn and Stealth Rock, you could run a supporter tank set; however, the lack of recovery makes it fairly uninteresting, though the set isn't terrible.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Despite Relicanth's deadly offensive prowess, it has several hard counters. Bulky physically defensive Grass-types such as Tangrowth, Leafeon, and Torterra can take a hit and OHKO back with a STAB attack. Likewise, bulky Fighting-types such as Hitmontop and Hariyama can survive Relicanth's assaults and 2HKO back with Close Combat; as a bonus, Hitmontop has access to Intimidate to lower Relicanth's damage output. Although they take heavy damage from Relicanth's attacks, other bulky Pokemon such as Donphan, Poliwrath, Uxie, and Registeel can still take a hit and dent it with a super effective attack or afflict it with status. Although uncommon, Quagsire gets a special mention as a counter due to its immunity to Water, resistance to Rock, and access to reliable recovery in Recover, which allows it to switch in on Relicanth easily. In terms of checks, faster Pokemon such as Rotom, Venusaur, Moltres, and Milotic can threaten Relicanth with a super effective move provided that they can switch in on a resisted attack or immunity. Fighting-type priority attacks from the likes of Toxicroak and Blaziken can pick off any weakened Relicanth. Lastly, afflicting status such as burn, paralysis, and poison will greatly hamper Relicanth's ability to sweep.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its high Base Power attacks, just good enough Speed, and Rock Head, Relicanth can threaten to bulldoze through any team with correct prediction. Head Smash offers Relicanth the ability to obliterate most Pokemon while causing huge dents on even those that resist it. Aqua Tail goes hand in hand with Head Smash by smashing most Ground- and Rock-type Pokemon, while also hitting Fighting- and Steel-types for neutral damage. Waterfall can be used instead of Aqua Tail if you dislike imperfect accuracy, though at the cost of lower damage. Earthquake covers every other Pokemon that resist, take little damage from, or are immune to Head Smash and Aqua Tail - Toxicroak, Quagsire, Poliwrath, and Registeel are a few examples. The last slot is mainly a filler, but Double-Edge gives Relicanth a wide range of neutral coverage should you find a situation where you can't trust your prediction skills.</p> <p>To demonstrate the power of this set, here are some damage calculations (with a Jolly nature):</p> <ul> <li>Head Smash vs. 252/252+ Uxie: 48.3% - 57.1%</li> <li>Head Smash vs. 252/0 Donphan: 31.8% - 37.5%</li> <li>Head Smash vs. 252/252+ Milotic: 60.6% - 71.8%</li> <li>Head Smash vs. 0/4 Venusaur: 110% - 129.9%</li> <li>Head Smash vs. 252/252+ Slowbro: 49% - 57.9%</li> <li>Aqua Tail vs. 252/0 Donphan: 76.6% - 90.6%</li> <li>Aqua Tail (-1) vs. 252/252+ Hitmontop: 28% - 33.6%</li> <li>Aqua Tail vs. 252/4 Registeel: 33% - 39%</li> <li>Aqua Tail vs. 0/4 Torterra: 48.9% - 58%</li> <li>Waterfall vs. 252/0 Donphan: 67.7% - 80.2%</li> <li>Waterfall (-1) vs. Hitmontop: 25% - 29.9%</li> <li>Earthquake vs. 252/4 Registeel: 49.5% - 58.2%</li> <li>Earthquake vs. 252/4 Poliwrath: 34.4% - 40.6%</li> <li>Double-Edge vs. 252/252+ Quagsire: 31% - 36.5%</li> <li>Double-Edge vs. 252/4 Poliwrath: 41.1% - 48.7%</li> </ul> <p>With a Jolly nature, Relicanth reaches 229 Speed, outspeeding most walls, mainly defensive Leafeon, defensive Arcanine, and support Uxie. Moreover, it allows Relicanth to speed tie with positive-natured Exeggutor, Ursaring, and Omastar. However, using an Adamant nature still puts Relicanth in a useful Speed tier with a stat of 209, as it lets the rock fish outspeed Milotic, Blastoise, and neutral-natured max Speed base 50s while increasing Relicanth's offensive prowess. The EVs are self-explanatory: max Attack to deal the highest amount of damage possible, whereas max Speed lets Relicanth outspeed as much as it can. In the last slot, Stone Edge or Rock Slide can be used in case Head Smash runs out of PP. Rock Slide gives Relicanth a reliable Rock-type attack, though Stone Edge offers more power. Choice Scarf is a valuable alternative item on this set, as with an Adamant nature, Relicanth attains 313 Speed, or 343 Speed with Jolly. However, Relicanth becomes quite weak offensively, but it can still be strong as long as Head Smash hits. Another option for this set is to use Swift Swim as the ability. In the rain, Relicanth will become fast enough to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, and with a Choice Band intact, it will present a formidable threat to the foe.</p> <p>Relicanth has trouble against bulky Fighting-types, such as Intimidate Hitmontop and Hariyama, and bulky Grass-types, such as Tangrowth, Exeggutor, and Leafeon. As such, having a Flying-type such as Moltres and Scyther can be extremely useful for switching in on these threats and eliminating them with Air Slash and Aerial Ace, respectively. Faster Pokemon are also nuisances to this set. Paralysis support provided by Registeel, Uxie, and Clefable can cripple such threats. Lastly, Relicanth appreciates type synergy from the likes of Venusaur, Rotom, and Leafeon. Venusaur has the ability to sleep a foe, Rotom can spread burns and annoy teams with a Substitute set, and Leafeon can provide Wish support and phazing.</p>"

      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<p>With shabby Speed, great offenses and coverage, incredible physical bulk, and the ability to force switches, Relicanth makes a natural candidate for a Rock Polish set. Rock Polish boosts its Speed from a low 209 to an amazing 418, outspeeding even Electrode. Head Smash obliterates most of the metagame, while Waterfall takes care of any stragglers and has a chance to flinch. Aqua Tail is a fine alternative over Waterfall for more power at the cost of lower accuracy. For the last slot, Earthquake is used to deal more damage to Registeel, Toxicroak, and Poliwrath, which would otherwise give this set a world of trouble.</p> <p>Jolly over Adamant can be useful to outspeed more threats. With Jolly, Relicanth reaches 458 Speed, outspeeding +1 positive-natured base 87s and below, including Choice Scarf Venusaur and Choice Scarf Hitmonlee. However, the loss of power from Adamant will usually be more of a curse to Relicanth as it will lose out on many useful KOs.</p> <p>As a rule of thumb, you should generally not use Rock Polish until you know two facts: that your foe's team has been fully revealed and that it is overall weakened. If you do not properly scout for counters, you will waste valuable turns by using Rock Polish. In contrast, if you do not weaken the foe's team, Relicanth cannot survive long enough to sweep. To help you accomplish these two factors, you can utilize phazers such as Roar Venusaur, Whirlwind Hariyama, the rare Perish Song Mismagius, and entry hazard users such as Uxie, Cloyster, and Drapion. Venusaur has resistances to Fighting, Electric, and Grass, can sleep foes with Sleep Powder, and help break down walls with Swords Dance-boosted attacks. Hariyama may not provide many resistances for Relicanth, but it is a solid status absorber due to Guts or its ability to RestTalk. Overall, Mismagius is great at supporting Relicanth thanks to its immunity to Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, access to useful status moves in the form of Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp, and ability to break stall with Taunt. Uxie, Cloyster, and Drapion are all fairly bulky enough to set up entry hazards reliably throughout a match, but take caution as they all lack a reliable recovery move.</p>"
      },
      "Rain Dance Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Despite the fact that without Rock Head Relicanth will be taking huge recoil damage from Head Smash, it can still successfully utilize its other ability, Swift Swim, to sweep under rainy conditions. Head Smash is Relicanth's main attack, and it dents even Pokemon that resist the move. Aqua Tail comes off Relicanth's secondary STAB and smacks Fighting- and Ground-types that try to switch in on Head Smash. If you despise Aqua Tail's accuracy, you can replace it with Waterfall for its perfect accuracy and chance to flinch. Earthquake rounds out the coverage by hitting Toxicroak, Poliwrath, and Registeel for good damage. In the last slot, Rain Dance is preferred to set up rain if it is not present, but Stone Edge is a perfectly viable option in case Relicanth is taking too much recoil from Head Smash.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is recommended to dish out as much damage as possible. Still, a Jolly nature, alongside 240 Speed EVs, can be used to outspeed every Pokemon up to Jolly Choice Scarf Hitmonlee in the rain. The Speed EVs allow Relicanth to reach 384 Speed with Swift Swim's boost, outpacing even Swellow. Attack is maxed out to increase Relicanth's damage output, while the remaining EVs are thrown into HP to provide more overall bulk, and to safeguard against Head Smash's recoil.</p> <p>You can effectively pair this Relicanth with a good variety of other Pokemon, not only to break down the opposition, but to support Relicanth. Other physical rain sweepers, such as Kabutops, Qwilfish, and Swords Dance Ludicolo, can barrage the opponent's defense, due to the heavy offensive pressure that the Pokemon will be causing. Kabutops has access to a powerful Stone Edge, in addition to priority Aqua Jet. Qwilfish can absorb Toxic Spikes, which are a nuisance to rain teams, and utilize Explosion to eliminate a troublesome Pokemon. Ludicolo is an excellent partner due to its access to STAB Energy Ball, which allows it to eliminate bulky Water-types that may get in Relicanth's way. Obviously, Relicanth wants Rain Dance supporters such as Uxie, Registeel, and Electrode so that it can rain on the foe's parade. Uxie and Registeel can also set up Stealth Rock reliably in order to weaken the foe's team. With its blazing base 140 Speed, Electrode will almost always set up Rain Dance while Taunting cheeky foes. Additionally, Registeel and Electrode can Explode to not only eliminate or dent the foe, but to give Relicanth a safe switch-in. More useful Rain Dance supporters include Lanturn and Rotom, since they can abuse the rain with either boosted Surfs (for Lanturn) or 100% accurate Thunders.</p>"

Ice Beam is for all these Grass-types that have way too much Special Defense to hurt anyway, but I suppose I just like the words \"It's super effective\" on your screen. Toxic shows off Luvdisc's amazing stalling power with 43 HP, 55 Defense and 65 Special Defense, but Hidden Power Electric is there if you're afraid of Pelipper or (God forbid) a hostile Luvdisc!</p>"},

  "Shelgon": {
    "overview": "<p>Shelgon is a rather overlooked Pokemon in UU, mainly due to his NFE status. However, one who looks past such a label will notice quite a few reasons to use him. With the strongest Outrage in the UU metagame, good physical Defense, and a good boosting move in Dragon Dance, Shelgon can sweep unprepared teams.</p> <p>However, Shelgon is not without downsides. His Speed and Special Defense are extremely poor. While he can boost his Speed with Dragon Dance, he will still be outsped by faster attackers like Mismagius and Alakazam, who are extremely common in the UU tier. His poor Special Defense means that you must go out of your way to compensate in order for Shelgon to be used effectively. Shelgon needs to be well-supported in a team or not used at all.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Band set with attacks like Crunch, Rock Slide, and Fire Fang can be used, but is inadvisable due to Shelgon's terrible Speed and Special Defense. On the topic of Shelgon's other attacks, while they are available to Shelgon, it is best to stick to the moves given, as the rest of the attacks lack power and do not provide much additional coverage. Shelgon also has a wonderful special movepool, but his lackluster Special Attack does let him down. However, one may use a Choice Specs Shelgon lure in physical walls like Steelix or Slowbro and 2HKO them with Fire Blast or Draco Meteor. Iron Defense is also an option, but would generally be useless because Shelgon would be forced out by special attacks anyway.</p> <p>Shelgon can also go on a defensive route by utilizing a set with Wish, Protect, and Roar to wall physical threats like Aggron and Rhyperior. However, lack of Attack investment means that he is difficult to threaten said physical threats in any way, meaning Shelgon will lose eventually. Similarly, Shelgon can also run a RestTalk set, but again, lack of the Attack investment means he is not going to win against many physical threats either.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Steelix and Registeel are easily the best counters to Shelgon, only fearing a boosted Brick Break when they drop to around 60% health. Steelix can easily force Shelgon out with Roar, and Registeel can use Thunder Wave to cripple him.</p> <p>Generally, the easiest way to remove Shelgon is by preying on his horrible Speed and attacking him with a powerful special attack. Anything faster than base 100 Speed with a powerful special attack that hits for neutral or super effective damage can either force Shelgon out or just KO him if he's locked into Outrage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Boasting the strongest Outrage in UU, Shelgon can easily poke gaping holes into the opposition's team after a Dragon Dance. The idea is simple: Dragon Dance up whenever you get the chance and start attacking. Outrage is for pure power, while Brick Break is Shelgon's strongest option against the Steel-types in UU who resist Outrage. Dragon Claw is mainly a filler move, but it allows Shelgon to dish out damage without having to lock himself into Outrage and potentially getting revenge killed.</p> <p>To demonstrate the power of Shelgon after he has used Dragon Dance, here are some damage calculations:</p> <ul> <li>+1 Outrage vs 252/252+ Milotic: 73.44% - 86.72%</li> <li>+1 Outrage vs 252/252+ Slowbro: 57.87% - 68.02%</li> <li>+1 Outrage vs 252/252+ Uxie: 57.06% - 67.23%</li> <li>+1 Outrage vs 252/252+ Tangrowth: 51.98% - 61.14%</li> <li>+1 Brick Break vs. 252/0 Registeel: 54.95% - 64.84%</li> <li>+1 Brick Break vs. 252/0 Steelix: 43.12% - 50.92%</li> </ul> <p>The EVs are relatively simple. Attack is maximized to deal as much damage as possible. 228 Speed EVs allow Shelgon to outrun neutral base 95s after a Dragon Dance, assuming an Adamant nature, although one may elect to run Jolly to outspeed their positive-natured counterparts. The rest of the EVs are dumped in HP, giving Shelgon some bulk. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 28 Atk / 228 Spe can also be used if one prefers bulk over immediate power. With this spread, Substitute and Leftovers can replace Dragon Claw and Life Orb, as the aim is for a more gradual sweep.</p> <p>While Shelgon packs enormous power, his poor Speed and Special Defense make it difficult to be able set up a Dragon Dance. It is a good idea to incorporate Encore and U-turn users to give Shelgon a free switch and an opportunity to set up. Dual screens are extremely beneficial to Shelgon. Clefable is possibly one of the best Encore users in UU due to her bulk and reliable recovery. She can also act as a defensive pivot to take special attacks aimed at Shelgon. Poliwrath and Azumarill can Encore and are capable of switching into the Ice attacks that are normally aimed at Shelgon. Lopunny and Mr. Mime gets special mentions for being able to use Encore and allowing Shelgon to switch in with Baton Pass; however, they are also defensively lacking and add to a team's frailty. Shelgon should preferably Dragon Dance on relatively weak-hitting enemies like Chansey and Uxie, but one must watch out for Thunder Wave and other forms of status, as they will either completely cripple Shelgon or deeply cut into his sweep.</p> <p>It is best to keep Shelgon for late-game, when faster special attackers have been eliminated or incapacitated, before attempting to sweep. It is also a good idea to eliminate or weaken any Steel-types on the opposing team as well. While this may sound like a lot of support, there are Pokemon who can do more than one of the above simultaneously. Magneton can trap Steels like Steelix and Registeel and hammer them with STAB Thunderbolts or a super effective Hidden Power Fire, although Magneton will generally lose to Registeel with Seismic Toss. The magnet can also set up dual screens for Shelgon. Dugtrio is another great partner to run alongside Shelgon, as he can trap and severely wound Steels not named Steelix so that Shelgon can just Brick Break through them. Bulky status spreaders like Uxie can also Thunder Wave faster opponents while setting up dual screens for Shelgon. Uxie can also use Memento to give Shelgon a free switch. Pokemon who can lay down Spikes also help Shelgon out immensely, as they can wear down opponents enough to get them into Outrage's kill range. Omastar and Cloyster are probably the best Spikers in the UU tier due to their great Defense and their ability to switch into Ice attacks directed at Shelgon and proceed to set up Spikes.</p>"

  "Metang": {
    "overview": "<p>While the other pseudo-legendaries' pre-evolved forms have seen occasional use in UU thanks to the scarcity of Dragon-types in the tier, Metang is truly an uncommon sight, and it's not too hard to see why. With substandard Attack and Speed stats and poor coverage on its STAB attacks, Metang has virtually no offensive presence. It even lacks Seismic Toss, which most non-threatening Pokemon often rely on for consistent damage. It is also almost entirely outclassed by Registeel, which boasts equal or better stats in every category and a similar movepool.</p> <p>Metang does have a few perks, however, that save it from being entirely forgettable. Its excellent defensive typing grants it eight resistances, one immunity, and only two weaknesses. Its defensive stats, while not especially impressive, are respectable enough to take advantage of its typing. Most importantly, it has a solid support movepool that includes Reflect, Light Screen, and Trick, all of which Registeel lacks. Make sure to play Metang to these specific strengths, or it will be outclassed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Metang has a nice physical movepool that includes Zen Headbutt, Earthquake, Ice Punch, Thunder Punch, Brick Break, Rock Slide, Bullet Punch, and Pursuit; unfortunately, it lacks both the power and the Speed necessary to be an offensive threat. However, a Choice Band set with Trick and Explosion can potentially cripple two opposing Pokemon per match with good prediction. Gyro Ball is an alternate Steel-type STAB move, but Metang's Speed isn't quite low enough to make it worth using over Meteor Mash. With decent defenses, access to Explosion, and only one weakness in the rain, Metang can be a successful Rain Dance supporter, although Registeel completely outclasses it in this role. Gravity is also an option, but it's rarely worth building a team around, and Metang itself doesn't benefit very much from it. Magnet Rise eliminates Metang's weakness to Ground-type attacks, but the turn it takes to use would usually be better spent setting up screens or Stealth Rock.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Rotom is immune to Explosion, resists Meteor Mash, and can use Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, or Pain Split to cripple any sweeper Metang is trying to set up. Steelix's titanic Defense and resistances to Meteor Mash and Explosion mean it's barely dented by Metang's attacks, and it can use Roar to simply phaze away Metang's teammates as they attempt to set up. Magneton resists Metang's attacks and can trap it with Magnet Pull, but it can't stop Metang from putting up its screens and Exploding. In general, Taunt turns Metang into dead weight.</p>",

      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>Metang is the only Steel-type in UU that can set up dual screens (other than Magneton, whose 4x weakness to Ground makes it a poor choice for this role), giving it a unique niche. With numerous resistances and only two weaknesses to Ground- and Fire-type attacks, Metang draws in very different counters compared to Uxie, Claydol, and other popular dual screen users. This makes it an interesting partner for Pokemon such as Charizard and Altaria, both of which can come in virtually for free on Ground- and Fire-type moves and set up with Dragon Dance from behind the screens.</p> <p>Light Screen and Reflect are obvious on this set, and Metang's decent bulk means it will almost always be able to set both up. Stealth Rock is always a valuable support option for any team, enabling easier KOs for sweepers and punishing opposing switches. However, Meteor Mash is also an option to keep Metang from being set-up bait; the damage output won't knock your socks off, but it is enough to prevent Mismagius from setting up a Substitute in Metang's face. In the final slot, Explosion is an excellent choice to heavily damage any Pokemon that doesn't resist it while guaranteeing your sweeper gets in unmolested.</p> <p>The given EV spread essentially guarantees Metang won't be OHKOed through its screens by even the most powerful STAB super effective attacks, allowing it to at least set both screens up before it goes down. From behind the appropriate screen, Metang will always survive an Adamant Choice Band Rhyperior's Earthquake, Jolly Choice Band Blaziken's Flare Blitz, and Timid Choice Specs Moltres's Fire Blast. A more standard spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with an Impish nature is also perfectly reasonable; super effective special attacks will be a problem in this case, but Metang will have an easier time switching in and setting up screens against physical attackers in general. Either way, it's a good idea to bring some insurance in case the strategy doesn't work the first time. Wish support from Chansey or Clefable can restore Metang's health, giving it a second chance, while bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Slowbro can take on powerful Fire- and Ground-types if Metang has taken too much damage to survive their assaults.</p> <p>This set is meant to be paired with Pokemon that can take advantage of the Earthquakes and Fire Blasts that will often be thrown Metang's way. Altaria and Charizard are immune to Ground and resist Fire-type attacks, and both can set up multiple Dragon Dance boosts from behind dual screens. Mismagius has Levitate and can become incredibly threatening with just a single free turn to set up Nasty Plot or a Substitute. Chatot may seem like an odd choice, but it can Encore opposing Earthquakes and use Nasty Plot to become a surprisingly powerful sweeper. Finally, Gligar can take advantage of dual screens to set up Agility and Swords Dance boosts and Baton Pass them to a powerful sweeper that will steamroll the opponent's team.</p>"

Plus, Waterfall and Return already achieve all of the KOs Bibarel needs. The only other physical options available to Bibarel are Focus Punch and Superpower. Neither provides Bibarel with any extra coverage, and Superpower's Defense and Attack drops are doubled thanks to Simple. Bibarel can go the special attacking route as well; however, Bibarel's Special Attack stat sits at a meager base 55. Charge Beam, Grass Knot, Ice Beam, Surf, Thunderbolt, and Shadow Ball round out Bibarel's special movepool.</p> <p>Bibarel also has boosting moves in Curse and Amnesia; however, Bibarel is not fast nor bulky enough to set up by itself and can make much better use of Speed and Attack boosts passed to it.

The rest of Bibarel's usable movepool consists of Stealth Rock, Yawn, and Thunder Wave. While all have their uses, Bibarel is much better off attacking and making use of its offensive prowess than supporting the team.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Should Bibarel be successful in receiving both a Swords Dance and an Agility boost, little in UU can stop a Bibarel sweep. Registeel stands the best chance of not being OHKOed by Bibarel's assaults; however, it has no way of OHKOing Bibarel back. Keep in mind that Registeel should not attempt to use Thunder Wave as Bibarel will more than likely use Taunt on Registeel before it can paralyze it. Hitmontop, Blaziken, and Toxicroak can attempt to snipe Bibarel with Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, but Quick Attack will do a number on all of them. Shedinja is completely immune to both of Bibarel's STABs and can put a stop to a Bibarel sweep. However, Bibarel can bypass Shedinja with Pluck or Toxic, and entry hazards will prevent Shedinja from even entering battle. Tangrowth has a chance of surviving a Swords Dance-boosted Return with Stealth Rock down and can proceed to either put Bibarel to sleep or give it some major whiplash with Power Whip.</p> <p>Without any boosts, Bibarel is nothing more than a sitting duck. Electric-types such as Manectric, Rotom, and Lanturn can fry any Bibarel with Thunderbolt; Grass-types such as Venusaur, Exeggutor, and Leafeon can slap Bibarel with their Grass-type attacks; and finally, Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee and Hariyama can pound Bibarel into oblivion with their STAB attacks.</p>",

      "Baton Pass Receiver": {
        "description": "<p>Although it has been cursed with a dull movepool and depressing base stats, Bibarel possesses an amazing ability, Simple. When combined with excellent dual STAB attacks that are only resisted by Shedinja in UU, Bibarel makes an impressive Baton Pass receiver.</p> <p>In preparation for a Bibarel sweep, you must know two important things. Firstly, Simple doubles the effect of stat boosts, and the effect is the same when Bibarel receives boosts from a Baton Passer. Secondly, in reverse, Simple also doubles stat drops that Bibarel receives. This could be unfortunate if Bibarel or your Baton Passer is caught on the end of an Intimidate. One can prevent Bibarel's intended Attack boost from dropping before it is passed by using a Baton Passer with the ability Hyper Cutter. The most notable example of this is Gligar, who is able to pass both Agility and Swords Dance boosts.</p> <p>With Return, Bibarel tears through walls like tissue paper, OHKOing Uxie, Weezing, and Milotic with Stealth Rock damage. Waterfall takes care of Steel-, Rock-, and Ghost-types, OHKOing Steelix, Regirock, and Spiritomb. Quick Attack is a viable option to beat Sucker Punch and all other priority after Bibarel is passed a Speed boost. The final move comes down to what specific actions you would like Bibarel to perform. Taunt will keep Haze, phazing moves, and status away from Bibarel, while Toxic will help make Bibarel more useful should it be forced into battle before acquiring multiple boosts. Superpower can be used as an emergency Registeel removal; however, the Attack and Defense drops are doubled, so its use is highly cautioned.</p> <p>The subsequent calculations assume that Bibarel is equipped with a Life Orb and is passed at least one Swords Dance (this converts to +4 when the boosts are passed to Bibarel).</p> <ul> <li>+4 Life Orb Return vs 252 HP / 252 Def Impish Tangrowth: 81.2% - 95.8%</li> <li> <ul> <li>+4 Life Orb Return vs 252 HP / 252 Def Impish Uxie: 90.7% - 106.8%</li> </ul> </li> <li> <ul> <li>+4 Life Orb Return vs 252 HP / 252 Def Bold Slowbro: 91.4% - 107.6%</li> </ul> </li> <li> <ul> <li>+4 Life Orb Return vs 248 HP / 252 Def Bold Milotic: 113.7% - 133.8%</li> </ul> </li> <li> <ul> <li>+4 Life Orb Return vs 252 HP / 252 Def Bold Weezing: 101.5% - 119.5%</li> </ul> </li> <li> <ul> <li>+4 Life Orb Return vs 252 HP / 252 Def Impish Drapion: 104.7% - 123.3%</li> </ul> </li> <li> <ul> <li>+4 Life Orb Waterfall vs 252 HP / 252 Def Impish Steelix: 102.3% - 120.9%</li> </ul> </li> <li> <ul> <li>+4 Life Orb Waterfall vs 252 HP / 252 Def Impish Regirock: 99.5% - 117.6%</li> </ul> </li> <li> <ul> <li>+4 Life Orb Waterfall vs 252 HP / 0 Def Impish Registeel: 73.6% - 86.8%</li> </ul> </li> <li> <ul> <li>+4 Life Orb Waterfall vs 252 HP / 252 Def Impish Spiritomb: 93.8% - 110.5%</li> </ul> </li> <li> <ul> <li>+4 Life Orb Quick Attack vs 0 HP / 0 Def Blaziken: 93% - 110%</li> </ul> </li> <li> <ul> <li>+4 Life Orb Quick Attack vs 252 HP / 0 Def Hitmontop: 71.4% - 84.2%</li> </ul> </li> <li> <ul> <li>+4 Life Orb Quick Attack vs 0 HP / 0 Def Absol: 116.6% - 137.6%</li> </ul> </li> <li></li> </ul> <p>The EV spread is straightforward: 252 Attack EVs paired with an Adamant nature maximizes Bibarel's offensive prowess. HP is also maximized in order to be able to get Bibarel in safely. No Speed EVs are necessary because after an Agility boost, Bibarel has an astounding 534 Speed, which is faster than every unboosted Pokemon in the UU tier. Lum Berry can be just as useful as Life Orb even if Bibarel is running Taunt, since Bibarel is completely open to status when it comes into battle unless a Substitute is part of the Baton Pass chain. Leftovers is another viable item choice, but it prevents Bibarel from OHKOing a few defensively oriented Pokemon.</p> <p>The idea behind this set is to pair Bibarel with a Pokemon that can not only Baton Pass a Speed boost, but also an Attack boost at the same time. The previously mentioned Gligar is therefore a necessity as a teammate. You are welcome to try out other Baton Passers, such as Leafeon; you might even try constructing a simple Baton Pass chain to increase your chances of success. A good model to follow is that of a Sleep Powder Agility Venomoth who Baton Passes to Gligar, who then Swords Dances and Baton Passes the final boosts to Bibarel. Bibarel, however, is not the \"bulkiest bulb\" around; dual screen and Wish support will make it easier to get Bibarel in and, once it's in position, to actually pull off a sweep. It is recommended that you make full use of Gligar, but other good supporters include the UU Eeveelutions. They can not only Baton Pass Wish, but also Swords Dance and dual screens (depending on which one you use). If you decide to use Leftovers instead of Life Orb, you might consider enhancing your Baton Pass chain to even pass defensive boosts like Amnesia and Barrier from Pokemon like Gorebyss or Stockpile from Drifblim. More information on the inner workings and strategy behind Baton Pass chains can be found here: http://www.smogon.com/dp/articles/baton_pass_chains.</p> <p>Bibarel is susceptible to Intimidate from the likes of Hitmontop and Arcanine, as the Attack drop is doubled thanks to Simple. Arcanine is not very threatening to Bibarel itself, being weak to Waterfall; however, with some smart switching it can quickly bring Bibarel's Attack stat down to less dangerous levels. In order to remedy this potential problem, pairing Bibarel with a Pokemon such as Altaria or Milotic can keep Arcanine at bay. Hitmontop can also make use of Intimidate as well as threaten Bibarel with Mach Punch. Pairing Bibarel with Drifblim is a good idea, as Drifblim can force Hitmontop out and then set up a Substitute to start the Baton Pass chain all over again.</p>"

  "Kricketune": {
    "overview": "<p>Kricketune is yet another simply awful Bug-type who is often referred to as an inferior Beedrill. This label is pretty accurate, as Kricketune sports a lesser Speed stat, a lack of 4x resistances to make up for its poor defenses, as well as barely any options with which to even try to support the team. Factor in a weakness to Stealth Rock, and one will find that Kricketune is a Pokemon who is really not worth using at all. Kricketune should never be an option on any serious competitive teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Kricketune has access to Screech, but Swords Dance is usually better as it does not get removed by a simple switch. Aerial Ace can be used to hit other Bug-types, but it is useless otherwise. Bug Bite can steal pinch Berries, but it is gimmicky and unreliable, making X-Scissor a more consistent option. Knock Off can remove an opposing Pokemon's item, which can be especially crippling to bulky Pokemon that lack recovery outside their precious Leftovers. Toxic is always useful to cripple bulky Water- and Ground-type switch-ins.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Poison-, Steel-, and Flying-types are the best counters against Kricketune; Weezing being particularly effective due to its high Defense stat and access to Flamethrower. Truthfully though, anything with decent stats can be an effective check to Kricketune. Pokemon with good defenses can easily come in and wall it, while Pokemon with good offensive stats should be able to outspeed Kricketune and cleanly OHKO it. It's not like Kricketune has many other options besides outright attacking anyway, so indirectly countering it with status is really quite pointless.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Though it is quite hard to set up at all when using Kricketune, Swords Dance is probably its best bet at sweeping; by doubling its Attack stat, Kricketune becomes at least slightly threatening. X-Scissor is the best STAB move available to Kricketune, and its power can even be boosted by Kricketune's ability, Swarm, when it is low on health. Brick Break offers the best coverage with X-Scissor, hitting Steel-types for super effective damage, while Night Slash can be used to target Ghost-types. Taunt can give Kricketune some nice setup opportunities against the likes of Chansey and Registeel, walls that might otherwise cripple it with status.</p> <p>Life Orb is the recommended item, as Kricketune needs all the power it can get to make up for his mediocre Attack stat. For this reason, an Adamant nature is also preferred. Kricketune can't outspeed too many additional threats when running a Jolly nature, so Adamant is almost always the better option. Lum Berry is an option over Life Orb and gives Kricketune a one-time status buffer which can either help it set up or sweep more easily. It should not be used alongside Taunt though, as they both serve essentially the same purpose. Sing can be used to put an opponent to sleep, but its accuracy is horrible, making it a less-than-reliable option.</p> <p>Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin spinners like Claydol are especially good when Kricketune is attempting a sweep. If Kricketune has Lum Berry or Taunt, a teammate that can lure out the likes of Chansey, such as Mismagius, can give Kricketune the perfect chance to actually set up. Packing Pokemon that can deal with its counters, namely Weezing and bulky Steel-types, particularly Fire-types such as Arcanine, will also help smoothen its endeavor. Finally, paralysis support can greatly benefit the sluggish Kricketune, and is one of the more useful team support options when it is trying to sweep. Uxie is a reliable status inducer, thanks to its gross amount of bulk, and can easily utilize Thunder Wave to bring paralysis onto most of any opponent's team.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Kricketune can run a Choice Scarf set to make up for its poor Speed stat, becoming a novelty revenge killer. X-Scissor is its primary STAB move, and if Kricketune manages to secure a Swarm boost, it becomes just as powerful as if Kricketune was using Megahorn. Brick Break is for Steel- and Rock-types, while Night Slash allows Kricketune to hit Ghost-types, and Return is a nice neutral attack that rounds off Kricketune's coverage.</p> <p>Maximum Speed is needed to outspeed positive-natured base 120s, the Speed tier where Kricketune's prime targets reside (namely Sceptile and Alakazam). However, an Adamant nature is fine as Kricketune will still outspeed base 105s, which is still a large portion of the UU metagame. Perish Song can be used in the last slot to finish off an opponent's final Pokemon, and it also counters Baton Pass teams that haven't yet acquired a Speed boost.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Kricketune really wants Rapid Spin support, more so than any other set, as being limited to a maximum of five switch-ins as a weak revenge killer is less than ideal. Other than that, Stealth Rock and Spikes help weaken the opponent's team gradually and breaks Focus Sashes.</p>"

  "Luxray": {
    "overview": "<p>Luxray is a rather unique Electric-type, sporting high Attack, low Speed, and Intimidate, which augments his decent bulk. This means that while most other pure Electric-types take on a sweeping role, Luxray is best suited to functioning as a wallbreaker. Luxray's offensive movepool -- although he lacks a strong physical STAB move -- is very good. With access to key wallbreaking moves in Superpower and Thunderbolt, and coverage moves like Crunch, Hidden Power, and Ice Fang, he can seriously damage just about anything with the correct move. Intimidate also lets him run defensive sets that play some niche defensive roles against physical Water- and Flying-types, making him a decent counter to the extremely troublesome physical rain sweepers.</p> <p>Despite these strong points, Luxray is generally overlooked in favor of other wallbreakers such as Blaziken, Nidoking, and Magmortar, who have numerous advantages over him in terms of power, versatility, and special coverage. Luxray retains some advantages over his fellow wallbreakers, namely his physical power and ease with which he deals with Water-types. Keep this in mind when choosing Luxray over other Pokemon who compete for his team slot. Luxray is also somewhat let down by his low Speed stat, which limits his offensive ability to taking out walls and hitting things on the switch. Intimidate is useful in this regard, as it helps Luxray force switches. Overall, Luxray has the potential to be very useful to your team, but make sure you play to his unique advantages.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Offensively, Quick Attack is an option on mixed or Choice sets to pick off weakened foes, but it is very weak and doesn't hit anything super effectively. The defensive set has some other support options it can run; Light Screen can cushion it on the special side, and it also helps you gain momentum if the opponent sends in a special attacker to deal with Luxray. Magnet Rise can turn the tables on Rhyperior, Registeel, and Dugtrio, but is very situational. Shed Shell is also an option on defensive sets to escape from Dugtrio, but usually should only be used in conjunction with Rest to ensure Luxray has a way to recover HP. Rest can be used on non-Sleep Talk sets to keep Luxray around longer, but only if you have a cleric on your team to wake him up with Heal Bell or Aromatherapy. While Intimidate is usually the ability of choice, Rivalry can be used to gain extra power on offensive sets. Unfortunately, some players run all-female teams to counteract this, which will cause Luxray problems. It is even less reliable on Wi-fi, as the even distribution of sexes will surely cause Luxray to lose power at inopportune times.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Luxray boasts great type coverage and mixed attacking stats, so not many things can switch in safely. Physically defensive Grass-types can counter any set without Ice Fang (or Choice sets not using Ice Fang) easily. Tangrowth can even avoid a 2HKO from a Choice Banded Ice Fang, making him an effective counter. Regirock can switch in on anything but a Choice Banded Superpower and OHKO Luxray with Earthquake. Nidoqueen can switch in on Thunderbolt or Superpower and threaten Luxray with Earthquake, although she should watch out for Hidden Power Water or Ice Fang. Dugtrio can switch in on Thunderbolt, but must be careful, as a well-played Luxray won't just spam Electric-type attacks. Uxie can take a few hits from Crunch and cripple Luxray with paralysis or Toxic status, or set up dual screens and Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Luxray's low Speed allows him to be checked by faster Pokemon with a little bit of prediction. Offensive Venusaur can come in on Thunderbolt or Superpower and dispatch of him with Earthquake. Moltres can take any attack that isn't Thunderbolt or Spark and beat Luxray with Fire Blast. Altaria can set up on any set without Ice Fang and KO Luxray with Earthquake.</p> <p>The defensive set is fairly easy to counter. Venusaur only has to worry about being paralyzed by Discharge, while Chansey and Altaria can pretty much come in for free. Basically, anything that can take weak special attacks and doesn't mind status walks all over him, but must be careful switching in repeatedly with entry hazards up in case Luxray uses Roar.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Luxray's mixed attacking stats, making him a good wallbreaker in UU. Thunderbolt deals with bulky Water-types, while Superpower decimates most special walls and does good damage to Rock- and Steel-types. Crunch damages Uxie and Claydol and OHKOes Rotom and Mismagius. There are many options for the final moveslot. Hidden Power Grass and Hidden Power Water both cover Ground-types, with Donphan and Rhyperior being 2HKOed by a combination of Superpower and Hidden Power. Hidden Power Grass covers Quagsire, while Hidden Power Water allows Luxray to 2HKO Steelix with Superpower followed by Hidden Power Water. Ice Fang hits Venusaur and Altaria on their weaker Defense stat, while dealing hefty damage to Torterra, though you lose the ability to significantly damage most Ground-types. Hidden Power Ice is a final option to maintain coverage on Ground-types while still having decent coverage against Venusaur.</p> <p>Superpower is the best move to open with, as Milotic, Rhyperior, Donphan, and Steelix are all 2HKOed by Superpower followed by the appropriate special move, while special walls expecting Thunderbolt or a weak Spark are 2HKOed or OHKOed. If you discover that your opponent is using a Ghost- or Psychic-type to wall Superpower, choose Crunch (or Thunderbolt for Spiritomb) next time Luxray is in.</p> <p>As a wallbreaker, Luxray faces heavy competition from Blaziken, Nidoking, and Magmortar. As such, if you are using Luxray, make sure you are taking advantage of what sets him apart from other wallbreakers. Blaziken generally has a lot more power than Luxray, with STAB on Superpower, higher Special Attack, and Fire Blast as a special move. Luxray's main advantage over Blaziken is his ability to deal with bulky Water- and Flying-types, who often give Blaziken trouble. In comparison to Nidoking, Luxray's main advantage is that he has much higher attacking stats, which allow him to easily defeat Pokemon such as Clefable. Magmortar boasts more power and better type coverage on the special side, but has significantly less physical power. Luxray also has higher defenses than Blaziken, Nidoking, and Magmortar, especially when considering Intimidate, and lacks the Water-type weakness that the three of them share.</p> <p>The EVs give a nice balance to Luxray's offenses. The Special Attack EVs are enough to always OHKO Slowbro after Stealth Rock damage, while a heavy investment in Attack powers up Superpower as much as possible. The Speed EVs allow Luxray to reach 213, outspeeding every UU wall except for Uxie, who will likely paralyze Luxray with Thunder Wave anyway.</p> <p>When choosing teammates for Luxray, be sure to include a Ground-type immunity or resist. Flying-types and Pokemon with the ability Levitate can range from bulky Pokemon like Claydol and Altaria to offensive threats such as Mismagius and Moltres. Dugtrio can revenge kill Luxray, so have something such as SubPunch Aggron or a Ground-weak Choice Scarf user who can lure Dugtrio. Luxray also works well with Pokemon who appreciate the removal of certain walls. Arcanine and Moltres enjoy having Luxray take out Water-types and Rhyperior, while special sweepers such as Alakazam appreciate having Registeel and Chansey gone.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Luxray has a high Attack stat and excellent type coverage, so a Choice Band set can work well. Electric / Ice and Dark / Fighting are well known two-move coverage combinations, and having both together is one of the main draws of this set. Superpower is your most powerful move here, and it helps that Slowbro and Flying-types are not likely to switch in on Luxray for fear of an Electric-type attack. Spark is better than Thunder Fang for physical STAB, as the 30% paralysis rate can really help Luxray with his low Speed stat.</p> <p>The Speed EVs give Luxray 230 Speed, which is enough to outrun base 95 Pokemon who don't invest in Speed, such as Uxie. Since Luxray isn't going to outspeed many important Pokemon, an Adamant nature is preferable to hit as hard as possible, while a small HP investment helps make use of Intimidate.</p> <p>Like the other sets, Luxray needs teammates who can switch in on Ground-type attacks. Due to the hit-and-run nature of Choice sets, it is recommended that you include immunities and 4x resists, so that revenge killers do not become too much of a liability. This is standard practice for highly offensive teams, which is where Choice Band Luxray is likely to fit in.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Intimidate is a great ability for Luxray, despite his rather average defensive capabilities. A few useful resistances allow him to take quite a few hits before fainting. When factoring in Intimidate, Luxray is capable of surviving Swords Dance-boosted Bug Bite from Scyther and Stone Edge from Kabutops to hit them back with Discharge. Unfortunately, with the removal of Crobat, Honchkrow, and Staraptor from the UU tier, this set has lost some of its relevance. Still, he makes a decent switch against physical Water-types, Scyther, and Swellow, while keeping the useful Electric-type STAB and acting as a status platform.</p> <p>Toxic cripples walls, while Discharge has a chance to cripple fast sweepers with paralysis. Thunder Wave is an option over Toxic if you prefer a more reliable way of spreading paralysis. Thunderbolt is an option over Discharge if you are using Thunder Wave, or if you don't want to accidentally paralyze something that you want to poison with Toxic. It also has more power, but against the aforementioned threats, both are equally good. Luxray's support movepool is lackluster, but Protect works nicely with Toxic and helps recover health, while forcing Swellow to take another turn of poison or burn damage if he tries to use U-turn to escape. Roar is nice on any defensive Pokemon, but has poor synergy with Intimidate.</p> <p>This Luxray set faces competition from Arcanine's defensive set, which works similarly. Arcanine may seem to overshadow Luxray due to the advantages of Morning Sun, Will-O-Wisp, and more powerful attacking choices; however, Luxray's two move coverage, Thunder Wave, and lack of a Stealth Rock weakness allow him to do some things that Arcanine can't. Crucially, Luxray can take on physically based Water-types, while Arcanine cannot.</p> <p>Again, Luxray needs teammates to take Ground-type attacks. Entry hazards support this set well if you're using Roar, so Cloyster, Omastar, and Qwilfish are good considerations to lay down Spikes, while Stealth Rock users are plentiful. Dugtrio doesn't OHKO this set, but Luxray cannot OHKO him either, so having something to lure and deal with Dugtrio is also very helpful. This set counters physical Water- and Flying-types, so Fire-type sweepers like Ninetales, Houndoom, and Moltres, who fear users of Aqua Jet and being revenge killed by Swellow or Scyther, are ideal teammates. While adding more Pokemon to your team who are liable to getting trapped by Dugtrio may seem like a bad idea, equipping Ninetales or Houndoom with a Shuca Berry or using Sucker Punch on Houndoom can give Luxray the Dugtrio lure he needs.</p>"
      },
      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<p>Although Luxray lacks a reliable recovery move such as Recover or Wish, he can utilize the RestTalk combo to recover health and cure status. Luxray's support movepool leaves much to be desired, so he doesn't really mind giving up moveslots for Rest and Sleep Talk. Since Luxray doesn't have room for Toxic or Thunder Wave on this set, Discharge is the primary option for the first move. Roar is useful to prevent threats from setting up on Luxray and works well in conjunction with entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes. Thanks to Rest and Sleep Talk, Luxray will be able to utilize Roar repeatedly, racking up a lot of entry hazard damage. Hidden Power Grass is still an option to 2HKO Rhyperior and Quagsire, but has little use other than that.</p> <p>This set has the potential to function well on a stall team, where its purpose is to cause entry hazard damage with Roar. Once you have eliminated Luxray's counters and any Rapid Spin users, you can pull off a late-game cleanup by utilizing Roar repeatedly, while healing yourself with Rest when necessary. As such, it is recommended that your team be able to use at least two types of entry hazards. Uxie, Claydol, and Torterra deserve a mention because they can set up Stealth Rock and switch in on the Ground-type attacks that Luxray is weak to. Unfortunately, the only UU Spikes user who resists Ground is Cacturne, who is too frail to take more than a couple of resisted hits. However, Cloyster's high Defense lets him take Earthquakes from Donphan and Rhyperior, making him an excellent candidate for an entry hazard-laying teammate. Cloyster is also the only user of Toxic Spikes in UU who isn't either weak to Ground or physically frail.</p>"

  "Rampardos": {
    "overview": "<p>Rampardos is pretty much the definition of the term 'glass cannon'. The good news? He possesses the highest base Attack stat found outside of Ubers, powerful STAB Rock-type attacks, and an awesome movepool with access to useful boosting options. On the other hand, he also has a low Speed stat and shoddy defenses with weaknesses to several common attacking types, making him extremely vulnerable to four of the most common priority moves in UU (Aqua Jet, Bullet Punch, Mach Punch, and Vacuum Wave). It goes without saying, then, that the metagame has not been very kind to Rampardos at all, and he is often shunned in favor of his bulkier competitors, who are not so easily revenge killed. Still, if you're looking for power, and lots of it, then maybe Rampardos is the Pokemon for you.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rampardos has a large special movepool, which grants him some pretty sweet coverage, but since his Attack stat is so disproportionately larger than his Special Attack, it is usually better to just go physical with the exception of Ice Beam (which gets many nifty KOs). Rock Slide can go over Stone Edge on all the sets for a more reliable STAB move, but the loss in power is very noticeable. Thunder Punch is an option for Water-types, but neutral STAB Stone Edge hits them just as hard, making that coverage move rather redundant. Superpower gets even better coverage with Stone Edge than Earthquake, and is also initially more powerful; however, Superpower's side effect lowers Rampardos's only good stat, which is a bit counterproductive in the long run. Brick Break offers the same coverage as Superpower, but it is much weaker with the ability to break through screens; which is situational, at best. Stealth Rock should only be resorted to if nothing else on your team can set it up. Roar can be used to scout out your opponent's counter and throw off their footing. Finally, Crunch can be used to hit Claydol, Uxie, and Slowbro for super effective damage, and is especially helpful to nail Claydol which resists EdgeQuake.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Despite being arguably the most powerful physical attacker in the game, Rampardos still cannot OHKO everything, and that's a problem for something as frail as he is. Bulky Fighting-types can usually take a hit and retaliate with their STAB moves. Defensive Hitmontop, in particular, is able to take even a Swords Dance-boosted Earthquake thanks to Intimidate, and dispatch Rampardos with Close Combat. Offensive variants can also switch in and easily dispose of Rampardos with a swift Mach Punch to the dome. Ground-types, such as Donphan, can usually take a hit, but most of them should be wary of Spikes when facing the Swords Dance variant. Attempting to bypass Rampardos's sheer firepower completely with a super effective priority move (and there a lot of them) is also a fine strategy to have. Finally, without a Speed boost, most offensive Pokemon will be able to outspeed Rampardos and take him out as well.</p>",

Stone Edge is a powerful STAB move coming off Rampardos's base 165 Attack, and Earthquake is used with it to form the excellent \"EdgeQuake\" combo. Thanks to Mold Breaker, Rampardos is able to use Earthquake to hit common Levitators such as Rotom and Weezing super effectively, which is a massive plus in anyone's book. Fire Punch is for Torterra, which walls the rest of the set, while also being a more reliable move to use against defensive Grass-types. Finally, Zen Headbutt is in the last slot as it 2HKOes Hariyama and Hitmontop (without Intimidate).</p> <p>Head Smash is an option over Stone Edge, as its massive Base Power can be most useful in the direst of situations, and as a bonus it has the same shoddy accuracy as Stone Edge. The recoil, on the other hand, is utterly crippling. Ice Beam is not recommended here as it is really, really bad to get locked into a move running off Rampardos's uninvested Special Attack. Pursuit is not listed for the same reason, but it can be useful in trapping weakened foes. A Jolly nature is recommended because it is necessary for Rampardos to outspeed base 105s such as Scyther and Mismagius (he actually outspeeds up to base 110s, but those are practically non-existent in UU), whereas an Adamant nature will only outspeed up to base 95s. Still, the extra power can be useful, but keep in mind that revenge killers generally always want as much Speed as they can get.</p> <p>Due to the fact that Rampardos will be switching in and out fairly often, Rapid Spin support would actually not be a bad idea. Since Rampardos will also be causing a lot of switches (to an offensive team at least), setting up entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field will also be good. Lots of Pokemon are capable of providing either form of support. Blastoise is one Pokemon who can pull off the Foresight + Rapid Spin trick, ensuring a successful Rapid Spin unless the opponent has two Ghost-types, while Torterra's good bulk makes it a reliable Stealth Rock user. A spinblocker of your own, such as Rotom or Mismagius, will also help keep those hazards where they should be. Rampardos is stopped cold by two main Pokemon, Tangrowth (even with Fire Punch) and Donphan. Because of this, Houndoom and Milotic make incredible offensive partners to use alongside Rampardos, the former being able to fry Tangrowth and the latter being able to swamp Donphan.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<p>Rampardos's massive Attack will certainly cause many switches, and he can take advantage of this with Substitute. Substitute will not only give the frail Rampardos what is effectively a second life, but also ease prediction greatly and block status. Stone Edge is a powerful STAB attack, and Head Smash even more so, and is able to outright OHKO even Physically Defensive Milotic with Life Orb. Unfortunately, the combination of Life Orb, Head Smash, and Substitute means that Rampardos is going to be losing health insanely fast, even if he isn't being attacked. Leftovers can remedy this somewhat, but not by much, given the damage output of Head Smash. Earthquake is the usual coverage move that hits almost every other Pokemon, while the final move takes care of the pesky Torterra.</p> <p>The EVs are self-explanatory for a Substitute set; maximum Speed caps out the number of Pokemon that Rampardos will be able to set up on, and maximum Attack makes sure that the set-up is worth it. Focus Punch can be used here in conjunction with Substitute, being much more powerful than Earthquake and giving extremely similar coverage, but it will leave Rampardos with no good \"safe\" attack. Since this set will usually be forcing a lot of switches, entry hazards are easily worth their weight in gold with Substitute Rampardos on your team. Spikes in particular are a good option, especially considering that most of Rampardos's typical switch-ins are Ground-types. You'll also want Pokemon that will help lure out the things Rampardos can set up on, specifically Pokemon that'll switch out in fear of one of his moves. Paralysis support will also be useful in helping Rampardos set up on Pokemon that usually outspeed him, such as Ambipom and Sceptile. Finally, Wish users can help compensate for the immense residual damage that Rampardos will be taking; Leafeon is a good example of such a Pokemon.</p>"
      },
      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<p>Rock Polish Rampardos throws the idea of revenge killing out the window, and goes in for a more direct late-game sweep. With a Rock Polish under his belt, Rampardos reaches 430 Speed, which outspeeds every unboosted Pokemon in UU, and then some. Combine this with his Life Orb-boosted base 165 Attack stat, and Rampardos becomes more than capable of sweeping through unprepared teams. Stone Edge is the STAB move of choice, packing astonishing power, while Earthquake is here to hit what Stone Edge doesn't for at least neutral damage (bar Shedinja). In the last slot, Rampardos has two equally promising options to nail Torterra with in Fire Punch and Ice Beam. While the first comes off Rampardos's insane Attack stat, Ice Beam is also surprisingly useful because it 2HKOes many problem Pokemon that will usually wall Rampardos, namely Donphan and Tangrowth, as well as OHKOing offensive Torterra. If you decide to run Ice Beam, a Naughty nature is preferred, so as not to lower Rampardos's Special Attack.</p> <p>Lum Berry is an option over Life Orb to stop a one-time status attempt from ruining Rampardos's sweep, and it also allows him to set up on status-carrying support Pokemon such as Chansey and Registeel. It is worth noting, however, that without Life Orb's power boost, Ice Beam will miss out on many of its intended KOs, and thus become a far less appealing option. In general, the lack of power will also make Rampardos that much easier to wall. Zen Headbutt can be used in the final slot, but once again thanks to Life Orb, Rampardos doesn't need it to OHKO frailer Fighting-types.</p> <p>Since Rampardos is trying to sweep, entry hazard support is much more appreciated here than anywhere else. Cloyster and Qwilfish are both able to set up Spikes, and are both solid options for the lead position. Dual screens from teammates, such as Uxie and Claydol, will be helpful for cushioning the blow from attacks while Rampardos sets up, and will also shelter Rampardos from priority moves while he sweeps. A brewing sandstorm will boost Rampardos's Special Defense, and make it easier for him to set up as well. Unfortunately, only Hippopotas can provide this kind of support in UU. Certain Choice Scarf users, such as Primeape, who are still faster than Rampardos even after he has set up, can also put a sudden halt to his fun. Running a Choice Scarf Moltres of your own is a good idea, as it can deal with such nuisances with its STAB Air Slash. Finally, a bulky Water-type, such as Milotic or Slowbro, to take the priority moves that Rampardos attracts would be good.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Despite all of Rampardos's raw power, he still has trouble busting through some of the bulkier Pokemon in UU. While the Rock Polish set aims for a clean sweep, this set plays like a wallbreaker; essentially, anything slower than a +2 Attack Rampardos is pretty much mincemeat. EdgeQuake forms the core of Rampardos's moveset once again, and in the last slot, the choice comes down to whether you want Rampardos to hit Grass- or Fighting-types harder.</p> <p>Life Orb gives Rampardos the largest immediate boost in power without locking it into a single move, making it the item of choice. Since all Pokemon slower than Rampardos after his set-up is essentially dead, maximum Speed with a boosting nature is the way to go. Attack is maximized for obvious reasons and the remainder go into bulk.</p> <p>Paralysis support would be ideal, and there are many options to provide it. Venusaur is an interesting choice, as it can pull off a double status set with both Sleep Powder and Stun Spore surprisingly well. Slowbro and Uxie are other fantastic Pokemon to spread paralysis round the other team. Uxie can easily switch into the Ground-type attacks aimed at Rampardos, while Slowbro can take any Fighting-, Water-, and Steel-type attacks. Of course, entry hazard support from teammates such as Omastar and Cloyster is always welcome to help Rampardos secure KOs on bulkier Pokemon, while sandstorm or dual screen support will help him immensely when attempting to set up.</p>"

      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Rampardos packs a preposterous amount of power and sports a low Speed stat, making him an ideal candidate for a Trick Room sweeper. Head Smash is the perfect STAB attack here; since Rampardos doesn't have to set up anything, he can handle the recoil, and appreciates the massive boost in power to make the most of Trick Room's short timer. Earthquake is here again as that good ol' reliable coverage move. But note that a resisted STAB Head Smash is still more powerful than a neutral Earthquake, which is useful to know should you require the extra kick. Substitute is incredibly useful because opponents will often try to stall out Trick Room's timer with creative switching and hit Rampardos when he's down; with a Substitute up, Rampardos can take advantage of said switches and stay threatening even after Trick Room has ended. Finally, Fire Punch and Ice Beam can be used to hit Torterra, who would otherwise wall the moveset.</p> <p>Since this set is meant to function on a Trick Room, Speed is obviously minimized. The EVs are instead shifted into HP to cushion Head Smash's recoil a little. Attack is maximized as Rampardos wants to hit as hard as possible, and the remainder can go into either a defensive stat or Special Attack, depending on whether or not you opt for Ice Beam. Life Orb is recommended for the power boost it gives, which can be crucial in securing a KO. Even with Life Orb and Head Smash recoil, in addition to the occasional Substitute, he will usually still be able to survive for the entire duration of Trick Room. However, if you wish to preserve Rampardos, and keep him around for a second round of carnage, then Leftovers is an option.</p> <p>Slowbro, Slowking, and Uxie are tried-and-true reliable Trick Room users that always manage to find their way onto Trick Room teams thanks in no small part to the their valuable resistances to many common Trick Room Pokemon weaknesses. Rampardos is no exception, and it appreciates being able to fall back on Slowbro / Slowking for Fighting- and Water-type attacks, or Uxie for Fighting- and Ground-type attacks. Uxie can also set up the ever-useful entry hazard that is Stealth Rock.</p>"

  "Bastiodon": {
    "overview": "<p>Bastiodon, although possessing gargantuan defenses and access to many useful support moves including Stealth Rock, Toxic, and Taunt, has always been overlooked for a position on UU teams due to its lackluster offenses. Thanks to moves such as Metal Burst and Torment, however, Bastiodon can present a serious threat while simultaneously contributing to the team. It's not a very reliable option considering its grave 4x weaknesses to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks and low Speed, but it can hold its own given the proper support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Outside of the mentioned sets, Bastiodon doesn't have many other options to choose from. Metal Sound, Curse, and Rest can be utilized, but their viability is limited. Also, an all-out attacking set revolving around Curse, Metal Sound, and two attacking moves can be used, but due to Bastiodon's mediocre base 52 Attack stat and lack of a reliable recovery move, it is not recommended. For any of Bastiodon's sets, an EV spread of 252 HP / 68 Atk / 192 SpD can be used if you're intent on being able to break the Substitutes of Nasty Plot Mismagius and Sub-Charge Rotom.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Even with Bastiodon's immense defenses, Fighting-types like Hitmontop and Hariyama can cleanly 2HKO--in some cases even OHKO--Bastiodon after it has taken some residual damage. Similar to the aforementioned Fighting-types, bulky Ground-types also cause problems for Bastiodon with their super effective STAB attacks and immunity to sandstorm, a factor Bastiodon relies on to slowly wear down bulky foes. It should be noted, however, that when sending in a counter to face Bastiodon, you must beware of the possibility that Bastiodon may survive the attack and strike back with Metal Burst. Finally, any user of Taunt will be able to defeat the sets that lack an attacking move.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>With its amazing base defenses and access to an array of supporting moves, it seems as though Bastiodon was designed to play the role of a supporting Pokemon on a UU team. Not only can the prehistoric Pokemon set up the always-valuable Stealth Rock, it can also provide stall or balanced teams with Toxic support, maximizing the effectiveness of the team's strategy, as well as being an efficient phazer.</p> <p>Rest is an alternative to Stealth Rock which can be used in conjunction with sandstorm support, making Bastiodon quite durable. Taunt is another valuable asset, as it prevents many bulky foes, like Miltank, from simply healing off Toxic damage, as well as stopping common foes, most notably Venusaur, from putting Bastiodon to sleep and setting up. Roar can be used to slowly chip away at an opponent's health with residual damage when entry hazards are up; it is also useful if you find yourself facing an opponent who has already set up. The final moveslot will hold Bastiodon's only attacking move and the decision of which one to use is based upon your preference; both Iron Head and Stone Edge are great STAB attacks, but since the latter is not very accurate, Rock Slide can be used instead of for better accuracy in exchange for less Base Power.</p> <p>Leftovers and an Impish nature are used in tandem to increase Bastiodon's overall bulk and longevity in the battle as it will often be switching in repeatedly to check certain Pokemon. The EVs are used for a similar function as the nature: to increase Bastiodon's bulk while focusing on its special durability, as its physical defense is already very impressive. It should be noted, however, that you can alter the EVs to make Bastiodon slightly more offensive, as it may need the extra Attack investment due to its mediocre base 52 Attack stat.</p>"
      },
      "Torment": {
        "description": "<p>With excellent bulk, Bastiodon's massive base defenses, and access to moves such as Protect and Roar, Bastiodon can be turned into a fierce Torment user when given the proper support. The strategy of this set is simple; Torment an opponent to block their STAB or super effective move, follow up with a cycle of the other moves mentioned in the set, repeat until the foe's HP bar reaches 0%.</p> <p>The decision between using Substitute or Toxic comes down to your personal preference. Although Substitute can act as a reliable barrier when one foe has fainted and another switches in, Toxic makes the entire Torment stall process faster by increasing residual damage. Protect is a staple on the set as it allows Bastiodon to regain health every turn through Leftovers while also being able to stack up more and more residual damage on the opposing Pokemon. The last move slot is given to Roar, which can be effectively used alongside entry hazards or simply for phazing; Toxic can also be fitted into this slot if you prefer its stalling capabilities over Roar's phazing ones.</p> <p>The nature and EVs have been chosen to make Bastiodon as bulky as possible on both the physical and the special side, while also retaining a huge amount of HP. The EV spread and nature are malleable, allowing you to make Bastiodon more physically bulky if you so desire. Also, it should be noted that any user of Taunt will completely shut down this Bastiodon set as it relies solely on defeating enemies through the use of indirect damage.</p>"
      },
      "Metal Burst": {
        "description": "<p>Aside from Aggron and Dialga, Bastiodon is the only Pokemon who can learn the fearsome move Metal Burst, which is the equivalent of Mirror Coat and Counter except for both physical and special attacks. Bastiodon's natural defenses and awful Speed make it ideal for utilizing Metal Burst to take out opposing threats.</p> <p>Taunt and Metal Burst are staples on the set as their combination forces the opposition to attack, which means Bastiodon can use Metal Burst to inflict 1.5x the damage caused by the incoming attack. Stealth Rock is mainly mentioned for support purposes. If you feel like Stealth Rock is unnecessary, an attacking move can be used instead. Since this set focuses primarily on the combination of Taunt and Metal Burst, it is very susceptible to users of Taunt. For this reason, the final moveslot is best filled by a move that causes direct damage. Earthquake can be a valuable asset as it hits many common threats in UU for super effective damage, while Stone Edge is also viable as it is boosted by STAB and hits Flying-types. Iron Head is another option, but compared to the two aforementioned moves, it is not recommended due to the low Base Power, even after STAB.</p> <p>Leftovers along with a Sassy nature help increase Bastiodon's durability, allowing it to survive a wider array of attacks from more Pokemon and retaliate with Metal Burst, although it can use Focus Sash to defeat foes like Choice Band Hariyama and offensive Hitmontop who otherwise beat Bastiodon. The EVs are designed to maximize Bastiodon's bulk and make it more specially defensive, as it will need the extra EV investment when facing foes like Milotic and Houndoom. 0 Speed IVs and the Speed-reducing nature ensure that the opponent always gets to attack first, before Bastiodon uses Metal Burst.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Mothim is another forgotten Bug / Flying-type Pokemon, and for a good reason: he has a crippling 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, making him almost unviable on a competitive team. This, coupled with his paper-thin defenses and several common weaknesses, means that Mothim won't stay alive for very long. He is also slow and easy to revenge kill. It can also be said that Mothim is outclassed by Venomoth, who is faster, takes less damage from Stealth Rock, has access to Sleep Powder, and has a better ability in Tinted Lens. It isn't all bad news for Mothim, however, as he has above-average attacking stats and a good movepool, with moves such as Bug Buzz, Air Slash, and U-turn; additionally, while Mothim is slow, his Speed is decent enough to run an effective Choice Scarf set.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mothim has a few more viable options. A Substitute set aiming to activate Swarm and a pinch Berry can be used, but it is unreliable due to the prevalence of priority in UU. Energy Ball is Mothim's best bet against most bulky Waters such as Lanturn and Milotic, and can OHKO Quagsire, Omastar, Kabutops, and Gastrodon, but the options listed in the set above provide better coverage. Psychic is another option, but it doesn't have impressive coverage in conjunction with Mothim's other attacks; it hits Nidoking and Weezing super effectively, but doesn't have much use outside of that. Mothim can run a physical set, but his physical movepool is limited to Bug Bite, U-turn, Aerial Ace, and Return. Roost can also be used, but with Mothim's pitiful defenses, it's not recommended. Toxic allows Mothim to cripple walls, but he needs all of the type coverage he can get.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Mothim will usually be carrying a Choice item, so good prediction is important to defeat him. Aggron can switch into anything bar Hidden Power Ground; Rock-types such as Rhyperior can switch in on Mothim and set up Rock Polish, but they should be wary of the potential Energy Ball. Rotom can switch in on Mothim with ease, but it must be careful to avoid Shadow Ball, and OHKO him with STAB Thunderbolt. Chansey, Clefable, Regice, Registeel, and Milotic wall Mothim's attacks easily, and most of them can OHKO or 2HKO him back (though Regice and Milotic won't enjoy a potential Toxic). Due to Mothim's poor Speed, strong Choice Scarf users can dispose of him easily, while fast sweepers can also outspeed and KO Mothim if he isn't running Choice Scarf. Mothim's lack of offensive power and bad defenses mean that specially-bulky Pokemon will be able to wall him throughout the entire match. Priority is also problematic for Mothim due to his bad defenses. Finally, Stealth Rock makes Mothim much easier to KO, stripping away half his health upon switching in.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Mothim's decent Special Attack and, to a lesser extent, his usable Attack stat. Bug Buzz is a very nice STAB move that hit Psychic- and Grass-types such as Slowbro, Uxie, and Leafeon quite hard. Air Slash is Mothim's secondary STAB move, hitting Bug- and Fighting-types for heavy damage. Hidden Power Ground is necessary, as Mothim would otherwise be walled by Registeel and other Steel-types. The last move comes down to personal preference; U-turn is great for scouting, while Shadow Ball is Mothim's best bet against Ghost-types, especially offensive Rotom, who is always OHKOed by Specs Mothim provided that Mothim hits him on the switch, as otherwise Rotom outspeeds and OHKOes Mothim with STAB Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Timid is the preferred nature, as with the boost from Choice Scarf, Mothim can outspeed Choice Scarf Absol, Sceptile, Alakazam, and Espeon. With Choice Specs, Mothim is still capable of outrunning Absol, Ludicolo, and Poliwrath. Modest is also viable, as it gives Mothim more power. A Naive or a Rash nature can be used to make U-turn stronger. The EV spread maximizes Mothim's Special Attack and Speed, while 4 Special Defense EVs give Mothim 281 HP, which allows him to switch in twice if Stealth Rock is in play. It also forces Porygon2's Download ability to boost his Attack instead of his Special Attack, making him a less powerful threat. Both Choice items are effective; Choice Specs make Mothim a potent Pokemon capable of breaking through some walls, while Choice Scarf allows him to act as a good revenge killer. Life Orb is viable, but Mothim really needs the boost that both Choice items provide.</p> <p>Rapid Spin support is mandatory to keep Mothim alive. Donphan and Claydol can come in on Rock-type attacks directed at Mothim and use Rapid Spin, clearing the field of any dangerous entry hazards. In addition, Donphan can beat Steel-types that wall Mothim with his powerful STAB Earthquake. Hitmontop is also a very reliable Rapid Spinner thanks to Foresight. Wish support from Pokemon such as Clefable and Chansey is helpful, enabling Mothim to survive much longer in the match.</p> <p>Lanturn is a great teammate for Mothim, as he can defeat bulky Water-types like Milotic, and his typing and ability will cause problems for Rotom. Mothim can switch into Ground- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Lanturn, while Lanturn can switch into Fire-, Electric-, and Ice-type attacks directed at the moth. Dugtrio is also an excellent partner because he can trap and KO Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon who would otherwise trouble Mothim. Special walls such as Clefable and Chansey completely wall Mothim; for this reason, a strong Fighting-type Pokemon is recommended. Hitmonlee is especially good thanks to his immunity to paralysis, while Blaziken can surprise the opponent with a mixed set, tearing through almost any wall who stands in his way.</p>"

  "Vespiquen": {
    "overview": "<p>Boasting three signature moves and two base stats over 100, Vespiquen stands out among the herd of forgettable flying bugs in UU. With Pressure, Roost, and more bulk than Spiritomb, Vespiquen would seem to be a solid defensive Pokemon. Unfortunately, Bug / Flying is a terrible defensive typing with a crippling 4x Rock weakness, and Vespiquen's low Speed makes it easy for opponents to take advantage of this. Furthermore, she must compete directly for a team slot with Articuno and Moltres, both of whom have similar bulk and much higher Speed.</p> <p>Despite these flaws, Vespiquen can still be a successful counter to some powerful UU threats. Her signature move, Attack Order, is a great STAB attack that hits several common frail sweepers hard. Furthermore, her resistances to Ground, Fighting, Bug, and Grass give her many opportunities to safely switch in and start stalling.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Vespiquen's defensive stats are equal, so a physically-defensive set is possible, but it is generally less effective. The vast majority of physical attackers carry a powerful super effective Rock-, Ice-, Flying-, or Fire-type move that would prevent Vespiquen from switching in unless the opponent was locked into a resisted move. The specially-defensive set can survive nearly any resisted physical attack anyway, and allows Vespiquen to switch in on non-Choiced special attackers such as Alakazam, making it a vastly superior option.</p> <p>Defend Order raises both of Vespiquen's defensive stats, making her Substitutes difficult to break without a super effective move and thus greatly increasing her stalling potential. It is difficult to find a moveslot for it or the time to use it during battle, though. Heal Order is a nice instant recovery move, but Vespiquen has access to Roost, which is exactly the same except it handily removes Vespiquen's nasty Flying-type weaknesses when facing slower foes like Quagsire and Steelix. Destiny Bond is difficult to use with Vespiquen's low Speed, but it lets you play some mindgames with your opponent and can possibly get a surprise KO on a Pokemon like Steelix.</p> <p>If you're looking for alternate attacking moves, Aerial Ace and Hidden Power Flying get a STAB boost and make Vespiquen an even better check against Choiced Fighting-types. Vespiquen can use Signal Beam instead of Attack Order if she's running a Hidden Power, as that allows her to switch to a Calm nature, increasing the strength of Hidden Power, but Attack Order is more powerful and many of Vespiquen's targets are frailer on the physical side. X-Scissor and U-turn are other good physical STAB moves, but U-turn's switching effect doesn't really mesh with what Vespiquen is trying to accomplish, and X-Scissor is simply outclassed by Attack Order. Outside of her STAB attacks and Hidden Power, Vespiquen's attacking movepool is truly abysmal, so don't even think about trying an offensive set with her unless you enjoy using Sludge Bomb or Return as \"coverage\" moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Stealth Rock is a nightmare for Vespiquen, stripping off half of her HP every time she switches in. With her low Speed, she is unlikely to get the chance to recover that damage off with Roost before being KOed. If Stealth Rock is on the field, Vespiquen won't be walling anything except Choiced attackers locked into a 4x resisted move.</p> <p>Hazardous stones aside, anything immune to Toxic and not weak to Attack Order generally has little to fear from Vespiquen. Unless she is packing Hidden Power Ground, Aggron, Drapion, and Toxicroak can all switch in and set up for free as Vespiquen is forced to switch out. Hariyama and Swellow both resist Attack Order and love switching into Toxic to activate Guts. In general, the simplest way to defeat Vespiquen is to take advantage of her low Speed. Hit her with Toxic before she gets a Substitute up, and she is instantly turned into dead weight. Stone Edge and other powerful super effective physical attacks have the same effect, only much more direct.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Bee": {
        "description": "<p>This set is the best way to take advantage of Vespiquen's above-average bulk, Pressure ability, and reliable recovery. Vespiquen can switch in on a resisted Choice attack such as Earthquake, Close Combat, or Leaf Storm, forcing the opponent to switch out and giving Vespiquen the opportunity to set up a Substitute. Behind a Substitute, Vespiquen is protected from status and super effective attacks such as Stone Edge and Fire Blast, which she is able to stall out of PP by repeatedly using Substitute to abuse Pressure. If the opposing Pokemon lacks such dangerous moves, Vespiquen can hit it with Toxic and proceed to stall it out with Substitute and Roost. Slow, bulky Water-types that Vespiquen outspeeds, such as Slowbro and Quagsire, are easily defeated with this strategy if they lack Rest. Finally, Vespiquen can use her signature move, Attack Order, to counter certain frail special sweepers. Life Orb Alakazam and Choice Specs Sceptile are both OHKOed, and neither one can 2HKO Vespiquen with any of their standard attacks.</p> <p>The given EVs maximize Vespiquen's special bulk, allowing her to repeatedly switch in on special attackers who lack powerful super effective moves. HP is not maximized to prevent Vespiquen from fainting on the second switch into Stealth Rock, although Rapid Spin support is highly recommended when using Vespiquen as it will make keeping her healthy significantly easier. The remaining EVs are placed in Defense to slightly reduce the damage taken from resisted physical attacks Vespiquen may switch into.</p> <p>Poison- and Steel-types are immune to Toxic and resist Attack Order, meaning they can just about switch into this set for free. Aggron, Toxicroak, and Drapion will all gladly come in on any move and set up while Vespiquen is forced to switch out. To discourage this, Vespiquen could run Hidden Power Ground over one of her other moves. Even with a hindering nature and no EV investment, Aggron will be easily 2HKOed and Toxicroak and Drapion are both 3HKOed, which is enough to limit a sweep and prevent further set-up if Vespiquen hits them as they switch in.</p> <p>An easier solution is to provide Vespiquen with a Ground-type teammate who can smash Poison- and Steel-types with STAB Earthquake. Donphan can check Aggron, Toxicroak, and Drapion very well, and also provides Rapid Spin support to prevent Vespiquen from losing half of her HP each time she switches in. Vespiquen and Donphan also have good defensive synergy, as Donphan can tank Flare Blitz and Stone Edge all day, while Vespiquen can easily switch in on Leaf Storm aimed at Donphan. Hitmontop is another reliable spinning partner for Vespiquen. He resists Rock, has solid physical defense alongside Intimidate, and can hit Steel-types hard with Close Combat. He also appreciates Vespiquen's ability to take on Psychic-types such as Alakazam and Slowbro.</p> <p>Though not a necessity, having Toxic Spikes support would allow Vespiquen to drop Toxic from her moveset, making room for another move such as Hidden Power Ground or Defend Order. Nidoqueen and Drapion are both solid choices to provide this, but Nidoqueen has the bonus of being able to hit many of Vespiquen's counters hard with Earth Power or Ice Beam. For offensive teams, Vespiquen's biggest contribution will be eliminating Slowbro or Quagsire, so Pokemon who appreciate their removal are good partners. Kabutops and Blaziken can easily power through a team once the opposing bulky Water is defeated, making them both excellent partners.</p>"

  "Pachirisu": {
    "overview": "<p>Sadly, Pachirisu is one of the poorer Pokemon in the game and stat-wise it's not very good at all. The combination of high Speed and Special Defense isn't very helpful; though it can help score a quick status-move (or Super Fang) on walls. The only reasons to use Pachirisu are to counter other Electric-types in the lower tiers, and utilize Super Fang to heavily weaken enemies for your other sweepers to pick off. You can't do a great deal back to the likes of Plusle and Minun, but if you can paralyze them or dig into their HP with Super Fang, they'll become almost useless. Another letdown is that both of Pachirisu's abilities are completely useless in battle.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Pachirisu does have some decent moves, but sadly doesn't have the stats to use the majority of them. Thunderbolt is an option as always on Electric-types, but Discharge is preferred as the paralysis chance is worth it; you won't be doing a great deal more with Thunderbolt. As already mentioned, various Hidden Powers (mainly Grass, Water, and Ice) and Grass Knot are usable, but with 45 base Special Attack they're just not hitting hard enough. However, you could attempt to pair these moves with Fake Tears to drop your opponents Special Defense as Pachirisu doesn't really have a means of increasing its Special Attack (bar Charge Beam and Choice Specs). The only other move worthy of mention is Charm, which can be used to weaken incoming physical attackers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Almost anything can counter Pachirisu really, since its offensive stats are abysmal. Even the majority of Water-types can survive Pachirisu's STAB attack, that's how bad it is. However, remember that if you're switching into Pachirisu, you'll be more than likely to take around 50% damage straight away. Whiscash and Quagsire can be good counters, since they are immune to Electric attacks and can destroy Pachirisu with Earthquake. They should be able to shrug off a Grass Knot too thanks to their rather low weight. Muk is slow so won't mind being paralyzed, and it's immune to Toxic. Basically, any fast physical attacker that avoids being paralyzed will deal with Pachirisu, and any bulky Pokemon with physical attacks that doesn't mind being paralyzed will also put a stop to it (it shouldn't mind getting a Super Fang either).</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Pachirisu wasn't blessed with great stats, or a brilliant movepool, so this is probably the best use you're likely to get from it. As you're most likely aware, Pachirisu just doesn't have what it takes to use offensive moves all that well. So, we're forced to use a support set in hope of benefiting your team in some way. Pachirisu has a good Speed stat, but it's not very useful for this set (besides a fast screen set-up, Super Fang, or status).</p> <p>Light Screen is a great support move and will allow Pachirisu to take a few more hits from special attacks, giving you a better chance to be free to status a threat. Speaking of status moves, Pachirisu's best options are Toxic and Thunder Wave. Thunder Wave will help slow down sweepers, while Toxic can weaken troublesome walls. If you'd prefer to set up Light Screen and then scout for your opponents counters, you can use U-turn instead for light damage, information, and possibly a free switch. Generally, you'll want to rip into most walls with Super Fang as soon as possible, weakening them for your sweepers later on in the game. Being able to take a Pokemon down to 50% health in a single turn is one of the main reasons to use Pachirisu. Discharge is preferred over Thunderbolt, as Pachirisu won't be doing much damage, the 30% paralysis chance from Discharge can be very beneficial; especially since you won't really need to use Thunder Wave anymore (meaning you can use the brilliant combo of Super Fang and Toxic to defeat walls). Grass Knot (or Hidden Power Grass, Water, or Ice) can be used instead of your Electric attack or over either attack in slot 4. These are useful if you want Pachirisu to be able to take Ground-types down to 50% health instantly (with Super Fang) and hope to KO with a super effective attack instead of relying on Toxic.</p>"

  "Floatzel": {
    "overview": "<p>Floatzel can be a deadly Pokemon, especially when used correctly. Being the fastest Pokemon to get Swift Swim is quite an accomplishment, and Floatzel doesn't lack in the movepool department either. It even has a solid Special Attack stat to take advantage of Surf and Ice Beam. Being one of the few reliable Pokemon who can Baton Pass Bulk Up is something to also brag about, and Floatzel isn't afraid to show it either.</p> <p>Sweeping with Floatzel needs some leeway though. It has problems, but many other Pokemon do as well. Aside from the usual bulky Water-types, Tangrowth is a problem for Floatzel, despite having Ice Punch at its disposal. Floatzel's mediocre defensive stats don't give Floatzel a lot of opportunities to switch into direct attacks either. If you can bypass these shortcomings, Floatzel is a powerful threat late-game with the rain boosting its Speed as well as Waterfall.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aqua Tail is another STAB option that has a higher Base Power than Waterfall. Waterfall outclasses Aqua Tail though, as Waterfall has the nifty 20% chance of a flinch occurring as well as 100% accuracy. Aqua Jet is a priority move that Floatzel has access to; however, Floatzel is usually fast enough that it is almost redundant to use it. Focus Punch can be used alongside Substitute, Waterfall, and Crunch. Speaking of Substitute, Liechi Berry and Substitute make a good set thanks to Floatzel's high Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky Water-types are the best counters to Floatzel. Milotic can easily Recover the damage and retaliate with Hidden Power Grass or repeated Surfs. Quagsire can do very well against Floatzel as long as Floatzel doesn't have Hidden Power Grass or Bulk Up. Lapras with Thunderbolt is a great counter, taking most attacks easily and hitting back hard. Slowbro can also do well, and has many ways to deal with Floatzel; Thunder Wave, Psychic, and Grass Knot are the main ones. Toxicroak also causes most sets problems with Sucker Punch priority and a Water immunity.</p> <p>Tangrowth has high Defense and access to the powders to cripple Floatzel. Against non-Rain Dance versions, Sceptile will be faster while being able to take out Floatzel with Leaf Storm. Electrode is also faster than the non-Rain Dance versions, and can hit Floatzel hard with Thunderbolt.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Floatzel is a fast Water-type Pokemon who can cause quite a bit of destruction in the rain. The rain acts similar to an Agility and a Howl (for Waterfall that is) boost, which is why little Speed investment is necessary. After the rain is set up, it's time for Floatzel to wreak havoc upon its opponents. Waterfall will be the main attack for Floatzel and hits incredibly hard in the rain. Ice Punch adds coverage while stopping Grass-types from absorbing the boosted Waterfall, as well as hitting Altaria hard. Return is your best weapon against opposing Water-types and complements Waterfall for nearly perfect coverage. It's also your strongest attack against Toxicroak, who will often come in to absorb Waterfall. Rain Dance is in the last slot as you can never have too many Rain Dance users on a Rain Dance team.</p> <p>Although Floatzel may seem outclassed by both Qwilfish and Kabutops due to their access to Swords Dance and moves with higher Base Power, Floatzel's higher Speed makes it a lot harder to revenge kill, and it can still deal some damage without the rain. Also, Floatzel can afford to invest less EVs in Speed and instead invest in HP to take hits better, whereas Qwilfish and Kabutops need all the Speed they can get. Floatzel has access to Ice Punch which gives it an easier time against Altaria, unlike Qwilfish, who has to rely on Poison Jab. Kabutops may have Stone Edge to take Altaria out, but its shaky accuracy can let it down at times.</p> <p>Life Orb is the best option for this set. Floatzel's rather lackluster Attack and low Base Power moves make Life Orb appealing, and without it Floatzel will have a much harder time against the bulkier physical walls such as Venusaur, Drapion, and Uxie. Damp Rock is a possible alternative though as it means you get more Rain Dance turns to abuse; however, the extra power of Life Orb is generally preferred. Max Attack is needed for Floatzel to hit as hard as possible, especially considering its lackluster Attack—it needs all the power it can get. 16 Speed EVs are best for our flotation sac friend. This gives 270 Speed before a Rain Dance, just enough to outpace Adamant Toxicroak. After the rain is present, Floatzel has enough Speed to outrun every common Choice Scarf user in UU. The HP EVs give Floatzel a little durability and offers less recoil from Life Orb. The rest of the EVs are allocated into Defense.</p> <p>This Floatzel should only be used on a Rain Dance team, and therefore Rain Dance support is required. Even though Floatzel may have Rain Dance, it can't rely on itself to always set it up. Claydol, Lanturn, and Rotom are all effective partners to Floatzel, taking the Electric-type moves it hates with ease, while setting up Rain Dance and also Stealth Rock in the case of Claydol. Lanturn can also do well against those annoying bulky Water-types. Altaria, Muk, and Registeel are great partners to take the Grass-type moves Floatzel hates while setting up Rain Dance to support Floatzel. Muk can also absorb the Toxic Spikes which hamper Floatzel, while Registeel can set up Stealth Rock and Altaria can cure Floatzel of status through Heal Bell.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types are the number one counters to Floatzel, and your team needs some way to deal with them. Ludicolo is an amazing partner, dealing with Milotic, Slowbro, and Quagsire with ease, and with Ice Beam, it can hit Tangrowth, whose high Defense means it can take Ice Punch from Floatzel easily. Omastar and Gorebyss are good partners as they can deal with many of the physically defensive Pokemon who Floatzel hates, such as Tangrowth and Quagsire. They also have Earth Power and Psychic, respectively, to take out Toxicroak who is immune to Water-type attacks due to Dry Skin. Registeel and Uxie can take a few attacks while being able to cripple Floatzel with Thunder Wave, but Lanturn can do well against Registeel who lack Earthquake. Omastar and Gorebyss with Hydro Pump have a very high chance to OHKO the standard 252 HP / 4 SpD Relaxed Uxie with the aid of Stealth Rock, and so can make nice partners to Floatzel.</p>"
      },
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>Floatzel lacks Swords Dance; however, having Bulk Up still gives Floatzel the Attack boost that it needs. After using Bulk Up, Floatzel will obtain 417 Attack and 237 Defense. Once Floatzel has used Bulk Up once or twice, it should follow up by attacking. Waterfall provides reliable STAB, dealing significant damage to the many Fire-, Rock-, and Ground-types in the UU metagame. Ice Punch picks off Grass-types, as well as hitting Altaria hard. Return pairs well with Waterfall and offers good coverage while hitting the many bulky Water-types who resist the Water + Ice combination. Brick Break and Crunch are the main other options for this set. Crunch will hit Ghost- and Psychic-types harder than any move, which is especially important for Slowbro who resists Water-type moves. Brick Break, however, hits Lapras hard, since Lapras resists Water- and Ice-type moves. Brick Break also hits most Steel-, Dark-, and Normal-types harder than any other move. Aqua Jet is a minor option but does allow you to hit priority users before they hit you, as well as hitting faster Choice Scarf users, like Dugtrio and Swellow.</p> <p>Life Orb makes Floatzel more like a kamikaze weasel. It gives Floatzel the necessary boost to its acceptable Attack stat. Leftovers is a fine option if you feel that Floatzel can survive a couple of hits after using Bulk Up or if sandstorm and hail are a concern. Jolly nature with the Speed EVs outpace Timid Mismagius and Jolly Scyther. Max Attack is used to make Floatzel hits as hard as possible, while the HP EVs give Floatzel 319 HP, a Life Orb number. The leftover EVs are placed in Defense since Floatzel is using Bulk Up. You can use an Adamant nature should you prefer more power, but generally the extra Speed is more beneficial.</p> <p>Rain Support can be used with this set from the likes of Lanturn, Registeel, and others, but it's generally better to stick to just pure attacking in the rain. Bulky Water-types utilizing special moves give this set problems as they can take Floatzel's hits well provided it doesn't have too many boosts, while hitting its unboosted Special Defense stat. Milotic, Slowbro, and Lapras are among the best counters. Milotic has Hidden Power Grass to badly hurt Floatzel, while Lapras has Thunderbolt and Slowbro can hit the weasel with Psychic or Grass Knot. They all have the defenses to take a few hits as well. Grass-types can do well against the aforementioned Pokemon as their powerful Grass-type moves will scare them off. Venusaur is one of the best as it has high Special Defense to take Ice Beams and Psychics. Ludicolo is one of the best possible partners; with its high Special Defense, 4x resistance to Surf, and only being hit neutrally by Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Grass, and Psychic, it can scare them off whether it be through the SubSeed tactic or just its powerful Grass-type moves. Powerful Electric-types such as Rotom are other good partners; although they often have trouble switching in, once they are in they can scare those bulky Water-types off with a powerful STAB Thunderbolt. Lanturn is probably the best Electric-type to counter the aforementioned Pokemon as its high Special Defense lets it take even super effective special attacks with relative ease, while its STAB Thunderbolt will send them running. Calm Minders such as Espeon and Mismagius can set up against these bulky Water-types while Mismagius has Substitute to block status, and Espeon's ability Synchronize means if they inflict Espeon with status, they will also be inflicted.</p> <p>Tangrowth can take Floatzel's hits while incapacitating it with Sleep Powder. Therefore, a powerful special sweeper is needed to deal with it. Ludicolo has Ice Beam to hurt Tangrowth, and even has Substitute to block Sleep Powder. Powerful Fire-types are probably the best counters to Tangrowth. Moltres can do very well as it's resistant or immune to most of Tangrowth's attacks, while hitting back with a powerful Flamethrower. Its Stealth Rock weakness does hurt, but if you can keep Stealth Rock off the field, it can do very well. Other Fire-types such as Blaziken and Houndoom have a harder time getting in, but once in, they will scare off Tangrowth. When using this Floatzel on your team, you need some way to deal with Sceptile since it is faster than Floatzel and can hit it with a powerful Leaf Storm, and even Aqua Jet won't save you. Moltres can do well against Sceptile barring the odd Rock- or Electric-type moves. Swellow is faster than Sceptile, and can take it out with Brave Bird, but its fragility means it can only revenge as it can't risk switching in. Altaria is another good counter with its resistance to Grass-type moves and super effective attacks to force Sceptile out, but it has to be wary of Hidden Power Ice.</p>"
      },
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>Floatzel is one of the few Pokemon who can Baton Pass Bulk Up boosts. The weasel's high Speed and access to Taunt help this set successfully pass the boosts. Since Whirlwind, Roar, and Perish Song are common ways to prevent Pokemon from Baton Passing boosts, Taunt helps patch that problem. It can also make certain offensively weak Pokemon setup bait. Waterfall is used as the sole attack since it's Floatzel's most reliable Water-type move, and Floatzel is not meant to be a sweeper with this set. Therefore, another attack isn't needed.</p> <p>A Jolly nature and 176 Speed EVs allows Floatzel to outspeed Timid Mismagius and Jolly Scyther while Floatzel's Defense is maximized so it can take hits as best as possible with the rest placed in HP. Floatzel doesn't need Attack EVs on this set as it's not meant to be a sweeper; it's meant to be a team supporter. Floatzel should only retaliate when it feels that it is absolutely necessary to. Otherwise, Floatzel should simply use Baton Pass to escape from harm. Leftovers is the preferred item as free recovery can help Floatzel last longer.</p> <p>This set has a lot of trouble with certain phazers, such as Raikou, who Floatzel can't risk Taunting, due to their ability to OHKO Floatzel; therefore, pairing this with a Pokemon with either Soundproof or Suction Cups is highly recommended to prevent your boosts from being eliminated. Mr. Mime can add Calm Mind boosts should you need them while its Soundproof ability can help your team not lose its boosts because of Roar. Cradily and Octillery can make use of their Suction Cup abilities to stop the phazing, and with the right amount of boosts, they make good Baton Pass receivers. Exploud has Soundproof and with the ability to use both physical and special attacks, it can make a good Baton Pass receiver as well.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types cause this set problems as they take Waterfall easily while being able to take Floatzel out with Hidden Power Grass or other moves; however, Floatzel can just Baton Pass away. Therefore, Venusaur and physical Ludicolo can make nice partners to scare off these bulky Water-types with STAB Grass-type moves and also take advantage of Bulk Up boosts. Sceptile can cause this set a lot of problems as it resists Waterfall, is faster than Floatzel, and can easily take it out with Leaf Storm. Moltres can deal with Sceptile provided you remove Stealth Rock, which makes it a good partner. Scyther can Baton Pass Agility boosts to help out your team or just take advantage of the Bulk Up boosts so it can make a nice partner to Floatzel as well.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>The ingredients to Choice Band are rather simple: a good movepool, acceptable Attack, and high Speed. You may lose the versatility of switching attacks, but the Attack boost is welcomed. While Floatzel has an impressive Speed stat, its Attack is mediocre compared to the likes of Absol and Hitmonlee, but that higher Speed can come in use at times, as well as its powerful STAB Waterfall. Waterfall is Floatzel's main attack to hit the many Ground-, Rock-, and Fire-types in UU, while Ice Punch falls close behind in hitting the many Grass-types. Ice Punch also hits Altaria hard. Return gives reliable damage; however, use a coverage move or priority here if you want. Crunch damages Slowbro and Rotom, Aqua Jet provides useful priority and makes Sucker Punch from Absol and others fail, while Brick Break isn't exactly a necessary option; however, it hits most Normal-, Steel-, and Dark-types harder than any other attack. Another option is Pursuit to trap fleeing Pokemon, such as Mismagius who is OHKOed by a Jolly Choice Band Waterfall after Stealth Rock damage, so will unlikely risk staying in.</p> <p>Adamant isn't a horrible option. It sacrifices Floatzel's Speed (361 to 329) for more power (463 to 508). Fortunately, Floatzel will still outpace positive Speed base 100s by a single point. The increase of power is welcome as it gives you a chance of 2HKOing max HP / max Defense Bold Slowbro with Crunch, assuming Stealth Rock is up; however, it will be outpaced by Timid Mismagius. Because Mismagius is a common threat, the loss of power may be worth the extra Speed provided by Jolly.</p> <p>This particular Floatzel has a lot of trouble with bulky Water-types, as even with the Attack boost, it won't be damaging them enough as they can recover off the damage. They also can switch in easily on Waterfall; therefore, having someone to counter them is a good idea. Grass-types such as Venusaur and Ludicolo can scare off these bulky Water-types with their STAB Grass-type attacks. Powerful Electric-types such as Rotom and offensive Lanturn variants can do very well against the bulky Water-types, while strong Fire-types such as Houndoom, Blaziken, and Moltres will scare off Tangrowth and also Venusaur who takes most attacks from Floatzel easily. These Fire-types can also deal with Registeel who may come in to Thunder Wave Floatzel; however, most Pokemon don't like Thunder Wave, so the Fire-types will need a Lum Berry or predict Registeel coming in.</p> <p>Faster Choice Scarf users can also cause this set problems. Choice Scarf Rotom and Mismagius are some examples as although they can't easily switch in, once in they will be able to take Floatzel out with Thunderbolt. Registeel can make a nice partner to Floatzel to take many of the special moves aimed at Floatzel, paralyze faster enemies with Thunder Wave, and it can also deal with Sceptile who sometimes causes this set problems. Toxicroak can cause this set problems as Dry Skin means it is immune to Water-type attacks. Therefore, a bulky Poison-type such as Weezing, Muk, or Nidoqueen can do well against most sets, although Muk has to watch out for Earthquake while Nidoqueen has to watch out for Earthquake and Ice Punch. Arcanine, Moltres, and Altaria are other good partners, and can do very well against Toxicroak, although they have to be wary of Stone Edge, and Ice Punch as well in the case of Altaria.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Floatzel is a surprisingly good mixed sweeper thanks to decent offensive stats and Rain Dance. This set works just like any other Rain Dance sweeper: find a turn to Rain Dance and start inflicting pain. Surf is the primary STAB here, and hits some of the physically defensive Pokemon who think they can take Floatzel's hits easily. Waterfall is the second move to hit Chansey, Clefable, and others hard. Ice Beam is used in the last slot to hit the many Grass-types of UU, while also OHKOing Altaria.</p> <p>As for other options, Toxic, Hidden Power Grass, Hidden Power Electric, Crunch, Brick Break, Return, and Aqua Jet are the best. Toxic is Floatzel's best attempt at crippling bulky Water-types, as most of them can shrug off Floatzel's other attacks. Hidden Power Grass allows it to take out Quagsire and Gastrodon while also hitting the many Water-types in UU, but Hidden Power Electric also hits most Water-types and gives a harder hit on Mantine and Qwilfish. Generally, Hidden Power Grass is better though as Quagsire and Gastrodon are more common than Mantine and Qwilfish. Crunch hits Slowbro harder than any other move while also hitting Psychic- and Ghost-types. Brick Break strikes most Normal-, Dark-, and Steel-types much harder compared to the other attacks. Return doesn't hit anything super effectively but does offer good coverage alongside Water-type moves. However, most of these Pokemon have high defenses and can thus shrug off these attacks. Aqua Jet's priority may be useful, but usually that's better left for all physical sets.</p> <p>With these EVs, Floatzel hits an amazing 540 Speed in the rain, and 270 Speed to beat neutral Toxicroak even without rain. Its Special Attack is then maximized since that's the main stat it's using, with the rest put in Attack. Life Orb is the item of choice for the power boost, but Mystic Water is a good alternative as there's no recoil. However, the loss of power in Floatzel's other attacks may hurt. Damp Rock will allow it to set up eight turns of rain, but usually the cost of losing power isn't worth it.</p> <p>Rain Dance support is needed for this set to function properly as it may not always be able to set up Rain Dance. Claydol, Rotom, and Lanturn can take Electric-type moves aimed at it and set up Rain Dance, while Claydol can set up Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin away hazards to help Floatzel and your team out. Registeel, Muk, and Altaria can take the Grass-type moves aimed at Floatzel, while setting up Rain Dance. Altaria can also support it with Heal Bell, while Muk can absorb the Toxic Spikes it hates, and Registeel can set up Stealth Rock. Uxie is another good Rain Dance supporter who can also set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types completely laugh at this set, barring the odd Hidden Power Grass or Toxic, and even Hidden Power Grass usually doesn't do enough to most. Powerful Electric-types such as Rotom can make good partners although boosted Water-type moves from the aforementioned Pokemon may hurt, but otherwise it can do well. Rotom can also set up Rain Dance to support Floatzel and its team. Lanturn is perhaps the best Electric-type partner as its high Special Defense and resistance to most of the moves commonly used by bulky Water-types means it can switch in and scare them off with a powerful Thunder, which, thanks to Rain Dance, has 100% accuracy. Toxicroak will often try and switch in, but Muk can usually deal with it, while also being able to set up Rain Dance and absorb Toxic Spikes. Dugtrio can trap and OHKO Toxicroak, but has to watch out for it using Nasty Plot on the switch, as after a boost, Toxicroak will OHKO Dugtrio with Vacuum Wave.</p>"

  "Gastrodon": {
    "overview": "<p>Like most of its fellow Water-types, Gastrodon has a good movepool and fairly decent stats in general. It also has a great defensive typing that leaves it with only one weakness--Grass-type moves--that can be easily played around with through proper team support. While powerful physical attacks may hurt Gastrodon, its resistances to Rock and Fire and immunity to Electric grant it plenty of opportunities to switch in. Resistance to Stealth Rock and access to Recover make that task of switching in all the more easier in the long run. This, in addition to its decent attacking stats, allow Gastrodon to play a couple of roles effectively. All in all, despite not having a great ability, such as Water Absorb or Marvel Scale, Gastrodon's unique assets allow it to function exceptionally well in UU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gastrodon has a few other options that it can utilize. Stone Edge is a worthy option on the Curse set, as it gives Gastrodon a weapon to use against Flying foes such as Altaria and Mantine; in addition to that, Grass-types that resist both of Gastrodon's STAB attacks are hit for neutral damage by Stone Edge. Yawn is a decent option that allows Gastrodon to put an opposing Pokemon to sleep or force switches. Interestingly, Gastrodon learns both Counter and Mirror Coat, which could potentially be used to nab a surprise KO on unsuspecting attackers. However, they will be a waste of a moveslot if you fail to predict correctly, and they lose their surprise element after they have been used once. Despite raising both Defense and Special Defense, Stockpile is not always effective, as opponents tend to switch in their Grass-types straight away, and the Defense boosts from Stockpile will not save Gastrodon from utter destruction by their STAB moves. Such a set is also very prone to critical hits overtime and doesn't really threaten the foe.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The most obvious counters for a Pokemon of Gastrodon's typing are Grass-types. Tangrowth and Venusaur are good examples, as they can switch in on almost all of the sea slug's attacks, save for Ice Beam, and proceed to OHKO it with their STAB moves. Bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Blastoise take little damage from Gastrodon's attacks, and can wear it down slowly with Toxic or hit it with Hidden Power Grass, although it is worth noting that certain Gastrodon variants also carry Toxic. Ludicolo can set up a Substitute or Swords Dance on Gastrodon, as it resists both of the sea slug's STAB attacks and takes pitiful damage from Ice Beam. Both Chansey and Clefable can easily take on the bulky Water set thanks to their sky-high Special Defense and HP stats, although without Toxic, both can do little to the Curse set without getting damaged themselves. Chansey's main form of offense against Gastrodon is to poison it, as Gastrodon too boasts excellent HP and can easily take several Seismic Toss before healing off the damage with Recover. Clefable, however, has access to Encore, which can lock Gastrodon into a single move for several turns, allowing a teammate--or even Clefable itself--to set up freely.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its great typing and decent attacking stats, Gastrodon can effectively play the role of a bulky Water while maintaining some form of offense. Surf is Gastrodon's primary and most powerful special attack that can keep Fire- and Ground-types, such as Donphan and Arcanine, at bay. In the second moveslot, you have a choice between Ice Beam or Earth Power. Ice Beam is the suggested option as it enables Gastrodon to OHKO Altaria after Stealth Rock damage, as well as hitting common Grass-type switch-ins, such as Venusaur and Leafeon, for super effective damage. Although it provides some redundant coverage alongside Surf, Earth Power hits Registeel, Kabutops, and Toxicroak for super effective damage and gets STAB. Toxic enables Gastrodon to get past common opposing bulky Water-types, such as Milotic and Slowbro, whom Gastrodon would otherwise be unable to scratch. Calm Mind Slowbro and non-RestTalk Milotic are easily beaten by the Toxic and Recover combo, as Gastrodon has enough special bulk to shrug off their attacks. However, it should be noted that some Milotic carry Hidden Power Grass, which will end Gastrodon's life quite quickly. Recover is probably the biggest asset that Gastrodon possesses, allowing it to consistently switch in on resisted attacks and heal off any damage, thereby dramatically increasing its longevity.</p> <p>252 EVs are dumped into Gastrodon's Defense, its lesser defensive stat, in order to take most resisted and neutral physical attacks with ease. 212 HP EVs give Gastrodon more bulk overall, while the remaining EVs are invested in Special Defense, allowing Gastrodon to take boosted Surfs from offensive Milotic more easily. To demonstrate Gastrodon's physical bulk, Donphan fails to 2HKO it with Earthquake after Stealth Rock, meaning that Gastrodon can switch in on the attack, take another hit, and Recover off the damage.</p> <p>One of the biggest obstacles that Gastrodon faces is its glaring weakness to Grass-type attacks. Therefore, having a teammate that can absorb such attacks is highly advised. Venusaur can more than compensate for Gastrodon's 4x weakness to Grass-type attacks, as it can switch in on other Grass-type Pokemon and immediately threaten them with its powerful STAB Sludge Bomb. Moltres has exceptional synergy with Gastrodon, as Gastrodon resists and is immune to both Rock- and Electric-type moves, respectively. In return, Moltres can massacre Registeel and Grass-types, both of which are immensely difficult for Gastrodon to take on.</p>"
      },
      "Curse": {
        "description": "<p>Gastrodon's great physical movepool and access to Curse enable it to act as a dangerous boosting tank if used correctly. With only one weakness, solid defensive stats, a handful of resistances, an immunity to Trick, and the ever-useful Recover, Gastrodon can set up on many common Pokemon in the UU metagame, making it a solid bulky sweeper and \"win-condition\" Pokemon.</p> <p>Despite Gastrodon's less-than-impressive Attack and Defense stats, it reaches a respectable 303 Attack and 279 Defense after a Curse, making it more than capable of taking several hits while striking back for significant damage. For instance, after a single Curse, Gastrodon can 2HKO both Registeel and offensive Rotom. While Curse does lower Gastrodon's Speed, this is essentially inconsequential, as Gastrodon is terribly slow to begin with. Waterfall and Earthquake offer somewhat decent coverage between them, granting Gastrodon the ability to hit most common threats for at least neutral damage. What makes Gastrodon stand out from almost all other Curse users (bar Quagsire) is its access to instant recovery, which ensures that it can set up properly when given the correct team support.</p> <p>The EV spread is very straightforward. 252 HP EVs are used to maximize Gastrodon's bulk, while 200 Special Defense EVs and a Careful nature allow Gastrodon to take neutral and resisted special attacks with the utmost ease. The remaining EVs are dumped into Defense, allowing the sea slug to take almost any powerful physical attack after a Curse or two. A mono-attacker Curse set can be used--specifically, a moveset of Curse, Waterfall, Rest, and Sleep Talk. With this set, Gastrodon has the advantage of becoming a status absorber, but this leaves Gastrodon walled by a large amount of common Pokemon, and easily set up on by others.</p> <p>This set requires teammates that can switch in on Grass-type attacks with ease. Both Chansey and Registeel are good partners since they can cripple opposing Pokemon with Thunder Wave or Toxic. Fire-types such as Moltres and Arcanine are also great teammates that resist Grass-type attacks from the likes of Tangrowth's Power Whip and Leafeon's Leaf Blade and can retaliate with super effective Fire-type attacks.</p>"
      },
      "Trapper": {
        "description": "<p>This set capitalizes on Gastrodon's unique access to Block, Yawn, and Memento to allow one completely free turn for a teammate to set up, making it a perfect support Pokemon for sweepers such as Linoone and Charizard. The idea is to use Block as the opponent switches out of Gastrodon, then absorb the incoming hit (Rindo Berry will allow it to survive all but the most powerful of Grass-type attacks) and use Yawn. From there, Gastrodon should use Memento to ensure that your next Pokemon gets in for free, just as the opposing -2 Atk / -2 SpA Pokemon falls asleep from Yawn. The final moveslot is primarily for breaking Substitutes, which can be quite annoying for this strategy, it also ensures that Gastrodon is not helpless against Taunt.</p> <p>This Gastrodon obviously needs a very specific kind of teammate--namely one that can take that one free turn and use it to cause as much damage as possible. With that in mind, Linoone is the ideal partner, thanks to the combination of Belly Drum, Extreme Speed, and Gluttony, Linoone can arguably accomplish more in a single turn than any other Pokemon in UU. Charizard is also an option as it can use the free turn to set up a Substitute and, on the following turn, use Belly Drum to simultaneously activate its Salac Berry and max out its Attack.</p> <p>Since any team using this Gastrodon will ultimately be relying on it (and the subsequent sweeper) to secure victory, it's important to be aware of the threats that might thwart Gastrodon's set-up attempts. Substitute has already been mentioned as a potential thorn in Gastrodon's side, so be extra cautious of that when a common Substitute user such as Mismagius switches in. In this situation, Gastrodon can either use its attack to break the Substitute, or predict the initial switch-in and use Yawn instead of Block to force it back out again. Explosion is also a huge concern, as not only will it deal hefty damage to Gastrodon, but it will also cause the opposing Pokemon to faint, preventing you from getting that crucial free turn. It is also vital that, when using this set, you scout the opposing team well for Lum Berry users, as they can absorb the Yawn and make Gastrodon's sacrifice a lot less effective.</p>"

  "Ambipom": {
    "overview": "<p>Quick and versatile, Ambipom is a widely popular choice for any offensive team in need of a hand. Thanks to his incredible base 115 Speed and great movepool, he can effectively act as a lead, late-game sweeper, weather supporter, or even Baton Passer. Ambipom's base 100 Attack isn't too shabby either, as combined with the rare ability Technician, his attacks will start madly ripping almost anything to shreds. He has a couple of issues though, namely his fragility, lack of resistances, and the fact that he can't get through certain physical walls with his power alone. Still, even with these flaws, Ambipom is rightfully placed as a top-tier threat in UU due to his famed hit-and-run tactics that anyone should watch out for.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ambipom has quite an interesting bag of other moves to play around with. Fake Out and Last Resort can be a lethal moveset by itself, but it is incredibly vulnerable to any Ghost-, Rock-, and Steel-type Pokemon. It should be noted that Fire Punch and Thunder Punch should never be used, because Return does more damage than both of them even if they hit super effectively. Fire Punch does hit Steel-types, though Low Kick does more damage. Aerial Ace receives a Technician boost and can be used to strike Fighting-types, but has little use outside of that. Seed Bomb is available to obliterate Rock-, Water-, and Ground-types, such as Omastar, Rhyperior, and Kabutops, if you can find a moveslot for it. Double Hit has a niche of getting through Substitutes while having a Technician boost for both hits, but it has 90 accuracy, and Substitute is seen more commonly on Ghost-types. Knock Off can be used to remove items if Ambipom can't do anything else to the opponent. A Choice Band is usable for dealing major damage in a single blow, though it requires incredible prediction to do well. On the special side, Ambipom can utilize Hidden Power Fighting, Thunderbolt, and Grass Knot. When using Hidden Power Fighting, make sure to set the Base Power to 59 and use an IV spread of 31/31/30/28/30/30 in order to receive a Technician boost while preserving the best overall IVs. With a Timid nature and 252 SpA EVs, Hidden Power Fighting can OHKO Aggron and 2HKO Rock Polish Rhyperior and Support Omastar; Thunderbolt has a chance to 2HKO Azumarill, while obtaining clean 2HKOs on Scyther and Moltres; and Grass Knot is able to OHKO Rhyperior, Omastar, and Kabutops.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Since most Ambipom carry U-turn, it is hard to completely counter him. The most reliable counter for Ambipom is Spiritomb, as Ambipom's Payback only 3HKOes him, and if Ambipom attempts to switch out, Spiritomb can use Pursuit to deal over 80% damage with a Choice Band. Additionally, without Taunt, Spiritomb can cripple him with Will-O-Wisp. Any bulky Pokemon with sufficient defenses can withstand Ambipom's attacks and retaliate back for a 2HKO. Great examples of such Pokemon include Donphan, Milotic, and Omastar. Precisely, bulky Fighting-types spell trouble for Ambipom. Hariyama can absorb any of Ambipom's attacks and OHKO back with Close Combat, while Hitmontop has Intimidate to lower Ambipom's Attack and Mach Punch to outspeed and pulverize Ambipom. Faster sweepers are also dangerous to Ambipom, as they can outspeed and smash him with powerful attacks, but they must be careful when switching into Return. Sceptile OHKOes Ambipom with Leaf Storm, Dugtrio removes him with Earthquake given he has been weakened enough, and Alakazam destroys the monkey with Psychic.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Attacking Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Ambipom has all of the ingredients he needs to become a successful lead. Fake Out should generally be used first to not only break Focus Sashes, but to gain vital information on your opponent; what item your opponent's lead Pokemon is holding, what the response to Ambipom was, or even the identification of the opponent's set by determining how much damage it received from Fake Out are helpful clues. Taunt, in tandem with Ambipom's amazing Speed, prevents common leads, such as Uxie, Omastar, and Qwilfish, from setting up disastrous entry hazards on your side. The other moves are just the icing on the cake: Low Kick is recommended for bashing Omastar, Kabutops, and Registeel, while U-turn is useful for scouting your opponent's predicted moves. Against leads such as Mismagius, Uxie, and Mesprit, there are two Dark-type moves that can be considered over Low Kick. Pursuit can trap the aforementioned Pokemon and take priority over both pixie's U-turn, while Payback is the more powerful choice in general. If you feel that U-turn is redundant, then Return is a valuable option to deal consistent damage to many common Pokemon. Life Orb is the preferred item as it boosts the power of Ambipom's every attack to a deadly level, but Silk Scarf can be used instead to boost both Fake Out's and Return's damage output without any recoil.</p> <p>It should be noted that even though this Ambipom is a lead, you can still effectively utilize him during mid- and late-game if you can preserve his HP. Switching Ambipom on a double switch and Taunting setup sweepers is a good way to save yourself from a loss. Moreover, Ambipom's Ghost immunity and access to Pursuit allows him to eradicate Ghost-types, such as Nasty Plot Mismagius and Choice Scarf Rotom, who could be lingering around.</p> <p>As this Ambipom's purpose is to scout for information, stop setup attempts, and drain the opponent's HP over time, any sweeper with a Fighting resistance and Stealth Rock weakness will thoroughly enjoy Ambipom's company. Moltres and Scyther love coming in from Ambipom's U-turn in order to use U-turn again to keep momentum on your side, or use a powerful attack such as Fire Blast or Aerial Ace, respectively. Other Pokemon with just a Fighting resistance or a Stealth Rock weakness are great partners as well. Toxicroak and Nidoking are capable of threatening a wide majority of the metagame with their immense coverage and unpredictability, while Arcanine and Altaria can dish out decent amounts of damage and take repeated punishment thanks to their respectable bulk.</p> <p>Ambipom has a couple of poor lead match-ups, especially against Spiritomb, Alakazam, and Hariyama. Spiritomb and Hariyama take little damage from Ambipom and can smack him with Pursuit and Close Combat, accordingly, while Alakazam has Inner Focus to stop Fake Out and Psychic to destroy Ambipom. Additionally, Ambipom has trouble defeating several bulky leads, such as Uxie, Omastar, and Cloyster, as they can take repeated hits and 2-3HKO back with their respective STAB attacks. Although he shares a Fighting weakness with Ambipom, Houndoom can be an impressive partner due to his ability to eliminate Spiritomb, Alakazam, and Uxie with his STAB attacks. Meanwhile, a Uxie of your own is capable of stopping Hariyama, Omastar, and Cloyster, thanks to his tremendous bulk and access to Psychic and Thunderbolt.</p>"
      },
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Although this set is quite similar to the above set, it is different in that it lacks Taunt and focuses on sweeping later in the game with four attacks. Start off the battle with Fake Out, as it is essentially free damage against the opponent (unless Ambipom is met with a Ghost-type). Afterward, Ambipom should follow up with the appropriate attacking move. Return gives Ambipom a reliable attack to bash any Pokemon not resistant or immune to it. Low Kick smashes Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon who dare get in Ambipom's way. Pursuit prevents Ghost-types not called Spiritomb from switching out freely. Payback is a viable option over Pursuit for dishing out more overall damage against Ghost-types, which is helpful against the aforementioned Spiritomb, who otherwise completely walls this set.</p> <p>Entry hazard users are great partners for this set since they build up damage over time, which will eventually lead to the opponent's team being weakened enough for this Ambipom to pick off each foe. You can consider using Fighting-resistant entry hazard users such as Qwilfish and Nidoqueen to set up Toxic Spikes (and Spikes, in Qwilfish's case), as well as Uxie and Mesprit to set up Stealth Rock. Make sure that these Pokemon can also retaliate back against Fighting-types outside of using entry hazards. Both Uxie and Mesprit can use Psychic to damage opposing Fighting-types, while Qwilfish and Nidoqueen can use their respective STAB moves to slowly destroy most Fighters.</p> <p>Support in the form of Wish and clerics can be beneficial to this Ambipom, since his health will be rapidly draining overtime and status may have been afflicted upon him. Noteworthy Wish users include Leafeon and Gardevoir, while notable clerics include Uxie and Mismagius. Although he doesn't resist Fighting, Leafeon has the ability to rack up more entry hazard damage via Roar. Gardevoir, along with Mismagius, can burn physical threats with Will-O-Wisp. All four Pokemon also have access to boosting moves that can help soften the opponent's team so that Ambipom can sweep easily in the long run.</p>"
      },
      "Weather Support": {
        "description": "<p>With great Speed and various weather support moves in his arsenal, Ambipom makes a wonderful weather supporter. This set can be used as either a lead or a back-up supporter, depending on your tastes. First, use Fake Out to not only dent the foe, but to also break Focus Sashes, which could be troubling for most weather sweepers. Next, follow up with your chosen weather move to ensure seven turns of rampage from your weather sweeper. If the scenario calls for it, Taunt can be utilized to block crippling status or setup attempts made by the opposing Pokemon. Finally, smack the opposition with U-turn and switch out to a weather sweeper. However, keep in mind that if Ambipom uses U-turn, it is likely that your weather sweeper will be damaged when switching in. As such, it might be better off just letting Ambipom faint on the setup turn.</p> <p>252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Spe can be used as an alternative EV spread, improving Ambipom's chances of setting up weather multiple times throughout a battle. The lack of offensive power this spread yields is moot, as Fake Out and U-turn aren't meant to be dealing much damage, anyway. To demonstrate Ambipom's bulk with this spread, here are some calculations:</p> <ul> <li>Physically Defensive Milotic Surf: 40.7% - 48.3%</li> <li>Morning Glory Arcanine Extreme Speed: 40.7% - 48%</li> <li>SubSeed Sceptile Leaf Storm: 78.2% - 92.4%</li> <li>Sweeper Scyther Brick Break: 75.1% - 88.7%</li> </ul> <p>Depending on the weather, Ambipom requires teammates who can sweep under such conditions, especially with a Fighting resistance; Qwilfish, Exeggutor, and Vileplume are all great candidates for this. During rain, Qwilfish can boost his Attack with Swords Dance, then blast his foes with Waterfall and Poison Jab. When he's done, he can deliver a devastating Explosion to an unlucky victim. Despite not having a Fighting resistance, Gorebyss is also an excellent rain sweeper to consider due to his high Defense and extreme special attacking prowess. On the sunny side, Exeggutor can sleep foes with Sleep Powder and obliterate them with his multitude of powerful attacks such as Leaf Storm and Psychic. Like Qwilfish, Exeggutor can utilize Explosion to take down a foe with him while giving a teammate a free switch-in. Lastly, Vileplume, though inferior to Exeggutor, is another great Chlorophyll abuser due to his STAB Sludge Bomb.</p>"
      },
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>Ambipom is the only UU Pokemon who is capable of passing both Agility and Nasty Plot. Although he is not bulky by any means, he does have access to Taunt, allowing him to disable phazers before they can break the pass. Furthermore, his blistering Speed allows him to outspeed most of UU before an Agility boost, and literally the entire tier afterward. This allows Ambipom to play as a deadly single-Pokemon passer. If the defender is caught off-guard, this set can effectively win the game in a turn.</p> <p>All four moves on this set are critical. Agility and Nasty Plot are the main reasons to use Ambipom, allowing him to pass deadly boosts to a teammate. Taunt is necessary to stop moves such as Whirlwind, Trick, and Encore from ruining Ambipom's strategy. The EVs and item choice are more flexible. Leftovers helps Ambipom survive several hits while setting up. This can be especially critical if the first receiver fails. However, it does give away Ambipom's moveset. Chople Berry covers Ambipom's only weakness, allowing him to boost in the face of powerful Fighting attacks. This is very helpful because Fighting attacks are one of the main defenses against Baton Pass Ambipom. The last option is Lum Berry; although Taunt can already protect Ambipom from status, an unexpected sleep, chance to freeze, or (to a lesser extent) paralysis move can essentially remove Ambipom from the game. Both Chople Berry and Lum Berry do not give away Ambipom's hold item, and may trick the opponent into thinking that Ambipom is using a more conventional attacking set.</p> <p>Maximum Speed is mainly used in case Ambipom is unable to pull off an Agility. Nasty Plot is usually superior to Agility if Ambipom can only afford to pass one boost, depending on the scenario; for example, a +2 Speed Moltres is still hopelessly walled by Chansey and Milotic, while the same cannot be said about a +2 SpA Moltres. If you are willing to overlook this possibility, you can shift 252 EVs from Speed to either defensive stat with a defense-boosting nature. This gives Ambipom more bulk while still enabling him to outspeed most Scarfed Pokemon after an Agility. Since neither Technician or Pickup help this Ambipom, you can choose either ability.</p> <p>As a stand-alone Baton Passer, Ambipom requires specific team support to be successful. Ambipom is not bulky and is not receiving defensive boosts, so dual screens are almost mandatory. Uxie stands out as a screener due to his gargantuan defenses and access to U-turn or Memento, allowing him to get Ambipom in safely. Gardevoir is less bulky, but has access to Wish and Healing Wish, helping Ambipom pull off a second pass if needed. Though Alakazam is extremely frail, he has access to a very fast Taunt, stopping the opponent from setting up on the screening turns. Ambipom can also be used as part of a longer Baton Pass chain, where defensive passers such as Gorebyss and Drifblim can help Ambipom boost to +6 SpA.</p> <p>For receivers, Moltres is the best general option. The fiery bird has perfect coverage, reliable recovery, and resists Fighting, Ambipom's only weakness. Additionally, he has enough bulk to survive most priority attacks. However, Moltres is 4x weak to Stealth Rock. Since Ambipom cannot Rapid Spin, this can stop Ambipom from passing to Moltres in the first place. Other possible receivers include Magneton, who has 13 resistances, and Venomoth, who can deal a lot of damage with Tinted Lens and has access to a sleep-inducing move in Sleep Powder.</p> <p>Ambipom is most vulnerable during his passing stage. Phazing moves ruin Ambipom if they are successful, and even if Ambipom Taunts, using it wastes a precious dual screen turn. Powerful Fighting STAB attacks can force Ambipom to pass before he gathers his boosts, which dramatically weakens the sweeper. If Ambipom is being used as a stand-alone passer, Substitute is a deadly threat. The receiver is forced to take an attack before he can sweep, which could possibly result in him taking big damage or even being KOed. Other anti-setup moves such as Perish Song and Encore can force Ambipom to switch out, erasing all of his boosts in the process. Finally, Brick Break destroys screens while hitting Ambipom super effectively. Take caution and scout ahead for the aforementioned threats before switching in this Ambipom. For more information on how to build a pure Baton Pass team, read this specialized guide to Baton Pass chains.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>At first glance, it may seem silly to play around with Ambipom's vastly inferior Special Attack, but he can actually become quite frightening after a few Nasty Plot boosts. However, Ambipom's sole purpose is to not only sweep, but to also pass Nasty Plot boosts to an even more threatening sweeper. Swift is the best attacking option, as it receives a useful Technician boost, greatly improving its power. Taunt stops any foe from ruining Ambipom's sweep or pass. If you want Ambipom to cover more threats, then you can replace either Baton Pass or Taunt with Water Pulse, which also obtains a Technician boost. Together, Water Pulse and Swift offer perfect neutral coverage in UU, outside of Shedinja.</p> <p>Similar to the Pure Baton Pass set, this set appreciates powerful special sweepers as receivers. Moltres is the single best receiver due to his Fighting resistance and sheer power. To show just how powerful Moltres is after a Nasty Plot pass, he can always OHKO Bulky Water Milotic with Hidden Power Grass after Stealth Rock. There are other good receivers too, such as Sceptile and Milotic, but they are vulnerable to Fighting attacks. However, Sceptile is fast enough to cause destruction with his attacks, while Milotic has the bulk to stay in and dish out heavy damage.</p> <p>Special walls and phazers are deadly threats to Ambipom if he lacks Taunt. Specifically, Chansey can smash Ambipom with repeated Seismic Tosses, while Milotic can obliterate him with Surf. Moreover, Chansey can paralyze the recipient with Thunder Wave, while Milotic can wash the boosts away with Haze. Fitting Fighting-types such as Toxicroak in your team would be a huge boon to Ambipom's success. Toxicroak can comfortably switch in on Chansey and Milotic, use Substitute to block status, and smash them with its powerful Fighting-type attacks.</p>"

  "Drifblim": {
    "overview": "<p>Baton Pass is the main reason to use Drifblim over its Ghost-type brethren; it has a massive HP stat, immunity to common Ground-, Fighting-, and Normal-type moves, and two useful abilities in Aftermath and Unburden. Drifblim also has passable defenses and a variety of good supporting moves such as Hypnosis, Thunder Wave, and Haze. The downsides to using Drifblim are its Pursuit weakness, lack of reliable recovery outside of Rest (unlike other Flying-types, Drifblim does not learn Roost), and crippling Stealth Rock weakness. Overall, Drifblim is outclassed by Mismagius and Rotom, but if you can utilize Drifblim for its good points, it becomes an excellent addition to your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Drifblim is a very versatile Pokemon with a lot of extraneous moves not mentioned in the above sets. Destiny Bond may be useful against slower opponents such as Rhyperior, who can hit Drifblim super effectively and is guaranteed to KO it. Haze may be helpful to erase boosts from Pokemon like Swords Dance Venusaur and Rock Polish Torterra. Memento can replace Explosion on any of the sets and may be useful to set up for a fragile sweeper, such as BellyZard or Belly Drum Linoone. Ominous Wind may be useful as it has the chance to raise all stats, though the 10% chance of that happening makes it almost useless. On the subject of stat boosts, Psych Up is an interesting option that allows Drifblim to steal any boosts the opponent has gained, and have them for itself, or even Baton Pass them. Drifblim's Flying-type STAB is poor, though Air Slash and Hidden Power Flying are available if you wish to use them. Sucker Punch helps hit faster opponents for priority, and it works reasonably well off Drifblim's base 80 Attack. Finally, Drifblim has access to Pain Split for recovery, but its base HP is too high to make it useful.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Drifblim is hard to counter outright due to Baton Pass. Phazers, such as Milotic and Hariyama, make the best counters as they can erase any boosts Drifblim may have accumulated and scout the rest of Drifblim's team. Chansey, Clefable, and Registeel are difficult for Drifblim to get past, as its Shadow Ball does a pittance to all of them; these Pokemon all have respectable HP and defensive stats, as well as good recovery (barring Registeel). The only issue is that none of them like being Tricked a Choice item, and the former two want to avoid Explosion. Specially defensive Dark-types such as Spiritomb are great, as they take little damage from any of Drifblim's attacks, and Spiritomb is also immune to Explosion. Drapion is another decent choice due to its ability to trap Drifblim with Pursuit or slice it with Night Slash, dealing hefty damage. Lesser used options are good too: Porygon2 makes a decent counter, as it has excellent defenses, immunity to Shadow Ball, and access to super effective moves such as Thunderbolt and Ice Beam. Skuntank is another great option as it can switch into most of Drifblim's attacks, and threaten it with STAB Dark-type moves such as Night Slash and Pursuit; it also has Taunt to cripple Baton Pass sets and any that attempt to set up.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "ChestoRest": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Drifblim's arguably better ability, Unburden. The idea behind this set is to boost Drifblim's stats with Calm Mind, and when it is at low health, Rest is used to restore its HP. After activating Drifblim's Chesto Berry, it'll be at full health, maintaining all Calm Mind boosts, and having its Speed doubled by Unburden. From there, Drifblim should attempt to sweep the opponent. Shadow Ball is used for STAB, Hidden Power Fighting provides coverage against Normal-, Steel-, and Dark-types, and Thunderbolt is used to hit Milotic who carry Haze. Baton Pass is another good choice, as it allows Drifblim to support teammates with Calm Mind boosts as well. This set is better left for late-game when the opponent's powerful sweepers are removed, and you are able to set up against weaker Pokemon such as Chansey, Venusaur, or Clefable.</p> <p>148 Speed EVs and a Modest nature ensures that Drifblim outspeeds Choice Scarf Rotom after the Unburden boost. Maximum Defense gives Drifblim more physical bulk to work with, as it will be boosting its Special Defense with Calm Mind. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Attack, turning Drifblim into an offensive threat. Alternatively, you may use a Timid nature along with 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe EVs and using Substitute or Thunderbolt over Rest, and Leftovers as its item; such a set makes Drifblim more offensive. Petaya Berry may also be used with Substitute and Unburden.</p> <p>A Pokemon with Aromatherapy or Heal Bell is helpful in case Drifblim is unable to wake up due to switching, or using its item already. Chansey, Clefable, Uxie, and Venusaur are all reliable options due to their great defensive stats and support options. If you use Baton Pass on this set, a Pokemon to receive the boosts is essential; Milotic and Moltres are great options due to their wide offensive movepools and high Special Attack stats.</p>"

      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>Drifblim's mammoth base 150 HP stat allows it to pass huge Substitutes to its teammates, along with boosts from Calm Mind or Stockpile. Shadow Ball is listed so Drifblim isn't completely crippled by Taunt users, though Normal-types such as Ambipom may cause problems, making Explosion an option in the last slot. Drifblim has good typing compared to most Baton Pass users, having an immunity to common moves like Earthquake and Close Combat, and having many more useful resistances. Aftermath is the ability of choice, as this set doesn't carry a single use item, and it also deals damage to the opposing Pokemon that KOed Drifblim if they used a move that makes contact with it.</p> <p>The EVs on this set make Drifblim as fast as possible, allowing it to tie with other base 80 Pokemon such as Venusaur and Blaziken. Maximum Special Defense is used, making Drifblim more difficult to take out, and the remaining 4 are placed into Defense, ensuring Drifblim has an odd HP stat, enabling it to switch into Stealth Rock 4 times. If you wish to use Explosion in the last slot, a Jolly nature is recommended, as it doesn't lower any of Drifblim's defensive stats.</p> <p>As Drifblim is going to be passing Substitutes and stat boosts, a Pokemon to receive them is a necessary teammate. Frail sweepers such as Alakazam and Toxicroak appreciate the easier switch-in, while bulkier Pokemon like Hariyama or Rhyperior may use it to set up Focus Punch or Rock Polish. If Drifblim is running Calm Mind, a special sweeper such as Moltres or Milotic make good choices to pair with this set; mixed sweepers like Blaziken are good too. Exploud is another excellent option, as Soundproof makes it harder to erase stat boosts and Substitutes thanks to making Exploud immune to Roar, while Exploud can plow through the opponent's team with its great movepool.</p>"

      "Pinch Berry Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>Although this set also uses Baton Pass, it's played in a completely different way than the above set. This Drifblim variant utilizes a pinch Berry alongside Unburden to raise its Speed. Shadow Ball is used as a reliable STAB move, while Hypnosis cripples the opposing Pokemon and aids setting up. Recycle may also be used in the last slot, allowing Drifblim to reuse its pinch Berry. To begin the setup, you should switch Drifblim into a Fighting-, Ground-, or Normal-type move, then proceed to use Substitute. If you predict the opponent will switch, you may Baton Pass the Substitute or hit the switch-in with Hypnosis or Shadow Ball. If you think the opponent will stay in and attack, Drifblim should Substitute again until its Berry activates, in turn activating Unburden. Be warned, after using Baton Pass, the receiving Pokemon doesn't get its Speed doubled; only Drifblim does due to its ability.</p> <p>60 Speed EVs along with a Timid nature give Drifblim 232 Speed, which allows it to outrun Choice Scarf Rotom after an Unburden boost. Max Special Defense is used for bulk, while the remaining EVs are placed into Defense. There is a bias towards Special Defense as it's Drifblim's higher defense stat. The defensive EVs make Drifblim's Substitutes difficult to break, surviving Registeel's Iron Head, Leafeon's Leaf Blade, and Power Whip from Leftovers Venusaur.</p> <p>Teammates to receive the stat boosts are important; special sweepers like Rotom and Moltres are good choices to receive Petaya Boosts, as neither of them have reliable stat boosting moves (Rotom's Charge Beam isn't 100% guaranteed to boost its Special Attack). On the other hand, physical sweepers such as Swellow and Arcanine appreciate the boost from Liechi Berry. Mixed Octillery is interesting, as it receives either boost with equally good attacking stats, and has Suction Cups to block Roar and Whirlwind users, such as Donphan and Hariyama.</p>"

      "Hindenburg (UU Lead)": {
        "description": "<p>Drifblim makes a great lead: its objective is to take two of the opponent's Pokemon out of the match (provided Hypnosis hits) and scout the opponent's team by forcing switches. The strategy behind this set is to play aggressively and attack or put a Pokemon to sleep while surviving a normally fatal hit. Losing Focus Sash activates Unburden, letting Drifblim reach a Speed stat of 464, outpacing Timid Choice Scarf Rotom, who is almost certainly the fastest Pokemon you will face in UU. Many common leads can unwittingly activate Drifblim's Focus Sash by dealing 100% damage, at which point Drifblim can attack freely, put an opposing Pokemon to sleep, and Explode when it's in danger of being KOed.</p> <p>This set has the surprise factor on its side, as most people expect Drifblim to create bulky Substitutes and Baton Pass them. Drifblim fares very well against many common leads in the UU metagame, although Hypnosis is a high-risk, high-reward move. However, Drifblim will often get two chances to use Hypnosis if it needs to, thanks to Focus Sash and its ability, Unburden.</p> <p>Drifblim's defensive IVs are as low as possible to increase the chance of Focus Sash being broken, while still allowing it to retain a 70 Base Power Hidden Power Fighting. Below are examples of common leads that will activate Unburden.</p> <ul> <li>252 Atk Adamant Arcanine Flare Blitz vs. Drifblim: 128.9% - 151.7%</li> <li>252 SpA Timid Life Orb Moltres Fire Blast vs. Drifblim: 123.3% - 145.1%</li> <li>Any Rhyperior Stone Edge vs. Drifblim: 100+%</li> <li>48 SpA Hasty Electrode Thunder vs. Drifblim: 113.6% - 134%</li> <li>252 SpA Modest Mesprit Ice Beam vs. Drifblim: 97.6% - 115%%</li> <li>252 Atk Brave Life Orb Cloyster Rock Blast vs. Drifblim: 213.6% - 252.4%</li> <li>252 Atk Adamant Kabutops Stone Edge vs. Drifblim: 221.4% - 260.7%</li> <li>252 Atk Adamant Pinsir Stone Edge vs. Drifblim: 156.8% - 184.5%</li> </ul> <p>As far as team options go, they are relatively non-specific for this set. However, there are a few key situations in which Drifblim will need some assistance. Leads such as Ambipom, Kabutops, and Cloyster are threatening due to their ability to either 2HKO Drifblim without activating Unburden, or finish Drifblim off with a priority attack after activating Unburden. This leaves Drifblim with a mere 60% chance to beat these leads (factoring in Hypnosis's accuracy), or 0% if Ambipom Taunts while Drifblim uses Hypnosis. Although 60% might not sound bad, bear in mind that Drifblim will have accomplished absolutely nothing if Hypnosis misses, effectively making the match six-on-five from the beginning. Therefore, it is wise to have the appropriate Pokemon backing Drifblim up in order to take care of such threats. Rock- and Steel-types, though they need to be wary of Low Kick, handle Ambipom well, as does Pursuit Spiritomb. Toxicroak, Milotic, and Hitmontop can all take on Cloyster and Kabutops, but switching back to Drifblim may be necessary to avoid Cloyster's Explosion. Rapid Spin also makes for great support, as should a particular lead, such as Kabutops, force Drifblim to switch out, Drifblim will be able to switch back in later without losing its Focus Sash in the process.</p> <p>Should this strategy work properly, the opponent will probably attempt to finish off Drifblim with a priority attack. Pokemon that can abuse switch-ins such as Azumarill, Spiritomb, and Donphan make nice partners for Drifblim. Venusaur is a great example of a teammate that can scare off the aforementioned Pokemon while possibly sneaking in a Swords Dance or putting a Pokemon to sleep in the process. Sweepers like Leafeon, Feraligatr, and Toxicroak can also use this opportunity to set up if they can avoid Spiritomb's Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

      "Rain Support": {
        "description": "<p>Surprisingly, Drifblim makes an excellent Rain Dance user due to its high Speed and access to Explosion, Thunder, and Weather Ball. Drifblim also beats common threats to Rain Dance teams with Explosion, especially Tangrowth, as Drifblim resists every attack it commonly carries barring Hidden Power Ice. Thunder is an excellent option, it has 100% accuracy in the rain as well as a high paralysis rate. Weather Ball is another good choice, giving Drifblim a 150 Base Power Water attack to play with. Damp Rock is the item of choice as it prolongs the rain, and Aftermath is good to weaken opponents who dare KO Drifblim. Baton Pass is an option in the last slot if you don't want to witness the Hindenburg disaster, allowing Drifblim to escape the battlefield.</p> <p>The EVs focus on turning Drifblim into a powerful special sweeper; the remaining EVs are placed into Attack to boost Explosion's power. A Hasty nature is better than Timid or Naive, as it doesn't lower Drifblim's Attack, while keeping its higher Special Defense intact. If you decide to use Baton Pass over Explosion in the last slot, a Timid nature is the better choice, and the Attack EVs can be shifted to Defense.</p> <p>Pokemon who can take advantage of the rain make great partners for this set. Swift Swimmers such as Ludicolo, Omastar, and Gorebyss are effective choices on the special side, while Kabutops and Qwilfish are excellent choices on the physical. Electric-types also appreciate the rain, as they gain a 100% accurate STAB Thunder. Magneton, Manectric, and Rotom are good examples of Pokemon who can abuse Thunder. Lanturn is an interesting option as it can abuse 100% accurate Thunder, boosted Water-type attacks, and its Volt Absorb ability to protect its fellow Water-types from Electric-type attacks. Additional Rain Dancers are recommended to use alongside Drifblim, as it's used as a suicide lead in most cases. Uxie, Registeel, and Lanturn are all excellent due to their great defensive stats, good support moves, and decent typing.</p> <p>Toxicroak, Chansey, and Registeel are troublesome for Rain Dance teams, and there are a few simple solutions to this. Dugtrio can trap these Pokemon with its ability and hit them with STAB Earthquake. Fighting-types, such as Hariyama and Hitmontop, are also good options as they can hit the opponents with STAB Close Combat and powerful Earthquakes. The aforementioned examples are also bulky enough to set up Rain Dance for the team.</p>"
      },
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>This set uses Choice items to turn Drifblim into a revenge killer, along with Trick to cripple an opponent's wall or any Pokemon that tries to set up on Drifblim. Shadow Ball is used for a reliable STAB move, while Hidden Power Fighting provides perfect type coverage alongside it, hitting Steel-, Dark-, and Normal-type opponents. In the last slot, Thunderbolt hits Water-types such as Milotic, and Flying-types like Moltres and Scyther. Baton Pass is also listed as an option for the fourth slot, as it turns Drifblim into a scout and allows it to escape Pursuit users unharmed. If you're playing hardball, Explosion could be used in the last slot. If you decide to do this, then a Mild or Hasty nature is recommended; taking out a special wall such as Chansey is very welcome.</p> <p>Specially defensive Pokemon like Chansey, Clefable, Spiritomb, and Milotic can be a pain in the backside, meaning you'll have to take some precautions against the aforementioned foes. Entry hazards such as Spikes and Toxic Spikes are helpful for damaging such Pokemon upon switching in, and crippling walls with Toxic, respectively. Drapion, Qwilfish, and Cloyster are all excellent options to set them up for the team. Chansey, Clefable, and Registeel can be beaten by physical sweepers, such as Blaziken, Hariyama, and Hitmontop, or Dugtrio can trap them with its ability.</p> <p>Pursuit users, such as Drapion and Houndoom, are troublesome if they switch into Shadow Ball. To get past these foes, Dugtrio may be used to trap them with its ability, or Hitmontop may use its priority moves and Earthquake to KO them. Hariyama is a decent alternative due to Thick Fat and its huge HP stat, which makes it more difficult for Houndoom and Drapion to get past it. Hariyama also has Close Combat and Earthquake to beat common Dark- and Fire-types. Pursuit Swellow is rare, but a dangerous threat if Drifblim is locked into Shadow Ball. Registeel and Steelix are both excellent partners as they wall Swellow, and have access to powerful STAB moves such as Iron Head and Gyro Ball to knock it out.</p>"

  "Lopunny": {
    "overview": "<p>Lopunny's biggest asset is her unpredictability, as she can run a large number of sets effectively. When Lopunny's revealed, you won't know whether she's a supporter, a Baton Passer, or maybe even both. Many opponents blindly switch in the Pokemon who would be least effected by Switcheroo, but this plan can go awry if she sets up Substitute or Agility. Lopunny can always manage to keep her opponents guessing.</p> <p>Although unpredictable, Lopunny faces stiff competition from Alakazam and Jumpluff, who both have access to Encore as well as higher Speed. Alakazam can employ Trick as well, and Jumpluff has a crippling Sleep Powder. With Trick being so widespread, other Pokemon are chosen instead of Lopunny for this particular role. That being said, Lopunny still has one the largest support movepools of any Pokemon (including the excellent Baton Pass) and a unique ability which distinguishes her from other Trick users. Lopunny's strengths lie not in brute force, but in support and messing with the opponent's strategy. One misprediction can cost you the match, so underestimate her at your peril.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lopunny has an extremely large support movepool. Toxic, Charm, Captivate, Mirror Coat, Fake Tears, and Swagger are all options that weren't mentioned but can find their way into a specialized set. Lopunny can be a decent weather supporter with the proper item, high Speed, and access to both Rain Dance and Sunny Day. Fake Out and Quick Attack can be used on Lopunny, but Ambipom is better in that department. Endeavor is available and can be used to severely weaken a Pokemon as Lopunny's health becomes low.</p> <p>Although it's not one of Lopunny's strong suits, she can run a few viable offensive sets. Lopunny has access to nifty physical moves such as Low Kick and the elemental punches, making a Choice Band set a decent option. She can also still utilize Switcheroo; just don't forget to use Cute Charm. In addition, Lopunny can run a SubPunch set as her common switch-ins such as Steelix or Rhyperior are weak to Fighting, and she can Baton Pass the Substitute to a more capable Pokemon if the need arises.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Since Lopunny's sets are geared towards support, a mixed attacker such as Blaziken, Nidoking, or Sharpedo makes a great initial switch-in. None of them mind any of the Choice items and can hit Lopunny hard with the proper attack. Fighting-types including Hitmonlee and Hitmontop can OHKO Lopunny with their STAB attacks but they don't enjoy receiving a Flame Orb or Choice Specs. Hariyama can obtain a Guts boost from Flame Orb or Thunder Wave and OHKO her with STAB Close Combat. Arcanine can hit Lopunny hard with Flare Blitz and heal off any damage with Morning Sun, while also being immune to Flame Orb's effects. He won't particularly enjoy a Choice Scarf or paralysis, however. Faster Taunters such as Ambipom and Floatzel shut most Lopunny down, as do faster Encore users such as Alakazam and Jumpluff. Steelix, Donphan, and Blastoise can ruin any attempts at Baton Passing with Roar while Altaria can accomplish the same with Perish Song. Haze Milotic can switch in and remove any boosts Lopunny may have attained.</p> <p>Countering Lopunny is a daunting prospect because she will always manage to cripple at least one Pokemon, or pull off at least one successful pass. It may take multiple Pokemon to scout her set, but once it's revealed she shouldn't cause many problems. Just don't forget that her access to Encore means that pulling off a sweep will be difficult until she's eliminated from the match. Luckily, she has no way of healing herself and is worn down quickly.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Baton Pass + Switcheroo": {
        "description": "<p>High Speed coupled with Encore is a dangerous combination, especially when the user can also employ a quick SubPass strategy. This is arguably Lopunny's most effective set, as it combines all of her assets and abuses them to the fullest.</p> <p>Lopunny works as a simple Substitute passer, allowing frail teammates to get in safely or on an attack they otherwise wouldn't be able to switch in on. Encore is Lopunny's greatest tool in making sure the strategy is pulled off. Lopunny can Encore weak attacks or an attack her teammate is immune to, and then simply Baton Pass and allow it to obtain a free turn. Switcheroo is an excellent move to round out this set. Because of Lopunny's unique ability, Klutz, she can simply bide her time and choose the appropriate Pokemon to cripple, unlike other Trick users such as Uxie and Mesprit who would be forced into one move. Klutz also allows her to absorb the harmful items an opposing Tricker may try to cripple one of your Pokemon with, and throw it back at the opponent. Flame Orb is a great option to cripple powerful physical attackers who enjoy switching into Lopunny, such as Rhyperior, but Choice Scarf cripples a wider variety of Pokemon by locking them into one move.</p> <p>Lopunny needs maximum Speed to ensure she outpaces as many Pokemon as possible. A Timid nature is chosen because Lopunny doesn't have any attacks, and it reduces the amount of damage she takes when she hurts herself from confusion. The HP EVs give Lopunny a decent amount of bulk; she can survive a Modest Life Orb Alakazam's Psychic with a bit of health left to spare. Lopunny has alternative choices in the item department such as Lagging Tail and the other Choice items, but they're usually inferior options.</p> <p>Because of Lopunny's high Speed, many Pokemon such as Registeel may try to paralyze her. Substitute blocks this, however, and allows Lopunny to Encore then Baton Pass to a teammate. With proper prediction, the possibilities brought by a high-Speed Encore are endless. For example, Lopunny can switch into Shadow Ball, Substitute, or Nasty Plot from Mismagius with Hidden Power Fighting (the lowered Speed IV ensures that Lopunny is faster) and Encore her, making her much easier to handle. Lopunny can also switch into other powerful threats including Swords Dance Leafeon and Nasty Plot Houndoom as they begin to set up, and foil their chances at a sweep. After Lopunny has been revealed, many opponents will be hesitant to set up a Pokemon slower than her, allowing you to be free from worry that a powerful Pokemon will end up sweeping until she's been eliminated.</p> <p>Lopunny has significant trouble with Fighting- and Fire-types. If Lopunny has already Tricked away Flame Orb, powerful Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee and Hitmontop can freely switch in and OHKO her with their STAB attacks. Hariyama is the most threatening because he can obtain a Guts boost from Flame Orb. A bulky Psychic-type such as Uxie or Slowbro is useful in sponging these Pokemon's assaults. Lopunny can also Baton Pass to Mismagius and Rotom on a Fighting-type move, allowing them to switch in freely and behind a substitute. Fire-types such as Arcanine and Houndoom are also problems because they're immune to Flame Orb's effects and don't mind Choice Scarf as much. Rhyperior is also a nuisance if Lopunny is without a Flame Orb. A Water-type such as Azumarill or Milotic works excellently to scare off these threats. Potential counters need to be wary of Switcheroo and Lopunny's ability to Baton Pass to a counter.</p>"
      },
      "Agility + Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>With base 105 Speed and access to Encore, Lopunny makes a brilliant Baton Passer. Unlike Lopunny's other sets, this set takes a less subtle approach in setting up her teammates, and is particularly risky, but the payoff can be huge.</p> <p>The plan is to switch into a Pokemon who is using a support move such as Stealth Rock or is healing itself and Encore the opponent, locking it into the last used move. You can also abuse Lopunny's immunity to Ghost by switching into Shadow Ball or Shadow Sneak. Once Encored, the opponent will likely switch, giving Lopunny an opportunity to use Agility. At this point, begin using Substitute as the opponent attacks you. After the third Substitute, the Berry you've chosen will kick in, and the boosts can be passed to a sweeper who will obliterate the opposing team.</p> <p>The choice of Berry depends on what type of sweeper you're trying to set up. Physical sweepers will enjoy the Liechi boost, while special attackers will welcome the Petaya boost. Lum Berry is a safe option that can aid Lopunny against status. Starf Berry is also available and is a riskier alternative, but the payoff can be huge if Lopunny manages to grab a +2 Attack or Special Attack boost. Cute Charm is necessary as Klutz would prevent the Berries from activating, and can also give Lopunny an easier time setting up if the opponent becomes attracted.</p> <p>Faster Taunt users can be a huge roadblock to Lopunny. Fortunately, only Ambipom and Alakazam fulfill this role in UU. Spiritomb is great to Pursuit these threats as they switch and to absorb Fighting-type attacks aimed at Lopunny. Haze Milotic is a hindrance to Lopunny, so a strong Grass-type such as Sceptile or Venusaur makes a good partner. Perish Song Altaria and Roar Steelix also cause problems. Milotic handles these threats with Ice Beam and Surf, respectively. An alternative would be having a Pokemon with Soundproof or Suction Cups, such as Mr. Mime or Octillery. Mr. Mime can continue passing on the chain while Octillery can use the Speed boost to sweep.</p>"

      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Lopunny's support movepool is nearly unmatched, making her a fantastic choice to aid the team. Switcheroo is perfect to cripple Lopunny's common switch-ins. Ground-types such as Torterra and Fighting-types such as Hitmontop will be rendered useless by Flame Orb, which cuts their offensive capabilities significantly. Choice Scarf cripples walls and sweepers by locking them into one move. Encore allows Lopunny to halt set-up attempts and gives her team free switch-in opportunities. For example, Lopunny can Encore weak attacks from Registeel and go to a threatening sweeper, giving it a vital free turn without fear of status. Heal Bell gets rid of all status effects on your team, while Lopunny can spread status herself with Thunder Wave. Employing a dry Baton Pass is a great strategy to help build momentum and safely counter threats, although if Taunt is troublesome Lopunny can run Return which packs enough of a bite to hurt frail sweepers significantly.</p> <p>Lopunny has a few other move options that easily fit into this set. Magic Coat can be used to bounce back harmful status moves such as Thunder Wave and Sleep Powder, while Healing Wish can restore a teammate back to mint condition, provided you're willing to sacrifice Lopunny. Lagging Tail and the other Choice items are viable item alternatives, but they aren't as effective if Tricked to the wrong Pokemon.</p> <p>Fighting- and Fire-types are major threats to Lopunny. Hariyama is extremely dangerous because Flame Orb and Thunder Wave give him a Guts boost and his STAB attack will OHKO. Arcanine is also threatening because of his immunity to Flame Orb. Slowbro makes a great partner for this Lopunny as he can easily handle these threats, while she halts any set-up attempts Mismagius makes. Spiritomb makes an ideal partner as he's immune to Fighting attacks and can defeat Fighting-types with repeated Shadow Balls. He can also scare off and Pursuit faster Pokemon such as Ambipom and Alakazam before they can Taunt or Encore Lopunny.</p> <p>Many sweepers enjoy having Lopunny's support. Since Lopunny has the defenses to Encore a weak Surf or Flamethrower from walls, she can switch to a friendly sweeper who will be given a free turn that they would otherwise find difficult to obtain. Thunder Wave can also allow slow but powerful Pokemon such as Marowak a chance to sweep. Lopunny's ability to give fearsome Pokemon such as Torterra, Houndoom, and Toxicroak that crucial turn they need to set up is extremely useful, and can turn the match around in the blink of an eye.</p>"

  "Mismagius": {
    "overview": "<p>With excellent Speed and Special Attack, decent special bulk, a fine movepool, and three immunities, Mismagius is one of the top-tier threats in UU. Both its offensive and defensive sets are some of the defining forces in the tier, and the metagame has been forced to adapt in order to deal with them. It is a tribute to Mismagius's influence that a benchmark for all special walls is how well they take Mismagius's Shadow Ball, and some innovations such as specially defensive Arcanine rose to prominence in part because they can take on Mismagius and live to tell the tale.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mismagius has several other viable options. The most notable is a weather set, with extra support in the form of Heal Bell. While Uxie and Mesprit are more common weather supporters, Mismagius does have a higher base Speed and access to Taunt, making it harder to stop it from setting up its desired weather effect. Mismagius gets access to Memento as well, which can get a weather sweeper in safely afterwards. Another major option is perish trapping, Misdreavus's signature set back in GSC. Although the strategy is unreliable, it can be wondrous when it works. Mismagius's high Speed lets it use Substitute to help stall out the Perish Song turns, or even play as a makeshift revenge killer with Shadow Ball. Screen support, especially Reflect, is very helpful for Perish Trap Mismagius.</p> <p>On the offensive side, Mismagius gets Energy Ball, which can be used to hit Gastrodon, Quagsire, Lanturn, and Rhyperior. It also hits Donphan hard, something especially significant because Mismagius might have to block Donphan's Rapid Spin. However, it does lose 15 Base Power compared to Thunderbolt, which is not inconsiderable. Mismagius also has access to the priority moves Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch, but with Mismagius's mere base 60 Attack, they tend to be a waste of a moveslot. Finally, Destiny Bond can buy Mismagius a surprise double KO or perhaps time to set up a Substitute, but Mismagius's other options are generally more powerful.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Although Mismagius's counters are numerous, it has enough of a movepool to defend itself against them. Spiritomb can easily switch into Mismagius and hit it with Pursuit, Sucker Punch or Shadow Sneak, but unless it has Dark Pulse it will not enjoy a skirmish with Will-O-Wisp Mismagius. Mixed Houndoom with Pursuit and Sucker Punch can trap Mismagius while not fearing Shadow Ball and Will-O-Wisp, but a predicted Hidden Power will hurt, especially if Stealth Rock is up. Mismagius is also faster and can use Substitute to scout for Sucker Punch. Specially defensive Drapion, Registeel, and Steelix all survive the best a +2 Mismagius can do and hit back, but they also need to be careful of switching into Will-O-Wisp. Clefable is bulky enough to take a +2 Hidden Power and force Mismagius out with Encore, but it is somewhat vulnerable to Taunt. Chansey cannot touch Mismagius that pack Taunt or Substitute, but it can conceivably stall Mismagius out of PP, especially if Mismagius uses Hidden Power Ground as its coverage move. Finally, although they will be maimed by the encounter, with heavy investment in Special Defense, Arcanine, Venusaur, and Torterra can take on Mismagius and come out alive.</p>",

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>This straightforward sweeping set is Mismagius's most common, and one of its most effective. High Speed and multiple immunities lets Mismagius switch in on numerous common Pokemon in UU and put up a Substitute as the opponent switches out. From there, Mismagius can either Nasty Plot and go for a sweep, or attack and switch out.</p> <p>Despite being a set that relies on pure brute force, Mismagius has a fair number of options. Nasty Plot is obvious for boosting while Shadow Ball is for equally obvious STAB, but the third move takes some consideration. Thunderbolt hits Milotic hard, but is relatively ineffective on Registeel, Clefable, and Steelix, three of Mismagius's biggest counters. Hidden Power Fighting hits the aforementioned Pokemon super effectively, and it also gives Mismagius unresisted coverage. However, all three still survive the hit, and as Hidden Power Fighting Mismagius is forced to have a 30 Speed IV, it risks losing the Speed tie to Scyther and other Mismagius. Finally, Hidden Power Ground leaves a perfect Speed IV and retains coverage on Steel-types and Drapion, but leaves Mismagius completely walled by Swellow. It's also worth noting that Mismagius needs Hidden Power Fighting to 2HKO Chansey at +6. Where Thunderbolt Mismagius can rely on the paralysis chance to break through Chansey, Hidden Power Ground Mismagius is forced to rely on critical hits.</p> <p>Life Orb can be used over Leftovers for more bite; with Stealth Rock support, a +2 Life Orb Hidden Power Fighting can potentially 2HKO Registeel. However, the Life Orb recoil will quickly wear Mismagius down, especially if Mismagius has Substitute. Taunt is an excellent alternative over Substitute, stopping status and recovery moves. Nonetheless, it does leave Mismagius highly vulnerable to Pursuit and priority. Finally, a Nasty Plot + 3 attacks set with a Life Orb offers the best coverage and considerable power, but with neither Substitute nor Taunt, it can't afford mispredictions, cannot defend itself against status, and is highly vulnerable to revenge kills. The only thing not negotiable on all variants of this set is maximum Speed: there are many nasty Pokemon in the base 95 Speed tier that Mismagius simply cannot afford to lose to.</p> <p>Mismagius's worst foes include Spiritomb, Clefable, Registeel, and Steelix. As long as they avoid Spiritomb's Will-O-Wisp, Rhyperior, Donphan, and a Steelix of your own make fine switch-ins to all these Pokemon. All three of them can set up Stealth Rock to aid Mismagius's sweep, and they complement Mismagius's low Defense stat with their mammoth physical bulk. As a bonus, Rhyperior and Steelix tend to lure in Ground and Fighting attacks that Mismagius can switch into.</p>"
      },
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>This Mismagius set aims to defeat many common leads in UU, including Uxie, Mesprit, Omastar, and Cloyster. Taunt and Will-O-Wisp allow Mismagius to function as a stallbreaker later in the match as well. Will-O-Wisp is also a valuable asset against offensive teams. Taunt, when combined with Mismagius's base 105 Speed, will often prevent the opposing lead from setting up Stealth Rock. This means that Pokemon who have a weakness to Stealth Rock can often rely on Mismagius to get them in safely. Choice Band Scyther in particular is a great partner because Mismagius not only prevents Stealth Rock, but can also cripple Pokemon that Scyther cannot beat, such as Registeel.</p> <p>Shadow Ball is a solid STAB move, and its power can allow Mismagius to run through many offensive teams. Thunderbolt does the most damage possible to bulky Water- and Flying-types like Milotic and Moltres. The EVs are simple: anything less than max Speed and you lose to a multitude of threats, such as Scyther, Manectric, and opposing Mismagius. Maximum Special Attack gives Mismagius bite, but if you need Mismagius to stay alive into the mid-game you can shift the Special Attack EVs to HP with Leftovers.</p> <p>Destiny Bond can be used over Will-O-Wisp to get a surprise KO after Mismagius is weakened. Sacrificing Mismagius for a KO can also help when an offensive or defensive Pokemon is threatening your team. Leftovers can be used over Life Orb if you want Mismagius to last longer, as it will still 2HKO most leads. However, the power is preferred in most cases. Another possible option is to run Hidden Power Ground to do more damage to Steelix, Registeel, and Aggron, but Will-O-Wisp can usually handle those threats.</p> <p>Mismagius has a lot of mid- and late-game utility. Often Mismagius can cripple its counters with Will-O-Wisp and proceed to sweep late-game once they are sufficiently weakened. Mid-game, Mismagius can also be used to punch holes in the opponent's defenses. Mismagius shares counters with Pokemon like Alakazam, so if you manage to cripple the opponent's Milotic or Spiritomb with Mismagius, they can be in trouble.</p>"

      "Stallbreaker": {
        "description": "<p>While Mismagius is most commonly seen as a potent sweeper, this set attempts to make use of its high Speed, precise support movepool, and excellent collection of immunities to turn it into a versatile utility Pokemon. Mismagius can wreak havoc against defensive Pokemon while still packing enough bulk to check offensive threats. It is the only spinblocker in UU who has both access to Taunt and the Speed to use it against common spinners, preventing them from using Foresight. Mismagius can also cause significant grief to stall teams, due to Will-O-Wisp inflicting constant damage to nearly everything while covering Mismagius's lackluster Defense, and Taunt blocking any attempt to heal or phaze. Finally, Mismagius makes a great initial switch-in to Fighting-types, although mispredicted switches into physical attacks such as Stone Edge will still pummel Mismagius.</p> <p>This Mismagius plays very differently from more offensive variants. It can actually beat several common switch-ins that expect a more offensive set, such as Registeel and defensive Spiritomb. On the other hand, it needs to tread carefully against several threats that an offensive variant could steamroll, such as Arcanine and Blaziken. Ideally, Mismagius should be brought in on a move that it is immune to, or on a weak special attack. It can then Taunt to prevent the opponent from using any status or set-up moves, after which it is free to burn the opponent and use Pain Split to heal itself after taking a few hits. If your opponent lacks powerful physical attackers that are faster than Mismagius or Pokemon that are immune to burn, you can repeat this cycle until their entire team is thoroughly weakened. Note, however, that Pain Split will very often prove unreliable; an intelligent opponent might sacrifice a low HP Pokemon just to ensure that Mismagius cannot heal. In this case, you should simply switch out to preserve Mismagius's health.</p> <p>A few changes can be made to this set while still preserving its purpose, but note that the set presented above is the most optimal for general use. Changes are not recommended unless you are certain that your team needs Mismagius to cover the specific niches mentioned below.</p> <p>The EV spread and moves can be tweaked so that this set functions more offensively. Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Fighting can be used over Pain Split with an alternate EV spread of 80 HP / 252 SpA / 176 Spe. This spread is best used on offensive teams which focus on stacking multiple layers of Spikes, as Mismagius will still serve as an excellent spinblocker against less offensively-inclined spinners while not being setup fodder for dangerous threats like Swellow and Houndoom. However, this spread is substantially frailer than the recommended spread, and the lack of Pain Split means that this version's survivability is very low compared to the primary version, particularly against stall.</p> <p>The set could also be taken in the other direction with a bulkier spread of 252 HP / 160 SpD / 96 Spe. This variant loses some power and a substantial amount of Speed for increased special bulk, allowing Mismagius to switch into more powerful special threats. Life Orb Venusaur's Leaf Storm, for instance, drops to a 3HKO (factoring in the Special Attack reduction and Leftovers), allowing Mismagius to avoid Sleep Powder via Taunt and heal with Pain Split. The Speed EVs allow Mismagius to outrun all Venusaur and anything else in the base 80 Speed group or lower. However, due to the lower Speed, faster Fighting-types such as Toxicroak and Hitmonlee can now strike first before Mismagius can burn them. Therefore, this variant should only be used with the understanding that Fighting-types are no longer dealt with as efficiently.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Why use Calm Mind when you can use Nasty Plot? The answer is the ability to set up on special attackers. For example, uninvested Uxie's Psychic will always break Mismagius's Substitute, so against Nasty Plot Mismagius, a player can sacrifice Uxie to keep Mismagius's Substitute down, and then bring in a faster Pokemon to revenge kill it. When faced with Calm Mind however, Uxie is forced to flee, and Mismagius can face whoever comes in next with a Substitute up. Any Milotic without Haze is beaten as well, and with a bit of luck even offensive powerhouses like Moltres can be set up on it if they are paralyzed. Although less immediately dangerous than the Nasty Plot set, Calm Mind Mismagius distinguishes itself by allowing Mismagius to safely set up on more UU Pokemon.</p> <p>The choice of coverage move is similar to the Nasty Plot set. Thunderbolt provides fine neutral coverage and also hits Milotic, although if Milotic does not have Haze Mismagius can happily stack Calm Minds and finish it off with Shadow Ball. Hidden Power Fighting hits Registeel, Clefable, and Steelix, but forces an imperfect Speed IV. Hidden Power Ground is primarily for Drapion, but maintains coverage on Steel-types while leaving a perfect Speed stat. However, Calm Mind's slow boosting rate means they will all easily survive and hit back. Because the allure of Calm Mind lies with keeping a Substitute intact, Taunt is not a good choice on this set, and the same applies to Life Orb.</p> <p>While Calm Mind Mismagius gains the ability to set up on a larger part of the metagame, the loss in power does make it more vulnerable to its counters. As such, a counter-to-the-counter is even more important. Once again, Donphan, Rhyperior, and Steelix are good choices. Although one can make an argument for screen support with all set-up sweepers, this Mismagius can boost its own Special Defense, so Reflect support gets a special mention to help boost Mismagius's Defense stat.</p>"
      },
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>A quick glance through Mismagius's counters reveals that, with the exception of Choice Band Spiritomb, all of them hate Trick. As Mismagius's most common set is Nasty Plot, and as Nasty Plot Mismagius is deadly enough that its counters are forced to switch in early, Mismagius can surprise the opponent with a Choice set. The fact that Mismagius has plenty of independent merit is much welcome as well: high Speed and Special Attack, in addition to three immunities, lets Mismagius hit hard, revenge kill and pull off mini-sweeps. Choice Specs Mismagius packs a lot of power with STAB Shadow Ball off over 500 Special Attack, while Choice Scarf Mismagius is actually fast enough to outspeed the slower Swift Swim users in the rain, making it a potent revenge killer.</p> <p>Ideally, Choice Mismagius will identify the other team's counters early in the game before catching them with Trick later, opening up the other team so Mismagius or another Pokemon can sweep. Mismagius is also fast enough that Trick can often be used as a last-ditch check to many set-up sweepers. Be warned, though: astute opponents can deduce Mismagius's set from the damage it deals, so Trick might not hit its intended target.</p> <p>Trick is a natural move on a Choice set, and is even more necessary because it will incapacitate many of Mismagius's normal counters. With three moves available, all three standard attacks are used, with the choice of Hidden Power once again to cover Drapion or Clefable and Chansey.</p> <p>Thanks to the multitude of Pokemon in the base 95 Speed category and below, maximum Speed is necessary on the Choice Specs set, but the Choice Scarf set can go with a Modest nature for extra power.</p> <p>Choice Mismagius can handle its normal counters to some extent, but Pokemon with Pursuit are a massive pain. There is nothing Mismagius can do about it other than to be unpredictable. For example, while Absol can survive Mismagius's Shadow Ball, it is 2HKOed by Thunderbolt. The resulting 50-50 choice between Sucker Punch or Pursuit (on Absol's part) and attacking or switching out (on Mismagius's part) at least gives Mismagius a chance of surviving. In the same vein, it might sometimes be preferable to predict the opponent switching to a Pursuit-using Pokemon and double switch. Choice Mismagius is also considerably more vulnerable to status. As such, a status absorber or a cleric can be helpful.</p>"

  "Purugly": {
    "overview": "<p>Purugly has never been successful in finding a place in the Underused tier thanks to its shallow movepool and mediocre stats. The fact that it is overshadowed by both Persian and Ambipom in almost every possible way does not bring any positives to the mixture. Nevertheless, with a Speed of 355 and access to both Fake Out and Taunt, Purugly can make a decent lead.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Due to Purugly's shallow movepool, there are few alternatives that it can utilize. Super Fang can be an option, breaking walls such as Clefable via the combined use of Taunt which disables them from recovering off lost damage. It is also a great way to deal with Pokemon that resist a majority of Purugly's moves (barring Ghost-types), nailing them for a 50% drop in their current HP. Aerial Ace accomplishes little apart from the fact that it can OHKO Heracross after Stealth Rock damage. For the most part, it is unfavorable as it deals less damage to Toxicroak than Return. Hypnosis has shaky accuracy, but it is the only method available to put opposing Pokemon to sleep, which can aid fellow teammates in their sweeping process.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Any Pokemon that resists Purugly's moves can be said to be a counter, namely Steelix and Aggron. Bulky walls such as Milotic and Donphan have no problem taking a hit from Purugly and hitting back for convincing damage. Similarly, bulky Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Hitmontop make mince meat out of Purugly. Spiritomb is another great counter because it can take all of Purugly's attacks very well while retaliating back with Dark Pulse/Hidden Power Fighting or Pursuit when it expects Purugly to U-turn out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Attacking Lead": {
        "description": "<p>With great Speed and decent offensive stats, Purugly can be utilized well as a lead. Fake Out deals early damage on the opponent, while also disabling their Focus Sash if they have one. U-turn is useful for causing some damage, and at the same time, switching Purugly out when met with something it cannot deal with. Return is the only reliable means of hitting opposing Pokemon for solid damage, nailing 2HKOes on many common sweepers such as Toxicroak, Blaziken, and Heracross. Body Slam fails to 2HKO Heracross but can be useful in possibly paralyzing other Pokemon. Taunt is what gives Purugly something to smile about. With its great Speed, Purugly can stop opposing leads from setting up entry hazards, giving your team momentum from early on in the match. Taunt is also useful for preventing bulky walls such as Chansey and Registeel from inflicting status on your team. Shadow Claw is not too favorable as it hits a very small amount of Pokemon, most of which won't be OHKOed anyway. However there are some merits to using Shadow Claw; by possessing an immunity to Ghost-type moves, Purugly can function as a check to opposing Ghost-types your team may struggle with.</p> <p>Trappers such as Spiritomb and Drapion are very beneficial to Purugly as it can U-turn when faced with a Ghost-type and allow them to destroy it. A Jolly nature is recommended as Purugly can outspeed Scyther and other base 105 Speed Pokemon. On the other hand, an Adamant nature gives it a boost in offense while still allowing Purugly to maintain a respectable Speed of 323, outspeeding base 95 Pokemon such as Arcanine and Houndoom.</p> <p>Purugly appreciates almost any Pokemon that can take hits directed upon it. Weezing and Spiritomb make great teammates as they make fine counters to Fighting-type Pokemon, easily taking any Fighting-type move and retaliating by firing off a Will-O-Wisp, hence causing the opponent to become much less of a threat. Sweepers also enjoy Purugly's company as they can attempt to sweep much easier with the opponent's wall is Taunted. Purugly isn't the type of Pokemon to sweep late-game, so removing Pokemon that counter it isn't vital. However, Steel- and Rock-types in general have a field day with Purugly, taking little damage from any of its attacks. Dugtrio can come in via a switch from U-turn and remove such threats as Registeel and Aggron handily.</p>"

Fake Out is great for rendering the opponent's Focus Sash useless as well as dealing some damage. With Taunt, Purugly stops any form of entry hazard entering the field which is vital because weather based teams appreciate coming in on full health to maximize their durability. U-turn can rack up some free damage as well as scout in case your opponent switches Pokemon, making it all the more easier for your fellow teammates to sweep. Damp Rock or Heat Rock should be your primary choice to take advantage of the extended weather.</p> <p>Entry hazards make it easier for Purugly's weather partners to more comfortably revenge kill and wreak havoc. Although unreliable, Hypnosis can be used instead of Taunt to put the foe to sleep, allowing Purugly to set up, switch, and let a teammate set up or start sweeping right of the bat.</p>"

  "Skuntank": {
    "overview": "<p>Skuntank is often overlooked in favor of its more defensive Dark / Poison counterpart, Drapion, or more powerful Dark-types like Absol. However, Skuntank has a few unique qualities that set it apart, most notably its access to Explosion and an odd but awesome Speed stat. With base 103 HP, Skuntank also lacks the utter frailty of the other offensively oriented Dark-types in UU. Then when Skuntank does go down, its ability, Aftermath, does 25% damage to the attacking Pokemon if it KOed Skuntank with a contact attack. These factors, coupled with Skuntank's neutrality to the Fighting-type attacks commonly carried by fragile Psychic- and Ghost-types, allow it to reliably switch in on and KO these Pokemon. Skuntank's ability to absorb Toxic Spikes, take down faster threats with Sucker Punch, and explode on enemy walls makes it a useful and unique addition to any UU team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Blast, with a Rash or Mild nature, Life Orb, and at least 100 Special Attack EVs 2HKOes Aggron and Steelix. While Registeel is still only 3HKOed, Fire Blast prevents Skuntank from being wholly walled by Steel-types without using Explosion. Hidden Power Ground can be used on either set specifically for Aggron, as it deals 96.8% - 113.9% even with a hindering nature. However, sacrificing a moveslot for one Pokemon is not recommended. Screech can replace any move other than Pursuit on the sets since, as Screech will be causing switches, it makes a wonderful combo alongside Pursuit. Rock Smash can be used with Screech to deal heavy damage to Rock- and Steel-types like Aggron but has little use otherwise, and Fire Blast generally does more damage. Night Slash has a high critical hit rate, but Sucker Punch and Crunch are more reliable forms of STAB. The low PP attack Punishment is in the same boat but can be useful if you worried about running into a Calm Mind Spiritomb or Calm Mind Uxie.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Countering Skuntank is difficult, since Explosion can take most potential counters down with it. Registeel is generally a good switch-in, resisting almost everything Skuntank has except for a Life Orb Fire Blast, which fails to 3HKO the standard variant. Weezing is in the same position as Registeel and can retaliate back with Thunderbolt, Will-O-Wisp, and Pain Split (which benefits from Skuntank's high HP stat). Rhyperior has massive defenses and can freely set up on any Skuntank set. All of the aforementioned Pokemon are severely crippled by a Life Orb Explosion, however. Spiritomb takes paltry damage from most of Skuntank's moves and can burn Skuntank while being immune to Explosion; however, it loses to Taunt variants. Houndoom is faster than Skuntank and can come in on a predicted Sucker Punch and proceed to either incinerate Skuntank with Fire Blast or set up with Nasty Plot. Drapion is also faster than Skuntank and has access to Earthquake (which is unaffected by Aftermath), more often than not gaining free turns to set up. Anything faster than Skuntank that can survive a Sucker Punch is a good candidate to beat it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trapper": {
        "description": "<p>With above average offensive stats and respectable Speed, Skuntank makes excellent use of Taunt. Combine this with its excellent typing and Pursuit, and you have a superb trapper on your hands. This set can be used as an effective way to get rid of spinblockers such as Rotom, Mismagius, and Spiritomb, while also dismantling walls with the help of Taunt. Common sweepers such as specially offensive Venusaur and Absol are stopped right in their tracks, unable to set up or use status inducing moves. Although Skuntank has a relatively shallow movepool it does have access to Explosion, giving more reason than ever to use it over other Dark-types such as Drapion or Spiritomb. It is best to use Explosion as a last resort, usually after you've seen the opponent's entire team and have gotten rid of their spinblocker. Sucker Punch is the primary choice in the fourth slot, giving Skuntank priority to use against fragile faster sweepers such as Moltres, Manectric, and Scyther. Pokemon with Substitute such as Alakazam are easily defeated with this set. Going for Pursuit first usually causes the opponent to stay in, either to play it safe or to at least get some damage on Skuntank, which means that you can use Sucker Punch on the following turn to catch them off-guard. Crunch is a secondary option if you prefer not to take chances with Sucker Punch. It is recommended to use a Jolly nature if you use Crunch in the 4th slot. The EVs are straightforward, giving Skuntank all the offensive power and Speed it can get.</p> <p>Although usually considered an offensive, fragile Pokemon, Skuntank can also utilize bulky spreads with great success. An option would be to change the EV spread to 24 HP / 232 Atk / 252 SpD with an Adamant nature, which still allows Skuntank to net an OHKO on Alakazam with Sucker Punch without it switching, while also being able to survive Focus Blast from Life Orb variants. Since you no longer outspeed base 80 Speed sweepers, Sucker Punch should definitely be used over Crunch. Life Orb Mismagius fails to OHKO you with +2 Thunderbolt even with the presence of Stealth Rock and you can land a 2HKO with Pursuit + Sucker Punch (assuming it doesn't switch out). An Adamant nature is highly recommended as it allows Skuntank to be able to hit hard while having a respectable amount of bulk.</p> <p>Despite Skuntank being a major threat to a wide variety of Pokemon, it also has a respectable number of counters. Steel- and Rock-types such as Steelix, Rhyperior, and Aggron wall this set all day, taking little damage even from Explosion. Bulky walls such as Donphan and Tangrowth can deal with Skuntank as long as they avoid getting hit by Explosion. Water-types such as Milotic and Blastoise make ideal teammates for Skuntank, being able to deal with most of its counters and luring in other bulky walls for Skuntank to play with. Claydol is probably the best possible ally that Skuntank can hope for, since it is immune to Skuntank's single weakness and lures in Ghost-types for Skuntank to dispose of. Claydol also deals with Fighting- and Steel-types reliably that normally carry Ground-type attacks to easily dispose of Skuntank. Dugtrio is another good teammate to easily bypass Registeel and other Steel-types. Finally, Mismagius makes a great partner as it can absorb any stray Fighting- and Ground-type attacks aimed at Skuntank and use the free switch to set up. In return, Skuntank can dispose of enemy Ghost-types and eliminate Chansey.</p>"
      },
      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<p>Taking advantage of Skuntank's STAB attacks and Explosion, this set aims to break down walls while simultaneously working as a quasi-tank. Sucker Punch deals massive damage to faster, fragile Pokemon that dare attack Skuntank; in many cases, it allows Skuntank to revenge kill a Pokemon that is attempting to sweep your team, such as Mismagius, Alakazam, or Sceptile. Skuntank is one of only two Dark-types that get Explosion (the other being Shiftry), which complements Skuntank's Dark-type STAB perfectly since few Ghost-types will be willing to switch into Skuntank for fear of getting hit by a super effective Crunch. Poison Jab is Skuntank's secondary STAB attack, and it does not require the opponent to attack in order to work. While Poison-type attacks have relatively poor super effective coverage, they do provide great neutral coverage. Poison Jab is useful for keeping common Fighting-types at bay, such as Blaziken, Hitmontop, and Hitmonlee. Crunch is used in the last slot as a reliable secondary STAB and for the number of Ghost-types likely to use Substitute, such as Rotom. Pursuit can also be used in the last slot and makes a death trap for fragile Psychic- and Ghost-types that are unable to switch out without being KOed. Return is mostly for dealing damage to enemy Skuntank and Toxicroak that resist Skuntank's STAB attacks.</p> <p>Skuntank sits in a rather unique speed tier, so maximizing its Speed with a Jolly nature is highly recommended. In doing so, Skuntank is able to outspeed various threats of the UU tier, including Venusaur, Blaziken, and Adamant Arcanine.</p> <p>Rather than attempting to sweep, this set aims to eliminate problematic walls in order to set up a sweep by a teammate. The main idea is to switch in on various threats, such as Alakazam, Mismagius, and Rotom, and fire off Poison Jab or Crunch to scout your opponent's switch-in. Steel-types completely wall this set, so it is ideal that your team has Pokemon that pack strong Fire-, Fighting- or Ground-type attacks. Moltres is an excellent partner, as it boasts STAB on its powerful Fire Blast and is immune to Skuntank's only weakness, Ground-type attacks. Dugtrio makes an excellent partner as well for its ability to safely remove Registeel and Chansey without worrying about being crippled by Thunder Wave. Many Rock- and Ground-types, such as Donphan and Rhyperior, have the defenses to weather Skuntank's moves, even if they risk being poisoned by Poison Jab. Claydol can switch into these Pokemon thanks to its immunity to Ground-type attacks and eliminate those Ground-types with Ice Beam. In return, Skuntank removes Claydol's Ghost-, Dark-, and Grass-type foes. Water-types such as Milotic and Blastoise can also eliminate problematic Rock-types, while Skuntank destroys Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Leafeon in return.</p> <p>Once Pokemon that resist or are immune to Explosion are removed, Skuntank is free to switch in on its selected victim and unleash all hell with its Life Orb boosted Explosion. The idea is to select a victim that would normally wall Skuntank's sweeping partner. Good candidates to explode on include Weezing, Miltank, and Milotic. Once those problematic Pokemon have been removed, good candidates to sweep the opposition include Swellow, Hitmonlee, and Torterra. A word to the wise: do not use Explosion unless you are absolutely sure the opponent's Ghost-types have been fully removed; otherwise, if they switch in at the wrong time, Skuntank's sacrifice will have been in vain.</p>"

  "Chatot": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Chatot may appear to be another throwaway joke Pokemon in the vein of Farfetch'd and Delibird, but a closer look reveals some pleasant surprises: base 91 Speed makes Chatot faster than many of UU's biggest threats, and with Nasty Plot to boost its respectable Special Attack, Chatot can become a legitimate offensive threat. It can't take a hit to save its life and needs major support to succeed, but don't underestimate this musical bird.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Chatot's movepool is rather barren; the only worthwhile attacks not already mentioned are other types of Hidden Power. Hidden Power Water provides perfect neutral coverage with Hyper Voice if Chatot is only using two attacks, but it is significantly less powerful than Heat Wave against Steel- and Ghost-types. Hidden Power Ground hits both Rock- and Steel-types, and is Chatot's best option against Aggron.</p> <p>Substitute or Taunt can be used with Nasty Plot to protect Chatot from status, although neither is capable of generating free turns as reliably as Encore. Agility is an alternative boosting move, but Chatot's Speed is already very respectable, so boosting Chatot's power with Nasty Plot is generally more important. Feather Dance and Roost are nice moves on defensive Pokemon, but Chatot doesn't have nearly enough bulk to use them effectively. Tailwind would be a cool support move if it lasted longer, but with only two exploitable turns, it is essentially an inferior Agility. Sing can put a counter to sleep and give Chatot a free turn to set up, but its terrible accuracy makes it a huge risk that Chatot can rarely afford to take.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Unfortunately, Chatot is so frail that any faster Pokemon it can't OHKO is essentially a counter. Mismagius is immune to Hyper Voice, can survive a Nasty Plot-boosted Heat Wave, and easily OHKOes Chatot with Thunderbolt. Choice Band Spiritomb can do the same with Sucker Punch, although it must beware of Chatot Encoring and then setting up on Sucker Punch. Though rare, Life Orb Electrode can switch in on Hyper Voice freely thanks to Soundproof and wreck Chatot with its STAB Thunderbolt. Arcanine, Scyther, Sceptile, and any other offensive Pokemon that hits 310 Speed or above can come in as Chatot sets up and OHKO it before it gets the chance to attack. Chansey walls Chatot's attacks easily, but it must beware of being turned into set-up bait by Encore. Stealth Rock makes Chatot even easier to take down; after switching into Stealth Rock once, Chatot can be OHKOed by even neutral STAB attacks from defensive Pokemon.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Chatot may not look like much of a threat, but if it manages to obtain a Nasty Plot boost, it will be dishing out some serious damage. A boosted STAB Hyper Voice will OHKO most offensive Pokemon, including Life Orb Venusaur and Arcanine, while 2HKOing even special walls such as Milotic and Clefable. Heat Wave provides solid coverage, hitting most of the Ghost- and Steel-types that resist Hyper Voice for at least a 2HKO after a boost. Encore is recommended in the last slot to help Chatot set up, as the frail bird will otherwise have difficulty finding an opportunity to use Nasty Plot. Hidden Power Grass is an alternative to hit Rock-types such as Rhyperior, Kabutops, and Omastar for 4x super effective damage, but it's usually unnecessary, as all three are 2HKOed by boosted Hyper Voice anyway.</p> <p>The EVs are standard for a special sweeper, maximizing Chatot's offensive potential. A Timid nature is absolutely required, as Chatot simply cannot afford to take a hit; without the extra Speed, Chatot will be outsped and easily OHKOed by positive-natured base 80s such as Venusaur and Blaziken. Since Chatot is so frail, any Pokemon with higher Speed or a powerful priority attack can switch in as Chatot boosts and KO it immediately afterward. Therefore, it is essential that such Pokemon are taken care of before Chatot attempts to sweep. Dugtrio can trap and KO opposing sweepers, as well as the Steel- and Rock-types that resist Hyper Voice. Spiritomb and Drapion can use Pursuit to eliminate Alakazam, Mismagius, and Rotom. Many of UU's fastest Pokemon are weak to Stealth Rock, so simply setting it up will prevent them from repeatedly switching in on Chatot. Plenty of Pokemon have access to Stealth Rock, but Omastar is perhaps the best option; not only does it have access to multiple types of entry hazards, but it also lures in Ground-type attacks that Chatot can switch in on and Encore for a free turn.</p>"

Choice Specs boosts Chatot's decent Special Attack stat to an excellent 424, whereas a Choice Scarf makes it faster than any unboosted Pokemon in UU.

Heat Wave fries the Steel- and Ghost-types that resist Hyper Voice, while Hidden Power Grass rounds out the coverage by hitting Rock-types hard. In the last slot, U-turn is always a useful move on a Choice set to scout for counters and maintain momentum, although it won't be doing much damage off Chatot's pathetic Attack stat. If U-turn doesn't appeal to you, Chatot's signature move, Chatter, is also an option; although its low Base Power is disappointing, it hits Fighting-types harder than Chatot's other moves and packs a handy 31% confusion rate.</p> <p>With Choice Specs, a Timid nature is essential in order to outspeed the abundant threats between base 80 and 90 Speed. Modest becomes more viable when using a Choice Scarf, but even then Timid is still recommended to beat other Choice Scarf Pokemon. Rapid Spin support is critical for this set, as Chatot will want to switch in and out several times during the match; if Stealth Rock is up, it will greatly limit Chatot's freedom to do so. Hitmontop and Donphan are both reliable spinners that can defeat Ghost-type spinblockers, removing both Stealth Rock and the Pokemon that are immune to Hyper Voice. Donphan can also set up its own Stealth Rock, which Chatot greatly appreciates due to this set's lack of power.</p>"

  "Spiritomb": {
    "overview": "<p>One of the most prominent and useful Pokemon in the Underused metagame, Spiritomb should by no means be underestimated. He is arguably the best counter to Ghost-, Psychic-, and Fighting-type Pokemon in the metagame, and he is the only one who can successfully check all of them at the same time. Additionally, he is a fantastic spinblocker; while Mismagius and Rotom have an arguably better ability in Levitate, he more than makes up for this imperfection with his better overall defenses, wide array of immunities, and access to priority moves. Unfortunately, this collection of spirits has his fair share of faults. His lack of an instant recovery move and Levitate makes him somewhat easy to wear down, and though he has a plethora of immunities, he has no other resistances to switch in on. Furthermore, Spiritomb's offensive coverage is depressingly small; other than Dark- and Ghost-type attacks, which offer rather redundant coverage, he has very few attacking options. All in all, Spiritomb is undoubtedly one of the most useful defensive Pokemon in the metagame, as his ability to single-handedly counter most Ghost-, Psychic-, and Fighting-type Pokemon in the metagame is undeniably appreciated by many teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Spiritomb's movepool is pitifully precise, and as such, there are few other options that he can use. Spiritomb has a variety of PP draining moves, such as Grudge and Spite, which can quickly stall out an opposing Pokemon's PP alongside Pressure. However, these are usually a gimmicky option, as draining the opponent of PP is not really an optimal way to take down a Pokemon. Spiritomb also has self-sacrifice moves such as Destiny Bond, Memento, and the aforementioned Grudge, but Spiritomb doesn't make a good user of these moves due to his poor Speed and good defenses. Alternative status-inducing moves such as Hypnosis and Confuse Ray are interesting, but they're typically worse than Will-O-Wisp in the long run. Spiritomb does have Nasty Plot to boost his Special Attack quickly and sweep, but his pathetic Speed undermines this attempt.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Spiritomb's varied sets can make him somewhat difficult to counter, but all the same, the general idea against him is to slowly wear him down, whether via status or simply by moderately strong attacks. Since Spiritomb does not have reliable recovery, only immunities and no resistances, and is prone to every type of entry hazard, he can be worn down more easily than you might expect. Eventually, unless Spiritomb possesses Rest, he will faint. On the occasions that Spiritomb does carry Rest, Pokemon with Taunt or Substitute will usually do well, as Spiritomb will usually have only one fairly weak offensive move in these cases. For example, Substitute Aggron can easily set up a Substitute against Spiritomb and proceed to demolish with Head Smash. Opposing RestTalkers can also take advantage of Spiritomb's tendency to lack offensive power to proceed to set up and rip through the team. Entry hazards are also useful, and Pokemon who can set them up, such as Omastar, Cacturne, and Roselia, will have no problems setting them up against Spiritomb.</p> <p>As far as specific Pokemon go, Houndoom and Blaziken are by far the best counters. Houndoom is resistant to both of Spiritomb's STAB moves, benefits from Will-O-Wisp, can strike Spiritomb hard with Fire Blasts, and only has to fear the rare Hidden Power Fighting or Ground. Blaziken has a resistance to Dark-type attacks and is immune to Will-O-Wisp, which gives him plenty of opportunities to switch in and hit Spiritomb hard. However, it should be noted that Blaziken must be wary of switching into Psychic, as it will easily take a large chunk out of his health. Similarly, other Dark-types such as Drapion and Absol work well, though they must be wary of switching into Will-O-Wisp. On the flip side, bulky Fire-types do decently, being immune to Will-O-Wisp and taking neutral damage from the rest of Spiritomb's attacks bar Hidden Power Ground. Arcanine is the best option out of these, with access to Morning Sun to heal himself and a strong Flare Blitz to strike Spiritomb with. Bulky Pokemon in general, such as Registeel, Clefable, Chansey, and Milotic, also tend to wall Spiritomb, as he usually lacks enough power to beat them, and they can simply stall him out with Toxic or boost up alongside him.</p>",

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Taking advantage of Spiritomb's various immunities and fantastic defenses, this set is arguably the best check to Ghost- and Psychic-types in the metagame. With Pursuit to trap the aforementioned Pokemon, in addition to Shadow Sneak to quickly dispatch them should they stay in, Spiritomb forces opponents into a dangerous guessing game. Furthermore, Spiritomb isn't limited to checking Ghost- and Psychic-types; depending on the move used in the third slot, Spiritomb can check even more Pokemon thanks to his lack of weaknesses. This set is even usable in the lead position due to its ability to trap common leads such as Ambipom, Uxie, Mesprit, and Alakazam. Despite the poor type coverage this set possesses, Spiritomb isn't really hindered much, because this set is simply designed to check a variety of Pokemon rather than attempt to severely damage teams.</p> <p>Shadow Sneak gives Spiritomb priority and is useful for finishing off faster Pokemon who are weak to it. However, Sucker Punch is a viable option if Shadow Sneak ends up doing too little damage for your tastes; note, however, that it's much easier for the opponent to set up on Sucker Punch should you predict poorly. Pursuit traps and removes Ghost- and Psychic-types; the former is especially important, since removing Ghost-types makes it much easier to spin away entry hazards. With Psychic, Spiritomb can also counter Fighting-types, as they typically lack a means of damaging Spiritomb severely. In particular, it nails Toxicroak, who is usually bulky enough to take Shadow Sneak and Dark Pulse, as well as Blaziken, who tends to attempt to switch into Dark Pulse. Spiritomb is also capable of beating weakened Life Orb Venusaur one-on-one with Psychic and Shadow Sneak (assuming Sleep Clause is active). Dark Pulse is a reliable attack to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types harder than Shadow Sneak or Pursuit, should they stay in, and Ghost-types with Will-O-Wisp can't cut its power by burning Spiritomb. However, should you use an attack other than Psychic in the third slot, Shadow Ball becomes a better option to retain the ability to hit Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon for super effective damage while simultaneously striking Fighting-types for neutral damage.</p> <p>Since most Ghost- and Psychic-types are specially based, Spiritomb's EVs are focused on his Special Defense stat. A Sassy nature keeps both Spiritomb's physical and special attacks reasonably strong, at the cost of Spiritomb's already poor Speed. Furthermore, investment in Special Defense allows Spiritomb to take on some strong special attackers such as Blaziken and Venusaur with reasonable success, though it should be noted that Spiritomb shouldn't be your only check to these Pokemon, as his lack of instant recovery makes him easy to weaken. You may also shift some EVs from Special Defense to Defense should you want Spiritomb to be able to take on physical Fighting-types and some other Pokemon more easily; however, this will cause Spiritomb to be much easier to wear down on the special side.</p> <p>There are a few options that this set can use to check some other threats that you might find deadly for your team. Instead of Dark Pulse, you may opt to use Rest to give Spiritomb a form of recovery. Rest is also necessary should you use Spiritomb on a stall team, as Spiritomb needs it to survive throughout the match to continually spinblock. However, if Rest is used, a cleric is necessary, as Spiritomb is otherwise a veritable sitting duck for two turns whenever he uses it. Pain Split is another option for recovery, but it's extremely unreliable, which makes it a lesser choice. Will-O-Wisp is also an option to cripple Pokemon and make the opponent wary of attacking Spiritomb from the physical side. Spiritomb can also use Hidden Power to prevent Dark-types from setting up on him; Hidden Power Ground nails Drapion and Houndoom for reasonable damage, while Hidden Power Fighting hits Absol and Houndoom but misses out on Drapion.</p> <p>When using this Spiritomb, prediction is key to prevent him from being inflicted with unwanted statuses and taking tons of damage. Ideally, scouting before recklessly sending out Spiritomb is ideal; even simply setting up Stealth Rock to see if the opposing Pokemon have Leftovers or not can determine if they have Substitute or Will-O-Wisp. If a lack of Leftovers shows, then it is usually safe to switch Spiritomb in to trap and KO the Ghost-type. However, should the Ghost-type carry Substitute or Will-O-Wisp, choosing between Dark Pulse, Shadow Sneak, and Pursuit is an important decision. It should be noted that Pursuit will only do approximately 50% to frail Rotom and Mismagius if they stay in, and the same for Shadow Sneak, making Shadow Sneak a poor choice when the opponent is above 50%. Dark Pulse should be used if you feel that the opponent will stay in while they're above the mentioned 50% mark, or if you predict that they will use Will-O-Wisp. On the other hand, Pursuit is usually a good choice to guarantee that the Ghost-type Pokemon will be removed, but against healthy opponents, it might not be optimal to spam since if they stay in and attack, Spiritomb will take plenty of damage and you'll be forced to make another choice between Pursuit and Shadow Sneak on the following turn.</p> <p>Spiritomb's main counters tend to be Dark- and Fighting-types; with the former only fearing the rare Hidden Power Fighting and Will-O-Wisp. However, should Spiritomb use either of those, he will often lack Psychic, making him weak against Fighting-types such as Hariyama, Blaziken, and Substitute Toxicroak. Hitmontop makes a great partner, as he can take out most Dark-types with few issues, and he deals with Clefable who can give Spiritomb some major issues. Weezing can make an excellent counter against troublesome Fighting-types thanks to his enormous Defense stat; he also has the ability to beat Torterra and Rhyperior, who pose a huge threat should Spiritomb lack Will-O-Wisp. Arcanine can be used for a similar purpose with an added ability to absorb Will-O-Wisps that opponents fire at Spiritomb. Milotic has merits in checking the likes of Rhyperior and various other threats, in addition to boasting a way to defeat boosting sweepers and other bulky Pokemon. These two Pokemon also form a part of the Fire / Water / Grass core that Spiritomb works well with. The Water / Grass part of the core is also extremely useful in dealing with Rain Dance teams, who Spiritomb is often a hindrance against. Dugtrio can also be an issue if Spiritomb is weakened; however, Dugtrio himself is so frail that Spiritomb should be able to dispose of him with priority attacks if Dugtrio has taken some prior damage. Clefable and Chansey can supply Spiritomb with cleric and Wish support, which helps alleviate Spiritomb's lack of recovery, while Spiritomb is immune to the Fighting-type attacks that pose huge annoyances to them. Rapid Spinners are also useful to remove troublesome entry hazards that can eat away at Spiritomb's health. Furthermore, these Pokemon can help Spiritomb deal with stall teams, which he has issues with due to his lack of both reliable recovery and offensive competence.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Spiritomb packs quite a bit of power while still serving as as a decent revenge killer and a marvelous check to frail Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Alakazam, Mismagius, and Rotom. Furthermore, it puts heavy pressure on the opponent to predict perfectly, as each of Spiritomb's moves can be devastating if they make the wrong choice.</p> <p>Pursuit and Shadow Sneak form the crux of Spiritomb's revenge-killing abilities. With both of these moves in tandem, Spiritomb can put the opponent in a pinch, as they must choose between switching out and risk taking a powerful Pursuit, or staying in and risk getting smashed by Shadow Sneak. Furthermore, with Sucker Punch in Spiritomb's arsenal, it's even harder for the opponent to attempt to stay in and attack. However, it should be noted that Sucker Punch must be used sparingly unless Spiritomb has already Tricked away his Choice Band; Sucker Punch is one of the worst attacks to be locked into, and every set-up sweeper can take advantage of it with ease. Trick allows Spiritomb to remove his Choice Band if necessary, while simultaneously crippling one of the opponent's defensive Pokemon. Spiritomb may also use Return over one of the moves on this set, as it's his strongest move outside of Sucker Punch, and it can hit switch-ins such as Milotic and Fighting-types harder than any of Spiritomb's other moves.</p> <p>With the given EVs, Spiritomb becomes as strong as possible, while gaining some extra bulk to ease switching in. Due to Spiritomb's pathetic Speed stat, Speed investment is simply unnecessary and pointless. You may opt to use a more defensive spread to give Spiritomb some extra bulk, but Spiritomb usually needs all the power he can muster to make his low Base Power moves as strong as possible. Despite this, a bulkier spread goes a long way in giving Spiritomb more opportunities to switch in and destroy Pokemon who are weak to Dark- and Ghost-type attacks. Should you opt for a bulkier spread, making Spiritomb more specially defensive is generally the better option, as Spiritomb can take on most specially oriented Pokemon more easily than physical ones.</p> <p>Spiritomb is a fantastic partner to Rapid Spinners such as Donphan, Kabutops, and Hitmontop; these Pokemon lure in Ghost-type Pokemon who Spiritomb can dispatch with ease, allowing the Rapid Spinners to remove entry hazards without many issues. Pokemon who benefit from the removal of entry hazards, such as Scyther and Moltres, work well alongside this combination, as both Pokemon are significantly more proficient with a clear field. This makes Spiritomb extremely effective on offensive teams, as his ability to make Rapid Spinning significantly easier is appreciated on these types of teams, where most Pokemon are frail and cannot afford entry hazards chipping away at their health. Furthermore, Spiritomb can trap frail revenge-killers on the opposing team, which helps prevent Spiritomb's partners from having their attempted sweeps stopped right in their tracks.</p> <p>Spiritomb tends to have issues with bulky Pokemon who don't really mind a Choice Band. Rhyperior, Hariyama, and Torterra are examples of such Pokemon, though it should be noted that it isn't likely that these Pokemon will switch into Spiritomb often, as most of them fear Will-O-Wisp. The aforementioned Rapid Spinners, Hitmontop and Donphan, work well in dealing with these Pokemon since their physical bulk is extraordinary, allowing them to weather the hits that these Pokemon may fire back after being Tricked a Choice Band. Physically defensive Venusaur also works well thanks to his resistances to Fighting- and Grass-type attacks and ability to retaliate with a strong Grass Knot. Walls such as Registeel and Clefable will have no problems taking Spiritomb's attacks, but they won't really like being Tricked a Choice Band.</p>"
      },
      "All-Out Attacker (Lead)": {
        "description": "<p>Spiritomb is a superb choice for a lead, as he matches up well against common leads such as Ambipom, Uxie, Mesprit, Alakazam, and Mismagius. Spiritomb has the ability to 2HKO many Spikes leads, though since he's so slow, they will often get at least two layers of entry hazards up. This set is slightly more aggressive than the other sets because its main purpose is to deal immediate damage early in the match. Spiritomb is quite versatile in terms of attacking with both physical and special attacks, meaning he will usually pose a huge problem for the opposing team early in the match. Furthermore, Spiritomb boasts great typing and good bulk, making him a difficult Pokemon to take down.</p> <p>Shadow Ball hits remarkably hard and can 2HKO many common leads in UU. Hidden Power Fighting gives Spiritomb perfect coverage, as it hits Normal- and Steel-types for super effective damage. Hidden Power Rock could replace Hidden Power Fighting in order to hit common leads such as Swellow and Moltres. Shadow Sneak is an absolute must in the third slot, as it prevents Alakazam and Mismagius from having an easy sweep. The final slot is a toss-up between Pursuit and Sucker Punch. Pursuit lets Spiritomb trap and OHKO Ghost- and Psychic-types, such as the aforementioned Alakazam and Mismagius. However, Sucker Punch is a decent alternative in order to strike faster Pokemon in tight situations for much more damage than Shadow Sneak could muster. With either Sucker Punch or Pursuit in his arsenal, Ambipom and Uxie will have to think twice before using U-turn on Spiritomb.</p> <ul> <li>Shadow Ball vs. 252 / 4 Uxie: 58.19% - 69.49%</li> <li>Shadow Ball vs. 252 / 0 Alakazam: 95.54% - 112.7%</li> <li>Shadow Ball vs. 252 / 4 Omastar: 50.87% - 60.17%</li> <li>Shadow Ball vs. 252 / 96 Cloyster: 67.11% - 79.28%</li> <li>Shadow Ball vs. 252 / 0 Spiritomb: 40.46 - 47.70%</li> <li>Shadow Ball vs. 192 / 0 Arcanine: 42.55% - 50.41%</li> <li>Shadow Ball vs. 252 / 0 Donphan: 51.04% - 60.42%</li> </ul> <p>The EVs are tailored to provide strong damage output physically and specially. With 244 HP EVs, Spiritomb will always survive Moltres's Life Orb Fire Blast at full health. 12 Speed EVs allow Spiritomb to outpace Steelix and Slowbro. Spooky Plate is required over Expert Belt because Spiritomb will use Shadow Ball on the common leads and needs the consistent 20% boost.</p> <p>Chansey, Registeel, and Clefable can handle hits from Spiritomb without breaking a sweat. As such, Blaziken and Hitmontop make great partners, since both have access to super effective STAB attacks to take them down. Additionally, Hitmontop can use Rapid Spin, which Spiritomb appreciates since he can't stop entry hazard leads from setting up. Without Hidden Power Rock, Spiritomb will also have his share of difficulties with Swellow. Defensively, Steelix and Regirock make excellent partners to provide Flying-type resistance and Stealth Rock support. Entry hazard users of your own will be appreciated, as Spiritomb will not set up hazards for your team. Furthermore, Spiritomb can block Rapid Spin from removing those hazards, and he can hit the common Rapid Spinners, Hitmontop, Blastoise, and Donphan, on their less invested defensive stat for plenty of damage.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Spiritomb's lack of recovery can often be a massive thorn in his side, as it makes it so much easier to wear him down. However, the combination of Rest and Sleep Talk remedies this problem to some degree. Unfortunately, Rest and Sleep Talk do take up two moveslots, which limits Spiritomb's coverage and makes it much easier for opposing Pokemon to deal with him. Will-O-Wisp does help in this regard to cripple most physical attackers, but with only it and Dark Pulse, as well as the overall unreliability of Sleep Talk, Spiritomb can become a liability against sweepers such as Houndoom. Nonetheless, should you wish to use Spiritomb on a dedicated stall team, this set fits perfectly to allow Spiritomb to keep spinblocking and weathering hits throughout a match.</p> <p>With the given EVs, Spiritomb has excellent overall bulk, with a slight emphasis on Special Defense. With Will-O-Wisp to further weaken attacks that threaten Spiritomb physically, he can be a tough Pokemon to break. If you wish, swapping all those Defense EVs into Special Defense is a alternative to maximize Spiritomb's special bulk; this is useful should you find that Spiritomb needs to be as specially bulky as possible, or if he can find enough opportunities to patch up his Defense with Will-O-Wisp. However, for the most part, the recommended EV spread is more useful, as Spiritomb's poor Speed makes it difficult to use Will-O-Wisp before the opponent attacks him, and many Rapid Spinners are physically based, which makes having no investment in Defense unwise.</p> <p>Since many stall teams focus primarily on status, entry hazards, and phazing in order to win, taking down that last Pokemon may be difficult for your team. A Pokemon such as Curse + Rest Registeel can be a nightmare for stall teams, since it takes negligible damage from entry hazards, cannot be infected with Toxic poison--or any other status for very long, due to Rest-- and cannot be phazed out, since it is the last Pokemon your opponent has. Taking down Registeel may seem impossible for such a team, but by replacing Sleep Talk with Curse, Spiritomb can create a secondary status effect that will soundly KO Registeel. While this does force Spiritomb to be essentially useless for two turns when he uses Rest, this issue can be alleviated by having a cleric on your team. You can also replace Sleep Talk with Psychic to deal with Toxicroak and other Fighting-types, or you can replace Dark Pulse and either Sleep Talk or Will-O-Wisp for Shadow Ball and Hidden Power Fighting for perfect coverage.</p> <p>Due to this set's defensive nature, other defensive teammates such as Milotic, Weezing, Arcanine, and Venusaur work well. As usual, the Fire / Water / Grass core meshes well with Spiritomb, due to its excellent type synergy with him. As far as Water-types go, Omastar and Cloyster are particularly good for their ability to set up entry hazards, which Spiritomb can prevent from being removed. Chansey and Clefable also work well, being able to take on specially offensive threats, while Spiritomb can defeat troublesome Fighting-types in return. Chansey and Clefable are also able to cure Spiritomb of his sleep status when the need arises, and they can also provide Wish support to heal him when he doesn't have the opportunity to Rest. Weezing can take on physically offensive threats, but struggles with specially oriented Psychic-types, all of whom Spiritomb has no issues dealing with. These three aforementioned Pokemon have great synergy with Spiritomb on stall teams, and they can form an extremely difficult core to beat.</p>"
      },
      "Mono-Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Spiritomb's lack of weaknesses to target, in addition to a STAB move that nothing is completely immune to, he makes a surprisingly good boosting sweeper that becomes difficult to counter with anything other than specialized counters such as Haze Milotic and Curse Registeel. Furthermore, after a single Calm Mind, Spiritomb possesses absurd defenses that become extremely difficult to break as more and more boosts are accumulated, barring an unlucky critical hit. Additionally, because of Spiritomb's slew of immunities, setting up a ton of Calm Minds isn't a difficult task. This set works extremely well as a late game sweeper, as once you've removed the opponent's specialized counters, Spiritomb will become exceedingly difficult to stop.</p> <p>Rest and Sleep Talk form an excellent means of recovery for Spiritomb, allowing him to cure himself of status and damage while not being a liability as he sleeps. With Spiritomb's bulk, Pressure, and Rest, it's also possible to stall out some low PP attacks that could severely harm Spiritomb. Calm Mind boosts Spiritomb's Special Defense to extraordinary levels after just one boost, and can quickly make him quite a threat after a few boosts. Dark Pulse acts as Spiritomb's reliable offensive attack, as nothing is fully immune to it, and it has decent neutral coverage. However, Shadow Ball is also an option over Dark Pulse should you find bulky Fighting-types troublesome, but this will cause Spiritomb to be utterly walled by every Normal-type in the tier. Hidden Power Fighting is also an option over Sleep Talk should you find the added coverage necessary, but this isn't really recommended since leaving Spiritomb completely useless for two turns of Rest is not desirable.</p> <p>This set is tailored to be physically defensive, since Calm Mind will patch up Spiritomb's uninvested Special Defense as he boosts up. As Spiritomb continues to accumulate boosts, the opponent will likely attempt to attack Spiritomb's stat that isn't being continually boosted--his Defense--therefore making a physically defensive EV investment useful. Furthermore, this also allows Spiritomb to take on some physically offensive Pokemon earlier in the match, which gives him some extra use outside of a late game sweeper. However, a slight shift of Defense EVs into Special Defense is viable to make it slightly easier for Spiritomb to set up on special attackers immediately; just keep in mind that the more EVs you take away from Defense, the easier it is to take down Spiritomb with attacks on his unboosted Defense stat.</p> <p>Entry hazards, particularly Toxic Spikes, are useful to wear down many of this set's counters. Pokemon such as Haze Milotic will eventually succumb to the effects of Toxic poison, giving Spiritomb the opportunity to sweep. Other hazards, such as Stealth Rock and Spikes, are also useful to wear down walls who lack reliable recovery. Omastar is a fantastic Pokemon to set up entry hazards with, having access to all three forms of hazards and possessing great Defense. Fortunately, due to his Ghost typing, Spiritomb himself can serve as the necessary spin blocker to keep these hazards on the field. However, you may wish to employ another Ghost-type to ensure that foes such as Foresight Hitmontop will fail to remove your entry hazards. Unfortunately, this doesn't stop Poison-types from removing your Toxic Spikes as they switch in. Therefore, Dugtrio makes a good partner to trap and KO these troublesome Pokemon. Moltres and Arcanine can also deal with the most common Poison-type, Venusaur, with ease; these two can also take on annoying Fighting- and Steel-type Pokemon who resist Spiritomb's Dark Pulse.</p>"

  "Gabite": {
    "overview": "<p>Gabite is among an elite few NFE Pokemon that are actually viable in the UU tier thanks to its excellent typing and well-distributed stats. Its offensive nature makes it a safe pick for any offensive team. Gabite sports the second highest Attack stat among all Dragon-types in the UU tier, right behind Shelgon. Furthermore, Gabite has an immunity to Electric-type attacks, which is a useful quality to have on offensive teams. Although you might find Gabite's power a bit mediocre at times, it can still pack a punch with the right support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gabite has a pretty good special movepool which includes Fire Blast, Earth Power, Dragon Pulse, and Draco Meteor. However, Altaria generally outclasses it as a special attacker, so it's best to focus on utilizing physical attacks. Gabite also has access to Dragon Rush, but the lower power and accuracy makes it inferior to Outrage. Support-wise, Gabite has access to Stealth Rock, but it is generally more useful to utilize its offensive prowess.</p> <p>A Choice Scarf set can be viable, but due to Gabite having weak defensive stats overall and only a slightly above-average Attack stat, it's not that effective. Unfortunately, Gabite cannot play the same role as its bigger brother and is ultimately better off dishing out damage with a Choice Band or Life Orb. A Substitute set could be used in conjunction with sandstorm to take advantage of Gabite's ability, Sand Veil.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Steelix and Registeel are usually the best switch-ins to Gabite because they resist its strongest attack, Outrage. If Gabite decides to use Earthquake to hit your Steel-type, Flying-type Pokemon and those with levitate can switch-in and fare decently, but beware of Gabite that aren't Choice-locked. Physically defensive Claydol fares excellently against Gabite because it is immune to Earthquake and Spikes, is not 2HKOed by Outrage, and can OHKO Gabite in return with Ice Beam or Explosion. Milotic and Slowbro can 2HKO with Surf while healing with Recover and Slack Off, respectively. Donphan has a chance to OHKO Gabite with Ice Shard, or can simply pound away at it with Earthquake. Tangrowth can 2HKO Gabite with Power Whip, and takes little from most of Gabite's attacks thanks to its immense Defense stat.</p>",

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Boasting high-powered, dual STABs unresisted by anything bar Shedinja, and a unique base Speed that allows Gabite to outpace the omnipresent base 80 speed tier, Gabite can be a potent offensive threat when used correctly. Since most offensive Dragon-types currently reside in either the OU or Uber tiers, Gabite's only competition as an offensive Dragon-type in UU is Altaria. Gabite's resistance to Stealth Rock, higher Attack stat, and STAB Earthquake are what differentiates it from Altaria. Sadly, Gabite does not get Swords Dance or Dragon Dance, so wielding a Choice Band or Life Orb is its best option for increasing damage output. The need to go mixed with Fire Blast is unnecessary since all Steel-type Pokemon in UU are grounded, and thus weak to Earthquake.</p> <p>Outrage is the primary STAB move for this set since it is nearly unresisted and can pack quite a punch with Spikes support. It is best to remove Steel-types beforehand by using Earthquake, which with a Choice Band deals 45.8% - 54.2% to 252/0 Steelix and 57.7% - 68.1% to 252/0 Registeel. The final two slots of this moveset are filler. Stone Edge deals with Flying-types such as Moltres, while Dragon Claw is a weaker alternative if you're afraid of locking Gabite into Outrage.</p> <p>The choice of item ultimately comes down to personal preference. Choice Band packs a greater punch than Life Orb, pushing many near-2HKOs into actual 2HKOs with the aid of Stealth Rock damage. However, Life Orb prevents Gabite from being locked into one attack, making it the better item to use against offensive teams. Although Gabite is in a unique speed tier, maximizing Speed ensures that Gabite wins the rare Speed tie with opposing Gabite. You can use an Adamant nature with the same EVs to deal more damage to physical walls, but then Gabite won't be able to outpace positive natured base 80 Speed Pokemon, such as Venusaur and Blaziken, which is pretty crucial.</p> <p>Gabite shines best when the sturdiest physical walls are removed, as most semi-frail Pokemon are OHKOed by Outrage or Earthquake. Since most physical walls are weak to Grass-type attacks, Venusaur makes an ideal partner for Gabite. The two common walls not weak to Grass-type attacks, Tangrowth and Leafeon, are maimed by Venusaur's Sludge Bomb. Furthermore, Venusaur can incapacitate the opponent with Sleep Powder, allowing Gabite to smack them while they are crippled. Thanks to Gabite's Ground typing, Pokemon such as Registeel and Slowbro will think twice about using Thunder Wave, allowing Venusaur to get in more reliably. Dugtrio also works well as an offensive partner to Gabite because it can trap and kill most Steel-types easily, which in turn lets Gabite use its primary Dragon-type STAB recklessly.</p> <p>If you plan to combat physical walls with a more brute-force approach, Spikes and Stealth Rock support is needed to 2HKO the sturdiest of opponents. Omastar makes an ideal partner as it can deploy both Spikes and Stealth Rock at the start of the match. Qwilfish is a good alternative for Spikes support, thanks to its high Speed stat and access to Taunt which shuts down opposing entry hazard leads. Outside of Spikes, dual screen support is another option to consider in order to patch up Gabite's pathetic defensive stats. Uxie is an excellent choice because it can set up Stealth Rock in addition to screens.</p>"

  "Hippopotas": {
    "overview": "<p>Surprisingly, summoning a permanent sandstorm is not the only thing of value Hippopotas can accomplish. It also has the convenient ability to set up Stealth Rock and can do a decent job scouting from the lead slot, as well. However, expectations of Hippopotas should still be rather low. If it sets up Stealth Rock then dies, then its purpose has been served. If it sets up Stealth Rock, poisons or significantly damages something, and manages to scout a couple of members of the opposing team, then a standing ovation may be in order.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hippopotas's list of viable moves does not extend far beyond those already mentioned. Put bluntly, this is because its base stats are severely lacking in every category. Its offensive movepool isn't terrible, sporting Crunch, Double-Edge, and Superpower in addition to Earthquake, although Stone Edge's absence is slightly unfortunate. The bad news is that Hippopotas will probably only get one or two chances to strike, and its base 72 Attack really doesn't go a long way. For this reason Toxic is quite often the better method of damaging bulkier foes over the long run. Curse and Slack Off are welcome additions to many movepools, but again, Hippopotas's defenses make them nearly worthless.</p> <p>Chesto Berry can be used over Focus Sash, but with the departures of Roserade and Yanmega from UU, sleep-inducing moves are neither common nor worth relinquishing Focus Sash to prevent. Chesto Berry gets the edge over Lum Berry because Hippopotas typically won't live long enough to see Will-O-Wisp or Toxic do significant damage, so negating them with Lum Berry is useless. Leftovers is another option, but again, Focus Sash will typically do a much better job of prolonging Hippopotas's life.</p> <p>The given EVs allow Hippopotas to maximize its attack power while still surviving Life Orbed Ambipom's combination of Fake Out and Return 100% of the time. If you are running Protect, feel free to ignore this EV spread and redistribute the EVs between Attack and Defense as you see fit.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Taunt reduces Hippopotas to a horribly one-dimensional threat, preventing it from doing anything but using Earthquake. Trick leads can cripple Hippopotas in a similar manner, although they won't necessarily be able to stop it from setting up Stealth Rock. Essentially any anti-lead or strong special attacker should be able to 2HKO it. As expected, Hippopotas is not a difficult Pokemon to counter by any stretch of the imagination, but so long as it gets Stealth Rock in play it has done its job.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Hippopotas is notable only for the ability Sand Stream, which makes it the only Pokemon in UU play who can trigger a permanent sandstorm. This set attempts to make the most of Hippopotas's short lifespan by giving it the opportunity to status or scout the opponent's team as a lead. Hippopotas's primary goal, however, is to set up Stealth Rock, which should generally be made a priority over everything else. Yawn and Roar are both effective ways of scouting opponents, one of the few things Hippopotas does well. Protect can block Fake Out and trick U-turners into getting put to sleep when used in conjunction with Yawn. Meanwhile, Toxic allows Hippopotas to damage bulky Pokemon, while Earthquake is better versus fragile Pokemon and Taunt users. The EVs let Hippopotas survive a Fake Out and Return from Ambipom while allowing for maximum attack power should you opt to use Earthquake. The nature and Speed IV allow it to be slower than all Snover, so that sandstorm takes precedence over hail if the two leads are opposing each other.</p> <p>Hippopotas is the only Pokemon in the lower tiers who can set up a permanent sandstorm, which upgrades it from NFE to a bona fide player in the UU metagame. Although it at first may appear to be a miserable attempt at a lead, Hippopotas actually functions quite well in the role when taking into account its horrid stats. The goal of this set is to play to Hippopotas's strengths, which are essentially limited to setting up Stealth Rock and scouting. Focus Sash allows you to bypass Hippopotas's weak defenses and, against most leads, do both of these things.</p> <p>In some cases, Hippopotas will be forced to simply use Stealth Rock, then die on the next turn. Such instances will mostly occur against leads whom you cannot switch into for free, or if you feel the need to get Stealth Rock in play immediately. An example of this is when Hippopotas is facing Moltres, who can OHKO it with its special attacks and can U-turn out of Yawn. In other cases, however, its usefulness can extend beyond the first few moves of the game. If Hippopotas sets up Stealth Rock without being damaged, you have several options. When facing a bulky lead like Donphan or Uxie, Toxic is a good option, if you opt for it, to help shorten their longevity. If you wish to scout your opponent's team, Yawn, Roar, or a combination of the two can accomplish this. Yawn will cause most Pokemon to switch, and if they don't, they will be put to sleep. Using Yawn against Pokemon with U-turn should not be done unless you are carrying Protect with it, in which case it is a very sneaky method of putting Pokemon such as Uxie or Scyther to sleep. Because Yawn's effect activates on the second turn, you can use Roar on the subsequent move, which will allow you to scout not one, but two Pokemon, assuming your opponent decides to switch out the drowsy Pokemon. Another option is to simply switch out after using Stealth Rock, thus preserving Hippopotas's Focus Sash, provided your opponent has not set up any entry hazards. This can come in handy later in the game, as it allows Hippopotas to switch into Pokemon like Mismagius and Feraligatr while they are boosting their stats, take a hit and survive due to the Sash, and then phaze them with Yawn or Roar, whichever is most appropriate. Doing this makes Hippopotas a great last line of defense against boosting sweepers, especially those hiding behind Substitutes.</p> <p>As far as attacking options go, Hippopotas's outlook is pretty bleak. Earthquake is essentially its only viable option, as it desperately needs the STAB. For the most part, however, Hippopotas is too easily 2HKOed to spare many turns firing off relatively weak attacks. However, Earthquake does have its merits against weak Taunt leads, who will attempt to stop Hippopotas from setting up Stealth Rock. If you are more inclined to damage leads like Uxie and spread status in general, then Toxic may be the better option. In the last slot, Roar gives Hippopotas the ability to phaze pokemon with Substitute, as mentioned, which it cannot do with Yawn, and makes it a better overall phazer and scouter. Protect allows you to scout your opponent's moveset, trick U-turners into falling asleep, deal a free turn of sandstorm damage, and block Ambipom's Fake Out, which in turn lets you commit all your EVs to Attack if you wish to do so.</p> <p>Hippopotas's greatest fears are Taunt, Trick, and weather leads, and it may be in your best interest to switch out against all three. Taunt leads completely immobilize sets without Earthquake and stop those with Earthquake from setting up Stealth Rock. Even though they do nothing to prevent Stealth Rock, Trick leads are also troublesome because they can steal Hippopotas's Focus Sash and later Trick it to another one of your Pokemon, who will inevitably find it worthless. In addition, Hippopotas will likely be forced to switch and be used as death fodder later on. Opposing weather teams will give your entire team trouble, because although Hippopotas can switch in and negate their weather effect immediately, its terrible defenses only allow it to do this so many times throughout the course of a match. If the opposing lead uses Sunny Day or Rain Dance, Hippopotas should flee the scene before taking any damage so that its Focus Sash is still preserved. Good prediction will then be required to sneak Hippopotas in as many times as possible to negate repeated uses of weather-inducing moves. On a related note, Snover leads have the ability to be slower than Hippopotas and therefore override sandstorm with hail on the first turn. To avoid this, Hippopotas should run a -Speed nature with an IV of 13 to ensure it is slower.</p>"

  "Drapion": {
    "overview": "<p>The first thing you may notice about this odd-looking Pokemon is its correspondingly odd Poison/Dark typing. This typing is critical to much of Drapion's success, both as a sweeper and as a defensive utility counter. Offensively, the Dark subtype grants a great offensive STAB, which in turn complements Drapion's nice movepool. Defensively, Drapion's Dark subtype gives it useful resistances to Ghost-, Psychic-, and Dark-type attacks, while its Poison subtype neutralizes the Fighting-type coverage attacks typically used by Pokemon with those STABs and offers resistances to Grass- and Poison-type attacks. This Pokemon is not a common sight in UU, but don't let that fool you--Drapion is very good at what it does, both as a sweeper and as a defensive stronghold.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Most sets should invest fully in two stats and place the remaining EVs in HP or Defense. Defensive sets do not have any particular Speed benchmarks to worry about, while offensive sets usually derive more benefit from max Attack and Speed than from any minimal defensive investment. The one exception is on the bulky Swords Dance set, which should maximize HP, pick a Speed benchmark, then place the remaining EVs into Special Defense. 224 Speed EVs beat similarly natured base 91 and 90 Pokemon (Rotom and Moltres), 176 Speed EVs beat similarly natured base 85 Pokemon (Toxicroak and Pinsir), and 136 Speed EVs beat similarly natured base 80 Pokemon (Venusaur and Kabutops). A Jolly nature and 44 Speed will outpace neutral-natured base 80 Pokemon; this is more efficient than Careful with 136 Speed because Drapion's base Speed stat is higher than its base Special Defense stat.</p> <p>Shed Shell is an option on all of Drapion's sets if Dugtrio is a problem, but the offensive sets will miss the Life Orb boost, while defensive sets will miss Leftovers recovery. The set that loses the least from using Shed Shell is probably the RestTalk set, since it has an alternative way to recover its HP. Payback can also be used on defensive sets since it guarantees the OHKO on sweeper Mismagius and Rotom without Stealth Rock. Crunch is usually a superior option, though, as it will still deal near fatal damage to those two while sporting higher PP and more reliable power.</p> <p>A set with Rest, Sleep Talk, Acupressure, and Crunch can be tricky to stop if Drapion hits the right boosts early in its setup. It's not reliable enough to beat most of Drapion's standard hard counters, though.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Drapion's typical counters are physically bulky Pokemon, especially ones with a resistance to Dark-type moves or access to Ground-type moves. Whether a specific Pokemon can counter Drapion also depends on the Drapion set in question. Life Orb Drapion is quickly worn down by Intimidate Hitmontop, but the bulky Swords Dance set will simply set up additional Swords Dances on Hitmontop before KOing it with the help of Close Combat's Defense drops. Bulky Ground-type Pokemon such as Donphan, Rhyperior, Steelix, and Torterra have high Defense and STAB Earthquake. If Drapion packs Aqua Tail, though, Donphan and Rhyperior with offensive spreads will get mauled, and if Drapion has Ice Fang, Torterra will be in trouble. However, Donphan and Rhyperior who invest heavily in HP and Defense will survive as long as they are high on health. Unfortunately for Torterra, it can't survive a boosted Ice Fang even if it has max Defense--it must hope that Drapion neglects Ice Fang in favor of Aqua Tail to hit the more common Donphan and Rhyperior. Standard Steelix has nothing to fear from Drapion since it has an astronomical 200 base Defense, making it the most reliable Ground-type counter. If Drapion uses a bulkier set, its lower immediate power makes all of these Ground-types great counters.</p> <p>Several other Pokemon can beat Life Orb Drapion by virtue of unique abilities or moves. Note that the bulky Swords Dance set with Taunt can shut down many of these strategies since they are based on moves that aren't direct attacks. Weezing and Spiritomb who pack heavy investments in Defense survive Crunch cleanly and can cripple Drapion with Will-O-Wisp. Milotic with Haze can stall Drapion with Life Orb recoil for a few turns and finish it off with Surf (which hits Drapion's much lower Special Defense stat), but this is a tad unreliable due to the higher chance of Drapion firing off critical hits. Tangrowth has Leech Seed and Sleep Powder at its disposal to disrupt Drapion, and it can also recover HP through Synthesis and hit Drapion with Earthquake. In general, bulkier teams need to use a bit of intelligent switching if they want to beat Drapion without losing part of their valuable defensive core.</p> <p>Offensive teams have an easier time revenge killing Drapion because it has a prominent Earthquake weakness, mediocre Special Defense, and no priority attacks. Tauros is the best offensive switch-in to Drapion since it can buffer attacks with Intimidate, outpace Drapion, and OHKO with Earthquake. Other fast Pokemon such as Swellow, Scyther, Ambipom, and Manectric also check Drapion, but they should be careful not to switch into Crunch. Funnily enough, due to Drapion's naturally low Special Defense, Alakazam easily checks Swords Dance Drapion--if its Focus Blast hits. Offensive Hariyama boasts a resistance to Crunch, and it can handle Swords Danced Earthquake well if it's high on health. It may be a good idea to invest a few EVs into Defense, though, as Earthquake can become problematic if Stealth Rock is up and Hariyama is eating Toxic Orb / Flame Orb damage.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Drapion has solid Speed and Attack stats backed up by Swords Dance and great offensive moves, making it a dangerous UU sweeper. After Drapion sets up a Swords Dance, either on weak attackers such as Chansey or against switching Ghost- and Psychic-types, it can use its high Speed and excellent type coverage to terrorize the tier.</p> <p>Crunch has excellent neutral coverage, so it is Drapion's preferred move for sweeping. Earthquake hits many of the UU Pokemon who resist Dark, including Registeel, Aggron, and Blaziken, for super effective damage. All of the remaining Dark resisters are hit for at least neutral damage. While these two moves provide nice coverage, there are some Pokemon who will wall the combination due to sheer defensive stats. Chief among these are bulky Ground-types, who can threaten Drapion with Earthquake. Aqua Tail helps alleviate this problem, as it OHKOes Rhyperior and can OHKO Donphan after a tiny bit of residual damage.</p> <p>The EVs on this set are straightforward for a sweeper set. A Jolly nature is chosen to enable Drapion to outpace Moltres, Rotom, and Toxicroak, and to ensure it Speed ties opposing Leafeon, Houndoom, and Arcanine. In practice, though, many Arcanine choose to use either an Adamant nature or a Jolly nature with defensive EVs, which means Jolly Drapion will outpace almost all Arcanine.</p> <p>Both of Drapion's abilities can be useful, but Sniper is preferred on this set since it is not supposed to take many hits before it tries to rampage through the opponent's team. While Life Orb is more reliable, Scope Lens can be used with Night Slash to turn Drapion into a critical hit abuser. Since this comes with a drop in power on non-critical hit shots, Aqua Tail is not as effective against Ground-type Pokemon, so replacing it with Cross Poison is an option for another STAB attack that is able to abuse critical hits. Finally, using a Lum Berry lets Drapion freely set up against most Venusaur, Slowbro, and Rotom without worrying about being hit by a nasty status effect.</p> <p>There are also some different moves that can be used in the last slot to take care of specific threats. Ice Fang lets Drapion hit defensive Torterra for an OHKO but suffers from drastically reduced power against Donphan and Rhyperior. Taunt means bulkier Pokemon with weak or resisted attacks won't be able to cripple Drapion with status moves, such as Will-O-Wisp or Sleep Powder; specifically, it turns counters like Will-O-Wisp Weezing into setup fodder. Taunt will also stop Milotic from using Haze, but a mispredicted Surf will deal heavy damage to Drapion. Finally, Poison Jab hits Pokemon who are neutral to Drapion's other attacks, including Hitmontop, Tangrowth, and Leafeon. Its poor coverage compared to Crunch's makes it only a secondary option.</p> <p>Although bulky Grounds are Drapion's stereotypical counters, Aqua Tail makes most of them unreliable checks at best. However, Steelix's massive Defense stat allows it to solidly counter Drapion, even when Drapion has Earthquake or Aqua Tail. Donphan and Rhyperior who run more Defense than the standard--or even an Impish nature--are also good counters. 252 HP / 0 Def Torterra struggles to survive Swords Dance Crunch if it has taken a bit of prior damage, but physically defensive versions can shrug off all of Drapion's attacks except for Ice Fang. Hitmontop boasts a resistance to Drapion's primary STAB and packs Intimidate to cut Drapion's Attack stat, allowing it to quickly wear down Drapion with Close Combat. Haze Milotic is able to stall out Drapion via Life Orb recoil and Surf, but its chances of beating critical hit-abusing variants of this set are low. Finally, while Drapion's Speed stat is decent, it lacks a priority move, and many faster Pokemon have no qualms revenge killing a Drapion weakened by Life Orb.</p>"

      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>It may seem like a shame not to use Swords Dance, but Drapion's access to Pursuit makes an all-out attacking set viable. Drapion has several qualities that distinguish it from other common Pursuit users. First, a neutrality to Fighting-type attacks means that Drapion performs better against Alakazam's Focus Blast and Mismagius's Hidden Power Fighting. Second, its relatively high Speed--greater than that of Rotom--allows Drapion to fire off attacks before it is hit by nasty status effects, especially burn. Finally, an expansive movepool with great coverage means Drapion has lots of team utility beyond just using Pursuit.</p> <p>Pursuit and Crunch are obvious moves on this set. Pursuit lets Drapion perform its trapping duties, and Crunch gives it a reliable STAB attack. Earthquake provides the best coverage with Crunch, as it hits Steel-types super effectively and Fighting-types neutrally. Aqua Tail washes away Rhyperior and hits Donphan harder than any of Drapion's other attacks, but only Ice Fang will 2HKO physically bulky Torterra.</p> <p>The EV spread is straightforward; Attack and Speed are maximized, and the last four EVs are dumped in Special Defense to help take resisted special hits better. Although lowering Speed comes at the expense of being unable to Speed tie opposing base 95s, an alternative spread of 252 Atk / 32 SpD / 224 Spe can be used to outpace Rotom while taking less from powerful attacks such as Alakazam's Focus Blast or Mismagius's Nasty Plot-boosted Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Good teammates for this set are Pokemon who appreciate the absence of Mismagius and Rotom. Powerful Choiced attackers, such as Hitmonlee and Tauros, benefit when there are no opposing Pokemon immune to their STAB moves present, although Spiritomb is not easily trapped by Drapion and can still cause them some grief. Eliminating the Levitating Ghosts will make it easier for Choice Band Rhyperior to carelessly spam Earthquake. Additionally, Rapid Spin users love when opposing Ghosts are eliminated, as do their Stealth Rock-weak teammates. In particular, Donphan is a good partner because its STAB Earthquake deals with Spiritomb, who is the Ghost-type Drapion has the most problems with.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>This variation from the standard Swords Dance set focuses on obtaining more than one Swords Dance with the help of a bulky EV spread. Drapion's typing allows it to set up on specially-inclined sweepers such as Mismagius, Rotom, and Choiced Alakazam, as well as against weak walls such as Weezing, Chansey, and Slowbro. However, the lack of Attack investment and Life Orb makes Drapion more vulnerable to its typical counters. Thorough scouting and well-timed setup is required for this set to function at its best.</p> <p>Taunt allows Drapion to shut down common checks, including Registeel, Weezing, and Spiritomb, by preventing them from using status moves. It also stops Milotic from using Haze, and Blastoise from using Roar. This gives Drapion more chances to use Swords Dance and keep boosting its Attack. Crunch and Earthquake provide optimal coverage alongside each other. Protect may seem like an odd choice, but it can PP stall attacks such as Hitmontop's Close Combat, and is also very useful to garner Drapion additional Leftovers recovery.</p> <p>With 136 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature, Drapion outpaces all base 80 Speed Pokemon, including Venusaur, Blaziken, and Kabutops. This lets it OHKO Blaziken and Kabutops with Earthquake and Taunt Venusaur's Sleep Powder. 252 HP is used to maximize Drapion's overall bulk, and the remaining EVs are put into Special Defense to make the most of Drapion's resistances. Lowering Speed to 44 EVs will give Drapion greater bulk while still letting it outpace neutral-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon.</p> <p>This set has much less power than the standard Swords Dance set, so it will struggle against bulky Ground-types. Without a Pokemon who can lure and substantially weaken the opponent's Ground-type, Drapion has little hope of sweeping. Aggron with Aqua Tail and / or Ice Punch can 2HKO offensive variants of Rhyperior, Donphan, and Torterra with Head Smash and the appropriate coverage move, while defensive versions of all three are 2HKOed by two hits from said coverage move. Steelix is a bit of a problem, but Aggron's Low Kick handles it well. Rhyperior and Steelix can be both lured in by a strong Normal- or Flying-type attacker. Scyther, especially when backed up by Spikes, quickly wears these two down with repeated U-turns. Tauros deals a healthy chunk of damage to both with Earthquake; even though it won't 2HKO either of the two, Tauros will leave them extremely weakened and easy prey for Drapion's own Earthquake. Registeel with Explosion and Ice Punch baits and KOes Donphan and Torterra.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Although Drapion has mediocre Special Defense, its resistances to Ghost-, Dark-, Grass-, and Poison-type attacks along with an immunity to Psychic-type attacks make a specially defensive set quite useful. It serves as a hard stop to offensive Mismagius, Rotom, Uxie, Mesprit, special Venusaur, and most Alakazam.</p> <p>Crunch provides a reliable STAB attack that hits most Ghost- and Psychic-types super effectively. Drapion takes minimal damage from most attacks these Pokemon use--with perhaps the exception of Alakazam's Life Orb Focus Blast--meaning it has lots of free turns to abuse. These can be used to Whirlwind the opposing team, quickly racking up residual damage.</p> <p>The choice of moves in the last two slots depends on what role you want Drapion to serve. Using Toxic Spikes along with either Taunt or Knock Off gives Drapion more versatility, but using Rest and Sleep Talk gives it much greater longevity. Toxic Spikes are effective at wearing down many grounded sweepers and walls despite the popularity of grounded Poison-types in UU. Taunt stops walls from using their recovery moves and from setting up entry hazards. Knock Off eliminates Leftovers, Life Orb, and Choice items, making both walls and sweepers easier to handle. Finally, if you really want to use Toxic Spikes without giving up Drapion's recovery, running Rest without Sleep Talk is a viable option as long as you have a cleric on the same team.</p> <p>The given nature and EV spread maximize Drapion's specially defensive capabilities. Mismagius's Life Orb Thunderbolt will never 3HKO this set, and Alakazam's Life Orb Focus Blast will never 2HKO. Battle Armor is the more useful ability for this set since it is supposed to take hits rather than dish them out, and getting pelted by a critical hit can quickly put a damper in your plans. For example, it allows Drapion with Rest to stall out standard Milotic without worrying about a potential critical hit.</p> <p>If Dugtrio starts becoming a pain, Drapion can run Shed Shell to escape, but this obviously forces it to forfeit Leftovers recovery. Making this swap on variants without Rest isn't recommended because that means Drapion won't have a way to recover its health.</p> <p>Drapion appreciates Pokemon who can cover its nasty weakness to Ground-type attacks. Physically defensive Milotic is able to handle most Earthquake users with its great bulk and STAB Surf. Milotic obviously cannot deal with Torterra's powerful Wood Hammer, so using another Pokemon such as Weezing in tandem can complete the defensive core. Weezing also provides a valuable resistance to Fighting-type attacks.</p> <p>Since this set primarily relies on residual damage to do its job, its teammates should be able to lay down Stealth Rock and Spikes. Omastar is probably the best overall choice for defensive teams since it can lay down both hazards by itself. It is also a good switch-in to the Flying-type attacks that hit many other stall members neutrally or super effectively. Cloyster has Spikes but not Stealth Rock; to compensate for that, it can use Rapid Spin to clear hazards the opposing team has set up. Finally, Qwilfish provides Spikes along with a unique set of resistances, but the weakness to Ground-type attacks that it shares with Drapion may be off-putting.</p>"
      },
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Drapion can make an effective lead, as it possesses the ability to shut down set-up leads with Taunt and set up Toxic Spikes against them. It can also outspeed and deal massive damage to, if not OHKO, common UU threats such as Rotom and Blaziken, giving it considerable use outside of the lead position.</p> <p>Drapion can outspeed and Taunt common leads such as Uxie, Mesprit, and Spiritomb, essentially preventing them from functioning as a lead. It can then proceed to set up Toxic Spikes, as the aforementioned leads cannot hurt Drapion. Aside from that, Drapion can make use of powerful attacks in Crunch and Earthquake. Crunch has STAB, and is Drapion's primary attack, hitting common leads such as Uxie and Mesprit for super effective damage. Earthquake provides good coverage when paired with Crunch, hitting Electrode, Houndoom, Qwilfish, and Steel-type Pokemon that resist Crunch for super effective damage. Lum Berry prevents Drapion from being crippled by status from the likes of Mismagius, Venusaur, Jumpluff, and Butterfree.</p> <p>Leftovers is an option over Lum Berry, as it gives Drapion helpful, gradual recovery. An EV spread of 180 HP / 104 Atk / 224 Spe is recommended with Leftovers, as it allows Drapion to survive two Surfs from bulky Omastar.</p> <p>Ambipom is a problem for this lead, as it can deal 40% damage to Drapion with Fake Out and potentially KO it afterwards with Return. It can also use Taunt, preventing Drapion from setting up Toxic Spikes. Donphan is another lead that Drapion does not fare well against. It can OHKO Drapion with STAB Earthquake, and takes minimal damage from any of Drapion's attacks due to its high Defense stat. Additionally, it can use Rapid Spin to clear the field of any Toxic Spikes that Drapion can set up. Mismagius makes an exceptional partner, as it can deal with the aforementioned problematic leads. Mismagius is immune to Fake Out, and can 2HKO Ambipom with Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Fighting. It is also immune to Donphan's Earthquake, and can block its attempts at using Rapid Spin.</p>"

Anticipation is almost always an inferior ability as Earthquake, Psychic, and Flying-type attacks are usually fairly predictable, so the added immunity to Water and potential healing Dry Skin brings is usually preferable. Scouting for Explosion can prove useful, though.</p> <p>On any Toxicroak set, running max Speed is advisable. Regardless of the nature you use, running at least 240 Speed is useful to outpace Magmortar. From there, you may as well run max Speed to hit the Speed tie with Pinsir and opposing Toxicroak. Throughout this analysis, neutral Speed natures have been recommended due to Toxicroak's range of priority moves, and thus it is generally more worthwhile to invest in offensive stats than Speed. If you do opt to use a Speed-boosting nature, then you would outspeed a handful of Pokemon, including Moltres, Arcanine, and positively natured Blaziken, Medicham, Magmortar, Feraligatr, and Kabutops. Out of these Pokemon, Feraligatr and Kabutops very rarely use Jolly natures, and the latter is commonly played with rain support, allowing it to outspeed Toxicroak anyway by virtue of Swift Swim. However, it is very useful for Swords Dance Toxicroak to be able to beat Blaziken and Arcanine, both of which can otherwise beat him convincingly. The Nasty Plot set really benefits from outspeeding Moltres, as even boosted Vacuum Waves will not be enough to KO Moltres, even after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Unfortunately, using a positive nature really hurts Toxicroak's ability to break down a few key walls -- Jolly Swords Dance Toxicroak only has a tiny chance to 2HKO Spiritomb after one boost, whereas he is almost guaranteed with Adamant. It also greatly reduces the chance of a 2HKO with a +2 Cross Chop and Sucker Punch on 252 HP / 252 Def Tangrowth. With an Adamant nature, it is guaranteed with Stealth Rock, while there is still a very good chance of a 2HKO even without Stealth Rock in play. A Jolly Toxicroak will never 2HKO without Stealth Rock, and is not guaranteed to do so when Stealth Rock is in play either.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Countering Toxicroak can be daunting, due to its large movepool and the ability to hurt the vast majority of potential checks with one move or another. However, after finding out the set, switching into Toxicroak becomes much easier. Bulky Poison-types are generally a safe bet -- Weezing can come in on any physically based set and threaten Toxicroak with Will-O-Wisp or Flamethrower. Muk can also serve as an effective check, only really fearing the rare Earthquake. Donphan can take an Ice Punch with relative ease and OHKO back with Earthquake. Nidoqueen is also an acceptable switch-in, though it is also weak to Ice Punch. Drapion isn't quite such a safe bet, but is faster than Toxicroak, can survive one Cross Chop, resists Sucker Punch, and can KO him easily with Earthquake.</p> <p>Ghost-types such as Rotom and Mismagius are serious obstacles to a Toxicroak sweep, being able to dodge Sucker Punch with status moves or Substitute, and having an immunity to Toxicroak's STAB Fighting moves. Dusclops is less reliable, as its lower Speed makes it susceptible to Taunt, allowing Toxicroak to hit it with Sucker Punch. However, it does better against the Choice Band set. Similarly, Spiritomb works well against Choiced sets, but cannot do damage back quickly enough against the Swords Dance or the Nasty Plot sets. Bulky Psychic-types also do well against Toxicroak, particularly the physical sets, but face a high-risk prediction game and will need some way of threatening Toxicroak without directly attacking it, in order to avoid Sucker Punch. Uxie is a relatively safe switch, as it can survive Swords Dance-boosted Sucker Punches, as well as Nasty Plot-boosted Dark Pulses, and OHKO in return with Psychic. Slowbro is almost OHKOed by Sucker Punch after a Swords Dance, but can beat Toxicroak by hitting him with Psychic on the turn that he uses Taunt or another attacking move. Mesprit works in pretty much the same manner.</p> <p>Venusaur and Intimidate Arcanine are both capable of switching into Toxicroak as he uses Swords Dance or Nasty Plot, surviving one boosted priority attack and OHKOing in return, though Arcanine cannot afford to switch in on Toxicroak's STAB attacks. Moltres is a safe switch as long as Toxicroak isn't packing Stone Edge, whereas Altaria has to be wary of Ice Punch. Scyther has to be similarly careful of these attacks, but can switch in on Toxicroak's STAB attacks, outspeed and threaten with Aerial Ace. Regardless, countering Toxicroak is much harder than simply never letting him into play in the first place--if your team is very offensive, short of Choice-locked Water-type moves or Pursuit, Toxicroak will have difficulty switching in.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Toxicroak is a very useful late-game sweeper. While Toxicroak's poor defensive stats make getting into play difficult, the Water-type immunity granted by Dry Skin allows Toxicroak to come in on the likes of Milotic and Azumarill with relative impunity, giving him an opportunity to set up Swords Dance. Despite having several other notable resistances, namely Rock, Fighting, Bug, Dark, Poison, and Grass, such poor defenses make coming in on powerful STAB attacks from the likes of Venusaur, Rhyperior, and Hitmontop impractical. These resistances are very useful, however, for avoiding revenge kills. Toxicroak shrugs off Sucker Punches and Aqua Jets from Pokemon such as Azumarill and Absol thanks to handy resistances to almost all priority moves; however, Toxicroak needs to be wary of Fake Out from Ambipom, which does 49.03% - 57.79% from a Jolly Life Orb variant. In addition, Toxicroak's Swords Danced Sucker Punch is powerful enough to OHKO a large number of Pokemon who would otherwise outspeed and OHKO it first, such as Espeon, Alakazam, Swellow, and Sceptile. These two factors make Swords Dance Toxicroak very dangerous against offensive teams who are mostly dependent on revenge killing to deal with offensive threats.</p> <p>Low Kick is the primary option in the second moveslot, as it hits quite a few common Pokemon for more damage than Cross Chop, such as Registeel, Torterra, and Milotic. Furthermore, despite Cross Chop producing consistent damage output, its accuracy is definitely not attractive. Sucker Punch hits a large number of important Pokemon who resist Toxicroak's STAB Cross Chop--most notably, Slowbro, Claydol, and Uxie. Spiritomb is also hit hard by Sucker Punch and is 2HKOed after a Swords Dance. While Ice Punch ensures that foes such as Altaria and Torterra are disposed of, Taunt can prevent Toxicroak from getting afflicted with status whilst setting up Swords Dance.</p> <p>Swords Dance Toxicroak has difficulty getting past Weezing, Nidoqueen, and Substitute Mismagius. Venusaur and Rotom can cause problems as well if they are faster than Toxicroak. Generally, all of the aforementioned Pokemon will have to be eliminated or at least weakened before attempting to sweep, and so it is generally advisable to carry some way of eliminating these Pokemon in your team. Offensive Life Orb Milotic makes a fine choice--it commonly lures in Venusaur, Mismagius, and occasionally Rotom, and can deal heavy damage to all of them with Ice Beam or Hydro Pump. It can also come in on Weezing's predictable Will-O-Wisps to activate Marvel Scale, and easily forces Nidoqueen out. Furthermore, Toxicroak makes an excellent switch into the three Pokemon who cause offensive Milotic the most problems, namely Chansey, opposing Milotic, and Ludicolo. Speaking of Ludicolo, it also partners very well with Toxicroak by luring in Venusaur easily and doing up to 85% with a Life Orb Ice Beam, while also forcing switches into Chansey to give Toxicroak opportunities to set up. Furthermore, it commonly carries Rain Dance, which recovers some of Toxicroak's health each turn it is in play, ensuring that Life Orb recoil doesn't get the better of Toxicroak. Both Uxie and Mesprit have a handy immunity to Ground-type moves and can set up Stealth Rock as well as cripple opposing Pokemon with Thunder Wave or Yawn, thereby easing the pressure when Toxicroak attempts to sweep.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Nasty Plot Toxicroak doesn't hit quite as hard as physically based Toxicroak, due to a considerably lower Special Attack stat and lower Base Power moves. However, he makes up for it with a STAB priority move and surprise factor, as most people would expect the more common physical-based sets. Sludge Bomb provides a more powerful secondary STAB attack to hit slower, bulkier opponents such as Milotic, Spiritomb, and some Moltres, as well as landing an OHKO on Tangrowth. What you choose for the last slot depends on the rest of your team and what you have problems breaking down defensively. Dark Pulse is a good choice for hitting Ghost-types such as Rotom, Dusclops, Claydol, and Mismagius hard, all of which wall the rest of the set. Focus Blast is another worthwhile option, as despite the low accuracy, it is Toxicroak's most powerful weapon against Regirock, Registeel, and Chansey, all of which shrug off anything else this set has to offer.</p> <p>A Timid nature ensures that Toxicroak outspeeds positive natured Venusaur and Blaziken. However, due to Toxicroak's mediocre Special Attack stat, using a Modest nature is not out of the question. Discounting the surprise factor, Nasty Plot Toxicroak is generally easier to counter than the Swords Dance set. However, once specific problem Pokemon have been eliminated from the picture, he can sweep very effectively. For this reason, it is generally more effective to play him late-game, when these specific checks have been removed or weakened. These Pokemon vary enormously depending on what move you run in the last slot -- Chansey, Registeel, Altaria, Moltres, Regirock, Nidoqueen, Muk, and Arcanine can all potentially stop a sweep depending on what coverage move you run, or if they are not sufficiently weakened. Most of these Pokemon dislike Stealth Rock, and as a result, it is important to set it up as soon as possible.</p> <p>As for potential teammates, Tangrowth makes an excellent partner, providing a vital Ground resistance and also being able to lure in the majority of these problem Pokemon, and can inflict status on them with Sleep Powder of Stun Spore or even weaken them enough to facilitate a Toxicroak sweep. Aggron can bulldoze through the aforementioned Pokemon, paving the way for Toxicroak to comfortably set up and attempt to sweep. Moltres can break down the aforementioned Pokemon bar Chansey while Pursuit users such as Spiritomb and Drapion can take out Psychic-types who threaten Toxicroak.</p>"
      },
      "SubPunch": {
        "description": "<p>The beauty of SubPunch Toxicroak is that the core moves work together so well; being behind a Substitute encourages your opponent to attack, making them susceptible to Sucker Punch. Whilst the set's lack of power makes it difficult to break full-blown stall, it is very useful against more balanced teams and bulky offense, as they commonly rely on Pokemon such as Altaria and Moltres to combat Fighting-types, who both fall prey to this set. Substitute minimizes the need for prediction, and somewhat makes up for Toxicroak's frailty by ensuring that he can get off at least one safe hit before being KOed. Toxicroak can get plenty of opportunities to set up a Substitute, mainly against Water-types such as Azumarill, Milotic, Ludicolo, and Kabutops, but he can also force switches with the threat of Sucker Punch against weakened opponents.</p> <p>Ice Punch is generally the more reliable move choice for the final slot, as it allows Toxicroak to OHKO all Altaria variants except the most physically defensive ones. It also hits Nidoqueen hard, and allows you to beat defensive Torterra that commonly switch into Toxicroak. However, it leaves you helpless against Moltres. Stone Edge allows Toxicroak to threaten Moltres, Altaria, and Scyther, all of which can easily survive the set's core attacks.</p> <p>SubPunch Toxicroak does appreciate rain support as it really helps him to recover health lost from Substitute. Mind games with Sucker Punch will allow Toxicroak to hide behind a Substitute for several turns, gradually recovering lost HP as your opponent tries to outpredict you. In turn, this allows Toxicroak to use a different item, such as Life Orb or Black Belt, whilst still recovering lost HP. This makes Toxicroak much more dangerous against defensive teams. However, it is not really advisable to set up rain for Toxicroak alone; there are other Pokemon, such as Ludicolo or Omastar, who gain much more from rain support. Toxicroak alone doesn't benefit enough from it to warrant setting it up.</p> <p>As previously noted, SubPunch Toxicroak works well against balanced and bulky offensive teams, luring out and crippling the likes of Moltres, Altaria, and Scyther. This makes Toxicroak an ideal partner for Pokemon who have trouble breaking down these threats; Blaziken, Scyther, and Hitmonlee are all good choices. Choice Specs Espeon works particularly well together with SubPunch Toxicroak, as with Trick, it can lock the likes of Registeel and Chansey into one move, making them much easier for Substitute Toxicroak to set up on. It can also dry-Baton Pass out to Toxicroak from these threats, giving it a free turn to Substitute. Being able to Trick a Choice item onto bulky Water-types is also invaluable, since even weak Ice Beams can break Toxicroak's Substitutes, locking them into one move makes setting up Toxicroak much easier. Moltres is also an excellent Pokemon to play together with Toxicroak. By luring in bulky Water-types and Chansey, it can U-turn straight to Toxicroak, forcing them out. Houndoom and Arcanine are also solid choices as they also lure Water-type Pokemon in, allowing a free switch-in for Toxicroak as the opposing Water-type uses a Water-type move. However, bear in mind that setting up on Chansey is all but impossible if your opponent knows your set, as they can just use Seismic Toss repeatedly, never giving you a chance to Focus Punch them.</p>"

  "Carnivine": {
    "overview": "<p>Carnivine is an odd Grass-type, sporting some good base attacking stats, some weaker defensive stats, a horrible Speed, and Levitate, which is what really separates Carnivine from its Grass-type brethren. While almost completely outclassed by other Grass-types, Carnivine does have a niche in its Swords Dance set which, while almost always inferior to Leafeon or Venusaur, can work with Levitate. Levitate makes Carnivine completely immune to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Earthquake, allowing it some unique opportunities to set up a Swords Dance, such as on a Choice Rhyperior's Earthquake (something Venusaur could only ever dream of doing). In short, Carnivine has a niche, but is usually harshly outclassed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Carnivine's defenses are not top-notch, access to Sleep Powder, Stun Spore, Knock Off, and reliable healing in Synthesis means that Carnivine can viably run a support set. Leech Seed can also be used to slowly sap health from opponents, an especially deadly strategy when combined with entry hazards. Although Carnivine can utilize Growth along with its base 90 Special Attack, it is not recommended as Carnivine has a bad special movepool and a lack of power compared to Swords Dance. Crunch can be used over Return on the Swords Dance set to hit Ghost-types more reliably, but Return overshadows it due to its higher Base Power and better coverage when combined with Power Whip. Stockpile can raise Carnivine's defenses, but the prevalence of moves like Sludge Bomb and Flare Blitz, combined with Carnivine's less-than-stellar defenses, remove most of its viability. Finally, Gastro Acid and Worry Seed can render opposing Pokemon who rely on an ability near-useless, such as Swellow (though Brave Bird will still do a number on Carnivine).</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Carnivine is easily countered by most Fire-types. Moltres and Arcanine are prime choices due to their bulk and reliable healing. Moltres, however, will have to be careful about switching in too often if Stealth Rock is on the field. Houndoom and Blaziken can also reliably check Carnivine, but their lack of bulk and reliable recovery make them less-than-desirable. Most Flying-types are extremely dangerous offensively, and can freely switch in on Carnivine's STAB attacks. Swellow and Scyther especially can come in on Power Whip and wreak havoc with STAB Facade and U-turn, respectively. Once again, they are rather frail, so they should make sure that Stealth Rock is off the field and that they are not switching into Return. Bulky Grass-types such as Venusaur, Tangrowth, and Leafeon can easily take any of Carnivine's attacks, heal off the damage, and retaliate. Registeel resists almost everything Carnivine can possibly throw at it, but doesn't appreciate Sleep Powder.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Carnivine's best stat, its Attack, and boosts it with Swords Dance before attempting a sweep. Levitate gives Carnivine a unique immunity to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Ground-type moves, allowing it to take hits, conserve more health, and afford more opportunities for it to set up a Swords Dance. Sleep Powder can potentially remove one of Carnivine's counters from the match, which can mean a sweep or a key threat eliminated.</p> <p>Power Whip is Carnivine's main STAB attack, having an effective Base Power of 180 after the STAB boost, and it will be hitting like a truck even without a Swords Dance. Return is a generic powerful move, and garners good coverage alongside Power Whip, denting Pokemon like Arcanine, Leafeon, Scyther, and Swellow hard. A mono-attacker approach can be attempted with Substitute and Leftovers over Return and Life Orb, but it is not encouraged as mono-Grass is walled by quite a few of the top UU Pokemon, and without Swords Dance or Life Orb, Carnivine will not be hitting nearly as hard as it needs to be.</p> <p>As it stands, Carnivine outspeeds standard Milotic and can OHKO it with a boosted Power Whip, or 2HKO with an unboosted one. An option for using Carnivine in a Trick Room team is to remove all Speed EVs, place them in HP, and run a Relaxed nature to become as slow as possible. Carnivine is not recommended on a dedicated Trick Room team, though, since after a Sleep Powder and a Swords Dance, it only gets one turn to use an attack. Synthesis is another option to use in the last slot to give Carnivine a means of easy recovery. On the other hand, Stun Spore can paralyze common switch-ins, such as Venusaur, Mismagius, Scyther, and Swellow (before its Orb activates). Once they are paralyzed, Carnivine can come in later in the game, Swords Dance, and sweep through the paralyzed Pokemon. Sleep Powder is generally superior, however, as it can completely remove a counter from the game.</p> <p>Carnivine, like all offensive Pokemon, enjoys entry hazards to help gain KOs and do more overall damage to the opposing team. Omastar is a notable teammate because it can easily come in on the Fire-types, such as Arcanine, that plague Carnivine and set up any one of the three entry hazards. Rhyperior can also deal with Fire-types, while also being able to handle Bug-types, due to its natural physical bulk, and Flying-types, due to its resistance. In addition, Rhyperior can easily switch into Registeel, a common Carnivine counter, and set up Stealth Rock to aid in Carnivine's sweep. Most Water-types can sponge the Fire Blasts and Flamethrowers that are sure to be launched at Carnivine.</p> <p>Offensively, Fire-types are an excellent complement to Carnivine. Arcanine can get a free Flash Fire boost on many Fire-types and draws out Pokemon like Milotic, who can be easily set up on by Carnivine. Arcanine also easily handles any Steel-types and can lure out and KO Pokemon such as Moltres with a Flash Fire-boosted Flare Blitz. Slowking is also a great partner offensively, as it can switch into Fire-types and set up Trick Room to remedy Carnivine's low Speed. It can also lure out Grass- and Electric-types for Carnivine to set up on.</p>"

  "Lumineon": {
    "overview": "<p>To put it simply, Lumineon is extremely outclassed. Poor stats bar Speed (Lumineon is the third fastest Swift Swim Sweeper, only being slower than Floatzel and Luvdisc) and a rather average movepool for a generic Swift Swim abuser ultimately force Lumineon into disuse. However, don't be so quick to discount this charming little fish. Lumineon's greatest offensive advantage over other Rain Dance abusers is her access to U-turn, which allows her to scout for troublesome walls instead of merely wasting a turn fruitlessly attacking them. However, ideally, Rain Dance teams should be muscling their way through virtually every wall in UU in the first place, making Lumineon's greatest offensive advantage over other Swift Swim Sweepers moot. Because of this, Lumineon is more suited to be a Rain Dance supporter. Her ability to use Rain Dance, U-turn, and Safeguard all at once, while also being a decent abuser of Rain Dance, gives her a rather distinct niche. While Safeguard allows Lumineon to keep sweepers such as Kabutops free of status, even as a Rain Dance supporter, Lumineon struggles to grasp hold of a team spot since there are many other, better Rain Dance users who can also rid the team of status, such as Lanturn. Nonetheless, Lumineon is a cute fish whose minuscule niche might just mesh perfectly with your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lumineon's movepool does have a few gimmicky options which can be used to justify her use, but they are typically extremely situational and another Pokemon probably does the job better. Lumineon has a large enough movepool to form both a generic physical and special Swift Swim abuser set, with Waterfall, Return, Bounce, U-turn, and Payback for the former, and Surf, Ice Beam, Hidden Power, Silver Wind, Psybeam, Air Cutter, and Ominous Wind for the latter. However, Lumineon lacks the stats to use either of these sets, and many of the attacks listed are situational at best. Lumineon has Tailwind as an alternative support option, but its effect doesn't last long enough for it to be effective. Agility is another way for Lumineon to boost her Speed, but Lumineon once again lacks the stats to use it effectively. Lumineon can use Toxic to cripple a bulky wall, but Lumineon doesn't really lure out walls that much since she's so weak that the opponent doesn't even need something that bulky to weather Lumineon's attacks. Lumineon can also use Tickle with U-turn to force switches and swing momentum in your team's favor, but since it's Lumineon, it's unlikely that the opponent will actually switch.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Dealing with Lumineon herself isn't really the main issue, as that's not a particularly arduous task at all. Fast Taunt leads can prevent her from setting up Rain Dance or Safeguard early on, and from there, Lumineon may have some trouble finding another opening to switch in again, as her bulk is only decent. The main problem you must prepare for when facing Lumineon is the threat of Rain Dance, which can easily rip through unprepared teams. Grass- and Water-types such as Venusaur, Leafeon, Milotic, and Slowbro are great against Rain Dance teams, resisting their Water-type moves and being able to hit back with a Grass- or Electric-type attack (Hidden Power Grass or Electric for the latter two). Registeel is also a decent option, with enough bulk to weather a hit and Explode to take out one lethal sweeper. It should be noted, however, that since Lumineon can easily prevent status with Safeguard, it's not ideal to attempt to use paralysis as your main counter to Rain Dance teams. Generally, the main idea against them is to use clever switching to prevent some of your more crucial walls from fainting, before striking back when the eight turns of Rain Dance end. Preventing Rain Dance from being set up in the first place is also ideal, since without Rain Dance, most Swift Swim Sweepers are fairly easy to pick off and are not as threatening.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rain Dance Support": {
        "description": "<p>While Lumineon is outclassed by basically every other Swift Swim abuser in rain (hey, at least she's better than Luvdisc!), and almost every other Water-type outside of rain, Lumineon's access to Rain Dance, Safeguard, and U-turn gives her a unique niche in the lead position as a Rain Dance supporter. With Lumineon's great Speed and decent bulk, she has few issues getting both Safeguard and Rain Dance up against most leads before U-turning to an appropriate Rain Dance abuser. Leads such as Uxie who attempt to spread paralysis can find their attempts futile due to Safeguard, and will even prove to be setup bait for some Rain Dance abusers. Additionally, fast Taunt leads such as Ambipom and Alakazam fail to do much to her as she can simply U-turn to a strong Pokemon to threaten them, and she can still set up Rain Dance later in the match. To top it all off, once Rain Dance has been used, Lumineon is actually surprisingly dangerous, as rain-boosted Surfs can still deal a large amount of damage to frail sweepers despite Lumineon's pitiful offensive prowess.</p> <p>Due to Lumineon's interesting Speed, different amounts of EV investment in Speed can be used with varying success. While max Speed is generally ideal to beat max base 90s such as Moltres, fewer Speed EVs can be used if you find that these Pokemon aren't particularly important to outspeed. 176 EVs allow Lumineon to outspeed all the Pokemon at the coveted Base 80 Speed mark outside of rain, which is a great overall mark for Lumineon to be just above. Due to this, it isn't particularly wise to use less Speed EVs than this, as otherwise Lumineon will be outsped by the omnipresent Venusaur. Leftover EVs can be placed in either defense depending on what you want Lumineon to switch in on. If you wish, you may use a Jolly nature with Waterfall instead of the recommended Timid nature and Surf to make U-turn slightly stronger, but this makes Lumineon's offense weaker due to Waterfall's lower Base Power.</p> <p>Since Lumineon is designed to set up Rain Dance, Pokemon who can use the rain to their advantage are necessary. Traditional Water-type abusers such as Kabutops, Gorebyss, Ludicolo, Omastar, and Qwilfish are all natural candidates due to their blistering Speed and absurdly powerful Water-type attacks under rain. However, since Lumineon herself is a Water-type, stacking your entire team with only other Water-types is less than ideal, since it makes it incredibly easy for a reasonably fast Grass-type such as Sceptile to sweep once the rain has stopped falling. To prevent this from happening, using alternative rain abusers, such as Electric-types with Thunder and Hidden Power Water, in addition to extra Rain Dance users who can cover some major weaknesses are useful. Rotom and Manectric are good choices, with great Speed and Special Attack to fully abuse 100% accurate Thunder with. As for alternative Rain Dance users, Registeel makes a good choice to take on deadly Grass-types while being bulky enough to last throughout the match to keep Rain Dance up.</p>"

  "Snover": {
    "overview": "<p>A number of people questioned Snover's ability to take over Abomasnow's job. Many people thought Snover would never see the light of day in UU play due to his lackluster stats and his total of 7 weaknesses. However, Snover can bring many positive things to the table. First and foremost, his ability activates infinite hail, making him a standard on all hail-based teams. Secondly, his typing, surprisingly enough, allows him to beat most of the bulky Waters who plague the metagame. These characteristics and his ability to provide Leech Seed and Toxic support make Snover an important aspect on defensive teams despite his poor stat distribution. However, for the most part, Snover will and should only be used in UU play if you want to build a hail team; otherwise, he might as well just be a stationary rock.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Supportwise, Snover gets a lot of things to play around with. As mentioned in the set, Grass Whistle could be used in the final slot to provide sleep support, although the accuracy is very low, making the effectiveness of the move near-useless. Snover also gets Light Screen if you want to halve the damage of special attacks for a couple of turns. Lastly, Magic Coat could work if you want to reflect Thunder Wave from Pokemon like Uxie or Mesprit.</p> <p>Offensively, Snover gets Swords Dance, and if he happens to slip in a single boost, he can actually hurt a couple of things. Snover can use Wood Hammer, Ice Shard, and Ice Punch as the main offensive moves in conjunction with Swords Dance. Snover can run a mixed set as well, although it doesn't have the overall stats to effectively run it.</p> <p>An alternate EV spread Snover could run is 248 HP / 172 Atk / 88 Spe with an Adamant nature. This particular spread aims to inflict damage on the opponent. You can replace Blizzard with Wood Hammer on the third slot if you want to attack with physical moves. With the EV spread, Swellow is 2HKOed from Ice Shard, with a chance to OHKO if it came in on Stealth Rock and if it has taken both Toxic and Hail damage. You can also aim for a similar EV spread as the previous one, but instead focus on utilizing special attacks. A Modest nature with 248 HP / 172 SpA / 88 Spe should suffice.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Counters? You could pull an entire list when you take into account his typing and overall stats; anything with a Fire-, Steel-, or Fighting-type move are considered counters. For Fire-types, Arcanine, Blaziken, Houndoom, and Moltres can easily torch Snover, while they take pitiful damage from Snover's attacks. For Steel-types, Registeel can literally switch in with impunity and take down Snover with Iron Head, or grab a free turn to set up Stealth Rock. As for Fighting-types, not everyone can switch in successfully on Snover, but Hariyama is the best Fighting-type switch in due to its ability, Thick Fat. Hariyama can shatter Snover into a million pieces with Close Combat. Other Fighting-types include Hitmontop and Hitmonlee -- both can come in on Blizzard thanks to their respectable Special Defense stats and scare away Snover with Close Combat. Clefable's ability allows it to walk all over Toxic, Leech Seed, and hail damage quite easily, making it a foolproof counter.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Snover is a huge eyebrow raiser in the UU tier when you consider his rock-bottom stats. However, with the removal of Abomasnow from UU, Snover remains the last man standing who can automatically summon a hailstorm. Snover is usually the main centerpiece on hail teams, so placing him in the lead slot is usually ideal in order to get hail on the field as soon as possible. A Leech Seed set would only make sense on someone like Snover, ensuring that he isn't a sitting duck against anything.</p> <p>Leech Seed is Snover's best bet to stay alive in the match and actually stall something out. Protect allows Snover to stall the opponent with Leech Seed and heal off some HP in the process. In addition to this, Protect also shields him from Ambipom's Fake Out. Blizzard is Snover's main attacking move since it gains 100% accuracy under hail. However, Toxic is also a noteworthy option to consider over Blizzard, if you're planning on stalling. There are a number of things to choose from in the final slot, and they each have their own purposes. Substitute is an excellent way of stalling the opponent out with the combination of Leech Seed and Protect. Wood Hammer hits hard on Pokemon who are a little frail on the physical side like Alakazam, Mismagius, and Lanturn. Ice Shard scares away Swellow, although Snover would need to run an Adamant nature to inflict any sort of respectable damage. Grass Whistle was not listed in the main set, but it could be used to provide sleep support even with the terrible accuracy.</p> <p>There are many ways to distribute EVs on Snover. The standard EV spread provided allows Snover to combat several specially inclined threats, mostly bulky Waters. The provided HP EVs ensure Snover takes one less damage from Stealth Rock, while still maintaining maximum recovery from Leftovers. The given Speed EVs ensure Snover outpaces base 50 Speed Pokemon. You can tweak the EV spread a little bit to make Snover a little more threatening offensively. For a physical-based EV spread, an Adamant nature with the EVs 248 HP / 172 Atk / 88 Spe could work in order to dish out decent damage with Wood Hammer and Ice Shard. For a specially-based EV spread, 248 HP / 172 SpA / 88 Spe could work to increase the damage of Blizzard.</p> <p>There are a number of Pokemon who benefit from Snover's hail. Examples include Walrein, Jynx, and Glaceon. If you're looking to run a stall team with Snover, Walrein makes an ideal partner. Thanks to his ability, Ice Body, Walrein is quite adept at stalling with Substitute and Protect when used under hail. If your stall team needs a Spikes user, Substitute Froslass does the job extremely well thanks to its ability, Snow Cloak. For more offensive hail teams, Glaceon can spam 100% Blizzards, and Froslass can also run an offensive Substitute set.</p> <p>If you want to improve the stall team as a whole, bringing a defensive Altaria can be quite beneficial for Snover and hail teams in general. Altaria brings convenient resistances to Fighting- and Fire-type moves, and he can provide the entire team with Heal Bell support. Nidoqueen also fits the bill since she can check a number of Fighting-type threats who threaten Snover and can provide Stealth Rock support as well. Offensively, Hariyama works well with Snover, providing a convenient resistance to Fire-type moves thanks to Thick Fat. Arcanine and Houndoom's ability Flash Fire allows them to absorb Fire-type hits directed at Snover.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>When Snover enters the playing field, the one thing going through the opponent's mind will be \"dead weight\". It is used almost solely in UU to set up hail, then either sit around for the majority of the match or just be used as death fodder. However, when equipped with a Choice Scarf, Snover stops being dead weight for hail teams and instead becomes an effective counter to almost every Rain Dance team, as well as an effective revenge killer to common Pokemon such as Venusaur.</p> <p>Blizzard is the primary attack, as it has 180 Base Power after STAB combined with 100% accuracy and no drawbacks in hail. Although Blizzard is the most powerful attack on the set, it is not the only useful one; Hidden Power Ground allows Snover to significantly damage Aggron and provides excellent coverage with Blizzard. Ice Shard is a useful tool for killing faster Pokemon with a bit of health left, such as Swellow or Dugtrio. In the final moveslot, use your Grass-type move of choice; regardless of what move you choose, Snover will still be able to demolish Rain Dance, giving it a unique niche in the UU metagame.</p> <p>244 Speed EVs with a Hasty Nature allows Snover to outspeed max Speed base 80 Pokemon such as Venusaur or Kabutops, as well as Life Orb Milotic and max Speed, neutral natured base 95 Speed Pokemon such as Arcanine. Venusaur, who will usually stay in and try to KO Snover with Life Orb Sludge Bomb, can be taken out by Blizzard before it even gets a chance to land a hit on Snover. The key to stopping rain is the element of surprise that this set gives. All Snover has to do is switch into Kabutops, either during Swords Dance or after Kabutops has killed one of your Pokemon. With the rain stopped due to Snow Warning, Snover will now outspeed Kabutops. Kabutops, under the assumption that it will be faster, will try to OHKO Snover with Stone Edge, but it will promptly be OHKOed by Snover's Grass-type attack of choice. This same method can take out Omastar (although Omastar will likely switch out unless it can KO Snover) and also stop rain, allowing Snover to slowly wear down all of the opponent's rain sweepers.</p> <p>Choosing between Energy Ball and Wood Hammer can be difficult. Both can OHKO Kabutops and Omastar; however, the former will have more power versus Rhyperior and Regirock, while the latter will deal more damage to Lanturn and Mismagius. This can be especially useful when these Pokemon switch in, expecting a light Grass Knot and instead getting smashed by a STAB Wood Hammer.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Snover adds yet another sweeper onto \"Blizzspam\" teams, and also adds a safety net for hail stall teams that often find themselves weak to Rain Dance. Obviously, other Pokemon that can abuse hail are excellent partners. Glaceon, Walrein, and Jynx can fire off STAB Blizzards from their high Special Attack stats. Dugtrio is another useful Pokemon on these hail teams, trapping and KOing Registeel and Chansey, two of Snover's biggest threats. To keep Snover healthy, a Rapid Spin user is also advised, as Snover has enough trouble switching into attacks with its low defenses anyway. Snover should be used on teams that are in need of hail, such as offensive Blizzard or hail stall teams. Snover's Snow Warning will cut Synthesis and Morning Sun's healing power, as well as take off 6% HP from your Pokemon each turn, unless they are Ice-types.</p> <p>Registeel is the best counter to this set, shrugging off anything Snover throws at it and firing off Thunder Waves, Iron Heads, or setting up Rain Dance for free. Arcanine can also shrug off all of Snover's attacks and OHKO with Flare Blitz, and can outspeed Snover without the use of boosting items (assuming it has a positive nature). Moltres also outspeeds with a positive nature and can switch in on every attack except Blizzard, threatening Snover with STAB Fire Blast. Snover's utility dramatically goes down after the set is revealed, as it only takes smart switching to ultimately take it down.</p>"

  "Lickilicky": {
    "overview": "<p>Lickilicky's movepool, like his tongue, stretches out to the horizon. His Speed may be poor, but his great HP and decent other stats help compensate for it. These factors combine to make Lickilicky a fine contender who can tank, support, and dish out damage--albeit only performing one of these jobs at a time. Lickilicky isn't bog standard because Clefable is running around UU. Clefable has a way more useful ability in Magic Guard and has reliable recovery in Soft-Boiled, all the while having a movepool that makes Lickilicky's look like a mere puddle.</p> <p>However, that should not deter you from choosing Lickilicky for your team. If you want to use Lickilicky, try to make him different from Snorlax or Clefable. Knock Off, Wish, Heal Bell, Swords Dance, and the mighty Explosion are all assets that help differentiate Lickilicky from the aforementioned walls. Explosion will most likely be a factor in any Lickilicky set that you use or battle against, so always keep that in mind when dealing with him.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lickilicky has Knock Off, which is always an awesome utility move to rob anything of its item. Lickilicky is bulky enough to run Counter; however, this renders it a kind of a one-trick pony and is hard to use more than once in a match. Heal Bell can be added to any set to provide team support; however, if using it along with Wish, Lickilicky will be unable to utilize any other Egg Move due to legality issues. The elemental punches can be run on most sets, but Lickilicky is usually better off using the more powerful Ice Beam, Fire Blast, and Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Lickilicky can make use of a SubPunch set, though Kanghaskhan usually performs this set better thanks to her higher Speed and Scrappy ability. However, Lickilicky has the option to go mixed when using the SubPunch set, allowing him to bypass enemies Kanghaskhan just simply can't muscle through, such as Weezing, Donphan, Torterra, and Tangrowth. Lickilicky also has access to Belly Drum, but is just too slow to use it successfully. Gyro Ball can be used on the Curse set, but lacks STAB and has very bad coverage alongside Return. Lickilicky has Screech, which can be used in place of Swords Dance on the set of the same name; however, it is much more situational and can be canceled simply by the opponent switching out.</p> <p>Other moves Lickilicky has access to include Shadow Ball, Surf, Focus Blast, Brick Break, and Hammer Arm. These moves have their uses in certain situations, but the moves listed in the sets offer greater neutral coverage and allow Lickilicky to battle the top threats of UU better. Body Slam can replace Return on any of the sets to paralyze Lickilicky's foes, but the higher Base Power of Return is generally more appealing. Finally, if using Lickilicky in a Trick Room team, Me First can be used to get a jump on the opposition, but is extremely situational and only works if the opponent attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fighting-types are public enemy number one for Lickilicky, so any of the multitude that reside in UU can handle most Lickilicky with ease. Hitmontop, Hitmonlee, Toxicroak, Hariyama, Blaziken, and Primeape are all good choices. Pokemon who often carry Fighting-type attacks can also break Lickilicky's bulk, including Azumarill, Ursaring, and Absol.</p> <p>If Lickilicky is using the Support or Curse set, then most Pokemon with Taunt, such as Mismagius, Ambipom, and Qwilfish, can shut Lickilicky down. The trick to countering Lickilicky is figuring out which set it is using and acting accordingly, always keeping the threat of Explosion in mind.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Lickilicky has a very extensive support movepool and enough bulk to use it effectively. When considering Lickilicky for a support role on your team, you must consider his advantages over Clefable and Chansey. Even without full investment in Defense, Lickilicky is significantly bulkier physically and has a much higher Attack stat than either Chansey or Clefable, while having only slightly less special bulk than Chansey. The only thing Lickilicky truly lacks is a decent ability.</p> <p>Return is Lickilicky's STAB of choice and is a nice move for picking off frail special sweepers. Toxic is a great move for weakening walls and for shortening the life span of sweepers that may switch into Lickilicky. If Toxic isn't your cup of tea, Knock Off can be used in its place. Knock Off is great for removing Leftovers from walls, such as Registeel, or Life Orb from sweepers, such as Hitmonlee. The next moveslot depends on how you want Lickilicky to heal his teammates; Wish replenishes HP while Heal Bell removes status from your team. What goes in the last slot is a tough choice to make. Power Whip ensures that Lickilicky will not be completely blocked by Ghost-types and prevents them from setting up Substitute. Protect, on the other hand, has a few more uses; it allows Lickilicky to stall while Toxic damage builds up, scouts your opponent's move, and provides reliable recovery in conjunction with Wish.</p> <p>The given EVs give Lickilicky maximum special bulk, as he is more suited to tanking special hits since he has almost no weaknesses to exploit; special Fighting-type attacks are almost nonexistent in UU except for those that utilize Hidden Power or Focus Blast, such as Mismagius or Alakazam. Even with no Defense investment, Lickilicky is far physically bulkier than either Chansey or Clefable. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 160 Def / 96 SpD can be used to balance Lickilicky's defenses and allows him to take physical hits better; however, this spread greatly reduces his special walling capabilities. If you want Lickilicky to take physical attacks rather than special ones, an alternate spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD can be used.</p> <p>If you are using Lickilicky on a stall team, he can work as a great lure for Fighting-types, using Toxic as they switch in and then switching out to a Fighting-type counter. Lickilicky is a great stop to most of the special attacking Pokemon of UU, taking only 39.9% - 46.9% from a Choice Specs Alakazam's Psychic and KOing it with Return. Lickilicky must be wary of Focus Blast from Alakazam, but is capable of surviving a Choice Specs Alakazam's Focus Blast from full health.</p> <p>Even though Lickilicky is more physically bulky than Chansey and Clefable, Fighting-types are still the bane of Lickilicky's existence. In order to be successful, Lickilicky must have teammates who can counter them with ease. Rotom or Mismagius make good switch-ins to most of the Fighting-types of UU; however, they must be wary of any Dark-type moves Fighting-types may carry. If using Rotom or Mismagius as a teammate, using Will-O-Wisp is not advised since the burn prevents Lickilicky from poisoning the opposing Pokemon. Instead, Rotom or Mismagius should use Substitute to stall for Toxic damage and to scout the opponent's next move. Lickilicky also has no way of damaging any of the Steel-types of UU with this set, so Pokemon who can dispose of them, such as Arcanine or Hitmontop, make good partners.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Lickilicky's great natural bulk, incredible movepool, and respectable Attack stat, he can pull off a Swords Dance set pretty efficiently. Return is an incredibly high-powered move after a Swords Dance boost and is the main weapon in this set. Power Whip helps Lickilicky KO Rock-type Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Regirock and keeps Milotic in check. Aqua Tail, however, is also a viable option, providing perfect neutral coverage alongside Return, bar Shedinja. The given EV spread will allow Lickilicky to outspeed standard Rhyperior, Registeel, and Weezing. However, the main attraction of this set is a Swords Dance-boosted Explosion. After a Swords Dance boost, Lickilicky even does 70% minimum to Choice Band Aggron.</p> <p>Wish is also a usable move in the last slot to fake a support set or to prolong your own sweeps. An alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 160 Def / 96 SpD can be used to increase Lickilicky's overall bulk, letting him take some more hits. With this EV spread, Lickilicky is never OHKOed by Rhyperior's Stone Edge or Choice Specs Sceptile's Leaf Storm. Another alternate EV spread is 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with a Jolly Nature, allowing Lickilicky to speed tie with Jolly Aggron and other positive nature base 50s as well as neutral base 60s. Earthquake is also usable in the last slot if Registeel and Fire-types like Arcanine are giving you trouble. Lastly, Substitute can be used in the final slot instead of Explosion or Wish to help Lickilicky set up more easily, while also protecting him from status.</p> <p>Since Ghosts are a huge problem for this set, Houndoom makes an excellent partner due to his ability to trap them. If running Power Whip instead of Aqua Tail, then Steels will be rather troublesome. Dugtrio and Arcanine make good partners for taking out these threats. Donphan is also a good partner for spinning away hazards and setting up Stealth Rock. If Lickilicky is using Power Whip instead of Aqua Tail, then Registeel and Magneton are excellent counters. Aggron can also shrug off a +2 Power Whip and hit back with a powerful Head Smash. Hitmontop is a good check to this set thanks to Intimidate and STAB Close Combat, but has difficulty switching in.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Lickilicky's biggest asset is his movepool. This set provides Lickilicky with great type coverage and amazing stallbreaking capabilities. He is capable of luring in and denting many important tanks in UU, such as Chansey, Registeel, and Milotic. Thankfully, this set has many options; it can be tailor-made to fit almost any team. Explosion is a good last-ditch move and will dent anyone who comes in who isn't a Ghost-type. Lickilicky also has access to the Thunderbolt / Ice Beam combo, but Power Whip and Fire Blast will generally be better as they hit more of the top threats of UU for super effective damage and have a higher damage output.</p> <p>The EVs are designed to ensure a 2HKO on Chansey with Return, 2HKOs on 252/0 Registeel and Weezing with Fire Blast (after Stealth Rock), and a 2HKO on Milotic with Power Whip. The nature is Brave as Lickilicky wants as much bulk as he can get, leaving him with no room for Speed investment. For this reason, it should be noted that Lickilicky will be slower than almost all of the base 50s in UU, leaving him exposed to status.</p> <p>With Lickilicky exposed to all forms of status, a cleric, such as Altaria, is recommended as a teammate. Altaria also makes a good Fighting-type counter and enjoys Lickilicky's ability to switch into Milotic's Ice Beam. Lickilicky also lacks any form of recovery with this set, so a Wish passer, such as Leafeon or Gardevoir, is also recommended as a partner. Lickilicky has just enough bulk to avoid a 2HKO from all of the walls mentioned above; however, if Stealth Rock is in play, Lickilicky's survival rate is greatly reduced, so including a Rapid Spinner on the team is a good idea. Some good Rapid Spinners to pair with Lickilicky include Claydol and Blastoise. Lickilicky also enjoys Stealth Rock on the opposite side of the field as it ensures he can obtain a 2HKO on Milotic and Registeel and an OHKO on Rhyperior.</p> <p>Any sweeper that is stopped by a wall in UU benefits from this set. Nasty Plot Mismagius or Alakazam love to have Registeel and Chansey out of the picture, Fire-types such as Arcanine or Moltres enjoy Milotic removed from play, and Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee or Hariyama like Weezing out of the way.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Whereas the Swords Dance set aims to boost your damage output and then sweep, this set aims to punch holes in the opposing team and to do more immediate damage. This set uses Lickilicky's movepool to its full potential, exploiting his amazing type coverage at the cost of being locked into one move. Thanks to Lickilicky's great natural bulk, he can switch into neutral hits fairly consistently and fire off his high-powered attacks.</p> <p>The choice of Explosion or Fire Punch is really dependent on what your team is more concerned with. If Steel-types are more of a problem, especially Registeel, then Fire Punch is worth carrying in place of Explosion. Explosion, on the other hand, will hit just about everything except Ghosts and defensive Steels for a large chunk of damage. Thanks to Lickilicky's large HP stat and solid defenses, Double-Edge is an option over Return if you really want that 27 extra Base Power when accounting for STAB.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Choice Band will lock you into whatever move you choose, likely causing Lickilicky to have to switch out many times, meaning that Spikes and Stealth Rock will be a problem. Due to this inconvenience, a Rapid Spinner is welcome to clear these hazards from the field. Claydol is a good choice because it resists Lickilicky's sole Fighting-type weakness. Donphan is also a good candidate because of his naturally high Defense.</p>"
      },
      "Curse": {
        "description": "<p>As a Curse user, Lickilicky faces competition from other Cursers in UU, such as Registeel, Steelix, Cradily, and Miltank. However, Lickilicky offers a few perks over his competition. The first is the element of surprise, as your opponent can never know which set your Lickilicky will be utilizing. The second is that Lickilicky offers only one weakness and a higher Special Defense stat than his fellow Normal-type Curser Miltank. Lastly, Lickilicky gets nearly perfect coverage in two moves; the combination of Water / Normal is only resisted by Shedinja in UU. The major downside to using Lickilicky is his lack of reliable recovery.</p> <p>The EVs are designed to give Lickilicky the maximum amount of Special Defense possible, as he will be raising his Defense stat with Curse. The odd looking Defense EVs allow Lickilicky to survive a Life Orb Blaziken's Superpower or a TechniTop's Close Combat after only one Curse, KOing Blaziken in return with Aqua Tail and dealing 49.3% - 58.2% to TechniTop with Return.</p> <p>When using Curse Lickilicky, it is best to switch into a weak attacker that poses little threat to him, such as Chansey or Spiritomb, and begin to accumulate Curse boosts. However, you should also keep Lickilicky hidden until later in the match to be sure that the really strong hitters such as Hitmonlee, Rhyperior, and Alakazam have been eliminated from the opposing team. This Lickilicky set is more situational than the other sets, as it performs far better against stall or balanced teams than against heavily offensive teams.</p> <p>Rest is Lickilicky's main form of recovery and heals any status conditions Lickilicky may encounter, particularly burn and poison. Using Rest without Sleep Talk is a little risky though, as it leaves Lickilicky completely exposed to enemies who can set up and KO Lickilicky while he's asleep. Wish can be used instead, but leaves Lickilicky no way of curing status conditions. Also, without Protect, the one turn gap between using Wish and getting healed could be the difference between life and death. If coverage isn't an issue, then Aqua Tail can be replaced with Sleep Talk or Explosion to either give Lickilicky more survivability or to allow Lickilicky to go out with a bang. However, using Return as the only attack will leave Lickilicky utterly walled by Ghost-, Steel-, and Rock-types.</p> <p>Lickilicky's most hated enemies when using this set are Mismagius and Spiritomb with both Taunt and Will-O-Wisp, as they can burn Lickilicky and then Taunt him to prevent him from healing with Rest. Thus, Pokemon such as Skuntank or Spiritomb who can remove these pesky Ghost-types make good teammates for Curse Lickilicky. Registeel poses another obstacle to Lickilicky, as even at +6 Lickilicky will fail to 2HKO with Aqua Tail. In the meantime, Registeel is free to Thunder Wave Lickilicky and start to paraflinch with Iron Head, or worse, set up Curse itself. Teammates such as Rhyperior or Dugtrio are recommended to ensure Lickilicky can sweep unhindered.</p>"

  "Rhyperior": {
    "overview": "<p>Rhyperior is one of the most terrifying Pokemon in the metagame due to its excellent coverage and monstrous Attack stat. Rhyperior also boasts one of the most impressive HP stats, as well as excellent physical Defense, making it a great physical check. Rhyperior's ability (Solid Rock) is also quite impressive, as it allows Rhyperior to take some super effective attacks that other Pokemon could only dream of taking, such as Blaziken's Superpower.</p> <p>Rhyperior's main problem is that it has very low Special Defense and two very common 4x weaknesses. Furthermore, these attacks are common on the more defensive Pokemon with whom Rhyperior already has trouble. However, when you give Rhyperior the needed support, it can be a huge asset to your team. If you're looking for a bulky Pokemon who can sweep late game, set up Stealth Rock, or simply just hit hard, try Rhyperior.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic can be used over Stealth Rock or Megahorn on the sandstorm or Standard set. With Rhyperior's switch-ins never being Steel- or Poison-types, it will be able to spread Toxic quite effectively.</p> <p>A RestTalk set is also viable if you want to counter Pokemon such as Arcanine who rely on Will-O-Wisp to cripple Rhyperior. With sandstorm support, Rhyperior will be especially hard to take down. However, this is better left to Pokemon such as Regirock or Registeel who don't have those brutal 4x weaknesses and can utilize Curse with more desirable results.</p> <p>Most Rhyperior sets will want to have maximum Attack or at least close to it. The defensive set is an exception to this since it wants to boost its defenses as high as possible.</p> <p>Rhyperior needs to run 128 Speed to outspeed Omastar, but you can drop down to 84 to just outspeed Donphan, Registeel, Tangrowth, and other base 50s. With max Speed and a Jolly nature, Rhyperior can outpace minimum Speed Blastoise and tie with the no Speed base 80s before a Rock Polish. After a Rock Polish, it will outpace the whole metagame minus Electrode and the faster Scarfers. A Brave nature with minimum Speed is ideal for Trick Room teams, however, since Rhyperior will be one of the \"fastest\" Trick Room sweepers with its Speed that low.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Blastoise can switch into most Rhyperior quite easily and OHKO it with Surf. Defensive Grass-types such as Meganium, Leafeon, and Tangrowth also work quite well, but they need to be wary of Megahorn. Claydol and Torterra are excellent counters as well, since they can easily switch into Rhyperior on any of its STAB attacks. However, similarly to Grass-types, they need to watch out for Megahorn.</p> <p>After a Rock Polish, lots of would-be revenge killers such as Sceptile are outsped, so carrying a faster revenge killer is a good idea. Pokemon such as Azumarill, Kabutops, Blaziken, and Toxicroak are all viable revenge killers due to their super effective priority attacks. Choice Scarf users with Water- or Grass-type attacks also work quite well, as long as they are faster than neutral base 80 Speed Pokemon.</p>",

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Rhyperior is one of the most fearsome Pokemon in UU with its monstrous Attack stat. This makes it quite easy for Rhyperior to force switches, giving it time to set up Stealth Rock or Substitute. Once Stealth Rock is in play, Rhyperior makes a great check to almost every physical attacker, as long as they don't have a strong super effective STAB attack. Earthquake and Stone Edge provide Rhyperior with nearly perfect coverage. Add Megahorn to that, and there isn't much that can safely switch into Rhyperior. Rock Blast can be used over Stone Edge to deal with pesky Substitute users such as Moltres, Articuno, and Mismagius.</p> <p>The EVs are very particular since Rhyperior needs to function in a lot of situations. The 84 Speed EVs give Rhyperior the ability to outpace no Speed base 50s, such as Azumarill and Donphan. The 140 HP EVs gives Rhyperior an HP stat of 406, which allows it to create five 101 HP Substitutes from full health. Attack is maximized, and the remaining EVs are put in Defense to make the most of Rhyperior's Solid Rock ability. If using Substitute, Rhyperior can use 164 Speed EVs so that it outpaces minimum Speed Weezing, allowing it to Substitute before Weezing can use Will-O-Wisp. This results in a final spread of 140 HP / 204 Atk / 164 Spe.</p> <p>This set is great at beating Rapid Spin users who try to come in and Spin away Rhyperior's Stealth Rock. Donphan and Hitmontop are 2HKOed by Earthquake with Spikes support, Cloyster is taken care of by Stone Edge, and Claydol is hit hard by Megahorn. This means Pokemon such as Qwilfish and Cloyster who set up Spikes appreciate Rhyperior's presence on a team. They work especially well since with Spikes support, Rhyperior can 2HKO Blastoise, who is another common Rapid Spinner. Cloyster and Qwilfish can also set up on bulky Water-types such as Milotic who threaten Rhyperior.</p> <p>Rhyperior is also a stellar physical wall, especially when against Pokemon without a super effective STAB attack. Using a specially defensive Altaria with Rhyperior works as an effective walling duo, since Altaria resists Water-, Fighting-, Ground-, and Grass-type attacks that would normally destroy Rhyperior, while Rhyperior can take Rock-type attacks and any hard-hitting physical attacker. Ice-type is left uncovered, so using something like Azumarill is beneficial as well.</p>"

The idea when using SubPerior is to switch into a Pokemon that poses little threat, such as Chansey, Registeel, or Swellow, create a Substitute as it switches out, and proceed to nail the switch-in with the appropriate coverage move. Stone Edge and Earthquake are Rhyperior's strongest STAB moves and create the EdgeQuake combination, which is resisted only by Torterra and Claydol in UU. Megahorn rounds off the set, nailing the aforementioned Pokemon for super effective damage, as well as piercing through Uxie and Exeggutor.</p> <p>SubPerior's main goals are to force switches, get free hits on Pokemon when behind a Substitute, and punch holes through the opposing team to open a sweep for a partner. The beauty of using SubPerior over Rhyperior's other sets is that Substitute blocks Will-O-Wisp from pesky opponents such as Spiritomb and Weezing, and it protects Rhyperior from mispredictions should you incorrectly guess the opposing Pokemon's set.</p> <p>The EV spread is designed to allow Rhyperior to create 101 HP Substitutes and to outrun minimum Speed Weezing and Clefable, with the rest of the EVs dumped into Attack. While an alternative offensive spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe can be used to put more pressure on the opponent, using such a spread takes away Rhyperior's ability to create 101 HP Substitutes and freely set up on Seismic Toss Chansey and Clefable. Leftovers is the recommended item to regain the health lost from creating Substitutes. Life Orb can be used, though Rhyperior's HP will be quickly drained from the combination of Substitute, Life Orb, and potential entry hazard damage. Ice Punch or Avalanche can be used over Megahorn for a reliable way to smack Grass-types for super effective damage; however, the lost damage output on Uxie and Mesprit is highly disappointing.</p> <p>Milotic is a hard stop to this set, as Rhyperior lacks the power to 2HKO it with Earthquake. Venusaur and offensive Lanturn therefore make great partners due to their ability to plow right through Milotic. Venusaur also has the added benefit of absorbing Toxic Spikes and Toxic, which completely ruin this set's effectiveness, as well as resisting any Grass- and Fighting-type attacks aimed at Rhyperior. In return, Rhyperior walks all over Chansey, Clefable, and Registeel, and should Rhyperior safely set up a Substitute, it can eliminate Altaria and Moltres with ease.</p> <p>This set absolutely loves paralysis support, as it allows Rhyperior to create Substitutes against faster foes, such as Ambipom, Kangaskhan, and Scyther, and possibly proceed to sweep the opponent's team. Rhyperior has an easy time OHKOing paralyzed Venusaur, Moltres, Sceptile, and Omastar, all of whom normally outpace it, with the appropriate attacking move. Awesome teammates to provide paralysis include Slowbro, Slowking, Registeel, and Uxie. Registeel and Uxie can also provide Stealth Rock support, while Slowbro and Slowking can utilize Trick Room to aid Rhyperior against faster, non-paralyzed foes. Finally, Rhyperior enjoys Wish and cleric support to keep it healthy and free of status. Teammates that can provide said support are Clefable, Leafeon, and Vileplume.</p>"

      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<p>Rhyperior is often unable to pull off sweeps because of its horrible Speed; however, Rock Polish attempts to fix that problem. With a Jolly nature, Rhyperior will outrun all unboosted Pokemon in UU minus Electrode. Boasting an Attack stat of 379 (not including Life Orb), Rhyperior will still hit incredibly hard. The premise of this set is to use Rhyperior's incredibly hard-hitting attacks to weaken its counters and then sweep late game with a Rock Polish boost. The biggest difference between the previous set and this set (besides Rock Polish) is that it uses Life Orb. With a Life Orb boost, Earthquake 2HKOes bulky Pokemon such as Blastoise and Milotic as long as Stealth Rock is in play. Megahorn now comes close to OHKOing Claydol, while also 2HKOing Tangrowth and Slowbro.</p> <p>An alternative item (and strategy) for this Rhyperior set is to use a Passho Berry. Passho Berry allows Rhyperior to take an extra Water-type attack from Pokemon such as Blastoise or Milotic. This means that you don't have to rely on weakening them as much. Passho Berry also protects you from Aqua Jet, which is used by Azumarill, Kabutops, and Feraligatr. However, without a Life Orb, Rhyperior isn't going to have as much of an easy time sweeping, and it also loses important KOs on Milotic, Blastoise, Claydol, and Slowbro.</p> <p>This Rhyperior set benefits from Stealth Rock and Spikes support more than most of the other sets would, since it's pulling off a late game sweep. Cloyster is a good candidate to set up Spikes, since it can set up on the bulky Water-types who will come in on Rhyperior. Qwilfish is also a good candidate since it possesses neutrality to Grass-type attacks in addition to its Water-type resistance. Rhyperior also appreciates Reflect and Light Screen support since these barriers allow it to set up quite easily while also being able to brush off most priority attacks.</p> <p>Besides screens, Stealth Rock, and Spikes, Rhyperior really appreciates the removal of certain Choice Scarf and priority users, since they will easily outpace Rhyperior even after a Rock Polish boost. Venusaur is a major threat to Rhyperior since it threatens to OHKO with its STAB Leaf Storm. Having a Pokemon such as Moltres who can easily dispose of these Choice Scarf users is very beneficial for Rhyperior. There are also many Pokemon who carry priority moves that halt Rhyperior's sweep. Vacuum Wave and Aqua Jet in particular cause problems for Rhyperior since they are both super effective, and Vacuum Wave hits Rhyperior's much weaker Special Defense stat, while Rhyperior has a 4x weakness to Aqua Jet. Vacuum Wave is usually only seen on Pokemon such as Toxicroak and Blaziken, and Dugtrio is a perfect candidate to take them out. Aqua Jet is a little tougher, but Moltres is a great candidate again to lure out these Water-types and hit them hard with Hidden Power. Magmortar and Blaziken can also work, hitting the Aqua Jet users hard with Thunderbolt and Superpower respectively.</p>"
      },
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<p>This set is Rhyperior's most defensive set and focuses on wearing the opponent down and checking prominent threats. With a monstrous HP stat of 432 and Special Defense stat of 312 (with sandstorm active), Rhyperior will be an absolute pain to take down. The EVs are fairly simple: HP is almost maxed until the last obtainable Leftovers number, and then 16 EVs are put into Attack to get the stat jump. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Defense to take special hits better. Rhyperior will be able to take quite a beating from special attacks with these EVs and sandstorm.</p> <p>Earthquake and Stone Edge (or Rock Blast, which can be used to hit Substitute users) give Rhyperior excellent coverage. Megahorn hits everything else that Rock and Ground don't hit, such as Claydol. Even with just 16 Attack EVs, Rhyperior will still hit hard with its 352 Attack stat. The move that works best for your team should be used in the last slot. Rhyperior is a great Stealth Rock user since it forces switches. This also makes it a great entry hazard abuser with Roar, meaning your opponent will take two rounds of residual damage if they switch. If you aren't using (Toxic) Spikes, and if you don't need a Pokemon to set up Stealth Rock, then Rest is a solid choice. Rest allows Rhyperior to heal and rid itself of any status ailments.</p> <p>This set really only functions with sandstorm support, which means Hippopotas is a necessary evil. With Roar, Rhyperior really benefits from Pokemon who can set up Spikes reliably. Cloyster is an excellent choice for this job since it resists Water-type attacks aimed at Rhyperior. Qwilfish is also an exceptional teammate for Rhyperior since it can set up Spikes and resists Water- and Fighting-type attacks. As a bonus, it also only takes neutral damage from Grass-type attacks. Rhyperior also benefits from Toxic Spikes, which both of the listed Pokemon can provide as well.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to break down Rhyperior's usual counters with its Choice Band boosted attacks. Rhyperior can switch into many different attacks because of its impressive bulk, and it can OHKO many common walls such as Omastar and Steelix. On top of this, Rhyperior has immunity to Thunder Wave and shrugs off Pokemon like Registeel's attacks, unlike Aggron, for example, who is easily 2HKOed by Registeel's Earthquake. Unlike the other sets, this set uses Stone Edge as its main attack. This is because being locked into Earthquake usually ends up in a bad situation, considering there are so many Pokemon who are immune to it. Stone Edge has no immunities, and even Pokemon who resist it take quite a bit of damage from it. Aqua Tail and Rock Blast can be used in the last slot as situational moves. Donphan and other Rhyperior are hit by Aqua Tail harder than STAB Earthquake. Rock Blast is a great move for countering Substitute abusing Pokemon.</p> <p>This set's EV spread is specifically made to outpace minimum Speed versions of Weezing and Clefable. Attack is then maximized and the remaining EVs are dumped into HP.</p> <p>The option of Aqua Tail over Rock Blast is simply personal preference. Rock Blast allows you to absolutely destroy SubRoost variants of Moltres and Articuno, as well as nailing Pokemon such as Substitute Mismagius. Aqua Tail will hit Donphan harder than Earthquake (although Earthquake 2HKOes anyway) and will also do major damage to other Rhyperior.</p> <p>While you may be tempted to fire off Earthquakes at every given chance, that is not the best plan when using Rhyperior. Rhyperior's main attack on this set is Stone Edge, especially for early in the game before you know your opponent's team. The reasoning behind this is that no Pokemon is immune to Rock-type attacks, and when you are in a metagame with Pokemon such as Nasty Plot Mismagius, Moltres, Swellow, and Scyther, you definitely don't want to be forced to switch out against them. This especially applies for Scyther and Swellow since Rhyperior is likely your team's only Flying-type resistance. Once you've taken out the Pokemon who can set up on Ground-type attacks, you are free to use Earthquake, which is always bad news for your opponent. This isn't to say that you should never use Earthquake before your opponent's Pokemon are fainted because hitting Pokemon who wall Stone Edge on the switch with a STAB Earthquake can turn the tide of the match as it will usually OHKO that Pokemon. Stone Edge is simply meant to be used as your main attack.</p> <p>This Rhyperior set is an excellent early-game hard-hitter since very few Pokemon can stand up to its onslaught of powerful physical attacks. The fact that only a few Pokemon can take a STAB attack from Rhyperior makes it an excellent lure for bulky Pokemon. Rhyperior can also usually OHKO these Pokemon with its other STAB move. For example, Steelix can switch in and shrug off Rhyperior's Stone Edge. However, if it switches into Earthquake, it will be easily OHKOed. This helps Pokemon such as Swellow and Scyther, because without Steelix in their way, they should have a much easier time sweeping.</p> <p>Rhyperior also greatly benefits from Gravity and paralysis support. With Gravity and paralysis support, Rhyperior can plow through most teams with its powerful STAB Earthquake, since no Pokemon are immune to it. Paralysis support in particular helps Rhyperior sweep late game, since otherwise it will likely be forced out by something faster. Pokemon like Clefable and Porygon2 work quite well with Rhyperior because they have access to both Gravity and Thunder Wave.</p> <p>Rhyperior will also definitely need some defensive support since it is a Choiced Pokemon, meaning it will likely KO something and then be forced out. The two most obvious attack-types that will be used on Rhyperior are Water and Grass. This makes any sort of Grass-type Pokemon an excellent teammate for Rhyperior, especially since as a bonus, they can take Ground-type attacks aimed at Rhyperior as well.</p>"
      },
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>This set focuses on abusing Rhyperior's horrible Speed, monstrous Attack, and excellent coverage under the effects of Trick Room. After Trick Room is used, Rhyperior will usually be the \"fastest\" Pokemon on the field, meaning the opponent needs to survive a 100 Base Power STAB attack before counter-attacking. Additionally, since Rhyperior is so bulky, it can set up Swords Dance and boast an Attack stat of 832, OHKOing the entire metagame.</p> <p>With horrible Speed and an immensely high Attack stat, it is no surprise that Rhyperior is one of the deadliest Trick Room sweepers. The fact that it has perfect coverage from Earthquake, Stone Edge, and Megahorn add to Rhyperior's sweeping capabilities. Swords Dance is a good move to use in the fourth slot since Rhyperior is likely to be bulky enough to pull one off and still have three turns to sweep. After a Swords Dance, Rhyperior will pretty much OHKO the entire tier, and it's no surprise since it will have 832 Attack under its belt. Aqua Tail can be used if you don't like losing a turn of Trick Room to set up Swords Dance, since it hits Donphan and other Rhyperior harder than your other attacks.</p> <p>248 HP EVs ensures that Rhyperior can get an extra attack out of Life Orb while also giving it significant bulk. Attack is maximized to increase Rhyperior's sweeping potential, and the remaining eight EVs are dumped in Defense. A Brave nature is recommended since with a lower Speed, Rhyperior will be \"faster\" in Trick Room.</p> <p>A couple reliable Trick Room set-up Pokemon are needed for this set to function. Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Slowking make great teammates for Rhyperior because of their ability to reliably set up Trick Room. Alakazam is also quite an effective teammate since it can set up Reflect and Light Screen before it uses Trick Room. It can even set up Gravity if you wish. Reflect and Light Screen are important because they allow Rhyperior to almost guarantee itself a Swords Dance, meaning it has up to four turns of straight OHKOing the opponent.</p>"

  "Tangrowth": {
    "overview": "<p>Tangrowth is undisputedly a great Pokemon in UU; it has high HP, good overall defensive stats, and useful offensive stats both physically and specially. On top of that, Tangrowth is one of the few Pokemon that get STAB on Power Whip. It has access to Sleep Powder, Stun Spore, Knock Off, and a great physical and special movepool as well. However, Tangrowth is in an unfortunate position in UU, where its best counters are also the top Pokemon in the tier; Venusaur and Blaziken, among others, can beat it easily one-on-one. The threat from special sweepers in UU is, in general, much greater than that from physical sweepers, and the physical sweepers that are still considered threats can often beat Tangrowth anyway.</p> <p>Don't let this make you feel that Tangrowth is any the worse for wear, though. Tangrowth can still function as a bulky Grass-type and be an annoyance to the opponent thanks to Knock Off, Stun Spore, and Sleep Powder. All the Pokemon listed above hate having these moves used against them. Stealth Rock support makes Tangrowth even better on the field, as many of Tangrowth's counters hate having 25% of their HP chipped off. Tangrowth's potential is such that it can stand its ground with Power Whip and its support moves alone. It also is one of the best Rhyperior checks in the game and one of the only Pokemon in UU that can call a halt to Swords Dance Kabutops in the rain.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>First and foremost, you should use sets that differentiate Tangrowth's from its fellow Grass-types. It is certainly not short of other support options, but often other Pokemon can make better use of them. Block is an interesting move that could be used alongside Sleep Powder and Leech Seed. With Block you can make an \"annoyer\" out of Tangrowth. The problem is that Tangrowth is left with only one move. Knock Off, despite being available from the move tutor, is still a fairly exclusive toy and Tangrowth can use it to great effect, removing items and possibly simultaneously telling you what variant of Pokemon you are facing. Tangrowth can use the popular SubSeed strategy, which is especially useful because Tangrowth can reach the magic 404 HP stat, meaning his Substitutes cannot be broken with Seismic Toss; however, Sceptile and Jumpluff are both faster and thus can perform the strategy more easily. Toxic works on the standard set and is an option over Stun Spore on the Double Powder set. Reflect is an excellent support move for Tangrowth to aid its pals; it's just a pity that Tangrowth doesn't get Light Screen to help out with its dismal Special Defense stat. The only physical move of note not listed in the rest of the analysis is Poison Jab, which is Tangrowth's most powerful physical move against Leafeon and other pure Grass-types but has mediocre coverage after that. Sludge Bomb follows the same logic as Poison Jab; however, it works off of Tangrowth's higher Special Attack stat instead (and with a higher Base Power as well).</p> <p>Tangrowth is generally a defensive Pokemon and should be EVed as such. It is advised that you max out its HP before you work on its defensive stats. 252 Def is advised in UU play, as it is essential to surviving boosted hits from key foes, such as Dragon Dance Feraligatr, but you can branch out into Attack if you feel like the extra power would help. Offensively oriented sets should concentrate on the attacking stat they're using. If you're using Chlorophyll with Sunny Day, 240 speed with Adamant or Modest nature, factoring in the IV drop from Hidden Power Fire, allows Tangrowth to beat neutral Choice Scarf Blaziken, but maximizing Speed is usually the best choice at that point. 228 EVs with a Timid, Jolly or Naive nature beat Modest Scarf Rotom; 232 EVs with a positive nature beat Adamant Rock Polish Torterra after a boost; and max Speed with a positive nature beats Adamant Scarf Primeape and ties with other Tangrowth. Without Chlorophyll, there is very little Tangrowth can outspeed, and you are best off going on the defensive. 29 HP EVs can be used on offensive sets with Life Orb to minimize recoil.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>At first sight, it would appear that the Tangrowth is quite easy to switch into—his STAB has a total of seven types resistant to it, and his coverage moves are fairly weak against neutral targets. However, that is not the case—it is difficult to switch into Tangrowth, mainly because of its great support movepool. Sleep Powder, Stun Spore, and Knock Off are moves that are very difficult to switch into and can cripple a foe for the rest of the battle. Not only that, but since many of Tangrowth's counters are weak to Stealth Rock, Pokemon that switch in will likely be forfeiting a good amount of their health.</p> <p>As far as typing goes, Moltres, Charizard, and Scyther all have 4x resistances to Grass, and all destroy Tangrowth with their STAB moves, but they all have 4x Stealth Rock weaknesses as well, and so cannot switch in more than twice if the rocks are up. Other Grass-types like Venusaur and Sceptile make good counters; Venusaur gets a special mention for having a 4x resistance to Grass, no Stealth Rock weakness, and STAB Sludge Bomb.</p> <p>Other counters include Flying-, Fire-, and Poison-types. Of the Flying-types, Altaria has a 4x resistance to Grass as well as access to special Fire-type attacks and Natural Cure. Swellow can activate its Toxic Orb, making it immune to sleep and paralysis attempts, and it is not bothered by Knock Off if its Orb has already activated. Drifblim has good defensive stats and can put up a Substitute if need be. Fire- and Poison-types need to beware of Earthquake from sweeper Tangrowth; however, they also make good counters should the need arise. Arcanine has Intimidate to let it come in safely and can fry Tangrowth with STAB Flare Blitz. Ninetales, Typhlosion, Blaziken, Magmortar, and Houndoom are other notable checks. Of Poison-types, Weezing is immune to Earthquake, has good defensive stats, and can use STAB Sludge Bomb to beat Tangrowth. Nidoking and Nidoqueen have no Grass resistance but have access to moves like Poison Jab and Ice Beam. Toxicroak can set up in Tangrowth's face with Substitute and/or Swords Dance, but it must beware of Earthquake or sun-boosted Hidden Power Fire. Muk and Drapion also make reasonably good choices.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Tank": {
        "description": "<p>Tangrowth is sometimes considered to be overshadowed by other walls and other Grass-types with which it competes for a spot on a team. However, it has a fantastic support movepool backed up by reliable defensive stats; its overall physical defense is greater than that of Skarmory or Hippowdon; and it has plenty of attacking power both physically and specially. This set best demonstrates uts formidable walling potential alongside the individual moves that support uts claim to fame.</p> <p>Power Whip provides a fairly reliable STAB attack, having 120 Base Power and no negative side effects besides subpar accuracy. Specially, Tangrowth's most notable STAB attack is Leaf Storm, which has the perks of better accuracy and destructive power; however, this does cut its Special Attack massively after just one use, rendering Tangrowth easy setup fodder. Tangrowth also has access to healing moves; Synthesis grants instant 50% recovery and is useful in UU, where all the fully-evolved auto-weather changers are absent. As for complementary moves, Hidden Power Ice can hit Leafeon, Venusaur, Scyther, Swellow, and Altaria for decent damage, while for physical moves, Earthquake is usually the best choice for a coverage move, as it can hit targets such as Drapion, Registeel, and Houndoom for super effective damage. Sleep Powder is a very valuable tool, as it cripples one Pokemon on the opposing team, and Tangrowth is one of the most reliable sleep inducers in UU.</p> <p>When choosing Tangrowth's offensive moves, you should carefully consider which move suits you and your team the best. Power Whip is Tangrowth's most reliable attack, and it does reasonable damage to even neutral targets. Leaf Storm, however, has a number of advantages. It allows Tangrowth to function offensively even when burned and works off its higher offensive stat. It is also guaranteed to OHKO uninvested Absol with Stealth Rock damage, whereas Power Whip only musters around 78% on average. It also OHKOes 252 HP Slowbro, while Power Whip may fail to 2HKO, but on the other hand Power Whip has the ability to 2HKO standard Milotic, which Leaf Storm cannot accomplish. In the last two slots, you should choose a combination of the three moves listed. Sleep Powder has immense utility for Tangrowth and provides a way to cripple Tangrowth's counters, but if you already have a sleep inducer on your team, Tangrowth can forgo it for extra coverage. For Tangrowth's other moves, Earthquake can hit foes such as Blaziken, Toxicroak, and Drapion switching in, while Hidden Power Ice lets Tangrowth take on more dangerous Pokemon such as Venusaur and Altaria. In general, if Tangrowth only uses one coverage attack, Hidden Power Ice is more useful, as it allows it to fully counter Leafeon and other purely physical Grass-types, but you should pick depending on what suits your team best. If Tangrowth is running a mixed set, a Relaxed nature should be used. If you are using a fully physical set, use an Impish nature, and with a special set, run a Bold nature. If you want to use a support move on Tangrowth but already have a sleep inducer, Tangrowth has a number of other good options, most notably Knock Off, Stun Spore, and Leech Seed.</p> <p>The EVs are straightforward, as they maximize Tangrowth's physical bulk. With the given EV spread, Tangrowth reaches 404 HP and 383 Defense, ensuring that +1 Adamant Life Orb Feraligatr, +2 Adamant Leftovers Feraligatr, and Adamant Choice Band Azumarill will never 2HKO with Ice Punch. It also ensures that Adamant Choice Band Kabutops fails to 2HKO with Stone Edge, Adamant Rock Polish Leftovers Rhyperior almost always fails to 2HKO with Megahorn, and Adamant Choice Scarf Hitmonlee has only a small chance to 3HKO with Close Combat. Tangrowth can deal a significant amount back to all of these Pokemon with STAB Power Whip, or cripple them with Sleep Powder.</p> <p>Being a pure Grass-type, Tangrowth is certainly not short of weaknesses to exploit, and most special STAB attacks can deal massive damage due to Tangrowth's low Special Defense. While this Tangrowth is not a sweeper, it is certainly aided greatly by Stealth Rock, which hits four out of the five types that give it trouble (Bug, Fire, Flying, and Ice) for increased damage. In particular, Moltres, Swellow, and Scyther will find it hard to switch in repeatedly. Water- and Rock-types partner well with Tangrowth, as they resist a fair number of its weaknesses; Rock-types such as Regirock get special mention for hitting four of the five types that Tangrowth is weak to for super effective damage and benefiting from Tangrowth's resistances to Water, Grass, and Ground attacks. Poison-types such as Drapion and Toxicroak are more troublesome; Uxie can deal with Toxicroak but falls to Drapion, while the inverse is true for Steel-types such as Steelix.</p>"
      },
      "Double Status": {
        "description": "<p>Double Powder is another interesting way in which Tangrowth can cripple its counters, this time with both sleep and paralysis. Come in on something that fears Tangrowth, such as Choice Scarf Hitmonlee or Choice Band Azumarill locked into Waterfall, then use Sleep Powder on the opponent's Pokemon, and subsequently use Stun Spore on the switch-in. Hopefully, you will catch a foe like Swellow off-guard and effectively neuter two Pokemon.</p> <p>The core difference between this set and the standard physically defensive set is the more offensive orientation of this set; while the standard wall takes hits and deals them back, Double Powder is more aggressively played, with its primary objective being to cripple foes, and after that, to take hits. Because of this, it is generally preferable to forgo a healing move to provide better coverage. Earthquake hits Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-types that may pose Tangrowth problems, while Hidden Power Ice hits Flying-, Dragon-, and other Grass-types. It is best to choose between these two based on its STAB move of choice: Power Whip provides consistent power, while Leaf Storm has better accuracy and comes off Tangrowth's better attacking stat.</p> <p>Since Leaf Storm and Hidden Power are special but Power Whip and Earthquake are physical, it is best to choose one of these pairs to conserve EVs and to avoid forcing Tangrowth to run a Relaxed nature. The EVs are altered from the standard set in keeping with the offensive nature of this set. In particular, 120 EVs are moved to Attack to allow Tangrowth to OHKO frailer sweepers such as Hitmonlee, Alakazam, and Mismagius with Power Whip. It also helps against bulky Water-types, letting it 2HKO all Milotic, Slowbro, and Blastoise, as well as OHKO specially bulky Lanturn and Milotic. In addition, Tangrowth can 2HKO Chansey with Power Whip, and OHKO weakened Blaziken and Toxicroak with Earthquake. If you are running a fully special set, shift the Attack EVs to Special Attack and use a Bold nature to power up Leaf Storm. If you want to run a mixed set, use a Relaxed nature and put Tangrowth's offensive EVs in the same stat as its Grass-type STAB attack.</p> <p>Tangrowth will enjoy all the benefits of Stealth Rock on its counters, but its ability to wall physical threats suffers slightly from the lack of a healing move. The point of this set is to cripple Tangrowth's counters, so teammates that that work well alongside this set. These include Pokemon like Venusaur and Hitmonlee, which can hopefully pull off a sweep with Moltres out of the match.</p> <p>Pokemon that are indifferent to this method of support are unfazed by this set, so slower and bulkier Pokemon that switch into Stun Spore will be very troublesome. This set's biggest foes are Natural Cure Pokemon, which can simply switch out to rid themselves of sleep or paralysis. Altaria has great resistances to both Power Whip and Earthquake and can destroy Tangrowth with Fire Blast. If you are not using Hidden Power Ice, you will need to find a way to get rid of the cloudy menace. Milotic is usually the best answer to special or mixed Altaria, as it can Recover off damage, remove Dragon Dances with Haze, and attack back with Ice Beam. Registeel is also a reasonable answer to most forms of Altaria. If you do use Registeel, however, this can leave you with a large weakness to Fire-type moves, so a Pokemon like Flash Fire Arcanine or Milotic can be a good asset.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Tangrowth is often looked down upon for its miserable base 50 Special Defense stat, which ordinarily makes it extraordinarily weak to special attacks of all descriptions. Therefore, attempting to make use of this stat would seem pointless; however, by investing heavily on the special side, Tangrowth can use its resistances and improved defensive capabilities to decent effect while relying on its immense physical Defense stat, which is formidable even without investment. However, it should be noted that by running this spread, Tangrowth loses the ability to beat extremely strong physical attackers such as Rhyperior and Swords Dance Feraligatr.</p> <p>Once again, Sleep Powder, Stun Spore, and Synthesis are all good support options. Sleep Powder is usually the best option, but if you prefer repeated status or already have a sleep inducer on your team, Stun Spore is worth a look. Leech Seed is also an option if you prefer that method of support. Again, you have to make a serious decision with regard to offensive moves. Power Whip accomplishes the most out of Tangrowth's STAB options, but its comparatively low accuracy can be a turn-off. Leaf Storm is again an option, but it has a number of faults that can make it a worse option. Not only do you only get one shot with it, which is bad especially on a Tangrowth such as this, which relies a great deal on firepower, but Leaf Storm Tangrowth cannot deal with specially defensive Milotic, which is one of the main targets for this set. After one Leaf Storm, Milotic can heal itself with Recover and leave Tangrowth looking useless. Leaf Storm does, however, have the helpful ability to OHKO Slowbro with 120 EVs in Special Attack. Again, Hidden Power Ice and Earthquake are your coverage options; it is usually best to choose the option that works off the same stat as Tangrowth's STAB option to avoid splitting EVs.</p> <p>Tangrowth's Special Defense stat is maximized first because it is much lower than Tangrowth's HP stat, meaning a full investment in Special Defense has greater returns. Tangrowth won't be 2HKOed by bulky Water-types with Ice Beam. It also means that Tangrowth can now survive Timid Mismagius's Nasty Plot-boosted Shadow Ball even with Stealth Rock, and the same rings true for Choice Specs Alakazam's Psychic. The Attack EVs allow Tangrowth to 2HKO Slowbro and Milotic and OHKO Mismagius and Alakazam with Power Whip after Stealth Rock. The leftover EVs are placed in HP. If you would like, you can run 252 HP / 252 SpD in order to maximize Tangrowth's hit taking ability, but this compromises its ability to hit back, making it lose a big advantage over the similar Venusaur. If you decide to run all special attacks, move the offensive EVs to Special Attack and run a Calm nature, and with a mixed set you should run a Sassy nature. With a mixed set, it is advisable that you invest the entirety of Tangrowth's offensive EVs in the same stat as your Grass-type STAB, since the EVs are needed to gain the KOs listed above.</p> <p>Although Tangrowth's ability to take special hits is improved, it still can't deal with a powerful super effective STAB attack, especially a special one. Hence, Moltres, Blaziken, Houndoom, specially inclined Venusaur and Nidoking, and Weezing all remain problems. To counter the large Fire-type weakness, Milotic or another bulky Water-type is a must, though Milotic is preferable mainly because it can reinforce the special side. Registeel can go along to create a powerful defensive core, and it can also deal with various problem Pokemon such as Scyther, Swellow, and Venusaur. Nidoking and Toxicroak remain troublesome; however, Toxicroak loses if it lacks a Poison STAB attack, and Tangrowth has Earthquake. Milotic can also switch into some Nidoking variants if need be. The combination of Milotic and Registeel should also be enough to beat most Altaria, though be careful with the Rest Talk set, as the combination may struggle if Milotic does not have Ice Beam.</p> <p>As this Tangrowth is more offensive than the standard variant, it can be of good use on bulky offense teams as well as on stall teams. Here your partners should be somewhat different: Bulky Drapion can be helpful as a reasonable switch-in to Toxicroak and special Venusaur (which Tangrowth will have the most trouble with). With heavy defensive investment, Drapion can act as a check to most Scyther and Swellow. Not only that, but it also helps to absorb Toxic Spikes, a serious threat to Tangrowth's effectiveness. Arcanine can be useful along with Milotic to complete a Fire / Water / Grass core; specifically, it helps to deal with Grass-types, such as Venusaur and Sceptile, as well as Weezing. Intimidate is also useful to hold down physical attackers which can beat Tangrowth, such as Scyther.</p> <p>As previously mentioned, giving Tangrowth Special Defense instead of Defense EVs sacrifices the ability to defeat certain foes, such as Adamant Rhyperior, which OHKOes this set with Megahorn after entry hazard damage. Again, Milotic should be helpful here to OHKO with Surf if Tangrowth is too weak to stop it. Leafeon, too, can be a problem with Swords Dance-boosted Double-Edge, but Arcanine can neutralize this threat. More powerful Water-types such as Swords Dance Kabutops and Feraligatr also become problematic, although the combination of Tangrowth and your Water-type should cover them for the most part.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>A combination of a respectable Attack stat, access to Swords Dance and Power Whip, and Chlorophyll allow Tangrowth to pull off a Swords Dance set with reasonable success. The core principle of the set is to come in on an ineffective physical attacker, use Swords Dance, and proceed to knock holes in anything Tangrowth can hit. Sceptile has higher Speed, which is useful for this type of set, but Tangrowth has a higher Attack stat and the killer variable, Chlorophyll, which with sun support allows it to plow through teams with Power Whip and Earthquake.</p> <p>Power Whip is Tangrowth's main source of damage and its best STAB move. Earthquake provides the standard coverage move, getting important hits on Poison-, Fire-, and Steel-types. Rock Slide completes Tangrowth's pseudo-EdgeQuake coverage, allowing it to hit Flying-types like Scyther and Moltres. Status moves such as Stun Spore and Sleep Powder are also usable; Stun Spore in particular is important if you want to use this effectively without sun support.</p> <p>An Adamant nature and 252 Speed EVs allows Tangrowth to outrun neutral-natured Choice Scarf Blaziken in the sun, and with a Jolly nature and max Speed EVs this is extended to Adamant Choice Scarf Primeape and other base 95 Pokemon. Life Orb should be used in the sun, since the added power is worth the loss in bulk, while non-sun variants should hold Leftovers, since they appreciate the bulk a lot more. If you do not wish to use Chlorophyll, the advised spread is 240 HP / 232 Atk / 36 Spe to increase hit-taking ability, and to give Tangrowth a chance to hit adversaries with Stun Spore, which is pretty much a mandatory move on non-Chlorophyll variants.</p> <p>Bulky Grass-type Pokemon like Hidden Power Ice Tangrowth can wall this set, since the most effective attack it can use against them is a weak Rock Slide. Sludge Bomb Weezing works in much the same way. Arcanine can use Intimidate to buffer its teammates from Tangrowth's hits, but will be in trouble if Tangrowth keeps using Swords Dance. This set is also far easier to wall if you don't give it sun support; it is then pretty much forced to run Stun Spore, meaning it loses coverage and adds Bug-, Grass-, and Flying-types as solid counters or revenge killers. Rhyperior can be a great help, as it can wall Pokemon like Swellow, while Tangrowth can switch in on Earthquakes aimed at Rhyperior and set up.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Although Tangrowth's base 50 Speed stat makes sweeping seem nearly impossible, this can easily be fixed by Sunny Day support. Thanks to Chlorophyll, Tangrowth's Speed doubles in the sun, allowing it to outspeed most of the UU tier and take advantage of its high attacking stats, if only for a few turns. While offensive Tangrowth is typically seen as a physical attacker with Swords Dance, this set attempts to take advantage of Chlorophyll and the higher of Tangrowth's attacking stats, its Special Attack. Once a teammate sets up Sunny Day, Tangrowth can easily switch into physical attacks and attempt to sweep thanks to its base 125 Defense.</p> <p>Since this Tangrowth relies on the Speed boost from Chlorophyll to be successful, Sunny Day support is absolutely mandatory. Once sun is set up, Sleep Powder should be used first to immediately incapacitate the opponent's first switch-in. With its primary counter asleep and its Speed doubled, Tangrowth can take advantage of its flawless coverage to hit many Pokemon for heavy damage. Solar Beam is a very potent attack, and takes no charge-up to execute in the sun. Hidden Power Fire gets pseudo-STAB from the sun, and Ancient Power provides near flawless coverage. Power Whip may be used over either Sleep Powder or Hidden Power Fire as a last-ditch attempt to topple opposing special walls, such as Chansey, which would otherwise wall Tangrowth; though it provides no extra coverage and seems fairly situational, its wallbreaking capabilities alone make Power Whip worthy of consideration.</p> <p>The EV spread is fairly simple and straightforward. First, Special Attack is maxed out in order to let Tangrowth hit as hard as possible. Then, 224 Speed EVs are used, allowing Tangrowth to outspeed Jolly Swellow, the fastest non-Choice Scarf Pokemon in UU, after the Chlorophyll boost. The remaining EVs are then put in HP to give Tangrowth a bit of extra bulk. An alternative EV spread of 32 Atk / 252 SpA / 224 Spe with a Rash nature should be used if Tangrowth is running Power Whip.</p> <p>Some damage calculations that demonstrate how Tangrowth deals with some common switch-ins:</p> <ul> <li>Ancient Power vs. 120 HP / 0 SpD Arcanine: 57.4%-67.8%</li> <li>Ancient Power vs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Altaria: 54.3%-64.6%</li> <li>Ancient Power vs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Houndoom: 68.7%-81.1%</li> <li>Ancient Power vs. 248 HP / 0 SpD Moltres: 100.3%-118%</li> <li>Ancient Power vs. 224 HP / 0 SpD Scyther: 142.3%-168%</li> <li>Ancient Power vs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Swellow: 109.6%-129.5%</li> <li>Power Whip vs. 0 HP / 252 SpD Chansey: 58.5%-69%</li> </ul> <p>Many common Tangrowth counters are weak to Rock-type attacks, meaning that they are either OHKOed or 2HKOed by Ancient Power. Chansey is included in the calculations, as it is arguably the best special wall in UU; however, it is easily 2HKOed by Power Whip. This set may not be able to boost up, but it can hit hard right off the bat and does not have to worry about setting up again each time it switches in and out.</p> <p>As far as offensive teammates go, it's hard to beat physical Life Orb Arcanine. Not only does it resist Tangrowth's Fire-, Bug-, and Ice-type weaknesses, but it is also capable of taking advantage of the sun support that this Tangrowth loves. STAB Flare Blitz in the sun will easily smash Registeel and Venusaur, both of which this set has trouble with. Its physical attacking prowess greatly complements the special attacking power of Tangrowth. Houndoom works similarly, but it tends to be specially based and is walled by Chansey, which also walls Tangrowth lacking Power Whip. However, Houndoom's access to Nasty Plot compensates for this, allowing it to break some special walls under appropriate circumstances. Blaziken also fits nicely on a team with Tangrowth for much the same reason as Arcanine. Fire-types in general tend to work especially well with Tangrowth, as they can counter most of the common Pokemon that can wall this Tangrowth and benefit from the sun. As for defensive partners, Registeel may well be the best available to partner with this Tangrowth. Registeel can paralyze enemies with Thunder Wave, which helps when Sunny Day runs out and set up both Stealth Rock and Sunny Day. Registeel can also use Explosion to take out a counter Tangrowth didn't put to sleep. Registeel is also resistant or immune to the Ice-, Bug-, Flying-, and Poison-type attacks that plague Tangrowth, allowing it to easily switch in if Tangrowth is in danger of being KOed. Finally, as specially defensive Arcanine completely counters this set, especially in the sun, consider a Water-type partner like offensive Milotic to switch in and keep pressure high. Be forewarned, however, that Water-type attacks are weakened in sunny conditions, so other responses to specially defensive Arcanine may be necessary. Despite that, Water-types have excellent type synergy with Tangrowth and a Fire-type, giving you lots of freedom to switch as needed.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>With proper support, Tangrowth can make a fearsome mixed sweeper in UU, with powerful STAB and coverage options backed up by solid base 100 Attack and 110 Special Attack. Tangrowth should be paired with sun support to activate its Chlorophyll ability, allowing it to outrun everyone up to and including Modest Scarf Rotom. It also boosts the power of Hidden Power Fire, but it is advised that Tangrowth should not run Sunny Day himself in the interest of type coverage.</p> <p>Power Whip is the preferred STAB move, since it hits nearly everyone of significance harder than Grass Knot, with a few small exceptions such as Cloyster and Slowbro, which are 2HKOed anyway. If you're prepared to take a little risk for the best of both worlds, Solar Beam is always an option, since it has Power Whip's Base Power combined with Grass Knot's accuracy and comes off Tangrowth's higher Special Attack stat. Solar Beam also OHKOes Milotic after Stealth Rock damage. It is also blessed by the absence of the fully evolved instant-weather Pokemon in UU, so the chance of the sun being banished and Tangrowth being locked into a weakened Solar Beam is low. Using Solar Beam or Grass Knot over Power Whip, however, will make Chansey far more of an issue. In the way of coverage, Hidden Power Fire gets a boost from the sun and hits Grass-, Bug- and Steel-types, while Earthquake gets super effective coverage on Fire-, Poison- and Steel-types. Thus five of the seven types resistant to Grass are covered, with the final two being Dragon and Flying. The only common UU Dragon-type is Altaria, which is also part Flying. To deal with these Flying-types, the best choice is really Rock Slide, which will also hit Fire- and Bug-types for super effective damage, however it will fail to OHKO a min/min Altaria even after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Lastly, Sleep Powder is always an option to cripple a troublesome foe. 29 HP IVs are given to minimize Life Orb recoil. The EVs and nature grant sufficient Speed to outrun Modest Choice Scarf Rotom and Adamant Rock Polish Torterra after a boost, factoring in the Speed drop from Hidden Power Fire. The remaining EVs are split as necessary between the two attacking stats.</p> <p>Sun support is required with this set. Most of the standard rain leads, including Ambipom and Uxie, can perform the same trick with Sunny Day. Regirock has great offensive and defensive synergy with Tangrowth and other sun sweepers, as it resists Fire- and Flying-type attacks and can Explode on troublesome bulky Pokemon. As with any sweeper, Stealth Rock is critical support, but it is especially useful to ensure that Tangrowth can OHKO Fire- and Flying-types with its coverage attacks lest they survive and OHKO it in return. Thus, a Ghost-type such as Mismagius is recommended to block Rapid Spin. Also, heavily defensive Pokemon such as Uxie can come in, survive a hit and use Psychic or U-turn for a large amount of damage, while Tangrowth can do nothing significant back. In this situation Houndoom can be a good partner, absorbing Psychic attacks and benefiting from the sun itself.</p>"

  "Magmortar": {
    "overview": "<p>With excellent offensive stats and a decent movepool, Magmortar can be a huge threat in UU. However, it's cursed with being a Fire-type, thus losing 25% of its health to Stealth Rock upon switching in. Magmortar's Speed is also only average, leaving it vulnerable to faster sweepers, provided that they can switch in safely. What sets Magmortar apart from other Fire-types like Blaziken and Typhlosion is its access to Thunderbolt, which gives it an easier time against bulky Water-types like Slowbro. As long as one can get around Magmortar's weaknesses, it makes an effective sweeper.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Magmortar has an amazing movepool filled with many viable options. With Will-O-Wisp, Magmortar can burn physical threats more reliably than by using Lava Plume. Taunt can be used to stop any opponent who attempts to set up on Magmortar or cripple it with status moves. A Sunny Day + Solar Beam set can be used to some success, but Magmortar's average Speed can make this difficult. Psychic is available to hit Fighting-types like Hitmontop and Blaziken super effectively, though it provides little coverage compared to other moves. Magmortar can utilize a Choice Band set thanks to its decent physical movepool consisting of Cross Chop, Earthquake, Thunder Punch, and Fire Punch, but Blaziken does this better due to its higher Attack and Fighting STAB. Mach Punch may be used for priority, allowing Magmortar to overcome its Speed issue. Belly Drum is a gimmicky option for Magmortar and it can have a huge payoff at the cost of major team support; however, Magmortar is unable to utilize Mach Punch along with Belly Drum due to legality issues, greatly lowering the effectiveness of the set. Using a SubSalac set is also an option, though it's very risky due to the prevalence of Stealth Rock and priority users.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Due to its huge Special Attack and threatening movepool, Magmortar is quite difficult to counter. The best way to defeat Magmortar is to figure out what set it's running and predict accordingly. Bulky Water-types such as Lanturn, Milotic, and Azumarill are great initial switch-ins to Magmortar. Lanturn is an excellent counter due to its immunity to Thunderbolt, thanks to Volt Absorb, resistance to Fire-type moves, great overall bulk, and access to STAB Surf to hit Magmortar super effectively. Milotic can switch into Fire Blast, survive the incoming Thunderbolt, and then strike Magmortar back super effectively with STAB Surf. Azumarill can switch into any Fire-type moves and hit Magmortar with Aqua Jet before it gets a chance to attack. With Sandstorm support, Regirock is a decent counter as it takes little damage from Magmortar's special attacks due to its boosted Special Defense, and can smash Magmortar with STAB Rock-typed attacks.</p> <p>Altaria makes a great counter to Magmortar without Hidden Power Ice courtesy of its great defensive stats, resistances to Fighting- and Fire-type moves, neutrality to Thunderbolt, and access to Earthquake. Chansey can take on any set without physical attacks thanks to its high special bulk. It can cripple Magmortar with Thunder Wave and weaken it with Seismic Toss, but it must beware of taking too many hits from Focus Blast. Hariyama is a solid counter as it takes reduced damage from Magmortar's STAB Fire-type moves thanks to Thick Fat, and its high HP and decent defenses make it hard to take down with any other move. Hariyama can then proceed to destroy Magmortar with Stone Edge.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Magmortar's greatest strength lies in its ability to deal with both the physical and special walls of UU, thanks to its sky-high base 125 Special Attack and solid base 95 Attack. These are backed by Magmortar's extremely diverse movepool and the 1.3x power boost from Life Orb, turning Magmortar into a mixed attacker who can blast through the strongest walls of UU.</p> <p>Fire Blast is Magmortar's main STAB move that can deal deadly damage to almost every Pokemon who doesn't resist it. Thunderbolt is an ideal move on Magmortar, as it OHKOes Moltres and gives Magmortar coverage over bulky Water-types. The third slot is chosen based on personal preference. Hidden Power Grass is usually the more reliable option because it allows Magmortar to hit a wider range of Pokemon, including Rhyperior and the Ground-types who would otherwise wall this set. It is also Magmortar's strongest move against Lanturn. Hidden Power Ice is the other alternative; while the only notable Pokemon it hits is Altaria, it still scores super effective hits on Ground-types (however, it doesn't OHKO Rhyperior), making it a good alternative option. The last move, Cross Chop, allows Magmortar to destroy Chansey, who would otherwise wall this set completely. With Stealth Rock in play, the combination of Fire Blast and Cross Chop has a high chance of KOing it. Cross Chop also OHKOes Houndoom, another troublesome Pokemon.</p> <p>A Speed-boosting nature is chosen for this set, as it allows Magmortar to outspeed Milotic, Feraligatr, and all max Speed Pokemon with Base 80 Speed and a positive nature, including Venusaur and Blaziken. The choice of nature depends on what you want Magmortar to take less damage from. A Naive nature allows Magmortar to take less damage from physical priority attacks (such as Fake Out or Mach Punch), while a Hasty nature allows Magmortar to take less from special attacks like Leaf Storm. Life Orb is the item of choice on this set, allowing Magmortar to switch freely between attacks and give it a welcomed power boost. Here are some damage calculations demonstrating the power of this Magmortar:</p> <h6>Damage Calculations</h6> <ul> <li>Fire Blast vs. 52 HP / 0 SpD Adamant Donphan - 109.71% - 131.44%</li> <li>Fire Blast vs. 252 HP / 240 SpD Bold Weezing - 73.95% - 87.42%</li> <li>Fire Blast vs. 252 HP / 216 SpD Careful Registeel - 74.17% - 87.91%</li> <li>Fire Blast vs. 252 HP / 0 SpD Bold Claydol - 65.12% - 77.16%</li> <li>Fire Blast vs. 252 HP / 116 SpD Careful Spiritomb - 61.51% - 73.02%</li> <li>Fire Blast vs. 252 HP / 100 SpD Calm Clefable - 55.58% - 65.48%</li> <li>Fire Blast vs. 0 HP / 252 SpD Calm Chansey - 26.83% - 31.82%</li> <li>Thunderbolt vs. 252 HP / 4 SpD Bold Slowbro - 79.18% - 93.40%</li> <li>Thunderbolt vs. 248 HP / 0 SpD Bold Milotic - 54.96% - 65.13%</li> <li>Thunderbolt vs. 252 HP / 56 SpD Calm Milotic - 47.20% - 55.83%</li> <li>Thunderbolt vs. 252 HP / 4 SpD Bold Blastoise - 69.06% - 81.76%</li> <li>Thunderbolt vs. 252 HP / 252 SpD Bold Cloyster - 107.23% - 126.31%</li> <li>Hidden Power Grass vs. 136 HP / 0 SpD Adamant Rhyperior - 115.55% - 136.29%</li> <li>Hidden Power Grass vs. 252 HP / 252 SpD Careful Quagsire - 91.37% - 108.62%</li> <li>Hidden Power Grass vs. 40 HP / 252 SpD Calm Lanturn - 41.39% - 48.87%</li> <li>Cross Chop vs. 0 HP / 252 Def Calm Chansey - 61.15% - 72.07%</li> </ul> <p>These calculations effectively portray Magmortar's raw power. Any of these Pokemon who switches into Fire Blast is then KOed by one of Magmortar's coverage moves (with the sole exception of Lanturn). For example, if a physically defensive Milotic switches in on Fire Blast, it is then KOed by Thunderbolt (assuming Stealth Rock is up). The calculations also show the importance of Stealth Rock, which allows Magmortar to gain some very important OHKOs and 2HKOs.</p> <p>Despite its excellent attacking prowess, this Magmortar generally has a short lifespan. Stealth Rock chips off a whopping 25% of Magmortar's health every time it switches in. This, coupled with recoil damage from Life Orb, can often lead to Magmortar's early demise. Therefore, Rapid Spin support is invaluable to Magmortar, as it allows Magmortar to switch in much more freely in order to fire off its powerful attacks. The two Rapid Spinners who have the greatest synergy with Magmortar are Claydol and Blastoise. Claydol can switch into Ground- and Rock-type attacks aimed at Magmortar, spin away entry hazards, and then proceed to set up Stealth Rock to aid Magmortar. Blastoise also makes a great partner to Magmortar because it can come in on Water- and Fire-type attacks easily; moreover, it has access to Foresight, which allows it to spin on Ghost-types. Wish support from the likes of Leafeon and Chansey is also greatly appreciated by Magmortar, since it can restore health lost due to entry hazards, Life Orb recoil, and other forms of residual damage.</p> <p>Magmortar pairs well with Pokemon who either defensively complement it or take advantage of the large holes that Magmortar can punch into the opposing team. Toxicroak makes a great partner to Magmortar, as it can come in on Water-type attacks directed at Magmortar, set up Swords Dance or Nasty Plot, and attempt to sweep. Thanks to its typing and ability, Toxicroak can also come in on numerous priority attacks, such as Aqua Jet or Mach Punch, which greatly threaten Magmortar. Physical variants of Toxicroak often lure in Will-O-Wisp users, such as Spiritomb, whom Magmortar can freely switch into. Due to its ability to eliminate bulky Waters with Thunderbolt, Magmortar can open up opportunities for Pokemon such as Rock Polish Rhyperior to sweep. Rhyperior can also come in on Thunder Wave from defensive Pokemon whom Magmortar cannot OHKO, such as Uxie, and then proceed to set up the following turn.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Magmortar's excellent Special Attack and usable Speed. Fire Blast is a powerful STAB attack, though you may use Flamethrower if you prefer perfect accuracy. Thunderbolt allows Magmortar to hit bulky Water-types like Milotic and Flying-types such as Moltres super effectively. Focus Blast lets Magmortar strike Regirock and Houndoom for deadly damage. Hidden Power Ice allows Magmortar to OHKO Altaria, while Hidden Power Grass is used to OHKO Rhyperior and Quagsire. Life Orb is the preferred item, although you may choose an Expert Belt if you wish to be free from recoil damage.</p> <p>With a Timid nature and 240 EVs in Speed, Magmortar has the ability to outrun all positive natured base 80 Pokemon, while also beating Offensive Milotic by one point. Max Special Attack is vital, as it grants Magmortar's attacks more power behind them. The remaining EVs are placed into HP, giving Magmortar a small defensive boost, while retaining an odd number that allows it to switch into Stealth Rock five times.</p> <p>Being a Fire-type, Magmortar loses a quarter of its health upon switching into Stealth Rock. Support from Rapid Spin is a necessity, as Magmortar will also be losing health from Life Orb recoil, making a sweep much more difficult. Donphan is an excellent user of Rapid Spin as it can switch into physically-based Rock- and Ground-type moves aimed at Magmortar, while hitting Ghost-types with Assurance.</p> <p>Without any physical attacks, this set has trouble getting past special walls, primarily Chansey and Clefable. There are numerous ways to deal with this problem. The first way is to use Choice Band Dugtrio, who can trap them with its ability, and 2HKO them with Earthquake. Mixed Blaziken is also an option to deal with special walls, as it can lure them in with specially-based moves and hit them with Superpower. Finally, Taunt Mismagius can shut down most special walls with ease and setup with Nasty Plot. After three boosts from Nasty Plot, Mismagius can 2HKO Chansey with Hidden Power Fighting.</p>"
      },
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>This set uses Choice items to either boost Magmortar's Speed or Special Attack to an overwhelming level. Fire Blast and Overheat allow Magmortar to leave large dents on a variety of opponents; Fire Blast is the most reliable choice as it doesn't lower Magmortar's Special Attack after use, which is more suitable for late-game cleaning, but Overheat deals more damage and has better uses earlier on. Flamethrower can be used if you would rather have perfect accuracy over power. Thunderbolt allows Magmortar to damage Water-types like Milotic and Flying-types such as Moltres for super effective damage. Focus Blast is used to blast opponents who resist or are immune to Fire-type moves, such as Regirock and Houndoom. Hidden Power Ice deals huge damage to Altaria, while providing excellent coverage alongside Thunderbolt. Alternatively, Hidden Power Grass can be used to OHKO Quagsire and Rhyperior, who take less damage from any other move listed.</p> <p>With a Modest nature and a Choice Scarf, Magmortar reaches 384 Speed, outrunning max Speed Swellow and everything below. Using more Speed is unnecessary as Magmortar won't outrun anything notable. Max Special Attack gives Magmortar added power behind its attacks. The remaining EVs are placed into Defense for additional physical bulk. When using Choice Specs, a Timid nature along with an EV spread of 16 HP / 252 SpA / 240 Spe is recommended. This allows Magmortar to outrun maximum Speed Modest Milotic.</p> <p>Since Choice Magmortar will have to switch out frequently, removing Stealth Rock from the field via Rapid Spin is a must. Donphan is an excellent choice as it can switch into Rock- and Ground-type moves that Magmortar is weak to and smack most spinblockers hard with Earthquake and Assurance, while also setting up Stealth Rock for Magmortar. Hitmontop is another great Rapid Spinner as it has Foresight to eliminate Ghost-types' immunity to Rapid Spin.</p> <p>Like the Special Sweeper set, this set has trouble with Chansey, who can survive even Choice Specs Focus Blast with ease. Physically-based sweepers such as Hitmontop are great teammates as they can eliminate Chansey with their powerful STAB moves. Taunt Mismagius is another option as Chansey is unable to damage it with Seismic Toss. Mismagius can use this time to set up Nasty Plot and 2HKO it with +6 Hidden Power Fighting.</p>"
      },
      "SubPunch": {
        "description": "<p>Like the first set, this set also attempts to break through the opponent's walls, but this time with a combination of Substitute and Focus Punch. Substitute grants Magmortar safety from crippling status moves, while also giving protection for Focus Punch's charging turn. Focus Punch deals solid damage to any Pokemon who is not hit super effectively by Fire Blast and Thunderbolt. Fire Blast and Lava Plume both provide reliable STAB; the choice depends on whether the higher power in Fire Blast or the higher accuracy and burn rate with Lava Plume is preferred. Thunderbolt damages bulky Water-types like Milotic, as well as Flying-types like Moltres. The item choice depends on preference; Expert Belt boosts the power of Magmortar's attacks, while Leftovers help regain HP lost from using Substitute.</p> <p>232 Speed EVs give Magmortar the ability to outrun all neutral base 80 Pokemon, which includes Venusaur and Blaziken. 48 Attack EVs ensure that Magmortar OHKOes Chansey with an Expert Belt boosted Focus Punch after it switches into Stealth Rock. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Attack, giving Magmortar more power behind its specially-based moves.</p> <p>Support from Rapid Spin is even more important on this set as Magmortar's HP is already lowered with Substitute, which means that you want to preserve as much HP as possible by preventing residual damage. Claydol is a decent choice for this role as it can switch into Rock- and Ground-type attacks aimed at Magmortar, while providing extra support with dual screens and Stealth Rock of its own. It shares a weakness to Water-type moves, however.</p> <p>As Magmortar will be losing a lot of its health due to Substitute and entry hazards, Wish support is an excellent option. Chansey and Clefable are excellent partners for Magmortar as they can cripple the opponent with status, while providing reliable support with Wish. Clefable also has access to Encore to stop set-up sweepers from sweeping.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Probopass is an odd-looking fellow, isn't he? Sporting an immense 145 base Defense and 150 base Special Defense, Probopass has the ability to take many hits and support his teammates with decent support moves such as Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, and Gravity. Additionally, Probopass's Magnet Pull ability is somewhat useful, as it traps the few Steel-types in UU: Registeel, Steelix, Aggron, and Magneton. Everything looks good so far! However, upon closer inspection you'll notice that he's lacking in HP, while his typing gives him an unfortunate 4x weakness to both Ground- and Fighting-type attacks. Probopass is a flawed Pokemon, but if you give him the right support and cover his crippling weaknesses, he becomes a decent supporter and an unbreakable wall capable of checking many threatening Pokemon that reside in UU, such as Houndoom, Rotom, and some variants of Spiritomb.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs can be used to give Probopass more power, and his special movepool is good enough to make it work. Probopass has access to Rock Polish, though his low offensive stats and poor Speed aren't going to help him accomplish a sweep any time soon. A Shuca or Chople Berry may be used to reduce damage from Ground- or Fighting-type attacks, respectively. Discharge can be used over Thunderbolt for its higher paralysis rate, which is helpful due to Probopass's terrible Speed. Ancient Power can be used for STAB instead of Power Gem, since the small chance of boosting Probopass's stats is nice if it works. Finally, Torment can be used alongside Protect, taking advantage of Probopass's decent typing and stalling ability.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky Ground-types such as Donphan and Claydol are ideal counters, as they are immune to Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt, take little damage from Power Gem, and have STAB Earthquake to hit Probopass with; just make sure he doesn't have a chance to use Magnet Rise. Gligar can switch into Earth Power or Thunderbolt, while it can use Taunt to set up on Probopass. Dugtrio can switch into almost all of Probopass's attacks, trap him with Arena Trap, and KO him with STAB Earthquake provided he hasn't set up Magnet Rise.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types can take a few hits from Probopass, and even Hidden Power Grass and Thunderbolt can be recovered from, while they can hit Probopass with a super effective STAB Surf. Chansey and Clefable can take on most special-based sets thanks to their high HP and Special Defense stats, while using Seismic Toss to overcome Probopass's massive defenses. Most Fighting-types can take on Probopass, especially Hitmonlee with Limber and Hariyama with Guts.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Probopass's great Special Defense and usable HP stats, turning him into a legitimate special tank. The heavy focus on Special Defense gives Probopass the ability to take on special attackers such as Rotom, Houndoom, and Spiritomb much easier, and the moveset is designed to make the best of the support options given to him. Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, and Toxic are all helpful moves, and with Probopass's immense bulk, he can abuse said moves numerous times if need be. Power Gem is for STAB, while Earth Power and Thunderbolt are used for better type coverage, hitting Steel-types and bulky Water-types, respectively. Toxic should only be used alongside Earth Power, as Steel-types are immune to Toxic and take less damage from Thunderbolt, while Thunder Wave can be used to overcome Probopass's low Speed.</p> <p>As for other move options, Probopass can utilize Explosion, enabling him to deal huge damage and take out a possible threat to your team; when using Explosion, a Sassy nature is recommended since it doesn't lower Probopass's Attack. Explosion also turns Probopass into a lure for Ground-, Fighting-, and Water-types, letting him easily take them out and pave the way for a teammate to potentially sweep. Alternatively, Gravity can be used to support Probopass's teammates and boost the accuracy of more shaky moves. Other benefits of Gravity include an Earthquake which cannot be evaded, and the ability to use moves such as Zap Cannon. Chople, Shuca, or Passho Berry can be used to weaken super effective Fighting-, Ground-, or Water-type attacks. Rest and Sleep Talk overcome Probopass's lack of recovery, and they turn Probopass into a great sleep absorber and wall.</p> <p>Below are some damage calculations demonstrating Probopass's walling ability:</p> <ul> <li>Timid 252 SpA Venusaur Leaf Storm vs. 252 HP / 252 SpD Probopass: 41.7% - 49.1%</li> <li>Timid 252 SpA Houndoom +2 Fire Blast vs. 252 HP / 252 SpD Probopass: 57.4% - 68.5%</li> <li>Modest 252 SpA Moltres Fire Blast vs. 252 HP / 252 SpD Probopass: 45.7% - 53.7%</li> <li>Timid 252 SpA Rotom Thunderbolt vs. 252 HP / 252 SpD Probopass: 27.2% - 32.4%</li> </ul> <p>Unfortunately, due to Probopass's typing, he carries a nasty 4x weakness to Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, so a teammate who can switch into such moves is extremely helpful. Flying-types such as Altaria and Moltres are effective, as they are immune to Ground-type attacks and resist Fighting-type moves. Ghost-types such as Mismagius and Rotom are also great, as they pack immunities to both Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, while their Ghost typing gives them an immunity to Rapid Spin, preventing the Stealth Rock Probopass sets up from being removed.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types can be troublesome; however, such foes are easily defeated by the likes of Venusaur and Ludicolo, while Chansey and Clefable can stall them with Seismic Toss and Soft-Boiled. Toxic and Toxic Spikes are also helpful, as they cause worsening damage each turn, making it much harder to recover the damage. Dragon Dance Feraligatr can set up on most bulky Water-types who lack Hidden Power Grass, while Altaria can set up against those who lack Ice Beam. Finally, Hippopotas can be used alongside Probopass, as the sandstorm Hippopotas provides boosts Probopass's Special Defense by 50%. This allows Probopass to tank special hits much more effectively, and it ensures that Probopass will never be 2HKOed by +2 Houndoom's Fire Blast. Just be sure that the sandstorm doesn't hinder the rest of your team.</p>"
      },
      "Trapper": {
        "description": "<p>With his Ground-type weakness eliminated, Probopass is surprisingly difficult to KO, especially when Steel-types such as Magneton and Steelix cannot escape, and Probopass stops their attempts to phaze him with Taunt. Substitute is an alternative to Taunt, as it protects Probopass from status while giving him a turn to set up Magnet Rise or hit the opposing Pokemon with an attack. Earth Power deals great damage to Steel-, Fire-, and Electric-types, Power Gem hits Flying-types such as Moltres and Altaria, and Hidden Power Grass is used to 2HKO Ground-types such as Dugtrio and Donphan. Thunderbolt is mainly used for bulky Water-types such as Milotic, though support from Toxic Spikes is usually more effective in dealing with such foes; Thunderbolt also scores a super effective hit against most Flying-types.</p> <p>Using a Modest nature along with 84 Speed EVs ensures that Probopass outruns most Steel-types in UU, most notably minimum Speed Registeel. Alternatively, you could run a more defensive spread without Speed or Special Attack, while using Toxic to stall bulkier opponents such as Donphan or Milotic.</p> <p>Ground- and Fighting-type moves are a problem for Probopass, so a teammate who can switch into them is recommended. Claydol can switch into both Ground- and Fighting-type moves with an immunity and resistance, respectively; Claydol also has access to Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin to support teammates. If you wish to go down a more offensive route, Moltres is a viable choice, as it can switch in quite easily and threaten opponents with STAB Fire-type moves; however, if you use Moltres, make sure you have Rapid Spin support, as it loses half of its health upon switching into Stealth Rock.</p> <p>As the main goal of this set is to trap and get rid of Steel-types, Pokemon who benefit from their removal are great teammates. Venusaur and Espeon can take advantage of a team which lacks Registeel, while Scyther, Absol, and Swellow can power through an opponent who lacks Steelix. Below are some damage calculations to give you an idea of the damage Probopass will be dealing to common UU Steel-types:</p> <ul> <li>252 SpA Modest Probopass Earth Power vs. 252 HP / 252 SpD Steelix: 40.1% - 47.5%</li> <li>252 SpA Modest Probopass Earth Power vs. 0 HP / 0 SpD Magneton: 185.9% - 219.1%</li> <li>252 SpA Modest Probopass Earth Power vs. 0 HP / 0 SpD Aggron: 160.9% - 190.7%</li> <li>252 SpA Modest Probopass Earth Power vs. 252 HP / 252 SpD Registeel: 22.5% - 26.9%</li> <li></li> </ul> <p>Although the calculation against Registeel is unimpressive, it is easily defeated with Taunt; Iron Head deals a maximum of 20% to Probopass, while Magnet Rise makes Earthquake useless. If Registeel is proving to be a problem, Spikes support from Qwilfish or Cloyster may be helpful.</p>"

  "Rotom": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom may appear to be outclassed by Mismagius due to the latter's higher Special Attack and Speed, but Rotom has a couple of unique traits. It has a fantastic dual typing that boasts many immunities and resistances that allow it to handle many physical threats, a plethora of status inducing moves, and an unresisted STAB attack combo (Steelix and Magneton the only exceptions). This little plasmatic ghost should never be looked down upon, as it can become quite a nuisance towards the opponent.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rotom doesn't really have too many options, as its movepool is rather limited. For support options, Rotom can use Rain Dance on a Rain Dance team, and it can work well in conjunction with Thunder. It also has Spite to reduce PP on one of the opponent's moves, but Rotom usually has better things to do. Lastly, Rotom can use Thunder Wave, but usually Discharge is a superior option as it has a reasonably high chance at inducing paralysis, while also causing a decent amount of damage at the same time. On the offensive side, Rotom has moves like Dark Pulse, Ominous Wind, and Sucker Punch. STAB Shadow Ball already hits whatever Dark Pulse would hit for super effective damage. Ominous Wind isn't a very useful option, since Rotom doesn't have the bulk to keep trying to increase its stats, while Sucker Punch is an even poorer option as it receives no STAB and Rotom has too pathetic an Attack stat to make it viable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Chansey is probably Rotom's biggest counter because of her extremely high Special Defense and HP stats, allowing Chansey to cripple Rotom with Toxic or Thunder Wave while shrugging off any damage taken. Registeel works the same way as Chansey, as it boasts great special bulk and can cripple Rotom as well. The only problem the aforementioned counters have is if they're up against SubCharge Rotom, as they can't do anything against it. Lanturn, on the other hand, is capable of countering the SubCharge set due to its Volt Absorb ability and great Special Defense and HP and can then proceed to hit Rotom hard with Surf.</p> <p>Pokemon who boast a high Special Attack stat and powerful special moves can end Rotom with ease. Examples of these include Blaziken, Magmortar, and Espeon. All of the aforementioned Pokemon are capable of OHKOing Rotom if they are wielding Life Orb or Choice Specs and using their respective STAB attacks.</p> <p>Dark-types can switch into Rotom's Shadow Ball and can end it quickly with STAB Pursuit, particularly Drapion and Absol with their high Attack stats. Umbreon, although not commonly seen using Pursuit, has the bulk to withstand several Thunderbolt attacks from Rotom, allowing it to seriously damage Rotom with Payback. Also, its Synchronize ability will make Rotom think twice before burning it with Will-O-Wisp, as it will be burned too. Grass-types like Torterra and Venusaur are effective switch-ins to Rotom as well, boasting a resistance to Thunderbolt and having decent overall bulk, allowing them to hurt Rotom with their respective STAB moves; though they should watch out for Will-O-Wisp and the occasional Hidden Power Ice.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "SubSplit": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to keep Rotom alive as long as possible while still packing some offensive power. With Substitute, Rotom can block damaging status moves such as Thunder Wave and Toxic from Registeel or Chansey. It also protects Rotom from Sucker Punch from Pokemon such as Toxicroak, allowing it to safely revenge kill them. In addition, Substitute is useful for easing prediction when Rotom expects a switch. However, Life Orb recoil and Substitute damage will pile up quickly. This is where Pain Split comes in. Pain Split allows Rotom to get back to near-perfect health due to its low base 50 HP. Substitute and Pain Split work as a useful stalling strategy for Rotom, especially as one of its common switch-ins, Chansey, can't touch it behind a Substitute, while Rotom can Pain Split it to get back to full health. The combination of Thunderbolt and Shadow Ball provides Rotom with almost perfect coverage, as the only common Pokemon in UU who resists it is Steelix.</p> <p>A Timid nature and 252 Speed EVs give Rotom 309 Speed, outspeeding dangerous Pokemon such as Timid Moltres and Jolly / Timid Toxicroak, while at worst Speed tying with other Rotom who lack Choice Scarf. Maximum Special Attack is so Rotom hits as hard as possible; its base 95 Special Attack stat is not particularly powerful, so it needs all the investment it can get. The leftover EVs are placed in Special Defense rather than HP to maintain a low HP, allowing for maximum recovery from Pain Split. Life Orb is the necessary item, as Rotom is lacking in power due to its underwhelming Special Attack stat and can still recover health through Pain Split.</p> <p>This set has problems with several Pokemon it can't hit hard enough. Steelix is immune to Thunderbolt and resists Shadow Ball, so it can be troublesome, as it can simply set up Stealth Rock and Roar Rotom out. Bulky Water-types such as Blastoise and Milotic are useful to deal with Steelix, as they will take little from its attacks and can threaten Steelix with a STAB Surf. Additionally, Blastoise can also spin away the entry hazards that it sets up. Registeel is another problem for this set if it has Ice Punch or Shadow Claw as it will break Rotom's Substitutes with ease while taking little damage from Thunderbolt. Torterra and Donphan can both beat Registeel, but the former must watch out for Ice Punch. Like Steelix, Dugtrio can also finish off a weakened Registeel as Earthquake does 59.3% - 69.8% to most variants. Spiritomb can be troublesome for this set as it can Shadow Sneak Rotom and prevent Rotom from switching out with the threat of Pursuit. Houndoom, Moltres, and Blaziken are very useful partners to take out Spiritomb as well as both Steelix and Registeel.</p> <p>Drapion can't easily switch into Rotom unless it is very specially defensive, but once in, it will outspeed and threaten Rotom with Crunch or even Pursuit a fleeing Rotom, while specially defensive versions take 41.9% - 49.1% from Thunderbolt, so they can usually do well against Rotom if they don't switch in on Thunderbolt. Dugtrio can be useful to trap and OHKO offensive Drapion, as well as defensive ones when they are slightly weakened. Defensive Venusaur and Torterra cause this set problems as they aren't 2HKOed by Shadow Ball and can hit back hard with STAB Grass-type attacks. Both also have Synthesis so they can stay around for a while and deal with Rotom. Leafeon can handle Torterra and also physical versions of Venusaur (assuming you already have someone put to sleep by Sleep Powder) so it makes an effective partner to Rotom. It can also provide Heal Bell support if the opponent manages to get Rotom statused. Fire-types such as Blaziken, Houndoom, and Moltres also scare off these Grass-types. Considering the problems caused by Steel- and Dark-types, Fighting-types such as Blaziken, Hariyama, Hitmonlee, Hitmontop, and Toxicroak make good partners.</p>"
      },
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>Rotom has decent Special Attack and Speed stats, and with all of those immunities and resistances Rotom can come in on, it's a natural candidate for wielding a Choice item. With Choice Scarf, Modest Rotom reaches a Speed stat of 421, while with Choice Specs, Timid Rotom reaches a great Special Attack stat of 433.</p> <p>Rotom can be quite devastating by using just STAB Thunderbolt and Shadow Ball attacks, since they achieve almost perfect coverage, only resisted by Steelix and Magneton. The last attacking option goes to Hidden Power Fighting or Hidden Power Grass. Hidden Power Fighting hits Steelix and Magneton that attempt to switch in on Rotom for super effective damage, which means that Rotom really gains perfect coverage. On the other hand, Hidden Power Grass hits Lanturn and Ground-types hard, is powerful enough to OHKO Donphan, and hits Steelix for neutral damage. Both of the Hidden Power attacks provide near-perfect coverage, so it's really up to personal preference. Those aren't the only Hidden Power types Rotom can use though, as Hidden Power Ice and Hidden Power Ground can be used as well. If you are planning on using Rotom with a Choice Scarf and a Timid nature, Hidden Power Ice can be used as Rotom becomes a great Rock Polish Torterra and Dragon Dance Altaria check. Hidden Power Ground allows you to hit all of Steelix, Magneton, Camerupt, and Lanturn for super effective damage, but you miss the KO against Absol and other Dark-types that are weak to Fighting attacks. Will-O-Wisp may seem like a bad option on a Choice set due to the fact that Rotom has to switch out after it uses it, but it definitely has its uses. Normally, people will never suspect a Choiced attacker to be carrying a status move, meaning they'll try to switch in Pokemon like Registeel or Absol to take Rotom's Shadow Ball, only to be burned. For the final move option, Trick is the best option due to Rotom's barren movepool. Tricking a Choice item onto tanks or walls is a great way to cripple them, being especially effective since Pokemon like Chansey and Registeel love to switch in on Rotom.</p> <p>As always, being locked into one attack can cause problems. For instance, if Rotom is locked into using Shadow Ball, a Dark-type Pursuit user like Absol or Drapion can easily destroy it, or if Rotom is using Thunderbolt, a Ground-type like Torterra can get a free turn to set up. Even though Rotom can use Trick to cripple tanks or walls like Chansey, they can still switch in on Rotom's attacks with ease and set up themselves. To solve these problems, simply scout your opponent's team before sending out Rotom to see if their team consists of any Pursuit users or special walls. There are multiple ways one can scout the opponent's team; the two most common strategies are utilizing U-turn and Roar or Whirlwind. Primeape is an excellent U-turner as it can force many switches with its powerful Close Combat, while Donphan makes an excellent Pokemon to use Roar because of its great physical bulk. These two simple strategies can reveal many Pokemon from your opponent's team, giving you an idea if it's safe to switch in Rotom. As for dealing with the special walls, using a strong Fighting-type Pokemon can easily fend off the most prominent special wall: Chansey. Primeape deserves a mention again because of its ability to threaten Chansey, forcing it to switch out (in which case you can use U-turn if you predict it to switch out), or be OHKOed by Close Combat. Primeape also deals with other specially defensive Pokemon like Registeel or Clefable, both of which can be quite troublesome for Rotom to take down.</p>"
      },
      "SubCharge": {
        "description": "<p>SubCharge Rotom is by far the most effective offensive set Rotom can use. Its common switch-ins, such as Chansey and Registeel, turn into setup bait instead of brick walls, thanks to two simple moves: Substitute and Charge Beam.</p> <p>The use of Substitute and Charge Beam makes Rotom a very threatening offensive force once it has collected a few Special Attack boosts. Most importantly, Substitute allows Rotom to block status effects from the likes of Chansey and Registeel that attempt to induce it with, as well as not breaking in one hit from either of their attacks. Not only that, but Substitute makes a great way to scout the opponent's switch-in. For instance, if Rotom is up against Claydol, the opponent will most likely switch out in the fear of Shadow Ball. By knowing this, you can set up Substitute instead as the opponent switches out, and use the most appropriate move against the newly switched in Pokemon. This works especially well against Pursuit and Sucker Punch users like Absol, since if Rotom is behind a Substitute, it can try to eliminate them with Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Fighting. After Rotom is safely behind Substitute, it can then boost its Special Attack with Charge Beam, eventually gaining enough power to KO Chansey and Registeel, two huge threats, with Thunderbolt. If you are interested in type coverage rather than power, Hidden Power Fighting can be used. It helps pound down Steelix and Magneton that give Rotom serious amounts of trouble, as they are both resistant (Steelix being immune to Electric-type attacks) to both of Rotom's STAB moves. Shadow Ball takes up the last moveslot by providing Rotom with a powerful secondary STAB attack to use and provides great type coverage in conjunction with Rotom's Electric-type moves, especially helpful against Pokemon who are immune or resistant to Electric-type attacks, such as Lanturn and Torterra.</p> <p>The EV spread is extremely straightforward; max Special Attack and Speed give Rotom as much offensive power as possible. An alternative spread of 152 Def / 106 SpA / 252 Spe gives Rotom's Substitute enough bulk to withstand Registeel's Ice Punch that use 100 Attack EVs, which is very beneficial when it comes to setting up against it. This spread is not necessarily important, but if you dislike the fact that Registeel can break Rotom's Substitute, it's a great spread to keep in mind.</p> <p>Even though this may be one of Rotom's best offensive sets that can beat its common switch-ins, it still has two problems: Ground-types and Pokemon who are faster than it. Ground-type Pokemon can switch in on Charge Beam fearlessly, meaning Rotom achieves no Special Attack boosts, which leaves it relatively weak. Steelix and Quagsire are both prime examples of this situation. Steelix boasts an immunity to Electric attacks, resistance to Shadow Ball, and is never 2HKOed by an unboosted Hidden Power Fighting. It can then hurt Rotom badly with Stone Edge. Quagsire works the same way, except it takes no super effective hits, allowing it to finish off Rotom with repeated Waterfall attacks or setting up multiple Curses. Rotom may become a big threat with a couple of Charge Beam boosts, but it can still be easily revenge-killed by faster threats, like Houndoom and Mismagius, because of its mediocre defenses. To deal with these two threats, Hariyama and Drapion are excellent choices. Houndoom hates being face to face with Hariyama because of its resistance to Dark- and Fire-type attacks (due to Hariyama's Thick Fat ability), allowing it to scare off Houndoom with a powerful STAB Fighting-type move. As for Mismagius, Drapion makes a great Pokemon to use against it with its resistance to Shadow Ball and neutrality to Hidden Power Fighting and Thunderbolt, allowing it to eliminate Mismagius from the remainder of the battle with Pursuit.</p>"
      },
      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<p>While Rotom isn't seen as a bulky Pokemon, it's capable of countering some of UU's biggest physical threats, most notably Swellow, Scyther, and any Fighting-type. The reason for this is because of Rotom's fantastic dual typing that boasts multiple resistances or immunities to Fighting, Flying, Bug, and Ground.</p> <p>Rotom is bulky enough to survive many hits coming from physical sweepers. For example, Hitmonlee and Hitmontop both fail to 2HKO Rotom with Stone Edge, meaning Rotom can burn them with Will-O-Wisp, making them close to useless. Swellow doesn't come close to a 3HKO with Brave Bird, and Scyther fares even worse. Not only can that, but this set also handles Dark-types like Absol that may attempt to Pursuit you, because Pursuit will fail to OHKO assuming you stay in, allowing Rotom to cripple them with Will-O-Wisp. Once Rotom has taken multiple hits, it can heal off the damage with Rest, while Sleep Talk prevents Pokemon from setting up on you while you are sleeping.</p> <p>Due to the fact that Rotom is being used defensively, it makes one of the best Rapid Spin blockers in UU, being able to switch in on many Rapid Spinners fearlessly and cripple them with Will-O-Wisp, as most of them are physically based. With this being said, if your team's goal consists of setting up as much entry hazards as possible, Rotom is a prime candidate to prevent the entry hazards from being removed. Due to Rotom's heavy EV investment in Defense, it is vulnerable to high-powered special attacks. For example, a Modest Life Orb Milotic can OHKO Rotom with Hydro Pump if Stealth Rock is in play. To fix this problem, pairing Rotom with Pokemon who boast a high Special Defense stat can be helpful. Chansey and Registeel are excellent choices for switching into special attacks. Chansey is the number one special wall in UU thanks to her incredible special bulk and has multiple support moves to aid the team as a whole, including Wish, Stealth Rock, Toxic, and Thunder Wave. Registeel is also capable of inflicting status and setting up Stealth Rock, but it also boasts an immunity to Poison-type attacks and useful resistances to Grass-, Ghost-, and Dark-type moves.</p>"
      },
      "Double Status": {
        "description": "<p>Rotom is capable of abusing almost every status effect, and this set is dedicated to inflicting as much status as it can against the opponent's team. This set is also a fantastic supporter, since Pokemon who are crippled are much easier to take down than those that aren't. The three status effects Rotom uses to try to cripple the opponent's Pokemon are burn, paralysis, and poison, an excellent status combination.</p> <p>Discharge is a great move to use as it has a 30% chance to paralyze the enemy while doing a decent amount of damage at the same time. Will-O-Wisp is definitely useful against physical sweepers, allowing Rotom to deal with them much easier. It also helps Rotom deal with Steel-types, as most don't mind paralysis since they are already slow (or in Steelix's case, immune to Discharge), and are immune to Toxic. Walls like Porygon2 and Lanturn can be quite troublesome to take down with your sweepers, so Toxic does a very good job at wearing them down. Shadow Ball is Rotom's main choice for attacking as it has more power than Discharge and better overall coverage. Confuse Ray can be used instead of Shadow Ball if you feel the need for the added status, as Confuse Ray can form the dreaded parafusion combo, or it can simply wear down the Pokemon's health even faster if they are burnt or poisoned. The addition of Pain Split to Rotom's movepool is extremely helpful. Since Rotom has such a low HP stat, Pain Split can help it heal back a great amount of its health, especially against Chansey because of her huge HP stat. Lastly, Substitute is an option for scouting your opponent's moves and helps Rotom stall for Toxic or Will-O-Wisp damage.</p> <p>When using this Rotom set, it is important to have Pokemon on your team that can take advantage of the opponent's Pokemon being crippled by status. For example, if you're using a Pokemon who is relatively slow like Azumarill, paralyzing the opponent's team can help it move first, allowing it to become more devastating. Physical sweepers like Feraligatr hate it when Slowbro tries to end their sweep, so by poisoning Slowbro, it will gradually lose HP and lose its ability to wall. In addition, defensively frail Pokemon can be supported by Rotom's burns. All in all, this Rotom set opens up many opportunities for your sweepers, tanks, and walls, allowing them to become more effective than usual.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>While Rotom may not have the greatest of defensive stats, its handful of immunities and reasonably high Speed allow it to become an effective dual screener, while still being able to cripple dangerous physical threats with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>The procedure for using this set is quite simple: use either Reflect or Light Screen depending on the situation you're in, followed by Will-O-Wisp to cripple the opposing Pokemon, assuming you opt for it. When facing a strong physical attacker like Feraligatr, it would be a better idea to burn it with Will-O-Wisp instead of trying to set up Reflect first, since a burned Feraligatr's Attack will be lowered permanently, unlike Reflect's five (or eight depending on your item) turn duration. If you dislike using Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split is an excellent secondary option. It gives Rotom much more longevity, allowing it to set up screens more than once, not to mention the fact that Rotom boasts a reasonably low HP stat, which helps it heal back more of its health with Pain Split, especially against bulky threats like Registeel and Chansey. As for the offensive options, Thunderbolt is preferred over Shadow Ball due to its higher Base Power and neutral coverage; however, Shadow Ball is an option if you feel the need to hit Ground-types or Electric-types harder.</p> <p>Maximum Speed allows Rotom to have a chance at setting up the desired screen before being hit by an attack, and 252 HP EVs provide maximum overall bulk. Leftovers is normally recommended over Light Clay as it will let Rotom take more hits by replenishing its health, but Light Clay can be used if you feel the need for extra team support.</p> <p>It is recommended to have teammates who can take advantage of the dual screens, especially setup sweepers. Great examples of these type of Pokemon include Feraligatr, Mismagius, and Houndoom. With dual screen support, Feraligatr is capable of achieving more Dragon Dance boosts, Mismagius will boast a tougher Substitute to break, allowing it to boost up with Calm Mind, and Houndoom can set up multiple Nasty Plot boosts. Other Pokemon who can use the dual screens effectively are powerful but frail sweepers, like Blaziken and Rampardos. Blaziken is arguably the best wallbreaker in UU, but its frailness tends to end its life quite quickly, meaning that having dual screen support will give Blaziken more survivability. Rampardos has pathetic defensive stats, but massive base 165 Attack. With dual screen support, Rampardos has a higher chance of getting the Rock Polish needed attempt a sweep.</p>"

  "Uxie": {
    "overview": "<p>Uxie has become one of the most prominent Pokemon of the DPP UU metagame, and for good reason. Its massive defenses, combined with its enormous support movepool, which includes (but is certainly not limited to) Stealth Rock, Sunny Day, Rain Dance, Yawn, and U-turn, and high base Speed stat, have made it the quintessential support Pokemon. Not only that, but Uxie is also one of the most dangerous users of Calm Mind in the tier. The only things stopping this knowledgeable sprite from storming the upper tiers are its irritating Psychic typing, which leaves it weak to Pursuit and U-turn; its lackluster offenses, even with the boost provided by Calm Mind; and absence of reliable recovery outside of Rest. Have no fear though; if you're looking for a good lead, supporter, or late-game sweeper, your search has come to an end. Welcome the omniscient pixie into your team with arms wide open.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>For other boosting moves, Uxie is left with only Amnesia. While boosting Uxie's already awesome base Special Defense to impenetrable levels seems like a cool idea, Uxie is much better off utilizing Calm Mind which provides not only a Special Defense boost, but also a Special Attack boost. Toxic can be used on any of the sets listed above over one of Uxie's other supporting options; however, Uxie is much more adept at spreading paralysis, and without instant recovery, can't really stall long enough for Toxic to KO the opponent.</p> <p>For alternative attacking options, Uxie has a plethora of choices. Signal Beam stands out as the most prominent choice for a super effective hit on fellow Psychic-types, Tangrowth, and Leafeon. Shadow Ball can be used in place of Thunderbolt or Grass Knot on the more offensive sets to nab a surprise hit on Mismagius, Rotom, and Dusclops, but that's the extent of its uses. Uxie can make use of Charge Beam as an in-between for Thunderbolt and Calm Mind; however, the accuracy is troublesome and Uxie appreciates the Special Defense boost that goes along with Calm Mind. Uxie can also utilize alternative Hidden Powers, specifically Hidden Power Ice, to get a nice hit on Altaria, but otherwise Uxie is better off using its other moves. Finally, if using a physically inclined Uxie, the elemental punches, most prominently Thunder Punch, are available as substitutes for Thunderbolt and Uxie's other moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The biggest and baddest counters to any Uxie set are Taunt users. Absol, Ambipom, and Spiritomb stand out as the most threatening as they can Taunt Uxie and proceed to either nail it with Pursuit before it can U-turn out or smack it with Payback or Shadow Ball should it stay in. If Uxie is left with only Psychic as its attacking move, a whole plethora of threats in UU can use the opportunity to switch into Uxie and proceed to set up or eliminate Uxie with ease. Dark-types such as Houndoom and Drapion can use Uxie to set up Nasty Plot and Swords Dance, respectively, and demolish Uxie with Dark Pulse or Crunch. Mismagius and Rotom have an easy time switching into any Uxie set and can either set up a Substitute before Uxie can paralyze them or eliminate it with Shadow Ball. Registeel, Chansey, and Clefable can stall any Substitute-less Uxie with a combination of Seismic Toss and Toxic. Rhyperior gets a special mention as an Uxie counter as it can switch into any Grass Knot-less Uxie, takes little damage from anything it can dish out, is immune to Thunder Wave, and can proceed to set up one of either Substitute, Swords Dance, or Rock Polish. In general, as Uxie is a supporter first and an attacker second, most Uxie will lack any kind of offensive power. So, any Pokemon with decent bulk can pound away at Uxie and eventually eliminate it thanks to its absence of recovery outside of Rest.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Uxie has a considerable amount of bulk, which enables it to take hits from many opposing Pokemon, and this set is all about tanking those hits, crippling and softening up your opponent, and setting up the rest of your team for an eventual sweep. First, you should try to bring Uxie into a Pokemon who can't possibly penetrate its impregnable defenses and proceed to use Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, or Yawn. After this mission has been accomplished, Uxie is free to U-turn as your opponent goes to their Uxie counter, and you can choose the appropriate Pokemon to switch in against it. The choice between Thunder Wave and Yawn is up to your preference. Uxie is one of the most reliable users of Thunder Wave and can cripple your opponent's faster walls and sweepers, allowing a slower sweeper, such as Rhyperior and Marowak, to come in late-game and plow through your opponent's team. Yawn works well to rack up residual damage and can potentially put a Pokemon to sleep, but, when compared to the possibility to cripple multiple Pokemon with Thunder Wave, is usually a lesser option. Psychic is Uxie's obligatory STAB move, and it helps damage the common Fighting-types in UU, especially Hitmontop, who will try to rain on Uxie's parade by spinning away Stealth Rock. Psychic also lets Uxie deal with the myriad of Poison-types in UU, such as Venusaur and Toxicroak.</p> <p>A Bold nature is recommended as Uxie has a weak U-turn anyway, and even with a hindering nature, Uxie is able to break Alakazam's Substitutes with it. Fortunately for Uxie, the sheer amount of sets and combinations it can run works to its advantage by ensuring that your opponent can never be too sure what exactly your Uxie is running. One of the easiest changes to make is to change the EV spread to a specially defensive one of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature. Another option is to keep the given EV spread, but instead using a Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs. This will allow Uxie to take a hit and U-turn to another Pokemon as opposed to forcing the Pokemon to whom it U-turns to take a hit.</p> <p>Uxie fares very well in the lead position, as it is able to get Stealth Rock up consistently and possibly start paralyzing the opponent's team early with Thunder Wave. If using Uxie in the lead position, the slower nature and IVs are recommended for the reasons given above. However, to ensure Uxie gets Stealth Rock up on the field, another alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Timid nature can be used. This will lower Uxie's tanking abilities, but will allow Uxie to get Stealth Rock up against some of the Taunt leads of UU, with the exceptions of Electrode, Ambipom, Mismagius, and Alakazam, as well as allowing Uxie to paralyze opponents before they can move.</p> <p>Thunderbolt can be used in the last slot to deal with Water-types such as Feraligatr and Azumarill, who may take the opportunity to switch in and set up on Uxie's paltry offenses. Thunderbolt and Psychic together offer near-perfect neutral coverage in UU, but without U-turn, Uxie's ability to tank the opponent's hits and support the team is greatly diminished. Zen Headbutt is an alternative choice for STAB in order to inflict damage on sweepers who are weaker on the physical side; however, its imperfect accuracy is a turn-off. Heal Bell is an option to consider in place of either Stealth Rock or Thunder Wave. With it, Uxie becomes an effective cleric, further supporting the team. Memento is another option to consider to allow Uxie to sacrifice itself in order to safely bring in one of your sweepers and give it a free turn to set up. Sacrificing Uxie, however, takes away its ability to support the team, and should your sweeper fail to complete its sweep, Uxie will be unable to tank any more hits for your team. Finally, Uxie can make use of Knock Off to strip its enemies of their item, such as Milotic's Leftovers and Torterra's Life Orb.</p> <p>Uxie's downfall is its lack of recovery, so pairing Uxie with a Wish user can work well to lengthen its life. Clefable and Chansey are great candidates, and as an added bonus, they attract Fighting-type attacks, which Uxie can shrug off with ease. Uxie has a tough time dealing with Dark-types, such as Houndoom and Absol. A great partner to handle these threats is Hariyama, who can handle Dark-type attacks and dish out STAB Fighting-type moves in return. Mismagius is another threat to Uxie, so having a Registeel waiting in the wings can deal solve this problem nicely by using Iron Head or Shadow Claw to break its Substitutes or Thunder Wave to render it useless.</p>"
      },
      "TrickScarf": {
        "description": "<p>When equipped with a Choice Scarf, Uxie is able to reinvent itself as a support Pokemon by checking a myriad of faster threats and, more importantly, make use of Trick in order to cripple an opposing Pokemon. Uxie's access to Trick frequently results either in the crippling of unsuspecting special walls, such as Chansey and Registeel, or in the complete shutdown of bulky stat boosters who commonly try to use Uxie as setup fodder, such as Houndoom and Drapion. Once it has Tricked its Choice Scarf away, Uxie can function perfectly well as a scout and defensive pivot, as even with no investment in Defense, it's still bulky enough to withstand assaults from strong Fighting-types such as Toxicroak and Hitmonlee.</p> <p>Because this set does such a superb job when it comes to luring and crippling common special walls such as Chansey, Registeel, and specially defensive Arcanine, pairing Uxie with Pokemon who can take advantage of the removal of these threats is recommended. Special Venusaur, Moltres, and Mismagius are some great choices for this role. Uxie also tends to attract Pursuit users, especially those holding Choice items, as they can switch in for free on three of Uxie's four attacks and put it in a checkmate position. Because of that, having teammates who can set up on Dark-type attacks, such as Swords Dance Blaziken and Rock Polish Aggron, is extremely beneficial.</p> <p>Just like the Support set, this Uxie works very well in the lead position, as the added Speed enables Uxie to circumvent every sort of Taunt user either by setting Stealth Rock up before they can shut it down, or just by Tricking them its Choice Scarf, thus forcing said leads to switch out, which can be used in conjunction with U-turn to maintain momentum for your side. Additionally, Pokemon focused on setting up weather, such as opposing Uxie and Mesprit, undergo the same problems, as the loss of their weather-lengthening items means that they are limited to five turns of weather and are forced out afterwards.</p> <p>Due to carrying no status inflicting moves and having a rather mediocre Special Attack, one of the main issues Uxie has to bear with is the inability to do anything meaningful to a good number of sweepers once it Tricks its Choice Scarf away, meaning the pixie becomes major setup fodder for bulkier threats such as Altaria, Feraligatr, and Calm Mind users such as Slowbro, Spiritomb, and Mismagius. Because of this, Milotic is a very good partner to this set, given its access to Haze and well-balanced defenses that allow it to easily take on most of the aforementioned threats. Alternatively, you can run either Yawn or Thunder Wave over Stealth Rock to deter sweepers from switching in too readily, but that removes a great part of Uxie's effectiveness as a lead and doesn't necessarily ensure that Uxie can shut them down, as most of the above Pokemon have means of circumventing status effects.</p>"
      },
      "Weather Support": {
        "description": "<p>Uxie's outstanding defensive stats allow it to switch into many common attacks with relative ease, while its high Speed stat allows it to outpace opposing Pokemon and use Rain Dance or Sunny Day before taking a hit. Uxie can also use Memento to sacrifice itself to enable the team's Swift Swim or Chlorophyll sweeper to switch in without risk. With U-turn, however, Uxie can immediately switch to your sweepers while staying healthy, enabling it to set up weather later in the game. Heal Bell gives sweepers who are afflicted by status a second chance at wreaking havoc. Psychic is an important STAB to carry because it prevents Uxie from being complete Taunt bait, and stops Pokemon such as Mismagius, Rotom, and Rhyperior from setting up an easy Substitute. Even more importantly, it eliminates opposing Toxicroak who can easily put a stop to most Swift Swim sweepers' sweeps. Stealth Rock is put in the last slot, as it is good for additional team support and guarantees important KOs for your sweepers. Uxie can use either Rain Dance and Damp Rock, or Sunny Day and Heat Rock; the choice between the two depends on your team.</p> <p>The Speed EVs give Uxie just enough Speed to outpace Rotom who lack Choice Scarf. All that bulk is good for letting Uxie set up multiple times during a game, or get one full setup and then use Memento. Uxie can be used as either a mid-game weather machine or as a lead; if you are using Uxie as a lead, a bulkier EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD, a Bold nature, and U-turn over Memento are recommended. Using the same EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD but with a Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs can be helpful to let Uxie move second, allowing it to set up a weather condition and then take a hit before U-turning out; this allows Uxie's teammate to come in unscathed. If you have another Stealth Rock user on your team, Uxie can use Heal Bell over Stealth Rock to better support its team.</p> <p>Uxie's job is to set up either Rain Dance or Sunny Day, so Pokemon with Swift Swim or Chlorophyll are required to take advantage of the weather Uxie sets up. Fire-types are also good teammates if Uxie is using Sunny Day. As this Uxie's job is to support its team, faster Taunt users who resist Psychic-type attacks, such as Houndoom, Drapion, and Alakazam, will be troublesome. Houndoom and Drapion are especially annoying, as they can use Pursuit on Uxie as it switches out. On weather teams, you really won't carry team members specifically to deal with these threats, but they can be taken down by weather-boosted attacks fairly easily. If your team is particularly weak to them, U-turn will be much more helpful than Memento on Uxie to hit them super effectively.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>Uxie's sheer bulk allows it to easily set up any of the many options in its repertoire to support the entire team, and dual screens are no exception. What sets Uxie apart from the other bulky dual screens users out there, though, is Memento, which faints Uxie to harshly lower the current foe's attacking stats, and allows a teammate to come in scot-free. With dual screens up, and those stat drops on the opponent, even the frailest of stat-uppers can find enough room to set up, which is great news for Belly Drummers such as Linoone and Charizard, who are usually too frail to do so otherwise.</p> <p>Dual screens are a given on this set, halving the damage your team will take from direct attacks. But the toss-up between U-turn and Memento in the third slot is a tough choice to make. While Memento's advantages should be well-known by now, U-turn is an equally useful tool, which shares most of the utility of Memento, but swaps stat drops on the opponent for not sacrificing Uxie, allowing it to further support the team with its bulk. In the final slot, choose what gaps your team needs filled in; Stealth Rock is great if you lack another Pokemon on your team to set it up, Yawn causes switches that can be taken advantage of, and Thunder Wave can cripple certain sweepers.</p> <p>HP is maximized first so Uxie can sponge hits even before the dual screens are set up. Then, Defense is maximized as it does help protect Uxie from the more common Dark- and Bug-type attacks that Uxie will face, particularly Pursuit and U-turn. The remaining EVs go into Special Defense for an added ounce of special bulk. Light Clay is the recommended item here, in order to extend the duration of the dual screens by a further three turns, which will come in handy much more often than you might think.</p> <p>If using this set as a lead, a spread of 252 HP / 32 Def / 224 Spe with a Timid nature is recommended to outspeed Moltres, allowing Uxie to perform its full setup (dual screens + Stealth Rocks) duties easily. However, like every other lead out there, this one has trouble with certain leads, particularly those who set up Spikes, as Uxie can do absolutely nothing to stop them. So, packing a Rapid Spin user or a team mostly immune to Spikes is probably a good idea. Completely maximizing Speed is another idea, to tie with Houndoom and Drapion, allowing Uxie to have a chance of setting up a screen before they pummel it with their powerful STABs.</p> <p>Countering this set is hard because of dual screens. With Reflect up, even Absol's Swords Dance-boosted Night Slash fails to KO, and with Light Screen up, neither will Houndoom's Nasty Plot-boosted Dark Pulse. However, Mismagius has a field day with this set, as it is able to freely switch in on any of Uxie's moves, set up a Substitute, and proceed to boost up its stats with ease. Therefore, having a way to eliminate Mismagius is crucial. Spiritomb works well, as it is able to use the Light Screen set up by Uxie to cushion any Shadow Ball Mismagius might throw at it and either retaliate with Dark Pulse or checkmate it with a combination of Pursuit and Sucker Punch.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Lead": {
        "description": "<p>While Uxie is usually found in a supporting role, where it sports high amounts of HP and defensive EVs, this Uxie aims to surprise opponents by hitting many common leads hard, often OHKOing those who are weak to its moves. Pokemon such as Omastar, Rhyperior, Venusaur, and Cloyster will expect Uxie to U-turn out in fear of their entry hazards or sheer power, only to be KOed by one of Uxie's coverage moves. In addition, Uxie carries U-turn to help you quickly gain the upper hand after it has netted a kill. Uxie still performs its supporting duties by laying down Stealth Rock rather easily thanks to its base 95 Speed and massive bulk. Even with no defensive investment, Uxie can take plenty of unboosted and neutral hits, which allows it to function as a bulky check to quite a few Pokemon. Lastly, its attacking prowess prevents it from becoming setup fodder, unlike the defensive sets.</p> <p>Psychic is the obligatory STAB move, and lets Uxie pound Venusaur and Nidoking leads. It also deals great damage to a majority of the other common leads, including Arcanine, Ambipom, and Electrode. Energy Ball is for getting the OHKO on Omastar, Rhyperior, Cloyster, and Kabutops leads. The third slot is a choice between U-turn and Thunderbolt. Uxie still has problems with Mismagius, Spiritomb, and Alakazam leads, so giving Uxie a quick escape route off the battlefield is recommended. However, Thunderbolt hits Moltres and Scyther for super effective damage, as well as giving Uxie near perfect neutral coverage alongside Psychic.</p> <p>Another option is to use Grass Knot over Energy Ball, as Energy Ball will not always OHKO Rhyperior, whereas Grass Knot will. Another advantage Grass Knot has is that Milotic and Donphan are hit noticeably harder. However, Uxie will lose the ability to OHKO Cloyster and Omastar. Thunder Wave can be used in the third slot to cripple fast Pokemon who attempt to switch in and revenge kill Uxie, such as Rotom, Sceptile, and Houndoom. If more power is desired, Life Orb is an option to net some kills that Expert Belt cannot. Lum Berry is useful for ensuring the win against sleep leads such as Venusaur and Butterfree, as well as for taking Thunder Wave from the likes of lead Mesprit and opposing Uxie. Leftovers can be used to gain more survivability, but this is not recommended as Uxie is already lacking in power as it is.</p> <p>While Mesprit is usually the better of the pixies to lead with if power is desired, Uxie can function just as well, if not better. Pokemon such as Moltres, Venusaur, and Kabutops are all faster than or tie with Mesprit and can all deal serious damage to it, often to the point where Mesprit has to choose between knocking out the opposing lead or laying down Stealth Rock. Uxie's bulk, on the other hand, often enables it to survive hits that Mesprit cannot. Uxie's base 95 Speed also allows it to outpace quite a few Pokemon whom Mesprit cannot. Uxie's Special Attack score, however, does not quite match Mesprit's, which can often lead to missing out on a few kills that Mesprit would achieve.</p>"
      },
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Another interesting move you will find if you dig far enough down Uxie's supporting movepool (in alphabetical order, of course) is Trick Room, which Uxie can set up easily because of, once again, its great bulk and immunity to Ground-type attacks. It is also unique as a Trick Room supporter in that it actually has a high base Speed, which allows it to supply a sort of \"slow\" U-turn under Trick Room's effects, giving it a nice little niche. Yawn is great for forcing switches, and U-turn is great for capitalizing on these switches to bring a sweeper in for free. Finally, Psychic is placed in the last slot as a nice reliable STAB move, so that Uxie is not complete Taunt bait.</p> <p>Bulk is completely maximized, so that Uxie has more chances to set up Trick Room repeatedly throughout the match. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature capitalizes on its relatively high Speed stat though, giving it that nice \"slow\" U-turn so that it, and not a sweeper teammate, takes a hit when U-turn is used.</p> <p>Alternatively, Yawn and Psychic can be replaced with the dual screens. The strategy to employ when using both dual screens and Trick Room is to set up the dual screens first followed by the use of Trick Room. If using dual screens, giving Uxie a Light Clay is recommended so that the duration of the screens lasts even after Trick Room has ended. Using both dual screens and Trick Room unfortunately leaves Uxie with only one other free moveslot, and it is usually forced to use U-turn so that Uxie's sweeping partner can come in unscathed.</p> <p>Mismagius, Absol, and Houndoom are major threats to Uxie thanks to their super effective STABs and the latter two's access to Pursuit. Hariyama is a prime switch-in to the latter two, and it can easily outpace both after Uxie uses Trick Room, scaring them off with a STAB Fighting-type move. Registeel can handle Mismagius, and with Trick Room down, it will have a much easier job doing so. Some examples of Pokemon who make phenomenal Trick Room sweepers alongside Uxie include Camerupt, Rhyperior, Azumarill, and Marowak.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>With excellent bulk and good Speed, Uxie can effectively use a combination of Substitute and Calm Mind. Substitute blocks the \"triple Ts\", which are Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Trick, all three of which horribly cripple Uxie. It also allows Uxie to avoid Sucker Punch and critical hits, making it an excellent bulky set-up sweeper. With Calm Mind, Uxie can set up on many of UU's top threats, such as Milotic and Venusaur. After a Calm Mind, standard bulky Milotic's Surf will fail to break Uxie's Substitute. Psychic is Uxie's STAB of choice while Thunderbolt offers the best neutral coverage alongside it, allowing Uxie to defeat Haze Milotic one-on-one. With Thunderbolt, Uxie can set up Calm Mind and immediately slam Milotic with Thunderbolt while Milotic uses Haze to wipe away Uxie's Calm Mind boosts. Uxie can then use Calm Mind again while Milotic Recovers and repeat the process until Milotic runs out of PP for Recover or gets nailed by a critical hit and loses. Signal Beam is also an option should you wish to hit opposing Psychic-types harder.</p> <p>The HP EVs provide Uxie with enough bulk to switch into Moltres's Fire Blast, use Calm Mind, and not be 2HKOed after Stealth Rock damage. The heavy Speed investment allows Uxie to outspeed Timid Rotom, while the rest are placed into Special Attack to power up Uxie's offenses. If checking Moltres is not difficult for your team, an alternative EV spread of 32 HP / 252 SpA / 224 Spe with the same nature can be used to allow Uxie to hit as hard as possible. Hidden Power Ground can also be used in the final spot to hit Drapion, and is also Uxie's strongest attack option to use against Registeel.</p> <p>Registeel and Chansey are big problems for this set, while Clefable with Encore and Spiritomb cause trouble for Uxie as well. Dugtrio can trap and remove Registeel and Chansey without too much trouble, while Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Hitmonlee can scare away Chansey and Clefable. Houndoom sets up on Spiritomb relatively easily while Uxie can switch into Fighting- and Ground-type attacks aimed at it, as well as setting up on bulky Water-types who attempt to counter Houndoom. Mixed Houndoom who utilize Beat Up can also get past Chansey. Specially defensive Drapion counters Uxie pretty well too, as it can heavily damage Uxie with its STAB attacks or use Whirlwind to force Uxie out. Apart from Dugtrio, who can trap and KO Drapion, Rhyperior is also a great teammate for Uxie, as it is able switch into anything Drapion throws at it and set up Rock Polish or Substitute. Should Uxie lack Thunderbolt, Milotic with Haze can cause Uxie problems as well, as it can use Haze to remove Uxie's boosts and use Recover to heal itself. Venusaur is an excellent switch-in to Milotic, easily scaring it away with its powerful STABs while luring in Registeel and putting it to sleep with Sleep Powder.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>While Uxie has a rather average-looking Special Attack stat, its high Speed stat, along with excellent bulk, a good movepool, and access to Calm Mind, allows it to become a decent sweeper. On top of this, Uxie is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes and not weak to Stealth Rock, meaning it is difficult to take down in one shot. This set is especially dangerous to the offensive Fire / Water / Grass cores used in UU. The idea is to bring Uxie in on the many Pokemon who can't pose a threat to it and set up Calm Mind. Even at only +1, Uxie is strong enough to hurt many offensive teams. Psychic is used again as Uxie's STAB. Grass Knot allows Uxie to muscle through Milotic, easily 2HKOing it after a boost. It also allows Uxie to 3HKO Spiritomb; so with some prediction, Uxie may be able to set up on Sucker Punch and defeat Spiritomb.</p> <p>Hidden Power Ground rounds out Uxie's coverage, allowing it to defeat Houndoom and other Dark-type Pokemon such as Skuntank and Drapion. It also allows Uxie to somewhat hurt Registeel. Thunderbolt can also be used as it offers better neutral coverage and is Uxie's strongest move against Absol, while also hitting Moltres and Articuno for super effective damage.</p> <p>Like most special sweepers, Uxie is walled by both Registeel and Chansey. Both can easily take Uxie's attacks and then cripple it with Thunder Wave or Toxic. Dugtrio is a good teammate to run alongside offensive Uxie, as it can trap and remove both thanks to its Arena Trap ability and strong STAB Earthquake. Hariyama and other Fighting-types can also switch into both Registeel and Chansey and scare them away with the threat of their STAB attacks. Venusaur can lure in Registeel and cripple it with Sleep Powder, allowing Uxie to set up on it much more easily. Specially defensive Drapion and Skuntank check Uxie should it run Thunderbolt, so pairing Uxie with a Ground-type, such as Donphan and Rhyperior, can help Uxie bypass these threats.</p>"
      },
      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<p>Once Uxie acquires enough Calm Minds, this set can be a dangerous sweeper. Thanks to its already-high defensive stats, Uxie will more than likely obtain plenty of Calm Minds over a long period of time. Additionally, immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes makes this set one of the best mono-attackers around, as Uxie can switch in at any point of the match without taking any major residual damage. The main idea when using this set is to switch in on a weak attack, set up Calm Minds until Uxie is at low health, and then use Rest. While Uxie is asleep, use Sleep Talk to allow Uxie the opportunity to garner even more Calm Mind boosts or possibly nail the opponent with Psychic.</p> <p>This set's effectiveness heavily relies on how well you have scouted your opponent's team. It's highly recommended that Uxie is brought out in the later stages of the match, as common defensive Pokemon such as Haze Milotic can be a major barricade to Uxie. Dark-types with Taunt also shut this set down cold, so it is recommended that they are scouted and eliminated beforehand. Donphan makes an excellent partner thanks to its ability to draw in and 2HKO Spiritomb with Stealth Rock in play. Additionally, pairing Donphan with a dangerous Flying-type such as Scyther or Moltres can be beneficial, as it forces the opponent to use Spiritomb to block your Rapid Spin attempts even more. Lastly, Donphan can draw in Milotic, which can make planning Uxie's potential sweep much easier.</p> <p>Choice Specs Rotom makes a good offensive partner, as it can draw in defensive Dark-types and strike them hard with STAB Thunderbolt. Similarly, Mismagius can easily inflict respectable damage to most Dark-types after a Nasty Plot boost. Substitute Dugtrio makes a great offensive partner thanks to its ability to trap Chansey and Registeel, who are both major blocks to a successful Uxie sweep. Furthermore, Substitute Dugtrio can be used to deal with Drapion, Houndoom, and Absol with correct prediction.</p> <p>If you reveal Uxie early in the match to safeguard your team against the multitude of physical sweepers in UU, then pairing it with a defensive Pokemon to deal with its typical counters is recommended. Defensive Hitmontop can deal with Drapion and Absol, while Venusaur can check Haze Milotic. Though it's not necessary, Spikes support can make the process of removing defensive juggernauts such as Milotic much quicker, which can ultimately lead to an easier sweep for Uxie.</p>"

  "Mesprit": {
    "overview": "<p>With its middling stats in comparison to UU's other Psychic-types, it may appear as if Mesprit has issues standing out from its competitors. Its fellow lake guardian, Uxie, boasts significantly superior bulk, making it far more resilient in a supporting role, whereas Alakazam is significantly stronger and faster, making it appear to be the superior offensive threat. However, it would be foolish to simply write off Mesprit as outclassed, as it has several key perks that differentiate it from these two competitors. Mesprit's higher Special Attack in comparison to Uxie allows it to pressure the opposing team while also providing some of the same support that Uxie would bring, making Mesprit much more suited for teams that want to be aggressive. Moves such as Healing Wish also allow Mesprit to facilitate aggression more easily than Uxie, which seeks to pivot out of dangerous attacks much of the time. Additionally, though Alakazam is stronger and faster, it lacks key coverage moves such as Ice Beam and Thunderbolt, and its lack of bulk means that it can only be used aggressively, whereas Mesprit can pivot into many common Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, providing some much-needed defensive synergy for some teams. Overall, these traits make Mesprit a versatile Pokemon that can fit easily on many teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mesprit's movepool is exceptionally diverse, and while many sets have been covered in this analysis, there are still a few different sets that Mesprit can use. Notably, Mesprit has access to both Light Screen and Reflect, which means that it can feasibly use a dual screens set to facilitate a deadly setup sweeper's sweep. Mesprit's access to Healing Wish also means that if said sweeper is unable to fully tear through the opposing team, Mesprit can simply set up both screens once more and Healing Wish that setup sweeper back to full health, almost guaranteeing a sweep is managed to be pulled off. However, this set in general suffers too much competition from Uxie, as Memento is extremely valuable for safely bringing in a setup sweeper of choice without taking significant prior damage. While Healing Wish is strong, Mesprit must switch out and let its desired sweeper tank damage on the switch in most cases, leaving it much more vulnerable to being KOed from stray priority moves. A mono-attacking Calm Mind set with Rest and Sleep Talk could also be used in certain scenarios, but the prevalence of Dark- and Steel-type Pokemon in the tier makes such an option generally poor, as even after accruing multiple boosts, Mesprit would still be unable to break through common Pokemon such as Registeel and Spiritomb.</p> <p>Mesprit also has a few different moves and items you can run on the provided sets, but they typically are inferior options. Energy Ball is a usable move if you're scared of facing lighter opponents that Grass Knot cannot touch, such as Lanturn, but the prominence of heavier Pokemon (notably, Grass Knot has 100 Base Power against Milotic) makes Grass Knot typically the better choice. Signal Beam is neat at times to do solid damage to Psychic- or Dark-type Pokemon that may attempt to switch into Mesprit's Psychic, but its low Base Power hinders it. Knock off is an interesting utility option, as removing Leftovers, Life Orb, or Choice items from certain Pokemon can severely hinder their effectiveness, but it's difficult to fit it on most of Mesprit's sets due to its lack of power. If Pursuit is proving too much of an issue, Colbur Berry is a usable option to allow Mesprit to escape Pursuit once, although losing Leftovers or Life Orb is generally a poor trade. Finally, while a bit gimmicky, Charm has some niche applications in weakening the damage that Mesprit will take from Pursuit, forcing some switches, and helping sweepers set up more easily.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Due to Mesprit's versatility, it can be somewhat difficult to deal with it, as it can be difficult to know which set it is running. However, there are a few Pokemon that are generally very solid answers to it regardless of its set. Dark-type Pokemon such as Drapion, Houndoom, Absol, and Spiritomb are immune to Mesprit's main attack, can threaten Mesprit with super effective STAB attacks, and threaten Mesprit with Pursuit if it wishes to switch to safety. The presence of these Pokemon on an opponent's team is troubling for Mesprit, as they will force Mesprit's trainer to make some tough predictions to ensure that Mesprit does not get knocked out. While they are unable to switch in as easily as Dark-types, in general Pokemon that can hit Mesprit extremely hard while possessing Pursuit, such as Scyther, Tauros, and Swellow, are also solid options. Mesprit's vulnerability to Pursuit is perhaps its biggest weakness and is easily the best way to ensure that it does not remain a pest throughout the match. By threatening Mesprit with these Pokemon, it can be tricky for Mesprit to successfully set up what it wants without being KOed.</p> <p>Defensively, strong specially defensive Pokemon such as Registeel, Chansey, Clefable, and Milotic are all reasonably solid answers to Mesprit. While they are hit harder by Trick than offensive Dark-types and Pokemon with Pursuit, they are also able to switch into Mesprit's attacks with impunity and whittle it down with Seismic Toss in the case of the first three, and Surf in the case of Milotic. However, they are unable to deter Mesprit from utilizing its supportive capabilities. To stop Mesprit from using moves such as Stealth Rock, faster Pokemon with Taunt are natural answers. However, Taunt is only particularly useful if it is used to counter a Mesprit lead, as by the time a Pokemon with Taunt is switched into Mesprit, Mesprit will already have taken the free turn to set up whatever it wishes and switch out for free. This being said, an excellent option to deal with pesky Mesprit leads is Taunt Mismagius, as it outspeeds Mesprit and can threaten with it a super effective STAB Shadow Ball while also deterring it from setting up.</p>",

      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Even though Uxie's higher Speed and significantly better bulk may make it seem as if Uxie outclasses Mesprit when it comes to setting up Stealth Rock, it would be a mistake to simply discount Mesprit's ability to set up the valuable entry hazard. Uxie may possess better defenses and Speed, but it also lacks any form of offensive presence due to its pitiful base 75 Special Attack stat. Mesprit, on the other hand, boasts a very respectable base 105 Special Attack stat, which, in tandem with Mesprit's better offensive movepool, allows it to immediately pressure most of the Pokemon commonly used in the lead position, such as Omastar, Qwilfish, Rhyperior, Hippopotas, Cloyster, Kabutops, and other such Pokemon that are weak to Mesprit's incredible coverage. It is important to note that most of these Pokemon are capable of setting up Stealth Rock or other hazards; thus, Mesprit can, thanks to its offensive presence, double as a sort of anti-lead that is capable of preventing the opponent's Stealth Rock or Spikes from being set up while also setting up those valuable hazards for its own team.</p> <p>Thanks to its respectable bulk and decent Speed, in addition to the fact that Mesprit's offensive presence can often force the opponent to switch plenty of times, Mesprit makes a perfectly viable user of Stealth Rock. The rest of Mesprit's movepool is designed to hit as many Pokemon in the lead position as hard as possible. Psychic is great for doing solid damage to Pokemon that are neutral or resistant to Ice Beam and Thunderbolt. Ice Beam and Thunderbolt form the fabled BoltBeam coverage, and together they hit most of UU for super effective damage. Alternatively, you may use Grass Knot and U-turn over Ice Beam and Thunderbolt if you want Mesprit to act as more of a scout; after all, Grass Knot still hits most of those hazard-setting leads for heavy damage, and it has the added bonus of cleanly OHKOing Rhyperior and Omastar, which Ice Beam and Thunderbolt cannot do. However, Grass Knot does not have the incredible combined coverage of Ice Beam and Thunderbolt, and its overall coverage is rather poor, which means that outside of the lead position, should you opt to use Grass Knot, Mesprit will not have as much mid-game or late-game use. For example, with Ice Beam, Mesprit is able to make a handy check to Rock Polish Torterra, as it is able to take a Life Orb-boosted Wood Hammer after Stealth Rock and retaliate with Ice Beam for an OHKO, which Grass Knot cannot do. Furthermore, with Grass Knot, Mesprit is completely helpless against Drapion and Houndoom, which can easily use the free opportunity to set up.</p> <p>With the given Speed EVs, Mesprit outspeeds max Speed Omastar, which would otherwise be able to set up both Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. The remaining EVs are first used to maximize Mesprit's Special Attack stat to make it an offensive threat, before being dumped into HP to help buff Mesprit's respectable bulk. Expert Belt provides the best compromise between power and bulk, and, due to Mesprit's exemplary coverage, it will boost Mesprit's attacks much of the time. Leftovers are certainly an option over Expert Belt should you want Mesprit to have increased longevity, but without Expert Belt, Mesprit often misses out on crucial KOs, which generally makes Leftovers the inferior option.</p> <p>Should you consider putting Mesprit on your team, it's imperative that you take into account Mesprit's unique advantage over Uxie. Mesprit's key advantages over its fellow lake guardian is naturally its significantly higher offenses, which allow it to prevent entry hazard-laying leads such as Omastar and Cloyster from setting up their cumbersome hazards. Uxie, on the other hand, has significantly higher defenses and better Speed, making it the better choice if you need a reliable user of Stealth Rock throughout the match. Thus, Mesprit generally should be used on more offensively-minded teams, as its ability to prevent entry hazards from being set up ensures that offensive teams will not have to worry about Spikes, and its ability to set up Stealth Rock is also generally appreciated by most teams.</p> <p>Therefore, as Mesprit should generally be used on offensive teams, it appreciates offensive partners to take advantage of the immediate offensive presence that it inflicts upon the opponent right from the get-go. Mesprit also needs teammates to make the leads that it loses to, such as Ambipom, Spiritomb, and Registeel, as well as Dark-, Steel-, and bulky Psychic-types, effectively non-issues. Fighting-types like Blaziken and Hariyama make good partners, as their powerful Fighting-type STAB moves OHKO the likes of Ambipom and Registeel, and these two Fighting-types do not care about Will-O-Wisp from Spiritomb due to Blaziken's Fire typing and Hariyama's Guts ability. Dark-types are also great partners, as they form a fantastic Fighting-Psychic-Dark core with Mesprit and its Fighting-type partner, and these Dark-types are able to beat the bulky Psychic-types who are able to wall Mesprit with startling ease.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Although Mesprit usually finds itself taking advantage of its more supportive characteristics, as in terms of raw damage output it is easily eclipsed by Alakazam, Mesprit's saving grace as an offensive Pokemon comes from its combination of Calm Mind and respectable stats all around, which distinguishes it from Uxie, which is extremely weak without a few Calm Minds under its belt, and Alakazam, which is far too frail to set up Calm Mind safely without instantly dying to stray attacks. This set overall is extremely versatile as a result and can play a number of different roles depending on what kind of team it is facing. Against slower teams, it can set up a few Calm Minds and pressure opposing defensive Pokemon with boosted Psychics and coverage moves, whereas against more offensive teams, it can afford to simply fire off attacks as necessary to dent opposing threats or even threaten a sweep with a single Calm Mind boost.</p> <p>Calm Mind plays into Mesprit's strengths very nicely and is key in separating Mesprit from faster, more powerful threats such as Alakazam. Mesprit's bulk and immunity to Ground-type attacks as well as its ability to threaten a myriad of threats make it a fairly easy task to set up a Calm Mind. With a single Calm Mind under its belt, Mesprit is capable of threatening a huge amount of UU's defensive Pokemon. For example, specially defensive Clefable has about a 40% chance of being 2HKOed by a +1 Psychic. The rest of Mesprit's moveset is simply tailored to have the best coverage against the threats that Mesprit is likely to encounter. Psychic, naturally, will always be Mesprit's strongest attack and its best bet against neutral targets, while Thunderbolt will hit most of the Pokemon resistant to Psychic decently hard and strike the likes of Milotic and Slowbro for heavy damage. Hidden Power Ground is Mesprit's best bet against Houndoom and Registeel, which otherwise can take on this set with impunity. However, if support from Pokemon such as Dugtrio is supplied, Ice Beam and Substitute are also reasonable options. Ice Beam hits the likes of Exeggutor and Steelix hard, while Substitute can be used in tandem with Leftovers to provide added safety and the ability to set up Calm Minds against Pokemon that commonly possess status moves like Toxic or Thunder Wave, or allow Mesprit to maneuver around Pokemon with Pursuit, such as Drapion or Spiritomb, more easily.</p> <p>Naturally, as this set is designed to hit as hard as possible, maximum Special Attack and Speed investment is optimal. With 252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature, Mesprit Speed ties with ubiquitous threats such as Venusaur, Altaria, and Kabutops, giving it the chance to potentially outspeed and OHKO these threats in dire situations. Using a Modest nature is generally not a good idea as a result of this if Calm Mind and three attacking moves are run, as the inability to threaten to OHKO these threats is more costly than the slightly higher damage output provided by a Modest nature. However, if Substitute is used over one of Mesprit's coverage moves, using a Modest nature and a more defensive spread is feasible, as the use of Substitute and Leftovers steers Mesprit towards attempting to accrue as many Calm Mind boosts as possible, rather than simply throwing out powerful STAB Psychics and coverage moves from the get-go. However, even on these more defensive spread, significant amounts of Special Attack investment should be used, as spreads that invest too much into Mesprit's defenses risk becoming outclassed by Uxie.</p> <p>Although this set can hit fairly hard, it has its number of hard counters that entirely prevent Mesprit from doing its job. Notably, specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and Registeel are nigh impossible for Mesprit to break through, as are Dark-types such as Spiritomb and Drapion. For this reason, perhaps the best partner to this set it Dugtrio, as it can reliably remove each of these Pokemon bar Spiritomb thanks to its blistering Speed, Arena Trap, and relatively strong Earthquake. However, if Dugtrio, for whatever reason, is not a good fit, there are some other Pokemon that work well. As usual, Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Blaziken are great partners due to their ability to lay down immense pressure against the likes of Chansey and Registeel while also resisting the common Dark-types moves that are launched at Mesprit. Alternatively, Pokemon that can lure in and weaken these Pokemon, such as Exeggutor, Venusaur, or Mismagius are also excellent partners, as by sacrificing themselves, they can do enough damage to these specially defensive Pokemon or Dark-types that they will be easily cleaned up by Mesprit.</p> <p>Aside from Pokemon that can fearlessly take on Mesprit's hard counters, Mesprit also appreciates teammates that can lure in Pokemon that it can freely set up on. Typically, these include Fighting-, Poison-, and Ground-types such as Hitmontop, Hariyama, Weezing, Venusaur, and Donphan, or other slow Pokemon that are threatened by Mesprit's coverage, such as Omastar. For this reason, defensive Steel-types such as Registeel and Steelix are excellent partners, as they lure in Fighting- and Ground-type Pokemon, are resistant to Mesprit's weaknesses, and provide valuable support through status and Stealth Rock.</p>"
      },
      "Weather Support": {
        "description": "<p>With access to both Rain Dance and Sunny Day as well as utility moves such as Healing Wish and Stealth Rock, Mesprit can be an excellent choice for setting up weather conditions for your team. While Mesprit lacks the sheer bulk of Uxie and is nowhere near as fast as its bulkier competitor, Mesprit separates itself from Uxie through its access to Healing Wish, which allows Mesprit to sacrifice itself after setting up its chosen weather condition to bring a fatally weakened sweeper back to life. Furthermore, even without investment, Mesprit can dole out surprisingly respectable amounts of damage with its STAB moves due to its higher base Attack and Special Attack, while Uxie's damage is pitiful in comparison. The combination of these characteristics means that even though Mesprit may not be as reliable at setting up weather conditions as Uxie, Mesprit can do a lot more than simply set up its desired weather condition through its hard-hitting attacks or Healing Wish, giving it a distinct niche and separating it from its arguably more reliable cousin.</p> <p>The choice of whether you wish to use a rain team or a sun team will dictate whether you pick Rain Dance or Sunny Day, along with their respective items, Damp Rock and Heat Rock. Either team archetype is a fine place for Mesprit to fit into, as it has many valuable attributes that allow it to serve key roles in either type of team. On rain teams, Mesprit's Psychic typing allows it to act as a Rain Dance user that isn't as vulnerable to Electric- and Grass-type attacks, letting it come in and set up Rain Dance more easily against these types of Pokemon, and using Healing Wish on one of Ludicolo, Kabutops, or Omastar can present a massive problem that opponents will oftentimes have issues dealing with. On the other hand, on sun teams, Mesprit's immunity to Ground-type attacks lets it defensively complement the Fire-type Pokemon that it will often be paired with. Healing Wish is also especially powerful on these types of teams, as sweepers like Exeggutor and Victreebel become extremely difficult to handle when restored back to full health, and Healing Wish can often give the Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon that are often present in this archetype another opportunity to come in and dish out absurd damage with sun-boosted Fire-type attacks.</p> <p>Outside of Mesprit's weather-summoning move and Healing Wish, there are a variety of options that can be used in its remaining two slots. Psychic is generally the best option for Mesprit's STAB move due to its higher base power, but should you want a physical attack instead of a special attack, Zen Headbutt is a perfectly acceptable option as well. In its last slot, Mesprit can use the ever-necessary Stealth Rock, as setting up both a weather condition and Stealth Rock with one Pokemon can free up valuable teamslots for Pokemon that can capitalize on the weather condition Mesprit will set up. However, if you feel that it is too difficult to set up both Stealth Rock and a weather condition reliably, or if you have a different Pokemon in mind that can set up Stealth Rock, Mesprit can either use Grass Knot to discourage most hazard setters from setting up their hazards early in the game, or use U-turn to let Mesprit gain some momentum for its team without having to use Healing Wish.</p> <p>Max HP and Speed investment is the most optimal EV spread in most scenarios, as the ability to sponge hits more easily and outspeed more threats is often crucial in allowing Mesprit to successfully set up its desired weather condition. A more defensive spread can be formed by shifting those Speed EVs into Mesprit's Defense or Special Defense and slapping on a Calm or a Bold nature. This can be used if you want Mesprit to act as more of a pivot, as this will allow it to sponge attacks more easily and potentially be able to come in more often to set up its desired weather condition. However, the loss of speed is often too much of a drawback to make the extra defensive stats worth it, as Mesprit's key benefit over Uxie is its access to Healing Wish. Max Speed investment allows Mesprit to get off a quick Healing Wish while Mesprit is low before an opponent can finish it off far more often than it would be able to without Speed investment, and this play is usually far too strong to pass up. Furthermore, by taking away one of Mesprit's unique advantages in Healing Wish, you are giving yourself far less of a reason to use it over Uxie, as Uxie will always be the superior defensive pivot no matter how much you invest in defensive EVs.</p> <p>Naturally, the weather condition that Mesprit sets up will determine what partners should be used. If Rain Dance is the weather of choice, typically Water-type Pokemon that possess Swift Swim, such as Ludicolo, Omastar, Kabutops, and Gorebyss all make fantastic partners due to the combination of both a doubled Speed stat and a significantly stronger Water-type STAB move. Alternatively, Electric-type Pokemon that can take advantage of powerful 100% accurate Thunders, such as Manectric, are also great partners, especially due to their access to a Rain-boosted Hidden Power Water to hit the Ground-types that are immune to Thunder. Mesprit works excellently alongside such Pokemon due to its ability to threaten the omnipresent Venusaur with STAB Psychic, whose defensive sets may prove to be tricky to deal with due to its resistance to Water- and Electric-type attacks as well as its respectable bulk. However, if Sunny Day is the weather condition of choice, Pokemon with access to Chlorophyll such as Victreebel and Exeggutor make excellent partners, as the massive speed boost they obtain in the sun allows them to toss around extremely strong Solar Beams that will melt most teams, especially when paired with sun-boosted Hidden Power Fire. Alternatively, some Fire-types, such as Arcanine, Houndoom, and Moltres, can take advantage of the sun to launch ridiculously hard hitting Fire-type attacks at the opposing team while also threatening Pokemon resistant to Fire-type attacks with Solar Beam. Mesprit has particular synergy with such Fire-types due to its ability to use Healing Wish to bring them back into the game, as they are easily worn down between Stealth Rock damage and possibly Life Orb recoil.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf Lead": {
        "description": "<p>While it might seem strange to use a Pokemon for the sheer purpose of Tricking away its Choice Scarf, doing so is a strong strategy when you put said Pokemon in the lead position. Due to the how valued setting up Stealth Rock early in the game is, a good chunk of UU's leads are slow, bulky Pokemon such as Rhyperior that are heavily crippled by being locked into a single move, especially if said move is Stealth Rock. As these Pokemon are typically slow, they are unable to get much mileage out of the attached Choice Scarf and the loss of their Leftovers makes them significantly easier to wear down. Additionally, by wielding a Choice Scarf, Mesprit can outpace typically faster leads to ensure that Stealth Rock is set up early. Though this set does face some heavy competition from Uxie, which can run almost the exact same set, is significantly bulkier, and can be used later in the match to pivot out of attacks with U-turn, Mesprit's stronger U-turns and Zen Headbutts allow it to actually do damage after it has Tricked away its Choice Scarf. Furthermore, in scenarios where Tricking its Choice Scarf away is suboptimal, Mesprit can use its U-turn and Zen Headbutt to revenge kill certain threats, whereas Uxie cannot due to its lack of power.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is a large draw of this set, as Mesprit's ability to set up Stealth Rock before it can be Taunted by Mismagius or Ambipom guarantees that it will be successfully set up. Against slower leads, using Trick on the first turn followed by Stealth Rock ensures that slower leads such as Rhyperior or Omastar are left with an essentially useless item that will likely lock them into Stealth Rock if they use the move after Mesprit. Once Stealth Rock has been set up and its Choice Scarf has been Tricked away, the majority of Mesprit's purpose has been served, but the rest of its moveset ensures that it is not entirely useless. U-turn allows Mesprit to take advantage of its respectable natural bulk and act as a decent pivot mid-game, allowing it to scout incoming switches after forcing out Poison- or Fighting-type Pokemon. Zen Headbutt is the STAB move of choice, as it allows Mesprit to run investment into its Attack stat, making U-turn much more of a threat, and it does respectable damage to most threats like Venusaur, allowing Mesprit to act as an emergency revenge-killer if a sweeper is low enough and it still possesses its Choice Scarf.</p> <p>As the goal of this set is to set up Stealth Rock before Mesprit can be Taunted, running 252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature is necessary, as this ensures that Mesprit can outspeed even Electrode, allowing Mesprit to reliably set up the entry hazard every game. At this point, the remaining EVs do not matter too much, as Mesprit's only goals are to use Stealth Rock and Trick, which it only really needs Speed investment to do. Maximum Attack investment is generally the safest option, as it allows Mesprit to at least be somewhat useful offensively beyond Stealth Rock and Trick, as U-turn will be strong enough to break most Substitutes at the very least, but maximum investment into HP is also a viable option to make Mesprit a bit tankier, allowing it to switch into attacks like Rhyperior’s Rock Blast more easily. If this is done, Healing Wish can be used over Zen Headbutt, as Mesprit really won’t be doing much damage anyway and Healing Wish gives Mesprit another use outside of Stealth Rock and Trick. Alternatively, if your team is sorely lacking on specially attacking threats, Mesprit can run a Timid nature and Psychic over Zen Headbutt with maximum Special Attack investment.</p> <p>Generally, the best partners for this set are sweepers that can take advantage of a defensive wall being Tricked a Choice Scarf to set up. Pokemon such as Rock Polish Torterra, Rock Polish Aggron, and Toxicroak make excellent partners for this reason, as each of these Pokemon can easily set up on a Pokemon locked into a support or resisted STAB move and proceed to apply a ton of pressure to the enemy team. Strong setup sweepers are also excellent partners due to the fact that they tend to lead to more offensive teams, where this Mesprit works much better than an Uxie, which lacks any sort of offensive presence at all. Alternatively, since this Mesprit can lock slow Pokemon into undesirable moves, Dugtrio can also be an excellent partner, as the free switches that can be supplied by these Choice-locked slow Pokemon can allow it to easily trap and KO key targets.</p>"
      },
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>While Trick Room is sometimes a difficult strategy to pull off effectively, Mesprit is an excellent user of the move due to its ability to set up the field condition consistently while also being a respectable attacker on its own. This means that, while it is recommended that this set be used on a team with slow attackers that can take advantage of Trick Room, it may also situationally be used on teams that are not specifically built around the field condition, unlike something like Uxie. The goal of this set is simple: set up Trick Room and proceed to smack the opposing team around with Mesprit's strong coverage and STAB Psychic. The combination of Ice Beam and Thunderbolt provides excellent coverage and is Mesprit's best option for hitting as much of the tier for super effective damage as possible, while Psychic lets Mesprit hit the Pokemon that are neutral to its coverage moves for more damage. If Mesprit is being used on a pure Trick Room team, U-turn is a respectable option over Psychic to let Mesprit bring in a sweeper safely, but it significantly limits Mesprit's own offensive capabilities. In a similar vein, Healing Wish can be an extremely powerful utility option on Trick Room teams, but it relegates Mesprit to a much more supportive role as it will lack the coverage to threaten most teams effectively.</p> <p>The EVs and nature make Mesprit as slow as possible while maximizing its Special Attack and bulk. With a Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs, Mesprit hits a Speed stat of 148. While this may appear to be quite slow at first glance, Mesprit will actually Speed tie with minimum Speed Torterra, and thus outspeed minimum Speed base 55s and below such as Registeel and Chansey. This is beneficial if U-turn is used in some ways, as it means that once Trick Room is active, Mesprit will take the status move or attack from these defensive Pokemon, thus keeping its fellow sweeper unscathed. However, this does mean that if Mesprit is low on health, these Pokemon may be able to KO Mesprit before it can attack if Trick Room is active, which can be important to keep in mind. While a max Speed spread or a more defensive spread can be used to take advantage of Mesprit's ability to tank hits for its sweepers while switching them in unscathed with U-turn, these spreads are generally outclassed by Uxie unless Healing Wish is used, as Mesprit's strength lies in its ability to dish out damage while setting up Trick Room. However, instead of using a Quiet nature and minimum Speed investment, Mesprit can opt to run a slightly faster spread by using a Modest nature instead and the full 31 Speed IVs, as well as 16 EVs in Speed. This has the benefit of allowing Mesprit to be fairly useful outside of Trick Room against slower teams, as it outspeeds most of UU's relevant defensive Pokemon, allowing it to threaten such teams with its strong coverage and STAB Psychic, while also being slow enough to outspeed almost every relevant offensive threat under Trick Room.</p> <p>Naturally, as this Mesprit's main role is to set up Trick Room, slow, powerful Pokemon that can do as much damage as possible are great partners. Pokemon such as Aggron, Azumarill, Hariyama, and Torterra are premier examples of this, as these Pokemon are extremely scary when they are able to freely outspeed enemy Pokemon and throw out their powerful STAB moves. These slow physical attackers are particularly good to pair with Mesprit due to Mesprit's inability to get past specially defensive behemoths such as Registeel, Chansey, or Clefable on its own. It should also be noted that Mesprit should generally not be used as the primary Trick Room setter for a dedicated Trick Room team, as although its stats are fairly good, it lacks the staying power to consistently set up Trick Room throughout the match. For this reason, the likes of Porygon2 or Uxie may be useful to provide an additional Trick Room setter to assist Mesprit in setting up the field condition. However, note that due to Mesprit's offensive capabilities, it does not have to be on a dedicated Trick Room team to function, and that using only one or two slow, powerful Pokemon alongside it is perfectly viable.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Access to a wide range of coverage moves, a solid Speed tier and a respectable Special Attack stat make Mesprit a very solid choice if your team is in need of a revenge killer. By slapping a Choice Scarf onto this pink sprite, Mesprit gains the speed that it needs to successfully revenge kill many dangerous threats in the UU metagame, including the likes of Rock Polish Torterra, Dragon Dance Feraligatr, and Dragon Dance Altaria, which may otherwise be difficult to cover in a single teamslot. On top of that, once certain conditions are met, Mesprit can easily mop up the opposing team with its strong STAB Psychic and blistering Speed with a Choice Scarf attached. Additionally, Mesprit's access to strong utility moves in Trick and U-turn give it enough utility to make itself useful once it has successfully revenge killed the threats that it has been designated to deal with, or if it is being used against a more defensive team that lacks threats that can be easily revenge killed. To top it all off, Mesprit's immunity to Spikes means that it isn't hampered by entry hazards as much as its fellow revenge killers and can easily weave in and out of the match to force out dangerous sweepers.</p> <p>Psychic is Mesprit's strongest attack, and it is Mesprit's best shot at revenge killing Pokemon that are neutral to Ice Beam and Thunderbolt, as well as generally its best shot at occasionally pulling off a successful sweep. Ice Beam provides strong coverage and hits crucial threats such as the aforementioned Rock Polish Torterra and Dragon Dance Altaria, as well as threats such as Sceptile, Exeggutor, and Leafeon. Similarly, Thunderbolt allows Mesprit to slay Dragon Dance Feraligatr as well as Moltres and Azumarill. It is also Mesprit's best shot at dealing damage to Houndoom. The choice of Trick or U-turn depends on whether or not your team needs the ability to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Registeel and Chansey, in which case Trick is superior, or if your team has Pokemon that can take advantage of Mesprit's common switch-ins such as Spiritomb, Houndoom, and Drapion, thus making U-turn an excellent choice for gaining momentum. Additionally, Healing Wish is a viable option in the last slot if your team has a powerful sweeper that can take advantage of a second life, but its utility is typically far more limited throughout the game than either Trick or U-turn.</p> <p>With a Timid nature and maximum Speed EVs along with its Choice Scarf, Mesprit will hit a Speed stat of 426, which outpaces a large portion of UU, including Rock Polish Torterra, Dragon Dance Feraligatr, Alakazam, Moltres, Dragon Dance Altaria, and Rock Polish Aggron. However, note that Mesprit's ability to outspeed Rock Polish Torterra, Dragon Dance Altaria, and Rock Polish Aggron depends on the opponent's use of a neutral nature on these Pokemon rather than a Speed-boosting nature. The rest of the EVs are placed into Special Attack, as with a Timid nature and no power-boosting item such as Life Orb or Expert Belt, Mesprit is actually not that strong, which means it needs all the help it can get.</p> <p>This set is fairly splashable and can be fit onto most teams quite easily, although it is often more suitable for offensive teams that need a fast Choice Scarf-wielding Pokemon to provide insurance against a wide range of threats. If U-turn is used, pairing Mesprit with Dugtrio or Houndoom can be an excellent option to take advantage of the Spiritomb and Registeel that may attempt to switch into Mesprit. Additionally, Fighting-types such as Blaziken, Toxicroak, and Hariyama can be effective at punishing Dark-types such as Spiritomb, Houndoom, and Drapion from freely switching into Mesprit. If Trick is used, using Mesprit as a lure for walls such as Registeel, Milotic, or Chansey can be useful, as crippling these defensive behemoths can set the stage for other strong special attackers such as Sceptile or Moltres to sweep. Alternatively, Tricking a wall can allow a setup sweeper such as Rock Polish Torterra, Rock Polish Aggron, or Toxicroak to freely set up and pressure the opposing team. Furthermore, as this Mesprit set lacks power, Pokemon that can set up Spikes are appreciated, such as Omastar, Qwilfish, and Cloyster, as they increase the likelihood that Mesprit can sweep through the opposing team while also providing more residual damage to punish switches into Mesprit's U-turn.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>While Mesprit is mostly seen as a specially offensive threat or a supportive Pokemon, Mesprit can actually be a surprisingly solid physical attacker when equipped with a Choice Band. The combination of surprise value and the utility of a powerful U-turn and Trick make this set a reasonable option for certain teams, especially ones that are looking to bait typical responses to Mesprit, including Dark-types such as Houndoom, Drapion, and Spiritomb, as well as special walls such as Chansey or Clefable, into taking solid damage from Mesprit's Choice Band-boosted U-turns or Zen Headbutts. These factors, in combination with Mesprit's respectable coverage due to its access to Ice Punch, Thunder Punch, and Fire Punch all make this a viable, albeit fairly unorthodox way of using Mesprit. As the captain of a great brigade once said, although it is not Mesprit's finest set, it would be unwise to dismiss it entirely as it is a set Mesprit can still use with some effectiveness.</p> <p>Thanks to the healthy Attack boost from Choice Band, Zen Headbutt does a startling amount of damage to many of the special walls that commonly want to switch into Mesprit, cleanly 2HKOing Chansey and Clefable on the switch. U-turn acts as solid coverage against Dark-type Pokemon, 3HKOing most Spiritomb and Drapion, and provides a way for Mesprit to scout the composition of the opposing team. Of the other coverage moves that Mesprit has available to it, Fire Punch is its best option due to its ability to solidly dent Registeel and Steelix. Finally, as Mesprit does not have too many other physical options, Trick is the best move it can run in its last slot, as it allows Mesprit to at least cripple physically defensive Pokemon that it has no hopes of denting, such as Slowbro. However, be wary of using Trick with no restraint, as unlike with Tricking a Choice Scarf, Tricking a Choice Band can actually have detrimental effects if given to a Pokemon such as Rhyperior.</p> <p>Like most Choice Band-wielding Pokemon, maximum Attack and Speed investment is the best EV spread for Mesprit, as it gives it the Speed and power to perform its job effectively. In particular, due to the low Base Power of Mesprit's moves, it desperately needs every single point it can get in Attack, and Mesprit's base 80 Speed puts it right in line with other prominent Pokemon in the DPP UU metagame, including the omnipresent Venusaur, making it far too valuable to pass up. Although an Adamant nature may seem appealing due to just how weak Mesprit is, losing the potential ability to outspeed and OHKO Venusaur is far too much of a tradeoff to make it worthwhile. If Trick is found to be less impactful than desired, Thunder Punch can be run over it so Mesprit can 2HKO physically defensive Milotic most of the time after Stealth Rock, although generally if it is anticipated that Milotic will switch in, Tricking it tends to leave it more useless than simply hitting it hard with Thunder Punch.</p> <p>Due to the niche nature of this set, specific partners need to be used in order to make this set worthwhile. In particular, teams using this Mesprit set need to use special attackers that appreciate having the likes of Chansey, Clefable, or Registeel severely weakened in order to sweep. Fortunately, there are a decent number of Pokemon that can take advantage of this in UU, including Pokemon such as Life Orb Venusaur, Sceptile, and Mismagius. Without these kinds of Pokemon, Mesprit becomes extremely weak, as its sole purpose is to lure in and cripple these defensive threats to the point where they are no longer capable of handling such strong special attacking Pokemon. However, if there is one other application where this Mesprit can be used somewhat effectively, it would have to be on a team with plenty of other strong Pokemon with U-turn, such as the likes of Swellow and Scyther, in order to create a significant amount of pressure through spamming U-turn. In tandem with hazard support in Spikes and Stealth Rock, Mesprit and its partners can wear down physical walls to the point where they are weak enough to be swept by another strong, physical sweeper.</p>"

  "Regigigas": {
    "overview": "<p>This is Regigigas; he needs no introduction, as with stats like his, everyone knows that he should be able to do some serious damage. Unfortunately, the biggest letdown with Regigigas is that in order for him to 'do serious damage', he has to survive five turns in battle before his crippling ability, Slow Start, wears off. During those five turns, the opponent almost always either massacres Regigigas or does whatever he or she pleases and phazes him at the last possible moment.</p> <p>Regigigas isn't all bad news, though, and can actually do something useful in the UU tier, where his raw defensive stats make his survival possible. Base 110 defenses across the board are tough to break, and the general lack of phazers helps Regigigas even more. Once Regigigas has stalled those five turns, he can proceed to crush skulls with his base 160 Attack stat and base 100 Speed stat. While he may not be the prodigal son of legendary Pokemon, Regigigas can certainly hold his own in a tier that isn't used to dealing with Pokemon of his stature.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Regigigas doesn't have a shallow movepool by any means, but almost all of his worthwhile options are rendered useless by Slow Start. Rock Polish would be great if he wasn't at half Speed and Attack for 5 turns. A set consisting of Focus Punch and Substitute might sound great on paper, but it's pretty terrible when you factor in Slow Start's effect on Regigigas's Attack and the lack of STAB. Outside of that, Regigigas has a decent special movepool in Thunderbolt, Focus Blast, and Earth Power, but lacks both the Special Attack and the Speed to utilize it effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Regigigas's best responses are Fighting-type Pokemon. No matter which attacking moves Regigigas runs, Fighting-type Pokemon will trouble him. Hitmontop tops this list--no pun intended--with Intimidate to catch Regigigas before he can Substitute and STAB Close Combat to eliminate him. After Hitmontop, Guts Hariyama is a superb response because of Guts turning status used against it into a deadly weapon. Lastly, Hitmonlee is also an excellent choice because of his immunity to Thunder Wave and immense power. Bulky Ghost-type Pokemon fare well against Regigigas even if he carries Fire Punch; they are immune to Regigigas's only STAB and will do quite a bit of damage if they pack Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <p>One of the worst things you can do is try to stall Regigigas out with Pokemon like Steelix or Chansey. If Slow Start ever wears off, your Pokemon will be in for a world of hurt. The only time you should attempt to stall Regigigas out is if you have Toxic Spikes in play. If Regigigas gets poisoned, he is pretty much dead in the water, as he then no longer has even the slimmest chance to stall out Slow Start. Phazing is also one of the best ways to deal with Regigigas; Perish Song, Whirlwind, and Roar will all force Regigigas out prematurely, killing any chance he has of threatening your team.</p>",

      "Stall": {
        "description": "<p>The first order of business for any offensively minded Regigigas is to stall out the Slow Start turns so Regigigas can grind bones to make his bread. Because Regigigas lacks obvious means to do this, such as Rest and Protect, more creative methods are employed.</p> <p>Thunder Wave slows opposing Pokemon down so that even Regigigas can outspeed them and then either repeatedly Substitute or employ Confuse Ray to complete the parafusion combo. Both strategies work effectively in different situations for stalling the Slow Start turns, but Regigigas's Substitutes are notoriously difficult to break without super effective or very powerful STAB attacks, generally making Substitute the way to go. In the last slot, Earthquake and Fire Punch are both useful. Earthquake leaves Regigigas helpless against the commonly seen Ground-immune Ghost-types of UU, Mismagius and Rotom, whereas Fire Punch is much weaker and will make it difficult to break through Rhyperior, Omastar, and even Kabutops.</p> <p>The EV spread is designed primarily for after Slow Start has worn off, as Regigigas is painfully slow and painfully weak during the turns he has to stall. 252 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature allow Regigigas to pound opposing Pokemon as hard as possible. Once Slow Start has worn off, 208 Speed EVs allow Regigigas to outspeed all Milotic, which is an important benchmark. A more physically or specially bulky spread can be used to great effect, particularly with 252 HP EVs so that Seismic Toss will never break Regigigas's Substitutes. Lastly, mono-Normal-type coverage is not bad in UU, so you can replace the attacking move in the last slot with whichever move from the third slot you didn't use; however, doing this leaves Regigigas walled by a few key threats, so it can be a risky move.</p> <p>Make sure that your team can cover whichever Pokemon totally wall Regigigas's attacking options. If you go with Earthquake, Pursuit Houndoom and Choice Band Spiritomb make excellent partners for their ability to brutally massacre Ghost-types that try to wall Regigigas. With Fire Punch, Pokemon like Donphan, Venusaur, Tangrowth, and Leafeon make great partners. Donphan can come in on brutally powerful physical attacks from the likes of Rhyperior and Aggron, both of which stop Regigigas cold. Bulky variants of Tangrowth, Venusaur, and Leafeon can switch into Kabutops and Omastar and threaten them with support moves and powerful Grass-type attacks. It is also useful to have Pokemon that can take the Fighting-type attacks that Regigigas will lure during his setup. Good options for this are Nidoqueen and Weezing, the former of which can set up Toxic Spikes and the latter of which can burn pesky Fighting-type Pokemon.</p>"
      },
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<p>Regigigas actually has one of the best sets of combined defensive stats of any Pokemon in the tier, beating out even Uxie and Milotic. Couple this defensive prowess with the potential to do serious damage after Slow Start has worn off and Regigigas can pose a serious threat to any team without super effective Fighting-type attacks to fight back with.</p> <p>Return and one of Earthquake or Fire Punch are Regigigas's attacking options. With Earthquake, Ghost-type Pokemon are an issue, and with Fire Punch, Rock-type Pokemon are a problem. In the third slot, either Thunder Wave or Toxic is selected to cripple opposing Pokemon. Lastly, Knock Off is a really irritating move to hit anything with, as virtually every Pokemon in the game relies on their item to some extent. Choice Band Rhyperior will hate losing that power, while Hitmontop and Hitmonlee will be loath to lose Leftovers and Choice Scarf, respectively.</p> <p>The EV spread is chosen for maximum defensive prowess, but a specially bulky build is entirely viable as well based on what your team needs. No Attack or Speed is necessary on this set as Regigigas really isn't aiming to stall out the Slow Start turns and is instead using his impressive defenses to stop opponents in their tracks.</p> <p>For teammates, this Regigigas particularly wants Pokemon that can switch into powerful Fighting-type attacks and simultaneously take the threats that Regigigas misses with his coverage. If running Earthquake, a specially defensive Altaria makes a great teammate for just that reason. With Fire Punch, Donphan, Weezing, and Nidoqueen become more valuable teammates. These three Pokemon can come in on the assorted offensive threats that can mash Regigigas and take his attacks with ease, like Rhyperior and Aggron. Bulky Milotic is also a useful teammate since it is able to take these powerful attacks at full health and OHKO back. Additionally, Grass-type teammates, such as Tangrowth and Venusaur, are exceptional partners with their resistances and support options.</p>"

  "Phione": {
    "overview": "<p>Aside from having a cuter name, Phione is essentially a cheap rip-off of the mighty Manaphy. While it shares Manaphy's ability and typing, Phione's lack of key moves such as Tail Glow and Calm Mind makes it a lot less threatening, even in the UU tier. However, Phione's near-unique ability in Hydration and usable stats allow Phione to act as a solid Rain Dance supporter or attacker. Although Phione is not an overwhelming force in its own right, do not underestimate what it can do for its team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Phione's movepool is not particularly large. Due to its great coverage and access to U-turn, a Choice Specs set is plausible. However, Phione's mediocre stats mean that most UU Water-types outclass it in this role. Charm and Acid Armor lower the foe's Attack and boost Phione's Defense, respectively, but since most of its counters attack on the special side, they aren't really useful for Phione. Hidden Power Psychic is possible on the Rain Dance supporter set to prevent Toxicroak and Poliwrath from freely setting up on Phione.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Water Absorbers such as Toxicroak and Poliwrath make Phione's job extremely difficult. Toxicroak can switch into anything that Phione throws at it, set up with Swords Dance or Nasty Plot, and proceed to sweep while being healed by the rain due to Dry Skin. Poliwrath can set up a Substitute in Phione's face and proceed to fire off powerful STAB Focus Punches. Lanturn takes little damage from Phione's attacks, as even Grass Knot only hits for a meager 40 Base Power. Electric-types such as Manectric and Rotom can outspeed and OHKO Phione with Thunderbolt if they switch in on anything apart from Surf or Waterfall. Venusaur is also a huge threat to Phione, capable of switching into any attack apart from Ice Beam, and threatening to OHKO with its powerful Grass-type STAB of choice. Taunt users can completely almost shut down the rain supporter set. Mismagius can use Taunt to stop Phione from setting up rain, then set up Nasty Plot or Calm Mind. Ambipom is also a great user of Taunt, and is capable of hitting Phione hard with its powerful Return.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rain Dance Support": {
        "description": "<p>Phione's main niche in the UU metagame is to function as a bulky rain supporter. With its ability, Hydration, Phione is able to repeatedly switch in and set up Rain Dance while Resting off any damage taken. Hydration also allows Phione to act as an excellent status absorber for rain teams, preventing its fellow rain sweepers from being crippled. Waterfall is Phione's main STAB move and hits reasonably hard in the rain. U-turn is the icing on the cake, allowing Phione to scout the opponent's switch-in while enabling rain sweepers to come in unscathed.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Phione's bulk, while allowing it to Speed tie with its fellow base 80s, most notably Venusaur. If you want to play Phione more aggressively, an EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe can be used; however, Phione won't be able to set up Rain Dance nearly as many times as it can with the main spread if it chooses to utilize such an offensive EV spread. Damp Rock is the item of choice, allowing Phione to create an eight-turn Rain Dance. Heal Bell can be used in place of U-turn to cure status for your team, though U-turn is extremely useful for scouting purposes, one of the main reasons you should even consider using Phione on your team.</p> <p>It should be noted that by using Phione, you are adding additional Electric- and Grass-type weaknesses for your Rain Dance team to struggle with. For this reason, Pokemon that resist these attacking types are essential teammates. Grass-, Dragon-, and Ground-types, such as Tangrowth, Altaria, and Rhyperior, can cover these weaknesses well, while forming decent defensive cores on a Rain team. Since Phione is dedicated to setting up rain for the rest of the its team, Pokemon that can abuse the rain are essential teammates. Kabutops, Ludicolo, Qwilfish, Omastar, and Gorebyss are all extremely deadly sweepers in the rain, making them excellent partners.</p> <p>Toxicroak and Poliwrath are the biggest threats to Phione and its team. These Pokemon can switch into Phione as it uses Rain Dance, and set up Substitute, Nasty Plot, or Swords Dance as Phione switches out. Uxie and Weezing can wall Toxicroak and Poliwrath without much difficulty; additionally, both Pokemon are able to set up Rain Dance themselves, making them wonderful teammates. Venusaur is a very good teammate to Phione because of its ability to switch into Grass- and Electric-type attacks with ease. It can also absorb Toxic Spikes, which are quite troublesome for rain teams.</p>"
      },
      "Rain Dance Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set is Phione's best attempt at being an offensive Pokemon. By using Rain Dance, Phione becomes immune to status and can use Rest to restore all of its HP in a single turn. In the rain, Surf becomes a powerful move that deals large amounts of damage to any Pokemon that does not resist it. Grass Knot helps Phione deal with the myriad of bulky Water-types in UU, while Ice Beam allows Phione to hit Venusaur and other Grass-types for super effective damage. Toxic can be used in the third slot, enabling Phione to stall and attack at the same time.</p> <p>If you're using Toxic in the third slot, it is generally a better idea to run a bulkier EV spread such as 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe. Such a spread allows Phione to both take hits and stall much more effectively. Leftovers is the item of choice due to the additional longevity it grants Phione; however, Damp Rock can be used if you want the rain to last longer.</p> <p>Venusaur is a major threat to Phione, due to its ability to switch into any move apart from Ice Beam. Even though Phione Speed ties with Venusaur, it won't always be able to come out on top against Venusaur. Specially defensive Weezing is possibly the best switch-in to Venusaur, as it resists both of Venusaur's STABs and is indifferent to Sleep Powder thanks to Rest and Sleep Talk. Registeel can also switch into all special variants of Venusaur without much hassle. Apart from Venusaur, strong Electric-types such as Manectric, Rotom, and Lanturn can deal huge amounts of damage to Phione. Venusaur is, ironically, an excellent teammate for this reason, as it is able to absorb Thunderbolt and threaten such Pokemon with its powerful STAB moves. Manectric's Flamethrower will also be weakened by rain, making it a non-threat to Phione's Grass-type teammates.</p>"
