Use Endure liberally, as teams that appear to be weak to Shedinja at first glance may have surprise coverage options to overcome it.</p> </li> <li> <p>X-Scissor is an alternative to Endure that lets Shedinja hit Dark-types super effectively and keeps Normal-types from completely walling it, but it won't be able to scout for fatal coverage. Even with X-Scissor, Shedinja still will not deal much damage to most Normal- and Dark-types, so teammates that can handle them make for great partners.
