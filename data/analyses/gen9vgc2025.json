    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Charizard is a powerful wallbreaker solely used on teams that can set the sun consistently in order to activate Solar Power and to increase the damage of its Fire-type attacks. With its high Speed tier, Charizard outruns the majority of the metagame, but it struggles against faster foes that threaten to KO or disrupt Charizard such as Garchomp and Alolan Ninetales, so it appreciates Tailwind support. Charizard also greatly appreciates damage mitigation and redirection, since it is unable to use Protect and is relatively frail. Partners that use Fake Out can also provide Charizard opportunities to deal devastating damage without taking damage in return.</li> <li>Torkoal is Charizard's primary partner, providing sun with its Drought ability. Torkoal can additionally support Charizard's damage further with Helping Hand, and it can finish off weakened foes with its own Fire-type attacks. Eject Pack Torkoal can also reset the sun immediately after it gets Intimidated or after using Overheat when it is slower than its foes to pivot Charizard onto the field unharmed.</li> <li>Jumpluff is commonly paired with Charizard. Charizard and Jumpluff both benefit from the sun, as Charizard's power output skyrockets and Jumpluff outspeeds the entire metagame thanks to Chlorophyll. This allows Jumpluff to support Charizard by setting up Tailwind as well as disrupting foes with Sleep Powder before they can attack. Jumpluff is also capable of redirecting attacks with Rage Powder. If the sun expires or is overridden, Jumpluff can use Sunny Day to reset it. Jumpluff additionally can heal Charizard and the rest of the team with Pollen Puff.</li> <li>Incineroar is also often found on teams with Charizard, where it provides disruption with Fake Out and damage reduction with Intimidate; this Intimidate allows Charizard to survive Rock Slide from Garchomp. Parting Shot or U-turn can also be used to pivot Charizard onto the field safely if Incineroar is slower than its foes.</li> <li>Charizard is significantly threatened by Pelipper and Basculegion-M. Pelipper overrides sun with its Drizzle, while Basculegion-M outspeeds Charizard with Choice Scarf or while rain is active. Additionally, both easily KO Charizard with their Water-type attacks.</li> <li>Tyranitar and Excadrill are also very problematic. Tyranitar sets sand and takes little damage from Charizard, and Excadrill outspeeds Charizard in sand. They both easily threaten Charizard with Rock Slide.</li> <li>Bulky partners like Porygon2 can support Charizard by switching into opposing attacks, potentially threatening Charizard's threats, and setting Trick Room for Ursaluna, another common partner for Charizard. Porygon2 can Terastallize into a Fighting-type to threaten Tyranitar and Excadrill with Tera Blast. Ursaluna, when under Trick Room, can move before Pelipper, Basculegion-M, Tyranitar, and Excadrill and threaten them with Facade and Headlong Rush. Incineroar also functions well with these Trick Room partners, threatening to KO Basculegion-M with Knock Off as well as reducing the damage dealt by Tyranitar and Excadrill with Intimidate and Parting Shot. Torkoal can also help mitigate these threats by setting sun to disable Swift Swim and Sand Rush, weakening the damage of Water-type attacks, and reducing Tyranitar's special bulk. Incineroar is also capable of removing crucial defensive items such as Focus Sash and Assault Vest with Knock Off so Charizard can pick off the Pokemon that used them.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Charizard is a hyper offensive sweeper that aims to deal as much damage as it can with its Fire-type attacks. It excels in matchups where the opponent lacks ways to override the sun or when Charizard can deal damage before it is damaged by foes.</li> <li>Opposing weather is by far Charizard's greatest weakness. To counter this, Torkoal should be kept in the back often so it can be switched in to override the opposing weather. Otherwise, relying on the Trick Room mode from Porygon2 and Ursaluna is best because that core has a better matchup against weather. Hard Trick Room teams featuring Hatterene and Indeedee-F are also difficult for Charizard to overcome. Incineroar works well in this matchup to take hits while stalling out turns until Trick Room expires. Porygon2 can also reverse Trick Room, and Ursaluna can potentially make use of the Trick Room set by the opponent to sweep.</li> </ul>",

With these damage multipliers, Charizard is capable of OHKOing and 2HKOing the entire metagame with its Fire-type attacks.</li> <li>Heat Wave is Charizard's most used attack, providing good spread damage. Weather Ball provides consistent single-target damage while weather is active and is unaffected by Wide Guard. Overheat deals significant damage to bulkier foes such as Ursaluna-B and Archaludon. Air Slash threatens Fighting-types like Sneasler as well as Grass-types like Sinistcha while rain is active. Dragon Pulse can be used instead of Air Slash to threaten Dragon-types like Dragonite and Dragapult that resist Charizard's Fire-type attacks.</li> <li>Choice Specs is the most commonly used item to significantly increase Charizard's damage, allowing it to 2HKO Pokemon that resist its Fire-type attacks such as Incineroar and Tyranitar in the sun with Weather Ball. Notably, Choice Specs allows Charizard to OHKO Assault Vest Archaludon and Porygon2 in the sun with Overheat.</li> <li>Tera Ghost provides Charizard with an immunity to Fake Out so it can continue to deal massive damage uninterrupted, and it sheds Charizard's weaknesses to Water- and Electric-type attacks such as Basculegion-M's Wave Crash and Archaludon's Electro Shot.</li> </ul>"

Calyrex-S lacks bulk, so the redirection from Clefairy can let Calyrex-S live longer. After You can help Calyrex-S move first in Trick Room, where it normally struggles due to its high Speed.

  "Clefable": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Clefable is best placed on balance teams, using its supportive options, namely Follow Me and Life Dew, to help ally sweepers to set up or to just support its allies in general. Additionally, it pairs well with frail Pokemon, as Follow Me can protect them from powerful moves that would otherwise OHKO them.</li> <li>Sneasler is a great partner for Clefable, as it threatens Pokemon such as Archaludon that scare away Clefable. Sneasler also beats the most common Taunt and Encore users, Maushold and Whimsicott, so they cannot disrupt Clefable in any way. In return, Clefable can redirect attacks such as Scale Shot from Dragonite that would otherwise threaten Sneasler.</li> <li>Kingambit is able to use both Kowtow Cleave and Sucker Punch to threaten Gholdengo, a Pokemon that Clefable cannot beat otherwise. In return, Clefable hits Fighting-types like Annihilape hard with Moonblast and redirects attacks for Kingambit to safely set up with Swords Dance. Volcarona can also threaten Gholdengo, appreciating Clefable's redirection and ability to chip down Dragon-types like Dragonite with Moonblast.</li> <li>Gholdengo is able to beat Sneasler, which, with Dire Claw, would threaten Clefable. In return, Clefable can use Follow Me to let Gholdengo set up with Nasty Plot safely while also providing potential speed control in Thunder Wave, helping with Gholdengo's sometimes underwhelming Speed stat. Clefable can notably take on Dark-type moves from Kingambit and Incineroar for Gholdengo.</li> <li>Clefable struggles into top Pokemon, namely Steel-types like Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Archaludon and Poison-types like Sneasler and Amoonguss. Amoonguss in particular is very annoying for Clefable, as it is bulky, resists Moonblast, doesn't care all too much about Thunder Wave, annoys non-Safety Goggles sets with Spore, and threatens Clefable with Sludge Bomb. Fighting- and Ground-types like Sneasler and Ursaluna can take down Steel-types, while Kingambit in particular can take out Gholdengo. Amoonguss and other Poison-types can be handled by partner Gholdengo, which is immune to their Poison-type attacks. Taunt and Encore from the likes of Maushold, Whimsicott, and Alolan Ninetales can also be a nuisance for Clefable's supportive duties. Allies like the aforementioned Gholdengo can switch in on Taunt and Encore, ignoring them entirely thanks to Good as Gold; Mental Herb will also work, although it means Clefable does not have the increased survivability from Sitrus Berry or a safety barrier against Spore and Sleep Powder from Amoonguss and Jumpluff, respectively.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Clefable's role is to support the team with redirection and recovery support with Follow Me and Life Dew, respectively, while also providing as a check to setup Pokemon, chunking them down with Moonblast and tanking hits that other Pokemon wouldn't be able to do.</li> <li>Clefable can be brought out at any point of the game, but it should be reserved for those setup sweepers if expected. When playing against offensive teams that lack setup Pokemon, Clefable, if brought, should focus more on providing support with Life Dew or Thunder Wave and redirecting attacks rather than dealing damage. Most notably, Clefable should be brought in the Dondozo and Tatsugiri matchup, as it is able to completely ignore the boosts Dondozo receives from Tatsugiri's Commander, making it easy for Clefable to chunk Dondozo down with Moonblast without taking too much damage.</li> <li>As mentioned before, Steel-types like Archaludon counter Clefable. Fighting-types like Annihilape and Sneasler and Ground-types such as the Ursaluna formes can help stop select Steel-types dead in their tracks, as well as Fire- and Water-types like Incineroar and ally Dondozo that resist their Steel-type attacks. Taunt and Encore are big issues for Clefable that aren't holding Mental Herb, so try to position around them and remove the Taunt and Encore users as fast as possible with Pokemon such as the aforementioned Sneasler and Gholdengo. Clefable is also pretty easy to take advantage of due to its passive nature, so surround Clefable with offensive allies that deal loads of damage such as a boosted Gholdengo and Dragonite.</li> </ul>",

Clefable, with its Fairy typing, does well into the Dragon-infested format of Regulation H, threatening Pokemon such as Baxcalibur, Hydreigon, and Dragonite with significant damage.</li> <li>Life Dew provides healing support for the team, helping Clefable and its allies stay on the field longer. Thunder Wave can be used instead of Life Dew to provide speed control against faster foes such as Dragapult and Sneasler.</li> <li>Sitrus Berry is used to keep Clefable healthy when redirecting powerful attacks such as Wood Hammer from Rillaboom and Electro Shot from Archaludon. Safety Goggles allows Clefable to redirect away Spore from Amoonguss comfortably, while Mental Herb prevents Clefable from getting disrupted by Taunt and Encore from the likes of Maushold and Whimsicott.</li> <li>Tera Water provides Clefable with a key resistance to Steel-type attacks, notably Make It Rain from Gholdengo and Flash Cannon from Archaludon. It also gives Clefable resistances to Wave Crash from Basculegion-M, Weather Ball from Pelipper, and Flare Blitz from Incineroar and Hisuian Arcanine, which would all otherwise deal huge chunks of damage to Clefable. It does, however, have the unfortunate drawback of being weak to Rillaboom's Wood Hammer and Archaludon's Electro Shot.</li> <li>The HP and Defense allow Clefable to survive an Iron Head from Kingambit, a Wave Crash from Choice Band Basculegion-M outside of rain, or a Dire Claw from Sneasler. The Special Defense investment allows Clefable to survive Make It Rain from Life Orb Timid Gholdengo with 116 Special Attack EVs or Blood Moon from Ursaluna-B.</li> <li>Clefable is great at disturbing a lot of the setup sweepers in the format, namely Annihilape and the combination of Dondozo and Tatsugiri. Clefable additionally does a good job at beating other top Pokemon such as Dragonite because it is immune to Scale Shot and can retaliate with Moonblast. While Clefable does beat a lot of setup sweepers, some of the most popular ones, notably Gholdengo, can still break through Clefable with their Steel-type attacks.</li> </ul>"

  "Ninetales-Alola": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Alolan Ninetales heavily struggles against Gholdengo, being unable to punish it with Encore or threaten it with its STAB moves. Fire-types like Incineroar, Hisuian Arcanine, and Volcarona put pressure on Alolan Ninetales while shrugging off all of its attacks. Opposing weather control like Tyranitar and Torkoal are also major issues, making Alolan Ninetales's Blizzard inaccurate and Aurora Veil useless.</li> <li>Dragonite works well with both sets, providing speed control and taking on the Fire-types Alolan Ninetales is weak to, especially with Stomping Tantrum.</li> <li>Offensive Alolan Ninetales is strongest with other offensive threats to overwhelm the opposing team with Pokemon that cover each other's checks. The most notable of these are Sneasler and Kingambit. Sneasler can threaten Incineroar for a lot of damage and has a faster Fake Out but struggles to damage Dragonite and Gholdengo. Alolan Ninetales can cover for Dragonite and Kingambit can take on Gholdengo.</li> <li>Screens setter Alolan Ninetales works best alongside multiple setup sweepers that can steal the game when supported well. Annihilape and Gholdengo cannot be slowed down by Fake Out and hit the majority of the metagame for great damage. Annihilape and Gholdengo also notably take care of Incineroar and Sneasler, two of Alolan Ninetales's toughest matchups.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Offensive Alolan Ninetales's primary role is as a fast sweeper with unique support options. It is best when dishing out early damage while being supported by Fake Out or redirection and going down after taking on what it's expected to handle so Alolan Ninetales's teammates can clean up. Screens setter Alolan Ninetales is strongest when it sets up screens for its team and faints soon after, ensuring its teammates can take full advantage of the Aurora Veil turns and being not nearly as passive.</li> <li>Offensive Alolan Ninetales's flexibility allows it to be an excellent lead Pokemon, threatening foes with powerful Blizzards, Icy Wind speed control, and often Aurora Veil support. This lets it adapt in many lead matchups and position itself in a way to win the game. Choice Specs Alolan Ninetales also plays similarly, as its damage output is rather forceful from turn 1. After Alolan Ninetales impacts the game, it's good to send out your other offensive Pokemon that can finish the job most efficiently. Screens setter Alolan Ninetales also finds itself as a lead, but for different reasons. Alolan Ninetales can use its many support options to set the board for sweepers like Gholdengo and Annihilape to come in and set up. Alolan Ninetales may want to Terastallize if opposing Pokemon threaten to KO it before it sets up Aurora Veil or when interested in sticking around for Icy Wind and Encore support.</li> <li>Gholdengo is Alolan Ninetales's most reliable answer, as Alolan Ninetales cannot threaten it or lock it into a move with Encore. Alolan Ninetales is also 4x weak to Make It Rain and weak to Shadow Ball after Terastallizing into a Ghost-type. Tyranitar is also a great counter, overriding weather and passively breaking Alolan Ninetales's Focus Sash. It's wise to use Kingambit and Annihilape to threaten these Pokemon while preserving Alolan Ninetales, by switching it out once its checks enter the field.</li> </ul>",

Aurora Veil is a great move to increase the team's longevity when Alolan Ninetales can't do a lot on the field or take advantage of defensive play. Encore can be used over these two to better punish defensive play and discourage Fake Out, especially if Alolan Ninetales does not carry Protect. Moonblast and Dazzling Gleam are great secondary STAB moves on Choice Specs variants, threatening 2HKOs on Kingambit and Annihilape, respectively, and ensuring Alolan Ninetales doesn't get walled by Incineroar. Icy Wind is preferred over Protect to provide Alolan Ninetales with speed control.</li> <li>Focus Sash is preferred to get around Alolan Ninetales's poor defensive typing, Choice Specs and Never-Melt Ice sacrifice longevity for better damage rolls against the metagame; Choice Specs Blizzard OHKOes Ursaluna-B and Never-Melt Ice Blizzard guarantees a 2HKO on uninvested Archaludon not holding an Assault Vest.</li> <li>Alolan Ninetales prefers Tera Ghost across all its sets, as it provides an immunity to Fake Out and sheds all of its weaknesses.

Galarian Weezing has a good matchup against teams that rely on Grimmsnarl to take hits, as it is able to disrupt it with Taunt before it can set up dual screens, allowing powerful partners like Koraidon and Calyrex-S to sweep through teams. Neutralizing Gas also makes it a lot harder for Miraidon and Kyogre, which are quite reliant on their respective field effects, to damage Galarian Weezing's partners.</li> <li>Taunt allows Galarian Weezing to effectively shut down Grimmsnarl, Amoonguss, and Brute Bonnet, as well as preventing the opposing team's Trick Room. Will-O-Wisp can easily cripple physical attackers such as Zamazenta-C, Calyrex-I, and Iron Hands. Toxic Spikes and Poison Gas negate recovery on Terapagos and Calyrex-I while also making it easier for a partner Calyrex-S to clean up a team that has been chipped down. Strange Steam is guaranteed to OHKO Koraidon while getting around Wide Guard, and Dazzling Gleam is a slightly weaker spread option that can consistently chip down enemies. Play Rough is a physical Fairy-type STAB move that allows Galarian Weezing to do much much more damage to Assualt Vest Iron Hands and Miraidon.</li> <li>Covert Cloak prevents Fake Out flinches from Iron Hands, Incineroar, and Rillaboom, allowing it to support its team without being slowed down and making it easier to stop Trick Room. Rocky Helmet does good chip damage to Koraidon, Zamazenta-C, and Iron Hands. It's also useful to break Urshifu-R or Chien-Pao's Focus Sash. Safety Goggles gives Galarian Weezing an immunity to Brute Bonnet and Amoonguss's Spore and Rage Powder.</li> <li>The EVs guarantee Galarian Weezing can survive a Behemoth Bash or Heavy Slam from Zamazenta-C, allowing Galarian Weezing to burn it with Will-O-Wisp. Galarian Weezing is also guaranteed to survive a Choice Specs Miraidon Electro Drift without Terrain, forcing the opponent to double target Galarian Weezing. The Speed investment lets Galarian Weezing outspeed Grimmsnarl and shut down its supportive capabilities with Taunt.</li> <li>Tera Water is used to give Galarian Weezing resistances to Calyrex-I's Glacial Lance, Koraidon's Flare Blitz, and Zamazenta-C's Behemoth Bash and Heavy Slam. Tera Dark grants Galarian Weezing an immunity to Calyrex-S's Psychic and a resistance to its Astral Barrage.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Incineroar, Tornadus, and Flutter Mane can all outspeed Galarian Weezing and use Taunt, reducing its effectiveness on the field. Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade can OHKO Galarian Weezing with a good roll, and its Steel typing gives it a resistance to Dazzling Gleam and Strange Steam as well as an immunity to Poison Gas and Toxic Spikes. Amoonguss can also check Galarian Weezing, as Spore can completely shut it down, and Amoonguss easily shrugs off Strange Steam and Dazzling Gleam while having an immunity to Poison Gas and removing Toxic Spikes on entry.</li> <li>Galarian Weezing is a good partner for Koraidon and Calyrex-S, as it turns off many of the main defensive tools of balance teams. Although Neutralizing Gas forces Koraidon to use the Ability Shield, shutting down Incineroar's Intimidate and Grimmsnarl's Prankster makes it much easier for Koraidon to sweep through teams unchecked. Disabling abilities like Protosynthesis, Quark Drive, and Prankster allows Calyrex-S to outspeed almost everything in the metagame and pressure teams with Astral Barrage. Koraidon is able to heavily threaten Incineroar, Amoonguss, and Zacian-C, while Calyrex-S can help against Flutter Mane.</li> <li>Galarian Weezing pairs well with Dondozo and Tatsugiri, as it is able to spread status with Poison Gas and Toxic Spikes, allowing Dondozo to clean up late-game while taking little damage from foes and healing with Leftovers.</li> </ul>"

  "Magmar": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Since Magmar’s primary role is redirection, it pairs best with teammates that can either apply immediate offensive pressure or set up for a potential sweep. Although there are other popular teammates like Gholdengo and Dragonite that work well with it, Magmar has been used mainly on a specific balance composition consisting of Kingambit, Rillaboom, Sneasler, Primarina, and Dragapult to round out the Fire / Water / Grass core.</li> <li>Kingambit is a great partner for Magmar because it can set up safely with Swords Dance and exert significant offensive pressure. Plus, with priority Sucker Punch, Magmar realistically only needs to buy Kingambit one turn. Similarly, Gholdengo is another great partner for it, safely stacking Nasty Plot boosts and sweeping with Make It Rain. Additionally, Magmar can redirect potential Sucker Punch from an opposing Kingambit and burn it with Will-O-Wisp so Gholdengo doesn't outright lose to Kingambit.</li> <li>Rillaboom synergizes with Magmar by providing coverage for common Water-types like Primarina and Basculegion-M and Ground-types like Ursaluna-B that threaten Magmar. In return, Magmar redirects attacks that threaten Rillaboom, most importantly Dire Claw from Sneasler.</li> <li>Primarina works well with Magmar, as it will safely chip away at foes with Hyper Voice without worrying about Dire Claw, Wood Hammer, or Spore from Sneasler, Rillaboom, and Amoonguss. Magmar also pressures Steel-types like Gholdengo and Assault Vest Kingambit that Primarina has a hard time against.</li> <li>Sneasler puts pressure on many relevant Pokemon, including those that Magmar struggles against, like Archaludon and Primarina. Magmar supports Sneasler by helping it maintain its Focus Sash for longer and focus on its role as a glass cannon. Also acting as a glass cannon, Dragapult appreciates redirection, which allows it to safely spam Dragon Darts and deal large amounts of chip damage to both foes.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Magmar's playstyle is straightforward; it enables its teammates to secure KOs while it tanks the hits. For balance compositions, it's the defensive backbone of the team.</li> <li>Typically, Magmar is better as a lead to safely establish early-game offensive dominance with glass cannons like Sneasler and Dragapult or setup sweepers like Swords Dance Kingambit. Once Magmar has fainted and momentum has been established, you can bring in another offensive threat and clean up.</li> <li>One of the biggest flaws of Magmar is spread damage. While this largely can't be avoided, some of the common spread moves can be mitigated with the proper positioning. For example, Expanding Force in Psychic Terrain can be made single target by a well-timed Rillaboom swap, and Eruption from Hisuian Typhlosion can be tanked well by Primarina, which can dish back solid damage. Magmar also struggles against standard Archaludon rain teams. To deal with this, Sneasler, Rillaboom, and Kingambit are solid choices. Sneasler threatens Archaludon with its STAB attacks even if Archaludon Terastallizes, while Rillaboom can handle Basculegion-M effectively. Kingambit pressures everything with boosted Sucker Punch, especially Archaludon before it accumulates too many Stamina boosts.</li> </ul>",

Flame Body can punish certain physical attackers like Rillaboom, Sneasler, and Kingambit by redirecting their attacks and potentially burning them.</li> <li>Overheat is used for a large burst of damage, while Heat Wave is sometimes preferred for its consistency, providing spread chip damage without the Special Attack drop. Will-O-Wisp is useful for pressuring physical attackers like Sneasler and Dragonite as well as physical setup threats like Kingambit. Clear Smog can be useful for hindering certain setup Pokemon like Quiver Dance Volcarona.</li> <li>Tera Ghost, especially when Magmar's teammate can't use Protect, is particularly helpful for gaining a Fake Out immunity to allow it to click Follow Me.</li> <li>The Defense investment lets Magmar comfortably take a Stomping Tantrum from Life Orb Garchomp, withstand two hits from Tera Dragon Dragon Darts from Choice Band Dragapult, and nearly always survive Population Bomb from Maushold.

      "Focus Sash": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Ditto is uniquely able to punish teams using Restricted Pokemon that threaten opposing species of themselves, and it often serves as a third Restricted Pokemon. Common threats such as Calyrex-S, Zamazenta-C, Miraidon, and Lunala all use STAB moves that hit themselves for super effective damage, making Ditto extremely effective against them.</li> <li>Additionally, Ditto can copy the boosts that Calyrex-S and Zamazenta-C get from their respective abilities, deterring a full sweep or even setup in the case of Nasty Plot Calyrex-S. In particular, since Zamazenta-C gets a Defense boost from Dauntless Shield, Ditto copies that boost then activates its own Dauntless Shield, allowing it to hit Zamazenta-C harder.</li> <li>Ditto can have unique case-by-case applications when transforming into support Pokemon such as Incineroar and Amoonguss, but Ditto is often best used to copy the opponent's Restricted Pokemon.</li> <li>Focus Sash guarantees that Ditto survives an attack if it loses the Speed tie with whatever it has transformed into, ensuring that Ditto can operate around the mandatory Speed tie while maintaining the flexibility to use other moves the foe grants it, unlike Choice Scarf. Focus Sash also helps Ditto work around its low HP, transforming into frailer Pokemon, and has general defensive utility against the powerful attacks of Regulation I.</li> <li>Tera Ghost is generally useful to keep Ditto's Focus Sash intact against Fake Out and helps immensely against Zamazenta-C, allowing it to avoid Body Press altogether if Ditto copies it. Tera Ghost can also provide a boost to Astral Barrage if Ditto copies Calyrex-S.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Being mindful of which slots Ditto can come in on and switching accordingly is key, as Imposter will transform Ditto into the Pokemon directly across from it. Forcing Ditto to copy a disadvantageous, usually support-oriented, Pokemon is a great way for opponents to deal with the threat.</li> <li>Maintaining Focus Sash can be important to work around Ditto's low HP stat. Priority moves such as Fake Out, Thunderclap from Raging Bolt, and Sucker Punch from Chien-Pao are especially threatening for Ditto, since these moves will either threaten to break its Focus Sash or pick it off outright.</li> <li>Pokemon that resist their STAB moves, such as Landorus and Calyrex-I, can hamper Ditto's effectiveness when transforming into them. Rillaboom in particular can tank its own moves, set Grassy Terrain to hamper a potential Miraidon partner, and can threaten to break Ditto's Focus Sash with both Fake Out and Grassy Glide.</li> <li>Urshifu-R can cut through Focus Sash with Surging Strikes, depending somewhat on what Ditto transformed into, and can pick off a weakened Ditto with Aqua Jet. Choice Scarf Urshifu-R is also an excellent check to Ditto as Calyrex-S, which could otherwise sweep entire teams with stolen boosts.</li> <li>Galarian Weezing turns off Imposter completely, which effectively forces Ditto out of the match. Toxic Spikes and Poison Gas can also easily break its Focus Sash and bring it into KO range, especially if it is forced to remain as Ditto.</li> <li>Ditto cannot transform into Terastallized Terapagos and Ogerpon-H. This uniquely helps Terapagos and Ogerpon-H leverage their boosts against Ditto teams that would otherwise try to turn them against themselves.</li> <li>Thunder Wave Grimmsnarl is a standout speed control Pokemon that can help Ditto avoid Speed ties, which are important in the cases of Calyrex-S and Zamazenta-C. It can also apply Reflect and Light Screen to help transformed Ditto survive attacks from Restricted Pokemon, which is especially helpful given its low HP.</li> <li>Incineroar and Miraidon can help pivot Ditto into advantageous transformations with U-turn or Parting Shot and Volt Switch, respectively.</li> <li>Calyrex-I particularly has a hard time against Calyrex-S and Zamazenta-C, especially if they are paired together, so it appreciates Ditto being able to check one or both of them. Calyrex-I also threatens Rillaboom and Landorus, which Ditto struggles against.</li> </ul>"

  "Dragonite": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Dragonite is a very common bulky physical attacker on balance and physically offensive Coaching teams. Dragonite shines particularly well against weakened teams. It also appreciates redirection or speed control to make up for its mediocre Speed. It works well at supporting teams against hyper offensive teams, with its Multiscale sets allowing it to survive attacks from many common wallbreakers, including Garchomp and Kingambit. Dragonite works well on balance teams, which value more the great consistency and versatility in matchups and the support it can provide to the team through Haze and Tailwind.</li> <li>Dragonite works very well in tandem with Gholdengo and Kingambit, which can cover the Fairy- and Ice-types that may threaten Dragonite. Dragonite also appreciates Coaching support from partners such as Sneasler, which can allow it to mitigate Defense drops from Scale Shot and become difficult to remove for many teams with just a few Coaching boosts. Additionally, redirection from Amoonguss and Fake Out from Rillaboom and Incineroar allow it to better fulfill both its offensive and supportive roles on a team.</li> <li>Dragonite's main issues are its relatively low Speed, weakness to Intimidate, and inability to hit Fairy- and Steel-types except with relatively weak coverage options. Therefore, partners like Kingambit and Sneasler can help hit Dragonite's checks heavily. Additionally, Coaching can help shore up its lesser damage output, particularly against Intimidate from Incineroar, and Defiant from the aforementioned Kingambit as well as Annihilape can help punish Intimidate cycling. Another issue for Dragonite are Pokemon that are faster than it and can threaten to OHKO it, such as Dragapult, Alolan Ninetales, and Garchomp. Therefore, redirection is of great use to these Dragonite sets to deal with such threats.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Dragonite's main role on teams is as a bulky attacker that can also provide support for its team through Haze and Tailwind. It uses its power and priority to clean up weakened teams while maintaining usefulness throughout the game.</li> <li>Dragonite is best used for its heavy damage output and large bulk, so it must be positioned it carefully around potential threats. Dragonite is at its best when Multiscale is kept intact, so keeping it away from weak attacks that may break it is crucial, as having Multiscale can allow Dragonite to tank a powerful hit from a threatening Pokemon and KO back. It can be used as a strong lead into offensive strategies or as a late-game cleaner against more balanced teams. It can also provide important support for its team if it is running Tailwind.</li> <li>Dragonite's biggest issues are against Steel-types that are capable of withstanding its coverage options, such as Gholdengo and Corviknight, and strong Fairy- and Ice-types like Alolan Ninetales. To mitigate these threats, position your other Pokemon that can handle them and hit them with heavy damage early in the game with partners such as Sneasler and Incineroar so Dragonite can pick them off later in the game once correctly positioned. Another way around these threats is with redirection to protect Dragonite or Coaching support so it can overpower its checks.</li> </ul>",

Additionally, Haze can be used to counter setup sweepers like Dondozo. Ice Spinner provides coverage for Dragon-types with a 4x weakness to Ice such as Garchomp and can be used to clear Terrains, namely Psychic Terrain, from the field, whereas Stomping Tantrum gives it coverage for Steel- and Fire-types such as Kingambit and Incineroar.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tera Fairy gives Dragonite an important immunity to Dragon-type moves, particularly Scale Shot from opposing Dragonite, giving it strong defensive utility and the ability to check powerful Dragons like Garchomp while removing Dragonite's Fairy and Ice weaknesses.

However, this Tera type can leave it vulnerable to other important attacks, including Dire Claw from Sneasler and Make It Rain from Gholdengo.

Redirection from Indeedee-F and Electabuzz helps Hisuian Typhlosion attack without having the Base Power of Eruption lowered, though it doesn't help against spread moves. Choice Specs is almost always paired with Prankster Tailwind support, mainly from Whimsicott, that allows Hisuian Typhlosion to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame.

Jumpluff can additionally use Pollen Puff to heal Torkoal to fire off a more powerful Eruption.</li> <li>Ursaluna is another ally that can consistently damage foes with spread moves, this time with Earthquake, which is able to be used freely next to Jumpluff thanks to its Ground immunity. In return, Jumpluff can put foes to sleep, namely Sneasler, before they can move so Ursaluna is free to attack. Jumpluff can also redirect attacks or disrupt foes with Encore to ensure that Ursaluna's Flame Orb activates safely. Jumpluff, when used with faster Ursaluna sets, can use Tailwind to allow Ursaluna to outspeed a significant portion of the unboosted metagame.</li> <li>Jumpluff is very supportive and cannot do any meaningful damage on its own. It is particularly useless in front of Gholdengo or Pokemon with Safety Goggles such as Incineroar, as they can ignore Jumpluff entirely or KO it with Make It Rain and Flare Blitz, respectively. Allies such as Charizard and Hisuian Typhlosion are able to break through many of these Pokemon with their devastating attacks. Jumpluff also has a pretty poor defensive typing, being weak to top Pokemon such as Alolan Ninetales and Sneasler. Allies such as Incineroar can help out by threatening them with Flare Blitz or mitigating their damage with Intimidate, respectively. Jumpluff can also outspeed them with Drought support from Torkoal, putting them to sleep with Sleep Powder before they can threaten Jumpluff.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Jumpluff's main objective is to be a nuisance under then sun, putting foes to sleep, changing the Speed order with Tailwind, and resetting sun if necessary. Jumpluff loves to be in scenarios where it can spam Sleep Powder easily without worry. To help it achieve this, roadblocks such as powder-immune Pokemon like Safety Goggles Clefable and Rillaboom and sleep-immune Pokemon like Magmar and Electabuzz should be removed early on.</li> <li>Jumpluff tends to prefer being brought in the front, getting off early Sleep Powders that could easily sway the battle in Jumpluff's favor. Jumpluff can be brought in many matchups, but certainly not Trick Room; because of its relatively poor bulk and lack of Protect, it won't be able to survive.</li> <li>Jumpluff accentuates its potential in matchups against opposing weather teams, namely rain teams, as it can shut down their weather with Sunny Day before they can move. Additionally, Jumpluff can lock common rain Pokemon like Pelipper and Ursaluna into Protect with Encore, or it can redirect powerful Water-type attacks like Wave Crash from Basculegion away, protecting allies like Incineroar and Charizard.</li> <li>Shutting down the sun with Pokemon such as Pelipper and Alolan Ninetales will sever Jumpluff's Speed boost, leaving it vulnerable to Pokemon such as Sneasler. Removing weather setters early-game and preserving Jumpluff's allies such as Torkoal will ensure that Jumpluff's preferred weather will be up. Jumpluff is also susceptible to Taunt from the likes of Whimsicott and Annihilape, considering most of its options are status moves.

  "Porygon2": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Thanks to its offensive and defensive tools, Porygon2 fits well on balance teams with a Trick Room mode. It benefits from teammates that provide utility, such as Fake Out or redirection, enabling it to set up Trick Room and go on the offensive, as well as teammates that can take advantage of Trick Room.</li> <li>Porygon2 is most commonly paired with Incineroar, which offers Fake Out support to allow Porygon2 to set up Trick Room. It also provides Intimidate and Parting Shot utility, enhancing Porygon2’s survivability. Parting Shot is especially valuable, as it allows Incineroar to pivot to a Trick Room sweeper while Porygon2 sets up Trick Room. Additionally, Incineroar’s access to Flare Blitz and Knock Off helps to threaten Pokemon like Gholdengo, which would otherwise wall Porygon2.</li> <li>The preferred Trick Room sweeper for Porygon2 teams is Ursaluna, as it takes full advantage of Trick Room by securing OHKOs on many Pokemon with its Guts boost. This pairing also works well because Porygon2 threatens special damage, while Ursaluna dishes out massive physical damage. Garchomp is another excellent offensive partner for Porygon2 because Garchomp provides a faster-paced, non-Trick Room-dependent offensive option for Porygon2 but with a less explosive damage output than Ursaluna.</li> <li>Amoonguss is a common support partner for Porygon2, taking full advantage of Trick Room with its low Speed and putting foes to sleep with Spore to allow Porygon2 to attack unthreatened. It also provides Rage Powder redirection, enabling Porygon2 to set up Trick Room freely, and Pollen Puff to heal Porygon2, reducing the need for it to constantly use Recover.</li> <li>Gholdengo is a common offensive partner for Porygon2, as it walls Pokemon like non-Throat Chop Sneasler, which can threaten massive damage to Porygon2, and Amoonguss, which can disrupt Porygon2 by putting it to sleep with Spore before it sets up Trick Room or deals much damage. Additionally, the threat of Nasty Plot boosts forces opponents to focus on Gholdengo, potentially allowing Porygon2 to move freely.</li> <li>Flamigo and Sneasler are used on Porygon2 teams, as they threaten Incineroar, which can hinder Porygon2 with Knock Off and Parting Shot, as well as threats like Archaludon, Kingambit, and, in Flamigo's case, Gholdengo with Close Combat. Sneasler has the added benefit of threatening status with Dire Claw and Poison Touch, while Flamigo has Wide Guard utility to protect Porygon2 from moves like Eruption from Hisuian Typhlosion and Make It Rain from Gholdengo.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>As a defensive unit with offensive potential, Porygon2 excels when it is minimally threatened by high-damage moves, such as Close Combat from Sneasler and Choice Specs Tera Fire Eruption from Hisuian Typhlosion. This necessitates pivoting and relying on its teammates to handle major damage dealers, enabling Porygon2 to safely set up Trick Room, heal itself as needed, and retaliate with substantial damage.</li> <li>The optimal strategy for using Porygon2 involves pivoting between Pokemon like Incineroar and Amoonguss until Porygon2 and its partner sweepers like Ursaluna achieve a strong offensive position. This includes cycling Intimidate and Parting Shot with Incineroar to stack stat drops while using Amoonguss's Spore to stop opposing threats. By doing so, you create a window for Porygon2 and its offensive partners to safely attack and capitalize on the advantageous board state.</li> <li>Due to Porygon2's relatively unoppressive presence, it's susceptible to being outpaced offensively, which is largely unavoidable. However, the best way to deal with this is by pivoting between teammates like Incineroar and Amoonguss to cycle Intimidate, use Spore, or provide redirection until Porygon2 and its offensive partner are in a favorable position. As mentioned earlier, Incineroar's Knock Off and Parting Shot significantly impair Porygon2's offensive and defensive capabilities, which is why Pokemon like Garchomp and Flamigo are employed to take down Incineroar. Additionally, cycling Fake Out from Incineroar and Rillaboom can be particularly threatening for Porygon2, as it may allow an opposing Pokemon to set up or chip away at Porygon2, potentially causing it to faint before it can use Recover. This is why Pokemon like Flamigo and Sneasler are often included, as they can threaten common Fake Out users as well as setup threats like Kingambit and Gholdengo.</li> </ul>",

With Eviolite, Porygon2 becomes one of the bulkiest Pokemon in the format, and its access to Recover allows it to heal and remain difficult to remove. Additionally, the Download boost helps it gain more offensive pressure.</li> <li>Tera Blast is essential to Porygon2's set, as it provides the necessary coverage to make Porygon2 offensively threatening once it's Terastallized. Ice Beam is also crucial, offering good coverage against Pokemon like Garchomp and Dragonite.</li> <li>Tera Fighting is used for Fighting-type Tera Blast, enabling Porygon2 to deal significant damage to Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon such as Kingambit, Archaludon, and Incineroar. Tera Blast Ground also targets Steel-types but has the niche of threatening Pokemon like Electabuzz, Magmar, and Gholdengo. Tera Flying serves a slightly different purpose; while Flying-type Tera Blast is effective against threats like Rillaboom and Annihilape, it is primarily used for its resistance to Fighting-type moves and immunity to Ground-type attacks. This allows Porygon2's common partner, Ursaluna, to freely use Earthquake without worrying about hitting Porygon2.</li> <li>With the provided Defense and HP investment, Porygon2 can almost always survive two Kowtow Cleaves from Black Glasses Tera Dark Kingambit, a Wave Crash from Tera Water Choice Band Basculegion-M in rain, and two Wood Hammers from most Assault Vest Rillaboom. The Special Defense investment allows it to live three Hyper Voices from Life Orb Primarina as well as a Make It Rain from Leftovers Gholdengo after two Nasty Plot boosts. The Special Attack investment ensures that Porygon2 can KO Garchomp with Ice Beam or with a Download-boosted Tera Blast Fighting or Ground if Garchomp has Terastallized into a Steel-type. With the Download boost, it also guarantees an OHKO on most Assault Vest Kingambit with Tera Blast Fighting and a 2HKO on non-Sitrus Berry Amoonguss with Ice Beam.</li> </ul>"

It is the fastest Spore user in the format, and it can shut down foes such as Calyrex-I and Raging Bolt before they can move. Its Moody ability can punish the opponent for not KOing it quickly enough, and a possible Speed boost will allow it to outspeed and incapacitate Calyrex-S and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R with Spore. Trick Room sets use Technician or Own Tempo on Smeargle to prevent a Moody Speed boost from altering the turn order in Trick Room.</li> <li>Follow Me protects teammates susceptible to OHKOs such as Calyrex-S, redirecting Moongeist Beam from Lunala and Shadow Ball from Flutter Mane. Fake Out can stop a foe for a turn, which can allow for a Restricted partner such as Calyrex-S with Nasty Plot or Calyrex-I with Trick Room to set up. Decorate increases the offenses of Smeargle's partners, punishing passive play from the opposing side such as using Protect to stall Fake Out. Wide Guard blocks powerful spread moves in the format like Astral Barrage from Calyrex-S and Glacial Lance from Calyrex-I.</li> <li>Focus Sash ensures survival against most moves and can force the opponent to double target Smeargle.</li> <li>Maximum Speed with a Jolly nature can be used to ensure Decorate occurs before Calyrex-I's and Terapagos's moves outside of Trick Room, or Smeargle can run minimum Speed with a Relaxed nature while Calyrex-I is one Speed point faster than it in order for Decorate to go first in Trick Room.</li> <li>Tera Grass can be used to ensure Tera Water Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R will never OHKO Smeargle, and it lets Smeargle be immune to Spore and Rage Powder. Tera Ghost provides an immunity to Fake Out and Fighting- and Normal-type attacks such as Body Press from Zamazenta-C, Close Combat from the Urshifu formes, and Facade from Ursaluna.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Urshifu-R threatens an OHKO onto Smeargle through Focus Sash with Surging Strikes. Taunt from Pokemon such as Tornadus and Chien-Pao shuts down Smeargle's support options. Spore-immune redirectors like Amoonguss, the Ogerpon formes, and Safety Goggles Indeedee-F can save their partners from being put to sleep and also stop Decorate from boosting Smeargle's partner.</li> <li>Smeargle can be partnered with Rillaboom in order to remove Psychic Terrain from Indeedee-F to use Fake Out, which helps Nasty Plot Calyrex-S set up. Rillaboom also threatens an OHKO against Urshifu-R with its Grass-type STAB moves.</li> <li>Smeargle can use Fake Out on Choice Scarf Urshifu-R, which threatens Calyrex-S with an OHKO, so Calyrex-S can instead OHKO it; it can also support Calyrex-S with Follow Me if Fake Out is not available. Calyrex-S enjoys Wide Guard blocking spread moves it is weak to such as Astral Barrage from opposing Calyrex-S and Snarl from Chi-Yu.</li> <li>Decorate can target bulky slower Restricted Pokemon such as Calyrex-I and Terapagos to quickly boost their offenses to high levels before they attack. Terapagos can also Terastallize to remove Miraidon's Electric Terrain from the field in order for Smeargle to put foes to sleep with Spore.</li> </ul>"

    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Tyranitar excels at complementing powerhouses like Gholdengo by checking its threats such as Kingambit, Incineroar, and Hisuian Typhlosion, as well as disrupting weather-reliant Pokemon like Pelipper and Archaludon. Tyranitar appreciates redirection support like Amoonguss and Magmar to handle Fighting-type attacks like Close Combat from Sneasler and works well with Trick Room balance composition due to its mediocre Speed tier.</li> <li>Tyranitar and Gholdengo complement each other, with Gholdengo checking threats such as Rillaboom, Amoonguss, and Archaludon in sand while appreciating Tyranitar's coverage options that handle Fire-types such as Volcarona, Talonflame, and Incineroar that Gholdengo is weak to. Amoonguss is an exceptional support option, redirecting Fighting-type attacks like Close Combat and Drain Punch from Sneasler and Annihilape, respectively. Due to its average Speed tier, Tyranitar excels in both Tailwind and Trick Room. Trick Room setters such as Porygon2 and Sinistcha allow Amoonguss and Tyranitar to take advantage of their lower Speed stat to move before their foes. Meanwhile, Talonflame provides Tailwind to help Tyranitar and its faster partners like Gholdengo move first. Rillaboom checks troublesome Water-types like Basculegion and Primarina while weakening Garchomp's Earthquake and offering passive recovery thanks to its Grassy Terrain.</li> <li>Tyranitar is especially susceptible to Garchomp and Archaludon, lacking the means to outdamage them while being weak to their coverage options like the latter's Body Press. Tera Steel Gholdengo threatens to 2HKO Tyranitar with Make it Rain, while faster physical attackers like Basculegion and Rillaboom check it. Redirectors like Amoonguss help to an extent, while speed control in the form of Trick Room can help turn the tide of the battle. Offensive partners like Garchomp check Archaludon and Gholdengo with Stomping Tantrum and Earthquake, while Primarina threatens Garchomp with Moonblast.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>As a weather setter and special tank, Tyranitar excels at threatening checks to powerhouses like Gholdengo and Garchomp, weakening opposing weather teams such as rain and sun, as well as checking hard Trick Room teams utilizing Armarouge, Torkoal, and Indeedee-F. Tyranitar also immediately threatens offensive Pokemon such as Choice Specs Hisuian Typhlosion or Talonflame and can fill the role of a strong defensive backbone of the team.</li> <li>Tyranitar is a strong lead into offensive strategies, ideally to get rid of Talonflame or Hisuian Typhlosion to help its partners like Gholdengo for late-game dominance. Against rain teams, a well-timed switch-in can force Archaludon to waste a turn charging its Electro Shot while threatening Pelipper with Rock Slide. Additionally, setting up sand early can be useful in breaking Focus Sash on common metagame threats such as Sneasler. Tyranitar's efficiency increases with the help of speed control like Trick Room, often provided by Porygon2, where it is safe to move first and secure KOs.</li> <li>Gholdengo, Annihilape, Archaludon, and Garchomp threaten to either OHKO or deal a massive amount of damage to Tyranitar with their STAB moves. It is advisable to keep Tyranitar in the back until the threat is removed or disrupted, either via support options like Amoonguss and Incineroar or by utilizing offensive Pokemon like Volcarona, Gholdengo, and Garchomp.</li> </ul>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Ho-Oh's amazing bulk, great ability, and solid defensive typing let it stand in the way of many offensive threats in the format and support its team with Tailwind. It's far from passive, though; it has great Attack and two excellent STAB moves, meaning that it often wins damage trades against frailer offensive Pokemon.</li> <li>Sacred Fire's burn chance is a massive boon for Ho-Oh, threatening to cripple bulky physical attackers like Calyrex-I and Zamazenta-C unless they Terastallize into a Fire-type.</li> <li>Clear Amulet allows Ho-Oh to ignore Incineroar's Intimidate and Parting Shot, which would otherwise reduce its damage, and Icy Wind, which would reduce the benefit Ho-Oh receives from its own Tailwind. Leftovers can be used if Ho-Oh wants to prioritize remaining healthy to dish out damage over time and pairs especially well with Regenerator and Protect.</li> <li>76 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature allow Ho-Oh to OHKO maximum HP Rillaboom and uninvested Koraidon with Brave Bird; it also allows Helping Hand-boosted Brave Bird to OHKO uninvested Calyrex-S. 68 Speed EVs allow Ho-Oh to get the jump on Ogerpon-C after the latter's Speed has been reduced by Icy Wind. Investing in Defense improves Ho-Oh's otherwise mediocre physical bulk; it is greatly favored to not be 2HKOed by Calyrex-I's Glacial Lance and +3 Zamazenta-C's Body Press. Its solid natural special bulk ensures that it never is 2HKOed by Life Orb Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage or Psychic.</li> <li>Tera Grass lets Ho-Oh resist the Water- and Electric-type attacks like Surging Strikes and Electro Drift that would otherwise threaten it. It also removes Ho-Oh's weakness to Rock, letting it take an attack like Ogerpon-C's Ivy Cudgel in a pinch.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Water-types like Kyogre and Urshifu-R threaten Ho-Oh greatly. Kyogre weakens Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire by setting rain, while Urshifu-R bypasses Protect, reducing Ho-Oh's ability to play around it. Electric-types like Miraidon, Raging Bolt, and Iron Hands are also problematic for Ho-Oh; the first two have the extra benefit of resisting Ho-Oh's STAB combination. Similarly, Rock-type attacks like Ogerpon-C's Ivy Cudgel and Lunala's Meteor Beam are immensely threatening to Ho-Oh. Ho-Oh also lacks initial damage output, so it can struggle to break opposing bulky threats like Terapagos and Lunala.</li> <li>Ho-Oh benefits damage dealers that want a bulky ally they can fall back on while also providing utility in Tailwind. Its best Restricted Pokemon partner is Choice Specs Miraidon, as it threatens opposing Water-types while using its insane power to blast through the bulky threats that Ho-Oh struggles to handle. The sun set by Koraidon and Groudon also helps with Water-types while boosting the damage of Sacred Fire; the former resists Water and can get through Terapagos, the latter is better against Electric-types, and both resist Rock. However, it easily supports other offensive Restricted Pokemon like Calyrex-S thanks to its great bulk and Tailwind.</li> <li>While Ho-Oh has great bulk, it still wants help against Calyrex-I and setup variants of Calyex-S. Foul Play Farigiraf is a good check to both. It also offers additional speed control in Trick Room and supports Ho-Oh with Helping Hand. Electric- and Grass-types are also great help for Ho-Oh to deal with opposing Water- and Electric-types. Some examples are Iron Hands, Raging Bolt, and Rillaboom.</li> </ul>"

    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Pelipper excels in teams capable of taking advantage of Drizzle while also having sufficient defensive options to switch around to regain control of the weather late-game.</li> <li>Archaludon, with its signature move Electro Shot, works exceptionally well in rain, and it provides a defensive backbone to the team thanks to its immense bulk and ability, capable of switching into threats such as Tyranitar's Rock Slide and Maushold's Population Bomb. It quickly becomes an offensive threat once it starts stacking up Electro Shot boosts in rain.</li> <li>Basculegion-M's ability Swift Swim makes it desirable on rain teams both as an early-game powerhouse with its fast rain-boosted Wave Crash and as a late-game sweeper with Last Respects. Its immense Speed and power help it form a well-rounded balanced core with Archaludon and Pelipper, taking on threats such as Garchomp and Gholdengo, while Pelipper threatens the Grass-types that resists Wave Crash like Amoonguss and Rillaboom with Hurricane.</li> <li>Pelipper struggles against opposing weather setters like Tyranitar, which not only tanks Pelipper's STAB moves in sand but also breaks its Focus Sash with sand chip damage and KOs it with Rock Slide. Archaludon takes advantage of Pelipper's rain to fire off Electro Shots as well as completely walling Pelipper's STAB attacks. Amoonguss is an excellent disruptive option, taking advantage of its bulk to survive attacks like Knock Off from Tyranitar and Draco Meteor from Archaludon and put the aforementioned threats to sleep with Spore. Basculegion-M is a great check against Tyranitar as well, outspeeding and OHKOing it with Wave Crash.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>As a rain setter, Pelipper is often used to enable Archaludon snowball with Electro Shots while handling threats like Amoonguss with Hurricane. Speed control with Tailwind is desirable due to Archaludon's slow Speed, and it helps tremendously against balance archetypes.</li> <li>Pelipper is often lead with Basculegion-M or Archaludon to immediately take advantage of rain, provided the opposing team lacks a method to change the weather. A more flexible approach would be to lead the weather-reliant Pokemon like Archaludon and prepare Pelipper as a switch-in to swiftly take control of the game with a well-timed weather change. It is pivotal to keep Pelipper intact for late-game weather control, as lack of such could potentially end up severely weakening the board and result in a loss of momentum.</li> <li>Rivaling weather setters like Tyranitar and Alolan Ninetales threaten Pelipper's rain. It's advisable to preserve Pelipper and switch it in to thwart Aurora Veil setups from Alolan Ninetales, while Archaludon or Basculegion-M should take out Tyranitar first. Opposing Archaludon can end up being a powerful threat due to being capable of walling Pelipper while taking advantage of its rain. The ideal option here would be to use Amoonguss to force it to Terastallize into a Grass-type, and then have Pelipper deal a massive amount of damage to it with Hurricane.</li> </ul>",

Torkoal additionally functions well as a powerful sweeper when its partners set up Trick Room.</li> <li>When used as a supportive sun setter, Torkoal is often paired with Jumpluff, which takes advantage of the sun via Chlorophyll, allowing it to set Tailwind or put foes to sleep with Sleep Powder before they can move. Torkoal boosts the power of its partners' Fire-type attacks like Heat Wave and Eruption with the sun, making it a great pairing alongside Charizard and Hisuian Typhlosion. Charizard gains an additional damage boost from the sun thanks to Solar Power.</li> <li>Offensive Torkoal pairs well with reliable bulky Trick Room setters like Hatterene and Indeedee-F. Hatterene is capable of providing additional special offense with its powerful Dazzling Gleam as well as Expanding Force when paired with Indeedee-F. Indeedee-F on the other hand provides redirection and can boost Torkoal's damage with Helping Hand as well as using Heal Pulse to provide healing, mitigating the damage reduction of Eruption and increasing Torkoal's longevity. Indeedee-F's Psychic Terrain protects Torkoal from priority attacks, ensuring Torkoal can deal maximum damage with Eruption. Other offensive Trick Room-reliant partners like Ursaluna and Gallade pair well with Torkoal by threatening devastating physical damage. Ursaluna threatens specially defensive foes like Tyranitar. Meanwhile, Gallade deals with bulky foes Torkoal struggles to damage like Incineroar and Annihilape. Gallade additionally protects Torkoal from threatening spread attacks like Earthquake with Wide Guard.</li> <li>Supportive Torkoal can be very passive with Overheat as its primary offensive attack. It is very reliant on enabling its partners to take the KOs it can't achieve alone. Offensive Torkoal struggles to sufficiently damage Water-types like Primarina, so it relies on partners like Hatterene and Ursaluna to defeat them. Torkoal is easily threatened by powerful sweepers that move before Torkoal and threaten super effective damage like Garchomp and Tyranitar. Hatterene can set up Trick Room to ensure they do not attack before Torkoal moves and threatens both of them with its Fairy-type attacks.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Supportive Torkoal is best positioned when it can easily enable sun and provide support for its partners. Offensive Torkoal, on the other hand, is best used to sweep once Trick Room is active.</li> <li>As a supportive sun setter, Torkoal should be lead to set sun immediately for its partners. When it is lead, this set can potentially switch out immediately after Intimidate from Incineroar is triggered, allowing an offensive partner like Hisuian Typhlosion to switch in safely before you and the opponent can select their attacks for the turn. When using an offensive set, Torkoal is best kept in the back and should only be switched in while Trick Room is active.</li> <li>Foes capable of KOing Torkoal and its Trick Room-setting partners before Trick Room is set up are huge threats. To mitigate this, Indeedee-F can redirect attacks to protect Torkoal or the Trick Room setter from damage. Rain setters like Pelipper override the sun set by Torkoal, weakening and disrupting its partners; to prevent this, the rain setters should be KOed as soon as possible.</li> </ul>",

It matches up well into most Pokemon slower than it, especially those that don't resist its Water-type attacks.</li> <li>Water Spout is Kyogre's strongest attack, OHKOing or 2HKOing almost every Pokemon. Hydro Pump and Origin Pulse serve as secondary Water-type attacks that functions when Kyogre has taken enough damage to make them stronger than Water Spout. However, they are inaccurate, so Kyogre prefers to use Water Spout until it is too weak to deal meaningful damage. Hydro Pump is better into Wide Guard users such as Zamazenta-C and Lunala, while Origin Pulse is a spread move. Thunder allows Kyogre to threaten the Water-type Pokemon that resist its Water-type attacks such as Kyogre and Urshifu-R, while Ice Beam lets Kyogre threaten the Dragon- and Grass-type Pokemon that do the same such as Miraidon and Rillaboom.</li> <li>Mystic Water boosts Kyogre's Water-type attacks even further, letting it OHKO most Calyrex-S sets.</li> <li>The Speed investment allows Kyogre to outspeed base 135 Speed Pokemon after an Icy Wind. The HP investment allows Kyogre to live a Thunderbolt from bulky Magnet Raging Bolt, and the rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Attack.</li> <li>Tera Grass is used to give Kyogre a resistance to the Grass- and Electric-type attacks that threaten it. This is especially helpful to prevent priority attacks such as Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and Raging Bolt's Thunderclap from weakening Kyogre's Water Spout too much. Tera Grass also lets Kyogre ignore Rage Powder and Spore from Amoonguss, letting it potentially get an attack off into Amoonguss's partner.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Because Kyogre runs at least two Water-type moves, it often has to choose which Pokemon it will be checked by. Rillaboom and Raging Bolt are problems if Kyogre runs Thunder, opposing Kyogre can be an issue if it runs Ice Beam, and all three are problematic if it runs Origin Pulse. Koraidon and Miraidon are also problematic, as they resist Kyogre's Water-type attacks; Koraidon also changes the weather, weaking Kyogre's attacks.</li> <li>Calyrex-I pairs well with Kyogre, as it threatens Rillaboom, Raging Bolt, Koraidon, and Miraidon for super effective damage. It can also set Trick Room against faster teams, letting Kyogre use Water Spout without having to worry about taking damage. Zacian-C and Zamazenta-C are both good partners as well because of their good damage output, letting Kyogre clean up weakened foes or letting them clean up after Kyogre has weakened them with Water Spout. Zacian-C is especially good into Miraidon and Raging Bolt, while Zamazenta-C is better at spreading damage.</li> <li>Amoonguss can heal Kyogre with Pollen Puff, letting it spam Water Spout against slower foes. It can also redirect attacks away from Kyogre, keeping it safe and letting it use Water Spout without worrying about faster foes. Tailwind setters like Roaring Moon, Tornadus, and Iron Jugulis help Kyogre against faster foes if they do not also have a Tailwind setter. Tornadus and Iron Jugulis can also threaten Grass-type Pokemon and Koraidon, while Roaring Moon can use Knock Off to remove Assault Vest from Iron Hands and Rillaboom.</li> </ul>"

Crunch is used on Assault Vest sets to threaten Calyrex-S and Lunala for super effective damage.</li> <li>Clear Amulet blocks Intimidate from Incineroar, letting Groudon fire off attacks without having to worry about its damage being reduced. Assault Vest boosts Groudon's Special Defense, allowing it to survive Draco Meteor from Choice Specs Miraidon.</li> <li>The HP and Special Defense investment allow Groudon to survive Draco Meteor from Choice Specs Miraidon outside of Electric Terrain if it isn't running an Assault Vest or, if it is running an Assault Vest, survive Draco Meteor if Electric Terrain is active. The Speed investment lets Groudon outspeed Choice Scarf Urshifu if Tailwind is active. The Attack investment ensures that Groudon will OHKO bulkless Miraidon with Precipice Blades almost all of the time.</li> <li>Tera Fire lets Groudon resist the Ice- and Grass-type attacks that threaten it before it Terastallizes such as Glacial Lance from Calyrex-I and Wood Hammer from Rillaboom. Tera Fire also boosts Heat Crash's damage, letting Groudon OHKO Calyrex-S with it.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Groudon struggles into Kyogre because it can override Groudon's sun and threaten to OHKO it with Water Spout and Hydro Pump or deal a large amount of damage with Origin Pulse. Groudon also struggles into physically defensive foes that it cannot hit for super effective damage, such as Terastallized Calyrex-I and Lunala, as Groudon cannot do enough damage to them before being KOed.</li> <li>Groudon pairs well with Pokemon with Protosynthesis like Raging Bolt and Flutter Mane, as it allows them to run items other than Booster Energy. Raging Bolt threatens Kyogre, while Groudon threatens the Steel-, Poison-, and Fire-types that resist Flutter Mane's Fairy-type attacks.</li> <li>Grimmsnarl's dual screens boost Groudon's bulk even further. Incineroar and Volcarona both benefit from Groudon's sun boosting their Fire-type attacks and weakening Water-type attacks from Urshifu-R. They also threaten Calyrex-I, helping Groudon break through it.</li> <li>Restricted Pokemon that can threaten large amounts of damage, such as Miraidon and Calyrex-I, are good partners for Groudon, as their additional damage helps into bulkier foes. Miraidon also threatens to OHKO Kyogre and can do good damage to Lunala and Calyrex-I.</li> </ul>"

  "Garchomp": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Garchomp fits well onto a variety of teams. It isn't capable of surviving multiple strong attacks, so it relies on partners that allow it to attack without receiving a lot of damage in return. Priority Tailwind setters like Talonflame and Whimsicott are great partners, and they both provide additional Taunt support to disrupt Trick Room setters like Porygon2. Fake Out users like Incineroar disrupt foes for Garchomp. Incineroar additionally provides damage reduction via Intimidate and Parting Shot. Garchomp also works well on balance teams featuring Porygon2, as Garchomp threatens Gholdengo and Incineroar, both of which Porygon2 and its common partners struggle to damage. Garchomp additionally performs well on beatdown teams featuring Dragonite, as Garchomp can freely attack with Earthquake without damaging it.</li> <li>Amoonguss and Vivillon provide redirection and sleep support; Amoonguss is bulkier and has a more consistent way of putting foes to sleep, while Vivillon is faster and is immune to Garchomp's Earthquake. Garchomp pairs well with Porygon2; Porygon2 setting Trick Room can allow Garchomp to attack before threats like Dragapult. Porygon2 additionally deals significant damage to Grass- and Flying-types with Ice Beam and can comfortably survive Earthquake while regaining the lost HP with Recover. Dragonite also synergizes well with Garchomp. Dragonite can deal strong damage with Extreme Speed, allowing Garchomp to secure KOs with Earthquake and removes Grass-types like Rillaboom, which Garchomp struggles to KO, with Tera Blast Flying.</li> <li>Garchomp is threatened by Dragon-, Fairy-, and Ice-type attacks like Dragon Darts and Outrage from Dragapult, Moonblast from Clefable, and Blizzard from Alolan Ninetales. All of these attacks can be switched into by Steel-type partners such as Gholdengo and Kingambit. Garchomp also struggles to damage Flying-types like Pelipper, especially when it isn't using Rock Slide, so a partner like Alolan Ninetales easily threatens Flying-types with Blizzard and Freeze-Dry.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>As a glass cannon, Garchomp's task is to deal as much damage as possible uninterrupted. Garchomp performs best when it outspeeds its foes and when it is supported by redirection, allowing Garchomp to attack freely.</li> <li>Garchomp excels at being an early-game sweeper as well as a late-game cleaner. Garchomp primarily attacks using Earthquake to damage both foes. It uses Stomping Tantrum when Garchomp's partner is vulnerable to the damage from Earthquake or when Grassy Terrain is active. Dragon Claw and Rock Slide are used to damage foes that resist Earthquake and Stomping Tantrum.</li> <li>Dragapult outspeeds and threatens Garchomp. To beat Dragapult, Garchomp needs Tailwind or Trick Room support, allowing it to threaten Dragapult with Dragon Claw before it attacks. A partner Kingambit can also survive an attack from Dragapult and threaten it in return with Kowtow Cleave or before Dragapult attacks with Sucker Punch. Rillaboom is also troublesome for Garchomp, as Grassy Terrain weakens the damage of Earthquake. Garchomp is very reliant on partners like Talonflame and Dragonite to remove Rillaboom, as it struggles to deal threatening spread damage when Grassy Terrain is active.</li> </ul>",

Earthquake, however, is used most effectively when Garchomp's partner is able to use Protect or is immune to Ground-type attacks. Rock Slide is most commonly used by Choice Band Garchomp to threaten Flying-types like Talonflame and Pelipper. It is used as an alternative spread damage attack that doesn't affect Garchomp's partner and is unhindered by Grassy Terrain set by a partner Rillaboom.</li> <li>Life Orb boosts Garchomp's damage, allowing it to threaten an OHKO onto +1 Defense Sneasler with Stomping Tantrum or Earthquake and Dragonite with Dragon Claw. Clear Amulet is used to block Intimidate and Parting Shot from Incineroar. Choice Band provides a greater damage increase than Life Orb, allowing it to threaten an OHKO onto Gholdengo with Stomping Tantrum or Earthquake at the cost of being unable to switch between attacks. The item choice greatly affects Garchomp. Life Orb and Choice Band sets are subject to having its Attack dropped by Incineroar cycling Intimidate and Parting Shot, while the damage from Clear Amulet sets is less.</li> <li>Tera Steel inverts Garchomp's weaknesses to Fairy-, Dragon-, and Ice-type attacks such as Moonblast from Clefable, Outrage from Dragonite, and Blizzard from Alolan Ninetales; additionally, it allows Garchomp to resist Choice Specs-boosted Tera Steel Make It Rain from Gholdengo. Tera Ground increases the damage of Stomping Tantrum and Earthquake, allowing Garchomp to OHKO Gholdengo. Tera Fire provides similar resistances as Tera Steel while not granting a weakness to Fighting-type attacks, and it provides an immunity to burn.</li> </ul>"

Hatterene additionally threatens physically defensive foes that Gallade struggles to OHKO such as Amoonguss and provides powerful spread damage with Dazzling Gleam, which complements Gallade when it fails to achieve an OHKO. Indeedee-F provides redirection, allowing Gallade to safely set up Trick Room. It is additionally capable of setting up Trick Room itself while Gallade provides Wide Guard support. Indeedee-F setting up Psychic Terrain further supports Gallade by preventing Fake Out disruption and increasing the damage of Psycho Cut.</li> <li>Amoonguss threatens to put Gallade to sleep with Spore, often forcing it to Terastallize into a Grass-type. A partner Torkoal threatens Amoonguss with Eruption and Weather Ball and outspeeds it while Trick Room is active. Gholdengo is difficult for Gallade to remove and threatens to deal significant damage with its STAB attacks. Torkoal and Ursaluna can survive Gholdengo's attacks and threaten it in return with Eruption and Headlong Rush.

If paired with Hatterene, Gallade can be used to remove threats such as Kingambit and Incineroar. When facing Gholdengo, it can use Wide Guard to protect Hatterene from Make It Rain. If Gallade is paired with Indeedee-F, it can set Trick Room as Indeedee-F redirects attacks with Follow Me. However, there may be situations where Indeedee-F can be used to set up Trick Room itself while Gallade removes an opposing threat like Kingambit. Gallade can also use Wide Guard while Indeedee-F sets up Trick Room, protecting both Pokemon from attacks like Eruption from Hisuian Typhlosion.</li> <li>Gallade is checked by Ghost-types and threatened by their attacks like Shadow Ball and Last Respects. As a result, Gallade is very reliant on redirection from Indeedee-F or switching to it if Indeedee-F is not lead. Gallade also relies on Kingambit to threaten them.</li> <li>Foes with Imprison like Indeedee-M disrupt Trick Room teams and are often difficult for Gallade to remove, so it relies on partners like Ursaluna and Kingambit for this. If the opponent pivots around to stall out Trick Room turns, getting KOs while Trick Room is active becomes difficult for Gallade and its partners.

  "Whimsicott": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Whimsicott generally works well on hyper offensive teams that appreciate its ability to provide speed control and shut down opposing setup threats with Encore. Pokemon that have middling or high Speed tiers and strong offenses pair especially well with Whimsicott. Whimsicott can also work well on sun-centric teams, utilizing its ability to overwrite Pelipper's Drizzle with Sunny Day to maintain speed and weather control.</p> </li> <li> <p>Whimsicott pairs especially well with strong special attackers, namely Hisuian Typhlosion, Glimmora, Power Herb Archaludon, Gholdengo, and Garchomp. Their middling Speed tiers benefit greatly from Tailwind, and Hisuian Typhlosion in particular also appreciates Whimsicott's ability to set sun, boosting its Eruption further while mitigating its Water weakness. Annihilape can be used on some teams that want to employ Beat Up strategies, which can also be effective.</p> </li> <li> <p>Whimsicott can struggle into teams that can handle its partner's offensive onslaught or mitigate Whimsicott's Tailwind Speed advantage. However, by changing up Whimsicott's partner, it can break through some defensive cores that may stop one pairing but not the other. For example, while Incineroar may be able to beat Whimsicott and Hisuian Typhlosion, it loses to Meteor Beam Glimmora. Since Whimsicott generally pairs with strong, fast offensive threats, its playstyle is very vunerable to Trick Room, especially teams that have Psychic Terrain, which blocks Whimsicott's Prankster Encore. Due to this, Whimsicott generally likes to pair with Incineroar to shut down Trick Room teams while also allowing Whimsicott's frailer partners to pivot in safely.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Whimsicott exists as a support Pokemon, providing speed control through Prankster Tailwind and amplifying its partner's damage output through Helping Hand or Sunny Day.</li> <li>Whimsicott is almost always a lead Pokemon, with a hard-hitting partner that takes advantage of its Tailwind support. It almost always wants to be clicking Tailwind to gain the Speed advantage immediately, unless it is facing a Trick Room team that can turn that advantage on its head. Against bulkier cores that may not have speed control or care about moving first, Whimsicott may choose to use Helping Hand or Sunny Day to try to break through those cores with its partner's sheer power.</li> <li>Whimsicott is mainly weak to strong priority that can take it out before it can set Tailwind, mainly Tera Normal Extreme Speed from Dragonite and Brave Bird from Talonflame. Pokemon that can stomach many hits and slow down the level of offense coming from Whimsicott's side can also be a problem, since Whimsicott is so frail that it can usually only afford to set Tailwind or Sunny Day once. By choosing certain partners for Whimsicott, this matchup problem can be turned on its head. Pokemon such as Glimmora can beat common counters to Whimsicott, including Talonflame, Dragonite, and Incineroar. Pokemon that block priority moves can also support Whimsicott, such as Indeedee with Psychic Terrain and Farigiraf with Armor Tail.</li> </ul>",

Whimsicott also provides valuable support to its team through the use of Encore to disrupt opposing strategies or Helping Hand and Sunny Day to boost its partner's damage output.</li> <li>Encore is generally preferred to be able to pin opposing Pokemon into positions where they cannot use Protect, dissuade setup, and lock opposing Pokemon into moves such as Fake Out or Tailwind. Helping Hand is the preferred last move on Whimsicott for most teams because it provides a damage boost to any of Whimsicott's partners. Sunny Day is used on certain hyper offense teams to boost Hisuian Typhlosion's Eruption and provide weather control against Pelipper. Protect is almost always used on Focus Sash sets to block Fake Out without the need to Terastallize into a Ghost-type. Beat Up is specifically used with Annihilape to boost its Rage Fist; this, in conjunction with Tailwind, makes it into a threat as quickly as possible.</li> <li>Covert Cloak is generally preferred on Whimsicott to block the effects of Fake Out, allowing Whimsicott to get Tailwind off without having to run Protect. However, Focus Sash is sometimes used on teams that want Whimsicott's support on the field for longer. Focus Sash also allows Whimsicott to set Tailwind in front of Talonflame, which would otherwise KO Whimsicott before it can set Tailwind with Brave Bird in conjunction with Gale Wings.</li> <li>Tera Water can be used to give Covert Cloak Whimsicott an extra turn on the field against common Pokemon such as Incineroar, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Gholdengo, though it must watch out for Rillaboom's now supereffective priority Grassy Glide. Tera Ghost gives Whimsicott an immunity to common priority moves, namely Fake Out and Extreme Speed and is usually seen on Focus Sash sets, as they are susceptible to Fake Out. Tera Fire offers similar defensive benefits to Tera Water while still resisting Rillaboom's Grassy Glide after Terastallization. However, Tera Fire makes Whimsicott weak to common moves such a as Primarina's Liquid Voice Hyper Voice and Pelipper's Weather Ball under rain. Tera Dark is a niche option on Focus Sash sets that gives Whimsicott an immunity to opposing Prankster moves from the likes of Murkrow and opposing Whimsicott.</li> <li>The first spread for Covert Cloak Whimsicott maximizes HP investment over damage output to live attacks that would otherwise prevent it from setting Tailwind. Focus Sash sets, on the other hand, invest more into Special Attack.</li> </ul>"

Porygon2 is another strong partner, setting Trick Room for Amoonguss while benefiting from Amoonguss redirecting Fighting-type attacks that threaten it and Taunt, which could prevent Porygon2 from setting Trick Room or healing with Recover.</li> <li>Amoonguss is very weak into Pokemon that it cannot put to sleep like Gholdengo, Safety Goggles Incineroar, and Rillaboom, as its attacks will not be doing very much damage while its foes can freely set up or attack into its teammates.

  "Volcarona": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Setup Volcarona fits well on balance teams, as it requires utility and defensive support to enable it to sweep.</li> <li>Rillaboom is an excellent teammate, as it uses Fake Out to give Volcarona room to set up and sets up Grassy Terrain that augments Volcarona's passive recovery and powers up Giga Drain. Redirectors like Clefable draw attacks away from Volcarona, letting it set up more easily. Intimidate users like Incineroar supplement Volcarona's ability to enhance its special bulk by reducing the damage of physical attackers.</li> <li>Kingambit is a common teammate on the balance teams that Volcarona fits on. Assault Vest variants threaten foes like Incineroar, Tyranitar, and Dragapult that Volcarona struggles against. Another common choice on balance teams is Sneasler, which can threaten Rock-types and Incineroar that stuff Volcarona, and it can use Fake Out to give Volcarona room to set up or Coaching to bolster Volcarona's physical bulk.</li> <li>If Volcarona has not Terastallized into a Fairy-type, it struggles with Dragon-types like Dragonite, so Fairy- and Dragon-types like Clefable and Dragapult can help it with that. Volcarona, before Terastallizing into a Grass- or Dragon-type, hates Water- and Rock-types like Basculegion-M and Tyranitar, so Grass-types like Rillaboom give it leeway against them. Additionally, Volcarona's coverage does not extend to Fire-types like Incineroar; Water-types like Primarina threaten them. Primarina also checks Dragon-types, making it a uniquely good teammate.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>As a setup sweeper, Volcarona wants Fake Out support and redirection to give it breathing room to set up. The earlier in the game Volcarona can get set up, the more difficult it will be to remove it from the field, as a boosted Volcarona will be able to take multiple special attacks. Intimidate cycling assists in this, as it reinforces Volcarona's physical bulk to complement Quiver Dance, which boosts its special bulk.</li> <li>Volcarona is actually one of the greatest adversaries of rain teams, as with redirection support from Electabuzz and Terastallization, it can boost to a level where it takes the special attacks of the rain attackers with ease. From there, its boosted attacks will rip apart these rain attackers and completely deny them the ability to revenge kill it. In these matchups, it's better to avoid using too many attacks on Archaludon, as its Stamina-boosted Body Press will eventually become too strong for Volcarona to handle. Early in the game, Pelipper threatens Volcarona with both of its STAB moves, so redirection will prevent Volcarona from being KOed by Pelipper before it can get set up. Additionally, Swift Swim Basculegion-M is a threat before Volcarona has set up, easily outspeeding and overwhelming it with rain-boosted Water-type attacks.</li> <li>Volcarona lacks coverage to threaten Dragon-types unless it has Terastallized into a Fairy-type, so the likes of Dragapult and Dragonite can take it on effectively. This extends to Tera Dragon Pokemon like Gholdengo, which gain the ability to resist its Fire-type STAB moves. Fairy- and fast Dragon-types like Clefable and Scale Shot Dragonite threaten these Dragon-types. Similarly, Fire-types like Incineroar and Tera Fire users like Rillaboom can deal with both of its attacks, and they are also immune to burns from Heat Wave and Flame Body; Water-types like Primarina can deal with these Pokemon. If Volcarona is not using Tera Grass Giga Drain, then Water- and Rock-types like Primarina and Garganacl give it issues; Grass-types like Rillaboom can assist Volcarona in this vein. Trick Room teams invalidate Volcarona's Speed boost, though the Special Defense boost enables it to take attacks from the special attackers on these teams. Another useful tactic is to use physical attackers, as it has worse Defense and cannot improve it with Quiver Dance, though Volcarona can mitigate this issue with Intimidate support.</li> </ul>",

        "description": "<ul> <li>Volcarona utilizes the bulk, power, and Speed granted by Quiver Dance; its useful coverage; and Terastallization, which lets it work its way around its checks, to become difficult to take down and take over games as a result.</li> <li>Tera Blast Fairy lets Volcarona defeat Dragon-types that can stand up to Heat Wave; Giga Drain hits Water- and Rock-types while providing additional recovery to let Volcarona stay on the field longer. Tera Blast is used only on Tera Fairy sets, whereas Giga Drain sees play on Tera Grass and Tera Dragon sets.</li> <li>Covert Cloak lets Volcarona ignore Fake Out to set up or throw out its attacks more freely, and it prevents Snarl, Icy Wind, and Dire Claw from impeding its sweep. Leftovers gives Volcarona passive recovery, augmenting the recovery that Giga Drain provides to be at higher HP to survive more attacks.</li> <li>Tera Fairy lets Volcarona bypass Dragon-type attacks like Dragapult's Dragon Darts and Dragonite's Scale Shot and maintain a resistance to Fighting-type attacks like Sneasler's Close Combat. Tera Grass gives Volcarona a resistance to Water- and Electric-type attacks like Basculegion's Wave Crash and Archaludon's Electro Shot, makes it immune to Amoonguss's Spore, and powers up Giga Drain, turning +1 Giga Drain from a 2HKO into an OHKO on Basculegion and doing the same with +2 Giga Drain for Primarina. This additionally lets it restore more HP in the process, making it more likely to sweep games. Tera Dragon gives Volcarona similar defensive benefits and doesn't make it weak to Pelipper's Hurricane, Sneasler's Dire Claw, and Fire-type attacks like Armarouge's Armor Cannon and Incineroar's Flare Blitz, though it becomes weak to Dragon-type attacks like Dragapult's Dragon Darts and Dondozo's Order Up.</li> <li>180 Speed EVs and a Timid nature ensure that Volcarona will outspeed Annihilape, as well as other mid-speed Pokemon like Gholdengo and Archaludon. With 164 Special Attack EVs, Tera Blast Fairy will OHKO offensive Dragapult, as well as maximum HP Annihilape after a Quiver Dance. The bulk investment ensures that Volcarona survives a Tera Normal Blood Moon from Life Orb Ursaluna-B after a Quiver Dance and, after Terastallizing, two Rock Slides from Tyranitar if Leftovers or Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain are in play to neutralize sandstorm damage.</li> <li>Alternatively, Volcarona can lean into its bulk with maximum HP investment, which can benefit from the recovery offered by Giga Drain. After the aforementioned Speed investment to outspeed Annihilape, the rest of the EVs are put into Defense, letting Volcarona survive physical priority moves like Black Glasses Kingambit's Tera Dark Sucker Punch and Choice Band Dragonite's Tera Normal Extreme Speed. Even with minimal Special Defense investment, Volcarona has enough special bulk to survive Pelipper's Hurricane; after a Quiver Dance, it will take a Blood Moon from Tera Normal Life Orb Ursaluna-B or a Choice Scarf Tera Fire Overheat from Hisuian Typhlosion in sun, assuming it hasn't Terastallized into a Grass-type.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Volcarona has a solid place in Regulation I due to its ability to function as a support piece for its team, using redirection to protect its teammates and punish physical attackers, most notably Urshifu-R, Zamazenta-C, and Iron Hands, with Rocky Helmet and potential Flame Body burns. It can utilize Struggle Bug and other moves such as Will-O-Wisp to further support its team while outputting strong damage using its Fire-type STAB move.</li> <li>Fiery Dance is the Fire-type STAB option for Volcarona, being able to boost its damage output while dealing sizeable damage, with the damage boost allowing for it to potentially pick up a 2HKO on Calyrex-I and Rillaboom. Will-O-Wisp can be used to neuter physical threats such as Calyrex-I and Zamazenta-C without relying on Flame Body, while Tailwind can allow Volcarona to support its team through speed control. Struggle Bug allows Volcarona to hamper the opponent's special offense while dealing decent damage and breaking Focus Sashes, which is particularly problematic for opposing Calyrex-S; it also can break Lunala's Shadow Shield while crippling its offense.</li> <li>Rocky Helmet in tandem with Flame Body punishes contact moves greatly, especially those that come from Urshifu-R, while Electric Seed can be used on Miraidon teams to further bolster Volcarona's physical bulk and afford it more survivability, most importantly allowing it to live a Life Orb Flare Blitz from Koraidon.</li> <li>The first EV spread allows Volcarona to take a +1 Life Orb Calyrex-S Astral Barrage and a Choice Specs Miraidon Volt Switch the majority of the time, three Glacial Lances from Calyrex-I and a Tera Fire Flame Charge from Life Orb Koraidon while allowing Volcarona to outspeed Adamant Urshifu-R. The second EV spread allows Volcarona to take two Sword of Ruin-boosted Body Presses from Zamazenta-C, two Sucker Punches from Chien-Pao, and a +2 Astral Barrage from Calyrex-S without a boosting item.</li> <li>Tera Dragon allows Volcarona to resist Water-, Fire- and Electric-type attacks from the likes of Urshifu-R, Ogerpon-H, and Miraidon, respectively, allowing Volcarona to maintain a strong defensive presence. Tera Water provides a resistance to the aforementioned Water- and Fire-type attacks while crucially maintaining a resistance to Glacial Lance from Calyrex-I after Terastallizing.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Ogerpon-C is very problematic for Volcarona, as it is able to threaten to OHKO it with Ivy Cudgel, which also avoids Rocky Helmet and Flame Body due to it not making contact, while ignoring Rage Powder due to its Grass typing and still dealing large damage after Volcarona Terastallizes. Similarly, Miraidon can threaten Volcarona with massive damage before and after Terastallization while not being threatened by it in return.</li> <li>Foes that have powerful spread options, namely Calyrex-S and Kyogre, can also be problematic, as they can deal massive damage to Volcarona and its partner while ignoring Volcarona's redirection.</li> <li>Miraidon pairs amazingly with Volcarona, as Volcarona can protect Miraidon from powerful attacks, notably Ice Spinner from Chien-Pao and Play Rough from Zacian-C, while threatening Rillaboom, which can be problematic for Miraidon. In return, Miraidon can hit Water- and Flying-types like Urshifu-R, Kyogre, and Tornadus with massive damage from its Electric-type STAB moves.</li> <li>Calyrex-I also pairs very effectively with Volcarona, with Calyrex-I greatly appreciating redirection to allow it to safely set Trick Room and sweep; it also hits Dragon-types that can threaten Volcarona such as Miraidon and Koraidon with Glacial Lance.</li> <li>Zamazenta-C partners well with Volcarona, with Volcarona's redirection allowing Zamazenta-C to stay safe, notably from Koraidon. Zamazenta-C's Wide Guard alleviates Volcarona's weakness to spread and its Body Press threatens Ogerpon-C.</li> <li>Grimmsnarl can set up dual screens to assist Volcarona in supporting the team, while Volcarona's redirection can assist Grimmsnarl to in safely setting the screens up, and they both form a strong utility core for a team. Iron Hands threatens many common counters to Volcarona, notably Ogerpon-C and Kyogre, while Iron Hands greatly appreciates Volcarona's redirection and ability to threaten Amoonguss and Rillaboom.</li> <li>Rillaboom itself pairs well with Volcarona, with Rillaboom threatening Water-types like Urshifu-R and Kyogre, and Volcarona in return hits Amoonguss and other Grass-types that can wall Rillaboom.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Tornadus is one of two viable priority Tailwind setters in the metagame, pairing excellently with Restricted Pokemon like Calyrex-S, Zamazenta-C, and Kyogre that appreciate its combination of weather control, speed control, and Flying-type STAB moves that allow it to threaten Restricted Pokemon like Koraidon as well as non-Restricted Pokemon like Amoonguss, Rillaboom, and the Urshifu formes.</li> <li>Bleakwind Storm is used for strong spread Flying-type STAB damage, while Hurricane is chosen to hit through the Wide Guard used by Zamazenta and Lunala while securing an OHKO on the Urshifu formes. Hurricane is only an option on Kyogre teams due to its inconsistency outside of rain. Rain Dance deactivates Koraidon's Orichalcum Pulse and significantly weakens its Fire-type moves while also setting up the rain for its own Water-type partners like Urshifu-R and Kyogre. Taunt is chosen to prevent status moves like Zamazenta-C's Wide Guard, Amoonguss's Spore, and Calyrex-I or Lunala's Trick Room that would disable or take advantage of Tornadus and its partners, Kyogre and Calyrex-S. Generally, Tornadus runs Protect on non-Covert Cloak sets in order to avoid flinches from Fake Out or on offensive teams that do not need Rain Dance and would prefer the increased staying power generated by Protect.</li> <li>Covert Cloak is chosen to allow Tornadus to set up Tailwind against Fake Out Pokemon like Incineroar and Rillaboom that would otherwise leave it vulnerable to being KOed or pressure it into using Protect . Rocky Helmet is chosen in order to allow Tornadus to punish Urshifu-R and Koraidon, forcing them to take significant recoil.</li> <li>The Speed investment allows Tornadus to outspeed maximum Speed Groudon and Kyogre, while the bulk investment allows Tornadus to survive Tera Water Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R or Thunderclap from Raging Bolt.</li> <li>Tera Dark is chosen to allow Tornadus to block Taunt from opposing Tornadus and Encore from opposing Whimsicott, while also providing it a key resistance to Calyrex-S's STAB moves.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Raging Bolt and Miraidon threaten to OHKO Tornadus with their STAB Electric-type moves, being able to OHKO it with a Special Attack Protosynthesis-boosted Thunderclap, which takes Tornadus out before it can move, or Volt Switch, which creates momentum for the opposing team, respectively. Tornadus also hates Pokemon that are able to set up Trick Room against it while threatening to OHKO it, with Restricted Pokemon like Calyrex-I and Meteor Beam Lunala being able dissuade Tornadus's Taunt with their offensive pressure. Indeedee-F and Farigaraf also present unique challenges to Tornadus, as the two of them are able to set up Trick Room while also blocking Tornadus's Prankster Taunt with their abilities. While Tornadus can OHKO Whimsicott, its Speed combined with Prankster Encore allow it to shut down Tornadus and punish it for using Tailwind or prevent it altogether with Taunt.</li> <li>Urshifu-R is Tornadus's premier partner, being able to take advantage of both the Tailwind and Rain Dance it sets up in order to do massive damage uncontested by Protect. Rillaboom is able to contest Indeedee-F and Miraidon's Terrains, threatening the former and switching in on the latter while also applying Fake Out pressure, allowing Tornadus to more effectively set Tailwind throughout the course of a game. Landorus is notable for its ability to OHKO both Raging Bolt and Miraidon while appreciating Tornadus's Tailwind allowing it to outspeed threats like Calyrex-S, Zamazenta-C, and the aforementioned Miraidon.</li> <li>Kyogre is another of Tornadus's primary partners, with Tornadus being able to hit Grass-types like Rillaboom, Amoonguss, and the Ogerpon formes super effectively with its Flying-type attacks for it while also being able to reset rain into opposing weather control. Tornadus appreciates Kyogre's ability to output immense damage into Trick Room setters like Calyrex-I, Lunala, Farigiraf, and Indeedee-F, allowing it to freely set Tailwind for its partners. Calyrex-S also greatly appreciates Tornadus's Tailwind, which allows it to gain an advantage against opposing Calyrex-S and Koraidon. Tornadus's Taunt support is vital for both Restricted Pokemon, as it is able to prevent Zamazenta-C and Lunala from using Wide Guard. Zacian-C is a also a notable partner because it appreciates Tornadus's ability to set Tailwind against Miraidon and Calyrex-S while taking advantage of its ability to set rain in the face of Koraidon. Zacian-C is also able to handle a lot of Tornadus's checks, since it is able to outspeed and OHKO Raging Bolt, Miraidon, and most Calyrex-I.</li> </ul>"

It has positive matchups versus various metagame staples, such as Koraidon, Rillaboom, and Amoonguss, as well as good neutral matchups into much more of the metagame.</li> <li>Taunt provides disruption, denying otherwise crippling plays from opposing supporting moves; it's especially helpful for Trick Room and Wide Guard users, since negating those allow Tailwind and Bleakwind Storm to be effective.</li> <li>Sharp Beak lets Tornadus be more flexible, since it will be able to deal good chip damage even when Taunted; this allows Tornadus to run more bulk. With the Sharp Beak, it has a chance to OHKO Koraidon and 2HKOes Amoonguss and Rillaboom.</li> <li>The Defense and HP investment allows Tornadus to live a Behemoth Blade from +1 Zacian-C and a Surging Strikes from Mystic Water Urshifu-R; the Special Defense investment allows Tornadus to survive an Astral Barrage or a Psychic from a Life Orb Calyrex-S. The Speed investment lets Tornadus outspeed the entire unboosted metagame under Tailwind, as well as letting partner Smeargle outspeed and use Decorate on Tornadus, letting +2 Tornadus 2HKO bulky Pokemon like Zamazenta-C. The remaining EVs are invested into Special Attack.</li> <li>Tera Dragon lets it live a Water Spout in rain from Kyogre, a Flare Blitz from Koraidon in sun, a Meteor Beam from Lunala, or an Overheat from Modest Chi-Yu.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Tornadus dislikes opposing Whimsicott, since a Taunt or Encore will largely limit Tornadus's usefulness. It's also susceptible to Fake Out users like Incineroar and Iron Hands, as it doesn't have Covert Cloak or Tera Ghost.</li> <li>Tornadus is countered by Raging Bolt, Miraidon, and Calyrex-I, all of which threaten OHKOs on Tornadus both before and after Terastallizing and can easily take Bleakwind Storms multiple times.</li> <li>Tornadus appreciates Smeargle, since Smeargle can redirect dangerous Electro Drifts, Thunderclaps, and Thunderbolts from Miraidon and Raging Bolt, respectively, and can block opposing Glacial Lances, Water Spouts, and Origin Pulses from Calyrex-I and Kyogre, respectively, with Wide Guard.</li> <li>Restricted Pokémon like Zamazenta-C, Calyrex-S, and Kyogre appreciate being around Tornadus, since it can let them outspeed everything with Tailwind, excluding Speed Booster Energy Iron Treads and Flutter Mane. Tornadus can also deny opposing Wide Guard with Taunt, letting Calyrex-S and Kyogre freely fire off Astral Barrage and Water Spout, respectively.</li> <li>Rillaboom acts as a check to Raging Bolt and Miraidon, easily tanking Electric-type damage for Tornadus while getting rid of Electric Terrain. It is also important Fake Out support that moves before Incineroar and Iron Hands.</li> <li>Raging Bolt is also a wonderful partner for Tornadus, since they cover each other great defensively and together have nigh-unresisted coverage; additionally, Raging Bolt can revenge kill Miraidon and opposing Raging Bolt after Tailwind has been set up.</li> </ul>"

Taunt gives Landorus a great option into Pokemon that use dual screens, Wide Guard, or Trick Room, shutting down those options for Pokemon like Grimmsnarl and Lunala.</li> <li>Life Orb and Sheer Force enable Landorus to pick up most of its KOs, most notably OHKOing Miraidon and Incineroar with Earth Power and 2HKOing Rillaboom with Sludge Bomb.</li> <li>The offensive investment allows Landorus to OHKO Urshifu-R with no defensive investment with Earth Power, while Landorus's defensive investment allows it to live a Choice Band Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R when Landorus is Terastallized, as well as living a Choice Specs Miraidon's Draco Meteor when Landorus is behind Light Screen.</li> <li>Tera Poison allows Landorus to remove its weaknesses to Water- and Ice-type attacks like Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R and Ice Spinner from Chien-Pao that typically give it a lot of trouble while increasing the power of Sludge Bomb, which most notably turns Sludge Bomb into an OHKO into Rillaboom following Wood Hammer recoil.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Landorus's typing means that it is threatened by Calyrex-I and Kyogre, which can easily OHKO Landorus. Koraidon can also pose an issue to Landorus, as it can outspeed and OHKO Landorus with Flare Blitz.</li> <li>Chien-Pao is another major threat to Landorus, as it threatens to outspeed and OHKO Landorus with its Ice-type attacks. Amoonguss can also be a difficult foe, as Amoonguss always survives any attack Landorus uses and can use Spore to immobilize it.</li> <li>Grimmsnarl partners well with Landorus, giving it some much needed bulk and support with dual screens while slowing down opposing Pokemon such as Koraidon with Thunder Wave, which can allow Landorus to outspeed them and threaten massive damage. This especially supports matchups into Kyogre and Koraidon, as dual screens prevent OHKOs from Flare Blitz and any of Kyogre's moves after Landorus has Terastallized.</li> <li>Incineroar is also a very good partner, as Intimidate weakens the damage output of Calyrex-I and Koraidon, unless they are holding a Clear Amulet, which can be removed with Knock Off. Will-O-Wisp also cripples Calyrex-I's and Chien-Pao's damage output, regardless of what item Calyrex-I runs.</li> <li>Miraidon pairs naturally with Landorus, as it poses a threat to many of the top dangers to Landorus, such as Kyogre and Koraidon, with powerful Electric-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type attacks, while Landorus deals massive damage to some of Miraidon's biggest counterplay in Zamazenta-C and Rillaboom.</li> <li>Landorus also is a great partner to Calyrex-I, as Landorus is able to threaten the Fire-types that scare Calyrex-I, such as Incineroar and Chi-Yu, while Calyrex-I can use Glacial Lance to deal significant damage to Amoonguss and Koraidon.</li> </ul>"

  "Talonflame": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Talonflame is most common as the main supportive option on teams that aim to overwhelm the opponent and win quickly, such as hyper offense, where priority speed control in the form of Tailwind is especially valuable. Its most common partner by far is Choice Specs Gholdengo, which, when paired with Covert Cloak Talonflame, prevents Fake Out and makes it difficult to stop a turn one Tailwind + Tera Steel Make it Rain. This duo is also particularly strong with Dondozo and Commander Tatsugiri, softening up teams for Dondozo to clean up in the endgame.</li> <li>Talonflame doesn't particularly need any partners to function well; it instead serves to complement its teammates.</li> <li>Talonflame's main competition is Whimsicott, which doesn't have to worry about about losing access to priority moves thanks to Prankster, as well as having better enabling tools such as Sunny Day for Hisuian Typhlosion and Delphox and Beat Up for Annihilape. Talonflame has more general utility tools with Will-O-Wisp and non-Prankster Taunt, is faster, and can OHKO it first with priority Brave Bird, but it generally isn't as support-oriented as Whimsicott.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Talonflame's biggest strength is immediate turn one pressure. Take advantage of that. You generally always want to be leading Talonflame and setting up Tailwind; going for an attack is risky before Tailwind is up, as you lose Gale Wings and a significant chunk of Talonflame's health. Once Tailwind is up, sacrificing it for a free switch is usually the play. If you have the opportunity for a safe switch, however, take it, as Talonflame's coverage and Speed makes it a great late-game cleaner.</li> <li>The only real reason to use Talonflame over Whimsicott is coverage and damage, functioning almost like a glass cannon with access to priority Tailwind. Flying- and Fire-type coverage is excellent into the metagame, and its Speed means it's always a credible threat. Go for damage whenever possible after setting up Tailwind.</li> <li>The best way to handle Talonflame is to nullify either its damage or priority speed control. Pokemon with Intimidate severely hamper Talonflame's offensive pressure, and even Pokemon like Electabuzz and Primarina that can eat one of its attacks and return back for strong damage are difficult matchups. Alternatively, nullifying its priority or Speed advantage also works well. Priority attacks like Fake Out and Extreme Speed break Gale Wings, with the former often completely preventing Tailwind from being set up on non-Covert Cloak sets. Priority blocking abilities like both Indeedee's Psychic Surge are difficult but not common. Incineroar is likely the biggest pain spot for Talonflame teams, as it walls Gholdengo, can break Gale Wings with Fake Out, and has Intimidate to cripple Talonflame offensively. If you're playing Talonflame, you have to be careful when leading it into Incineroar and Sneasler teams, and usually, it's best to completely leave it behind in matchups against balance teams.</li> </ul>",

Talonflame's high Speed means it's usually not too bothered by Gale Wings breaking. Life Orb and Sharp Beak are two sides of the same coin; they are offensive items to pick up OHKOes on foes that Covert Cloak sets don't at the cost of being vulnerable to Fake Out. Life Orb allows for cleaner OHKOes such as OHKOing Rillaboom regardless of its defensive investment as well as boosting Flare Blitz, while Sharp Beak is an option if you prefer not taking recoil at the cost of damage output, such as only having a 60% chance to OHKO the previously mentioned Rillaboom.</li> <li>The choice of Tera type is mostly dependent on personal preference. Tera Ghost prevents Fake Out, Extreme Speed, and other priority moves from breaking Gale Wings. Tera Flying is used for damage, allowing Sharp Beak and Life Orb sets to cleanly OHKO Amoonguss, as well as some frail neutral types such as Delphox and Hisuian Typhlosion, with Brave Bird. Tera Grass gives a resistance to Water, Electric, and an important immunity to powder attacks; this is used to bypass opposing Rage Powders and Taunt an opposing Trick Room user on turn one.</li> <li>Jolly is usually preferred for outspeeding Adamant Dragapult, Whimsicott, and Sneasler, but Adamant is also viable to maximize damage, allowing it to OHKO Amoonguss without Terastallization on Life Orb sets.</li> <li>The last two moveslots are open to player preference and usually mix and matched, the usual 2 are Flare Blitz and Taunt, giving it an additional STAB move and extra utility, respectively, but Will-O-Wisp and Protect are also viable; the former cripples physical threats like Dondozo, and the latter is generally useful.</li> </ul>"

  "Vivillon": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Vivillon works well on offensive teams, acting as a fast sleep support Pokemon while still hitting hard into defensive pieces like Rillaboom and Amoonguss. Sleep Powder can shut down slower foes such as Annihilape and Primarina, keeping the momentum for offensive threats like Garchomp. Vivillon also works well on balance, specifically with Porygon2, redirecting or shutting down attacks for Porygon2 while also sitting next to Ursaluna as it uses Earthquake.</p> </li> <li> <p>Thanks to Vivillon's Flying typing, it can be used next to Garchomp and its easily spammable Earthquake amazingly. Earthquake also forces threats such as Archaludon to go for Tera Grass, which then opens up Vivillon to hit hard with Hurricane. Vivillon can also put foes to sleep for Garchomp, which sets it apart from other Flying-types. Gholdengo is another solid partner for Vivillon, benefiting from redirection.</p> </li> <li> <p>Vivillon loses to Maushold and Annihilape as a duo, as Annihilape threatens Vivillon after it Terastallizes, and Maushold can shut down Vivillon by outspeeding it and using Taunt. It can also struggle with Maushold and Archaludon as a duo, with Maushold this time threatening Population Bomb as well as Taunt while Archaludon can take down Vivillon with Electro Shot, Flash Cannon, and Draco Meteor. Garchomp and Gholdengo can patch up these holes; Garchomp's Earthquake hits hard into all of the aforementioned foes, while Gholdengo can do the same with Shadow Ball and Make It Rain. Garchomp also has the added benefit of Rough Skin, damaging Maushold for attacking.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Vivillon's main role is to put things to sleep with high Speed, hit decently hard, and redirect attacks to protect allies. Vivillon really shines when next to Garchomp, putting slower foes likes Pelipper to sleep and redirecting attacks such as Moonblast from Primarina and Draco Meteor from Hydreigon.</p> </li> <li> <p>Vivillon can be used best in early-game situations and works really well in the lead or even in the back next to Gholdengo, spamming Sleep Powder while Gholdengo uses Make It Rain or using Rage Powder to allow Gholdengo to set up and sweep. Vivillon can also be used next to Primarina, with Hyper Voice and Sleep Powder forcing Tera Grass from foes such as Incineroar, which can then allow Vivillon to hit hard with Hurricane.</p> </li> <li> <p>Vivillon can struggle with Pokemon like Incineroar chipping it down and breaking Focus Sash, and smart pivoting into Grass-types or Safety Goggles Pokemon can make it hard for Vivillon to do its job.

    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Amoonguss works exceptionally well with Incineroar, protecting it from Water- and Fighting-type attacks such as Basculegion’s Wave Crash and Annihilape’s Drain Punch. Amoonguss also provides Incineroar with much appreciated healing. In return, Incineroar can handle Gholdengo and switch into Fire-types like Talonflame and Volcarona as well as removing opposing Safety Goggles with Knock Off.</li> <li>Incineroar also works well with Gholdengo, providing Intimidate and Fake Out support to help it set up safely. Gholdengo also takes advantage of Incineroar’s ability to do great damage to Kingambit, considering Gholdengo can blow up Clefable and Sneasler that may attempt to protect Kingambit.</li> <li>Porygon2 and Ursaluna can set up Trick Room and Substitute more easily thanks to Incineroar’s support. Ursaluna can then blow up Pokemon Incineroar struggles to damage like Archaludon and opposing Incineroar.</li> <li>Incineroar can struggle to do its job against Pokemon that threaten it such as Pelipper, the Ursaluna formes, and Annihilape. Bulky support Incineroar can also feel passive at times because of its lackluster damage output, especially when it can’t use Parting Shot because of redirection or Taunt. Therefore, offensive Pokemon like Gholdengo and Ursaluna that can take on these threats and make up for Incineroar’s poor damage output are greatly appreciated.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Incineroar is an effective support Pokemon and pivot thanks to Fake Out, Intimidate, and its pivoting moves. This makes Incineroar strongest when it can switch in and slow down threats like Sneasler and Rillaboom. When using Taunt or Will-O-Wisp, Incineroar can shut down opposing wincons like Porygon2’s Trick Room and Kingambit. Rage Powder from Amoonguss makes it easier for Incineroar to pivot in and out.</li> <li>Incineroar is strong throughout the entire game; it's usually preserved throughout the game, as even switching it in is impactful, and a late-game Fake Out can be crucial regardless of how injured Incineroar is. Incineroar is notably strongest as a lead where it can threaten Fake Out and weaken opposing threats without risking any damage. Against Annihilape and Kingambit however, Incineroar likes to be paired with pieces that force them out before coming in, such as Gholdengo and Ursaluna. Assault Vest Incineroar can afford to stay in and do invaluable damage as an offensive piece occasionally, though it notably has to be a lot more careful against Amoonguss.</li> <li>Incineroar’s biggest weaknesses are Annihilape and Kingambit, as they take advantage of Intimidate and can prove to be dangerous wincons with support. Pelipper and Ursaluna-B also prove troublesome, (AC) as they are powerful attackers unaffected by Intimidate. Incineroar relies on teammates such as the aforementioned Gholdengo and Ursaluna to handle these threats along with Fake Out support. When Incineroar pivots in, it can also lead to a loss of momentum against setup Pokemon that can’t be flinched with Fake Out, such as Bulk Up Annihilape, Nasty Plot Gholdengo, and Substitute Ursaluna, so it must be careful when pivoting. Bulky support Incineroar’s damage output can often feel underwhelming, especially against opposing Incineroar. Assault Vest Incineroar has a tougher time providing support, notably having more trouble getting setup sweepers into position, since it lacks Parting Shot. This can make the mirror matchup tougher, as opposing Incineroar can position their threatening allies better.</li> </ul>",

    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Primarina fits well on balance teams, as it benefits from utility moves like Fake Out, healing, and redirection support that allow it to attack freely while other Pokemon cover its weaknesses.</li> <li>Primarina synergizes well with Sneasler, as Sneasler covers its Grass-type weakness. Additionally, Rillaboom offers Fake Out utility and passive Grassy Terrain recovery, benefiting a bulkier attacker like Primarina.</li> <li>Electabuzz is an effective redirector, shielding Primarina from threats like Archaludon and Sneasler while also redirecting Spores from Amoonguss thanks to its Vital Spirit ability and providing speed control with Electroweb. Similarly, Magmar makes a great partner with its access to Vital Spirit and Follow Me. In addition, Magmar resists Rillaboom's Grass-type attacks and can use Will-O-Wisp to compensate for Primarina’s lower physical bulk.</li> <li>Though Primarina sits in an awkward Speed tier, it can operate on teams with a Trick Room mode such as compositions with Porygon2 and Ursaluna.</li> <li>Kingambit is a strong offensive partner for Primarina. With Primarina's chip damage, Kingambit can more easily secure KOs with Sucker Punch. Additionally, most Kingambit sets include Swords Dance, allowing it to punish passive plays and forcing the opponent to choose between Primarina or Kingambit to target.</li> <li>Gholdengo is another common partner for Primarina, as they effectively cover each other's weaknesses. Primarina threatens Pokemon like Incineroar and Garchomp, which can beat Gholdengo, while Gholdengo walls and pressures threats like Sneasler, Rillaboom, and Amoonguss.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>As a slower-paced offensive piece, Primarina excels when it's positioned to safely chip away at opponents. For instance, being alongside a redirection Pokemon allows it to unleash substantial chip damage with Hyper Voice. Due to its respectable bulk, Primarina can often continue using Hyper Voice until a Pokémon that poses a significant immediate threat, such as Rillaboom, enters the field.</li> <li>The strategy with Primarina is to wait for the opportunity to establish a strong offensive position. Typically, this involves pivoting it around until it can come in and clean up effectively mid- or late-game.</li> <li>As mentioned earlier, Rillaboom and Archaludon are significant threats; however, Sneasler effectively counters both. When facing opposing Sneasler or setup sweepers like Gholdengo or Volcarona, it's crucial to position Primarina correctly—either by placing it next to a redirector, so it can attack freely, or by utilizing other Pokemon to apply more immediate pressure. This is because Primarina is most effective when its consistent spread chip damage is sufficient to prevent it from being outpaced on offense.</li> </ul>",

Additionally, it puts pressure on common metagame Pokemon like Incineroar and Garchomp.</li> <li>Haze prevents setup Pokémon from exploiting Primarina's slower offensive pace. More importantly, it's often used to counter the Dondozo and Tatsugiri matchup.</li> <li>While Throat Spray provides a power boost after using Hyper Voice, Life Orb offers more immediate damage, making it better suited for more aggressive teams. For example, Life Orb guarantees an OHKO on Hisuian Typhlosion with Hyper Voice while allowing Primarina to 2HKO Sneasler and Choice Specs Gholdengo with Hyper Voice. Sitrus Berry, on the other hand, enables Primarina to take on a more passive role, consistently enhancing its survivability. For instance, Sitrus Berry's recovery enables it to live two Stomping Tantrums from Life Orb Garchomp.</li> <li>Tera Poison allows Primarina to resist both of Sneasler's STAB moves and, unlike the other two recommended Tera types, doesn't introduce many common weaknesses. Tera Steel gives Primarina an immunity to Poison-type moves like Sneasler's Dire Claw and a resistance to Steel-type attacks, making it particularly effective against Gholdengo's Make it Rain.

This lets Lunala both set up and take down Trick Room or continue dealing damage.</li> <li>Lunala's Special Attack investment allows it to 3HKO many bulky Pokemon, such as Zamazenta-C, Calyrex-I after Terastallization, and Amoonguss with Moongeist Beam. Its bulk allows it to survive Tera Fire Flare Blitz from Ability Shield Koraidon under Neutralizing Gas and Timid Choice Specs Miraidon Electro Drift half of the time.</li> <li>Tera Fairy allows Lunala to resist Dark-type attacks such as Knock Off from Incineroar while being immune to Draco Meteor from Miraidon and removing Lunala's weakness to Ghost. It also allows Lunala to 3HKO Incineroar with Tera Fairy Moonblast.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Lunala often struggles to stay safe without Terastallizing, mainly due to Dark- and Ghost-type attacks from Incineroar, Chi-Yu, Lunala, and Calyrex-S. As such, it is not hard to force it to Terastallize. It can also struggle against Urshifu-R, ignoring the Defense boost with Surging Strikes and only being affected by Shadow Shield on the first hit.</li> <li>After Shadow Shield is broken, it can be quickly knocked out with strong neutral attacks such as Astral Barrage from Calyrex-S after Lunala has Terastallized, Electro Drift from Miraidon, and Flare Blitz from Koraidon.

Trick Room serves as a consistent speed control option thanks to Shadow Shield, allowing Lunala and its team to have more favorable matchups into faster-paced team compositions. Expanding Force is another choice when paired with Indeedee-F to deal consistent STAB spread damage, with Moonblast being a solid alternative for extra coverage against opposing Dark-types such as Chien-Pao, Grimmsnarl, and Urshifu-S.</li> <li>The bulk investment allows Lunala to survive Throat Chop from Chien-Pao and Astral Barrage from Calyrex-S with Shadow Shield active. The Speed investment is enough to still function both inside and outside of Trick Room; for example, it outspeeds threats like Rillaboom and maximum Speed Incineroar when Trick Room is not active while getting the jump on Urshifu when Trick Room is active. The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Attack.</li> <li>Tera Water provides a strong neutral typing while also giving it key resistances to powerful Fire- and Ice-type moves such as Koraidon's Tera Fire-boosted Flare Blitz and Calyrex-I's Glacial Lance. Tera Fairy acts as a strong alternative option, turning Lunala's Dark weakness into a resistance and increasing the damage of its Moonblasts, allowing it to pick up OHKOs on Pokemon such as Miraidon and Urshifu-R at +1.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Lunala mainly struggles against Dark- and Normal-type Pokemon like Terapagos, Ursaluna, and Incineroar that Lunala is unable to do reliable damage to if Meteor Beam has already been used. Grimmsnarl can also pose a major threat to Lunala, using Spirit Break and Light Screen to lower Lunala's already non-extraordinary damage while also potentially threatening huge damage if it has Foul Play. Farigiraf is especially an issue for Lunala, being able to tank a Meteor Beam and immune to Moongeist Beam. Farigiraf can also threaten good damage with Foul Play and deny Lunala of its Trick Room with a Trick Room of its own.</li> <li>Fighting-type Pokemon like Koraidon and Urshifu-R that also want a solid bulky partner serve as great teammates to cover for the Dark- and Normal-types that Lunala struggles with. Incineroar also works as a solid partner, providing Fake Out pressure to let Lunala set Trick Room or use Meteor Beam as well as Intimidate complementing Lunala's already superb bulk. Grimmsnarl also makes for a great partner for Lunala; setting up both Light Screen and Reflect to allow Lunala to stick on the field longer and fire off consistent damage with Moongeist Beam.</li> <li>Chi-Yu is another solid pair with Lunala, threatening opposing Ghost-types like Calyrex-S that Lunala could occasionally struggle against while having Beads of Ruin increasing Lunala's overall damage output. Indeedee-F also provides a lot of helpful tools for Lunala in the form of Follow Me, which redirects threatening attacks, and Psychic Terrain, which both blocks important priority moves in Trick Room like Sucker Punch and enables the use of Expanding Force.</li> </ul>"

Thanks to Choice Scarf, Miraidon can also easily outspeed opposing Miraidon and Raging Bolt and KO them with Draco Meteor. Koraidon is also able to deal with Dark-types but struggles a bit more into other Restricted Pokemon when Koraidon cannot move before its foes.</li> <li>Rillaboom is a great partner for Lunala, using Fake Out to disrupt foes to let Lunala freely set up and setting up Grassy Terrain, which not only overrides Miraidon's Terrain but also provides Lunala with even more passive recovery. Incineroar can also use Fake Out to support Lunala, with other options like Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp to better disrupt physical attackers.</li> <li>Other forms of damage reduction such as Grimmsnarl's dual screens and Volcarona's Struggle Bug can also help protect Lunala. The same goes for redirection support, with Pokemon like Ogerpon-C and the aforementioned Volcarona providing Lunala with a free turn to use Calm Mind.</li> <li>Incineroar highly benefits Lunala, as it threatens Calyrex-S with Knock Off, punishing it for trying to use Encore into Lunala, while resisting and mitigating the damage of many strong physical attackers, namely Calyrex-I, Chien-Pao, and Rillaboom.

    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Rillaboom can be used with basically anything, as a lot of Pokemon appreciate its supportive toolkit. However, the Pokemon that Rillaboom synergizes the most with are, as stated before, setup Pokemon. Setup Pokemon appreciate Fake Out and Grassy Terrain from Rillaboom; the former gives them space to set up, while the latter offers residual healing, increasing their survivability. Rillaboom also appreciates partners that can help against Fire-types, such as Incineroar, and Steel-types, such as Archaludon and Kingambit.</li> <li>Primarina and Sneasler are great partners for Rillaboom, as they help with the aforementioned checks, while Rillaboom can help against the Water-types that resist Primarina's Hyper Voice and double Sneasler's Speed by using Grassy Terrain to activate Grassy Seed, triggering Unburden. Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Volcarona are the main setup partners for Rillaboom; Kingambit scares away Incineroar, Gholdengo offers quick setup and spread damage, and Volcarona is able to KO the Grass-types that resist Wood Hammer.</li> <li>Rillaboom's main weakness is its typing. Grass may be good defensively because it lets Rillaboom switch in easily, but it is not great offensively in this metagame, as a plethora of Pokemon resist Wood Hammer such as Amoonguss, Gholdengo, Archaludon, Kingambit, and Incineroar. The main way around this is to utilize Rillaboom's support capabilities when it cannot offer anything offensively in the position and pivot intelligently. Sneasler is another big threat, as it has a faster Fake Out than Rillaboom and can threaten it with Dire Claw. Bulky redirectors, such as Magmar and Electabuzz, can take big hits from Sneasler for Rillaboom. Smart pivoting and chipping Sneasler down throughout the game are how Rillaboom is able to get rid of it.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Rillaboom's role is as a bulky support Pokemon that can still do great damage. Pivot with U-turn to cycle Fake Out, giving its partner free turns, and, when possible, nuke foes with powerful Wood Hammers and Grassy Glides.</li> <li>Rillaboom is usually a valuable part of the team throughout a game. In the beginning, Rillaboom is able to leverage Fake Out to allow its partner to set up early or get early damage off. Rillaboom usually pivots during the middle of the game to get more use out of Fake Out and get Grassy Terrain back on the field. Rillaboom chips down the opposing team throughout the game, but it excels at cleaning up in endgames thanks to its access to priority moves and high damage output.</li> <li>The biggest checks to Rillaboom are Pokemon that resist Grass. When playing against these Pokemon, it is important to pivot out with U-turn to preserve Rillaboom and allow it to get more value later in the game with its attacks. Additionally, partners such as the aforementioned Sneasler and Primarina can help against these Grass-resistant foes.</li> </ul>",

Rillaboom synergizes very well with setup Pokemon that appreciate the free turns that Fake Out provides as well as the healing from Grassy Terrain.</li> <li>Grassy Glide allows Rillaboom to take care of weakened foes, while Wood Hammer compensates for the low power of Grassy Glide to operate as a nuke. U-turn is usually the last move of choice on Rillaboom, as it allows one of its partners to come in safely while chipping down the foe, but Rillaboom can forgo it for High Horsepower, which allows Rillaboom to hit common Steel- and Fire-types such as Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Incineroar.</li> <li>Assault Vest is used on Rillaboom, as it enhances Rillaboom's ability to pivot, with the tradeoff being that it is unable to run status moves such as Protect and Taunt.</li> <li>Tera Fire gives Rillaboom an immunity to Will-O-Wisp and a resistance to common Fire- and Steel-type moves from Pokemon such as Incineroar, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Gholdengo.</li> <li>The Speed investment allows Rillaboom to outspeed maximum Speed Tyranitar and uninvested Annihilape, while the Attack investment allows Rillaboom to OHKO both Ursaluna formes with Wood Hammer.

Grassy Surge is able to power up its Grass-type attacks while giving its team passive recovery and Terrain control against Miraidon and Indeedee-F compositions. Its access to Fake Out and U-turn help partners set up and position safely. Its Grass-type STAB moves are valuable to hit the format's Water-types, such as Urshifu-R and Tera Water Calyrex-I.</li> <li>Rillaboom runs both Wood Hammer and Grassy Glide to give it access to both strong burst damage and a priority attack to pick off foes at low HP, such as Choice Scarf Urshifu and Calyrex-S. High Horsepower can also be run to hit Pokemon like Incineroar, Miraidon, and Raging Bolt, though it prefers to run U-turn to help the team position correctly and reset Fake Out pressure.</li> <li>Assault Vest patches up Rillaboom's mediocre Special Defense, allowing it to better take on special attackers such as Miraidon, Calyrex-S, and Kyogre. Its inability to use Protect is less relevant, as Rillaboom would often prefer to switch out when threatened in order to reset Fake Out pressure.</li> <li>The allocated bulk allows Rillaboom to survive Helping Hand Draco Meteor from Timid Choice Specs Miraidon in the Grassy Terrain or a +2 Astral Barrage from Life Orb or Tera Ghost Calyex-S. The Attack investment allows Rillaboom to OHKO bulky Flutter Mane with Wood Hammer.</li> <li>Tera Fire gives Rillaboom a resistance to the Ice and Fire-type attacks it was previously weak to, such as Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash, Calyrex-I's Glacial Lance, and Chi-Yu's Fire-type STAB moves. Tera Water gives similar defensive properties but doesn't leave Rillaboom weak to Calyrex-I's High Horsepower or Kyogre's Water-type STAB moves. In exchange, Tera Water Rillaboom gives up the immunity to getting burned and makes itself vulnerable against opposing Rillaboom.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Calyrex-I, Koraidon, Ogerpon-H, Chi-Yu, and Chien-Pao all threaten to OHKO Rillaboom with their respective Fire and Ice-type attacks.</li> <li>Rillaboom does not threaten Zamazenta-C or Zacian-C, while both threaten significant damage back.</li> <li>Incineroar and Urshifu-R commonly pair with Rillaboom to form a Fire / Water / Grass core on balance teams. Incineroar and Urshifu-R are strong into the likes of Calyrex-I, Ogerpon-H, Chi-Yu, and Chien-Pao.</li> <li>Calyrex-S and Terapagos appreciate Rillaboom's Fake Out support to allow them to set up, while Terapagos especially appreciates Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain recovery resetting Tera Shell. Calyrex-S can also remove opposing Koraidon.</li> <li>Zamazenta-C appreciates Rillaboom's ability to remove physically bulky Water-types such as Urshifu-R and Tera-Water Calyrex-I, and it can protect Rillaboom from Glacial Lance thanks to Wide Guard.

    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Hatterene is really only prominently used in Trick Room teams due to its extremely inflexible Speed stat. However, once Trick Room is set up, Hatterene is there to deal as much damage as possible. It may also set up Trick Room, which paves the way for fellow Trick Room sweepers such as Torkoal and Ursaluna to clean up the game.</p> </li> <li> <p>Indeedee-F serves as Hatterene's ideal partner, setting up Psychic Terrain to maximize the power of Expanding Force and make it into a spread move . It also provides redirection, allowing Hatterene to safely set up Trick Room while increasing Hatterene's survivability, and Helping Hand support to further accentuate Hatterene's damage output.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hatterene is heavily threatened by Steel-types such as Kingambit and Gholdengo, which can deal considerable damage to it and comfortably tank its attacks. Ursaluna complements Hatterene as a fellow Trick Room sweeper where its STAB Ground-type attacks such as Earthquake and Headlong Rush can cover for Hatterene’s weaknesses while Hatterene can switch into and threaten the Fighting-types that threaten Ursaluna. Torkoal is another partner that provides offensive support with its Fire-type STAB moves against Steel- and Grass-types such as Rillaboom, which can override Psychic Terrain but is highly threatened by Eruption, deterring switch-ins. Another partner is Gallade, as it provides Wide Guard support, which is valuable against Eruption and Make It Rain from Hisuian Typhlosion and Gholdengo, respectively. Gallade's Fighting-type STAB moves are favorable in covering for Hatterene's Steel weakness, as well as hitting Dark-types such as Kingambit and Incineroar.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li> <p>As a Trick Room sweeper, Hatterene ideally aims to set Trick Room and deal as much damage as possible. It works best when under Psychic Terrain, as it enables Expanding Force to deal its maximum potential output while protecting Hatterene from priority attacks such as Fake Out, Extreme Speed, and Sucker Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p>As a result of being a more reliable Trick Room setter than others, Hatterene works well early in the game, setting up Trick Room on the first turn ideally while Indeedee-F redirects attacks before sweeping with Expanding Force. It can also choose to be in the back and let Indeedee-F or Gallade set Trick Room, allowing Hatterene to clean up the endgame once Trick Room is set up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rillaboom is one of the most threatening Pokemon against Hatterene, as not only can it threaten Hatterene with Wood Hammer, but it can also override Psychic Terrain, allowing priority attacks like Fake Out to bypass Trick Room. This also severely cuts Hatterene’s Expanding Force damage, making it more difficult for Hatterene to remove Rillaboom. Ways to mitigate Rillaboom could be to add Torkoal, which can threaten Rillaboom with Eruption. Indeedee-F can set Psychic Terrain after Rillaboom in the first turn; it is also possible to keep Indeedee-F in the back and switch it in after Rillaboom has entered the field.</p> </li> </ul>",

Grimmsnarl can also be an annoying disruptor with Thunder Wave and sometimes Parting Shot. Setting up dual screens is very effective against hyper offensive teams using Koraidon and Calyrex-S, as these teams are normally quite frail, and surviving one extra attack can often be the difference maker in those matchups.</li> <li>Thunder Wave is a good option for disruption and speed control, allowing partners like Miraidon and Urshifu-R to outspeed Calyrex-S and Koraidon, while Parting Shot is good for further weakening foes and giving Grimmsnarl a strong pivoting option, which helps partners like Ho-Oh and Ursaluna activate their abilities of Regenerator and Guts, respectively, with less risk. Spirit Break OHKOes Koraidon before it Terastallizes, as well as being able to threaten both Urshifu formes, and it reduces the Special Attack of Pokemon such as Calyrex-S and Lunala. Foul Play allows Grimmsnarl to do significant damage to Calyrex-I, Calyrex-S, and Lunala.</li> <li>Light Clay allows Reflect and Light Screen to last longer, allowing for prolonged damage mitigation even after Grimmsnarl has fainted.</li> <li>The Special Defense investment allows Grimmsnarl to live a Moonblast from Timid Flutter Mane when Light Screen isn't up, and Grimmsnarl can also live a Choice Specs Miraidon Electro Drift when Light Screen is up.

Taunt from Incineroar and Flutter Mane can effectively shut down Grimmsnarl's supportive ability, leaving it stuck using either Spirit Break or Foul Play. Galarian Weezing's Neutralizing Gas prevents Grimmsnarl from getting its dual screens off immediately, allowing Koraidon, which is usually paired with Galarian Weezing, to easily OHKO it with Tera Fire Flare Blitz.</li> <li>Dark-, Electric-, and Ground-types like opposing Grimmsnarl, Incineroar, Miraidon, and Landorus are immune to Prankster Thunder Wave, reducing Grimmsnarl's effectiveness on the field. Fake Out from Rillaboom, Iron Hands, and Incineroar is also detrimental to Grimmsnarl, as it stops Grimmsnarl from supporting its team. Spore from Amoonguss and Brute Bonnet can make it difficult for Grimmsnarl to get both screens up in a game.</li> <li>Grimmsnarl's dual screens are able to support most teams, but Miraidon, Ho-Oh, Lunala, and Calyrex-I especially enjoy Grimmsnarl's support because they typically favor bulkier playstyles. Miraidon is able to quickly remove Urshifu-R while also protecting Grimmsnarl from Spore with Electric Terrain, and Ho-Oh is a great check for Koraidon, as it resists all of its moves and threatens an OHKO with Brave Bird. Incineroar and Iron Hands provide support with Fake Out, which makes it easier to get both screens up, and Urshifu-R can threaten Taunt Incineroar and other Dark- and Ground-types, which are immune to Thunder Wave, with Close Combat and Surging Strikes.</li> </ul>"

It sets up Psychic Terrain to prevent Fake Out from disturbing your team's Trick Room setup as well as preventing priority attacks from threatening its partners.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ursaluna and Ursaluna-B are common partners for Indeedee-F. Trick Room can help with the speed control both Ursaluna formes need, and Follow Me can protect them from non-spread moves while allowing them to deal Normal-type damage with Blood Moon and Facade and Ground-type damage with Headlong Rush, Earthquake, and Earth Power. Other Trick Room sweepers, such as Hatterene and Torkoal, are the best Trick Room partners for Indeedee-F. Hatterene can threaten the opponent's team with heavy Psychic-type damage from Expanding Force, and Torkoal can threaten heavy Fire-type damage with Eruption, Weather Ball, and Heat Wave. Gallade can threaten Dark-type Pokemon with Sacred Sword and provide Wide Guard support to protect its side of the field from spread moves. Sneasler pairs nicely with Indeedee-F because Sneasler can hold the Psychic Seed, activating its Unburden ability.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kingambit will decimate any opposing Indeedee-F. Even if Indeedee-F Terastallizes into a Fairy-type, Kingambit will still do significant amount of damage to it. Therefore, a Fighting-type Pokemon like Sneasler should be used to threaten Kingambit, as it can almost always guarantee a OHKO on Kingambit with Close Combat. Rillaboom is another threat to watch out for, as it can set up Grassy Terrain, which can override the Psychic Terrain that Indeedee-F sets up.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Indeedee-F is a support Pokemon. It redirects attacks with Follow Me, provides speed control with Trick Room, provides important chip damage with Psychic or Dazzling Gleam, and helps partners spam Expanding Force.</p> </li> <li> <p>Indeedee-F is best used early-game. As a lead, it is really good to get a head start at initializing your strategy. Sneasler, Ursaluna-B , and Ursaluna are all common Pokemon to lead alongside Indeedee-F. The Sneasler + Indeedee-F lead doesn't require Trick Room to be utilized and does not require any other setup. The Ursaluna-B + Indeedee-F lead does not have to be in Trick Room, depending on the Speed investment of Ursaluna-B, and it unleashes some of the largest amount of special damage in the metagame. Ursaluna and Indeedee-F have to be in Trick Room and need Ursaluna's Guts boost to be utilized thoroughly. However, this lead provides some of the largest amount of physical damage in the metagame.</p> </li> <li> <p>The biggest weakness Indeedee-F has to deal with is the move Taunt. Taunt prevents Indeedee-F from setting up Trick Room and doing its job as a supportive Pokemon. The most reliable way to get rid of Taunt is to switch Indeedee-F out. Sometimes, Indeedee-F has to rely on its ally to set up Trick Room instead. Because it is a Trick Room Pokemon, it is vulnerable to being double targeted, which prevents Trick Room from being set up. Fortunately, it has Follow Me, which can redirect non-spread moves to it, allowing its ally to set up Trick Room.</p> </li> </ul>",

Psychic Seed, although less common, is a good choice to help take on special attackers like the aforementioned Calyrex-S and Raging Bolt.</li> <li>If running a Trick Room team, a Relaxed Nature and 0 Speed IVs let Indeedee-F override Grassy Terrain against uninvested Rillaboom if both are sent on the field at the same time; it also lets Indeedee-F be as slow as possible for operating under Trick Room.</li> <li>Tera Water grants Indeedee-F a great defensive typing, helping it stomach moves such as Glacial Lance and Surging Strikes from Calyrex-I and Urshifu-R, respectively. Tera Fairy, on the other hand, most notably lets Indeedee-F resist Dark-types like Chi-Yu, Incineroar, and Chien-Pao. Although niche, Tera Fairy also boosts the power of Alluring Voice, letting it almost always OHKO Koraidon and securing the OHKO on Urshifu-S.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Indeedee-F is very vulnerable to Taunt from the likes of Incineroar and Flutter Mane, as it severely hinders Indeedee-F's supportive capabilities and stops it from redirecting attacks or setting up Trick Room.</li> <li>Without Terastallization available, Dark-type attacks like Wicked Blow from Urshifu and Dark Pulse from Chi-Yu threaten Indeedee-F with a potential OHKO. Chien-Pao in particular is a big threat to Indeedee-F, as it not only threatens Indeedee-F with Crunch, but it can also remove Psychic Terrain with Ice Spinner.</li> <li>Miraidon and Rillaboom are able to override Indeedee-F's Psychic Terrain with their own respective Terrains, forcing Indeedee-F to switch out if it wants to set up Psychic Terrain again.</li> <li>Packing multiple Trick Room setters like Calyrex-I and Lunala can ensure that Taunt won't shut down Trick Room altogether. Said Trick Room setters benefit from Indeedee-F's access to Follow Me and Trick Room, potentially setting up Trick Room for the aforementioned Restricted Pokemon and protecting them while they sweep via redirection.</li> <li>Partners such as the Urshifu formes and Zamazenta-C are able to threaten Dark-types with a KO with Close Combat and Body Press, respectively. Zamazenta-C is notably able to almost completely wall out Chien-Pao, unless it has Sacred Sword. Running Alluring Voice or using Whimsicott can also help with Dark-types to an extent. Indeedee-F can help these partners more easily achieve these KOs with Helping Hand, or it can protect its allies from faster threats with Follow Me.</li> <li>Calyrex-I is able to easily take out Miraidon and Rillaboom, which can be achieved even easier thanks to Indeedee-F's access to Trick Room and Helping Hand.</li> <li>Calyrex-S and Lunala highly appreciate Indeedee-F's assistance, enabling powerful Expanding Forces with Psychic Terrain whilst helping Calyrex-S set up with Nasty Plot and Lunala set up Trick Room, thanks to Follow Me. Lunala in particular appreciates Indeedee-F's ability to set Trick Room. In return, Calyrex-S and Lunala can KO powerful threats such as Koraidon, which can threaten Indeedee-F with an OHKO.</li> </ul>"

  "Dragapult": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Dragapult is a common attacker on balance teams with bulky redirectors, such as Electabuzz, Magmar, and Clefable. Redirectors are vital, since they assist in keeping Dragapult around for longer, which is especially important because Dragapult is frail and is weak to Sucker Punch from threats such as Kingambit. Additionally, Dragapult appreciates Fake Out support from the likes of Rillaboom, as it gives free turns for Dragapult to get extra attacks off, and it works nicely with Phantom Force, preventing a foe from attacking Dragapult after it lands the attack.</li> <li>Dragapult appreciates partners that can cover its weaknesses offensively or that can reliably switch into its checks; some examples are Sneasler and Primarina. Sneasler is a fast attacker that can outspeed and threaten Dark- and Fairy-types such as Incineroar, Kingambit, and Primarina. Primarina is a slower, bulkier attacker that can switch into attacks easier while still having the ability to OHKO threats such as Incineroar.</li> <li>Dark-types such as Kingambit and Incineroar are the biggest checks to Dragapult, as they can easily shrug off its attacks and threaten it with an OHKO. The aforementioned partners can help against these threats by threatening them and redirecting attacks, buying more time for Dragapult to switch out safely or overwhelm them with strong Dragon-type attacks. Tailwind teams can also be a big problem to Dragapult, as it relies on being faster than its foes and getting lots of damage off before they can move. Partners such as Rillaboom and Kingambit can help against Tailwind teams, since they can attack foes with strong priority moves, stall turns with smart pivoting, and, in Rillaboom's case, use Fake Out.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Dragapult is a sweeper, and it requires a lot of smart positioning to use it to its maximum potential. Dragapult shines in positions where its partners can support it either offensively by threatening its checks or defensively by aiding in its longevity. U-turn is a great tool in this regard, as it allows Dragapult to escape from tricky positions while doing chip damage to a foe.</li> <li>Dragapult utilizes Terastallization to get major damage on enemy Pokemon throughout the course of the game. Dragapult can be utilized early-game to get off powerful Tera Dragon Dragon Darts or Tera Blast Ghost, or it can be utilized late-game to clean the enemy team with Dragon Darts and Phantom Force.</li> <li>Dragapult's biggest weakness is Pokemon that resist its STAB attacks, such as Kingambit, Alolan Ninetales, and Incineroar. Dragapult utilizes its partners to help against these threats until they are weakened to a point where Dragapult can finish them off. Priority attacks such as Sucker Punch from Kingambit and forms of speed control, such as Tailwind and Trick Room, are threatening to Dragapult, as it is frail and relies on its high damage output and outspeeding foes. Against priority attacks, Dragapult pivots partners in or utilizes an ally with redirection to take the attacks for it. Against Tailwind and Trick Room teams, Dragapult again uses smart pivots and defensive tools such as Follow Me and Fake Out to stall out turns of Trick Room, allowing it to clean up late-game.</li> </ul>",

        "description": "<ul> <li>Dragapult uses its powerful STAB attacks, phenomenal Speed, and solid Attack stat to outrun almost every Pokemon in the game and deal massive damage to the opposing team.</li> <li>Dragon Darts is great at consistently chipping down the opposing team. Phantom Force is Dragapult's strongest Ghost-type STAB move that can also shatter Protect, but it allows foes to switch due to its charging turn. Tera Dragon sets prefer Outrage to nuke foes, albeit inconsistently. On the other hand, Tera Blast Ghost is a reliable one-turn Ghost-type STAB move. U-turn allows Dragapult to get chip damage on foes and pivot out of tricky matchups while dealing respectable damage to threats such as Rillaboom.</li> <li>Choice Band boosts Dragapult's Attack stat to great levels, which pairs excellently with its high Speed.</li> <li>Tera Dragon allows Dragapult to OHKO Garchomp and Hydreigon with one hit from Dragon Darts and Incineroar, Electabuzz, and Magmar with Outrage. Additionally, Tera Dragon removes Dragapult's weakness to Sucker Punch from Kingambit. Tera Ghost is used, since it gives Dragapult a consistent physical Ghost-type attack in Tera Blast Ghost while also allowing it to OHKO Volcarona and Primarina with Phantom Force.</li> <li>An Adamant nature allows Dragapult to always OHKO Volcarona with Outrage and almost always OHKO a Terastallized Hisuian Typhlosion with Phantom Force. A Jolly nature allows Dragapult to outspeed Jolly Talonflame, Adamant Choice Scarf Basculegion-M, and opposing Adamant Dragapult.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Zacian-C has a unique niche in Regulation I thanks to its blistering Speed and excellent typing, allowing Zacian-C to threaten OHKOs on metagame staples like Miraidon, Koraidon, and Grimmsnarl.</li> <li>Swords Dance is in Zacian-C's standard moveset, as it allows Zacian-C to boost its Attack faster than Incineroar's Intimidate would drop it and ensures Zacian-C remains a threat. Sacred Sword can be used instead to score 2HKOs on Zamazenta-C and Incineroar, which Zacian-C otherwise struggles to handle. Substitute is a good alternative, as it provides a superior matchup against Will-O-Wisp Incineroar and maintains momentum by protecting Zacian-C from being flinched by Fake Out. Thanks to Zacian-C's Speed, Substitute can also act as a secondary form of Protect and help Zacian-C scout opposing Protect and Terastallization, such as Tera Fairy Miraidon.</li> <li>The EV spread ensures Zacian-C survives Flare Blitz from Life Orb Koraidon and Guts-boosted Headlong Rush from Ursaluna after Terastallization, as well as surviving Volt Switch from Choice Specs Miraidon and avoiding the 2HKO from Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage. The Speed investment allows Zacian-C to outspeed base 135s like Chien-Pao, Koraidon, and Miraidon. Finally, the Attack investment picks up an OHKO on Grimmsnarl behind Reflect with a Behemoth Blade.</li> <li>Tera Fairy is an incredibly consistent Tera type, ​as it sheds Zacian-C's weaknesses and bolsters its damage output, achieving feats such as OHKOing maximum HP Miraidon with Play Rough at +0 Attack.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Zacian-C especially struggles with Incineroar, as it can mitigate Zacian-C's damage output in various ways. Volcarona and Ogerpon-H are other problematic Pokemon, as they redirect and resist Zacian-C's STAB moves; Volcarona possesses the potential to permanently cripple Zacian-C with Flame Body, while Ogerpon-H threatens to OHKO with Tera Fire Ivy Cudgel.</li> <li>Calyrex-S is an issue, as a lot of Zacian-C's viability comes from its Speed tier, so Calyrex-S compositions will have a much easier time supporting Calyrex-S and countering Zacian-C than vice versa. Zamazenta-C is difficult for Zacian-C without Sacred Sword, as Zamazenta-C comfortably wins one-on-one.</li> <li>Kyogre and Urshifu-R are exceptional partners, as they blast all the Fire-types that frustrate Zacian-C. In return, Zacian-C can threaten the problematic Dragon-types like Raging Bolt, Koraidon, and Miraidon. Kyogre helps Zacian-C further by negating its weakness to Fire-type moves through setting up rain.</li> <li>Amoonguss and Incineroar are useful partners, as they can help Zacian-C set up safely. Incineroar can greatly aid with Calyrex-S and Ogerpon-H, pressuring them with its STAB attacks and Parting Shot. Amoonguss makes Zamazenta-C far easier to take on and can shut down Incineroar that aren't holding Safety Goggles with Spore and Rage Powder.</li> <li>Chien-Pao and Landorus form great offensive synergies with Zacian-C. Chien-Pao increases Zacian-C's damage output with Sword of Ruin and pressures Calyrex-S before it can move with Sucker Punch. With Sword of Ruin, Zacian-C can OHKO bulky Kyogre with Tera Fairy Play Rough and almost always 2HKOes Zamazenta-C at neutral Attack. Chien-Pao notably threatens Rillaboom and Amoonguss, meaning it also synergizes with other common Zacian-C partners. Landorus has more direct synergy, as it can threaten OHKOs on Incineroar, Zamazenta-C, and Ogerpon-H and provides a safer Miraidon endgame as a Ground-type. Both Pokemon help force pins on Miraidon and Raging Bolt, as Zacian-C can cover for Tera Fairy.</li> </ul>"

It can do great damage with Body Press and protect its allies well from Pokemon such as Calyrex-S, Chi-Yu, Miraidon, Kyogre and Terapagos-S with Wide Guard. It can also wall common threats such as Chien-Pao, Rillaboom, and Ogerpon-C.</li> <li>Behemoth Bash is a consistent damage choice for Zamazenta-C, as it can do good damage to Calyrex-I and Tera Fairy Miraidon and Raging Bolt. Heavy Slam does more damage against the general metagame but doesn't do much to the aforementioned Pokemon.</li> <li>The EV spread allows it to outspeed maximum speed Landorus. It also lets Zamazenta-C live Close Combat from Life Orb Koraidon.</li> <li>Tera Dragon switches all of Zamazenta-C's weaknesses to neutralities or resistances, and the added resistsances can be very useful against the likes of Koraidon, Miraidon, Urshifu-R, and Kyogre.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Zamazenta-C can struggle with Koraidon, which can do massive damage to it. Electric Seed Lunala sets can wall Zamazenta-C and do respectable damage with Moongeist Beam. Ho-Oh resists both of Zamazenta-C's STAB moves, can do good damage and burn it with Sacred Fire, and sets up Tailwind. Amoonguss can also cause Zamazenta-C trouble, since Amoonguss doesn't take much damage from it and can threaten back with Spore or redirect Zamazenta-C's attacks. Landorus can OHKO Zamazenta-C with Earth Power if it has Life Orb or outspeed it and do massive damage with Choice Scarf while resisting Body Press. Volcarona can also check Zamazenta-C incredibly well by resisting both of its STAB moves and having a chance to burn Zamazenta-C, heavily reducing its offensive capabilities.</li> <li>Calyrex-S is the most common Restricted Pokemon pairing with Zamazenta-C. Together, they have amazing coverage, and Zamazenta-C can protect it from opposing Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage with Wide Guard. Calyrex-S also deals with Koraidon and Amoonguss with Psychic. Miraidon can also be a strong partner for Zamazenta-C by doing incredible damage to a ton of its checks, such as Ho-Oh, Koraidon, and Amoonguss, and taking advantage of its defensive capabilities, with Zamazenta-C being a good partner to pivot to with Volt Switch. Chien-Pao works really well with Zamazenta-C, since it boosts Body Press's damage, allowing Zamazenta-C to OHKO Pokemon like Terapagos-S and Incineroar, and deals well with most of its checks, hitting Koraidon, Lunala, Amoonguss, and Landorus hard. Another common partner is Rillaboom, setting its Terrain to give Zamazenta-C even more survivability with its healing and allow it to survive Choice Specs Electro Drift from Miraidon.</li> </ul>"

Covert Cloak provides Urshifu-S with a strong matchup against Calyrex-S and Terapagos team compositions featuring dual Fake Out cores.</li> <li>Covert Cloak sets use an EV spread of 132 HP / 236 Atk / 4 Def / 76 SpD / 60 Spe with and Adamant nature.

Koraidon and Zamazenta-C outspeed and easily KO Urshifu-S with Collision Course and Body Press after its Focus Sash has been broken. Meanwhile, Urshifu-R and Iron Hands can survive Urshifu-S's attacks and KO it in return with Close Combat and Drain Punch, respectively.</li> <li>Incineroar is threatening, since Urshifu-S struggles to remove it before its damage output is hindered by Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp.</li> <li>A partner Miraidon threatens opposing Miraidon, Raging Bolt, and Koraidon with Draco Meteor and Dazzling Gleam, as well as dealing good damage with Electro Drift to them and Incineroar after they Terastallize.</li> <li>Calyrex-I survives Electro Drift, Draco Meteor, and Thunderbolt from Miraidon and Raging Bolt and easily KOes them alongside Koraidon with Glacial Lance.

Additionally, U-turn can be used to play around defensive Terastallization from Pokemon like Calyrex-I, Lunala, and Farigiraf.</li> <li>While Choice Band does have the obvious downside of locking Urshifu-S into a move, its newfound ability to OHKO Calyrex-I and Lunala with Wicked Blow, alongside its generally higher damage output, allows it to be much more threatening.</li> <li>Urshifu-S should use either a Brave Nature with 252 HP and Attack EVs or an Adamant Nature with 252 Attack and Speed EVs depending on if it is being used on a team that focuses on Trick Room or not. Trick Room teams should run 0 IVs in Speed, while teams not utilizing Trick Room should use 31 IVs in Speed.</li> <li>Tera Grass is the most common Tera type, as it allows Urshifu-S to avoid Rage Powder and Spore from opposing Pokemon like Volcarona and Amoonguss, respectively.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Choice Band Urshifu-S is weak to Fighting-types like Urshifu-R, Iron Hands, and Zamazenta-C, as they can all survive Urshifu's Close Combat and OHKO it back. However, Urshifu-S can OHKO Zamazenta-C with Close Combat if its Dauntless Shield boost is no longer active.</li> <li>Choice Band Urshifu-S is also susceptible to opposing Pokemon's use of Terastallization, as Pokemon like Calyrex-I and Lunala can use a defensive Tera type to survive a hit from Urshifu-S. Lunala is especially scary for Urshifu-S in these scenarios, as it can sometimes run Tera Fairy and Moonblast to survive a hit and OHKO Urshifu-S in return.</li> <li>Choice Band Urshifu-S is strongest on Trick Room teams that feature Restricted Pokemon like Lunala and Calyrex-I, as those teams can use it to threaten OHKOs on Pokemon like Calyrex-I, Calyrex-S, and Lunala. Lunala and Calyrex-I can assist Urshifu-S in return by setting up Trick Room and allowing it to move before Pokemon like Chi-Yu and Zamazenta-C.</li> <li>Another good teammate for Urshifu-S is Indeedee-F, as it appreciates Urshifu-S's ability to threaten Ursaluna before Trick Room goes up.

Urshifu-R has especially strong matchups against Incineroar, Chi-Yu, Chien-Pao, and Terapagos.</li> <li>U-turn allows Urshifu-R to reposition while dealing chip damage to threats such as Rillaboom. Aqua Jet allows Urshifu-R to pick off faster foes at low HP. Coaching can be used to boost the Attack and Defense of teammates, usually Calyrex-I.

Miraidon's Draco Meteor can quickly remove the Dragon-types such as Raging Bolt and Koraidon that resists Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes.</li> <li>Rillaboom and Incineroar work well with Urshifu-R, as Fake Out and pivoting moves create opportunities for Urshifu-R to safety switch in without breaking Focus Sash, and their typing allows them to tank moves that Urshifu-R would be threatened by, such as Wood Hammer from Rillaboom, Psychic from Calyrex-S, and Electro Drift from Miraidon. Incineroar also threatens sizable damage towards Psychic-types like Indeedee-F and Lunala with Knock Off. Rillaboom helps reduce Miraidon's damage output by removing Electric Terrain while also being able to threaten Fake Out.</li> </ul>"

      "Mystic Water": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Mystic Water Urshifu-R is a highly versatile and offensive Pokemon that performs well against foes like Terapagos, Incineroar, and Chien-Pao by threatening them all with Surging Strikes and Close Combat.</li> <li>Taunt prevents Trick Room from foes like Calyrex-I and Lunala, setup from Volcarona and Terapagos, and moves like Rage Powder and Spore from Pokemon like Volcarona and Amoonguss. Aqua Jet is also a great option to finish off weakened foes and deal chip damage before Urshifu-R faints.</li> <li>Mystic Water gives Urshifu-R the ability to OHKO Pokemon it otherwise could not, such as Chien-Pao, Incineroar, and bulky Flutter Mane with Surging Strikes.</li> <li>The EV spread lets it take Life Orb-boosted Astral Barrage from Calyrex-S, Life Orb-boosted Earth Power from Landorus, Horn Leech from Ogerpon-C, Sword of Ruin-boosted Body Press from Zamazenta-C, and Sword of Ruin-boosted Grassy Glide from Rillaboom. The Speed EVs let it outpace Pokemon like Miradon and Chien-Pao after a Speed drop.</li> <li>Tera Water functions as both an offensive and defensive Tera type by removing its Psychic, Fairy, and Flying weaknesses while also boosting its Water-type moves to let Urshifu-R OHKO Calyrex-S and most Grimmsnarl with Surging Strikes as well as Chi-Yu with Aqua Jet.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Urshifu-R struggles against Restricted Pokemon like Koraidon, which weakens Surging Strikes by setting sun. It also has a hard time versus Miraidon, which can outspeed and threaten an OHKO with Volt Switch or Electro Drift.</li> <li>Non-Restricted Pokemon that can take Urshifu-R's attacks like Iron Hands, Raging Bolt, and Rillaboom, which also threaten Urshifu-R before and after Terastallization, are very effective against it as well. Amoonguss can redirect and easily survive Urshifu-R's attacks and punish Surging Strikes if Amoonguss is holding a Rocky Helmet. Ogerpon-H and -C pose an offensive threat to Urshifu-R with potential OHKOs using Wood Hammer or Power Whip.</li> <li>Urshifu-R heavily benefits from Tailwind, making setters like Whimsicott and Tornadus great partners. Tornadus also provides Rain Dance to boost its Water-type attacks significantly, while Whimsicott can provide Light Screen support, which lets Urshifu-R survive attacks such as a Protosynthesis-boosted Thunderclap from Raging Bolt and Flutter Mane's Moonblast.</li> <li>Miraidon is a strong Restricted partner for Urshifu-R, as it prevents Spore from Amoonguss and can threaten Water- and Dragon-type foes that Urshifu-R struggles to damage, like Koraidon and opposing Urshifu-R. Urshifu-R also supports Miraidon by helping against Ground-types like Ursaluna and Landorus.</li> <li>Calyrex-I and Lunala are also strong Restricted partners for Urshifu-R because they can set Trick Room to provide another form of speed control. Calyrex-I also helps cover Miraidon by threatening it with powerful Ground- and Ghost-type coverage, while Urshifu-R supports them by checking Incineroar.</li> <li>Kyogre benefits Urshifu-R by setting rain, increasing the power of its Water-type moves.</li> <li>Chien-Pao boosts Urshifu-R’s attacks with Sword of Ruin, allowing it to OHKO Ogerpon-H with Surging Strikes while also threatening Miraidon, Raging Bolt, and Rillaboom with Ice Spinner or Icicle Crash.</li> <li>Balance staples like Rillaboom and Incineroar also support Urshifu-R, as they can pivot into attacks Urshifu-R would rather avoid and provide Fake Out pressure that synergizes well with Unseen Fist.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Calyrex-I is a physical attacker that uses its incredible bulk and high Attack to threaten the high number of Grass- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Miraidon, Koraidon, Rillaboom, Amoonguss, and Raging Bolt that could be problematic for its teammates. Calyex-I also works well in Trick Room thanks to its low Speed and access to the move.</li> <li>Leech Seed allows Calyrex-I to work better into Pokemon that resist Glacial Lance such as Zamazenta-C while also giving it more of a staying presence because of the HP recovery. High Horsepower threatens Incineroar and Zamazenta-C, which resist Glacial Lance. Both moves help into Zamazenta-C; Leech Seed tries to stall out Zamazenta-C's health, while High Horsepower punishes Wide Guard.</li> <li>Leftovers is ran with Leech Seed to allow Calyrex-I to recover even more of its HP after each turn, while Clear Amulet sets allow Calyrex-I to be unhindered by Intimidate and Parting Shot from Incineroar.</li> <li>The Special Defense and HP investment let Calyrex-I survive Electro Drift from Choice Specs Miraidon while Electric Terrain is active. Calyrex-I can sometimes opt to run less Special Defense in order to invest more into Attack on Clear Amulet sets, but this comes at the cost of worse rolls into Choice Specs Miraidon and Life Orb Calyrex-S. The increased Attack investment allows Calyrex-I to threaten Koraidon with an OHKO if it doesn't Terastalize.</li> <li>Tera Water allows Calyrex-I to resist Water- and Fire-type moves that would previously threaten it such as Water Spout from Kyogre and Flare Blitz from Koraidon. Tera Fire gives Calyrex-I a resistance to the previously mentioned Fire-type attacks while also making it immune to Will-O-Wisp from Incineroar, though it makes Calyrex-I worse into Urshifu-R because Surging Strikes threatens it after Terastallizing and common Urshifu-R partners like Calyrex-S threaten Calyrex-I before Terastallizing. Both Tera types help into Zacian-C and Zamazenta-C, as they allow Calyrex-I to resist Steel-type attacks from the aforementioned foes.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Calyrex-I struggles against bulkier Pokemon such as Grimmsnarl, Terastallized Amoonguss, and Incineroar that aren't immediately threatened by Glacial Lance and can annoy Calyrex-I with Reflect, Spore, or Will-O-Wisp if it isn't Tera Fire. Offensive Pokemon such as Calyrex-S and Miraidon can also be problematic, as they threaten huge damage against Calyrex-I.</li> <li>Miraidon pairs very well with Calyrex-I, as it threatens the bulkier Pokemon that Calyrex-I struggles with and denies Spore from Amoonguss and Brute Bonnet, while Calyrex-I threatens the Grass-, Ground-, and Dragon-type Pokemon that resist Miraidon's Electric-type attacks. Calyrex-I also discourages Rillaboom, a common check to Miraidon. Kyogre is another good Restricted Pokemon to pair with Calyrex-I. Kyogre threatens Incineroar with its Water-type attacks and works well in the Trick Room that Calyrex-I sets up. The rain set up by Kyogre weakens Koraidon, which makes Calyrex-I harder to remove. Calyrex-I threatens Pokemon that resist Kyogre's Water-type attacks like Rillaboom and Raging Bolt.</li> <li>Grimmsnarl sets Light Screen and Reflect for Calyrex-I, boosting its defenses even further and making Leech Seed recovery more effective. Urshifu-R is another good partner, bypassing Protect from Pokemon that try to stall out Trick Room turns. Iron Hands and Farigiraf both pair well with Miraidon, Calyrex-I's main Restricted Pokemon partner, and work well in Calyrex-I's Trick Room.</li> </ul>"

Disable, on the other hand, is useful to shut down powerful moves that can easily stop Calyrex-S, most notably Wide Guard from the likes of Lunala and Zamazenta-C. Nasty Plot can boost Calyrex-S's sweeping power, letting it OHKO Assault Vest Iron Hands with Psychic. Encore and Disable help Terapagos in particular, helping it to set up even in the face of threatening Fighting-types like Urshifu-R and Koraidon.</li> <li>Focus Sash increases Calyrex-S's survivability, allowing it to survive the many attacks that can OHKO it such as Moongeist Beam from Lunala and Electro Drift from Miraidon. Calyrex-S will be able to hit hard, live an attack, and then retaliate.</li> <li>Tera Ghost boosts the power of Astral Barrage, letting Calyrex-S always OHKO Tera Ghost Incineroar and Ursaluna while also OHKOing Lunala most of the time.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Dark-types like Incineroar and Chi-Yu are issues for Calyrex-S, as Calyrex-S has no good way of breaking through them. Farigiraf is another struggle for Calyrex-S thanks to Farigiraf's immunity to Astral Barrage and access to Foul Play. Even with Disable, Zamazenta-C and Lunala are still bothersome for Calyrex-S, with both using Wide Guard and Lunala in particular threatening huge damage into Calyrex-S with Moongeist Beam. Urshifu-R can threaten Calyrex-S, using Tera Water or Tera Stellar to OHKO Calyrex-S with Surging Strikes.</li> <li>Fighting-type Pokemon such as Urshifu-R and Zamazenta-C are great partners for Calyrex-S, providing good coverage into Dark-types while threatening opposing Zamazenta-C, letting Calyrex-S more freely use Astral Barrage. Calyrex-S is able to help these Fighting-type Pokemon by using Astral Barrage to break through Ghost-types like Flutter Mane.</li> <li>Dark-type Pokemon like Chi-Yu and Incineroar are able to break down Farigiraf and Lunala with Dark Pulse and Knock Off, respectively. Chi-Yu has the added benefit of threatening Zamazenta-C thanks to Overheat. Additionally, Chi-Yu's Beads of Ruins allows Calyrex-S to OHKO bulky Calyrex-I with Tera Ghost Astral Barrage and 2HKO Zamazenta-C with Psychic or Astral Barrage. Calyrex-S, in return, can threaten Pokemon like Iron Hands and Urshifu-R, which normally scare off the aforementioned Dark-types.</li> <li>Terapagos and Koraidon both heavily appreciate Focus Sash Calyrex-S's presence, as it threatens Fighting-types for Terapagos and helps out into Ghost-types for Koraidon. With Disable, Calyrex-S can also deny Wide Guard from the likes of Lunala, letting Terapagos freely Terastallize and use Tera Starstorm. This, in conjunction with Encore, can force the Wide Guard user to use Struggle. In return, Terapagos is able to be a reliable switch-in for Ghost-type attacks that heavily threaten Calyrex-S. Koraidon, on the other hand, is able to chunk many threats to Calyrex-S such as Lunala, Zamazenta-C, and Farigiraf, helping create openings for Calyrex-S to sweep.</li> <li>Rillaboom is a good partner to threaten Urshifu-R while also providing Fake Out support. Rillaboom can also use U-turn to chip down Lunala and Farigiraf, notably breaking Lunala's Shadow Shield.</li> </ul>"

      "Setup Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Calyrex-S is an excellent sweeper, taking advantage of its high Speed and Special Attack coupled with a powerful spread move in Astral Barrage. Calyrex-S is often oppressive because it pressures Pokemon like Koraidon, both Calyrex formes, and Amoonguss to Terastallize to survive its STAB moves and threatens to snowball through teams if allowed to set up with Nasty Plot.</li> <li>On more offensive compositions, such as those with Miraidon and Chi-Yu, Encore can be opted for over Nasty Plot to punish defensive archetypes with Pokemon like Calm Mind Terapagos by discouraging setup.</li> <li>The damage boost from Life Orb is important for securing OHKOs on certain Pokemon such as Koraidon and Amoonguss with Psychic and non-Assault Vest Miraidon and Raging Bolt with Astral Barrage after a Nasty Plot.</li> <li>The Defense investment allows Calyrex-S to survive Tera Fire Flame Charge from Koraidon in the sun and almost always survive Tera Water Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R. Max Speed and a Timid nature are important for at least guaranteeing a Speed tie against opposing Calyrex-S and, by extension, outrunning Chien-Pao, Miraidon, and Koraidon. The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack to maximize its damage output.</li> <li>Tera Dark grants Calyrex-S a resistance to Dark- and Ghost-type moves, which is helpful for Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch, Lunala's Moongeist Beam, Incineroar's Knock Off, and opposing Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Many common Pokemon have Ghost- or Dark-type moves that force Calyrex-S to Terastallize, including aforementioned threats like Chien-Pao, Incineroar, and Calyrex-S, as well as others like Miraidon with Snarl and Chi-Yu with both Snarl and Dark Pulse.</li> <li>Choice Scarf Chi-Yu is a major problem because it can outspeed and OHKO Calyrex-S with Dark Pulse or threaten significant damage with Overheat. In sun, Flutter Mane is also a threat because it outspeeds Calyrex-S and can OHKO it with Shadow Ball or Moonblast after Calyrex-S Terastallizes.</li> <li>Farigiraf is problematic because Calyrex-S can't deal much damage to it, while Farigiraf can set up Trick Room, which Calyrex-S struggles to operate under. Grimmsnarl can wall Calyrex-S and set up Light Screen to weaken its damage output while also being able to slow Calyrex-S down with Thunder Wave. Brute Bonnet can easily tank Calyrex-S's attacks and threaten it with Sucker Punch or put it to sleep with Spore.</li> <li>Pokemon with Wide Guard like Zamazenta-C and Lunala prevent Calyrex-S from sweeping with Astral Barrage.</li> <li>Incineroar and Rillaboom are great partners for Calyrex-S, as they provide Fake Out utility that helps it set up. Additionally, Incineroar can reduce foes' damage output with Intimidate and Parting Shot, while Rillaboom can help Calyrex-S withstand Miraidon's attacks by overriding its Terrain.</li> <li>Zamazenta-C is the most common Restricted Pokemon paired with this set because, with Body Press, it threatens Dark- and Normal-types that Calyrex-S struggle to hit like Terapagos, Incineroar, and Brute Bonnet. It also blocks spread moves with Wide Guard, protecting Calyrex-S against moves like Astral Barrage from opposing Calyrex-S, Glacial Lance from Calyrex-I, Heat Wave and Snarl from Chi-Yu, and Water Spout and Origin Pulse from Kyogre.</li> <li>Miraidon is a solid Restricted partner for this set, as both it and Calyrex-S apply fast offensive pressure. Typically, with Chi-Yu on the team boosting their damage, the two special wallbreakers can immediately overwhelm teams.</li> <li>Urshifu-R can also threaten the aforementioned Dark- and Normal-types with Close Combat and Incineroar and Chi-Yu with Surging Strikes. Choice Scarf Urshifu-R can outspeed and deal massive damage to opposing Calyrex-S. Additionally, it can break Chien-Pao's Focus Sash, allowing Calyrex-S to finish it off and receive the Grim Neigh boost.</li> <li>Amoonguss and Ogerpon-H protect Calyrex-S by redirecting attacks with Rage Powder and Follow Me, respectively. Amoonguss can help against Trick Room teams by outspeeding Pokemon like Calyrex-I in Trick Room and putting them to sleep with Spore. Additionally, Amoonguss can redirect Thunder Wave from Grimmsnarl, which isn't as much of an issue for Amoonguss because it is naturally slow. Ogerpon-H can safely redirect Spore from Brute Bonnet and Amoonguss as well as pressure both with Ivy Cudgel.</li> </ul>"

  "Ursaluna": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Ursaluna mandates Trick Room support, as without it, it is very vulnerable to the vast majority of attackers, which are faster than it. Therefore, tactics that virtually guarantee that Trick Room gets set up are good for Ursaluna teams. Redirection also enables Ursaluna to throw out its powerful attacks.</li> <li>Porygon2 is an excellent partner to Ursaluna, as it can leverage its bulk and Recover to set up Trick Room multiple times in a battle; this lets Ursaluna be a threat throughout the game. It also provides special offense to complement Ursaluna's physical offense. Incineroar is great with Porygon2, as its Fake Out makes it easier for Porygon2 to set up Trick Room, which benefits Ursaluna because it wants Trick Room to be set up. Incineroar can also safely bring in Ursaluna with Parting Shot or U-turn.</li> <li>Ursaluna also fits on Psychic-type spam teams. These teams use Indeedee-F, which has both Follow Me and Trick Room, to enable attackers that can also set up Trick Room like Hatterene and Armarouge. Not only do these teams reliably set up Trick Room, but they also provide powerful special offense to pair with Ursaluna's powerful physical offense.</li> <li>Gholdengo is a common sight on Ursaluna teams, as it handles Archaludon and Fighting-types that scare Ursaluna. Amoonguss fits well on Trick Room teams, as its Rage Powder lets Porygon2 set up Trick Room and Ursaluna attack more freely, and its Spore lets it shut down one foe so that the Ursaluna can target the other more freely. Amoonguss also supports Ursaluna by extending its longevity with Pollen Puff.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Ursaluna is a Trick Room sweeper, and it wants to be positioned on the field such that it can throw out its attacks with as many turns of Trick Room as possible. Getting Trick Room up is a major priority for Ursaluna's teams, so tactics that disrupt this, including Fake Out, Taunt, Imprison, and Trick Room, give more room to deal with the mighty bear.</li> <li>Ursaluna is not concerned with the battle state as long as Trick Room is set; if it is, then Ursaluna provides the most value when using with Facade or Headlong Rush. However, Ursaluna itself doesn't help its partner set up Trick Room, so it is less advisable to lead Ursaluna if the opposing team has the means to disrupt Trick Room. Despite this, Ursaluna wants to enter the battle with as many turns of Trick Room as possible, so aggressive switching or switch moves can be utilized to maximize Ursaluna's threat potential.</li> <li>Rain teams threaten to overwhelm Ursaluna with their boosted Water-type attacks, so weather of its own from the likes of Torkoal and Tyranitar is very useful; alternatively, if Trick Room is set up, Ursaluna can simply run them over itself. Grassy Glide from Rillaboom bypasses Trick Room and threatens Ursaluna greatly; Terrain support or redirection from Indeedee-F neutralizes this threat. Intimidate cycling will weaken Ursaluna greatly, but if it is behind a Substitute, it does not need to fear it. Fighting-types like Sneasler and Gallade are problematic for Ursaluna, but redirection from the likes of Amoonguss and Terastallizing Ghost can mitigate them. Corviknight completely walls Ursaluna's STAB moves, so Ursaluna is reliant on teammates to weaken Corviknight so that it can be dealt with. Certain Pokemon such as Torkoal and Hatterene move before Ursaluna in Trick Room, so they can push damage into Ursaluna before it can respond; however, these are usually only seen on opposing Trick Room teams.</li> </ul>",

      "Guts": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Ursaluna is a destructively powerful Trick Room attacker that doesn't fear Amoonguss's Spore. It takes advantage of Guts, Flame Orb, and Facade to delete bulky foes like Garchomp, Rillaboom, and Hatterene.</li> <li>Earthquake is a powerful spread move that threatens both foes, bypassing redirection, but it requires teammates to either be immune to Ground or use Protect in order for it to be used safely. Meanwhile, Substitute takes advantage of foes that try and use Protect to passively let Ursaluna wear itself out with burn chip damage and stall out Trick Room turns; it will also block Intimidate once it has been set up.</li> <li>Flame Orb activates Guts and boosts the power of Facade. One side benefit of getting burned is that Ursaluna won't be put to sleep by Amoonguss's Spore and Vivillon's Sleep Powder.</li> <li>Tera Ghost allows Ursaluna to become immune to Fighting-type attacks and Fake Out; the latter is important because it would otherwise deny Ursaluna from attacking in Trick Room. Tera Fairy also sheds Ursaluna's weakness to Fighting while letting it beat Dragon-types like Dragapult and Archaludon. Tera Normal powers up Facade even further, allowing it to turn 2HKOs or unfavorable OHKO chances on the likes of Amoonguss, Electabuzz, Clefable, Ursaluna, and Ursaluna-B into guaranteed OHKOs.</li> <li>The given EV spread allows Ursaluna to survive a Life Orb Ursaluna-B's Blood Moon, a +1 Draco Meteor from Archaludon, or a Make it Rain from Choice Specs Gholdengo and the burn damage right after while maximizing its Attack.</li> </ul>"

      "Trick Room Sweeper": {
        "outdated": true,
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Ursaluna is one of the strongest non-Restricted physical sweepers in Regulation I, as it has an enormous Attack stat further bolstered by its ability. Ursaluna finds its place in the metagame as a powerful physical wallbreaker that is able to sweep under Trick Room. With its powerful STAB moves, it is able to OHKO many important Pokemon in the format, such as Miraidon, Koraidon, and Rillaboom, while outspeeding them under Trick Room.</li> <li>While Ursaluna is burned, and with maximum Attack and a Brave nature, Facade picks up OHKOs on almost all Koraidon, Miraidon, and Rillaboom, and it can OHKO Ho-Oh with a high roll. It can also 2HKO Calyrex-I and Iron Hands. Ursaluna's HP EVs are optimized to reduce burn chip damage. The Defense investment gives it a high chance to live Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R, and the remaining EVs in Special Defense give Ursaluna a high chance to avoid the 2HKO from Tera Stellar Terapagos-S's Tera Starstorm with two turns of burn damage.</li> <li>Headlong Rush and Earthquake are strong Ground-type STAB moves that allow Ursaluna to hit Ghost- and Steel-types that it struggles to hit with Facade. Although Headlong Rush makes Ursaluna more vulnerable to foes' attacks, it's necessary to pick up OHKOs on Calyrex-S and Iron Hands. Earthquake is a powerful spread option, doing significant damage to Miraidon and Koraidon, OHKOing Miraidon without Tera Fairy and Tera Fire Koraidon, while ignoring redirection from foes like the Ogerpon formes and Brute Bonnet. Earthquake does have the downside of hitting Ursaluna's ally, but this can be worked around with partners like Ho-Oh and Wide Guard Lunala. Protect is an essential move on Ursaluna, with its main use being to stall a turn to allow Flame Orb to activate. Protect can also let Ursaluna stay safe while a partner sets up Trick Room.</li> <li>Tera Ghost allows Ursaluna to avoid Fake Out from Rillaboom, Iron Hands, and Incineroar. It also protects Ursaluna from Fighting-type moves, such as Koraidon and Urshifu-R's Close Combat as well as Low Kick from Iron Hands. The main reason to run Tera Fairy is to give Ursaluna the advantage against Choice-locked Miraidon. Ursaluna's natural Ground typing stops Miraidon's Electric-type moves, and Tera Fairy blocks Draco Meteor. This means that Miraidon can only use Dazzling Gleam, which can not OHKO Ursaluna, while Facade OHKOes Miraidon back.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>The Urshifu formes, Koraidon, Zamazenta-C, and Iron Hands all pressure Ursaluna with powerful Fighting-type STAB moves, and Rillaboom and Calyrex-I also threaten OHKOs on Ursaluna. With minimum Speed, Ursaluna has to play around Speed ties with common threats like Iron Hands and Calyrex-I. Incineroar, when using Tera Bug or Ghost, can easily weaken Ursaluna with Intimidate and Parting Shot. As a physical attacker, Ursaluna can be severely weakened by Reflect from Grimmsnarl. Since Ursaluna's main role is as a sweeper, having its damage reduced makes it much more vulnerable to losing damage trades and having its Trick Room stalled out, especially against Pokemon like Iron Hands, Miraidon, and opposing Ursaluna.</li> <li>Ursaluna has a strong typing in the Regulation I metagame, with immunities to the main STAB moves of Miraidon, Calyrex-S, and Lunala, making it easier for Ursaluna to remove these Restricted Pokemon that can be very threatening for two of Ursaluna's best Restricted partners, Ho-Oh and Lunala. Miraidon also appreciates the wallbreaking power of Ursaluna, as it can quickly remove Rillaboom and Iron Hands, two Pokemon that Miraidon has a hard time KOing.</li> <li>Pivot moves used by Incineroar, Miraidon, and Urshifu-R allow Ursaluna to enter the field before the end of a turn, activating Flame Orb immediately without needing to stall a turn with Protect. Miraidon is able to threaten many of the Fighting-types that check Ursaluna with its Electro Drift and Dazzling Gleam while being able to pivot with Volt Switch. With help from Incineroar's Intimidate, Ursaluna can survive Urshifu-R's Close Combat and Iron Hands's Low Kick, and Parting Shot makes Incineroar a good slow pivot that can weaken a threatening target and switch in Ursaluna without taking any damage and with Flame Orb activated.</li> <li>Speed control options like Lunala's Trick Room and sometimes Ho-Oh's Tailwind set Ursaluna up to sweep through teams without having to worry about being KOed before taking KOs itself. Lunala's Moongeist Beam and Moonblast can threaten the Fighting- and Ghost-types that Ursaluna struggles with offensively and defensively. Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire threatens Calyrex-I and Rillaboom, and Wide Guard from Lunala protects Ursaluna from Calyrex-I's Glacial Lance. Urshifu-R is a good counter to Incineroar, which is otherwise a problem for Ursaluna.</li> </ul>"

    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Life Orb Ursaluna-B can fall victim to much faster threats like Sneasler and Alolan Ninetales, so it's a good idea to pair Ursaluna-B with speed control such as Tailwind and Trick Room from supporters like Whimsicott and Porygon2, respectively, to get the speed advantage and OHKO opposing Pokemon.</li> <li>Priority attacks such as Fake Out, Grassy Glide, Sucker Punch, and Aqua Jet can hinder or threaten Ursaluna-B, so priority denial from Indeedee-F and Farigiraf can protect Ursaluna-B from them.</li> <li>Redirection like Rage Powder or Follow Me from Amoonguss and Indeedee-F can protect Ursaluna-B from attacks such as Dondozo's Wave Crash and Hisuian Lilligant's Close Combat.</li> <li>Fake Out from the likes of Rillaboom or Sneasler can create opportunities for Ursaluna-B to dish out its powerful attacks, and Fake Out can be paired with Yawn to make foes flinch so that Ursaluna-B can put them to sleep safely.</li> <li>Ursaluna-B dislikes Water- and Grass-type attacks, and for this reason, Rillaboom is a great partner for Ursaluna-B, as it can switch into many super effective attacks that can threaten Ursaluna-B. Ursaluna-B also appreciates Rillaboom's Grassy Surge providing passive recovery and, in return, can remove Incineroar and Archaludon, which are Pokemon that can give trouble to Rillaboom.</li> <li>Gholdengo is a great partner for Ursaluna-B, having a great matchup against many of Ursaluna-B's checks such as Sneasler, Rillaboom, and Alolan Ninetales, and in return, Ursaluna-B can scare off Gholdengo's checks, being Incineroar, Kingambit, and Garchomp to name a few. Gholdengo can also switch into Fighting-type attacks from Sneasler and Archaludon and effectively threaten them with potentially boosted Make It Rain and Shadow Ball.</li> <li>Dragonite is a good partner for Ursaluna-B, as it can switch into any Water- or Grass-type attack from the likes of Dondozo or Sinistcha, handle many other attacks with Multiscale, and provide Tailwind support while also using Haze to remove boosts from Dondozo, Volcarona, and Archaludon. Dragonite also has a strong matchup against Sneasler, since it can soak up any attack Sneasler throws out and strike back with a Scale Shot, outspeeding Sneasler the next turn.</li> <li>Dual screens from Grimmsnarl or Aurora Veil from Alolan Ninetales can significantly increase Ursaluna-B's bulk, allowing bulkier versions to survive Tera Grass Volcarona's Quiver Dance-boosted Giga Drain, +3 Annilhilape's Drain Punch, and +4 Archaludon's Body Press.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Life Orb Ursaluna-B's main role is to be a consistent burst-damage attacker, weakening the opponent's team to clear a pathway for faster teammates or setup sweepers like Sneasler, Volcarona, and Gholdengo. Assault Vest Ursaluna-B is a bulkier attacker that can sit in front of top-tier special attackers such as Gholdengo and Archaludon and easily take them down. Finally, Leftovers Ursaluna-B can stall out the majority of Pokemon with sleep, allowing its teammates to start setting up or dish out attacks, all the while dealing good chip damage.</li> <li>Life Orb Ursaluna-B should focus on immediately dishing out damage, Assault Vest sets should support its teammates like Rillaboom and Gholdengo by removing problematic Pokemon for them like Incineroar, and Leftovers sets should punish passive play and deny a setup sweeper with Yawn. Ursaluna-B can be brought out mid- or late-game if the opponent's team has Pokemon Ursaluna-B struggles to break through like Porygon2 and Amoonguss, which can be withered by its partners.</li> <li>Sneasler outspeeds Ursaluna-B, even when Ursaluna-B is under Tailwind if Sneasler's Unburden is activated, and can inflict massive damage with Close Combat. Setting Trick Room can ease the matchup against Sneasler, and redirection from Amoonguss and Indeedee-F can also protect Ursaluna-B from it.</li> <li>Rain teams that have many Water-types like Pelipper and Basculegion-M can give Ursaluna-B a hard time, forcing Ursaluna-B to Terastallize. Against these teams, Trick Room or redirection support help a lot because Trick Room helps Ursaluna-B have the Speed advantage against Basculegion-M, and redirection can redirect powerful attacks from Archaludon, Basculegion-M, and Pelipper.</li> <li>Assault Vest Rillaboom is a good check for Ursaluna-B, as it can threaten huge damage with Wood Hammer and survive Blood Moon. Steel-types and Dragon-types like Gholdengo and Dragonite can resist Rillaboom's Grass-type attacks and retaliate for good damage. Gholdengo can use Nasty Plot to overwhelm Rillaboom with boosted Shadow Ball and Make It Rain, while Dragonite can wall Rillaboom with its defensive typing and chip down Rillaboom with Scale Shot and Extreme Speed. Additionally, Incineroar can weaken Rillaboom with Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp, and it can threaten Rillaboom with Flare Blitz.</li> <li>The combination of Maushold and Annilhilape can spell trouble for Ursaluna-B; Maushold weakens Ursaluna-B's attacks with Friend Guard and can redirect its Blood Moon and Earth Power, while Annihilape can repeatedly use Drain Punch. Redirection from supporters like Indeedee-F and Electabuzz can redirect Annihilape's Drain Punch and Maushold's Beat Up, stopping Maushold from giving Annihilape Rage Fist boosts. Ursaluna-B's Hyper Voice bypasses Maushold's Follow Me due to being a spread move, allowing it to deal decent damage to both Maushold and Annihilape.</li> </ul>",

        "description": "<ul> <li>Ursaluna-B is a powerful damage dealer that can break through teams with its STAB moves, which are reinforced by Mind's Eye and Life Orb, smashing through foes like Annihilape and opposing Ursaluna-B with Blood Moon.</li> <li>Blood Moon can rip apart more defensive teams and cleanly OHKO less bulkier Pokemon such as Garchomp, while Hyper Voice is a spread move that still can really hit frailer foes such as Sneasler, Pelipper, and Whimsicott hard. Wide Guard can block Hyper Voice, but Blood Moon being a single-target attack can get around this. Ursaluna-B can also utilize Hyper Voice on turns where it can't use Blood Moon to further threaten foes. Earth Power OHKOes or heavily damages Steel-types, which resist Ursaluna-B's Normal-type moves, such as Gholdengo, Archaludon, and Kingambit.</li> <li>Life Orb lets Ursaluna-B achieve OHKOs against bulkier Pokemon such as opposing non-Assault Vest Ursaluna-B with Blood Moon and non-Assault Vest Kingambit with Earth Power.</li> <li>Tera Normal removes Ursaluna-B's Grass- and Water-type weaknesses against Rillaboom, Basculegion-M, and Pelipper while letting Ursaluna-B OHKO the latter two of the aforementioned Pokemon with Blood Moon and 2HKO opposing Ursaluna-B with Hyper Voice.</li> <li>Both EV spreads have maximum Special Attack investment with a Modest Nature, maximizing Ursaluna-B's damage potential. The first spread's Speed investment is used to outspeed Adamant Dragapult under Tailwind, while the second spread is preferred on slower teams that utilize Trick Room instead of Tailwind. Any remaining EVs in both spreads were invested to maximize bulk.</li> <li>Life Orb Ursaluna-B has incredible damage potential; it's capable of obliterating most Pokemon, including its checks if they aren't careful. Life Orb Ursaluna-B relies heavily on speed control to do its job; it can easily be threatened by much faster threats such as Dondozo, Sneasler, boosted Gholdengo, and Alolan Ninetales without said speed control. Life Orb Ursaluna-B also doesn't invest in much bulk as other sets in favor of power, so it can be tricky to find opportunities to bring Ursaluna-B onto the field without taking a huge chunk of damage.</li> </ul>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>With an Assault Vest, Ursaluna-B can fix its poor Special Defense, giving itself more opportunities to switch in and stay out longer on the field to dish out more damage.</li> <li>Vacuum Wave grants Ursaluna-B a reliable priority move that can pick off weakened foes while also dealing good chunks of damage against Kingambit, Gholdengo, Archaludon, and opposing Ursaluna-B.</li> <li>Tera Water grants Ursaluna-B helpful resistances to Gholdengo's Make It Rain, Charizard and Torkoal's devastating Fire-type attacks, and Basculegion-M and Pelipper's Water-type attacks while becoming neutral to Sneasler's and Annilhilape's Close Combats.</li> <li>Tera Ghost provides an immunity to Fighting-type attacks like Archaludon's Body Press and Tyranitar's Low Kick as well as a neutrality to Rillaboom's Grass-type attacks. It also grants an immunity to Fake Out from Incineroar and Rillaboom, which is especially important because Assault Vest Ursaluna-B cannot use Protect. However, Tera Ghost makes Ursaluna-B vulnerable to Ghost- and Dark-type attacks from Gholdengo, Basculegion-M, Incineroar, and Kingambit.</li> <li>The HP and Defense investment is enough to let Ursaluna-B almost always survive a Close Combat from Jolly Sneasler, and with the special bulk investment and Assault Vest, Ursaluna-B can survive powerful special moves it wouldn't otherwise, such as opposing Life Orb Ursaluna-B's Blood Moon, +2 Life Orb Gholdengo's Make It Rain, Choice Specs Charizard's Heat Wave under sun, and Torkoal's Eruption under sun. The Speed investment helps Ursaluna-B outspeed uninvested Incineroar and, in Tailwind, non-Choice Scarf Hisuian Typhlosion. The Special Attack investment enables Earth Power to OHKO uninvested Gholdengo and almost always OHKO Tera Fire or Steel Garchomp with low bulk investment.</li> <li>Thanks to Assault Vest, Ursaluna-B can do much better against special attackers like Gholdengo and Archaludon it would've feared otherwise and inflict consistent damage back with its effective Normal- and Ground-type coverage. Becuase it lacks Protect, Assault Vest Ursaluna-B can be chipped down for foes to KO; most notably, flinching to Fake Out can leave Ursaluna-B vulnerable to other attacks. Assault Vest Ursaluna-B also has a loss of damage output due to dropping Life Orb, becoming less of an immediate threat.</li> </ul>"

      "Leftovers": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Leftovers Ursaluna-B can slowly stall and weaken foes with its solid bulk, access to a sleep move, and a form of recovery.</li> <li>Yawn is a great way of slowing down and threatening sleep on setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Annihilape, forcing them to switch. This synergizes well with Protect, keeping Ursaluna-B safe right after using Yawn as the foe falls asleep the next turn. Yawn and Blood Moon also have some synergy, as a drowsy foe is tempted to switch to avoid sleeping, giving Ursaluna-B a chance to deal a good chunk of damage for free with Blood Moon.</li> <li>Ursaluna-B appreciates Leftovers when stalling foes with Yawn, as it provides passive recovery when Ursaluna-B uses Protect. Leftovers can also be paired with Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain, providing a stronger and secure form of recovery.</li> <li>Tera Electric grants a resistance against Gholdengo's Make It Rain as well as a neutrality to Fighting- and Water-type attacks like Sneasler and Annihilape's Close Combats, Pelipper's Weather Ball, and Rillaboom and Sinistcha's Grass-type attacks. Tera Electric also retains Ursaluna-B's good matchup against Electric-type moves, most notably Electro Shot from Archaludon. On the other hand, Tera Water resists Water-type attacks from Basculegion-M and Pelipper unlike Tera Electric, but it gives Ursaluna-B a weakness to Electro Shot from Archaludon.</li> <li>The HP and Defense investment guarantees Ursaluna-B's survival against Jolly Sneasler's Close Combat, and with the Special Defense investment, Ursaluna-B can survive devastating special attacks like Life Orb Hatterene's Expanding Force under Psychic Terrain, +2 Gholdengo's Make It Rain, and Choice Specs Alolan Ninetales's Ice Beam.</li> <li>The combination of Yawn and Leftover's slow HP recovery can be quite overwhelming if the opponent isn't cautious, letting Ursaluna-B chip foes for its teammates to secure KOs or put foes to sleep, allowing Ursaluna-B's teammates to safely attack or set up. Taunt and Encore can disturb Ursaluna-B's strategy of using Yawn and Protect, ruining its main form of pressure. This set's attacks also aren't quite as threatening as others due to the lack of investment and Life Orb, making Ursaluna-B far easier to switch into.</li> </ul>"

Aqua Jet provides priority for Basculegion-M, dealing sizeable damage with both rain and Life Orb while being able to KO low health foes.</li> <li>Life Orb allows Basculegion-M to OHKO Calyrex-I with 150-Base Power Last Respects and Incineroar under rain with Wave Crash after Intimidate.</li> <li>The Speed investment allows Basculegion-M to outspeed Calyrex-S and Choice Scarf Chi-Yu when in the rain, while the Defense investment lets it survive Incineroar's Knock Off and Rillaboom's Grassy Glide. The Attack investment allows Basculegion-M to OHKO offensive Lunala with 100-Base Power Last Respects and bulky Miraidon with 150-Base Power Last Respects.</li> <li>Tera Ghost boosts the output of Last Respects significantly, notably allowing Basculegion-M to OHKO Calyrex-I with 100-Base Power Last Respect swhile also removing its weakness to Grass- and Electric-type moves, notably Grassy Glide, Thunderclap, and Miraidon's Volt Switch.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Amoonguss and Ogerpon-C are both very problematic for Basculegion-M, as they can safely redirect its attacks, allowing for a partner to hit it freely, while Ogerpon-C can easily threaten it with Power Whip.</li> <li>Raging Bolt, Chien-Pao, and Rillaboom can all threaten Basculegion-M with super effective priority moves in Thunderclap, Sucker Punch, and Grassy Glide while being able to take its attacks in return.</li> <li>Miraidon can comfortably take Basculegion-M's attacks while threatening it back with an OHKO with Electro Drift, whereas Koraidon can replace the rain with sun, hindering it. Focus Sash Calyrex-S can take a hit from Basculegion-M and easily KO it back with Astral Barrage.</li> <li>Kyogre pairs amazingly with Basculegion-M, as it can set rain to activate Swift Swim while having very powerful spread damage in Water Spout and Origin Pulse that can help against the redirection users that are problematic for Basculegion-M. In return, Basculegion-M can threaten faster Pokemon like Ogerpon-H, Urshifu-R, and Calyrex-S that can threaten Kyogre.</li> <li>Calyrex-I also pairs very well with Basculegion-M, as it can hit the Grass- and Dragon-types that can take Basculegion-M’s hits like Rillaboom, Miraidon, and Raging Bolt with Glacial Lance. In return, Basculegion-M can hit the Fire- and Ghost-types that threaten Calyrex-I, like Incineroar and Calyrex-S.</li> <li>Amoonguss supports Basculegion-M very well, with redirection from Rage Powder protecting Basculegion-M from powerful attacks, notably priority such as Sucker Punch; it is also able to put foes to sleep with Spore, allowing Basculegion-M to attack safely. Basculegion-M, in return, hits the Fire- and Psychic-types that threaten Amoonguss such as Chi-Yu and Calyrex-S.</li> <li>Basculegion-M appreciates damage reduction, notably from Grimmsnarl in the form of dual screens and from Incineroar in the form of Intimidate, which allows it to more safely output damage. In return, Basculegion-M matches up very well against Urshifu-R, which can bypass both’s damage reduction.</li> </ul>"

  "Sneasler": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Focus Sash Sneasler is generally used as a supportive Pokemon, using Fake Out to help allies such as Volcarona set up or to protect partners like Ursaluna to give them opportunities to deal loads of damage.</li> <li>Unburden sweeper Sneasler sets that carry either Grassy Seed or Psychic Seed tend to take a more offensive approach, with enablers of their items being must-haves. Additionally, partners that can properly take advantage of Sneasler's coverage, such as Indeedee-M, can form a strong and solid offensive core with it.</li> <li>Rillaboom is an amazing partner for Sneasler, forming a double Fake Out core that can easily overwhelm common team structures such as Dondozo + Tatsugiri teams while also threatening Ground-types that would otherwise heavily threaten Sneasler, notably the Ursaluna formes. In return, Sneasler threatens Pokemon such as Incineroar and Archaludon, Pokemon that Rillaboom struggles to break through.</li> <li>Kingambit is another great partner for almost any Sneasler set. Kingambit can threaten Gholdengo, one of the top checks to Sneasler, and take out Pokemon naturally faster than Sneasler with Sucker Punch, most importantly Dragapult. Kingambit, due to its low Speed, can also exploit Trick Room, which may be used to nullify Sneasler's presence. In return, Sneasler can use Fake Out and Coaching to support Kingambit.</li> <li>Sneasler is very susceptible to multi-hit moves such as Population Bomb from Maushold and Scale Shot from Dragonite and Baxcalibur. For this, partners such as Alolan Ninetales and Incineroar are recommended to threaten the most common multi-hit move users or, in Incineroar's case, weaken the damage instead. Additionally, Sneasler struggles against Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Annihilape without Throat Chop or Acrobatics; because of this, allies like Incineroar and Pelipper are recommended to scare away Gholdengo and Annihilape, respectively.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Sneasler's objective is to overall be a nuisance to the opposing team with moves such as Dire Claw, which has the chance to apply game-ending status conditions, as well as supporting its team or dealing heavy damage. Because of this, Sneasler thrives in board states where Dire Claw is easy to use and sometimes spam.</li> <li>Unburden sweeper sets that use either Psychic Seed or Grassy Seed need their Terrain setter to be active, so they generally aim to break holes in opposing teams early-game for allies such as Gholdengo to later clean up. Focus Sash and White Herb sets have more versatility and can be brought in the lead slot or saved in the back instead. Generally, it's advised to not bring Sneasler against Trick Room teams, as under the impairment of Trick Room, Sneasler is far more susceptible to getting KOed due to its high Speed.</li> <li>Gholdengo is the largest thorn in the side for Sneasler, as it is immune to both of Sneasler's STAB moves and is only threatened by Throat Chop. Allies like Kingambit and Incineroar can easily take care of Gholdengo with Kowtow Cleave and Knock Off, respectively. Annihilape and Dragonite can be an even bigger struggle if Sneasler doesn't tread carefully, as Annihilape is only threatened by Acrobatics, and Dragonite can use Scale Shot to OHKO Sneasler, even through Focus Sash. Alolan Ninetales threatens both of these Pokemon with Moonblast while also having access to Aurora Veil to allow Sneasler to survive attacks such as Scale Shot from Dragonite.</li> </ul>",
    "sets": {
      "Focus Sash": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Focus Sash Sneasler aims to eliminate key threats in the metagame such as Kingambit and Rillaboom with powerful STAB options while also outspeeding most Pokemon on the field. Additionally, it provides a supportive role with options like Fake Out and Coaching.</li> <li>Dire Claw and Close Combat are Sneasler's main STAB options, hitting key metagame threats such as Whimsicott and Tyranitar for huge damage, respectively. Fake Out creates openings for allies such as Gholdengo to set up while also breaking Focus Sash on opposing Sneasler before they can move if they do not tread carefully. Coaching boosts the power of physical attackers such as Baxcalibur while also boosting their Defense, allowing them to take more hits from the likes of Incineroar and Garchomp. Protect, on the other hand, can be run to keep Sneasler's Focus Sash intact against opposing Fake Out users and help stall out Trick Room turns, so Sneasler can continue to be the fastest on the field.</li> <li>Focus Sash helps combat Sneasler's frail stature, letting it survive attacks such as Expanding Force from Indeedee-M and retaliate with Close Combat or Dire Claw.</li> <li>Tera Stellar is preferred on Sneasler to let it achieve OHKOs on Rillaboom and Assault Vest Archaludon with Dire Claw and Close Combat, respectively. Tera Ghost is recommended on sets without Protect to avoid Fake Out from foes such as Incineroar and Rillaboom.</li> <li>Jolly is the most common nature on Focus Sash Sneasler, letting it outspeed and OHKO fast Pokemon such as Maushold and Whimsicott. Adamant Sneasler, on the other hand, is able to get the guaranteed OHKO with Dire Claw on Tera Grass or Fairy Volcarona and Primarina.</li> <li>Although Focus Sash allows for more flexibility, this Sneasler variant struggles heavily against Ghost-types like Gholdengo, notably having little to hit them. Focus Sash Sneasler also falls victim to four-moveslot syndrome, oftentimes warranting a need for both Coaching and Protect.</li> </ul>"

      "Unburden Sweeper": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Psychic Seed, Grassy Seed, or White Herb in conjunction with Unburden makes Sneasler the fastest Pokemon in the entire format, outspeeding and KOing top threats such as Maushold and Ursaluna-B, even when they are under Tailwind.</li> <li>On Grassy Seed sets in particular, Acrobatics is commonly run alongside Swords Dance thanks to the opportunities created by an ally Rillaboom's Fake Out, since Rillaboom is a necessary teammate to activate Grassy Seed. Acrobatics notably hits Grass- and Fighting-types such as Amoonguss, opposing Sneasler, and Annihilape. On Psychic Seed and White Herb sets, however, Dire Claw is always the preferred option, as they typically already have partners that threaten Fighting-types such as Indeedee-M.</li> <li>Throat Chop is commonly run on Psychic Seed sets so that Sneasler can threaten huge damage onto the Ghost-types of the format like Gholdengo and Dragapult, as well as Tera Ghost Pokemon like Incineroar or opposing Sneasler; notably, removing Gholdengo allows Indeedee-M to use Expanding Force more freely.</li> <li>White Herb sets tend to carry Coaching instead of Swords Dance or Throat Chop, since they do better against Incineroar, nullifying Intimidate and thus being able to better threaten Incineroar with Close Combat; this lets Sneasler provide more support for Pokemon that appreciate Coaching like Ursaluna, making them sometimes nigh impossible to stop. With the Speed boost from Unburden, it is even possible to use Coaching on allies that would be faster than Sneasler like a boosted Dragonite and Dragapult.</li> <li>Psychic Seed and Grassy Seed both provide Sneasler with defensive buffs when in their respective Terrain. With the Special Defense buff from Psychic Seed, Sneasler is now able to survive Hurricane from Timid Pelipper and Tera Stellar Draco Meteor from Power Herb Archaludon. Grassy Seed helps leverage Sneasler's Defense stat, letting it take Scale Shot from Dragonite and a +2 Tera Dark Kowtow Cleave from Black Glasses Kingambit. Finally, White Herb is used on Sneasler sets that do not particularly exploit Terrains but still want Unburden's Speed boost. White Herb has the added benefit of negating Attack drops from Intimidate as well as denying Speed drops from Alolan Ninetales's Icy Wind and Electabuzz's Electroweb.</li> <li>Tera Dark, commonly run on Psychic Seed sets, provides a immunity to Psychic-type attacks like Expanding Force from opposing Indeedee-M and boosts the power of Throat Chop, allowing Sneasler to OHKO Basculegion and frailer Gholdengo.</li> <li>Tera Flying is run on Grassy Seed sets and boosts the power of Acrobatics, letting it pick off Rillaboom; it also provides a crucial immunity to Ground-type attacks like Earth Power and Stomping Tantrum from Ursaluna-B and Garchomp, respectively.</li> <li>Tera Ghost is run on both Grassy Seed and White Herb sets, providing notable immunities to Fake Out from the likes of Incineroar and Fighting-type attacks such as Annihilape's Final Gambit and opposing Sneasler's Close Combat.</li> <li>Because Unburden already make Sneasler fast enough, Adamant is run to boost the Attack stat of Sneasler even further, letting Close Combat OHKO Ursaluna-B with slight bulk investment.</li> <li>Unburden sweeper Sneasler is far less flexible than Focus Sash sets, with the Psychic and Grassy Seed sets in particular requiring necessary support in setting up either Psychic or Grassy Terrain. Even with the defensive boosts from the Seeds, Sneasler still ends up missing its Focus Sash due to its naturally poor bulk, getting OHKOed by common super effective attacks. Sneasler also finds itself wanting to stay in a lot despite its frail stature because it would otherwise lose its Speed boosts from Unburden.</li> </ul>"

  "Dondozo": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>The sweeper set tends to be strong on hyper offensive teams that can force trades, weakening Dondozo's checks into range of its attacks. Dondozo can also be used to weaken foes early-game, putting the opposing team into range of an alternative late-game sweeper like Gholdengo or Indeedee-M. Spread moves are extremely strong with Dondozo, as they allow it to put an opposing team into range of Dondozo's attacks. Speed control such as Tailwind is also strong with Dondozo, as it allows it to outspeed threats like Sneasler and Dragapult. Meanwhile, bulky Dondozo provides a defensive Water-type that can disrupt foes by putting them to sleep, and it's helpful to enable its setup partners.</li> <li>Tatsugiri-C is a mandatory partner for sweeper Dondozo, as with Commander, it combines with Dondozo to give it a +2 boost to every stat. Talonflame is a strong partner for Dondozo, damaging the Grass-types like Rillaboom and Amoonguss that might give Dondozo issues as well as providing Tailwind speed control that allows it and its team to pick up KOs on Pokemon they would otherwise be slower against, which is beneficial for Dondozo's hyper offense-focused gameplan. Another strong partner is Choice Scarf Annihilape. With Coaching, Annilhilape allows Dondozo to becomes even more threatening than it already is. Indeedee-M and Sneasler are very strong partners for this Dondozo variant as well; the combination of them can apply pressure to some of Dondozo's checks like Primarina, Rillaboom, and Amoonguss as well as applying significant pressure to Incineroar, which could otherwise give Dondozo some trouble, and the Speed boost gained from activating Psychic Seed lets Unburden Sneasler become the fastest Pokemon in the metagame, allowing it to provide significant pressure and make room for a Dondozo win later in the game.</li> <li>Common partners for support Dondozo include bulky setup Pokemon like Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Volcarona, which tend to struggle against Fire-types, which Dondozo can beat, and in turn, they resist Grass-type attacks for Dondozo and appreciate the free turns Dondozo can generate with Yawn in order to setup. Rillaboom is another strong partner for this Dondozo set, allowing it to get free turns to use Yawn with Fake Out, providing Dondozo with Grassy Terrain to boost its longevity even further, and switching into Grass-types that are used to check Dondozo, such as opposing Rillaboom and Amoonguss. Dondozo also helps Rillaboom in matchups against Fire-types, which often give it trouble. Dondozo also appreciates being paired with Follow Me users like Magmar and Electabuzz, as they can redirect Spore from Amoonguss, hamper it with Taunt, or, in Magmar's case, threaten it with a super effective Overheat. They also help to redirect attacks that Dondozo doesn't want to take, like Electro Shot from Archaludon and Wood Hammer from Rillaboom.</li> <li>Sweeper Dondozo has a lot of trouble with Haze Primarina and Clear Smog Amoonguss, which threaten to remove its stat boosts and make it a sitting duck. Because of this, many of Dondozo's partners, like Talonflame and Sneasler, are tasked with pressuring them early-game so that they do not have an opportunity to get rid of Dondozo's stat boosts. The pivoting core of Incineroar and Amoonguss also causes Dondozo some issues, as Amoonguss can put Dondozo to sleep with Spore, and Incineroar can use Intimidate and Parting Shot to drop Dondozo's Attack greatly. Pokemon like Choice Scarf Annihilape and Indeedee-M can help solve this issue, as Annihilape can use Final Gambit to remove a defensive piece on teams using Incineroar + Amoonguss such as Porygon2 while being able to OHKO Incineroar with Close Combat and boost off Intimidate via Defiant, while Indeedee-M immediately pressures Amoonguss with Expanding Force and blocks Fake Out from Incineroar with Psychic Terrain, making it easier for Dondozo to knock out Incineroar with a super effective Wave Crash.</li> <li>Bulky Dondozo is checked by Pokemon that can hit it for super effective damage, like Rillaboom and Archaludon, or give it trouble by switching around it and hindering it with status or stat drops, such as Amoonguss, Incineroar, and other supportive Dondozo. Electabuzz and Magmar are other checks to Dondozo, as they are immune to Yawn with Vital Spirit and can allow room for a partner to pressure Dondozo with Follow Me; additionally, Magmar can burn Dondozo with Will-O-Wisp, and Electabuzz can hit it super effectively with Thunderbolt. Your own forms of redirection, such as Electabuzz and Magmar, as well as some Pokemon that naturally threaten Grass-types, like Sneasler, Volcarona, and Baxcalibur, all make for great partners to Dondozo. Kingambit also helps deter Intimidate from Incineroar and can use Rillaboom to set up Swords Dance and sweep. Gholdengo can also set up on Rillaboom while naturally being immune to Spore thanks to Good As Gold.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Commander-boosted Dondozo's main job is to act as either a wallbreaker or a sweeper, depending on the situation. Dondozo can often win the game on the spot if placed in the right position, so choosing when to combine Dondozo with Tatsugiri-C is critical. Dondozo can often be used to weaken an opposing team to the point where its partners, like Indeedee-M, can clean up the game; conversely, Dondozo's teammates can weaken the opposition to the point where it can clean up the game with its powerful boosted attacks. Meanwhile, bulky Dondozo's main role is to act as a bulky support Pokemon that can force switches with Yawn, putting its foes in awkward positions by forcing them to either switch out or fall asleep, which allows room for Dondozo's partners, such as Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Volcarona, to set up and threaten the opponent. This is often accomplished by bringing in Dondozo against foes that it walls and using Yawn on them.</li> <li>Sweeper Dondozo teams often involve making smart early-game trades and identifying whether a threat is important to keep alive after Dondozo comes in and goes down or whether it is more important for it to do damage or KO a threat to Dondozo, allowing it to get a late-game sweep. It is also important to identify when Tatsugiri-C should come in to combine with Dondozo, as once this is done, they are fully committed and can no longer switch, making Dondozo vulnerable to being played around and answered. Dondozo should come in once enough damage has been done to the enemy team or in order to deal damage to the opposing team to allow a late-game cleanup from one of Dondozo's partners. Meanwhile, bulky Dondozo is strong both early-game and late-game, depending on the situation. Dondozo tends to use Yawn for a lot of the game, and its high bulk allows it to stick around for many turns at a time. Dondozo can also be used to provide important chip damage against foes that may threaten its partners, such as Incineroar and Volcarona, which gives Dondozo's setup partners more room to break through them. Dondozo can also force opposing setup threats, such as Kingambit, Volcarona, and Archaludon, to switch out, which makes room for its own setup ally to get in the game and threaten a sweep.</li> <li>Sweeper Dondozo is checked by every form of Amoonguss, especially Clear Smog Amoonguss, as well as Haze Primarina. Forcing early-game trades to force these pieces on the board followed by dealing significant damage to them to clean up with Dondozo is important. It is also important to understand that Dondozo should not come in every matchup, as it is just too hard to get value with Dondozo in many of them. It is vital to identify whether or not Dondozo is a good Pokemon to bring into the match with the team you are facing up against. If the opponent has enough ways to threaten Dondozo and severly hinder its progress or if Dondozo struggled to get value in a previous game, leaving Dondozo behind should be considered. Dondozo is also often checked by Rillaboom, using Fake Out to pivot around it and threatening super effective damage with Wood Hammer. It is important to force damage onto Rillaboom to allow Dondozo to pick up the KO on it or soften it up with Dondozo to allow a teammate to pick it up. The core of Incineroar and Amoonguss is also really strong against Dondozo, so it is important to limit switching and pressure Incineroar as much as possible. Softening up Incineroar and Amoonguss with early-game pressure from the likes of Indeedee-M, Annihilape, and any other offensive partners you might have is important, and putting yourself in a favorable position against a weakened Amoonguss to KO it or its partner Incineroar is very important as well. On the other hand, bulky Dondozo is often checked by Rillaboom; however, many of Dondozo's Grass-resistant partners appreciate the ability to take advantage of Rillaboom to either set up in Volcarona and Kingambit's case or hit it super effectively in Sneasler's case. Another one of Dondozo's checks is Amoonguss, which can take advantage of Dondozo's passivity and incapacitate it with Spore, and it often doesn't mind Yawn because with Regenerator, it often likes switching out anyway. Dondozo can take advantage of it by using its partner Electabuzz or Magmar to exploit Amoonguss, using their Spore immunity to play around it and allow their sweeper to set up with smart positioning. Electabuzz can also disable Amoonguss with Taunt, which Dondozo appreciates, while Magmar can threaten Amoonguss with super effective damage, which weakens it enough to be taken advantage of late-game.</li> </ul>",

Alternatively, Liquidation can be used to circumvent the recoil of Wave Crash and give Dondozo more longevity.</li> <li>Fissure is used in situations where Dondozo isn't providing any pressure on the field, as Dondozo tends to be extremely passive against Pokemon naturally immune to its sleep move like Electabuzz and Gholdengo or Pokemon that like to pivot a lot naturally and don't mind taking its Water-type attack like Amoonguss, Porygon2, and other supportive Dondozo. Fissure gives Dondozo a way to provide pressure against these Pokemon that can normally wall it, and since Dondozo is so bulky, a miss often won't lose you the game.</li> <li>Unaware allows Dondozo to check setup sweepers that could otherwise beat it such as Volcarona, Gholdengo, Kingambit and Archaludon, allowing it to take their boosted attacks and force them out with Yawn.</li> <li>Tera Poison allows Dondozo to resist Grass-type attacks as well as gaining important resistances to Fighting and Poison, allowing it to wall Sneasler.

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Dondozo is a powerful tool, able to utilize its bulk to stay on the battlefield for long periods, chip foes down, and set up a favorable late-game scenario for Tatsugiri-D and a partner Restricted Pokemon. Dondozo matches up well against many physical attackers, including Incineroar, Zamazenta-C, and Koraidon, as its Defense stat already keeps it healthy, all the while using Order Up to continue to raise its Defense when combined with Tatsugiri-D.</li> <li>Substitute further increases Dondozo's longevity, which buys critical time via leftovers recovery to damage key threats. Substitute also critically blocks Spore, meaning Dondozo does not have to Terastallize because of it. Earthquake provides Dondozo with strong spread damage, notably good against targets like Miraidon and Raging Bolt, which are typically difficult for Dondozo to handle, while Wave Crash offers massive single-target damage, though its recoil can severely damage Dondozo's longevity.</li> <li>Leftovers recovery, when combined with the bulk that Commander offers, makes Dondozo extremely hard to take down without a super effective hit. Alternating Protect and an attack can often take Dondozo out of rolls that would otherwise KO it thanks to the HP regained while using Protect.</li> <li>The EV investment is done with the Commander boost in mind. The Special Defense investment allows Dondozo to always survive two Draco Meteors from Assault Vest Miraidon, while the Defense investment often lets Dondozo OHKO Incineroar and 2HKO Zamazenta-C with Body Press after one Order Up Defense boost. This Dondozo set is also able to outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Urshifu.</li> <li>Tera Grass on Dondozo removes critical weaknesses to the Electric- and Grass-type moves from Miraidon, Raging Bolt, and Rillaboom while also giving Dondozo a Spore immunity.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>The biggest threat to Dondozo is Miraidon, as most sets often OHKO Dondozo with Electro Drift, even with the Commander boost, which forces Dondozo to Terastallize in order to take Electro Drift. Even after Terastallizing, Miraidon's Choice Specs sets' Draco Meteors often threatens 2HKOs.</li> <li>Lunala poses an issue, as it offers consistent damage unfazed by the Order Up boosts, is naturally bulky, and, depending on the Dondozo set, sometimes cannot even be touched.</li> <li>The Calyrex-I matchup is potentially dangerous, as Leech Seed sets cripple Dondozo's recovery and make Calyrex-I very hard to kill. Because of this interaction, it is encouraged to Terastallize and accept being weak to Glacial Lance, since Order Up boosts can help Dondozo to endure the attacks.</li> <li>Any teams that can cycle Fake Out, such as teams that utilize one or more of Rillaboom, Iron Hands, and Incineroar, can be disastrous for Dondozo, as being the only Pokemon on the field, preventing it from dealing damage is extremely brutal.</li> <li>Both Urshifu formes are threatening, as both Surging Strikes and Wicked Blow do huge damage due to the critical hits ignoring the Commander boosts.</li> <li>Ursaluna often uses Tera Ghost to escape being weak to Body Press and does huge damage with Guts-boosted Facades, even with Commander and Order Up boosts.</li> <li>Galarian Weezing's Neutralizing Gas prevents Tatsugiri-D from activating its Commander ability, while Galarian Weezing itself threatens to chip down Dondozo with Poison.</li> <li>Calyrex-S is a great ally for Dondozo, as it can capitalize off of the damage Dondozo has done to sweep late-game. Calyrex-S can also support Dondozo earlier on by outspeeding and dealing huge damage to Miraidon, Lunala, and Calyrex-I. Koraidon is another good Restricted Pokemon as a partner, as it can use its Speed to threaten Miraidon as well while using its Fire- and Fighting-type moves to threaten foes such as Rillaboom, Amoonguss, Calyrex-I, and Incineroar.</li> <li>Tatsugiri-D is a mandatory partner for Dondozo, as the Commander boosts allow Dondozo to reach nearly all of its KOs and gain critical bulk. Galarian Weezing is a natural ally to Dondozo, as its ability to spread status via Toxic Spikes and Poison Gas helps Dondozo to chip foes down, as well as further giving Dondozo a reason to use Protect.</li> </ul>"

Magmar additionally matches up well against Amoonguss, as it can redirect Spore safely thanks to Vital Spirit, and it's capable of threatening Amoonguss with Overheat. Maushold, while also providing redirection, grants Annihilape more bulk with Friend Guard, and it can attack Annihilape with Beat Up to increase the damage Annihilape deals with Rage Fist. Alolan Ninetales provides disruption with Encore, allowing Annihilape to set up safely, alongside reducing the damage Annihilape takes with Aurora Veil. Gholdengo threatens Fairy-types like Clefable, which Annihilape struggles against, while in return Annihilape threatens Steel-types that Gholdengo struggles to damage like Archaludon and Dark-types that threaten Gholdengo like Incineroar. Ursaluna-B threatens Gholdengo, which Annihilape struggles to KO without setting up, and acts as a secondary threat for opponents to account for.</li> <li>Choice Scarf Annihilape supports Dondozo and Tatsugiri well by removing threats like Primarina with Final Gambit to allow Dondozo to use Tatsugiri's Commander effectively.

Rage Fist is used when Annihilape has switched in on an attack, granting it a higher damage output than Shadow Claw, whereas Shadow Claw provides greater immediate damage than Rage Fist. For example, Shadow Claw has the potential to 2HKO Gholdengo, while unboosted Rage Fist only has a chance to achieve a 3HKO.</li> <li>Choice Scarf allows Annihilape to outspeed threats that would normally outspeed it, such as Dragapult.</li> <li>Tera Grass provides Annihilape with an immunity to Spore and Rage Powder, preventing it from being disrupted.

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Farigiraf is a great supportive pick for a team. Its good defensive typing makes it a solid Calyrex-S check, and with Electric Seed, it can also match up well into Calyrex-I. Farigiraf also has the ability to block various priority moves such as Fake Out, Sucker Punch, and Thunderclap, keeping Farigiraf and its partners safe.</li> <li>Foul Play can hit both Calyrex formes for heavy damage while dealing solid damage to other strong physical attackers such as Koraidon, Ogerpon, and Ursaluna. Psychic can be used to reliably hit Urshifu-R and Amoonguss, while Psychic Noise can stop recovery from Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain and Terapagos's and Ho-Oh's Leftovers and prevent Iron Hands from using Drain Punch.</li> <li>Electric Seed helps Farigiraf have a much better matchup against strong physical attacks such as Wood Hammer from Rillaboom and Throat Chop or Crunch from Chien-Pao. Electric Seed can also weaken the power of Knock Off from Incineroar, which Farigiraf would normally struggle against.</li> <li>The EV spread allows Farigiraf to live a Crunch or Throat Chop from Chien-Pao, Flare Blitz from Life Orb Koraidon, or Body Press from Zamazenta-C comfortably while letting it take a Draco Meteor from Special Attack Booster Energy Raging Bolt.</li> <li>Tera Water is great against Urshifu-R because it will resist Surging Strikes, and it lets Farigiraf more comfortably take Glacial Lance from Calyrex-I. Tera Dark packs a resistance to Wicked Blow from Urshifu-S, while letting Foul Play OHKO low bulk Calyrex-S and deal hefty damage to Calyrex-I, though it can be vulnerable to Close Combat from both Urshifu formes and Koraidon and Body Press from Zamazenta-C.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>The Urshifu formes can bypass the Electric Seed Defense boost with Surging Strikes and Wicked Blow, with Urshifu-S being able to OHKO Farigiraf. Farigiraf can also be vulnerable to strong special attacks like Electro Drift from Miraidon, Dark Pulse from Chi-Yu, and Water Spout and Origin Pulse from Kyogre. Dark-types such as Incineroar, Chien-Pao, and Grimmsnarl are good checks, since Farigiraf does negligible damage back. Taunt from Flutter Mane and Incineroar can also shut down Farigiraf's supportive capabilities.</li> <li>Miraidon is mandatory to pair alongside this set, helping Farigiraf activate Electric Seed and easily removing the Urshifu formes with Electro Drift and Dazzling Gleam while greatly appreciating Farigiraf's ability to block Fake Out and Sucker Punch, which may hinder Miraidon. Iron Hands and Calyrex-I like Farigiraf's ability to reliably set Trick Room and support with Helping Hand while having a good matchup into opposing Iron Hands and Calyrex-I. In return, Iron Hands can remove the Dark-types that Farigiraf struggles against.</li> </ul>"

  "Kingambit": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Coverage for Fighting-, Fairy-, and Dark-types such as Primarina, Incineroar, and Sneasler is almost necessary when teambuilding with Kingambit. Both sets enjoy having redirection on their side, including the likes of Clefable, Electabuzz, and Amoonguss, which can easily take in Fighting-type attacks from threats like Annihilape and Sneasler. Swords Dance Kingambit can take advantage of redirection to a greater extent, since this can open windows for setup opportunities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rillaboom is a really good partner for Kingambit, providing setup opportunities with Fake Out and threatening Ground-types such as the Ursaluna formes. Dark-resistant Pokemon like Incineroar and even opposing Kingambit can be covered by Primarina, which also has great defensive synergy with Kingambit. Sneasler also works at removing Dark-types while also removing Fairy-types and providing another source of Fake Out support for Kingambit.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kingambit, thanks to its typing, is extremely weak to Fighting-types, including Annihilape, Sneasler, and Flamigo, which prove to be an issue. The aforementioned Amoonguss and Clefable can take in these Fighting-type attacks. Primarina, as mentioned before, has great defensive synergy with Kingambit, taking Fighting- and Fire-type attacks with ease, while Kingambit can cover for it against Grass- and Poison-type attacks.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Kingambit's main role is either a setup sweeper with Swords Dance or a defensive pivot piece with Assault Vest. Swords Dance Kingambit's main goal is to set up and stay healthy; redirection and Fake Out support are usually necessary in achieving this. With Tera Dark and at +2, it's very easy for Kingambit to pick up momentum quickly and blitz through careless players. Don't be greedy with using Swords Dances, as it's easy for Kingambit to be OHKOed or brought to low health with careful positioning around Sucker Punch, especially in a format with Fighting-type coverage everywhere.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kingambit succeeds as a setup sweeper thanks to its typing, bulk, and on Assault Vest sets, coverage. Its typing has many resistances to top types like Dragon, making Kingambit an amazing counter to Dragapult and Hydreigon. Kingambit's bulk, especially when it's paired with Assault Vest, is really good, allowing Kingambit to withstand hits and potentially turn the tables in a losing late-game position.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dark-resistant Pokemon are a huge issue for Kingambit, easily taking Kowtow Cleave and Sucker Punch even if they're boosted. These Pokemon can be taken care of by partners such as Primarina and Sneasler. Fighting-types, including the likes of Annihilape, can be a massive issue, easily using Kingambit to set up. Sneasler in particular can be a problem, only taking notable damage from Iron Head. Fighting-type coverage moves are also rather prevalent in the metagame, with Pokemon like Low Kick Tyranitar and Body Press Archaludon being common. For this, Ghost-type switch-ins like Dragapult or redirection can be helpful in deterring Fighting-type attacks. Additionally, opposing Sneasler can be picked off by Dragapult. Offensive Fairy-types such as Primarina can scare Kingambit away from Terastallizing into a Dark-type, as Moonblast would otherwise easily chunk Kingambit. Sneasler can easily deal with Fairy-types by hitting them hard with Dire Claw.</p> </li> </ul>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Kingambit is easily able to steamroll through teams, having a great typing both offensively and defensively and easily defeating metagame staples like Gholdengo as well as decimating foes thanks to Swords Dance. Swords Dance bolsters Kingambit's Attack such that it can pick up OHKOs on bulky Pokemon such as Rillaboom, Ursaluna-B, and Amoonguss using Kowtow Cleave, with the latter two requiring Tera Dark.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sucker Punch compensates for Kingambit's low Speed while also immediately either forcing out or pinning Choice item attackers and Assault Vest users. On top of that, Sucker Punch can cause mind games, with Kingambit potentially just using Kowtow Cleave while forcing a switch with the threat of Sucker Punch. Low Kick can defeat Tyranitar and opposing Kingambit as well as Incineroar. Iron Head can be used as coverage for Dark-resistant Pokemon like Primarina and Sneasler, but it's generally harder to pilot and use.</p> </li> <li> <p>Black Glasses is used to boost the main two moves on Kingambit, Kowtow Cleave and Sucker Punch. It allows +2 Kowtow Cleave to OHKO Rillaboom outright and Archaludon with Tera Dark as well as letting Kingambit pick off Volcarona with a +2 Sucker Punch. Safety Goggles stops Sucker Punch from getting redirected and negated by Rage Powder, which can be a huge issue for Kingambit. Safety Goggles can also deny Spore, allowing Kingambit to use Amoonguss to set up. Safety Goggles can miss key OHKOs on the Pokemon shown in the aforementioned calculations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tera Dark boosts Kingambit's damage further, allowing for OHKOs on Maushold and Gholdengo with Sucker Punch, as well as removing Kingambit's Fire weakness and 4x Fighting weakness, proving to be useful against threats like Incineroar, which Kingambit otherwise struggles to get rid of, and certain Fighting-type coverage and Pokemon like opposing Kingambit's Low Kick and Annihilape, which otherwise OHKO Kingambit.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kingambit is really difficult to stop after a Swords Dance boost and Terastallizing, OHKOing Ursaluna with Kowtow Cleave. This set struggles with four-moveslot syndrome, as having to pick between the flexibility of Swords Dance and a coverage move is difficult. Another issue that this set has is that it can be really difficult to take Dark-resistant Pokemon down, such as Incineroar. For this, setting up in front of another Pokemon or removing the Dark-resistant Pokemon can help Kingambit thrive.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Assault Vest Kingambit is great at taking strong hits while hitting back hard thanks to its high Attack stat. Its typing works amazing defensively thanks to the lack of good Ground- and Fighting-types, which is even better considering Assault Vest Kingambit works well as a bulky switch-in to many metagame staples such as Gholdengo. Defiant is very powerful on this set due to the lack of Swords Dance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Low Kick is used as coverage for Dark-types, beating Pokemon such as Incineroar and opposing Kingambit.</p> </li> <li> <p>Assault Vest allows Kingambit to take attacks like Earth Power from Ursaluna-B and Electro Shot from Archaludon as well as surviving extremely powerful attacks such as +1 Fiery Dance from Volcarona.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fire is arguably the best Tera type on this set, providing a resistance to Fire while also removing Kingambit's weakness to Fighting. As a bonus, Tera Fire grants Kingambit a burn immunity, being very useful when facing foes like Talonflame. Tera Flying removes both Kingambit's Ground- and Fighting-type weaknesses, turning them into an immunity and a resistance, respectively. Tera Dark boosts Kingambit's Dark-type STAB moves, which can be very necessary due to not using Swords Dance.</p> </li> <li> <p>The physical bulk investment lets Kingambit survive a Drain Punch from Annihilape and a rain-boosted Wave Crash from Basculegion-M. With the given special bulk, Kingambit can survive a +1 Fiery Dance from Volcarona and an Earth Power from Ursaluna-B. The offensive investment lets Sucker Punch OHKO Gholdengo with a Defiant boost while OHKOing Dragapult 75% of the time without it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Assault Vest Kingambit is more flexible in move choices compared to Swords Dance variations, able to freely carry Iron Head and coverage moves as well as generally being more flexible in playstyle. With Assault Vest, this set has great survivability. However, Assault Vest Kingambit doesn't have much sweeping potential due to not running Swords Dance. Not being able to run Protect is also a noteworthy issue, as in a metagame where Trick Room and weather are everywhere, this drawback can make it difficult to position Kingambit and its allies.</p> </li> </ul>"

It can shut down most foes with Spore and protect its allies with Rage Powder.</li> <li>Moves like Sucker Punch and Seed Bomb prevent Brute Bonnet from being fully passive and ignored or shut down by Taunt. Seed Bomb threatens Urshifu-R and Kyogre. Pollen Puff can heal teammates and threatens opposing Brute Bonnet.</li> <li>Covert Cloak ignores Fake Out pressure, which can let Brute Bonnet put a foe to sleep without being stopped.</li> <li>The physical bulk investment allows Brute Bonnet to survive Close Combat from the Urshifu formes and Glacial Lance from Calyrex-I. The special bulk investment ensures Focus Sash Flutter Mane will not KO Brute Bonnet with Moonblast.

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Flutter Mane's role is to capitalize on the Speed boost provided by its sun setter and to offer speed control while pressuring opposing Pokemon to Terastallize with its coverage. In sun, it outspeeds major offensive threats like Miraidon, Koraidon, Choice Scarf Urshifu-R, and Calyrex-S, threatening them with its STAB moves.</li> <li>Shadow Ball is useful for threatening Lunala, Calyrex-S, and opposing Flutter Mane more effectively. Icy Wind is Flutter Mane's preferred speed control option, as it slows down both foes—enabling Koraidon, which delivers far greater damage output, to clean up more easily. It also helps break Focus Sash.</li> <li>Taunt is a useful tool for shutting down opposing Trick Room setters like Lunala and Calyrex-I, blocking Spore from Amoonguss and Brute Bonnet, and preventing setup from threats like Terapagos. Taunt has niche uses such as stopping Parting Shot from Incineroar and preventing Protect and redirection on turns after Taunt is used, allowing your team to apply as much offensive pressure as possible before the sun runs out.</li> <li>Becuase it usually has Koraidon to set the sun for its Protosynthesis Speed boost, this Flutter Mane set can run full offensive investment and a Focus Sash instead of Booster Energy. Focus Sash is valuable for this more offensive Flutter Mane build due to its fragility, especially on the physical side.</li> <li>Tera Normal is mainly used as a countermeasure for Calyrex-S to gain an immunity to its Astral Barrage, though it can also be useful to gain an immunity to Lunala's Moongeist Beam. Tera Fairy is used to boost Moonblast's power, which lets it OHKO non-Assault Vest Miraidon outright as well as Tera Dragon Zamazenta-C and Brute Bonnet most of the time. Tera Stellar carries a similar benefit to Tera Fairy in terms of Moonblast OHKOs, though only on its first use, and it can also enable Shadow Ball to score surprise OHKOs on Pokemon such as Shadow Shield Lunala when Chi-Yu is on the field.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Bulky Restricted Pokemon like Zamazenta-C and Ho-Oh check this offensive Flutter Mane set, as they can comfortably take its hits and strike back with moves like Behemoth Bash or Heavy Slam and Sacred Fire, respectively.</li> <li>Priority move users such as Chien-Pao with Sucker Punch or Ice Shard and Rillaboom with Grassy Glide hinder the effectiveness of the set by breaking Focus Sash or picking up the KO when it is down to 1 HP before it can attack.</li> <li>Flutter Mane pairs well with Koraidon because it sets up the sun, triggering Flutter Mane's Protosynthesis Speed boost. In turn, Flutter Mane can provide speed control with Icy Wind, so Koraidon is able to outspeed Pokemon like Calyrex-S and threaten OHKOs with Close Combat or Flare Blitz.</li> <li>Flutter Mane is commonly paired with Choice Scarf Chi-Yu to round out a sun core because both Flutter Mane and Chi-Yu exert fast, immediate offensive pressure, with Chi-Yu's ability helping bolster Flutter Mane's damage output.</li> <li>Lastly, Pokemon with redirection such as Brute Bonnet and Indeedee-F can help Flutter Mane by protecting it from priority attacks like Raging Bolt's Thunderclap and Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch, particularly when Flutter Mane is taken down to 1 HP.</li> </ul>"

Iron Head allows Iron Treads to have a consistent Steel-type STAB option that isn't reliant on a Terrain being active. Knock Off provides Iron Treads item removal in addition to threatening Calyrex-S, whereas Ice Spinner allows Iron Treads to consistently OHKO Landorus and 2HKO Rillaboom while removing its Grassy Terrain.</li> <li>Life Orb bolsters Iron Treads's power significantly, most notably allowing it to pick up an OHKO on Miraidon and a 2HKO on Incineroar with High Horsepower. Choice Band provides more immediate power, most notably guaranteeing an OHKO on Calyrex-I with Steel Roller, but makes Iron Treads inflexible and more vulnerable to Fake Out.</li> <li>Tera Ghost provides a valuable immunity to Fighting-type attacks that otherwise threaten Iron Treads, notably Close Combat from Urshifu-R and Body Press from Zamazenta-C, while also providing a Fake Out immunity most commonly used for Incineroar and Rillaboom.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Urshifu-R and Landorus are very problematic foes for Iron Treads, as they can take Iron Treads's attacks and threaten it back with super effective STAB moves in Surging Strikes and Earth Power, respectively. Ogerpon-H can threaten to OHKO Iron Treads with Ivy Cudgel while being able to redirect its attacks with Follow Me.</li> <li>Zamazenta-C threatens Iron Treads with STAB Body Press while comfortably taking its attacks in return, as can Koraidon, which threatens Iron Treads with an easy OHKO with either Flare Blitz or Close Combat.</li> <li>Incineroar can be problematic through hindering Iron Treads's damage output with Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp. Rillaboom can also hamper Iron Treads through disabling Quark Drive with Grassy Surge and threatening big damage with Grassy Glide or Wood Hammer.</li> <li>Miraidon pairs fantastically with Iron Treads, as it can set Electric Terrain to activate Quark Drive while being able to threaten Urshifu-R , and in return, Iron Treads threatens opposing Miraidon, Chien-Pao, and Calyrex-I, which can be problematic for Miraidon. Calyrex-I appreciates Iron Treads's ability to hit Fire-types like Chi-Yu as well as Zacian-C, all of which can threaten Calyrex-I; in return, Calyrex-I can threaten Rillaboom and Ground-types like Ursaluna that Iron Treads struggles with.</li> <li>Iron Treads appreciates Fake Out support from the likes of Incineroar and Iron Hands to cover for its vulnerability due to poor defenses, particularly on variants without Protect. Iron Treads also greatly appreciates redirection from the likes of Amoonguss and Sinistcha to protect it from otherwise threatening Water- and Fighting-type attacks, and in turn, Iron Treads hits the Fire- and Ice-types that threaten them.</li> </ul>"

Lunala with Electric Seed and Shadow Shield takes little damage from Iron Hands's Wild Charge and can deal heavy damage to it with Moonblast.</li> <li>Iron Hands is often used on Miraidon teams, as Miraidon can OHKO Landorus with Draco Meteor and threaten other threats for Iron Hands like, Amoonguss, Ursaluna, and Lunala. Miraidon's Electric Terrain activates Iron Hands's Quark Drive, boosts the power of Wild Charge, and stops Spore from Amoonguss. In return, Iron Hands uses Fake Out to allow Miraidon to safely attack. Iron Hands also appreciates Farigiraf and Calyrex-I's ability to cover Psychic- and Ground-types, respectively, and set Trick Room to aid Iron Hands when against faster teams.</li> <li>Volcarona and Grimmsnarl can threaten Psychic-types with Struggle Bug and Foul Play while providing useful damage mitigation through Flame Body and dual screens.</li> </ul>"

The Speed investment paired with Booster Energy allows Iron Jugulis to outspeed Calyrex-S and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R.</li> <li>Tera Steel provides Iron Jugulis a strong defensive typing in rain while also giving key resistances to Ice- and Fairy-type moves like Icicle Crash from Chien-Pao and Moonblast from Flutter Mane. Tera Fire acts as a solid alternative, still providing resistances to Ice and Fairy but losing out on a multitude of other resistances and being a much weaker individual typing under rain.

These Pokemon also cover well for the Calyrex-I matchup, resisting Glacial Lance and firing off strong and consistent damage into it.</li> <li>Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Rillaboom work well with Iron Jugulis, providing Rage Powder and Fake Out, respectively, to give Iron Jugulis the opportunity to set up Tailwind while covering the problematic Miraidon matchup. Amoonguss also provides solid defensive coverage against threats like Zamazenta-C, resisting its Body Press and either redirecting its attacks or threatening it with Spore. Urshifu-R is also a great partner for Iron Jugulis on rain teams, benefiting from the Speed boost to fire off powerful rain-boosted Surging Strikes that can bulldoze through said bulky threats that Iron Jugulis typically struggles against.</li> </ul>"

  "Baxcalibur": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Baxcalibur works best on predominantly physically offensive teams, which take advantage of Fake Out utility, Defiant Pokemon, and methods of setting up to overwhelm the foe.</li> <li>Rillaboom synergizes with Baxcalibur, as it is able to threaten Water-types, most notably Primarina, as well as bolstering Baxcalibur's field presence with Fake Out and Grassy Terrain healing. In return, Baxcalibur pressures Grass-, Flying-, and Dragon-types like Sinistcha and Dragonite.</li> <li>Sneasler also pairs amazingly with Baxcalibur; Sneasler's most notable trait is the ability to boost Baxcalibur's offensive and defensive capabilities with Coaching, allowing it to potentially sweep entire teams. Furthermore, Sneasler can hit Steel- and Fairy-types like Kingambit and Alolan Ninetales, while Baxcalibur can threaten the Flying-types that check Sneasler, like Dragonite.</li> <li>Redirection from partners like Volcarona and Electabuzz can protect Baxcalibur from foes that threaten it, allowing for it to safely output damage, while in return, Baxcalibur hits the Grass-types immune to Rage Powder and the Flying- and Ground-types that threaten Volcarona and Electabuzz, respectively.</li> <li>Baxcalibur really struggles against Steel-types such as Kingambit and Gholdengo, which resist its STAB combination while threatening it back. The aforementioned Sneasler helps against Kingambit, while an ally Kingambit can handle Gholdengo. Intimidate from Incineroar and Hisuian Arcanine is also problematic, as it greatly weakens Baxcalibur's damage output; partners like Kingambit can punish Intimidate, while special attackers like Primarina can threaten both Pokemon without being weakened by it.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Baxcalibur functions primarily as a bulky physical sweeper, using powerful STAB moves to break through opposing teams while taking many hits in return. It shines early-game by weakening teams such that its partners can clean up easily; it's especially great against balance compositions with Rillaboom and Dragonite and rain teams once opposing Archaludon have been sufficiently weakened. It leverages its immense damage output to outshine other similar attackers like Dragonite against bulkier teams, while Thermal Exchange's burn immunity is crucial against Will-O-Wisp Magmar and Volcarona, which can be very problematic for other physical attackers.</li> <li>As aforementioned, Baxcalibur functions best early-game, using its massive damage to weaken the opposing team such that it can enable its teammates to clean, and it can sweep on its own with Coaching support from Sneasler. It is best used early-game when the opponent's team struggles to KO Baxcalibur, whereas in other matchups, KOing threatening foes like Sneasler and Gholdengo before bringing it in to clean late-game is better.</li> <li>Gholdengo is the most notable counter to Baxcalibur, resisting its STAB moves and dealing massive damage back, as does Kingambit. Stamina Archaludon also easily takes Baxcalibur's multi-hit attacks while accumulating Defense boosts to retaliate with Body Press. Use partners that can threaten these foes like your own Kingambit and Sneasler to OHKO them or force Terastallization into a typing that allows Baxcalibur to OHKO them. Sneasler can outspeed Baxcalibur and OHKO it with Close Combat, so either Terastallizing it to avoid Close Combat and KO Sneasler with Icicle Spear or using other partners like Gholdengo to threaten the foe is vital.</li> </ul>",

Dragon-types like Hydreigon and Dragapult also synergize well with Gholdengo, as they can switch into Fire-type attacks like Volcarona's Heat Wave and Incineroar's Flare Blitz, while Gholdengo switches well into the Fairy-, Dragon-, and Ice-type attacks that threaten the aforementioned Dragon-types ands hit Fairy- and Ice-types for super effective damage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Nasty Plot Gholdengo synergizes well with Pokemon like Incineroar, Rillaboom, and Amoonguss that can give it turns to set up through Fake Out and Rage Powder.

Fighting- and Ground-types like Flamigo, Sneasler, Garchomp, and Ursaluna can help against bulky Dark- and Steel-types that resist Make It Rain and Shadow Ball. Garchomp is another threat, as it outspeeds Gholdengo and threatens it before and after Terastalizing with Stomping Tantrum and Dragon Claw, respectively.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Gholdengo's main role is to play as a sweeper. Depending on the set, it can accomplish this either by setting up with Nasty Plot or by removing opposing Steel-resistant Pokemon and then sweeping with Choice Specs-boosted Make It Rain.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gholdengo is best used as an early- or late-game threat depending on the opposing team. Gameplay should focus on either removing Pokemon that can resist Make It Rain or using Gholdengo to break a hole in the opposing team and then using another strong offensive threat like Ursaluna to clean up afterwards. Nasty Plot sets are mostly used as an early-game option to take advantage of passive leads. Choice Specs sets can be used at any point in the game due to not needing to set up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kingambit and Incineroar are Gholdengo's biggest checks, as they resist its STAB attacks and can threaten it with super effective damage. Pokemon like Sneasler, Flamigo, and Paldean Tauros-W can threaten the aforementioned checks. Another method is to focus on chipping them down throughout the game before finishing them off with Gholdengo. Both Gholdengo sets struggle with smart switches, as Make It Rain lowers Special Attack, while Shadow Ball being single target leaves Gholdengo open to the other opposing Pokemon's attacks.</p> </li> </ul>",

Its high bulk allows it to stay on the field for a long time, letting it spread more damage and protect its teammates with Vessel of Ruin longer. It has good matchups into several key threats, such as Terapagos, Miraidon, and Raging Bolt.</li> <li>Snarl is used to further help its team members take special attacks, while Ruination and Sand Tomb can chip down foes to let its teammates pick up easier KOs. Ting-Lu can use either Throat Chop or Stone Edge to improve matchups into several Restricted Pokemon, including Calyrex-S, Ho-Oh, and Calyrex-I. Sand Tomb can also be used to trap foes on the field so a teammate with a good matchup or a move such as Yawn to take advantage.</li> <li>Ting-Lu uses Assault Vest to bolster its lower Special Defense. Stacking this Special Defense multiplier with Vessel of Ruin and Snarl lets it take a lot of special attacks such as Dazzling Gleam from Choice Specs Miraidon, Moonblast from foes such as Flutter Mane and Tera Fairy Lunala, and Tera Starstorm from a Calm Mind-boosted Terapagos, allowing Ting-Lu to be 3HKOed, instead of 2HKOed, by most of these.</li> <li>Ting-Lu's Attack investment allows it to 2HKO Electric Seed Lunala most of the time with Throat Chop. Its Special Defense investment allows it to survive two Modest Choice Specs Tera Fairy Miraidon Dazzling Gleams inside of Electric Terrain most of the time, as well as Mystic Water Kyogre's Water Spout in the rain.

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Koraidon deals devastating physical damage in a metagame with few Fighting- and Fire-resistant Pokemon. Koraidon excels when it outspeeds and KOes its foes before they can attack. Koraidon has great matchups against Zamazenta-C, Terapagos, and Incineroar.</li> <li>Flame Charge is used to deal chip damage and increase Koraidon's Speed, allowing it to outrun Calyrex-S. Close Combat is the preferred Fighting-type STAB attack on Life Orb variants to maximize the damage Koraidon deals in exchange for increasing the damage it receives. Collision Course is used more commonly on Clear Amulet and Ability Shield variants; it has no drawbacks but deals less damage than Close Combat unless it is super effective. Close Combat is able to achieve an OHKO on Urshifu-R, while Collision Course only has a low chance to do so.</li> <li>Life Orb maximizes Koraidon's damage, allowing it to OHKO uninvested Miraidon with Close Combat as well as Incineroar after Intimidate. Clear Amulet prevents Koraidon from having its Attack stat lowered further by Intimidate cycling from Incineroar and prevents Speed drops by Icy Wind from Flutter Mane. Ability Shield is used exclusively on teams where Koraidon is paired with Galarian Weezing, allowing Koraidon to maintain its damage boost from Orichalcum Pulse and set up sun.</li> <li>The Attack investment and an Adamant nature allow Koraidon to OHKO Calyrex-S with Flare Blitz. The defensive investment lets Koraidon survive Brave Bird from Ho-Oh after Koraidon Terastallizes and Astral Barrage from Life Orb Calyrex-S. The Speed investment enables it to outrun Ogerpon-C. Alternatively an EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used to maximize damage and Speed to outrun non-maximum Speed Miraidon.</li> <li>Tera Fire grants Koraidon a resistance to Fairy- and Ice-type attacks such as Dazzling Gleam from Miraidon and Glacial Lance from Calyrex-I as well as enhancing the damage dealt by its Fire-type attacks, allowing Koraidon to OHKO +1 Zamazenta-C with Flare Blitz and Calyrex-I with Flame Charge. Tera Fire additionally provides Koraidon with an immunity to burns.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Koraidon struggles to sufficiently damage Lunala with Shadow Shield intact. Depending on its set, Lunala can easily threaten Koraidon with Moonblast or Meteor Beam after Koraidon has Terastallized. Flutter Mane threatens Koraidon with Moonblast, and it can slow down non-Clear Amulet sets with Icy Wind.</li> <li>Miraidon threatens to OHKO it with Dazzling Gleam and Draco Meteor. When Koraidon has Terastallized, Miraidon can deal devastating damage with Electro Drift and Volt Switch.</li> <li>Koraidon pairs well with Ghost-types such as Lunala and Calyrex-S to threaten opposing Lunala and Flutter Mane with Astral Barrage and Moongeist Beam, respectively. Flutter Mane threatens Miraidon with Moonblast and handles Lunala and opposing Flutter Mane with Shadow Ball, as well as providing speed control with Icy Wind to allow Koraidon to attack before its foes can.</li> <li>Brute Bonnet provides redirection with Rage Powder and can disrupt foes with Spore. Brute Bonnet additionally threatens Ghost-types and Calyrex-I with Sucker Punch.</li> <li>Galarian Weezing pairs well with Koraidon by disabling abilities such as Lunala's Shadow Shield thanks to Neutralizing Gas, allowing Koraidon to OHKO Lunala with Flare Blitz.</li> </ul>"

  "Miraidon": {
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Miraidon uses its high Speed and Special Attack to deal huge amounts of damage to almost the entire metagame. Miraidon's high damage output allows it to threaten to OHKO opposing Restricted Pokemon such as the Calyrex formes, Koraidon, and Kyogre, forcing defensive play around it.</li> <li>Volt Switch gives Miraidon the option to pivot out, dealing good chip damage while also getting an ally into a more advantageous position. Dazzling Gleam gives Miraidon a spread damage option while threatening the Dragon-types that resist Volt Switch and Electro Drift.</li> <li>Choice Specs boosts Miraidon's damage even further. The damage boost from Choice Specs when paired with a Modest nature allows Miraidon to OHKO non-specially defensive Calyrex-I with Draco Meteor or Electro Drift in Electric Terrain and Calyrex-S with Draco Meteor even if Electric Terrain isn't active.</li> <li>A Modest nature guarantees that Tera Fairy Dazzling Gleam OHKOes all Miraidon not running an Assault Vest, while a Timid Nature lets Miraidon outspeed all Zamazenta-C and gives it the best chance to outspeed opposing Miraidon.</li> <li>Tera Fairy boosts Dazzling Gleam's damage while also granting Miraidon an immunity to Dragon-type attacks from opposing Miraidon and Raging Bolt.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Miraidon is very hard to check defensively, so most counterplay tries to outspeed and threaten it with an OHKO or a large amount of damage. Chien-Pao ties Miraidon in Speed and threatens to hit it for super effective damage while removing Electric Terrain with Ice Spinner. Calyrex-I threatens Miraidon once Trick Room has been set up.</li> <li>Rillaboom is a nuisance for Miraidon, resisting Volt Switch and Electro Drift while overriding Miraidon's Electric Terrain.</li> <li>Incineroar helps into Chien-Pao and Calyrex-I, as Intimidate and Parting Shot reduce Chien-Pao's damage and Will-O-Wisp is able to weaken even Clear Amulet Calyrex-I. Farigiraf also pairs well with Miraidon. Since Miraidon is unable to use Protect, Farigiraf can block Fake Out and boost Miraidon's damage even further with Helping Hand, letting it OHKO Rillaboom with Draco Meteor. Iron Hands pairs well with Farigiraf to give Miraidon teams a Trick Room mode. Miraidon also activates Iron Hand's Quark Drive, boosting its damage. Iron Hands can use Fake Out to give Miraidon a chance to attack without having to worry about taking a hit in return.</li> <li>Grimmsnarl and Whimsicott can provide speed control for Miriadon with Thunder Wave and Tailwind, respectively, while also providing damage reduction through Light Screen from both and Reflect from Grimmsnarl. Whimsicott can also use Encore to punish foes that use Protect in front of Miraidon's offensive pressure.</li> <li>For Restricted Pokemon partners, Calyrex-I threatens the Grass-, Dragon-, and Ground-types that resist or are immune to Miraidon's Electric-type attacks. Ho-Oh threatens to OHKO Rillaboom and sets Tailwind for Miraidon, allowing it to outspeed the entire metagame if they don't have their own Tailwind set. Lunala pairs well with Miraidon as a bulky Trick Room setter that punishes faster foes that try to outspeed and threaten Miraidon.</li> </ul>"
      },
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Assault Vest Miraidon is meant to serve a more flexible, defensive role in contrast to standard Choice Specs sets. Due to the introduction of a second Restricted Pokemon in Regulation I, it doesn't need to function as a team's main source of offense, meaning that it's able to use the Assault Vest to function as a bulky supportive option as opposed to offensive Choice Specs sets.</li> <li>Snarl is chosen in order to further neuter special attackers and allow Miraidon to apply pressure to opposing Restricted Pokemon through damage reduction in conjunction with the added bulk from its Assault Vest. Volt Switch allows Miraidon to act as a bulky pivot able to take hits from faster special attackers like Calyrex-S and reposition.</li> <li>Assault Vest augments Miraidon's ability to take on special attacking Restricted Pokemon like Calyrex-S, Kyogre, Lunala, and opposing Miraidon. Assault Vest also lets Miraidon position more flexibly than Choice-locked sets while letting Miraidon function as a more defensive Restricted Pokemon, with the Special Defense boost allowing Miraidon to live two Life Orb Astral Barrages and three unboosted Astral Barrages from Calyrex-S.</li> <li>20 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Kyogre and Groudon, while 212 Special Attack EVs lets Miraidon secure OHKOs on Pokemon like Incineroar, Calyrex-S, and Zamazenta-C with Tera Electric Electro Drift. The remaining EVs are placed into Miraidon's HP and defenses to maximize its general bulk.</li> <li>Tera Electric is used to allow Miraidon to make up for some of the damage lost from using Assault Vest, with it being instrumental in Miraidon's ability to secure key OHKOs on Pokemon like the aforementioned Incineroar. It also greatly aids Miraidon defensively by removing its weaknesses to opposing Miraidon's Draco Meteor and Dazzling Gleam, as well as Ice-type attacks from Calyrex-I and Chien-Pao.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Trading a lot of its damage output by dropping Choice Specs can often leave Miraidon lacking in damage against key threats. Rillaboom is able to take on Miraidon's hits and change its Terrain, and Iron Hands is able to take hits even better from Assault Vest Miraidon, with Draco Meteor doing a maximum of half of its HP and leaving Miraidon weakened and out of position.</li> <li>Calyrex-I is able to take a hit and OHKO Miraidon in return, Terapagos is able to clear Miraidon’s Terrain and set up against it, Koraidon is able to outspeed and deal massive damage with Life Orb Close Combat, and opposing Miraidon likely outspeeds it and can force Terastallization by threatening an OHKO with Choice Specs Draco Meteor.</li> <li>Assault Vest Miraidon functions excellently as a supporting piece alongside Trick Room-focused Restricted Pokemon like Calyrex-I and Lunala, which are able to help it turn the tables on faster Restricted Pokemon like Koraidon and opposing Miraidon, with Calyrex-I being able to threaten an OHKO on Rillaboom and opposing Miraidon and Lunala being able to take on Iron Hands and Koraidon. Electric Terrain is able to block Amoonguss and Brute Bonnet's Spore while giving Lunala a Defense boost from Electric Seed.</li> <li>Miraidon greatly appreciates Grimmsnarl's dual screen support, allowing it to even further outlast opposing Restricted Pokemon like the Calyrex formes as well as Chien-Pao, while Urshifu-R compliments Miraidon by applying immediate pressure on Terapagos and Chien-Pao. Incineroar is able to supplement Miraidon's physical bulk via Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp, helping it take physical attacks from Chien-Pao, Zamazenta-C, Life Orb Koraidon, non-Tera Fire Calyrex-I, and Iron Hands and allowing Miraidon to retaliate for significant damage. Incineroar's STAB moves are also very useful to Miraidon, as they damage key threats like Rillaboom, Chien-Pao, and the Calyrex formes, putting them into range of Miraidon's attacks.</li> </ul>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Choice Scarf Miraidon is a fast and deadly attacker, pivoting around the battlefield and dealing good damage to top Pokemon such as Calyrex-S, Ho-Oh, and Koraidon while also setting Electric Terrain to deny sleep moves from Amoonguss, Brute Bonnet, and Smeargle.</li> <li>Volt Switch is amazing in helping Miraidon pivot and chip foes in the process. Snarl allows for damage mitigation from special attackers like Calyrex-S, Lunala, and opposing Miraidon. Dazzling Gleam can be run over Snarl to deal decent damage against foes like Iron Hands and Raging Bolt, although Snarl is generally preferred for its versatility.</li> <li>Choice Scarf allows Miraidon to outspeed the majority of the format, only losing to Booster Energy Iron Bundle and Flutter Mane while beating out some of the fastest Pokemon, including Calyrex-S and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R.</li> <li>Tera Electric lets Miraidon deal more damage with Electro Drift and Volt Switch, notably letting Miraidon OHKO Farigiraf and Calyrex-S with Electro Drift.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>While Choice Scarf Miraidon moves before a majority of the metagame, it lacks the damage output of Choice Specs sets. Like Choice Specs variants, Choice Scarf Miraidon struggles to break through bulky Electric-resistant foes such as Rillaboom and Amoonguss. With the power drop from forgoing Choice Specs, Miraidon misses KOs on many bothersome Pokemon, notably missing the OHKO on Tera Fire Koraidon and Calyrex-I with Electro Drift.</li> <li>Calyrex-I is a great offensive partner for Miraidon, threatening the aforementioned Electric-resistant Pokemon like Amoonguss that would otherwise stop Miraidon in its tracks. Miraidon can help out Calyrex-I by beating Water-types that resist Glacial Lance like Kyogre and Urshifu-R. Zamazenta-C is another great partner, using Wide Guard to defend Miraidon from Precipice Blades and Glacial Lance from Groudon and opposing Calyrex-I, respectively, while also spreading good damage to special walls such as Assault Vest Rillaboom and Iron Hands.</li> <li>Farigiraf not only is able to boost Miraidon's damage with Helping Hand but also blocks Fake Out with Armor Tail and either sets up or reverses Trick Room. Miraidon can also set up Electric Terrain for Farigiraf, denying Spore from Amoonguss and Brute Bonnet while also activating Farigiraf's Electric Seed. Pokemon like Iron Hands, Ogerpon-C, and Volcarona are able to create openings for Miraidon to safely attack with Fake Out, Follow Me, and Rage Powder, respectively, and all of them fend off strong attackers that threaten Miraidon, notably Calyrex-I.</li> </ul>"

  "Sinistcha": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Setup Pokemon like Annihilape and Trick Room sweepers like Ursaluna appreciate the recovery and redirection Sinistcha provides so that they can feel more safe when setting up or attacking. Dark-types like Kingambit can threaten Ghost-type threats like Gholdengo and Basculegion-M.</li> <li>Sinistcha provides recovery for Ursaluna's burn damage while setting up Trick Room to get Ursaluna to move first. Ursaluna, in return, can counter threats like Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Incineroar with Headlong Rush. Sinistcha can threaten Water-types like Primarina and redirects Fighting-type moves like Drain Punch and Close Combat from Annihilape and Close Combat from Sneasler to further support Ursaluna. Ursaluna can switch into Ghost-type moves like Last Respects from Basculegion-M to prevent any damage dealt to Sinistcha.</li> <li>Annihilape can counter Incineroar with its ability Defiant and STAB Fighting-type moves like Drain Punch and Close Combat, which also threatens Kingambit and Archaludon. The recovery Sinistcha provides helps Annihilape stay on the field longer and use a stronger Rage Fist against threats like Gholdengo. Sinistcha can redirect damage away from Annihilape to help it set up Bulk Up to make it even more threatening for the foes.</li> <li>Archaludon appreciates the recovery brought by Sinistcha to increase its time on the field and potentially build Stamina boosts to further take hits from physical attackers like Dragonite, Annihilape, and Sneasler. Archaludon can threaten Dragonite with Dragon-type STAB moves like Draco Meteor and Dragon Pulse. Sinistcha can redirect Fighting- and Ground-type moves away from Archaludon like Close Combat from Sneasler and Earth Power from Ursaluna-B. Archaludon can threaten Dark-types like Kingambit and Incineroar with Body Press as well as Alolan Ninetales and Whimiscott with Flash Cannon.</li> <li>Pelipper can set up rain for Sinistcha so that it takes less damage from Fire-type moves like Flare Blitz from Incineroar and Hisuian Arcanine, and it also threatens to OHKO Incineroar and Hisuian Arcanine with Weather Ball. Pelipper can use Hurricane to threaten Grass-type Pokemon like Rillaboom, which ignores Rage Powder from Sinistcha, and Annihilape, a foe Sinistcha struggles against. Furthermore, Pelipper can block spread moves like Heat Wave with Wide Guard. In return, Sinistcha can support Pelipper by redirecting Electric-type moves like Thunderbolt from Electabuzz and Kilowattrel.</li> <li>Sinistcha has a poor defensive typing in the current metagame with threats like Charizard, Basculegion-M, and Tyranitar becoming more common. Heat Wave from Charizard is usually paired with sun from Torkoal and is enough to OHKO Sinistcha, Basculeigon-M can threaten Sinistcha with Last Respects, and Knock Off from Tyranitar can threaten Sinistcha while removing the ability to recover its HP with Sitrus Berry. Pelipper can help Sinistcha against Charizard and Tyranitar with rain and Weather Ball. Electro Shot from Archaludon helps Sinistcha against opposing Pelipper and Basculegion-M. Sinistcha is very passive, so an offensive partner like Archaludon or Annihilape can threaten foes while being supported by it. The Ursaluna formes can threaten Steel-types like Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Archaludon, which wall Sinistcha.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Sinistcha is very strong next to an offensive Trick Room partner like Ursaluna, as it can support it with Life Dew and Rage Powder to keep it alive longer.</li> <li>Sinistcha prefers to be brought in the back so that it can switch in and heal its partner with Hospitality. When it's against faster foes like Sneasler, Dragapult, and Archaludon, Sinistcha can focus on setting up Trick Room and supporting its slow partners with Life Dew and Rage Powder. Against slower foes like the Ursaluna formes, Kingambit, and Amoonguss, Sinistcha doesn't have to worry about setting up Trick Room; it can focus on chipping down foes HP with Matcha Gotcha and supporting its partners with Rage Powder and Life Dew.</li> <li>Sinistcha struggles against Incineroar due to its typing, and Matcha Gotcha struggles to absorb any HP from Incineroar. Kingambit can benefit from Sinistcha's Trick Room while also dealing significant damage to it with Kowtow Cleave; Sinistcha also struggles to recover any HP from using Matcha Gotcha against it. Annihilape can help Sinistcha in the matchups against Incineroar and Kingambit with the combination of Defiant and Drain Punch, and it can threaten other Dark-types like Tyranitar. Archaludon with Body Press can also help Sinistcha against Kingambit.</li> <li>Fire-types like Volcarona, Charizard, and Torkoal can threaten to OHKO Sinistcha. Pelipper can help against Fire-types by setting up the rain and attacking with Weather Ball, and Basculeigon-M threatens Fire-types like Charizard as well as Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Annihilape. Opposing Pelipper can threaten to OHKO Sinistcha with Hurricane, while Dragonite's defensive typing makes it difficult for Sinistcha to damage it. Archaludon can take advantage of rain to OHKO Pelipper with Electro Shot while resisting Pelipper's STAB moves, and it can threaten to OKHO Inner Focus Dragonite with Draco Meteor. Gholdengo threatens Sinistcha with Shadow Ball; Ursaluna's Ghost immunity and access to Headlong Rush helps Sinistcha deal with it. These traits also let Ursaluna be a great answer to other Ghost-, Fire-, and Steel-type threats like Dragapult, Hisuian Arcanine, and Kingambit. Sinistcha can heal Ursaluna's burn damage taken from Flame Orb, boosting its longevity on the field to deal with Sinistcha's threats.</li> <li>Alolan Ninetales can ignore Rage Powder with Blizzard and do significant damage to Sinistcha, and it can set up Aurora Veil to reduce the damage Matcha Gotcha can deal to it and its partner.</li> </ul>",

Additionally, Sinistcha's Grass typing makes it immune to moves like Spore from Amoonguss.</li> <li>Matcha Gotcha can be used to threaten the Ursaluna formes while restoring Sinistcha's HP. Life Dew can consistently provide more HP for Sinistcha and its partner in front of a threat like Volcarona or Gholdengo.

Tera Water can also help Sinistcha better stomach Blizzard from Alolan Ninetales.</li> <li>The physical bulk on Sinistcha helps it survive a 150-Base Power Rage Fist from Annihilape and Kowtow Cleave from Kingambit, while the special bulk lets it survive Shadow Ball from Gholdengo and Flamethrower from Volcarona.</li> </ul>"

Additionally, Ogerpon-H matches up well offensively into Calyrex-I and Zacian-C.</li> <li>Wood Hammer is the most common Grass-type STAB option on Ogerpon-H for its high and consistent damage output, notably OHKOing Urshifu-R. Grassy Glide can be used as a niche option when paired with Rillaboom for powerful priority in Grassy Terrain.</li> <li>This EV spread allows Ogerpon to almost always take a Tera Water Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R, a +1 Glacial Lance from most Calyrex-I, or a Choice Specs Draco Meteor from Timid Miraidon under Light Screen. It is also able to OHKO Rillaboom with Ivy Cudgel, outspeed Modest Landorus-I, and pick up an OHKO on both Calyrex formes with +1 Attack Tera Fire Ivy Cudgel.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Incineroar can be very problematic for Ogerpon-H, reducing its damage output with Intimidate and Parting Shot and resisting its STAB moves. Other Dragon- and Fire-types such as Koraidon and Chi-Yu can also threaten Ogerpon-H while resisting its STAB combination.</li> <li>Ogerpon-C can outspeed and threaten Ogerpon-H with an OHKO with Ivy Cudgel, while other fast threats, including Calyrex-S and Miraidon, can outspeed and threaten it with huge damage. Ogerpon-H can also struggle against powerful spread damage from Calyrex-I and Terapagos, which ignore Follow Me.</li> <li>Ogerpon-H pairs well with Calyrex-S and Zamazenta-C, as it can protect both from powerful attacks and notably allows Calyrex-S to set up, while Calyrex-S is able to threaten Koraidon and Zamazenta threatens Incineroar for Ogerpon-H. Miraidon also benefits greatly from redirection from Ogerpon-H as well as its ability to threaten Rillaboom with an OHKO using Ivy Cudgel, while Miraidon can threaten Incineroar and Dragon-types for Ogerpon-H.</li> <li>Calyrex-I also greatly appreciates redirection support, helping it to set up Trick Room and sweep, while Calyrex-I can hit the Dragon-types that can stifle Ogerpon-H's offense and allows Ogerpon-H to threaten faster foes with Trick Room.</li> <li>Urshifu-R is a strong partner for Ogerpon-H, as together, they form a potent offensive core. Urshifu-R appreciates redirection to safely dish out huge damage, while it can threaten Incineroar and, with Tera Water, KO Ogerpon-C and Calyrex-S for Ogerpon-H. Rillaboom is another strong partner, as Follow Me support allows for it to safely pivot with U-turn while Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain bolsters Ogerpon-H's Grass-type moves and provides priority to Ogerpon-H's Grassy Glide.</li> </ul>"

It also threatens Pokemon such as Chi-Yu, Tornadus, Kyogre, and Ho-Oh. Furthermore, Ogerpon-C mitigates Amoonguss and Brute Bonnet's effectiveness, as it is immune to Spore and can safely redirect Spore while ignoring Rage Powder, allowing it to maintain offensive pressure on their partners.</li> <li>Power Whip is used over Horn Leech, as it is able to achieve OHKOs where Horn Leech would not, with examples including Kyogre and Urshifu-R. Power Whip also deals no recoil damage unlike Wood Hammer, which would break Sturdy. However, Power Whip's main drawback is its lack of accuracy, making it a less consistent attacking option compared to its alternatives. Follow Me's great synergy with Sturdy allows for reliable redirection, which gives Ogerpon-C's partner a safer opportunity to switch in or set up.</li> <li>Terastallization can be a secondary supporting option if Ogerpon-C is not at full health, as removing its Grass Typing and gaining Embody Aspect would make Ogerpon-C able to wall specific foes like Ho-Oh, Tornadus, and Incineroar.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Ogerpon-C struggles against opposing Steel-types such as Zamazenta-C and Zacian-C, which can easily threaten Ogerpon-C without taking any meaningful damage in return.</li> <li>Urshifu-R can act as a check to Ogerpon-C, as Choice Scarf variants can easily OHKO it with Tera Water Surging Strikes or break Sturdy with U-turn. Iron Hands counters Ogerpon-C, threatening to break Sturdy with Fake Out and threatening it with a KO afterward with Drain Punch.</li> <li>Ogerpon-C performs well on Calyrex-S and Terapagos teams; it can help Terapagos set up safely with Follow Me while also putting Koraidon in a difficult position, as Koraidon is KOed by Psychic from Calyrex-S if Koraidon doesn't Terastallize into a Fire-type, and it is KOed by Ivy Cudgel from Ogerpon-C if it does.</li> <li>Incineroar has good synergy with Ogerpon-C in supporting their partners, as its slow Parting Shot allows Ogerpon-C to switch in safely without breaking Sturdy, and it also threatens Zacian-C with Flare Biltz. Incineroar is also able to mitigate Iron Hands's effectiveness with Intimidate, Fake Out, and Parting Shot, reliably keeping it in check.</li> <li>Ogerpon-C is a good option on Lunala compositions, since it can provide Follow Me support to let Lunala set up Trick Room and allows for a fast mode without Trick Room on those teams. Miraidon also pairs well with Ogerpon-C, as Follow Me can redirect Ground-type attacks from Landorus and Ursaluna while also threatening them back with Grass-type attacks, allowing Miraidon to have more opportunities to use Electro Drift, which threatens Zamazenta-C and Urshifu-R.</li> </ul>"

    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Archaludon's Electro Shot doesn't require a turn to charge while in rain, so Pelipper is a staple partner because of its ability Drizzle. Pelipper can help Archaludon deal with Fighting- and Ground-type threats such as Sneasler, Annihilape, Ursaluna, and Ursaluna-B with its STAB moves and provide speed control with Tailwind.</li> <li>Basculeigon-M is a common Swift Swim Pokemon used with Archaludon, mainly due to its synergy with Pelipper. Basculegion-M offers immediate damage to an otherwise slow-paced core of Pelipper and Archaludon, and it can goad Rillaboom into using Grassy Glide into a Stamina Archaludon switching in.</li> <li>Dragonite and Maushold commonly use multi-hit moves like Scale Shot, Population Bomb, and Beat Up. As allies, they can target Archaludon with these moves to instantly gain multiple Defense boosts with Stamina. Dragonite can also provide speed control with Tailwind and pressure targets such as Sneasler and Flamigo, which threaten Archaludon with Close Combat.</li> <li>Sinistcha and Amoonguss can both heal and redirect dangerous Fighting- and Ground-type attacks away from Archaludon. Sinistcha offers immediate healing on a switch in and an additional layer of speed control in Trick Room, while Amoonguss's Spore is generally disruptive, and Pollen Puff heals Archaludon more than Hospitality and Life Dew from Sinistcha can. These two Grass-types also benefit from Pelipper's rain, as it reduces Fire-type damage.</li> <li>Incineroar's Intimdate and Fake Out help with Archaludon's physical weaknesses to Sneasler and Ursaluna, and Knock Off removes items such as Assault Vest and Eviolite, which then allows Archaludon to better combat threats such as Porygon2 and opposing Archaludon.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Assault Vest Archaludon's goal is to gain stat boosts and then sweep with powerful Body Presses or STAB options. Archaludon's superb defensive typing makes it worthwhile to switch in on resisted hits to get a Stamina boost. It is particularly complementary with Pelipper, which resists Fighting and is immune to Ground, while Archaludon resists Pelipper's Electric weakness.</li> <li>When boosted, Archaludon may have problems with Haze users, particularly Haze Dragonite, which often outspeeds bulkier Archaludon. While the common Loaded Dice set does not enjoy using Scale Shot on Stamina Archaludon, it can later remove all of Archaludon's accumulated boosts. Archaludon can hit Dragonite itself with STAB Dragon Pulse or Draco Meteor, as well as the common Tera Fairy Dragonite with Flash Cannon, though for clean KOs without boosts, Multiscale should be broken first.</li> <li>Archaludon can be OHKOed by a strong Close Combat, the most common user of which is Sneasler. Strategies for dealing with Stamina Archaludon in this way involve either targeting around it for fear of giving it too many Defense boosts or chipping Archaludon enough to keep it in range of Close Combat even after a few boosts. Terastallization and utilizing Amoonguss or Sinistcha's redirection and healing are good defensive tools to combat this.</li> <li>Special attackers, particularly Ursaluna-B and Tera Blast Fighting Porygon2, threaten Archaludon's more vulnerable Special Defense while not taking much damage in return. Archaludon's own Snarl can help keep these threats at bay, particularly when combined with Terastallization.</li> <li>Changing the weather on Archaludon preparing an Electro Shot is a good way to reposition around it. Torkoal, Tyranitar, and Alolan Ninetales are the premier opposing weather setters of the format. Athough Archaludon itself can threaten all three with Body Press or an appropriate STAB move, their presence alone helps their partners, such as Charizard and Excadrill, handle Archaludon and other members of its rain core. Jumpluff and Whimsicott stand out as common users of Sunny Day, which prevents Archaludon from firing single-turn Electro Shots and has the added benefit of weakening any Water-types paired with Pelipper and Archaludon such as Basculegion-M. When facing these Pokemon, it is important to preserve Pelipper until opposing weather setters are dealt with.</li> <li>Sturdy Archaludon is more straightforward to use, as it relies less on constant boosting in favor of utilizing one boost to its fullest. Opposing teams will aim to outspeed it, deal chip damage to get around Sturdy, then land a powerful move such as Sneasler's Close Combat or Ursaluna-B's Earth Power to KO it, so Tailwind from Pokemon such as Pelipper or Icy Wind from Alolan Ninetales can help Archaludon outspeed and KO such threats.</li> </ul>",

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>Assault Vest patches up Archaludon's low Special Defense, and when this is paired with Stamina's Defense boosts and Electro Shot's Special Attack boosts, Archaludon can easily snowball.</li> <li>Central to this snowball strategy is Electro Shot, as it allows Archaludon to simultaneously boost while threatening Water-types such as Basculegion-M and Dondozo. Body Press takes advantage of Stamina boosts, threatening other Assault Vest Pokemon and Dark-types such as Incineroar and Kingambit. Flash Cannon helps Archaludon deal with Fairy-types such as Alolan Ninetales and Whimsicott. Snarl is an option to help mitigate damage from special attackers such as Gholdengo, which may wall Archaludon outside of rain otherwise, and Ursaluna-B, as well as hampering opposing Archaludon should Body Press be ineffective due to Terastallization or redirection.</li> <li>Dragon Pulse is a consistent STAB move, while Draco Meteor without boosts secures OHKOs against other Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Dragonite without Multiscale, which Dragon Pulse misses out on without prior boosts.</li> <li>Tera Grass allows Archaludon to avoid Spore and Rage Powder from Amoonguss, as well as resisting Ground-type moves from Ursaluna and Garchomp. Tera Bug grants a resistance to both Sneasler's Close Combat and both Ursaluna formes' Ground-type moves while maintaining neutralities to other types such as Ice, which is relevant against Porygon2 and Alolan Ninetales. Tera Fighting grants a resistance to Dark, denying Kingambit its chance to OHKO Archaludon before Stamina comes into play, while also powering up Body Press.</li> <li>The EVs focus on making Archaludon bulky while allowing it to outspeed Modest Pelipper, and the rest is dumped into Special Defense to maximize value from Assault Vest.</li> </ul>"
      },
      "Power Herb": {
        "description": "<ul> <li>With Power Herb, Electro Shot isn't as reliant on Pelipper's rain, allowing Archaludon to use it as a single-turn move once. While the rain is still useful to repeatedly use Electro Shot, Power Herb adds flexibility and doesn't require Pelipper to make an appearance before Archaludon can use Electro Shot. This flexibility and immediate power allows Power Herb Archaludon to actively deal more damage, whereas a bulkier Assault Vest set can sometimes need a turn or two of setup. Sturdy acts as a free Focus Sash, which lets Archaludon invest fully into its Speed and Special Attack.</li> <li>Thunderbolt, combined with Tera Electric, turns Archaludon into a premier Electric-type attacker, threatening common Water-types such as Basculegion-M and Dondozo while not having to rely on Electro Shot for repeated Electric-type damage once Power Herb has been used. Draco Meteor's high Base Power and the hyper offensive nature of this set tend to make it the more appealing option; however, Dragon Pulse is a good option in case Archaludon needs to use its Dragon-type STAB move multiple times without losing the Electro Shot boost. Flash Cannon is another STAB option to use against Fairy-types such as Alolan Ninetales and Tera Fairy Dragonite.</li> <li>Tera Stellar is an alternate option to Electric when Archaludon opts for Flash Cannon in particular, as Tera Stellar boosts both Electro Shot and its STAB moves on their first use. While Tera Electric is more useful for repeated boosted Thunderbolts, the Tera Stellar boost to Draco Meteor in particular is notable for letting Archaludon score OHKOs on bulky threats such as Ursaluna at +1.</li> <li>A Timid nature allows Archaludon to outspeed key threats such as Gholdengo, while a Modest nature maximizes damage output. The latter notably guarantees OHKOs on bulkier Nasty Plot Gholdengo variants with Tera Electric Electro Shot and most Amoonguss with Tera Stellar Draco Meteor after an Electro Shot boost.</li> </ul>"

  "Raging Bolt": {
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Raging Bolt has phenomenal natural bulk and Special Attack, allowing it to stay on the field while chipping foes, and with priority in Thunderclap, it can finish off low-HP targets. Its potent STAB moves and survivability give it favorable matchups against Kyogre, Urshifu-R, Tornadus, and Koraidon.</li> <li>Although Draco Meteor can miss and weakens Raging Bolt's damage output afterwards, it's used for a higher burst of damage, notably OHKOing non-Assault Vest Miraidon and Raging Bolt as well as Tera Dragon Zamazenta-C. Dragon Pulse is more consistent, lacking those drawbacks, but doesn't offer the same immediate power.</li> <li>Magnet is the most consistent item since Raging Bolt primarily uses Electric-type STAB moves, which get boosted. Life Orb offers a higher damage increase than Magnet and applies to all moves but reduces survivability. Additionally, both Life Orb and Magnet stack with the power boost from Protosynthesis in sun. Booster Energy provides the same boost as Life Orb without the recoil, but the boost is lost after switching out.</li> <li>The Defense investment allows Raging Bolt to live Close Combat from Life Orb Koraidon, Glacial Lance from most Calyrex-I, and almost always live Ice Spinner from Adamant Chien-Pao. The Speed investment enables Raging Bolt to outspeed maximum Speed Koraidon, Chien-Pao, and Miraidon in Tailwind. The rest is put into Special Attack to maximize its damage output.</li> <li>Tera Electric is used to boost its Electric-type STAB moves, notably allowing it to score valuable chip damage on Pokemon like Zamazenta-C with Thunderbolt, even putting it in range of a Thunderclap. It also allows Raging Bolt to OHKO Kyogre with Thunderbolt and the Life Orb and Booster Energy variants to almost always 2HKO non-Leftovers Calyrex-I with Thunderbolt. Tera Electric can also help it live Dragon-, Ice-, and Fairy-type moves such as Draco Meteor from non-Choice Specs Miraidon, Icicle Crash from Chien-Pao, and Moonblast from Flutter Mane.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Raging Bolt struggles against Chien-Pao, which threatens it with Icicle Crash and Ice Spinner, and it can pick Raging Bolt off with priority Sucker Punch, which outspeeds Thunderclap under normal circumstances.</li> <li>Landorus is problematic because it can outspeed and threaten Raging Bolt with Earth Power. Similarly, Ursaluna moves before Raging Bolt under Trick Room and threatens it with Headlong Rush.</li> <li>Calyrex-I and Miraidon teams are major threats, as Glacial Lance and Draco Meteor force Raging Bolt to Terastallize. Additionally, Choice Specs Miraidon can OHKO with Draco Meteor even if Raging Bolt Terastallizes.</li> <li>Zacian-C threatens to OHKO Raging Bolt with Play Rough, and Iron Treads pressures it with High Horsepower while not taking much damage in return.</li> <li>Grimmsnarl's damage mitigation via Light Screen and Spirit Break make it difficult for Raging Bolt to get Pokemon low on HP and finish them off with Thunderclap. Terapagos can tank Raging Bolt's attacks fairly well, especially after setting up with Calm Mind, and it can later pressure with Earth Power. Similarly, Assault Vest Ting-Lu is hard to break; it takes even less from Raging Bolt's Dragon-type moves and can wear it down with Sand Tomb and Snarl.</li> <li>Amoonguss and Brute Bonnet can be troublesome for Raging Bolt, as it can't OHKO them and risks being put to sleep by Spore. They can also redirect Raging Bolt's Thunderclap with Rage Powder, preventing it from hitting their partners.</li> <li>Koraidon is a great partner for Raging Bolt, boosting its damage output through Protosynthesis in sun. It also helps cover several of Raging Bolt’s problem matchups, threatening Amoonguss and Calyrex-I with Flare Blitz and Ting-Lu and Terapagos with Close Combat or Collision Course. In return, Raging Bolt pressures Kyogre with its Electric-type STAB moves.</li> <li>Raging Bolt fits well on Calyrex-S and Zamazenta-C balance teams. Calyrex-S can chip foes into Thunderclap range with Astral Barrage, and Raging Bolt can do the same for Calyrex-S, allowing it to receive Grim Neigh boosts. Zamazenta-C helps against Chien-Pao and Terapagos and can block Glacial Lance from Calyrex-I with Wide Guard. Incineroar's Intimidate and Parting Shot can help Raging Bolt survive some of the aforementioned attacks.</li> <li>Rillaboom and Raging Bolt both take hits well and apply priority pressure with Grassy Glide and Thunderclap, respectively. Chien-Pao also synergizes with Raging Bolt by threatening Amoonguss, Brute Bonnet, Miraidon, and Landorus with Icicle Crash or Ice Spinner while also contributing strong priority pressure, making it difficult for foes to attack freely.</li> </ul>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Assault Vest Raging Bolt is a great bulky special attacker with excellent versatility and longevity thanks to the Assault Vest and its great natural bulk. It has good matchups against Restricted Pokemon like Koraidon, Kyogre, Lunala, and Calyrex-S and non-Restricted threats such as Urshifu-R, Tornadus, and Ogerpon-H.</li> <li>Draco Meteor can be inconsistent, but it has the power to consistently OHKO threats like Miraidon and opposing Raging Bolt, something Dragon Pulse cannot do. Dragon Pulse, while more reliable, lacks that same level of immediate power. Electroweb gives Raging Bolt a form of speed control that still deals meaningful damage, letting it outspeed Pokemon like Kyogre, Chi-Yu, the Urshifu formes, and Lunala after one Electroweb. Snarl allows Raging Bolt to disrupt special attackers like Calyrex-S, Kyogre, Landorus, Terapagos, and Lunala, as well as dealing good damage to Calyrex-S and breaking Lunala's Shadow Shield.</li> <li>Assault Vest lets Raging Bolt take considerably more special attacks from Pokemon such as Calyrex-S, Lunala, Landorus, and Terapagos, such as being able to survive two of Life Orb Calyrex-S's Astral Barrages and two of Lunala's Moongeist Beams.</li> <li>The EV spread allows Raging Bolt to survive Glacial Lance from 116 Attack Adamant Calyrex-I, Icicle Crash from Jolly Chien-Pao, and Close Combat from Life Orb Koraidon. The Special Defense investment lets Raging Bolt survive Life Orb Landorus's Earth Power, two of Life Orb Calyrex-S's Astral Barrages, and Miraidon's Draco Meteor and Electro Drift after Terastallizing. The Speed investment lets Raging Bolt outspeed Landorus after a speed drop while outspeeding Calyrex-S and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R in Tailwind.</li> <li>Tera Electric is a great option to let Raging Bolt consistently 2HKO Flutter Mane, Calyrex-S, and Incineroar with Thunderbolt. Tera Fairy is a good general defensive typing to let it take Zamazenta-C's Body Press and become immune to Dragon-type moves from Miraidon and opposing Raging Bolt.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Raging Bolt can struggle against Pokemon such as Focus Sash Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane, as both can survive attacks from Raging Bolt and hit it for big damage with Ice Spinner, Icicle Crash, or Moonblast.</li> <li>Raging Bolt has bad matchups against Ground-type Pokemon like Landorus and Ursaluna, which are immune to Electric-type attacks and threaten Raging Bolt. Pokemon with Fake Out, such as Incineroar and Iron Hands, can also do well against this set, as it cannot use Protect to get around Fake Out, and both can take Raging Bolt's attacks well, allowing them to use Parting Shot or Low Kick in return.</li> <li>Raging Bolt synergizes with sun setters like Koraidon, as sun boosts Raging Bolt's Special Attack through Protosynthesis while Raging Bolt provides support for Koraidon against Kyogre. Raging Bolt also supports Pokemon like Calyrex-S against Tornadus and Urshifu-R with Thunderclap and helps Pokemon such as Calyrex-I and Zamazenta-C in the Koraidon matchup.</li> <li>Non-Restricted Pokemon like Urshifu-R and Chien-Pao pair nicely with Raging Bolt by hitting Ground- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Landorus and Rillaboom that Raging Bolt may be bad against. Incineroar is another great partner for Raging Bolt, being able to switch into threats like Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane and weaken Iron Hands and the aforementioned Chien-Pao with Intimidate. Encore Calyrex-S and Incineroar as well as other Fake Out users like Rillaboom help combat opposing Fake Out with Encore or their own Fake Out.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>With its good natural bulk, a good matchup against Calyrex-S and Lunala thanks to being immune to their Ghost-type attacks, and Tera Shell, Terapagos can find many opportunities to get on the field and start setting up with Calm Mind. Terapagos can also disrupt and hinder Pokemon and strategies featuring weather and Terrain, making it have a good matchup against Miraidon while also disturbing Koraidon, Groudon, and Kyogre.</li> <li>Earth Power gives Terapagos a reliable way to hit Zamazenta-C and Incineroar, and it's also a way to get around Wide Guard against Zamazenta-C and Lunala.</li> <li>Leftovers increases Terapagos's longevity further and can reactivate Tera Shell, especially when paired with Grassy Terrain from Rillaboom, while Covert Cloak can prevent Fake Out flinches and Special Attack drops from Miraidon, Chi-Yu and Raging Bolt's Snarl and Spirit Break from Grimmsnarl.</li> <li>The EV spread alongside a Bold nature helps Terapagos live a Close Combat from Life Orb Koraidon and +1 Body Press from Zamazenta-C after Terastallizing, and the Speed investment helps Terapagos outrun Calyrex-S after being paralyzed. The investment in HP optimizes the recovery of Leftovers and Grassy Terrain. The investment in Speed on the second spread allows Terapagos to outrun faster versions of Incineroar, and with a Modest nature, Terapagos can hit Zamazenta-C, Miraidon, and Incineroar much harder with Earth Power after Terastallizing with a Calm Mind boost, though it does lose the ability to not reliably survive Life Orb Koraidon's Close Combat after Terastallizing.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Terapagos can struggle against teams featuring Zamazenta-C, as it resists base Terapagos's Tera Starstorm, can use Wide Guard to protect its teammates from Terapagos-S's Tera Starstorm, and threatens super effective damage with Body Press. Koraidon also has the ability to completely remove or inflict massive damage onto Terapagos and force it to Terastallize in order to remove Koraidon's sun. Other Fighting-types such as Iron Hands and both Urshifu formes can also do well against Terapagos, hitting it hard with Drain Punch and Close Combat, respectively.</li> <li>Taunt and Encore from the likes of Flutter Mane, Tornadus, Whimsicott, and Calyrex-S can prevent Terapagos from setting up with Calm Mind and shut it down. Snarl from Miraidon, Raging Bolt, and Chi-Yu and Spirit Break from Grimmsnarl can repeatedly negate Calm Mind boosts, which can slow down non-Covert Cloak Terapagos. Grimmsnarl can also use Light Screen to reduce Terapagos's damage output even further. Spore from Amoonguss and Brute Bonnet can also slow down Terapagos's progress.</li> <li>Calm Mind Terapagos relies heavily on its teammates support to help it sweep because of Calm Mind's slow nature and Terapagos's generally low damage output without Calm Mind, and without its support Terapagos can fall behind when it comes to Speed and power.</li> <li>Calyrex-S can use Disable to stop Fighting-type moves from Koraidon and Zamazenta-C that threaten Terapagos and Wide Guard from the likes of Zamazenta-C and Lunala, making the aforementioned checks more managable for Terapagos. It can also use Encore to lock Pokemon into moves like Fake Out, Taunt, Encore, Wide Guard, and Grimmsnarl's Light Screen or a disabled move, rendering them useless.</li> <li>Incineroar and Rillaboom can provide Fake Out support alongside pivoting moves such as Parting Shot and U-turn; Incineroar also has Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp to weaken physical threats like Koraidon and Iron Hands, while Rillaboom sets Grassy Terrain, increasing Terapagos's longevity further.</li> <li>Amoonguss and Ogerpon-C provide redirection in Rage Powder and Follow Me, respectively, keeping Terapagos safe. Amoonguss is an annoyance for the likes of Zamazenta-C, Urshifu-R, and Iron Hands by resisting their Fighting-type STAB moves while also taking Zamazenta-C's Heavy Slam and Behemoth Bash comfortably. Amoonguss can also heal Terapagos and restore Tera Shell with Pollen Puff. Ogerpon-C can redirect Spore from the likes of Amoonguss and Brute Bonnet, which Terapagos would normally struggle against, while threatening Urshifu-R with Power Whip.</li> <li>Flutter Mane can use Thunder Wave to allow Terapagos to outspeed common threats such as Calyrex-S, Zamazenta-C, and Koraidon. Flutter Mane can also threaten Koraidon, Iron Hands, and both Urshifu formes with Moonblast. Taunt can prevent Wide Guard, foes' Taunt, and Encore from being used.</li> </ul>"

      "Power Herb": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Power Herb Terapagos is a hyper offensive threat, firing off Meteor Beam to boost its offense and dealing unresisted damage with Tera Starstorm after Terastallizing. Terapagos has a great matchup against Miraidon and Kyogre, as it is capable of surviving attacks from them thanks to Tera Shell and then removing terrain and weather upon Terastallizing with Teraform Zero.</li> <li>Meteor Beam OHKOs Volcarona, Ogerpon-H, and Chi-Yu and deals significant damage to Calyrex-I and Incineroar, allowing Terapagos to finish them off with Tera Starstorm on the following turn. Earth Power lets Terapagos threaten 2HKOs against Miraidon and Zamazenta-C when at +1.</li> <li>Power Herb Terapagos sets run maximum Speed EVs with a Timid nature to outrun Adamant Urshifu sets.</li> <li>Tera Stellar transforms Tera Starstorm into a spread Stellar-type attack and increases the damage of Meteor Beam and Earth Power, guaranteeing an OHKO on non-Assault Vest Incineroar with Meteor Beam and a 2HKO on Assault Vest Miraidon with Earth Power at +1.</li> </ul> <h4>Teambuilding</h4> <ul> <li>Fighting-types are generally problematic for Terapagos. Koraidon and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R outspeed Terapagos and threaten it with Collision Course and Close Combat, respectively. Zamazenta-C and Iron Hands threaten Terapagos with Body Press and Drain Punch while surviving its Earth Power.</li> <li>Ghost-types such as Calyrex-S, Lunala, and Flutter Mane are difficult for Terapagos to damage. They pressure Terapagos to terastallize in order to sufficiently damage them with Tera Starstorm, while they can easily chip away at Terapagos with their Psychic- and Fairy-type attacks.</li> <li>On top of their type advantages, Zamazenta-C and Lunala can disrupt Terapagos further with Wide Guard protecting them and their allies from Tera Starstorm when Terapagos has Terastallized.</li> <li>Damage mitigation by Whimsicott and Grimmsnarl's Light Screen as well as Miraidon and Chi-Yu's Snarl severely weakens Terapagos's damage output.</li> <li>Amoonguss can be annoying since it can comfortably withstand attacks from Terapagos, redirect its attacks, and put it to sleep with Spore.</li> <li>Terapagos is often paired with Choice Scarf Miraidon. Miraidon deals solid damage with Electro Drift and Draco Meteor to bulky foes like Zamazenta-C and Lunala, softening them up for Terapagos to finish off with Tera Starstorm. Miraidon additionally supports Terapagos by threatening Koraidon and Urshifu-R with its STAB moves. Miraidon's Electric Terrain is also handy for preventing Amoonguss from slowing down Terapagos's offensive pressure with Spore. Miraidon's Snarl can threaten Calyrex-S and Lunala while hindering their damage output.</li> <li>Incineroar works well with Terapagos, reducing the damage of the Fighting-type threats like the Urshifu formes and Iron Hands with Intimidate as well as threatening Ghost-types like Calyrex-S and Lunala with Knock Off, forcing them to Terastallize; afterwards,Terapagos can threaten them with Tera Starstorm.</li> <li>Amoonguss comfortably takes Fighting-type attacks and redirects them away from Terapagos. It also disrupts these foes with Spore and can heal Terapagos with Pollen Puff,  allowing it to regain Tera Shell if it hasn't Terastallized.</li> <li>Volcarona can also be found on teams with Power Herb Terapagos, where it is often used as a setup sweeper rather than redirection support. Volcarona can resist attacks from Zamazenta-C and can threaten it with Fiery Dance alongside Amoonguss.</li> </ul>"
