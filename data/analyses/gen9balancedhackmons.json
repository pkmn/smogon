        "description": "<p>Thanks to Light Ball, Pikachu is a niche Imposter user that can break past less-sturdy Imposter-proofers, although it forgoes defensive utility in exchange. When Pikachu transforms, only the ability, item, and HP EVs listed here matter. The listed moves, non-HP EVs, and nature will very rarely see use: since Pikachu outspeeds all other Imposter users like Chansey, it is extremely rare that Pikachu is not transformed. Nevertheless, Volt Switch provides a reasonably strong pivoting option against opposing transformed Imposter users, which cause Pikachu's Imposter to fail, while Glare can paralyze threats to aid Pikachu later on. Healing Wish and Spikes both provide some utility if Pikachu is no longer needed. Since Pikachu is extremely frail, it can easily fall to any strong move from opposing threats it wants to transform into. Therefore, significant team support is needed to realize its potential. Paralysis spam through Nuzzle and Glare ensures Pikachu always outspeeds opposing threats like Mega Mewtwo X, and it can also generate free turns. Knock Off invalidates Pikachu, so Knock Off absorbers, such as Arceus with a held Plate are recommended. Bulky special walls like Ice Scales Arceus-Ground and Ho-Oh check Mega Diancie and Arceus-Ghost, which Pikachu cannot safely transform into: the former can OHKO with Extreme Speed, and the latter Imposter-proofs itself.</p>"

  "Chansey": {
    "overview": "<p>Imposter Chansey is the single most defining set in BH. With astronomical HP that is preserved after transforming compounded with a potential Eviolite boost, it can turn into a significantly bulkier version of the foe, making it a blanket check to most offensive Pokemon. Defensive Pokemon are not safe either, as without proper teambuilding, Imposter users can take advantage of their enormous bulk to become incredibly difficult to punish, allowing them to utilize the constant PP Imposter can provide to stall out the foes. As a result of these traits, every team must Imposter-proof: be well prepared for and carry responses to all of its own Pokemon. Imposter also provides invaluable scouting information in a tier where anything is possible to allow the player to make more informed decisions. Additionally, Imposter Chansey and Blissey provide role compression by Imposter-proofing some special attackers when not transformed. However, every competent team will prepare carefully for Imposter, limiting its effectiveness; examples of common generally Imposter-resilient sets include Plate + Judgment users like Arceus-Ghost and Thunder Cage + Strength Sap users like Arceus-Electric. Imposter users also dislike the metagame having an abundance of offensive Pokemon such as Eternatus and Mega Garchomp that are weak to their own STAB moves, reducing their defensive utility and making them more difficult to fit on teams.</p> <p>Alternatively, non-Imposter Chansey utilizes its astronomical special bulk and respectable physical bulk with Eviolite to serve as a strong special wall capable of answering threats like Eternatus and Take Heart Arceus formes. It differentiates itself from Blissey through the extra bulk from said item allowing it to sponge certain physical coverage moves like Eternatus's Shell Side Arm much more comfortably. Its exceptional special bulk also lets it forgo Ice Scales in favor of Magic Guard, allowing it to be very resilient against residual damage from entry hazards, Thunder Cage, and status conditions. Chansey's minuscule Attack also lets it neutralize Strength Sap healing from the special attackers it aims to wall to support its offensive teammates. However, Chansey is rather passive, causing it to be a momentum drain against Pokemon such as RegenVest users with Knock Off and Flutter Mane, which an issue amplified by its lack of passive recovery from Leftovers, forcing it to spend turns healing more. It also has a minor opportunity cost of not being able to use Eviolite + Imposter.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Imposter users can run a variety of other utility moves depending on what the team requires, with some examples being Court Change, Rapid Spin, and Glare. They can also use some other niche items. Leftovers provides a minor longevity increase and crucially gives them an edge against otherwise troublesome Take Heart Arceus formes. Spooky Plate lets them surprise Normalize Flutter Mane and non-Knock Off Arceus-Ghost, although these are its exclusive use cases. Choice Scarf is very niche, and the Choice lock can be highly restrictive and exploitable, with the only benefit being safer matchups against certain offensive Pokemon, mainly Dragon-types like Ultra Necrozma and Mega Garchomp. Non-Imposter Chansey can utilize a Regenerator set to spend less turns healing but faces fierce competition from Blissey due to a vulnerability to entry hazards, with the extra security against Shell Side Arm Eternatus being offset by potential poison.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Imposter users hate having their items removed, whether it's the significant bulk cut from losing Eviolite or losing the high utility Heavy-Duty Boots and Covert Cloak provide. Non-Imposter Chansey is heavily reliant on Eviolite for its bulk, making Knock Off incredibly crippling.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: Paralysis cripples Imposter users' ability to check notable offensive threats and allows common Dragon Energy users like Eternatus to comfortably defeat them. Poison can also rapidly chip them down.</p> <p><strong>Anti-Imposter Sets</strong>: Due to Imposter's prevalence, many common sets are capable of defeating Imposter users one-on-one. Notable examples include Thunder Cage + Strength Sap Arceus formes and Judgment + Plate users like Arceus-Ghost, Arceus-Steel, and Flutter Mane.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers with Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Powerful wallbreakers such as Eternatus, Ultra Necrozma, and Mega Garchomp can hit Imposter users extremely hard, deterring them from switching in. Dragon Energy users in particular can threaten weakened Imposter users significantly. These will often need to consider Speed ties against Imposter users, however, so may still switch out.</p> <p><strong>Limiting Healing</strong>: Imposter users can be susceptible to being worn down rapidly if they is unable to transform into something that can reliably heal. This most commonly involves Strength Sap and limiting its healing through low Attack Pokemon like Chansey, Blissey, and Mega Audino.</p> <p><strong>Trapping</strong>: Imposter only grants a total of 20 PP, so sets with a trapping move like Spirit Shackle, Block, or the rare Jaw Lock can trap and PP stall Imposter users. However, Spirit Shackle users must be cautious of being reverse PP stalled by Covert Cloak Imposter users in extended games.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Despite the Eviolite boost, Chansey is still rather frail physically and is vulnerable to physical wallbreakers like Mega Garchomp and Mega Blaziken, though Burning Bulwark can somewhat alleviate the issue against Choice Band users.</p> <p><strong>Flutter Mane</strong>: Flutter Mane regularly runs Pain Split and Spikes, allowing to make significant progress against Chansey while keeping itself healthy.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Chansey is highly vulnerable to Taunt due to its passivity. Taunt is capable of shutting down its recovery, can stop its setup control, and often prevents its pivoting attempts.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Most of the time, Chansey will be transformed into the foe, so the given moves are for the situations it is not transformed. Shore Up in conjunction with Topsy-Turvy or Haze allows Chansey to excellently Imposter-proof special attackers such as Miraidon and Take Heart Arceus formes with its high special bulk and low Attack to limit Strength Sap healing from opposing Imposter users. Block can be used to ensure that opposing Imposter users that stay in are trapped and eliminated, while Teleport provides slow pivoting instead. Heal Bell lets Chansey act as a cleric in a pinch, while Jungle Healing can provide additional recovery while also curing it of status, which is useful to Imposter-proof Eternatus. Wish is an alternative if Teleport is run to effectively support teammates. Eviolite provides a generally useful bulk increase that is particularly helpful against threats like Mega Alakazam. Heavy-Duty Boots is the premier option on entry hazard-resilient teams that forgo hazard removal. Covert Cloak meanwhile blocks the secondary effect of moves like Spirit Shackle and Mortal Spin, allowing it to bypass some Imposter-proofing methods. It is worth noting that if Eviolite is not opted for, then Blissey can be used as the Imposter user.</p> <p>Imposter users can fit on virtually every team archetype due to the utility and information they provide, and all Pokemon can benefit from their presence. Physically offensive Pokemon such as Choice Band Ash-Greninja and Mega Garchomp appreciate the scouting information Imposter brings, in particular moves like Burning Bulwark being revealed; these Pokemon are also particularly helpful for Teleport sets, providing an immediate method to force out opposing Imposter users transformed into Chansey. Special attackers like Eternatus and Mega Gardevoir meanwhile enjoy Imposter Chansey's ability to trade Knock Offs against opposing RegenVest Pokemon to soften them up, and these attackers can also be potentially Imposter-proofed by it. Defensively, walls appreciate Imposter Chansey alleviating pressure by soft checking threats like Mega Alakazam. Pokemon that provide slow pivoting, such as Mega Audino, can bring Imposter users in to safely scout opponents. Special walls like Ice Scales Mega Audino can check a variety of threats to Imposter users, such as Arceus-Ghost, Take Heart Arceus formes, and offensive Dragon-types like Mega Sceptile. Imposter users can also be highly reliant on their items, especially in the case of Heavy-Duty Boots and Covert Cloak, so they appreciates Knock Off absorbers like Magic Guard Arceus Ghost and select RegenVest users.</p>"

This special bulk allows Blissey to forgo Ice Scales for abilities like Magic Guard and Regenerator that give it extra survivability against all forms of chip damage. Its low Attack also lets it deny Strength Sap's healing from most special attackers like Miraidon and Arceus-Fairy. Blissey has the fatal flaw of having nonexistent Defense, so it is forced out by physical attackers; however, this can also be used to your advantage to offensively Imposter-proof Blissey with said attackers. Blissey faces competition from Chansey as a Magic Guard user because of Chansey's increased bulk from Eviolite; however, Blissey has the advantage of not being deterred as much by Knock Off. Additionally, Blissey is quite passive, especially against Regenerator users, so it can struggle to progress the game apart from slow pivoting.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Status-inducing moves such as Glare and Toxic are potential options on the Magic Guard set, but they make Blissey far too passive without providing other utility to be worth it. Miscellaneous utility abilities like Drought and Pressure can be utilized on specific teams, but they are generally niche.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Blissey's abysmal Defense means that virtually any physical attacker threatens it. They have to be careful of Burning Bulwark, however.</p> <p><strong>Attackers That Target Defense</strong>: In a similar vein, Blissey cannot check mixed attackers like High Jump Kick Mega Sceptile and Secret Sword or Psystrike users like Arceus-Ghost and Mega Gardevoir, since they target Blissey's Defense stat.</p> <p><strong>Regenerator Users</strong>: Regenerator users like Ting-Lu can shrug off Ruinations from Blissey and use it as an entry point for their various utility.</p> <p><strong>Pain Split Flutter Mane</strong>: With Pain Split, Flutter Mane can heavily damage Blissey while healing itself to full HP every time, wasting Blissey's recovery PP and weakening it so other foes such as Eternatus can break through it.</p>",

      "Magic Guard": {
        "description": "<p>With Magic Guard, Blissey is immune to all kinds of passive damage like entry hazards, Thunder Cage chip damage, and poison. This lets Blissey very consistently check most special attackers without fear of said passive damage cutting into its longevity. Shore Up is the preferred move option thanks to its consistency, though Wish can also be used as an alternative for more PP and the ability to heal other teammates. Ruination, compared with the Strength Sap blocking potential of Blissey, will completely brick most Strength Sap reliant foes that aren't physical while efficiently wasting recovery PP from other foes that rely on it. It also prevents Blissey from being entirely passive, though it's still questionable against Regenerator users. Topsy-Turvy deters setup from various special attackers, like Torch Song Mega Sceptile and Take Heart Arceus-Fairy. Burning Bulwark scouts moves, especially from Choice Band users like Mega Garchomp thinking they can use Blissey as a free entry point to start wallbreaking only to get permanently crippled by a burn, while additionally letting Blissey use Wish safely. However, it can make Blissey hard to Imposter-proof offensively with your own physical attackers. Teleport is the preferred pivoting move thanks to its negative priority, but Parting Shot can also be used to annoy switch-ins with lowered offenses, and U-turn bypasses Taunt.</p> <p>Blissey's ability to block Strength Sap's healing means that virtually every single Choice Band user appreciates it, especially ones that are slower and thus more vulnerable to Strength Sap neutralizing them like Mega Blaziken. Additionally, they can also reverse Imposter-proof Blissey if it's not carrying Burning Bulwark. Other teammates like RegenVest Celesteela and Ice Scales Arceus-Steel appreciate Blissey checking threats they cannot, such as Encore Miraidon, alongside the occasional Imposter-proofing that Blissey can provide. Blissey is vulnerable to foes that run coverage specifically for it like Shell Side Arm Eternatus and Secret Sword Arceus-Ghost, strong physical attackers like Ash-Greninja using it as an entry point, and mixed attackers like Ultra Necrozma. Therefore solid checks to them like Fur Coat Mega Audino, Ice Scales Arceus-Ground, and RegenVest Ting-Lu make for good partners. Fast offensive teammates like Koraidon also synergie well with Wish variants of Blissey to revenge kill setup threats weakened by Ruination.</p>"

Ruination reduces Blissey's passivity, though Salt Cure is an alternative that can be more effective into Pokemon like Celesteela and Flare Boost Flutter Mane. Clear Smog, Topsy-Turvy, and Glare prevent Blissey from being setup fodder, with the latter being particularly useful against Magic Guard Eternatus and Imposter users, while Stone Axe provides utility if setup control is not necessary. Assault Vest further amplifies Blissey's Special Defense against powerful wallbreakers like Mega Alakazam that could otherwise outdamage Regenerator healing, while Heavy-Duty Boots prevents entry hazard damage and allows Blissey to access the aforementioned status moves. Blissey pairs incredibly well with very fast offensive Pokemon like Mega Alakazam and Mega Sceptile, as it provides slow pivoting, Wish support to offset residual damage for Mega Alakazam and allow Mega Sceptile to forgo Strength Sap, and healing denial against special walls like Ice Scales Arceus formes, while they revenge-kill numerous threats that Blissey can pivot into, especially those that Blissey cannot beat by itself such as Eternatus and Flare Boost Flutter Mane. Strong physical attackers also work well, as they can offensively Imposter-proof Blissey without conceding momentum; particularly, Ash-Greninja can pick off chipped Ice Scales Arceus formes. Blissey cannot handle certain special attackers like Psystrike Mega Alakazam, Shell Side Arm Eternatus, and various Secret Sword users, mandating a secondary special wall like Ice Scales users.

Swords Dance bolsters these moves even further, notably allowing V-create to OHKO neutral Arceus formes and Volt Tackle to 2HKO Mega Slowbro, in addition to preventing Imposter users and faster Pokemon like Eternatus and from permanently walling Ho-Oh with Strength Sap; alternatively, Headlong Rush allows Ho-Oh to hit foes like Eternatus and Fire-immune Steel-types like Registeel super effectively. Magic Guard Ho-Oh best fits on balance teams looking for a bulky setup attacker that wears down common walls and can potentially sweep late-game.

Secret Sword is an option that lets Arceus-Electric bypass Blissey, an otherwise hard stop to it that also denies Strength Sap healing.

    "overview": "<p>Arceus-Fairy is a great, flexible, defensive option for most teams thanks to its typing, good bulk that allows it to serve a role as either a Fur Coat or an Ice Scales Pokemon, and high Speed that eclipses most physical attackers for the Fur Coat set. Its bulk also makes it a solid choice for a bulky Take Heart sweeper, with Thunder Cage + Strength Sap allowing it to beat most Imposter users one-on-one. A mixed set with Pixilate allows Arceus-Fairy to scare potential checks and counters with a powerful Extreme Speed. Arceus-Fairy's main flaw is arguably its dependence on Strength Sap for healing, which means Magic Guard Blissey and Chansey are perfect counters, since they have the perfect kits to freely switch into Arceus-Fairy and stall it out; Arceus-Fairy can't reliably use Recover instead, as doing so completely forfeits its advantage against Impostor users. Additionally, Fur Coat Arceus-Fairy can struggle against common Steel-type coverage from Choice Band users like Mega Garchomp, while Ice Scales variants are vulnerable to Eternatus and super effective coverage like Noxious Torque Ash-Greninja and Gigaton Hammer Mega Sceptile.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heavy-Duty Boots serves as a good option for Arceus-Fairy in general, as preventing entry hazard damage can end up being important in the long run. Covert Cloak is also a viable option, preventing a lot of chip damage from Salt Cure. Arceus-Fairy can run a more support-oriented moveset with moves such as Spikes, but this makes it quite challenging to Impostor-proof.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Blissey and Chansey</strong>: Their immense bulk and Magic Guard render Take Heart Arceus-Fairy almost helpless against them, and their tiny Attack means Arceus-Fairy heals for basically nothing with Strength Sap.</p> <p><strong>Ice Scales</strong>: Other Ice Scales users, such as various Arceus forms, Meloetta, and Mega Audino, can check Take Heart Arceus-Fairy, though they should be wary of Thunder Cage's residual damage.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Strong Steel-type wallbreakers such as Mega Lucario greatly threaten Arceus-Fairy. Defensively, Pokemon like Solgaleo and Arceus-Steel can check all variants of Arceus-Fairy.</p> <p><strong>Salt Cure</strong>: Unless Covert Cloak is used, Salt Cure puts Take Heart Arceus-Fairy on a timer, making it more difficult to set up, as well as making it so Arceus-Fairy is unable to Impostor-proof itself.</p> <p><strong>Eternatus</strong>: Eternatus can pressure unboosted Arceus-Fairy out with Poison-type moves. Unaware Eternatus can switch in on any Arceus-Fairy and use it as setup fodder.</p>",

Leftovers allows Arceus-Fairy to not have its healing cut off by Pokemon with low attack, as well as giving it increased longevity, while Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers and notably slows down Sniper Ash-Greninja significantly.</p> <p>Arceus-Fairy is typically splashed onto bulkier teams as a wall against threats like Mega Garchomp, Mega Sceptile, and Ash-Greninja, in addition to compressing a late-game win condition at the same time. Arceus-Fairy's solid typing and bulk mean it can serve as a good Imposter-proof to Pokemon like these, particularly with Rocky Helmet if running Fur Coat. Arceus-Fairy does falter to fast Pokemon that can easily slot Steel or Poison-type coverage, like Koraidon for Fur Coat sets, and Sheer Force Ash-Greninja for Ice Scales sets, so defensive Pokemon that can stonewall them like RegenVest Dialga-O, Mega Swampert, and Zamazenta can assist with that, and, in Mega Swampert's case, provides a very valuable check to the threatening Mega Lucario. Arceus-Fairy is both stonewalled and has its healing denied by Blissey and Chansey, so a teammate with Psystrike or a similar move that can pressure them out, like Mega Gardevoir or High Jump Kick Mega Sceptile, is highly recommended.</p>"

Its Fighting typing also provides it with a useful resistance to Ash-Greninja's Wicked Blow, a resistance to Stealth Rock, and no weaknesses to common physical moves. Secret Sword heavily chunks Blissey and hits RegenVest Pokemon such as Primal Kyogre harder, though Revelation Dance has more PP, allows Arceus-Fighting to Imposter-proof itself, and isn't weakened by Fur Coat, making it generally better against Mega Audino. Thunder Cage provides general coverage and chip damage against Pokemon like Ho-Oh and Arceus-Fairy, as well as deterring Imposter users. Ice Beam is an alternative to punish Eternatus, particularly Magic Guard variants that otherwise wall Arceus-Fighting, and also hit Ultra Necrozma, although this means a teammate is required for Imposter-proofing.

It is able to soft check a lot of would-be annoyances such as RegenVest Celesteela without Nuzzle and Mega Lucario depending on its ability. Its ability to block Rapid Spin also differentiates it from other Arceus formes. However, Arceus-Ghost can be hard walled rather easily by certain walls such as Mega Audino and Meloetta. Its low immediate damage output can also lead to fast offensive threats like Eternatus forcing it out. Its ability choice of Magic Guard or Fur Coat also mean it either has limited defensive presence or is a physical wall that's weak to Choice Band Ash-Greninja, respectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Cage can constantly chip down most bulkier walls and hits Celesteela hard, but Mortal Spin is generally better at chipping down walls on utility sets, which leaves Thunder Cage mostly just for Celesteela. Other offensive abilities such as Speed Boost and Good as Gold can be chosen over Fur Coat on the setup set, but this provides little defensive utility and would leave Arceus-Ghost with fewer opportunities to set up. Taunt is an option on the setup set to deny recovery and other utility such as Spikes and Topsy-Turvy, but giving up a moveslot for utility such as Knock Off or coverage is often not desirable. Plus, it either locks Arceus-Ghost into using Judgment as its only attack or means it has no recovery, both of which are very easily exploitable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Arceus-Ghost struggles against most Dark-type foes in general, especially faster attackers such as Ash-Greninja. However, they dislike switching in on Secret Sword or Knock Off especially with entry hazards up. Magic Guard Yveltal in particular, however, is a great annoyance, as it completely halts anything Arceus-Ghost can do.</p> <p><strong>Normal-type Walls</strong>: Blissey and Mega Audino handily beat setup sets via Topsy-Turvy and their immunity to Judgment, although Blissey needs to watch out for Secret Sword. Utility sets are hard stopped by Magic Guard Blissey, and even if it is not running Magic Guard, Arceus-Ghost can only make progress through Knock Off and Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Most faster threats, like Flutter Mane, Eternatus, and Mega Alakazam, threaten Arceus-Ghost out with direct damage. They can't really switch in, however.</p> <p><strong>Status Effects</strong>: Fur Coat Arceus-Ghost sets hate status, as chip damage from poison cuts heavily into its longevity, and paralysis completely cripples it. Magic Guard sets don't mind poison but still dislike paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Ice Scales + Take Heart Arceus Formes</strong>: Ice Scales Acreus amplified with Take Heart's Special Defense boosts means that all of Arceus-Ghost's attacks, including Secret Sword, will do basically no damage to these Arceus formes. Many of them also carry a Plate, which means they can easily sponge Knock Off.</p>",

Shore Up is the preferred healing move because it isn't blocked by the likes of Blissey and Mega Audino, but Strength Sap heals more HP at once and fares better against Choice Band users. Knock Off removes crucial items from walls like Heavy-Duty Boots and Covert Cloak from Mega Audino, making them susceptible to entry hazard damage or getting poisoned by Mortal Spin. Potentially removing Eviolite from Imposter users is also nice but should not be relied on, as these foes rarely want to switch in on Arceus-Ghost. Spikes takes advantage of Arceus-Ghost's conventional switch-ins, like Blissey, being passive and lacking hazard removal; alternatively, Rapid Spin and Mortal Spin provide hard-to-block hazard removal. Magic Guard is the preferred ability, as it provides an immunity to entry hazards and other chip damage such as Salt Cure and Mortal Spin, but Fur Coat makes Arceus-Ghost function as more of a wall capable of soft checking foes like Koraidon.</p> <p>Arceus-Ghost fits well on entry hazard-stacking teams, as it can easily provide item removal support and reliably block Rapid Spin. Teams that stack hazard-immune teammates also enjoy Arceus-Ghost as a Knock Off absorber. Most attackers such as Ash-Greninja or and Eternatus appreciate Arceus-Ghost stacking Spikes to wear away at their checks or, in Eternatus's case, directly damage checks like Ice Scales Arceus formes. Other teammates such as RegenVest Celesteela and Mega Audino also synergize well with Arceus-Ghost defensively alongside the occasional Imposter-proofing Arceus-Ghost can provide for them. Arceus-Ghost is particularly vulnerable to Dark-types and opposing Ghost-types that are faster such as Ash-Greninja, Yveltal, and Flutter Mane; therefore, checks to them like the aforementioned Mega Audino are valuable.</p>"

Nasty Plot provides an immediately threatening boost, letting Arceus-Ghost immediately 2HKO neutral non-Ice Scales Arceus formes without any prior chip damage. Torch Song boosts slower but damages while boosting and provides a strong tool against RegenVest Celesteela. Take Heart bolsters Arceus-Ghost's special bulk and gets rid of crippling status such as paralysis from Glare and poison from Mortal Spin, but it is not advised if not using Strength Sap or Knock Off, as Imposter users can wall Arceus-Ghost barring critical hits. Knock Off is the preferred last move, as it removes crucial items such as Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Mega Audino and Assault Vest from Celesteela. Secret Sword is an alternative that provides no support but ensures Arceus-Ghost can break through Blissey and certain Take Heart Arceus formes such as Ice Scales Arceus-Electric if running Take Heart itself.</p> <p>Arceus-Ghost best functions as both a sturdy physical wall early-game and a late-game wincon when most of its checks have been chipped down or crippled, so it pairs well with early- to mid-game wallbreakers or defensive progress-makers, such as Mega Garchomp and Spikes users like Mega Audino; Arceus-Ghost can in return help Imposter-proof them or block Rapid Spin. Arceus-Ghost enjoys entry hazard support in particular, as it forces a lot of switches after setting up, forcing quite a bit of free chip damage. Arceus-Ghost is mostly checked by Mega Audino, so another teammate that can pressure it such as Eternatus is also helpful. Arceus-Ghost should not be used as your only physical wall, as it is very vulnerable to Choice Band Ash-Greninja, and Shore Up sets can be prone to running out of PP in longer games; therefore, another physical wall such as Fur Coat Mega Audino or Fur Coat Zacian pairs well with it.</p>"

Spirit Shackle is solely for Imposter users; after trapping one, Arceus-Ground can always boost to +6 and beat it one-on-one, putting the opponent in a heavily disadvantaged position.

Earth Plate provides a damage boost to Earthquake and can't be removed with Knock Off or Trick, while Covert Cloak shuts down passive damage from Salt Cure and Mortal Spin, making boosting easier. Arceus-Ground's main drawback is that against teams with Strength Sap, Haze, or Topsy-Turvy Celesteela or Yveltal it's never sweeping; as a result, threats like Bolt Strike Mega Garchomp and Mega Lucario are useful teammates. Arceus-Ground can also struggle against Palkia-O and No Retreat Arceus-Ghost, so backup checks to them like Salt Cure users and Mega Audino help out.

Pheromosa lacks the power to beat Fur Coat users by itself, so another physical wallbreaker like Mega Garchomp is mandatory for it to be useful. Imposter-proof Pheromosa with bulky physical walls that don't mind Knock Off, like Fur Coat Arceus-Ghost.</p>"

Knock Off provides excellent utility, nullifying offensive threats by removing items like Life Orb and Choice Specs while relieving defensive Pokemon of items like Covert Cloak and Leftovers. Stone Axe helps reduce Celesteela's passivity by providing entry hazard support for teammates. Salt Cure deters Pokemon like Take Heart Arceus formes from using Celesteela as setup bait, and it deals good chip damage to Imposter users. Doom Desire is an option to support offensive teammates against walls like Mega Audino. Beak Blast punishes moves such as U-turn and deters moves like Bolt Strike and Electro Drift. Even with Assault Vest, Celesteela's natural bulk is only decent, so it requires sturdy teammates like Ice Scales Mega Audino and Ho-Oh to pivot into to help against powerful wallbreakers like Choice Specs Flutter Mane and Mega Alakazam. Celesteela's typing also leaves it vulnerable to threats like Miraidon and Fire-type coverage from Pokemon such as Eternatus, making walls like Magic Guard Blissey desirable teammates. Imposter users also pair well with Celesteela to defeat Take Heart Arceus formes after they have been hit by Salt Cure.

Knock Off annoys defensive switch-ins like Mega Audino by removing items like Covert Cloak, while Salt Cure can help rack up large amounts of passive damage and more directly threatens Imposter users. Stone Axe capitalizes on the switches Celesteela often forces by virtue of its typing by setting entry hazards, but it's notably worse against Imposter users. Recover provides reliable healing in the face of wallbreaker + Strength Sap blocker structures, while Strength Sap has higher burst healing against some teams, is easier to Imposter-proof, neutralizes Mega Garchomp, and helps versus Ash-Greninja. Rocky Helmet helps wear away at physical attackers without needing entry hazard support and throttles Ash-Greninja into spamming Wicked Blow, while Covert Cloak shuts off Salt Cure's crushing passive damage. Physical wallbreakers like Mega Garchomp appreciate Celesteela Imposter-proofing them and blocking Mortal Spin to keep hazards on the field to increase the odds of KOs. Celesteela can be vulnerable to Bolt Strike or Electro Drift users like Mega Lucario and mixed attackers like Ultra Necrozma, so sturdy walls to them like Miraidon and Ice Scales Arceus-Ground makes for good partners. Imposter-proof Celesteela with a Magic Bounce user, a Magic Guard user not deterred by burns or Knock Off like Arceus-Ghost, or a RegenVest user like Primal Kyogre.</p>"

Its servicable Attack and dangerous STAB moves such as Combat Torque and Triple Arrows also make Zamazenta less passive and actually capable of threatening certain walls out, also making it an excellent Mortal Spin user. Zamazenta's physical bulk is decent but not great, making it vulnerable to foes such as Mega Blaziken and Mega Garchomp. Zamazenta also struggles to deal any meaningful damage against foes that resist its Fighting-type STAB moves and can ignore poison from Mortal Spin like Magic Guard Arceus-Ghost or Eternatus, although it can still fish for a Combat Torque paralysis. In addition, Zamazenta is heavily prepared for by virtue of being the most versatile physical wall, which can lead to some consistency issues.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shore Up is a usable option over Strength Sap to not be deterred by specific Magic Bounce users such as Arceus-Poison but is generally not worth it due to the fact that it heals less in many situations, is unable to deter setup, and Zamazenta does not have the raw bulk to afford the lower healing. U-turn is an option over Knock Off and can provide minor chip damage and pivoting, though the value of Knock Off is much more enticing than a fast pivot. Spirit Shackle is also an option to easily self-Imposter-proof, but again, the value Knock Off gives is just too valuable. Utility Umbrella lets Zamazenta check Desolate Land Mega Blaziken, though uncommon Mega Blaziken variants like Tough Claws can still blow Zamazenta over, and Utility Umbrella provides practically no other utility.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-type foes such as Arceus-Ghost and Flutter Mane are immune to Zamazenta's STAB moves and are able to hit it hard. Many of them also commonly run Magic Guard or Covert Cloak, so Mortal Spin's poison will not affect them. However, every relevant Ghost-type is slower than Zamazenta, and they have to be aware of Knock Off's damage and item removal if said Ghost-type isn't Arceus-Ghost or Flare Boost Flutter Mane.</p> <p><strong>Poison-type Magic Bounce users</strong>: Poison-type Magic Bounce users like Arceus-Poison and Clodsire resist Zamazenta's Fighting-type moves and stop it from healing with Strength Sap while being immune to poison from Mortal Spin. Arceus-Poison can even rarely opt for a Plate, which thwarts Zamazenta's Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Take Heart users</strong>: Take Heart users such as Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Water can shrug off Mortal Spin's poison or Combat Torque's paralysis. Most of them also run Fur Coat and are slower than Zamazenta, which also means Zamazenta deals little damage while not being able to slowly chip them down with Mortal Spin.</p> <p><strong>Eternatus</strong>: Eternatus shrugs off any damage Zamazenta deals through its great bulk and Fighting resistance, though it has to mind entry hazard damage and Combat Torque's paralysis. Magic Guard sets additionally hate losing Life Orb, which makes it specifically a poor switch-in.</p> <p><strong>Mega Alakazam and Deoxys</strong>: Both of these foes are faster than Zamazenta and can OHKO it with their Psychic-type moves. They can also aggressively switch into Zamazenta sometimes, though their poor bulk means it should be treated as a last resort.</p> <p><strong>Physical attackers with super effective coverage</strong>: Certain attackers like Mega Aerodactyl and Ash-Greninja can KO Zamazenta with moves such as Brave Bird or Fleur Cannon.</p>",

Strength Sap is the preferred healing move thanks to its burst healing, which lets Zamazenta check certain threats such as Mega Garchomp; the difficulty that most Strength Sap blockers, such as Magic Guard Chansey, have switching in to Zamazenta; and its ability to neutralize physical setup.

However, Eternatus's Speed leaves it outsped by and vulnerable to several prominent threats like Miraidon and Mega Alakazam. It is also highly reliant on maintaining high HP to retain Dragon Energy's power, which, when combined with its lower initial damage output, reduces its offensive consistency.</p>",

Shell Side Arm seems odd with Eternatus's base 85 Attack, but with the Life Orb boost, it heavily pressures Blissey, an otherwise difficult wall to surmount. Torch Song compresses boosting and coverage for Steel-types like Celesteela in one slot. Strength Sap is the preferred recovery move to keep Eternatus healthy.

Eternatus also synergizes excellently with hazard-stacking compositions, as checks like Ice Scales Pokemon cannot hold both Heavy-Duty Boots to negate hazards and Covert Cloak to prevent poison from Shell Side Arm. RegenVest users like Celesteela and Dialga-O pair well with Eternatus by providing Knock Off support against opposing RegenVest users while also checking faster offensive foes like Mega Alakazam and Mega Sceptile that threaten Eternatus.

Taunt shuts off annoyances like Glare and Parting Shot, and it additionally pairs well with all last-move options; Nasty Plot + Taunt makes it a solid sweeper with the rare ability to beat Topsy-Turvy users, Spikes is especially useful due to Entrainment beating all forms of entry hazard removal and forcing switches, and Thunder Cage + Taunt allows it to trap and remove targets that lack ways to damage it through Normalize. Pixie Plate has more consistent damage, while Spooky Plate is more threatening to foes like Arceus-Ghost and Imposter users.</p> <p>Flutter Mane's best fit is on balance teams that can, depending on its set, either take advantage of its Spikes-setting ability or help pressure special walls that can beat Normalize. Ultra Necrozma makes a good candidate for its ability to threaten Arceus formes, which regularly carry Judgment, and Mega Audino with its mixed attacks. Slow pivots like RegenVest users are recommended, as Flutter Mane essentially stops working if hit with Knock Off or Mortal Spin; additionally, these Pokemon carrying Stone Axe benefit from Flutter Mane's tools to stop hazard removal and force switches. Reliable hazard removal or Wish support help Flutter Mane play more aggressively given its lack of recovery. A strong special wall like Blissey is also recommended as a check to rare Spooky Plate Imposter users, which can force Flutter Mane out. Flutter Mane's damage flatlines without its Plate, so Knock Off absorbers like Arceus formes are particularly helpful.</p>"

Knock Off removes items from common switch-ins like Mega Audino. Mortal Spin works well in combination with Thunderous Kick, poisons Imposter users, and allows Iron Hands to remove entry hazards for teammates like Ash-Greninja.

Rocky Helmet allows Iron Hands to punish Ash-Greninja's Surging Strikes and generally chip wallbreakers like Mega Lucario. Iron Hands can wall most physical threats; however, its Ground weakness necessitates a teammate that can handle Mega Garchomp and Arceus-Ground such as Celesteela or a secondary Fur Coat user such as Arceus-Ghost. Iron Hands is virtually helpless against most Arceus-Ghost sets, so a solid check to it like Mega Audino or Meloetta is useful. Imposter-proof Iron Hands with a Pokemon that can take its utility moves, such as Arceus-Ghost or Mega Audino. Offensive Imposter-proofing with Pokemon such as Ultra Necrozma is also effective.</p>"

U-turn and Knock Off are staple moves for RegenVest users. Nuzzle is primarily for Eternatus, which is otherwise difficult to punish, but if Ting-Lu can pivot into a revenge killer such as Mega Alakazam or Mega Sceptile, then Salt Cure can be opted for to annoy Take Heart Arceus formes. Stone Axe provides entry hazard support, while Mortal Spin poisons Imposter users and can act as a decent option for hazard removal, especially if paired with Salt Cure. Ting-Lu requires its Assault Vest to switch into any reasonably strong special attack it doesn't resist, so it needs secondary Knock Off absorbers like Take Heart Arceus formes and Imposter users. It is also vulnerable to threats like Flutter Mane, Palkia-O, and Ultra Necrozma with Magical Torque or Mountain Gale, so it appreciates a specially defensive teammate like Ice Scales Arceus-Fairy, and in return Ting-Lu scouts powerful attacks like Psycho Boost and Moongeist Beam.

  "Miraidon": {
    "overview": "<p>Miraidon serves as a useful utility Pokemon in the tier through its great Speed tier and typing. These traits allow Miraidon to effectively force out slower threats like Eternatus, Ultra Necrozma, and Ash-Greninja. Depending on its ability, it can act as a strong, durable offensive presence or a solid physical wall capable of checking threats like Mega Blaziken and Ash-Greninja. Thunder Cage helps Miraidon to distinguish itself from other Dragon-types by letting it run useful utility moves over coverage moves. However, due to this, Miraidon tends to rely heavily on Thunder Cage to make progress, resulting in it being thwarted by defensive pivots like Ting-Lu and Magic Guard Blissey and Chansey, the latter two also greatly limiting its recovery from Strength Sap. Miraidon is also susceptible to letting threats like Mega Gardevoir in, and Fur Coat sets are undermined by their inability to check one of the tier's most prominent physical attackers in Mega Garchomp.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Scales is a viable ability for Miraidon, allowing it to better check threats like Arceus-Steel and Sheer Force Ash-Greninja, though it cannot be the main special wall on a team due to its weakness to most prominent special wallbreakers. Miraidon's last moveslot is flexible. Torch Song compresses coverage against Steel-types and boosts Miraidon's Special Attack to potentially muscle past switch-ins like RegenVest Ting-Lu, as well as clean teams late-game. Mortal Spin pressures certain checks like Ting-Lu, but Miraidon does not pressure most Steel-types outside of Celesteela effectively enough to serve as a viable removal option. Knock Off is useful primarily to remove Assault Vests, but can also remove other items like Eviolite from Chansey and Heavy-Duty Boots, and allows Miraidon to be more potent as a support for specially offensive teammates or as a long-term wincon, especially when supported by entry hazards. Shore Up over Strength Sap can let Miraidon recover against walls like Chansey and Magic Bounce users, but it means Imposter is significantly more annoying without resorting to speed ties.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey</strong>: Chansey and Blissey have astronomical special bulk, almost always running Magic Guard to negate Thunder Cage's trapping damage, preventing Miraidon from recovering by limiting Strength Sap recovery, and greatly reducing Miraidon's Dragon Energy power with Ruination. However, non-Regenerator sets must be wary of recovering while being trapped, as Miraidon can use Encore to quickly drain recovery PP.</p> <p><strong>Clodsire</strong>: Clodsire is immune to Thunder Cage and always runs Magic Bounce, blocking Strength Sap and Encore. It cannot switch into Life Orb-boosted full-power Dragon Energy, but if Miraidon is chipped, it can fully shut Miraidon down.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types are immune to Dragon Energy and can hit Miraidon back super effectively. Ice Scales Mega Audino doesn't like taking repeated Thunder Cage chip damage long-term, but it has no issues switching in. Arceus-Fairy and Flutter Mane both have natural special bulk and recovery to take repeated Thunder Cages while retaliating with Fairy-type STAB moves. Mega Gardevoir does not want to switch in directly, but it can use Miraidon as an entry point to wallbreak.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Miraidon is susceptible to faster Pokemon that can greatly threaten it, including Mega Alakazam, Mega Sceptile, and both Zacian formes.</p> <p><strong>RegenVest Pokemon</strong>: While they cannot stay in to use utility moves like Stone Axe in fear of Encore, select RegenVest users like Registeel and Dialga-O generally can switch into Miraidon and pivot a teammate in safely, such as one of the aforementioned offensive threats. Ting-Lu deserves a special mention for being immune to Thunder Cage and is thus able to threaten Miraidon with moves like Knock Off. However, other than Registeel, the other RegenVest users cannot switch in if their Assault Vest has been removed.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Strength Sap is necessary to keep Miraidon healthy and maintain Dragon Energy's base power. Thunder Cage is excellent at forcing progress onto walls like Ice Scales Mega Audino. Dragon Energy allows Miraidon to force out Dragon-types like Eternatus and Mega Garchomp, as well as dissuading Imposter users from switching in. Encore is a fantastic utility move, allowing Miraidon to force out Arceus formes locked into Take Heart, as well as locking walls like Mega Audino and Chansey into recovery moves. It also synergizes extremely well with Thunder Cage, forcing RegenVest users like Dialga-O and Registeel to pivot out immediately if they switch in on Thunder Cage, as otherwise they would be trapped and KOed. Magic Guard negates damage from entry hazards, Salt Cure, status conditions like poison from Mortal Spin, and Life Orb recoil damage, allowing Miraidon to hit benchmarks like 2HKOing Dialga-O without Assault Vest. Alternatively, Fur Coat lets Miraidon act as a switch-in for physical attackers like Mega Blaziken and Sniper Ash-Greninja. For Fur Coat sets, Heavy-Duty Boots is usually the item of choice, though Covert Cloak lets Miraidon switch into Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and RegenVest users without fear of Mortal Spin and Salt Cure.</p> <p>Miraidon can fit on a variety of balance structures due to its role compression. It provides solid offensive pressure to supplement other wallbreakers or to act as a long-term wincon on hazard stack teams; the Magic Guard set naturally fits on the latter thanks to its immunity to entry hazards. For the former, special attackers like Mega Gardevoir appreciate Miraidon pressuring shared special walls like Ice Scales Mega Audino and RegenVest Registeel, while for the latter, Spikes setters like Arceus-Ghost and Flutter Mane pair well with it. Both can also help pressure Chansey and Blissey. Imposter users and RegenVest Pokemon like Ting-Lu can often trade Knock Offs against opposing RegenVest Pokemon like Dialga-O and Ting-Lu, allowing Miraidon to break past them. RegenVest users also can provide Stone Axe support to capitalize on the switches Miraidon's Thunder Cage can force, as well as safely pivoting in Encore sets against setup Pokemon like Take Heart Arceus formes. Fur Coat Miraidon cannot check Mega Garchomp, requiring either a second Fur Coat user or alternative switch-ins to Mega Garchomp's STAB moves, such as Levitate Steel-types and physically defensive Regenerator Pokemon like Mega Slowbro or Ting-Lu. Encore can make Miraidon tricky to Imposter-proof without somewhat niche sets like Regenerator Blissey or Magic Bounce Clodsire; utility Flutter Mane sets cannot be trapped and have good special bulk to take Thunder Cage while retaliating with utility moves or Fairy-type STAB moves. Pivots such as Chansey, Blissey, and RegenVest users can safely bring in offensive checks like Mega Gardevoir and Flutter Mane, with Chansey and Blissey also denying Imposter recovery, while Ground-types like Ting-Lu and Mega Swampert are immune to trapping from Thunder Cage.</p>"
