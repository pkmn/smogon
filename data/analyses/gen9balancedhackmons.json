        "description": "<p>Thanks to Light Ball, Pikachu is a niche Imposter user that can break past less-sturdy Imposter-proofers, although it forgoes defensive utility in exchange. When Pikachu transforms, only the ability, item, and HP EVs listed here matter. The listed moves, non-HP EVs, and nature will very rarely see use: since Pikachu outspeeds all other Imposter users like Chansey, it is extremely rare that Pikachu is not transformed. Nevertheless, Volt Switch provides a reasonably strong pivoting option against opposing transformed Imposter users, which cause Pikachu's Imposter to fail, while Glare can paralyze threats to aid Pikachu later on. Healing Wish and Spikes both provide some utility if Pikachu is no longer needed. Since Pikachu is extremely frail, it can easily fall to any strong move from opposing threats it wants to transform into. Therefore, significant team support is needed to realize its potential. Paralysis spam through Nuzzle and Glare ensures Pikachu always outspeeds opposing threats like Mega Mewtwo X, and it can also generate free turns. Knock Off invalidates Pikachu, so Knock Off absorbers, such as Arceus with a held Plate are recommended. Bulky special walls like Ice Scales Arceus-Ground and Ho-Oh check Mega Diancie and Arceus-Ghost, which Pikachu cannot safely transform into: the former can OHKO with Extreme Speed, and the latter Imposter-proofs itself.</p>"

This provides a myriad of benefits, including blanket checking most Pokemon, scouting sets, and PP stalling less threatening foes. These traits make Imposter Chansey a valuable addition to almost every team. The given moves offer the most utility in the rare situations Chansey is not transformed, allowing it to Imposter-proof certain special attackers and act as a cleric. While Eviolite is usually the best item, Covert Cloak is useful against Spirit Shackle and Salt Cure users, and Spooky Plate allows Chansey to threaten Arceus-Ghost and Lunala that would otherwise defeat it with Judgment. Offensive threats such as Ultra Necrozma appreciate the information Imposter Chansey provides through scouting; physical attackers in particular highly appreciate moves like Burning Bulwark being discovered. Special attackers enjoy Imposter Chansey taking advantage of RegenVest users and potentially Imposter-proofing them. Imposter Chansey appreciates slow pivoting from Pokemon like Celesteela and Mega Steelix so it can safely scout. Specially defensive Pokemon like Ice Scales Arceus formes and Magic Guard Blissey can serve as checks to opposing Take Heart Arceus formes, which can beat Imposter Chansey one-on-one, while also checking Dragon-type attackers like Eternatus and Miraidon that can hit it hard.</p>"

Ruination is a way to make near-guaranteed progress barring a miss, and its consistent damage mitigates Blissey's otherwise-crippling passivity. Topsy-Turvy deters setup attempts from Take Heart and Nasty Plot users by inverting their boosts and likely forcing a switch, in which case Blissey can then pivot out with Teleport or Parting Shot. Blissey's ability to deny Strength Sap healing makes it a great pick on balance teams carrying physical attackers such as Mega Lucario, as Fur Coat walls with Strength Sap usually can't get past Blissey, and physical attackers can force Imposter users out if they switch in while Blissey is pivoting. Blissey's immense frailty means that reliable physical walls, such as Mega Slowbro, are mandatory to cover for it; Arceus-Ghost can also bypass Blissey with either Secret Sword or Triple Arrows, so Yveltal makes for a good teammate.

Ruination reduces Blissey's passivity, though Salt Cure is an alternative that can be more effective into Pokemon like Celesteela and Flare Boost Flutter Mane. Clear Smog, Topsy-Turvy, and Glare prevent Blissey from being setup fodder, with the latter being particularly useful against Magic Guard Eternatus and Imposter users, while Stone Axe provides utility if setup control is not necessary. Assault Vest further amplifies Blissey's Special Defense against powerful wallbreakers like Mega Alakazam that could otherwise outdamage Regenerator healing, while Heavy-Duty Boots prevents entry hazard damage and allows Blissey to access the aforementioned status moves. Blissey pairs incredibly well with very fast offensive Pokemon like Mega Alakazam and Mega Sceptile, as it provides slow pivoting, Wish support to offset residual damage for Mega Alakazam and allow Mega Sceptile to forgo Strength Sap, and healing denial against special walls like Ice Scales Arceus formes, while they revenge-kill numerous threats that Blissey can pivot into, especially those that Blissey cannot beat by itself such as Eternatus and Flare Boost Flutter Mane. Strong physical attackers also work well, as they can offensively Imposter-proof Blissey without conceding momentum; particularly, Ash-Greninja can pick off chipped Ice Scales Arceus formes. Blissey cannot handle certain special attackers like Psystrike Mega Alakazam, Shell Side Arm Eternatus, and various Secret Sword users, mandating a secondary special wall like Ice Scales users.

Volt Tackle's very high PP and good damage output are excellent, as they allow Ho-Oh to both fish for paralysis on threats like Imposter users and also deal hefty damage, notably ensuring that Mega Slowbro can't wall it long-term. Swords Dance bolsters these moves even further, notably allowing V-create to OHKO neutral Arceus formes and Volt Tackle to 2HKO Mega Slowbro, in addition to preventing Imposter users and faster Pokemon like Eternatus and from permanently walling Ho-Oh with Strength Sap; alternatively, Headlong Rush allows Ho-Oh to hit foes like Eternatus and Fire-immune Steel-types like Registeel super effectively. Magic Guard Ho-Oh best fits on balance teams looking for a bulky setup attacker that wears down common walls and can potentially sweep late-game. Dragon-types are a notable thorn in Ho-Oh's side, particularly ones that use Strength Sap like Eternatus, so an ally that blocks Strength Sap like Magic Guard Blissey is a valuable teammate. Ho-Oh's damage potential also tanks without its Life Orb, so a Knock Off absorber like an Arceus forme is useful.

Doom Desire can enable attackers that struggle to break through Fairy-type walls like Mega Garchomp and Ash-Greninja due to their one-sided wallbreaking nature shoehorning your opponent into specific response patterns; alternatively, Draco Meteor threatens Miraidon and Eternatus. Additionally, Revelation Dance + Draco Meteor hits both Flutter Mane and Dragon-type attackers, but Dialga-O can't provide Doom Desire support if this combination is run. Replacing either move with Doom Desire forces you to pick what Dialga-O can and can't beat, but it's still able to pivot into a teammate that takes care of foes that it struggles with. Knock Off removes key items such as Assault Vest from RegenVest Mega Steelix, Salt Cure heavily deters Steel-types that would otherwise endlessly wall Dialga-O, Rapid Spin acts as decent entry hazard removal, and Stone Axe can be used as a reliable way to set entry hazards. A Quiet nature is recommended for Revelation Dance to potentially KO Flutter Mane after three turns of burn damage and Draco Meteor to OHKO Miraidon, but a Sassy nature provides greater safety against threats like Mega Alakazam. Teammates that struggle to break through Fairy-types appreciate Dialga-O hitting them with Doom Desire, as mentioned previously, along with the slow pivoting it provides. Teammates vulnerable to Thunder Cage and Mortal Spin like Mega Slowbro also appreciate Dialga-O checking users of these moves.

    "overview": "<p>Arceus-Ghost is one of the most defining centerpieces of Balanced Hackmons thanks to its built-in self Imposter-proofing due to Spooky Plate + Judgment that allows it to run Shore Up without worrying about Imposter, good bulk, great offensive typing, and versatility. It is able to soft check a lot of would-be annoyances such as RegenVest Celesteela without Nuzzle and Mega Lucario depending on its ability. Its ability to block Rapid Spin also differentiates it from other Arceus formes. However, Arceus-Ghost can be hard walled rather easily by certain walls such as Mega Audino and Meloetta. Its low immediate damage output can also lead to fast offensive threats like Eternatus forcing it out. Its ability choice of Magic Guard or Fur Coat also mean it either has limited defensive presence or is a physical wall that's weak to Choice Band Ash-Greninja, respectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Cage can constantly chip down most bulkier walls and hits Celesteela hard, but Mortal Spin is generally better at chipping down walls on utility sets, which leaves Thunder Cage mostly just for Celesteela. Other offensive abilities such as Speed Boost and Good as Gold can be chosen over Fur Coat on the setup set, but this provides little defensive utility and would leave Arceus-Ghost with fewer opportunities to set up. Taunt is an option on the setup set to deny recovery and other utility such as Spikes and Topsy-Turvy, but giving up a moveslot for utility such as Knock Off or coverage is often not desirable. Plus, it either locks Arceus-Ghost into using Judgment as its only attack or means it has no recovery, both of which are very easily exploitable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Arceus-Ghost struggles against most Dark-type foes in general, especially faster attackers such as Ash-Greninja. However, they dislike switching in on Secret Sword or Knock Off especially with entry hazards up. Magic Guard Yveltal in particular, however, is a great annoyance, as it completely halts anything Arceus-Ghost can do.</p> <p><strong>Normal-type Walls</strong>: Blissey and Mega Audino handily beat setup sets via Topsy-Turvy and their immunity to Judgment, although Blissey needs to watch out for Secret Sword. Utility sets are hard stopped by Magic Guard Blissey, and even if it is not running Magic Guard, Arceus-Ghost can only make progress through Knock Off and Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Most faster threats, like Flutter Mane, Eternatus, and Mega Alakazam, threaten Arceus-Ghost out with direct damage. They can't really switch in, however.</p> <p><strong>Status Effects</strong>: Fur Coat Arceus-Ghost sets hate status, as chip damage from poison cuts heavily into its longevity, and paralysis completely cripples it. Magic Guard sets don't mind poison but still dislike paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Ice Scales + Take Heart Arceus Formes</strong>: Ice Scales Acreus amplified with Take Heart's Special Defense boosts means that all of Arceus-Ghost's attacks, including Secret Sword, will do basically no damage to these Arceus formes. Many of them also carry a Plate, which means they can easily sponge Knock Off.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Arceus-Ghost can provide very consistent utility to its team with its immunity to item removal and built in self-Imposter-proofing through Judgment. Shore Up is the preferred healing move because it isn't blocked by the likes of Blissey and Mega Audino, but Strength Sap heals more HP at once and fares better against Choice Band users. Knock Off removes crucial items from walls like Heavy-Duty Boots and Covert Cloak from Mega Audino, making them susceptible to entry hazard damage or getting poisoned by Mortal Spin. Potentially removing Eviolite from Imposter users is also nice but should not be relied on, as these foes rarely want to switch in on Arceus-Ghost. Spikes takes advantage of Arceus-Ghost's conventional switch-ins, like Blissey, being passive and lacking hazard removal; alternatively, Rapid Spin and Mortal Spin provide hard-to-block hazard removal. Magic Guard is the preferred ability, as it provides an immunity to entry hazards and other chip damage such as Salt Cure and Mortal Spin, but Fur Coat makes Arceus-Ghost function as more of a wall capable of soft checking foes like Koraidon.</p> <p>Arceus-Ghost fits well on entry hazard-stacking teams, as it can easily provide item removal support and reliably block Rapid Spin. Teams that stack hazard-immune teammates also enjoy Arceus-Ghost as a Knock Off absorber. Most attackers such as Ash-Greninja or and Eternatus appreciate Arceus-Ghost stacking Spikes to wear away at their checks or, in Eternatus's case, directly damage checks like Ice Scales Arceus formes. Other teammates such as RegenVest Celesteela and Mega Audino also synergize well with Arceus-Ghost defensively alongside the occasional Imposter-proofing Arceus-Ghost can provide for them. Arceus-Ghost is particularly vulnerable to Dark-types and opposing Ghost-types that are faster such as Ash-Greninja, Yveltal, and Flutter Mane; therefore, checks to them like the aforementioned Mega Audino are valuable.</p>"

      "Setup Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Setup Arceus-Ghost acts as a fairly dangerous Imposter-proof sweeper that can also function as a bulky physical wall. Shore Up provides consistent recovery and isn't stopped by Strength Sap blockers like Blissey and Mega Audino, the latter of which Arceus-Ghost can't feasibly threaten; alternatively, Strength Sap has higher instant healing and makes it much more solid against physical attackers and Imposter users. Nasty Plot provides an immediately threatening boost, letting Arceus-Ghost immediately 2HKO neutral non-Ice Scales Arceus formes without any prior chip damage. Torch Song boosts slower but damages while boosting and provides a strong tool against RegenVest Celesteela. Take Heart bolsters Arceus-Ghost's special bulk and gets rid of crippling status such as paralysis from Glare and poison from Mortal Spin, but it is not advised if not using Strength Sap or Knock Off, as Imposter users can wall Arceus-Ghost barring critical hits. Knock Off is the preferred last move, as it removes crucial items such as Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Mega Audino and Assault Vest from Celesteela. Secret Sword is an alternative that provides no support but ensures Arceus-Ghost can break through Blissey and certain Take Heart Arceus formes such as Ice Scales Arceus-Electric if running Take Heart itself.</p> <p>Arceus-Ghost best functions as both a sturdy physical wall early-game and a late-game wincon when most of its checks have been chipped down or crippled, so it pairs well with early- to mid-game wallbreakers or defensive progress-makers, such as Mega Garchomp and Spikes users like Mega Audino; Arceus-Ghost can in return help Imposter-proof them or block Rapid Spin. Arceus-Ghost enjoys entry hazard support in particular, as it forces a lot of switches after setting up, forcing quite a bit of free chip damage. Arceus-Ghost is mostly checked by Mega Audino, so another teammate that can pressure it such as Eternatus is also helpful. Arceus-Ghost should not be used as your only physical wall, as it is very vulnerable to Choice Band Ash-Greninja, and Shore Up sets can be prone to running out of PP in longer games; therefore, another physical wall such as Fur Coat Mega Audino or Fur Coat Zacian pairs well with it.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Ice Scales Arceus-Ground fills a valuable niche as a special wall, self-Imposter-proof setup sweeper, and entry hazard remover; its Ground typing also offers a useful immunity to Thunder Cage and Volt Switch. Tidy Up supplements a strong Earthquake and allows Arceus-Ground to sweep late-game when its checks like Celesteela and Yveltal have been removed. Spirit Shackle is solely for Imposter users; after trapping one, Arceus-Ground can always boost to +6 and beat it one-on-one, putting the opponent in a heavily disadvantaged position. Strength Sap is necessary for Arceus-Ground to Imposter-proof itself, and it usually heals for more than Recover; Arceus-Ground being a physical attacker also prevents the bane of most Ice Scales Arceus formes, Magic Guard Blissey, from denying it healing. Earth Plate provides a damage boost to Earthquake and can't be removed with Knock Off or Trick, while Covert Cloak shuts down passive damage from Salt Cure and Mortal Spin, making boosting easier. Arceus-Ground's main drawback is that against teams with Strength Sap, Haze, or Topsy-Turvy Celesteela or Yveltal it's never sweeping; as a result, threats like Bolt Strike Mega Garchomp and Mega Lucario are useful teammates. Arceus-Ground can also struggle against Palkia-O and No Retreat Arceus-Ghost, so backup checks to them like Salt Cure users and Mega Audino help out. Arceus-Ground can almost always Imposter-proof itself thanks to Spirit Shackle, but if it's badly poisoned or if the Imposter user has a Covert Cloak, then some physical tank like Mega Slowbro or Yveltal can fulfil this role.</p>"

Its Special Defense also means it doesn't instantly fold to Electro Drift coverage, while the aforementioned Water-types are both OHKOed by any Tough Claws user with it. Fur Coat allows Arceus-Water to wall threats like Mega Garchomp and Ash-Greninja, albeit needing a Bold nature to dodge a potential 2HKO from Ash-Greninja's Flower Trick, while Ice Scales takes advantage of Water's lack of weaknesses to common special moves to serve as a decent answer to the likes of Mega Alakazam and Eternatus. Scald threatens burns on Pokemon like Mega Lucario and defensive switch-ins like RegenVest users. Due to Arceus-Water's weakness to Thunder Cage, Spirit Shackle is the safest option for Fur Coat variants to Imposter-proof themselves. Spirit Shackle variants can utilize Shore Up to not have recovery denied by Magic Guard Blissey. Covert Cloak is necessary to prevent Salt Cure's passive damage. Fur Coat variants still takes a lot of damage from coverage options like Electro Drift and Ash-Greninja's Flower Trick, so backup checks to these like Dragon-types and Fur Coat Fairy-types help. Ice Scales variants similarly can be pressured by strong moves such as Mega Alakazam's Psycho Boost, so having RegenVest teammates to scout for moves can be useful.

Psystrike has high damage output against Flutter Mane and Blissey, more than negating the drawback of its damage being cut by both Fur Coat and Ice Scales. Block traps opposing Imposter users, deters Mega Alakazam from spamming Blue Flare to burn recovery PP, and threatens to trap and eliminate Take Heart Arceus formes. Topsy-Turvy shuts down setup attackers such as Take Heart Arceus formes, Torch Song Dragon-types, and No Retreat Lunala. Covert Cloak blocks a myriad of secondary effects like Eternatus's poison, while Leftovers helps offset chip damage from entry hazards and Thunder Cage. Meloetta is incredibly passive and cannot touch any Pokemon with recovery and without very poor Defense, requiring teammates such as Take Heart Arceus formes and Magic Guard users to minimize momentum loss. Due to not resisting Dragon, it can be pressured by strong Dragon Energy users such as Eternatus and Miraidon, making Steel- and Fairy-type Pokemon like Magearna and Arceus-Fairy helpful teammates. Meloetta's vulnerability to all forms of entry hazards as well as its tendency to get worn down by neutral special attacks can quickly drain recovery PP, so it highly appreciates teammates that provide reliable hazard removal, such as Mortal Spin RegenVest Pokemon and Tidy Up users.</p>"

Revelation Dance hits Fur Coat Arceus-Ghost hard, which can otherwise wall and spinblock Yveltal. Topsy-Turvy halts boosting threats and minimizes Simple Arceus-Ghost's ability to badger Yveltal with secondary effects. Teleport provides a pivoting option, helping offset Yveltal's tendency to lure in Arceus formes that can sponge Knock Off, while Rapid Spin clears entry hazards for its team and partners well with Revelation Dance. Yveltal's main use is on balance teams looking for an easy option to counter Simple Ghost-types that the rest of the team aren't equipped for. Rapid Spin Yveltal alone isn't typically reliable hazard removal in longer games, so a second removal option like a RegenVest user with Mortal Spin is recommended. Yveltal also tends to be Imposter bait; its only deterrent is Knock Off removing the Imposter user's Eviolite, which in slower games can be forgone in favor of making Yveltal a free Recover window, so allies that can directly harm the Imposter user like Ruination or Mortal Spin users are useful.</p>"

Zacian-C enjoys having teammates that use Nuzzle or Glare to paralyze Imposter users or Mega Alakazam, which is naturally faster than Zacian-C, as well having a teammate like Ice Scales Mega Audino or Ho-Oh that can help more reliably check Mega Alakazam. Zacian-C can be Impostor-proofed by Mega Swampert, Fur Coat Miraidon, and Mega Slowbro depending on its coverage moves.</p>"

Magical Torque and Gigaton Hammer can force switches against opposing offensive foes like Ash-Greninja and Flutter Mane, giving Zacian-C opportunities to set Spikes. The last moveslot can also be switched with either Spirit Shackle, removing Imposter entirely; Knock Off, removing important items from physical walls like Covert Cloak from Mega Slowbro and Celesteela; or Taunt, denying recovery and Spikes from these walls. Most wallbreakers, especially Magic Guard Eternatus, Ash-Greninja, and Koraidon, appreciate Zacian-C setting hazards and blocking Mortal Spin, or the other utility Zacian-C offers such as removing Imposter or items, along with the occasional Imposter-proofing Zacian-C can provide with its typing. Zacian-C's typing means that Eternatus that run Fire-type moves is a problem for it, so a check like RegenVest Primal Kyogre is recommended. Zacian-C's inability to hold Covert Cloak means a Covert Cloak Steel-type like Celesteela can provide additional fortitude against Mortal Spin. Zacian-C can be Imposter-proofed by neutral Fur Coat users or Steel-types with hazard removal like Mega Slowbro or RegenVest Mega Steelix if it's running Spikes or Taunt, Fur Coat Arceus formes holding a Plate if it's running Knock Off, or itself if it's running Spirit Shackle.</p>"

  "Eternatus": {
    "overview": "<p>Eternatus is one of the most splashable and defining Pokemon in BH, capable of filling offensive and defensive roles through its excellent stat distribution, crucially outspeeding Arceus. Its Poison typing provides a crucial neutrality to Fairy and allows Eternatus to hit some of the most common specially defensive walls like Mega Audino super effectively, while its Dragon typing and naturally high HP allows it to heavily deter Imposter users from switching in. As a result, its Magic Guard set is one of the most defining offensive sets in the metagame, exerting strong pressure while retaining remarkably solid defensive capabilities. It can also serve a more defensive role with sets using Unaware or Regenerator that can blanket check a variety of setup users through its bulk, Speed, and typing that aids against common forms of passive damage, like poison and Thunder Cage. However, Eternatus's Speed leaves it outsped by and vulnerable to several prominent threats like Miraidon and Mega Alakazam. It is also highly reliant on maintaining high HP to retain Dragon Energy's power, which, when combined with its lower initial damage output, reduces its offensive consistency.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>For the Magic Guard set, Final Gambit is a niche alternative on more offensive teams or when coupled with Wish support as an option to clear out special walls for teammates like Mega Sceptile. Secret Sword is another niche alternative over Shell Side Arm or Strength Sap that hits Blissey and Chansey significantly harder and allows use of a stronger Poison-type STAB move like Malignant Chain, but it doesn't offer much else. Mold Breaker lets Eternatus bypass Well-Baked Body and Ice Scales to aid in wallbreaking, but the vulnerability to passive damage cuts into Dragon Energy's power much easier, it provides less defensive value, and Mold Breaker still can't beat Primordial Sea. Regenerator sets, sometimes with Choice Scarf, act as a decent pivot against threats like Mega Blaziken and Ash-Greninja and can provide utility through Spikes and Trick, although its offensive potential is low. A Fur Coat set seems appealing to act as a check to physical attackers like Sniper Ash-Greninja and Mega Blaziken, but it can be overwhelmed by the former after minor chip damage and has a glaring weakness to Mega Garchomp, rendering it mostly outclassed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Eternatus is very dependent on its Speed to function, making paralysis severely crippling and heavily reducing its offensive and defensive potential.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: Attackers like Mega Sceptile and Mega Alakazam outspeed and can OHKO Eternatus.</p> <p><strong>Fire-immune Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types with abilities that snuff Torch Song, such as Well-Baked Body or Primordial Sea Solgaleo and Arceus-Steel, are nigh immovable for Eternatus. Notably, Magearna with one of these abilities is immune to all of Eternatus's standard moves.</p> <p><strong>Ice Scales Walls</strong>: Select Ice Scales Pokemon such as Meloetta and Arceus-Ground shrug off Eternatus's attacks and can retaliate with super effective STAB moves, and unlike Blissey, they can safely withstand Shell Side Arm. However, they must hold Covert Cloak to prevent poison, as Arceus-Ground struggles to fit Take Heart, rendering them susceptible to repeated chip damage from entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey's respectable physical bulk with Eviolite, in contrast to Blissey, allows it to comfortably handle Eternatus and notably deny recovery from Strength Sap.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Magic Guard Eternatus is a setup attacker that is difficult to wear down that differentiates itself from other similar attackers like Mega Sceptile and Miraidon through its ability to easily pressure Fairy-types and Blissey without losing a recovery move. Magic Guard makes Eternatus incredibly difficult to chip down, helping maintain Dragon Energy's power, and it also negates recoil from Life Orb, giving Eternatus a much-needed damage boost. Shell Side Arm seems odd with Eternatus's base 85 Attack, but with the Life Orb boost, it heavily pressures Blissey, an otherwise difficult wall to surmount. Torch Song compresses boosting and coverage for Steel-types like Celesteela in one slot. Strength Sap is the preferred recovery move to keep Eternatus healthy. A Naive nature ensures Eternatus outspeeds the Arceus formes and Ultra Necrozma, and it is opted over a Hasty nature, as it helps against attacks from Pokemon like Mega Blaziken and RegenVest users as well as increasing damage dealt to Imposter users with Dragon Energy.</p> <p>Magic Guard Eternatus fits on a variety of team structures thanks to its splashability. Thanks to Magic Guard, this set fits naturally on entry hazard-resilient teams as a source of offensive pressure, and it works well with other Magic Guard attackers like Mega Sceptile and Ultra Necrozma to overload their shared checks like Fire-immune Steel-types. Eternatus also synergizes excellently with hazard-stacking compositions, as checks like Ice Scales Pokemon cannot hold both Heavy-Duty Boots to negate hazards and Covert Cloak to prevent poison from Shell Side Arm. RegenVest users like Celesteela and Dialga-O pair well with Eternatus by providing Knock Off support against opposing RegenVest users while also checking faster offensive foes like Mega Alakazam and Mega Sceptile that threaten Eternatus. They can also sometimes provide paralysis support against Imposter users, rendering them useless against Eternatus. Blissey and Chansey can provide Wish support to help keep Eternatus healthy and allow it to forgo Strength Sap, and they also limit Strength Sap recovery from opposing Take Heart Arceus formes, helping Eternatus break through them easier. Eternatus also appreciates Knock Off absorbers like the Arceus formes and some aforementioned RegenVest Pokemon, as it is reliant on Life Orb for a significant amount of its damage output. Eternatus can be Imposter-proofed easily by Eviolite Chansey, either with Imposter + Jungle Healing or Heal Bell or with Magic Guard; other options include Fire-immune Steel-types and Take Heart Ice Scales Pokemon like the Arceus formes.</p>"

Strength Sap is the preferred recovery option to also slow down setup sweepers like Mega Garchomp, but Shore Up cannot be blocked by Magic Bounce or be limited by Pokemon like Blissey. Dondozo's extremely low Speed also makes it a great pivot capable of underspeeding common defensive staples like Parting Shot Mega Audino. Glare cripples all physical attackers excluding Jungle Healing users as well as deterring most special wallbreakers, while Knock Off provides support by removing crucial items like Assault Vest. Stone Axe and Spikes help reduce Dondozo's passivity against Teleport users and Take Heart Arceus formes. Covert Cloak prevents annoying secondary effects from moves like Salt Cure and Mortal Spin, which is valuable because Dondozo can be 2HKOed by coverage moves after slight chip damage; alternatively, Rocky Helmet punishes otherwise safe U-turns and prevents foes like Mega Garchomp from simply PP stalling Dondozo's healing. Dondozo cannot answer mixed threats such as Electro Drift Mega Garchomp, and thus checks to these Pokemon such as Fur Coat Arceus-Ghost are good teammates. Powerful special wallbreakers like Mega Alakazam and Mega Sceptile appreciate the slow pivoting and entry hazards Dondozo provides and in return can offensively Imposter-proof Dondozo.

  "Flutter Mane": {
    "overview": "<p>Flutter Mane is an effective fast attacker. A Ghost typing and good Speed let it effectively use Normalize + Entrainment as a disruption tool, while more offensive sets can benefit from Moongeist Beam for high damage against Ice Scales users like Arceus-Fairy; Normalize in particular makes Flutter Mane an effective entry hazard setter and check to setup threats like Eternatus and some Take Heart Arceus formes. Flutter Mane also benefits from low Attack and HP, the latter of which makes Pain Split a solid choice on utility sets that lets it chunk Blissey for good damage, and decent Special Defense lets it trade damage&amp;mdash?albeit with a high cost—against faster foes like Mega Sceptile. However, Flutter Mane's offensive profile is notably throttled by Mega Audino and Blissey, two very common walls that Flutter Mane struggles to break through. It also suffers from weaknesses to common status moves like Glare and Topsy-Turvy that can stall its progress, and it, in many cases, is forced to make risky decisions thanks to said status move weakness. Flutter Mane's weak Defense also means it can't afford to stay in on stray hits like Flip Turn much, either.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flutter Mane's immunities to Dragon and Fighting mean it can potentially use immunity abilities like Well-Baked Body and Levitate to hard-wall Pokemon like Mega Blaziken and Mega Garchomp; however, this eats into damage output, making Magic Bounce users much more problematic. Flutter Mane can potentially use a Choice Specs set with either Beads of Ruin or Pixilate, but its damage falls short of competitors like Mega Alakazam, and it now struggles much more against RegenVest users. Flare Boost sets can act as potent sweepers with Nasty Plot and a built-in status immunity, but these suffer from high rates of residual damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Revelation Dance and Judgment</strong>: These moves bypass Normalize, meaning that Flutter Mane essentially can't set up in front of them. Ice Scales Arceus formes also benefit from Flutter Mane still needing to use Entrainment to do meaningful damage.</p> <p><strong>Dialga-O</strong>: Dialga-O will always be carrying Revelation Dance or Doom Desire, both of which force Flutter Mane out and beat Normalize sets. It also commonly uses Assault Vest.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: All Flutter Mane sets simply stop working when paralyzed; Normalize sets also falter to burn and poison. Common users also tend to carry moves like Ruination, like Chansey and Blissey, forcing Flutter Mane into unfavorable situations.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types</strong>: Mega Audino, Blissey, and Meloetta all largely shut down Flutter Mane's direct damage and consistently carry Topsy-Turvy to offset Nasty Plot boosts. They tend to be fodder for Spikes, however, and only sparingly use Glare.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce</strong>: Magic Bounce users like Mega Audino blank most of Flutter Mane's utility.</p>",

Judgment both ignores Normalize and allows Flutter Mane to attack with a STAB-boosted move without Imposter users being able to. Taunt shuts off annoyances like Glare and Parting Shot, and it additionally pairs well with all last-move options; Nasty Plot + Taunt makes it a solid sweeper with the rare ability to beat Topsy-Turvy users, Spikes is especially useful due to Entrainment beating all forms of entry hazard removal and forcing switches, and Thunder Cage + Taunt allows it to trap and remove targets that lack ways to damage it through Normalize. Pixie Plate has more consistent damage, while Spooky Plate is more threatening to foes like Arceus-Ghost and Imposter users.</p> <p>Flutter Mane's best fit is on balance teams that can, depending on its set, either take advantage of its Spikes-setting ability or help pressure special walls that can beat Normalize. Ultra Necrozma makes a good candidate for its ability to threaten Arceus formes, which regularly carry Judgment, and Mega Audino with its mixed attacks. Slow pivots like RegenVest users are recommended, as Flutter Mane essentially stops working if hit with Knock Off or Mortal Spin; additionally, these Pokemon carrying Stone Axe benefit from Flutter Mane's tools to stop hazard removal and force switches. Reliable hazard removal or Wish support help Flutter Mane play more aggressively given its lack of recovery. A strong special wall like Blissey is also recommended as a check to rare Spooky Plate Imposter users, which can force Flutter Mane out. Flutter Mane's damage flatlines without its Plate, so Knock Off absorbers like Arceus formes are particularly helpful.</p>"

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to a combination of its great stat distribution and typing, this set turns Flutter Mane into an exceptional utility Pokemon capable of exerting long-term pressure.

Alternatively, Magic Guard mitigates Life Orb recoil, poison damage, and entry hazard damage, while Teravolt allows Flutter Mane to bypass Ice Scales and Magic Bounce. Pain Split synergizes phenomenally with Flutter Mane's low HP stat by allowing it to annoy common high-HP Pokemon like Eternatus, Blissey, and Chansey while also preventing Imposter users from freely recovering. Flutter Mane is an excellent Spikes setter with its solid longevity and many opportunities to switch in, and Spikes allows it to guarantee progress against more passive special walls like Mega Audino and Blissey. Astral Barrage gives Flutter Mane a way to severely threaten Arceus-Ghost and Solgaleo, and it further dissuades Imposter users. Knock Off is a great option to remove Assault Vest and Heavy-Duty Boots from checks, but it can be annoying to Imposter-proof. Topsy-Turvy provides more defensive utility, allowing Flutter Mane to handle boosting special attackers like Arceus formes easier. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Flutter Mane to ignore hazard damage, while Covert Cloak is useful against secondary effects from common moves like Mortal Spin and Nuzzle.</p> <p>Utility Flutter Mane works well on balanced structures, though it can also perform on more offensive teams.

Flutter Mane fits naturally into entry hazard-stacking and hazard-resilient compositions; the former appreciates its strong Spikes-setting capabilities and utility from Knock Off, while the latter eases the Imposter-proofing by being able to ignore Spikes from Imposter users. As a Spikes setter, Flutter Mane appreciates Steel-type teammates like Celesteela, Dialga-O, and Solgaleo that can block Mortal Spin and complement it defensively by switching into checks like Arceus-Steel. Imposter users generally dislike switching into Flutter Mane, but it still requires an Imposter-proof teammate such as Ho-Oh, Arceus-Steel, or RegenVest Celesteela depending on the moveset.</p>"
