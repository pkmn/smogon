        "description": "<p>Thanks to Light Ball, Pikachu is a niche Imposter user that can break past less-sturdy Imposter-proofers, although it forgoes defensive utility in exchange. When Pikachu transforms, only the ability, item, and HP EVs listed here matter. The listed moves, non-HP EVs, and nature will very rarely see use: since Pikachu outspeeds all other Imposter users like Chansey, it is extremely rare that Pikachu is not transformed. Nevertheless, Volt Switch provides a reasonably strong pivoting option against opposing transformed Imposter users, which cause Pikachu's Imposter to fail, while Glare can paralyze threats to aid Pikachu later on. Healing Wish and Spikes both provide some utility if Pikachu is no longer needed. Since Pikachu is extremely frail, it can easily fall to any strong move from opposing threats it wants to transform into. Therefore, significant team support is needed to realize its potential. Paralysis spam through Nuzzle and Glare ensures Pikachu always outspeeds opposing threats like Mega Mewtwo X, and it can also generate free turns. Knock Off invalidates Pikachu, so Knock Off absorbers, such as Arceus with a held Plate are recommended. Bulky special walls like Ice Scales Arceus-Ground and Ho-Oh check Mega Diancie and Arceus-Ghost, which Pikachu cannot safely transform into: the former can OHKO with Extreme Speed, and the latter Imposter-proofs itself.</p>"

  "Chansey": {
    "overview": "<p>Imposter Chansey is the single most defining set in BH. With astronomical HP that is preserved after transforming compounded with a potential Eviolite boost, it can turn into a significantly bulkier version of the foe, making it a blanket check to most offensive Pokemon. Defensive Pokemon are not safe either, as without proper teambuilding, Imposter users can take advantage of their enormous bulk to become incredibly difficult to punish, allowing them to utilize the constant PP Imposter can provide to stall out the foes. As a result of these traits, every team must Imposter-proof: be well prepared for and carry responses to all of its own Pokemon. Imposter also provides invaluable scouting information in a tier where anything is possible to allow the player to make more informed decisions. Additionally, Imposter Chansey and Blissey provide role compression by Imposter-proofing some special attackers when not transformed. However, every competent team will prepare carefully for Imposter, limiting its effectiveness; examples of common generally Imposter-resilient sets include Plate + Judgment users like Arceus-Ghost and Thunder Cage + Strength Sap users like Arceus-Electric. Imposter users also dislike the metagame having an abundance of offensive Pokemon such as Eternatus and Mega Garchomp that are weak to their own STAB moves, reducing their defensive utility and making them more difficult to fit on teams.</p> <p>Alternatively, non-Imposter Chansey utilizes its astronomical special bulk and respectable physical bulk with Eviolite to serve as a strong special wall capable of answering threats like Eternatus and Take Heart Arceus formes. It differentiates itself from Blissey through the extra bulk from said item allowing it to sponge certain physical coverage moves like Eternatus's Shell Side Arm much more comfortably. Its exceptional special bulk also lets it forgo Ice Scales in favor of Magic Guard, allowing it to be very resilient against residual damage from entry hazards, Thunder Cage, and status conditions. Chansey's minuscule Attack also lets it neutralize Strength Sap healing from the special attackers it aims to wall to support its offensive teammates. However, Chansey is rather passive, causing it to be a momentum drain against Pokemon such as RegenVest users with Knock Off and Flutter Mane, which an issue amplified by its lack of passive recovery from Leftovers, forcing it to spend turns healing more. It also has a minor opportunity cost of not being able to use Eviolite + Imposter.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Imposter users can run a variety of other utility moves depending on what the team requires, with some examples being Court Change, Rapid Spin, and Glare. They can also use some other niche items. Leftovers provides a minor longevity increase and crucially gives them an edge against otherwise troublesome Take Heart Arceus formes. Spooky Plate lets them surprise Normalize Flutter Mane and non-Knock Off Arceus-Ghost, although these are its exclusive use cases. Choice Scarf is very niche, (comma) and the Choice lock can be highly restrictive and exploitable, with the only benefit being safer matchups against certain offensive Pokemon, mainly Dragon-types like Ultra Necrozma and Mega Garchomp. Non-Imposter Chansey can utilize a Regenerator set to spend less turns healing but faces fierce competition from Blissey due to a vulnerability to entry hazards, with the extra security against Shell Side Arm Eternatus being offset by potential poison.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Imposter users hate having their items removed, whether it's the significant bulk cut from losing Eviolite or losing the high utility Heavy-Duty Boots and Covert Cloak provide. Non-Imposter Chansey is heavily reliant on Eviolite for its bulk, making Knock Off incredibly crippling.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: Paralysis cripples Imposter users' ability to check notable offensive threats and allows common Dragon Energy users like Eternatus to comfortably defeat them. Poison can also rapidly chip them down.</p> <p><strong>Anti-Imposter Sets</strong>: Due to Imposter's prevalence, many common sets are capable of defeating Imposter users one-on-one. Notable examples include Thunder Cage + Strength Sap Arceus formes and Judgment + Plate users like Arceus-Ghost, Arceus-Steel, and Flutter Mane.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers with Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Powerful wallbreakers such as Eternatus, Ultra Necrozma, and Mega Garchomp can hit Imposter users extremely hard, deterring them from switching in. Dragon Energy users in particular can threaten weakened Imposter users significantly. These will often need to consider Speed ties against Imposter users, however, so may still switch out.</p> <p><strong>Limiting Healing</strong>: Imposter users can be susceptible to being worn down rapidly if they is unable to transform into something that can reliably heal. This most commonly involves Strength Sap and limiting its healing through low Attack Pokemon like Chansey, Blissey, and Mega Audino.</p> <p><strong>Trapping</strong>: Imposter only grants a total of 20 PP, so sets with a trapping move like Spirit Shackle, Block, or the rare Jaw Lock can trap and PP stall Imposter users. However, Spirit Shackle users must be cautious of being reverse PP stalled by Covert Cloak Imposter users in extended games.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Despite the Eviolite boost, Chansey is still rather frail physically and is vulnerable to physical wallbreakers like Mega Garchomp and Mega Blaziken, though Burning Bulwark can somewhat alleviate the issue against Choice Band users.</p> <p><strong>Flutter Mane</strong>: Flutter Mane regularly runs Pain Split and Spikes, allowing to make significant progress against Chansey while keeping itself healthy.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Chansey is highly vulnerable to Taunt due to its passivity. Taunt is capable of shutting down its recovery, can stop its setup control, and often prevents its pivoting attempts.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Most of the time, Chansey will be transformed into the foe, so the given moves are for the situations it is not transformed. Shore Up in conjunction with Topsy-Turvy or Haze allows Chansey to excellently Imposter-proof special attackers such as Miraidon and Take Heart Arceus formes with its high special bulk and low Attack to limit Strength Sap healing from opposing Imposter users. Block can be used to ensure that opposing Imposter users that stay in are trapped and eliminated, while Teleport provides slow pivoting instead. Heal Bell lets Chansey act as a cleric in a pinch, while Jungle Healing can provide additional recovery while also curing it of status, which is useful to Imposter-proof Eternatus. Wish is an alternative if Teleport is run to effectively support teammates. Eviolite provides a generally useful bulk increase that is particularly helpful against threats like Mega Alakazam. Heavy-Duty Boots is the premier option on entry hazard-resilient teams that forgo hazard removal. Covert Cloak meanwhile blocks the secondary effect of moves like Spirit Shackle and Mortal Spin, allowing it to bypass some Imposter-proofing methods. It is worth noting that if Eviolite is not opted for, then Blissey can be used as the Imposter user.</p> <p>Imposter users can fit on virtually every team archetype due to the utility and information they provide, and all Pokemon can benefit from their presence. Physically offensive Pokemon such as Choice Band Ash-Greninja and Mega Garchomp appreciate the scouting information Imposter brings, in particular moves like Burning Bulwark being revealed; these Pokemon are also particularly helpful for Teleport sets, providing an immediate method to force out opposing Imposter users transformed into Chansey. Special attackers like Eternatus and Mega Gardevoir meanwhile enjoy Imposter Chansey's ability to trade Knock Offs against opposing RegenVest Pokemon to soften them up, and these attackers can also be potentially Imposter-proofed by it. Defensively, walls appreciate Imposter Chansey alleviating pressure by soft checking threats like Mega Alakazam. Pokemon that provide slow pivoting, such as Mega Audino, can bring Imposter users in to safely scout opponents. Special walls like Ice Scales Mega Audino can check a variety of threats to Imposter users, such as Arceus-Ghost, Take Heart Arceus formes, and offensive Dragon-types like Mega Sceptile. Imposter users can also be highly reliant on their items, especially in the case of Heavy-Duty Boots and Covert Cloak, so they appreciates Knock Off absorbers like Magic Guard Arceus Ghost and select RegenVest users.</p>"

Ruination is a way to make near-guaranteed progress barring a miss, and its consistent damage mitigates Blissey's otherwise-crippling passivity. Topsy-Turvy deters setup attempts from Take Heart and Nasty Plot users by inverting their boosts and likely forcing a switch, in which case Blissey can then pivot out with Teleport or Parting Shot. Blissey's ability to deny Strength Sap healing makes it a great pick on balance teams carrying physical attackers such as Mega Lucario, as Fur Coat walls with Strength Sap usually can't get past Blissey, and physical attackers can force Imposter users out if they switch in while Blissey is pivoting. Blissey's immense frailty means that reliable physical walls, such as Mega Slowbro, are mandatory to cover for it; Arceus-Ghost can also bypass Blissey with either Secret Sword or Triple Arrows, so Yveltal makes for a good teammate.

Ruination reduces Blissey's passivity, though Salt Cure is an alternative that can be more effective into Pokemon like Celesteela and Flare Boost Flutter Mane. Clear Smog, Topsy-Turvy, and Glare prevent Blissey from being setup fodder, with the latter being particularly useful against Magic Guard Eternatus and Imposter users, while Stone Axe provides utility if setup control is not necessary. Assault Vest further amplifies Blissey's Special Defense against powerful wallbreakers like Mega Alakazam that could otherwise outdamage Regenerator healing, while Heavy-Duty Boots prevents entry hazard damage and allows Blissey to access the aforementioned status moves. Blissey pairs incredibly well with very fast offensive Pokemon like Mega Alakazam and Mega Sceptile, as it provides slow pivoting, Wish support to offset residual damage for Mega Alakazam and allow Mega Sceptile to forgo Strength Sap, and healing denial against special walls like Ice Scales Arceus formes, while they revenge-kill numerous threats that Blissey can pivot into, especially those that Blissey cannot beat by itself such as Eternatus and Flare Boost Flutter Mane. Strong physical attackers also work well, as they can offensively Imposter-proof Blissey without conceding momentum; particularly, Ash-Greninja can pick off chipped Ice Scales Arceus formes. Blissey cannot handle certain special attackers like Psystrike Mega Alakazam, Shell Side Arm Eternatus, and various Secret Sword users, mandating a secondary special wall like Ice Scales users.

Volt Tackle's very high PP and good damage output are excellent, as they allow Ho-Oh to both fish for paralysis on threats like Imposter users and also deal hefty damage, notably ensuring that Mega Slowbro can't wall it long-term. Swords Dance bolsters these moves even further, notably allowing V-create to OHKO neutral Arceus formes and Volt Tackle to 2HKO Mega Slowbro, in addition to preventing Imposter users and faster Pokemon like Eternatus and from permanently walling Ho-Oh with Strength Sap; alternatively, Headlong Rush allows Ho-Oh to hit foes like Eternatus and Fire-immune Steel-types like Registeel super effectively. Magic Guard Ho-Oh best fits on balance teams looking for a bulky setup attacker that wears down common walls and can potentially sweep late-game. Dragon-types are a notable thorn in Ho-Oh's side, particularly ones that use Strength Sap like Eternatus, so an ally that blocks Strength Sap like Magic Guard Blissey is a valuable teammate. Ho-Oh's damage potential also tanks without its Life Orb, so a Knock Off absorber like an Arceus forme is useful.

Arceus-Fairy's main flaw is arguably its dependence on Strength Sap for healing, which means Magic Guard Blissey and Chansey are perfect counters, since they have the perfect kits to freely switch into Arceus-Fairy and stall it out; Arceus-Fairy can't reliably use Recover instead, as doing so completely forfeits its advantage against Impostor users. Additionally, Fur Coat Arceus-Fairy can struggle against common Steel-type coverage from Choice Band users like Mega Garchomp, while Ice Scales variants are vulnerable to Eternatus and super effective coverage like Noxious Torque Ash-Greninja and Gigaton Hammer Mega Sceptile.</p>",

Defensively, Pokemon like Solgaleo and Arceus-Steel can check all variants of Arceus-Fairy.</p> <p><strong>Salt Cure</strong>: Unless Covert Cloak is used, Salt Cure puts Take Heart Arceus-Fairy on a timer, making it more difficult to set up, as well as making it so Arceus-Fairy is unable to Impostor-proof itself.</p> <p><strong>Eternatus</strong>: Eternatus can pressure unboosted Arceus-Fairy out with Poison-type moves.

Leftovers allows Arceus-Fairy to not have its healing cut off by Pokemon with low attack, as well as giving it increased longevity, while Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers and notably slows down Sniper Ash-Greninja significantly.</p> <p>Arceus-Fairy is typically splashed onto bulkier teams as a wall against threats like Mega Garchomp, Mega Sceptile, and Ash-Greninja, in addition to compressing a late-game win condition at the same time. Arceus-Fairy's solid typing and bulk mean it can serve as a good Imposter-proof to Pokemon like these, particularly with Rocky Helmet if running Fur Coat. Arceus-Fairy does falter to fast Pokemon that can easily slot Steel or Poison-type coverage, like Koraidon for Fur Coat sets, and Sheer Force Ash-Greninja for Ice Scales sets, so defensive Pokemon that can stonewall them like RegenVest Dialga-O, Mega Swampert, and Zamazenta can assist with that, and, in Mega Swampert's case, provides a very valuable check to the threatening Mega Lucario. Arceus-Fairy is both stonewalled and has its healing denied by Blissey and Chansey, so a teammate with Psystrike or a similar move that can pressure them out, like Mega Gardevoir or High Jump Kick Mega Sceptile, is highly recommended.</p>"

Thunder Cage provides general coverage and chip damage against Pokemon like Ho-Oh and Arceus-Fairy, as well as deterring Imposter users.

It is able to soft check a lot of would-be annoyances such as RegenVest Celesteela without Nuzzle and Mega Lucario depending on its ability. Its ability to block Rapid Spin also differentiates it from other Arceus formes. However, Arceus-Ghost can be hard walled rather easily by certain walls such as Mega Audino and Meloetta. Its low immediate damage output can also lead to fast offensive threats like Eternatus forcing it out. Its ability choice of Magic Guard or Fur Coat also mean it either has limited defensive presence or is a physical wall that's weak to Choice Band Ash-Greninja, respectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Cage can constantly chip down most bulkier walls and hits Celesteela hard, but Mortal Spin is generally better at chipping down walls on utility sets, which leaves Thunder Cage mostly just for Celesteela. Other offensive abilities such as Speed Boost and Good as Gold can be chosen over Fur Coat on the setup set, but this provides little defensive utility and would leave Arceus-Ghost with fewer opportunities to set up. Taunt is an option on the setup set to deny recovery and other utility such as Spikes and Topsy-Turvy, but giving up a moveslot for utility such as Knock Off or coverage is often not desirable. Plus, it either locks Arceus-Ghost into using Judgment as its only attack or means it has no recovery, both of which are very easily exploitable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Arceus-Ghost struggles against most Dark-type foes in general, especially faster attackers such as Ash-Greninja. However, they dislike switching in on Secret Sword or Knock Off especially with entry hazards up. Magic Guard Yveltal in particular, however, is a great annoyance, as it completely halts anything Arceus-Ghost can do.</p> <p><strong>Normal-type Walls</strong>: Blissey and Mega Audino handily beat setup sets via Topsy-Turvy and their immunity to Judgment, although Blissey needs to watch out for Secret Sword. Utility sets are hard stopped by Magic Guard Blissey, and even if it is not running Magic Guard, Arceus-Ghost can only make progress through Knock Off and Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Most faster threats, like Flutter Mane, Eternatus, and Mega Alakazam, threaten Arceus-Ghost out with direct damage. They can't really switch in, however.</p> <p><strong>Status Effects</strong>: Fur Coat Arceus-Ghost sets hate status, as chip damage from poison cuts heavily into its longevity, and paralysis completely cripples it. Magic Guard sets don't mind poison but still dislike paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Ice Scales + Take Heart Arceus Formes</strong>: Ice Scales Acreus amplified with Take Heart's Special Defense boosts means that all of Arceus-Ghost's attacks, including Secret Sword, will do basically no damage to these Arceus formes. Many of them also carry a Plate, which means they can easily sponge Knock Off.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Arceus-Ghost can provide very consistent utility to its team with its immunity to item removal and built in self-Imposter-proofing through Judgment. Shore Up is the preferred healing move because it isn't blocked by the likes of Blissey and Mega Audino, but Strength Sap heals more HP at once and fares better against Choice Band users. Knock Off removes crucial items from walls like Heavy-Duty Boots and Covert Cloak from Mega Audino, making them susceptible to entry hazard damage or getting poisoned by Mortal Spin. Potentially removing Eviolite from Imposter users is also nice but should not be relied on, as these foes rarely want to switch in on Arceus-Ghost. Spikes takes advantage of Arceus-Ghost's conventional switch-ins, like Blissey, being passive and lacking hazard removal; alternatively, Rapid Spin and Mortal Spin provide hard-to-block hazard removal. Magic Guard is the preferred ability, as it provides an immunity to entry hazards and other chip damage such as Salt Cure and Mortal Spin, but Fur Coat makes Arceus-Ghost function as more of a wall capable of soft checking foes like Koraidon.</p> <p>Arceus-Ghost fits well on entry hazard-stacking teams, as it can easily provide item removal support and reliably block Rapid Spin. Teams that stack hazard-immune teammates also enjoy Arceus-Ghost as a Knock Off absorber. Most attackers such as Ash-Greninja or and Eternatus appreciate Arceus-Ghost stacking Spikes to wear away at their checks or, in Eternatus's case, directly damage checks like Ice Scales Arceus formes. Other teammates such as RegenVest Celesteela and Mega Audino also synergize well with Arceus-Ghost defensively alongside the occasional Imposter-proofing Arceus-Ghost can provide for them. Arceus-Ghost is particularly vulnerable to Dark-types and opposing Ghost-types that are faster such as Ash-Greninja, Yveltal, and Flutter Mane; therefore, checks to them like the aforementioned Mega Audino are valuable.</p>"

      "Setup Sweeper": {

Shore Up provides consistent recovery and isn't stopped by Strength Sap blockers like Blissey and Mega Audino, the latter of which Arceus-Ghost can't feasibly threaten; alternatively, Strength Sap has higher instant healing and makes it much more solid against physical attackers and Imposter users. Nasty Plot provides an immediately threatening boost, letting Arceus-Ghost immediately 2HKO neutral non-Ice Scales Arceus formes without any prior chip damage. Torch Song boosts slower but damages while boosting and provides a strong tool against RegenVest Celesteela. Take Heart bolsters Arceus-Ghost's special bulk and gets rid of crippling status such as paralysis from Glare and poison from Mortal Spin, but it is not advised if not using Strength Sap or Knock Off, as Imposter users can wall Arceus-Ghost barring critical hits. Knock Off is the preferred last move, as it removes crucial items such as Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Mega Audino and Assault Vest from Celesteela. Secret Sword is an alternative that provides no support but ensures Arceus-Ghost can break through Blissey and certain Take Heart Arceus formes such as Ice Scales Arceus-Electric if running Take Heart itself.</p> <p>Arceus-Ghost best functions as both a sturdy physical wall early-game and a late-game wincon when most of its checks have been chipped down or crippled, so it pairs well with early- to mid-game wallbreakers or defensive progress-makers, such as Mega Garchomp and Spikes users like Mega Audino; Arceus-Ghost can in return help Imposter-proof them or block Rapid Spin. Arceus-Ghost enjoys entry hazard support in particular, as it forces a lot of switches after setting up, forcing quite a bit of free chip damage. Arceus-Ghost is mostly checked by Mega Audino, so another teammate that can pressure it such as Eternatus is also helpful. Arceus-Ghost should not be used as your only physical wall, as it is very vulnerable to Choice Band Ash-Greninja, and Shore Up sets can be prone to running out of PP in longer games; therefore, another physical wall such as Fur Coat Mega Audino or Fur Coat Zacian pairs well with it.</p>"

Spirit Shackle is solely for Imposter users; after trapping one, Arceus-Ground can always boost to +6 and beat it one-on-one, putting the opponent in a heavily disadvantaged position. Strength Sap is necessary for Arceus-Ground to Imposter-proof itself, and it usually heals for more than Recover; Arceus-Ground being a physical attacker also prevents the bane of most Ice Scales Arceus formes, Magic Guard Blissey, from denying it healing. Earth Plate provides a damage boost to Earthquake and can't be removed with Knock Off or Trick, while Covert Cloak shuts down passive damage from Salt Cure and Mortal Spin, making boosting easier. Arceus-Ground's main drawback is that against teams with Strength Sap, Haze, or Topsy-Turvy Celesteela or Yveltal it's never sweeping; as a result, threats like Bolt Strike Mega Garchomp and Mega Lucario are useful teammates. Arceus-Ground can also struggle against Palkia-O and No Retreat Arceus-Ghost, so backup checks to them like Salt Cure users and Mega Audino help out.

Beak Blast, if it successfully burns, instantly kills any physical wallbreaker's hopes of dealing damage except mixed attackers with Electro Drift; it also outdamages Jungle Healing from Mega Garchomp. Knock Off annoys defensive switch-ins like Mega Audino by removing items like Covert Cloak, while Salt Cure can help rack up large amounts of passive damage and more directly threatens Imposter users. Stone Axe capitalizes on the switches Celesteela often forces by virtue of its typing by setting entry hazards, but it's notably worse against Imposter users. Recover provides reliable healing in the face of wallbreaker + Strength Sap blocker structures, while Strength Sap has higher burst healing against some teams, is easier to Imposter-proof, neutralizes Mega Garchomp, and helps versus Ash-Greninja. Rocky Helmet helps wear away at physical attackers without needing entry hazard support and throttles Ash-Greninja into spamming Wicked Blow, while Covert Cloak shuts off Salt Cure's crushing passive damage. Physical wallbreakers like Mega Garchomp appreciate Celesteela Imposter-proofing them and blocking Mortal Spin to keep hazards on the field to increase the odds of KOs. Celesteela can be vulnerable to Bolt Strike or Electro Drift users like Mega Lucario and mixed attackers like Ultra Necrozma, so sturdy walls to them like Miraidon and Ice Scales Arceus-Ground makes for good partners. Imposter-proof Celesteela with a Magic Bounce user, a Magic Guard user not deterred by burns or Knock Off like Arceus-Ghost, or a RegenVest user like Primal Kyogre.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Eternatus is one of the most splashable and defining Pokemon in BH, capable of filling offensive and defensive roles through its excellent stat distribution, crucially outspeeding Arceus. Its Poison typing provides a crucial neutrality to Fairy and allows Eternatus to hit some of the most common specially defensive walls like Mega Audino super effectively, while its Dragon typing and naturally high HP allows it to heavily deter Imposter users from switching in. As a result, its Magic Guard set is one of the most defining offensive sets in the metagame, exerting strong pressure while retaining remarkably solid defensive capabilities. It can also serve a more defensive role with sets using Unaware or Regenerator that can blanket check a variety of setup users through its bulk, Speed, and typing that aids against common forms of passive damage, like poison and Thunder Cage. However, Eternatus's Speed leaves it outsped by and vulnerable to several prominent threats like Miraidon and Mega Alakazam. It is also highly reliant on maintaining high HP to retain Dragon Energy's power, which, when combined with its lower initial damage output, reduces its offensive consistency.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>For the Magic Guard set, Final Gambit is a niche alternative on more offensive teams or when coupled with Wish support as an option to clear out special walls for teammates like Mega Sceptile. Secret Sword is another niche alternative over Shell Side Arm or Strength Sap that hits Blissey and Chansey significantly harder and allows use of a stronger Poison-type STAB move like Malignant Chain, but it doesn't offer much else. Mold Breaker lets Eternatus bypass Well-Baked Body and Ice Scales to aid in wallbreaking, but the vulnerability to passive damage cuts into Dragon Energy's power much easier, it provides less defensive value, and Mold Breaker still can't beat Primordial Sea. Regenerator sets, sometimes with Choice Scarf, act as a decent pivot against threats like Mega Blaziken and Ash-Greninja and can provide utility through Spikes and Trick, although its offensive potential is low. A Fur Coat set seems appealing to act as a check to physical attackers like Sniper Ash-Greninja and Mega Blaziken, but it can be overwhelmed by the former after minor chip damage and has a glaring weakness to Mega Garchomp, rendering it mostly outclassed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Eternatus is very dependent on its Speed to function, making paralysis severely crippling and heavily reducing its offensive and defensive potential.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: Attackers like Mega Sceptile and Mega Alakazam outspeed and can OHKO Eternatus.</p> <p><strong>Fire-immune Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types with abilities that snuff Torch Song, such as Well-Baked Body or Primordial Sea Solgaleo and Arceus-Steel, are nigh immovable for Eternatus. Notably, Magearna with one of these abilities is immune to all of Eternatus's standard moves.</p> <p><strong>Ice Scales Walls</strong>: Select Ice Scales Pokemon such as Meloetta and Arceus-Ground shrug off Eternatus's attacks and can retaliate with super effective STAB moves, and unlike Blissey, they can safely withstand Shell Side Arm. However, they must hold Covert Cloak to prevent poison, as Arceus-Ground struggles to fit Take Heart, rendering them susceptible to repeated chip damage from entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey's respectable physical bulk with Eviolite, in contrast to Blissey, allows it to comfortably handle Eternatus and notably deny recovery from Strength Sap.</p>",

Magic Guard makes Eternatus incredibly difficult to chip down, helping maintain Dragon Energy's power, and it also negates recoil from Life Orb, giving Eternatus a much-needed damage boost. Shell Side Arm seems odd with Eternatus's base 85 Attack, but with the Life Orb boost, it heavily pressures Blissey, an otherwise difficult wall to surmount. Torch Song compresses boosting and coverage for Steel-types like Celesteela in one slot. Strength Sap is the preferred recovery move to keep Eternatus healthy. A Naive nature ensures Eternatus outspeeds the Arceus formes and Ultra Necrozma, and it is opted over a Hasty nature, as it helps against attacks from Pokemon like Mega Blaziken and RegenVest users as well as increasing damage dealt to Imposter users with Dragon Energy.</p> <p>Magic Guard Eternatus fits on a variety of team structures thanks to its splashability. Thanks to Magic Guard, this set fits naturally on entry hazard-resilient teams as a source of offensive pressure, and it works well with other Magic Guard attackers like Mega Sceptile and Ultra Necrozma to overload their shared checks like Fire-immune Steel-types. Eternatus also synergizes excellently with hazard-stacking compositions, as checks like Ice Scales Pokemon cannot hold both Heavy-Duty Boots to negate hazards and Covert Cloak to prevent poison from Shell Side Arm. RegenVest users like Celesteela and Dialga-O pair well with Eternatus by providing Knock Off support against opposing RegenVest users while also checking faster offensive foes like Mega Alakazam and Mega Sceptile that threaten Eternatus. They can also sometimes provide paralysis support against Imposter users, rendering them useless against Eternatus. Blissey and Chansey can provide Wish support to help keep Eternatus healthy and allow it to forgo Strength Sap, and they also limit Strength Sap recovery from opposing Take Heart Arceus formes, helping Eternatus break through them easier. Eternatus also appreciates Knock Off absorbers like the Arceus formes and some aforementioned RegenVest Pokemon, as it is reliant on Life Orb for a significant amount of its damage output. Eternatus can be Imposter-proofed easily by Eviolite Chansey, either with Imposter + Jungle Healing or Heal Bell or with Magic Guard; other options include Fire-immune Steel-types and Take Heart Ice Scales Pokemon like the Arceus formes.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Koraidon distinguishes itself from similar Choice Band wallbreakers like Kyurem-B and Mega Garchomp with its high Speed that allows it to revenge kill offensive threats like Ash-Greninja, Stealth Rock resistance, STAB that removes the need for Bolt Strike, and ease of Imposter-proofing. Glaive Rush and Close Combat 2HKO most Fur Coat users after Stealth Rock with Teravolt. Gigaton Hammer smacks Fairy-types that would otherwise stonewall Koraidon's STAB moves like Mega Audino, and U-turn racks up small amounts chip damage, most notably making Mega Slowbro feasible to KO without extensive team support. Wallbreakers like Mega Garchomp and Ash-Greninja that struggle with Celesteela or Fairy-type physical walls appreciate Koraidon threatening these obstacles, and their raw power helps Koraidon in return. Koraidon struggles to actually get OHKOs due to its lower Attack compared to the competition, so chip damage support, Strength Sap blockers, and slow pivoting like Spikes users, Magic Guard Blissey, and RegenVest users such as Mega Swampert make for good partners. Imposter-proof Koraidon with an Arceus forme that isn't weak to any of its moves like Arceus-Ghost or naturally physically bulky Pokemon like Mega Slowbro.</p>"

      "Fur Coat": {
        "description": "<p>Fur Coat Miraidon is a resilient wall with strong offensive pressure that can also check Pokemon like Mega Lucario and Ash-Greninja. Torch Song provides coverage against Mega Steelix and boosts Miraidon's Special Attack, potentially facilitating a late-game sweep. Spikes can support Miraidon's offensive teammates and force progress against hard walls like Mega Swampert. Thunder Cage + Torch Song lets Miraidon damage most Steel-types well, making it an effective user of Mortal Spin. Will-O-Wisp threatens to burn offensive threats and some switch-ins like Mega Swampert. Take Heart is another way to boost Special Attack, and also means Miraidon can’t be put on a permanent timer once it loses Covert Cloak. Miraidon struggles against Mega Garchomp and mixed attackers like Ultra Necrozma, so Pokemon like Celesteela and Arceus-Ground can pair well with it. Miraidon can be Imposter-proofed by itself in most cases due to Thunder Cage; however, Pokemon like Blissey and the aforementioned Arceus-Ground can Imposter-proof it in emergency situations.</p>"

      "Magic Guard": {
        "description": "<p>With Magic Guard, Miraidon is a powerful wallbreaker that can exploit passive foes relying on Mortal Spin and Salt Cure to deal damage; its typing and Speed also allow it to soft check slower foes like Mega Lucario and Ash-Greninja. Torch Song hits Steel-types like Registeel and Mega Steelix while boosting Miraidon's Special Attack. Thunder Cage traps foes, deals good chip damage to special walls, and is an overall decent high-PP STAB move; alternatively, Volt Switch makes Miraidon a very effective pivot. Dragon Energy, when boosted by Life Orb, becomes a very powerful attack against foes taking chip from Thunder Cage. Strength Sap is a burst healing option that's easy to Imposter-proof and keeps Dragon Energy's Base Power high. Miraidon's ability to heavily chip down special walls makes other special attackers like Choice Specs Flutter Mane good partners; other teammates relying on passive damage such as Salt Cure users also appreciate Miraidon as an offensive Imposter-proofer. Miraidon will never beat Arceus-Ground and struggles against Magic Guard Blissey and specially defensive Mega Swampert, so allies like Ultra Necrozma and Simple Arceus-Ghost are useful. Imposter-proof Miraidon with Ice Scales Arceus-Ground or Magic Guard Blissey; Imposter Chansey can also work, but it's less reliable due to taking chip damage from Thunder Cage.</p>"
