  "Koffing": {
    "overview": "<p>A Poison typing with the complementing ability Levitate leaves Koffing with useful resistances and only one weakness. Its great Defense stat allows it to be a nuisance to common Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr, and its wide movepool leaves it with plenty of coverage and support options such as Fire Blast and Will-O-Wisp. However, its shabby offensive stats give it an underwhelming offensive presence, which can allow Pokemon such as Guts Timburr, Pawniard, and Scraggy to set up on it. Additionally, its mediocre HP and bad Special Defense mean it often can't take special hits. It is also fairly reliant on its Eviolite being present to tank a lot of hits.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic has perfect accuracy on Koffing, but spreading burn with Will-O-Wisp or poison with Toxic Spikes often proves more effective. Thunderbolt can be used to deal with Flying- and Water-types, but it isn't particularly strong and often won't fit in Koffing's moveset. Destiny Bond is useful for forcing a sweeper out or potentially taking it down with Koffing; unfortunately, Koffing is very slow, so Destiny Bond requires precise prediction. Berry Juice could be used instead of Eviolite; however, it makes Pain Split less reliable and takes away a huge portion of Koffing's bulk. Taunt would be a solid option if Koffing weren't one of the slowest Pokemon in the tier. Still, it can be an option to stop opposing Pokemon from recovering their health or setting entry hazards. Flamethrower has more PP and is more accurate than Fire Blast, but the drop in power is notable. Memento can give a setup sweeper a solid opportunity to boost itself with little risk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types can OHKO Koffing with a super effective STAB Psychic. Abra outspeeds Koffing, while Slowpoke takes little damage from any of Koffing's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Drilbur</strong>: Drilbur resist's Koffing's Poison-type attacks, can use Rapid Spin to remove Toxic Spikes, and can OHKO Koffing despite Levitate with a STAB super effective Mold Breaker Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types resist both Poison- and Fire-type attacks. Onix can use Taunt on Koffing, effectively rendering it useless, but must be wary of switching in on Will-O-Wisp. Omanyte can set up Shell Smash on any set not carrying Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Water / Poison types</strong>: Mareanie and Tentacool resist Koffing's common attacks, aren't 2HKOed by Thunderbolt, and can absorb Toxic Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Timburr</strong>: Guts Timburr can switch into Will-O-Wisp or Toxic Spikes to receive an Attack boost.</p> <p><strong>RestTalk Users</strong>: Common RestTalk users such as Munchlax and Mudbray take little damage from any of Koffing's attacks and don't care about being burned.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp cripples physical threats, and its damage over time is almost always helpful. Pain Split is Koffing's only way to regain HP; it's not the most reliable method, but its capability to heal Koffing and damage the foe can prove quite useful. Sludge Bomb has good damaging capabilities and a nice 30% chance to inflict poison. Clear Smog is weaker than Sludge Bomb but can be used to prevent Koffing from being set up on; however, keep in mind that it doesn't remove boosts through Substitute. Fire Blast dents Steel-types like Magnemite and Ferroseed, which don't fear Poison-type moves. Toxic Spikes isn't a common move in LC, and Koffing is one of the more reliable Toxic Spikes setters. The move's ability to spread poison on foes upon entry causes it to work very well on defensive or balanced teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Koffing's EVs are focused on defenses to get the maximum bulk possible from Eviolite while maintaining low HP to make Pain Split more impactful. A Bold nature further bolsters Koffing's strong Defense and hits an Eviolite-optimal number. Levitate is Koffing's only ability, effectively leaving it with one weakness.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to Koffing's strong Defense and useful resistances, it can switch in on most Bug-, Fighting-, Poison-, and Fairy-types without fear. Examples include Snubbull, Spritzee, Foongus, and Mienfoo. Because of Koffing's low Speed, anticipate when Koffing will hit low HP so it can get the most health out of Pain Split in a single use. Be careful with Will-O-Wisp around Guts users such as Timburr, which gain an Attack boost from being statused. Avoid letting Koffing's Eviolite be removed by Knock Off from Pokemon such as Pawniard and Cottonee unless absolutely necessary, since this takes away a lot of Koffing's bulk. Be careful around special attackers such as Staryu and Magnemite because they can prey on Koffing's weaker Special Defense. Try to lure in Steel-types like Ferroseed and Pawniard to then deliver a nasty blow with Fire Blast. Toxic Spikes can be very useful for gradually wearing down the opponent's team, but make sure there are burns on physically offensive threats before setting it up. Spinners, Defoggers, and grounded Poison-types such as Staryu, Vullaby, and Foongus can easily remove Toxic Spikes, so try to remove them from the game as soon as possible. Pokemon with Mold Breaker such as Drilbur can hit Koffing with Ground-type moves, so be careful of them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dark-types like Pawniard and Alolan Grimer can deal with the Psychic-types directed at Koffing and Pursuit trap them. Ghost-types can also deal with Psychic-types and prevent the opponent from using Rapid Spin to clear Toxic Spikes. Fighting-weak Pokemon like Ferroseed and Pawniard appreciate Koffing's ability to deal with Fighting-types. Spritzee can provide valuable Wish support and appreciates Koffing's ability to handle Poison-types. Gastly can use a strong Hex that takes advantage of Koffing's ability to easily spread status. Diglett can trap Poison-types, which allows Toxic Spikes to stay on the field.</p>"

As an offensive Psychic-type, it is wildly outlclassed by Abra, which is significantly faster and stronger than Ralts. As a Fairy-type, Spritzee is significantly better due to its sheer bulk and great team support. Ralts's only defining niche is that it is able to revenge trap Diglett by Tracing Arena Trap, but it is often ineffective at this because it fails to KO Diglett from full HP. Ralts also gets some useful support moves, but other than Destiny Bond and Memento, Ralts will often not get to make use of them because of how frail it is.</p>",

A Choice Scarf and a Timid nature are required to outspeed Diglett. Memento allows Ralts to give a teammate the ability to set up and sweep.

  "Pumpkaboo-Small": {
    "overview": "<p>Pumpkaboo-S is one of the few Pokemon in LC with access to Z-Trick-or-Treat, the other ones being its other formes. It is the best user of the move, having the highest Speed stat. It gets many setup opportunities thanks to its great defensive typing, which allows it to check a wide variety of Pokemon. Its typing also gives it a resistance to most priority moves and an immunity to Rapid Spin. However, since Z-Moves can only be used once, it cannot use Z-Trick-or-Treat again after it switches out. Its typing also leaves it weak to Sucker Punch and Pursuit.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast due to its better accuracy, but its power is typically too low to justify using. Destiny Bond is an option to take an opponent down with Pumpkaboo-S as well as to play around Sucker Punch, though Pumpkaboo-S has trouble finding room for it. Shadow Sneak can be used as a priority move, but it generally isn't worth using since Pumpkaboo-S already gets a Speed boost after Z-Trick-or-Treat. Synthesis can be used for recovery, though Pumpkaboo-S has to miss out on coverage to run it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Vullaby and Doduo resist Pumpkaboo-S's STAB moves and set up Nasty Plot and KO with Brave Bird, respectively. However, Doduo has to be a Choice Scarf variant to avoid getting outsped after a Z-Trick-or-Treat boost and potentially KOed by Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Pawniard and Houndour can switch in on most of Pumpkaboo-S's attacks and either get rid of it with Sucker Punch or trap it with Pursuit. Houndour in particular completely walls Pumpkaboo-S. Pawniard must be wary of Fire Blast on the switch in, though.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Ponyta and Larvesta can threaten Pumpkaboo-S with their STAB moves. Ponyta has to be wary on the switch in, however, as it gets 2HKOed by Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralysis hinders Pumpkaboo-S by halving its Speed, making it harder for it to sweep.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Z-Trick-or-Treat": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Z-Trick-or-Treat is a stellar setup move that boosts all of Pumpkaboo-S's stats by one stage, giving it a chance to sweep. Shadow Ball is Pumpkaboo-S's Ghost-type STAB move, hitting hard after a Z-Trick-or-Treat boost. It also lets Pumpkaboo-S get a super effective hit most of the time thanks to Trick-or-Treat's secondary effect. If need be, it can also be powered up into Never-Ending Nightmare as a last resort to nab a quick KO. Fire Blast gets rid of the Grass- and Steel-types that resist Giga Drain, OHKOing Ferroseed and 2HKOing Pawniard and Foongus, and OHKOes Pokemon such as Snover and Alolan Sandshrew. Giga Drain gets a STAB boost and hits Ground-types like Mudbray and Drilbur as well as Water-types like Chinchou and Corphish, though Choice Scarf variants of Chinchou still outspeed boosted Pumpkaboo-S and Knock Off from Corphish still does heavy damage to Pumpkaboo-S. It also provides Pumpkaboo-S with a bit of recovery.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>148 Speed EVs allow Pumpkaboo-S to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame after a Z-Trick-or-Treat. 164 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature maximize Pumpkaboo-S's damage as much as possible. The remaining EVs are used to give Pumpkaboo-S more bulk. Frisk is the preferred ability because it can be crucial in figuring out what set the opponent is running. Ghostium Z is required to use Z-Trick-or-Treat or, if the situation calls for it, Never-Ending Nightmare.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pumpkaboo-S should generally avoid status, especially paralysis. Pumpkaboo-S should usually be saved for late-game when most of its counters are removed, such as Vullaby and Pawniard. It can also function as an early-game wallbreaker if the opponent doesn't have any of Pumpkaboo-S's counters, making it easy for it to punch holes in the enemy team for its allies to clean up. Pumpkaboo-S can reliably set up on things that it walls, such as Drilbur and Mudbray, due to its typing. Pumpkaboo-S should be careful of Sucker Punch because it deals a lot of damage, not to mention that it bypasses Pumpkaboo-S's boosted Speed. Pursuit is also dangerous, as it forces Pumpkaboo-S to take some damage regardless of whether it switches out or not. Thanks to Trick-or-Treat, Pumpkaboo-S can turn anything into a Ghost-type, making Shadow Ball super effective on almost anything. Even after it sets up, it can still use Trick-or-Treat if something new comes in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>In general, Pumpkaboo-S's teammates should be used to avoid Sucker Punch. Pokemon that can set up entry hazards, such as Dwebble and Archen, help Pumpkaboo-S get some important KOs on Pokemon such as Pawniard, which is a threat to it. Fighting-types such as Timburr and Mienfoo can take care of the Dark-types that Pumpkaboo-S fears. Water-types, such as Mareanie and Chinchou, form a good core with Pumpkaboo-S, as they can take the Fire- and Ice-type attacks Pumpkaboo-S is weak to while Pumpkaboo-S takes Grass- and Electric-type attacks in return. Chinchou in particular can also take care of Flying-types thanks to its typing. Diglett can trap and get rid of Fire-types such as Ponyta as well as Poison-types. Finally, clerics like Spritzee can heal Pumpkaboo-S from crippling status conditions as well as restore its HP.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Piplup has a niche as one of the few LC Pokemon that can both set up hazards with Stealth Rock and get rid of the opponent's with Defog, giving it decent role compression. It's also a Defog user that isn't weak to Stealth Rock, allowing it to switch in more easily. Supporting this are its decent defenses and good defensive typing, letting it take resisted attacks and some neutral ones. Its access to a Water-type STAB move in Scald lets it beat most traditional Stealth Rock setters like Onix and Dwebble. However, Piplup is extremely passive, making it setup bait for sweepers like Shellder and Calm Mind Spritzee. It is also forced into performing its predictable niche, as it's outclassed as a Water-type attacker by Chinchou and defensive Staryu due to their better Speed and movepools. Piplup has access to no recovery outside of Rest, making it prone to getting worn down over time. Finally, it faces competition from Kabuto, a Water-type hazard setter with Rapid Spin, Knock Off, and Weak Armor, as well from Slowpoke and Mareanie, bulkier Water-types with access to Regenerator and recovery.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Berry Juice is an option that gives Piplup some longevity, but it removes from its bulk and consequently its ability to switch in. Brick Break can deal with Pawniard, but it's very situational and doesn't hit much else. Hidden Power Grass hits Water-types that otherwise wall Piplup, but it is very weak. Icy Wind can be used to help Piplup support its teammates with speed control, but it's much weaker than Ice Beam.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Despite Piplup's access to Ice Beam, Foongus and Pumpkaboo-XL can easily take one and deal heavy damage back with their STAB attacks, regaining their lost health in the process.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Cottonee and Mienfoo can render Piplup near useless with Taunt, forcing it to switch in order to get another opportunity to set or remove hazards.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Piplup has nothing to handle Pokemon like Magnemite or Chinchou and is essentially forced to switch. Electric-types can take advantage of this and use Volt Switch to gain momentum.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types like Chinchou, Slowpoke, Shellder, and Staryu resist both of Piplup's STAB moves and completely wall it. Chinchou, in particular, can hit back hard with Volt Switch, while Staryu can spin away the hazards Piplup places.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Since Piplup lacks any form of recovery, and it wants to come in often, hazards and status conditions can quickly wear it down.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock breaks Sturdy on Pokemon like Magnemite and Onix and chips into threats like Vullaby and Ponyta. Defog removes all entry hazards, allowing Piplup to support its team. Scald gives Piplup a main STAB attack and increases its utility, allowing it to spread burns to cripple physical attackers. Ice Beam hits Grass- and Flying-types like Snivy and Doduo, but it won't do very significant damage, failing to 2HKO bulkier foes like Vullaby. Yawn can be used to put on pressure and force switches, but it makes Piplup even more of a Taunt bait and gives it no coverage against Grass-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Bold nature, 92 HP EVs, and 252 Defense EVs maximize Piplup's physical bulk, letting it tank a hit in order to set up Stealth Rock. These EVs also allow Piplup to avoid the 2HKO from any of Onix's and Dwebble's moves, unless they get lucky with Rock Blast. 148 Special Defense EVs let Piplup hit even Eviolite numbers, allowing it to take two of Staryu's Thunderbolts and avoid the 2HKO from Focus Sash Abra's Psychic. Torrent is the only ability compatible with Defog; it's rarely useful, but it does power up Water-type moves at low HP.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Piplup should focus on hazard control and not be used for offensive purposes, as its offensive presence is incredibly low. It performs best when coming in on a slow Volt Switch or U-turn, as it doesn't get worn down as quickly. Piplup functions as a decent lead, as it can beat other common leads like Onix and Dwebble. It also has good bulk, so it can usually switch in on resisted and neutral hits. However, Piplup lacks recovery, so try to avoid switching it in often, especially into powerful attacks like Pawniard's Knock Off and Doduo's Brave Bird. Be careful about using Defog if there is a Pawniard on the other team, as it can switch in and get a +2 Attack boost thanks to Defiant. Finally, Defog can remove all hazards, including the ones you've set, so it can be counterproductive if used directly after Stealth Rock. Try using Defog before using Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fire-types like Ponyta and Larvesta have great synergy with Piplup; they can muscle past bulky Grass-types like Pumpkaboo-XL and Foongus, which Piplup can't beat. They also appreciate Piplup removing Stealth Rock. Flying-types that prefer entry hazards removed, like Vullaby, Doduo, and Rufflet, all appreciate Piplup's Defog, and they can beat Grass-types as well. Grass-types like Snivy and Foongus resist both of Piplup's weaknesses and can check Water-types that resist both of Piplup's attacks. Ground-types like Choice Scarf Drilbur and Diglett can revenge kill Electric-types like Magnemite and Chinchou that threaten Piplup. Slow, bulky U-turn and Volt Switch users like Mienfoo and Chinchou can get Piplup in safely. Sturdy users like Magnemite and Onix also need hazards removed to function best. Wish passers like Spritzee and Lickitung can help keep Piplup alive to keep controlling hazards. Chinchou can switch into Electric-type Pokemon that Piplup can't beat like Magnemite and Elekid; it can also deal with opposing Water-types.</p>"

Additionally, its Z-Celebrate-boosted bulk and access to Sleep Powder allow it to take some hits from strong Pokemon or immobilize them after setting up, since its good defensive typing gives it some key resistances, such as Fighting, Fairy, and Water. Unfortunately, Bulbasaur is frail and weak without the Z-Celebrate boosts, and it lacks setup opportunities against most of the Pokemon in the metagame since it is weak to common types such as Psychic and Flying. Bulbasaur also has a bad movepool and has to rely on Hidden Power Fire to do significant damage to Steel- and Poison-types, even with a Z-Celebrate boost, which can only be obtained once. Bulbasaur is also outsped by common Choice Scarf users such as Doduo and Rufflet. Bulbasaur also faces competition with Pumpkaboo-S, as both can use Z-Moves to boost all of their stats, and Z-Trick-or-Treat is obviously more useful than Z-Celebrate.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Due to Bulbasaur's shallow movepool, Bulbasaur has very few other options to use effectively. Hidden Power Ground can be used instead of Hidden Power Fire to hit Poison-types harder while still hitting Pawniard, but some of the most important Poison-types such as Gastly and Foongus aren't significantly damaged by it, and it leaves Bulbasaur completely walled by Ferroseed. A defensive set with Eviolite may work, but it's outclassed by Foongus, which has a better movepool and Regenerator. A set with Choice Scarf can be used, but Bulbasaur is terribly weak without boosts and has very few coverage options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Ponyta are huge threats to Bulbasaur, since they are faster than it without the Z-Celebrate boost and can boost their Speed via Flame Charge and Speed Boost, respectively. However, Bulbasaur hits these Fire-types hard enough with Sludge Bomb to 2HKO, and it can put them to sleep with Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Common Flying-types such as Vullaby and Doduo can threaten Bulbasaur with their strong STAB attacks, and they can use Choice Scarf to revenge kill Bulbasaur without forcing some Pokemon to be sacrificed to defeat it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Ferroseed, Pawniard, and Magnemite can threaten Bulbasaur if it's not running Fire-type coverage, and some of them can take one hit or two from it, even if it's running Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Ground.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Revenge killers such as Focus Sash Abra, Choice Scarf Amaura, and Choice Scarf Doduo can force Bulbasaur out if they don't just OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Mareanie and Foongus can easily take any hit from Bulbasaur and remove its Z-Celebrate boosts by using Haze or Clear Smog.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Celebrate paired with Normalium Z gives Bulbasaur an invaluable boost in every stat, transforming it into a huge threat. Sludge Bomb is its main STAB move, OHKOing Doduo and 2HKOing Vullaby, metagame staples, after a boost. Giga Drain is also a powerful STAB move and gives Bulbasaur a reliable form of recovery against Water- and Ground-types, OHKOing offensive variants of Staryu and Mudbray after a boost. Hidden Power Fire gives Bulbasaur a method of 2HKOing Pawniard and Ferroseed, but Sleep Powder can be used instead, as it is useful against slower targets and gives Bulbasaur a way to set up reliably, but its low accuracy makes it a risky option. Synthesis can be used in the fourth slot as well, since it gives Bulbasaur longevity, but Giga Drain already provides recovery and Hidden Power Fire or Sleep Powder is usually better.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Chlorophyll is the only available ability if Bulbasaur uses Celebrate, and Normalium Z is a must too. The Defense EVs on Bulbasaur allow it to take hits from strong physical attackers and be hard to revenge kill, as it survives one Ice Punch followed by a Mach Punch from Iron Fist Timburr after Stealth Rock damage. The rest of the EVs are invested in Special Attack and Speed, giving Bulbasaur more opportunities to sweep unprepared teams. Bulbasaur outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame after Z-Celebrate, but a Timid nature can be used instead of Modest to outspeed unboosted Nasty Plot Vullaby before using Z-Celebrate at the cost of making Bulbasaur much weaker; for example, a Modest nature ensures the 2HKO on Pumpkaboo-S after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bulbasaur is best used as a late-game sweeper or as a cleaner, so try to find setup opportunities against passive or slower Pokemon, such as Spritzee, Snubbull, and Timburr, by immobilizing them with Sleep Powder if Bulbasaur uses it on its set. Avoid setting up when your opponent has Pokemon that will eventually stop Bulbasaur, such as Steel-types and revenge killers. When playing against Pokemon that can check Bulbasaur effectively after a boost, use Sleep Powder to shut them down, but remember that Bulbasaur should stay healthy before it sets up. This includes avoiding status such as paralysis. Lastly, remove phazers such as Mareanie before setting up, as Bulbasaur is completely useless without the boosts provided by Z-Celebrate.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulbasaur pairs well with answers to Flying-types such as Pawniard, Onix, and Kabuto, since most of the Flying-types carry Choice Scarf and, as a result, must be removed to ensure Bulbasaur's sweep. Chinchou in particular helps Bulbasaur against Flying-types, Magnemite, and Fire-types, especially Ponyta. Other Water-types, such as Staryu and Mareanie, can help Bulbasaur face the aforementioned Fire-types. Trappers are really appreciated teammates; Diglett traps the Steel-, Poison-, and Fire-types that might stop Bulbasaur's sweep, such as Magnemite and Ponyta, and Alolan Grimer traps Abra and Gastly, which revenge kill Bulbasaur easily. Steel-type checks such as Mienfoo, Timburr, Ponyta, and Diglett are indispensable teammates as well, since Bulbasaur can't hit them effectively even with a boosted Hidden Power Fire. Solid answers to Poison-types, including Groundium Z Diglett, Mudbray, and Abra, are pretty good teammates too. Fire-types such as Ponyta appreciate Bulbasaur's ability to take down Water- and Ground-types while they remove Steel-types and Foongus. Entry hazard setters such as Kabuto and Ferroseed can wear down Pokemon to ease Bulbasaur's sweep. Lastly, Bulbasaur strongly appreciates a slow VoltTurn from Pokemon such as Mienfoo or even Larvesta because it can switch-in safely and use Z-Celebrate against passive Pokemon.</p>"

Keep in mind that Squirtle is quite weak, so its priority moves won't do much damage.

Its heavy reliance on Hustle makes Rattata an unoptimal breaker, as it depends on accuracy to land some important hits.

    "overview": "<p>Alolan Rattata packs tremendous offensive power, 2HKOing everything in the LC metagame; this is possible thanks to Hustle and STAB Double-Edge, which can at least heavily dent any neutral or frail target. It also has access to STAB Dark-type moves such as Crunch, two priority moves in Sucker Punch and Quick Attack, and a usable U-turn thanks to its good Speed. However, Alolan Rattata struggles to find a place in a team; it is outclassed by almost every Dark-type because it lacks Knock Off. It is also overshadowed by the majority of Normal-types, which have access to more coverage options. It lacks access to a boosting move, something other Dark-types such as Pawniard, Vullaby, and Scraggy have. Its typing gives it four weaknesses, including a terrible 4x weakness to Fighting-type moves, which are extremely common in the LC metagame. Its defenses are very thin, meaning it will be OHKOed by almost any move used against it; on top of that, it is forced to run both Hustle and Life Orb to do consistent damage, which have the negative effects of lowering its accuracy and HP.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice item sets may work because Alolan Rattata has access to Switcheroo. A Choice Scarf can turn it into a potent cleaner, while a Choice Band set can easily pulverize any neutral target. When it faces a wall it can't break through, it can simply use Switcheroo to disrupt it. Thief can be used in the final moveslot to steal opposing Pokemon's items and works well when Alolan Rattata has lost its Life Orb. It can be used on Sturdy + Berry Juice users like Onix, bulky walls such as Spritzee and Munchlax to hamper their walling abilities, or even slower Pokemon that rely on their specific items such as Cubone and Clamperl. Thick Fat sounds appealing at first because it gives Alolan Rattata two extra resistances to Fire- and Ice-type moves. However, these moves are not very common in LC bar sun and hail teams, and the Attack boost from Hustle is the superior choice to easily score KOs. Unlike regular Rattata, Alolan Rattata lacks any coverage options; most of all, it misses Rock Smash for the OHKO on standard Eviolite Pawniard.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Alolan Rattata has an unfortunate 4x weakness to Fighting-type moves, meaning that even Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave can OHKO it. Timburr and Mienfoo completely stop Alolan Rattata, using it as a setup bait for their Bulk Up without being scared too much by Double-Edge. Croagunk can exploit Alolan Rattata's weakness and proceed to KO it with Vacuum Wave or set up a Nasty Plot while Rattata switches out. Mankey Speed ties with Alolan Rattata and takes it out with its choice of STAB move. Stufful doesn't like taking a Double-Edge, but it can withstand it and KO Alolan Rattata back with Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Pawniard walls any combination of Alolan Rattata's moves, using it to set up Swords Dance. Vullaby can take a hit and retaliate with Brave Bird. Scraggy takes a Double-Edge and can recover its health back with Drain Punch.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Whatever can OHKO Alolan Rattata and take a Hustle Life Orb Double-Edge checks it. Defensive Chinchou can KO it with an Electric-type STAB move after Stealth Rock damage, Spritzee OHKOes it with Moonblast, Foongus can take a Double-Edge and use Giga Drain or Sludge Bomb or simply pivot out to recover health with Regenerator, and Onix KOes it with Rock Blast or sets up Stealth Rock on it thanks to high physical bulk allowing it to take Double-Edge and Crunch. Keep in mind, however, that Alolan Rattata dishes out enormous damage to neutral targets, Onix included.</p> <p><strong>Status and Residual Damage</strong>: Alolan Rattata is susceptible to burns and paralysis because they halve its Attack and Speed. Hail damage combined with Double-Edge and Life Orb recoil means that Alolan Rattata will not stay on the field more than two turns per battle.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Snubbull is a roadblock for Alolan Rattata; it can lower Alolan Rattata's Attack, making Double-Edge fail to 2HKO Eviolite variants, while it can simply OHKO with Play Rough or paralyze with Thunder Wave. Spritzee, although it is 2HKOed by Hustle Life Orb Double-Edge, can regain health with Wish and OHKO it even with uninvested Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Hustle</strong>: One of the things that hamper Alolan Rattata the most is its ability itself, which lowers the accuracy of all its moves by 20%. This can mean the difference between Alolan Rattata KOing and getting KOed.</p>",

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Double-Edge is the main STAB move Alolan Ratta should run, as it has enough power to outright OHKO the majority of neutral targets after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKO the bulkiest Pokemon in LC such as Spritzee and Munchlax. Return is a more conservative option that does not lower Alolan Rattata's HP but hits for less damage and, consequently, misses certain OHKOs. Sucker Punch is the best option for a Dark-type move because it boasts priority and can be used to pick off weakened targets; on the other hand, Crunch avoids the mind games used to counter Sucker Punch, such as the use of Substitute or other status moves. U-turn allows Alolan Rattata to escape a bad matchup and gives momentum to its team thanks to its good Speed. For the final moveslot, Pursuit can be used to trap Abra and Ghost-types; be careful against Abra, however, as it can outspeed Alolan Rattata and KO it. Quick Attack, on the other hand, gives Alolan Rattata a tool with which to pick off weakened targets that can't be easily played around like Sucker Punch. Finally, Crunch can be used as a secondary Dark-type STAB move if you chose Sucker Punch for the second moveslot.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs maximize what Alolan Rattata needs, its Attack and Speed stats. The remaining EVs are put into Defense to hit an extra point and to better take neutral and resisted priority moves such as Aqua Jet and Sucker Punch. Jolly is the only nature to use because Hustle already provides a boost in Attack and hitting 17 Speed is more important than having an extra point in Attack. Hustle is the chosen ability because it boosts Alolan Rattata's Attack by 50%, significantly enhancing its damage output. Life Orb in conjunction with Hustle turns Alolan Rattata into a potent physical attacker at the cost of just 1 HP per attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Alolan Rattata should never be sent directly into battle, as its pitiful defenses mean it will almost never be able to take a hit and retaliate. Alolan Rattata is a powerful but frail attacker that will spam its STAB moves most of the time. Be careful when using Sucker Punch, as even though it hits very hard, it can be easily played around with a bit of prediction, such as by using Will-O-Wisp with Gastly or Substitute with Abra; be wary of Abra in particular, as it can outspeed and KO Alolan Rattata if it doesn't use Sucker Punch or simply KO it if Abra has its Focus Sash intact. Alolan Rattata should be played as a hit-and-run attacker, since it already loses so much HP from Life Orb and Double-Edge recoil and can't afford to lose any from switching into attacks. When Alolan Rattata has a difficult matchup, don't hesitate to use U-turn to bring in a teammate that can deal with the opposing Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Alolan Rattata needs partners to deal with Pawniard, making Timburr and Croagunk good teammates; both KO it, with the former being a bulky setup sweeper that can absorb status moves like Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave and the latter being able to remove Fairy-types for Alolan Rattata. Slow U-turn and Volt Switch users like defensive Mienfoo and Chinchou help Alolan Rattata enter the field, working around its nonexistent defenses. Cottonee is a notable partner because it can absorb Knock Off and check Fighting-types while also having Prankster Z-Memento to restore Alolan Rattata's HP to allow it to stay around longer. Flying-types pair decently well with Alolan Rattata because they remove Bug- and Fighting-types. Archen in particular can also set up Stealth Rock for Alolan Rattata, which can turn most 2HKOs into OHKOs, while Choice Scarf Doduo can pick off opposing Pokemon that have been severely damaged by Alolan Rattata. Other Dark-types pair well with Alolan Rattata because it packs a lot of power that can overwhelm usual Dark-type checks; Pawniard can break through the opposing team and let Alolan Rattata clean the rest, while bulky Nasty Plot Vullaby forms a strong Dark-type core with Alolan Rattata, using the likes of Croagunk and Timburr as setup opportunities.</p>"

Access to Drill Run is appealing at face value, as it gives Spearow a tool to hit Rock- and Steel-type checks such as Onix and Magnemite hard, but similar Pokemon like Doduo and Rufflet carry moves such as Jump Kick and Superpower to deal with such Pokemon. These two Pokemon are also Spearow's most notable examples of competition, as they boast better offensive stats, access to Brave Bird, more powerful coverage moves, and in Rufflet's case, a far more useful ability in Hustle. Lastly, Spearow's paltry defenses and weaknesses to common Electric-, Rock-, and Ice-type attacks all contribute to its poor longevity.</p>",

  "Ekans": {
    "overview": "<p>Ekans carves itself a niche in LC as the only viable Coil sweeper, and it has quite an offensive presence after Coil boosts. Its expansive movepool includes many coverage moves like Earthquake and Sucker Punch to hit specific threats as well as utility options like Glare, and its typing grants it resistances to common Fighting-type moves as well as Fairy- and Poison-type moves, allowing it to check Pokemon like Timburr, Mienfoo, Spritzee, and Foongus. Furthermore, Ekans has great abilities in Intimidate, which lowers the foe's Attack, and Shed Skin, which can cure Ekans of status, easing its setup opportunities. These traits allow it to function well on offensive teams. Unfortunately, Ekans is fairly weak without Coil boosts, meaning it is easily played around. Ekans's main STAB move, Gunk Shot, has very low PP, so it has to worry about that when sweeping. Its typing leaves it vulnerable to common Ground-types like Diglett, which can trap and OHKO Ekans, as well as Mudbray and Onix. Ekans also is somewhat slow, so its sweeps can be stopped by fast, powerful attackers like Gastly and Abra. Lastly, Ekans faces competition from other Poison-types like Alolan Grimer and Croagunk, with the former having Poison Touch, Knock Off, and a better typing and the latter having a better typing, more setup opportunities, and greater power.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ekans can act as a specialized Choice Scarf user and revenge killer due to its great movepool and decent 24 Speed when fully invested. This set would have Gunk Shot and Earthquake and would utilize coverage options like Seed Bomb, Sucker Punch, and Aqua Tail depending on team needs and what Ekans needs to revenge kill. Ekans can revenge kill Gastly, Abra, all Dragon Dance sweepers at +1, and common Shell Smash users like Tirtouga with a Choice Scarf and specific coverage moves. However, Ekans doesn't appreciate being locked into a move, and it lacks power without Coil boosts. Ekans can utilize a defensive support set due to its access to both Glare and Toxic along with interesting options like Haze, Acid Spray, Gastro Acid, Disable, and Infestation. However, this set faces extremely heavy competition from Mareanie, Foongus, and Koffing, leading it to be inferior to the Coil set. Aqua Tail hits Ground-types like Mudbray and Hippopotas harder than Gunk Shot and can be used to deal with Archen as well. Toxic can be run on the Coil set to cripple defensive switch-ins to Ekans that can tank its attacking moves, such as Spritzee, Munchlax, Archen, and Vullaby. However, Ekans more often than not won't have room for the move. Furthermore, Toxic damage takes a while to rack up due to Pokemon in LC having low health. Ekans can threaten Abra and Gastly out with a potential Sucker Punch and surprise them with Pursuit, but since Ekans can easily be KOed, running Pursuit is very unreliable. Also, Pawniard and Alolan Grimer are much better users of the move due to them having a STAB bonus on it. Ekans has access to decent special moves such as STAB Sludge Wave and Sludge Bomb, Dark Pulse, and Giga Drain; however, it's best for Ekans to stick to physical moves, as its Special Attack is very low. Rest + Shed Skin can be run to act as pseudo-reliable recovery, but the inconsistency of Shed Skin renders it risky to use.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Offensive Ground-types such as Diglett and offensive Mudbray can outspeed and KO Ekans with their super effective STAB moves. They can also revenge kill Ekans even when it is boosted. Defensive Ground-types like Hippopotas and defensive Mudbray can easily switch into Ekans because they resist Gunk Shot, take Ekans's other attacks, and KO it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Abra and Gastly</strong>: If Ekans is not running Sucker Punch, Abra can easily outspeed Ekans and KO it with Psychic, while Gastly can revenge kill Ekans once it is weakened. However, Ekans can OHKO both of them with Sucker Punch at +1 and can also outspeed and revenge kill them when holding a Choice Scarf.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types like Onix, Dwebble, and Tirtouga resist Gunk Shot and can force Ekans out. Archen is especially problematic, as it also is immune to Earthquake, making it a reliable answer to Ekans. It can also 2HKO Ekans with Earthquake, though it must be careful of Glare or Toxic. These Rock-types are hit hard by Earthquake, and some need to be careful of Ekans's rarer coverage moves like Aqua Tail and Seed Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Pawniard and Magnemite are immune to Ekans's Poison moves and can take at least one Earthquake due to decent bulk and Sturdy, respectively. Ferroseed only takes neutral damage from Earthquake and can easily come in on even a boosted Ekans and use it to set entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Slowpoke, Hippopotas, Foongus, and Munchlax can easily take Ekans's main attacking moves.</p> <p><strong>Fast and Powerful Attackers</strong>: Fast, powerful attackers like offensive Pawniard, Carvanha, and Duduo can revenge kill Ekans and stop it from sweeping. They do not like switching into Ekans's attacks in general, though.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Coil Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Coil boosts Ekans's Attack, Defense, and accuracy, allowing it to sweep weakened teams. STAB Gunk Shot dents anything that doesn't resist it. After a Coil boost, Gunk Shot is 100% accurate and can OHKO frail Pokemon and 2HKO bulky Pokemon like Mienfoo and Staryu. Earthquake is used to hit Steel-types that are immune to Gunk Shot such as Ferroseed, Magnemite, and Pawniard, as well as Rock-types that resist Gunk Shot like Tirtouga and Onix. Sucker Punch gives Ekans priority and hits Gastly and Abra hard as well as faster weakened foes like Doduo. Glare is an alternative that can cripple faster threats, including Ground-types, allowing Ekans to set up on them; however, Sucker Punch is too valuable for hitting Pokemon like Gastly, Frillish, and Abra.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread gives Ekans 22 / 12 / 16 bulk, letting it take several decently powerful neutral hits while hitting a Defense number that allows it to efficiently boost with Coil. Intimidate drops the foe's Attack, allowing Ekans to force switches and have an easier time setting up. The given bulk along with Intimidate allows Ekans to take hits like offensive Vullaby's Brave Bird and Ponyta's Flare Blitz. Shed Skin can also be run to get rid of annoying status ailments that can deter Ekans's sweeps. Berry Juice gives Ekans more longevity and can heal it to full HP after it takes a hit when sweeping. A Careful nature is used to increase Ekans's special bulk because Coil already boosts Defense.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is best for Ekans to be used as a mid- or late-game sweeper when its checks have been weakened or removed, such as fast, powerful attackers like Carvanha and bulky Steel- and Ground-types like Ferroseed and Mudbray. Ekans can be switched into neutral and resisted physical attacks thanks to Intimidate, but it should not switch into powerful attacks like Life Orb Pawniard's Knock Off and Magnemite's Thunderbolt. Be careful against Diglett, as it can trap Ekans and OHKO it with Earthquake, and it has a faster Sucker Punch. Also be wary against Pawniard, as if Ekans is running Intimidate, its switch into Pawniard will give it a +1 Attack boost due to Defiant. Ekans can be switched into common Fighting-types like Mienfoo and Timburr thanks to Intimidate as well as into Fairy-types like Spritzee and Cottonee due to its Poison typing. It can then proceed to set up a Coil or use Glare on a predicted switch. Gunk Shot should be used conservatively due to its low PP until all Steel-types are removed, in which case it can use it liberally when sweeping. Earthquake should be used to hit Steel-types like Pawniard when sweeping. Sucker Punch should be used to KO Gastly and Abra as well as hit faster Pokemon before Ekans goes down. Glare can be used before setting up, as the paralysis will make it easier for Ekans to sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting-types such as Mienfoo, Scraggy, and Timburr appreciate Ekans's ability to handle Fairy-types, while they can weaken Steel-types for Ekans in return. Other Steel-type answers such as Diglett, Ponyta, and Mudbray can further pressure Steel-types and allow Ekans to have an easier time sweeping late-game. Water-types like Staryu and Carvanha can defeat Ground-types for Ekans, while it can check Grass-types for them in return. Ekans values Wish support from the likes of Spritzee, as Ekans can be worn down over the course of the match by switching into moves with Intimidate. In return, Ekans can take the Poison-type moves aimed at Spritzee. Ekans functions much better with Sticky Web support, as it will be able to threaten a wider range of foes; good Sticky Web users are Spinarak and Surskit. Knock Off users like Pawniard and Alolan Grimer can get rid of Eviolite on bulkier foes, allowing Ekans to take them out more easily when sweeping.</p>"

It is also largely outclassed by Drilbur in its role as a Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin user, though it has a higher Defense stat and access to the previously mentioned Knock Off. Furthermore, with the rise of Staryu, Sandshrew has become even more niche due to Staryu's ability to clear away Sandshrew's hazards and completely force it out with the threat of a Scald.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sandshrew's access to Poison Jab, Rock Slide, and Shadow Claw can be used as coverage options, but Drilbur can take advantage of them better. It also gets Swords Dance to boost its Attack, but it is simply too slow to make use of such a set. Eviolite can be replaced with Berry Juice, but Sandshrew's poor special bulk makes this hard to pull off. A fully offensive Sand Rush Sandshrew could work with Hippopotas, but the passiveness of Hippopotas makes this very hard to pull off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Although they sometimes struggle with switching in, a Scald from even a less powerful Pokemon can take advantage of Sandshrew's poor Special Defense. Sandshrew can also be setup fodder for common sweepers such as Shellder and Corphish. Staryu can clear hazards as well as hit Sandshrew with a very powerful Scald, while Sandshrew can do almost nothing back.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: Defog and Rapid Spin users such as Vullaby and Staryu can make one of Sandshrew's two main purposes, setting up Stealth Rock, obsolete.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Powerful special attackers such as Abra and Omanyte take advantage of Sandshrew's low Special Defense and usually OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types can easily take an Earthquake, and many can fire back with a powerful Grass-type move. Cottonee and Snivy stand out in this regard.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types aren't really threatened by anything Sandshrew can do as long as they can easily switch in to Stealth Rock. Also, many popular Flying-types get Defog or can set up on Sandshrew with a Nasty Plot or Swords Dance. Vullaby in particular can set up a possibly game-winning sweep.</p>",

      "Bulky Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin gives Sandshrew the ability to clear away entry hazards on your side of the field, helping many Pokemon stay healthy. Stealth Rock can help sweepers, passively damage foes upon switching in, and even at times bait Staryu in. Earthquake is Sandshrew's Ground-type STAB move and is a very powerful option to hit most of the tier. Knock Off is Sandshrew's main niche over Drilbur and lets it hit Pumpkaboo, something that Drilbur can't do normally, as well as provide even more utility to Sandshrew's team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sandshrew should always use Sand Rush, as Sand Veil is completely reliant on luck and doesn't help Sandshrew as much as Sand Rush does. The EV investment in Defense and Special Defense coupled with Eviolite maximizes Sandshrew's bulk, letting it endure many attacks it may not have otherwise. It also has 196 EVs in Speed so that it can reach a Speed tier of 13 in order to outspeed Croagunk and Timburr. The rest of the EVs are put into Attack and HP, the former to increase the damage of Earthquake and the latter to let it withstand more attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Always be careful of Flying-types such as Doduo and especially Vullaby, as Sandshrew can't do much against any of them with its lack of coverage. Baiting in Staryu with Stealth Rock can be a valid option if Sandshrew is paired with a good Staryu check, but this should be done very sparingly. Since Pumpkaboo and Gastly are common switch-ins to Rapid Spin, using Knock Off when predicting them to come in can cripple the former and KO the latter. Be aware of Sandshrew's low Special Defense; it can be easily KOed by many special attackers because of it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pumpkaboo makes for a perfect partner, as it can check Water-types (Staryu in particular) and Grass-types, as well as block opposing Rapid Spin users. Pawniard can help discourage an opponent from using Defog and therefore clearing away Sandshrew's hazards. Sandshrew's ability to clear away hazards can be extremely beneficial to Fire-, Bug-, and Flying-types such as Larvesta and Rufflet. Doduo in particular benefits greatly from Sandshrew's ability to to control hazards on both sides, as they can help it beat Sturdy users such as Onix and Magnemite. Cottonee and Foongus can check Fighting- and Water-types while providing some support with Taunt and Spore, respectively. Hippopotas can be a good option to help Sandshrew take advantage of Sand Rush, although Hippopotas's passivity can make it difficult to support Sandshrew.</p>"

  "Sandshrew-Alola": {
    "overview": "<p>With its new forme, ability, and movepool, Sandshrew has almost singlehandedly brought hail into viability in LC and has become a decent threat for teams to prepare for. It also has a relatively good offensive typing, although a 4x weakness to Fighting, along with weaknesses to Fire and Ground, can be detrimental under certain circumstances. Although best when functioning in hail, it can also be used outside of it as a Rapid Spin user and a relatively good attacker. Its Attack and Defense are also quite good. Additionally, not many Pokemon in LC can defend against +2 Alolan Sandshrew in Hail. However, keep in mind that its low Special Defense stat severely limits it against much of the tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set focused around Rapid Spin and extra bulk could work because it can get around Pumpkaboo-XL, but it suffers from its weaknesses to Fighting and Fire. Although it doesn't cover many Pokemon that Alolan Sandshrew doesn't already hit, Leech Life can give it some recovery against common Pokemon like Snivy and Abra, but Alolan Sandshrew uses a lot of other options better. Brick Break can be used to hit Ferroseed, but Earthquake covers many more threats and again Alolan Sandshrew uses many other options better. Alolan Sandshrew can also set up hail on its own, but this takes up an important moveslot that could easily be cleared up by a teammate like Snover or Amaura.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Almost every Fighting-type can OHKO Alolan Sandshrew, including priority users. Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave both OHKO Alolan Sandshrew if used by powerful Pokemon like Timburr and Croagunk and can stop a sweep right in its tracks.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: If they aren't weak to Earthquake, bulky Water-types such as Staryu and Frillish can survive any attack from Alolan Sandshrew and fire back with a powerful Scald with the chance to burn. Staryu OHKOes with an Analytic-boosted Hydro Pump after Alolan Sandshrew takes a turn of damage from Life Orb. Frillish more reliably burns Alolan Sandshrew with Will-O-Wisp and can block Rapid Spin. Slowpoke with Flamethrower or Fire Blast shuts down Alolan Sandshrew completely. Dewpider also resists all of Alolan Sandshrew's main moves and can wall it easily.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Since Alolan Sandshrew has extremely low Special Defense, any Sturdy user, Focus Sash user, or just bulky Pokemon in general such as Magnemite, Abra, or Staryu can be an issue, though Magnemite can be dealt with through entry hazards and Abra through Icicle Spear.</p> <p><strong>Bronzor</strong>: Bronzor completely walls everything that Alolan Sandshrew can do, making it the best possible counter to it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Hail Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Icicle Spear is Alolan Sandshrew's primary STAB option with 100% accuracy, taking advantage of LC's varying damage rolls as well as breaking the Focus Sash of Pokemon such as Abra and Diglett. Icicle Crash is its other Ice-type STAB option and is better for dealing with Mudbray's Stamina as well as having more reliable damage output, but it suffers from its lower accuracy. Iron Head works quite well as a secondary STAB move, as it's 100% accurate and has a useful flinch chance, making it a good default damage option. Earthquake provides very important coverage on Steel-types, Fire-types, and certain Water-types such as Mareanie and Chinchou, which is very important coverage. Swords Dance gives Alolan Sandshrew an extremely high Attack stat and essentially lets it knock out almost any Pokemon that doesn't resist all of its coverage. Rapid Spin provides utility outside of hail by letting it clear entry hazards. Finally, Knock Off can be used to cripple switch-ins and hit Frillish particularly hard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb provides some much-needed extra damage for Alolan Sandshrew, although it does take away from its utility in its good defensive bulk. Alternatively, Eviolite can make setting up Swords Dance as well as switching into hits much easier. Alolan Sandshrew is EVed with maximum Attack and enough Speed to outspeed or tie with most Choice Scarf Pokemon and many other sweepers that boost Speed such as Shellder and Omanyte. The rest of the EVs are put into Defense and HP to help it survive priority attacks, and since Alolan Sandshrew's low Special Defense doesn't let it survive much more even with extra investment, there is no need to add any more to that. Alolan Sandshrew's Adamant nature is the primary choice for extra Attack, but Jolly can be used to always outspeed 18 Speed Choice Scarf users such as Doduo and most sweepers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to keep Alolan Sandshrew healthy if it can make a dent in your opponent's team; this is less necessary if the opponent has Timburr or Croagunk, as they can easily stop an Alolan Sandshrew sweep. Alolan Sandshrew can also be played as a powerful attacker throughout the match to weaken the opponent's team for another late-game sweeper. Also, be careful when setting up Swords Dance or using Rapid Spin, as Alolan Sandshrew has extremely low Special Defense and can be easily OHKOed by most super effective moves, especially without Eviolite. If using Life Orb, be wary of switching Alolan Sandshrew in too much, as it can be worn down easily. Knock Off is best used on a predicted switch-in, as it can cripple its checks, especially Fighting-types like Mienfoo and Timburr. Finally, if you have a hail setter, always put it up before attempting to sweep with Alolan Sandshrew.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A hail setter is almost essential when using a sweeper set, and Snover and Amaura do this job quite well, as Snover covers Water-types and Amaura can set Stealth Rock. Notably, although it looks appealing, Alolan Vulpix doesn't have great synergy with Alolan Sandshrew, as it doesn't provide any of the extra coverage or utility that Snover and Amaura offer. Mareanie has good type synergy with Sandshrew, as it can check Fighting- and Fire-types while Alolan Sandshrew can provide coverage on Electric-types. Additionally, Foongus also checks Fighting-types alongside bulky Water-types that Alolan Sandshrew struggles against. Finally, Spikes and Stealth Rock support from Pokemon such as Dwebble and Ferroseed can help Alolan Sandshrew score some much-needed KOs.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Icicle Spear is Alolan Sandshrew's main STAB move and is a powerful multi-hit move that allows it to break Focus Sash, Sturdy, and Substitute, as well as heavily damage unboosted Weak Armor Vullaby. Iron Head is a powerful secondary STAB attack that hits Fairy-types such as Spritzee and Snubbull for sufficient damage while also hitting targets resistant to Icicle Spear like Alolan Vulpix and Munchlax, OHKOing the former and 2HKOing the latter. Rapid Spin gives Alolan Sandshrew a reliable way of quickly clearing the field of entry hazards and allows it to support its team. It does, however, risk turning Alolan Sandshrew into setup bait by locking it into an extremely weak move. Knock Off can be used as an alternative to cripple threats that attempt to switch in, as well as surprising spinblockers. Earthquake is useful for hitting Fire-types such as Ponyta and Vulpix and Steel-types likes Pawniard and Magnemite, all of which otherwise wall Alolan Sandshrew, for super effective damage. Icicle Crash is an option over Icicle Spear, as it allows Alolan Sandshrew to hit Mudbray for more consistent damage and hit harder than a two-hit Icicle Spear. It is also helpful for situations in which a two-hit Icicle Spear won't be capable of revenge killing a foe, such as Vullaby. However, this generally isn't preferred due to the better damage rolls Icicle Spear will usually score due to Little Cup's damage roll mechanics, as well as the move's worse accuracy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximized Speed EVs with a Jolly nature and Choice Scarf allow Alolan Sandshrew to hit 21 Speed and outpace the entire unboosted metagame. Maximized Attack EVs are useful for allowing Alolan Sandshrew to hit as hard as possible and dent a decent portion of the metagame with its attacks, notably OHKOing Weak Armor Vullaby with a three-hit Icicle Spear and OHKOing offensive variants of Ponyta with Earthquake. The remaining EVs are invested into Special Defense, as Alolan Sandshrew's physical bulk is already high enough to justify further boosting its rather lackluster special bulk. Slush Rush allows Alolan Sandshrew to outpace all Choice Scarf users that normally outpace it, such as Doduo and Rufflet, if hail happens to be summoned during the match.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Thanks to the good Speed Choice Scarf provides Alolan Sandshrew with, it is capable of revenge killing Pokemon like Diglett and Cottonee, as well as tearing holes in teams early-game or cleaning up late-game once its checks are removed or weakened. Alolan Sandshrew's good Speed with a Choice Scarf also allows it to function as a fairly reliable emergency stop to Nasty Plot Vullaby, whose Weak Armor ability leaves it extremely susceptible to an OHKO from Icicle Spear unless the move only hits twice. Despite its good Speed with a Choice Scarf, Alolan Sandshrew is still outsped and threatened by other common Choice Scarf users in Mienfoo, Rufflet, and Chinchou. As a result, these Pokemon must have their Choice Scarves scouted out on opposing teams to make full use of Alolan Sandshrew. Another big concern of Alolan Sandshrew is the tier's prevalence of Fighting-types like Mienfoo, Timburr, and Scraggy, which will tank a hit and OHKO Alolan Sandshrew. As a result, you should always switch Alolan Sandshrew out of healthy Fighting-types and remove them before Alolan Sandshrew attempts to clean late-game. If the opponent has a hail setter, Alolan Sandshrew is capable of utilizing its Slush Rush ability to outpace every Choice Scarf user in the metagame, thus allowing it to rip holes in the opposing team for as long as hail is active, though it's worth noting that these circumstances are rather rare. When predicting the switch into a Pokemon resistant to its STAB attacks, Alolan Sandshrew should either use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards from its team's side of the field or use Earthquake to hit the potential switch-in for super effective or neutral damage. It should be noted, however, that being locked onto Rapid Spin can easily make Alolan Sandshrew setup bait, due to the move's low Base Power. Lastly, due to its role as a revenge killer, it is best to bring Alolan Sandshrew into play carefully, such as on weak resisted hits or after a teammate has fainted.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to this set's role as a revenge killer, Alolan Sandshrew is most appreciated by offensive builds. Pokemon that bring in Flying- and Grass-types, such as Diglett, Cottonee, and Drilbur, appreciate Alolan Sandshrew's ability to remove the likes of Rufflet, Doduo, and Foongus for them. Pokemon that fear Diglett, such as Ponyta, Croagunk, and Chinchou, are also appreciative of Alolan Sandshrew, as its ability to revenge kill Diglett allows these Pokemon to perform their roles much more consistently. Reliable Fighting-type checks, such as Spritzee, Snubbull, Abra, and Foongus, are all capable of taking care of common Fighting-types in Timburr, Croagunk and Mienfoo and making it easier for Alolan Sandshrew to clean up late-game, though the former two can't reliably check Croagunk. Despite its access to Earthquake, Alolan Sandshrew is still very susceptible to Fire-type Pokemon. As a result, Pokemon capable of removing Fire-types such as Diglett, Mudbray, and Tirtouga are all quite helpful as partners. Pokemon capable of removing Water-types, such as Elekid, Chinchou, and Snivy, are also helpful, as Alolan Sandshrew's STAB attacks are resisted by most of LC's Water-types. Setup sweepers, such as Vullaby, Carvanha, and Timburr, appreciate Alolan Sandshrew's ability to weaken foes early-game and facilitate a more reliable late-game sweep. Knock Off support from the likes of Timburr, Vullaby, and Alolan Grimer is very useful for Alolan Sandshrew, allowing it to muscle past bulkier foes with better success. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Dwebble and Onix is also helpful for giving Alolan Sandshrew an easier time breaking through foes due to the chip damage they have taken. Lastly, bulky Water-types like Mareanie and particularly Slowpoke make great teammates, as they fit well on the bulky offense teams that Alolan Sandshrew thrives on and generally have good synergy with it.</p>"

  "Diglett": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite poor defensive stats and mediocre offensive stats, Diglett is one of the defining Pokemon of the Little Cup metagame thanks to its ability Arena Trap, which allows it to revenge kill grounded Pokemon without giving them the option to switch out. Diglett is helped in its revenge killing by a high Speed stat, which allows it to tie for the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the metagame, and a useful offensive typing that gives it super effective STAB coverage on a wide variety of Pokemon. Its moveset is also somewhat customizable, with its movepool including options such as Sucker Punch and Sludge Bomb, allowing it to, for the most part, trap and take on whatever Pokemon its team needs removed. A wide variety of support moves are also at its disposal, allowing Diglett to support its team after trapping the Pokemon it aims to eliminate.</p> <p>However, Diglett's poor defensive stats leave it unable to safely switch into the Pokemon it aims to trap and susceptible to opposing priority. It is forced to choose between a Focus Sash set, which lacks power, or a Life Orb set, which has no chance of switching into battle. Even with a Life Orb, Diglett is still quite weak, as it only reaches 15 Attack. Diglett is also easily revenge killed or set up on after trapping and KOing an opposing Pokemon thanks to its mediocre stats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Beat Up is an option on either Diglett set to reliably KO Focus Sash Abra on teams that need Abra removed but can't run a Pursuit trapper. It also can be used against Weak Armor Pokemon to lower their Defense stat for a teammate to revenge kill. An Eviolite set can be used to take weak attacks from Choice Scarf Magnemite among others, but Diglett will still get KOed by most attacks. Pursuit is a usable move on teams that really need Gastly removed. Final Gambit allows Diglett to take out slightly weakened bulky Pokemon that it otherwise could not with a regular attack, though Diglett's low base HP means that this rarely KOes. Diglett should not attempt to use Sand Force, as it makes a poor sand sweeper after the initial surprise value due to its susceptibility to revenge killing, poor power even with a Sand Force boost, and the fact that it is outclassed by Alolan Diglett in this role. Shadow Claw is an option that hits Gastly without forcing Diglett into Sucker Punch mindgames but hits little else. Similarly, Aerial Ace gives Diglett a way to hit Grass-types, but it is extremely weak and has little general use. Finally, Diglett can use Sunny Day to act as an alternate weather setter for sun teams, but this comes at the expense of a utility move such as Memento or a coverage move such as Rock Slide.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-type Pokemon are immune to Arena Trap, so Diglett cannot trap them, and they are immune to Diglett's STAB. Some, such as Vullaby, do not take significant damage from Diglett's attacks even if they do choose to stay in, and others, such as Doduo, can KO Diglett with powerful priority attacks.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Strong priority and Choice Scarf Pokemon can move before Diglett and easily take advantage of its low defenses to remove it from a match. Corphish, Pawniard, and Doduo are all common priority users that threaten Diglett.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-type Pokemon such as Snivy, Pumpkaboo, and Foongus can all easily KO Diglett, and the former two can use it as setup bait, with Snivy able to gain Special Attack boosts and potentially initiate a sweep just by KOing Diglett with Leaf Storm. Cottonee can also check Diglett if it is not running Sludge Bomb. However, these Pokemon are usually limited to revenge killing Diglett due to Arena Trap.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Many bulky Pokemon, including Spritzee, Slowpoke, and Timburr, are not KOed by Diglett's attacks and can easily KO in return. Corphish and Shellder are especially threatening, as they are bulky enough to take Diglett's attacks and can set up and initiate a sweep in return.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Trapper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is a reliable STAB move that allows Diglett to take out the Electric-, Steel-, and Rock-types that it aims to trap. If Groundium Z is run, Diglett can use Tectonic Rage, a powered-up version of Earthquake that will take out Pokemon that Earthquake could not normally KO, such as fast Mienfoo variants and slightly weakened Foongus and Staryu. Rock Slide allows Diglett to take out weakened Pokemon that are immune to Earthquake, such as Vullaby. Sucker Punch is useful against weakened or frail Choice Scarf users, such as Chinchou and slower priority users, such as Doduo. Sludge Bomb is an alternative that lets Diglett trap Cottonee and deal decent damage to other Grass-type Pokemon that aim to revenge kill it. Substitute allows Diglett to play mind games with Sucker Punch users such as Pawniard and, potentially, gives Diglett free turns against foes Choice-locked into Electric-type moves. Memento lets Diglett give a partner a free setup opportunity against the foe of its choice, with the opponent unable to switch out. Sludge Bomb remains an option in this slot, giving Diglett the ability to trap the Pokemon mentioned above. Stealth Rock can be used as well on teams that need it, as Diglett can use it after trapping and taking out a Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Diglett's Attack and Speed, with the remaining EVs giving Diglett an extra point in HP. With maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature, Diglett hits 20 Speed, outspeeding or tying with the entire unboosted metagame. Groundium Z is the preferred item to trap and remove key targets such as Knocked Off Mienfoo and Foongus from a much higher HP than otherwise possible. Life Orb is a viable alternative if the team already has a Z move, as it grants Diglett more consistent damage output. Arena Trap allows Diglett to be the metagame's top revenge killer, as it keeps grounded targets from switching out, allowing Diglett to KO them.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Diglett should be used to trap and revenge kill specific Pokemon throughout a match. It should almost never be switched into attacks, due to its frailty, but instead brought in by a slow pivot or after the opponent KOes a Pokemon. Scout out opposing Pokemon that may be equipped with a Choice Scarf early on, as Pokemon such as Chinchou and Magnemite that Diglett can often trap can also surprise and outspeed it with a Choice Scarf. If a foe is equipped with a Choice Scarf, Diglett should wait until it is within range of a Sucker Punch KO before trapping it. Be aware that, even with a Life Orb, Diglett is not particularly powerful and with a Groundium Z is even less so when not using Tectonic Rage. Thus, be careful of opposing Pokemon that could come in after Diglett KOes a Pokemon and use it as setup bait, including Timburr, Snivy, and Pumpkaboo-S. If Groundium Z is run, it should be used to power up Earthquake once, when Diglett needs to provide a KO for its team that Diglett's other coverage moves cannot provide. After getting the KOs it needs, Diglett can use its high speed to get off a Memento or Stealth Rock before being KOed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that appreciate Diglett's ability to remove Rock-, Steel-, Fire-, and Electric-type foes make the most obvious partners. Flying-types such as Vullaby and Rufflet appreciate Diglett dealing with all of these, as do Normal-types such as Aipom. Fairy-types such as Spritzee, which appreciate Diglett's ability to remove Poison- and Steel-types, make good partners, as do Grass-types, such as Snivy and Pumpkaboo-S, which appreciate the removal of Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-types. Slow pivots that can bring Diglett in safely make good partners as well. Mienfoo is one such option that also appreciates Diglett's ability to remove Ponyta and Poison-types, significantly damage most Fairy-types, and KO Cottonee if running Sludge Bomb. Chinchou also pairs fairly well with Diglett, as Diglett can trap opposing Chinchou for it to pivot more easily. If Diglett is running Groundium Z, Pokemon that appreciate its ability to KO bulky Fighting-types with Tectonic Rage make good partners, especially Carvanha and Scraggy. Pokemon that can take on the bulky Flying-types that don't mind Rock Slide are good partners for Diglett, especially Electric-types such as Elekid and Magnemite. Entry hazard support from the likes of Onix or Ferroseed helps Diglett safely secure more KOs and can break Magnemite's Sturdy to allow Diglett to trap it more safely. Similarly, Knock Off users, including Mienfoo and Pawniard, help Diglett secure more KOs it couldn't get otherwise by removing Eviolites and Berry Juices from foes, and can also remove Choice Scarves to help Diglett trap Pokemon such as Magnemite and Chinchou. Sticky Web setters, specifically Surskit, help Diglett by allowing it to outspeed grounded Choice Scarf Pokemon and trap them reliably.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is Diglett's most powerful STAB attack, letting it trap and take out Pokemon weak to Ground-type moves such as Ponyta and Onix. Diglett can also effectively trap Pokemon not weak to Ground-type with fairly significant prior damage. Rock Slide is Diglett's best coverage move, letting it hit Flying-types such as Vullaby and Doduo for super effective damage. Final Gambit can be used to usually remove bulkier Pokemon such as Foongus and Spritzee that have been weakened throughout the match but cannot be KOed with either Earthquake or Rock Slide. However, since Diglett has a terrible HP stat, some Pokemon may have to be severely weakened for this to be effective, and Diglett must keep its HP high in order to have Final Gambit remain effective. Memento can be used over Final Gambit on teams that rely on setup sweepers such as Shellder, Omanyte, Vullaby, and Zigzagoon. Final Gambit and Memento circumvent Choice Scarf Diglett often being setup bait after a revenge-kill. Beat Up helps Diglett trap and KO full HP Focus Sash Abra as long as Diglett has at least four healthy teammates. Pursuit is an option for Pokemon such as Gastly and Doduo that are not trapped by Arena Trap and attempt to switch out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Since this Diglett set is used as a revenge killer, most of its EVs are invested into Attack and Speed so it can reliably trap and take out as many Pokemon as possible. The remaining EVs are put into HP so that Diglett has a slightly stronger Final Gambit. A Jolly nature and Choice Scarf allow Diglett to outspeed every viable Choice Scarf user in the tier and also outpace many Pokemon at +2, including Shell Smash users such as Shellder and Omanyte, as well as Flame Charge Ponyta and Weak Armor Vullaby after they obtain a Speed boost. Arena Trap is Diglett's best ability, allowing it to to trap grounded Pokemon and remove threats to its team.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Diglett should almost never be switched into an attack, as its terrible bulk causes it to take a lot of damage even from weak attacks. If the team does not have the option of pivots to bring Diglett in safely, make sure to use it solely as a revenge killer once a Pokemon has fainted. Try to avoid situations where Diglett can be revenge killed by opposing Diglett or Pursuit trappers such as Alolan Grimer and Pawniard, which can take advantage of Diglett being locked into Rock Slide, Beat Up, or Pursuit. As it is quite hard to scout Choice Scarf Diglett due to its already great Speed stat, try to take advantage of this when playing against Pokemon that have the ability to set up. Diglett is able to outspeed Pokemon such as Shellder, Omanyte, Vullaby, and Ponyta after their Speed boosts and can deal with them afterwards. However, Diglett is very weak and is unable to 2HKO Pokemon such as Vullaby and Shellder. Try to deal with Pokemon such as Abra and Gastly early on with Diglett, as Beat Up relies on multiple Pokemon being alive and healthy in the party. However, Memento is more beneficial to use later on in the game in order to weaken the opposing Pokemon's stats so that a setup sweeper can clean late-game. Using Memento too early can result in a wasted setup opportunity, so make sure that the sweeper you are using is able to break through the remainder of the team before using Memento. Final Gambit should be used to open a hole in the opposing team for Diglett's teammates to exploit. For example, removing a Pokemon like Foongus can open the way for a Snivy sweep. Be wary of Pokemon that can easily boost on Diglett such as opposing Snivy, as they are able to use Diglett as setup fodder regardless of which move it is locked into.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Thanks to its Choice Scarf, Diglett is able to cover many weak points in a team. It is able to outspeed every unboosted Pokemon in the tier including every viable Choice Scarf user, letting it reliably revenge kill Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Magnemite and Pawniard to open doors for Pokemon such as Abra and Gastly to clean without being revenge killed. This also benefits defensive Pokemon such as Spritzee and Ferroseed that are passive enough to give free switches to both Pawniard and Magnemite. Choice Scarf Diglett also has the ability to trap opposing Life Orb or Groundium Z Diglett from the field. This is amazing for Pokemon such as Ponyta, Mareanie, and Alolan Grimer, as they are less threatened to stay in. Diglett can also outspeed and revenge kill opposing setup sweepers such as Shellder and Omanyte, which works really well with more offensive Pokemon that can be taken advantage of by these setup sweepers, such as Amaura and Doduo. As Diglett is unable to switch in on Pokemon, slow pivots such as bulky Mienfoo and Vullaby are good partners for it, as they can absorb hits and U-turn into Diglett safely, letting it trap Pokemon without having to take prior damage. Pokemon that benefit from Memento support are brilliant with Diglett, as it is able to pick and choose which Pokemon it wants to trap and Memento on. Zigzagoon and Shellder are some of the best recipients of this utility, as they are able to sweep teams with just one turn of setup. Knock Off users such as Pawniard and Timburr are good partners for Diglett, as they can Knock Off Eviolites throughout a match, making it easier for Diglett to trap Pokemon such as Foongus and Mienfoo. Pokemon that can handle Flying- and Ghost-type Pokemon are really handy as teammates for Diglett. Onix and Alolan Grimer are excellent choices, as they can deal with Pokemon such as Vullaby and Gastly with ease. As Choice Scarf Diglett is so easy to set up on by bulkier Pokemon such as Snivy and Timburr, it is beneficial to pair it with a Pokemon that can reliably check them such as Foongus or Vullaby.</p>"

      "Focus Sash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is a fairly powerful STAB move that allows Diglett to take out most Rock-, Steel-, Fire-, and Electric-type Pokemon. Sucker Punch gives Diglett a form of priority to outspeed and take out weakened priority users, such as Doduo. Memento can be used instead so that Diglett can give a teammate a setup opportunity after it is weakened itself. Rock Slide allows Diglett to hit Flying-types and other Pokemon that resist Earthquake. Sludge Bomb is an alternative that does a fair amount of damage to Grass-types, specifically Cottonee. Memento can also be used in the final moveslot; if it is not, however, Reversal gives Diglett an extremely powerful attack that hits Pokemon such as Scraggy super effectively after it survives an attack using its Focus Sash, and Stealth Rock can give a team a Stealth Rock setter if it can't fit the move in elsewhere.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Diglett's Attack and Speed are maximized to enable it to revenge kill as best it can. The remaining EVs are put into HP, boosting it by one point. With 236 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature, Diglett hits 20 Speed, outspeeding or tying with every unboosted LC Pokemon. A Focus Sash lets Diglett safely switch in on one attack and use its Speed to outspeed and take out the foe. Arena Trap is the preferred ability because it keeps Diglett's foes from switching out, making it an extremely effective revenge killer.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Diglett should be brought in against a Pokemon it can trap to remove it from the match. If entry hazards are up or Diglett's Focus Sash is no longer intact, it shouldn't be switched in at all, but instead saved as a revenge killer only. If Diglett's item will remain intact, it can come in safely against a Pokemon it can hit super effectively with Earthquake, take a hit with Focus Sash, and KO. Scouting for opposing Choice Scarf users is helpful, as Pokemon that Focus Sash Diglett could normally beat, such as Pawniard and Chinchou, cannot be switched into if they are equipped with a Choice Scarf. Be cautious of the fact that Diglett is not particularly strong and can become setup bait for Pokemon it doesn't hit super effectively with Earthquake. Bulkier setup sweepers, including Nasty Plot and Z-Mirror Move Vullaby variants, Scraggy, Shellder, and Snivy can be especially troubling. If Diglett's Focus Sash is intact, it can act as a last-ditch stop to setup sweepers such as Omanyte, either by KOing them or by using Memento to lower their attacking stats.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Focus Sash Diglett is the best option on teams that need Diglett to be able to take a single hit and take out a foe. Hazard control is absolutely necessary for this Diglett set to perform its role effectively, as entry hazards will break its Focus Sash and limit its overall effectiveness. Staryu and Drilbur can both use Rapid Spin to remove hazards, and Vullaby can use Defog. Diglett is appreciated by anything that enjoys the removal of Rock-, Steel-, Fire-, and Electric-types. Vullaby, Rufflet, and Doduo appreciate Diglett taking out Rock- and Steel-types, Chinchou appreciates its ability to take out opposing Electric-types, and Grass-type attackers such as Snivy appreciate its ability to take out Steel-, Fire-, and Poison-types. Diglett also appreciates support from strong attackers, such as Abra and Timburr, to help it get KOs despite its mediocre Attack stat by softening up the opposition. Knock Off support from the likes of Mienfoo, Pawniard, and Cottonee also weakens opposing teams by removing foes' Eviolites for Diglett to deal with more easily. Entry hazard support is appreciated as well, with Pokemon such as Onix and Omanyte performing this role well. Diglett's Rock Slide is quite weak, so Pokemon that can weaken bulky Flying-types, which are immune to Earthquake, is appreciated. Electric- and Rock-type Pokemon provide this support well. If Memento is run, Pokemon that can take advantage of Memento support, such as Shellder and Zigzagoon, make good partners. Lastly, Sticky Web support from Surskit allows Diglett to outspeed even Choice Scarf users and more reliably trap foes for its team.</p>"

  "Diglett-Alola": {
    "overview": "<p>Alolan Diglett has some perks that make it worth using as a sand sweeper. While it is slower than its regular forme, it's still fast enough to outspeed most of the unboosted metagame. It also has a decent offensive typing, letting it check opposing weather teams and other threats to sand teams. In addition, it boasts great coverage between its STAB moves and Rock Slide, all of which are also boosted by Sand Force.</p> <p>However, Alolan Diglett is not really a good Pokemon overall. First off, despite its base Defense being 5 points higher than that of its regular forme, it's still incredibly frail. This leaves it weak to many different priority moves, such as Mach Punch and Aqua Jet, making it easy to pick off. In addition, it faces competition from other Ground-types such as regular Diglett, which is faster and can trap; Mudbray, which is stronger and bulkier; and Drilbur, which has Rapid Spin and Mold Breaker. Alolan Diglett has a niche as a sand sweeper thanks to Sand Force and STAB Iron Head, but it struggles outside of sand teams and this niche.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Alolan Diglett has plenty of other options for items; Focus Sash usually allows it to take at least one hit before fainting, while running both Rockinium Z and Sandstorm allows it to set up its own sandstorm and grab a free Speed boost. Darkinium Z with Memento is also a good option, allowing Alolan Diglett to cripple a foe while giving its teammate a free switch and a chance to set up. However, Alolan Diglett will deal far less damage without a Life Orb. Tangling Hair provides a way to slow down physical attackers, which could be useful, but it is unviable because it requires Alolan Diglett to take a hit. This will likely result in Alolan Diglett getting OHKOed, and the opponent can get rid of the Speed drop by switching out.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Any Pokemon with access to priority moves (barring Extreme Speed and Fake Out) can revenge kill Alolan Diglett before it can attack. Examples include Mach Punch from Timburr and Aqua Jet from Carvanha.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Even in a sandstorm, Alolan Diglett can't OHKO everything. This means Pokemon that can take a hit, like Eviolite Mienfoo and Staryu, will beat Alolan Diglett one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Regular Diglett and Choice Scarf users such as Mienfoo can outspeed and OHKO Alolan Diglett due to how frail it is.</p> <p><strong>Bronzor</strong>: Bronzor is a nightmare for Alolan Diglett to face, as it completely walls all of its main attacks and can OHKO back with Earthquake. Sucker Punch does quite a bit to it if predicted correctly, but Alolan Diglett should otherwise switch out of it immediately.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sand Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake and Iron Head are the obligatory STAB attacks, and both also receive a boost from Sand Force. Alolan Diglett usually cannot take advantage of Iron Head's chance to flinch due to its frailty, as if it doesn't get the foe to flinch it will usually be OHKOed in return. Rock Slide hits Flying- and Bug-types harder, Vullaby and Larvesta being common targets, and is also boosted by Sand Force. Substitute can let Alolan Diglett actually take a hit, allowing it to attack safely. Substitute also lets it dodge Sucker Punch and helps on a predicted switch. Finally, Sucker Punch can be used for priority, but it is rather weak due to not being boosted by Sand Force.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb is the preferred item on this set, letting Alolan Diglett hit very hard when combined with Sand Force. Maximum Attack and Speed with a Jolly nature let Alolan Diglett hit as hard as possible while outspeeding the majority of the unboosted metagame. The remaining EVs allow it to take physical attacks better. In terms of the ability, Sand Force powers up Alolan Diglett's STAB attacks and Rock Slide by 30% in a sandstorm, letting it do serious damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Send Alolan Diglett in mid- or late-game after softening up its counters, and proceed to sweep with its STAB attacks and Rock Slide. It's not really a good idea to use Alolan Diglett without sand up, as this decreases its damage output. Alolan Diglett can OHKO opposing weather setters with the exception of Eviolite Snover, but you might want to switch out afterwards to get the sandstorm back up. Finally, you may not want to switch in directly; instead, bring it in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch, or to revenge kill after a teammate has fainted.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Alolan Diglett functions best in a sandstorm, it's a good idea to have Hippopotas for setting it up. Alolan Diglett can check Ice-types such as Snover that threaten Hippopotas. Lileep is a good defensive teammate, as it can take any Water-type attacks aimed at Alolan Diglett due to its typing and Storm Drain. It also gets a Special Defense boost from the sandstorm, increasing its overall longevity. However, where Alolan Diglett really shines is on sand offense. Abra can check the Fighting-types that threaten Alolan Diglett and, thanks to Magic Guard, is not hurt by the sandstorm. Magnemite works as both an offensive and defensive teammate, and can easily take care of bulky Water-types such as Shellder. It also can bring Alolan Diglett in unharmed with a slow Volt Switch. Finally, Knock Off users like Pawniard and Mienfoo can remove Eviolites from troublesome Pokemon so that Alolan Diglett can come in and OHKO them. Vullaby is an excellent Knock Off user, but it can also bring Diglett in with U-turn and has Overcoat to avoid sandstorm damage.</p>"

  "Meowth": {
    "overview": "<p>Meowth carves itself a niche as an excellent revenge killer with its Fake Out + Feint combination, which is considerably powerful thanks to STAB combined with Technician. In tandem with Fake Out, Feint can take care of many sweepers like Abra, Zigzagoon, and Carvanha without opposition. Meowth also hits the coveted 19 Speed tier, allowing it to outpace almost the entire unboosted metagame, including threats like Mienfoo and Chinchou, and Speed tying with Ponyta. It's also an excellent anti-lead that is able to reliably take care of Onix and Dwebble. Unfortunately, Meowth is beaten by common priority attacks like Vacuum Wave and Mach Punch. It suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, as it's unable to carry all the coverage it needs, forcing it to be vulnerable to at least one of its checks. It's also incredibly frail and will usually get knocked out if it can't KO what's in front of it. Meowth is forced to run Life Orb, as it's fairly weak without one.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Nasty Plot set using Round can be run, but since Meowth generally has a hard time finding times to set up, and the Fake Out + Feint combination is so powerful, it struggles to find use over other special attackers like Nasty Plot Vullaby or Alolan Meowth. Meowth can run a Naughty nature to fully maximize its Attack, but the loss of a Speed point is huge, and this nature doesn't help Meowth secure any notable KOs. Hidden Power Fighting gives Meowth a far better matchup against Pawniard, but its other coverage options are generally more helpful. Taunt makes Meowth an ever stronger anti-lead, but Meowth usually would rather just use an attack. Hypnosis can put Meowth's checks to sleep, but its terrible accuracy makes this strategy unreliable; if Meowth fails to put its foe to sleep, it will likely be KOed due to its terrible bulk. Seed Bomb beats Chinchou and Tirtouga but struggles to find a use over Meowth's other moves. Icy Wind slows down Pokemon that threaten the rest of the team and hits Flying- and Ground-types like Vullaby and Drilbur super effectively. However, it's weak and, again, fights to see use over Meowth's other coverage moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Pawniard, Magnemite, and Ferroseed can all easily take Meowth's moves and hit back hard. They have to watch out for Hidden Power Fighting or Fire, but these are generally rare moves on Meowth.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Croagunk and Timburr both have access to Vacuum Wave and Mach Punch, respectively, beating Meowth before it can use Aerial Ace.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Tanks</strong>: Spritzee and Ferroseed can take a Fake Out and Feint combination with little trouble and are able to 2HKO Meowth back with their attacks.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Diglett, Elekid, and Choice Scarf users like Chinchou and Bunnelby can outspeed and KO Meowth. However, they take significant damage from Feint and should only try to revenge kill it after Fake Out has been used up. Choice Scarf Gastly, in particular, can ignore Fake Out and Feint and KO Meowth with Sludge Bomb.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With Technician and STAB factored in, Meowth's Fake Out hits a Base Power of 90, making it the strongest Fake Out in LC. This can deal a hefty chunk of damage to a foe without them being able to do anything back. Feint is more reliable than Fake Out, as it works on any turn; it goes through Protect and is still boosted by STAB and Technician. However, Feint is weaker and doesn't have the flinch bonus that Fake Out does. Return is an option for more power, OHKOing Alolan Vulpix, 2HKOing Staryu, and 2HKOing offensive variants of Vullaby after Stealth Rock. If you want to take full advantage of Meowth's power, you can run Double-Edge; it OHKOes Life Orb Staryu, and Fake Out + Double-Edge KOes Ponyta. However, this wears down Meowth very quickly in tandem with Life Orb recoil. Water Pulse is an incredibly important move, KOing Dwebble and Onix after their Sturdy has been broken. It also KOes other leads like Drilbur after a Fake Out. Aerial Ace is Meowth's best way of hitting Fighting-types; Fake Out into an Aerial Ace KOes Mienfoo. Knock Off is an option, letting Meowth remove items and soften up its foes. It also hits Ghost-types that otherwise wall Meowth like Gastly and Pumpkaboo. Finally, U-turn lets Meowth do damage while switching and gain momentum, especially due to its great Speed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>19 HP IVs should be run to minimize Life Orb recoil to only 1 HP per turn. A Hasty nature allows Meowth to reach its maximum Speed at 19, outspeeding most of the unboosted metagame and Speed tying with Ponyta, Abra, and Staryu. 36 Special Attack EVs net the Water Pulse KO on Archen after a Fake Out. The combination of Technician and Life Orb boosts Meowth's power; Fake Out, Feint, Water Pulse, and Aerial Ace are all boosted by Technician. 36 Special Defense EVs let Meowth take Alolan Grimer's Fire Blast.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Meowth is an excellent anti-lead that is able to beat Mienfoo and Onix, so leading with it is often a safe choice. If possible, try to scout whether the Onix is Weak Armor or Sturdy, as using Fake Out on the former is counterproductive. Don't switch Meowth in on attacks if you can, however, as it is very frail and best suited to come in after a slow U-turn or as a revenge killer. Feint should be played to its strengths; for example, use it against common Protect users like Carvanha. Keep Meowth healthy throughout the match, as its ability to reliably deal high amounts of damage is valuable mid- and late-game. If your team struggles against a certain sweeper, preserve Meowth so it can deal a large chunk of damage with its Fake Out and Feint. If you're running U-turn or Knock Off, be sure to use them on predicted switches to keep up momentum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Meowth is best suited for hyper offensive teams that struggle to break through setup sweepers. Fighting-type checks are incredibly helpful to Meowth. Pokemon like Snubbull and Mudbray can threaten Timburr and Croagunk, respectively. Slow, bulky Pokemon with moves like Volt Switch and U-turn help Meowth get in safely, which Meowth highly appreciates thanks to its low bulk. Examples include Mienfoo, Chinchou, and Magnemite. It's also very helpful to run a Pokemon that covers whatever weakness Meowth has from its missing coverage; for example, if you run U-turn over Aerial Ace, use a Fighting-type check like Spritzee. If you're not running Knock Off, Meowth appreciates Knock Off support; without Eviolite, few Pokemon can take Meowth's STAB priority combination. Mienfoo and Pawniard both offer good Knock Off support. Pursuit trappers like Pawniard and Alolan Grimer can remove Ghost-types that otherwise wall Meowth. Since Meowth is heavily walled by Pawniard, Pawniard checks like Mienfoo, Ponyta, and Timburr can help alleviate this weakness. Meowth appreciates entry hazard support to make Fake Out and Feint's KO chance higher. Pokemon like Onix, Archen, and Pawniard can set up Stealth Rock. Finally, other Normal-types like Doduo and Bunnelby share checks with Meowth, allowing them to all wear down their checks together.</p>"

  "Meowth-Alola": {
    "overview": "<p>Alolan Meowth may seem hampered by its mediocre stats, but it has blazing Speed and access to Parting Shot, making it the fastest user of the move. It is also the fastest unboosted Dark-type in the tier, allowing it to lure in Pokemon like Spritzee and Timburr before using Parting Shot to bring in another teammate. Darkinium Z can turn Parting Shot into Z-Parting Shot, allowing Alolan Meowth to not only lower the foe's stats but also heal a teammate coming in, making it an excellent one-time pivot. Technician boosts the power of Alolan Meowth's main coverage move, Hidden Power Fighting, and Nasty Plot boosts its offensive prowess. However, Alolan Meowth is hampered by its fragility, subpar damage output, and lackluster movepool. While it helps get teammates into play, it is difficult to get into play itself and faces competition from other Dark-types like Nasty Plot Vullaby due to their better bulk and offensive presence.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Due to Technician, Alolan Meowth is able to have a 90-Base Power coverage option in Hidden Power of any type except for Fairy or Normal. Hidden Power Poison is one of the most appealing options, OHKOing Cottonee and 2HKOing Spritzee after Stealth Rock. However, this forces Alolan Meowth to use Thunderbolt to hit Pawniard, making it less than ideal. Hidden Power Ground still hits Pawniard, KOing it after a Nasty Plot boost and hitting Alolan Grimer as well. Hidden Power Flying can hit Mienfoo and Timburr hard on the switch but again makes Pawniard a problem. Physical Alolan Meowth sets can be somewhat appealing but are far weaker than their special counterparts and are generally done better by regular Meowth. Aerial Ace can hit Fighting-types and Cottonee, but it is weak and only a 2HKO on these Pokemon. Hypnosis can be handy to induce sleep on switch-ins, but its accuracy makes it incredibly risky, since if Alolan Meowth misses, it will be in a bad spot due to its fragility. Fake Out is another choice, as priority never hurts, but Alolan Meowth doesn't have the room to run it. Again, regular Meowth is a far better Fake Out user.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types like Mienfoo and Timburr resist Alolan Meowth's Dark Pulse and can deal a lot of damage back to it with their STAB moves. Croagunk resists both Dark Pulse and Hidden Power Fighting, so Alolan Meowth can only really touch it if running Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types like Cottonee and Snubbull do not care about any of Alolan Meowth's attacks. They resist Dark Pulse and Hidden Power Fighting, which makes them very good switch-ins to Alolan Meowth, although some fear the pivot out into a trapper or counter. Spritzee, in particular, can take even a boosted Thunderbolt without issue and avoid Taunt thanks to Aroma Veil.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Tanks</strong>: Pokemon like Munchlax and Alolan Grimer can switch into Alolan Meowth's special attacks fairly well and retaliate with strong STAB moves. Vullaby can also prove to be a nuisance if Thunderbolt is not used.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Alolan Meowth is very frail, so strong priority moves like Mach Punch, Aqua Jet, and Vacuum Wave really hurt it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Z-Parting Shot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Parting Shot allows Alolan Meowth to pivot around, keeping up momentum and lowering the foe's offensive stats, while Z-Parting Shot can be used to fully heal a crucial teammate. Dark Pulse is Alolan Meowth's strongest STAB attack, OHKOing Gastly and 2HKOing Slowpoke, and Hidden Power Fighting provides decent coverage alongside Dark Pulse, hitting Dark-types super effectively and Fighting-types neutrally. Hidden Power Fighting also gets a nice boost in power from Technician. Taunt allows Alolan Meowth to prevent the use of status moves, stopping the likes of Dwebble and Surskit from setting up entry hazards and Pokemon that may use Alolan Meowth as setup bait, such as Timburr and Vullaby. Thunderbolt allows Alolan Meowth to have some offensive presence in the face of most Fairy-types and bulky Water-types like Mareanie, and it hits Vullaby as well.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>200 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Alolan Meowth to hit its maximum Speed, outspeeding Pokemon like Doduo and Gastly. 200 Special Attack EVs give Alolan Meowth usable offensive presence, and Technician brings Hidden Power Fighting to a Base Power of 90. Darkinium Z gives access to Z-Parting Shot. The leftover EVs are invested into HP and Special Defense to make Alolan Meowth slightly bulkier.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Alolan Meowth should be played in a hit-and-run manner, using Parting Shot when it can to keep up momentum. Z-Parting Shot should be used when a crucial teammate, such as a setup sweeper, needs its HP recovered. Parting Shot's ability to drop the foe's stats can give room for a teammate like Shellder or Scraggy to set up and sweep. If no teammates particularly need Z-Parting Shot but Alolan Meowth is about to faint, Dark Pulse can be turned into Black Hole Eclipse, which can be used as a last resort due to its damage output. Note that Z-Parting Shot only fully recovers HP and does not heal status conditions or restore PP. Z-Parting Shot also gives the opportunity for a teammate to wallbreak early-game, then come back to clean up after a heal. Be sure to use Taunt on a predicted status move, like Spore from Foongus or Stealth Rock from Onix. Since Alolan Meowth is frail, get it in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch instead of switching it directly into attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sturdy Fighting-type checks are necessary. Snubbull is a good example, as it is able to keep up offensive momentum while benefiting from Z-Parting Shot. Shellder and Tirtouga can utilize Parting Shot to set up Shell Smash. Poison Jab Timburr can lure in and remove Fairy-types for Alolan Meowth, and it can also take advantage of Parting Shot's momentum and Z-Parting Shot's recovery.

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot is used to set up in order to sweep an enemy team when counters are gone. STAB Dark Pulse OHKOes Slowpoke after Stealth Rock at +2 Special Attack. Technician-boosted Hidden Power Fighting hits Pawniard especially hard, as well as other Dark-types like Scraggy and Carvanha. Thunderbolt is Alolan Meowth's best third coverage option, hitting Fairy-types like Spritzee neutrally and having a nifty, though extremely unreliable, paralysis chance. Thunderbolt also hits Vullaby as well as bulky Water-types like Mareanie. Parting Shot allows Alolan Meowth to pivot when it's in danger and weakens the foe's offenses, but it makes it harder to sweep.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>19 HP IVs allow Alolan Meowth to take only 1 HP of damage from Life Orb recoil. Maximum Speed is needed to outspeed threatening wallbreakers like Doduo and Gastly. Technician powers up Hidden Power Fighting, and Life Orb raises Alolan Meowth's offensive presence. 40 Special Defense EVs make Alolan Meowth less vulnerable to Croagunk's Vacuum Wave and resisted special attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Alolan Meowth's Dark Pulse and coverage moves can be used early-game to weaken switch-ins and its own checks. Hidden Power Fighting should be used to hit Dark- and Steel-types hard. As Pawniard gains +3 Attack from switching into Parting Shot, try to use Hidden Power Fighting on its switch in to avoid catastrophe. Nasty Plot should be used on forced switches, such as against Gastly and Pumpkaboo-XL, to try and sweep. It can also be used against setup bait like Slowpoke. Try not to switch Alolan Meowth directly into attacks, as it is quite frail. Instead, try to get it in safely with a slow pivot teammate.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Poison Jab Timburr helps lure in and weaken Spritzee and Cottonee, which Alolan Meowth struggles with. VoltTurn users like Mienfoo and Chinchou can be used to keep up momentum and get Alolan Meowth in play. Croagunk and Foongus also beat Timburr, Mienfoo, and Spritzee, which wall Alolan Meowth. Cottonee handles most Fighting-types well enough and can use Memento for setup opportunities. Diglett with Groundium Z can pick off unsuspecting Timburr; Diglett is also able to trap and remove Cottonee with Sludge Bomb and has access to Memento for even more support.</p>"

  "Mankey": {
    "overview": "<p>Mankey is a revenge killer whose main niche over other Fighting-types is its access to Gunk Shot, which allows it to significantly damage Fairy-types, and Close Combat, which is one of the strongest Fighting-type moves. It also has other coverage moves such as Earthquake to hit Poison-types and Ice Punch to hit Foongus and Pumpkaboo, and a pivoting tool in U-turn, allowing Mankey to gain momentum, all of which are backed up by a great Attack stat and the respectable 17 Speed tier. Thanks to Defiant, it is also able to gain +2 Attack whenever it is affected by Sticky Web, Defog, or Intimidate. However, Mankey cannot take hits and is vulnerable to priority attacks due to its poor bulk, which is only amplified after Close Combat's defense drops. It faces heavy competition from other Fighting-types, primarily Mienfoo, as it is able to perform Mankey's role of a revenge killer far more consistently. In addition, Mankey's lack of Knock Off means that it has a tough time getting past Ghost-types, and while Defiant is a good ability, it is very situational and hard to make use of with Mankey's low bulk.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Life Orb can be used to deal a lot more damage, but Mankey loses out on the added Speed from Choice Scarf, making it easier to revenge kill. Vital Spirit allows it to switch into Foongus's Spore. As for moves, Mankey has a couple of options: Night Slash is Mankey's only way of hitting Ghost-types super effectively, but it is hard to find room for it. Similarly, Rock Slide can be used to hit Flying-types and Larvesta a lot harder, but it's hard to find a moveslot for it, and most of the common Flying-types take neutral damage from Close Combat. Thunder Punch allows Mankey to hit Water-types such as Staryu and Slowpoke, but it is not very strong. Bulk Up can be used to increase Mankey's Attack and Defense, but this is mostly outclassed by Timburr due to its access to Drain Punch and far superior bulk. Mankey can use support moves such as Encore and Taunt; however, Mankey doesn't make good use of them due to its poor bulk and average Speed without a Choice Scarf equipped.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Frillish and Pumpkaboo-XL are immune to Close Combat, don't mind Mankey's other coverage attacks, and can halve Mankey's Attack with Will-O-Wisp. Gastly completely walls Mankey, as it is immune to or 4x resists Mankey's coverage options on the main set. However, all these Pokemon should watch out for the rare Night Slash.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Croagunk and Mareanie don't mind switching in on Mankey's attacks other than Earthquake, and Croagunk can KO Mankey with Sludge Bomb after some chip damage, while Mareanie can burn it with Scald. Foongus doesn't take much damage from Mankey's attacks and is able to render it helpless with Spore and 2HKO it with Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: While they cannot switch in on a Close Combat, Vullaby and Rufflet can both OHKO Mankey with a super effective Flying-type move. Choice Scarf Doduo outspeeds Mankey and OHKOes it with Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Slowpoke does not take much damage from Mankey's attacking options, though it should be careful of switching in on U-turn, while Abra can revenge kill Mankey with Psychic.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat is Mankey's most powerful STAB move and 2HKOes most threats it hits neutrally, but it lowers Mankey's defenses after each use. Gunk Shot is used against Fairy-types that resist Close Combat, and it OHKOes Cottonee and Snubbull while 2HKOing Spritzee after Stealth Rock. U-turn allows Mankey to scout the foe and provide momentum for the team, which is great with a Choice Scarf. Earthquake is able to 2HKO Croagunk and Mareanie, both of which resist Mankey's other moves. Ice Punch is an alternative option to hit Foongus and Pumpkaboo super effectively, although it is not very strong.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>196 Attack and Speed EVs are used to maximize Mankey's offensive capabilities. A Jolly nature and Choice Scarf allow Mankey to hit 25 Speed, outspeeding all Choice Scarf users up to 16 Speed like Pawniard and Bunnelby. An Adamant nature can also be run, however, as it allows Mankey to achieve certain 2HKOes more consistently, such as with Close Combat against Timburr and with Gunk Shot against Spritzee. The remaining EVs are put into HP and Defense to take less damage from priority attacks. Defiant allows Mankey to get a +2 Attack boost when affected by Sticky Web, Defog, and Intimidate.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Mankey in safely via a slow U-turn or Volt Switch or after a KO, as it is very frail and can't afford to take a hit. Once Mankey is in, use it as a revenge killer or cleaner with its Choice Scarf-boosted Speed and high-powered moves. Predict well, and don't get locked into a move the foe is immune to, such as Close Combat on a Ghost-type or Gunk Shot on a Steel-type, as that makes Mankey's team lose all momentum. U-turn is usually a safe option that switches Mankey out after dealing some damage, which is great for scouting and gaining momentum. If you predict that the foe is going to use Defog, you can switch Mankey in to get an Attack boost, making Mankey very dangerous. This is very risky, however, as most Defoggers such as Vullaby are Flying-types and can OHKO Mankey.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Chinchou, Magnemite, and Mienfoo can bring in Mankey safely while creating a VoltTurn core with it. Electric- and Rock-types such as Magnemite and Onix can deal with Flying-types that can threaten Mankey. Entry hazards from the likes of Ferroseed and Onix weaken the opponent's Pokemon upon switching in so that Mankey has an easier time KOing them. Diglett can trap and KO opposing Poison-types, while Mudbray can switch into and KO them. Pursuit trappers such as Alolan Grimer and Pawniard can help remove Abra and Gastly from the field, which can revenge kill Mankey. Knock Off users such as Timburr and Vullaby can help remove Eviolite and Berry Juice from the foe, making them easier to deal with, as well as hit Ghost-types that wall Mankey super effectively.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Growlithe carves out a small niche as a defensive Fire-type due to its respectable bulk, ability Intimidate, and access to Will-O-Wisp letting it check most physical attackers. Unfortunately, Growlithe is largely outclassed by Ponyta and Larvesta due to their more useful movepools and access to Flame Body to passively spread burns. Growlithe also has issues as a check to physical attackers, as Morning Sun's low PP can leave it overwhelmed by very strong attackers, and Growlithe is unable to effectively check Pawniard due to Intimidate activating Defiant. In addition, Flare Blitz and Wild Charge recoil quickly chips away at Growlithe's HP, and its weakness to Stealth Rock necessitates entry hazard removal support for Growlithe to perform its role over the course of a game.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flame Charge or Agility can be used to outspeed most Diglett and defeat it, but they aren't particularly helpful outside of that, and Flame Charge requires either multiple uses or an EV spread that lowers Growlithe's defensive capabilities to outpace Diglett. Thief is an option to let Growlithe recover an item if its Eviolite is removed, but it provides little use otherwise, so Growlithe struggles to fit the move. Close Combat does heavy damage to Rock-types, but it is generally not worth using over Hidden Power Grass due to it reducing Growlithe's Defense and Special Defense after use. Flash Fire can be used instead of Intimidate to absorb Fire-type attacks, but it has no practical use, since Ponyta often runs High Horsepower. Growlithe can attempt to run an offensive set, but it loses most of the defensive utility Growlithe offers and is almost completely outclassed by Ponyta.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Onix and Mudbray are able to take Flare Blitz and Wild Charge with ease and KO Growlithe in return with STAB Earthquake. Growlithe's Fire typing also leaves it vulnerable to being trapped by Diglett. However, Will-O-Wisp cripples most Ground-types, and Hidden Power Grass heavily damages Onix.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types like Onix and Tirtouga can handle Growlithe thanks to their good bulk and resistance to Flare Blitz and threaten it in return with their STAB attacks, along with setting up Stealth Rock to hinder Growlithe further. Much like with Ground-types, however, Will-O-Wisp and Hidden Power Grass can prevent them from switching in freely.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Staryu and Mareanie are able to heavily damage or OHKO Growlithe and don't mind most of Growlithe's moves, though they do have to avoid Wild Charge.</p> <p><strong>Ponyta</strong>: Ponyta takes little damage from all of Growlithe's attacks and can threaten it out in return with High Horsepower.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp lets Growlithe cripple physical attackers like Vullaby and Mienfoo, allowing Growlithe to wall them more effectively and reducing their danger to the rest of Growlithe's team. Morning Sun's healing is necessary for Growlithe to continue checking threats. Flare Blitz is Growlithe's best damage dealing option and prevents Growlithe from being completely unable to threaten special attackers. Wild Charge and Hidden Power Grass are options to help Growlithe's coverage. Wild Charge allows Growlithe to damage Mareanie and Vullaby more than Flare Blitz, while Hidden Power Grass does significant damage to Onix and many other Rock-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given defensive EVs with an Impish nature and Eviolite let Growlithe usually avoid being 2HKOed by attacks like Magnemite's Thunderbolt and standard Mienfoo's High Jump Kick. 36 Speed EVs allow Growlithe to outspeed Timburr and burn Iron Fist sets. Intimidate is Growlithe's best ability by far, allowing it to weaken physical attackers every time it comes in.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Growlithe should attempt to spread burns using Will-O-Wisp as much as possible to support its team and help its ability to switch in. Attempt to keep Stealth Rock off the field as much as possible, as Growlithe is significantly less effective when Stealth Rock is on the field due to its weakness to the entry hazard and only decent bulk. Otherwise, Growlithe should be used liberally to counter physical attackers like Mienfoo and Timburr early- and mid-game and spread burns among the enemy team. Growlithe can also check some special attacking threats like Spritzee and Snivy that can't defeat it, though in general Growlithe should avoid taking special attacks. Above all, it is essential to keep Growlithe's HP high using Morning Sun, as it can easily be weakened to the point that it can no longer check strong physical attackers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that remove entry hazards such as Staryu, Vullaby, and Snivy help Growlithe's longevity immensely by removing Stealth Rock. Growlithe's issues with Water- and Rock-types make Snivy a particularly good partner, since it can defeat them for Growlithe. Mienfoo also makes a good teammate for Growlithe, as it can fight the problematic Onix, while Growlithe can take on Foongus and Spritzee for Mienfoo in return. Thanks to Growlithe's Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp support, Shell Smash users like Shellder and Clamperl and other setup sweepers such as Scraggy can set up more safely, making them good teammates for Growlithe.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With its excellent Speed stat and access to Belly Drum, Poliwag can make a decent sweeper for offensive teams. Its access to Hypnosis can also help it set up and gives it a small niche over other Belly Drum users. However, better Belly Drum users such as Zigzagoon and, to an extent, Magby do a much better job at sweeping due to their access to good priority options. Poliwag is also held back by its relatively small movepool and paper-thin defenses, which keep it from finding reliable setup opportunities. It is incredibly vulnerable to being revenge killed by Choice Scarf and priority users as well. Finally, Poliwag needs a lot of support to even be worth using over other offensive Water-types and Belly Drum users.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Psychium Z with Hypnosis can be used to boost Poliwag's Speed, but Poliwag can't afford to give up Berry Juice to do so. Poliwag can try functioning as a rain sweeper thanks to its Swift Swim ability, but rain is very lackluster, as its main setters and sweepers aren't very good. Protect can shield Poliwag from Fake Out, but Poliwag has trouble finding room for the move, and Protect doesn't do anything else of use anyway. Encore is a potential alternative to Hypnosis that doesn't miss, but it is actually less reliable, as if the foe attacks with a powerful move, Poliwag will most likely be KOed anyway. Refresh can be used to clear Poliwag of status conditions but forces it to give up a moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Chinchou, Lileep, and Ferroseed all are threats to Poliwag due to their bulk and Water resistance. Ferroseed commonly runs Thunder Wave, which can cripple Poliwag. All of them can easily KO Poliwag as well, but Chinchou must be wary of Return, while Lileep and Ferroseed can be easily taken out by Wake-Up Slap. Pumpkaboo-XL and Frillish both fear Thief, but they also resist or are immune to Waterfall, are immune to Return and Wake-Up Slap, and can use Will-O-Wisp on Poliwag to halve its Attack.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Diglett and especially Elekid can both OHKO Poliwag before it even gets the chance to use Belly Drum. Choice Scarf users such as Chinchou and Magnemite also give Poliwag a lot of trouble, as they can OHKO Poliwag while generating momentum for their team.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority users such as Zigzagoon and Croagunk can give Poliwag problems, as Poliwag has no priority moves. Fake Out users, in particular Mienfoo and Meowth, can continually switch in and out and easily defeat Poliwag.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Belly Drum boosts Poliwag's Attack to an extremely high level, allowing it to sweep. Waterfall, when boosted, can hit anything that doesn't resist it for huge damage. Hypnosis allows Poliwag to set up more easily by immobilizing its foe temporarily, but its poor accuracy can be quite unreliable. Return covers all Pokemon that Waterfall does not, such as Mareanie, Foongus, and Shellder. Thief is an alternate coverage option that can be used to remove foes' items after Poliwag has consumed its Berry Juice, as well as hit Pumpkaboo-XL and Frillish, two Pokemon that otherwise wall Poliwag. Wake-Up Slap is another option, as it can hit Ferroseed and Lileep, which would otherwise wall Poliwag.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Poliwag needs Berry Juice to restore its HP after a Belly Drum. Poliwag's EVs and Jolly nature help maximize its power and let it outspeed Doduo and Gastly. An even-numbered HP stat is essential to activate Berry Juice after a Belly Drum, and as such, the remaining 116 EVs are put into HP to achieve this. Water Absorb is Poliwag's most useful ability, as it lets it avoid Aqua Jet, Scald burns, and other potential chip damage from other Water-types.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be sure to conserve Poliwag for late-game, as its primary role is a late-game sweeper. However, sometimes Poliwag can come in on more passive Pokemon such as Spritzee and proceed to sweep. Also, avoid switching Poliwag into attacks, as its paper-thin defenses will usually result in it being KOed. The one exception to this is switching into Water-type attacks, as Water Absorb will absorb them, although this is incredibly dangerous and should only be done when you are sure the foe will use a Water-type move. Instead, try to get Poliwag in with a Volt Switch or U-turn user or after one of your Pokemon has fainted. Before Poliwag sets up, it is a good idea to use Hypnosis to cripple the foe by putting them to sleep. Be sure to eliminate all revenge killers, primarily faster Pokemon, priority users, and Abra, as they can stop Poliwag's sweep quite quickly. Also, be sure to eliminate Ferroseed and Lileep if Poliwag is not running Wake-Up Slap and Frillish and Pumpkaboo-XL if Poliwag is not running Thief.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slow U-turn or Volt Switch users such as Chinchou, Vullaby, and Mienfoo can easily help Poliwag get in without it suffering any damage. Sticky Web support from the likes of Surskit can help Poliwag outspeed Choice Scarf users such as Chinchou, Mienfoo, and certain faster Pokemon, mainly Elekid and Diglett. Other entry hazards from Dwebble, Pawniard, or Onix can help break Sturdy and Focus Sashes for Poliwag to more easily sweep. Memento support from Cottonee or Diglett can be helpful to cripple foes to a point where they essentially need to switch out while also safely getting Poliwag in. Pancham can also cripple foes and function as a slow pivot with Parting Shot and has the benefit of being able to beat Ferroseed for Poliwag. Furthermore, checks to bulky Grass- and Water-types such as Foongus and Snivy can help ease Poliwag's job of cleaning up. Dark-types, particularly Pursuit trappers such as Alolan Grimer and Pawniard, can eliminate Ghost-types if Poliwag is not running Thief.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Abra has exceptionally high Speed and Special Attack stats as well as a very useful ability in Magic Guard, which gives it the potential to function as either the tier's best revenge killer with a Focus Sash or a menacing wallbreaker with Life Orb. However, for as good as Abra's offensive capabilities are, it has less bulk than wet tissue paper, not to mention it is also vulnerable to all forms of trapping in the tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shadow Ball lets Abra hit opposing Abra in particular, although they are 2HKOed by Abra's other attacks. Psychium Z can also be used to give Abra the ability to OHKO a variety of Pokemon, like bulky Staryu, though it lacks the utility of Focus Sash and the consistent power of Life Orb. Encore can be used to get around Pawniard's Sucker Punch, but Focus Sash Abra rarely has the free moveslot to use this. Additionally, Psych Up can be used to copy the stat boosts of an Omanyte or Scraggy in an attempt to countersweep, though much like with Encore, Focus Sash Abra sets do not typically have enough space to run this move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Anything that Abra can't outspeed is bad news. Focus Sash Abra wants to preserve its item, and Life Orb Abra doesn't have the bulk to take anything other than weak special attacks, so Pokemon that have 20 Speed or more can usually force Abra out.</p> <p><strong>Trappers</strong>: Diglett can come in on a revenge kill and break Abra's Focus Sash or even remove it from play entirely with Beat Up.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Trappers</strong>: Alolan Grimer can safely come in on any of Abra's moves bar Hidden Power Ground from Life Orb variants and proceed to threaten it with either Pursuit or Shadow Sneak, but it must be wary of Counter from the Focus Sash set. Choice Scarf Pawniard can come in on a revenge kill or predicted Psychic or Dazzling Gleam and use Pursuit to OHKO Life Orb variants or remove the Focus Sash set's item. Munchlax can switch in on Abra due to its naturally high Special Defense and Pursuit trap it as well.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that avoid the 2HKO from Psychic and have recovery can threaten Abra. For example, Slowpoke resists Abra's Psychic and has Regenerator, Slack Off, and Thunder Wave, so it threatens most Abra sets. Munchlax does not take much from Abra's attacks, so it can switch in and immediately threaten Abra. Spritzee is only 3HKOed by Focus Sash Abra's Psychic, so it can work as a check. However, it is 2HKOed by Life Orb sets.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Priority</strong>: Focus Sash Abra cannot stay in on Pokemon with priority, because otherwise they threaten to remove its item. This includes Pokemon such as Pawniard, Croagunk, Timburr, Doduo, and Corphish. However, Life Orb Abra doesn't mind Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave from Timburr and Croagunk, respectively.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Focus Sash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic is a strong STAB attack that lets Abra hit the large number of Fighting- and Poison-types in the tier. Dazzling Gleam hits Dark-types for super effective damage, letting Abra revenge kill Vullaby and Scraggy. Counter can be used to bait in physical attackers, primarily Pursuit trappers, and retaliate if Abra has retained its Focus Sash. Alternatively, Hidden Power Fighting or Fire gives Abra a way to hit annoying Steel-types like Magnemite, Pawniard and Ferroseed. It is worth noting that Counter cannot be used with Hidden Power Fighting. Abra's final slot is a decision between Protect, Energy Ball, and Psychic Terrain. Protect allows Abra to scout against Choice Scarf users and get around Fake Out. Energy Ball lets Abra 2HKO Slowpoke and Mudbray, OHKO Shellder, and more reliably revenge kill bulky Shell Smashers. Psychic Terrain lets Abra get around priority and potentially pull off a late game sweep. Knock Off can be used in the final slot to provide support to Abra itself by removing the Eviolites of special walls on predicted switches.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Abra's EV spread is very straightforward. 196 Speed EVs with a Timid nature let Abra hit 19 Speed, which lets it outspeed the unboosted tier except for Diglett, Elekid, and Voltorb, and 236 Special Attack EVs let Abra hit as hard as possible. The remaining EVs raise Abra's Special Defense by one point, although it remains quite frail. If Abra is running Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Fighting, it should run an alternative EV spread of 240 SpA / 200 Spe to account for lower IVs. The combination of Focus Sash and Magic Guard means Abra can act as a one-time stop to set-up sweepers lacking multi-hit moves, because Magic Guard ignores entry hazard damage that would otherwise break Abra's Focus Sash.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Abra is an amazing revenge killer, as it possesses good coverage, blazing Speed, and a sky-high Special Attack, but it has horrendous defenses. Thus, Abra should not be switched directly into play, but rather through U-turn or Volt Switch or after a KO. Furthermore, Abra is very susceptible to trappers such as Diglett and Alolan Grimer, the latter of which can switch in on it. For this reason, if there are trappers on the opposing team paired with a sweeper, it's best to not put Abra into play until the opposing sweeper has set up. Versus teams that lack trapping, Abra does not need to be played conservatively and can freely pressure the opposing team. Lastly, Abra should not be sent out versus Pokemon with priority unless necessary, because otherwise it will lose its Focus Sash.</p> <p>In most situations, Abra will be using Psychic or a super effective coverage move, but Knock Off can be used on predicted switches to walls like Munchlax and Bronzor. Keep in mind that Knock Off is a very high-risk move, though, and if Abra uses Knock Off in any other situations, it will likely be losing its Focus Sash. Note that while Psychic does more damage to Fighting-types, Dazzling Gleam is a good move to use if the Fighting-type Abra is facing is at medium-to-low HP and you're unsure whether or not the opponent will send in a Dark-type.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because Abra cannot switch into play, Pokemon like Magnemite, Chinchou, and Mienfoo pair nicely with it. These Pokemon provide VoltTurn support for Abra so it can get into play without wasting its Focus Sash. Checks to priority users such as Pawniard, Corphish, and Timburr are appreciated for the same reason. Fighting-types like Mienfoo and Timburr cover Pawniard, Foongus and Spritzee cover Timburr, and Foongus and Chinchou cover Corphish for Abra. To mitigate Abra's tendency to be Pursuit trapped by Alolan Grimer, Diglett can also be run as a partner to countertrap it.</p>"

For the third slot, Hidden Power Ground can be used to let Abra avoid being trapped by Alolan Grimer if it is used on the switch or from behind a Substitute; Hidden Power Fighting can be used to let Abra OHKO Pawniard; and Energy Ball can be used to let Abra 2HKO Slowpoke, OHKO Chinchou and Drilbur, and do more damage to Mudbray. Lastly, Substitute is good for exploiting the many switches Abra forces and absorbing random statuses such as Foongus's Spore. Psychic Terrain is an alternative to get around priority and further boost Abra's power, but can be difficult to set up due to Abra's frailty.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread on this set is rather self-explanatory. 200 Speed EVs with a Timid nature let Abra reach 19 Speed, which is enough to outspeed the majority of the unboosted metagame, and 240 Special Attack EVs let Abra hit as hard as possible. Life Orb gives Abra wallbreaking potential, turning certain 3HKOs into 2HKOs and certain 2HKOs into OHKOs. For example, Life Orb Abra OHKOes Foongus, slow Mienfoo, Timburr, and bulky Berry Juice Archen from full, as well as 2HKOing Spritzee, specially defensive Mudbray, and Pumpkaboo.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Life Orb Abra is a wallbreaker. In addition to protecting it from entry hazards, Magic Guard also lets Abra not take damage from Life Orb recoil. This is partly why Life Orb Abra is so threatening; it can feign holding Focus Sash, allowing it to nab some surprise OHKOs and 2HKOs. As a wallbreaker, Life Orb Abra is often played early on in the match and very aggressively. Abra will be using Psychic or whatever coverage move is super effective, though it can also use Substitute on predicted switches so that it does not need to predict perfectly. Substitute can also be used to avoid Sucker Punches from Pawniard.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>VoltTurn support is helpful for Life Orb Abra, since even without Focus Sash, Abra doesn't particularly like switching into attacks. Magnemite, Chinchou, and Mienfoo work nicely for this. Seeing as Life Orb Abra is a wallbreaker, this set pairs nicely with Pokemon that enjoy having bulky walls lured and KOed, such as Shell Smash Shellder and Nasty Plot Vullaby. Also, on sets that have Hidden Power Fighting over Hidden Power Ground, Diglett can be used to countertrap Alolan Grimer.</p>"

  "Machop": {
    "overview": "<p>Machop is a decent Choice Scarf user with great utility moves in Knock Off and a 100% accurate Dynamic Punch thanks to No Guard. Dynamic Punch is very spammable due to the guaranteed confusion, as even Pokemon that resist it don't want to switch in and be confused. It's complemented further by great coverage moves, always giving Machop the option to hit what Dynamic Punch doesn't: Knock Off hits Ghost-types, Poison Jab hits Fairy-types, and Rock Slide hits Flying-types. However, Machop is very frail due to its lack of Eviolite and is very reliant on its Choice Scarf, becoming quite slow for its role without the Choice Scarf and losing almost all of its effectiveness. Machop's low bulk allows it to be easily revenge killed and its low base Speed causes it to be outsped by most other Choice Scarf users. Also, some checks to Machop such as Spritzee and Slowpoke don't mind the confusion very much, and the chance to hit oneself in confusion is only one in three. Machop faces competition from other Fighting-types: as a Choice Scarf user, Mienfoo gives it competition because of its better Speed, Regenerator ability, and access to U-turn, and as a bulky attacker, Timburr gives it competition because of its better bulk and access to Mach Punch.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Machop has access to other coverage moves like Ice Punch, Thunder Punch, Fire Punch, and Earthquake. However, these moves are not as useful as the coverage moves listed in the set. Bullet Punch can be run to hit Fairy-types, but Poison Jab is a better option because of its higher Base Power. Berry Juice can be used over a Choice Scarf on a Sticky Web team, allowing Machop to have more longevity. Guts can be run over No Guard, but this means Machop has to run a different Fighting-type move like Close Combat, the use of which makes Machop frailer than it already is. A Guts set is also outclassed by Timburr.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Machop is in the slowest tier of Choice Scarf users, and its frailty is exposed when outsped by other Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Magnemite and Doduo.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Machop doesn't have much of a way to break through physical tanks such as Foongus, Spritzee, Slowpoke, and Snubbull, especially since most physical tanks are Psychic- or Fairy-types. However, it can remove their items with Knock Off if the switch in is predicted, which really hinders their usefulness for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: If Machop is locked into Dynamic Punch, Ghost-types like Gastly and Pumpkaboo-XL have a free switch in and force Machop out. However, if Machop hasn't locked into a move yet, they need to be cautious of switching into Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Status Moves</strong>: Machop is not the most powerful for an offensive Pokemon, and a burn brings its Attack down to pretty poor levels. Paralysis prevents Machop from outspeeding the Pokemon that it needs to and makes it fairly easy to KO due to its frailty.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dynamic Punch will never miss thanks to No Guard ensuring all moves hit. That leaves Machop with a 100-Base Power STAB move that also has the utility of always confusing. Knock Off provides good coverage, hitting the Ghost-types that are immune to Dynamic Punch and the Psychic-types that resist it. It also provides utility against other Pokemon by removing the foe's item. Poison Jab is a good coverage move against the Fairy-types that resist Dynamic Punch, potentially OHKOing Cottonee. Rock Slide also provides good coverage, hitting Larvesta super effectively and not risking a burn from Flame Body. It also has the added utility of potentially making the foe flinch. Close Combat can hit Vullaby, Rufflet, and Doduo slightly harder than Rock Slide and can be useful in the rare situation in which Dynamic Punch ran out of PP. However, it decreases Machop's already poor bulk.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Jolly is the preferred nature because combined with 236 Speed EVs and the Choice Scarf boost allows Machop to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. 196 EVs go into Attack to maximize the stat, allowing Machop to dish out the most damage possible. This guarantees Machop a 2HKO with Rock Slide on non-defensive Vullaby after Stealth Rock damage. The remaining EVs go into both HP and Defense to increase both stats by one point, giving it a bit more bulk and longevity. No Guard is the preferred ability because it gives Dynamic Punch and Rock Slide perfect accuracy.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Machop is a decent Choice Scarf user, dealing out heavy damage and spreading confusion with Dynamic Punch, and removing items with Knock Off. Dynamic Punch only has 8 PP, but it is a very spammable move and should be used often. It is very strong, and nothing wants to switch into a guaranteed confusion. Knock Off is also fairly spammable, since it provides great utility and is a good option to use on a predicted switch-in that resists Dynamic Punch and isn't hit super effectively by its coverage moves. Psychic-, Fairy-, and Flying-types give Machop problems, but if their switch into battle is predicted and a super effective move is used, Machop can possibly stay in and 2HKO next turn. However, Machop is not capable of handling most bulky Pokemon of these types if they come in on Machop and have not taken previous damage. For example, Spritzee is 3HKOed by Poison Jab and Slowpoke is 3HKOed by Knock Off. As with any Choice Scarf user, you must predict carefully so as not to be locked into an undesirable attack and give your opponent free turns. Machop is not very bulky and has no Eviolite, so it should only be brought in after a teammate has fainted or by a slow pivot so that it doesn't take an attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can bring Machop into battle without being hit are good teammates, so slow U-turn and Volt Switch users like Mienfoo, Magnemite, and Chinchou make good partners. Rock-, Steel-, and Electric-types like Pawniard, Kabuto, and Archen make good teammates for Machop because they can check and even take out the Flying-types like Vullaby and Rufflet that could potentially outspeed Machop. Fairy-types are good counters to Machop, so Pokemon that can beat them are good partners. In addition to Steel-types, Poison-types like Foongus and Croagunk are useful in countering them. Dark-type Pokemon such as Alolan Grimer, Pawniard, and Vullaby can Knock Off foes' items, making it easier for Machop to break through the opponent's team. In addition, Alolan Grimer and Pawniard can Pursuit trap Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Abra and Gastly, clearing the way for Machop to sweep. Entry hazard setters such as Ferroseed and Pawniard allow Machop to reach certain KOs, in particular a 2HKO on offensive Vullaby with Rock Slide.</p>"

However, Bellsprout's bulk is far from great, and it is almost useless outside of sun teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sucker Punch can be used to hit Abra outside of sun and KO weakened foes, but Sludge Bomb and Sleep Powder usually offer more utility. Sunny Day gives Bellsprout a way to set up its own sun at the cost of Sleep Powder. Giga Drain sacrifices power to give Bellsprout longevity as well as make it more useful outside of sun. Knock Off allows Bellsprout to remove Eviolites and makes breaking walls later on easier.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Weather Setters</strong>: Weather-setting Pokemon can replace the sun with a weather that benefits them and makes Bellsprout's Chlorophyll inactive. Amaura locks Bellsprout into Solar Beam and OHKOes it, making it the best weather check to Bellsprout. Hippopotas is also a hard check, as it can switch in on any of Bellsprout's moves. Snover can set up hail to nullify sun, but it fears Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Focus Sash Abra</strong>: Focus Sash Abra can endure Bellsprout's first hit and OHKO it with Psychic, but loses to Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types resist all of Bellsprout's moves except for Sludge Bomb, which moderately bulky Pokemon can take a hit from. Bellsprout's best hope is to put them to sleep or switch out. Poisonium Z sets can OHKO the vast majority of Fire-types.</p> <p><strong>Chespin</strong>: Chespin's typing and ability Bulletproof make it immune to Sleep Powder, Sludge Bomb, and Weather Ball, forcing Bellsprout to use Solar Beam or switch. However, Poisonium Z sets can OHKO Chespin.</p> <p><strong>Fast Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf Doduo and, to a lesser extent, Gastly outspeed and check Bellsprout. Doduo can OHKO Bellsprout and Gastly can 2HKO it with Sludge Bomb,but Bellsprout can beat Gastly if it lands Sleep Powder. Timid Bellsprout can outspeed both.</p> <p><strong>Generally Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Munchlax walls Bellsprout and strikes back with Fire Punch or Body Slam. Vullaby takes a hit, and Overcoat Vullaby is immune to Sleep Powder and OHKOes Bellsprout with Brave Bird, but Bellsprout can beat Vullaby with Z-Sludge Bomb.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Solar Beam is Bellsprout's main STAB move, dishing out devastating neutral hits due to its 120 Base Power. Sludge Bomb hits Spritzee and Snover on the switch and can KO checks such as Ponyta and Vullaby when used with Poisonium Z. Weather Ball allows Bellsprout to hit the Steel-types that wall it otherwise, and Sleep Powder lets Bellsprout beat a lot of its checks. Growth can be used over Sleep Powder to make Bellsprout extremely powerful.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>196 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature maximize Bellsprout's offensive power. 196 Speed EVs allow Bellsprout to outspeed 17 Speed Choice Scarf users, but a Timid nature can be used to outspeed 18 Speed Choice Scarf users such as Gastly and Doduo that otherwise check Bellsprout, as well as common Shell Smash users such as Omanyte and Shellder. For item choices, Poisonium Z gives Bellsprout a one-use move that can eliminate a check such as Ponyta or Vullaby, Eviolite makes Bellsprout bulky enough to switch in on a resisted attack, and Life Orb can be used to make Bellsprout stronger at the cost of longevity and bulk. Chlorophyll is a must, doubling Bellsprout's Speed in the sun. All remaining EVs are placed into bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bellsprout is very frail and should be pivoted in when using a Life Orb or Poisonium Z set. Eviolite makes Bellsprout bulky enough to switch in on a resisted attack. Sleep Powder should be used on foes that Bellsprout cannot usually beat. Growth should be used on predicted switches and sleeping foes. Solar Beam should be used with caution against opposing weather teams to avoid locking Bellsprout into a two-turn move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Z-Sunny Day Ponyta can set up sun and reliably beat Focus Sash Abra after its Speed boost, and it can also beat Steel-types. Focus Sash Diglett can beat Focus Sash Abra, Ponyta, and Steel-types and if it runs Reversal, Munchlax. Mareanie, Chinchou, and Mudbray handle Fire-types, something that sun teams need to be able to do, making them great offensive partners as well. Chinchou's Electric-type moves also allow it to handle Vullaby for non-Poisonium Z Bellsprout. Knock Off users such as Pawniard, Mienfoo, and Timburr also make for good teammates thanks to their ability to knock off Eviolites and make it easier for Bellsprout to break walls. Mienfoo and Timburr also beat Munchlax with Drain Punch.</p>"

It also has a good defensive typing, resisting common types like Fighting and Fairy. It doesn't have a slacking offensive movepool, either, with access to Sludge Bomb, Knock Off, and Scald. However, its actual attacking stats are lackluster, as is its physical bulk. Its longevity isn't helped by the fact that it doesn't have any reliable recovery outside Berry Juice, and it faces competition from other Water- / Poison-types like Skrelp and Mareanie. Nevertheless, Tentacool sets itself apart from these Pokemon by having access to Rapid Spin and a better Speed stat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam can be used as a coverage move on the offensive set, but it only hits Foongus, and Sludge Bomb does the job well enough anyway. Similarly, Dazzling Gleam can be used to hit Fighting-types, but Scraggy is the only one it hits hard enough to be worth using over Sludge Bomb. Sludge Wave can be used if the extra 5 Base Power is desired or if you really want to hit Chespin, but often the increased poison chance is more helpful. Giga Drain can be used to hit Water-types, but it's often not worth the coverage slot when Sludge Bomb hits them just fine. Hidden Power Psychic can hit Croagunk, but it hits nothing else. Thief is a decent option as well on the defensive set, but Knock Off is more reliable in removing a foe's item. Finally, Haze can be used to deal with setup sweepers, but Tentacool has a hard time finding room in its moveset for it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ferroseed and Croagunk</strong>: Ferroseed can wall all of Tentacool's moves bar Hidden Power Fire, use Knock Off to remove Tentacool's only recovery option, and halve Tentacool's Speed with Thunder Wave. It can also use Tentacool as setup bait or even just weaken it with Bullet Seed. Croagunk also walls Tentacool completely and can utilize Knock Off or set up a Nasty Plot with no problems.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Chinchou and Magnemite can tank any of Tentacool's moves at least once and retaliate with a super effective Electric-type attack.</p> <p><strong>Fast Ground-types</strong>: Fast Ground-types such as Drilbur and Diglett can easily KO Tentacool with their STAB moves. Diglett, in particular, can trap Tentacool so it can't switch and finish it off with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Mareanie, Skrelp, and defensive Staryu can fully wall Tentacool and force it out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin allows Tentacool to clear entry hazards, increasing the longevity of itself and its teammates. Knock Off removes Eviolites from the opposing team, helping Tentacool's team further. Toxic Spikes can alternatively be used to poison foes, putting pressure on the opponent and punishing switches. Scald lets Tentacool attack Fire-, Ground-, and Rock-types super effectively and carries a nifty burn chance to cripple physical attackers. Sludge Bomb is Tentacool's secondary STAB move, which can be used to hit Grass- and Fairy-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full defensive investment and a Calm nature maximize Tentacool's bulk, letting it take moves like Drain Punch and Leaf Storm. Berry Juice gives Tentacool some form of recovery, prolonging its longevity, while Eviolite lets it come in on Knock Off users more easily. Liquid Ooze allows it to switch in and punish draining-move users like Timburr, Pumpkaboo-XL, and Foongus, harming them when they use Drain Punch or Giga Drain.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tentacool can be switched into neutral special attacks relatively easily, letting it use Rapid Spin freely. It can also switch into draining moves like Drain Punch. However, while it has the bulk to take a few hits, it still gets worn down quite easily, so try to preserve Tentacool and its Berry Juice. Knock Off should be used if you predict a spinblocker to switch in, as these are all Ghost-types.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that need Stealth Rock removed, such as Ponyta and Vullaby, can be used, as they appreciate Tentacool's utility. Physical walls like Mudbray and Ferroseed can tank physical hits that would otherwise heavily damage Tentacool. Wish support from Spritzee can improve Tentacool's longevity. Grass-types like Snivy and Pumpkaboo-S can deal with Ground-types that give Tentacool trouble, while Alolan Grimer can take on Psychic-types. Alolan Grimer is especially helpful, since it can Pursuit trap the Ghost-types that block Rapid Spin. Pawniard can perform this job as well. Ferroseed forms a strong defensive core with Tentacool: the two can layer Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes, tank physical and special hits, and handle the other's checks.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is Tentacool's strongest STAB move, with even neutral hits dealing a decent amount of damage. Sludge Bomb is a secondary STAB attack that can hit Grass-types and occasionally poison the foe. Knock Off can be used to weaken opposing Pokemon. Hidden Power Fire hits Ferroseed, which completely walls Tentacool otherwise. However, Rapid Spin is also an option, as it can provide utility to Tentacool's team and be used on a switch. Acid Spray is also an option to force a switch, as at -2 Special Defense, almost any Pokemon is at mercy to Tentacool's STAB attacks, but usually simply using one of Tentacool's main STAB moves is better.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>196 Special Attack EVs let Tentacool's STAB moves hit as hard as they need to, while the defensive investment allows Tentacool to take a few more hits. Its Speed is maximized, hitting a great Speed tier of 17 for an offensive Pokemon. A Life Orb allows Tentacool to deal as much damage as possible and bolster its poor, unboosted Special Attack stat. If you want Tentacool to survive longer and have more opportunities to switch in, you can run Eviolite, but its offensive presence is very weak without a Life Orb. Clear Body allows Tentacool to be undeterred by opposing Sticky Web teams. 19 HP IVs let Tentacool take only 1 HP of damage from Life Orb recoil every turn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tentacool can act as a decent lure, bluffing a utility set to catch an opposing Pokemon with a powerful attack on the switch. However, its poor physical bulk leaves it vulnerable to the many physical attackers the metagame has to offer, so don't switch it directly in. Be careful getting KOs when a Diglett is on the other team, as Tentacool is completely trapped by it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit trappers, like Pawniard and Alolan Grimer, can take out Psychic-types like Abra. Snivy and Pumpkaboo-S can deal with Ground-types. Entry hazard setters like Onix and Ferroseed can get chip damage on the opposing team via Stealth Rock or Spikes, allowing Tentacool to clean up more easily. Pokemon that can deal with Croagunk and Ferroseed, two of Tentacool's biggest checks, are very helpful for obvious reasons. Mudbray and Diglett can handle Croagunk, while Ponyta and Timburr can take on Ferroseed. Knock Off support from Pawniard or Mienfoo is also very helpful, letting Tentacool do even more damage to Pokemon without their Eviolite.</p>"

  "Geodude": {
    "overview": "<p>Geodude is a decent Stealth Rock user, as its Sturdy ability in conjunction with a Berry Juice usually guarantees that it will set up Stealth Rock. However, it is largely outclassed by Onix in this role, as its superior Speed stat, unpredictability in ability options, and access to more utility moves like Taunt and Roar make it function much better as an entry hazard lead. Geodude does boast a far greater Attack stat and a nice movepool, though, containing Sucker Punch as a priority option, a very powerful Explosion, Counter to smack physical attacking foes back, and great STAB moves to take advantage of Geodude's amazing offensive typing, all of which give it a good offensive presence and make it function as a better suicide lead for offense teams. Like Onix, Geodude suffers with a bad Special Defense stat and mediocre HP stat, which coupled by its terrible defensive typing that gives it a 4x weakness to Water and Grass as well as other weaknesses to common types like Fighting and Ground, makes it mediocre defensively, though Sturdy does mitigate this hindrance.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rock Polish doubles Geodude's Speed, allowing it to function as a sweeper, but a set with it is generally outclassed by other Pokemon such as Shell Smash users. Fire Punch is able to OHKO Ferroseed, which Geodude otherwise struggles against, but the coverage doesn't help in many other cases. Stone Edge and Rock Slide are other Rock-type moves that deal more consistent damage, with the latter being able to flinch the foe, but Rock Blast usually deals more damage than both of those moves in LC and is able to break Sturdy and Focus Sash from Pokemon like Dwebble and Abra, as well as better take advantage of Weak Armor Pokemon like Vullaby. Curse provides bulk and power, bolstering Geodude's Attack and Defense while lowering its already abysmal Speed, but with a low Special Defense stat it is hard to make good use of.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Pumpkaboo, Cottonee, and Foongus are able to OHKO Geodude with Giga Drain if its Sturdy is broken and heal any lost HP. Snivy can use Geodude to gain Special Attack boosts by using Leaf Storm against it. Ferroseed is especially bothersome, as it is bulky enough to take a neutral Earthquake, can set up entry hazards on Geodude, and can use Bullet Seed to break Sturdy and OHKO Geodude.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Almost all Water-types are able to OHKO Geodude with their STAB moves if Sturdy is broken. Corphish and Carvanha have priority in Aqua Jet to quickly get rid of Geodude. Staryu and Kabuto are able to remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin while KOing Geodude with their Water-type moves, though Kabuto must be careful of Earthquake. Shellder is able to set up on Geodude, being able to tank its moves with its high Defense stat and OHKO with Icicle Spear.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Many Fighting-types such as Timburr and Scraggy are able to remove Geodude's Berry Juice with Knock Off, making it lose out on recovery, and then hit Geodude super effectively with Drain Punch, restoring HP in the process. Mienfoo is especially problematic, as it is one of the most common leads, being able to do all of the above as well as deal chip damage with U-turn to then pivot into a check. Timburr and Croagunk can quickly dispose of Geodude with their selection of priority moves, though Croagunk must be careful of Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Mudbray and Hippopotas are very bulky, allowing them to sponge Geodude's attacks, with Mudbray being able to increase its Defense stat with Stamina upon being damaged and retaliate back with Earthquake. Diglett is able to trap Geodude and dispose of it with a powerful Earthquake, though it is unable to switch in, and Geodude's Sturdy must be broken in order to get rid of it. Drilbur is one of the best counters to Geodude, as it can clear Geodude's Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin while setting up its own and can OHKO Geodude with Earthquake thanks to its Mold Breaker ability ignoring Sturdy.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Opposing entry hazards break Sturdy, which makes Geodude significantly less useful, though it can tank physical hits due to its good Defense stat. Burns are especially annoying, as they halve Geodude's Attack stat on top of dealing residual damage, severely reducing its effectiveness.</p>",

      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is an incredible move that pressures the opposing team, dealing chip damage every time a foe switches in. Rock Blast is a STAB move that benefits from LC's multi-hit damage rolls and is used to break Sturdy, Substitute, and Focus Sash from Pokemon such as Dwebble and Surskit, which are common leads, along with hitting Flying- and Fire-types such as Doduo and Larvesta. Earthquake is a secondary STAB move that provides amazing neutral coverage with Rock Blast, hitting Steel-types like Pawniard and Magnemite super effectively, which resist Rock Blast. It also hits other Rock-, Electric-, and Poison-types such as Onix, Croagunk, and Elekid while hitting Fire-types more consistently. Sucker Punch bypasses Geodude's poor Speed stat to hit faster Pokemon such as Abra and Gastly, as well as weakened foes. Explosion acts as a suicide nuke after Geodude has done its role, and with its high Attack stat, Geodude usually either wipes out a Pokemon from the battle or weakens it enough to be revenge killed by a teammate while providing momentum. Counter returns twice the damage Geodude takes to physically attacking foes such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Corphish after they attack Geodude and synergizes well with Sturdy and Berry Juice.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sturdy allows Geodude to live most attacks at full HP, and 36 HP EVs bring Geodude to 21 HP, guaranteeing it will be at full health after consuming Berry Juice. Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature make Geodude hit as hard as possible. The Speed EVs given are used to outspeed Spritzee and most variants of Alolan Grimer, while the remaining EVs are put into Geodude's defenses to provide more bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Geodude best functions as a lead and should use Stealth Rock as early as possible to pressure the opposing team with entry hazards up. Be careful of Ferroseed and Mienfoo when leading with Geodude, as the former outright beats it with Bullet Seed, while the latter can remove Geodude's Berry Juice and proceed to KO it with Fighting-type moves or simply Taunt it, preventing it from setting Stealth Rock. Geodude can also be saved for late-game once spinners and Defoggers have been cleared, allowing it to keep Stealth Rock up; it should switch in if it gets a free switch, such as via VoltTurn, to avoid damage and keep Sturdy intact, or on attacks it resists from the likes of Doduo and Elekid, though it should be careful of coverage these Pokemon carry. Be cautious of Drilbur, as it is able to remove Geodude's Stealth Rock and set up its own while also being able to OHKO it, as Mold Breaker ignores Sturdy. Faster Pokemon such as Abra, Gastly, and weakened foes are prime targets for Sucker Punch, but be sure that they'll opt to attack instead of using a status move like Substitute, as mispredicting can be detrimental to Geodude. Explosion should only be used once Geodude has fulfilled its role of having Stealth Rock up, usually with spinners gone as well, and can be used to avoid being setup bait and to gain momentum for Geodude's team. However, watch out for Ghost-types, as they are immune to Explosion and will cause Geodude to faint without damaging them. Counter should be used against physical attackers Geodude cannot KO with its other moves, like Mienfoo and Timburr at full HP, and when it is at full health to ensure that Sturdy activates.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sweepers and cleaners such as Shellder, Carvanha, and Mienfoo appreciate the Stealth Rock support that Geodude provides, as it makes it easier for them to secure KOs. Grass-types like Foongus and Pumpkaboo are resistant to the Water- and Grass-type moves that Geodude is immensely weak to. Additionally, Pumpkaboo's Ghost typing allows it to spinblock, which prevents Geodude's Stealth Rock from being cleared, while being resistant to Ground making it a great Drilbur counter, with an added bonus of having a Fighting immunity. Other Ghost-types like Gastly and Frillish also help Geodude with their ability to spinblock. Pawniard makes for a good teammate, as its ability Defiant discourages the foe from using Defog against it, and it can remove Ghost-types for Geodude to safely use Explosion. Flying-types like Doduo, Vullaby, and Rufflet are able to check Grass- and Fighting-types that Geodude is weak to. Spinners such as Staryu and Kabuto are able to remove any entry hazard, which helps Geodude preserve its Sturdy, making it much more efficient in the battle by making it easier for it to set up Stealth Rock or check Flying- and Electric-types. Electric-types such as Chinchou and Magnemite are able to pressure Water-types that Geodude is extremely weak to, making it easier for Geodude to perform its role later.</p>"

  "Geodude-Alola": {
    "overview": "<p>Alolan Geodude carves out a niche in LC through its access to Magnet Pull alongside decent stats and useful coverage. A fairly high Attack stat and very good Defense let Alolan Geodude switch in on most of the Steel-types in LC, trap them, and dispatch them with a super effective move. Access to Stealth Rock and the ability to act as an effective Flying-type check due to its typing and Defense stat let Alolan Geodude support its team beyond just trapping Steel-types. However, Alolan Geodude's very low Speed and Special Defense alongside weaknesses to rather common Fighting- and Ground-type moves leave it vulnerable to a massive amount of the LC metagame. In addition, the role of a Magnet Pull trapper is generally done better by Magnemite since it is capable of contributing more against teams lacking Steel-types, while Alolan Geodude is also outclassed in the role of Stealth Rock setter and Flying-type check by Onix and Tirtouga. Lastly, while Alolan Geodude is an effective Steel-type trapper, it can easily give away momentum to opposing teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Geodude can attempt to run an offensive Stealth Rock set with Galvanize to defeat common entry hazard removers like Vullaby and Staryu, but its low Speed and common weaknesses make other Stealth Rock users better choices. A Rock Polish set can work as a sweeper, as Alolan Geodude can reach a respectable 11 Speed, enough to outspeed the unboosted metagame at +2, but it's hard to set up and gets beaten by Choice Scarf users. Sturdy + Berry Juice is an option, but Alolan Geodude is outclassed in this role by other Pokemon such as Onix. If you opt for this, Counter is an option to KO physical sweepers such as Mienfoo and Drilbur. Magnet Rise can be used to migate Alolan Geodude's weakness to Ground-types, but Alolan Geodude tends to lose to Ground-types even with Magnet Rise. Hidden Power Grass is Alolan Geodude's only option against Onix, but it requires some prior damage to OHKO it, and it doesn't help with much else.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Due to Alolan Geodude's 4x weakness to Ground, Ground-type Pokemon such as Diglett and Onix are immune to its Electric-type attacks and can usually OHKO it with Earthquake. Diglett in particular can easily eliminate Alolan Geodude while preventing it from switching out thanks to Arena Trap.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Foongus and Snivy resist all of Alolan Geodude's attacks and can hit it hard with their super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types like Mienfoo and Timburr can easily take care of Alolan Geodude thanks to their super effective STAB moves. However, Fighting-types are still hit hard by Galvanize-boosted attacks.</p> <p><strong>Chinchou</strong>: Chinchou's ability Volt Absorb makes it immune to Alolan Geodude's Electric-type attacks, and it can OHKO Alolan Geodude with Hydro Pump. However, it has to be wary of Earthquake.</p>",

      "Magnet Pull": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Blast is Alolan Geodude's main STAB move, hitting Flying-types for super effective damage and helping it check threats such as Vullaby and Doduo. Fire Punch OHKOes Ferroseed and hit other Grass-types. Superpower helps Alolan Geodude by OHKOing Pawniard and Magnemite, as well as hitting Rock-types super effectively. Stealth Rock is useful thanks to Alolan Geodude's bulk to set up against trapped Pokemon like Ferroseed and Pawniard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Magnet Pull is required for this set to work, trapping Ferroseed and Pawniard. 36 EVs in HP and 116 EVs in Defense along with Eviolite allow Alolan Geodude to switch into Pawniard and avoid being 2HKOed by Knock Off followed by Iron Head. 116 EVs in Attack secure the OHKO on both Ferroseed and Pawniard with the adequate coverage. 36 EVs in Speed let Alolan Geodude outspeed Ferroseed in order to effectively trap it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Alolan Geodude should be sent into the field if Ferroseed or Pawniard are going to switch in, which can be done by providing momentum via Volt Switch and U-turn or on double switches. If a teammate has been weakened by Pawniard, Alolan Geodude can be sent in to trap and revenge kill it. Alolan Geodude can only set Stealth Rock up against Pawniard if it comes in unscathed and against Ferroseed if it doesn't take a Knock Off. It is important for Alolan Geodude to stay healthy throughout the match if it has to trap anything. Moreover, it must be careful with Diglett on opposing teams and should not come into pivoting moves such as U-turn to avoid getting trapped. In case there are no trappers, Alolan Geodude's typing can be used to check Flying-types such as Doduo, but it is important to distinguish when to use it and when to keep it healthy to trap important threats.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that provide momentum such as Mienfoo and Vullaby make decent partners by helping Alolan Geodude pivot in safely. Grass-types such as Foongus and Snivy can help mitigate the weakness against Diglett, as well as check Ground- and Water-types. Moreover, Snivy benefits from Alolan Geodude removing both Pawniard and Ferroseed to help it act as a wallbreaker in a more effective way. Similarly, wallbreakers such as Abra and Gastly enjoy getting these threats removed to break through many common builds. Shellder is a setup sweeper that appreciates both Pawniard and Ferroseed getting removed in order to set up and clean teams with ease. Checks to Fighting-types such as Spritzee help Alolan Geodude with its weakness in exchange for trapping Steel-types. Lastly, Flying-types such as Doduo and Vullaby appreciate Alolan Geodude removing Pawniard, and in return they help with checking Grass-types, which can manage Alolan Geodude with ease.</p>"

  "Ponyta": {
    "overview": "<p>Ponyta is an extremely potent and versatile threat in the LC metagame thanks to its blazing Speed tier, impressive defensive stats, and workable offenses. Its decent number of viable sets, ranging from utility to offensively oriented, allows it to edge out its competition in the tier's other Fire-types and always leave its opponent guessing, while its fantastic ability in Flame Body allows Ponyta to spread burns and check most physical attackers. Unfortunately, Ponyta's Stealth Rock weakness and vulnerability to Diglett serve as detriments to it given the prevalence of these factors. Furthermore, Ponyta is usually unable to outlast its counters due to the fairly low PP of its only reliable recovery option in Morning Sun.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An alternative EV spread of 236 Def / 76 SpD / 196 Spe and a Bold nature can be run on Flame Charge sets to further bolster Ponyta's defenses, but only having 18 Speed means that Ponyta has to risk a Speed tie to beat Gastly and Doduo without getting severely weakened; having 19 Speed is generally superior to tanking physical attacks slightly better anyway. Hypnosis can be used on the utility set over Wild Charge, but it is fairly unreliable due to its poor accuracy. Ponyta can opt to run a Life Orb set, but Ponyta is frail, and it is worn down fairly quickly by both Life Orb and Flare Blitz recoil. Morning Sun + 3 Attacks with Eviolite can be used to maintain some of Ponyta's defensive utility while also increasing its offensive capabilities, though the lack of Will-O-Wisp means that Ponyta will rely on taking hits to burn physical attackers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Diglett</strong>: Although Diglett cannot directly switch into Ponyta, it can come onto the field after an ally faints or via pivot support and trap and OHKO Ponyta.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Slowpoke, Mareanie, and Chinchou can all tank at least one Wild Charge (or use it to restore HP in Chinchou's case) and deal heavy damage to Ponyta in return with STAB Scald. More offensively oriented Water-types in Clamperl and Omanyte are usually able to take a hit and set up on Ponyta, though both must be wary of Solar Beam sets.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Archen, Omanyte, and Onix are all capable of tanking Ponyta's STAB attacks and OHKOing it with super effective STAB moves in return. However, the latter two must be wary of Solar Beam, while Archen needs to watch out for Wild Charge.</p> <p><strong>Mudbray</strong>: RestTalk Mudbray can use Rest to recover from Will-O-Wisp burns, increase its Defense when it gets hit by Flare Blitz thanks to Stamina, and threaten to OHKO Ponyta with STAB Earthquake. However, Bloom Doom Ponyta is usually able to get around Mudbray.</p> <p><strong>Sandstorm and Hail</strong>: Both hail from Alolan Vulpix and Snover and sandstorm from Hippopotas keep Ponyta from sufficiently restoring its HP due to Morning Sun's poor recovery outside of sun, thus leaving it extremely vulnerable to chip damage and attacks. However, hail setters aren't able to switch into Ponyta.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Firium Z": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flame Charge is essential for Ponyta, allowing it to outpace the entire unboosted metagame and avoid being trapped and KOed by most variants of Diglett after a boost. Flare Blitz is a strong STAB move that also offers a very powerful Inferno Overdrive to let Ponyta wallbreak or sweep late-game. High Horsepower provides good coverage for Ponyta, letting it hit Pokemon like Onix, Mareanie, and Chinchou for super effective damage. Morning Sun recovery helps to mitigate Flare Blitz recoil and Stealth Rock damage and also pairs well with Flame Body, allowing Ponyta to continuously fish for a burn. Wild Charge is an alternate option that provides additional coverage for Ponyta to hit Pokemon like Staryu and Shellder harder than Ponyta's other moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>196 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature let Ponyta hit 19 Speed, outpacing Gastly and Speed tying with Staryu and Abra before using Flame Charge. 236 Attack EVs give Ponyta's attacks as much power as possible and let Ponyta net important KOs on Pokemon like Eviolite Foongus and Choice Scarf Mienfoo. The remaining EVs are put into Defense to reduce damage from physical attacks. Firium Z allows Ponyta to fire off a one-time 190-Base Power Inferno Overdrive, scoring KOs Ponyta would otherwise miss on Pokemon such as offensive Vullaby and 17 Speed Mienfoo after Stealth Rock damage. Electrium Z is an alternative option to break through Mareanie and Staryu, while Groundium Z can be used to hit Onix and Mareanie.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Even without Eviolite, Ponyta is still moderately bulky and can come in on most neutral or resisted attacks and threaten the foe, though it is best for Ponyta to come in on a free switch to reduce its vulnerability to priority after chip damage. Be careful of doing so if you want to bluff a non-Z-Move set, since the lack of Eviolite may give it away to the opponent. Ponyta's typing and decent natural bulk allow it to come in on Pokemon like Spritzee and Foongus and begin threatening them. Flame Body can be used to pivot in on Mienfoo and threaten to burn it, as Ponyta takes little damage from Fake Out, Knock Off, and U-turn, although Ponyta should try to avoid switching in on High Jump Kick. Setting up with Flame Charge is important, as it allows Ponyta to outspeed Diglett and almost every Choice Scarf Pokemon. Flame Charge can be used on Pokemon Ponyta isn't particularly threatened by or Pokemon that it forces out like Foongus and Snivy. Inferno Overdrive is best used only after Onix faints, as Onix is extremely difficult for Ponyta to take on without a large amount of prior damage. Inferno Overdrive can also be used to KO a Pokemon Ponyta could not defeat with just Flare Blitz, like high HP Timburr or Mienfoo, if the opponent lacks a solid counter to Ponyta.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ponyta really appreciates entry hazard removal support from Pokemon like Staryu due to its vulnerability to every entry hazard, particularly Stealth Rock. Ponyta also appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Mudbray to weaken its targets and break Sturdy from Onix and Magnemite. A good switch-in to Rock- and Ground-types such as Snivy is greatly appreciated, since Ponyta can struggle to take them out without chip damage. Snivy in particular also provides Defog support for Ponyta. If not running Wild Charge, a Grass-type like Ferroseed or Foongus provides a useful switch-in to Staryu and other Water-types. Diglett works very well with Ponyta, since it can trap and KO the otherwise problematic Mareanie and Onix. Mienfoo is an excellent partner, as it can take on the Rock-types Ponyta needs chip damage for, lure in Spritzee, which Ponyta counters if running Morning Sun, and use U-turn to let Ponyta get in safely. Magnemite and Chinchou are also good partners for Ponyta, since their Volt Switch provides a relatively safe way to get Ponyta in, and they also threaten Water-types that stop Ponyta from sweeping.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is Ponyta's most powerful STAB option and hits everything that doesn't resist it for good damage, notably hitting Pokemon like Foongus very hard. High Horsepower is helpful for hitting Pokemon resistant to Flare Blitz, such as Onix and Mareanie. Will-O-Wisp is useful for halving the Attack of physical attackers such as Mienfoo and Mudbray, and Morning Sun is reliable recovery that allows Ponyta to sustain itself throughout a match as well as fish for Flame Body burns if it is not running Will-O-Wisp. Flame Charge is an option that provides Ponyta with an important boost in Speed, which allows it to outpace and KO non-Choice Scarf Diglett. Wild Charge is an option if Ponyta needs to be able to hit Vullaby and Staryu for more damage, but Ponyta struggles to find space for the move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>196 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow Ponyta to hit 19 Speed and outpace most of the unboosted metagame. 156 Defense EVs, 76 Special Defense EVs, and an Eviolite allow Ponyta to hit 21 / 21 defenses and usually avoid notable 2HKOs from powerful attacks like Alolan Grimer's Poison Jab, Pawniard's Knock Off, and defensive Vullaby's Brave Bird. An even bulkier spread of 236 Def / 76 SpD / 196 Spe with an Impish nature and Eviolite can be run to survive the metagame's strongest attacks, such as Reckless Mienfoo's High Jump Kick and Adamant Pawniard's Knock Off, but in return Ponyta no longer outspeeds Gastly and Doduo and cannot Speed tie with Abra and opposing Ponyta. Berry Juice is an alternative item that gives automatic recovery when Ponyta drops below 50% of its HP so that it can run a move other than Morning Sun, but this comes at the cost of a significant amount of bulk. The remaining EVs are invested in Attack to provide Ponyta with notably better damage output, allowing it to 2HKO defensive Mienfoo and have a good chance to OHKO Foongus after Stealth Rock damage. Flame Body is the preferred ability, as it allows Ponyta to discourage foes like Mienfoo from freely using moves like U-turn and Fake Out by threatening to burn them on contact.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ponyta's Flame Body gives it the ability to check a number of physical attackers, which means one should feel free to liberally switch Ponyta into non-Rock- or Ground-type physical attacks. If Ponyta doesn't burn its foe upon switching in, it can make use of its good Speed to burn the foe with Will-O-Wisp and recover its health immediately afterward. Both Snivy and Spritzee are Pokemon that Ponyta is unthreatened by, though it should be wary of Snivy's Glare. Ponyta can threaten most teams with the combination of Will-O-Wisp, Flare Blitz, and High Horsepower, as most Pokemon that can switch into Ponyta's attacking moves are crippled by a burn.</p> <p>If Diglett is on the opponent's team, Ponyta must be played more conservatively and shouldn't be switching in on foes that use pivoting attacks, such as Mienfoo and Vullaby, since they can easily bring Diglett onto the field to KO Ponyta. Ponyta should also only focus on spreading status rather than KOing foes, as it is likely to be weakened from Flare Blitz's recoil and even more susceptible to being revenge killed. Boosting its Speed with Flame Charge is also something Ponyta should attempt to do whenever possible when fighting against teams with Diglett, such as on forced switches, as it will then be able to outpace and KO non-Choice Scarf Diglett. Ponyta should also avoid switching into Stealth Rock, as it will be unable to tank hits as reliably.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>While Ponyta is vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards, it especially hates Stealth Rock, which makes Pokemon capable of removing it such as Vullaby and Staryu ideal partners. Grass-types such as Foongus and Snivy are also good partners for Ponyta, as Ponyta's ability to lure in Water- and Rock-types gives it great synergy with these Pokemon. Snivy in particular is a fantastic teammate for Ponyta, since it can take on Pokemon like Onix, which can both force out Ponyta and set up Stealth Rock, and prevent entry hazards from staying on the field. Because Ponyta shouldn't be completely relied on to check Fighting-types, other Fighting-type checks such as Abra and Spritzee are very appreciated. Lastly, Shell Smash sweepers or other setup Pokemon like Scraggy appreciate Ponyta's ability to burn Pawniard and Fighting-type foes.</p>"
      },
      "Bloom Doom": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Solar Beam gives Ponyta access to a 190-Base Power Bloom Doom, allowing it to function as a lure for Water-types like Staryu, Rock-types like Onix, and Ground-types like Mudbray, which can take on Ponyta's other sets. Flamethrower is Ponyta's most reliable STAB move, dealing consistent damage to most Pokemon that don't resist it and having excellent neutral coverage with Bloom Doom. Its consistency allows Ponyta to clean late-game after the opponent's team is weakened enough. Fire Blast can be used instead for its significantly higher damage and fits better if Ponyta wants to focus more on wallbreaking, as its higher damage is necessary to do so. It notably 2HKOes all Vullaby and Alolan Grimer variants after Stealth Rock. A mixed set with Flare Blitz as the STAB move can also be used, as it is even more powerful than Fire Blast thanks to Ponyta's higher Attack, but the necessary investment into Attack means that Bloom Doom will be significantly weaker, and Ponyta will usually be unable to stay healthy throughout the match due to Flare Blitz's recoil. Flame Charge raises Ponyta's Speed while doing a bit of damage, allowing it to break Sturdy of Pokemon like Onix on the switch before KOing it with Bloom Doom. This also allows it to clean late-game, as the boosted Speed enables it to outpace even very fast Choice Scarf users like Doduo and Gastly. Hypnosis puts a foe to sleep, allowing Ponyta to avoid being revenge killed by foes it cannot OHKO like Rufflet and Focus Sash Abra, as well as avoiding Sucker Punch from Pokemon like Pawniard. It also prevents Spritzee from setting up Calm Mind on Ponyta, which it can otherwise do freely. However, it is important to note Hypnosis's unreliable 60% accuracy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Grassium Z is necessary in order to get access to Bloom Doom and allows Ponyta to function as a lure for Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types. Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature are used to hit 19 Speed, outspeeding Pokemon like Gastly and Doduo and Speed tying with Pokemon like Abra. It also allows it to outspeed Choice Scarf Doduo and Gastly after a Flame Charge. Maximum Special Attack investment allows Ponyta to hit as hard as possible with Flamethrower, Fire Blast, and Bloom Doom so it can wallbreak and clean as well as possible. If Flare Blitz is ran, an alternative spread of 236 Atk / 76 SpA / 196 Spe with a Naive nature should be used, as this allows Ponyta to do as much damage as possible with Flare Blitz while securing the OHKO on defensive Staryu with Bloom Doom. Flash Fire is the ability of choice, as it allows Ponyta to set up a Flame Charge on many Fire-types, such as opposing Ponyta, which would otherwise be able to significantly dent Ponyta due to this set's lack of Eviolite. Ponyta can then use Hypnosis to win the one-on-one against these Fire-types. In addition, Ponyta can become very threatening by getting a Flash Fire boost from Will-O-Wisp from Pokemon like Pumpkaboo-XL. Flame Body is also an option to have a chance of burning physical attackers like Pawniard and Mienfoo, but it relies on Ponyta taking hits, which this set does not like to do due to the lack of Eviolite.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set can use its access to Bloom Doom to either wallbreak early- or mid-game by breaking through a bulky Water-, Rock-, or Ground-type, as this can allow a teammate to sweep late-game or go for a sweep itself late-game thanks to a Flame Charge boost and the ability to break through one of its checks. The first move Ponyta should usually go for is Flame Charge, as this will give it the Speed boost it needs to outspeed Choice Scarf users and Diglett, making it much harder to revenge kill, while also breaking Sturdy on switch-ins like Onix and bringing very bulky Ground-types like Hippopotas and RestTalk Mudbray in range of being KOed by Bloom Doom. If the opponent has a Weak Armor user like Onix or Kabuto, be wary when using Flame Charge, as they will be able to outspeed or Speed tie Ponyta after both get boosted. However, early- or mid-game, it can be smart to go for a Fire Blast or Flamethrower in order to wear down Ponyta's switch-ins so that it can potentially sweep. Since Bloom Doom can only be used once, you should be very wary when using it, as your opponent might try to play around it by switching out, and wasting it will mean this set fails to do its job. If your opponent does not carry bulky Water- and Rock-types or they have all been KOed, Bloom Doom can instead be used to significantly hurt a different bulky Pokemon like Mienfoo or Timburr, as it is more powerful than even STAB Fire Blast. Once Ponyta's checks and counters have been significantly weakened, it can utilize the Speed boost from Flame Charge to sweep. Ponyta does not need all bulky Water- and Rock-types removed if it still has access to Bloom Doom, but it will be unable to sweep if there is still more than one Fire-resistant Pokemon on the opponent's team. Hypnosis can be used to cripple a foe significantly and is especially useful when Focus Sash Abra wants to revenge kill Ponyta, as Ponyta can put it to sleep with the boosted Speed from Flame Charge and proceed to knock it out in two turns. However, relying too much on Hypnosis is generally a bad idea, since it has a low accuracy, and sleep turns are unpredictable. Ponyta can also use Hypnosis on other Pokemon that can take a hit from Ponyta and KO it back, such as Mienfoo, Vullaby, and Alolan Grimer, Pokemon that it can't significantly threaten, such as Mareanie and Munchlax, and Pokemon that might attempt to set up, such as Timburr, Scraggy, and Spritzee. Due to the lack of Eviolite on this set, Ponyta is quite frail, meaning it should not be brought in directly. Instead, bring it in via a slow U-turn or Volt Switch or after a teammate has gone down. In addition, this Ponyta set should avoid taking strong hits as much as possible, as it will often go down very easily.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard control is very important to the success of this Ponyta set; not only can Stealth Rock significantly reduce the number of times Ponyta can switch in due to its weakness to the entry hazard, it also needs Stealth Rock or Spikes up on the opponent's side in order to secure certain crucial KOs, such as the 2HKO onto Eviolite Vullaby with Fire Blast and a chance to OHKO Hippopotas with Bloom Doom. As such, Rapid Spin users like Staryu and Kabuto and entry hazard setters like Ferroseed and Pawniard are good partners. Teammates that appreciate Ponyta luring and KOing bulky Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types work very well with this set. Other Fire-types like Houndour appreciate all of these being removed, Water-types such as Corphish and Carvanha like bulky Water-types being gone, Flying-types like Doduo and Rufflet enjoy Rock-types getting removed, and Electric-types like Magnemite and Elekid have an easier time if Ground-types are taken out. Even though this Ponyta set can beat opposing Fire-types one-on-one thanks to Flash Fire, it has to rely on Hypnosis to not get worn down too much. As such, it appreciates teammates like Diglett and Onix to beat Pokemon like opposing Ponyta. Since Ponyta can only use Bloom Doom once, it should not be its team's main answer to Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types. As such, another check to these types is appreciated. Grass-types like Snivy and Pumpkaboo-XL and Water-types like Staryu and Chinchou work well.</p>"
      },
      "Sunny Day": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast is Ponyta's strongest special STAB attack and is capable of hitting bulkier offensive threats in Mienfoo and Vullaby for 2HKOs outside of sun. Solar Beam is useful for hitting Water- and Rock-types such as Chinchou and Omanyte for OHKOs, while Will-O-Wisp is another option that allows Ponyta to burn physical attackers without relying on Flame Body. Sunny Day is mandatory for giving Solar Beam one turn activation, as well as boosting the power of Fire Blast, weakening Water-type attacks, and increasing Morning Sun's recovery. Morning Sun recovers two thirds of Ponyta's maximum HP under the sun and allows it to sustain itself throughout the match.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>156 EVs invested in Defense with an Eviolite allow Ponyta to hit 21 Defense and tank powerful hits in Pawniard's Knock Off and Vullaby's Brave Bird, while a Firium Z can be used over Eviolite to allow Ponyta to use Z-Sunny Day, which increases its Speed stat by one stage in addition to summoning sun. However, Ponyta must be more careful with powerful attackers and priority moves if using Firium Z. 196 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Ponyta to hit 19 Speed and outpace a good portion of the unboosted metagame, while 156 Special Attack EVs give Ponyta an impressive amount of special wallbreaking prowess. An alternative spread with 76 Special Attack investment and 76 Special Defense investment can be used on Will-O-Wisp sets, but on Solar Beam sets, the extra power is generally more useful than hitting a good Special Defense number.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>After setting up with Sunny Day, it is best that Ponyta uses Fire Blast, as the boost from sun will make it extremely powerful. Ponyta must be wary of opposing Water- and Rock-types, however, and should use Solar Beam when predicting a switch into Pokemon of these types. Ponyta should switch out against foes that don't take notable damage from either of its moves, such as Archen and Mareanie, to avoid being inflicted with status or hit by a super effective attack. Morning Sun can be used when Ponyta is low on HP and is best used against foes that can't do sufficient damage to Ponyta, such as Larvesta and Magnemite. Ponyta must ensure that it can reliably set up Sunny Day if holding a Firium Z, as it will severely lack in bulk compared to when it's holding an Eviolite. Pokemon that can't do much damage to Ponyta, such as Spritzee, Ferroseed, and Snivy, generally make for good setup opportunities.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ponyta's vulnerability to entry hazards means that teammates capable of removing them, such as Staryu and Vullaby, are very appreciated. Because this set struggles to break past Mareanie, Pokemon that can take care of it, such as Mudbray and particularly Diglett, take some pressure off of Ponyta and allow it to sweep more easily. If Ponyta is running Z-Sunny Day, Pokemon that are capable of providing it with Memento support, such as Diglett and Cottonee, are quite helpful in terms of providing Ponyta with an easy setup opportunity due to its frailty when holding a Firium Z.</p>"

  "Slowpoke": {
    "overview": "<p>One of the most common tanks in the metagame, Slowpoke has great Defense and HP stats that allow it to tank most physical moves in conjunction with a reliable recovery option in Slack Off and a great defensive ability in Regenerator. Alongside its defensive stats, Slowpoke also has access to a great defensive moveset with utility moves such as Thunder Wave and good attacking options such as Scald, and moderate Attack and Special Attack stats that allow it to hit decently hard. Slowpoke's defensive typing is also beneficial, giving it resistances to many common attacks. Slowpoke's great physical Defense makes it a consistent and solid check to Mudbray, as it can easily take Mudbray's moves and KO it with Scald. Slowpoke is also welcome on most defensive cores due to its ability to freely switch out when it pleases due to the healing provided by Regenerator. Unfortunately, Slowpoke is rather passive and is often used as setup bait for Pokemon it can't touch, such as Scraggy, and it also serves as a free switch in for Pokemon such as Snivy. The common move Knock Off is a big threat to Slowpoke due to its high dependency on its Eviolite. Common pivoting moves like Volt Switch and U-turn are also threatening towards Slowpoke because they both deal super effective damage and provide momentum for the opposing team, which can be detrimental late-game.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Future Sight and Earthquake are options for Slowpoke's 4th moveslot, as the former does a ton of damage once it hits and the latter can deal with Electric-types; however, they are underwhelming because Future Sight gives the opponent a free turn, allowing them to either KO Slowpoke or switch to a Dark-type check, and Electric-types are generally faster than Slowpoke and can probably KO it before it can hit them with Earthquake. Slowpoke can also run a Curse set with physical attacks such as Zen Headbutt and Aqua Tail, since its Attack is higher than its Special Attack. Curse turns Slowpoke into a slow physical bulky sweeper that can tank moves and then hit pretty hard. Slowpoke can also set up and sweep with Trick Room because of its slow Speed stat; however, the limited duration of Trick Room is what causes it to become underwhelming.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-type Pokemon such as Ferroseed, Foongus, and Snivy are main checks to Slowpoke due to their ability to hit Slowpoke's weaker Special Defense and wall most of Slowpoke's moves; however, they need to be wary of Fire Blast or Ice Beam. Foongus needs to be careful of Slowpoke's Psychic, but it can 2HKO Slowpoke with Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Pawniard and Vullaby are a threat to Slowpoke, as they can wall most of Slowpoke's moves and easily KO it in return with powerful STAB attacks; they can also cripple Slowpoke's bulk with STAB Knock Off. However, Pawniard needs to be cautious of Fire Blast, and most Dark-types don't appreciate being hit with Thunder Wave or burned by Scald.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-type Pokemon such as Chinchou and Magnemite can hit Slowpoke's weaker Special Defense with their STAB attacks and KO it. Chinchou especially can wall all of Slowpoke's moves, as it is part Water-type and gets healed by Thunder Wave; utility Chinchou can also use Heal Bell to cure status from Slowpoke's victims. Magnemite also deserves a mention due its ability to resist Slowpoke's Psychic and KO it with powerful STAB moves. Furthermore, Recycle Magnemite can easily switch into Slowpoke any time and force it out, although all Magnemite variants needs to watch out for Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off is a common move in the LC metagame, and Slowpoke does not appreciate it due to it doing a lot of super effective damage and removing Slowpoke's Eviolite, which is very important for its role as a tank. Common users include Mienfoo, Timburr, Pawniard, and Vullaby, and although the Fighting-types need to watch out for Psychic, Knock Off makes it harder for Slowpoke to switch into them.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Slack Off is Slowpoke's most reliable recovery option and allows it to maintain its longevity. Scald is a powerful STAB move that can hit Fire-, Rock-, and Ground-types such as Ponyta, Onix, and Mudbray super effectively; it can also provide some utility by burning physical attackers to render them weak. Psychic is Slowpoke's secondary powerful STAB move, hitting common Poison- and Fighting-types like Mienfoo, Foongus, and Croagunk. Croagunk especially is an important target due to its ability to easily switch into Scald. Thunder Wave is an important utility move that Slowpoke has, and it can spread paralysis to cripple fast offensive Pokemon such as Abra; however, Slowpoke still cannot outspeed paralyzed 18 Speed Pokemon. Fire Blast is an alternative option as a powerful coverage move that hits Pawniard, Ferroseed, Alolan Sandshrew, Magnemite, and Snivy. Alternatively, Slowpoke can use Calm Mind on defensive cores or bulkier teams once Dark-types have been eliminated. It can set up to become more specially bulky and sweep opposing teams with powerful special attacks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Slowpoke's EV spread allows it to be as tanky as possible, enabling it to tank most physical and special attacks effectively. In addition, the HP EVs allow Slowpoke to reach 27 HP, which enables it to recover 9 HP when switching out instead of 8 HP. The remaining EVs are put into Slowpoke's Special Attack so it can retaliate with powerful moves after it tanks a hit, 2HKOing defensive Foongus and bulky Mienfoo with Psychic. The main EV spread and a Calm nature maximizes Special Defense, allowing Slowpoke to consistently avoid the OHKO from Life Orb Gastly's Shadow Ball and Snivy's Leaf Storm. Alternatively, the same EV spread can be run but with only 36 Special Attack and 76 Speed EVs, which allows Slowpoke to outspeed Foongus; however, the drop from 12 Special Attack to 11 worsens the damage rolls against 14 Special Defense Pokemon with Eviolite, meaning Slowpoke can't 2HKO Foongus with Psychic from full health anymore. If Calm Mind is run, a physically defensive EV spread of 116 HP / 236 Def / 116 SpA / 36 SpD should be used, turning Slowpoke into a more physically defensive tank that almost completely shuts down Mudbray, while also better checking Timburr without Bulk Up. Eviolite is very important to Slowpoke, as it helps Slowpoke tank moves more efficiently. Regenerator is very beneficial, as it allows Slowpoke to recover health while switching out, which it does often due to its defensive role.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Slowpoke should be switched into Pokemon it can handle, tanking their hits and KOing them back. Slowpoke can also be sent out to force switches, although it should generally immediately switch out afterwards. Slowpoke also shouldn't be switched in and out randomly to just get its HP restored from Regenerator, as its checks are very common in the metagame, and if it switches in carelessly, it might take a super effective move such as Knock Off. Knock Off in general should be avoided, as it deals super effective damage and removes Slowpoke's important Eviolite, which hinders its bulk. Slowpoke can also spread paralysis once it switches in, potentially crippling fast offensive Pokemon. When Slowpoke reaches a low amount of HP, it should switch out to gain more HP and then switch into a Pokemon it can use Slack Off against so it can recover its HP fully. Slowpoke should avoid some mixed or special attackers, as its Special Defense is lacking compared to its Defense, meaning it might get KOed by powerful special attacks; it should still be able to switch into resisted special attacks, but should be wary in general. If Slowpoke is running Calm Mind, it should be kept healthy until late-game when most of its checks are defeated and it can set up on passive Pokemon or Pokemon whose attacks it resists and then clean the rest of the opposing team. Slowpoke can also consistently check hail teams, as it can take care of Slush Rush sweepers such as Alolan Sandshrew and hail setters such as Snover with Fire Blast.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Grass-types make good teammates, as they can wall incoming Grass- and Electric-type attacks and provide good type synergy with Slowpoke, as Slowpoke can take care of the Fire- and Ice-type Pokemon Grass-types don't appreciate such as Ponyta and Alolan Sandshrew. Foongus and Ferroseed make great partners, and the latter can also set entry hazards to help Slowpoke take care of opposing Pokemon more easily. Slowpoke hates Knock Off, so Pokemon that don't mind Knock Off such as Sticky Hold users like Trubbish are great. Slowpoke can also wall Psychic-types for Trubbish, which in return can take of most Grass-types that don't have a secondary Poison typing. Pokemon that can check Grass-, Electric-, and Dark-type Pokemon are favorable. Pawniard deserves a mention here because it provides good type synergy with Slowpokeand appreciates Slowpoke's ability to spread paralysis. Vullaby also deserves a mention, as it can wall most Dark-types such as Scraggy and take care of Grass-types such as Foongus; it also provides nifty type synergy with Slowpoke, as the two form a nice core that can take on nearly everything except Electric-types. Fighting-type Pokemon such as Mienfoo can also be good teammates, as they can take care of Dark-types for Slowpoke, while Slowpoke can wall most Psychic-types and other checks. Mienfoo also forms a solid Regenerator core with Slowpoke and is a decent Knock Off absorber, especially if it runs Acrobatics.</p>"

  "Magnemite": {
    "overview": "<p>Magnemite is a solid Pokemon in the LC metagame, able to act as a pivot or as a powerful attacker. Its viability stems from its fantastic Special Attack, allowing it to fire off powerful attacks without requiring a boosting item. It is further set apart from other special attackers by its fantastic typing that gives it a plethora of resistances, access to Volt Switch that allows it to serve as a pivot, and access to Sturdy + Berry Juice, allowing it to recover health consistently. However, Magnemite is hindered in the LC metagame by weaknesses to the common Fighting- and Ground-type moves. Additionally, Magnemite only hits 15 Speed, leaving it reliant on a Choice Scarf if it wants to outspeed the metagame or an intact Berry Juice to take hits against offensive teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Magnemite can run Eviolite with Magnet Pull and Hidden Power Fighting to reliably trap and remove opposing Steel-types, such as Pawniard and Ferroseed. However, most teams can wear down these Pokemon in other ways or trap them with Diglett, and the set is much less effective as a pivot. Magnemite can also work as a rain setter, with access to Rain Dance, Thunder, and pseudo-recovery with Sturdy and Berry Juice. Magic Coat is an option to surprise foes that try to use status moves or set entry hazards to break Magnemite's Sturdy, and it can work as a last-ditch attempt to stop the opponent from setting Sticky Web. However, it is hard to find a place for this on most sets, and in most situations Magnemite would prefer to attack or pivot out anyway. Finally, Magnemite does have access to Light Screen and Reflect, but screens are mostly useless in LC.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types make it very hard for Magnemite to comfortably pivot thanks to their immunity to Volt Switch. Diglett, while not able to switch in, is able to remove Magnemite from battle if it is locked into an Electric-type attack or not running a Choice Scarf. Drilbur fears Flash Cannon, it but can come in on Magnemite's Electric-type attacks and always OHKO thanks to its ability to bypass Sturdy with Mold Breaker. Mudbray gets a Defense boost from being hit by Flash Cannon, though RestTalk variants can't safely switch into either set. Lastly, specially defensive Hippopotas and Numel, though less common, can come in on any of Magnemite's attacks and easily KO with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Chinchou</strong>: Chinchou resists Flash Cannon and is immune to Volt Switch and Thunderbolt thanks to Volt Absorb. While Magnemite's Hidden Power can do some damage on the switch, Chinchou forces predictions that are difficult for the Magnemite user to make. Chinchou can also burn Magnemite with Scald, effectively neutering the SturdyJuice set.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-type Pokemon take significant damage from Magnemite's attacks, but if they get into the battle, they can cripple it with Knock Off or restore their own health using Drain Punch. Additionally, priority attacks from Fighting-types such as Timburr and Croagunk can significantly damage Magnemite and revenge kill it later in a game.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon such as Munchlax take little damage from Magnemite's attacks, and they can heal off the damage they do take while either setting up against Magnemite or simply KOing it. However, Magnemite can simply pivot out of these Pokemon with Volt Switch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch is Magnemite's primary STAB attack and gives it momentum by allowing it to switch out to a teammate while weakening switch-ins. Flash Cannon is a more powerful alternative that doesn't require Magnemite to switch out, and it hits most of what resists Volt Switch. It also hits the common Fairy type for super effective damage. Thunderbolt is a more powerful alternative to Volt Switch, and it is useful in scenarios where Magnemite should be left in battle, especially later in the game. Hidden Power Fire allows Magnemite to almost always OHKO Berry Juice Ferroseed and 2HKO Eviolite Ferroseed. Hidden Power Ground is useful for hitting the Electric-types, such as Chinchou and opposing Magnemite, that would otherwise wall Magnemite. Hidden Power Grass also hits Chinchou and is useful against teams with both a Water- and a Ground-type, as it eases prediction, but it comes at the cost of dealing less damage to opposing Magnemite. Hidden Power Fighting is an option to trap and KO Pawniard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Magnemite maximizes its Speed investment so that it can hit 21 Speed, or 22 with a Timid nature, when equipped with a Choice Scarf. While 21 is sufficient to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, 22 Speed allows it to outspeed other Choice Scarf users and tie with Scraggy after a Dragon Dance. The remaining EVs go into maximizing Magnemite's naturally high Special Attack to allow it to hit as hard as possible. A Modest nature further boosts Magnemite's Special Attack stat, but at the expense of a Speed point, as discussed. Choice Scarf boosts Magnemite's low base Speed to a high enough level to put pressure on offensive teams. Analytic is the preferred ability on this set, as it allows Magnemite to punish switch-ins. However, if Hidden Power Fire is run, Magnet Pull allows Magnemite to trap and KO Steel-types such as Ferroseed. Sturdy can also be run, allowing Magnemite to take a powerful attack once during a match if entry hazards are kept off of the field. If no Hidden Power is run, an EV spread of 36 Def / 236 SpA / 236 Spe can be used for extra bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Magnemite is especially useful against frailer offensive teams, where it can outspeed unboosted attackers and wear them down over the course of a battle. Care should be taken not to lock Magnemite into Electric-type moves early in the game if the opponent has a Ground-type or Chinchou, which could come into the attack and potentially use it as a setup opportunity. As the game wears on, and the opponent's Electric-type checks are weakened, Magnemite can spam Volt Switch more freely. This Magnemite set does not appreciate taking unresisted, or even powerful resisted, hits, so it works best when sent in to revenge kill an opposing Pokemon, when cleaning an opponent's team late-game, or when you are sure that the foe won't use an attacking move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Although less effective as a Fairy-type check than SturdyJuice sets, Choice Scarf Magnemite can still threaten Fairy-types, making Fighting-types, such as Mienfoo, Scraggy, and Timburr, good partners. These pokemon can also absorb Knock Off aimed at Magnemite. Snivy and Foongus both work well with this Magnemite set, able to switch into Chinchou and the Ground-types that Magnemite brings and wear them down, hopefully allowing Magnemite to spam Volt Switch more freely later in the game. Foongus works especially well due to Regenerator, which allows it to pivot in and out as Magnemite does throughout the game. Foongus also works as a Fighting-type check, a necessity when using Magnemite, with other options including Spritzee, Snubbull, and Larvesta. Many of these Pokemon also appreciate Magnet Pull variants of Magnemite being able to trap Ferroseed in particular. Choice Scarf Magnemite works well with slower pivots, which can bring it into the battle unharmed, such as Mienfoo, the previously mentioned Larvesta, and bulkier variants of Vullaby. Additionally, forming VoltTurn cores with these Pokemon works well to wear down the opponent's team. For Magnemite to be able to pivot without fear, it appreciates having Ground- and Electric-types removed from the match. Diglett can trap and remove opposing Electric-types handily, and can also trap weakened Ground-types, albeit less effectively. With these Pokemon removed from the match, Volt Switch can be spammed more freely.</p>"
      },
      "SturdyJuice": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch allows Magnemite to act as a pivot and has decent offensive potential because of Magnemite's high Special Attack and STAB. Flash Cannon is a more powerful STAB alternative that doesn't require Magnemite to switch out, and it hits most of what resists Volt Switch. It also hits the common Fairy type for super effective damage. Recycle allows Magnemite to regenerate its Berry Juice, restoring its HP to full. In the last slot, Endure can be used to ensure that Magnemite survives an attack, even if its Sturdy is broken, allowing it to regenerate its HP and get Sturdy back intact. Alternatively, if a broken Sturdy is not a concern, Hidden Power Ground can be run to hit Electric-types, such as Chinchou and opposing Magnemite, that resist Magnemite's STAB attacks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>236 Special Attack EVs and 236 Speed EVs maximize Magnemite's offensive potential. The remaining EVs go into Defense to allow Magnemite to take on physical priority attacks somewhat better. If Hidden Power Ground is run, the EV spread should be changed to 240 SpA / 236 Spe to make up for the IV drop that running Hidden Power Ground causes. This Magnemite set doesn't need to invest significantly in bulk because the point of the set is to take advantage of Sturdy to survive attacks. Berry Juice gives Magnemite a form of recovery that can be regenerated with Recycle. A Modest nature is used to maximize Magnemite's offensive potential, but a Timid one can also be used if it is essential for Magnemite to outspeed 14 Speed Pokemon, including Weak Armor variants of Vullaby before they are boosted, and most Corphish.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set relies on avoiding Knock Off, which removes Magnemite's ability to regenerate its Berry Juice and recover HP. While some Knock Off users are obvious, such as Pawniard, others, such as Cottonee, Abra, and Ferroseed, can be more unexpected, and a mispredict against these Pokemon can lead to Magnemite being crippled for the rest of the match. Most resisted attacks can be switched into and out of throughout the match, with Magnemite using Volt Switch to pivot in and out and Recycle to recover its health. Strong neutral and super effective attacks should not be switched into if entry hazards are on the field, or if Magnemite has taken prior damage, because Sturdy will no longer be intact. Magnemite can use Endure when its Sturdy is broken but when it has an intact Berry Juice to survive a hit that would otherwise KO it and get to full health, where it will almost always survive any attack with Sturdy. However, if an opponent expects an Endure, they can use the free turn as an opportunity to boost stats, set entry hazards, or recover their own Pokemon's health.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Magnemite set is most suited for offensive teams that appreciate its ability to act as a last-ditch counter to setup sweepers such as Shellder, Carvanha, and Rufflet. This Magnemite set deals with Fairy-types extremely effectively, being able to hit them hard with Flash Cannon without fear of being worn down thanks to Recycle and Berry Juice. Thus, Mienfoo, Scraggy, and Timburr appreciate having Magnemite on their team. Snivy and Foongus both work well with Magnemite, as they are able to switch into Chinchou and the Ground-types that Magnemite brings in and wear them down, hopefully allowing Magnemite to spam Volt Switch more freely later in the game. Foongus works especially well due to Regenerator, which allows it to pivot in and out as Magnemite does throughout the game. Magnemite also works well with Mienfoo, Larvesta, and Vullaby to form a VoltTurn core and wear down the opponent's team. Larvesta works as a Fighting-type check, a necessity when using Magnemite due to its Fighting-type weakness and the prevalence of Knock Off among Fighting-types. Other Fighting checks include Snubbull, Spritzee, and Foongus. Magnemite appreciates Rapid Spin, which keeps hazards off of the field and thus allows Magnemite to not only pivot in and out of battle without being worn down but also keep its Sturdy intact. Staryu can somewhat handle the Ground-types that threaten Magnemite, while Drilbur can somewhat handle the Electric-types that resist Magnemite's attacks. For Magnemite to be able to pivot without fear, it appreciates having Ground- and Electric-types removed from the match. Diglett can trap and remove opposing Electric-types handily, and can also trap weakened Ground-types, albeit less effectively. With these Pokemon removed from the match, Volt Switch can be spammed more freely. Lastly, users of Toxic Spikes can spread poison to the opponent's team, allowing Magnemite to stall its foes out using Recycle as they lose HP. Mareanie and Skrelp both handle the Fire-types that give this Magnemite set trouble, and Trubbish can absorb Knock Off, which often comes directed at Magnemite, which makes all three of these Pokemon good partners.</p>"

  "Doduo": {
    "overview": "<p>Doduo's excellent Attack stat, powerful STAB moves, and good coverage options make it one of the best physical attackers in the LC metagame. It typically takes on the role of a powerful wallbreaker, using its very good Speed stat and coverage options to wear down opposing teams or to end games against slower teams. It is helped in its wallbreaking by its coverage options, which make it impossible to safely switch into. Doduo can also flip its wallbreaking set on its head and run a Choice Scarf set, which outspeeds most of the Pokemon that typically revenge kill it and can reliably clean up weakened teams late-game. However, Doduo suffers from poor defensive stats that leave it vulnerable to revenge killing and priority attacks. Furthermore, its most powerful and spammable move, Brave Bird, has significant recoil damage, which, coupled with its Stealth Rock weakness, means it tends to get worn down very fast.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Life Orb makes Doduo one of the hardest-hitting attackers in the metagame, enhancing its wallbreaking capability, but this often lets it attack only two or three times over the course of a game before KOing itself with recoil. Double-Edge is an option for a more powerful Normal-type STAB move, but it comes with high recoil damage to Doduo. Various Hidden Powers, including Hidden Power Grass, can be run to surprise various checks to Doduo that aren't KOed by a coverage move, such as Tirtouga. A Focus Sash set with Flail or Endeavor and Quick Attack is possible, but it requires substantial support to use. Swords Dance can be used to bring Doduo's Attack to insane levels, but due to its frailty, Doduo will rarely be able to get the move off safely. Agility can be used to boost Doduo's Speed, but, similarly to Swords Dance, Doduo has trouble finding opportunities to use it. Drill Peck can be used as a Flying-type STAB move with no recoil, but it comes at the cost of substantial power. Thrash is a more powerful Normal-type STAB move, but it locks Doduo into it, which can give the Pokemon that resist it free setup turns. Steel Wing is a potential coverage move for Archen, but it forces Doduo to forgo more generally useful coverage. Roost is a possibility to recover Doduo's HP, but Doduo will usually not get this opportunity because it is so frail. Finally, Facade is an option as an extremely powerful Normal-type STAB move for when Doduo is inflicted with a status condition, but most Pokemon that inflict status conditions will outright KO Doduo anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: As Doduo is nearly impossible to switch into safely, the best way to take it out is offensively. Choice Scarf users such as Magnemite, Chinchou, and Pawniard easily outspeed and KO non-Choice Scarf Doduo, as do naturally fast Pokemon such as Elekid and Abra. The Choice Scarf variant is more susceptible to priority, such as Pawniard's Sucker Punch, which will wear it down rapidly.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types, especially those with high Defense, make decent Doduo checks, though they have to be wary of Jump Kick. Weak Armor users such as Dwebble and Omanyte can take an attack while gaining a Speed boost and take out Doduo or set up Stealth Rock. Onix and Tirtouga both can survive a Jump Kick and KO in return, and defensive Archen deserves a special mention as one of the few Pokemon that are not 2HKOed by any Doduo variant from full health.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-type Pokemon can make good checks to Doduo. Chinchou and Magnemite can take a hit and KO back or outspeed non-Choice Scarf Doduo with Choice Scarves of their own and revenge kill it. Elekid can outspeed non-Choice Scarf Doduo and take it out, although it takes substantial damage from Quick Attack, and Choice Scarf variants of Elekid are among the only Pokemon that outspeed and take out Choice Scarf Doduo.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird is an incredibly powerful STAB attack that does significant damage to anything that doesn't resist it, though at the cost of dealing significant recoil damage to Doduo. Knock Off can be used to remove the items of Pokemon that switch into Doduo, softening them up for Doduo or its teammates to better deal with them. Jump Kick hits Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon for super effective damage, making it risky for these Pokemon to switch into a predicted Brave Bird. Quick Attack gives Doduo a priority move that hits fairly hard thanks to its high Attack. Return is an alternative that gives Doduo another powerful STAB move that hits Pokemon that resist Brave Bird and don't mind Jump Kick, such as Chinchou, without causing recoil damage, but most Pokemon are hit plenty hard by Doduo's first three moves. Substitute is a possibility as well, which lets Doduo activate Berry Juice when necessary and play around Pawniard's Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Doduo's Attack, to allow it to hit as hard as possible, and its Speed, to allow it to outspeed a majority of the metagame while breaking it down. With a Jolly nature, Doduo hits 18 Speed, allowing it to become even harder to switch into and reliably outspeed the likes of Cottonee, Snivy, and Chinchou. Berry Juice is useful to allow Doduo to take weak priority attacks or switch into Stealth Rock more times during a match, making it less prone to getting worn down. Early Bird is the preferred ability, as both of Doduo's other abilities are practically useless competitively.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Doduo should be brought in either by a slow pivot or after a Pokemon faints, as it doesn't have the bulk to take even most resisted hits reliably. After it comes in, Doduo can spam its powerful attacks. Knock Off is a good choice early-game to wear down Doduo's checks and counters. After Pokemon that resist Flying have been worn down or picked off with Jump Kick, Doduo can spam Brave Bird to clean up opposing teams. Scouting for opposing Choice Scarf users is helpful so Doduo isn't unexpectedly outsped while attempting to attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slow pivots allow Doduo to enter the match safely. Mienfoo does this well, as it can also beat the Rock- and Steel-types that threaten Doduo while wearing down teams with Knock Off, as does Chinchou, which checks the Electric-type Pokemon that resist Brave Bird. Pokemon such as Onix, Omanyte, and Archen synergize with Doduo fairly well and can set up entry hazards that wear down opposing teams and make Doduo even more difficult to switch into. Entry hazard control is also appreciated; Staryu and Drilbur can spin away Stealth Rock that wears Doduo down. Offensive Pokemon that share checks and counters with Doduo can wear down said Pokemon. Other Flying-types work especially well, including Vullaby and Rufflet. Diglett also makes a very good partner to Doduo, being able to trap and remove Rock-, Steel-, and Electric-type Pokemon that aim to check it. Lastly, Healing Wish and Z-Memento users, such as Cottonee, make good partners for Doduo, allowing it to wear down its own checks and counters and then healing it to sweep late in the game.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird is Doduo's most powerful and spammable move, dealing enormous damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Knock Off removes defensive items, such as Eviolite and Berry Juice, from switch-ins to Doduo, allowing Doduo or its teammates to beat them more easily late in the match. Jump Kick hits the Steel- and Rock-types that resist Brave Bird for super effective damage and makes Doduo very hard to switch into. Return is another powerful STAB move that doesn't inflict recoil damage on Doduo while still hitting what doesn't resist it for good damage. Quick Attack is an alternative that lets Doduo act as an emergency revenge killer against weakened faster Pokemon or weakened Pokemon with priority.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Doduo's Attack and Speed stats so it can clean as well as possible. With a Jolly nature and a Choice Scarf, Doduo hits 27 Speed, tying with Choice Scarf Gastly and outspeeding Choice Scarf users such as Chinchou and Mienfoo as well as boosted Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Scraggy and most Shell Smash Omanyte and Shellder. Choice Scarf Doduo also outspeeds Adamant Alolan Sandshrew in hail and Modest Bellsprout in sun, so it can check weather teams if necessary. An Adamant nature can be run to increase Doduo's attacking power, but it will Speed tie with some of the aforementioned threats and lose to the weather sweepers. Early Bird is used because Doduo's other two abilities are more or less competitively useless.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use this set as a revenge killer or a late-game cleaner. Avoid switching Doduo into attacks, as it has poor bulk and already is worn down quickly due to its reliance on Brave Bird to clean opposing teams. Once it is in, Doduo can spam its powerful Brave Bird, or, if Rock-type checks have yet to be weakened, lure them in and KO or weaken them with Knock Off or Jump Kick. If Doduo is attempting to clean late-game, be wary of Brave Bird recoil damage, and lock Doduo into Return if possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazards are extremely helpful to wear down Pokemon so Doduo can take them out. Teammates such as Onix, Omanyte, and Dwebble can set Stealth Rock effectively and have good synergy with Doduo. This Doduo set can't wear down its own checks and counters very well due to its inability to switch moves, so Pokemon that can wear these checks and counters down for it make good partners. Meowth, Vullaby, and Rufflet all bring in common checks to Doduo and can wear them down for Doduo to sweep later in a game. Slow pivots allow Doduo to enter the match safely. Mienfoo does this well, as it can also beat the Rock- and Steel-types that threaten Doduo while wearing down teams with Knock Off, as does Chinchou, which checks the Electric-type Pokemon that resist Brave Bird. Finally, Diglett makes a good partner to Doduo, able to trap and remove Rock-, Steel-, and Electric-type Pokemon that aim to check it.</p>"

Seel's above-average defenses give it ample room to pull of a successful trap and stall out damage. The drawback to this is once your opponent becomes aware of the strategy, it can be easy to play around with moves such as U-turn and Volt Switch or even with ample prediction, causing the momentum to go towards the opponent rather the user. Because of these limiting factors, it is a good rule of thumb to bring another utility Water-Type like Frillish or Mareanie. Regardless, if you're set on using Seel, Perish trapping is the way to go.</p>"}},

Other bulky Poison-types like Foongus and Mareanie use their secondary typings to not completely fall flat to Diglett and to pivot effectively with Regenerator, respectively.

This leaves Grimer outclassed by Trubbish, as its greater Speed lets it perform Grimer's job more effectively, and it can set up Spikes or keep restoring its HP repeatedly with Recycle and Berry Juice.</p>"}},

  "Grimer-Alola": {
    "overview": "<p>Alolan Grimer boasts a solid Poison / Dark typing, which grants it a sole weakness to Ground. Its amazing typing is coupled with solid 80 / 50 / 50 bulk that is further boosted by Eviolite. It also has access to Poison Touch, which adds to its many contact moves the extra chance of poisoning. Alolan Grimer acts as a wonderful Pursuit trapper with a better typing than Pawniard and better bulk than Stunky; on top of this, it has a good STAB combination and access to coverage moves like Fire Punch for Steel-types. However, it is quite slow, meaning that it almost always has to take a hit before moving. It's also vulnerable to entry hazards and burns, and the lack of Berry Juice and reliable recovery limits its longevity.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Giga Drain allows Alolan Grimer to heavily damage Onix in particular once its Sturdy has been broken, in addition to hitting Tirtouga, Omanyte, and Kabuto. Memento can be used when Alolan Grimer has done its job, reducing the opponent's offensive pressure and easing the setup of sweepers such as Nasty Plot Vullaby, Shell Smash Shellder, and Swords Dance Pawniard. Snarl can hit Abra and Gastly behind a Substitute, but Alolan Grimer's Special Attack is very low, meaning it won't hit hard. For the Berry Juice set, Thief can be used once Alolan Grimer's item has been used; however, Knock Off is usually better because it packs more power. Alolan Grimer can run a Rock Polish set, but it lacks the power to OHKO most foes and will be outsped by most Choice Scarf users even at +2 if it runs an Adamant nature. Stone Edge can be used to hit Flying-types such as Archen and Vullaby hard, but both dislike losing their items, and Alolan Grimer has issues fitting it into a set; the Pursuit trap set appreciates Shadow Sneak and Fire Punch more, and the RestTalk set has room only for its STAB moves. Curse can be used on the RestTalk set, allowing Alolan Grimer to boost its Attack and Defense; however, it has to forgo one of its STAB moves, which is hard to justify; if Alolan Grimer forgoes Knock Off, then Steel-types totally wall it; if it forgoes Poison Jab or Gunk Shot, then Fighting- and Fairy-types hard check it. Taunt can shut down opposing walls, but it's unreliable due to Alolan Grimer's low Speed and also because Alolan Grimer can damage walls with Knock Off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Diglett is a nightmare for Alolan Grimer because it can trap and KO Alolan Grimer with Earthquake after Stealth Rock. Mudbray can take any hit from Alolan Grimer and retaliate with an Earthquake; RestTalk variants can also get around poison. Hippopotas can tank any hit from Alolan Grimer and KO it with Earthquake; Alolan Grimer also dislikes the sand damage and the possible Stealth Rock Hippopotas can set up. However, Hippopotas does not like being poisoned by Alolan Grimer's moves and hates losing its Eviolite.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Even though they do not appreciate Knock Off, Steel-types can check Alolan Grimer quite well. Pawniard is a prime example, as it completely stops the RestTalk set and can check the Pursuit trap set if it lacks Fire Punch. Magnemite does not appreciate Knock Off (especially Berry Juice variants) and gets 2HKOed by Fire Punch but can 2HKO Alolan Grimer with Thunderbolt or pivot out with Volt Switch, gaining momentum.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types resist Poison Jab and Gunk Shot, making it hard for Alolan Grimer to hit them hard. Onix can force Alolan Grimer, giving it opportunities to set up Stealth Rock. Archen resists Alolan Grimer's Poison-type moves and can threaten it with Earthquake but should be wary of Knock Off. Shell Smash users such as Omanyte and Tirtouga can use Alolan Grimer as setup bait because it lacks a solid option against them.</p> <p><strong>Croagunk</strong>: Croagunk stops Alolan Grimer no matter the set; it resists both of Alolan Grimer's STAB moves, is immune to poison by virtue of its typing, is only 3HKOed by Fire Punch even factoring in Dry Skin, and can use Alolan Grimer as setup bait for Nasty Plot or Bulk Up.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: The Pursuit trap set suffers from residual damage because it lacks a form of recovery besides Berry Juice. Weather damage such as from sand and hail, entry hazards such as Spikes and Stealth Rock, and burns constantly reduce Alolan Grimer's HP.</p>",

      "Pursuit Trap": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With Pursuit, Alolan Grimer can trap threats such as Abra and Gastly while also trapping weakened foes such as Pumpkaboo-XL and Slowpoke. Knock Off is a powerful Dark-type STAB move with the bonus effect of removing items. Both of these moves also come with a 30% chance of poisoning foes thanks to Poison Touch. Poison Jab is the preferred move in the third moveslot because it has perfect accuracy, hits decently hard, and boasts an increased 51% chance of poisoning. On the other hand, Gunk Shot trades these for more power, notably OHKOing Spritzee after Stealth Rock damage most of the time. For the last moveslot, Shadow Sneak can be used to pick off weakened targets and to bypass Alolan Grimer's terrible Speed. Alternatively, Fire Punch hits the Steel-types that check Alolan Grimer, with a good chance to OHKO Ferroseed after one layer of Spikes and a guaranteed 2HKO on non-Eviolite Magnemite and Pawniard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment is required to make Alolan Grimer hit as hard as possible. The leftover EVs are dumped into its defensive stats because it doesn't need Speed at all; they guarantee that Alolan Grimer is never 2HKOed by Life Orb Abra's Dazzling Gleam and, for Eviolite variants, never OHKOed by Jolly Focus Sash Diglett's Earthquake. Eviolite is the prime item of choice because it boosts Alolan Grimer's defenses to let it take hits better. Berry Juice, on the other hand, lengthens its lifespan, since it lacks any form of recovery. An alternative EV spread of 36 HP / 196 Atk / 36 Def / 196 SpD lets Alolan Grimer check Abra and Gastly more reliably but sacrifices some needed physical bulk, while a spread of 36 HP / 36 Atk / 196 Def / 196 SpD grants better mixed bulk to avoid most OHKOs but at the cost of significant offensive presence.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Alolan Grimer should spam Knock Off most of the time because it is a powerful STAB move with great utility and a good chance of poisoning; it should use Knock Off even if a Fairy-type such as Snubbull is switching in because removing its item helps with punishing it with Poison Jab or Gunk Shot later. Knock Off is also a good source of chip damage, increasing the chances to OHKO foes with Poison Jab. Pursuit severely dents fleeing foes, and the added bonus of possibly poisoning them is very useful because it deals some chip damage. Alolan Grimer should be sent in on Pokemon it can Pursuit trap, such as Abra and Gastly, because it can survive most hits and KO them back. Alolan Grimer is able to survive most powerful hits thanks to its typing and its bulk; however, keep in mind that it lacks a solid form of recovery besides Berry Juice. Finally, be wary of Volt Switch or U-turn users that can bring Diglett in, as Alolan Grimer is very vulnerable to it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Alolan Grimer can pair well with the majority of setup sweepers of the tier: Nasty Plot Vullaby is an exceptional partner and forms a Dark-type core with Alolan Grimer. Vullaby appreciates Alolan Grimer's Knock Off and ability to remove Fairy-types thanks to its Poison typing; on the other hand, Alolan Grimer loves Vullaby's ability to switch into Ground-type moves. Shell Smash Tirtouga pairs well with Alolan Grimer because it can remove opposing Eviolites and check Grass-types; in exchange, Tirtouga checks some Ground-types and picks off Diglett when its Focus Sash has been broken. Alolan Grimer struggles a lot against Ground-types such as Diglett, Mudbray, and Hippopotas because they can KO it; powerful attackers with access to priority moves, such as Dragon Dance Corphish and Carvanha, make for great partners, picking off Diglett and severely denting Mudbray and Hippopotas. Cleric support is deeply appreciated because Alolan Grimer doesn't have a solid form of recovery besides Berry Juice and suffers from burns: Spritzee can be a good partner, providing both Wish and Aromatherapy support to heal Alolan Grimer; Snubbull can weaken physical attacks that target Alolan Grimer thanks to Intimidate and provide Heal Bell support to remove burns; Z-Memento Cottonee can restore Alolan Grimer's health when it is low, soften an opposing sweeper, and also take on the Ground-types that Alolan Grimer hates. Fighting-types appreciate Alolan Grimer as a Psychic-, Ghost-, and Fairy-type check; Timburr, Mienfoo, and Pancham pair well with it, removing the Steel-types that check it. Finally, Grass-types such as Foongus and Pumpkaboo-XL can check the Ground-types that threaten Alolan Grimer.</p>"
      },
      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rest is Alolan Grimer's form of recovery, fully restoring its HP and removing status ailments. Sleep Talk allows Alolan Grimer to attack while sleeping and turns it into a good Spore absorber. Knock Off is a must, as it is a STAB move that removes items such as Eviolite and Choice Scarf, and it also has a chance of poisoning thanks to Poison Touch. Poison Jab is Alolan Grimer's secondary STAB move, boasting an impressive 51% chance of poisoning the target while also hitting Fairy-types super effectively. On the other hand, Gunk Shot has a lower chance of poisoning than Poison Jab but packs more power; it can OHKO standard Spritzee after Stealth Rock and non-Eviolite Snubbull at -1 Attack while having a small chance to OHKO Eviolite Snubbull.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>196 EVs in Attack and an Adamant nature make Alolan Grimer hit very hard, reaching 18 Attack. Eviolite boosts Alolan Grimer's defenses: with this item, it has a good chance to survive an Earthquake from Jolly Life Orb Diglett while always surviving one from the Focus Sash variant; with its Special Defense, it has a very small chance of being 3HKOed by Focus Sash Abra's Dazzling Gleam while never being 2HKOed by the Life Orb variant. Poison Touch is Alolan Grimer's best ability because it can poison foes when making contact, which complements Poison Jab very well. An EV spread of 36 HP / 196 Atk / 36 Def / 36 SpA / 196 SpD lets Alolan Grimer check Abra and Gastly more reliably but loses some needed physical bulk; alternatively, a spread of 36 HP / 36 Atk / 196 Def / 36 SpA / 196 SpD grants better mixed bulk to avoid most OHKOs but at the cost of significant offensive presence.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Unlike the Pursuit trap set, this Alolan Grimer set can last longer with less support, as it can heal itself with Rest. Knock Off is the move to spam the most because it removes foes' items and has a good chance of poisoning. Alolan Grimer should enter the field on a move it resists or is immune to, such as Psychic- or Grass-type moves, because even though this set is quite bulky, it dislikes taking too much damage. It can come in on Psychic-types like Abra, Grass-types like Foongus and Pumpkaboo-XL, Ghost-types like Gastly, and Fairy-types like Spritzee. Thanks to Sleep Talk, Alolan Grimer can come in on Foongus and Morelull to absorb Spore; Foongus has nothing to threaten Alolan Grimer with, while Morelull is outsped and OHKOed by Alolan Grimer's Poison-type STAB move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Even though Alolan Grimer can tank powerful hits, it has issues against Ground-types such as Mudbray and Diglett. This makes strong Water-type attackers with access to priority moves, such as Dragon Dance Corphish and Carvanha, great partners because they can pick off Diglett and severely hurt Mudbray. Entry hazard setters pair well with Alolan Grimer because it appreciates the chip damage provided by Stealth Rock and Spikes; defensive Tirtouga can set up Stealth Rock and, to a lesser extent, threaten Diglett with Aqua Jet; Ferroseed can set up Stealth Rock and Spikes; and Drilbur can set up Stealth Rock and remove entry hazards from Alolan Grimer's side of the field with Rapid Spin, while Alolan Grimer checks Grass-types for Drilbur. This Alolan Grimer variant depends less on Wish support than the Pursuit trap set, but a cleric can be used to heal Alolan Grimer when it is aslee or unable to use Rest; Spritzee or Snubbull can fill this role well. Grass-types can alleviate its weakness to Ground-type moves, making Pumpkaboo-XL and Foongus good teammates.</p>"

  "Shellder": {
    "overview": "<p>Possessing immense physical bulk and passable Speed and Attack, Shellder has the right traits to pull off a successful Shell Smash set. Being a pure Water-type is also beneficial for Shellder, not only giving it a great number of setup opportunities but also making it neutral or resistant to all priority attacks. Additionally, Skill Link gives Shellder an edge over most other Shell Smash users, as it allows Shellder to circumvent Focus Sash Abra without giving up an important coverage move. Skill Link has some interesting quirks in LC, making Icicle Spear and Rock Blast hit far harder than their already impressive 125 Base Power would imply. However, Shellder heavily relies on Shell Smash to become a threat and can hardly afford not to run the move.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shellder has a few other options, though most are not worthwhile. Choice Scarf Shellder is one such example, but it lacks a niche due to Life Orb Staryu and Alolan Sandshrew being better fast Rapid Spin users. Choice Scarf Shellder may potentially catch a few Pokemon by surprise and revenge kill Pokemon behind Substitutes, but beyond this, its uses are limited. Staryu and Alolan Sandshrew also outclass a bulky Rapid Spin set, as both are able to KO Pumpkaboo attempting to spinblock, and, unlike them, Shellder struggles to switch into attacks. Shellder can use Rapid Spin as its fourth move on the Shell Smash set for role compression, but it necessitates a lot of support and is seldom worthwhile. Hidden Power Fighting can also be viable as the fourth attack, though it messes up Shellder's EV spread and leaves Shellder walled by some Mudbray sets with the only benefit being reliably KOing Pawniard and Magnemite. Hydro Pump is a decent option, KOing Mudbray if it switches into Rock Blast and doing more damage to Pawniard; however, it tends to miss at unideal times. Life Orb Shellder is the most viable other option at Shellder's disposal, though it requires Memento support to set up and its largest upsides are seldom useful unless Knock Off support cannot be afforded.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Slowpoke</strong>: Slowpoke survives any attack from even a boosted Shellder and stays healthy easily between Regenerator and Slack Off. Slowpoke is Shellder's largest issue, as even wearing it down is not enough thanks to Regenerator allowing for Slowpoke to switch in and heal at will.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Eviolite Spritzee proves to be an issue due to its massive bulk, but it cannot be hit by Knock Off lest a +2 Icicle Spear KO it. Similarly, Berry Juice Tirtouga and Chinchou can survive any one attack from +2 Shellder. Ferroseed is also able to defeat a boosted Shellder, though it needs to keep its HP high. Croagunk, while not especially bulky, is able to revenge kill with Vacuum Wave and can switch in on Liquidation or Rock Blast.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users with 18 Speed</strong>: 18 Speed Pokemon holding a Choice Scarf such as Gastly and Doduo are able to outspeed Shellder even after it has boosted, exploit its lowered defenses, and usually OHKO even from full health.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Shellder relies on being at +2 to secure KOs, making the likes of Snubbull and other Intimidate users problematic.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Liquidation is more than enough to handle a Magnemite set lacking Endure, but Endure + Recycle sets can be an issue. Similarly, Liquidation only KOes weakened Pawniard, so if kept healthy Pawniard is an adequate counter. Pawniard's Sucker Punch is threatening to Shellder as well, forcing weakened Shellder to try to avoid the priority attack. Honedge and Bronzor are bulky enough to also take little from Liquidation and therefore make good counters.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "SMASHING": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash makes Shellder super threatening, doubling both its Speed and its Attack. Icicle Spear and Rock Blast benefit from Skill Link, changing them from subpar attacks into Shellder's best offensive moves. Multi-hit attacks have some weird mechanics in LC, causing them to hit especially hard and be stronger than any of Shellder's STAB attacks. Moreover, Ice and Rock coverage is overall excellent, missing only Steel-types. Between just these two attacks, Shellder is truly an offensive threat and among the best sweepers in the tier. Liquidation is used to OHKO Mudbray and most Steel-types easily. Ice Shard can be run instead, primarily to KO Doduo and Diglett before they can use their strong priority options to revenge kill a weakened Shellder; however, Liquidation is generally better, as it makes Shellder far harder to wall.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Skill Link is what makes Shellder so deadly, guaranteeing its multi-hit moves always hit five times, thus dealing the most possible damage. In LC, multi-hit moves are even more powerful than their Base Power would indicate thanks to the intricacies of the damage formula, giving Shellder amazing power. Shellder opts for an Impish nature over an Adamant one in favor of increasing its Defense to improve its survivability and setup capabilities, which are further bolstered by an Eviolite. The Attack investment without a boosting nature is more than adequate anyway, as +2 Icicle Spear and Rock Blast have the same damage rolls as they would with an Adamant nature. The Speed investment allows +2 Impish Shellder to outspeed 17 Speed Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Mienfoo. A Jolly nature is also viable to allow Shellder to outspeed Scarf Doduo and Gastly after Shell Smash. The remaining EVs are invested into HP to give Shellder slightly better bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As with any sweeper, Shellder's checks need to be weakened before it can sweep. Some troubling Pokemon need to be scouted for, such as Chinchou and Tirtouga, as Berry Juice variants check Shellder while other variants do not. Otherwise, using Shellder is rather straightforward: set up on a physical attacker, avoid setting up on a status user, and proceed to sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Memento users, especially Cottonee and Diglett, pair well with Shellder, often giving it amazing setup chances and helping to keep it healthy enough to avoid being revenge killed. Diglett is also able to trap and weaken troubling Pokemon such as Chinchou and potentially Pawniard, while Cottonee is able to provide more utility through Knock Off support and act as a defensive pivot. Knock Off users are pretty good Pokemon to pair with Shellder too, as they remove Eviolites from the bulkiest Pokemon in the tier, allowing Shellder to blast through them. Vullaby is a great Knock Off user and is excellent at breaking down a number of checks it has in common with Shellder. Mienfoo and Timburr also pair well with Shellder, as they use Knock Off to remove Eviolites from some troubling Pokemon. More importantly, both are able to lure and exploit Croagunk and Snubbull, potentially removing one to make Shellder's sweep easier. Magnet Pull Magnemite is a decent partner that allows Shellder to drop Liquidation and run Ice Shard to prevent being revenge killed. Abra with Knock Off and Shadow Ball is a good wallbreaker for Shellder, as the set lures and beats Slowpoke and Honedge, two of the better, though uncommon, counters to Shellder. Lastly, Stealth Rock support is a necessity, making most reliable Stealth Rock users a good pairing. Hippopotas, Onix, and Pawniard are particularly good teammates due to helping fend off Electric-types and being the most reliable Stealth Rock users available.</p>"

  "Gastly": {
    "overview": "<p>Gastly is a fantastic Pokemon in the LC metagame thanks to its very good Speed stat, which allows it to offensively check tier titans such as fast Mienfoo and Snivy, and its top-tier Special Attack stat, which allows it to put enormous pressure on teams and reliably break down opposing walls. Its movepool leaves it with a plethora of coverage options that make it extremely difficult to switch into, and even includes reliable support moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Destiny Bond. Gastly's Ghost typing also comes with significant advantages, giving it an immunity to Fighting-type priority moves and allowing it to act as a risky spinblocker for hyper offensive teams. However, Gastly's poor defensive stats and weakness to the common Dark-type leave it prone to being taken out by anything it doesn't KO.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gastly has access to several other coverage options such as Giga Drain which can be run on any set, but generally are only useful against specific Pokemon. Hidden Power Ground is especially notable, as it allows Gastly to lure in some of its typical checks, such as Alolan Grimer, Pawniard, and Stunky, and deal significant damage. Venoshock can be run on teams with a reliable method of poisoning the foe, such as Toxic Spikes, to give Gastly a move with much higher Base Power than Sludge Bomb. Taunt is an option with Berry Juice to prevent Gastly from being set up on by Pokemon it does not KO, but Gastly would usually rather either run a coverage move to hit these Pokemon or switch out. Ghostium Z can be used to boost the power of Shadow Ball, but Gastly sorely misses out on Life Orb's consistent power. Lastly, Knock Off can be used to lure in bulkier Pokemon and remove their items, but Gastly has all the wallbreaking potential it will generally need with just the standard sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Alolan Grimer and Stunky</strong>: Both Alolan Grimer and Stunky resist Gastly's STAB moves, have the bulk to handle any coverage move effectively, and remove Gastly from the battle with Pursuit. Hex variants are more difficult to trap, since Gastly can burn and escape from battle, but Stunky and Grimer will still be able to reliably counter it later in the battle.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Gastly is very susceptible to priority, including Aqua Jet from Carvanha and Corphish and Sucker Punch from Pawniard and Croagunk.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to its enormous wallbreaking potential, the best way for offensive teams to handle Gastly is to revenge kill it. Pokemon with 19 Speed, such as Abra and Staryu, can outspeed and KO Gastly, as can Choice Scarf users such as Pawniard, which can trap Gastly with Pursuit. However, these Pokemon need to be wary of a surprise Choice Scarf Gastly, which will outspeed most other Choice Scarf Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Extremely specially bulky Pokemon are required to handle Gastly defensively. Munchlax, Lickitung, Ferroseed, and Lileep all tank any hit from Gastly, but still take significant damage in doing so. None of them like being poisoned, either (with the exception of Ferroseed), so switching into a Sludge Bomb can cripple them.</p> <p><strong>Bulletproof Users</strong>: Chespin and Jangmo-o get an honorable mention as Gastly counters, as they both have the ability Bulletproof, making them completely immune to both Shadow Ball and Sludge Bomb. However, both are generally useless otherwise and can become dead weight on teams. They also do not check the Hex set particularly well.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shadow Ball and Sludge Bomb are powerful STAB moves, especially when boosted by Life Orb, and can hit most of what doesn't resist them for solid damage. Gastly can choose to run either Hidden Power Fighting or Dazzling Gleam in the third moveslot to deal with Dark-types. Hidden Power Fighting hits Pawniard, which resists both of Gastly's STAB moves, for more damage, while Dazzling Gleam is more powerful against Vullaby. Psychic lets Gastly OHKO frailer variants of Eviolite Mienfoo more often than not, as well as consistently 2HKO Mareanie and OHKO Croagunk. Substitute allows Gastly to take advantage of the switches it forces, avoid stray status moves, and force Pawniard into mind games with Sucker Punch. Destiny Bond can be used instead to take advantage of Gastly's Speed to take out an opposing Pokemon when it is knocked out and still somewhat force Pawniard into mind games. Sucker Punch can be run as a surprise fourth move to take out opposing Gastly and Abra as well as severely weakened Pokemon that aim to revenge kill it, but Gastly's Attack stat is too low to make use of it otherwise.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread on this set is simple, maximizing Gastly's Special Attack and Speed to allow it to hit as hard as possible and outspeed most of the metagame with a Timid nature, including Pokemon such as Mienfoo, Archen, and Drilbur, while Speed tying with Doduo. The remaining EVs go into Special Defense instead of HP to provide 19 HP, which minimizes both Life Orb recoil damage and the amount of HP it takes to make a Substitute. If Hidden Power Fighting isn't run, an EV spread of 36 Def / 196 SpA / 76 SpD / 196 Spe should be used instead. A Life Orb boosts Gastly's wallbreaking potential, assisted by Gastly's naturally high Special Attack stat.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Gastly set is fairly easy to use, working as a strong wallbreaker that uses its power and coverage to break down opposing teams. Gastly should avoid taking hits as much as it can, as it has low defenses. This means that generally Gastly should only be attacking when it can KO a Pokemon, which will be often due to its power. Scouting for opposing Choice Scarf users is important early in a match to ensure that Gastly isn't taken by surprise and revenge killed. Substitute should be used against opposing Sucker Punch users to force them into mind games until Gastly can get up a free Substitute and then attack. Be cautious when playing against Pursuit users, as they can come in and prevent Gastly from switching out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As with all wallbreakers, Gastly appreciates entry hazard support to break down opposing teams, with Omanyte, Pineco, and Dwebble all performing this role appropriately. Gastly can also spinblock for these Pokemon to support teammates that also take advantage of entry hazards. Fighting-types, such as Timburr, Croagunk, and Mienfoo, make fantastic partners due to their ability to use Knock Off to wear down defensive Pokemon, their ability to check bulky Normal- and Dark-types, and their potential to lure in Fairy-types that Gastly easily deals with. Offensive Ground-type Pokemon, including Drilbur, Mudbray, and Diglett, can take advantage of the Pokemon Gastly lures in, including Alolan Grimer, Pawniard, and Stunky. Other fast special attackers, including Elekid and Abra, put pressure on the same Pokemon that Gastly does, making them good partners to wear down these Pokemon to allow for a sweep. Pokemon that can give Gastly a free switch into the battle also make good partners, including slow pivots such as Mienfoo and U-turn Vullaby. Pursuit trappers, including Pawniard, Alolan Grimer, and Munchlax, work well due to their ability to eliminate Abra, which is a threat to this set.</p>"
      },
      "Hex": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hex becomes an extremely powerful STAB move for Gastly if the opponent has been inflicted with a status ailment. Will-O-Wisp allows Gastly to cripple physical attackers that come in hoping to check it and boosts Hex's power. Substitute allows Gastly to capitalize on the switches it forces, force Sucker Punch Pawniard into mind games, and avoid the occasional status move from the likes of Foongus. Sludge Bomb gives Gastly a Poison-type STAB move and allows it to function as a powerful Fairy-type check. Dazzling Gleam and Hidden Power Fighting are options to hit the various Dark-type Pokemon that Gastly lures in, but Hex will usually hit them harder after a burn than either of these moves. Disable in conjunction with Substitute allows Gastly to take on most of the tier's Fighting-types one-on-one by Disabling their Knock Off and switch out more easily against Pursuit users.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Gastly is given a very diverse EV spread. 196 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Gastly to reach 18 Speed, making it one of the faster Will-O-Wisp users in the tier and allowing it to safely attack teams without taking hits. 116 Special Attack EVs boost Gastly's Special Attack to a level where it can threaten opposing teams with Hex. The remaining EVs give Gastly enough bulk to take a Pursuit or a Knock Off after it consumes Berry Juice from any Dark-type in the metagame, and provides a chance for Foongus's Giga Drain to not break its substitute. Berry Juice allows Gastly to regenerate its health once in a battle, giving it a certain measure of longevity and the ability to use Substitute more times.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gastly should nearly always avoid switching into attacks, as most defensive Pokemon can cripple it with status moves and offensive Pokemon easily take advantage of its poor defenses. Gastly should use Will-O-Wisp to spread burns as much as possible, especially to cripple Dark-type attackers that are switching in, which allows Gastly to switch out without being KOed by Pursuit if necessary. Gastly can then use Hex or its coverage moves to act as a powerful wallbreaker. Gastly usually does not want to take even burn-weakened attacks, so stay on the attack when you know Gastly will deal significant damage. Substitute should be used to ease prediction when Gastly will force a switch, against Pokemon reliant on status moves such as Foongus, and to activate Berry Juice if Gastly needs to be at full health to take a hit. If running Disable, Gastly can use Substitute against Pokemon that rely on Knock Off or Pursuit to deal with it, especially Fighting-type Pokemon that cannot hit Gastly without Knock Off, and then Disable to gain a free turn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Toxic Spikes works extremely well in conjunction with Hex Gastly, allowing it to fire off powerful Hexes without having to rely on Will-O-Wisp. Pokemon such as Mareanie, Skrelp, and Trubbish can set up Toxic Spikes effectively and check the Fighting-types that can hit Gastly with Knock Off. Other forms of entry hazards, which can be set by the likes of Omanyte and Dwebble, also help Gastly wear down opposing teams, and Gastly acts as a spinblocker to keep the hazards its teammates set up. Pokemon that can handle Knock Off users are essential if Gastly is not using Disable, which makes Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr good partners. These Pokemon can also handle specially bulky Pokemon such as Munchlax that counter Gastly. Mienfoo also makes a good slow pivot, which works well with Gastly because of its ability to bring Gastly in safely and gain momentum. Other slow pivots work well with Gastly, including Chinchou and U-turn Vullaby. Opposing Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon can check Gastly offensively, so Pursuit users, including Pawniard, Alolan Grimer, and Stunky, make good partners.</p>"
      },
      "Lure": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dazzling Gleam is an excellent coverage move for Gastly, hitting Fighting- and Dark-types quite hard. However, the main function of Dazzling Gleam on this set is to give Gastly access to Twinkle Tackle, a powerful Z-Move that OHKOes Mienfoo, certain Timburr sets, and Vullaby after Stealth Rock damage. Thunder can be used instead to give Gastly a good chance to beat Alolan Grimer switchins in addition to taking out Vullaby. Sludge Bomb and Shadow Ball are powerful STAB attacks with good coverage, especially against foes such as Snivy, Spritzee, and Pumpkaboo-XL. Substitute helps Gastly protect itself from a single move, lets it avoid Sucker Punch and status moves such as Foongus's Spore, and lets Gastly avoid having to predict a switch. Hidden Power Fighting can also be used to hit Pawniard, a Pokemon that otherwise walls Gastly.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Fairium Z lets Gastly use Twinkle Tackle to surprise some of its checks, such as Vullaby, Mienfoo, and Timburr, and deal heavy damage. A Timid nature and 196 Speed EVs are used to maximize Gastly's Speed and let it outspeed Mienfoo, Snivy, and Cottonee. 196 Special Attack EVs let Gastly do a fair amount of damage. The rest of Gastly's EVs are put into its defenses to let it survive for as long as possible. Levitate gives Gastly an immunity to Ground-types moves, allowing it to switch in slightly easier against certain Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Mudbray and Hippopotas. If using Hidden Power Fighting, Gastly should use an EV spread of 40 Def / 200 SpA / 200 Spe to maximize Special Attack and Speed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>To properly utilize Twinkle Tackle, it is a good idea to try and bait in threats Gastly can KO with it, namely Timburr, Mienfoo, and Vullaby. Before doing this, however, it is usually best to scout how your opponent will react to Gastly, as Twinkle Tackle can only be used once per battle. This usually consists of checking what usually switches into Gastly and what moves said Pokemon usually uses. It's best not to attack before using Twinkle Tackle, as this would reveal that Gastly lacks a Life Orb, leading your opponent to most likely believe it is either Choice Scarf or Fairium Z. This is especially important if the opponent has something Gastly can lure in. Don't be afraid to attack afterwards, however, as Gastly can still do a lot without the element of surprise. Due to Gastly's low bulk, it is generally good to not switch Gastly into unresisted attacks, and it's preferred to get Gastly in through a U-turn or Volt Switch or after one of its teammates has fallen. Substitute should be used on a predicted switch and against Sucker Punch users to safely protect Gastly. It can also be used to avoid status from certain Pokemon such as Spore Foongus. Be sure to always avoid being in against Pursuit trappers, such as Alolan Grimer. It is also best that Gastly is only used when it can ensure a KO on a foe, as it is too frail to take nearly any damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Note that Twinkle Tackle Gastly should be used on teams that appreciate a lure to Timburr, Mienfoo, or Vullaby, as if teams don't need this, Life Orb Gastly would work better. Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Fighting-types and Vullaby, such as Scraggy and Carvanha, appreciate Gastly's ability to lure in and KO said threats. Abra in particular appreciates Twinkle Tackle's ability to remove Vullaby and severely weaken Alolan Grimer and Pawniard. Gastly greatly appreciates Stealth Rock support from setters such as Pawniard, Ferroseed, Onix, and Dwebble to help it break through more Pokemon, and in return, Gastly can block Rapid Spin for them. Fighting-types, namely Mienfoo and Timburr, are very useful to help Gastly beat Dark-types, Pawniard in particular, as well as many using Knock Off to cripple foes, and Gastly can deal with Fairy-types in return. Slow pivots, namely Mienfoo, Chinchou, and Vullaby, can help Gastly get onto the field without taking any damage from attacks.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shadow Ball and Sludge Bomb are solid STAB moves for Gastly, and Sludge Bomb comes with a chance to poison. Thunderbolt allows Gastly to hit Water-type Pokemon for super effective damage, most notably OHKOing Shellder and Omanyte, the latter after a Shell Smash boost. It also does significant damage to Vullaby, coming close to a KO after Stealth Rock damage. Dazzling Gleam allows Gastly to take out opposing Scraggy, which Gastly can deal with even after a Dragon Dance boost due to its Choice Scarf, and deal significant damage to Vullaby. Alternatively, Trick allows Gastly to lock an opposing Pokemon into a status or setup move, ideally giving a teammate a chance to set up. Hidden Power Fighting can be used to hit Pawniard on the switch in.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Gastly's Special Attack and Speed while giving a point each to Defense and Special Defense. If Hidden Power Fighting is run, Gastly should use a spread of 200 SpA / 80 SpD / 200 Spe to make up for the IV drop. With maximum Speed investment, a Timid nature, and a Choice Scarf, Gastly hits 27 Speed, which allows it to reliably revenge kill nearly the entire metagame, most notably making it one of the only Pokemon to outspeed Shell Smash users.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Gastly set is designed to be used as a revenge killer that acts as a safety net for hyper offensive teams that are weak to certain setup Pokemon. As such, Gastly should be used as a revenge killer preserved to handle said Pokemon, and not switched into any attacks. If it is run, Trick should be used at any point in a match when Gastly's Choice Scarf is no longer needed in order to cripple a defensive Pokemon. Be aware that Choice Scarf Gastly doesn't have the immediate offensive potential of the Life Orb set, so it is far less effective at dealing with bulky Pokemon. However, when an opposing team has been worn down, Choice Scarf Gastly can function as an effective cleanup Pokemon in the late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Gastly is designed for extremely offensive teams that need a last-ditch counter to setup sweepers. As such, it is a given that Gastly's team should provide it with entry hazard support, which allows it to put more pressure on opposing Pokemon. Dark-type Pokemon work well as partners for this set, as they are able to Knock Off opponents and set up on the Pokemon that come in on Gastly. Scraggy and either Nasty Plot or Z-Mirror Move Vullaby make good partners because of this. Fighting-type Pokemon, including Timburr and Mienfoo, also make good partners, as they are able to come in on the Dark-type Pokemon that Gastly has trouble breaking past and remove them.</p>"

  "Onix": {
    "overview": "<p>Onix is arguably the best Stealth Rock user in Little Cup, and for very good reason. Its ability Sturdy essentially guarantees that it sets up Stealth Rock and helps give it multiple chances to do so. It also has the highest Defense stat in the tier by far, although it struggles to utilize it due to its abysmal defensive typing that gives it many weaknesses and a vulnerability to entry hazards, which can cripple it extremely.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Roar allows Onix to check setup sweepers quite well, as well as spread Stealth Rock chip damage. Dragon Tail and Roar are similar in the sense that they phaze out problematic Pokemon, but Dragon Tail fails to phaze out Calm Mind Spritzee. A Curse set can take advantage of Onix's sky-high Defense, but its abysmal Special Defense makes this essentially pointless. Heavy Slam can be used to hit Fairy-types, but it usually just takes away an important moveslot, and the coverage isn't really necessary. Stone Edge can be used over Rock Blast, but this detracts from Onix's ability to beat Surskit and Dwebble.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Most Ground-types can beat Onix, but Drilbur and Mudbray stand out in particular. Drilbur can Rapid Spin away Onix's entry hazards and, thanks to Mold Breaker, OHKO Onix through Sturdy, completely shutting it down. Mudbray can switch into Rock Blast to quickly rack up Defense boosts; from there, Onix can do essentially nothing. Mudbray can also cause Onix to flinch with Rock Slide, nullifying both its Sturdy and its next move. Sandshrew, although not as much of an issue, can be annoying with Knock Off, Rapid Spin, and its own Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Multi-hit Moves</strong>: Multi-hit moves from Ferroseed and Shellder can be devastating and completely shut down Onix's strategy. There isn't really a way it can work around them, either.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Most Fighting-types utilize Drain Punch, which can usually out-heal Onix's damage and will make quick work of its Sturdy. Mienfoo in particular commonly uses U-turn, which can break Onix's Sturdy and, therefore, make it completely useless.</p> <p><strong>Staryu</strong>: Staryu is Onix's best counter, as it can clear away its entry hazards and use Scald to waste its Sturdy and Berry Juice. Onix can also deal very little damage to Staryu, as Staryu is quite bulky.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Foongus and Pumpkaboo can switch into any of Onix's moves without fear. Pumpkaboo can also use Bullet Seed to have a good chance to defeat Onix in one move. Cottonee and Snivy can also switch in but are slightly worse checks.</p>",

      "SturdyJuice": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock can help break opposing Sturdy Pokemon and pave the way for a sweep from a powerful Pokemon such as Omanyte or Scraggy. Rock Blast is a good general Rock-type STAB move and is useful for defeating opposing Berry Juice users, Archen and Dwebble in particular, as well as Weak Armor Vullaby. Earthquake is Onix's Ground-type STAB move, is very powerful, and is just generally good with its 100% accuracy. Endure is useful to activate Berry Juice and regain Sturdy if Onix has initially taken damage from hazards or weak attacks. Taunt is an acceptable option to prevent opposing entry hazard setters from doing their job.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Onix has a Jolly nature and maximum Speed investment so it can get 17 Speed, letting it Speed tie with many common threats in LC such as Mienfoo and Snivy as well as Taunt Dwebble. The rest of its EVs are put into Attack and HP; the former gives Onix extra attacking power, and the latter gives it maximum recovery from Berry Juice. Sturdy helps Onix take any one attack when at full HP and, can be very annoying to deal with in conjunction with Berry Juice.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Onix works as an amazing lead due to its ability Sturdy against other leads such as Dwebble. With a drop in Mienfoo leads, it has become even better. Treating Onix as just a suicide lead is never a good idea, however, as it can be useful in all stages of the game. Onix can also be conserved for stopping common sweepers such as Omanyte and Zigzagoon late-game, but your team should usually already have a check for these, and Onix should only be used if all other checks are gone. Keeping Sturdy intact is usually useful, but Onix can be a good switch-in to many Flying- and Electric-types.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Onix is perfect for teams that can't fit an entry hazard setter normally due to its Sturdy and Speed stat. Onix can help check Flying- and Electric-types for Pokemon such as Carvanha and Snivy. Pumpkaboo makes for a great partner for Onix, as it blocks Rapid Spin and checks the Water- and Grass-types that Onix struggles with. Any Pokemon that checks Water- and Grass-types, specifically Staryu and Ferroseed, makes for a good teammate for Onix. Staryu itself can also make a great partner, as it can clear away entry hazards and check Water-, and to some extent, Fighting-types.</p>"
      },
      "Weak Armor": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is a powerful entry hazard that does chip damage to all switch-ins and breaks Sturdy on opposing threats such as Magnemite. Rock Blast usually does more damage than Stone Edge due to the way multi-hit moves work in LC and also works very well against foes with Weak Armor, such as Vullaby. Earthquake is a powerful secondary STAB option that gets almost perfect neutral coverage with Rock Blast. Explosion can be used as a suicide attack to heavily damage a single threat, while Protect is useful to scout Choice Scarf users, notably Magnemite, and deter High Jump Kick from Mienfoo. Taunt shuts down opposing walls, setup sweepers, and hazard setters.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread with a Jolly nature maximizes Onix's Attack and allows it to outspeed key threats such as Pawniard and Dwebble. The HP investment lets it survive Reckless Mienfoo's High Jump Kick and Diglett's Tectonic Rage from full health. Weak Armor doubles Onix's Speed whenever it is hit by a physical attack, which pairs well with its titanic Defense stat, and Eviolite boosts Onix's defenses even further.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Although Weak Armor Onix appears very similar to the Sturdy set at first glance, the two sets play very differently from each other. This set is one of the best answers to Flying-types in the metagame thanks to its typing and massive Defense stat; do not be afraid to freely switch Onix into the likes of Vullaby and Doduo. Take advantage of the Speed boost Weak Armor can provide to revenge kill opposing sweepers such as Shell Smash Dwebble, set up an emergency Stealth Rock, or take out a threat with Explosion. With prediction, this set can even beat a slightly weakened Staryu by staying in on a predicted Rapid Spin and using Earthquake twice.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Reliable switch-ins to Water-, Grass-, and Fighting-types, such as Foongus and Vullaby, are a necessity, as Onix is easily OHKOed by their STAB attacks. Pokemon that appreciate a reliable switch-in to Flying-types, such as Timburr, also make good partners. Because Staryu forms a potent core with Sturdy Onix, running it can potentially help bluff Onix's Sturdy set. Wish users such as Spritzee can provide added longevity, as Onix lacks recovery. Finally, offensive threats that appreciate Stealth Rock such as Shellder and Snivy work well on a team with Onix.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Insomnia is Drowzee's most attractive feature, which, when you add that into its average defensive stats, gives it a nice role as a Foongus and Abra counter. Having semi-reliable recovery in Wish lets Drowzee stick around longer to perform its duties multiple times and check some other threats as well. However, Drowzee doesn't hit particularly hard which invites offensive threats such as Snivy to set up on it, and its Psychic typing is relatively easy to counter.</p>",

However, it faces stiff competition from other physical Water-types in the tier such as Corphish and Totodile, as they have better movepools including ways to boost both Speed and Attack in Dragon Dance and a priority option in Aqua Jet, both of which Krabby lacks. These Pokemon also have better bulk, giving them an easier time setting up than Krabby, whose poor Special Defense grants it limited setup opportunities. This forces it to opt for a Choice Scarf revenge killer set to differentiate itself, which does not have a serious niche due to the limited value of Water as its sole STAB attacking type.</p>",

Because Voltorb has to hold an item other than Eviolite to most effectively set dual screens, its bulk is lacking, allowing it to be severely chipped away at by priority users such as Pawniard and Timburr and common Choice Scarf users such as such as Mienfoo and Magnemite and OHKOed by a majority of strong neutral STAB attacks. Light Screen and Reflect are also not particularly noteworthy as a team strategy, as Memento users such as Cottonee and Aurora Veil users such as Alolan Vulpix perform this role more consistently, leaving Voltorb virtually outclassed in every role it can perform.</p>",

  "Exeggcute": {
    "overview": "<p>Exeggcute has some potential as a support Pokemon in the LC metagame thanks to its great physical bulk and decent support movepool, which contains options such as Sleep Powder and Stun Spore. Its ability Harvest gives Exeggcute access to passive recovery when paired with an Oran Berry as long as Exeggcute is not hit by Knock Off. However, Exeggcute's typing, while not awful, leaves it vulnerable to a plethora of LC's most common attacking moves, such as U-turn, Knock Off, and Flying-type attacks. Due to its typing, Exeggcute will usually fail to check the physical attackers it aims to check because they carry a super effective coverage move. Exeggcute is further held back by poor Speed and Special Defense, which couple to make it easily taken out by special attackers. Finally, Exeggcute often relies on putting Pokemon to sleep to set up Substitute, which leaves it extremely reliant on Sleep Powder's relatively low accuracy. Due to these flaws, it is usually difficult to justify using Exeggcute over Foongus, which has a better typing, comparable bulk, and a more accurate sleep-inducing move. Exeggcute's niche lies in its good Defense stat, a resistance to common Ground-type attacks, and passive recovery.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Exeggcute can run Moonlight or Wish alongside Eviolite to become bulkier and less reliant on Harvest for recovery, but because Exeggcute's primary defensive niche is its access to passive recovery, it is rarely the optimal set for a team. Exeggcute also has access to Light Screen and Reflect, which it can use to support setup sweepers on its team, but Exeggcute has trouble setting dual screens due to its susceptibility to common faster Pokemon. Stun Spore is an option to support Exeggcute's teammates, but it is much less useful than running Sleep Powder or a coverage move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Vullaby, Alolan Grimer, and Pawniard resist or are immune to both of Exeggcute's STAB moves and can use Knock Off to disable its recovery. Vullaby sets that run Overcoat are immune to Sleep Powder, and Alolan Grimer can remove Exeggcute from a match with Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferroseed and Pawniard can wall Exeggcute depending on its choice of final move, and both can either set up entry hazards against it or use Knock Off to disable its recovery. Ferroseed is also immune to Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Faster attackers that carry super effective moves, such as Doduo, Ponyta, Gastly, and Larvesta, can easily OHKO Exeggcute, but they can rarely switch in for fear of Sleep Powder or an attack.</p>",

      "Harvest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute allows Exeggcute to take advantage of the switches it forces versus defensive Pokemon or the sleep turns it induces while often triggering Oran Berry recovery. Sleep Powder can be used on the switch or against slower foes to give Exeggcute turns to set up Substitute or wear down the foe. Alternatively, Leech Seed can be used to wear down foes or to force more switches, allowing Exeggcute to set up Substitute. Giga Drain is Exeggcute's main STAB move, and it can wear down sleeping foes while providing Exeggcute with recovery. The final moveslot can be used for Psychic, which hits Foongus and Fighting-type Pokemon hard, or for a coverage move such as Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Fighting, which deals damage to Ferroseed and Pawniard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Oran Berry is essential for this set, as it restores Exeggcute's HP when it falls below 50%. In conjunction with Harvest, which gives Exeggcute a 50% chance of recovering its Oran Berry every turn, Exeggcute will be fairly reliably healed whenever it falls below half HP. 120 Speed EVs and a Timid nature give Exeggcute 13 Speed, allowing it to outspeed almost every defensive Pokemon and some slow offensive Pokemon such as Timburr. The given defensive EVs ensure that Exeggcute is never 2HKOed by a variety of offensive Pokemon, including Mudbray, Diglett, and most Focus Sash Abra sets, when Oran Berry is taken into account. The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack to slightly boost Exeggcute's damage output.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Exeggcute performs best when it comes in against Pokemon that fail to 2HKO it so that it can use its support moves before using its Oran Berry. These include bulkier Water-types such as Staryu without Ice Beam and Chinchou, Abra without Shadow Ball, Ground- and Rock- type Pokemon like Mudbray, Onix, and Drilbur, and weaker Electric-types such as Elekid. From there, Exeggcute should use its almost limitless recovery to set up Substitute, put foes to sleep, and chip away at their health from behind a Substitute. Keep in mind that Pokemon that can OHKO Exeggcute are abundant -- if an opposing Pokemon with OHKO potential is switching in, Exeggcute should put it to sleep, set up a Substitute, or simply be switched out. Under no circumstances should you allow Exeggcute to be hit by Knock Off, as not only will it deal quite a bit of damage as a super effective attack, but it will also remove Exeggcute's ability to heal itself.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock users help Exeggcute chip away at the opposition. Onix is one of the metagame's best Stealth Rock users and has terrific type synergy with Exeggcute, taking care of Flying- and Fire-type Pokemon that threaten Exeggcute while Exeggcute handles Water- and Grass-types. Steel-types wall many Exeggcute variants, so Fighting-types, such as Mienfoo and Timburr, or trappers, such as Diglett and Magnet Pull Magnemite, synergize well with Exeggcute as well. Magnemite has the added benefit of good type synergy with Exeggcute. Finally, Pokemon weak to Water-, Ground-, and Psychic-type attacks partner well with Exeggcute, which can consistently switch into these attacks over the course of a match. Ponyta, Croagunk, Mudbray, and Archen, among others, appreciate Exeggcute's ability to check these Pokemon.</p>"

  "Cubone": {
    "overview": "<p>Cubone is one of the hardest hitters in Little Cup thanks to its Thick Club-doubled Attack. It also has a unique and powerful STAB attack in Bonemerang, which hits twice and thus can break Focus Sash and Sturdy. Combine that with its great physical bulk and good coverage options in Knock Off and Rock Slide, and you've got one powerful wallbreaker. Unfortunately, Cubone is really easy to take advantage of due to its poor Speed and special bulk, therefore requiring a lot of support from teammates to effectively sweep. It also faces competition from Mudbray, which isn't as strong as Cubone but is faster and bulkier. Lastly, Cubone is extremely vulnerable to Knock Off due to its reliance on Thick Club to deal any sufficient damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swords Dance can turn Cubone into an even more threatening offensive Pokemon, but considering it already gets a massive boost from Thick Club, it's less valuable than coverage. Cubone can function on Trick Room teams with a bulkier EV spread, 0 Speed IVs, and a Brave nature, but Trick Room isn't that viable to begin with, since it lasts for a limited number of turns. Bone Rush can be used for a chance at doing more damage, but it's unreliable compared to Bonemerang due to its reliance on hitting the foe at least four times. Finally, Substitute can be used to dodge Sucker Punch and Will-O-Wisp, but Cubone needs as much coverage as it can get in most cases.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Due to relying on Thick Club to deal any sufficient damage, Cubone is usually forced out by Knock Off users such as Vullaby and Pawniard; the latter cannot switch into Bonemerang, however.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Fast Pokemon like Abra can easily outspeed and KO Cubone before it can do anything. This can be mitigated somewhat through the use of Sticky Web, but Carvanha can get rid of the Speed drop via Speed Boost.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Even if Sticky Web is up, every Choice Scarf user in the tier will outspeed or Speed tie with Cubone. Cubone can get rid of these Choice Scarves with Knock Off, but it will usually be OHKOed before it can do so.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Thanks to not running Eviolite and having no priority of its own, Cubone is vulnerable to every priority attack in the tier. Carvanha's Aqua Jet and Snover's Ice Shard are the worst offenders because they hit Cubone super effectively, but Life Orb Pawniard also OHKOes Cubone with +2 Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Staryu, Chinchou, and Carvanha deal huge damage to Cubone with their super effective STAB attacks. Corphish is an incredibly big threat to Cubone, since it gets OHKOed by an Adaptability-boosted Life Orb Aqua Jet.</p>",

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bonemerang is Cubone's most powerful STAB attack that hits harder than Earthquake thanks to Little Cup's damage rolls and breaks Sturdy and Focus Sash. Knock Off removes Eviolite from defensive Pokemon like Spritzee and Hippopotas, crippling them by reducing their overall bulk. It also hits Pokemon like Gastly and Bronzor that are immune to Bonemerang. Rock Slide gives Cubone amazing coverage with Bonemerang, letting it score super effective hits on Flying-type Pokemon like Vullaby and Doduo. Lastly, Fire Punch allows Cubone to hit Ferroseed and other Grass-types that wall it otherwise.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>196 Attack EVs combined with Thick Club allow Cubone to act as an incredibly powerful wallbreaker. 236 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Cubone to outspeed Alolan Sandshrew and unboosted Shellder. The remaining EVs enhance Cubone's physical bulk, allowing it to better take physical attacks. Battle Armor is Cubone's best ability, providing it with the benefit of avoiding critical hits.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cubone is a very effective wallbreaker, since it can remove Eviolite from common defensive Pokemon and finish them off with Bonemerang or Rock Slide. Do not leave Cubone in against any Knock Off user unless you're sure it can outspeed and KO it; for example, Cubone cannot outspeed Choice Scarf Pawniard even with Sticky Web up, so it should definitely be switched out. Against Sturdy + Berry Juice users such as Onix, use Knock Off first to remove their recovery. Magnemite in particular can easily use Recycle to restore a consumed Berry Juice, but not one that has been removed by Knock Off. You can also sweep with Cubone, but a way to circumvent its low Speed is needed; therefore, sending it out with Sticky Web on the field is a good idea. Finally, due to Cubone's poor special bulk, bringing it in with a slow pivoting move is ideal to avoid prior damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Late-game cleaners like Shellder appreciate Cubone for its ability to break through common defensive Pokemon such as Spritzee and Mareanie with Bonemerang. Surskit can set up Sticky Web so Cubone can mitigate its poor Speed and outpace certain threats. If you are using Cubone on a Sticky Web team, Pumpkaboo-XL makes a good partner for its ability to block Rapid Spin. It also appreciates Cubone breaking Fire-type threats such as Ponyta. Fast offensive Pokemon like Carvanha help against the offensively inclined teams Cubone struggles against.</p>"

  "Lickitung": {
    "overview": "<p>Lickitung can check many offensive threats in the metagame, such as Abra, Magnemite, Bellsprout, and Gastly, due to its great defensive stats. Furthermore, Lickitung's bulk combined with its access to Wish and Heal Bell make it a great support Pokemon on balanced and defensive teams. Lickitung can also use its support and status moves against Taunt users due to Oblivious. However, Lickitung's typing lacks resistances, meaning it has to rely on its raw bulk and Eviolite when switching into powerful attacks. Furthermore, Lickitung's low Speed combined with its passivity makes it struggle in such an offensive metagame and leaves it vulnerable to several offensive Pokemon in the tier. Lickitung also struggles against the common Fighting-types in the tier, such as Mienfoo and Timburr. Lastly, Lickitung faces competition from Spritzee as a Wish passer and cleric and from Munchlax as a Normal-type special wall.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lickitung has access to a huge physical movepool that offers a wide array of coverage to hit specific threats Earthquake hits common Rock- and Steel-types; Power Whip damages Shell Smash users and Staryu; Zen Headbutt deals with bulky Fighting-types; Hammer Arm OHKOes offensive Pawniard variants and has a good chance of OHKOing Eviolite Pawniard, but outside of that, it has no other prominent function. Other physical moves include Aqua Tail and the elemental punches. Lickitung also has an expansive special movepool that includes Ice Beam, which hits Dragon- and Flying-types, Fire Blast, which nails Ferroseed, and Surf, which damages Geodude and Onix. However, Lickitung is too slow to utilize these moves, has low offensive stats, and has superior moves in Body Slam and Knock Off, which offer more utility. Lickitung can use Dragon Tail along with Rest and Sleep Talk in order to phaze foes and common switch-ins like Mudbray; however, the combination of Rest and Sleep Talk is generally better used with Munchlax, whereas phazing foes can be done better through the likes of Onix. Lickitung can utilize a more defensive set with Body Slam, Knock Off, Toxic, and a specific coverage move, but the Wish set is generally superior. Lickitung also has access to several boosting moves, such as Swords Dance, Belly Drum, and Curse, but there are better setup sweepers in the tier such as Swords Dance Pawniard, Zigzagoon, and various Shell Smash users.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Lickitung struggles with various Fighting-types, such as Mienfoo, Timburr, Scraggy, and Croagunk. They threaten Lickitung with super effective Fighting-type STAB moves, and most carry Knock Off to easily remove Lickitung's Eviolite, greatly reducing its bulk.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Lickitung is very reliant on Eviolite for its bulk. If its Eviolite gets removed by Knock Off, it greatly reduces Lickitung's bulk, thus reducing its supportive and walling capabilities.</p> <p><strong>Pawniard</strong>: Pawniard takes little damage from Lickitung's offensive moves outside of Earthquake and can use Lickitung as setup bait. Pawniard can also use Knock Off to remove Lickitung's Eviolite.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Various setup sweepers, including Swords Dance Pawniard, Dragon Dance Scraggy, Belly Drum Zigzagoon, and Shell Smash users, can use Lickitung as setup bait, as it cannot do much to them.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Coverage</strong>: Many Pokemon, such as offensive Mudbray, Doduo, Rufflet, and Deerling, carry Fighting-type coverage, which can deal heavy damage to Lickitung.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Rock- and Steel-types</strong>: Lickitung cannot do much to defensive Rock- and Steel-types like Ferroseed, Onix, Honedge, and Geodude if it doesn't have Knock Off and Earthquake. However, most of these Pokemon can't really do much to Lickitung in return.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wish Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wish enables Lickitung to recover health for teammates while also giving it a reliable form of recovery. Protect is used to guarantee recovery from Wish and can be used to scout for the foe's moves. It can also be used situationally against High Jump Kick users like Mienfoo. Body Slam is a decently strong STAB move that has a 30% chance to paralyze the foe, giving Lickitung more utility compared to other Normal-type moves like Return. Knock Off further enhances Lickitung's utility by removing items. It also allows Lickitung to threaten Ghost- and Psychic-types. Heal Bell can be run to enhance Lickitung's supportive capabilities, curing its teammates and itself from harmful status such as burns or poison. However, when using Heal Bell, Lickitung will have to forgo either Body Slam or Knock Off. This makes Lickitung very passive when running Heal Bell over Body Slam, and Lickitung will be walled by Ghost-types when using Heal Bell over Knock Off.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite greatly increases Lickitung's bulk, allowing it to take more hits from various attackers. Oblivious is used so Lickitung can't be affected by Taunt, allowing it to use Wish against stallbreakers. 196 HP and 236 Special Defense EVs are used to maximize Lickitung's special bulk in order to take on special attackers like Abra, Gastly, Magnemite, and Chinchou. In particular, Lickitung can avoid the 2HKO from Life Orb Gastly and Life Orb Abra after Stealth Rock damage. The HP investment also makes Lickitung's Wishes as big as possible. The 76 Defense EVs and an Impish nature maximize Lickitung's Eviolite-boosted bulk and allow it to nearly always avoid the OHKO from Choice Scarf Mienfoo's High Jump Kick.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to Eviolite combined with Lickitung's raw bulk, it can switch into most non-Fighting-type attacks relatively easily. However, Lickitung should stay away from Fighting-types, as they can KO it quickly, thus eliminating its Wish support for the rest of the match. Also, do not let Lickitung take a Knock Off, as without an Eviolite, Lickitung loses much of its bulk and cannot take on many special attackers reliably. Lickitung can become setup bait for threats such as Swords Dance Pawniard and Shell Smash Shellder, so it is best to switch out into an appropriate check if one of those Pokemon comes in. Use Wish liberally when either Lickitung or its teammates require healing. When Lickitung doesn't have to use Wish, Body Slam and Knock Off should be used to fish for paralysis and remove items.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spritzee is a good teammate for Lickitung because the two form an effective Wish-passing core while covering each other's weaknesses. Other Fairy-types such as Snubbull and Cottonee value Lickitung's Wishes and can take on the Fighting-types that trouble Lickitung, namely Mienfoo and Timburr. Other Fighting-type checks, which include Mareanie, Mudbray, Foongus, and Vullaby, can handle Fighting-types that threaten Lickitung. Fighting-type checks that don't have reliable recovery, such as Croagunk, Skrelp, and Koffing, appreciate Lickitung's Wishes. Swords Dance Pawniard can easily set up on Lickitung and use Knock Off to remove its Eviolite, so Lickitung appreciates Pokemon that check it such as Mienfoo, Timburr, Mudbray, and Croagunk. Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr appreciate Lickitung's ability to handle Abra and also value Lickitung's Wishes. Although Lickitung can take Spritzee's attacks, it's setup fodder for Spritzee; therefore, Pokemon that can threaten Spritzee, such as Magnemite and Pawniard, are appreciated. In turn, Lickitung provides Wish support for them. If Lickitung is not running Knock Off, Dark-types, including Pawniard, Vullaby, and Alolan Grimer, can deal with opposing Ghost-types that otherwise won't take damage from Lickitung. Pawniard and Alolan Grimer can also Pursuit trap these Ghost-types, relieving pressure on Lickitung. Similarly, teammates that can damage Rock- and Steel-types can be helpful if Lickitung doesn't have Knock Off. Such Pokemon include common Fighting- and Ground-types in the tier, such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Mudbray.</p>"

Furthermore, Horsea is outclassed by other Swift Swim users such as Omanyte, as they can hit much harder than Horsea in the rain.

Its Water typing provides it with useful resistances to Water-, Ice-, and Steel-type attacks, which are commonly run as coverage by LC's premier Volt Switch users. Goldeen's movepool has useful options such as Knock Off, Megahorn, and specifically Bounce, which can be used alongside a Flyinium Z to let Goldeen lure in and KO Grass- and Fighting-types. Goldeen's good Attack and Speed allow it to put some offensive pressure on the opposing team. However, Goldeen generally faces competition as a physically offensive Water-type from the likes of Corphish, which has extremely strong STAB attacks thanks to Adaptability and access to Dragon Dance and Swords Dance, and Carvanha, which hits harder, more consistently breaks through Grass-types, and has Speed Boost to outpace normally faster Pokemon. Goldeen's bad bulk also doesn't help its case, as it takes massive damage from powerful neutral hits and will almost always get OHKOed by super effective attacks. Finally, Goldeen lacks a good way to hit bulky Water- and Flying-types as well as Grass- and Fighting-types after Supersonic Skystrike has been used up, meaning that it can be walled fairly easily by Pokemon like Timburr and Foongus.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aqua Tail is a more powerful option over Waterfall, but it's less reliable due to its poor accuracy. Eviolite or Life Orb can be used instead of Flyinium Z, but this leaves Goldeen walled by Fighting- and Grass-types. A mixed attacking set can work, but it's too reliant on getting boosts from Lightning Rod, as Goldeen's Special Attack is rather low. Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Ferroseed, but it doesn't provide much coverage overall. Megahorn is a strong 120-Base Power Bug-type move, but it doesn't provide much coverage that Goldeen doesn't already have on the main set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ferroseed</strong>: Ferroseed takes neutral damage from Supersonic Skystrike, can set entry hazards up in front of Goldeen, and KOes it with Bullet Seed.</p> <p><strong>Other Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Snivy can be difficult for Goldeen to face if Supersonic Skystrike has already been used, as this forces Goldeen to attack with the unreliable Bounce to deal with them. Cottonee can cripple Goldeen with Stun Spore or lower its stats with Memento for a setup sweeper to come in. Foongus and Pumpkaboo-XL are both bulky enough to survive a Supersonic Strike from full HP and can OHKO Goldeen with Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Slowpoke and Mareanie can attempt to burn Goldeen with Scald. They must watch out for Knock Off, however.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Goldeen does not appreciate status, as it hurts its offensive presence. As it often switches in to Chinchou and Staryu, it is prone to getting burned by Scald. It also dislikes getting paralyzed, but Lightning Rod helps with this by giving it an immunity to Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: As Goldeen often switches in on Electric-types, it is prone to being weakened by Stealth Rock and Spikes.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Supersonic Skystrike": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bounce can be turned into Supersonic Skystrike, a powerful 160-Base Power attack that allows Goldeen to be a lure for Fighting- and Grass-types, most notably Timburr and Foongus, and OHKO them after their Eviolites have been removed. Waterfall is Goldeen's most reliable STAB move, hitting Ground- and Fire-types super effectively. Drill Run works with Lightning Rod to allow Goldeen to check Electric-types both defensively and offensively, hitting Pokemon such as Chinchou and Elekid for super effective damage. Knock Off is used to remove Eviolite from bulky switch-ins to Goldeen, such as Foongus and Mareanie, and helps it achieve more KOs with Supersonic Skystrike. It also hits Ghost-types such as Frillish and Pumpkaboo-XL, both of which can otherwise wall Goldeen. Poison Jab can be used to hit Fairy-types such as Spritzee and Snubbull super effectively. However, it forces you to drop an essential move in either Waterfall or Knock Off.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The listed Attack and Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Goldeen to hit as hard and fast as possible while outspeeding threats such as Pawniard and Berry Juice Magnemite. 36 Special Defense EVs allow Goldeen to nearly always take two Flash Cannons from Magnemite, helping it check it better. Flyinium Z is mandatory for turning Bounce into Supersonic Skystrike. Lightning Rod is the only reason to use Goldeen, as it allows it to check Electric-types effectively.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Goldeen should often be switched into Electric-types, as its poor bulk prevents it from switching into much else. Supersonic Skystrike should be used carefully due to its one-time-use nature. If there are no Fighting- or Grass-types on the opponent's team, you can use Supersonic Skystrike as a powerful attack to break walls down. Before using Supersonic Skystrike, it is best to use Knock Off to remove a potential Eviolite on the foe you'd like to hit with the move. As most Electric-types will switch out of Goldeen, you should use Knock Off when you predict a switch to remove the foe's item. If you predict a switch into a bulkier foe like Foongus or Timburr, you should Knock Off so that you can follow up with a Supersonic Skystrike. However, Goldeen should be wary when trying to check Elekid in case of Hidden Power Grass, which has a slight chance of OHKOing Goldeen, meaning it must stay healthy throughout the match if it wants to reliably check Elekid. Knock Off should be used early- and mid-game in order to cripple the opponent's Pokemon. Goldeen should avoid getting worn down, as it will struggle to check the things it needs to if it is significantly weakened.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can remove entry hazards such as Staryu and Vullaby are invaluable as teammates, as Goldeen will often be switching in and out constantly against Electric-types. In return, Goldeen can switch into the Electric-types that threaten these Pokemon. Clerics such as Spritzee and Snubbull can remove status that cripples Goldeen such as Scald burns from Chinchou. Pokemon that can take care of Water-types, such as Snivy and Magnemite, can help Goldeen do its role much more easily. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Drilbur let Goldeen get certain KOs with Supersonic Skystrike that it would not get otherwise such as against bulkier variants of Mienfoo. Water- and Flying-types appreciate Goldeen's ability to wall Electric-types. If Goldeen is paired with another Water-type, an answer to Grass-types such as a Fire- or Flying-type is needed. Flying-types in particular are great partners for Goldeen, as they can break through Grass- and Fighting-types such as Foongus and Timburr after Supersonic Skystrike has been used. Electric-types such as Elekid and Chinchou can take care of Flying-types such as Doduo.</p>"

Similarly, Staryu also has access to Thunder Wave, but it is difficult to find room for the move outside of sets dedicated to taking advantage of paralysis.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Slowpoke, Chinchou, and Frillish can switch into any of Staryu's sets with ease, barring the uncommon inclusion of Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Grass.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is a very strong STAB attack. Psychic, Ice Beam, and Thunderbolt provide potent coverage against many Pokemon that resist Water, such as Mareanie and Snivy. Hidden Power Fire KOes Ferroseed that comes in against Staryu expecting to wall it. However, if your team desperately needs entry hazard removal, Staryu is strong enough to drop a coverage move and run Rapid Spin.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Staryu's Speed and Special Attack so it can hit as hard and fast as possible. The leftover EVs are most useful in Defense to weaken various physical attacks such as Mienfoo's High Jump Kick and Timburr's Drain Punch. If Hidden Power Fire is used with an Eviolite, an EV spread of 36 HP / 200 SpA / 240 Spe should be used instead to account for lowered IVs; if Hidden Power Fire is used with a Life Orb, then the HP EVs should be ignored as well for an EV spread of 200 SpA / 240 Spe to maintain 19 HP and reduce Life Orb recoil. A Timid nature further raises Staryu's Speed, reaching the excellent 19 Speed tier. Running Analytic lets Staryu badly damage switch-ins. Eviolite gives Staryu more switch-in opportunities and lets it avoid more OHKOs, but holding a Life Orb make Staryu's damage output even more impressive, especially on forced switches from the opponent.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Staryu is pretty frail when it isn't carrying Eviolite, so be cautious about switching it into anything but the weakest attacks out there. Staryu is really, really strong with Analytic, so bring it in on something it forces out like Ponyta and take a hefty chunk out of whatever switches in with Staryu's high-powered attacks! Be sure to weaken Pokemon with priority attacks such as Timburr and Pawniard, as they can circumvent Staryu's excellent Speed and threaten it with their STAB priority attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Staryu needs free switches onto the field in order to be effective. Pair it with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch user like Mienfoo or Magnemite for best effect. Very few things can switch into Staryu, and most of those are bulky Water-types like Slowpoke. Therefore, bringing a teammate such as Pawniard or Snivy is advised. Staryu appreciates Knock Off support from the likes of Mienfoo and Pawniard, as this allows it to break through defensive Pokemon more easily. Entry hazard support allows you to fully capitalize on the switches Staryu forces; combining Analytic-boosted attacks with entry hazard damage will take huge chunks of HP out of anything that tries to switch in. Good Pokemon for entry hazard support include Dwebble and Pawniard.</p>"

      "Offensive Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin allows Staryu to remove entry hazards, such as Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes, from its side of the field; this move is the biggest reason to use Staryu. Hydro Pump is Staryu's most powerful STAB attack, and it hits very hard after a boost from Analytic. The third moveslot is a choice between coverage moves; Ice Beam allows Staryu to put a sizable dent into any Pumpkaboo coming in to block Rapid Spin, and Psychic allows Staryu to threaten various important Poison- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Croagunk, Timburr, and Mareanie. Thunderbolt allows Staryu to take on other bulky Water-type Pokemon, most notably Frillish and other Staryu. Lastly, Recover helps magnify Staryu's longevity by restoring its HP.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>236 Speed EVs and a Timid nature maximize Staryu's already great Speed, allowing it to reach the excellent 19 Speed tier. Putting 116 EVs in Special Attack helps boost the power of Staryu's powerful Analytic-boosted attacks. Finally, 156 Defense EVs and Eviolite help bolster Staryu's bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Staryu's main job is to use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards, so you should make a significant effort to do this whenever possible. If you opponent is packing a Pumpkaboo, however, it may be wise to try to hit it with Ice Beam as it switches in, as no Pumpkaboo can avoid a 2HKO from the attack due to Analytic. In general, Staryu makes for a good switch-in to most Fire-, Rock-, and Ground-type Pokemon, as it is usually faster than them and can threaten them with its Water-type STAB attacks. Additionally, Staryu's excellent Speed allows it to revenge KO many fast, frail Pokemon such as Doduo and Gastly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Any Pokemon that appreciates entry hazard removal finds a good partner in Staryu. Examples of these Pokemon include Doduo, Ponyta, and Snover. Staryu also tends to lure in Ghost-type Pokemon as they try to block Rapid Spin; therefore, Pokemon that can use Pursuit such as Pawniard and Alolan Grimer make excellent partners, as they can come in on predicted switches and trap said Ghost-type Pokemon. Additionally, Staryu is perfect for defensive Fire / Water / Grass cores, as it synergizes very well with Pokemon such as Foongus and Ponyta.</p>"

      "Defensive Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin removes entry hazards from Staryu's side of the field. Scald is a good STAB attack that carries a useful burn chance. Psychic allows Staryu to OHKO Gastly and helps against other Poison-type Pokemon such as Croagunk and Foongus. Alternatively, Ice Beam hits Pumpkaboo and other Grass-type Pokemon, but it is not able to 2HKO every variant of Pumpkaboo due to this set's decreased power. Thunderbolt allows Staryu to take on other bulky Water-type Pokemon, most notably Frillish and other Staryu. Recover helps Staryu stay around longer by restoring its HP.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>236 Speed EVs and a Timid nature maximize Staryu's Speed, getting it to 19 Speed and making it more likely to get off a Rapid Spin. 156 HP EVs and 116 EVs in Defense give Staryu serviceable bulk and also increase the amount of HP it gains from Recover from 10 to 11. Eviolite further bolsters Staryu's bulk. Natural Cure allows Staryu to absorb status moves for its teammates; this is particularly useful for taking Will-O-Wisp burns from an opposing Ponyta or Larvesta.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Staryu set, while more passive than others, tends to be able to switch into and spin against more Pokemon. In addition, this variant of Staryu is capable of switching directly into Gastly thanks to its greater Speed, its ability to OHKO Gastly with Psychic, and the fact that Natural Cure can nullify any Sludge Bomb poison status. Don't be afraid to use Scald unless the opponent has a Pokemon immune to Water-type attacks; its chance to burn the foe makes Scald an incredible move!</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Any Pokemon that appreciates entry hazard removal finds a good partner in Staryu. Examples of these include Vullaby, Rufflet, and Salandit. This variant of Staryu in particular is perfect for defensive Fire / Water / Grass cores, as it synergizes especially well with Pokemon such as Foongus and Ponyta. In general, Staryu makes a good glue Pokemon for a lot of teams, as it has good synergy with most Grass- and Fairy-type Pokemon.</p>"

  "Omanyte": {
    "overview": "<p>Omanyte has a rock-solid place in the LC metagame thanks to its high Defense, which gives it many setup opportunities, coupled with its high Special Attack, which allows it to pressure the opponent's team at the same time. Omanyte is able to perform two very different roles, each with different counterplay, which gives it a certain measure of unpredictability. First, it can run a Shell Smash set, allowing it to boost its already-high Special Attack and sweep teams in the late-game. Alternatively, it can adopt a supporting role, using Weak Armor to boost its Speed and its wide support movepool to set entry hazards and disrupt the opposing team. In addition, Omanyte's typing gives it key resistances to Flying- and Fire-type moves, but it also gives it weaknesses to the more common Electric-, Grass-, and Fighting-type moves. Omanyte is also held back by its poor Speed, which leaves it reliant on either a Weak Armor or Shell Smash boost to perform its role effectively, and its lack of priority, leaving it susceptible to certain revenge killers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>On the Shell Smash set, running Rock Blast with an EV spread of 116 Atk / 36 Def / 196 SpA / 156 Spe allows Omanyte to get around Focus Sash Abra, and more reliably sweep offensive teams. However, Omanyte usually prefers coverage moves. Similarly, Hidden Power Fire is an option to lure and eliminate Ferroseed, which can be useful for Water-spam teams, but it lacks use against most other Pokemon. Life Orb can be used on the Shell Smash set to boost Omanyte's damage output, but the lack of Eviolite makes it significantly harder for Omanyte to set up and the power boost is usually unnecessary given Omanyte's great attacking prowess after a Shell Smash. Scald is an option on the support set, but Omanyte would generally prefer to either utilize a more powerful attack to hit as hard as possible or set up hazards against physical attackers. Berry Juice can be used on both sets, but it, like Life Orb, makes it harder for Omanyte to get a Shell Smash or Weak Armor boost. Lastly, Omanyte can function as a rain setter with Rain Dance thanks to its decent defensive stats and access to Swift Swim, but rain is an underwhelming strategy in Little Cup, and Omanyte can double its Speed stat and hit harder with a Shell Smash boost than with a Rain Dance boost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ferroseed</strong>: Ferroseed is the most reliable counter to both Omanyte sets, being able to easily OHKO Omanyte with Bullet Seed or cripple it with Thunder Wave, as well as survive any attack from it even after a Shell Smash boost.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks</strong>: Powerful super effective attacks, especially Grass-type attacks, as well as Electric-type attacks from the likes of Magnemite and Elekid and Fighting-type attacks such as Mienfoo's High Jump Kick, can easily take out Omanyte before it sets up.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority</strong>: Strong priority moves, especially super effective Fighting priority moves from the likes of Timburr and Croagunk, and Sucker Punch on Pokemon such as Pawniard, can revenge kill Omanyte after it is weakened and its Defense has been lowered by Weak Armor or Shell Smash.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy and Focus Sash Users</strong>: Sturdy and Focus Sash users, such as Abra and SturdyJuice Magnemite, can act as safety nets against Shell Smash Omanyte; however, they need to be wary of switching into the Weak Armor set, which can surprise them with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Munchlax and Spritzee can survive an attack from Omanyte even after a Shell Smash boost and cripple it, but they have to beware the Weak Armor set, which can remove their defensive items with Knock Off and set up hazards against them.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash allows Omanyte to function as a very effective sweeper, patching up its poor Speed stat and doubling its high Special Attack in a single turn. Hydro Pump is Omanyte's most powerful STAB move, able to KO most Pokemon that don't resist it with a small amount of prior damage, specifically Timburr. Surf can be used as a less powerful alternative with higher accuracy on teams that can easily wear down bulky Pokemon enough for Hydro Pump to be unnecessary. Ice Beam hits the Grass-types that resist Hydro Pump, including Foongus, Cottonee, and Snivy, as well as certain bulky Pokemon such as Vullaby more accurately than Hydro Pump. Earth Power is a valuable coverage move, able to hit Pokemon such as Chinchou, Croagunk, and Mareanie that take little damage from Hydro Pump and Ice Beam. Alternatively, Hidden Power Grass is an option to hit bulky Water-types harder, most notably Staryu, while still securing a KO on most Chinchou variants.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Omanyte's Special Attack and its Speed so that it can hit as hard as possible and reach 26 Speed with a Shell Smash boost, outspeeding practically every Choice Scarf user in the metagame, making it harder to revenge kill. The remaining EVs go into HP, which, when coupled with Eviolite, increases Omanyte's ability to take hits while setting up Shell Smash. Shell Armor is the preferred ability on the set, as rain is rarely seen in LC, rendering Swift Swim useless, and Weak Armor lowers Omanyte's Defense, leaving it susceptible to being revenge killed by priority moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Shell Smash Omanyte works as a late-game sweeper, meaning it should virtually always be preserved until its checks and counters are weakened enough for it to sweep, and the priority users that can revenge kill it have been eliminated. Omanyte should usually attempt to set up with Shell Smash when it can secure a turn against a Pokemon whose moves it resists, such as a Flying-type that is locked into its Flying-type STAB attack, a Fire-type, or a more passive Pokemon. After Omanyte has set up, it can sweep with its wide coverage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Memento support is especially helpful, as it increases the opportunities Omanyte has to set up. For this reason, Cottonee, which can also provide Knock Off support, is a good option, especially because it lures in the Fire-, Flying-, and Poison-types that Omanyte can set up on. Alolan Grimer can trap Focus Sash Abra, which often acts as a safety net to Omanyte sweeps, with Pursuit; it also has access to Memento, though it shares a Ground weakness with Omanyte. Will-O-Wisp Gastly can bring in opposing Pawniard and cripple them with a burn, making Omanyte less susceptible to getting picked off by Sucker Punch. Gastly is also immune to Fighting-type priority, which allows it to revenge kill Fighting-type Pokemon easily. Entry hazards assist Omanyte in its sweep by weakening Pokemon that switch into it and breaking opposing Sturdy. Ferroseed sets hazards well, and it can lure in and use Knock Off on the Fighting-types that look to check Omanyte. Dwebble also can use Knock Off and set both Stealth Rock and Spikes. Knock Off users can soften bulkier Pokemon so that Omanyte can sweep. Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr can lure in Pokemon such as Foongus and Spritzee and use Knock Off on them, allowing Omanyte to deal with them later in the game. Pancham can do the same but also has access to Parting Shot, which can bring Omanyte in safely and give it a setup opportunity late in the game.</p>"
      },
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Omanyte has an easy time setting up entry hazards throughout a match, so Spikes is a good choice in the first slot because it can be stacked. If nothing else on Omanyte's team can fit Stealth Rock on to its moveset, however, and Omanyte is using a different move in its fourth moveslot, Stealth Rock can be run as well. Hydro Pump hits anything that doesn't resist it very hard and keeps this Omanyte set from being passive while setting up hazards. Knock Off allows Omanyte to support its teammates by luring in key Pokemon, such as Grass- and Fighting-types, and removing their items. Knock Off can also cripple Berry Juice users that are trying to set up entry hazards alongside Omanyte, such as Dwebble, and can even weaken Pokemon for Omanyte itself to deal with. Stealth Rock is the preferred option in the final moveslot, as Omanyte is one of the most reliable Stealth Rock setters for offensive teams. Toxic Spikes is an interesting option in this slot as well, as Omanyte is the only non-Poison-type in the LC metagame that can set it effectively. However, on faster-paced teams that don't take enough hits to appreciate Toxic Spikes wearing down the foe, Stealth Rock is the entry hazard of choice. Ice Beam can be run on this slot for coverage and to help KO the Grass-types that Omanyte lures in.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given defensive EVs, when used in conjunction with an Eviolite, allow Omanyte to survive Jolly Regenerator Mienfoo's High Jump Kick and Life Orb Diglett's Earthquake after Stealth Rock nearly all of the time while still surviving certain key super-effective attacks such as Magnemite's Volt Switch. 156 Speed EVs give Omanyte 12 Speed, allowing it to outspeed RestTalk Mudbray before a Weak Armor boost, and outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and Choice Scarf users with less than 15 Speed after a Weak Armor boost. The remaining EVs and a Modest nature go towards maximizing Omanyte's Special Attack, allowing it to OHKO Berry Juice Mudbray, as well as Mienfoo and more defensive Mudbray variants after they have been hit by Knock Off. Weak Armor doubles Omanyte's Speed when it takes a hit, enabling it to reliably set more entry hazards or pressure the opponent's team with attacking moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Omanyte can work well at various points throughout a match. On hyper offense teams, it works well as a lead, nearly always surviving an attack and getting two layers of Spikes or Stealth Rock up and putting immediate offensive pressure on the opposing team. Omanyte also cripples common Dwebble and Onix leads with Knock Off, and KOes them with Hydro Pump. On other teams, Omanyte works through the early- and mid-game, switching into resisted Fire-, Ice-, and Flying-type attacks to get a Weak Armor boost and continuing to stack entry hazards or disrupt the opposing team with Knock Off. Omanyte can take advantage of its unpredictability to bluff a Shell Smash set; however, the opponent will be cautious about activating Weak Armor after they know it has Weak Armor, so plan switches to activate Weak Armor accordingly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Omanyte set works best on offensive teams, which appreciate its ability to check certain Pokemon and set entry hazards while maintaining an offensive presence. Hard-hitting Pokemon that appreciate hazard support make for good partners, including Abra, Gastly, and setup sweepers like Scraggy and Shell Smash users. Pumpkaboo makes for a very good partner due to its ability to keep up the hazards Omanyte sets on the field by blocking Rapid Spin and its ability to lure in Fire- and Flying-type attacks, which Omanyte can switch in on and get a Weak Armor boost from. Pokemon that can take advantage of Defog users, including Defiant Pawniard and some Rock-type Pokemon, make good partners to deter the removal of Omanyte's hazards through Defog. Pokemon like Carvanha, Corphish, Scraggy, and Choice Scarf Mienfoo that appreciate Omanyte's ability to lure in and use Knock Off on Grass-types, such as Cottonee and Foongus, make good partners. Timburr especially appreciates the weakening of Cottonee and Foongus, and appreciates hazard support if attempting to clean up a team with Bulk Up.</p>"

  "Kabuto": {
    "overview": "<p>Kabuto has a niche in being a Rapid Spin user that can also set up Stealth Rock, allowing it to perform two major roles in a team. Kabuto also has access to Knock Off, which allows it to remove foes' Eviolites and hit the Ghost-types that try and block Rapid Spin. Its useful Water typing allows it to beat many common leads like Onix and Dwebble, as well as giving it resistances to common types like Fire, Poison, and Flying. With a solid Defense stat and Rock typing, Kabuto becomes a decent Flying-type check; while it is weak to Fighting, Kabuto survives a Jump Kick from Doduo, a Superpower from Bulk Up Rufflet, and two Knock Offs from Vullaby while OHKOing Doduo and Rufflet and 2HKOing Vullaby with Rock Slide. Kabuto has a good Attack stat that allows it to beat Drilbur and Life Orb Diglett with Waterfall. After it is activated, Weak Armor allows Kabuto to outspeed Pokemon such as Doduo and Rufflet. Despite its good defensive prowess, its special bulk is lackluster, making it lose to many mixed and special attackers like Staryu, Foongus, and Spritzee. While it is a decent Flying-type check, a poor defensive typing also gives it weaknesses to common Fighting-, Electric-, and Grass-type moves. Kabuto also faces competition from other Rapid Spin users such as Staryu and Drilbur and other Stealth Rock setters such as Dwebble and Onix, which have better Speed stats, offensive presences, and defensive typings.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Waterium Z allows Kabuto to significantly damage many of its switch-ins with Hydro Vortex, and Rockium Z allows it to OHKO Vullaby after Stealth Rock damage with Continental Crush, but Eviolite is generally a better option due to the extra bulk it provides in allowing Kabuto to survive important hits from Pokemon like Rufflet and Doduo. Hone Claws lets Kabuto increase its Attack and make its Rock Slide more accurate, although Kabuto does not have enough space to run Rapid Spin, Hone Claws, and two attacks and still be very effective. A Swift Swim set can be used on rain teams, but the lack of any Pokemon with Drizzle in LC makes this unviable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Magnemite and Chinchou take very little damage from Kabuto and can OHKO and 2HKO it with Thunderbolt, respectively, but they do not like having their items removed with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Mienfoo, Timburr, and Scraggy can switch in on Kabuto without taking much damage from it, and, in the case of Timburr and Scraggy, start setting up on Kabuto. Mienfoo can also Taunt Kabuto to prevent it setting up Stealth Rock. Croagunk is a great counter to Kabuto as well because it has a pseudo-immunity to Water-type attacks thanks to Dry Skin and can threaten Kabuto with Focus Blast and Vacuum Wave.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Foongus, Cottonee, Ferroseed, and Pumpkaboo-XL all wall Kabuto and KO it with their Grass-type STAB moves. However, Pumpkaboo-XL can be severely damaged with Knock Off, and most of them are severely crippled by having their item removed.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types resist Rock Slide and most of them can threaten Kabuto, such as Magnemite, Alolan Sandshrew, and Pawniard. Pawniard is particularly effective at this, as it resists Knock Off as well.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin allows Kabuto to remove entry hazards, and unlike Defog, it will not remove the Stealth Rock that Kabuto sets up on the opponent's side of the field. Rapid Spin also breaks Sturdy on opposing Pokemon, particularly lead Onix and Dwebble, and enables Kabuto to KO them next turn with Waterfall. Stealth Rock causes the opponent's Pokemon to take chip damage throughout the match. Having Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock on the same Pokemon provides good role compression. Knock Off provides great utility by allowing Kabuto to remove Eviolites and cripple defensive Pokemon, remove Berry Juice from Sturdy leads such as Onix and Dwebble, remove Choice Scarfs from Pokemon like Doduo and Chinchou, and severely damage spinblockers such as Pumpkaboo-XL and Frillish. Rock Slide hits Flying-types super effectively, making Kabuto a good Flying-type check. Aqua Jet allows Kabuto to beat Onix, Dwebble, and Focus Sash Diglett more easily, as well as picking off weakened, faster threats to your team. Waterfall lets Kabuto hit Ground-types hard, OHKOing Mudbray and 2HKOing its RestTalk set.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Weak Armor is the preferred ability, as it doubles Kabuto's Speed after Kabuto takes a physical hit. This puts its physical bulk to good use and allows it to KO a variety of revenge killers like Abra and Choice Scarf Chinchou. 156 EVs in Speed allow Kabuto to outspeed 19 Speed and slower Choice Scarf users after a Weak Armor boost, such as Mienfoo, Pawniard, Doduo, and Gastly. A Careful nature along with the HP, Defense, and Special Defense EVs give Kabuto more defensive power, particularly specially, to survive a hit and get a Weak Armor boost. Eviolite is the chosen item because it gives Kabuto enough bulk to take most physical hits, including a Superpower from Rufflet after Stealth Rock damage and nearly always a Knock Off followed by Iron Head from Pawniard.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kabuto can be used as a lead, but should not be used as such if the opponent has a Taunt user. If the opponent has Onix or Dwebble, however, Kabuto is a great lead because it can easily defeat these common leads with Knock Off and Waterfall. If your opponent has a spinblocker such as Pumpkaboo-XL or Frillish, you can predict the switch-in and cripple it with Knock Off, dealing massive damage and removing their item. You should make use of Kabuto's bulk and resistances by using it as a Flying-type check or switching it in on resisted physical hits. Switching in on Rapid Spin allows Kabuto to double its Speed thanks to Weak Armor while taking minimal damage. However, Kabuto has limited longevity, since it takes large amounts of damage from special attacks, and Weak Armor makes each consecutive physical hit stronger by reducing Kabuto's Defense. Because of this, Kabuto should be used as a pivot and switched in and out until its job of hazard control is complete.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teams that need role compression appreciate Kabuto, as it functions as a Flying-type check, an entry hazard setter, and a hazard remover. Fire-types such as Ponyta, Larvesta, and Houndour appreciate Rapid Spin support and can switch in on Grass-type moves. Flame Body users such as Larvesta and Ponyta also discourage Fighting-types such as Mienfoo from throwing around too many Fighting-type moves. Flying-types such as Vullaby and Rufflet appreciate Rapid Spin support and can switch in on Ground- and Grass-type moves, and Grass-types can also switch in on Ground- and Grass-type moves. Foongus and Cottonee are especially useful, as they resist Fighting-type moves as well. Foongus can also beat most Grass-types with Sludge Bomb. In return, Kabuto can switch in on Poison-, Fire-, and Flying-type moves aimed at Grass-types. Spinblockers and Defog deterrents such as Pumpkaboo-XL and Pawniard, respectively, can help prevent foes from removing Stealth Rock. Pumpkaboo-XL can also switch in on Ground-type moves for Kabuto, and Kabuto which in return switches in on the Flying-, Fire-, and Poison-type moves aimed at Pumpkaboo. Fast pivots such as Mienfoo, Elekid, and Choice Scarf Chinchou can help to bring Weak Armor Kabuto in against weak or resisted physical attacks, giving it a Weak Armor Speed boost. Pokemon like Carvanha appreciate the extra damage that Stealth Rock provides.</p>"

  "Dratini": {
    "overview": "<p>Dratini is able to perform as both a threatening wallbreaker and a late-game cleaner due to its access to strong offensive moves like Draco Meteor, Iron Tail, and Extreme Speed and a strong setup option in Dragon Dance. Its two main options are a mixed attacking set that utilizes Dratini's high-Base Power moves and good coverage to weaken the opposing team for sweepers or clean late-game and a sweeping set that utilizes Dragon Dance, since +1 Dratini is both fast and strong enough to clean up weakened teams. Dratini also has a useful ability in Shed Skin, allowing it to occasionally cure itself of debilitating status conditions like paralysis and burn. Dratini's typing is a mixed blessing, sporting very useful resistances to Water- and Electric-type moves but leaving it weak to moderately common Fairy- and Ice-type attacks. Dratini's positive qualities are also offset by its average-at-best stats, with low bulk and only middling power and Speed before a boost. Dratini further suffers from having common counters such as Snubbull, Magnemite, and Spritzee.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave is an option that allows Dratini to support the team and make up for its middling Speed but generally is not as useful as the coverage options on the mixed attacker set. Surf can be used on the mixed attacker set to 2HKO targets such as Mudbray and Ponyta more reliably than Draco Meteor due to the lack of Special Attack drop, so it is a worthwhile option if Dratini's teammates can handle the Fairy- or Steel-types it will struggle to damage due to a lack of Iron Tail or Fire Blast. Similarly, Waterfall can be used on the Dragon Dance set, but it leaves Dratini far more vulnerable to both Fairy- and Steel-types. Ice Beam and Thunderbolt hit very few targets Dratini cannot break already and are generally not worth using over other coverage options, but they have a niche for targets such as Staryu and Flying-types in general. While a fully special set is possible due to Dratini's good special movepool, a significant part of Dratini's viability comes from its access to Extreme Speed, and its job is overall done better by stronger and faster special attackers like Staryu. A RestTalk set with Eviolite, Marvel Scale, and Dragon Tail may seem useful, but Dratini's bulk is still mediocre and the set is mostly walled by either Steel- or Fairy-types, depending on the fourth move chosen. Eviolite can also be used on the Dragon Dance set, but it results in Dratini being significantly weaker and having far more issues breaking through opposing teams. Dragonium Z is an option over Life Orb on either set, giving Dratini a one-time nuke off its very high-Base Power Dragon-type STAB move without the downsides of either, but it leaves Dratini's other coverage moves severely weakened and makes Dratini's job after using Devastating Drake more difficult.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: While Fairy-types do have to watch out for Iron Tail, they are generally able to OHKO Dratini with little issue. Snubbull in particular is threatening due to Intimidate weakening Dratini.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Pawniard and Magnemite resist a majority of Dratini's moves, only needing to be wary of Fire Blast. Alolan Sandshrew can outspeed Dratini with a Choice Scarf and OHKO Dratini with its Ice-type STAB attack.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Fast Choice Scarf users such as Mienfoo and Doduo outspeed Dratini even after a Dragon Dance and do heavy damage due to Dratini's fairly low defenses, although they do need to watch out for Extreme Speed. Gastly is a notable Choice Scarf user that is also immune to Extreme Speed.</p>",

      "Life Orb Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is Dratini's strongest attack and provides a nuke for Dratini to hit the many neutral targets in the metagame such as Mienfoo, Vullaby, and Chinchou. Extreme Speed allows Dratini to defeat faster weakened Pokemon such as Doduo and Abra. Iron Tail is used almost entirely for opposing Fairy-types such as Snubbull and Spritzee, as it allows Dratini to hit them very hard, although its shaky accuracy makes it risky to use. Fire Blast rounds off Dratini's neutral coverage and is used to hit opposing Steel-types, which otherwise would completely wall this set, notably hitting targets such as Ferroseed and Pawniard while also allowing Dratini to heavily damage opposing bulky Grass-types like Foongus and Pumpkaboo-XL without needing to resort to Draco Meteor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Special Attack is maximized on this set because Draco Meteor is Dratini's attack of choice and also because it allows Fire Blast to hit much harder. The Speed EVs are designed to let Dratini hit 13 Speed, outspeeding many bulky Pokemon such as Pumpkaboo-XL, Timburr, Spritzee, and Croagunk, which are usually slower. The rest of the EVs are poured into Attack to allow Dratini to 2HKO Spritzee without prior damage using Iron Tail more consistently as well as providing Extreme Speed with more power. A Rash nature boosts Dratini's Special Attack without lowering its Attack. Life Orb allows Dratini to make up for its average attacking stats. 17 HP IVs are used to make Dratini hit 19 HP in order to take only 1 HP of damage from Life Orb recoil. Shed Skin is Dratini's best ability for this set, allowing Dratini to potentially cure burns and paralysis, which cripple its ability to perform.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dratini's goal with this set is mainly to weaken the opposing team for its teammates. Prediction when using this set is important, as hitting Fairy- or Steel-type switch-ins with the appropriate coverage move allows Dratini to defeat them more efficiently. Dratini's fairly low bulk and lack of recovery mean it is best brought in after a teammate faints or by a slow pivot so it avoids taking damage. Dratini can be used as a revenge killer or late-game cleaner for heavily weakened Pokemon due to Extreme Speed, but Extreme Speed's lack of STAB may cause it to struggle to achieve KOs.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dratini greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon like Onix, as this allows it to wallbreak much more effectively. Similarly, Knock Off support means Dratini is capable of breaking through bulky foes like Spritzee, Vullaby, and Foongus without nearly as much difficulty. Sticky Web support allows Dratini to defeat faster Pokemon that would normally beat it, Speed tying with 20 Speed Pokemon like Diglett and outpacing 19 Speed Pokemon such as Staryu and Abra. Sweepers that need certain Pokemon weakened or defeated appreciate Dratini's ability to break down walls, especially sweepers such as Scraggy and Shellder that appreciate Dratini defeating the Fairy- or Steel-types Dratini lures in. Steel-types such as Ferroseed and Magnemite resist both of Dratini's weaknesses, and Ferroseed can also provide entry hazard, Knock Off, and Thunder Wave support. Mienfoo lures in and weakens Fairy-types and can U-turn into Dratini to allow it to get in more safely, while Chinchou can bring Dratini in with Volt Switch. Diglett is capable of trapping most Steel-types due to its ability and can weaken or remove them for Dratini.</p>"
      },
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance allows Dratini to boost both its Speed and Attack to threatening levels, allowing it to sweep. Outrage is Dratini's most reliable physical STAB move, and at +1 with a Life Orb, it does massive damage to any foes that do not resist Dragon. Extreme Speed allows Dratini to pick off weakened Choice Scarf Pokemon like Mienfoo that outspeed Dratini even after a Dragon Dance boost as well as revenge kill weakened Pokemon before setting up. The last moveslot depends on which kind of coverage Dratini needs. Iron Tail is boosted by Dragon Dance and allows Dratini to defeat weakened Fairy-types like Spritzee, while Fire Blast is an alternative that lets Dratini take out Steel-types such as Ferroseed and Pawniard, which would otherwise wall the set.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Attack and Speed are both maximized in order to allow Dratini to sweep effectively, with the given Speed EVs allowing Dratini to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame after a Dragon Dance boost. If Fire Blast is used, Naughty is a better choice than Adamant because it allows Dratini to do more damage to Steel-types. A Jolly nature can be used in order to outspeed 14 Speed Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Frillish and Speed tie with 15 Speed Choice Scarf Pokemon like Timid Magnemite. Life Orb allows Dratini to overcome its average Attack and significantly boosts Dratini's power output after setting up. 17 HP IVs are used in order to reduce Life Orb recoil to 1 HP of damage. Shed Skin allows Dratini to potentially heal burns and paralysis, which completely cripple this set.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dratini is best used as a sweeper late-game after wearing down its checks and counters. Due to Dratini's lack of bulk, Dragon Dance is best used versus Pokemon Dratini threatens out such as weakened Croagunk and Chinchou without Ice Beam. Since Outrage locks Dratini into the move and is Dratini's best neutral option, Fairy-types such as Spritzee and Snubbull being eliminated is essential. Since Fire Blast is not boosted by Dragon Dance, Dratini appreciates Steel-types like Pawniard and Magnemite being weakened even if it runs Fire Blast as its coverage move. Dratini can also support other sweepers with similar checks such as Scraggy and Shellder by weakening these checks and counters and punching holes in the opponent's team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Like most sweepers, Dratini appreciates entry hazard support from teammates like Onix and Ferroseed to wear down Pokemon that would otherwise check it. Due to Dratini's relative frailty with a Life Orb, Memento support from Pokemon like Cottonee and Diglett or Aurora Veil support from Alolan Vulpix is helpful by allowing Dratini to set up more easily. Knock Off support from teammates such as Vullaby helps Dratini break through bulkier foes like Staryu and Pawniard more easily. Fighting-types such as Timburr and Mienfoo can defeat Steel-types that give Dratini trouble, provide Knock Off support, and lure in and weaken Fairy-types that would threaten Dratini's sweep, especially using super effective moves like Poison Jab. Diglett is capable of trapping and removing Steel-types that trouble Dratini and can also run Sludge Bomb to remove Fairy-types.</p>"

  "Cyndaquil": {
    "overview": "<p>On paper, Cyndaquil's access to Eruption should make it a formidable sweeper; in practice, Cyndaquil's mediocre Special Attack and movepool leave it checked fairly easily. In addition, due to Cyndaquil's average Speed for an offensive Pokemon, it is forced to use a Choice Scarf set to be effective. Eruption allows Cyndaquil to make up for its relatively low Special Attack, but Cyndaquil's weakness to Stealth Rock and low bulk make it hard to keep Eruption's power up, and Eruption is Cyndaquil's only way to deal meaningful damage. Generally speaking, Ponyta and Larvesta are better options for offensive Fire-types, and even Houndour is a better choice as a Fire-type special attacker due to having much better Special Attack and a more useful movepool.</p>",
    "sets": {"Choice Scarf": {"description": "<p>Cyndaquil attempts to use Choice Scarf and Eruption to outspeed and KO many offensive Pokemon in the tier. Unfortunately, Cyndaquil's predictability and shallow coverage options leave it easy for Pokemon like Ponyta, Onix, and Tirtouga to come in on a resisted move. In addition, after Cyndaquil comes in while Stealth Rock is on the field, Eruption is severely weakened, meaning Cyndaquil is easily checked by almost anything with moderate bulk. Ponyta outclasses Cyndaquil in every way other than the niche of Eruption, with higher stats as well as a much better movepool, giving Ponyta excellent strong coverage. Larvesta and Houndour are also potential Choice Scarf Pokemon that outclass Cyndaquil, with Larvesta having U-turn for momentum and Houndour offering both Fire- and Dark-type STAB attacks as well as being able to boost with Flash Fire.</p>"}},

  "Totodile": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to access to Dragon Dance and a great ability in Sheer Force, Totodile can be a decently threatening late-game sweeper. Its access to good coverage moves in Superpower and Sheer Force-boosted Ice Punch allows Totodile to break through common checks to offensive Water-types, like Ferroseed and Foongus. Totodile can also use a STAB priority move in Aqua Jet, allowing it to revenge kill frail or weakened threats like Doduo and Abra. It also has decent natural bulk as well as a good defensive Water typing, meaning it can usually find a setup opportunity. However, Totodile faces a lot of competition from other physically offensive Water-types like Carvanha and Corphish. The latter in particular also has access to Dragon Dance, is more powerful than Totodile thanks to Adaptability, and can weaken walls more easily thanks to access to Knock Off. However, Totodile carves a niche for itself thanks to its access to Ice Punch, as this gives it a reliable way to hit bulky Grass-types like Foongus and Snivy. Totodile is also quite slow, meaning it can relatively easily be revenge killed by many Choice Scarf users like Doduo and Mienfoo. Lastly, Totodile struggles to break through bulky Water-types like Staryu and Mareanie, so teams that have one of these will easily be able to prevent its sweep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Totodile can run a Swords Dance set that focuses on wallbreaking for its teammates, but this is completely outclassed by Corphish due to its access to Knock Off to remove Eviolites and higher power. This set can also be used on Sticky Web teams, as its coverage means it requires less support than Corphish to clean up, while the Speed drop from Sticky Web means that it's not very easily revenge killed, thus allowing it to sweep effectively. A Dragon Dance set with a Life Orb and an Adamant nature can also be used for this purpose. Totodile has certain other coverage options it can use. Aerial Ace hits Croagunk, Iron Tail hits Fairy-types like Snubbull and Spritzee, and Rock Slide hits certain Flying-types like Mantyke harder than Ice Punch, while also hitting Ice-types. However, the coverage from Ice Punch and Superpower is nearly always preferred, as it hits more traditional and common checks to Water-types. Groundium Z is an option with Dig to OHKO Croagunk, Chinchou, and Mareanie, but Totodile doesn't want to give up any of its other moves, and Dig is useless after using the Z-Move. Substitute can be used to avoid status and Sucker Punch, but Totodile doesn't have a moveslot for it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Staryu, Mareanie, and Slowpoke can all easily take most hits from Totodile, though Staryu has to be wary of Superpower. In return, Staryu can hit it hard with Thunderbolt, Mareanie can burn it with Scald or remove its boosts with Haze, and Slowpoke can paralyze it with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burns and paralyses can easily cut Totodile's sweep short by crippling its stats. As such, status users like Ferroseed, Snubbull, and Slowpoke can prevent a sweep.</p> <p><strong>Revenge killers</strong>: Fast Choice Scarf users like Doduo and strong priority users like Timburr can easily take out a slightly weakened Totodile.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance boosts both Totodile's Attack and Speed by one stage, allowing it to sweep once its checks have been weakened. Waterfall is Totodile's best STAB move, and thanks to Sheer Force, it can 2HKO or OHKO most of the metagame that does not resist it after a Dragon Dance boost, including some very bulky Pokemon like Spritzee after Stealth Rock. Ice Punch's main targets are bulky Grass-types like Foongus and Pumpkaboo-XL, both of which are 2HKOed thanks to the Sheer Force boost even before a Dragon Dance. It also 2HKOes defensive Vullaby after a boost, which Totodile can't achieve with Waterfall. In addition, Ice Punch is Totodile's best way to hit Croagunk. Superpower hits Ferroseed, which otherwise walls Totodile completely, super effectively, 2HKOing it even through the Attack drop and before a Dragon Dance boost. Aqua Jet is an option to revenge kill frail or weakened faster threats like Gastly and Abra, as well as to take out faster Choice Scarf users after Totodile has set up, like Doduo and Drilbur. However, not running Superpower takes away Totodile's main niche of being able to take out most traditional checks to offensive Water-types, as it will be unable to dent Ferroseed. Crunch is an option to hit certain bulky Water-types like Frillish and Slowpoke as well as Wynaut very hard, but it has very limited coverage outside of these targets, and since they aren't very common, it is generally not worth a moveslot.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sheer Force is the main reason to use Totodile, as the boost it gives to Waterfall allows Totodile to be quite powerful, while the boost to Ice Punch means Totodile can beat bulky Grass-types. Eviolite is usually the item of choice, as it gives Totodile significantly more set up opportunities. For example, with an Eviolite, Totodile can take any one hit from Doduo and Abra, outside of Life Orb-boosted Energy Ball. A Life Orb can be used to achieve certain KOs; for example, after a Dragon Dance and Stealth Rock damage, it lets Totodile KO Pumpkaboo and Foongus with Ice Punch and Ferroseed with Superpower. In addition, Life Orb Totodile KOes Snubbull and Spritzee after Stealth Rock and minor prior damage if their items have been removed by a teammate's Knock Off. However, a lack of Eviolite means Totodile struggles to find setup opportunities and leaves it easily revenge killed. The Speed EVs allow Totodile to hit 14 Speed, meaning it will outspeed the entire unboosted metagame after a Dragon Dance. The Attack EVs allow Totodile to deal as much damage as possible and, in combination with an Adamant nature, secure the 2HKO on Foongus and Pumpkaboo-XL with Ice Punch and Ferroseed with Superpower. The leftover EVs are placed into Defense in order to raise it by one point. A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed 14 Speed Choice Scarf users like Modest Magnemite and Adamant Scraggy, but these aren't very common, so the extra damage from an Adamant nature is usually preferred. Jolly Totodile should usually run a Life Orb instead of an Eviolite, as it will otherwise miss out on the 2HKO on Foongus, Pumpkaboo-XL, and Ferroseed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Totodile should be preserved until the late-game in order to set up a Dragon Dance and sweep. Generally, Totodile should set up on Pokemon that can't hurt it much, such as passive Pokemon like Spritzee and Pokemon that don't have moves to hit it very hard, such as Staryu lacking Thunderbolt. It can also set up on Pokemon it forces out, like Mudbray and Diglett. Lastly, Totodile can set up on even powerful attackers in an emergency if it is holding an Eviolite, but this is not recommended, as it will be significantly weakened and thus easily revenge killed. Even though Totodile is able to break through some bulky Grass-types with Ice Punch, they should still be weakened before setting up with Totodile, as they can generally OHKO it if they take a hit, especially if Totodile is weakened. If Totodile is running Aqua Jet, it can be used to revenge kill some weakened threats, like Gastly and Doduo. Totodile should usually wait with setting up until its checks have been weakened or removed, as it will be able to sweep much more easily then. However, in some situations, it can be smart to set up with Totodile earlier in the game, as its coverage moves allow it to break through some checks it shares with a teammate like Corphish or Carvanha, allowing them to sweep more easily in the late game. Always avoid letting Totodile get statused, as a burn or paralysis can easily stop its sweep. In addition, it is often wise to avoid taking any damage, as a weakened Totodile will struggle to find setup opportunities. If Totodile is running Life Orb, faster Choice Scarf users and powerful priority users should be eliminated before attempting to sweep, as the lack of Eviolite means Totodile can easily be revenge killed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Totodile fits well on offensive Water-type cores with teammates like Carvanha, Corphish, and Staryu, as they can eliminate or weaken shared checks to allow one of them to sweep in the late-game. These Pokemon especially appreciate Totodile's ability to take out Grass-types like Foongus more consistently than most Water-types. Pokemon like Chinchou and Snivy can threaten Totodile's best answers in bulky Water-types, making them good teammates for it. Clerics like Spritzee and Snubbull can remove a burn or paralysis from Totodile, both of which can significantly cripple it. Memento support from Cottonee or Diglett, Aurora Veil support from Alolan Vulpix, or Parting Shot support from Pancham can give Totodile a setup opportunity. This is especially useful if Totodile is holding a Life Orb, as it can make up for the lack of bulk. Diglett can also trap Chinchou and Croagunk, both of which Totodile struggles to take out, while Alolan Vulpix can help it by threatening Grass-types. Other checks to Grass-types such as Vullaby, Doduo, and Ponyta can weaken or remove Pokemon like Foongus and Pumpkaboo-XL in order to make Totodile's sweep easier. Entry hazard support from Ferroseed or Onix can break Sturdy and weaken the opponent's team, allowing Totodile to clean up more easily in the late-game. Knock Off users like the aforementioned Corphish, Snivy, and Ferroseed, as well as Fighting-types like Mienfoo and Dark-types like Pawniard, can remove Eviolites from defensive Pokemon, crippling them and opening up the way for Totodile to sweep. Ground-types like Mudbray, Drilbur, and the aforementioned Diglett are good teammates for Totodile, as they can check and take out Electric-types, which threaten Totodile. Dark-types like Vullaby and Carvanha can threaten Pokemon that can prevent Totodile's sweep, like Slowpoke, Frillish, and Wynaut, and many can provide Knock Off support. Certain Dark-types, like Pawniard and Alolan Grimer, can also Pursuit trap Pokemon like Abra to make Totodile's sweep easier.</p>"

It is also one of the few Pokemon able to reliably check the many offensive Flying-types of Little Cup, primarily the likes of Vullaby and Doduo. However, its defensive sets can be too passive and its offensive sets can be too frail. It also has no reliable recovery besides Rest and Berry Juice.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Rest + Sleep Talk set can be extremely hard to deal with, but Ground-types make it difficult for it to reach its full potential. Heal Bell gives Chinchou more utility and helps its partners get around sleep and burns. Soak combined with Chinchou's Electric-type attacks looks good on paper, but in practice it can easily be shut down. Dazzling Gleam can be useful on the Choice Scarf set on teams weak to Scraggy, but it isn't very helpful otherwise. Z-Rain Dance can boost Chinchou's Speed for a sweep, but it is usually inferior to other setup sweepers because it can only be used once per game. Hidden Power Fire can be used to damage Ferroseed, but fails to OHKO even the Berry Juice variant. Agility with Life Orb can also be used to sweep, but it is, again, inferior to other Water-type sweepers, mostly because of its lack of power. A set with 14 Special Defense can be a weak but still relatively good Nasty Plot Vullaby check. Sucker Punch can be used as priority, but Chinchou's poor Attack make this a hard move to pull off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types like Foongus, Ferroseed, and Pumpkaboo-XL can switch into Chinchou and resist all of its moves bar Ice Beam, although they are hit relatively hard by it.</p> <p><strong>Electric-immune Pokemon</strong>: All Electric-immune Pokemon are threats, but Ground-types and specific Water-types are the worst of them. Although Scald and Ice Beam hit very hard, faster Ground-types can switch into a Volt Switch from either set and either force Chinchou out or KO it. Diglett in particular can trap Chinchou and KO it, while Drilbur can set up Stealth Rock while Chinchou needs to switch out. Chinchou can also be its own worst enemy. Opposing Chinchou can switch into every move bar Hidden Power Ground and sometimes even stall your Chinchou out. Similarly, the very rarely seen Goldeen can absorb a Volt Switch and take a Scald with ease.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon that can take a burn</strong>: Timburr can easily switch into a Scald and will get a 1.5x Attack boost if burned, opening up for a sweep. Munchlax can heal a burn with Rest if needed.</p> <p><strong>Croagunk</strong>: Croagunk can easily switch into a Scald and force Chinchou out. It also sometimes carries Nasty Plot, and Chinchou is the perfect setup bait.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Chinchou's main STAB move, as its 100% accuracy and its burn chance come in handy often. Volt Switch helps Chinchou pivot effectively and is good with Electric-type STAB. It also provides a lot of momentum. Ice Beam is used to hit the Grass-types that threaten Chinchou, namely Foongus and Cottonee. Hidden Power Ground OHKOes Magnemite, 3HKOes Croagunk, and almost always 2HKOes opposing Chinchou, the latter two of which sometimes can be caught on a switch in, but it isn't very powerful otherwise. Thunder Wave lets Chinchou cripple faster switchins and allows it to more reliably handle Vullaby.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Chinchou has maximum Defense as well as a Bold nature to help circumvent its mediocre base Defense stat and help it endure many physical attacks, particularly from Flying-types. It has enough Speed to outspeed Croagunk and Dragon Dance Corphish. Extra investment is put into Special Attack to help Chinchou score more KOs than it would have otherwise against the likes of Rufflet and Snivy. The remaining EVs are put into HP to help it survive more attacks. The SpA EVs can also be moved to SpD to let it avoid KOs such as Focus Sash Abra's Energy Ball from full health and Life Orb Gastly's Sludge Bomb after Stealth Rock. Alternatively, a faster EV spread of 52 Def / 228 SpA / 220 Spe lets it reach the important 17 Speed tier at the cost of bulk. Volt Absorb should always be used on Chinchou because it lets it check many more threats, and it doesn't need Water Absorb, as it already resists Water-type attacks. Berry Juice gives Chinchou the recovery it desperately needs and is very useful in general.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Chinchou set should be used as a fairly liberal pivot. It can be safely switched in on most Flying- and Electric-types such as Doduo and Magnemite. If your opponent lacks an Electric-immune Pokemon, feel free to use Volt Switch on almost every turn Chinchou is out, as it can severely weaken the opposing team for a sweeper to clean up. Be careful when switching into opposing U-turn users such as Vullaby and Rufflet if your opponent has a Diglett, as they can switch out and immediately trap and KO Chinchou. However, if your opponent has their own Chinchou or a Ground-type, luring it in and knocking it out with a Hidden Power Ground or a Scald can quickly turn the tides of battle. If you have a free turn in which you predict the opponent to switch in one of Chinchou's checks or counters, it may be a good idea to cleanse your team of status with Heal Bell. If you predict an Electric-type move, switching in Chinchou can restore some of its health and make it even more of a nuisance to your opponent.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Berry Juice is Chinchou's only recovery, Wish support from Spritzee can be very appreciated. Mienfoo, another great pivot, can form a great core with Chinchou that is quite hard for foes to deal with. Any U-turn or Volt Switch user, such as Vullaby, Magnemite, or Rufflet, can also do this, but Mienfoo does so particularly well thanks to Regenerator. Similarly, Regenerator users such as Mareanie and Foongus obviously appreciate Chinchou constantly bringing them in and out. Other Water-types, particularly offensive ones, can handle Ground-types while Chinchou can cure their status ailments and check Electric-types. Overcoat Vullaby can help against Foongus and is a generally good Pokemon. Snivy and Pumpkaboo handle Pokemon such as Diglett and Drilbur that revenge kill Chinchou, while Chinchou in return can check Fire- and Flying-types.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is a very powerful Water-type STAB move that can 2HKO Pawniard and Mienfoo. Volt Switch is a fairly effective Electric-type STAB move that helps Chinchou gain more momentum and makes it quite a good pivot. Ice Beam is good against the Grass- and Ground-types that give Chinchou trouble, mostly Foongus. Scald is a second option for Chinchou to have a 100% accurate Water-type STAB move and is usually useful when trying to eliminate a threat without switching out. Hidden Power Ground can surprise opposing Chinchou and Croagunk that expect to switch into a Volt Switch or Scald, respectively. Thunderbolt is a more reliable Electric-type STAB move, because it lets Chinchou stay in, that is best used on teams that already have good switch-ins to opposing Chinchou and Croagunk.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf gives Chinchou a great Speed tier and makes it an effective revenge killer. Near-maximum Special Attack investment helps Chinchou revenge kill more easily. Similarly, it has maximum Speed and a Timid nature to outspeed certain boosted threats such as +1 Carvanha and Corphish. The rest of the EVs are put into Defense to help Chinchou survive longer against the threats it likes to switch into, like Doduo and Rufflet. Volt Absorb should always be used, as Chinchou already resists Water-type attacks and therefore doesn't need to utilize Water Absorb.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The main function of this set is to revenge kill faster threats. Switching into Electric-type attacks is Chinchou's only form of recovery, and it should therefore be utilized against threats such as opposing Chinchou, Magnemite, and Ponyta; the former two sometimes use Hidden Power Ground, though, so be careful. Although this set is a good Flying-type check, if Chinchou is low on HP, avoid switching it into powerful Flying-types, as it can be better utilized as a revenge killer. If your opponent lacks an Electric-immune Pokemon, spamming Volt Switch can quick wear down even bulky Pokemon to a point where a sweeper can take over.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Chinchou partners well with sweepers such as Vullaby and Timburr that can take advantage of it wearing down threats. Water-type sweepers, such as Corphish and Tirtouga, help each other wear down Grass-type threats and finish off a game with a sweep. Stealth Rock support from the likes of Onix and Ferroseed helps Chinchou break through Sturdy users such as Magnemite and Dwebble more easily. Other Volt Switch or U-turn users, such as Vullaby and Mienfoo, can be utilized well with Chinchou and force switches easily. Fire- and Flying-types can easily KO the Grass-types that Chinchou brings in and can be brought in through Volt Switch with ease.</p>"

  "Natu": {
    "overview": "<p>Natu carves itself a niche as the only Magic Bounce user in the tier, making it function as a great entry hazard and status deterrent for both offensive and defensive teams alike. It boasts a wide movepool with access to Roost, U-turn, and Thunder Wave for utility purposes and coverage options like Heat Wave, Sucker Punch, and Giga Drain. Furthermore, it has decent Special Attack when invested and hits a respectable 17 Speed, giving it some offensive presence. Natu also has a good typing, granting an immunity to Ground and a 4x resistance to Fighting, and this typing paired with its movepool and Magic Bounce ability allows it to counter key defensive Pokemon like Foongus and Ferroseed. However, its typing leaves it easily trapped by Pursuit and weak to Knock Off, which are carried by many Fighting-types it would otherwise check. Additionally, because of Natu's many weaknesses, it often loses to common entry hazard setters such as Onix, Dwebble, and Pawniard due to their Rock- or Dark-type moves as well as faster Pokemon such as Staryu and Doduo due to their coverage options. Lastly, even after investment, Natu has mediocre bulk, making it hard for Natu to take stronger attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Natu can use dual screens with Light Clay to support the team, but Alolan Vulpix outclasses Natu in this role due to its access to Aurora Veil with Snow Warning. Tailwind doubles the Speed of Natu's teammates for four turns, allowing its slower teammates to outpace foes, but has a hard time fitting on a set. Haze eliminates stat changes, preventing sweepers from setting up on Natu, but is tough to fit on a set. Shadow Ball is an option to hit Psychic- and Ghost-types; however, Natu has better moves like U-turn and Sucker Punch to deal with these Pokemon. Wish is an option on Natu to restore HP for its allies, but Natu does not have sufficient bulk or adequate typing to make good use of this and is outclassed in this role by Spritzee. A set using Trick + Choice Scarf can be used to hinder walls by stealing their Eviolite, but this is not very consistent because of Natu's frailty.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Alolan Grimer and Pawniard are immune to Psychic and can trap Natu with Pursuit, but the latter should be wary of Heat Wave when switching in. Vullaby and Scraggy can switch in on Psychic and easily OHKO Natu with Knock Off, but they must watch out for Dazzling Gleam.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Magnemite is resistant to Psychic, can survive an attack with Sturdy, and OHKOes Natu with Volt Switch. Chinchou Speed ties with offensive Natu, while Elekid outspeeds it—both can KO Natu with Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: While they may not be able to set up Stealth Rock when Natu is on the field, Dwebble, Onix, and Tirtouga easily KO Natu with a Rock-type move, though the last two should be careful of the rare Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gastly outspeeds and OHKOes Natu but should watch for Sucker Punch. Frillish and Pumpkaboo are able to wall Natu and 2HKO it with Shadow Ball, though Frillish should be careful of the rare Giga Drain, and Pumpkaboo cannot switch in on Heat Wave.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Natu's only average Speed, it is outsped by faster Pokemon such as Doduo, Abra, and Staryu, as well as Choice Scarf users like Magnemite and Rufflet, which are able to KO Natu with strong coverage moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic is able to OHKO Mienfoo as well as Foongus and Timburr after Stealth Rock damage. Heat Wave is used to damage Steel-types that would otherwise wall Natu, such as Ferroseed, Magnemite, and Pawniard. Dazzling Gleam trades hitting Steel-types for hitting Dark-types such as Vullaby and destroys Scraggy, both of which are immune to Psychic. U-turn allows Natu to gains momentum for the team and pivot out of a bad matchup while doing some chip damage. Roost restores the HP taken from Life Orb recoil and other attacks and can play mind games with Sucker Punch users like Pawniard. Sucker Punch can be used instead as priority to hit faster Pokemon, such as Gastly, Abra, and weakened Choice Scarf users. Giga Drain is also an option to hit Water- and Rock-types like Shellder and Omanyte while recovering HP; however, it doesn't provide as much coverage as Natu's other moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread optimizes Natu's offensive capabilities, inclining towards Special Attack due to Psychic being its primary attack. Life Orb gives Natu some much-needed power, as it increases the damage output of all attacks used at the cost of some HP; as such, 19 HP IVs or less are required to minimize the recoil damage taken from Life Orb. A Naive nature is used to maximize Speed while not hindering the power of U-turn and Sucker Punch. Magic Bounce is the only ability Natu should have, as it provides utility in blocking status moves, preventing Natu from being crippled by status ailments such as paralysis and sleep.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Natu discourages the use of entry hazards from the likes of Onix and Dwebble when it is alive and can function as a lead to inhibit the thought of the opponent using them really early. However, it should use U-turn right away to switch out of all relevant Stealth Rock users other than Ferroseed, which it can beat if carrying Heat Wave, as it normally loses to them one-on-one. Onix is an exception, as it Speed ties with Natu, making it safer to just manually switch. U-turn is also a great move to use early-game, as it provides offensive momentum and deals chip damage against foes switching in on Natu for its teammates to KO later on. Natu's poor bulk doesn't allow it to take many unresisted hits, meaning that it should often be brought in on safe switches, such as from a slow U-turn or Volt Switch. However, if you predict that your opponent will use a status move, Natu can switch in to reflect the status back to the user, potentially crippling it or its team. Roost can also be used when predicting a switch to restore HP and to play mind games with Sucker Punch. Lastly, avoid keeping Natu on the field when the opponent has an Alolan Grimer or Pawniard, as they can easily Pursuit trap it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Diglett is an exceptional partner to Natu, as it can get rid of Alolan Grimer, Pawniard, Electric-types, and Rock-types, while Natu can pivot it in safely with U-turn. U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Chinchou, Magnemite, and Vullaby are able to bring Natu in safely and form VoltTurn cores. Fighting-types like Mienfoo and Timburr can dispose of Dark-, Rock-, and Steel-types, which can be troublesome for Natu. Alolan Grimer and Pawniard are able to Pursuit trap Ghost-types, which Natu is weak to. Pokemon weak to Fighting- and Poison-types, such as Carvanha and Snivy, benefit from Natu's ability to check these Pokemon. Shell Smash users such as Tirtouga and Dwebble are able to more easily set up and net many KOs thanks to Natu bouncing entry hazards back to the opposing side. Additionally, the aforementioned Pokemon, as well as Magnemite, especially appreciate entry hazards being cleared, as they otherwise break their Sturdy.</p>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic hits Poison- and Fighting-types super effectively, such as Foongus, Timburr, and Mareanie. Roost provides a reliable form of recovery, which extends Natu's longevity. Heat Wave allows Natu to counter Ferroseed, dealing incredible damage to it, and it can also hit Pawniard on the switch. U-turn allows Natu to switch out while doing chip damage and provides offensive momentum. Thunder Wave can cripple faster Pokemon such as Gastly, Staryu, and Doduo on the switch, making them easier for Natu's teammates to handle.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Magic Bounce is Natu's main niche and allows it to counter certain defensive Pokemon like Ferroseed and Foongus by bouncing back entry hazards and other status moves. 196 HP EVs maximize Natu's HP stat and, coupled with 156 Defense EVs and a Bold nature, allow Natu to take physical hits better—notably, it usually avoids the 2HKO from Ferroseed's and Croagunk's Knock Off. 36 Special Attack EVs are used to allow Natu to OHKO Mienfoo with Psychic and Ferroseed with Heat Wave after minimal chip damage. The rest are put into Special Defense to hit an Eviolite-optimal number and Speed to outspeed Croagunk and slow Mienfoo.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Natu is used to primarily counter certain defensive Pokemon such as Foongus and Ferroseed, as its ability Magic Bounce prevents them from using status moves and entry hazards such as Spore and Stealth Rock against it while it can beat them with Psychic and Heat Wave, respectively. Natu also counters Croagunk, as it is able to switch into any of Croagunk's attacks and OHKO it with Psychic while also being able to provide offensive momentum with U-turn if these Pokemon decide to switch out into a counter. U-turn can also be used whenever Natu wants to safely bring in another Pokemon to set up or pressure an opposing Pokemon. With Magic Bounce, Natu discourages entry hazard setters like Onix and Ferroseed from using Stealth Rock and Spikes, and as such, Natu should be kept alive as long as the opponent can still use those Pokemon. Due to this, it can be used as a lead to prohibit the use of entry hazards of said Pokemon in the early turns and can KO Ferroseed with Heat Wave. It should, however, not stay in on most hazard setters such as Onix and Dwebble, since they beat Natu with super effective moves. Be especially careful of using Natu when the opponent has Alolan Grimer or Pawniard, as their access to Pursuit allows them to trap Natu and dispose of it. Natu is still quite passive and can be setup bait for Pokemon such as Vullaby and Scraggy, as they don't take much damage from its attacks. Lastly, Natu can use Thunder Wave on predicted switches to cripple the incoming foe, making it easier for Natu's teammates to handle.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting-types such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Scraggy can check Dark-, Rock-, and Steel-types that can trouble Natu and appreciate Natu's ability to get rid of Poison-types like Croagunk and Foongus. Diglett is an amazing partner, as it is able to trap and KO most of Natu's checks and counters, such as Alolan Grimer, Pawniard, and Magnemite, while Natu can deter entry hazards and bring it in safely with U-turn. Water-types such as Chinchou, Corphish, and Shellder benefit from Natu's ability to counter Foongus and Ferroseed and pivot the Water-types in safely, with Chinchou being able to form a VoltTurn core with Natu. Sturdy users such as Tirtouga and Magnemite especially appreciate entry hazards being bounced back to the opposing side by Natu, as it prevents their Sturdy from being broken. Other Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock, such as Ponyta, Doduo, and Rufflet, are also helped by Natu being able to bounce entry hazards back. Dark-types such as Alolan Grimer, Pawniard, and Vullaby counter Ghost-types that can trouble Natu, with the first two being able to Pursuit trap them.</p>"

It also has access to interesting support options such as Yawn, Encore, and Haze. However, Wooper's low offensive stats mean that it can often be setup bait. Its bulk is also low for a defensive Pokemon, especially on the special side, meaning that powerful wallbreakers such as Life Orb Doduo and Abra will easily be able to break it. In addition, both of Wooper's STAB moves are resisted by Grass-types, which also threaten it with a 4x super effective STAB move, meaning that it is easily countered by common Pokemon such as Pumpkaboo-XL and Foongus. Its weakness to Grass also means it has to be very careful of Grass-type coverage on certain Pokemon such as Ponyta and Clamperl that it would otherwise be able to check.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An Unaware set is an option to wall common setup sweepers such as Nasty Plot Vullaby and Bulk Up Timburr, but Wooper can't do much to them other than force them out with Yawn, and if its Eviolite is removed by Knock Off, it is usually unable to continue walling the setup sweeper. Waterfall is an option over Scald as a STAB move that comes off of Wooper's higher Attack stat, but the burn chance from Scald is very important to cripple physical attackers, and due to Wooper's low Speed, it is unable to utilize Waterfall's flinch chance. Wooper can utilize a Curse set with Waterfall, Earthquake, and Recover, but this is heavily outclassed by other bulky setup sweepers such as Timburr and Munchlax, does not boost Wooper's lower Special Defense, and is easily walled by most Grass-types. Toxic is an option over Yawn or Encore to allow Wooper to potentially stall out its foe, but the damage doesn't ramp up very quickly due to Little Cup's low HP stats, and the opponent can simply switch out to reset the timer, making it an inferior choice. Similarly, Haze is an option to prevent Wooper from being setup bait, but it is usually outclassed by Yawn, as the latter also forces a switch, which can rack up entry hazard damage on the opponent's team; however, Haze can bypass Substitute. Ice Beam and Ice Punch are both options to hit Grass-types, but Wooper struggles to find room for them, as it would have to give up Scald's chance to burn, Earthquake's ability to hit the Electric- and Water-types it checks, Recover's longevity, or the ability to avoid being setup bait with Yawn and Encore. They should generally be used over either Earthquake or Scald, but Scald's burn chance and Earthquake's ability to dent the Electric-types Wooper wants to counter are usually preferred.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Pumpkaboo-XL, Snivy, and Foongus can all take any hit from Wooper and hit back hard with a 4x effective STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Powerful attackers such as Life Orb Doduo and Abra will easily be able to break through Wooper's relatively low defenses.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: If Wooper loses its Eviolite, it becomes quite frail, meaning it will be easily broken through. Pokemon such as Pawniard and Alolan Grimer always carry Knock Off, which removes Wooper's Eviolite.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burn and poison both can significantly reduce Wooper's longevity and will force it to use Recover more often than it wants to.</p>",

Recover gives Wooper reliable recovery, thus greatly increasing its longevity. Earthquake is a more powerful, secondary STAB move that hits the Water-types that Wooper checks neutrally. It also hits Electric-types like Chinchou and Magnemite very hard, meaning that Wooper is a reliable answer to them, while also heavily damaging Steel-types like Pawniard. Yawn forces Pokemon that are trying to set up on Wooper to switch out or fall asleep, preventing their sweep. Encore can lock a foe into a status move, potentially giving one of Wooper's teammates a setup opportunity while also potentially preventing foes from setting up on Wooper if you predict correctly. However, due to Wooper's low Speed, it will usually move after its foe, meaning that good prediction is required in order to lock foes into the right move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Defense and HP EVs in combination with an Eviolite significantly raise Wooper's physical bulk and hit an Eviolite number, thus maximizing its physical bulk. They also allow Wooper to nearly always avoid the 2HKO from offensive Vullaby's Brave Bird and the OHKO from Shellder's Icicle Spear after a Shell Smash. The Special Defense EVs with a boosting nature raise Wooper's special bulk a lot and also hit an Eviolite number, maximizing its special bulk. It also notably allows Wooper to nearly always take the rare Hidden Power Grass from Chinchou as well as two Psychics from Elekid. Water Absorb allows Wooper to completely counter certain Water-types such as Chinchou and Staryu. Unaware may seem appealing in order to check setup sweepers, but due to Wooper's lackluster bulk, it can't check setup sweepers if its Eviolite is removed by Knock Off and will never be able to beat strong setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Doduo and Bulk Up Rufflet. A Sassy nature is used to raise Wooper's Special Defense and not lower the power of Scald or Earthquake, and Wooper is so slow that the drop in Speed will almost never matter.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Always switch Wooper into Water-types it counters, like Chinchou, Skrelp, and Mareanie. Aside from stopping them in their tracks, Wooper will be able to get some of its HP back if it's hit by a Water-type move and also use Recover if it needs to. Also, don't be afraid to switch Wooper into other Pokemon it can take on, such as Magnemite or Ponyta, as they will usually be forced to switch out, allowing Wooper to Recover or potentially cripple a switch-in with a Scald burn. In addition, Wooper can sap momentum from an opponent by switching into Volt Switch from Pokemon like Magnemite and Chinchou. Be wary of Grass-type coverage on certain threats that Wooper would otherwise be able to wall, such as Elekid's Hidden Power Grass or Ponyta's Bloom Doom or Solar Beam. Wooper relies on its Eviolite to take as many hits as it possibly can, and losing it will significantly cripple it; as such, avoid switching into Knock Off users such as Pawniard and Alolan Grimer. Avoid using Scald if the opponent has a Guts user like Timburr, as it will become a significant threat to your team if it gets burned. Yawn can be used on a predicted switch, as it will immediately force the opponent to switch again. This is especially useful if Wooper's team has set up entry hazards, as it will wear down the foe. When Wooper is in against a setup sweeper, it should always use its choice of Yawn or Encore, as it can otherwise easily be set up on. Afterwards, it should usually switch out, since it is unable to significantly threaten common setup sweepers like Nasty Plot Vullaby, while both Yawn and Encore can potentially give a free turn to an ally.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wooper should only be used on slower teams, since it can sap a lot of momentum, and even then only on teams that absolutely need a check to Water- and Electric-types, as Wooper is unable to do much else. Pokemon such as Corphish and Archen appreciate Wooper taking on the Water- and Electric-types that check them throughout the game. Pokemon that can take Knock Off like Snubbull and Mienfoo are appreciated, as Wooper hates losing its Eviolite. Pokemon such as Foongus, Vullaby, and Ponyta can switch into the Grass-types that Wooper fears. Foongus also appreciates Wooper checking Fire-types, Vullaby appreciates Wooper countering Electric-types, and Ponyta appreciates Wooper taking on Water-types. Since Wooper tends to switch in a lot, entry hazard removers such as Staryu and Vullaby are good teammates. Similarly, entry hazard setters such as Ferroseed and Onix work well with Wooper, as it forces a lot of switches from opposing Water- and Electric-types. Clerics such as Spritzee and the aforementioned Snubbull can remove status such as burn and poison from Wooper, increasing its longevity.</p>"

  "Pineco": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to a great ability in Sturdy, a great Defense stat, and access to Stealth Rock, Spikes, Toxic Spikes, Rapid Spin, and Explosion, Pineco can function as a great suicide lead, as it can usually ensure that it gets its own entry hazards up while preventing your opponent from setting theirs up. However, Pineco is incredibly one-dimensional. Opponents will easily be able to predict a Pineco lead and act accordingly. Oftentimes, they will be able to set up on it, as it's very passive. It also has a very low Speed stat, meaning it will often be unable to set up multiple entry hazards and then go for Explosion. In addition, your team needs to prevent your opponent from removing Pineco's entry hazards in order to take advantage of them. Thus, a spinblocker and a Defiant user are mandatory, which restricts teambuilding a lot. Lastly, Pineco faces a lot of competition from the faster, stronger, and more versatile Dwebble.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic Spikes can be used on more defensive teams to stall out foes, but the damage doesn't rack up very quickly due to the small HP stats in Little Cup, which makes Spikes and Stealth Rock usually better. A defensive set with Mental Herb is an option to set up entry hazards against Taunt users such as Mienfoo and Onix, but it is more easily knocked out due to the lack of recovery. Endure is an option to regain Sturdy after it has been broken, but Pineco struggles to find the moveslot for it and Sturdy usually won't be broken without Pineco being knocked into Berry Juice range, meaning Endure won't come into play often.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users such as Mienfoo, Onix, and Stunky can prevent Pineco from setting up entry hazards. Onix can also set up its own Stealth Rock, while Stunky can remove any entry hazards Pineco had already set up with Defog.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: Rapid Spin and Defog users such as Drilbur, Staryu, and Vullaby can undo all of Pineco's hard work by removing its entry hazards. Drilbur can also bypass Sturdy thanks to Mold Breaker and thus OHKO Pineco with Rock Slide after a Swords Dance boost. Natu can prevent Pineco's hazards from going up at all thanks to its ability, Magic Bounce.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Due to Pineco's passive nature, setup sweepers such as Timburr, Scraggy, and Zigzagoon can easily gain boosts against it. They do not appreciate taking an Explosion, however.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is a great entry hazard that only requires one turn of setup in order to deal significant damage every time a Pokemon switches in and affects every Pokemon. Spikes is a secondary entry hazard that can be stacked and, if multiple layers are set up, deals significant damage to grounded Pokemon that switch in. Both Spikes and Stealth Rock can break Focus Sashes and Sturdy, enabling a potential sweep from one of Pineco's teammates. Rapid Spin is used to remove the opponent's entry hazards, which is great support for Pineco's team. Explosion does a large amount of damage and can provide a free switch for a teammate after Pineco has done its job. Payback is an option to hit the Ghost-types that might switch in to prevent Pineco from using Rapid Spin and absorb an Explosion.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The combination of Sturdy and Berry Juice usually guarantees that Pineco gets up at least one layer of entry hazards. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature gives Pineco 12 Speed, which allows it to outspeed Mudbray, Mareanie, and Rowlet, giving it more opportunities to set up its entry hazards. 236 Attack EVs allow Pineco's Explosion to hurt as much as possible. The remaining EVs are put into Defense to increase Pineco's already good physical bulk. They are not put into HP to make sure Pineco is always back up to full HP after consuming Berry Juice, thus regaining its Sturdy.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pineco should typically be used as a lead, as switching it into an attack or entry hazards will break its Sturdy and often leave it unable to set up entry hazards. Stealth Rock should almost always be the first move used, as it is a great entry hazard that can severely weaken the opponent's team over time. Use Rapid Spin if your opponent sets up their own entry hazards while Pineco is still in. Rapid Spin can also be used to break Sturdy on opposing entry hazard setters such as Onix and Dwebble. Explosion should be used against more offensive teams to take out or heavily dent a threat and only on the turn just before Pineco will be KOed, as otherwise you waste a potential layer of Spikes. Explosion can also be used on Pokemon that set up on Pineco to significantly hurt them or sometimes even take them out. Payback can be used on a predicted switch to a Ghost-type to deal significant damage to it. Pineco should always avoid being hit by Taunt, as it will be left unable to perform its role. Thus, it is usually recommended to switch out when Pineco is in against Taunt users such as Mienfoo and Onix.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spinblockers, such as Pumpkaboo-XL, Honedge, and Frillish, and Defog deterrents such as Pawniard are mandatory in order to prevent the opponent from removing Pineco's entry hazards after it goes down. Since Pineco is often setup bait, Encore Cottonee can be useful to make sure your opponent doesn't easily win in that way. Fast revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Mienfoo, Gastly, and Doduo can revenge kill sweepers that have set up on Pineco and appreciate Pineco's hazards. Similarly, Abra can deal with certain setup sweepers such as Timburr, and can be incredibly hard to switch into if entry hazards are on the field. Strong wallbreakers such as Corphish, Pawniard, and offensive Mudbray force a lot of switches, which takes advantage of Pineco's hazards.</p>"

  "Snubbull": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its Fairy typing and Intimidate, Snubbull acts as a reliable check to many metagame-defining Pokemon, including Mienfoo, Timburr, and Vullaby, and as a soft check to a slew of physical attackers. Numerous support options, including Heal Bell, Thief, and Thunder Wave, let Snubbull adequately support its team, and its good Attack, fantastic coverage options, and access to Bulk Up make it an immediate threat, generally outperforming other Fairy-types, most notably Spritzee, on offensive teams as a result. Although drawbacks in low Speed and a lack of built-in recovery mean that it is easily forced out and worn down, its coveted niche as an offensive Fighting-type check ensures that it remains very useful in the metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heal Bell is useful for teams that are vulnerable to status ailments, though Snubbull itself tends to fare poorly against common status users. A combination of Rest and Sleep Talk gives Snubbull a more reliable form of recovery, but such a set is generally done better by Wish + Aromatherapy Spritzee. Unlike Thief, Crunch OHKOes all common Gastly variants and can 2HKO Frillish and Pumpkaboo-XL after Stealth Rock; however, it offers almost no coverage otherwise. Facade lets Snubbull significantly damage Eviolite-less Larvesta and Ponyta once it has been burned, but provides no additional coverage and isn't very useful when Snubbull is healthy. Brick Break is an alternative Fighting-type coverage move over Close Combat, as it does not lower Snubbull's defenses, but is generally too weak to be worthwhile, failing to 2HKO Ferroseed and requiring Stealth Rock to OHKO Eviolite Pawniard. Power-Up Punch is even weaker to the point where even Pokemon weak to it don't initially mind it too much, meaning it is useless as a coverage move despite its tempting side effect. Roar helps Snubbull deal with setup sweepers, but Snubbull is generally strong enough to attempt to simply outright KO them. Though Taunt can somewhat hinder Ferroseed, Snubbull is generally too slow to properly take advantage of it. Super Fang can help ease prediction and somewhat threaten switch-ins, but Snubbull's coverage moves are more useful. Toxic cripples some bulkier switch-ins, but Snubbull's most common switch-ins, bulky Poison- and Steel-types, are immune to it, and Mudbray frequently runs Rest. Despite its uses against Ponyta in particular, Bulldoze is generally less useful than Earthquake because it is too weak to 2HKO Mareanie and activates Pawniard's Defiant.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Foongus is undoubtedly Snubbull's most prominent check, not minding Play Rough and Earthquake while being able to avoid a 2HKO from Fire Punch if it still has its Eviolite. Mareanie can also be troublesome although it is 2HKOed by Earthquake. Other Poison-types such as Gastly, Skrelp, Alolan Grimer, and Croagunk are weak to moves Snubbull commonly carries and may not resist Play Rough, but can force it out with the threat of STAB Poison-type attacks. Despite its rarity, Koffing deserves special mention for completely walling all Snubbull variants.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Though they don't want to deal with Snubbull's coverage moves, Magnemite and Ferroseed can come in on Play Rough or a utility move and force Snubbull out. Ferroseed loses to Fire Punch Snubbull but walls Earthquake variants. Pawniard is a special case in that it struggles to actually come in on Snubbull but is still an enormous threat to it due to the possibility of Intimidate or Play Rough activating Defiant.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fire-types</strong>: Larvesta is one of the most reliable answers to Snubbull, as it walls Snubbull completely, stops Snubbull from threatening its teammates with Will-O-Wisp, and remains healthy with Morning Sun. Defensive Ponyta is weak to Earthquake but can burn Snubbull if it gets in safely.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Extremely strong special attackers like Life Orb Houndour, Life Orb Abra, and Skrelp are generally able to OHKO Berry Juice Snubbull after Stealth Rock, easily forcing it out, but may lack the bulk to switch into Snubbull directly.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: If Snubbull lacks Bulk Up, physical walls such as Mudbray, Spritzee, and Slowpoke can attempt to shut it down. However, they dislike Snubbull thieving their Eviolites, so they should carry a setup or coverage move, such as Calm Mind on Spritzee, that lets them OHKO Berry Juice Snubbull. With some Attack investment, Mudbray can OHKO Berry Juice Snubbull with Heavy Slam provided it is not affected by Intimidate and can wall Snubbull even if it uses Thief to take Mudbray's Eviolite.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Berry Juice": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Play Rough is a strong STAB move that hits the Fighting- and Dark-types Snubbull is trying to check such as Mienfoo and Scraggy. Fire Punch can be used to heavily damage Ferroseed and somewhat threaten Foongus, especially if Foongus's Eviolite has been removed, but it leaves Snubbull walled by Fire-types and Mareanie. Earthquake provides good neutral coverage alongside Play Rough, dealing with Poison-, Steel-, and Fire-types like Mareanie, Magnemite, and Ponyta. Alternatively, Close Combat 2HKOes Ferroseed and OHKOes Pawniard and most Magnemite but leaves Snubbull completely walled by Poison-types and drastically reduces its staying power. Thief acts as a pseudo-Knock Off once Snubbull's Berry Juice has been activated or removed, allowing Snubbull to cripple switch-ins and potentially snag a useful Eviolite or Berry Juice. Bulk Up gives Snubbull the means to break through certain bulkier switch-ins and allows it to significantly threaten slower teams that lack a solid check to Fairy-types. Thunder Wave can annoy faster switch-ins such as Ponyta and supports the sweeping attempts of slow but powerful Pokemon like Timburr.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Defense EVs and an Impish nature allow Snubbull to better check predominantly physical Fighting-types, letting it avoid a 2HKO from 16 Attack Timburr's Poison Jab before factoring in Berry Juice as well as Mienfoo's U-turn into Life Orb Diglett's Earthquake after Stealth Rock. 116 Attack EVs give Snubbull the power to almost always OHKO sweeping Vullaby variants after Stealth Rock. 23 HP and 13 Special Defense, reached with an Impish nature, let Snubbull always survive +2 Vullaby's Air Slash from full health. An alternative Careful nature leaves Snubbull more prone to being trapped by Diglett, but allows it to survive +2 Vullaby's Air Slash after Stealth Rock more consistently. Faster spreads of 36 HP / 116 Atk / 116 Def / 116 SpD / 116 Spe to outrun slow Timburr, 36 HP / 116 Atk / 36 Def / 116 SpD / 196 Spe to outrun Mareanie and defensive Mudbray, and the latter EV spread with a Jolly nature to outrun Nasty Plot Croagunk and fast Timburr are viable, but the reduction in bulk leaves Snubbull much less reliable at checking Fighting-types and Vullaby. More Attack EVs can be run to get a few extra KOs, such as an OHKO on fast Eviolite Mienfoo after Stealth Rock with 17 Attack and the 2HKO on Foongus after Stealth Rock with Fire Punch and 18 Attack, but scenarios where the loss of bulk matters, as described above, tend to be more common. Intimidate gives Snubbull its niche as a blanket check to physical attackers. Berry Juice is Snubbull's only means of recovering its health and synergizes well with Thief.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch into predicted Knock Offs from Pokemon that Snubbull checks, notably including Mienfoo and Timburr, to immediately pressure the opposing team with Thief. Once Berry Juice has been activated or removed, aim to use Thief on a Pokemon that relies on Eviolite or Berry Juice, like Foongus or Magnemite, so that Snubbull gains bulk to better check its targets or even more longevity. Be careful of the opponent predicting Thief and switching to a Choice Scarf or Life Orb user, as those items cripple Snubbull. Do not switch Snubbull into Pawniard unless you are certain that it has a Choice Scarf and is locked into a resisted move, as Intimidate activates Defiant. For the same reason, be wary of double switches into Pawniard when switching Snubbull in on foes it obviously checks, which are mostly Fighting-types. Use Earthquake and Fire Punch on predicted Mareanie and Foongus switch-ins, respectively, as Snubbull will need to hit them on the switch to 2HKO them and they can easily shrug off damage dealt by Play Rough because of Regenerator. The same applies for faster Pokemon like Magnemite and Ponyta that don't mind Play Rough and can immediately force it out with the threat of a strong special attack or a burn. When predicting switch-ins that Snubbull can OHKO or come close to OHKOing with an unexpected coverage move, such as Ferroseed with Fire Punch or Close Combat, it is safer to only reveal such a coverage move after they have switched in so that Snubbull can act as a lure.</p> <p>Snubbull is a decent blanket check to physical attackers in general, soft checking threats like Archen and Drilbur. If Snubbull is too low in health to check a strong physical attacker, sacking Snubbull to activate Intimidate before it faints helps to make the attacker easier to deal with, but be wary of doing this against threats like Corphish, which can use the predicted sack to boost its Attack with Swords Dance or Dragon Dance instead of attacking; in addition, Intimidate will not activate if Snubbull faints to entry hazards upon switching in. Alternatively, against a physical attacker that cannot further boost its Attack, it may be worth sacking teammates to repeatedly activate Intimidate if none of Snubbull's teammates can withstand an attack after a single Attack drop. Entry hazards and weaker attacks can be taken advantage of to activate Berry Juice if Snubbull needs to take an attack it can only withstand from full health.</p> <p>Due to Snubbull's low Speed, the goal of Bulk Up is not usually to pull off a sweep. Use it frequently early-game if the opponent lacks a good Snubbull switch-in such as Foongus so that Snubbull can better pressure its foes with strong attacks. Bulk Up Snubbull does occasionally have a real shot at sweeping weaker physically offensive teams; in this case, saving Snubbull for a late-game sweep after its checks have been worn down is an option.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Snubbull is usable on a variety of teams, but best fits onto offensive teams that do not appreciate Spritzee's frequent loss of momentum. Its main role is as a Fighting-type and Vullaby check, which means it pairs well with Pokemon like Pawniard and Ferroseed; they appreciate a good switch-in to their checks. Switch-ins to the Poison-, Steel-, and Fire-types that force Snubbull out are needed; examples of Pokemon that synergize defensively with Snubbull include Slowpoke, Onix, and Munchlax. Diglett can also be used to trap and eliminate these checks to Snubbull. Pokemon that can come in on the strong special attackers that force Snubbull out like Life Orb Abra, such as Munchlax and Alolan Grimer, are appreciated. Stealth Rock support from the likes of Drilbur or Onix wears down switch-ins and lets Snubbull obtain some key KOs, such as an OHKO on offensive Vullaby with Play Rough. Even with Bulk Up, Snubbull is not very effective as a dedicated sweeper, so it should be run alongside stronger late-game threats whose checks it can wear down.</p>"
      },
      "Sub Snub (Substitute)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute is a powerful tool that allows Snubbull to gain momentum off of switches it forces against Fighting-type Pokemon and take advantage of its checks. Play Rough is Snubbull's best STAB attack, and it comes with the added bonus of potentially lowering the foe's Attack. Thief allows Snubbull to steal a foe's item after using its Berry Juice via Substitute or from taking attacks; this benefits the player both by giving Snubbull a new item and by removing key items from foe Pokemon. Fire Punch is able to consistently 2HKO both Ferroseed and Foongus—both common switch-ins to Snubbull—after Stealth Rock damage; this allows Snubbull to lure and KO them from behind a Substitute. Earthquake, on the other hand, is able to 2HKO many of Snubbull's other Poison-type switch-ins, such as Croagunk and Alolan Grimer. It also hits most Steel-type Pokemon harder than Fire Punch while also taking care of threatening Fire-types, and it handles Onix well, which otherwise renders Snubbull mostly helpless.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Intimidate is Snubbull's calling card, lowering the Attack of foes into which Snubbull switches by one stage. Berry Juice gives Snubbull useful recovery and allows it to take advantage of Substitute more freely. The choice between an Adamant or Jolly nature is entirely based on whether or not you want to outspeed standard Timburr sets. Without Adamant, however, Snubbull cannot 2HKO Eviolite Foongus from full HP with Fire Punch, nor can it OHKO Eviolite Timburr with Play Rough. Thus, Adamant is the recommended nature. The given EVs maximize Snubbull's Attack and Speed, allowing it to take advantage of slower foes with ease. 116 Defense EVs allow Snubbull's Substitute to avoid being broken by Timburr's Knock Off or Mach Punch and by Mienfoo's Drain Punch, Knock Off, or U-turn at -1 Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Snubbull into Fighting-type Pokemon as often as possible. This set is designed to create momentum specifically against Mienfoo and Timburr, so take advantage of them as much as possible. To this end, don't be timid in your use of Substitute! Creating a Substitute allows Snubbull to block status, take weak or resisted hits, and pressure the opponent. For example, bringing Snubbull in on a Timburr will often cause your opponent to switch out their Timburr for a Pokemon better equipped to take Snubbull's powerful Play Rough, such as Ferroseed or Foongus. If you use Substitute on the switch turn, Snubbull will now be safe from status moves and will be able to 2HKO them with the appropriate coverage move. Another use of Substitute is to activate Berry Juice to restore Snubbull's HP in order to survive a strong hit and fire off one of your own, as it will activate as soon as Snubbull is below 50% HP. Additionally, your opponent may not expect Snubbull to have Substitute, which will grant you the element of surprise and may be key to luring in those key switch-ins to Snubbull. In addition to being able to steal momentum from Timburr- and Mienfoo-wielding opponents, due to Intimidate, Snubbull is an effective check to most physical attackers that lack type advantage. Lastly, be cautious of taking a Knock Off; while it will remove Snubbull's valuable Berry Juice, it will also allow it to make great use of Thief. In essence, weigh the risk of not having recovery with the reward of a guaranteed item theft.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Any Pokemon that struggles to handle Fighting-types can find a great partner in Snubbull due to its overwhelming ability to pressure said Fighting-types. Prominent examples of these Pokemon include Pawniard, Omanyte, and Onix. In addition, powerful Water- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Corphish and Snivy appreciate Substitute Snubbull's ability to lure and remove threats such as Foongus, Ferroseed, Croagunk, and Alolan Grimer with its appropriate coverage move. Ground-type Pokemon have near-perfect offensive synergy with Fire Punch Snubbull, as they severely threaten the Steel- and Poison-types with which Snubbull struggles. Diglett is an extremely effective teammate due to the fact that it can trap and remove these Pokemon as opposed to merely threatening them. On the other hand, Fire-type Pokemon help take care of threats like Ferroseed that Earthquake Snubbull can't touch. While its offensive synergy is quite impressive, many Pokemon also have excellent defensive synergy with Snubbull; the best example is Ferroseed, which appreciates Snubbull's ability to check Fighting-types while taking care of the Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon to which Snubbull is vulnerable.</p>"
      },
      "Eviolite": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Play Rough serves as Snubbull's STAB attack, with which it forces out Fighting- and Dark-types such as Mienfoo. Earthquake and Fire Punch are Snubbull's best coverage options; Earthquake hits Fire-types and Mareanie, whereas Fire Punch is more threatening to Ferroseed and Foongus. Close Combat hits Pawniard harder and also does a good amount of damage to Ferroseed, but carries the drawback of lowering Snubbull's defenses and leaves it with no way of threatening Poison-types. As Snubbull will frequently be switching into Knock Off, Thief is useful for stealing an foe's Eviolite or Berry Juice and provide some chip damage. Thunder Wave cripples faster Pokemon like Gastly and pairs well with slow but threatening teammates such as Corphish. Bulk Up increases Snubbull's offensive presence and leaves it less easily walled on top of boosting its already impressive physical bulk.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature let Snubbull outpace all common Timburr and Croagunk variants. The given defensive EVs hit Eviolite-optimal numbers, granting Snubbull decent 23/18/18 bulk. 116 Attack EVs let Snubbull most notably OHKO offensive Vullaby after Stealth Rock. An Impish nature instead of Jolly lets Snubbull retain its ability to outspeed Mareanie and Mudbray and gives it the bulk to survive Mienfoo's U-turn into Diglett's Tectonic Rage, though it then ties with faster variants of Timburr and Croagunk. In general, with the extra bulk from Eviolite, Snubbull can be much more flexible with its EV spread and invest more heavily in bulk or Attack as seen fit. Intimidate is the preferred ability so that Snubbull can better check physical attackers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be wary of Snubbull's Intimidate activating Pawniard's Defiant. Save unexpected coverage moves that can heavily damage slower foes, such as Fire Punch for Ferroseed, until after they have switched in so that they are not scared off. Otherwise, try to hit foes on the switch with coverage moves. Thanks to Intimidate, Snubbull can beat most physical attackers, including Drilbur and Doduo. When Snubbull is low on health, it can be sacked against a physical attacker for Intimidate's Attack drop as long as it does not faint to entry hazards in the process; alternatively, against a particularly threatening physical attacker, it can be repeatedly sent in after teammates have been sacked to reactivate Intimidate. Although Bulk Up Snubbull can occasionally be played against a sweeper in especially favorable matchups, it is generally used whenever Snubbull is not attempting to immediately damage a switch-in so that Snubbull can fire off more threatening attacks. If Thief is run, try to use it on an Eviolite or Berry Juice holder such as Croagunk after Snubbull has been hit by Knock Off, as Snubbull can take advantage of these items. This set is preferable for offensive teams that use Snubbull as their sole check to Fighting-types, as the increased initial bulk makes Snubbull more difficult to KO with an unexpected coverage move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Snubbull tends to fit on teams leaning towards offense, as it competes with the more resilient but momentum-sapping Spritzee on defensive teams. It synergizes well with Pokemon such as Diglett, Drilbur, Ferroseed, and Slowpoke, which appreciate a Fighting- and Dark-type check and can deal with the Poison-, Steel-, and Fire-type Pokemon that Snubbull dislikes. Fire-types like Ponyta handle Foongus and Ferroseed. Lickitung has good type synergy with Snubbull and can pass Wishes to keep it healthy, but struggles to fit onto the fast-paced teams Snubbull tends to be included in. Offensive Stealth Rock setters like Onix pair well with Snubbull's decent offensive presence for Snubbull to more easily get KOs, such as a likely OHKO on Choice Scarf Pawniard with Earthquake.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Teddiursa can boost its mediocre Speed with the combination of a Toxic Orb and Quick Feet, which, in conjunction with its access to Facade, allows it to perform as a fairly fast and powerful sweeper. Quick Feet is a fantastic ability that essentially provides Teddiursa with a Choice Scarf after one turn in exchange for Toxic damage. After Quick Feet is activated, it outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame, and its high Attack stat and prevention of other status make it tough to handle. Despite this, Teddiursa is still outsped by Choice Scarf users, such as Mienfoo, Chinchou, and Pawniard. Teddiursa also has mediocre bulk, which means it can't switch into an attack for fear of being KOed. With Toxic constantly whittling down its health, Teddiursa is very susceptible to priority attacks like the common Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, both of which are super effective too.</p>",

      "Quick Feet": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thanks to Toxic Orb, Facade is boosted to a fearsome 140 Base Power, making it Teddiursa's strongest attack that allows it to OHKO or 2HKO a majority of the LC metagame. Crunch provides good coverage, hitting the Ghost-types that are immune to Facade, such as Gastly and Pumpkaboo-XL. Close Combat is another great coverage move that allows Teddiursa to hit the Steel- and Rock-types that resist Facade, such as Ferroseed and Pawniard. Protect stalls a turn, allowing Toxic Orb to activate and trigger Quick Feet, and allows for scouting the foe's move and playing Sucker Punch mind games with Pawniard. Swords Dance boosts Teddiursa's already high Attack stat to extreme heights, securing it more OHKOs, including on Mudbray and Foongus. However, Teddiursa will not be able to get a free turn to activate Toxic Orb without Protect, and its frailty provides it with limited opportunities to set up.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The 196 Attack EVs are crucial, enabling Teddiursa to guarantee a 2HKO on bulky Pokemon such as Mudbray and Foongus with Toxic-boosted Facade. With a Jolly nature and 196 EVs put into Speed, Teddiursa hits 14 Speed, which is boosted to 21 after Quick Feet is activated, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. The remaining EVs are put into HP, Defense, and Special Defense to give Teddiursa as much bulk as possible. Toxic Orb is used to activate Quick Feet, which gives it a huge Speed boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Teddiursa has poor bulk, so try to bring it in as safely as possible. Good ways to do this are through a free switch and with a slow pivot. A slow pivot is great because it also activates Toxic Orb at the end of the turn without Teddiursa first having to stall or risk being outsped for a turn. Teddiursa's poor bulk together with the Toxic damage means that it can hardly take any hits, so priority users such as Timburr, Pawniard, and Carvanha must be taken out before Teddiursa can clean an opponent's team. Bulky Pokemon that can't be OHKOed such as Spritzee must also be weakened beforehand. Teddiursa works best as a late-game cleaner that sweeps the enemy team once these and other threats such as Croagunk and Onix have been taken out and the enemy's team weakened.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teddiursa appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Onix, Dwebble, and Omanyte, as it can wear down the enemy team and break Sturdy, making it easier for Teddiursa to sweep. Teddiursa does not want to take damage from entry hazards due to it already being whittled down by Toxic Orb, so a Defogger or spinner such as Vullaby or Staryu make for excellent teammates. Knock Off users such as Mienfoo, Timburr, Pawniard, and Ferroseed help Teddiursa by getting rid of items on foes such as Eviolite, allowing it to break through walls more easily. This is especially useful against very bulky Pokemon like Spritzee that still aren't OHKOed after a Swords Dance and Stealth Rock damage. Fighting-types threaten Teddiursa greatly, so checks for those are needed; Spritzee and Foongus are two good Fighting-type checks that pair well with Teddiursa. Slow pivots such as Mienfoo, Chinchou, and Magnemite can bring in Teddiursa safely to allow it to sweep, as well as activating its Toxic Orb for free at the end of the turn. Pursuit trappers such as Pawniard and Alolan Grimer are able to trap Focus Sash Abra, which can revenge kill Teddiursa if its Focus Sash is still intact. Strong wallbreakers can help Teddiursa by dealing a lot of damage to the opponent's walls, allowing Teddiursa to KO them more easily. Pokemon such as Snivy and Staryu can threaten the Rock-types that resist Facade and make for good teammates as well.</p>"

  "Remoraid": {
    "overview": "<p>Remoraid is able to fit on offensive teams functioning as a revenge killer and cleaner, which is helped by great mixed attacking stats, a respectable 17 Speed tier, and a vast movepool. Water Spout is Remoraid's main selling point, as its high Base Power at full health allows Remoraid to significantly damage the opposition. Remoraid has access to coverage options such as Fire Blast to hit Grass-types and Bullet Seed for Water-types, which is boosted by Hustle. However, Hustle lowers the accuracy of physical moves, leading to unfortunate misses when using Bullet Seed. Additionally, Remoraid has terrible bulk, leaving it easily revenge killed by priority attacks such as Mach Punch and Sucker Punch. Lastly, it faces competition from other special Water-types such as Chinchou and Frillish, as they provide defensive utility and are more reliable.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Psychic can be used to specifically hit Mareanie and Croagunk as well as other Poison- and Fighting-types super effectively after Remoraid has taken some damage. Gunk Shot can smack Spritzee and OHKO Cottonee, but it is hard to make room for and has poor accuracy when paired with Hustle. Life Orb can be used over Choice Scarf for increased damage output and to freely choose moves, but it gradually decreases Water Spout's Base Power, and the loss of Speed makes Remoraid significantly easier to revenge kill. A physically oriented set can be ran with moves such as Waterfall, Rock Blast, and the aforementioned Gunk Shot and Bullet Seed, but Corphish generally does this better. Scald can be used as an accurate STAB move capable of inflicting burns, but the power drop is significant compared to Hydro Pump and Water Spout. Flamethrower is more accurate than Fire Blast; however, the damage output is much lower. Ice Beam hits the Grass- and Dragon-types that resist Water-type attacks super effectively, but Remoraid has better moves to hit the former, and the latter are uncommon in LC. Charge Beam can hit most Water-types super effectively, namely Mantyke, and usually gain a Special Attack boost, but it is still pretty weak. Seed Bomb does more reliable damage than Bullet Seed, but Bullet Seed is usually stronger due to LC's damage rolls.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Timburr, Pawniard, and Doduo are able to take advantage of Remoraid's poor bulk with Mach Punch, Sucker Punch, and Quick Attack, respectively, and either KO it after some chip damage or reduce the Base Power of Water Spout.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Foongus, Pumpkaboo, and Cottonee resist Water Spout and easily OHKO Remoraid with Giga Drain, but they have to be careful of Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Chinchou and Staryu resist Water-type moves and OHKO Remoraid with an Electric-type attack but must be wary of Bullet Seed. Mareanie and Skrelp take neutral damage from Bullet Seed, and the latter OHKOes Remoraid with Sludge Wave.</p> <p><strong>Water-immune Pokemon</strong>: Frillish and Croagunk are immune to Water Spout thanks to their abilities and can deal a lot of damage to Remoraid, with the latter also having priority in both Vacuum Wave and Sucker Punch; however, it should be wary of the rare Psychic, while the former has to watch out for Bullet Seed.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Residual damage from the likes of weather, entry hazards, and burns chip away Remoraid's health, reducing Water Spout's power and forcing it to rely on inaccurate moves like Hydro Pump.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Water Spout is Remoraid's strongest STAB move when at full health at a whopping 150 Base Power, dealing significant damage to most Pokemon that don't resist it. Whenever Remoraid is below 75% of its maximum HP, it should use Hydro Pump, as Water Spout becomes weaker than it, though it does have a chance to miss. Fire Blast is used to hit the Grass-types that resist Water Spout, namely OHKOing Ferroseed. Bullet Seed is used to smack Water-types such as Staryu, Omanyte, and Kabuto and benefits from LC's multi-hit rolls, as it deals more damage than Seed Bomb usually.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Special Attack and Speed investment optimize Remoraid's offensive capabilities. Hustle is the ability of choice, as it boosts Remoraid's Attack stat by 1.5x, increasing Bullet Seed's damage output at the cost of its accuracy. A Naive nature boosts Speed without lowering the damage output of Bullet Seed. When paired with a Choice Scarf, Remoraid Speed ties with 17 Speed Choice Scarf users such as Mienfoo and Chinchou and outspeeds everything below them, making it easy for Remoraid to significantly damage teams with Water Spout.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Remoraid should always be at full health, as it functions the best when Water Spout is at its most powerful. As such, it should never switch directly into any Pokemon because it risks losing power on Water Spout and being KOed. Rather, it should be brought in safely after a KO or by a slow U-turn or Volt Switch. Furthermore, try to avoid taking damage from entry hazards and status, since they lower the Base Power of Water Spout. Lastly, if the opponent has a Frillish or Croagunk, be careful of locking Remoraid into Water Spout or Hydro Pump, which they're immune to, as this will kill all momentum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spinners such as Staryu, Drilbur, and Kabuto remove any entry hazards that damage Remoraid upon switch in, which reduces the power of Water Spout. Slower users of Volt Switch and U-turn can bring Remoraid in safely. Vullaby is a great partner to Remoraid, as it counters Grass-types such as Foongus and Pumpkaboo-XL, can remove Eviolites with Knock Off, can bring Remoraid in safely with U-turn, and can remove hazards with Defog. Grass-types such as Foongus, Pumpkaboo-XL, and Cottonee resist both of Remoraid's weaknesses in Electric and Grass and can deal with Water-types. Entry hazard support from the likes of Onix, Ferroseed, and Dwebble deal chip damage to the foe, allowing Remoraid to net KOs a lot more easily. Knock Off users such as Pawniard, Timburr, and Mienfoo are able to soften up many Pokemon by removing their Eviolites, making it tremendously easier for Remoraid to clean up.</p>"

  "Houndour": {
    "overview": "<p>Houndour is one of LC's premier wallbreakers with a STAB combination resisted only by the frail Carvanha, opposing Houndour, and the largely unviable Deino. As a result, only a handful of Pokemon are able to switch into Houndour and even less can manage to more than once. STAB Sucker Punch helps Houndour fend off quicker foes as well, helping to augment its only okay Speed. Houndour's typing is quite lackluster defensively, however, as not only is Houndour weak to the ever-common Fighting-, Water-, and Ground-types in the tier, but it is also frail. This means Houndour is frequently forced out if it cannot KO what is in front of it, which is particularly bad because Houndour is weak to Stealth Rock. It also suffers from being weak to Mach Punch, Aqua Jet, and Vacuum Wave, all quite common priority moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A fully physical set might seem appealing for a stronger Sucker Punch, yet it is unviable due to Fire Fang being far too weak to pick up key OHKOs and 2HKOs. Z-Sunny Day sets with Firium Z are technically viable options but are better done by the faster and bulkier Ponyta. Similarly, Nasty Plot sets can completely sweep slower teams, but it is pretty bad outside that specific matchup and seldom worthwhile. It is also rather hard to safely set up a Nasty Plot due to Houndour's middling bulk. Beat Up is a cool alternative to Snarl, but at least 3 of your Pokemon need to be alive, and the benefit is largely nonexistent. Crunch can be somewhat viable in an effort to lure and KO Munchlax on the Life Orb set, but it is otherwise worse than Dark Pulse and requires more EVs to be invested in Attack. Early Bird is a viable alternative ability that's useful for switching into Spores and Sleep Powder, but it relies on getting early wakes to excel. Using Early Bird also has the downside of losing to opposing Flash Fire Houndour and no longer being powered up by Pumpkaboo and Ponyta's Fire-type attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Super Effective Priority</strong>: Houndour is frail enough to be KOed from full HP by Timburr's Mach Punch or Carvanha's Aqua Jet, and Houndour has little counterplay against this, often forcing it out. These priority users struggle to switch in, however.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon that resist one of Houndour's STAB options can switch in, though only on the resisted attack. Specially defensive Berry Juice Pokemon are able to counter once, with the exception of Munchlax which persistently counters, but it must beware potentially switching into Life Orb Flame Charge and then finished off with one of Houndour's STAB moves. Other common bulky Pokemon that can check Houndour include Mareanie, Mudbray, and Spritzee, although the latter can't hit back for much damage.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to Houndour's only okay Speed, a good number of Pokemon are able to revenge kill it, assuming they are at full health. For example, defensive Staryu is able to switch into Life Orb Houndour and KO back, though only one time unless it can successfully use Recover. Choice Scarf Mienfoo is a reliable check to Houndour as well due to it resisting Sucker Punch, though it cannot switch in. Choice Scarf Chinchou can also check Houndour rather well but only if it is outside of Sucker Punch KO range.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast is Houndour's most powerful attack, 2HKOing everything that does not resist Fire. Its raw power makes it preferable over Flamethrower, which often fails to secure the same 2HKOs and OHKOs. Dark Pulse is a far more reliable STAB move and Houndour's best option for a special Dark-type STAB move; Dark Pulse 2HKOs certain Pokemon that resist Fire such as Staryu, Slowpoke, and usually even Ponyta as well, and it is very spammable. Sucker Punch helps Houndour handle faster Pokemon seeking to abuse its mediocre Speed and abysmal defenses to revenge kill it. Flame Charge allows Houndour to trouble teams lacking super effective priority and again helps offset Houndour's average Speed and helps it outspeed Doduo, Gastly, and most Choice Scarf users. Pursuit is another option to give Houndour more defensive utility, reliably trapping spinblockers for Staryu and Drilbur.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb is the item of choice to make Houndour hit incredibly hard while retaining the flexibility of switching moves. HP IVs are lowered to 9 in order to allow Houndour to hit 19 HP and take less Life Orb recoil. Flash Fire allows Houndour to potentially take advantage of opposing offensive Fire-types, such as Ponyta packing Flame Charge as its fourth move. Flash Fire also makes opposing Pumpkaboo hesitant about using Will-O-Wisp, potentially punishing the play. The EV spread aims to make Houndour hit hard and fast, hence the heavy investment into Speed and Special Attack. A Naive nature is used so Houndour can check Pawniard better by outspeeding it and taking less from Sucker Punch while keeping both its Attack and Special Attack as high as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Houndour best switches in after one of its teammates has been KOed or via a slow U-turn or Volt Switch. Generally, Houndour should avoid switching in on most Pokemon. Some exceptions can be made to Pumpkaboo, Pawniard, and Ponyta, as Houndour is able to check these Pokemon by the virtue of its Dark / Fire typing and access to Flash Fire, yet Houndour can still only switch in once or twice. Outside of these three Pokemon, Houndour should almost never be switched into play. Additionally, Houndour should only be brought into play when it is capable of KOing the opposing Pokemon. Typically, Houndour aims to take advantage of passive Pokemon, such as Pumpkaboo, Foongus, or Ferroseed, to fire off its powerful attacks or get off a Flame Charge to outspeed the opponent's team. If Pursuit is being used, Houndour should switch directly into Pumpkaboo in order to threaten it with Fire Blast and Pursuit trap it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Houndour appreciates entry hazard removal from the likes of Staryu or Drilbur, as otherwise it struggles to be nearly as effective when Stealth Rock is up. Pursuit variants of Houndour can trap spinblockers for Staryu and Drilbur too, allowing them to better perform their role. Knock Off users are great teammates as well, softening up teams by removing Eviolites and making Houndour that much harder to handle. Dark-types in general appreciate Houndour's raw power and ability to remove their shared checks, making Pawniard, Vullaby, and Scraggy decent partners for Houndour. Fighting-type checks such as Snubbull, Foongus, and Cottonee are almost mandatory due to Houndour's weakness to Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave. The latter two options are especially great as they function as a check to Water-types, which also force out Houndour. Offensive Water-types enjoy Houndour's ability to completely break down opposing bulky Water- and Grass-types, opening the game up for themselves frequently. Similarly, Snivy makes a great partner due to deterring Sticky Web, checking Water-types, and forming a very deadly wallbreaking core. Snivy handles the Ground- and Water-types Houndour struggles with, while Houndour is able to check the Steel- and Grass-types which trouble Snivy. Additionally, Snivy's Glare can help Houndour against quicker teams by slowing them down. Slow pivots with U-turn, such as Mienfoo, or Volt Switch, such as Chinchou, help to switch away from the faster Pokemon that threaten Houndour out, giving Houndour opportunities to come back in safely to fire off its powerful attacks.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast hits hard and is Houndour's most powerful attack. Dark Pulse is good for cleaning up teams late-game and revenge killing neutral targets due to its accuracy. Pursuit allows Houndour to trap Abra, Gastly, and Pumpkaboo, which are irksome threats to many teams. Destiny Bond is an emergency button for when a sweeper gets out of hand. Destiny Bond is especially useful when Houndour is paired with another Dark-type, as it can often remove a shared counter. Snarl hits Gastly and Abra behind Substitute, making Houndour a more reliable check to them, although it isn't very powerful.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment makes Houndour able to check Choice Scarf Pawniard and Speed tie with Jolly Choice Scarf Mienfoo. The Speed investment coupled with a Choice Scarf turns Houndour into a great revenge killer, outspeeding most setup sweepers such as Scraggy at +1. Maximum Special Attack investment makes Houndour as powerful as possible, maximizing how effectively it can revenge kill Pokemon or sweep teams late-game. A Naive nature plus 36 Defense EVs allows Houndour to check Life Orb Pawniard while not weakening its Pursuit. The leftover EVs are invested into Special Defense, as their placement in Attack does not affect Pursuit's rolls, and it can help offset the Special Defense lost from a Naive nature. Flash Fire can be utilized to switch into Will-O-Wisp and Fire-types in general.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Houndour is a great revenge killer and is usually best used as such. Houndour should avoid switching into attacks, as it is woefully frail. However, it can clean late-game when opposing priority users are removed and teams are aptly weakened with well-placed Knock Offs and hazards. Due to Houndour's naturally high Special Attack and Speed with a Choice Scarf, it is still hard to switch into. Destiny Bond allows Houndour to remove a would-be check or stop a setup sweeper dead in its tracks, though it can be a little predictable.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard setters makes Choice Scarf Houndour especially hard to handle due to its high Speed and powerful STAB moves; with hazards on the field, even Pokemon that resist its attacks can only switch in once. Foongus, Cottonee, and Snubbull help maintain momentum, checking the threatening Fighting-types that easily switch into a Houndour Choice-locked into Dark Pulse. The former two also help handle the Water-types that switch into Fire Blast handily. Snivy is a more offensive Water-type counter that appreciates Houndour's ability to trap Gastly and Abra. The duo can wallbreak for one another as well due to sharing similar checks, making them a rather threatening pair. Staryu helps keep hazards off the field, allowing Houndour to check Pokemon throughout the match, while Houndour can trap spinblockers for Staryu. Dark-types as a whole, especially Vullaby, Pawniard, and Scraggy, appreciate Choice Scarf Houndour's ability to cripple checks with powerful STAB attacks or Destiny Bond, and they are good at using Knock Off on key bulky Pokemon such as Mienfoo. Slow pivots with access to Volt Switch, namely Chinchou, or U-turn, such as Mienfoo and the aforementioned Vullaby, are able to generally sponge attacks from Pokemon that Houndour lures in.</p>"

It also has good Attack and Special Attack base stats, which can make Elekid an strong offensive presence, with good STAB moves like Thunderbolt and Volt Switch and coverage options like Psychic, Cross Chop, and Fire Punch in its arsenal. Sadly, Elekid doesn't have much going for it defensively, which means it faces competition from similar Electric-type attackers Magnemite and Chinchou. As a frail attacker, Elekid's role is straightforward, but it relies on outspeeding and KOing its foes, which it sometimes struggles with due to its decent but not stellar attacking stats, especially when facing Ground-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A physical set can be used, but it's easier to wall, as some Ground-types like Mudbray can take its hits and KO it in response. Choice Scarf can be used as a niche set for outspeeding all opposing Choice Scarf Pokemon, mainly Doduo and Gastly, Vullaby after a Weak Armor boost, and Shell Smash users, thus providing a surprise factor; however, Elekid really misses the power from Life Orb as well as the ability to switch moves. Quick Attack is an option for revenge killing, but Elekid is fast enough to revenge kill by itself. Thunder Wave cripples opposing Pokemon, but Elekid hardly ever uses it, as it's already faster than most of its foes. Brick Break can be used over Cross Chop in the mixed set, as it has more accuracy, but it is noticeably weaker. Ice Punch and Icium Z can be used for the physical set, but aside from dispatching some Ground-types, it's often a waste of its item and a moveslot. Fire Punch can work over Psychic or Cross Chop as an alternative to beat Ferroseed faster, but Cross Chop already does enough against it. Substitute can be used to take advantage of a switch from the opponent to safely knock more Pokemon out, but due to Elekid's low bulk and the Life Orb recoil, it isn't worth it over another coverage move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chinchou</strong>: Chinchou walls Elekid completely and can switch into Electric-type moves thanks to Volt Absorb, but it should be wary of Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types like Drilbur and Mudbray are only 2HKOed and 3HKOed by Hidden Power Grass, respectively, and they KO Elekid in return. Hippopotas, though little more uncommon, is only sometimes 3HKOed and knocks Elekid out with Earthquake. Lastly, though it's very uncommon, Numel takes any of Elekid's attacks well and it can KO it. Diglett can sometimes handle Elekid, but it relies on a Speed tie. Trapinch reliably traps Elekid, as it can take its hits with ease.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Special Pokemon</strong>: Munchlax can deal with non-Cross Chop variants with ease due to its monstrous Special Defense. Spritzee also can take hits very well thanks to its good Special Defense.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority</strong>: Due to Elekid's low bulk, many priority attacks like Quick Attack from Doduo or Sucker Punch from Pawniard can leave it in range of a KO.</p>",

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch is Elekid's primary attack, which allows Elekid to act as a pivot and provides decent offensive potential because of Elekid's passable Special Attack stat. Thunderbolt is a more powerful STAB move that doesn't require Elekid to switch out and deals a lot of damage. Psychic is one of Elekid's main coverage moves, allowing it to hit most Fighting- and Poison-types Pokemon super effectively. Hidden Power Grass is used for hit the Ground-types and Chinchou, which can easily survive Elekid's other moves. Cross Chop is another option that Elekid can use to act as a mixed sweeper, hitting Munchlax and Steel-types like Ferroseed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>240 EVs in SpA are used to maximize Elekid's offensive capacity, and 236 EVs in Speed maximize its Speed. If Cross Chop is used, 12 EVs in Attack raise Elekid's Attack by one point. Vital Spirit benefits Elekid's Foongus matchup, blocking Spore. Life Orb boosts the power of Elekid's moves. 9 IVs in HP give Elekid 19 HP, which minimizes the recoil of Life Orb. A Timid nature is used to reach a 20 Speed, outspeeding every unboosted Pokemon and tying with Diglett, but a Hasty nature can be used if Elekid is running Cross Chop to avoid lowering its Attack stat.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set relies on not taking any hit, as Elekid's low bulk makes every attack dangerous, so Elekid shouldn't switch into an attacking foe. Due to its incredible Speed, Elekid can act as a revenge killer. To increase the efficacy of this set, Chinchou and Ground-types should be removed by Elekid's teammates. Chinchou, thanks to Volt Absorb, can switch into Elekid's STAB moves and recover part of its health, and many Ground-types can stomach Hidden Power Grass, as it has low power. Strong priority attackers should also be removed, as Elekid's low bulk leaves it susceptible to priority moves. Elekid should take advantage of predicted switches by using Volt Switch to gain momentum or by using Hidden Power Grass if you predict a Chinchou or Ground-type to switch in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Elekid appreciates the momentum given by slow pivoting, best provided by teammates such as Mienfoo, Vullaby, and, in some cases, Pancham and Alolan Meowth. Grass-types in general are good partners, as they can check Chinchou and the Ground-types that threaten Elekid. As such, Pokemon like Foongus and Snivy are recommended to use with it. Foongus can tank hits from many Ground-types and cripple them with Spore, and Snivy can act as a speed check with Glare, taking out every Ground-type foe with Leaf Storm. Entry hazards are important for Elekid, as it often forces switches, and the residual damage helps Elekid to knock out many Pokemon. For Stealth Rock support, Onix and Ferroseed are good choices, with the former acting as a utility lead and the latter beating some Ground-types and Shell Smash users such as Omanyte, Tirtouga, and Shellder. Dwebble and Omanyte provide Spikes support, and Mareanie can set Toxic Spikes, doing status damage to ease Elekid's job. Elekid needs Knock Off support in order to function, as many Ground-types can otherwise take Hidden Power Grass. Due to its shared checks, Pawniard is a good choice, as it can help wear down Ground- and Fighting-types. Z-Memento is useful when Elekid is weakened and it's still needed to take down some of the opponent's Pokemon. Diglett and Cottonee are the best options for this. The recoil of Life Orb can put Elekid in a bad situation sometimes, and if there are hazards set on its side of the field, Elekid is left at a disadvantage. Hazard removers like Staryu and Vullaby are useful, as they prevent Elekid from taking more residual damage. If more safety against Ground-types is needed, Slowpoke can take every hit from them thanks to its good defensive stats and Regenerator. As Chinchou and other Electric-types still hinder Elekid, trappers such as Diglett can trap them and knock them out with safety.</p>"

  "Magby": {
    "overview": "<p>Magby is a great offensive threat due to many good traits. Thanks to Magby's excellent Speed tier, it outspeeds threats such as Gastly and Doduo. Magby's great attacking stats let it hit most of the metagame hard. It also has a decent movepool, with priority in the form of Mach Punch, reliable STAB attacks such as Fire Punch, and Belly Drum to help it sweep. Thanks to Vital Spirit, it is immune to sleep-inducing moves such as Foongus's Spore. Unfortunately, Magby is super frail and weak to Stealth Rock, causing it to get worn down quickly. It also faces competition from several offensive Fire-types, such as Ponyta, Houndour, and Larvesta, and it also has trouble setting up due to its frailty.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flame Charge lets Magby outspeed all relevant Choice Scarf users after a boost, but this set doesn't hit very hard and gives up coverage. A mixed set with the moves Flare Blitz, Mach Punch, Thunder Punch, and Overheat is alright, but Cross Chop is usually preferred over Overheat. Overheat hits few Pokemon harder than Magby's other moves, with the only notable one being Hippopotas. An all-out special set can be used thanks to Magby's high Special Attack. The problem is that Magby has awful special coverage. Since Z-Crystals can't be removed by Knock Off, Z-Belly Drum sounds like an improvement over Berry Juice. Unfortunately the healing affect of Z-Belly Drum happens before the damage taken from Belly Drum, always leaving Magby heavily damaged after using it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Sturdy Users</strong>: Sturdy lets some Pokemon like Tirtouga and Onix take any hit, allowing them to get healed by Berry Juice and KO Magby.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Water-type Pokemon such as Corphish can tank Magby's Mach Punch and KO it with their STAB moves. Chinchou and Slowpoke can take hits from Magby pretty well; although, Chinchou fears Return, while Slowpoke fears Thunder Punch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Anything faster than Magby, such as Diglett, Choice Scarf Chinchou, and Abra can KO it unless they are weak to Mach Punch. Diglett is especially dangerous due to Arena Trap.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Belly Drum turns Magby into a deadly sweeper by maximizing its Attack stat. Fire Punch is a reliable STAB attack that does enough damage at +6 to justify not using Flare Blitz. Mach Punch hits Pokemon that Speed tie with or outspeed Magby, such as Elekid and Choice Scarf Pawniard. It also hits many other priority users first thanks to Magby's Speed; good examples of moves it outprioritizes include Pawniard's Sucker Punch and Doduo's Quick Attack. Return OHKOes Chinchou, Mareanie, and Ponyta at +6 and deals heavy damage to other Pokemon that resist Fire, such as Slowpoke. Thunder Punch hits other Water-types such as Slowpoke harder than Return but leaves Magby walled by Chinchou.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature and 252 Speed EVs let Magby reach 19 Speed, outspeeding threats such as Gastly and Snivy. 236 Attack EVs let Magby hit as hard as possible. 29 HP IVs make it to where Berry Juice will always activate after Magby uses Belly Drum. Berry Juice always heals Magby back to full HP whenever it uses Belly Drum. Vital Spirit prevents sleep, letting Magby switch into Foongus, since it's immune to Spore.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Never switch Magby in on attacks, as Magby will usually faint, or come close to fainting and use its Berry Juice early. It should be brought in through the use of a slow U-turn or Volt Switch against Pokemon that can't threaten it, such as Spritzee or Foongus. This gives Magby setup opportunities. It is best to wear down all Pokemon before setting up. Use Belly Drum when opposing Magby counters such as Chinchou or Onix are weakened or defeated, which will let Magby have an easier time sweeping.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Chinchou and Vullaby can bring Magby in with a slow Volt-Switch and U-turn, respectively. Stealth Rock is good for breaking Sturdy and Focus Sash. Notable Stealth Rock setters are Diglett, which traps Chinchou, and Ferroseed, which takes on Water-types. Other entry hazards are also a good idea; Ferroseed can set up Spikes, and Mareanie can set up Toxic Spikes. Pawniard and Alolan Grimer can Pursuit trap Ghost-types, which is useful for Mach Punch. A hazard remover such as Staryu is a must due to Stealth Rock chunking Magby's HP and Sticky Web rendering Magby almost useless. Sticky Web support lets Magby almost always outspeed grounded foes; an excellent choice is Surskit, which can reliably Sticky Web due to its high Speed. Knock Off support to remove Choice Scarf and Eviolite is also appreciated; Vullaby is a good choice, as it lures in Chinchou and removes its item, which is good for Thunder Punch Magby sets. Counters to bulky Water-types are also very important, such as Chinchou and Ferroseed. Diglett can trap Chinchou, Mareanie, and Alolan Grimer, which are big threats to Magby. Memento makes it much easier for Magby to set up; good users include Diglett, Alolan Grimer, and Cottonee, while Cottonee also has priority Memento due to Prankster.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is Magby's most powerful attack, hitting most Pokemon that don't resist it for good damage. Cross Chop hits Rock-types, such as Onix and Tirtouga, and Munchlax, which resists Fire because of Thick Fat. Mach Punch gives Magby priority and the ability to bypass Pawniard's Sucker Punch. Return hits Chinchou hard and provides decent neutral coverage. Thunder Punch hits other bulky Water-types, such as Mareanie and Slowpoke, and Archen harder.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature and 252 Speed EVs let Magby reach 19 Speed, outspeeding threats such as Vullaby and unboosted Scraggy. 236 Attack EVs let Magby hit as hard as possible when combined with a Life Orb. This lets Magby 2HKO Spritzee with Flare Blitz and Slowpoke with Thunder Punch, both after Stealth Rock damage. An HP IV of 0 reduces the damage Magby takes from Life Orb. Vital Spirit lets Magby safely switch into Foongus and other sleep-inducers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Magby will usually be spamming Flare Blitz, as it is by far Magby's most powerful attack. Be careful, though, as the recoil plus Life Orb damage wears Magby down very quickly. Don't switch Magby in on attacks, as it will usually take a large amount of damage. It should be brought in through the use of a slow U-turn or Volt Switch against Pokemon that can't do much to it, such as Spritzee. You should try to predict Magby's switch-ins and target them with super effective coverage moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Corphish, Carvanha, Shellder, and Nasty Plot Vullaby appreciate bulky Water-types and Munchlax being weakened. An entry hazard remover such as Staryu is a must due to Stealth Rock hindering Magby's longevity and Sticky Web making it difficult to outspeed the opponent's team. Sticky Web support lets Magby outspeed most of the opponent's team; Surskit can set up Sticky Web well due to its ability to outspeed most foes. Knock Off support to remove Choice Scarf and Eviolite is always a good idea, while status absorbers or clerics such as Spritzee is another good idea, as most forms of status greatly hinder Magby. Counters to bulky Water-type such as Chinchou and Ferroseed is much appreciated. Stealth Rock is good for breaking Sturdy and Focus Sash. Notable users are Diglett, which traps Chinchou, Alolan Grimer, and Mareanie; and Ferroseed, which takes on Water-types. Chinchou and Vullaby are useful for bringing Magby in with a slow Volt Switch and U-turn, respectively.</p>"

  "Larvitar": {
    "overview": "<p>Larvitar has a great offensive STAB combination that hits almost the entire tier for neutral damage, as well as access to a great setup option in Dragon Dance, which allows it to pose a threat as a decent late-game sweeper. Larvitar's Guts ability further bolsters its offensive presence and allows it to absorb status fairly well and set up without worrying about burns. In addition to its unresisted STAB attacks, Larvitar also has access to powerful coverage options like Superpower and Crunch to hit specific targets harder. However, despite its typing's excellent offensive STAB coverage, it also leaves Larvitar 4x weak to the tier's common Grass- and Water-type attacks and weak to the ever so prevalent Fighting-types. Larvitar is also quite slow before a boost and very frail, meaning that it will struggle to take a hit before setting up, and even after a boost, Larvitar's low Speed and weaknesses to common priority attacks like Aqua Jet and Vacuum Wave leave it easily revenge killed. Furthermore, Larvitar is still quite slow and weak after a boost, meaning that it will be easily revenge killed by most moderately bulky foes. Lastly, Larvitar faces competition from a similar sweeper in Tyrunt, which has a better typing and ability for setting up and a higher Attack stat, and from Shell Smash users like Shellder and Tirtouga.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Crunch is an option to hit Pumpkaboo-XL and Slowpoke for sufficient damage, but it has limited use otherwise and leaves Larvitar walled by Ferroseed. Facade is a decently powerful attack once Guts is activated, though it is reliant on Larvitar getting inflicted with status and is almost always less valuable coverage than Superpower. A Choice Scarf set is an option but is usually done better by Cranidos, as Larvitar is rather weak unless Guts has been activated. Rock Polish is an option for outpacing every Choice Scarf user in the metagame after a boost. However, Larvitar will lack power unless inflicted with status and will be quite frail if holding a Flame Orb. Larvitar can make use of its access to Stealth Rock with a utility based set, but it is outclassed by Onix in this role. Poison Jab is an option for hitting Fairy-types. However, Spritzee and Snubbull are capable of tanking a boosted Poison Jab more often than not, while Cottonee can lock Larvitar into Dragon Dance with priority Encore. Lastly, Pursuit can be used to help Larvitar function as a revenge killer and trapper, though its Pursuit will severely lack in power and more often than not take up coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Staryu, Slowpoke, and Shellder are all capable of taking any of Larvitar's attacks and OHKOing it with super effective STAB attacks in return. Corphish, Tirtouga, and Kabuto in particular can revenge kill Larvitar with priority Aqua Jet without taking any damage.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-type Pokemon like Pumpkaboo-XL and Snivy are quite troublesome due to also being able to OHKO Larvitar with super effective STAB attacks after tanking a hit. Cottonee is particularly troublesome, as it can come in on Larvitar as it uses Dragon Dance and lock it into the move with Encore.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types such as Mudbray and Hippopotas are capable of taking any of Larvitar's boosted attacks, KOing it with STAB attacks, and recovering off any damage taken in the process with either Rest or Slack Off.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types like Mienfoo, Scraggy, and Pancham are all capable of switching in on Rock Slide, tanking any of Larvitar's other attacks, and KOing with their super effective STAB attacks. Timburr and Croagunk in particular can use their access to Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, respectively, to revenge kill a weakened Larvitar without taking any damage.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Spritzee and Snubbull are both bulky enough to tank even boosted hits from Larvitar and threaten it with powerful STAB attacks or super effective coverage in return. Cottonee is particularly troublesome, as its Grass-typing allows it to tank a hit and OHKO Larvitar with super effective STAB attacks, as well as lock it into Dragon Dance with Prankster Encore.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Even at +1, Larvitar is outsped and easily revenge killed by common Choice Scarf users like Magnemite, Pawniard, and Chinchou due to its frailty.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance boosts Larvitar's Attack and Speed stats by one stage and enables its sweep. Earthquake is Larvitar's most powerful Ground-type STAB attack and hits anything that doesn't resist it for sufficient damage after a Dragon Dance boost. Rock Slide is a powerful secondary STAB option that offers excellent coverage alongside Earthquake and has a decent chance to flinch Larvitar's foes. Stone Edge, however, can be used over Rock Slide for more power, hitting defensive threats such as Spritzee and Slowpoke for 2HKOs after two Attack boosts. This is, however, at the cost of accuracy. Superpower rounds off Larvitar’s excellent coverage, allowing it to hit the likes of Ferroseed and Munchlax for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Attack allows Larvitar to hit as hard as possible, while maximum investment in Speed with a Jolly nature allows Larvitar to outpace the entire unboosted metagame after one Dragon Dance boost. The remaining EVs are put into Defense and Special Defense to provide Larvitar with a bit more staying power alongside Eviolite. Flame Orb is an option over Eviolite, allowing Larvitar to receive an Attack boost from Guts, though the boost in defenses is usually more useful for ensuring a chance to set up. Guts is the preferred ability, as it allows Larvitar to reliably absorb otherwise threatening status conditions in poison and burn and use them to gain a 1.5x boost in Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Larvitar is best used as a late-game sweeper once its checks and counters have been removed. It can, however, be put to use early-game to punch some holes in the opponent's team for another teammate to sweep late-game. It is best that bulky Water-types like Slowpoke and Staryu and Grass-types such as Foongus and Cottonee are removed before Larvitar attempts to sweep, as they will usually be able to take a hit and OHKO Larvitar with super effective STAB attacks. Fighting-types like Mienfoo and Timburr are also important to remove from play before Larvitar tries sweeping for similar reasons. Larvitar often struggles to find setup opportunities and should thus capitalize on switches it forces to use Dragon Dance. As such, reliable setup targets include Larvesta, defensive Ponyta, and Alolan Grimer. Finally, Larvitar's general frailty means that it often won't be able to switch into attacks very reliably, meaning it is best brought out via pivot support from Pokemon like Magnemite and Vullaby or after a teammate has fainted.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon capable of dealing with Water-types, such as Snivy, Elekid, and Chinchou, make good partners, as they allow Larvitar to more reliably sweep late-game. Grass-type checks, such as Rufflet, Vullaby, and Ponyta, are also generally good partners due to them being able to deal with Grass-types that would otherwise impede Larvitar's sweep. Abra, Snubbull, and Spritzee are also good partners, as they are all examples of Pokemon capable of checking the Fighting-types that Larvitar hates dealing with. Knock Off support from Pokemon like Kabuto, Pawniard, and Mienfoo is useful for removing Eviolites from bulkier foes and making it easier for Larvitar to sweep. Memento support from the likes of Cottonee and Alolan Grimer is useful for giving Larvitar a setup opportunity and, if Larvitar is holding a Flame Orb, more or less mandatory due to its poor bulk. Slow pivot support from the likes of Mienfoo, Vullaby, and Magnemite is also helpful to Larvitar, as it prevents Larvitar from taking too much damage before setting up by granting it free switches. Lastly, entry hazard support from Pokemon like Ferroseed and Onix is useful for allowing Larvitar to break past foes with the Sturdy ability, like Magnemite and Dwebble, as well as breaking past foes like Berry Juice Snivy more easily.</p>"

  "Treecko": {
    "overview": "<p>Treecko has a unique niche on offensive teams thanks to its Unburden ability. This allows Treecko to set up Swords Dance, usually take a hit, and consume Berry Juice afterward, thus doubling its Speed and becoming a threatening late-game sweeper. Alongside Treecko's fantastic ability and access to Swords Dance are plenty of useful coverage options, including Acrobatics, Drain Punch, and Rock Slide. Unfortunately, Treecko is extremely frail with a poor defensive typing and is thus vulnerable to super effective attacks, powerful offensive Pokemon, and strong priority. Treecko is also extremely weak before a Swords Dance boost, meaning that it is quite reliant on the move to do any notable damage. It can still struggle to break past some bulky threats after a boost, such as Spritzee, Vullaby, Mareanie, and Foongus, as it isn't extremely powerful even after using Swords Dance. Unburden can also be a rather situational ability in that it only activates once, meaning that upon setting up, Treecko will put itself in an all-or-nothing situation. Treecko also suffers from a slight case of four-moveslot syndrome, as its choice of coverage will either prevent it from hurting Fire- and Poison-types if it uses Acrobatics or from hurting Grass- and Fighting-types if it uses Rock Slide. Lastly, the strenuous team support Treecko requires to sweep can cause the teams built around it to be matchup reliant.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Endure is an option for surviving extremely powerful hits and triggering Unburden. However, Treecko will lose valuable coverage in running the move and as a result will require even more support, so this isn't a preferable option. Substitute is another option for being able to set up more reliably, though this isn't preferred for reasons similar to Endure. Seed Bomb may seem like a better option than Bullet Seed at first, but is actually weaker unless Bullet Seed only hits twice, due to LC's rather odd damage roll mechanics. A special attacking set is an option, as Treecko's Special Attack stat is higher than its Attack. However, Treecko's lack of boosting moves and general lack of good coverage prevents such a set from being at all effective. Treecko can forego its defensive investment and use a Focus Sash to trigger Unburden, though this is even more situational than using Berry Juice, as Treecko will be extremely vulnerable to priority and require entry hazard removal from a teammate. Treecko will also be unable to set up against passive Pokemon, as it won't be whittled down to Focus Sash against most. Lastly, Iron Tail can be used to hit Spritzee and Snubbull super effectively, but it otherwise only provides rather redundant coverage alongside Bullet Seed and Drain Punch.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ponyta</strong>: Ponyta's bulk allows it to survive a boosted Rock Slide from Treecko and in return KO it with super effective STAB attacks. Unless their offenses have been lowered by Memento, other Fire-types such as Larvesta can also be quite threatening to Treecko before Unburden has been activated.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types resist Treecko's STAB attacks and Drain Punch, and most can also take a boosted Acrobatics as well. Examples include Alolan Grimer, Mareanie, Foongus, and Croagunk, though the latter two must be wary of Acrobatics.</p> <p><strong>Spritzee and Snubbull</strong>: Spritzee's good bulk allows it to avoid the 2HKO from Treecko's boosted Bullet Seed, while in return it can use Wish to stall out Treecko and use STAB Moonblast to dent it. Snubbull can lower Treecko's Attack with Intimidate and proceed to threaten it with either Play Rough or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Unless Treecko is using Rock Slide, it has no way of hitting Vullaby super effectively, while Vullaby can threaten to OHKO it with super effective STAB attacks. It can also come in on Bullet Seed if it has Weak Armor and proceed to revenge kill Treecko. Rufflet and Doduo are also quite troublesome, though they must be wary of Treecko's boosted Acrobatics if Unburden has activated.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status is quite troubling to Treecko, as burns from the likes of Pumpkaboo-XL and Larvesta will halve its Attack, while its Speed will be quite mediocre if it is hit by paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority</strong>: Treecko's extreme frailty leaves it with a vulnerability to most forms of priority. Snover's Ice Shard is particularly troublesome, as Treecko will take super effective damage from it, though Zigzagoon's Extreme Speed, Timburr's Mach Punch, and Pawniard's Sucker Punch are all also quite threatening.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance is mandatory, as it boosts Treecko's otherwise mediocre Attack stat to threatening levels and allows it to break past most of the metagame with its attacks. Bullet Seed is Treecko's STAB move of choice, as LC's damage roll mechanics make it the most powerful option as long as it hits at least three times. It also has use in that it can break past Sturdy, Focus Sash, and Substitute as well as defeat various Pokemon with the Weak Armor ability, such as Onix and Dwebble, though Treecko should be wary of hitting Vullaby with the move. Drain Punch gives Treecko a reliable way to break past the Steel-types that would otherwise wall it, 2HKOing Ferroseed and OHKOing Magnemite and Pawniard after a boost. Acrobatics becomes quite powerful once Treecko has boosted its Attack and consumed its Berry Juice and is useful for KOing Fighting-types such as Timburr, Croagunk, and Mienfoo. It also hits Bug-types such as Larvesta and Surskit and opposing Grass-types like Snivy and Pumpkaboo super effectively. Rock Slide is an option over Acrobatics, as it allows Treecko to OHKO Ponyta and Vullaby, which otherwise wall it, after a boost and Stealth Rock damage. It also hits Bug- and other Flying-types super effectively, though it does leave Treecko quite vulnerable to Croagunk and other Fighting-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Berry Juice alongside Unburden secures Treecko's niche, as upon restoring its health with Berry Juice, Unburden will double Treecko's Speed and turn it into a threatening late-game sweeper. 116 EVs invested in HP alongside 156 Defense EVs allow Treecko to avoid OHKOs from some foes' super effective coverage attacks, such as Timburr's Ice Punch and Chinchou's Ice Beam, and trigger the consumption of Berry Juice. It can also help Treecko take some priority attacks after having set up. 36 EVs are invested in Speed to allow Treecko to hit 14 Speed. This allows it to outpace the entire unboosted metagame after Unburden activates, as well as some of the tier's fastest Choice Scarf users, such as Gastly and Doduo. 156 of the remaining EVs are invested in Attack with an Adamant nature to give Treecko as much of an offensive presence as possible and to allow it to break through the majority of the metagame after a Swords Dance boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Treecko functions best as a late-game cleaner after its checks, like Ponyta, Vullaby, and Alolan Grimer, have been either removed or weakened. Before said checks are taken care of, it is important that Treecko doesn't take any chip damage so as not to activate Unburden too early. It should also refrain from getting hit with Knock Off in order to prevent the early activation of Unburden. Setting up is a rather tricky task for Treecko, as it should often try doing so against a foe whose coverage can whittle it into range of Berry Juice consumption but won't OHKO it. Chinchou, Drilbur, and Surskit all carry super effective coverage that won't flat-out OHKO Treecko, which makes these threats decent setup targets. U-turn users like Mienfoo and Vullaby can also bring Treecko into range of Berry Juice consumption, though some, such as Larvesta and Rufflet, can OHKO it with the move. Another setup strategy that is much less risky is using Swords Dance against foes with generally weak attacks, like Spritzee and Onix. Treecko will often be relying on Memento support, meaning that some Pokemon that carry super effective STAB attacks can also make decent setup targets with lowered offenses. Examples include Foongus, Croagunk, and Larvesta.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Although it is indeed threatening once boosted, Treecko does require a lot of support to successfully sweep. Diglett is easily Treecko's best possible partner, as it is capable of supporting it in many different ways. It removes both Poison-types and Ponyta and most importantly can support Treecko with Memento, thus giving it a reliable setup opportunity. If Diglett isn't wanted or needed, Memento support is still highly recommended for Treecko, as it gives it setup opportunities against the likes of Foongus and Croagunk. Alolan Grimer and Cottonee can also provide Treecko with Memento support, while Pancham can also work as a Parting Shot pivot. Fire-type checks are highly recommended as teammates, as they can easily take care of Ponyta to give Treecko an easier time sweeping. Staryu, Mudbray, and Chinchou all work as reliable Pokemon for this role. Poison-type checks are also a necessity, as Treecko is unable to dent most Poison-types. Drilbur, Mudbray, and Abra can all function here. Answers to Flying-types, such as Onix, Elekid, and Magnemite, all make useful partners, as they can dispose of the likes of Archen and Doduo to help Treecko set up without fear of switch-ins to the aforementioned threats. Knock Off support is quite helpful as well, as the removal of bulkier foes' Eviolites gives Treecko an easier time cleaning up late-game. Alolan Grimer is a particularly good user of Knock Off in terms of supporting Treecko, as it can also dent one of Treecko's biggest annoyances in Spritzee with Poison Jab. Other examples of Pokemon capable of providing Knock Off support include Mienfoo, Vullaby, and Croagunk. Entry hazard support from the likes of Onix, Dwebble, and Omanyte allows Treecko to OHKO Ponyta with a boosted Rock Slide, as well as have an easier time cleaning up.</p>"

  "Torchic": {
    "overview": "<p>Torchic's niche is in its ability Speed Boost, which allows it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame after a free turn. Coupled with access to powerful Fire-type STAB moves and its good Special Attack stat, Torchic can serve as formidable cleaner with the right team support. However, Torchic has very little in the way of coverage moves, which means that it must rely on Hidden Power to hit Pokemon that resist Fire-type attacks. Additionally, it is quite frail and is weak to Stealth Rock, leaving it very susceptible to common priority attacks. Because these weaknesses leave it unable to sweep past certain defensive Pokemon and priority users, Torchic's usefulness tends to be highly dependent on its team matchup.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Torchic can run Will-O-Wisp to cripple physical attackers on the switch, but it will generally still take a substantial amount of damage from physical attacks due to its poor defensive stats. Rock Slide is an option to surprise Fire-types but is much less generally useful than Torchic's other moves. Flamethrower can be used to avoid Fire Blast's chance of missing, but the loss of power is extremely notable. Finally, Torchic can run a physical set using its decent Attack stat and Swords Dance, but its lack of powerful physical STAB moves and poor physical coverage options hold this set back from being effective.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Unless it runs Rock Slide, Torchic struggles to break past Fire-types. Ponyta is the most notable example, as it can easily take any of Torchic's attacks, heal itself with Morning Sun, and KO back with High Horsepower.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types can prevent Torchic from sweeping in two ways. Aqua Jet users, such as Corphish and Tirtouga, can easily revenge kill Torchic unless it is behind a Substitute. Alternatively, very bulky Water-types, such as Mareanie and Frillish, are not 2HKOed by Hidden Power Grass and can KO Torchic in return.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Due to Torchic's frailty, strong priority users such as Timburr, Corphish, and Pawniard can revenge kill it with little difficulty, especially after Stealth Rock and Life Orb chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Especially bulky Pokemon, such as Spritzee and Munchlax, can take Torchic's attacks and wear it down while healing themselves. However, these Pokemon must be wary of being surprised by a Z-Move or being hit by Knock Off during the match.</p>",

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Protect guarantees Torchic at least one free turn of Speed Boost, after which it will be able to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. Fire Blast is a powerful attack that provides more consistent damage output than Torchic's other STAB attacks. Hidden Power Grass is Torchic's most useful coverage move, heavily damaging many common Pokemon resistant to Fire Blast such as Onix and Staryu. Substitute can be run in the last moveslot to allow Torchic to capitalize on the switches it forces and avoid getting revenge killed by Sucker Punch users. Alternatively, Torchic can run both Overheat and Fire Blast, using Overheat to break past bulky Pokemon such as Vullaby and Fire Blast to clean late-game. This is usually suboptimal when Firium Z is run, however, as Inferno Overdrive can instead be used to break past bulky Pokemon. Defog is also an option in the final moveslot, though Torchic's Stealth Rock weakness and frailty make it an inconsistent user of the move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Torchic's offensive presence and allows it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame after one turn of Speed Boost, making it very difficult to revenge kill without priority users. Life Orb consistently boosts Torchic's damage output, allowing Fire Blast to at least 2HKO most of what it hits neutrally. Alternatively, Firium Z gives Torchic the ability to break past one especially bulky Pokemon and avoid the chip damage incurred by Life Orb, but it noticeably lowers Torchic's overall damage output. 0 HP IVs keep Torchic's HP at 19, ensuring that Life Orb only deals 1 HP of recoil each turn. If Firium Z is run, there is no need to lower Torchic's IVs.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ideally, Torchic should be brought into the game after its defensive checks, such as Ponyta and Mareanie, and strong priority users have been eliminated. Torchic can also come in earlier in the match to wear down its checks but must be wary of taking residual damage from Stealth Rock and Life Orb due to its susceptibility to priority attacks. Protect should usually be used on the first turn out against a faster foe to take advantage of Speed Boost. However, bear in mind that this is predictable and foes can take advantage of this free turn by using Substitute or switching to a check. If possible, Torchic should use Substitute against a Pokemon that it forces out, such as Foongus, to make it difficult to revenge kill using priority moves. Either Inferno Overdrive or a Life Orb-boosted Overheat should be preserved until necessary to break past especially bulky foes, such as bulky Vullaby and Timburr. Torchic should not be switched directly into attacks due to its frailty but should instead be brought in after an ally has fainted or through use of a slow pivot.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock users are incredibly valuable partners for Torchic for the chip damage on Pokemon that Torchic struggles to break past otherwise, especially Ponyta. Ferroseed is one such user with especially good type synergy, but Onix and Pawniard also fill this role well. Knock Off users, such as Mienfoo and Vullaby, can remove Eviolite from bulky foes, greatly aiding Torchic's sweep. Pokemon that can handle opposing Fire-types are a necessity, since Torchic struggles to break past these foes. Diglett is notable due to its ability to trap and remove Pokemon such as Ponyta and Mareanie, though its lack of defensive utility can make it difficult to fit onto the same team as Torchic. Onix and Staryu can also fairly reliably check Fire-types. Similarly, Pokemon that can check Water-types, such as Snivy and the aforementioned Ferroseed, are important partners for Torchic. Entry hazard removal is critical when using Torchic due to its Stealth Rock weakness. Rapid Spin users such as Staryu are best in this role because they don't clear Stealth Rock from the opponent's side, though Defog users such as Vullaby can fit some teams better. Bulky pivots, such as Mienfoo and Vullaby, can help bring Torchic into the match with minimal damage. Finally, it is worth noting that due to Torchic's lack of defensive presence, its use often will require teammates that can check a variety of offensive Pokemon in one team slot.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>In Little Cup, Zigzagoon can act as an effective physical sweeper thanks to its access to the amazing combination of Belly Drum to maximize its Attack in an instant and Extreme Speed to outprioritize its foes and KO them. Unfortunately, it is hindered by its numerous flaws such as its poor bulk, which makes it struggle to set up Belly Drum reliably. Zigzagoon also requires excessive team support to perform its role with success, and without this, many Pokemon are able to get in the way of its sweep. In most games, Zigzagoon tends to either win the battle for its team with a successful sweep or fail to contribute anything at all.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Iron Tail can be used to grant Zigzagoon the ability to OHKO Spritzee, defensive Archen, and Lileep, while Rock Smash similarly is an option to OHKO Aron and Shieldon once Sturdy has been broken. These are not great choices, however, as these Pokemon are not very common and can be weakened beforehand. Normalium Z can be used instead of Berry Juice to allow Zigzagoon to use Z-Belly Drum, which restores its HP fully just before Belly Drum is used. This means that Zigzagoon can set up on Knock Off users; however, most Knock Off users threaten Zigzagoon anyway with their offensive power or typing. Normalium Z is also flawed because it guarantees that Zigzagoon will only have 50% or less of its HP remaining after Belly Drum, unlike when using Berry Juice. Return can also be utilized to OHKO bulky Pokemon such as Mareanie and Spritzee, but this means Zigzagoon will be missing out on important coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Ghost-type Pokemon</strong>: Ghost-types that outspeed Zigzagoon like Gastly are significant threats because of their immunity to Extreme Speed. They can attack or burn Zigzagoon before it gets the opportunity to use Thief.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon</strong>: Steel-type Pokemon resist Extreme Speed, so they are sometimes able to survive an Extreme Speed and stop Zigzagoon's sweep. Pawniard is especially notable because it is able to Knock Off Zigzagoon's Berry Juice to prevent it from using Belly Drum, while it can also discourage Zigzagoon's teammates from using Memento, as it could switch in and gain an Attack boost from Defiant. Ferroseed is also a great threat, since Zigzagoon has no way to deal any considerable damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon</strong>: Rock-types such as Onix also resist Extreme Speed, so they can often take a hit and KO Zigzagoon. However, Rock-types that are slower than Zigzagoon can be hit by a super effective Seed Bomb before they are able to attack. Tirtouga is notable despite its 4x weakness to Seed Bomb because of its access to Sturdy along with a STAB priority attack.</p> <p><strong>Very Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Very bulky Pokemon can survive an attack from Zigzagoon and then attack back. Bulky Fighting-types like Timburr are a particular threat because they can OHKO Zigzagoon with a super effective STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Burns</strong>: Pokemon that can burn Zigzagoon like Ponyta can cripple its Attack stat and therefore prevent it from sweeping successfully.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Pokemon that have Taunt like Cottonee can prevent Zigzagoon from using Belly Drum, making it temporarily unable to sweep.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Belly Drum Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Belly Drum turns Zigzagoon into a powerful sweeper, maximizing its Attack. Extreme Speed is the STAB move that Zigzagoon will be using the majority of the time in order to KO its foes. Its incredibly useful +2 priority compensates for Zigzagoon's low Speed stat, allowing it to sweep. Thief enables Zigzagoon to hit Ghost-types such as Gastly and Pumpkaboo-XL super effectively and can steal items once Berry Juice has been consumed. Seed Bomb provides coverage for Mudbray along with Rock-types like Onix and Tirtouga, though Protect is an alternative option that prevents Zigzagoon from being KOed by Fake Out users.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Berry Juice restores Zigzagoon's HP to ensure it can use Belly Drum without it failing, or in some cases it can restore Zigzagoon's HP after Belly Drum to prepare itself for taking a hit. An Adamant nature is utilized in conjunction with 196 Attack EVs so as to maximize Zigzagoon's Attack stat in order to KO as many Pokemon as possible. EVs are invested into bulk so that Zigzagoon can set up more reliably, and the remaining EVs are dumped into Speed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Zigzagoon is best used towards the end of the battle once its checks and counters have been removed so that it can sweep without trouble. Zigzagoon should refrain from switching in on attacks because it has very low defensive stats and it can be difficult to set up once Berry Juice has been consumed. This means Zigzagoon should be brought in to battle via a free switch from the likes of a slow VoltTurn user or immediately after a teammate has fainted. Additionally, Zigzagoon should wait for an opportune time to set up. This is usually when the foe cannot stop Zigzagoon from using Belly Drum, KO Zigzagoon, or burn Zigzagoon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Being frail, Zigzagoon appreciates Memento support from Pokemon like Diglett and Cottonee, as they can lower a foe's offensive stats and then give Zigzagoon a free switch, allowing it to set up safely. Diglett is arguably Zigzagoon's best teammate option, as not only can it provide Memento support, but it can also trap and KO Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon that resist Extreme Speed. It additionally has access to Stealth Rock. Entry hazard support like Stealth Rock is great because it can break Sturdy and Focus Sashes while also providing chip damage to make opposing Pokemon easier to KO for Zigzagoon. Other Pokemon that provide entry hazards include Dwebble and Onix. Pursuit users are also great partners because they can trap and remove Ghost-types and break Abra's Focus Sash, both of which otherwise cause trouble for Zigzagoon. Alolan Grimer and Stunky are especially good options, as they also provide Memento support. Knock Off users such as Pawniard and Mienfoo also help Zigzagoon sweep by removing bulky Pokemon's Eviolites so that Zigzagoon can KO them later. Furthermore, Pokemon that lure in Gastly, Zigzagoon's main Ghost-type threat, support Zigzagoon because it can then be Pursuit trapped. Likewise, Pokemon that lure in and weaken Steel-types are helpful for Zigzagoon. Snivy and the aforementioned Cottonee are great examples of these, luring in both Gastly and Steel-types.</p>"

It also has extremely powerful STAB attacks in Brave Bird, Facade, and Boomburst. U-turn allows it to play around its checks and whittle them down so it or a teammate can pick them off. However, Taillow is extremely frail and cannot switch into any attack and will faint to most forms of priority. A weakness to Stealth Rock limits the number of times it can switch in. Taillow also does not have many coverage moves, and the ones it does have are not the best. It is heavily outclassed by other birds such as Vullaby and Doduo, which are bulkier or stronger than Taillow is. It has a mediocre Attack stat and a horrible Special Attack stat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taillow has a very small movepool, so there are not too many viable options outside of the already mentioned ones. Steel Wing can be utilized to hit Archen, but Taillow then loses out on its other moves that tend to be more useful. The mixed Life Orb set can attempt to utilize a Choice Specs; however, Choice Specs does not secure any important KOs that Life Orb misses out on. A physical Choice Scarf set could use U-turn / Brave Bird / Return / Pursuit to outspeed nearly the entire metagame, but its damage output is very underwhelming. A Choice Band set can be used in order to not take as much recoil as the Guts set does, but the inability to switch moves can be taken advantage of. One can attempt to use Roost to extend Taillow's lifespan, but it typically does not have the bulk to utilize the move. On the mixed set, Hidden Power Grass may be used to hit Omanyte, Tirtouga, and Chinchou. However, Hidden Power Fighting tends to be more useful and relevant. Z-Mirror Move can be used to copy the Z-move equivalent of one of the opposing Pokemon's moves and to gain +2 Attack. This can then be used to sweep the opposing team. Unfortunately, this set is hard to pull off and is generally inferior to the ones listed above.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Defensive Rock- and Steel-types</strong>: Defensive Rock- and Steel-types are able to counter most versions of physical Taillow, as well as special Taillow sets that do not carry Heat Wave or Hidden Power Fighting or Grass. Due to Taillow's frailty, many Rock- and Steel-types can KO it easily. Tirtouga, Pawniard, and Archen are all examples of Pokemon that counter Taillow.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to Taillow's low bulk, common Choice Scarf users such as Mienfoo, Magnemite, and Chinchou can outspeed and KO it. Taillow's frailty also leaves it incredibly vulnerable to priority attacks such as Sucker Punch and Mach Punch. These attacks threaten the special set the most because it does not carry its own form of priority. Since revenge killers also force Taillow out, it will keep taking damage from its items and from Stealth Rock which means it quickly gets whittled down to low health.</p>",

      "Mixed Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Boomburst is an incredibly powerful STAB attack, and thanks to Scrappy and Life Orb, it hits extremely hard, making it incredibly difficult to switch into, even for Pokemon that resist it. Boomburst can also hit behind Substitutes, which makes it useful for dealing with Pokemon such as Snivy and Gastly. Heat Wave allows you to hit Steel-types such as Ferroseed and Magnemite that resist Boomburst. Hidden Power Grass hits the Rock-types that would otherwise check Taillow such as Onix, Kabuto, and Tirtouga very hard. U-turn can be utilized to wear down Taillow's checks and counters while also retaining momentum. Brave Bird is used to KO Fighting- and Grass-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Reducing HP IVs to 19 gives Taillow 19 HP so that it will only take 1 damage from Life Orb recoil. Guts is useful for when Taillow gets statused because it makes Brave Bird hit harder, while Scrappy allows its Normal-type attacks to hit Ghost-types, which means you can spam Boomburst without issue. The EV spread maximizes its Speed and Special Attack, which allows it to hit incredibly hard and fast. The remaining EVs are put into Defense to allow it to take priority attacks slightly better. Life Orb is used to make sure that Taillow can hit incredibly hard but can still switch between moves. If Taillow is running Hidden Power Fighting, it should instead run 36 Def / 200 SpA / 240 Spe due to the lowered IVs it forces.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to avoid switching Taillow into any attacks, as it is quite frail and will usually not survive. Scout for Choice Scarf users such as Pawniard, Chinchou, and Magnemite that can threaten Taillow. Remove opposing Rock- and Steel-types first to allow Taillow to fire off Boombursts without anything resisting them. Use Boomburst as much as possible, since it is Taillow's strongest move and takes a large chunk out of the majority of the metagame. U-turn out of Taillow's checks and counters to wear them down so they can be picked off by Boomburst later.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Knock Off support is very helpful, as it can get rid of opposing Eviolites, which softens up enemy Pokemon for Taillow to KO. Entry hazards help a lot, whittling down opposing Pokemon so they can be OHKOed or 2HKOed by Boomburst. Pawniard is an example of a Pokemon that can beat the Rock-types that Taillow has a problem with and also is able to set up Stealth Rock. Diglett can also set up Stealth Rock and trap Rock- and Steel-types that Taillow has trouble with. Diglett also appreciates the U-turn support from Taillow, as it can bring Diglett in on Rock- and Steel-types to trap them. Having a spinner or a Defogger such as Staryu or Vullaby is very useful, as Taillow does not appreciate taking damage from Stealth Rock. Staryu can also beat Rock- and Ground-types that threaten Taillow. Taillow can also be part of a type stacking core with other Flying-types such as Vullaby and Doduo. One bird can weaken the opponent's checks and counters to Flying-types, and the other one will be able to sweep. Lures for Rock-types could be helpful, such as Jump Kick Doduo. Slow pivots such as Mienfoo and Chinchou can be used to get Taillow in safely, as it does not appreciate taking any damage.</p>"

Quick Attack can be used to pick off frail Pokemon, such as Carvanha, and can also pick off weakened Pokemon. U-turn can whittle down Taillow's checks while maintaining momentum. Protect allows you to activate Flame Orb reliably as well as allowing you to scout for moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread maximizes Taillow's Speed and Attack, which allows it to hit incredibly hard and fast.

There are also several other Normal-types that are simply far better offensively, like Bunnelby and, on Trick Room, even Munchlax.

It also has great bulk, and its Flying resistance lets it check the metagame's very threatening Flying-types such as Vullaby and Doduo. Furthermore, its access to Volt Switch is especially useful because it allows Nosepass to pivot out of the two most common hazard removers, Staryu and Kabuto, and access to Thunder Wave differentiates it from other Stealth Rock setters. However, its bad Attack and Speed massively limit its offensive presence, making it passive and somewhat vulnerable to being set up on. It is also outclassed by Onix, which is faster and has a greater Defense stat. Its bad defensive typing gives it weaknesses to common threats like Staryu, Mienfoo, and Pawniard. Overall, Nosepass is generally not worth using.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Magnet Pull set can be used to trap and remove Steel-types like Choice Scarf Magnemite with Earthquake and Ferroseed with Hidden Power Fire, but Nosepass's weakness to Steel can be troublesome. An Eviolite set with Pain Split can be used somewhat effectively because of Nosepass's low HP stat, but it's not a reliable source of recovery. Instead of Thunder Wave, Magic Coat can be used to bounce back Taunt and Stealth Rock against Pokemon like Onix; Endure can be used to take a hit, consume Berry Juice, and then reactivate Sturdy; Earthquake can be used to hit Steel-types super effectively; and Fire Punch can do the same with less power while hitting Ferroseed harder. However, Thunder Wave tends to be more useful than these moves because without it, Nosepass is setup bait.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-type Pokemon can hit Nosepass super effectively with their powerful STAB moves, resist Rock Blast, and are immune to Thunder Wave and Volt Switch. Examples include Mudbray, which receives multiple Defense boosts from Rock Blast via Stamina; Drilbur, which can bypass Sturdy using Mold Breaker; Onix, whose access to Taunt enables it to stop Nosepass from setting up Stealth Rock; and Diglett, which is arguably the most threatening because it can easily trap Nosepass.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Pokemon like Timburr and Mienfoo are very common, resist Rock Blast, can use Knock Off to remove Nosepass's Berry Juice, and hit Nosepass hard with their super effective STAB moves. Mienfoo can also use Taunt to prevent Nosepass from using Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave, and Scraggy can set up with Dragon Dance because it can heal paralysis from Thunder Wave using Shed Skin. Timburr can benefit from Thunder Wave via Guts.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong> Water-types like Staryu, which can also remove Stealth Rock, and Chinchou, which is also immune to Volt Switch and Thunder Wave, can hit Nosepass super effectively with their powerful Water-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types:</strong> Grass-types like Foongus and Pumpkaboo-XL resist Volt Switch and can hit Nosepass super effectively. Snivy can become a large threat to Nosepass's team because it gets an opportunity to set up with Leaf Storm when it switches in on Nosepass; however, without Substitute, it fears Thunder Wave.</p>",

      "SturdyJuice Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock wears down the opposing team, punishes the opponent for switching, and breaks opposing Pokemon's Sturdy. Rock Blast is Nosepass's preferred STAB attack, being especially useful for damaging Weak Armor Pokemon such as Vullaby and Dwebble and for breaking through Dwebble's Sturdy and Abra's Focus Sash. Thunder Wave cripples the foe's Speed, allowing Nosepass's team to outpace it while also ensuring that Nosepass is not setup bait. Volt Switch lets Nosepass pivot around and gain momentum while also hitting some of the most common entry hazard removers like Staryu and Kabuto for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sturdy ensures that Nosepass will be able to set up Stealth Rock most of the time. Berry Juice provides recovery, which handily reactivates Sturdy. The EVs invested in Defense and Special Defense maximize Nosepass's bulk, allowing it to take powerful attacks such as Knock Off from Doduo followed by Jump Kick and +2 Dark Pulse from Vullaby. A Relaxed nature is used to boost Nosepass's Defense further and decrease its Speed so that it is more likely to move last with Volt Switch. The remaining EVs are invested in Attack to increase Rock Blast damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Sometimes, it is ideal to lead with Nosepass so that Stealth Rock can be used as soon as possible; however, you should watch out for threats such as Taunt Onix and Mienfoo, which are often used as leads too. You should use Thunder Wave if a foe like Shellder is going to set up or if you want to decrease the foe's Speed so that Nosepass's team can deal with it more easily. You should also try to preserve Nosepass's Berry Juice by avoiding Knock Off. Alolan Grimer, Pawniard, and Mienfoo are all examples of common Knock Off users. Keep Nosepass healthy while the opponent has an entry hazard remover, so that Nosepass can set up Stealth Rock again if it gets removed, or Flying-type, so that Nosepass can continue to switch into it throughout the match. You can keep Nosepass healthy by using Volt Switch on predicted switches instead of immediately after taking hits. Be cautious if the opponent has Timburr, which could benefit from paralysis via Guts. It can also set up on Nosepass with Bulk Up. Additionally, you should be wary of Diglett, which can trap and remove Nosepass. You should switch Nosepass in on Pokemon that it can check such as Flying-types like Doduo for a safe opportunity to set up Stealth Rock. Volt Switch should be used to switch out and gain momentum, but be careful if the opponent has a Ground-type.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Foongus has great defensive synergy with Nosepass, checking Fighting-, Water-, Grass-, and Ground-type Pokemon for it, while Nosepass checks Fire- and Flying-types in return. Other Fighting-type checks like Snubbull and Spritzee make good teammates too. Water- and Ground-type checks include Pumpkaboo-XL, which can also spinblock to prevent opposing Rapid Spin users from removing Nosepass's Stealth Rock, and Staryu, which can also use Rapid Spin to prevent entry hazards from breaking Nosepass's Sturdy. Offensive threats that benefit from Nosepass's use of Stealth Rock, especially ones that appreciate a free switch from Volt Switch like Doduo and Abra, are good partners. Snivy synergizes well with Nosepass because it can use the Ground-types that Nosepass lures in as setup bait. Slow Pokemon that benefit from Nosepass's use of Thunder Wave like Alolan Grimer and Mudbray work well alongside Nosepass.</p>"

Its Steel / Rock typing gives it useful resistances, most notably to Fairy- and Flying-type attacks. However, its typing also gives it very common weaknesses to Water, Ground, and Fighting. Head Smash also has very low PP. It's difficult for Aron to set up on many things due to coverage moves such as Earthquake from Snubbull and Jump Kick from Doduo. Aron also has low Special Defense, meaning it can have a tough time switching in on special attacks. It faces competition from other setup sweepers that can be stronger and faster than a set-up Aron; Shell Smash users like Tirtouga and Shellder are particularly good examples. Aron also has very low Speed prior to a Rock Polish, meaning it can be KOed easily if it hasn't set up.</p>",

Curse is an option as a boosting move, but it forces Aron to forgo either a coverage move or Rock Polish, which it can't afford to lose due to its pitiful Speed. Heavy Slam with Heavy Metal gives Aron a strong Steel-type STAB move, thanks to Heavy Metal doubling Aron's weight, but it prevents Aron from using Head Smash without recoil. Magnet Rise mitigates Aron's crippling 4x weakness to Ground, but it also comes at the cost of replacing one of Aron's coverage moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Due to Aron's 4x weakness to Fighting-type attacks, defensive variants of Mienfoo and Timburr can both switch into a Head Smash and threaten Aron out with their STAB moves.

Head Smash is a STAB move that hits everything extremely hard and can even OHKO or 2HKO Rock-resistant threats such as Mienfoo without Eviolite after Stealth Rock. Heavy Slam hits the majority of Little Cup for consistent damage thanks to Aron's heavy weight. However, Iron Head can be used for a more reliable attack that has a chance to cause foes to flinch and also hits Pokemon that are heavier than Aron such as Onix harder. Earthquake hits Steel-types such as Magnemite and Pawniard and has perfect coverage alongside Head Smash. Superpower can be used to OHKO Pawniard and hit Ferroseed, which otherwise walls Aron.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With the given Speed EVs and a Jolly nature, Aron is fast enough to outspeed Timburr and Mareanie prior to setting up, and it is also able to outspeed Choice Scarf variants of Mienfoo and Pawniard at +2. Eviolite increases Aron's overall bulk, allowing it to survive Mach Punch from Timburr. The given Special Defense EVs allow Aron to take Vacuum Wave from Croagunk at full HP. Rock Head is important for allowing Aron to use Head Smash without recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Aron can switch into Pokemon that it defensively checks, such as Spritzee and Vullaby, as this allows it to immediately threaten the opposing switch-in with a strong Head Smash. Aron should be switched in on resisted hits like Moonblast or Brave Bird, as against Choice Scarf users like Doduo, this can usually force a switch, allowing it to get a free Rock Polish. Aron can use Head Smash against slower foes when it is at low HP to deal some damage before going down.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that resist Fighting-type moves, such as Spritzee and Snubbull, can help with Aron's 4x weakness to them. Grass-types such as Foongus and Pumpkaboo-XL can handle the Water- and Ground-types that greatly threaten Aron. Those Pokemon in particular can also switch into the Fighting-types that Aron hates. Stealth Rock setters such as Onix and Dwebble can be a huge help to Aron, as Stealth Rock support helps Aron get KOs on Pokemon it wouldn't KO otherwise; for example, after Stealth Rock, Earthquake can potentially OHKO frail Pawniard variants like Choice Scarf. Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr can lure Fairy- and Flying-types in for Aron to set up on and can provide Knock Off support to remove Eviolites from Pokemon that would otherwise survive a Head Smash. A Steel-type spam core with Pawniard can be used effectively, as Pawniard can also use Knock Off. Diglett with Groundium Z is able to trap and remove Staryu, Foongus, and Croagunk after Knock Off has been used to remove their Eviolites. Wynaut can trap and remove Croagunk and Timburr, giving Aron more breathing room to sweep.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Carvanha is the epitome of a glass cannon, with great offensive potential and almost nonexistent defensive abilities. With Speed Boost, Carvanha quickly becomes hard to outspeed, which generally can act to offset its paper-like defenses. However, Carvanha is reliant on KOing the opposition, as otherwise it is KOed in return. Thankfully, this is not too much of an issue, with Carvanha having two excellent STAB attacks and decent coverage options to support them. This makes Carvanha pretty hard to wall, especially considering its ability to act as either a physical or special attacker.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Poison Fang may seem like a smart idea for nailing Fairy-types, but most of these are hit hard enough by a Water-type attack, and those that are not are fairly easily handled by a teammate, making it seldom worth the moveslot. Similarly, Hidden Power Fire is appealing on the special set over Ice Beam, but this is only beneficial for exploiting Ferroseed's 4x Fire weakness and is thus overall less useful than Ice Beam. Destiny Bond can be great for picking up another KO and removing a check, which makes it incredibly useful for type spam teams, but Carvanha seldom finds room to utilize the move. Psychic Fangs is used over Zen Headbutt because it cannot miss and has slightly better damage rolls overall, though missing out on flinch chances can appear unappealing. Snarl can be a nice surprise on Carvanha to revenge Gastly or Abra through a Substitute, though its worse damage output overall is pretty detrimental and makes it almost always not ideal. Blizzard can be used over Ice Beam on hail teams, though this does make Carvanha less reliable overall. Rain Dance is the closest thing Carvanha has to a boosting move, but it'll almost never be able to set up and the power boost under rain is hardly worth the moveslot. Psychium Z is a decent option on Water- and Dark-type spam teams to lure in and beat some of Carvanha's checks, such as Mienfoo, Foongus, and Mareanie. However, the power boost from Life Orb is quite important for Carvanha to secure important KOs, so it is usually preferred over a Z-Crystal.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-type Priority</strong>: Carvanha's frailty allows Timburr's Mach Punch or Croagunk's Vacuum Wave to KO it from nearly full HP, and Carvanha can do little about it, especially to Croagunk, which is immune to Aqua Jet thanks to Dry Skin.</p> <p><strong>Stufful</strong>: With Fluffy, Stufful takes very little from any of Carvanha's physical attacks. With its naturally great bulk, even Hydro Pump does not do enough, making Stufful a great counter.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types are great at absorbing Carvanha's Dark-type attacks and don't mind Carvanha's Water-type moves. Snubbull destroys physical sets, while Spritzee is a generally decent answer to any set, though it must remain healthy. Cottonee and Morelull take little from either of Carvanha's STAB moves and hard wall physical Carvanha, though the former must beware an Ice Beam. Morelull is too bulky to mind either, though switching in is not always doable.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Ferroseed is annoying to Carvanha, since it survives any attack from a high HP; Eviolite Foongus and Mareanie fall under this category too. Eviolite Mienfoo, Chinchou, Eviolite Vullaby, and other naturally defensive Pokemon are also problematic due to surviving an attack and KOing back.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf 17+ Speed Pokemon</strong>: In general, Carvanha prevents Choice Scarf Pokemon from being too much of an issue, but sets lacking Protect struggle to get more than one Speed boost under their belt. This makes Carvanha suffer from being easily revenge killed by healthy Choice Scarf users that are naturally faster than Adamant Carvanha. Choice Scarf Mienfoo and Choice Scarf Chinchou are especially problematic due to almost never being in the KO range of Aqua Jet and always OHKOing Carvanha in return.</p>",

      "Physical Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Waterfall is by far Carvanha's best physical Water-type attack, being the most powerful and having a very useful flinch chance. Similarly, Crunch is its most powerful physical Dark-type STAB attack and therefore the best choice for this set. Psychic Fangs is used to complement the coverage offered by Carvanha's two STAB moves, dealing super effective damage against Foongus, Fighting-types, and Poison-types, which all generally otherwise do not mind Carvanha's offensive arsenal. The last slot goes to either Protect or Aqua Jet, as Protect allows for a guaranteed, safe Speed boost while having the upside of avoiding Fake Out damage, while Aqua Jet is again a really good priority option.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The HP IVs are lowered for a total of 19 HP, which lowers Life Orb recoil down to 1 HP per attack and consequently gives Carvanha a bit more longevity. The EV spread is fairly straightforward, maximizing Carvanha's crucial Attack stat to hit as hard as possible, while maximum Speed allows Carvanha to get off an initial attack easier and generally makes Carvanha harder to revenge kill. An Adamant nature is used, as the added power is far more impactful than the additional Speed gained from a Jolly nature.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Using Carvanha is rather straightforward, as the goal is to hit as hard as possible and KO as many Pokemon as possible. Carvanha should never switch in, as even resisted attacks can do over 50% damage to it. This does not mean Carvanha should not be used early-game, however; in fact, it is rather good at wallbreaking for itself early on in the match. Generally, Carvanha should just use its strongest attack, use Protect when a Speed boost is needed, or use Aqua Jet to pick off a weak and faster foe.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Carvanha is such an offensive Pokemon, it enjoys the support provided by a large number of Pokemon. Almost all Knock Off users make great teammates, benefiting Carvanha by removing Eviolites from opposing Pokemon, therefore weakening them substantially. Knock Off also has the added benefit of weakening Dark-resistant Pokemon for Carvanha. Entry hazard setters are also great at significantly weakening Pokemon for Carvanha, making the likes of Dwebble and Ferroseed great partners. Corphish and other Water-type powerhouses pair well with Carvanha, as they break apart their shared counters, opening the game up for one another; Dark-types such as Vullaby and Pawniard perform similarly. Fairy-type switch-ins such as Foongus and Ferroseed are especially great at pairing with Carvanha and Foongus also functions as a sturdy Fighting-type counter. Poison Jab Timburr is a great teammate too, as it lures in and weakens Fairy-types for Carvanha while also removing Eviolites.</p>"

Ice Beam makes a great coverage option, hitting the Grass-types that otherwise don't mind the set much, though the set still struggles against Fighting-types. Protect allows for a safe Speed boost while having a few other upsides such as dodging Fake Out damage and scouting opposing attacks. Surf is a viable though not nearly as useful option over Protect, as it provides a Water-type move that does not miss.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The HP IVs are lowered to 9 in order to hit 19 HP and therefore take only 1 HP of damage of Life Orb recoil. Life Orb is the item of choice for boosting Carvanha's power while maintaining the ability to switch attacks. The EV spread and nature aim to maximize Carvanha's damage output while giving it good Speed off the bat.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Carvanha plays in a pretty straightforward manner. This set aims to pick off normal Carvanha counters such as Snubbull by surprise, meaning Hydro Pump should be used with pretty high frequency. Carvanha should refrain from KOing low-health Pokemon that the opponent does not need to save, however, as otherwise this ruins the set's surprise factor. Similarly, Carvanha should refrain from switching in on an incoming attack due to its absurd frailty.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Carvanha relies on being able to KO opposing Pokemon to avoid being KOed, which naturally makes Knock Off users such as Pawniard and most Fighting-types very helpful. Removing Eviolites from Pokemon makes them far frailer and therefore easier to handle. Dark-type Pokemon in general make great teammates, as in tandem Carvanha and a fellow Dark-type will defeat their shared checks. Entry hazard setters such as Dwebble, Ferroseed, Onix, and even Diglett make great pairs with Carvanha, especially the former two, which have access to Spikes to rack up even more chip damage on Carvanha's checks. Other Water-types make good additions alongside Carvanha, as even the best Water-resistant Pokemon struggle against the combination of Carvanha and Corphish or Staryu. Ice-types, notably Alolan Sandshrew and Amaura, make excellent teammates as well thanks to their ability to weaken Water- and Grass-types for Carvanha.</p>"

Relying on Water Spout as an attacking move also means Wailmer is severely crippled by chip damage from entry hazards and priority moves, reducing its effectiveness. Its Speed allows many metagame threats such as Snivy and Gastly to outspeed it and KO it, as Wailmer isn't very bulky, which forces it to run Choice Scarf. Furthermore, its defensive stats leave it with mediocre bulk. Finally, Staryu and Frillish are better specially offensive Water-types, with the two former boasting better coverage, power, and Speed and the latter being a much better Water Spout user, which invalidates Wailmer's use on any serious team.</p>",

  "Numel": {
    "overview": "<p>Numel can turn into a powerful sweeper with its amazing ability Simple, doubling the magnitude of stat changes, which is complemented by its movepool with access to boosting moves like Flame Charge and Growth and powerful STAB options like Fire Blast and Earth Power. Numel also boasts a great typing, being able to check common Grass-, Steel-, and Fire-types like Ferroseed, Magnemite, and Larvesta and sporting an immunity to Thunder Wave as well as a near-unresisted STAB combination. However, this typing leaves Numel with two weaknesses to common types in Ground and Water, making it vulnerable to Diglett before a Flame Charge boost and extremely weak to Aqua Jet from the likes of Corphish and Tirtouga. Numel is also quite slow before a Flame Charge boost, meaning it's susceptible to faster Pokemon, and even with a Flame Charge boost, it is still outsped by fast Choice Scarf users such as Doduo and Gastly. It's not very strong before a Growth boost either, meaning it requires both boosts to be really effective, which will rarely happen in a match because of how fast paced and offensive the LC metagame is. Lastly, Numel faces competition from Ponyta and Larvesta as an offensive Fire-type due to their reliability, with Ponyta sporting recovery and a better Speed stat and Larvesta being able to pivot while sporting a Fighting-type resistance.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Numel can run a slower and bulkier utility set with Stealth Rock, Will-O-Wisp, and Lava Plume; however, it loses to all common spinners in the metagame, making it not very viable. Ancient Power lets Numel hit Archen and Mantyke, which both resist its STAB moves, and has a chance to boost all of its stats by two stages thanks to Simple, but it is weaker than Fire Blast and Earth Power otherwise. Yawn gives setup opportunities to Numel, as it either forces a switch or makes the foe fall asleep, but it is hard to fit on a set. RestTalk can be run as a form of recovery, with Stockpile able to bolster Numel's defenses by two, but this is better done by bulkier Pokemon like Mudbray. Sunny Day is an option to make Growth drastically raise Numel's Special Attack and power up Fire-type moves, but Numel already runs too many setup moves for a third to be considered.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Numel's glaring 4x weakness to Water and lack of Speed before a Flame Charge boost leave it easily checked by the likes of Staryu and Chinchou. Aqua Jet users like Corphish and Tirtouga are especially troublesome, since they can bypass any Flame Charge boosts Numel has acquired. Mantyke, although rare, is the best counter to Numel, as it resists Fire Blast and is immune to Earth Power, making the rare Ancient Power Numel's only way to deal damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Bulkier Ground-types such as Mudbray and Hippopotas aren't 2HKOed by Numel's attacks before Growth and can retaliate and OHKO with Earthquake before recovering any damage taken with Rest or Slack Off. Diglett and Drilbur also outspeed and OHKO Numel if it hasn't used Flame Charge beforehand.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Choice Scarf users such as Doduo and Gastly can pick off Numel after a single Flame Charge, while priority users like Timburr can ignore any Flame Charge boosts Numel has obtained.</p> <p><strong>Archen</strong>: Archen is a good counter to Numel, as it is one of two viable Pokemon that resist both of Numel's STAB types, only fearing the rare Ancient Power, and can OHKO Numel with an Earthquake.</p>",

      "Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flame Charge is a vital move, as it doubles Numel's Speed stat thanks to Simple while dealing some chip damage, allowing it to outspeed the majority of the metagame. Fire Blast is a powerful STAB move that is able to OHKO Foongus after Stealth Rock before a boost, and after a Growth boost, only Fire-resistant Pokemon and very bulky Pokemon like Spritzee aren't OHKOed by it. Earth Power provides great and accurate neutral coverage with Fire Blast and nails Rock-, Electric-, and Fire-types such as Onix, Elekid, and Ponyta while giving Numel a way to damage Water-types, though it needs a boost from Growth or Groundium Z to do serious damage to them. Growth is used to double Numel's Special Attack stat, giving Numel some much-needed firepower for non-Groundium Z sets and, when combined with a Flame Charge boost, making Numel a terrifying sweeper. If you're running Groundium Z, Stealth Rock is a nice option, as the Special Attack boost from Growth isn't really needed, allowing Numel to set entry hazards if they aren't on the field already.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Simple is mandatory for this set to function, since it doubles all the stat increases from Flame Charge and Growth. Maximum Special Attack investment with a Modest nature is used to make Numel deal as much damage as possible. 236 Speed EVs are used so that Numel outspeeds 17 Speed Choice Scarf users after a Flame Charge, with the remaining EVs going into HP to boost it by one point. Eviolite is used to give Numel more bulk so it can more easily tank attacks and set up on more Pokemon, while Berry Juice provides recovery Numel much desires to set up on Pokemon it walls. Groundium Z transforms Earth Powerinto a 175-Base Power Tectonic Rage that lets Numel nuke a threat when performing a sweep; for example, it is capable of OHKOing defensive Staryu after Stealth Rock damage and dealing significant damage to bulky Pokemon like Spritzee. A Timid nature could be run to outspeed Choice Scarf Doduo and Gastly, which could otherwise revenge kill Numel after a Flame Charge boost, but the loss of power isn't very favorable.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Numel functions as a late-game sweeper, so it is best to remove any checks and counters, especially Aqua Jet users like Corphish and Tirtouga, before sending Numel in. It should also be switched in on Pokemon it threatens out or Pokemon that can't do much damage to it, like Ferroseed, Magnemite, and Pumpkaboo-XL, to let Numel more easily set up with Flame Charge or Growthor get Stealth Rock up. Flame Charge should generally be used before Growth, as Numel is quite slow before a boost and will likely be outsped and KOed by a switch-in otherwise. Groundium Z sets can work as a lure to Staryu wanting to switch in and trying to remove entry hazards and check Numel, OHKOing them after Stealth Rock damage. It is also useful for taking out a very bulky Pokemon such as Spritzee or Timburr during a sweep. On sets that lack Groundium Z, Numel should tank a hit to set up either Growth or Flame Charge, as it wants both boosts to be able to safely sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Grass-types such as Foongus and Snivy can deal with the Water- and Ground-types that otherwise check Numel. Even if Numel decides to run Stealth Rock, entry hazard support from Onix, Dwebble, or Ferroseed is still appreciated, as it means Numel doesn't have to risk setting up Stealth Rock itself, giving it an easier time sweeping. Ferroseed is an especially great partner for Numel, as its Grass typing lets it come in on common Water-types and set up entry hazards on them. Knock Off users like Mienfoo, Timburr, and Vullaby soften up bulkier Pokemon like Spritzee and opposing Vullaby, making it easier for Numel to break through them. Mienfoo can even lure in Pokemon Numel beats, such as Pumpkaboo-XL and Foongus, and pivot Numel in with U-turn, making it a great teammate. Memento users such as Diglett and Cottonee lower the foe's offenses while safely bringing Numel in, providing it with more setup opportunities. Staryu makes for a great partner, as it can deal with Water- and Ground-types with its coverage moves and is able to remove Sticky Web, which otherwise halves Numel's Speed, thus requiring an extra turn of setup. It is also able to lure in Ferroseed and Pumpkaboo-XL, Pokemon that Numel can set up on. Alolan Vulpix provides Numel with much-needed bulk and survivability via Aurora Veil support, making it a lot easier for Numel to set up.</p>"

  "Corphish": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to Adaptability and a decent offensive typing, Corphish is a fantastic choice for many offensive teams. A combination of Knock Off and Crabhammer means that even Pokemon that resist Crabhammer are usually unable to safely switch into Corphish more than once, rendering it an extremely potent wallbreaker. It is also very useful against offense, as its Adaptability Aqua Jet is one of the strongest priority moves in the metagame. Boosting moves such as Swords Dance and Dragon Dance allow it to attempt a sweep with a small amount of support. Corphish struggles somewhat with its mediocre bulk and sub-par Speed, but it is usually fast enough to outspeed most walls. However, despite its good movepool, it does not have enough moveslots to fit all the moves that it wants, and will sometimes struggle against common Pokemon such as Foongus and Croagunk.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Life Orb drastically decreases Corphish's bulk and makes it more difficult to set up compared to Eviolite, but turns Aqua Jet into an even more potent revenge killing tool, and allows Corphish to 2HKO any Pokemon that doesn't resist Crabhammer. Hydro Vortex can be used as a gigantic nuke that deals tons of damage, pretty much ensuring an OHKO on anything that takes the hit. Supersonic Skystrike can KO Foongus and Cottonee after a bit of prior damage and after they have been lured in. Sludge Bomb is an option to surprise Cottonee but has little use otherwise. Superpower can be used to dent Lileep and Ferroseed, two Pokemon that otherwise counter Corphish. Z-Rain Dance can be used to gain +1 Speed and deal a ton of damage with Rain-boosted Water-type moves; however, it does not have a lot of bulk without Eviolite, making it harder to set up. Waterfall can be used over Crabhammer, but Corphish will miss out on a lot of damage and some crucial KOs. Choice Band Switcheroo can be used to deal a lot of damage and to give an enemy Pokemon a useless item while receiving a more useful item in return.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-resistant Walls</strong>: Croagunk, Ferroseed, Foongus, Cottonee, and Chinchou all check Corphish quite well. Croagunk is the single most effective counter to Corphish, as it resists or absorbs all of Corphish's common attacks. Ferroseed can tank a Knock Off, resists Water-type attacks, and can retaliate with Bullet Seed. Foongus is able to consistently switch into Corphish's attacks thanks to its ability, Regenerator. Cottonee resists both of Corphish's STAB attacks, and can also Taunt Corphish or Encore Corphish into its set up move. Chinchou resists Corphish's STAB attacks and can KO it with an Electric-type attack. Mareanie resists Crabhammer and can tank Knock Off, but struggles to do much in return. Note that most of these except for Croagunk can be muscled through once their defensive items have been Knocked Off and Corphish has set up a Swords Dance. Lileep, though uncommon, can absorb Water-type attacks, but it needs to watch out for a potential Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Fast Offensive Threats</strong>: Due to Corphish's low Speed, it can be threatened by faster Pokemon that check it. These Pokemon include Chinchou, Magnemite, Mienfoo, Cottonee, and Snivy. However, they usually do not appreciate switching in, as they take a lot of damage, and they also have to be careful of Corphish Dragon Dancing.</p>",

      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Crabhammer is an extremely powerful STAB attack which, thanks to Adaptability, hits insanely hard, dealing a lot of damage to even Pokemon that resist it. Aqua Jet is a powerful priority move that allows Corphish to pick off weakened threats and can allow it to sweep with a Swords Dance boost. Knock Off allows Corphish to remove items such as Eviolite and Choice Scarf and weaken its checks such as Foongus and Chinchou. Swords Dance boosts Corphish's Attack, making it into a massive threat that can at worst 2HKO most of the LC metagame.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Adaptability is used to boost Corphish's STAB attacks, making it into a fearsome wallbreaker. The EV spread maximizes Attack and Speed, reaching 18 Attack and 13 Speed, which allows Corphish to attack as hard as possible while still being able to outspeed walls such as defensive Mudbray and Spritzee. Eviolite is used to increase Corphish's bulk, giving it more opportunities to set up. Adamant is used to maximize Attack, allowing Corphish to hit as hard as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Removing enemy items such as Berry Juice and Eviolite can be very helpful for Corphish and its teammates, so try to hit opposing switch-ins with Knock Off. Try to keep Corphish alive against bulkier teams, as it can deal with those types of teams well thanks to its ability to wallbreak. Use Swords Dance to clean up when the enemy team is at low health near the end of a game, or use it near the beginning to put large holes in the enemy team to allow the rest of your team to clean up. Corphish can take advantage of the switches that it forces to set up Swords Dance.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Corphish can help wallbreak for other Water-type sweepers such as Tirtouga, Omanyte, and Carvanha, which all appreciate the Knock Off support that Corphish gives. Corphish has no way to recover health, and as such cannot recover from entry hazard damage, so a way to get rid of hazards is wanted. Staryu is a very reliable spinner that can get rid of entry hazards for Corphish. Diglett can trap and KO Chinchou and can also KO Cottonee with Sludge Bomb, two Pokemon that are able to check Corphish. Corphish appreciates Sticky Web support, as it slows down the enemy team, allowing it to outspeed a number of Pokemon, such as Mienfoo and Elekid, and deal tons of damage. Grass-type checks are helpful, as many Grass-types are able to threaten Corphish. Ponyta, Vullaby, and Rufflet are all able to check Grass-types. Hazard setters such as Ferroseed and Dwebble deal residual damage to enemy Pokemon, allowing Corphish to pick up more KOs.</p>"

      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Crabhammer is Corphish's most powerful STAB move. Aqua Jet picks off weakened Pokemon before Corphish obtains a Dragon Dance boost.

Aerial Ace can be used to hit Grass-types such as Foongus, and Cottonee, and Croagunk, which are otherwise immune to or resist all of Corphish's attacks. However, Corphish will have to give up Aqua Jet, which means that it cannot hit Choice Scarf users that outspeed it after a Dragon Dance boost. Dragon Dance boosts both Attack and Speed, making Corphish into a scary sweeper that can clean up late-game.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Adaptability is used to boost Corphish's STAB attacks, making it into a fearsome wallbreaker. The EVs maximize Attack and Speed while allowing Corphish's Defense to hit an Eviolite number. A Jolly nature is used to reach 14 Speed, which after a Dragon Dance, lets Corphish reach 21 Speed, which outspeeds the entire unboosted LC metagame. An Adamant nature leaves Corphish to tie with 19 Speed Pokemon such as Staryu and outsped by Elekid and Diglett after a boost, but noticeably increases its damage. Eviolite is used to give Corphish more bulk, giving it a better chance of setting up, and allowing Corphish to take priority attacks better as well.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be careful when using Corphish early-game, as it can be easily worn down, making it harder to set up later in the game. Use Corphish late-game to sweep after checks such as Foongus, Cottonee, and Croagunk are weakened. Corphish can be used to weaken its own checks with Knock Off early in the game. Use Aqua Jet to pick off weakened or frail opposing Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Other Water-type sweepers such as Tirtouga, Omanyte, and Carvanha can help weaken mutual checks so that Corphish can sweep. Diglett can trap and KO most of Corphish's checks such as Croagunk, Chinchou, and Cottonee with Sludge Bomb. Entry hazards help weaken the enemy team to give Corphish a better chance of sweeping; Ferroseed and Dwebble are two good options for this. Wallbreakers can help Corphish break through walls a lot better, such as Ice Punch Timburr, which can lure in and defeat Grass-types such as Cottonee and Foongus.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Lileep is arguably one of the best Water-type checks in LC. It has access to Storm Drain, a very handy tool that lets it absorb Water-type moves and boost its already decent Special Attack by one stage; this allows it to check the majority of Water-types in the tier, such as Chinchou, Mareanie, Tirtouga, and Corphish. It also sports impressive natural bulk that is further boosted by Eviolite, which lets it switch in on moves that are weak or resisted with ease. Furthermore, it has access to Stealth Rock, which is very useful for weakening the opposing team, and Lileep can easily set it up thanks to its bulk and its ability. On top of that, Giga Drain and Recover grant it solid forms of recovery and the ability to stay around for much longer. However, like most defensive Pokemon, Lileep has poor Speed, meaning that it will almost always take a hit before moving, and despite its decent Special Attack, it suffers from mediocre damage output, even after a Storm Drain boost. While it has impressive bulk, its typing leaves it weak to common Steel-, Fighting-, and Ice-type moves, with that last weakness being quite a nuisance because almost any Water-type that Lileep checks tends to carry Ice Beam. Finally, its tanking abilities are severely hindered by both Knock Off and Toxic.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lileep has access to Curse to boost its Attack and Defense; however, this set is more susceptible to burns and Intimidate and does not use Storm Drain to its maximum potential. Lileep doesn't have many viable coverage options, but it can run Hidden Power to specifically hit some Pokemon, such as Hidden Power Fire for Ferroseed and Grass-types in general or Hidden Power Fighting for more damage against Pawniard and Dark-types; however, these moves are difficult to fit in a slot because Lileep needs Recover, its STAB move, and either Earth Power or Stealth Rock. Mirror Coat can surprise the opponent and remove a special sweeper such as Gastly or Abra, but it is then easily played around. Finally, Lileep has access to Sandstorm and so can act as a secondary weather setter for dedicated sand teams; unfortunately, it lacks a moveslot for it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Lileep has a hard time against Steel-types because it can only hit them with Earth Power. Magnemite can take a Earth Power thanks to Sturdy and severely damage Lileep with STAB Flash Cannon. Pawniard hates taking an Earth Power, but it can KO Lileep with STAB Iron Head or remove its Eviolite with a powerful Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types outspeed Lileep and severely damage it with a STAB move. Timburr can come in on Toxic and activate Guts, severely hurting Lileep with STAB Drain Punch. Croagunk walls Lileep lacking Earth Power and can use it to set up Nasty Plot.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Lileep has nothing to hit Grass-types with beside the rare Hidden Power Fire. Ferroseed can set up entry hazards on Lileep, is immune to Toxic, and can threaten Lileep with Iron Head or Knock Off. Foongus fears nothing from Lileep and can hit it with Sludge Bomb. Due to Lileep's passivity, Snivy can use it to boost its Special Attack with Contrary Leaf Storm without fearing anything.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Lileep is quite passive; this makes it a setup bait for Pokemon such as Bulk Up Timburr, Dragon Dance Scraggy, and Swords Dance Mienfoo.</p> <p><strong>Toxic Poison</strong>: While it doesn't mind being paralyzed or burned, Lileep hates being poisoned; Toxic and Toxic Spikes can heavily reduce Lileep's longevity.</p>",

Stealth Rock is used to inflict chip damage whenever the opponent switches a Pokemon in, and it works well with Lileep's ability to force out Water-types. For the last slot, Ancient Power is a STAB move that allows Lileep to hit Flying-types such as Doduo, Rufflet, and Archen. On the other hand, Earth Power allows Lileep to hit opposing Steel-types such as Magnemite, Pawniard and Honedge. Finally, Toxic puts opposing walls such as Munchlax and Spritzee on a timer and is a good source of chip damage in tandem with Stealth Rock; however, keep in mind that the damage from Toxic adds up very slowly because of LC's low HP stats.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread when used with Eviolite maximizes Lileep's bulk; a Bold nature further boosts Lileep's Defense, allowing it to sponge physical hits better. Its special bulk is not a thing to underestimate either, as when Lileep is equipped with Eviolite, it can avoid the 2HKO from Choice Scarf Chinchou's Ice Beam and OHKO Chinchou in return after Stealth Rock damage. 108 Special Attack EVs guarantee that Lileep can 2HKO Steel-types such as Magnemite and Pawniard most of the time with Earth Power. 12 Speed EVs let Lileep Speed tie with Spritzee and outspeed Munchlax, allowing Lileep to use Toxic on it before it can do anything. Storm Drain is useful for absorbing Water-type moves and boosting Lileep's Special Attack by one stage in the process.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lileep can be directly switched in on Water-type moves because of its ability. It can come in on a plethora of Water-types, such as Chinchou, Mareanie, Tirtouga, Corphish ( though it dislikes Knock Off), and Carvanha. It can also check Foongus, Ponyta, and Ferroseed—be wary of Iron Head and Knock Off though—and can easily set up Stealth Rock on any of them. Recover should be used on any predicted switch, as it restores Lileep's health, allowing it to stay around for longer; Lileep has no trouble pulling Recover off thanks to its unique set of resistances. When facing a Water-type, Lileep should prioritize setting up Stealth Rock because it can afford to take an Ice Beam. After Stealth Rock has been set up, Lileep should either switch out or start using Giga Drain to restore its health. Note that a boosted Giga Drain can hit the majority of Water-types hard. Be wary of set up sweepers like Scraggy, Timburr, and Spritzee coming in on Lileep and starting to set up, as Lileep can't do anything to stop them and this could potentially allow them to sweep your entire team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hippopotas is an exceptional partner because it can remove Steel-types for Lileep, but most importantly has access to Sand Stream, which sets sand to boost Lileep's Special Defense by 50%; in exchange, Lileep stops the Water-types that scare Hippopotas away. Partners that can handle Fighting-types are appreciated because Lileep has issues against them. Snubbull is a prime example, boasting Intimidate and a Fairy typing that enable it to come in on them. Spritzee lacks Intimidate, but it can heal Lileep's possible status ailments thanks to Aromatherapy and KO most Fighting-types with Moonblast. Pawniard is difficult for Lileep to face if it lacks Earth Power, and even if it has the move, the Special Defense drop can trigger Defiant. Fighting-types such as Timburr and Mienfoo pair well with Lileep because they stop Pawniard; Timburr is a bit better because it can also stop set up sweepers thanks to its priority moves. Lileep is a nice partner for Pokemon that struggle against bulky Water-types; examples are Carvanha, Ponyta, and Corphish, which can easily wallbreak or clean when Water-types have been removed or weakened. While not mandatory, Lileep likes the presence of a Defog or Rapid Spin user because it dislikes taking damage from entry hazards. Phazers like Roar Mudbray and Haze users such as Mareanie can put a stop to setup sweepers if they set up on Lileep; both of them also check Fighting- and Steel-types and, in Mudbray's case, forces the foe to take damage from the Stealth Rock that Lileep sets. Speaking of entry hazards, more of them are useful for Lileep by doing some chip damage to the foe; the aforementioned Mareanie can set up Toxic Spikes, while Dwebble can set up Spikes.</p>"

  "Anorith": {
    "overview": "<p>Anorith's access to Knock Off, Stealth Rock, and Rapid Spin gives it excellent role compression to support the team with. Its great 18 Speed tier makes it the second fastest Stealth Rock user in the tier, only behind Diglett. It also has an excellent Attack stat, one of the highest in the metagame, so it can hit quite hard. However, Anorith faces competition from Onix and Dwebble as an entry hazard setter and from Drilbur and Staryu as a spinner due to their greater reliability. Anorith is also pretty frail, with a very bad defensive typing that only gives it a resistance to two uncommon offensive typings and a weakness to Aqua Jet, Bullet Punch, and Stealth Rock, making it hard to switch in and remove entry hazards. Anorith also has trouble dealing with the common Fighting-types due to its small movepool, and it's completely countered by Staryu because it can KO Anorith before it can move and then remove its entry hazards with Rapid Spin.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Anorith can use a Swords Dance set to make use of its great Attack and Speed, but it's quite hard to set up. It can utilize Aerial Ace to hit Fighting-types, Brick Break to OHKO Pawniard, or X-Scissor as a secondary STAB move, but these moves are hard to fit in over the great Rock Blast and Knock Off. Anorith can be run as a rain sweeper with Swift Swim, but rain isn't very viable in LC due to a lack of Drizzle users. Anorith can run Rock Polish with an Adamant nature to outspeed almost all of the tier, but it has a tough time getting past bulky foes. Rock Slide and Stone Edge can be used over Rock Blast, but LC's multi-hit damage rolls favor Rock Blast. Aqua Jet can be used if the priority is needed, but it's very weak otherwise.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Diglett, Ponyta, and Abra can switch in and check Anorith. Choice Scarf Pokemon are even more dangerous, since it can be hard to tell if they're holding one until they move first and KO Anorith.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types like Chinchou, Mareanie, and Shellder are able to super effectively hit Anorith with Scald and, in the latter's case, Rock Blast. Tirtouga, Corphish, and Carvanha can net a quick KO on Anorith with Aqua Jet. Staryu gets a special mention, as it is faster than Anorith, can KO Anorith before it can attack, and removes the entry hazards set up by Anorith.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types like Onix and Omanyte give Anorith a hard time, since they don't take much damage from its moves and can OHKO Anorith with Rock Blast and Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Both Pawniard and Magnemite can take some hits from Anorith and deal back super effective damage. Ferroseed doesn't take much damage from any of Anorith's attacks and hurts it with Iron Barbs.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Croagunk all wall Anorith's attacks if it doesn't carry the rare Aerial Ace and can hit hard with a neutral attack or set up.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Anorith makes good use of Stealth Rock, as its great Speed allows it to set up the entry hazard before it gets hit by Taunt or KOed. Rapid Spin is used to eliminate entry hazards laid by the opponent during the battle. Knock Off is a great move for crippling Eviolite users and limiting Berry Juice users, and it also hits Ghost-types so that they don't block it from using Rapid Spin. Rock Blast is used over Stone Edge for better accuracy and to break through Substitutes, beat Focus Sash and Sturdy Pokemon like Dwebble and Surskit, and exploit Weak Armor Pokemon such as Vullaby.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Berry Juice is Anorith's only way to recover HP by itself; it allows Anorith to have more time to set up and remove entry hazards as well as attack the foe. A Jolly nature and 236 Speed EVs are required for Anorith to reach 18 Speed, which lets it outspeed Pokemon such as Archen and Mienfoo. 236 EVs are put into Attack to maximize Anorith's power and to 2HKO Pumpkaboo-XL and Frillish with Knock Off. The remaining EVs go into Defense to take physical attacks better. Battle Armor prevents the occasional critical hit from happening; Swift Swim doesn't benefit this set.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Anorith functions as a good lead because of its great Speed in conjunction with Stealth Rock. It can also remove entry hazards set by the opposing lead thanks to Rapid Spin. The best time to use Rapid Spin, however, is when entry hazard setters on the opponent's team are gone. Beware of Onix, as it easily beats Anorith with Rock Blast. Knock Off should be used if Rock Blast won't KO or if the foe still has its item. Anorith can be used to revenge kill Pokemon that are slower than it due to its great Attack and Speed, such as Archen, Rufflet, and Vullaby. Anorith shouldn't be sent out against Pokemon faster than it such as Staryu, Choice Scarf Doduo, and Choice Scarf Chinchou, as they'll likely KO Anorith before it can do anything.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting- and Ground-types such as Timburr and Mudbray can switch in on the Rock-types that Anorith hates like Onix and Tirtouga and drive them off as well as hit Steel-types like Magnemite and Pawniard. Foongus and Cottonee are both able to switch in on Fighting-, Rock-, and Water-types thanks to their typings. Ferroseed resists all of Anorith's weaknesses and can set up Spikes to stack entry hazards, while Anorith can hit the Flying- and Fire-types that threaten Ferroseed with Rock Blast. Sweepers such as Shellder, Scraggy, and Pawniard benefit from Anorith's ability to eliminate entry hazards, set up its own, and remove items with Knock Off.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Duskull's great Defense and Special Defense coupled with a rather good utility movepool make it look like a considerable utility Pokemon. In actuality, the rest of its stats are very poor, having a limited offensive movepool and no access to recovery. Firstly, Duskull's Ghost typing leaves it weak to the common Knock Off and doesn't give it useful resistances, since almost every Fighting-type carries the move. Duskull is also very passive, which allows setup sweepers that don't mind its moveset, such as Clamperl and Omanyte, to set up on it. As a wall, Duskull is outclassed by the likes of Ferroseed and Mudbray due to its typing and passivity but also because it does nothing useful while walling, whereas Ferroseed can set entry hazards and use Knock Off and Mudbray is hard to switch into. Duskull's lack of reliable recovery hinders its ability to wall as well.</p>",

Duskull is also unable to spread status effectively, as its low Speed means it'll take a hit first.</p>"}},

  "Wynaut": {
    "overview": "<p>Wynaut is the only Pokemon with Shadow Tag in the current LC metagame, which allows it to trap any non-Ghost-type Pokemon. What separates it from the other trappers in LC is that it boasts an amazing base 95 HP stat, one of the highest in the tier, compensating for its otherwise mediocre defensive stats. However, due to its poor movepool with very few useful options in Counter, Mirror Coat, Encore, Safeguard, and Tickle, its offensive value is null. Thanks to Wynaut's great HP stat, Counter and Mirror Coat will almost always result in OHKOs or 2HKOs, and Encore alongside to Shadow Tag can give defensive threats problems. Unfortunately, Wynaut lacks the Speed required to reliably pull off its status moves, and it also lacks recovery, besides Berry Juice. While Psychic is a good defensive typing that allows Wynaut to take Fighting-type attacks, it makes it vulnerable to Knock Off, which is very common, and U-turn, which significantly damages Wynaut and makes its ability to trap Pokemon useless.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Charm can be used over Tickle to more quickly weaken physical attackers, but it's almost completely outclassed by Tickle due to the latter's ability to lower the foe's Defense. Destiny Bond can be used over Safeguard for KOing any Pokemon that has weakened it, but sometimes, it's pretty important to save Wynaut for threats that its team can't otherwise beat. A faster EV spread of 132 Def / 52 SpD / 252 Spe with a Timid nature allows Wynaut to outpace Timburr and Shell Smash users before a boost, but this significantly reduces its bulk. A bulkier EV spread of 236 HP / 132 Def / 132 SpD with a Calm or Bold nature can be used to stomach more hits, but it misses out on outspeeding Foongus. Psychium Z can be used over Berry Juice to get a 100-BP Shattered Psyche from Mirror Coat, but it's not worth the itemslot outside of beating Croagunk, as Mirror Coat typically deals more damage due to Wynaut's HP, and this causes Wynaut to lose its only way to recover its health. Eviolite further boosts Wynaut's defenses to tank more hits, but it makes Wynaut lose out on its only method of recovery.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types like Pawniard, Alolan Grimer, and Scraggy can hinder Wynaut a lot, as they can KO it easily with their STAB attacks, are immune to Mirror Coat, and the former two are able to Pursuit trap it.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types like Gastly and Pumpkaboo aren't affected by Shadow Tag or Counter and can KO Wynaut with a STAB attack.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Wynaut struggles a lot against Knock Off users like Mienfoo, Pawniard, and Alolan Grimer, as losing its Berry Juice makes it unable to recover.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Pokemon that use Taunt like Mienfoo and Onix can give Wynaut trouble, as it can only use Counter and Mirror Coat and becomes useless against them if they play carefully around it.</p> <p><strong>VoltTurn users</strong>: U-turn and Volt Switch users like Mienfoo and Chinchou can switch out safely to a Ghost- or Dark-type that is immune to Counter or Mirror Coat and avoid getting trapped by Wynaut while denting it.</p>",

      "Trapper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Counter and Mirror Coat reflect any damage from physical and special moves for double of the taken damage, OHKOing or 2HKOing most Pokemon thanks to Wynaut's high HP. Encore forces the foe to use its most recent move, which becomes handy if the foe used a move that Wynaut can resist, or a non-damaging move like Stealth Rock. It also ensures that Wynaut will know that opposing Pokemon are going to attack it next turn; coupled with its Berry Juice, this could mean a successful KO with Counter or Mirror Coat, or it could let Wynaut switch to a pivot that can handle the foe better, preserving Wynaut for later. Tickle lowers the foe's Attack and Defense by one stage, rendering them more vulnerable to Pursuit from a teammate if the foe refuses to attack and making physical attackers weaker. Wynaut can also run Safeguard, which protects it and its team from any status effects. Both moves benefit from Shadow Tag and can give setup opportunities to a teammate.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>156 EVs in HP give Wynaut more survivability and increase the power of Counter and Mirror Coat, reaching 28 HP. 132 EVs are invested in both Defense and Special Defense to raise them by 2 points each, making it easy for Wynaut to take physical and special hits. 12 EVs in Speed allow it to outspeed passive threats like Foongus and Ferroseed and protect itself from their respective status attacks with Safeguard. A Bold nature is used to raise Wynaut's Defense and tank physical hits quite easily. Berry Juice provides Wynaut the ability to recover when it is dropped below half health, allowing it to keep tanking hits.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If Wynaut is facing a Foongus or Mareanie, use Safeguard to protect it from status, and if either foe has used a status attack, use Encore on it. This makes them useless, and Wynaut can either PP stall them if they are slower or use free turns to switch to a sweeper and set up in order to KO them. Before Wynaut comes in, it is recommended to KO Ghost-types like Gastly and Pumpkaboo, as well as Pursuit trappers like Pawniard, Alolan Grimer, and Stunky, as they hinder Wynaut. Wynaut should enter versus slow, passive, and bulky Pokemon, due to its passivity and low Speed. Wynaut mustn't be sent in even against attacks that it resists. Instead, it should be sent in to revenge kill and hinder its foe, having full health if possible. If it faces a setup sweeper that is faster than it, Wynaut should use Encore as soon as possible and switch to a Pokemon that can beat it easily. If the setup sweeper is slower, switch to a Pokemon that can take its attacks after the boost. Use Encore to trap a foe into a move like Stealth Rock, and then bring in a setup sweeper or use Tickle to reduce the foe's offensive stats in order to obtain setup opportunities.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Setup sweepers appreciate support from Wynaut's Tickle and Encore; Shell Smash users like Shellder and Tirtouga and other setup sweepers such as Corphish and Carvanha can take advantage of Wynaut's support to either safely set up or sweep. Wynaut really appreciates Pokemon that can beat Dark-types. Thus, Timburr, Mienfoo, and Scraggy are good partners for it, as they can take on threats such as Pawniard and Carvanha. Wynaut appreciates Ghost-types such as Gastly and Pumpkaboo being removed. Pursuit trappers such as Alolan Grimer and Pawniard, as well as more uncommon options such as Stunky and Munchlax, appreciate the support from Encore + Shadow Tag to be brought in safely, and they can face and Pursuit trap Ghost-types easily with their bulk or Speed. Momentum is nice to bring Wynaut onto the field; Pokemon such as Mienfoo, Vullaby, Magnemite, and Chinchou act as pivots and help Wynaut to get in.</p>"

Additionally, after it has used Shell Smash, its lowered defensive stats leave it incredibly vulnerable to priority attacks. It is also outclassed by Omanyte, which has a better typing, is less reliant on having a specific item, and is bulkier, allowing for easier set up. However, Clamperl does hit far harder and, unlike Omanyte, is not weak to Mach Punch or Vacuum Wave, which is more important than Omanyte's resistance to Flying-type attacks now that Gale Wings has been nerfed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Clamperl has a very shallow movepool, which means there are not too many viable options outside of those listed above. Hidden Power Electric can be used to hit bulky Water-types that are neutral to Grass such as Tentacool, Mareanie, Skrelp, and Mantyke, but none of those are common enough to make it worth running the move, and one of the most common Water-types, Chinchou, absorbs it. Hidden Power Fire can be used to OHKO Ferroseed, which can otherwise survive Surf or Ice Beam and KO Clamperl.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Clamperl is quite frail, leaving it vulnerable to being revenge killed by priority attacks after using Shell Smash. Priority moves such as Mach Punch and Sucker Punch are carried by Pokemon such as Timburr and Pawniard. Cottonee can also use Encore or Taunt to lock Clamperl into Shell Smash or prevent setup.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Fast Choice Scarf users such as Doduo are able to outspeed and KO Clamperl even after a Shell Smash. SturdyJuice users such as Magnemite, Onix, and Dwebble are all able to revenge kill Clamperl thanks to their ability. Focus Sash Abra can also beat Clamperl, as it survives any attack due to its item and is able to KO in return with Energy Ball or Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Very bulky Pokemon such as Ferroseed and Munchlax can usually take at least one hit and either KO or cripple Clamperl with some status move. Munchlax is also able to phaze it with Whirlwind, forcing Clamperl to set up again should it want to regain its boosts.

      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash brings Clamperl's Special Attack to insane levels, allowing it to OHKO most of the LC metagame. Shell Smash also raises its Speed so that it can outspeed the majority of Pokemon in LC. Surf is Clamperl's strongest STAB attack and is incredibly powerful, making it often Clamperl's most-used attack. Ice Beam is a useful coverage move that can deal with Grass-types, such as Foongus and Cottonee, and Dry Skin Croagunk. Hidden Power Grass can be used to hit bulky Water-types that resist Surf and Ice Beam such as Chinchou and Frillish. Alternatively, Substitute allows Clamperl to set up Shell Smash more easily and to avoid Sucker Punches from Pokemon such as Pawniard and Stunky.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread puts as many points into Special Attack and Speed as possible to give Clamperl the best chance for sweeping the enemy team. The remaining EVs are put into HP to raise it by one point. Timid gives Clamperl enough Speed to outspeed 16 or 17 Speed Choice Scarf Users such as Mienfoo and Chinchou after using Shell Smash. Rattled slightly discourages the usage of Knock Off and U-turn against Clamperl by making it more difficult to revenge-kill. Deep Sea Tooth doubles Clamperl's Special Attack, making it incredibly hard to switch into, especially after a Shell Smash.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Clamperl can set up at any point in the game. During the early-game it can set up and soften the enemy team to allow for a teammate to clean up, while Clamperl can also set up late-game to sweep weakened teams. You should be very careful while setting up, as Clamperl is incredibly frail and will usually only get one chance to set up. Make sure to get rid of the opponent's priority move users such as Timburr and Pawniard and to weaken bulky special walls such as Munchlax. If Clamperl is unable to sweep for whatever reason, it can still force switches and potentially set up a Substitute, which allows it to fire off powerful attacks freely.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Clamperl requires a lot of team support in order to succeed, and often one will need to build the entire team around facilitating a Clamperl sweep. Magnet Pull Magnemite is able to trap and KO Ferroseed and Pawniard, two Pokemon that greatly threaten a Clamperl sweep. Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr can Knock Off to remove items such as Eviolite and Focus Sash that could otherwise hinder a Clamperl sweep. They can also check Ferroseed and Munchlax, both of which can counter Clamperl. Chinchou and other Water-types can help Clamperl by wearing down shared checks such as Ferroseed and other bulky Grass-types. Hidden Power Fire Foongus is helpful for dealing with Ferroseed, as Foongus lures it in and takes it down to where it can be KOed by Clamperl's Ice Beam. Knock Off Abra can get rid of the items held by bulky Pokemon such as Munchlax and can also weaken Ferroseed. Memento users such as Diglett and Cottonee can be useful for weakening foes so Clamperl is able to set up easily. Cottonee can also Encore an enemy Pokemon into a weak move to allow Clamperl to set up and check Chinchou, which can be a very large threat to Clamperl. Diglett is able to trap Abra and break its Focus Sash, which is important for preventing Abra from revenge killing Clamperl. The Focus Sash Reversal set can also deal with Munchlax, which is a large threat to Clamperl. Diglett can also carry Sludge Bomb to take care of Cottonee. Entry hazard support from teammates such as Onix and Dwebble is very important, as it can help wear down foes so Clamperl can KO them. Pursuit trappers such as Pawniard, Stunky, Alolan Grimer, and Honedge are all able to support Clamperl by helping whittle the enemy team and popping Abra's Focus Sash. Stunky and Alolan Grimer both have Memento, which can help Clamperl set up, and Honedge can check Ferroseed.</p>"

  "Turtwig": {
    "overview": "<p>Turtwig brings an interesting niche to the table as the only pure Grass-type that can set Stealth Rock; this, coupled with other decent attributes such as a decent movepool, defensive stats, and typing, allows Turtwig to be an adequate entry hazard setter. Aside from a great recovery option in Synthesis, Turtwig has access to two other good moves in Bullet Seed for STAB damage against Pokemon such as Staryu and Drilbur, which also happen to be common Rapid Spin users, and Superpower for coverage against Pokemon such as Magnemite and Pawniard. However, while it has a good matchup against most spinners, Turtwig falls short to other common metagame threats such as Ponyta and Vullaby. Turtwig is outclassed by Ferroseed as a Grass-type entry hazard setter and by Onix as a Stealth Rock setter due to their more useful abilities and better stats. Turtwig is also relatively passive due to its limited offensive options, moderate stats, and the drawbacks of Superpower. The biggest reason why Turtwig isn't used much is because there are better Stealth Rock setters such as the aforementioned Onix, while as a Water-type check, Grass-types such as Snivy are more reliable.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic can be used to combat Pokemon that wall Turtwig such as Larvesta and defensive Vullaby and cripple generally any other Pokemon given the right situation; however, it is hard to fit without leaving Turtwig less able to fulfill its role effectively, as it would either replace Synthesis, a very reliable recovery method, or Superpower, Turtwig's only coverage move. Earth Power allows Turtwig to deal super effective damage to its Fire- and Poison-type checks on the switch while also hitting Steel-types, although Turtwig's poor Special Attack lets it down and therefore makes Superpower the superior coverage move. Leech Seed can be used, potentially in conjunction with Protect, to wear down and stall out opposing Pokemon to leave them vulnerable to Turtwig's teammates, although, as a recovery option, Synthesis is much better. Also, there isn't much space for Protect, an essential tool in Leech Seed stalling.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Pokemon such as the common Mienfoo carry Taunt, which shuts down Turtwig's chances of setting entry hazards or recovering and forces it to switch, as Mienfoo may carry coverage such as Acrobatics or use Knock Off to remove its Eviolite.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers that resist Turtwig's moves such as Nasty Plot Croagunk and Vullaby can easily use Turtwig as setup bait due to its passivity and OHKO it with their respective super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Doduo and Vullaby can take all of Turtwig's moves bar Superpower and outspeed it and KO it with a powerful STAB Brave Bird. Additionally, Flying-type setup sweepers such as Nasty Plot Vullaby can use Turtwig as setup bait, as it can do nothing to them.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Ponyta and Larvesta can outspeed Turtwig and use super effective STAB moves to KO it. Most also carry Will-O-Wisp, which can effectively cripple Turtwig and make it completely passive. It should be noted that worn-down Fire-types may fear Superpower, which can potentially 3HKO them.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Gastly and Croagunk are dangerous threats to Turtwig, as they can also resist all of Turtwig's moves and respond with a super effective STAB move that can either KO it or cripple its longevity by poisoning it. Additionally, Turtwig can be used as setup bait by Croagunk. Foongus deserves a special mention, as it is one of the most efficient checks to Turtwig, resisting all of its moves and KOing it if it doesn't switch out. Foongus is very common as well, which gives Turtwig a hard time in most battles.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Ice-types such as Amaura and Alolan Sandshrew can outspeed Turtwig and OHKO it with super effective STAB moves. However, Turtwig can OHKO these two with Superpower if it gets the chance to strike. Ice-type coverage is also threatening, since Water-types that Turtwig can usually switch into might carry Ice-type coverage moves that can deal heavy damage on the switch such as Ice Beam from Chinchou and Staryu.</p>",

      "Defensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock allows Turtwig to set entry hazards to chip away at the opposition's health, allowing Turtwig's teammates to take care of them with less difficulty. Synthesis allows Turtwig to switch in more comfortably and continue setting Stealth Rock if it has been removed. Bullet Seed is Turtwig's strongest and most reliable STAB move, as it can be quite powerful depending on how many times it hits and thanks to LC's multi-hit mechanics is a more powerful choice than Seed Bomb. This also allows it to effectively combat Focus Sash users such as Diglett and SturdyJuice users such as Onix. Superpower is Turtwig's strongest coverage option against common Steel-types such as Pawniard and Magnemite that resist its other moves. Superpower can hit these two heavily on the switch; however, the stat drops leave Turtwig vulnerable to revenge killing or being forced out afterwards.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given defensive investments in conjunction with Eviolite and a Careful nature make Turtwig as bulky as possible, which allows it to switch into resisted hits more safely. 28 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed some of its targets such as defensive Tirtouga, while 52 Attack EVs allow it to have a higher chance to OHKO Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Magnemite. Turtwig utilizes Overgrow instead of Shell Armor because gaining extra STAB damage at low health is a better option over protection against critical hits, which is rather unreliable.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Turtwig should be used as a lead or sent out early-game into Pokemon it doesn't take a lot of damage from, such as Omanyte and Onix, to force them out so it can set up Stealth Rock. The earlier Turtwig can set Stealth Rock the better, because it may be easier to avoid threats early-game, which eases entry hazard setup. Turtwig can use its good bulk to switch into resisted Water- and Electric-type moves such as Staryu's Hydro Pump and Elekid's Thunderbolt; however, it needs to be careful of coverage such as Ice Beam from most variants of the aforementioned Staryu. Turtwig can also use the forced switch when switching into Pokemon it checks to recover with Synthesis if needed; however, it should only do so if it is sure it can survive one more hit, as otherwise its low Speed stat can be taken advantage of. Turtwig should freely spam Bullet Seed on Pokemon it can defeat, but it should only use Superpower when it attempts to hit Steel-types on the switch to KO them because the subsequent lowering of its stats can create an opening for the opposition. Don't take advantage of Overgrow without thought, as instead of taking advantage of the extra damage provided, Turtwig should prioritize recovering with Synthesis in case its Stealth Rock is removed or its defensive typing is still needed; an opportunity where it can use Overgrow, however, is if it is confident that it can KO a Pokemon on the switch with Bullet Seed. Setup sweepers should be taken care of or have their plays predicted to ensure Turtwig is not taken advantage of after using Superpower. Turtwig should also be aware of Vullaby, especially its Weak Armor variants, as Turtwig's attacks are resisted and give it Speed boosts. Additionally, Vullaby can force out Turtwig rather easily and use Defog to remove its entry hazards.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Flying-types such as Doduo and Vullaby are great teammates for Turtwig, as they can deal with Foongus, one of Turtwig's best checks, and other threats such as Croagunk and Mienfoo. In return, Turtwig can switch into threatening Electric-types and Onix. Sweepers such as Scraggy and Carvanha appreciate Turtwig's ability to set Stealth Rock, as this allows them to KO the opposition with less difficulty. Poison-type checks such as Diglett and Mudbray can deal with the likes of Alolan Grimer and Gastly, which threaten Turtwig; in return, it can deal with Water-types that trouble Diglett and Mudbray. Pokemon such as Magnemite and Shell Smash Tirtouga make good partners, as they can both take care of Flying- and Ice-types with their respective STAB moves, while the former also provides Volt Switch support for Turtwig to switch in more comfortably. Fire-types such as Ponyta and Salandit pose a great problem to Turtwig; therefore, Pokemon such as Mareanie and Diglett make great partners. The former can help additionally by stacking Toxic Spikes, while the latter can also trap and KO other targets that trouble Turtwig. On the other hand, Fire-types are also good teammates, since they have great type synergy with Turtwig, appreciate it setting Stealth Rock, and can take out Foongus and other troublesome Grass-types. These Fire-types alongside Turtwig and Staryu also form a great core, as each of these Pokemon can take care of each other's checks thanks to their typing synergy, while Staryu can remove entry hazards as well without removing Turtwig's own like Defoggers would.</p>"

Furthermore, a weakness to Stealth Rock hurts Starly's already low longevity.

Sludge Bomb is a more powerful STAB move with a high poison chance. Synthesis provides more reliable recovery than Giga Drain. Hidden Power Fire hits Steel-types such as Pawniard and Ferroseed, which otherwise wall Budew.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread along with a Bold nature gives Budew decent 21 / 14 / 16 bulk, allowing it to avoid being 2HKOed by Eviolite Staryu's Ice Beam and Psychic after Stealth Rock damage, with the remaining EVs put into Special Attack to slightly increase its damage output. Eviolite is the item of choice, further bolstering Budew's bulk. Natural Cure makes Budew a good status absorber, most notably allowing it to switch into Scald with relative impunity.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Budew works best as a lead, as it has a good matchup against common leads such as Mienfoo and Onix. Set Spikes up as early as possible so they can weaken opposing Pokemon right from the get-go. Switch Budew into Rapid Spin users such as Staryu and Kabuto, as it is able to avoid being 2HKOed from the most common users of the move and 2HKO them in return with a super effective STAB Giga Drain and set up Spikes again.

The former lets it bypass abilities like Sturdy and Levitate, and the latter effectively gives a Life Orb boost to moves that have secondary effects at the cost of those effects. It has the movepool to use its excellent Attack stat, with its Rock-type STAB attacks backed up with options like Zen Headbutt, Superpower, Crunch, Fire Punch, Thunder Punch, and Earthquake. This means that Cranidos has very few safe switch-ins. Cranidos's Rock typing also lets it check Flying-types like Vullaby.</p> <p>However, Cranidos's Speed is average at best, and its low bulk makes it a glass cannon, difficult to get in safely. While its Rock typing gives it useful Fire, Normal, and Flying resistances, it also leaves it with common weaknesses in Fighting and Ground. The Fighting weakness makes it less effective as a Flying-type check, as Rufflet and Doduo both have Fighting-type coverage in Superpower and Jump Kick, respectively.

Zen Headbutt hits the Fighting-types that resist Cranidos's STAB move and is boosted by Sheer Force. It cleanly 2HKOes both Mienfoo and Timburr if running Sheer Force. Superpower hits Steel-, Dark-, and Normal-types super effectively, OHKOing Magnemite, Scraggy, Pawniard, and Munchlax. Earthquake hits the same Rock- and Steel-types that Superpower does without incurring stat penalties and can OHKO Chinchou. If running Mold Breaker, it can also OHKO Magnemite through Sturdy and 2HKO Bronzor through Levitate. Thunder Punch can be used to hit Water-types like Staryu and Slowpoke and is also boosted by Sheer Force. If running Sheer Force, it 2HKOes both of them. Pursuit can be used to catch fleeing Ghost- and Psychic-types like Abra and Gastly while also damaging Flying-types that attempt to switch out. While it still won't KO Doduo and Rufflet, it will significantly weaken them, preventing them from spamming Brave Bird.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs maximize Speed and Attack. Due to Cranidos's inherent frailty, investing many EVs into bulk is not recommended. A Jolly nature is usually best to outrun +1 15 Speed Pokemon like Timid Magnemite and Jolly Scraggy. Adamant can be used for some extra power, but the extra Speed is more advantageous most of the time. A Choice Scarf lets Cranidos outrun the entire unboosted metagame. Either of Cranidos's abilities can be used on this set. Sheer Force powers up Rock Slide, Zen Headbutt, and Thunder Punch, while Mold Breaker lets it bypass abilities like Tirtouga's Solid Rock and Magnemite's Sturdy.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Don't switch Cranidos into attacks if at all possible. Bring it in via a slow Volt Switch or U-turn or after a teammate has fainted. This set can play multiple roles; it can be a revenge killer, late-game cleaner, or wallbreaker. Be wary of Knock Off, as Cranidos will function significantly worse without its Choice Scarf. Switch out of Pokemon that use priority attacks like Timburr, Croagunk, and Corphish, as they can easily revenge kill Cranidos.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Fighting-types threaten Cranidos, bulky Fighting-resistant Pokemon are a must. Bulky Fairy-types like Snubbull and Spritzee are good teammates, as they can counter Timburr and Mienfoo that lack Poison Jab. They can both also cure Cranidos of status with Heal Bell. Poison-types are also good teammates for the former reason. Croagunk can check opposing Fighting-types and is also immune to Water-type moves thanks to Dry Skin. Wynaut can trap and remove said Fighting-types and give Cranidos free switches with Encore. As this set is walled by Mudbray and Hippopotas, Grass- and Water-types to check them make for good teammates. Staryu can hit them both with its Water-type STAB moves and remove entry hazards; Foongus can put something out of commission with Spore as well as wall most Fighting-types; Pumpkaboo-XL is immune to Fighting-type moves and resists Ground- and Water-type moves. Pancham can use slow Parting Shots to bring Cranidos in safely. It can also check Steel-types and use Z-Parting Shot to heal Cranidos. Entry hazard setters like Dwebble and Ferroseed can set up Stealth Rock and Spikes to help Cranidos get additional KOs.

Superpower has even more power, although the stat penalties often force Cranidos out. It also hits opposing Rock-types hard, OHKOing Onix after Sturdy has been broken. Crunch hits Ghost- and Psychic-types harder than anything else, 2HKOing Slowpoke and Pumpkaboo-XL. If the coverage is not needed, Substitute can be run to give Cranidos a shield from status and to let it dodge Sucker Punch. Cranidos's frailty makes it hard to set up, though.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs maximize Cranidos's Speed and Attack while boosting its Defense by one point. A Jolly nature is best, as it lets Cranidos outrun as much as possible. If Sticky Web support can be provided, an Adamant nature can be used for extra power, but 22 Attack with Sheer Force and Life Orb will usually get the job done. A Life Orb lets Cranidos hit incredibly hard. Sheer Force powers up Rock Slide, Zen Headbutt, Fire Punch, and Crunch, and removes Life Orb's recoil when using those moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should not be switched into attacks if possible. Bring it in via a slow U-turn or Volt Switch or after a KO. On standard teams, this set has the role of a wallbreaker, smashing holes in the opponent's team so that something else can clear up later on. On Sticky Web teams, this set can also be used to clean up late-game. Generally, opening with Cranidos's coverage moves is the best idea. The opponent will often switch in their bulky Fighting-type thinking they can force out Cranidos, and Zen Headbutt will usually KO it. If your opponent has no Pokemon left that resist Rock-type moves, spamming Rock Slide will usually get the job done. If you're running Substitute, use it on forced switches and against predicted Sucker Punches.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>While not vital, Sticky Web support is certainly appreciated to remedy Cranidos's average Speed. Surskit and Sewaddle have the best synergy with Cranidos, as they resist Fighting-, Ground-, and Water-type moves, while Cranidos resists Flying-type moves. As Fighting-types threaten Cranidos, bulky Fighting-resistant Pokemon are a must. Bulky Fairy-types like Snubbull and Spritzee are good teammates, as they can counter Timburr and Mienfoo that lack Poison Jab. They can both also cure Cranidos of status with Heal Bell. Poison-types are also good teammates for the former reason. Croagunk can check opposing Fighting-types and is also immune to Water-type moves thanks to Dry Skin. Wynaut can trap and remove Fighting-types and grant Cranidos free switches with Encore. As this set is walled by Mudbray and Hippopotas, Grass- and Water-types to check them make good teammates. Staryu can hit them both with its Water-type STAB moves and remove entry hazards; Foongus can put something out of commission with Spore as well as wall most Fighting-types; Pumpkaboo-XL can beat both of them with Giga Drain and spread burns with Will-O-Wisp. If Cranidos is on a Sticky Web team, bulky Ghost-types are recommended to both block Rapid Spin and act as Fighting-type switch-ins. Pumpkaboo-XL resists Water- and Ground-type moves and is immune to Fighting, while Cranidos resists Fire- and Flying-type moves. Entry hazard setters like Dwebble and Ferroseed are also appreciated, as the Stealth Rock and Spikes they can set up help Cranidos get additional KOs. Ferroseed resists the Water-type moves Cranidos is weak to, while Cranidos resists the Fire-type moves Ferroseed is weak to.</p> <h4>Other Options</h4> <p>A Rock Polish set using Life Orb or Berry Juice can be a deadly late-game sweeper, but Cranidos's low bulk and susceptibility to priority make it hard to set up and easily revenge killed. Head Smash has incredible power, but its high recoil drastically cuts into Cranidos's already limited durability. Ice Beam lets Cranidos 2HKO Mudray and Hippopotas with Sheer Force and Life Orb, but doesn't accomplish much else that its usual moves don't. A suicide lead set consisting of Stealth Rock, Endeavor, Head Smash, and Superpower can be used, but Onix is usually a superior lead because it has better Speed, better bulk, Taunt, and Explosion. Cranidos does have Mold Breaker, however, so it can OHKO Dwebble and Onix through Sturdy. Lastly, Cranidos can use an Eviolite, but even then it's still not especially bulky and the Speed of a Choice Scarf or the power of a Life Orb is more beneficial.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong> Mudbray and Hippopotas can take anything Cranidos has and OHKO with Earthquake. Onix and Diglett using Focus Sash can avoid an OHKO if they have full health, outrun, and OHKO with Earthquake, although Onix is OHKOed by Superpower if Cranidos is running Mold Breaker. While Drilbur can't switch in, it can still outrun and OHKO Cranidos with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong> Mienfoo outruns Cranidos and OHKOes with High Jump Kick, but a Sheer Force-boosted Zen Headbutt will OHKO if Cranidos is running Life Orb. Timburr can survive the Choice Scarf set's Zen Headbutt and OHKO with Drain Punch, and if Cranidos has taken some prior damage, it can take it down with Mach Punch.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong> Slowpoke can avoid a 2HKO from a Life Orb-boosted Rock Slide if no entry hazards are up and OHKO Cranidos most of the time with Scald. A Sheer Force-boosted Crunch will always 2HKO, however. Bronzor and Pumpkaboo-XL can beat the Choice Scarf set, but the Life Orb set can 2HKO both with Crunch. Mold Breaker Earthquake can also OHKO Bronzor after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong> Due to Cranidos's frailty, most priority moves can take it down with some prior damage. Timburr, Croagunk, Corphish, and Carvanha all have STAB priority moves that Cranidos is weak to in Mach Punch, Vacuum Wave, and Aqua Jet, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong> Choice Scarf Mienfoo, Chinchou, and Pawniard outrun Cranidos even in Sticky Web and OHKO with their respective super effective STAB moves, although none of them can switch in. If Cranidos is not running a Choice Scarf, practically any Pokemon with above 16 Speed that can hit Cranidos super effectively can force it out. Mienfoo, Drilbur, Staryu, Chinchou, and Onix are notable examples.</p>"

  "Shellos": {
    "overview": "<p>Shellos holds a unique niche over common bulky Water-types thanks to Sticky Hold, which allows it to permanently hold on to its Eviolite. It has a decent movepool that grants it access to Scald, Earth Power, Yawn, Clear Smog, and, most importantly, Recover. Shellos also has a solid defensive Water typing. However, said typing also means that Shellos will be vulnerable to common Electric- and Grass-types such as Chinchou, Magnemite, and Foongus. All of Shellos's base stats bar HP are relatively mediocre, meaning it has middling bulk, which allows powerful wallbreakers such as Abra, Snivy, and Rufflet to significantly weaken it, and Shellos's low offensive stats cause it to drain momentum while potentially being used as setup bait.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shellos can utilize boosting moves such as Stockpile, but due to its low Speed, it struggles to set up the majority of the time. Yawn can be used to either force a switch or put the foe to sleep, but it is highly situational and less consistent than Shellos's other utility options. Hidden Power Fire hits Ferroseed super effectively after being lured in, but it has limited use outside of that. Memento can be used to safely bring in a setup sweeper. Counter or Mirror Coat can be used to reflect any strong attacks back to its attacker. However, they require a good amount of prediction, and they aren't as valuable compared to Shellos's other options. Whirlpool can be used with Toxic and Recover to stall out almost any Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Magnemite, Chinchou, and Elekid can threaten Shellos with Electric-type STAB moves. However, they must be careful of a Shellos carrying Earth Power, though keep in mind that bulkier variants of Chinchou avoid being 2HKOed by it.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Pumpkaboo-S, Snivy, and Foongus threaten Shellos with their Grass-type STAB moves as well as with status moves such as Toxic and Will-O-Wisp. However, all of these Grass-types bar Ferroseed must be careful of getting hit with Ice Beam, while Ferroseed must be mindful of the extremely rare Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers such as Pawniard, Spritzee, and Timburr can take advantage of Shellos's passive nature to boost up. Spritzee, Shed Skin Scraggy, and Timburr don't mind Scald burns or Toxic, though they do not appreciate Clear Smog. Meanwhile, Pawniard does not have to worry about Clear Smog or Toxic due to its immunity to Poison, but it has to be careful of getting burned by Scald.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: Being burned or poisoned by Pokemon such as Pumpkaboo-S, Mareanie, and Alolan Grimer limits Shellos's longevity.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users such as Cottonee and Mienfoo can prevent Shellos from spreading Toxic or using Recover. This allows Pokemon that Shellos has trouble beating without Toxic, such as Slowpoke and Frillish, to switch in with ease, and having no access to Recover makes Shellos much easier to wear down.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Due to Shellos's average bulk, wallbreakers such as Life Orb Abra, Bunnelby, and Rufflet can use their strong moves to 2HKO Shellos.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is a useful Water-type STAB move that also has a 30% chance to burn, which discourages physical attackers such as Pawniard, Alolan Grimer, and Snubbull from switching in. Recover is essential, since it provides Shellos with a form of reliable recovery. Earth Power can be used to damage Electric-types that would otherwise beat Shellos such as Magnemite and Chinchou. Ice Beam is another coverage option that allow Shellos to deal with Grass-types such as Foongus, Pumpkaboo-S, and Snivy. Clear Smog prevents setup sweepers such as Vullaby and Timburr from using Shellos as setup fodder while also hitting Cottonee harder than Ice Beam. Lastly, Toxic provides Shellos with a way to deal with bulkier Pokemon such as Vullaby, Pumpkaboo-S, and Slowpoke. However, remember that due to the HP mechanics in Little Cup, it often takes a while for Toxic damage to accumulate.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread helps maximize Shellos's bulk, allowing it to reach a respectable benchmark of 27 HP and 21 in both Defense and Special Defense. In conjunction with Eviolite, Shellos will be able to effectively take hits from Pokemon such as Mudbray, Ponyta, and non-Thunderbolt Staryu. 4 Speed EVs are added to bring Shellos to a benchmark of 10 Speed, allowing it to outspeed Ferroseed, Foongus, and Munchlax while Speed tying with Timburr. Sticky Hold is the ability of choice, since it prevents Shellos's Eviolite from being removed by moves like Knock Off and Trick.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Shellos should be used as a defensive pivot due to its great defensive typing, Eviolite, and decent natural bulk. Switch Shellos in on an anticipated Knock Off from Pokemon such as Mienfoo and Pawniard. Thanks to its bulk, Shellos can also be switched into weak neutral and resisted attacks from Pokemon such as Ponyta, Hippopotas, and Kabuto. Scald is often Shellos's move of choice, since it can cripple many Pokemon, especially physical attackers, with a burn. Keep in mind that using Toxic or Recover may be better at certain times, such as when you anticipate your opponent switching into a bulkier Pokemon such as Slowpoke or Spritzee. Shellos must be kept healthy if it is used to check a specific Pokemon such as Ponyta or Drilbur. Due to Shellos's low Speed, it must be able to take one or two hits before being able to recover. Shellos is easily crippled by status conditions, so you should be careful of switching Shellos into status-inducing moves such as Scald from Water-types like Mareanie, Tirtouga, and Frillish as well as Poison Touch Knock Off from Alolan Grimer.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to Shellos's passive and defensive nature, it should be used on defensive or balanced teams. Grass-types such as Foongus, Ferroseed, and Cottonee appreciate having a check to Fire-types such as Ponyta. Foongus and Ferroseed can also check opposing Grass- and Electric-types that threaten Shellos such as Chinchou and Cottonee. Ground-types like Diglett and Mudbray can help check Electric-types such as Magnemite and Elekid. The aforementioned Fire-types as well as Steel-types such as Magnemite and Pawniard appreciate Shellos checking Ground-types such as Mudbray and Drilbur. In return, they can help check Grass-types that threaten Shellos. Pokemon that rely on their items like Spritzee, Onix, and Magnemite appreciate Shellos's ability to take a Knock Off, Thief, or Trick thanks to Sticky Hold. Shellos appreciates Heal Bell or Aromatherapy support from Pokemon such as Spritzee, Snubbull, and Chinchou, as they can remove any status conditions on Shellos.</p>"

  "Buneary": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite its stiff competition as an offensive Normal-type from Zigzagoon and Bunnelby, Buneary carves itself a unique niche in the LC metagame in its access to Healing Wish and Z-Splash. When using Splash with a Normalium-Z, Buneary is able to gain a +3 boost in its Attack and make great use of its ability to hit 19 Speed to sweep. Furthermore, Buneary has ideal coverage options in Drain Punch, Jump Kick, and the elemental punches to complement its powerful STAB Return, as well as having two unique abilities in Limber and Klutz and an expansive utility movepool consisting of gems in Healing Wish, Thunder Wave, and Heal Bell, providing it with quite a bit of versatility. Unfortunately, Buneary is unable to hold an Eviolite when attempting to sweep and is thus extremely frail and susceptible to priority, especially considering its lack of resistances and weakness to the ever-present Fighting-types like Mienfoo and Timburr. Furthermore, Buneary faces stiff competition from Zigzagoon due to the latter's access to Extreme Speed, is walled by Ghost-type Pokemon if it's running Quick Attack due to its lack of a move to hit them super effectively, and struggles to find setup opportunities due to its frailty. As a result, Buneary requires a lot of support to effectively sweep or support its team. Nevertheless, Buneary packs quite the punch as a Pokemon capable of either supporting its team with Healing Wish or sweeping late-game and definitely deserves consideration as your team's offensive Normal-type.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fake Out is a decent utility option, though this often isn't preferred over Quick Attack due to its one-time use and the existence of better Fake Out users in Meowth and Mienfoo. Buneary has access to decent coverage options in Ice Punch, Thunder Punch, Circle Throw, and Iron Tail. However, none of these are usually as valuable as Fire Punch and Drain Punch due to Buneary's near perfect coverage with the latter options. Buneary can make use of its good Speed to get off a fast Encore and halt setup sweepers and walls, though this usually isn't as valuable as its other utility in Thunder Wave and Healing Wish. Buneary can also use Magic Coat to bounce back potential entry hazards from the likes of Onix and Dwebble, though this isn't preferred for reasons similar to Encore. Power-Up Punch and Work Up are decent options when trying to attempt a sweep, though this requires several stat boosts to become powerful, unlike Z-Splash. Choice Scarf is an option to help Buneary outspeed all common Choice Scarf users and +1 Corphish, though this takes away from its offensive prowess. Buneary has a rather impressive special movepool, consisting of powerful options in Hyper Voice, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, Grass Knot, and Shadow Ball. However, it can't make great use of said movepool given its poor Special Attack. A set consisting of only Last Resort and Fake Out is a gimmicky yet powerful option. However, this is a bad idea due it to being walled by Ghost-types and lacking the coverage that's necessary for Buneary to hit Rock- and Steel-types. Buneary can also utilize its access to Sunny Day and Rain Dance to alongside its decent Speed to act as a reliable weather setter for sun and rain teams alike, though sun and rain teams aren't very viable in LC.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Timburr, Riolu, Mienfoo, and Pancham are all able to threaten Buneary with their super effective STAB attacks and discourage it from setting up.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Despite its above-average Speed stat, Buneary is still outsped and threatened common Pokemon in Elekid and Diglett, as well as by common Choice Scarf users in Mienfoo, Vullaby, and Drilbur. All of these threats are powerful enough to either severely damage Buneary or OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Due to its frailty, Buneary takes lots of damage from all relevant forms of priority. Timburr's Mach Punch, Pawniard's Sucker Punch, and Zigzagoon's Extreme Speed are all moves that Buneary has to look out for.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Unless it is running Fire Punch, Buneary is completely walled by Ghost-type Pokemon like Gastly, Pumpkaboo-XL, and Honedge and can either be KOed or inflicted with status by these threats. Frillish in particular is a fantastic counter, as it is immune to Buneary's STAB and Fighting-type attacks, has reliable recovery to avoid being whittled down, and doesn't take much damage from Fire Punch.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Despite being immune to paralysis, Buneary is crippled by burns due to the decrease in Attack power and is put on a timer by poison.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Healing Wish is useful for completely healing a teammate once Buneary is low on HP. Return is Buneary's most powerful STAB option and with maximum Attack investment is capable of 2HKOing Corphish and Eviolite Snivy. When Buneary is equipped with a Choice Band, this can even OHKO the aforementioned threats. Drain Punch both is good coverage for Normal-resistant Pokemon like Ferroseed and Omanyte and provides Buneary with valuable passive recovery, while Jump Kick can be used over Drain Punch for more power. Fire Punch is another viable option that can be used to hit Pumpkaboo-XL and other Ghost-types that would otherwise wall Buneary. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple Buneary's switch-ins, such as Gastly and Pawniard, when it is holding an Eviolite. Switcheroo allows Buneary to cripple defensive threats that may try switching in, such as Mareanie and Ferroseed, with a Choice Band, as they won't enjoy being locked into status moves. Quick Attack is useful if Buneary is holding either an Eviolite or Choice Band, as it allows it to pick off weakened foes. Buneary can also use Heal Bell when holding an Eviolite to relieve itself and its team of status, though this usually isn't as valuable as Switcheroo or Thunder Wave.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite is the preferred item, as it allows Buneary to avoid the OHKO from common and threatening attacks in Snivy's Leaf Storm and Gastly's Hidden Power Fighting. Choice Band can be used over Eviolite to give Buneary impressive wallbreaking capabilities alongside its good Speed. Buneary can opt to run its Klutz ability when holding Choice Band to be able to switch moves, though this usually isn't preferred due to the loss of power. Thunder Wave should almost always be used when Buneary is running Eviolite, whereas Switcheroo is a better option for Choice Band. However, Quick Attack is a plausible option on Eviolite as well due to the useful priority it provides Buneary with. Limber is the preferred ability, as it prevents Buneary from being paralyzed, while maximum Attack and Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Buneary to hit 19 Speed, letting it outpace prevalent threats in Gastly and Doduo, while hitting as hard as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Healing Wish is best used once Buneary's been weakened, as its Speed tier usually allows it to quickly use the move before losing to the foe and heal one of its teammates. When Buneary is healthy, it is best to either attack or use Thunder Wave so it doesn't waste all of its HP just to heal a teammate. If Buneary is running Thunder Wave, it should be used when predicting a switch to a Ghost-type or a Pokemon that doesn't take much from either Return or Buneary's coverage, as this will cripple the switch-in and allow Buneary to switch out into a teammate that beats the foe. Switcheroo should only be used against a defensive Pokemon or special attacker or when predicting a switch to one of these, as neither will benefit from being locked into a move whereas physical attackers will be able to take advantage of the power boost. If Buneary is against a faster threat, such as Elekid, as well as Focus Sash Diglett, but will be able to survive their attack, it should use Healing Wish to grant one teammate full recovery and guarantee that it isn't wasting the moveslot.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulkier offensive Pokemon without recovery, such as Tirtouga, Snubbull, and Alolan Grimer appreciate Buneary's Healing Wish, as they are able to continually check what they need to when given recovery and in Tirtouga's case can find easier setup opportunities. Because this set is extremely vulnerable to Ghost-types, Buneary appreciates Pokemon that are able to take them on, such as Houndour, Scraggy, and Carvanha. Pursuit trappers, such as Alolan Grimer and Pawniard, are particularly helpful, as they will usually guarantee that Ghost-type foes are KOed or severely weakened. Fighting-type checks, such as Spritzee, Cottonee, and Mudbray, are also appreciated by Buneary, and entry hazard support from the likes of Dwebble and Ferroseed weakens foes and gives Buneary an easier time breaking through teams. Pokemon like Focus Sash Diglett and Snubbull that can take care of common priority users in Timburr, Pawniard and Zigzagoon are big helps to Buneary considering its vulnerability to most of the tier's priority. Lastly, extremely offensive teams appreciate this set due to the archetype's general lack of recovery and struggle against Pokemon with Choice Scarf.</p>"
      },
      "Z-Splash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Splash with a Normalium Z grants Buneary access to Z-Splash, which gives it a drastic +3 Attack boost and allows it to reliably break defensive and offensive teams alike. Return is Buneary's most powerful STAB option and when hitting off of boosted Attack is capable of breaking through some of the tier's bulkiest threats with some prior damage, such as Mareanie and Mudbray. Drain Punch provides Buneary with good coverage for Steel- and Rock-types, such as Onix and Pawniard, and gives Buneary some recovery, though Jump Kick can be used over Drain Punch if you aren't using Fire Punch, as this allows it to OHKO Ferroseed, though the accuracy and crash damage is unappealing. Fire Punch is useful for hitting Ghost-types such as Pumpkaboo and Gastly hard enough to OHKO, which otherwise wall Buneary. Alternatively, Quick Attack is useful for picking off weakened threats or damaging Pokemon that are faster than Buneary before it is revenge killed. It should be noted that when running Quick Attack, Buneary is completely walled by Ghost-types due to its lack of a move to hit them for any damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Attack is important for giving Buneary as much offensive prowess as possible, and a Jolly nature with maximum Speed investment allows Buneary to hit 19 Speed, which is very useful for outspeeding a healthy portion of the metagame, including common threats in Mienfoo, Doduo, and Gastly. Buneary's remaining EVs are invested in Defense to allow it to reach 11 Defense. Normalium Z is mandatory, as it grants Buneary access to its only setup option in Z-Splash, while Limber is the preferred ability, as it prevents Buneary from being paralyzed, which could otherwise compromise its sweeping capabilities by halving its Speed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is best used as a late-game cleaner, as it is very capable of picking off weakened threats and sweeping the remains of an opponent's team after setting up. However, due to its frailty, Buneary shouldn't be switching into any attacks unless they're Ghost-type, which is why it is best brought in after one of its teammates has fainted or via slow pivot support from bulky Vullaby or Mienfoo. If Buneary is in danger of fainting but hasn't yet used Z-Splash, it can opt to use Breakneck Blitz instead to deliver one final blow to its foe and either KO them or weaken them for one of Buneary's teammates. Buneary's susceptibility to strong priority attacks often means that Pokemon like Timburr and Croagunk should be removed before Buneary attempts its sweep, while its vulnerability to all forms of status bar paralysis means that it should always be aware of these things on the opponent's team. Burns will halve its Attack stat and make it harder to break bulkier threats, and sleep will completely immobilize Buneary and halt its sweep. Common phazers in Hippopotas and Mareanie are also best removed before Buneary attempts to sweep, as Buneary can only set up once and will be rather useless if its stat boosts have been removed. Lastly, setting up with Z-Splash can be a monumental task due to Buneary's frailty. Common defensive Pokemon in Ferroseed and Munchlax make for good Pokemon to set up on as a result of this.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Buneary appreciates Pokemon that are able to either switch into or take care of the Fighting-types of the tier that it hates dealing with. Abra, Snubbull, Spritzee, Mareanie, and Slowpoke are all great teammates for Buneary due to either being able to KO or switch into the tier's common Fighting-types, such as Timburr, Scraggy, and Mienfoo. Pokemon that can use Volt Switch or U-turn to safely bring Buneary into the battlefield are also very appreciated due to Buneary's poor bulk. These Pokemon include Mienfoo, Chinchou, Magnemite, and Larvesta. If Buneary wishes to run Quick Attack, reliable answers to Ghost-type Pokemon, such as Scraggy and Alolan Grimer, can help take care of common Pokemon of the type in Pumpkaboo and Gastly, though they should eliminate these threats before Buneary comes onto the battlefield to prevent a wasted Normalium Z. Memento support from the likes of Cottonee, Alolan Grimer and Diglett is quite nice, as Memento will usually provide Buneary with an easy opportunity to set up. Entry hazard support from the likes of Dwebble and Onix is also appreciated, as it allows Buneary to break past bulkier threats in boosted Mudbray and Spritzee to more success. Sticky Web support from the likes or Surskit and Spinarak can help Buneary to outspeed faster threats in Diglett and Elekid as well as Choice Scarf users that attempt to revenge kill it, and common wielders of the move Knock Off in Pawniard and Timburr are able to remove items from defensive Pokemon like Spritzee and Slowpoke and make them easier for Buneary for break through.</p>"

This makes it a much less appealing option over stronger Normal-type wallbreakers.</p>"}},

  "Stunky": {
    "overview": "<p>With access to Pursuit and Sucker Punch, Stunky is able to trap and remove strong special attackers like Gastly and Abra very easily. Stunky also is able to carve its own niche as a Pursuit trapper that can remove hazards from the field. Its very nice defensive typing grants it an immunity to Psychic-type moves and a weakness to only Ground. However, this one weakness leaves Stunky vulnerable to Pokemon like Diglett, Mudbray, and Drilbur, which are very common. Unfortunately for Stunky, its abilities are mediocre at best; Stench doesn't really help Stunky do its job at all, and Aftermath is rarely useful. Stunky also struggles offensively because it lacks physical coverage options, and it typically has a hard time doing anything aside from Pursuit trapping and removing hazards. Stunky's complete lack of recovery leaves it prone to being worn down over the course of the battle. Alolan Grimer is almost always a better Pursuit trapper due to its better bulk and access to Knock Off.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stunky can run a full Pursuit trapping set with two coverage moves or two utility moves, but this is outclassed by Alolan Grimer, which has better bulk and better moves. Stunky can also run a dedicated entry hazard removal set, but this is fairly weak because Stunky has little offensive presence aside from its Pursuit trapping ability. Stunky can also run sets that only have 4 attacks, but this is typically a waste of Stunky's abilities and you'd be better off using a different Pokemon instead. Stunky is able to use Taunt instead of a coverage move or Memento, but it likes having the coverage. If you do run Taunt, make sure to invest more EVs in Speed so Stunky will be faster than most opposing Pokemon. Explosion is an option to run as Stunky's fourth move to hit the Pokemon that switches in after Stunky traps something, but it typically does not do much damage to bulky Pokemon, so a coverage move is better. Stunky can also use Haze to prevent setup sweepers from setting up on it. Darkinium Z is an option if you want to use either Z-Memento or Black Hole Eclipse, but this isn't recommended because Stunky prefers to have the bulk that Eviolite gives it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Magnemite and Pawniard are threats to watch out for, as they are able to hit Stunky relatively hard. Even if Stunky runs Fire Blast, most Steel-types are fairly bulky and will not take large amounts of damage from Stunky.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types deal super effective damage against Stunky. Stunky's mediocre attacking stats make it so they can easily switch in and KO Stunky. Mudbray and Drilbur can tank two hits from Stunky and KO it with Earthquake, while Diglett will need to predict the move Stunky is using correctly to successfully switch in on and KO it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon with Recovery</strong>: Since Stunky is not a very powerful attacker, Pokemon like Munchlax, Slowpoke, Mareanie, and Rufflet can wear it down while recovering off the damage they take.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stunky's Sucker Punch is one of the most powerful priority moves available in LC. Play Rough provides coverage against the common Fighting- and Dark-types that resist Sucker Punch, including Mienfoo and Vullaby. Fire Blast hits Steel-types like Ferroseed and Pawniard, which both take little from Sucker Punch and Play Rough. It also targets Pumpkaboo and Foongus, which are more likely to use a status move on Stunky than attack it, preventing the use of Sucker Punch. Hidden Power Grass is primarily for Onix and Tirtouga, both of which take a pittance from the rest of Stunky's moveset. If your team has a good answer to Onix and Tirtouga, you can run Sludge Bomb to hit Spritzee and Snubbull, which both otherwise handle this Stunky set easily. Sludge Bomb also hits Snivy harder than Fire Blast, thanks to the STAB boost.</p> <p>Pursuit can be run in the fourth slot to catch Abra and Gastly fleeing from a potential Sucker Punch, but other Pursuit users such as Choice Scarf Pawniard and Alolan Grimer have an easier time switching into both Abra and Gastly, and Stunky typically prefers to have its other coverage moves instead of Pursuit.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment allows Stunky to outrun fast Mienfoo and Onix, a must for this set. Hasty is preferable to Naive because Stunky resists STAB attacks from some of the most common special attackers in LC, such as Abra, Gastly, and Snivy. Maximum Attack investment, coupled with the boost from Life Orb, guarantees an OHKO on Diglett with Sucker Punch after Stealth Rock damage. It also allows Stunky to OHKO most Berry Juice variants of Vullaby with Play Rough and provides a good chance to OHKO standard Mienfoo and Timburr after their Eviolites have been removed.</p> <p>To run Hidden Power Grass with the optimal EV spread, Stunky needs 30 IVs in Defense and Special Attack. This lets Stunky have maximum Attack and leaves enough EVs to give an extra point in HP. Aftermath is the most consistent ability that Stunky has and can often confirm a KO on Pokemon like Mienfoo if Stunky's attacks do not OHKO outright. Stench can be run for the 10% flinch chance, but it is not recommended.</p> <p>A special variant of this set is tempting because Stunky's strongest Poison-type STAB attack is Sludge Bomb, and it has great coverage options between Dark Pulse, Fire Blast, and Hidden Power Grass. However, losing Sucker Punch leaves Stunky vulnerable to Diglett, and losing Play Rough leaves Stunky without coverage on two of the most common Pokemon in LC, Mienfoo and Vullaby.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Life Orb Stunky is a hard Pokemon to switch into and is particularly good at cleaning up a weakened team, so the set is best played later in the game after the opponent's team has been chipped. While it has good coverage overall, Stunky is not a wallbreaker, and it does not beat defensive teams without support from its teammates. Knock Off support is critical to Stunky's success, especially against Pokemon that are not weak to Sucker Punch or Play Rough, such as Foongus. Stunky cannot break through Mudbray or Mareanie, even with Knock Off support—these Pokemon should be trapped or weakened beyond recovery.</p> <p>Be mindful of faster Pokemon that use Substitute against Stunky. Diglett and Life Orb Abra can both dodge Sucker Punch with Substitute, then OHKO Stunky in return with Earthquake and Hidden Power Ground, respectively. This Stunky set is also not particularly bulky and should not switch directly into attacks whenever possible.</p> <p>Life Orb Stunky is typically best off not trying to predict what the opponent will switch to. Instead, Stunky should usually just attack whatever is in front of it with the best move available. This set's coverage allows it to KO most common Pokemon with some chip damage, so Stunky benefits from your opponent switching into its coverage moves. The exception to the above is when the opponent has a Pokemon that can tank one of Stunky's attacks and outspeed Stunky, such as Weak Armor Onix or Choice Scarf Magnemite. An opponent can potentially switch Weak Armor Onix into a predicted Play Rough and get a Weak Armor speed boost, becoming faster than Stunky and threatening to KO it. Sucker Punch also does no damage on a switch, so be mindful of that when using it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Even with a Life Orb, Stunky is not strong enough to break through more defensive Pokemon without Knock Off support from the likes of Mienfoo and Pawniard. The latter can also set Stealth Rock for Stunky, which is important to secure several KOs against Pokemon like Diglett and Vullaby. Mudbray is one of the few universal answers to this set, so a teammate that can switch in and handle it reliably is appreciated. Snivy does a great job of this and also can provide Knock Off support, allowing Stunky to break through Foongus and Pawniard, common Snivy switch-ins.</p> <p>Bulky Staryu and Ferroseed can comfortably switch into Onix, which is a pain for Stunky if Stunky lacks Hidden Power Grass or if Onix has gotten a Weak Armor boost from switching in on a Play Rough. They also both can handle Mareanie and non-Fire Blast Slowpoke reasonably well. Stunky benefits from the chip damage and safe switch-ins that slow pivots, such as Mienfoo and Vullaby, provide. Diglett can trap a handful of troublesome checks to Stunky, such as Mareanie and Ponyta.</p>"

      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Pursuit deals heavy damage to a foe that switches out, and it allows Stunky to trap Abra, Gastly, and weakened Pokemon. Sucker Punch allows Stunky to hit and generally KO the opposing threat before it can attack Stunky. Defog is useful because it lets Stunky remove entry hazards, and it is the main reason to use Stunky over other Pursuit trappers like Alolan Grimer. The final slot is typically reserved for a coverage move or a support option. Sludge Bomb gains a STAB bonus and lets Stunky hit Fairy- and Grass-types. It is able to 2HKO Snivy, preventing it from setting up on Stunky, and it OHKOes Cottonee. Fire Blast lets Stunky hit Steel-types like Pawniard and Ferroseed that can otherwise wall Stunky, since they resist or are immune to Stunky's other moves. Fire Blast 2HKOes Pawniard after Stealth Rock damage and Ferroseed regardless of Stealth Rock damage. Stunky can also use Memento after it is weakened so that one of its teammates is given an opportunity to set up and possibly sweep the opposing team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment is used so Stunky can hit hard. Aftermath can damage physical attackers like Pawniard and Mienfoo if they KO Stunky. Stunky is equipped with an Eviolite so it can have as much bulk as possible to take less damage from attacks. The majority of the remaining EVs go into Special Defense alongside a Careful nature to help Stunky tank attacks from Abra and Gastly. With this, Stunky has enough Special Defense to avoid being 2HKOed by Abra's Dazzling Gleam. 4 EVs are invested in Speed so that Stunky can outspeed all Pokemon with 13 Speed. The remaining EVs are put into Defense so that Stunky gets an extra point from Eviolite and so it can take more priority hits like Corphish's Aqua Jet and Timburr's Mach Punch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Stunky is able to compress several roles into one Pokemon. You should use Stunky to Pursuit trap Pokemon like Abra and Gastly and to remove entry hazards from the field. If needed, you can switch Stunky into either Abra or Gastly, but if you do so, it is likely that Stunky will be too weakened to do very much after eliminating the opposing Pokemon. You should avoid switching Stunky into Pokemon that it does not wall like Mienfoo, Vullaby, and Staryu because it has no recovery and does not like taking continuous chip damage. Generally, it's recommended to try bringing in Stunky after one of your slower Pokemon uses U-turn or Volt Switch. After one of your Pokemon has been KOed, you can also send in Stunky to Pursuit trap a weakened target.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Setup sweepers that like having strong and fast special attackers gone, like Zigzagoon, Omanyte, and Vullaby, really appreciate Stunky's presence on their team. Fighting-types are also very helpful to Stunky, since they appreciate Abra and Gastly being removed while also dealing with Pawniard and other Steel-types, which Stunky typically has trouble with. Grass-types like Snivy and Flying-types like Vullaby are good teammates for Stunky, since they either resist or are immune to Ground. Fairy-types like Spritzee and Snubbull also help Stunky out by putting offensive pressure on opposing Fighting-type Pokemon, which take very little damage from Stunky's attacks. Sturdy users like Magnemite and Dwebble appreciate Stunky's ability to remove entry hazards and would also be good teammates. Any other Pokemon that benefit from Stunky's entry hazard removal, like Vullaby and Diglett, are good additions to Stunky's team. Stunky's ability to use Memento makes it a great partner for setup sweepers like Zigzagoon and Tirtouga.</p>"

  "Bronzor": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to huge defensive stats complemented by a good defensive typing and a great ability in Levitate, Bronzor is a decent defensive Stealth Rock setter. With reliable recovery in Berry Juice + Recycle, it is usually able to set it up multiple times over the course of a match. Levitate is an awesome ability for Bronzor, as it removes its weakness to Ground-type moves and means it can't be trapped by Diglett. Its typing also allows it to check hail teams, certain Abra sets, Shellder, and Rufflet. However, Bronzor suffers from a huge weakness to Knock Off, which not only does tremendous damage to it, but also removes its only means of recovery in Berry Juice. This weakness means it can't check Fighting-types as well as it otherwise could, since they usually carry the move. Bronzor also has low offensive stats, meaning it can often be setup bait and is unable to threaten the Pokemon it checks. Lastly, it has a bad matchup against common spinners like Staryu and Drilbur as well as a common Defogger in Vullaby, meaning it has a hard time keeping Stealth Rock up.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Eviolite is an option to maximize Bronzor's bulk, but a set like that has no recovery and thus is more prone to being whittled down and has a harder time setting up Stealth Rock multiple times, therefore requiring Wish support from a teammate to stay healthy. Toxic can cripple bulky switch-ins that Bronzor otherwise can't hurt, though both Mudbray and Munchlax can Rest, and Spritzee is hit harder by Heavy Slam. Hypnosis has a chance to incapacitate a Pokemon temporarily, but it is unreliable and Bronzor has a hard time finding space for it. Flash Cannon can be used over Heavy Slam to hit Onix harder, though it misses out on the 2HKO on Spritzee after Stealth Rock and is as such usually inferior. Psych Up is another option to counteract setup sweepers, but Bronzor is not able to utilize offensive boosts very effectively. A dual screens set can be run, but without Berry Juice as recovery, Bronzor is unable to set up screens multiple times, and without Light Clay, the screens don't last very long. A Calm Mind set is also an option, but it is hindered by Bronzor's low Speed and weakness to Knock Off, as well as its low offensive stats, meaning Bronzor will need multiple boosts to deal significant damage. Finally, Bronzor's high bulk can be used to set up rain or Trick Room.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off deals tremendous damage to Bronzor and removes its means of recovery in Berry Juice. Notably, Pawniard resists all of Bronzor's moves, while Vullaby gets a Speed boost from Heavy Slam and is able to set up on Bronzor.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Due to Bronzor's passive nature, setup sweepers can easily get one or two boosts while it is in play.</p> <p><strong>Drilbur</strong>: Drilbur can remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin and hit Bronzor with a super effective Earthquake thanks to Mold Breaker.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: If Bronzor gets Taunted, it is unable to recover with Recycle or set up Stealth Rock. Notably, Mienfoo will force Bronzor to switch out with Knock Off, while Onix can easily set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Users</strong>: Pursuit users like Stunky, Pawniard, and Alolan Grimer can weaken Bronzor tremendously or potentially remove it for the rest of the match. In addition, Stunky can Defog Bronzor's Stealth Rock away, while Pawniard and Alolan Grimer can Knock Off its Berry Juice.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Ponyta and Houndour can do very significant damage to Bronzor while resisting Heavy Slam. However, they do have to be careful of Earthquake.</p>",

      "Stealth Rock Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock wears down foes over time, and Bronzor is great at setting it up multiple times over the course of a match. Recycle allows Bronzor to regain its Berry Juice after it's used, giving it reliable recovery. Psychic is Bronzor's main STAB move, dealing super effective damage to Fighting-types that could otherwise easily beat it, like Mienfoo and Timburr. Heavy Slam is a secondary STAB move that 2HKOes Spritzee after Stealth Rock and Snubbull from full HP. It also OHKOes Alolan Vulpix and deals heavy damage to Rock- and other Ice-types, such as Archen and Snover, both of which Bronzor can check. Earthquake is an alternative option that hits Chinchou and opposing Steel-types, which Bronzor otherwise can't hurt.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Berry Juice is Bronzor's only means of recovery and works well with Recycle, allowing it to stay healthy throughout the match. Levitate is the ability of choice, as it turns Bronzor's weakness to Ground into an immunity and allows it to switch out against Diglett. The given EV spread with a Relaxed nature allows Bronzor to reliably check physical attackers such as Rufflet or Bunnelby. The rest of the EVs make up for Bronzor's lack of Eviolite by giving it as much special bulk as possible. The Attack, Special Attack, and Speed EVs boost their respective stats by one point each. A Relaxed nature is used, since Speed is Bronzor's least important stat.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bronzor should be switched in on Pokemon that can't hurt it such as Abra, Rufflet, and Mudbray to set up Stealth Rock. It can easily do this multiple times throughout a match as long as its Berry Juice does not get removed. Even though Bronzor can check Fighting-types, be careful of Knock Off, as many of them carry it and it will significantly cripple Bronzor. Recycle should only be used if Berry Juice will immediately activate after using it, as you otherwise risk Berry Juice being removed by Knock Off.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Knock Off absorbers are mandatory, as Bronzor is very scared of the move. Trubbish is a good example of this, as its ability Sticky Hold allows it to switch into Knock Off, and it is also able to set up Toxic Spikes and Spikes, which synergize well with Bronzor's Stealth Rock, while Bronzor in return can switch into Ground- and Psychic-types. Spinblockers are also good teammates, as they help keep Stealth Rock on the field. However, many of them share a Knock Off weakness with Bronzor, so be careful of stacking this weakness. Due to Bronzor's passive nature, opposing Pokemon will often set up on it; as such, support from a phazer is appreciated. Munchlax is especially notable, as it can not only phaze an opposing Pokemon that has set up, but also absorb Fire-type moves for Bronzor thanks to Thick Fat. Lastly, a Fairy- or Fighting-type like Spritzee or Mienfoo synergizes well with Bronzor, as it is able to switch into Dark-types that threaten Bronzor with Pursuit and Knock Off, while Bronzor is in return can check Poison- and Steel-types for Fairy-type teammates, as well as Psychic-, Flying-, and Fairy-types for Fighting-type teammates.</p>"

  "Gible": {
    "overview": "<p>Gible fits on offensive teams that appreciate its ability to use offensive pressure to set up Stealth Rock without losing momentum. This is due to its incredible offensive typing, which gives it perfect neutral coverage with just its STAB moves and one coverage move, Fire Blast. Dragon / Ground also is a unique defensive typing, as it lets Gible resist Fire, be immune to Electric, and be hit neutrally by Grass, allowing it to check a decent range of Pokemon like Ponyta, Larvesta, and Elekid. Its ability Rough Skin punishes physical attackers that use contact moves to attack it, though Little Cup's low HP stats mean that Rough Skin does little damage. However, Gible is quite slow, so it struggles to set up Stealth Rock against a lot of foes. In addition, Fairy-types such as Spritzee and Snubbull, which Gible struggles to break through, are very common, while its weakness to Ice means that it can easily be taken down with common coverage moves such as Ice Beam on Staryu or Chinchou. It lacks reliable recovery, so it is unable to set up Stealth Rock multiple times throughout the game, especially when combined with its average bulk. Gible also faces competition from other Ground-types such as Mudbray and Drilbur, both of which are stronger while Drilbur is also faster; other Dragon-types such as Axew and Tyrunt, which have access to Dragon Dance, though Gible has a niche in its excellent neutral coverage; and other Stealth Rock setters like Ferroseed and Onix, which can set Stealth Rock up more reliably thanks to their greater bulk or better ability.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gible has a higher Attack than Special Attack, so a physical variant can be used, though such a set will be unable to utilize the incredible coverage of Fire Blast without either making Gible very weak or lowering one of its defenses or its Speed. It's also unable to check Fire-types very well due to the fear of Will-O-Wisp and lacks the power of Draco Meteor unless Gible runs the risky Outrage. Such a set should usually run Dragon Claw, Earthquake, and either Iron Tail or Stone Edge. Gible can run a Life Orb set, which utilizes its incredible neutral coverage with its STAB moves as well as good other coverage options like Fire Blast and Iron Tail to function as a wallbreaker, but it is unable to do anything against the more offensively inclined teams of Little Cup and thus outclassed by other wallbreakers, including Dratini and Pawniard. A set that utilizes Hone Claws in combination with Earthquake, Dragon Rush, and Stone Edge or Iron Tail can be a decent late-game sweeper for Sticky Web teams, but Gible is too slow to utilize such a set without Sticky Web, and it is outclassed by other cleaners, such as Shell Smash users. A Choice Scarf set can be used, but Gible's uninvested bulk is very low, meaning it's easily revenge killed by faster Choice Scarf users and priority users. In addition, its low power means it fails to OHKO most Pokemon, making it a mediocre revenge killer at best. Roar can be used to prevent foes from setting up on Gible, especially after a Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor, but it will make Gible miss out on important coverage or Stealth Rock, so it's usually not worth it. Lastly, Toxic can be used to cripple bulky Pokemon that Gible struggles to beat, such as Spritzee and Snubbull, but due to Little Cup's low HP stats, its damage doesn't ramp up very quickly, and Gible generally prefers its neutral coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Bulky Fairy-types such as Spritzee and Snubbull can all take any of Gible's moves excluding the rare Iron Tail and hit back very hard with their super effective STAB moves. Although Cottonee has to fear Fire Blast as well, it also resists Earth Power, meaning that it is an especially good switch-in.</p> <p><strong>Bronzor</strong>: Bronzor can take any of Gible's moves and even avoids the 2HKO from Fire Blast; thus, it can easily switch into Gible and restore HP with its Berry Juice.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Any faster threats or priority users, such as Doduo and Croagunk, will be able to significantly hurt Gible due to its low bulk. Many of them are too frail to take two hits from Gible, however, meaning they can't switch in more than once.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Gible is incredibly weak to Ice-types such as Alolan Vulpix and Snover, and they can all easily OHKO it. Snover can take Gible out before it can even do anything thanks to Ice Shard. However, these Ice-types have to fear Fire Blast. Gible is also weak to common Ice-type coverage on Pokemon such as Chinchou and Staryu. Eviolite Staryu especially can use Recover to gain back most of the HP lost from Draco Meteor and use Rapid Spin to remove Gible's Stealth Rock.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock can severely weaken the opponent's team over time, and Gible's high offensive presence allows it to set up the entry hazard on switches it forces while continuing to threaten its foe afterwards. Draco Meteor is a very powerful STAB move that hits most of the metagame hard. However, since it lowers Gible's Special Attack, it will usually force Gible to switch out. Earth Power is a secondary STAB move that has great neutral coverage with Draco Meteor, notably hitting Steel-types such as Pawniard and Magnemite, which resist Draco Meteor, super effectively, OHKOing non-Eviolite variants of the former and all variants of the latter, as well as hitting Fairy-types like Snubbull neutrally, nearly always 2HKOing it after Stealth Rock if its item has been removed or consumed. Fire Blast is a great coverage move, hitting all three Pokemon that resist both of Gible's STAB moves super effectively, 2HKOing Bronzor and Cottonee while usually 2HKOing Morelull after Stealth Rock. In addition, it 2HKOes Ferroseed, which can take any of Gible's other moves with ease.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Berry Juice is used in order to make up for Gible's lack of recovery and greatly increase its longevity. Eviolite is an option over Berry Juice to allow Gible to tank hits a bit better, but it usually prefers the Berry Juice's recovery. The defensive investment and a Bold nature increase Gible's bulk by a good amount, notably allowing it to nearly always take two Drain Punches from Croagunk, one Shadow Ball from Life Orb Gastly, one Analytic-boosted Flash Cannon from Choice Scarf Magnemite, and one Hydro Pump from Life Orb Staryu. The remaining EVs are put into Speed and Special Attack to increase Gible's offensive presence. An alternative EV spread of 52 HP / 156 Def / 196 SpA / 76 SpD / 20 Spe can be used in order to hit harder, as this notably lets Gible OHKO Ferroseed and gives it a chance to OHKO Cottonee without an Eviolite with Fire Blast after Stealth Rock. However, this will make Gible struggle to take the special hits mentioned above, and since Gible outspeeds Ferroseed, it will be forced to take two Fire Blasts before going for a move itself if it switches in on Gible anyway, meaning that this spread is generally not worth it. Rough Skin is used to punish physical attackers, though the damage is fairly insignificant. A specially attacking set is used despite Gible's higher Attack because these moves have very good coverage together and this set can utilize them without sacrificing Gible's bulk, whereas a mixed set would be forced to move some defensive EVs to offensive stats to achieve certain OHKOs and 2HKOs. In addition, it allows Gible to more easily check Fire-types like Ponyta and Larvesta, which often carry Will-O-Wisp and could thus cripple a physical or mixed set.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gible should focus on using its offensive presence to force a switch and set up Stealth Rock. If Gible is still holding its Berry Juice, it can be used to take a hit from strong attackers like Timburr and fire off a powerful Draco Meteor. Gible can also be used as a suicide lead if your team really needs it to set Stealth Rock up, as its decent bulk allows it to usually do so after taking a hit. Since Gible's bulk is only decent and it lacks recovery outside of Berry Juice, it should usually only switch in on Pokemon it is able to check easily like Ponyta and Elekid—otherwise, it can easily be worn down. If Gible is used to check Chinchou, it should be scouted to make sure it doesn't carry Ice Beam, as that can easily OHKO Gible. Gible can come in on Pokemon that are reliant on recoil moves, such as Doduo and Darumaka, in order to wear them down even faster thanks to Rough Skin. It does need to be careful, however, as it can be significantly crippled if it switches in on Doduo's Knock Off, and very powerful moves like Rufflet's Brave Bird will OHKO it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fairy-types like Spritzee and Snubbull appreciate Gible threatening Poison-, Steel-, and Fire-types. Steel-types like Pawniard and Ferroseed check Ice-, Dragon-, and Fairy-types for Gible, while Gible threatens Fire-types in return. Ferroseed can also set up Spikes, which synergizes nicely with Gible's Stealth Rock, while Pawniard deters Defog, which allows Gible's Stealth Rock to stay up longer. Other Spikes setters such as Dwebble and Trubbish can also stack entry hazards with Gible and capitalize on the switches it forces. Dwebble also appreciates Gible threatening Rock-types. Powerful wallbreakers like Mienfoo and Pawniard can force a lot of switches, thus capitalizing on Gible's Stealth Rock. Setup sweepers like Shell Smash Shellder and Nasty Plot Vullaby appreciate Gible's Stealth Rock, as it allows them to break through their checks more easily. Since Gible can check Pokemon like Elekid and Magnemite quite well, Pokemon that appreciate that, such as Doduo and Vullaby, are good partners.</p>"

  "Munchlax": {
    "overview": "<p>Munchlax has a sky-high HP stat and a terrific Special Defense stat, which make it one of the best special walls in the metagame. Its ability Thick Fat allows it to better counter Ice- and Fire-type attackers, and its good Attack stat gives it the ability to hit hard and avoid becoming setup bait while performing its defensive duties. However, Munchlax performs far worse as a special tank in practice than it does on paper. Its low Defense stat means that Munchlax will often be forced out or taken out by physical attacks. The prevalence of Knock Off, including among the special attackers of the metagame, means that too often, Munchlax will lose its item and become crippled in its defensive capabilities early on. Furthermore, Munchlax lacks access to recovery outside of Rest and Berry Juice + Recycle, which leaves it prone to getting worn down throughout a match. Lastly, Munchlax's typing is not ideal for a defensive Pokemon in Little Cup, leaving it with a weakness to the common Fighting-type attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Munchlax can use Facade to take on Flame Body users, including Ponyta and Larvesta, somewhat better, especially as it resists their attacks with Thick Fat. It can also use Ice Punch to hit Archen, which otherwise completely walls it. Counter is another option, as Munchlax can survive most physical attacks and score a surprise KO in return. Lastly, Superpower is an alternate coverage option that hits some Steel-types, including Pawniard, for more damage than Earthquake or Fire Punch.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Timburr, Mienfoo, Scraggy, and Croagunk, typically hit Munchlax for physical damage, which it is most vulnerable to, and can deal massive damage with their super effective attacks. Additionally, Fighting-types in LC nearly always run Knock Off, which cripples both Munchlax sets.</p> <p><strong>Archen</strong>: Archen totally walls Munchlax and can set up Stealth Rock or use Defog against it, Knock Off the Berry Juice set to prevent Recycle, or simply KO it.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Many setup sweepers don't mind Munchlax's attacks and can use it as setup bait, especially if it is forced into using Sleep Talk by having used Rest. These Pokemon either force Munchlax out, which kills momentum, or KO it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types are immune to Munchlax's STAB attacks and often take little damage from its coverage moves. Many of these Pokemon can also burn and cripple the Recycle set.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types can handle Munchlax with varying degrees of effectiveness, depending on its moveset. Offensively, Pawniard can deal huge damage to Munchlax and cripple it with Knock Off, and most sets are not KOed by Munchlax's coverage moves. Defensively, Ferroseed can wall and set up hazards against non-Fire Punch Munchlax variants.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Recycle + Berry Juice Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is Munchlax's primary attack, as it is a powerful STAB move. Body Slam is a decently powerful alternative that comes with a high paralysis chance, which can help to cripple foes. However, anything of 16 Speed or faster will still outspeed Munchlax and paralysis can actually worsen Munchlax's chances against Guts users such as Timburr. Earthquake allows Munchlax to super effectively hit many of the Rock- and Steel-types that switch into its STAB attack of choice. Fire Punch is an alternative that hits certain Pokemon, such as Ferroseed, for more damage than Earthquake. Pursuit gives Munchlax a way to trap Gastly and Abra, which it can switch into and remove from the match. Whirlwind keeps Pokemon from using Munchlax as setup bait and can wear down opposing teams when used in conjunction with entry hazards. Recycle acts as a pseudo-recovery move, giving Munchlax a way to regenerate its Berry Juice.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Thick Fat is Munchlax's best ability, allowing it to more reliably beat Fire-types such as Ponyta and Houndour. Munchlax's EV spread is simple, maximizing its Attack to allow it to hit as hard as possible and its Special Defense to help it to take as many hits as possible while doing so. An Adamant nature further increases Munchlax's attacking potential. Berry Juice gives Munchlax a form of recovery in conjunction with Recycle.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Munchlax can be switched in easily against most special attackers and then spam its powerful attacks. Munchlax's STAB move should be used as much as possible, especially if the opponent doesn't have a Ghost-type Pokemon. Be careful to avoid taking a Knock Off, as if Munchlax's Berry Juice is removed, it can't be retrieved by Recycle. Although Munchlax can take on many physical attackers, it will generally get worn down in doing so, so don't allow Munchlax to take powerful physical attacks until the special Pokemon it needs to check have been eliminated.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Munchlax appreciates Pokemon that can take on Fighting-types, and as such it makes a good defensive core with the likes of Spritzee, Snubbull, and Mareanie. Snubbull and Spritzee can also act as clerics, removing status conditions from Munchlax, which tends to get burned by Scald or opposing Fire-types. Pokemon that can take Knock Off make good partners as well, including Mienfoo and Croagunk, the latter of which can also take on Fighting-types. Flying-type Pokemon, such as Doduo and Vullaby, appreciate Munchlax's ability to take on Electric-types such as Chinchou and Magnemite and Ice-types. Grass-type Pokemon also appreciate Munchlax's walling ability. Snivy and Foongus, for example, appreciate Munchlax's ability to take Ice- and Fire-type attacks, and the latter can take on Fighting-types for Munchlax. Entry hazard removal is important to keep Munchlax from being worn down and thus forced to use Recycle too many times, with Defog users such as Vullaby and Rapid Spin users such as Staryu working well. Hazard setters can also make good partners if Whirlwind is run, with possible teammates including Ferroseed and Dwebble. If running Pursuit, Pokemon that appreciate Gastly and Abra removed, such as Fighting-types and a Gastly of your own, make good partners.</p>"
      },
      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is a powerful STAB move that can hit especially hard after an Attack boost from Curse. Body Slam is an alternative that carries a paralysis chance. However, even after paralysis, any Pokemon of 16 Speed or faster still outspeeds Munchlax, and the paralysis can hurt Munchlax when facing Timburr. Curse is a boosting move that lets Munchlax patch up its poor Defense and boost its Attack as it recovers with Rest. Earthquake is an alternative that hits the Rock- and Steel-types that Munchlax often brings in. Whirlwind is a possibility in this slot as well, as it keeps Munchlax from being set up on and can wear down opposing teams by inflicting them with entry hazard damage. Without Earthquake in the second slot, however, Munchlax is stopped completely by most Rock-, Ghost-, and Steel-type Pokemon. Rest gives Munchlax a method of recovery that isn't stopped by Knock Off, while Sleep Talk allows Munchlax to move while asleep. Sleep Talk has the added benefit of allowing Munchlax to come in on sleep inducers, including Foongus, without fear.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Thick Fat allows Munchlax to check Fire- and Ice-type Pokemon even better, including Ponyta and Larvesta. With 236 Special Defense EVs, Munchlax maximizes its already great Special Defense. 236 Attack EVs boost Munchlax's power so that it can hit as hard as possible while taking hits. The remaining EVs go into Defense, an investment that, coupled with an Impish nature, allows Munchlax to hit Eviolite numbers. Eviolite is the item of choice on this set, as it boosts Munchlax's longevity.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Munchlax is a terrific counter to most special attackers and should be switched into them liberally. After being switched in, Munchlax can fire off its attacks or set up with Curse. This Munchlax set can also be used as a status absorber. However, be cautious when letting Munchlax take a status move or get worn down, as using Rest to restore health or cure status conditions forces Munchlax to rely on Sleep Talk to select its move for two turns, potentially becoming setup bait. Munchlax becomes much less bulky, especially physically, after being hit with Knock Off, so be cautious of special attackers that can use Knock Off such as Cottonee and Abra.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Munchlax set is walled especially well by Ghost-type Pokemon such as Gastly, so a Pursuit user such as Alolan Grimer or Pawniard makes a good partner. Defensively, Munchlax forms very good defensive cores with Pokemon that resist Fighting, including Spritzee, Snubbull, and Mareanie. Pokemon that can take Knock Off also make good partners, especially Fighting-type Pokemon such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Croagunk. Hazard removal is also important, as RestTalk Pokemon tend to get worn down quickly. Staryu and Drilbur can use Rapid Spin and appreciate Munchlax taking on Electric- and Ice-types, respectively, and Vullaby can use Defog and appreciates Munchlax taking on both. Entry hazard support should be provided if Munchlax is running Whirlwind to wear down teams more effectively, with the likes of Onix and Dwebble providing this support well.</p>"

  "Riolu": {
    "overview": "<p>Riolu's niche over Little Cup's other Fighting-types lies in its access to Copycat and Prankster. This allows Riolu to gain priority on its most recently used attack with Copycat and beat faster Pokemon that would otherwise threaten it such as Diglett, Doduo, and Gastly. Furthermore, Riolu's expansive movepool, fair bulk with Eviolite, high Attack stat, and access to Swords Dance altogether allow it to function as a fairly potent sweeper. Unfortunately, Riolu's lack of Knock Off and a more reliable STAB attack than High Jump Kick, as well as worse bulk than most other Fighting-types still leave it generally outclassed by better options in Mienfoo and Timburr. It also struggles to find setup opportunities due to its only decent bulk as well as rather unimpressive Speed, and it can at times, struggle to maintain Copycat chains due to the tier's prevalence of priority.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Copycat and Roar may at first seem like a useful combination, but it doesn't actually work and will ultimately cost Riolu a moveslot. Riolu has a rather expansive physical movepool that consists of interesting options in Ice Punch, Rock Slide, Shadow Claw, Poison Jab, and Earthquake. However, it usually isn't able to put any of these moves to as much use as the coverage listed in the main set. A more offensively-inclined Swords Dance set can be used with Life Orb and Speed investment over bulk. However, it is extremely hard for Riolu to find setup opportunities with this set due to the lack of bulk, and it is still outsped by big threats in Doduo and Gastly. Riolu can utilize its access to Nasty Plot to try functioning as a special setup sweeper, though its poor Special Attack and lack of special coverage make sweeping extremely difficult. Riolu can utilize a Double Dance set, given its access to both Agility and Swords Dance. However, it will have to sacrifice coverage to make room for both setup options as well as take powerful hits in the process of setting up. Role Play is an option for copying useful abilities in Foongus and Mienfoo's Regenerator as well as Mudbray's Stamina, but this gives up coverage and is often fairly situational. Riolu can use its access to both Rain Dance and Sunny Day alongside Prankster to function as a weather setter, but its poor bulk usually will only allow it to set up weather once before fainting. Focus Sash is an option on more offensive teams and also guarantees a boost, though Riolu is generally better off using another item if it isn't investing too heavily in defenses. Berry Juice can be used over Eviolite or Roseli Berry to provide Riolu with semi-reliable recovery, though this usually leaves it susceptible to OHKOs from attacks that Eviolite allows it to survive, such as Choice Scarf Mienfoo's High Jump Kick and Vullaby's Air Slash.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Common Ghost-types in Gastly, Frillish, and Pumpkaboo are immune to High Jump Kick, and alongside cutting Riolu's HP from crash damage, they can offensively pressure it or inflict it with status.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to Riolu's poor Speed, faster Pokemon in Abra, Choice Scarf Vullaby, and Cottonee are able to outpace and threaten to OHKO it with their super effective STAB attacks. However, these threats must be careful not to allow Riolu to use Copycat and attack them with their own moves.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types like Spritzee and Snubbull resist High Jump Kick and can severely damage Riolu with either STAB Moonblast or STAB Play Rough, though they must be wary of Iron Tail.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Mareanie, Croagunk, and Foongus are all capable of tanking High Jump Kick and either whittling Riolu down with Sludge Bomb or inflicting it with status, though they all must look out for Zen Headbutt.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Due to Riolu's rather poor Special Defense, it is heavily pressured by especially powerful special attackers in Gastly, Bulbasaur, and Magnemite, though these threats must be wary of either High Jump Kick or Zen Headbutt.</p> <p><strong>Faster Priority Users</strong>: Faster priority users such as Corphish and Doduo can disrupt Riolu's Copycat chains with their priority moves in Aqua Jet and Quick Attack, respectively.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance is important for boosting Riolu's Attack and enabling it to sweep, and the +1 priority it gets from Prankster is useful for avoiding Taunt, which is uncommon but still present nonetheless. Copycat allows Riolu to gain priority on either High Jump Kick or its coverage immediately after using the move to compensate for its poor Speed. It can also be used alongside Protect to scout a foe's attack or entry hazard and proceed to use the same move back, as well as an ally's pivoting move. High Jump Kick is Riolu's strongest STAB option and, when boosted, is capable of OHKOing Shellder, Alolan Grimer, and every relevant Vullaby set with Stealth Rock up. However, the move is slightly unreliable at times, given that Riolu will lose 50% of its maximum HP upon missing. Protect is useful for scouting powerful attacks such as Mienfoo's High Jump Kick, Diglett's Earthquake, and Doduo's Brave Bird, and using Copycat to OHKO the aforementioned Pokemon with their own attacks after a boost. Iron Tail is useful coverage for common Fairy-types in Spritzee, Cottonee, and Snubbull, and it is capable of OHKOing them when boosted with Stealth Rock up. Zen Headbutt is another coverage option that allows Riolu to hit Poison-types such as Gastly, Mareanie, and Foongus for better damage, being able to OHKO the former and 2HKO the latter two threats when boosted. Crunch is useful for 2HKOing most of the Ghost-types that are immune to High Jump Kick, such as Pumpkaboo and Frillish, and OHKOing Gastly as well after a boost. Blaze Kick is another option for hitting various threats such as Foongus and Cottonee for 2HKOs. However, these Pokemon are all hit hard by Riolu's other coverage options, so this move isn't usually as preferred. Substitute can be used over Protect to provide Riolu with a setup opportunity, though it often will need as much longevity as it can get, meaning that this isn't as preferable of an option.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack EVs and an Adamant nature allow Riolu to hit as hard as possible and reliably OHKO common defensive Pokemon in Ferroseed and Mudbray with a boosted High Jump Kick. Near maximum investment in HP and Defense with an Eviolite allow Riolu to tank powerful hits from the likes of Drilbur, Scraggy, and Ponyta. 36 EVs invested in Special Defense ensure that Riolu can survive some of the tier's most feared special attacks in Snivy's Leaf Storm and Chinchou's Hydro Pump, and 36 Speed EVs are useful for hitting 13 Speed and outpacing most defensive Pokemon. Prankster is mandatory, as it allows Riolu to receive priority on Swords Dance and Copycat. Roseli Berry can be run over Eviolite in order to tank one Fairy-type attack more reliably, though the lack of Eviolite significantly cuts Riolu's bulk, and as a result, it is generally not preferred.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to its poor longevity and frailty, it is best to preserve Riolu early-game and remove its checks so it can function as a late-game sweeper. Protect is a move that serves many uses; most importantly, it can help Riolu protect itself from some of the tier's most powerful attacks in Rufflet's Brave Bird, boosted Omanyte's Hydro Pump, and Diglett's Earthquake and proceed to use Copycat to severely dent the aforementioned threats with their own attacks. It also allows Riolu to scout out Choice Scarf users or generate momentum by scouting and copying pivoting moves. Although it can struggle to find setup opportunities, Riolu can often reliably use Swords Dance when predicting a switch. If a foe uses Stealth Rock or sets another entry hazard, Riolu can do the same with Copycat and help weaken its teammates' checks. It can also make good use of Copycat in utilizing slow pivots as partners to copy either their U-turn or Volt Switch and wear down foes. Riolu must be wary of Ghost-type switch-ins when using High Jump Kick, as it will take severe crash damage if the move fails. It should also be noted that if Riolu doesn't 2HKO a foe with High Jump Kick and the foe attacks after it, it will not be able to use Copycat to receive priority on High Jump Kick. Because of High Jump Kick's heavy recoil damage, Riolu must also be wary of common Protect users in Carvanha and Spritzee, as they will take no damage from its attack and potentially KO it after the 50% HP loss from crash damage. It is best to use Riolu once powerful Psychic-, Fairy-, and Flying-type attackers are removed, as they will all severely dent Riolu with their super effective STAB attacks regardless of its bulk investment and weaken it for their teammates to revenge kill. If Riolu isn't running Protect, it should use the coverage move of choice on predicted switches to deal sufficient damage to certain Fighting-resistant Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Despite sharing a weakness to Fairy, Dark-types such as Vullaby and Carvanha are fantastic teammates for Riolu, as they reliably take care of the Psychic- and Ghost-types that trouble it, such as Abra, Gastly, and Slowpoke. Pawniard and Alolan Grimer are especially helpful, as they aren't weak to Fairy-type attacks and can Pursuit trap and either OHKO or severely weaken Psychic- and Ghost-types that keep Riolu from spamming High Jump Kick. Answers to Fairy-type Pokemon, such as Gastly, Foongus, and Ferroseed, can either switch into the Fairy-type attacks that Riolu hates taking or threaten common Fairy-types in Spritzee and Cottonee with their super effective STAB attacks. Offensive and defensive answers to Flying-type Pokemon are both very helpful due to Riolu's weakness to the type; Magnemite, Chinchou, and Onix are all very capable of either offensively pressuring or tanking the hits of powerful Flying-types in Vullaby and Doduo. Diglett is capable of trapping and KOing Poison-type Pokemon that resist High Jump Kick such as Croagunk and Skrelp. Slow pivots such as Magnemite, Chinchou, and Mienfoo are useful teammates, as they can bring Riolu in safely and allow it to use Copycat on either Volt Switch or U-turn to wear down foes. Entry hazard support from the likes of Dwebble, Onix, and Mareanie is helpful to Riolu for an easier time securing KOs. Knock Off support from Pokemon like Cottonee, Pawniard, and Alolan Grimer is also appreciated, as Riolu will have an easier time sweeping once foes' Eviolites have been removed. Lastly, while not mandatory, Memento support from the likes of Diglett, Cottonee, and Alolan Grimer is useful for providing Riolu with an easy setup opportunity.</p>"

  "Hippopotas": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to incredible physical bulk complemented by a reliable recovery move in Slack Off, Hippopotas is capable of checking a huge variety of physical attackers in Little Cup including, but not limited to, Choice Scarf Doduo and Rufflet, Timburr, non-Life Orb Pawniard, and Archen. Because of this, it can function as a great Stealth Rock setter, capable of setting it up on many threats in the metagame. Hippopotas also has a decent Attack stat as well as access to Whirlwind, which together mean that it isn't setup bait. Its ability Sand Stream allows Hippopotas to remove hail, making it a decent check to hail teams. However, it has a low Special Defense stat that, in combination with a less-than-ideal defensive typing, can easily be taken advantage of, as it leaves Hippopotas open to common Grass- and Water-type moves. Its usual lack of a move to threaten Flying-types also means that it often can't fight back against some of the threats it walls. Hippopotas also has a bad matchup against two of the most common hazard removers, Staryu and Vullaby, meaning it is often unable to keep Stealth Rock set.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Smooth Rock is an option to give teammates such as Drilbur and Alolan Diglett more turns of sand and thus a better chance to sweep, but it will make Hippopotas miss out on the huge bulk boost from Eviolite. Toxic can be used over Whirlwind, as it allows Hippopotas to potentially stall out its foe; however, this will leave Hippopotas prone to being set up bait. Sand Force is an option over Sand Stream if the chip damage and reduced recovery from moves like Synthesis and Morning Sun are detrimental to Hippopotas's teammates. Since Hippopotas has a wide physical movepool, including Rock Slide, Fire Fang, Ice Fang, Thunder Fang, Superpower, and Crunch, a more offensive set can be used, but Hippopotas is too slow to properly utilize such a strategy. Lastly, a Curse set with Slack Off, Earthquake, and Rock Slide can be used, but Curse only boosts Hippopotas's Defense and not its weaker Special Defense, leaving it very vulnerable to special attacks and typically unable to accumulate enough boosts to sweep an opponent's team.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Hippopotas has a very low Special Defense stat, meaning powerful special attackers such as Abra, Snivy, and Chinchou can easily 2HKO or even OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Snivy, Cottonee, or Foongus can all take Hippopotas's Earthquake with ease and proceed to force it out with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types can threaten Hippopotas and force it to switch out with their, often special, super effective STAB moves. Staryu, in particular, easily 2HKOes Hippopotas with Scald or even OHKOes with Hydro Pump and can also remove its Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon</strong>: Since Hippopotas usually has Earthquake as its only offensive move, Pokemon that are immune to Ground like Vullaby, Gastly, and Bronzor will be able to switch in and remove its item with Knock Off, deal significant damage to it, or set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off removes Hippopotas's Eviolite, allowing even weaker special attackers such as Spritzee and Foongus to easily break through it. Hippopotas also relies on its Eviolite to wall certain physical attackers such as Choice Scarf Doduo.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Slack Off is Hippopotas's most reliable form of recovery and greatly increases its longevity. Stealth Rock wears down the opponent's team over time, and Hippopotas is capable of setting it up on a multitude of threats. Earthquake is Hippopotas's best STAB move and allows it to deal significant damage to many of its foes. Whirlwind is used to prevent foes from setting up on Hippopotas and wears them down thanks to Stealth Rock and Sand Stream, while Rock Tomb is an option to hit Flying-types and lower the Speed of switch-ins; however, replacing Whirlwind means that foes can set up on Hippopotas and it's usually too slow to take advantage of the Speed drop itself, meaning it needs to switch into a teammate for the team to benefit.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite is the item of choice, as it greatly increases Hippopotas's bulk and gives it longevity in combination with Slack Off. The Special Defense EVs with a Careful nature maximize Hippopotas's low Special Defense, meaning it will not be as easily KOed by special hits. This notably gives Hippopotas a good chance to avoid the 2HKO from Magnemite's Flash Cannon and Foongus's Giga Drain. The Defense EVs allow Hippopotas to hit an Eviolite number, while the HP EVs maximize Hippopotas bulk. The Attack and Speed EVs split what remains to give one point to each. The Speed EVs also allow Hippopotas to outspeed Spritzee and Speed tie with Timburr. An alternative EV spread of 132 HP / 20 Atk / 212 Def / 100 SpD / 20 Spe with an Impish nature can be used to maximize Hippopotas's physical bulk in order to better take on physical attackers such as Ponyta and Pawniard, but this leaves Hippopotas even easier to beat with special attacks, notably losing to Magnemite. Sand Stream is the ability of choice, as it allows Hippopotas to remove an opponent's weather and thus serve as a decent check to sun and hail teams.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hippopotas should be used as a check to the opponent's physical attackers. It should be switched in to take a hit and proceed to use Slack Off to recover the damage it has taken or, if it is not threatened, use the opportunity to set up Stealth Rock. If Hippopotas switches in while a foe sets up, it should immediately use Whirlwind, as it will often be unable to avoid a 2HKO from a boosted move. Be careful of switching into Knock Off users; even though Hippopotas will usually take the hit quite easily, it does not appreciate losing its Eviolite, as this greatly lowers its bulk. Scouting for sets before switching Hippopotas in can be very useful; it is able to take hits from many bulky physical attackers and physical Choice Scarf users, but many Life Orb users will be able to 2HKO it. For example, Life Orb Doduo can 2HKO Hippopotas with Brave Bird, but it usually won't if it is holding a Choice Scarf. Always try to avoid taking special hits; Hippopotas will usually be OHKOed or 2HKOed by powerful special attackers. Lastly, if Rock Tomb is run, be wary of using it when the opponent has a Snivy or Pawniard. Both of these gain stat boosts when hit by the move, thanks to their respective abilities Contrary and Defiant, and this can make them very big threats to Hippopotas's team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky pivots such as Chinchou and Foongus can take special hits for Hippopotas and help get it in for free to set up Stealth Rock. Both of these can also take on Water-types, which Hippopotas fears, while the former also deals with Ice-types and the latter with Grass-types. Spinblockers such as Pumpkaboo-XL and Honedge help keep Hippopotas's Stealth Rock on the field. Pumpkaboo-XL can also check Water- and Grass-types for Hippopotas, while Honedge can take Ice-type hits. Spikes setters such as Omanyte and Ferroseed pair well with Hippopotas, as the combination of Stealth Rock and Spikes can whittle down the opponent's team quickly. Ferroseed also takes on Water- and Grass-types for Hippopotas. Entry hazard removers such as Staryu and Vullaby help Hippopotas switch in more freely, as Hippopotas will be forced to use Slack Off more often if Spikes are on the field, which can make you lose momentum. Spritzee and Munchlax are good teammates for Hippopotas, as they both take on special attackers. The latter also takes on Ice-types thanks to Thick Fat, while Hippopotas takes on Steel-types for the former. Rock-types such as Archen and sand sweepers such as Drilbur and Alolan Diglett appreciate Hippopotas's sand to either get a Special Defense boost or potentially sweep an opponent's team.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Skorupi manages to establish a niche for itself thanks to Toxic Spikes, its good Speed and Defense, and its decent defensive typing. However, the rest of its stats are subpar, its typing leaves it vulnerable to common Pokemon like Abra and Ponyta, and its niche as a Toxic Spikes user is better fulfilled by Pokemon like Mareanie. It is even further hindered by the prevalence of Poison-types in LC, such as Foongus, Alolan Grimer, and Croagunk, which can often switch into Toxic Spikes and absorb them.</p>",

However, it has a poor matchup against opposing Stealth Rock users due to its weakness to Rock and inability to hit most of them for much damage. Additionally, Toxic Spikes are generally not as valuable as other hazards and there are better Toxic Spikers in LC, such as Omanyte and Mareanie, as well as better ways to dissuade hazards, like Taunt Onix.</p>"}},

  "Croagunk": {
    "overview": "<p>Croagunk's unique typing and ability let it compress a variety of roles into a single team slot and serve as a fantastic glue Pokemon for offensive teams. Due to its typing, Croagunk has resistances to the common Fighting- and Dark-type moves, and due to its Dry Skin ability, it has a pseudo-immunity to Water. With these resistances, Croagunk becomes one of the few Pokemon in Little Cup with the ability to check all of the Pokemon that rely on these types, such as Chinchou, Mienfoo, Timburr, Pawniard, and Carvanha. Croagunk's typing is helpful offensively as well, as the only relevant Pokemon that resist its STAB coverage are Ghost-types, which it can hit with Knock Off, and other Poison-types. Additionally, Croagunk's wide movepool and acceptable all-around base stats allow it to customize its moveset and thus fit on a wide variety of teams. Access to Knock Off and various forms of priority, including Sucker Punch and Vacuum Wave, further improve Croagunk's ability to support its teammates. However, Croagunk's typing gives it weaknesses to the common Flying- and Ground-type moves and a susceptibility to being trapped and KOed by Diglett. Additionally, Croagunk's Speed is quite low, which leaves it susceptible to being revenge killed by a large portion of the metagame, though its access to priority somewhat remedies this.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Life Orb set is somewhat viable, as its unexpected power can be used as a lure, but the lack of bulk means Croagunk will nearly always be revenged killed very quickly, and the Life Orb will often be revealed due to Croagunk's tendency to be hit by Knock Off. Both Fightinium Z and Poisonium Z are options on the Nasty Plot set to give Croagunk one high-power attack to break through a would-be check, but it costs Croagunk significant defensive capabilities. Earthquake is an option to hit the likes of opposing Croagunk and Mareanie, which otherwise wall Croagunk, but has mostly redundant coverage with its Fighting-type moves otherwise, and neither of these Pokemon threaten Croagunk much offensively while taking acceptable damage from Knock Off. Croagunk gets several other priority options, such as Bullet Punch and Fake Out, which can be mixed onto the above sets, but they tend to be less consistently useful than the moves listed above. Substitute can be used to give Croagunk free turns against foes such as Ferroseed and Foongus and can even be paired with Focus Punch to deal more damage than any of Croagunk's other STAB moves. However, running one or both of these moves causes Croagunk to lose valuable coverage. Croagunk gets several alternative Poison-type STAB moves, such as Sludge Wave and Venoshock. However, the former does not get significantly better rolls than Sludge Bomb and has a much lower poison chance, and Venoshock should only be used with Toxic Spikes support. Finally, Croagunk can bluff Dry Skin and run Poison Touch as its ability, as the poison chance can wear down foes. However, this turns Croagunk into a much worse check to opposing Water-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types are among the only Pokemon that resist both of Croagunk's types, with the other being Ghost-types, which are weak to Knock Off. This means that Pokemon such as Salandit, Mareanie, and opposing Croagunk can all come in on Croagunk and wear it down, though they can't do very much damage due to Croagunk's resistances, except for the odd Hidden Power Psychic Skrelp.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types, such as Mudbray and Hippopotas, don't take significant damage from Croagunk's moves and can easily KO it with their STAB attacks. Additionally, Diglett, although it can't switch in, can trap and remove Croagunk thanks to Arena Trap.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Although Croagunk generally carries Knock Off or Thief to hit Ghost-types, the Nasty Plot set has no such coverage, which means that Ghost-types such as Gastly and Pumpkaboo-XL check it well. Additionally, Honedge, though uncommon, walls the Nasty Plot set completely. The rare Shadow Ball on the Nasty Plot set can hit all of these Pokemon, however.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks</strong>: Due to Croagunk's low natural bulk, it is prone to being KOed by most super effective attacks. Flying-type attacks from the likes of Vullaby and Doduo, Psychic-type attacks from Abra, and Fire-type attacks, which Croagunk has a pseudo-weakness to due to Dry Skin, are all problematic.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot allows Croagunk to boost its Special Attack and punch holes into opposing teams, and it gets many setup opportunities due to its myriad of resistances. Thief can be used over Nasty Plot, which reduces Croagunk's wallbreaking potential but gives it more utility, as it lets Croagunk remove defensive items from foes after Croagunk takes a Knock Off or has consumed its Berry Juice. Sludge Bomb is Croagunk's primary STAB move, 2HKOing most of the Pokemon in the metagame that don't resist it after a Nasty Plot boost. It also has a decent chance to poison foes, which can help wear them down to the point where Croagunk can pick them off with Vacuum Wave. Focus Blast is a much more powerful but less reliable STAB move, which Croagunk can use in situations where it needs to deal more damage, securing a good chance to OHKO Timburr after a Nasty Plot boost. It also has terrific coverage alongside Sludge Bomb. Shadow Ball is an option in the third slot to keep this Croagunk set from being walled by Ghost-types such as Honedge and Gastly, but it gives Croagunk worse overall coverage, as it then lacks a powerful Fighting-type STAB move. Vacuum Wave gives Croagunk a STAB priority move that it can use to threaten revenge killers that can take advantage of its low Speed. Most notably, it does significant damage to Diglett, which would otherwise trap and remove Croagunk, though Diglett must have taken some prior damage to be KOed even if Croagunk is at +2.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread coupled with a Modest nature maximizes Croagunk's Special Attack, giving it maximum wallbreaking potential. The remaining EVs give Croagunk optimal bulk alongside Eviolite by giving it even-numbered stats in both defenses, which allow it to take a myriad of hits while setting up, most notably avoiding the 2HKO from Choice Scarf Mienfoo's High Jump Kick with an Eviolite. A point is also invested into Speed, to allow Croagunk to outpace most defensive foes, specifically RestTalk Mudbray. An alternate EV spread of 116 Def / 188 SpA / 196 Spe can be used to give Croagunk enough Speed to reliably outspeed offensive Mudbray and slow Eviolite Mienfoo, as well as tie with most variants of Vullaby, at the cost of some bulk. While an Eviolite is generally used to give Croagunk maximum bulk, Berry Juice is also an option for an item, reducing Croagunk's bulk but allowing it to take more hits over the course of the match, thus giving it more opportunities to set up Nasty Plot. However, as Croagunk frequently is hit by Knock Off early-game, it often appreciates the initial bulk provided by Eviolite more than the HP boost provided by Berry Juice. Dry Skin is Croagunk's most useful ability because it gives it a pseudo-immunity to Water-type moves, allowing it to reliably check many Water-type Pokemon such as Corphish and Mareanie.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Croagunk should be brought in to check Pokemon that can't deal significant damage to it, such as Timburr, Mienfoo, Corphish, and Chinchou. After coming in, Croagunk will usually force a foe out. Against balanced and bulky offensive teams, it is generally better to either switch Croagunk out or attack early-game, as if Croagunk sets up, it will often be forced out immediately by the foe that comes in. Against slower-paced teams, hyper offensive teams, and balanced and bulky offense teams that have been worn down significantly, Croagunk can use Nasty Plot to begin punching holes in the opponent's team. Although this Croagunk set can be used as a glue Pokemon and switch directly into attacks that threaten its team, keep in mind that the lack of any kind of recovery means that it will get worn down quite easily, so bringing Croagunk in without it taking a hit is ideal when possible. Keep in mind that even with Eviolite, Croagunk is not especially bulky, so avoid allowing it to take super effective or powerful neutral hits while it is still needed in a match.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Croagunk set works well on teams that appreciate its resistances but don't rely on it as the sole check to all of the Pokemon it can check, which gives it more leeway to set up. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Onix, Dwebble, and Omanyte is helpful due to the switches Croagunk forces and allows it to secure more KOs with Vacuum Wave. Pursuit support from the likes of Alolan Grimer and Pawniard is useful to trap Abra and Ghost-types, which force Croagunk out, and to wear down faster foes to the point where they can be picked off with Vacuum Wave. Ground-types are especially problematic for this set, so teammates that can switch in on Ground-types, most notably Snivy and Pumpkaboo, make good partners. Flying-types can also shut this set down, so checks to these Pokemon, such as Onix and Omanyte, fit well alongside Croagunk, and Croagunk can take on the Fighting- and Grass-types that threaten them. Knock Off support is useful to help Croagunk secure more KOs. Mienfoo and Timburr both provide this support well and synergize decently offensively with Croagunk too, as they are able to form an offensive Fighting-type core.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is a terrific support move that allows Croagunk to pressure switch-ins and support its team by removing its foes' defensive items. Sludge Bomb is generally Croagunk's most useful STAB move and comes with a nifty poison chance that can help Croagunk wear down foes. Vacuum Wave allows Croagunk to pick off weakened faster foes, as well as deal with certain threats such as Carvanha and Pawniard without taking any damage. Drain Punch is a secondary STAB move that has fantastic coverage alongside Sludge Bomb and gives Croagunk a way to recover its health while dealing damage to Steel-types that can take a Vacuum Wave like Ferroseed. Sucker Punch is an alternative that lets Croagunk heavily damage faster threats that don't mind Vacuum Wave, such as Abra and Gastly, before it can be KOed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread coupled with a Quiet nature aims to optimize Croagunk's defensive stats by giving it even numbers in both defenses to maximize the Eviolite boost while maintaining offensive presence both physically and specially. An Eviolite further enhances Croagunk's bulk and pairs well with Drain Punch to give Croagunk longevity. Dry Skin is the optimal ability for this set because it allows Croagunk to take on Water-types such as Carvanha, Corphish, and Mareanie.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Croagunk should be used as a glue Pokemon and brought in against the Pokemon that it checks, such as Fighting-types, Water-types, and Dark-types that don't carry coverage to beat it, most notably Mienfoo, Timburr, Corphish, Pawniard, and non-Psychic Staryu variants. Because Croagunk is used as a glue Pokemon, it should not be expected to deal high amounts of damage or repeatedly take powerful hits it doesn't resist. Instead, it should be preserved and switched in and out of battle, recovering HP with Drain Punch as needed, to deal with the threats it needs to check on an opposing team; specifically, it should be kept around for Fighting-, Dark-, and Water-types that its team can't deal with. Opposing setup sweepers such as Scraggy and Shellder fit this bill as well: Croagunk should be preserved while these Pokemon exist on the foe's team so it can revenge kill them with Vacuum Wave. If the opposing team has a Diglett, play cautiously with Croagunk to prevent it from getting trapped, potentially leaving your team open to a Pokemon that Croagunk checks. Opposing pivots such as Mienfoo and Chinchou, which Croagunk can check, become more threatening when paired with Diglett because they can bring Croagunk in and pivot into Diglett, so keep this in mind. Throughout a match, Croagunk tends to force switches because it checks such a variety of Pokemon. Use these switches, especially early-game, to use Knock Off and weaken the opposing team by removing defensive items.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Croagunk set needs little support to perform its role, so it should be fit onto teams that need it rather than built around. It fits well onto teams that are weak to Fighting-, Dark-, or Water-type Pokemon and need a Pokemon that can compress resistances to these types into a teamslot. That said, Psychic- and Ground-types present Croagunk with a variety of issues and need to be dealt with by teammates. Pursuit trappers, such as Alolan Grimer and Pawniard, make good choices as partners to deal with the former, while Grass-types, such as Snivy and Pumpkaboo-XL, make good choices to deal with the latter. Flying-types can easily revenge kill Croagunk as well, making checks to them such as Onix and Omanyte good partners. In terms of the support Croagunk provides, Pokemon that are weak to Fighting, such as Ferroseed, or Poison, such as Snubbull, pair well with Croagunk defensively. In return, Ferroseed can check Psychic-types and some Ground-types for Croagunk, and Snubbull can take on Pokemon that threaten Croagunk with physical attacks thanks to Intimidate. Offensively, Croagunk forms valuable Fighting-type cores with Scraggy and Mienfoo, as they can wear down and use Knock Off on each other's checks. Finally, as Croagunk is one of the better Knock Off users in the metagame, setup sweepers that appreciate its support make good partners. Bulk Up Timburr, Omanyte, and Shellder are all examples of Pokemon with decent synergy with Croagunk, but most setup sweepers in the metagame can take advantage of the Knock Off support that this Croagunk set provides.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Drain Punch is a reliable STAB move that has the beneficial side effect of providing Croagunk with some recovery and hits the Dark-types that Croagunk checks, such as Pawniard and Carvanha, for good damage. Gunk Shot provides excellent STAB coverage alongside Drain Punch and deals much more damage, but it is less reliable due to its miss chance and does not provide Croagunk with recovery. Poison Jab can be used over Gunk Shot as a more reliable alternative, as it has higher accuracy, but the drop in power makes it more difficult for Croagunk to check Fairy-types. The final two moveslots can be customized depending on what support Croagunk needs to provide for its team. Knock Off is an excellent utility move that provides great coverage alongside Croagunk's STAB moves and removes defensive items from foes to make them easier for Croagunk to deal with. Thief provides the same good coverage and utility in removing items as Knock Off, potentially giving Croagunk a defensive item and helping it while hurting the foe, but it requires Croagunk to have been hit by Knock Off to have maximum effect. Bulk Up can be used to allow Croagunk to take advantage of the switches it forces to set up, making it simultaneously harder to switch into and more difficult to take out physically. Sucker Punch gives Croagunk a decently powerful form of priority, allowing it to not be completely helpless against faster revenge killers, especially Abra and Doduo, which can easily OHKO it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Croagunk's Attack to allow it to hit as hard as possible while investing enough EVs into both defenses to optimize Croagunk's bulk in conjunction with Eviolite. The final EV points are put into Speed to allow Croagunk to outspeed Spritzee and Ferroseed. An Eviolite maximizes Croagunk's bulk and pairs well with Drain Punch, allowing Croagunk to take little damage from opposing attacks and heal itself somewhat with Drain Punch. Finally, Dry Skin is Croagunk's best ability because it enables it to check Pokemon that rely on Water-type moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Croagunk makes for a fantastic glue Pokemon and should be directly switched into the myriad of Pokemon it checks, including Mienfoo, Timburr, Chinchou, and Cottonee. After being switched in, Croagunk can take advantage of its wide coverage to pressure the opposing team. Croagunk should be kept healthy as long as it is needed to check foes. Avoid allowing it to take super effective or powerful neutral hits, as Croagunk's defenses are mediocre even when boosted by Eviolite. Additionally, Drain Punch should be used as much as possible to keep Croagunk's health up. Be wary of Pokemon such as Ponyta that can burn Croagunk, drastically lowering its effectiveness for a match. Knock Off should be used often to weaken foes by removing their defensive items and to put pressure on opposing teams by threatening to remove said items. Because Croagunk has only mediocre Attack and Sucker Punch does not get boosted by STAB, it does not hit particularly hard. For this reason, it should usually be used as a way to pick off weakened and faster foes, not as a reliable method of dealing damage. Be especially wary of opposing Diglett, which can come in after Croagunk secures a KO, trap it, and remove it from the match, allowing a foe that Croagunk checks such as Bulk Up Timburr to sweep. Sucker Punch is not a reliable way of dealing with Diglett, as it frequently runs Substitute, forcing Croagunk into mind games, and it only takes out Diglett if it is severely weakened. Croagunk should use Bulk Up on a predicted switch to surprise an incoming foe that will become unable to KO it after it has a Defense boost.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Croagunk set works best on offensive teams that can make use of a non-passive Pokemon with its set of resistances and specifically appreciate a strong Sucker Punch user that can take on opposing Gastly and Abra. Pokemon that are weak to Fighting, such as Pawniard and Carvanha, appreciate Croagunk's ability to take on the likes of Mienfoo and especially Timburr, and thus make good partners. Pokemon weak to Dark-types, such as Pumpkaboo-XL and Gastly, and Pokemon weak to Water-types, such as Mudbray, can make good use the resistances provided by Croagunk as well. Dark-types form a potent core with Croagunk offensively and defensively. Alolan Grimer and Pawniard both can Pursuit trap the Ghost- and Psychic-types that give Croagunk some trouble, and Alolan Grimer forms a Poison-type core offensively as well. Vullaby also pairs well with Croagunk, as they share very good defensive synergy, together resisting a large portion of each other's weaknesses. Pokemon that can take out Ground-types also make good teammates, as Croagunk tends to bring these Pokemon in. Snivy and Z-Trick-or-Treat Pumpkaboo-S are especially notable for their ability to use opposing Ground-types as setup bait, but most other Water- and Grass-types also fill this role well. Rock-types such as Onix and Omanyte pair well with Croagunk because they can check Fire- and Flying-types that can significantly damage it, and they can set up entry hazards to allow Croagunk to more efficiently wear down opposing teams.</p>"

  "Finneon": {
    "overview": "<p>Finneon's main niche is being a Defogger that is not weak to Stealth Rock, with the ability to beat common Stealth Rock users such as Onix and Dwebble with its Water-type moves. It has U-turn to set itself apart from other Water-type entry hazard removers, which allows Finneon to pivot its teammates in and gain momentum. Finneon's good defense stats make it quite bulky, giving it more opportunities to use Defog, and its access to Scald allows it to cripple physical attackers with burns, providing even more utility. Storm Drain gives Finneon more opportunities to switch in, particularly letting it switch into Water-type attacks without taking any damage while obtaining a Special Attack boost. However, because Finneon lacks any sort of reliable recovery, it is quite easy to wear down. It is generally very passive due to its poor Special Attack stat, making it rely on Scald burns to mitigate this. It lacks a lot of coverage moves and usually goes in a pattern in move choice, leaving it predictable. Lastly, it faces competition from Staryu and Kabuto as a hazard remover due to their access to reliable recovery and greater consistency.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tailwind helps boosts the Speed of Finneon's slower teammates for four turns, letting them outspeed the majority of the opposing team. Ice Beam can be used to hit Grass-types harder, but it is pretty weak due to Finneon's poor Special Attack stat. Toxic can be used to put a timer on walls like Spritzee and Pumpkaboo-XL, but it takes a long time to start accumulating significant damage due to LC's low HP numbers. Sweet Kiss provides some utility by confusing the foe to potentially hurt themselves, but the chances of that aren't very high and the utility of the other moves on the set are usually better. Hidden Power Fire can be used to specifically hit Ferroseed, which otherwise walls Finneon, but has limited use outside of that. Offensive sets can be used, but due to Finneon's poor movepool they are generally outclassed by other Water-types like Chinchou, Staryu, and Carvanha.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Foongus and Pumpkaboo resist Scald and 2HKO Finneon with Giga Drain, while Snivy OHKOes with Leaf Storm after Stealth Rock damage. Ferroseed is especially annoying, since it is an entry hazard setter able to wall and beat Finneon with Bullet Seed, though it does not appreciate Scald burns due to them lowering its longevity and its already low offensive presence.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Magnemite and Elekid outspeed Finneon and OHKO it with an Electric-type move after some chip damage, while Chinchou resists Scald and can pick off Finneon with Volt Switch after prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Due to Finneon's passive nature, setup sweepers such as Shellder, Scraggy, and Vullaby can use Finneon as setup bait; however, the former two must watch out for Scald burns. Croagunk uses Finneon as setup bait, as it is immune to Scald because of Dry Skin and resists Finneon's common coverage options, while Timburr and Scraggy are able to shrug off burns due to Guts and Shed Skin, respectively.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog clears all entry hazards from the field, letting Finneon's teammates switch in more easily. Scald is Finneon's STAB move that is capable of spreading burns, crippling physical attackers. U-turn allows Finneon to pivot safely into a teammate and gain momentum for the team. Lastly, Hidden Power Fighting OHKOes non-Eviolite Pawniard that could switch in on Defog to gain +2 Attack because of its Defiant ability.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs placed in both defensive stats along with a Bold nature provide Finneon with more bulk while hitting Eviolite-optimal numbers, with the investment inclined towards physical Defense to better fight common entry hazard setters like Onix and Dwebble. The remaining EVs are placed into HP, Special Attack, and Speed to bump up each by one point. Storm Drain is the preferred ability, giving Finneon more opportunities to switch in and boosting its Special Attack by one stage off opposing Water-type moves. Berry Juice gives Finneon a form of recovery once its HP goes under half, which it otherwise lacks. Eviolite, however, provides Finneon with considerably more bulk at the cost of recovery, allowing it to sponge hits better, such as Mienfoo's High Jump Kick and Focus Sash Abra's Psychic. An alternative EV spread of 124 HP / 152 Def / 232 Spe with a Timid nature maximizes Finneon's Speed stat, allowing it to outspeed Pawniard and Dwebble and Speed tie with Onix, while providing some physical bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Finneon can lead against or switch in on opposing entry hazard setters such as Onix and Dwebble, as it is able to beat them with Scald and remove their entry hazards with Defog. Finneon can be switched in on any Water-type attack thanks to its immunity, though its lack of recovery outside of Berry Juice means it shouldn't risk to switch into most attacks and be worn down from it. It should never switch in on Chinchou, which threatens Finneon with Volt Switch, and should scout Thunderbolt on Staryu before switching in on it. Defog is best used once entry hazard setters and spinners like Onix, Kabuto, and Staryu on the opposing team are gone, as your team can keep entry hazards up without taking any chip damage by the opponent's entry hazards. However, be careful of using Defog when the opponent has a Pawniard, as its Defiant ability boosts its Attack sharply; nailing the switch-in with Hidden Power Fighting can ease the use of Defog. Finneon should use U-turn after it has cleared entry hazards, which allows it to safely bring in a teammate and provide momentum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Flying- and Fire-types such as Doduo, Rufflet, and Ponyta appreciate Finneon's ability to remove entry hazards from the field and in turn are able to combat Grass-types that counter Finneon, with Fire-types being able to lure in Water-type moves for Finneon to switch into. Sturdy users such as Onix, Tirtouga, and Magnemite also benefit from Finneon's ability to clear entry hazards, which deal chip damage that breaks Sturdy. Setup sweepers like Shellder, Vullaby, and Pawniard appreciate being brought in safely by Finneon's U-turn. Diglett is a great partner, as it can trap Electric-types that check Finneon, while it can pivot Diglett in safely with U-turn as well as clear entry hazards for Focus Sash variants. Grass-types such as Foongus, Snivy, and Pumpkaboo-XL synergize well with Finneon, as they provide Grass- and Electric-type resistances, while Finneon resists Fire- and Ice-type moves. Other U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Mienfoo, Chinchou, and Vullaby can switch Finneon in safely, as it doesn't like being worn down by hits, and can complete a VoltTurn core.</p>"

  "Mantyke": {
    "overview": "<p>Mantyke's access to Rain Dance and Swift Swim as well as an excellent offensive typing allow it to function as a fairly effective late-game cleaner, especially since there are only two Pokemon in Little Cup that resist both of Mantyke's STAB moves—Chinchou and the very uncommon Helioptile. It also has a gargantuan base 120 Special Defense stat, allowing it to set up on certain special attackers like Gastly, unboosted Snivy, and Croagunk. In addition, Mantyke resists common forms of priority in Aqua Jet, Mach Punch, and Vacuum Wave, which would otherwise be able to end its sweep prematurely. However, though Mantyke's Hydro Pump is very powerful when rain-boosted, its Air Slash is quite weak, especially coming off a low base 60 Special Attack stat. In addition, Mantyke's 4x weakness to Electric means it can sometimes get KOed by coverage moves on a Pokemon it can usually set up on, like Thunderbolt Gastly or Wild Charge Ponyta. A weakness to Stealth Rock means that Mantyke struggles to switch in repeatedly. Its pitiful physical bulk only amplifies this, as it can rarely switch into or set up on any physical attacker. Mantyke struggles greatly if rain is not up, as it is quite slow without a Swift Swim boost and Hydro Pump is weak without the boost from rain. In addition, since rain only lasts 4 turns, Mantyke is very limited in the time it has to sweep. Lastly, Mantyke faces a lot of competition from other offensive Water-types such as Shellder, Carvanha, and Omanyte, though its incredible STAB coverage and great Special Defense give it a niche.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A defensive set with RestTalk can be used to take advantage of Mantyke's high Special Defense and Water Absorb ability, but it suffers from a weakness to Stealth Rock and a very exploitable weakness to Electric, can be setup bait for many Pokemon, and has to rely on Sleep Talk rolls. Damp Rock is an option to give Mantyke more turns of rain in order to attempt a sweep, but the loss of power from Life Orb or bulk from Eviolite makes it very hard to set up and clean. Scald can be used as a more reliable STAB move that has a chance to burn, but the loss of power means that Mantyke would miss out on many important KOs. Agility is an option over Rain Dance so that Mantyke is not reliant on rain turns, but it misses out on the boost to Hydro Pump that rain provides. Tailwind is another option to boost both Mantyke and its teammates' Speed, but Mantyke is still on a timer to clean, and it also misses out on the boost to Hydro Pump. Mantyke can use both Signal Beam and Ice Beam as coverage options, but the only notable Pokemon Signal Beam hits is Slowpoke, and Ice Beam completely overlaps with Hydro Pump and Air Slash. Lastly, Hidden Power Fire is an option to take out Ferroseed, but it is very weak in the rain, and Mantyke usually prefers the ability to hit Chinchou hard.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Chinchou and Magnemite can significantly threaten Mantyke with their 4x super effective STAB moves while resisting Air Slash. While most Electric-types have to fear a powerful Hydro Pump in the rain, Chinchou resists even that and can easily force out Mantyke. It does have to fear being 2HKOed by Hidden Power, however. Magnemite can utilize Sturdy to always prevent Mantyke from sweeping as long as it is at full HP. Choice Scarf Elekid is also notable, as it outspeeds Mantyke even in the rain and can easily OHKO it. Lastly, Helioptile, while extremely rare, resists Air Slash and is immune to Hydro Pump thanks to Dry Skin and can thus stop Mantyke in its tracks if it's not carrying Hidden Power Ground.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Chinchou and Mareanie can take most moves that Mantyke can throw at them and stop its sweep completely. Though they have to be careful of taking a Hidden Power, some Water-types like Mareanie and Slowpoke can significantly wear Mantyke down through recoil and stall out its rain by spamming their recovery move, as they are only barely 2HKOed by Hidden Power.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Priority</strong>: While Mantyke resists Aqua Jet, Mach Punch, and Vacuum Wave, other forms of priority such as Pawniard's Sucker Punch and Doduo's Quick Attack can significantly threaten it and potentially stop its sweep.</p> <p><strong>Very Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Munchlax and Ferroseed can take any one hit Mantyke hits them with even in rain and threaten a KO with minimal prior damage or cripple Mantyke with a status move like Thunder Wave.</p>",

      "Eye of the Storm (Rain Dance)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rain Dance doubles Mantyke's Speed stat thanks to Swift Swim and boosts the power of Hydro Pump, allowing it to clean late-game. Hydro Pump is Mantyke's main STAB move, and it is incredibly powerful when boosted by rain and Life Orb, OHKOing Vullaby after Stealth Rock as well as Pawniard. Air Slash is Mantyke's secondary STAB move and provides great neutral coverage along with Hydro Pump, as it hits Grass-types like Snivy and Foongus (both of which are OHKOed after a bit of prior damage if Mantyke is holding a Life Orb) super effectively, while Water-types like Staryu and Shellder (which are 2HKOed with a Life Orb boost) are hit neutrally. In addition, it hits Croagunk, which is immune to Hydro Pump thanks to Dry Skin. The last slot is used to hit Chinchou, which otherwise walls Mantyke; both options here KO it after Air Slash. Hidden Power Ground can be used to also hit Mareanie, which takes any of Mantyke's other moves well, as well as Electric-types like Magnemite so that Mantyke doesn't have to rely on the inaccurate Hydro Pump. Hidden Power Grass hits Water-types like Slowpoke and Clamperl, which are both 2HKOed after a Life Orb boost. However, this coverage overlaps with Air Slash, and Electric-types are more threatening to Mantyke than Water-types, so Hidden Power Ground is usually preferred. Surf is an option over Hydro Pump as a more reliable STAB move, but since Mantyke is already not very powerful, the higher Base Power of Hydro Pump is generally preferred.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>9 HP IVs are used in order to lower Mantyke's HP to 19, allowing it to only take 1 damage from Life Orb recoil. Maximum Special Attack investment with a Life Orb and a Modest nature allows Mantyke to hit many damage benchmarks such as a guaranteed OHKO on defensive Vullaby with Hydro Pump in the rain after Stealth Rock as well as having a good chance to KO Chinchou with Air Slash followed by Hidden Power. Maximum Speed investment is used to outspeed 18 Speed Choice Scarf users like Doduo and Gastly after Rain Dance. A Timid nature can be run to outspeed Pokemon such as Vullaby and Adamant Scraggy before a Swift Swim boost, as well as +2 Vullaby in the rain, but the drop in damage is generally not worth it. The rest of the EVs are put into Defense and Special Defense to raise both by one point each. Eviolite can be used in order to patch up Mantyke's poor Defense and boost its Special Defense to incredible levels, giving it an easier time setting up Rain Dance, though it will miss out on certain KOs. If Eviolite is chosen, an alternative EV spread of 76 HP / 36 Def / 200 SpA / 196 Spe should be used to optimize Mantyke's defenses with Eviolite and raise Mantyke's HP slightly. Berry Juice is another option to give Mantyke more setup opportunities, as it allows Mantyke to recover any HP it lost, including to Stealth Rock, but its pitiful physical bulk means that it will likely go down to any powerful hit. Mantyke should run 31 HP IVs if it doesn't run Life Orb. Swift Swim is the ability of choice in order to get the Speed boost from rain and potentially clean late-game.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mantyke should be preserved until late-game, where it should look for a setup opportunity in order to clean once its checks like Chinchou and Ferroseed have been weakened or removed. It can potentially set up on certain special attackers like Gastly lacking Thunderbolt and unboosted Snivy, Fighting-types like Timburr lacking the very rare Thunder Punch and Mienfoo, Fire-types like Ponyta lacking Wild Charge, or Water-types like Staryu lacking Thunderbolt. Always make sure to scout for Electric-type coverage possessed by the foe, especially with Pokemon such as Gastly, Ponyta, and Staryu, as it can quickly put an end to Mantyke's sweep or setup opportunity. It is very important that Mantyke has enough turns of rain to clean up. If your opponent's team still has too many Pokemon remaining for Mantyke to clean in its limited time, it is often recommended to weaken them further before attempting a sweep, even if your opponent can't check Mantyke well anymore. Mantyke shouldn't try to sweep until Sucker Punch users like Pawniard have also been eliminated, as they can generally knock it out easily with only minimal prior damage due to Mantyke's pitiful Defense. Even with a boost from rain and Life Orb, Mantyke is not extremely powerful, so it is important that Eviolites from bulky foes like Spritzee and Slowpoke have been removed and that entry hazards have been set up on the opponent's side of the field, since Mantyke relies on them for many of its KOs.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The most important thing for Mantyke is that Pokemon that can check it, like Chinchou and Ferroseed, are removed or weakened. As such, Diglett is an excellent partner for this, as it can easily eliminate Chinchou if it comes in on a free switch while also being able to eliminate the most common Sucker Punch user in Pawniard. Fire-types like Ponyta also synergize well with Mantyke, as they can threaten or eliminate Ferroseed, while Grass-types like Foongus can threaten and take out Chinchou. Memento support can give Mantyke an easier time setting up, and this can be provided by the aforementioned Diglett as well as Cottonee. Cottonee also functions as a decent check to Water- and Electric-types, most notably Chinchou. Reliable entry hazard control is also very important for Mantyke. On one hand, it needs Stealth Rock away from its side of the field, since it otherwise struggles to switch in. On the other hand, it relies on Stealth Rock being up on the opponent's side to secure important KOs, such as the OHKO on defensive Vullaby. As such, Drilbur and Kabuto are good partners, as they provide both entry hazard support and entry hazard removal. Staryu also functions well as a spinner, while Onix and Ferroseed can reliably get hazards up on the opponent's side. Onix can also use Taunt to prevent its foe from setting up Stealth Rock. Mantyke appreciates another Water-type in order to wear down its checks. The aforementioned Staryu and Kabuto work well to wear down Ferroseed and Chinchou, but Corphish and Carvanha are also good options. Knock Off support from Pokemon like Pawniard, Vullaby, and the aforementioned Corphish is appreciated, as they can allow Mantyke to sweep more easily by removing Eviolites from your opponent's Pokemon.</p>"

  "Snover": {
    "overview": "<p>Snover is one of the best hail setters due to its ability Snow Warning automatically setting it upon switching in. Alongside the hail support it provides, it has a good synergy with Alolan Sandshrew, which benefits from the hail. Snover also has access to powerful moves such as Blizzard, which has perfect accuracy in hail and can do massive damage; Giga Drain, which does reasonable STAB damage and provides a form of recovery; and Ice Shard, which can clean off weakened Pokemon. With a Choice Scarf, Snover can outspeed almost all of the unboosted metagame and take out a variety of different Pokemon such as Water-, Ground-, and Flying-types. Snover's Grass / Ice typing leaves it very weak to the common Fighting-type Pokemon and Stealth Rock and the majority of its setters. Snover also faces competition from the two other hail setters, Alolan Vulpix and Amaura, which can set up Aurora Veil and Stealth Rock, respectively. However, Snover differences itself from the other two hail setters due to being able to recover health with Giga Drain, and it can also clean weakened Pokemon with priority moves as well, which are traits that Amaura and Alolan Vulpix don't have. Snover may have Hidden Power Ground, but it mostly cannot KO its checks in a one-on-one situation unless it hits them on an expected switch, so it lacks reliable coverage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Icy Rock can be used instead of Eviolite on the Balanced Pivot variant if Snover has Slush Rush users on its team so it can set up hail for much longer, which allows its Slush Rush teammates to sweep for longer periods of time and maintain an offensive presence; although, it is generally not used because hail sweepers are weak to too much common Pokemon such as Fighting-types and Staryu, which lessens their sweeping capabilities. Hidden Power Rock can be used alternatively as the last moveslot, as it can also hit Fire-types super effectively on the switch; although, the main purpose of it is to hit Larvesta on the switch, and it isn't as common anymore and important as what Hidden Power Ground can hit. Energy Ball can be used instead of Giga Drain for more STAB damage, although the additional health that Giga Drain provides is much more useful than Energy Ball's secondary effect. Leech Seed can also be used on the Balanced Pivot set as a form of recovery, although Giga Drain is much useful in that context, and Snover struggles to find a moveslot for it. Hidden Power Fighting can be used to hit frail Steel-types on the switch that try to switch into Snover, especially Pawniard; although, like Hidden Power Rock, it is too circumstantial,and Hidden Power Ground covers more types, which is more important. Snover can also utilize a Life Orb and be used as a sweeper on Sticky Web teams due to its excellent movepool that can 2HKO almost all of the metagame. Additionally, it can also act as a soft check to Snivy and Flying-types with its boosted, Ice Shard which Sticky Web teams greatly appreciate.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: If Snover doesn't run Hidden Power Ground, most Fire-types are able to switch into Snover without taking significant damage and can hit it 4x super effectively, which mostly always results in an OHKO. Larvesta can also deal a lot of damage by pivoting on Snover with U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Magnemite and Pawniard can switch into Snover with ease. While they might dislike getting hit by Hidden Power Ground on the switch, they can KO Snover with their STAB Steel-type moves as well as resist all of Snover's moves except for Hidden Power Ground, although it can't KO them if it doesn't hit them on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types that have solid Special Defense such as Mienfoo and Timburr can take any of Snover's moves and can hit it super effectively with their STAB Fighting-type moves. Mienfoo can either outspeed and KO Snover with High Jump Kick or Drain Punch if it holds a Choice Scarf, and if it holds an Eviolite, it can tank any of Snover's moves and KO it back, and Timburr can hit Snover with Drain Punch and finish it off with Mach Punch if Drain Punch doesn't KO it.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Faster Flying-type Pokemon such as Choice Scarf users like Doduo and Rufflet can outspeed all Snover variants and possibly KO it with super effective Flying-type STAB moves. The uncommon Fletchling can also use a priority Acrobatics from full health and KO Snover, although it will only have one chance to do that, since hail damage will break its Gale Wings, and Stealth Rock on the opposing side can also negate Gale Wings as well. If the Flying-types don't OHKO Snover, they will most likely be OHKOed by it, as they have to be careful of Ice Shard if they are weakened.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock does a lot of residual damage to Snover due to its Ice typing, and this cuts Snover's longevity and allows it to be KOed more easily. Additionally, Stealth Rock setters are mostly Rock-types or Pokemon that can use Rock-type moves, which can badly damage Snover if they outspeed it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Snover's primary move is Blizzard, which gains perfect accuracy in hail and is a very powerful and spammable STAB move that can deal massive damage to neutral targets and certain Pokemon such as Vullaby, Mudbray, and Foongus. Giga Drain serves as a secondary STAB move that can hit Pokemon such as Drilbur, Chinchou, and Tirtouga, although the Pokemon it hits with Giga Drain might carry Rock-type moves, which Snover needs to be careful of. Giga Drain also is a decently reliable recovery source. Ice Shard allows Snover to clean weakened Pokemon that it might not be able to outspeed such as Choice Scarf Doduo and Rufflet. Hidden Power Ground is Snover's most effective coverage move, as it can hit most of Snover's checks super effectively such as Pawniard, Ponyta, and Magnemite; although, it most likely cannot KO them in a one-on-one situation, so it is most effective on an expected switch. Hidden Power Fire is an alternative option,but the only additional Pokemon it hits is Ferroseed, which switches into Snover quite easily otherwise.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Snover's Speed investment combined with Choice Scarf and a Naive nature allow Snover to reach 21 Speed, which allows it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and some other Choice Scarf users. The drawback to this is that Snover's Special Defense is lowered by the effect of the Naive nature, although it doesn't really take a toll, since Snover's Attack and Special Attack are more important, and most moves aimed at it are physical anyway. 104 Attack and 184 Special Attack EVs make Snover's moves much more powerful and allow Snover to sweep more easily, especially with Ice Shard. Snover's offensive EVs allow it to OHKO Doduo and Eviolite Staryu with Ice Shard and Giga Drain, respectively, after they take Stealth Rock and hail damage. Snow Warning allows Snover to set up hail automatically and gain a perfectly accurate Blizzard while nullifying other weather effects; it also provides useful chip damage by weakening opposing Pokemon every turn and also breaking their Focus Sash.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Snover is a moderate sweeper that should be sent in early-game to weaken its checks, which are mostly important pivots, so that if they're eliminated, it would be easier for Snover's teammates to sweep. When all of the Pokemon that resist Blizzard such as Fire- and Steel-types are eliminated, Snover can freely spam Blizzard to inflict heavy damage neutrally or super effectively. Snover can switch into resisted moves from Pokemon that don't have any good moves to check it with, and then Snover can revenge kill them if they don't switch out, although Snover needs to be extremely wary of coverage moves because it is rather frail. Snover can use this method against most Chinchou variants, but Snover needs to watch out for Ice Beam. Snover shouldn't directly use Hidden Power Ground against one of its checks in a one-on-one situation because it will most likely lose; however, if they are frail enough, Snover can 2HKO them if it hits them on the switch and outspeeds them later.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Snover's half Ice typing makes it weak to the common Stealth Rock that chips away important fractions of its health, so strong spinners such as Staryu and Drilbur are much appreciated to help preserve Snover's health to allow it to sweep longer; Staryu especially can deal with Rock- and Fire-types for Snover, while it deals with Grass-types for Staryu, forming decent synergy. Pokemon that can deal with Fire- and Steel-types are appreciated because they solidly wall Snover and can KO it easily, so Pokemon such as Staryu and Onix or Ponyta and Mienfoo can take them out, respectively. Knock Off users like Vullaby, Timburr, and Mienfoo are also helpful because they can remove the opposing Pokemon's Eviolite, which leaves them more vulnerable to Snover's sweeping capabilities. Fighting-types are a problem for Snover because they can take a Blizzard, mostly take a few neutral Giga Drains, and KO Snover easily, so Pokemon that can check Fighting-types such as Abra and Doduo are appreciated. Entry hazard setters help Snover sweep more easily; hazards break Focus Sashes on opposing Pokemon and lower their health so Snover has a better chance of sweeping.</p>"
      },
      "Balanced Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Blizzard is a very powerful STAB move that hits 100% of the time in hail and hits Pokemon such as Foongus, Drilbur, and Rufflet super effectively, as well as doing heavy neutral damage. Giga Drain is Snover's other STAB move that hits Water-types that resist Blizzard. Ice Shard is Snover's important priority move that can be used to clean weakened Pokemon, especially if they're faster than Snover such as Doduo or Vullaby after a Weak Armor boost. Hidden Power Ground is generally used as a coverage move to hit Fire- and Steel-types, which otherwise wall Snover, although it shouldn't be used in a one-on-one situation, as it can't OHKO them; it is best used on the switch. Hidden Power Fire has the same purpose as Hidden Power Ground, although it only hits Steel-types, especially Ferroseed, which is a common switch-in to Snover.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Snover's defensive EV investments alongside its Eviolite grant it reasonable bulk, which allows it to tank more neutral or powerful resisted moves such as Hydro Pump and Psychic from Staryu and Abra, respectively. Snover's offensive EVs and a Quiet nature allow it to hit reasonably hard with its STAB moves and Ice Shard, giving it a balance in offense and defense, although the Quiet nature makes Snover a little sluggish. However, Snover's offensive capabilities and its bulk are much more important than its Speed, as it was already slow without the nature already. Snover's offensive EVs also allow it to OHKO Doduo and Eviolite Staryu with Ice Shard and Giga Drain, respectively, after hail and Stealth Rock damage. Snow Warning provides useful chip damage for Snover, as the opposing team gets weakened every turn, which leaves it vulnerable to Snover's strong STAB moves. It also breaks Focus Sashes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>With its balance between defense and offense, Snover can be used as a pivot and switch into Pokemon that it resists and possibly take them out with super effective STAB moves. Pokemon that Snover can switch into and take out include Staryu and Chinchou, although Snover needs to watch out for the latter's Ice Beam if they run it. Snover should not be carelessly pivoted because if its switches into Knock Off, it loses an important portion of its bulk and is left more vulnerable, allowing it to be KOed by its faster checks. Snover should also be careful when pivoting, as the opponent can predict Snover switching in and hit it with a super effective coverage move; unexpected status moves are also risky to switch into, so be careful when pivoting Snover, and beware for status and coverage moves. As the Choice Scarf set is more commonly known and used, Snover can bluff being Choice-locked and surprise the opposing Pokemon that resists the previously used move with an other super effective move; an example of this is if Snover uses Blizzard when Staryu switches in and then surprises Staryu with Giga Drain. Snover should only use Hidden Power Ground if it predicts that one of its checks are going to switch in so it can deal super effective damage, although if Snover cannot outspeed that check, it needs to switch out because it will get KOed. You should never use Hidden Power Ground in a one-on-one situation against Snover's checks because mostly all of them can easily take a Hidden Power Ground and KO Snover.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Snover appreciates powerful spinners and Defog users due to Stealth Rock taking its important health away; it affects this variant even more, since pivots need to switch in and out quite often, so Pokemon such as Staryu and Archen that can help remove Stealth Rock make for great partners. Archen especially is useful, as it can take out Flying- and Fire-types for Snover, while it takes out Water-types that threaten Archen. Pokemon that can deal with Fire-, Fighting-, and Flying-type Pokemon are great partners, as the aforementioned types except for Flying can wall most of Snover's moves and can outspeed and KO it, although Flying-types are in trouble if Snover lives their attack. Pokemon such as Onix, Staryu, and Archen can take out Fire-types, Abra and Doduo can take out the Fighting-types, and Elekid and Kabuto can take out faster Flying-types. Pokemon that appreciate Snover's automatic hail setting such as Alolan Sandshrew and Cubchoo are good teammates, as they both have access to Slush Rush and can sweep the opposing team and some of Snover's checks, including Flying-types. Snover can also help wear down and take out mutual checks. Steel-type checks are also appreciated, as Snover can't take out most of them with Hidden Power Ground alone, unless it hits a frailer Steel-type Pokemon on the switch that it outspeeds and can later 2HKO it. Pokemon such as Timburr, Ponyta, and Diglett are good teammates in this situation.</p>"

  "Snivy": {
    "overview": "<p>Snivy's niche comes from the ability Contrary and the move Leaf Storm, which when paired together give Snivy a 130-Base Power move that also provides a +2 boost to its Special Attack, making it one of the best wallbreakers and the best offensive Grass-type Pokemon in Little Cup. Contrary also has several other uses, including making Snivy one of the best Sticky Web checks in the metagame by giving it a +1 boost to Speed every time it comes in when the entry hazard is up. In addition, Defog lets it support its teammates by clearing entry hazards. However, Snivy's poor offensive movepool forces it to rely on Hidden Power for coverage against the wide variety of Pokemon that resist Leaf Storm. Additionally, Snivy hits 17 Speed, which, while decent, leaves it susceptible to being revenge killed by faster Pokemon; couple this with its mediocre defenses, and its sweeping potential becomes rather limited.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Other Hidden Power types are a possibility on any set if a team needs coverage for a specific Pokemon. Hidden Power Rock is a notable option that allows Snivy to lure in and dispatch Larvesta as well as being able to hit both other Fire-types and Flying-types fairly hard, but it requires that Snivy run 16 Speed. Snivy also has access to Taunt, but most Pokemon can't set up on it anyway because of its ability to boost its stats while dealing damage. Giga Drain is an option as a secondary Grass-type STAB attack that provides recovery but is usually less useful than Snivy's other options. Snivy also has access to Light Screen and Reflect, giving it potential as one of the more offensively powerful screen setters in Little Cup, but dual screens tends not to be a particularly useful strategy in LC, and Snivy doesn't have the bulk to set them especially well. Lastly, Snivy's access to Aromatherapy lets it heal status ailments of itself and its teammates, but it comes from an event that requires Snivy to run a Hardy nature.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Due to Snivy's shallow coverage movepool, Pokemon that resist Leaf Storm can reliably check it so long as Snivy is not running the specific Hidden Power that deals with them. Poison-types, such as Croagunk and Alolan Grimer, as well as Fire-types, such as Ponyta and Larvesta, deal with non-Hidden Power Ground variants well, although Ponyta fears Glare against other sets. Foongus and Flying-types such as Vullaby can deal with non-Hidden Power Ice variants. Lastly, Steel-types, such as Pawniard and Magnemite, check non-Hidden Power Ground or Hidden Power Fire variants effectively. Pawniard is especially notable, since it also punishes Snivy's use of Defog with its ability Defiant. Most of these Pokemon can check Snivy once even if it is running the appropriate Hidden Power, but they can quickly be worn down enough such that, if running the right coverage move, Snivy can take them out.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Snivy is extremely prone to being revenge killed. Doduo, Gastly, and Ponyta, which naturally outspeed it, and Choice Scarf users can all revenge kill Snivy.</p>",

Defog allows Snivy to support its teammates by clearing entry hazards. Glare paralyzes switch-ins to Snivy, slowing them down for Snivy or a teammate to more easily handle. Knock Off is an alternative that cripples defensive switch-ins to make it easier for teammates to break through them. Synthesis increases Eviolite Snivy's longevity by giving it a form of recovery. The final slot goes to the Hidden Power that gives Snivy the best coverage given what its team needs. Hidden Power Ice is the most generally useful option, allowing Snivy to take care of Vullaby and Foongus. Hidden Power Ground is useful for hitting Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-types. Hidden Power Fire allows Snivy to hit Steel- and Grass-types, but because of the required Speed IV drop, it only allows Snivy to hit 16 Speed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>240 Special Attack EVs maximize Snivy's Special Attack, allowing it to hit as hard as possible. 252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature bring Snivy to 17 Speed, allowing it to Speed tie with Drilbur and Archen and outspeed Pawniard. If Hidden Power Fire is run, Snivy only can hit 16 Speed, but this lets it use a spread of 76 HP / 240 SpA / 176 Spe to gain a point of mixed bulk. An Eviolite gives Snivy the bulk to act as a more reliable answer to Ground-type Pokemon defensively while still breaking down teams efficiently offensively. Contrary gives Snivy a +2 Special Attack boost every time it uses Leaf Storm and has other more niche uses, such as allowing Snivy to gain Speed against Sticky Web teams and deter Memento users.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>With an Eviolite, Snivy can take on more of a pivot role, being able to switch into Drilbur, Mudbray, and Chinchou reliably and immediately go on the offensive. Leaf Storm deals enormous amounts of damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Snivy can use its Hidden Power to deal with the Grass-resistant foes that switch in to deal with it, as well as paralyze switch-ins with Glare if the move is run. Defog should be used to clear entry hazards as necessary to support its team. Synthesis should be used periodically to allow Snivy to keep attacking, but it forfeits momentum when it is used. Despite having an Eviolite, Snivy should try not to switch into attacks it does not resist.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Snivy set works best on teams that need more defensive utility from a Grass-type but don't want to sacrifice momentum. Fire-type checks are helpful to Snivy, such as Ponyta and Chinchou. Flying-type checks, too, are important, notably Omanyte, Chinchou, Tirtouga, and Onix. Entry hazard support from the likes of Dwebble and Mudbray helps break down opposing teams. Snivy also works well as a teammate with Pokemon that need entry hazards such as Stealth Rock cleared, such as offensive Vullaby and Doduo.</p>"

Hidden Power Ice is the most generally useful option, allowing Snivy to take care of Vullaby and Foongus. Hidden Power Ground is useful for hitting Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-types. Hidden Power Fire allows Snivy to hit Steel- and Grass-types, but because the move requires a Speed IV drop, running it only allows Snivy to hit 16 Speed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximizing Snivy's Special Attack and Speed allows it to hit as hard and outrun as much of the metagame as possible. With a Timid nature, Snivy hits 17 Speed, allowing it to Speed tie with Drilbur and Archen and reliably outspeed Pawniard and fast Vullaby variants. With the Hidden Power Fire Speed IV drop, Snivy can still outspeed most of the walls it aims to break, but it is more susceptible to being revenge killed by 17 Speed Pokemon, and Pawniard and Vullaby check it more reliably. If running Hidden Power Fire, Snivy should be given an EV spread of 76 HP / 240 SpA / 176 Spe to gain an HP point in exchange for the lost Speed point. Snivy is equipped with a Berry Juice to restore its health once during a match, which is often all it needs to break down opposing walls and clear the way for a sweeper. Contrary gives Snivy a +2 Special Attack boost every time it uses Leaf Storm and has other, more niche uses, such as allowing Snivy to gain Speed against Sticky Web teams and deter Memento users.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Leaf Storm is a very easy move to spam thanks to its enormous power and its side effect of boosting Snivy's Special Attack every time it is used. Snivy's Hidden Power can be used in situations where its coverage is needed, but keep in mind that Snivy usually has to have used Leaf Storm to boost its Special Attack to do decent damage with a Hidden Power. As this Snivy set does not have much longevity after its Berry Juice is gone, avoid switching into attacks that Snivy does not resist, and even then, it should only switch in infrequently. As such, Defog should be used only when necessary so that Snivy does not lose too many turns. If Substitute is chosen, it should be used when it is predicted that a foe will use a status move such as Thunder Wave, to activate Berry Juice and bring Snivy's HP to full, or on a switch to ease predictions. In a pinch, Snivy can set up a Substitute as a check enters the battlefield, use Glare to paralyze it, and continue to use Substitute until the foe is fully paralyzed for a turn in order to give Snivy two free attacks. Glare is also useful on its own to slow down faster checks such as Ponyta to allow Snivy to deal with it more easily later in the game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Snivy's best partners are those that appreciate its wallbreaking capabilities and can check the Pokemon it cannot break past. Fire-type checks, such as Ponyta and Chinchou, make good partners. Flying-type checks, too, are important, with Onix, Chinchou, Tirtouga, and Omanyte working well in this role. Snivy also pairs well with Pokemon vulnerable to entry hazards such as Stealth Rock or Sticky Web due to its ability to remove them with Defog. Snivy appreciates entry hazard support to break down opposing teams more efficiently, making Dwebble and Mudbray useful partners. Sticky Web is an alternative entry hazard that slows down opposing teams, allowing Snivy to overcome its mediocre Speed to an extent. Pokemon that lure in Poison- and Steel-types such as Snubbull and Spritzee are also useful for chipping them enough for Snivy to break through later on.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm is a powerful STAB attack that boosts Snivy's Special Attack by two stages each time it is used thanks to Contrary. Wring Out has great neutral coverage with Leaf Storm and can be turned into a 190-Base Power Breakneck Blitz, OHKOing common Snivy checks such as Croagunk and Foongus that's lost its Eviolite after a Special Attack boost from Leaf Storm. Hidden Power Ground hits Steel-types such as Pawniard, which otherwise wall this set completely, as well as Fire- and Poison-types such as Ponyta and Croagunk while allowing Snivy to reach 17 Speed. Hidden Power Fire is also an option, OHKOing Ferroseed and 2HKOing Pumpkaboo-XL at +2, but it only allows Snivy to reach 16 Speed. Glare paralyzes common Snivy switch-ins such as Ponyta, while Substitute eases prediction and punishes forced switches.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread with a Timid nature maximizes Snivy's offensive stats and takes the IV drops from Hidden Power Ground into account. If using Hidden Power Fire, use an EV spread of 76 HP / 240 SpA / 176 Spe. Contrary has fantastic synergy with Leaf Storm, boosting Snivy's Special Attack by two stages each time the move is used. Normalium Z is necessary to turn Wring Out into an extremely powerful Breakneck Blitz.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Unlike other Snivy sets, this Snivy is very frail; it should only be used once it can successfully sweep or to wallbreak. Bring Snivy into play against Pokemon it forces out, such as Chinchou. Use Leaf Storm as your opponent switches in a Snivy counter such as Foongus, and then use Breakneck Blitz to eliminate that counter. This set functions best as a lure, so don't reveal Wring Out until it can be used to eliminate a counter. In addition, this Snivy set can also clean late-game. Use Glare or Substitute on a predicted switch to either cripple a check or get off an attack for free, respectively. Finally, faster Pokemon such as Gastly and Doduo as well as any Choice Scarf users should be paralyzed or KOed before you attempt a sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slow pivots such as Mienfoo allow Snivy to get into battle safely. Trappers such as Diglett and Alolan Grimer can remove faster threats like Ponyta, Abra, and Gastly, as well as Steel-types that resist Snivy's attacks such as Pawniard. Rock-types such as Onix can set Stealth Rock and remove Doduo and Choice Scarf Flying-types. Offensive threats such as Choice Scarf Mienfoo and Abra that appreciate Pokemon such as Foongus, Vullaby, and Alolan Grimer being lured and eliminated make excellent teammates. If Snivy is not running Hidden Power Fire, Fighting- or Fire-types such as Timburr and Ponyta should be used to eliminate or sufficiently weaken Ferroseed. Keep in mind that other checks to Sticky Web teams such as Gastly should be used, as this set's frailty, along with the fact that it is walled by Pumpkaboo-XL, makes it a poor choice for the sole answer for Sticky Web teams. Similarly, Snivy should be run alongside other answers to Ground-types, as it is too frail to function as the sole Ground-type check on a team.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm is an extremely powerful STAB move that boosts Snivy's Special Attack instead of lowering it due to Contrary, helping Snivy set up while attacking. Giga Drain is an alternate STAB move that lets Snivy safely clean up due to its 100% accuracy or slightly heal itself, although it is quite weak unboosted. Knock Off can catch and cripple bulky Pokemon switching in, such as Alolan Grimer, Vullaby, and Foongus. It can also hit certain Ghost-types decently hard, such as Gastly and Pumpkaboo-XL. Defog can alternatively be run if entry hazard removal is necessary. Hidden Power Ground hits Magnemite extremely hard, as well as hitting Alolan Grimer, Croagunk, and Pawniard. Hidden Power Fire is an alternative to hit Grass- and Steel-types, mainly Ferroseed. Hidden Power Ice is an option to hit opposing Grass- and Flying-types such as Foongus and Vullaby, but since it doesn't hit any viable Pokemon in Little Cup for 4x super effective damage and Choice Scarf Snivy can only use one move after it switches in, it can't power through very much. Hidden Power Psychic and Hidden Power Fighting can be used to defeat Croagunk and Pawniard, respectively, but both can be easily powered through if weakened as is. Glare can be run over Knock Off, as it is more useful for crippling offensive checks and setup sweepers, as well as being a last-ditch effort to stop sweepers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Choice Scarf, a Timid nature, and 252 Speed EVs are used to maximize Snivy's Speed, letting it sweep even more effectively by outspeeding all unboosted Pokemon in Little Cup and even many boosted Pokemon, such as +1 Corphish, +2 Tirtouga, and all 16 Speed Choice Scarf users. However, running Hidden Power Fire leaves Snivy Speed tying with many of these threats. The rest of Snivy's EVs are put into Special Attack to help it deal maximum damage. If Snivy is using Hidden Power Fire, it cannot reach 17 Speed, so the EVs that would go there should be invested into HP instead, making Snivy's EV spread 76 HP / 240 SpA / 176 Spe. Contrary allows Snivy to utilize Leaf Storm to set up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Snivy's main purpose is as a late-game cleaner and situational sweeper, so be sure to remove Snivy's checks before it tries to sweep or clean. Important checks include Alolan Grimer, Vullaby, Foongus, and most of all Ferroseed. Snivy isn't that strong on its own, so it should usually be using Leaf Storm. Using Knock Off or Glare when you predict troublesome Pokemon to switch in can cripple Snivy's biggest foes. Since it's relatively uncommon, Choice Scarf Snivy can bluff being a slower variant and surprise faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Chinchou and Abra that would otherwise revenge kill it. Due to Choice Scarf Snivy's recovery being limited to Giga Drain, it must be kept as healthy as possible, and it should usually only be brought on a free switch. Prediction is important with Choice Scarf Pokemon, and Snivy is no exception. Be sure to use your Hidden Power of choice when you predict Pokemon weak to it to switch in. Snivy's coverage is also quite weak, so unless you're trying to score some surprise damage on a switch-in, these threats should be left to its teammates to deal with. Defog should be used sparingly due to being locked into the non-damaging move after use but can be very useful for supporting a teammate before Snivy faints. Due to this set's lack of a defensive item, it can't be switched in well on threats like Mudbray that it would otherwise be able to.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Mienfoo, Chinchou, and Vullaby can help Snivy get in without taking damage. Diglett can trap and remove Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-types, and certain sets can also set Stealth Rock up. Tectonic Rage Diglett paired with Knock Off users can eliminate some of Snivy's best checks, namely Foongus, Alolan Grimer, and Ponyta. Drilbur can do this as well, but since it doesn't trap these Pokemon, it has a bit less synergy. Entry hazard setters in general, such as Ferroseed, Dwebble, and Pawniard, can set up hazards to break Sturdy on opposing Pokemon, mainly Onix and Dwebble. Many of these Pokemon can also wear down and check Flying-types like Vullaby and Rufflet for Snivy. Doduo and Taillow can break through Grass- and Steel-types for Snivy, while Snivy in return can remove Rock- and Water-types. Checks to Flying-types such as Kabuto, Onix, and Chinchou are near essential, as Choice Scarf Flying-types like Doduo and Rufflet can revenge kill Snivy, while bulkier Flying-types like Vullaby completely wall it. Kabuto and Onix can also set Stealth Rock, with the former even providing Knock Off support. Lures to Snivy's checks, such as Destiny Bond Gastly taking Vullaby with it and Superpower Cophish taking down Ferroseed, can help remove troublesome Pokemon. Knock Off support from Alolan Grimer, Mienfoo, or Pawniard can cripple defensive threats for Snivy. Abra and Gastly can help bait in and wear down Vullaby and Alolan Grimer, making them useful to Snivy. Finally, as Snivy can't function as a proper check to Ground-types, pairing it with Pumpkaboo-XL or Foongus can cover up this weakness.</p>"

In combination with its ability, Prankster, this allows Purrloin to act as a disruptive pivot with good utility. However, Purrloin is heavily restricted by its mediocre bulk, even when invested, giving it few opportunities to utilize its movepool. It also has low offensive presence, restricting it to a support set. Prankster's inability to hit Dark-types also reduces Purrloin's niche significantly, making it unable to paralyze or use Encore on common Dark-type setup sweepers like Scraggy and Vullaby. A poor defensive typing makes Purrloin susceptible to extremely common Fighting-type priority like Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave. Purrloin faces heavy competition from Cottonee, another Prankster user with access to Memento, better bulk, and a better defensive typing, as well as from Alolan Meowth, a Dark-type pivot with better Speed and access to Parting Shot.

Play Rough hits Fighting-types super effectively, and Gunk Shot hits Fairy-types, but due to Purrloin's low offensive presence they will rarely do enough to matter. Sucker Punch can be used to have a priority attack to hit Pokemon like Gastly but is also generally weak. Trick can be used with an item like Choice Specs or Choice Band to disrupt the opponent by forcing them to be locked into whatever move they use, but then Purrloin misses out on bulk or recovery without Eviolite or Berry Juice right off the bat. Sunny Day and Rain Dance get priority from Prankster, but teams based around these types of weather are gimmicky at best.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Pawniard, Vullaby, and Scraggy can all safely switch in on a status move and resisted Knock Off.

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Encore can create an opportunity for a teammate to switch in by forcing a foe to use a move like Stealth Rock or Rapid Spin repeatedly. It's also helpful for locking setup sweepers like Shellder into boosting moves. U-turn creates momentum and takes advantage of the free switches Purrloin sets up. Knock Off can soften up foes for the rest of Purrloin's team by removing items, allowing a teammate to sweep, as well as being its main STAB attack. Thunder Wave can cripple faster threats like Ponyta and Mienfoo, but its accuracy means that it isn't 100% reliable. Another option is Taunt, which can stop Stealth Rock from being set up, but Thunder Wave is usually a more helpful and permanent method for shutting down setup sweepers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite boosts Purrloin's mediocre bulk, allowing it to survive a +2 Vacuum Wave from Croagunk, while Berry Juice gives it a form of recovery and increases its longevity. Prankster is by far Purrloin's most useful ability, giving all of its status moves +1 priority. A Careful nature and 140 Defense EVs let Purrloin hit even numbers. This is important, since Eviolite rounds down when applying the boost; combined with 188 HP EVs, this gives it its maximum bulk at 23 / 12 / 12. 68 Speed EVs net Purrloin an extra Speed point, allowing it to Speed tie with Pokemon like Kabuto and Chinchou. The extra EVs are invested into Attack to slightly increase the power of Knock Off and U-turn. An alternative spread of 108 HP / 36 Atk / 60 Def / 60 SpD / 228 Spe allows Purrloin to hit its maximum Speed at 17, outspeeding Vullaby and Pawniard while Speed tying with Pokemon like Snivy, fast Mienfoo, and Berry Juice Chinchou. However, this makes Purrloin even frailer and more susceptible to Fighting-type priority, so it isn't the preferable EV spread.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Using Encore on a foe to lock it into a status move or weak attack and then following up with U-turn can keep momentum on your side. Thunder Wave can be used freely once Ground- and Dark-types are eliminated, and it can help if your team is on the slow side. Remember that Dark-types are unaffected by Prankster, so resort to U-turn or Knock Off instead of using a utility move on Pokemon like Vullaby, Scraggy, and Pawniard. Thanks to Prankster, Purrloin can switch into moves like Shell Smash and Stealth Rock and use Encore without trouble. Finally, watch out for Pokemon like Croagunk and Timburr, which have access to Fighting-type priority. Timburr especially can use paralysis from Purrloin's Thunder Wave to gain a Guts boost or attack with a strong Mach Punch thanks to Iron Fist.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Purrloin is a great partner for setup sweepers like Omanyte, Shellder, Scraggy, and Vullaby, greatly aiding their ability to set up by locking foes into status or boosting moves with Encore or removing items with Knock Off. Teams that lack priority or ways to deal with setup sweepers also appreciate Purrloin. Fighting-types like Mienfoo, Timburr, and Croagunk can threaten Dark-types, which prevent Purrloin from using its utility moves. Fairy-types like Spritzee and Snubbull can also help check Dark- and Fighting-types that Purrloin struggles with. Poison-type teammates like Foongus, Alolan Grimer, and Croagunk cover all of Purrloin's weaknesses, taking care of Fighting-, Bug-, and Fairy-types. Slow Volt Switch and U-turn users like Chinchou and Larvesta allow Purrloin to get in easier, disrupt the opposing team, and form a VoltTurn core.</p>"

  "Drilbur": {
    "overview": "<p>Drilbur can fulfill several different roles in the LC metagame and thus fits on offensive and balanced teams alike. Its moderate bulk with an Eviolite or Berry Juice allows it to also make use of its good utility movepool to set up entry hazards, remove them, and provide its team with speed control. Its high Attack and Speed stats alongside an amazing offensive typing allow it to use powerful Swords Dance-boosted moves like STAB Earthquake, Rock Slide, and Shadow Claw to punch holes in opposing teams. Drilbur also has an extremely useful ability in Mold Breaker, which allows it to ignore abilities like Sturdy and Levitate to easily defeat the likes of Gastly and Onix. However, despite its perks, Drilbur is rather frail even with an Eviolite and can thus be overwhelmed in trying to accomplish its roles by powerful offensive threats, such as Rufflet, Doduo, and Abra. Drilbur also has a poor defensive typing, with weaknesses to the tier's common Grass-, Water-, and Ice-type attacks and to common priority moves in Aqua Jet from Corphish and Ice Shard from Snover. Drilbur also struggles to deal with some of the tier's Ghost-types that prevent it from using Rapid Spin, as Pumpkaboo-XL resists its STAB attacks and Frillish can threaten it with powerful Water-type STAB attacks. Lastly, Drilbur struggles in that at times it faces stiff offensive competition from Mudbray, which is stronger, has a better ability, and has better coverage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set aimed to sweep in the sand with Sand Rush is quite potent due to Drilbur's high Attack and inability to be outsped in sand. However, Drilbur requires support from Hippopotas, which has an identical typing and thus stacks weaknesses. Drilbur will also lack particularly impressive Speed outside of sand and thus be vulnerable to revenge killers once sand runs out. A Swords Dance + 3 attacks set is plausible, but it requires lots of support to be effective due to Drilbur's frailty and only decent Speed. X-Scissor may seem like a good coverage option at first due to its ability to hit Grass-types super effectively, but it is ultimately not as valuable as Poison Jab or Shadow Claw due to the aforementioned moves' far better coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Foongus, Snivy, and Cottonee can all threaten Drilbur with their super effective STAB attacks, though the latter two must be wary of Poison Jab. Ferroseed in particular doesn't take super effective damage from any of Drilbur's attacks and can threaten it with either Knock Off or STAB Bullet Seed. Pumpkaboo-XL is also particularly troublesome, as while it fears Shadow Claw, it can block Drilbur's Rapid Spin and threaten it with burns or STAB Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Despite its impressive offensive prowess, Drilbur can at times struggle to break bulky Water-types like Slowpoke, Staryu, and Shellder, which can all threaten to OHKO it with super effective STAB attacks before being KOed themselves.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: While they fear either Shadow Claw or Earthquake, Ghost-types like Pumpkaboo-XL, Frillish, and Gastly can switch into Rapid Spin and proceed to cripple or KO Drilbur.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Despite Drilbur's good Speed, its frailty leaves it extremely susceptible to being KOed by faster powerful Pokemon like Gastly, Doduo, and Abra.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is Drilbur's most powerful STAB attack and hits all Pokemon that aren't resistant to the move for sufficient damage. Rock Slide hits the Flying-types immune to Earthquake, like Archen and Vullaby, as well as the likes of Snover, Larvesta, and Dwebble, which can otherwise tank Earthquake, super effectively. Rapid Spin distinguishes Drilbur from other Ground-type Choice Scarf users, allowing it to quickly remove entry hazards from its team's side of the field. Poison Jab hits the Grass-types that otherwise wall Drilbur, such as Snivy and Cottonee, while Shadow Claw can be used to hit Pumpkaboo-XL, which is notorious for walling Drilbur, for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Attack and Speed and a Choice Scarf allow Drilbur to hit as hard as possible and maintain as much Speed as possible. The remaining EVs are invested in Defense to slightly bolster Drilbur's physical bulk. A Jolly nature is preferred for hitting 25 Speed with a Choice Scarf. This allows Drilbur to outpace the entire unboosted metagame as well as 24 Speed Choice Scarf users such as Pawniard, Cranidos, and Rufflet. An Adamant nature can be used, however, to still maintain impressive Speed at the expense of Speed tying the aforementioned Choice Scarf users. Mold Breaker is the preferred ability for bypassing abilities such as Sturdy and Levitate.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set's main function is as a revenge killer due to Drilbur's good Speed with a Choice Scarf. It can also be put to use as a late-game cleaner once Drilbur's checks have been weakened or removed. If Drilbur wishes to clean up late-game, it should be kept healthy throughout the early stages of the match and should only begin spamming Earthquake once Pokemon resistant or immune to the move have been removed. Because Choice Scarf locks Drilbur into its moves, prediction is mandatory for this set's success. Drilbur should use super effective coverage moves on predicted switches to Pokemon like Vullaby and Spritzee and Rapid Spin on switches into Pokemon that don't take super effective damage from its coverage, like Ferroseed and Hippopotas. Avoid Knock Off at all costs, as without its Choice Scarf, Drilbur's Speed will only be average, and it will thus be unable to sweep or revenge kill foes as reliably.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>In order to clean up late-game, Drilbur requires that bulky Grass-types be removed. Ponyta, Doduo, and Gastly are all Pokemon capable of checking Grass-types for Drilbur. Checks to bulky Water-type Pokemon, such as Chinchou, Elekid, and Foongus are also appreciated due to Drilbur's inability to OHKO most bulky Water-type Pokemon. Knock Off support from Alolan Grimer, Pawniard, and Kabuto to remove opposing Eviolites allows Drilbur to more reliably defeat bulkier Pokemon that otherwise would be able to tank its hits rather comfortably. Entry hazard support from Ferroseed, Dwebble, and Onix is also quite helpful, as Drilbur appreciates the chip damage needed to more reliably secure some KOs. Slow pivots like Magnemite, Chinchou, and Mienfoo are also useful teammates, as they can bring Drilbur into play safely.</p>"
      },
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is Drilbur's most powerful STAB option, and with the given Attack investment it is capable of hitting everything that isn't resistant to the move for good damage. Rock Slide offers excellent coverage alongside Earthquake, giving Drilbur a way to hit Flying-types such as Vullaby and Doduo and Bug-types such as Surskit and Dwebble super effectively. It also provides an uncommon but useful flinch chance. Rock Tomb can be used over Rock Slide, as it sacrifices a significant amount of power for better accuracy and the added utility of lowering foes' Speed. Stealth Rock allows Drilbur to support its team and deal chip damage to foes switching in. Rapid Spin is useful for removing entry hazards from Drilbur's side of the field and allows it to support its team by both setting and removing entry hazards. Swords Dance can be used for boosting Drilbur's Attack and turning it into a fearsome sweeper if Rapid Spin or Stealth Rock is not needed. Shadow Claw can aid Drilbur in hitting Ghost-types that may try blocking Rapid Spin, but generally it isn't as valuable as the utility provided by Drilbur's other moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Speed with a Jolly nature allows Drilbur to hit 17 Speed, thus outpacing a good portion of the unboosted metagame and Speed tying other common leads in Onix and Surskit. 76 EVs are invested in Attack to put a decent amount of power behind Drilbur's attacks, most notably allowing it to 2HKO Mienfoo with Earthquake after Stealth Rock and 2HKO most Vullaby sets with Rock Slide after Stealth Rock. The remaining EVs are invested in Drilbur's HP, Defense, and Special Defense to give it the bulk needed to survive hits from the likes of bulky Mienfoo, Vullaby, and RestTalk Mudbray. Berry Juice is the preferred item, as it increases Drilbur's longevity and allows it to tank a hit, use a utility move or attack, and recover in the process of doing so. Eviolite is an option over Berry Juice that allows Drilbur to more comfortably tank certain hits, such as Mienfoo's High Jump Kick, maximum Attack Mudbray's Earthquake, and defensive Staryu's Scald. Mold Breaker is the preferred ability, as it allows Drilbur to ignore abilities such as Gastly's Levitate and Magnemite's Sturdy to reliably OHKO these threats with Earthquake.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Drilbur's access to Stealth Rock and ability to defeat the likes of Dwebble and Onix allow it to function quite comfortably as a lead, especially if it's running Swords Dance. If Drilbur isn't being used as a lead, it should be played very carefully due to its poor bulk. Drilbur should avoid switching in on attacks that it isn't immune to and instead be brought in via pivot support or after a teammate has fainted. Upon being brought into play, Drilbur should capitalize on the switches it forces against the likes of Magnemite, Pawniard, and Alolan Grimer to either lay Stealth Rock down, use Rapid Spin, or set up with Swords Dance. If Stealth Rock has already been laid down or there are no entry hazards to spin away, Drilbur should try predicting the switch into Pokemon resistant or immune to Earthquake, like Archen and Vullaby, and hit them hard with Rock Slide.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ponyta, Doduo, and Sturdy Magnemite are all examples of offensive Pokemon that generally appreciate Drilbur's ability to remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin. Flying-types such as Rufflet and Doduo are particularly appreciative of Drilbur's support, as it can also help remove Electric-, Steel-, and Rock-types that threaten them. Setup sweepers such as Nasty Plot Vullaby, Corphish, and Scraggy also appreciate Drilbur as a teammate due to its ability to support them with Stealth Rock. Slow pivots like Chinchou, Vullaby, and Mienfoo are appreciated by Drilbur for their ability to safely bring it into play. Drilbur also appreciates support from checks to Grass- and Water-types, such as Ponyta, Pumpkaboo-S, and Foongus, due to its inability to defeat most Pokemon of these types.</p>"

      "All-out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is an extremely powerful STAB attack coming off the given Attack investment and Life Orb, allowing Drilbur to put a dent in anything that doesn't resist the move. Rock Slide is great coverage alongside Earthquake, hitting Flying-types such as Rufflet and Vullaby as well as the likes of Larvesta and Dwebble for super effective damage. Shadow Claw allows Drilbur to hit Pumpkaboo-XL, a traditional Ground-type check, for a 2HKO on the switch while also 2HKOing Slowpoke after Stealth Rock. Rapid Spin can be used to trade coverage for quick entry hazard removal, though it is worth noting that Drilbur's frailty requires the move to be used sparingly. Poison Jab, however, is also an option that rounds off Drilbur's coverage, allowing it to OHKO Grass-types that otherwise wall it, such as Snivy and Cottonee.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Attack puts as much power behind Drilbur's attacks as possible, while a Life Orb allows Drilbur to secure the 2HKO on Pumpkaboo-XL with Shadow Claw as well as the 2HKO on Foongus and the OHKO on Sturdy Onix with Earthquake thanks to Mold Breaker. Groundium Z is an option over Life Orb, as it can aid Drilbur in breaking past especially bulky foes, such as Spritzee and Ferroseed. Maximum investment in Speed with a Jolly nature allows Drilbur to hit 17 Speed and thus outpace a large portion of the metagame. The remaining EVs are invested in HP to minimize Life Orb recoil. Mold Breaker is the ability of choice, as it allows Drilbur to bypass abilities like Levitate and Sturdy to OHKO Pokemon like Gastly, Onix, and Dwebble.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set takes a more offensive approach, but it can still function as a decent anti-lead due to its ability to defeat common leads in Sturdy Onix and Omanyte. Drilbur should be especially wary of switching into attacks when holding a Life Orb, as with this set it has even worse bulk. Thus, slow pivot support or the loss of a teammate is mandatory for safely bringing Drilbur into play. This set is rather reliant on careful prediction for its success, as Drilbur will only be able to 2HKO Pokemon like Vullaby, Slowpoke, and Pumpkaboo-XL if it hits them with a super effective coverage move on the switch. If Drilbur is running Rapid Spin over Poison Jab, it should use the move when predicting the switch to a Pokemon that it can't hit for notable damage, such as Cottonee or Snivy. Drilbur's Speed, while good, still leaves it outpaced by a few common Pokemon, such as Abra, Staryu, and Gastly, which means that these threats should be switched out of earlier in the game in order to preserve Drilbur and removed for late-game if Drilbur wishes to clean up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock support is extremely useful, as it allows Drilbur to secure KOs on Pokemon it would otherwise struggle to break in Slowpoke and Vullaby. Onix, Dwebble, and Pawniard are all capable of supporting Drilbur with Stealth Rock, while the latter two can also provide support in the form of Knock Off. Other users of Knock Off, such as Alolan Grimer, Vullaby, and Cottonee, can also be used to remove Eviolites and help Drilbur break past bulkier threats, as well as to remove Choice Scarfs to help prevent Drilbur from being revenge killed. Checks to bulky Water-types, which can be quite the nuisance to Drilbur, are quite helpful as teammates. Examples include Snivy, Elekid, Magnemite, and Chinchou. If Drilbur isn't running Poison Jab, Grass-type checks are also quite helpful. Rufflet, Doduo, and Ponyta can all function as reliable answers to the Grass-types that otherwise trouble Drilbur. Ponyta, Houndour, and Vullaby all appreciate Drilbur's Rapid Spin support if it's running the move and can also aid it in removing the Grass-type Pokemon it hates dealing with. Setup sweepers like Corphish, Vullaby, and Pawniard are also appreciative of Drilbur, as it can break past the defensive Pokemon that they tend to struggle with. Lastly, while not mandatory, Sticky Web support from the likes of Surskit and Spinarak is useful for allowing Drilbur to outpace and KO Pokemon that would otherwise tie or outspeed it, such as Abra, Cottonee, Gastly, and Mienfoo.</p>"

  "Timburr": {
    "overview": "<p>Timburr has a myriad of positive traits that make it one of the best bulky attackers in the Little Cup metagame. Its high Attack stat and good bulk give it increased longevity and the ability to hit hard, and its Fighting typing is good both offensively and defensively. Timburr can take advantage of these traits with STAB Drain Punch, which gives it a recovery option, and Mach Punch, which is a reliable form of priority. To complement its STAB moves, Timburr has a good selection of coverage options, including Knock Off, Poison Jab, and the elemental punches, which allows it to hit its checks, and it also has access to Bulk Up, which turns it into a frightening late-game wincon. Timburr's abilities don't hurt either, with Guts giving Timburr the ability to switch into status-inducing moves without fear and Iron Fist boosting the power of many of Timburr's attacks. Timburr is held back, however, by its poor Speed stat, which leaves it outrun by most of the metagame, and its tendency to being worn down hurts its ability to reliably switch in over the course of a match. It also suffers from four-moveslot syndrome to an extent, as it has to choose whether to run a coverage move that hits Flying-types or one that hits Fairy-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hammer Arm is a powerful STAB move that is boosted by Iron Fist, and Timburr doesn't particularly mind the Speed drop, but Timburr would rather not forgo the recovery provided by Drain Punch or a coverage moveslot. Rock Slide hits Bug-types, which resist Timburr's STAB moves, but is otherwise outclassed by Timburr's other coverage options. Sheer Force is a potentially usable ability with a Life Orb and Force Palm, but it is usually outclassed by Iron Fist.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Timburr lacks a way of dealing meaningful damage to Fairy-types, including Spritzee, Snubbull, and Cottonee, outside of Poison Jab, while they can severely damage Timburr with their super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types resist Timburr's Fighting-type moves. Foongus and Mareanie are difficult to wear down thanks to Regenerator, while Croagunk resists Knock Off as well and can heavily damage Timburr with Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Vullaby and Doduo can outspeed and OHKO even a boosted Timburr with their powerful STAB attacks, but they have to be wary of Ice Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Drain Punch is Timburr's primary STAB move, as it provides a form of recovery and gets a damage boost from Iron Fist. Mach Punch is a decently strong STAB priority move with good coverage. Knock Off hits the Ghost- and Psychic-types, including Pumpkaboo-XL, Gastly, and Slowpoke, that resist Fighting and weakens opposing Pokemon by removing their Eviolites. The final moveslot is dedicated to a coverage move. Fire Punch lets Timburr OHKO Ferroseed, and hits Foongus and Croagunk hard. Ice Punch hits Foongus, Mudbray, and Flying-types such as Vullaby, while Poison Jab OHKOes Cottonee and does significant damage to other Fairy-types. Thunder Punch is also an option to hit Mareanie and Flying-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Attack investment allows Timburr to hit as hard as possible, especially when coupled with an Adamant nature. The remaining EVs maximize Timburr's mixed bulk. Moving the SpD investment to Spe allows it to hit 12 Speed, enabling it to outspeed Pumpkaboo-XL and Snubbull and deal significant damage to both. Timburr can run an alternative EV spread of 116 Atk / 156 Def / 156 SpD / 76 Spe with a Jolly nature to better take special hits, but it would rather not stay in against special attackers in the first place. Iron Fist boosts the power of Drain Punch, Mach Punch, Fire Punch, and Ice Punch, allowing Timburr to hit harder, while Guts allows it to capitalize on status moves to increase its power. An Eviolite is used to boost Timburr's bulk as much as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Timburr set should be used as an offensive pivot, switching in when it can, regaining its health with Drain Punch, and forcing switches. Timburr's typing makes it a great Knock Off absorber, so it's able to switch in on many Knock Off users, such as Pawniard, and threaten them. Later in a match, Mach Punch can be used to pick off weakened threats. Take advantage of Timburr's coverage options to surprise would-be checks, such as Vullaby if Ice Punch is run and Snubbull and Spritzee if Poison Jab is run.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can deal with Poison-type foes are essential for Timburr to perform its role. Overcoat Vullaby takes on Foongus reliably, Chinchou makes a good switch-in to Mareanie, and Abra can take on most Poison types offensively. Checks to Fairy-type Pokemon are also important, including Skrelp, Mareanie, Foongus, Ferroseed, and Pawniard. Vullaby and other bulky Flying-types offensively threaten Timburr, so switch-ins to these Pokemon, like Onix and Chinchou, synergize well with Timburr. Pursuit trappers, such as Alolan Grimer and Pawniard, can take on Abra and other Psychic-types that threaten Timburr offensively. Offensive Pokemon that appreciate Timburr's ability to counter Pawniard, such as Gastly, also make good partners. Finally, if Timburr is not running Guts, a cleric such as Snubbull or Chinchou can cure Timburr of burns, which cripple its offensive potential.</p>"
      },
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Drain Punch is a decently powerful and reliable STAB move that heals Timburr, increasing its longevity. Mach Punch provides fairly powerful STAB priority that picks off weakened foes, and it can deal significant damage to frailer foes after Timburr has used Bulk Up several times. Knock Off removes items, softening up opposing Pokemon, and provides good coverage alongside Drain Punch, able to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types super effectively. Bulk Up boosts both Attack and Defense, potentially allowing Timburr to sweep late-game.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread and a Careful nature let Timburr hit Eviolite numbers in both defense stats, making it as bulky as possible, with the remainder invested in Attack. Timburr can run several alternative EV spreads, including 196 Atk / 156 Def / 156 Spe to hit 12 Speed, as well as a spread of 76 HP / 36 Atk / 156 Def / 236 SpD with a Careful nature, which lets Timburr always survive Abra's Psychic, Zigzagoon's Extreme Speed, and Omanyte's Hydro Pump after a Shell Smash from full health. However, the extra HP point doesn't come into play often, and Timburr generally prefers the Attack investment. Guts allows Timburr to absorb status and set up on the likes of Ponyta and Chinchou, while Iron Fist is an option to boost Timburr's damage output. An Eviolite is used to maximize Timburr's bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early- and mid-game, Timburr can use Mach Punch to pick off weakened threats. Otherwise, it should try to avoid being hit by Knock Off or taking too much damage to maximize its sweeping potential at the end of a match. Once Timburr's checks have been weakened or KOed, it can set up Bulk Up against a Pokemon that can't KO it and sweep an opposing team, regaining HP with Drain Punch and hitting fast, frail attackers with a boosted Mach Punch. If Timburr has to be used early-game, it should draw in its checks and then use Knock Off, which will remove Eviolites and enable Timburr's teammates to more easily wear them down.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>In order for Timburr to sweep, Poison-, Fairy-, and Flying-type foes must be removed or significantly worn down. Pawniard, Foongus, and Ferroseed all handle Fairy-types well, and Onix and Chinchou can handle Flying-types. Poison-types are more difficult to check in one slot, but Abra can check most of them offensively, and various Pokemon such as Vullaby can take on Poison-types such as Foongus defensively. This Timburr set works well on Fighting spam cores, especially with Mienfoo, as both can wear down each other's checks and counters. Diglett makes a good partner to trap and remove opposing Poison-types and weakened Fairy-types. Entry hazard setters such as Dwebble and Onix help wear down the Pokemon that aim to check Timburr, and thus make good partners. Pursuit users are useful to remove opposing Abra, with Alolan Grimer and Pawniard performing this role well. Finally, Carvanha forms a potent offensive core with Timburr; they share many similar checks, most significantly Fairy-types, that they can break past in tandem.</p>"

Even as a rain sweeper, it finds itself outclassed by Mantyke, whose better stats give it more opportunities to set Rain Dance and whose better coverage moves and power make it more threatening than Tympole. Rain Dance is also difficult to use, as Tympole has to find a turn to set up with its poor bulk, only to gain four turns of rain after.

  "Venipede": {
    "overview": "<p>Venipede's access to Speed Boost and Spikes gives it a niche as a reliable entry hazard setter that can deal with common spinners and hazard setters such as Staryu, Drilbur, and Onix using Bloom Doom. Additionally, its multi-hit STAB move Pin Missile can OHKO Focus Sash users like Abra and is generally powerful. Unlike other Spikes setters, Venipede can effectively set up Spikes at nearly any point in the game. Its defensive typing is also pretty good, granting it a 4x resistance to the incredibly common Fighting- and Grass-type moves. Sadly, Venipede's overall poor offensive presence and relatively poor defensive presence make it outclassed by other hazard setters if reliability isn't needed, mainly Ferroseed and Dwebble, which have much better defensive and offensive presence, respectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Focus Sash can be run in tandem with Endeavor to help Venipede take one attack and then bring any slower foe lacking priority down to 1 HP, but it turns Venipede into a suicide lead, severely limiting its use. Poison Jab can be used to hit Fairy-types, but Venipede needs all of its moves and Fairy-types usually can't do much to it anyways. Infestation can trap threats if they aren't carrying U-turn or Volt Switch, but this is very situational. Using a Life Orb can grant Venipede more of an offensive presence, but the job of a powerful physical Speed Boost user is done better by Carvanha, its movepool isn't good enough, and it doesn't have the raw power to be a good sweeper.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types can easily switch into anything Venipede can do and aren't affected by any of its hazards. Weak Armor Vullaby, in particular, can get easy boosts from Pin Missile and, if running Defog, can remove Venipede's hazards.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Similarly to Flying-types, Fire-types like Ponyta can easily switch in on Venipede and apply much pressure to Venipede's team.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: Hazard removers in general can nullify Venipede's purpose, although many, namely Drilbur, Staryu, and Kabuto, are heavily damaged or KOed by Bloom Doom.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers such as Zigzagoon and Doduo can easily set up on Venipede due to its relatively poor offensive presence.</p>",

      "Entry Hazard Stacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes lets Venipede function as an entry hazard setter and aid its team by dealing damage to foes every time they switch in as well as breaking Sturdy. Solar Beam, although not a very good move on its own, can be used with Grassium Z to give Venipede a powerful Bloom Doom, KOing Onix, most Staryu sets, standard Drilbur variants, and Weak Armor Dwebble after a Pin Missile. Alternatively, Toxic Spikes may be used instead of Bloom Doom to give Venipede more hazards to set. Protect allows Venipede to keep itself from taking damage while gaining a Speed boost. Pin Missile utilizes Little Cup's damage rolls to deal a significant amount of damage, OHKOing Abra despite its Focus Sash.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>148 Speed EVs give Venipede the ability to outspeed every unboosted Pokemon in Little Cup after one Speed boost. 36 Special Attack EVs let it OHKO most Staryu and Drilbur and KO Weak Armor Dwebble after a Pin Missile. 204 Defense EVs are used to let Venipede survive two Iron Fist-boosted Ice Punches into a Mach Punch from Timburr. The rest of the EVs are put into Attack and Special Defense to boost Venipede's attacking power and longevity, respectively. Since all of Venipede's stats are equally important, a neutral nature is recommended. As mentioned above, Grassium Z allows Venipede to use Bloom Doom; however, if using Toxic Spikes, an alternative EV spread of 76 Atk / 124 Def / 124 SpD / 148 Spe, Eviolite, and an Impish nature should be used to maximize Venipede's defenses and reach Eviolite numbers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If the opponent has an antilead to Venipede, such as Dwebble, Venipede should be saved until it can be brought in and utilized safely. If the opponent leads with Mienfoo or any other Fake Out user, using Protect immediately can stop Venipede from taking unnecessary damage. Bloom Doom allows Venipede to function as a lure to common Rapid Spin users, but because Venipede outspeeds them thanks to Speed Boost anyway, it should set up entry hazards first and use Bloom Doom only after they have switched in. If Venipede needs to outspeed threats or set hazards for any reason, it should use Protect to gain extra Speed. However, if any of these threats commonly carry Substitute or can boost further, it may be better to attack and surprise them instead. Due to its primary role as a hazard setter, Venipede should usually focus on this instead of attempting to deal chip damage, unless this chip damage is essential for its teammates to score KOs.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sweepers appreciate hazard support from Venipede, with some of the best including Nasty Plot Vullaby, Shellder, and Snivy. Other threatening Pokemon that force switches, Doduo especially, can force foes to take extra damage every time they switch into a check. Late-game cleaners such as Choice Scarf Mienfoo can overcome threats more easily with hazards set up. Phazers, namely Hippopotas and Onix, can force foes to switch and therefore take extra damage from Venipede's hazards. Stealth Rock setters such as Pawniard, Ferroseed, and especially Onix can set up Stealth Rock to stack on top of Venipede's Spikes. Pawniard also deters Defog for Venipede, whereas Ghost-types such as Pumpkaboo-XL, Gastly, and Frillish can block Rapid Spin. If Venipede is running Toxic Spikes, Hex Gastly greatly appreciates its support and can also block Rapid Spin for Venipede.</p>"

  "Cottonee": {
    "overview": "<p>Cottonee's Knock Off-resistant typing, expansive movepool, and fantastic ability in Prankster altogether make it one of Little Cup's best pivot and support Pokemon on offensive and balanced teams. Its plethora of useful resistances allows it to reliably check Fighting- and Water-type Pokemon such as Mienfoo and Carvanha, while its expansive utility movepool, consisting of Memento, Tailwind, and Encore, allows it to make full use of its ability and support its team. Furthermore, Cottonee has access to the coveted priority Z-Memento, which allows it to heal a teammate upon use and nearly guarantee their setup. Unfortunately, Cottonee's 4x weakness to Poison-type attacks makes it susceptible to getting KOed by surprise Poison-type coverage moves from Pokemon that it would otherwise check. Despite its Fairy typing, Cottonee is also unable to check most Dark-types due to its inability to hit them with moves affected by Prankster. Furthermore, Cottonee is weak to common attack types in Ice, Flying, Fire, and Steel, is quite frail without heavy investment, and lacks an outstanding offensive presence even with maximum investment.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cottonee can use Nature Power with Normalium Z to revenge kill foes with a strong priority Breakneck Blitz. Cottonee can also run a utility-based set with 13 Speed and heavier bulk investment, though this usually isn't preferred over the offensive set, since Cottonee cannot use status moves against Dark-types and due to the tier's prevalence of Poison-type coverage. Growth is a decent setup option for boosting Cottonee's Special Attack but is often less valuable than Cottonee's utility moves and STAB attacks. Hidden Power Fire can be used in order to hit Foongus, Ferroseed, and other Steel-types harder; however, it has little use outside of that and usually isn't as valuable as Cottonee's STAB moves or Hidden Power Fighting due to it missing out on 2HKOing Pawniard. Taunt is an option for preventing setup as well as shutting down certain defensive Pokemon, but Cottonee's utility moves in Encore and Memento are usually more valuable. Leech Seed is an option to get chip damage on foes, though this isn't preferred due to the poor amount of recovery LC's damage rolls will provide Cottonee with and due to its more reliable options. Toxic is useful for wearing down bulkier threats like Spritzee and Slowpoke, though it isn't preferred for reasons similar to Leech Seed. Stun Spore is another status option that allows Cottonee to cripple common switch-ins such as Ponyta and Larvesta by halving their Speed, though this isn't as valuable as Tailwind or Memento due to not being able to hit Dark-types and the fact that Cottonee invests in Speed anyway. Nature Power receives priority and can be used to pick off weakened foes but usually isn't as reliable or useful as Cottonee's STAB moves or Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Cottonee's 4x weakness to Poison-type attacks leaves it extremely vulnerable to the likes of Gastly, Croagunk, and Mareanie, which can all OHKO Cottonee with their super effective STAB attacks. Poison-type coverage from the likes of Mienfoo and Diglett, Pokemon Cottonee would otherwise check, is also quite troublesome.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Ferroseed, Alolan Sandshrew, and Magnemite resist both of Cottonee's STAB attacks and can threaten it out with their own super effective STAB attacks, though Alolan Sandshrew must be wary of Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Ponyta and Larvesta resist both of Cottonee's STAB attacks and threaten to OHKO it with their respective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Common Flying-types in Doduo and Choice Scarf Rufflet are capable of outspeeding and OHKOing Cottonee with their STAB moves, while Vullaby is immune to Prankster and can also threaten Cottonee with its STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Spritzee</strong>: Spritzee's high special bulk allows it to tank any of Cottonee's STAB attacks. Furthermore, it is not worried about Encore due to Aroma Veil and can stall Cottonee out with Wish.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Prankster": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Giga Drain is a decent STAB option that 2HKOes Ground-, Water-, and Rock-types such as Mudbray, Chinchou, and Amaura while also providing Cottonee with passive recovery. Dazzling Gleam is a powerful Fairy-type STAB option that 2HKOes Dark- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Vullaby, Timburr, and Mienfoo. Hidden Power Fighting can be used over either of Cottonee's STAB attacks to hit Pawniard for more damage and OHKO non-Eviolite variants, though Cottonee's STAB coverage is usually preferred, as it hits most of the tier neutrally. Encore receives priority from Prankster and is useful for locking foes into status moves as well as discouraging Pokemon such as Tirtouga and Croagunk from setting up on Cottonee. Memento can be used when Cottonee is weakened to severely lower a foe's offensive stats and allow a teammate to begin setting up more reliably. When used with Darkinium Z, Z-Memento will even fully heal an ally and nearly guarantee its setup. Knock Off is useful for removing items from foes and making them easier to whittle down if they were holding Eviolite. Tailwind receives priority from Prankster and can be used when Cottonee is weakened to give its teammates doubled Speed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Darkinium Z should only be used alongside Memento, as it grants Cottonee access to Z-Memento, which is helpful for supporting its teammates. 36 HP EVs, 40 EVs in each defensive stat, and an Eviolite provide Cottonee with reasonable bulk and allow it to avoid the OHKO from powerful hits in Abra's Psychic, unboosted Omanyte's Ice Beam, and Pawniard's Iron Head while allowing it to reliably switch into the likes of Carvanha and Choice Scarf Mienfoo. 140 EVs in Special Attack and maximum EVs in Speed with a Timid nature allow Cottonee to hit 17 Speed and outpace Scraggy and Pawniard as well as Speed tie with fast Mienfoo while hitting quite hard. Prankster is mandatory, as it gives all of Cottonee's status moves an important +1 boost in priority.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is of utmost importance that Cottonee's inability to hit Dark-type Pokemon with Prankster-boosted moves is noted, as it will fail to check Dark-type setup sweepers such as Scraggy and Vullaby. It is because of this that Encore and Z-Memento shouldn't be used on these foes to prevent generating free turns for the opponent. Cottonee's Prankster ability allows it to switch into resisted attacks and setup moves and lock foes into these moves with priority Encore. It is best for Cottonee to use Z-Memento when weakened, as this will allow it to safely bring in a teammate without wasting all of said teammate's HP immediately. Cottonee can also opt to use Z-Memento against threats that will likely OHKO it, such as Sludge Bomb Diglett and Gastly. If running Knock Off, Cottonee can use the move when predicting switches into Pokemon like Magnemite, Croagunk, and Ponyta in order to remove their items. Tailwind is best used when Cottonee is low on HP, as it allows Cottonee's teammates to receive a temporary 2x boost in Speed upon switching in after it has fainted. Cottonee must be wary of Poison-type coverage from foes, given its 4x weakness to the type. Diglett and Scraggy commonly carry Poison-type coverage and should have their potential coverage moves scouted out so Cottonee is able to properly check these threats. It is worth noting that Cottonee's attacks aren't capable of OHKOing most threats, which means that it will often require prior damage from either entry hazards or teammates to secure KOs on threats such as Pawniard and Vullaby. If Cottonee is running Z-Memento, the sweeper it is trying to support should feel free to set up and punch holes early-game, as it will likely be healed by Cottonee later on.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Most Fire-types resist both of Cottonee's STAB attacks while OHKOing it with super effective STAB moves. As a result, reliable answers to Fire-types such as Shellder, Staryu, Onix, and Tirtouga all make for exceptional partners. Pokemon that are capable of switching into or removing Poison-type Pokemon and threats with Poison-type coverage such as Ferroseed, Mareanie, Abra, and Diglett, the latter of which in particular can use its Arena Trap ability to trap Poison-types, are all very appreciated by Cottonee. Pokemon that can take care of the many Flying-type Pokemon that threaten Cottonee, such as Amaura, Chinchou, and Magnemite, are also very appreciated. Powerful wallbreakers like Abra, Doduo, and Rufflet are capable of weakening or eliminating Cottonee's common checks in Ferroseed and Foongus and are also capable of muscling past bulkier threats to help Cottonee break through foes with more ease. Setup sweepers such as Tirtouga, Corphish, and Shellder all greatly appreciate the Memento support Cottonee is able to provide them with. Offensive Pokemon with rather average Speed such as Pawniard, Croagunk, and Snivy appreciate Cottonee's Tailwind support.</p>"

The closest thing Petilil has to a niche is that of a self-setting sun sweeper due to the power of Solar Beam coupled with a good Special Attack stat, but such a niche is rather subpar seeing as setting up Sunny Day leaves Petilil vulnerable for a whole turn, which is especially bad for a Pokemon with the aforementioned issues of poor bulk and Speed.

Petilil also fails to do much damage outside of sun, especially variants that run Solar Beam over Giga Drain.

It also has good coverage moves, such as Fire Fang, that allow it to surprise slower would-be counters, hitting them even harder after Moxie boosts its Attack. However, Sandile is weak to several common offensive types such as Water, Grass, and Fighting, as well as to common priority moves such as Mach Punch, Vacuum Wave, and Aqua Jet, which is further compounded by its terrible bulk. Its mediocre Speed also means that it's reliant on a Choice Scarf in order to not get outsped and OHKOed, which means that it can be very difficult for Sandile to get going, as the opponent can just switch in a Pokemon that resists the move Sandile is locked into. Its lack of Knock Off and recovery moves also means that it faces stiff competition as an offensive Dark-type from Pawniard and Vullaby and as an offensive Ground-type from Diglett, which is faster and hits harder before Moxie.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Fang is an option to remove Water-types and Vullaby, but it's inadvisable to get locked into, and having a Ground-type as your answer to Water-types is generally a bad idea. Life Orb is also an option, but the boost in Speed from a Choice Scarf is more appreciated, as Sandile can boost its own Attack with Moxie. Life Orb also tends to wear it down quickly. Iron Tail can be used, but it's extremely inaccurate, and, outside of removing Fairy-types, it has horrible coverage. Sandile can also run Aqua Tail, but it provides no coverage outside of hitting Mudbray and Archen, both of which are already hit hard by Sandile's STAB moves. Sandile can also be run with Intimidate and an Eviolite as a bulky utility Pokemon, but it tends to be better when used as a sweeper, as it has no recovery and is very frail even after EV investment.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types:</strong> Fairy-types resist Crunch and usually have the bulk to tank Sandile's other moves. Cottonee functions especially well at this, as it resists both Earthquake and Crunch.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types:</strong> Flying-types are immune to Earthquake and can set up easily on a Choice-locked Sandile. Vullaby also resists Crunch, making it an even larger problem.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types:</strong> Pokemon such as Timburr and Mienfoo generally have the bulk to take an Earthquake and can OHKO Sandile. Sandile also cannot take a Mach Punch or Vacuum Wave, which some Fighting-types carry, rendering its Choice Scarf useless.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types:</strong> Most Grass-types such as Snivy and Pumpkaboo-XL have the bulk to take an Earthquake and retaliate with a super effective STAB move.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is a powerful STAB move that does huge damage after one or two Moxie boosts, especially to common Pokemon such as Onix and Mareanie that are weak to it. Crunch is a great secondary STAB option to hit Flying-types or anything weak to it. Fire Fang is a great way to heavily damage Pokemon such as Ferroseed and Cottonee, which resist Sandile's STAB moves. Pursuit is a good option to trap Abra and Gastly as they try to switch out, while Stone Edge does decent damage to Flying-types such as Vullaby and Doduo as they try to switch in.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment allows Sandile to hit as hard and fast as possible. This is augmented by a fantastic sweeping ability in Moxie, boosting Sandile's Attack each time it scores a KO. The remaining EVs are used to boost Sandile's Defense by one point and help Sandile better take physical priority hits; however, they still hit Sandile hard due to its poor bulk. Adamant is the preferred nature to hit as hard as possible, but Jolly can be used to outpace other 16 Speed Choice Scarf users like Pawniard and Rufflet. Choice Scarf raises Sandile's Speed to a very good 24 with an Adamant nature at the cost of being locked into a move; however, Choice Scarf is necessary for Sandile to do its job.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Sandile is best used as a cleaner later in the match when Pokemon that can wall it have been eliminated, especially after any Flying-types or Pokemon such as Cottonee and Vullaby that resist both of Sandile's STAB moves have been eliminated. Sandile is also very weak to a number of priority moves such as Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, so it's good to clear out Pokemon such as Timburr and Croagunk that often have priority moves. The biggest difficulty with this set is beginning its sweep; Sandile is a nightmare for anything that doesn't resist it once Moxie activates, but before that happens, it's very difficult to score a KO on anything to activate Moxie. As a result, Sandile should be brought in on a weakened Pokemon or one that it can hit super effectively to score a quick KO. Sandile can also be used as either a revenge killer with its excellent Speed from Choice Scarf or a Pursuit trapper for Pokemon such as Abra and Gastly. However, if you're using Sandile as a revenge killer, keep in mind that its Attack is rather low before Moxie activates. Avoid switching Sandile into an attack, as its awful bulk means that it cannot take a hit from anything that it does not resist, and when predicting a switch-in that is resistant or immune to Sandile's STAB attacks, always use super effective or neutral coverage. Avoid using Fire Fang unless you are expecting the opponent to switch into a Pokemon such as Ferroseed that would wall Sandile's STAB moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Counters to Fighting-types, such as Spritzee or Snubbull, are necessary for Sandile to do its job, as both have the bulk to deal with a Mach Punch or Vacuum Wave. It's a good idea to have Knock Off support from Pokemon such as Pawniard or Mienfoo to remove Eviolite from foes, as Sandile benefits greatly from foes having reduced bulk. Knock Off can also be used to remove Choice Scarfs from foes such as Mienfoo and Doduo, both of which outspeed Sandile and often carry Choice Scarf. Poison-types such as Foongus are good partners with this set, as they check Sandile's Fighting, Grass, and Fairy weaknesses and in turn can use Sandile to check their Psychic weakness. Stealth Rock support from Dwebble or Archen is also good to have, as it helps wear down Flying-types hoping to switch into an Earthquake. Magnemite is a good partner to Sandile, as it deals with Fairy-types and can serve as a second check to Water-types. Croagunk can also be useful as a Fairy check.</p>"

Darumaka has access to other great moves like U-turn, allowing it to pivot, as well as good coverage in Superpower, Zen Headbutt, and Rock Slide. However, despite Hustle boosting Darumaka's Attack, it also lowers its accuracy, which can cost Darumaka a lot of damage or a KO from the foe if it misses. Its poor bulk and Flare Blitz recoil make it easy to wear down and really hard to switch in. Furthermore, it has a weakness to Stealth Rock, limiting how many times it can be switched in, as well as common Ground- and Water-types. Its awkward Speed tier forces it to hold a Choice Scarf, which leaves it easily revenge killed by a threat that resists the move it's Choice locked into.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Band boosts Darumaka's amazing Attack stat to a gargantuan 40, but it is easier to wear down than the Choice Scarf set due to its Speed tier and more prone to being revenge killed. Fire Punch is an option over Flare Blitz, as it doesn't cause recoil damage, but it's significantly weaker. Flame Charge can be used to boost Darumaka's Speed, but it's not that fast beforehand. A Darkinium Z can be used for Z-Snatch to double Darumaka's Speed, but it takes up a Z-Move slot and is hard to set up due to Darumaka's poor bulk. Darumaka can use Belly Drum with a Berry Juice to hit immensely hard, but Magby does this job better with its greater Speed and priority. Life Orb can be used to boost damage output without being Choice locked into one move, but the recoil in conjunction with Flare Blitz wears down Darumaka tremendously.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Staryu, Chinchou, and Frillish all resist Flare Blitz and can KO Darumaka with Scald. Shellder can use Darumaka as setup bait and KO it with Rock Blast. Corphish and Carvanha can KO Darumaka with priority Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Darumaka loses 1/4 of its health upon switching into Stealth Rock. This in tandem with Darumaka's tendency to wear itself down with Flare Blitz severely limits how much Darumaka can be used in battle.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Onix and Archen resist Flare Blitz and can easily KO Darumaka, but they have to watch out for Superpower and Rock Slide, respectively. Tirtouga, Kabuto, and Omanyte 4x resist Flare Blitz but are weak to Superpower. All of these Pokemon can also set up Stealth Rock, which hugely limits Darumaka's opportunities to switch in.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is Darumaka's most powerful STAB move, being able to OHKO Pumpkaboo-XL and Foongus as well as 2HKO bulky threats that do not resist it such as Timburr, Spritzee, Mudbray, and Vullaby. U-turn allows Darumaka to scout out the foe and pivot to gain momentum for the team. Superpower OHKOes Rock-types such as Omanyte, Onix, and Tirtouga. Rock Slide is great coverage on Darumaka and the best way to hit Archen, Houndour, and Ponyta, as the first two are OHKOed, while the latter is 2HKOed. Zen Headbutt can be used instead to 2HKO Mareanie, Tentacool, and Skrelp if they are a bigger problem to your team, and it is slightly more powerful than Rock Slide.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>196 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature boost Darumaka's Speed to 22 with a Choice Scarf, which allows it to outspeed the whole unboosted metagame. 196 Attack EVs and Hustle reach an Attack stat of 27, which is among the highest in the tier and allows Darumaka to hit really hard. The remaining EVs are placed into HP for better survivability.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Darumaka acts as a revenge killer, since it will usually move first while holding a Choice Scarf. It's a wallbreaker as well because of its sheer power that is able to severely dent bulky Pokemon. It's best to remove any entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, from your side of the field before switching Darumaka in to prevent it from being worn down easily. A slow U-turn or Volt Switch can help bring Darumaka in safely due to its poor bulk and tendency to wear itself down with Flare Blitz. Avoid being Choice locked into Flare Blitz when the opponent has a Flash Fire user, such as Houndour or the rare Flash Fire Ponyta, as it can kill all momentum. U-turn is often a safe option that can be used to scout out the foe as well as gain momentum for your team, but it can miss.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal from Staryu and Vullaby is greatly appreciated, as it allows Darumaka to switch in without taking damage. Grass-types such as Foongus, Snivy, and Cottonee can all deal with the Rock-, Ground-, and Water-types that Darumaka is weak to. Water-types such as Slowpoke, Chinchou, and Staryu can check Ponyta, Rock-, and Ground-types, while Darumaka can check Grass-types in return. Diglett traps and KOes Ponyta, Chinchou, and Rock-types, which give Darumaka trouble, and can also be safely brought in by a U-turn. Knock Off support from Timburr, Pawniard, and Mienfoo helps Darumaka break through bulky Pokemon such as Slowpoke and Spritzee. U-turn and Volt Switch users like Chinchou, Magnemite, and Mienfoo can help bring Darumaka in safely and form a VoltTurn core with it.</p>"

  "Dwebble": {
    "overview": "<p>Dwebble can set entry hazards very well and is a decent Shell Smash user. Weak Armor allows Dwebble to move before any opposing Pokemon after taking a physical hit, making it possible to set up an extra layer of hazards or remove a foe's item while still posing a threat due to its high Speed. Dwebble's other ability in Sturdy is incredibly good along with Berry Juice, and it allows Dwebble to be useful in every game. This combination also allows Dwebble to set up Shell Smash more consistently. While Dwebble faces competition from Pokemon like Shellder as a Shell Smash user and Ferroseed and Onix as a general utility Pokemon and Stealth Rock setter, Dwebble is able to find a niche through its unique coverage, ability to lay multiple hazards, and combination of Sturdy, Shell Smash, and Berry Juice. Dwebble does have some faults, though: it is fairly bad against Pokemon like Onix and Mienfoo, which can outspeed it and shut it down with Taunt, and it does very poorly against most other hazard setters and removers, like Onix and Staryu. Dwebble does not function very well as a check to Flying-types because it does not resist their STAB moves, making it function much less effectively than Pokemon like Onix, which is both a hazard setter and a good Flying-type check. In addition, Dwebble does not have a good defensive typing, as it is weak to Stealth Rock. Dwebble also struggles against and typically loses to Fighting-types, which is bad because they are very common. Finally, Dwebble is weak to the priority move Aqua Jet from Pokemon like Tirtouga and Corphish.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dwebble can use Poison Jab, but it provides very little utility aside from functioning as a coverage move for Fairy-and Grass-types. Rock Slide can be used for more reliable damage, but it is typically weaker than Rock Blast and leaves Dwebble unable to OHKO Pokemon holding a Focus Sash or using Sturdy. Stone Edge is an option if Dwebble wants to hit foes for greater damage, but it's typically not a good idea to use this for the same reasons you wouldn't use Rock Slide along with the greater miss chance. Finally, Dwebble has the option of running Counter to hit physical attackers like Mienfoo and Timburr very hard. Dwebble's other moves, however, are much better than Counter, and the move is hard to fit onto a Dwebble set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fast Taunt Users</strong>: Fast Pokemon with Taunt like Mienfoo and Onix can prevent Dwebble from setting entry hazards or setting up Shell Smash and KO it with STAB moves. Onix can also KO Dwebble very easily with Rock Blast.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Dwebble does not like being inflicted with any status, as a loss of Speed or Attack greatly hinders its abilities. The chip damage caused by burn and poison will also break Dwebble's Sturdy. Pokemon that can inflict status upon Dwebble include Pumpkaboo, Foongus, and Water-types like Staryu and Slowpoke, which can burn Dwebble with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Cottonee</strong>: Be wary of Cottonee, which can use Encore to lock Dwebble into moves like Stealth Rock and Shell Smash. This can greatly decrease Dwebble's utility and often makes it waste its time on the field.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types like Timburr and Mienfoo resist most of Dwebble's moves except for Aerial Ace and can easily KO Dwebble with a STAB move after removing its item with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types resist Dwebble's main STAB attack, Rock Blast. More specifically, Mudbray almost completely walls Dwebble, and Life Orb Mold Breaker Drilbur can KO Dwebble through Sturdy.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Ferroseed and Pawniard can mostly wall Dwebble and hit it with super effective STAB attacks to KO it. Pawniard, however, needs to be wary of Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Staryu can take a hit from Dwebble and spin away the hazards it lays, and physically defensive Slowpoke takes very little damage from Dwebble, even when hit with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Pokemon like Foongus and Timburr can almost always take a hit from a +2 Dwebble and heavily damage Dwebble with moves like Giga Drain and Drain Punch. Foongus can also put Dwebble to sleep with Spore, and Timburr can remove Dwebble's item with Knock Off, making it much more difficult for it to set up.</p>",

      "Entry Hazard Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock helps wear down opposing Pokemon over time. Spikes provides additional damage each time a grounded foe switches in, inflicting fairly large amounts of damage when multiple layers are up. Rock Blast allows Dwebble to knock out Pokemon like Abra and Surskit even if they are holding a Focus Sash. It also lets Dwebble hit opposing Weak Armor Pokemon like Vullaby and other Dwebble very hard. Knock Off broadens Dwebble's utility by allowing it to remove useful items like Berry Juice and Eviolite from foes like Tirtouga, Ferroseed, Timburr, and opposing Dwebble. Earthquake provides a coverage move to hit Steel-types like Pawniard super effectively, which otherwise wall Dwebble and can hit it super effectively in return.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Weak Armor doubles Dwebble's Speed after it takes a physical attack, which makes it possible for Dwebble to set up more entry hazards. 236 EVs in Speed with a Jolly nature let Dwebble outspeed all Pokemon with 15 Speed, like Magnemite and Bunnelby. This also lets Dwebble outspeed all Pokemon in the tier, including Choice Scarf Users, after one Weak Armor boost. 76 EVs are placed in Defense to give Dwebble better bulk against for priority attacks like Mach Punch and Sucker Punch. For Weak Armor sets, these EVs also give Dwebble an extra point of Defense due to its item, Eviolite. The Eviolite itself gives Dwebble enough bulk to take hits like a Rock Slide from Drilbur and nearly always an Iron Head From Pawniard. The remaining EVs are put in Attack to help Dwebble hit as hard as possible. Only add the 36 extra HP EVs when not using SturdyJuice, as Dwebble will otherwise not be restored to full HP when Berry Juice activates. The combination of Sturdy and Berry Juice lets Dwebble take three hits in most cases. With 21 HP total, Dwebble will always be back at full health after Berry Juice activates. Eviolite should only be used with Weak Armor, and Berry Juice should only be used with Sturdy. Dwebble can run an alternate EV spread with 156 Special Defense EVs instead of Attack EVs to avoid being KOed by Staryu's Scald and Surskit's Hydro Pump most of the time.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dwebble is great when used as a lead to set entry hazards and remove the opposing lead's item. Be wary, however, of leading with Dwebble against an Onix, as Onix can use Taunt on Dwebble and proceed to KO it easily with Rock Blast. Dwebble can also function as a check to Flying-types due to either SturdyJuice or its raw Eviolite-boosted physical bulk and its ability to hit them super effectively with Rock Blast. It will, however, take a lot of damage from them, so be careful about relying solely on Dwebble to check them. Use Knock Off on predicted switch-ins like Timburr and Mienfoo to remove their Eviolites. If Dwebble is the SturdyJuice variant, it can sponge at minimum one hit from sweepers that have already set up—assuming there are no hazards on your side of the field—and potentially KO them with Rock Blast or Earthquake. Should it be unable to KO them, Dwebble can make it easier for other teammates to KO them by removing its item with Knock Off, lessening its bulk or recovery. This does not apply to Shellder, which can get around Sturdy. Dwebble can also switch in a couple times due to its recovery from Berry Juice and set up one layer of hazards each time if you wish—this does, however, make it unlikely that Dwebble will be able to set up multiple layers of hazards, since your opponent will easily be able to switch in a check or counter and KO Dwebble. Try not to switch in Dwebble on Fighting-types, as they can all reliably beat it one-on-one. You can, however, switch in Weak Armor variants to be able to reliably set up Stealth Rock. SturdyJuice Dwebble can switch into Stealth Rock when at a bit over half of its health to activate Berry Juice and heal back to full HP; try to take advantage of this to increase Dwebble's utility over the course of the battle.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spinblockers like Pumpkaboo-XL and Frillish are good teammates for Dwebble, as they can prevent its entry hazards from being removed. Similarly, Pawniard is a good teammate, as it deters opposing Pokemon from using Defog due to its ability Defiant. Dwebble prefers to keep Sturdy intact and does not like losing 25% of its HP from Stealth Rock every time it switches in, so Pokemon with access to Rapid Spin or Defog like Staryu, Drilbur, and Vullaby are great teammates for Dwebble. Spinners can remove hazards that would negatively affect Dwebble without removing the hazards that Dwebble sets, so they tend to be better teammates than Defoggers. Dwebble appreciates Pokemon that cover its weakness to Water-types, like Chinchou and Croagunk, and to Steel-types, like Ponyta or Mienfoo. Pokemon that force a lot of switches like Rufflet and Timburr will be able to make use of the chip damage that Dwebble's hazards provide. Finally, Dwebble's hazard setting ability helps wear down the opposing team over time, something that late-game cleaners like Abra, Carvanha, and Zigzagoon greatly appreciate.</p>"
      },
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash boosts Dwebble's offensive stats and gives it an opportunity to sweep or put a large dent into the opposing team. Rock Blast can break Focus Sashes and knock out opposing Pokemon like Abra and Surskit. It can also hit some Weak Armor users like Vullaby and other Dwebble very hard. Earthquake hits Steel-, Rock-, and Poison-types like Pawniard, Onix, Alolan Grimer, and Mareanie. Substitute lets Dwebble block status moves, makes prediction easier, and plays mind games with opposing Pokemon that have Sucker Punch. It also makes it easier for Dwebble to activate Berry Juice. Knock Off lets Dwebble remove the item of a check or counter that switches in to soften it up for other teammates. Aerial Ace lets Dwebble hit Fighting- and Grass-types like Mienfoo, Timburr, Croagunk, Foongus, and Snivy super effectively. The move does have low Base Power, however, and will rarely hit Pokemon that are not weak to it very hard. Dwebble can also use X-Scissor as a STAB move that hits Grass-Types super effectively, but it hits very few other foes and Dwebble's other moves like Earthquake and Knock Off typically provide more power, coverage, or utility.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This set invests enough EVs in Speed to outspeed all Choice Scarf users below 20 Speed after a Shell Smash. An Adamant nature along with maximal Attack EVs allows Dwebble to hit as hard as possible. There are no EVs invested in HP so that Berry Juice will restore Dwebble to full HP, making it possible for it to effectively utilize Sturdy. The combination of Berry Juice and Sturdy lets Dwebble take a strong hit and heal back up to full health, which makes it very easy for it to use Shell Smash safely. Dwebble can also use Groundium Z or Flyinium Z to break through bulkier Pokemon without the need of any Knock Off support, but doing so leaves Dwebble more vulnerable to priority after it sets up than using Berry Juice does.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Dwebble as a sweeper or as a way to weaken the opponent's team at the start of the game. It is better used as a late-game sweeper, as Pokemon like Timburr can beat it easily should it attempt to set up at the start of the game. Dwebble can also attempt to weaken its own checks in the early-game with Knock Off before trying to sweep later in the game, but it should be wary of breaking Sturdy if hazards are up. Make sure to weaken bulkier Pokemon like Timburr and Foongus before sweeping with Dwebble—even with Aerial Ace, Dwebble can only do around 66% to these threats. Also make sure to remove or weaken defensively strong Ground-types like Mudbray and Hippopotas before trying to sweep with Dwebble, as both can tank hits and respond with super effective Rock-type moves; Hippopotas can even phaze Dwebble. Bulky Pokemon in general should be weakened before you try to sweep with Dwebble—Spritzee barely takes 50% from Dwebble's Earthquake at +2, and bulky Water-types like Staryu and Slowpoke can take a hit and return fire with a super effective Water-type move. Do your best to make sure that there are no entry hazards on the field before sending Dwebble in, as it really does not like having Sturdy broken. With the ability to set up Shell Smash at low risk, Dwebble can make holes in the opponent's team or sweep it rather easily. Finally, with the SturdyJuice combination, Dwebble can itself be a check to non-Shellder setup sweepers after they have already set up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon with hazard removal like Staryu, Drilbur, and Vullaby are good teammates for Dwebble, as they can keep it at full health and keep Sturdy intact by preventing any residual damage. Dwebble also synergizes with other sweepers that will be able to take advantage of the opponent's weakened team after Dwebble sets up, nets some KOs, and weakens opposing Pokemon. A couple examples of this are other Shell Smash users like Omanyte and Tirtouga along with Pokemon like Scraggy. Dwebble struggles against bulkier Pokemon like Foongus and Timburr, so Pokemon that hit these very hard like Abra and Doduo are good teammates as well. Unless it uses Aerial Ace, Dwebble has a hard time dealing with Fighting-types, so Pokemon that wall them like Snubbull and Spritzee are good additions to Dwebble's team. Dwebble also struggles against bulkier Water-type Pokemon; Pokemon like Foongus and Ferroseed can alleviate this weakness. Bulkier Ground-types like Hippopotas and Mudbray can prevent Dwebble from performing to the best of its ability, so Pokemon that can check these like Staryu and Snivy are good choices to put on your team. Dwebble also benefits a lot from Knock Off support; this means that Pokemon like Mienfoo and Pawniard are fine additions to the team to help Dwebble break through bulkier threats. Dwebble also appreciates the support of entry hazard setters like Onix and Ferroseed, as the hazards these Pokemon provide help wear down the opposing team, making it easier for Dwebble to sweep. Be wary of revealing that other Pokemon on your team have hazards, however, as this can tip off to your opponent that you are using Shell Smash Dwebble.</p>"

  "Scraggy": {
    "overview": "<p>Scraggy's unique Dark / Fighting typing gives it access to dual STAB coverage that hits a huge chunk of the LC metagame at least neutrally, which coupled with its fairly high Attack stat turns it into a threatening offensive Pokemon. Scraggy most often opts for a sweeper set, first using Dragon Dance to boost its Attack and patch up its mediocre Speed and then attempting to sweep opposing teams with its STAB attacks and variety of coverage moves. Alternatively, Scraggy can also become a threatening cleaner by using a Choice Scarf. Access to useful STAB moves helps Scraggy take advantage of the coverage that its typing gives it, especially Knock Off, Drain Punch, and High Jump Kick. Scraggy also can use two distinct abilities, both of which assist it in different ways. Moxie makes Scraggy more difficult to beat every time it KOes a foe, while Shed Skin gives it a way to shrug off status and more easily set up on status inducers. However, Scraggy suffers significantly from weaknesses to the common Fairy-, Flying-, and Fighting-types, which leave it often struggling to set up, despite its good defensive stats. Fairy-type Pokemon are especially troublesome, as they resist both of Scraggy's STAB moves. Additionally, though it has access to a wide variety of coverage moves, Scraggy must choose which to use, which means that depending on its set Scraggy can be walled by different Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A bulkier set with Intimidate can be used to give Scraggy more setup opportunities against physical attackers, but Scraggy loses either the ability to set up on status inducers or the Attack boosts from Moxie. Various other coverage moves are available to Scraggy, including Head Smash, to hit Vullaby, and Iron Head, as an alternate way to hit Fairy-types that comes with a flinch chance. However, these moves hit a much smaller slice of the metagame than the other coverage moves available to Scraggy. Scraggy can also run Dual Chop to deal with Focus Sash Abra, which otherwise can take a hit with Focus Sash and OHKOes it in return with Dazzling Gleam, but it does very little damage to anything else. Scraggy also has access to the elemental punches and Stone Edge, but most of what these moves hit is hit harder by one of Scraggy's STAB moves anyway. Brick Break is a potential Fighting-type STAB move that can be used to break through Aurora Veil, but it lacks the power of High Jump Kick or the recovery of Drain Punch and is very situational. Finally, various Z-Crystals can be used on Scraggy's Dragon Dance set: Poisonium Z can be used in conjunction with Poison Jab to turn Scraggy into a deadly lure for Fairy-type Pokemon, and Fightinium Z can be used to give Scraggy one extremely high-powered High Jump Kick to take out a weakened foe it otherwise could not KO. However, the lack of Eviolite makes it much harder for Scraggy to set up and leaves it more vulnerable to opposing priority.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types are among the only Pokemon to resist both of Scraggy's STAB moves, and they OHKO it easily in return with their 4x super effective STAB attacks. Snubbull and Spritzee both serve as good checks to Scraggy, taking even a boosted Poison Jab and OHKOing in return, but they have to be wary of being hit by Knock Off or worn down to the range of a Poison Jab KO. Cottonee also makes a decent check to non-Poison Jab variants of Scraggy.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Bulkier Fighting-types, such as slow Mienfoo and Timburr, can take Scraggy's attacks and OHKO in return with their super effective STAB. Timburr has the additional advantage of super effective priority, which it can use to pick off a weakened Scraggy. Croagunk also makes a potent Scraggy check, as it is the only non-Fairy type in the tier to resist both of Scraggy's STAB moves. However, all of these Pokemon must be wary of taking a boosted Zen Headbutt.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Many Choice Scarf users can outspeed Scraggy, even after a Dragon Dance boost, and KO it in return, including Mienfoo, Doduo, Rufflet, Dazzling Gleam Gastly, and Vullaby. However, these Pokemon cannot take a hit from Scraggy.</p> <p><strong>Abra</strong>: Thanks to Magic Guard, Abra cannot have its Focus Sash broken by entry hazards, and so can take any hit from Scraggy no matter how much it has boosted and OHKO in return with Dazzling Gleam. Thus, opposing Abra must have their Focus Sash broken before Scraggy can set up safely.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With Dragon Dance, Scraggy becomes a threatening sweeper, able to boost its Attack and Speed to dangerous levels in a single turn. High Jump Kick is an extremely powerful STAB move that Scraggy can use after a boost to break down teams. However, it comes with a risk of missing and taking crash damage. Drain Punch is a decently alternative STAB option that gives Scraggy a form of recovery while it attempts to sweep, and it is more reliable than High Jump Kick. Knock Off is another powerful STAB move with the added utility of removing foes' items, allowing Scraggy to cripple opposing teams for itself and its teammates. It has terrific coverage alongside Drain Punch, hitting the entire metagame aside from Fairy-types and Croagunk at least neutrally. In Scraggy's final slot, it has a choice of various coverage moves. Zen Headbutt hits Poison-types, such as Foongus and Croagunk, and Fighting-types, which tend to be some of the most common answers to Scraggy. Poison Jab can be run instead to hit Fairy-types for super effective damage, and it comes with a decent poison chance, which can be helpful in wearing down foes. Drain Punch is an option here if Scraggy's team can handle its checks well enough to warrant not running a coverage move, giving it access to both recovery with Drain Punch and power with High Jump Kick.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Scraggy's EV spread gives it enough defensive investment to optimize its bulk with Eviolite, with the remainder invested in Attack and Speed to maximize its sweeping potential. Eviolite couples well with the defensive investment, giving Scraggy the bulk to take hits when necessary while setting up with Dragon Dance, including usually avoiding the OHKO from Vullaby's Brave Bird and always avoiding the KO from Mienfoo's Drain Punch. Scraggy's nature can be Jolly, which allows it to outspeed threats such as Corphish after Dragon Dance and tie with Choice Scarf Magnemite and +2 Tirtouga. Alternatively, Adamant can be run to give Scraggy more attacking power, at the expense of being outsped by the aforementioned threats. Even with an Adamant nature, it should be noted that Scraggy outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame after a Dragon Dance Speed boost. Scraggy's ability is a choice between Shed Skin and Moxie. The former makes it less worried about status, giving it the ability to set up against Will-O-Wisp users such as Ponyta and shrug off other statuses that would cripple most sweepers, such as paralysis and sleep. The latter leaves Scraggy comparably more susceptible to status-inducing moves but makes it very difficult to stop after it gets a KO, which means that after it does set up, Scraggy has a much easier time sweeping.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dragon Dance Scraggy is a late-game sweeper and should be somewhat preserved throughout a match. It is primarily checked by Fairy-types, which resist both of its STAB attacks, and bulky Fighting- and Poison-types, such as Croagunk, Foongus, Timburr, and Mienfoo, so these Pokemon should be weakened and, if possible, hit by Knock Off before Scraggy attempts to sweep. Additionally, when choosing when to set up, keep in mind that Scraggy's coverage moves, especially Poison Jab, aren't particularly powerful even after a boost, so its checks should be weakened as much as possible even if Scraggy does carry a super effective coverage move. However, that doesn't mean it should not be used at all before attempting a sweep: early- to mid-game, Scraggy can lure in its checks and use Knock Off to weaken them for a sweep later in the game. After said checks have been weakened over the course of a battle, Scraggy should be brought in against a Pokemon that can't hit it super effectively, such as Ferroseed or Slowpoke, to set up and then sweep. Be careful, however, about letting Scraggy get worn down too much too early in a match, as if this happens, Scraggy will be susceptible to priority later in the game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Scraggy is a terrific choice for type spam cores, as Pokemon that share one of its types can bring in foes that check it and weaken them for Scraggy to sweep late in the game. Timburr and Mienfoo make good Fighting-type partners to Scraggy, as they can draw in Poison- and Fairy-types and weaken them with Knock Off. Vullaby and Carvanha form a potent Dark-type core with Scraggy and can similarly wear down Scraggy's checks over the course of a match. Alolan Grimer makes an especially notable choice, as it is able to come in on and Pursuit trap Focus Sash Abra, hit Fairy-type Pokemon that aim to check Scraggy super effectively, and use Knock Off and Pursuit to weaken Choice Scarf users that outspeed Scraggy even after a Dragon Dance so that Scraggy doesn't need to worry about them later in a match. Other Poison-types also make good partners, able to take on both Fairy- and Fighting-type Pokemon that can threaten Scraggy. Foongus, Croagunk, and Skrelp make good choices for this, with the first also able to bring in Steel-types that Scraggy can set up on.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>High Jump Kick is an extremely powerful STAB move that can severely dent even the Pokemon that resist it. Knock Off is a far more reliable Dark-type STAB move that Scraggy can spam more freely, and it still hits the majority of the metagame for significant damage while maintaining terrific offensive synergy with High Jump Kick by hitting the Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon that resist Fighting. It even comes with the useful side effect of removing foes' items. Poison Jab is Scraggy's most generally useful coverage move, as it hits the Fairy-types that resist its STAB combination and comes with a useful chance of inflicting poison. Drain Punch is an alternate STAB move that can be used when the power of High Jump Kick is not necessary or its chance of missing should not be risked, especially early-game. Zen Headbutt is an alternative that can hit Pokemon such as Croagunk and Foongus that might switch in predicting a resisted hit.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Scraggy's Attack and Speed so that it can be as fast as possible while still hitting hard. With a Jolly nature, Scraggy reaches 15 Speed, which, with a Choice Scarf, is enough to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, and some slower Choice Scarf users such as Mudbray and Modest Magnemite. This turns Scraggy into a powerful revenge killer. The remaining EVs are used to boost Scraggy's HP, improving its mixed bulk as much as possible. Moxie makes Scraggy into an especially threatening revenge killer, as it gets an Attack boost just by revenge killing something, and can give it the ability to clean opposing teams in the late-game.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Throughout the majority of the game, Scraggy should be used to revenge kill foes. Scraggy can bluff a Dragon Dance set early in the game, which will make Ghost-types less likely to switch into it for fear of Knock Off. After Scraggy's Choice Scarf has been revealed, Knock Off and Drain Punch are the safest moves to spam early in the game to wear down opposing teams if there are Ghost-types on the opponent's team. Ghost-types should be defeated before Scraggy locks itself into Drain Punch, but if there are no Ghost-types remaining on the field, Scraggy should lock itself into High Jump Kick when possible, as it is by far its most powerful attack. Be careful, however, of Protect users, such as Spritzee and Carvanha, when locking Scraggy into High Jump Kick, especially if Scraggy has revealed its Choice Scarf. Poison Jab, and Zen Headbutt if it is run, should only be used when absolutely necessary to weaken the Pokemon they are super effective against, as High Jump Kick will almost always hit harder. Late in a game, when the opponent's Fighting-type switch-ins have been worn down, Scraggy can use its Choice Scarf to clean an opposing team with High Jump Kick. The most efficient way to allow Scraggy to clean is to send it in when it can KO a foe and get a Moxie boost, as it immediately becomes very hard to switch into. Although it has decent bulk, Scraggy should usually not be switched in on opposing attacks, as if it is worn down it will be vulnerable to priority moves when attempting to clean late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The best teammates for Scraggy are those that can give it the support it needs to clean opposing teams in the late-game. Pursuit trappers, such as Alolan Grimer and Pawniard, are essential to remove Ghost-types so that Scraggy can safely use High Jump Kick to clean teams. Both of these Pokemon, along with Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr, are able to use Knock Off, which is also beneficial to Scraggy because it wears down foes for Scraggy to be able to clean late in a game. Pokemon that share checks with Scraggy, such as Carvanha, Vullaby, Timburr, and Mienfoo, can bring in and wear down these checks for Scraggy, again allowing Scraggy to clean opposing teams without fear of these checks. Checks to Fairy-types, such as Foongus, Pawniard, and Alolan Grimer, are useful to take out opposing Spritzee and Snubbull. Finally, entry hazard support from the likes of Ferroseed and Dwebble can wear down opposing Pokemon and get them within range of a KO from Scraggy.</p>"

  "Tirtouga": {
    "overview": "<p>Tirtouga's typing, abilities, and stats allow it to perform both offensive and defensive roles well in the Little Cup metagame. Its access to Shell Smash, two great abilities in Sturdy and Solid Rock, powerful STAB moves in Stone Edge and Waterfall, STAB priority in Aqua Jet, and good coverage options in Zen Headbutt and Earthquake can turn Tirtouga into a strong late-game sweeper, while its Rock / Water typing, great defensive ability Solid Rock, and high Defense stat also allows it to check many prominent threats in the metagame such as Doduo, Rufflet, Vullaby, Pawniard, and Ponyta. In addition, Tirtouga can also support its team with moves like Stealth Rock and Knock Off; however, Tirtouga's offensive sets struggle because of its very low Speed stat, meaning it can be revenge killed by faster Choice Scarf users such as Mienfoo and Chinchou. It's also weak to common priority moves in Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, making it even easier to revenge kill after lowering its defenses with Shell Smash. On the defensive side, Tirtouga lacks recovery, meaning it is prone to being worn down. It also has a big weakness to common Grass-types such as Snivy, Pumpkaboo-XL, and Cottonee.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rest can be used on the defensive set in order to give Tirtouga a form of recovery, but it will make Tirtouga lose out on important power or utility and is thus generally not worth using. Similarly, Berry Juice is an option over Eviolite on the defensive set, but the added bulk from Eviolite is usually more beneficial, as it avoids many important KOs because of that added bulk. Rock Slide can be used on the defensive set for more reliable damage, but it loses out on power and usually misses out on the chance to induce flinch anyway due to Tirtouga's low Speed. A special attacking Shell Smash set with Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, and Earth Power can be used, but it is outclassed by Omanyte due to its much higher Special Attack and higher Speed. Hidden Power Fire can be used on Shell Smash sets to significantly damage Ferroseed after a boost, but it misses the OHKO on it without significant investment in Special Attack, has limited use outside of hitting Ferroseed, and forces Tirtouga to forgo other coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types such as Ferroseed, Foongus, and Pumpkaboo-XL are able to take any of Tirtouga's moves even after a Shell Smash and can OHKO it back with a 4x super effective STAB move. Ferroseed completely walls Tirtouga, as it resists both of its STAB moves, and Tirtouga does not have a coverage move to hit it with.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Timburr, Mienfoo, Pancham, and Croagunk all resist Tirtouga's Stone Edge and significantly threaten it with a super effective move. Timburr appreciates being burned by Scald from defensive Tirtouga thanks to Guts, Choice Scarf Mienfoo outspeeds Tirtouga even after a Shell Smash, Pancham can bypass Sturdy and Solid Rock with Mold Breaker, and Croagunk is immune to Tirtouga's Water-type moves. Timburr and Croagunk can also significantly threaten Tirtouga with their priority moves.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Faster Choice Scarf users such as Mienfoo, Chinchou, and Doduo all outspeed Tirtouga even after a Shell Smash and can often deal significant damage or even OHKO it due to the defense drops from Shell Smash.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Sturdy variants of Tirtouga do not appreciate entry hazards, as they break Sturdy and can ruin Tirtouga's chance to set up. Solid Rock Tirtouga usually lacks recovery, meaning the residual damage entry hazards deal can whittle it down quickly.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock whittles down foes over time and can break Sturdy, and thanks to Tirtouga's excellent bulk in combination with Solid Rock, Tirtouga can set it up reliably. Stone Edge is Tirtouga's most powerful STAB move and heavily damages the Flying- and Fire-types it checks, such as Vullaby and Ponyta, 2HKOing both of them. Knock Off provides excellent utility in removing a foe's item, crippling defensive and offensive Pokemon alike. Finally, Aqua Jet provides priority that can be useful in picking off weakened threats, though it is fairly weak. Alternatively, Liquidation can be used if the extra power is needed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Thanks to Eviolite, Solid Rock, and the defensive investment, Tirtouga can take a multitude of powerful attacks; for example, Tirtouga avoids the OHKO from Mienfoo's High Jump Kick and from Magnemite's Thunderbolt. The defensive EVs are allocated to hit Eviolite numbers of 18 and 14, with the HP EVs allocated to give extra bulk. The remaining EVs are put into Attack and Speed, allowing it to reach 9 Speed, outspeeding Foongus.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Since this set lacks recovery of any kind, always be wary of being worn down. As such, try to keep Tirtouga healthy in order to check the Pokemon it needs to, such as Doduo and Vullaby. If the opponent lacks a Pokemon that you need Tirtouga for, this set can focus on setting up Stealth Rock as much as possible. Against such an opponent, leading with Tirtouga in order to set up Stealth Rock as soon as possible is a good option. It is also a good idea to use Knock Off to soften up switch-ins for other teammates.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Grass-types such as Foongus and Ferroseed have excellent defensive synergy with Tirtouga, as they can switch into Grass-, and in Foongus's case, Fighting-types for Tirtouga, while in return, Tirtouga can switch into the Fire- and Flying-types they fear. Ferroseed can also stack Spikes, which synergizes nicely with Tirtouga's Stealth Rock. Spritzee is a great partner, as it deals with the Fighting-types that Tirtouga fears and can also pass Wishes to increase Tirtouga's longevity. Flying- and Poison-types such as Vullaby, Croagunk, and Foongus can take on the Grass- and Fighting-types that threaten Tirtouga. In return, Tirtouga can deal with Rock-types for the Flying-types. Rapid Spin users such as Staryu and Drilbur can remove entry hazards, which greatly increases Tirtouga's longevity, as it is very easily worn down. Defog users like Vullaby can also be used, but they also remove Tirtouga's Stealth Rock, so they are usually not recommended. Fire-types like Ponyta can be good teammates for Tirtouga as well, as they can check Grass- and Steel-types such as Snivy and Pawniard.</p>"
      },
      "Solid Rock Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash boosts Tirtouga's offensive stats to incredible levels, allowing it to easily clean late-game. Waterfall is Tirtouga's most reliable STAB move and has a chance to flinch the foe. It also hits Ground- and Fire-types such as Mudbray and Ponyta super effectively, both of which are OHKOed after a Shell Smash. Aqua Jet is a fairly powerful STAB priority move and allows Tirtouga to take out weakened threats and faster Choice Scarf users such as Mienfoo and Doduo, while also avoiding Sucker Punch and outspeeding other forms of priority such as Timburr's Mach Punch after a Shell Smash. Stone Edge is a STAB move that hits Flying-types super effectively, OHKOing Rufflet even without a boost and Vullaby after one Shell Smash, and it also deals significant damage to Grass-types such as Pumpkaboo-XL, which is 2HKOed after a boost, and Cottonee, which is OHKOed after a boost. Stealth Rock can be used over Stone Edge, as Eviolite makes Tirtouga bulky enough to set up Stealth Rock and come back in later to sweep; however, the lack of Stone Edge leaves Tirtouga more easily walled by Pokemon such as Pumpkaboo-XL and Vullaby. Zen Headbutt can be used to hit Fighting- and Poison-types super effectively, as it usually OHKOes bulky Mienfoo, Foongus, and Mareanie after a Shell Smash and Stealth Rock damage, and Timburr after a Shell Smash and a bit of prior damage, as long as Tirtouga has an Adamant nature. Earthquake is an option to hit Pawniard, Chinchou, and Mareanie super effectively, OHKOing all of them after a Shell Smash.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Thanks to Solid Rock, Tirtouga can set up on some Pokemon that hit it super effectively like Mienfoo and physical Croagunk variants, while also allowing it to take certain priority moves like Mach Punch better. The given defensive investment along with with Solid Rock and Eviolite maximizes Tirtouga's bulk while sacrificing negligible power, especially after a boost. In particular, it usually allows Tirtouga to avoid the 2HKO from Croagunk's Vacuum Wave. 180 Speed EVs give Tirtouga 11 Speed, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame after a Shell Smash. It also allows Tirtouga to outspeed 14 Speed Choice Scarf users such as Mudbray and Modest Magnemite, while Speed tying with 15 Speed Choice Scarf users like Timid Magnemite and Adamant Bunnelby after a boost. 132 Attack EVs significantly increase Tirtouga's Attack, making it deal as much damage as possible. A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed 14 and 15 Speed Choice Scarf users and Speed tie with 16 Speed Choice Scarf users after a Shell Smash. An Adamant nature can be used to OHKO certain Fighting- and Poison-types such as bulky Mienfoo, Foongus, and Mareanie after Stealth Rock damage and a Shell Smash boost with Zen Headbutt, but these OHKOs can also be secured if Tirtouga's team can use Knock Off to remove the Eviolites of the aforementioned Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early-and mid-game, this Tirtouga set can be used to check Fire- and Flying-types, as its good bulk allows it to retain enough HP to attempt a late-game sweep. Still, you should focus on eventually setting up a Shell Smash. In addition to Fire- and Flying-types, this Tirtouga set can also set up on some traditional Tirtouga checks, such as Mienfoo and physical attacking Croagunk, thanks to Solid Rock. However, this is usually not recommended, as Tirtouga will still take significant damage from them, making it easier to be revenge killed by fast Choice Scarf users and priority users. Before setting up, opposing priority users such as Timburr and Pawniard should be removed, as they can easily stop Tirtouga's sweep. Despite Solid Rock, Tirtouga still has to be very careful of Grass-type moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Tirtouga set really appreciates Memento support, as it will not take much damage on the turn it sets up thanks to the offensive drops from Memento and its good bulk. Due to the lack of recovery on this set Memento support might keep it out of range of certain priority moves, such as Croagunk's Vacuum Wave. Cottonee is especially good as a Memento user, as it also has excellent defensive synergy with Tirtouga. Z-Memento also synergizes nicely with this Tirtouga, as it allows it to play much more freely early-game and makes it less susceptibleto being worn down, before being healed back up to full HP and attempting a sweep late-game. Diglett and Alolan Grimer can also provide Tirtouga with Memento support, though they don't synergize with Tirtouga as well. Aurora Veil support from Alolan Vulpix is appreciated for similar reasons to Memento support, though it persists even after an opponent switches out. Unfortunately the hail that Alolan Vulpix sets up can wear down Tirtouga somewhat. Drilbur is also a good partner for Tirtouga, as it can take on the Electric-types that threaten Tirtouga, set up Stealth Rock to help secure crucial KOs for Tirtouga, and remove entry hazards to improve Tirtouga's longevity. Flying-types such as Vullaby, Doduo, and Rufflet help Tirtouga by dealing with Grass- and Fighting-types. They can also carry coverage to hit Ferroseed, which completely walls Tirtouga. Another powerful Water-type such as Staryu or Corphish can synergize offensively with Tirtouga, as the two can weaken each other's checks, such as Ferroseed or Pumpkaboo-XL, allowing for a potential sweep by one of them. Staryu can also remove entry hazards for Tirtouga, increasing its longevity. Knock Off users work very well with this set, as they can remove Eviolites from defensive Pokemon, helping Tirtouga secure crucial KOs, especially on Fighting- and Poison-types such as bulky Mienfoo, Foongus, and Mareanie. For this reason, Pawniard works well to lure in Fighting-types and use Knock Off to remove their item, while Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr can lure in the aforementioned Poison-types. Fire-types such as Ponyta are also very useful, since they can check Grass-types for Tirtouga and have a much easier time breaking through Ferroseed than Flying-types do.</p>"
      },
      "Sturdy Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash boosts Tirtouga's offensive stats to monstrous levels, allowing it to easily clean late-game. Waterfall is Tirtouga's most reliable STAB move and has a nice chance to flinch. It also hits Ground- and Fire-types such as Mudbray and Ponyta super effectively, OHKOing both of them after a Shell Smash boost. Aqua Jet is a STAB priority move that can deal significant damage after a Shell Smash and allows Tirtouga to take out faster Choice Scarf users, such as Mienfoo and Doduo, after a bit of prior damage, in addition to avoiding Sucker Punch and outspeeding other forms of priority such as Timburr's Mach Punch after a Shell Smash. It can also be very useful to pick off weakened threats. Stone Edge is Tirtouga's secondary STAB move that hits Flying-types super effectively, OHKOing Rufflet without a boost and Vullaby after one Shell Smash, while also dealing significant damage to Grass-types such as Pumpkaboo-XL, which is 2HKOed after a Shell Smash, and Cottonee, which is usually OHKOed after a Shell Smash. Zen Headbutt hits Fighting- and Poison-types super effectively, usually OHKOing bulky Mienfoo, Foongus, and Mareanie after a Shell Smash and Stealth Rock damage, and Timburr after a Shell Smash and a bit of prior damage. Earthquake hits Pawniard, Chinchou, and Mareanie super effectively, OHKOing all of them after a Shell Smash.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The combination of Sturdy and Berry Juice guarantees Tirtouga a chance to set up a Shell Smash and sweep. The Speed EVs along with a Jolly nature allow Tirtouga to outspeed 14 and 15 Speed Choice Scarf users such as Scraggy and Magnemite and Speed tie with 16 Speed Choice Scarf users, such as Pawniard, after a Shell Smash. The Attack EVs maximize Tirtouga's Attack, allowing it to deal as much damage as possible. The remaining EVs are put into Defense to bolster its already impressive physical bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tirtouga should mainly be used late-game to set up a Shell Smash and clean up a weakened team when its counters have been removed. Always try to remain at full HP in order to activate Sturdy, as it will give Tirtouga a much easier time setting up. This can be achieved by removing entry hazards and bringing Tirtouga in on free switches through use of a slow Volt Switch or U-turn. If Sturdy is intact and Tirtouga is still holding its Berry Juice, it can set up on anything that it can OHKO after a boost, such as Vullaby, Mudbray, and Chinchou, or on passive Pokemon, such as Bronzor and Spritzee. Usually, it will take one hit while setting up, which will make it consume its Berry Juice to heal it back up to full HP while gaining a Shell Smash boost. Since Tirtouga has a big weakness to Grass-type moves, it has to be wary of Grass-type coverage on Pokemon such as Abra and Ponyta if its Sturdy is broken. If Tirtouga has set up Shell Smash without losing its Sturdy or its Berry Juice, it can opt to go for a second Shell Smash, as this will usually secure the sweep, since Tirtouga will then outspeed even the fastest Choice Scarf users and be able to OHKO even some of the bulkiest Pokemon in the metagame, such as Foongus. Always make sure priority users such as Timburr and Pawniard are removed before setting up a Shell Smash, as they can relatively easily stop Tirtouga's sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rapid Spin users such as Staryu and Drilbur or Defog users such as Vullaby are mandatory in order to preserve Tirtouga's Sturdy. Drilbur can also help deal with Tirtouga's Electric-type weakness and set up Stealth Rock, which can help Tirtouga secure crucial KOs, while Vullaby can cripple defensive Pokemon by removing their Eviolite with Knock Off. Flying-types such as Doduo, Vullaby, and Rufflet and Fire-types such as Ponyta and Larvesta help break through bulky Grass-types such as Ferroseed and Foongus for Tirtouga. Flying-types also help Tirtouga deal with Fighting-types. Knock Off users synergize very well with Tirtouga, as they can remove Eviolites, which gives Tirtouga an easier time cleaning late-game. In particular, Pawniard can lure in and use Knock Off on Timburr, removing its Eviolite and wearing it down, potentially putting it in Aqua Jet range for Tirtouga, while Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr can lure in and remove Eviolites from Foongus, Cottonee, Mareanie, and Spritzee, allowing Tirtouga to beat them after a Shell Smash boost. Spikes support from Pokemon such as Ferroseed can be useful for Tirtouga, as after three layers of Spikes, Pumpkaboo-XL is OHKOed by Stone Edge after a Shell Smash and a bit of prior damage. Checks to Pawniard like Timburr and Mienfoo greatly aid Tirtouga, as Pawniard is a very big threat thanks to its access to Knock Off to remove Berry Juice and Sucker Punch to pick off a boosted Tirtouga. Pokemon that can deal with other common priority users like Timburr and Croagunk can be very useful—examples include Focus Sash Abra, Mudbray, and Foongus.</p>"

  "Archen": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to a great base 112 Attack and a good base 70 Speed, Archen is a strong offensive Pokemon in Little Cup. Its unique Rock / Flying typing also makes it a good check to Normal- and Flying-types, such as Bunnelby and Rufflet, while also giving STAB to powerful moves such as Stone Edge and Acrobatics. Archen's interesting utility movepool, which includes U-turn, Knock Off, Stealth Rock, Defog, and Roost, also allows it to support its team in various ways.</p> <p>However, Archen has a terrible ability in Defeatist, which halves both its Attack and Special Attack when its HP drops below half. It also suffers from a weakness to Stealth Rock, which makes it even harder to avoid falling into Defeatist range as well as to come in and remove Stealth Rock with Defog.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A defensive set with an Eviolite, an EV spread of 236 HP / 156 Def / 76 SpD / 36 Spe, Stealth Rock or Defog, and Roost can be used to check Flying-types such as Doduo, Rufflet, and Vullaby, but it is easily countered by other common Pokemon such as Pawniard and Chinchou, and Archen's weakness to Stealth Rock means it is easily worn down. Because of this, it will be forced to use Roost very often, making it very passive and exploitable. This set is also unable to utilize Archen's most powerful move, Acrobatics, due to not holding a consumable item. A Choice Scarf set with Rock Slide / Earthquake / U-turn / Knock Off or Switcheroo can also be used. However, since Archen is weak to Stealth Rock and this set has no recovery, it can easily be put into Defeatist range, causing it to be very weak and it will usually be unable to contribute much to its team. Also, similarly to the Eviolite set, a Choice Scarf set is unable to use Acrobatics, since Archen cannot consume its item. An itemless set is another option; such a set gets Acrobatics's higher Base Power immediately, but it struggles to come into play due to a lack of recovery and is unable to utilize Archen's typing, since many Pokemon that Archen can check, such as Flying-types, can 2HKO or 3HKO it, meaning Archen needs an item to prevent it from being put into Defeatist range to easily. Opponents can also see that Archen is not holding an item in Team Preview, meaning they will know that it will immediately have the higher Base Power of Acrobatics. Rock Tomb or Bulldoze can be used to lower a foe's Speed, but the low damage is very noticeable. Tailwind can be used to support Archen's teammates by doubling their Speed for a few turns.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Spritzee, Slowpoke, Mudbray, and Ferroseed can all take most of Archen's moves, though they don't appreciate losing their item because of Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types resist both of Archen's STAB moves, though most of them have to be careful of Earthquake. Bronzor is immune to Earthquake and still resists both of Archen's STAB moves, but it has to be careful of Knock Off. Pawniard can switch into a predicted Defog to get an Attack boost, but non-Eviolite variants are OHKOed by Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Staryu, Chinchou, and Corphish can all threaten Archen with a super effective STAB move. Staryu can also use Rapid Spin to remove Archen's Stealth Rock, and Corphish can OHKO Archen after Stealth Rock with Aqua Jet. Chinchou can take on Archen with its super effective STAB moves, though it has to fear Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster threats such as Abra, Elekid, and Choice Scarf users can outspeed and OHKO Archen or knock it into Defeatist range before taking a hit.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "The Hero": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Acrobatics is Archen's strongest move after Berry Juice is consumed. Rock Slide is Archen's main STAB move while it is still holding Berry Juice and has a nice chance to make the target flinch. Head Smash is an extremely powerful wall-breaking tool and can activate Berry Juice, but should be used carefully as it may bring Archen into Defeatist range after Berry Juice is used up. Stone Edge can be used for its greater Base Power, but the extra damage rarely matters and its unreliability is often an issue. Heat Wave hits Steel-types that resist Archen's STAB moves, OHKOing Berry Juice Ferroseed from full health and 2HKOing Eviolite Pawniard after a layer of Spikes. Earthquake can be used instead, causing Ferroseed to be more troublesome but allowing Archen to OHKO non-Eviolite variants of Pawniard and Chinchou and any Magnemite variant, as well as heavily threatening Mareanie and Eviolite Chinchou. Hidden Power Grass damages Onix, Omanyte, and Tirtouga, which can handle most of Archen's other attacks thanks to their enormous Defense, but Defog can be used if your team needs entry hazard removal. U-turn allows Archen to grab momentum for its team, while Knock Off removes a foe's item and hits certain Pokemon that otherwise wall Archen hard, usually 2HKOing Slowpoke.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Berry Juice can get Archen out of Defeatist range once, and after it is consumed Acrobatics will become much stronger. 196 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Archen to hit 17 Speed, outspeeding threats such as Pawniard and Magnemite and Speed tying with a large portion of Little Cup. 180 Attack EVs allow Archen to hit as hard as possible. The remaining EVs are put into HP to slightly raise Archen's mixed bulk. A Jolly nature is chosen over a Hasty or Naive nature because the reduction in Special Attack does not prevent Archen from obtaining the OHKOs and 2HKOs it needs. Even though Defeatist is terrible, it is Archen's only ability and thus must be used.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to bring Archen in on free switches, such as via a slow Volt Switch or U-turn, so that it won't be forced take a hit and risk going into Defeatist range. This is especially important if it has consumed its Berry Juice already. If Archen is still holding a Berry Juice, it can be switched in to take a hit, consume its Berry Juice, and fire off a powerful move. Depending on which move is chosen, Rock Slide or Stone Edge should be used most often while Archen is still holding its Berry Juice, as Acrobatics will have a meager 55 Base Power. After Berry Juice is consumed, Acrobatics should be used the most often. Be careful of staying in on faster foes, since usually they will be able to knock Archen into Defeatist range before taking a hit, meaning they won't be taking much damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can bring in Archen for free, such as slow Chinchou and Magnemite, are great partners, as they make sure Archen does not fall into Defeatist range. They also both deal with bulky Water-types, most of which can take Archen's hits with relative ease. Entry hazard removers such as Staryu and Vullaby work well with Archen, as Stealth Rock can put it close to or even into Defeatist range quickly. Grass-types such as Foongus and Ferroseed can check Water- and Electric-types, both of which Archen fears. Foongus can also immobilize a foe with Spore, allowing Archen to come in much more easily. Lastly, Fire-types such as Ponyta can take out Ferroseed, which can take any of Archen's moves very well.</p>"
      },
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is an incredible entry hazard, whittling down all of your opponent's Pokemon over time. Rock Slide is Archen's most reliable STAB move and has a nice chance to induce flinch. Acrobatics is Archen's most powerful move after Berry Juice is consumed or removed and is needed in order to deal significant damage. Earthquake hits the Steel-types that resist Rock Slide, meaning the two moves have excellent neutral coverage. Knock Off provides incredible utility in removing a foe's item, crippling defensive Pokemon and Choice Scarf users. Defog can be used over either Stealth Rock or Earthquake in order to remove entry hazards for Archen's team. However, since Archen is weak to Stealth Rock, the damage it takes when it switches in to remove the hazard can put it into Defeatist range very quickly, meaning Archen is not a very good user of the move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Speed EVs with a Jolly nature make Archen as fast as possible, allowing it to maintain hazard control and function as a pivot as well as possible. The HP, Defense, and Special Defense EVs make Archen as bulky as possible. The remaining EVs are put into Attack to raise it by one point. Berry Juice is the item of choice in order to get Archen out of Defeatist range once. Defeatist is Archen's only ability and thus must be used, even though it is terrible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should focus on maintaining hazard control by using its high Speed to repeatedly set up or remove Stealth Rock, depending on whether Stealth Rock or Defog is used. Even though this set does not have a lot of Attack investment, Archen still has a respectable 18 Attack stat, so don't be afraid to fire off attacks. Archen can be switched in on Flying-types such as Doduo and Rufflet and proceed to go for a powerful attack or set up or remove Stealth Rock. Always avoid falling into Defeatist range, as it makes Archen significantly less threatening.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Chinchou is an excellent partner, as it can take the Electric-, Ice-, Water-, and Steel-type moves that Archen fears. In return, Archen switches into Ground-type moves that Chinchou fears. They also form a VoltTurn core together. Pokemon that can deal with Pawniard, such as Mudbray, Timburr, and Diglett, are all good partners for Archen, as Pawniard can come in on a predicted Defog and get an Attack boost. Slow Chinchou, Magnemite, and Foongus all work well with Archen, as they can easily get it in with a free switch, meaning it won't risk falling into Defeatist range before going for a move. Grass-types such as Cottonee and Ferroseed appreciate Archen taking on Bug-, Flying-, and Fire-types. They also check Water- and Electric-types for Archen.</p>"

  "Trubbish": {
    "overview": "<p>Trubbish occupies a niche among entry hazard setters thanks to its ability Sticky Hold combined with its good bulk, defensive typing, and access to Spikes. Sticky Hold allows Trubbish to switch into the very common Knock Off without losing its Berry Juice and works well with Recycle, which lets it capitalize on its bulk and stay healthy while it sets up Spikes. This makes Trubbish a great wall to Fighting-types and the popular Pawniard. Trubbish's high bulk in conjunction with its high Speed enables it to reliably set up Spikes against almost any lead. However, Knock Off still deals extra damage to Trubbish because it is holding an item, giving users of the move a way to exploit its ability. Trubbish also often struggles with spinners, as they can easily remove the Spikes that it sets up, and Staryu and Drilbur in particular can threaten it with their STAB moves. Lastly, Trubbish's Poison typing makes it very vulnerable to the common Diglett.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>On bulkier teams, Trubbish can opt for Toxic Spikes instead of Spikes to let its team stall out foes. Clear Smog is also usable to prevent a foe from setting up on Trubbish and is complemented by Trubbish's high Speed. Rock Blast can be considered as an additional coverage move to deal with the likes of Weak Armor Vullaby and Dwebble, as well as providing a chance to OHKO Abra through Focus Sash. Seed Bomb can be used to hit Staryu, Kabuto, and Drilbur hard, making it harder for them to remove Trubbish's Spikes. In addition, it's Trubbish's best way to hit Onix.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: STAB Earthquake from Pokemon such as Diglett, Onix, and Drilbur easily OHKOes Trubbish. Drain Punch does very little against most of the Ground-type threats in the tier, and while Seed Bomb may be super effective against them, it falls short to Mudbray, which boosts its Defense with Stamina. Drilbur switches in on Trubbish with ease and can set up with Swords Dance after forcing Trubbish out or, more importantly, remove Spikes with Rapid Spin, neutralizing Trubbish entirely without taking much damage in return. Diglett can trap and remove Trubbish, which cannot do much in return.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Many setup sweepers such as Croagunk and Vullaby can set up on Trubbish without taking much damage in return.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Trubbish lacks Dark-type coverage and has a hard time hurting the likes of Gastly. Ghost-types such as Gastly and Pumpkaboo-XL can also cripple Trubbish with Will-O-Wisp, making it even more passive and weak.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removal</strong>: Without a spinblocker on its team, Trubbish fails to deal with many of the Defoggers and Rapid Spin users in the tier, such as Staryu and Vullaby.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Every relevant Psychic-type has a way of dealing with Trubbish. Abra and Slowpoke are not especially affected by Spikes and do not care about Trubbish's high Speed. Abra can easily OHKO Trubbish, while Slowpoke can cripple it with status. As a result, Trubbish usually fails to even lay Spikes against teams with Psychic-types. Furthermore, Staryu can run Psychic to dent Trubbish and can recover health easily with Recover.</p>",

      "Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes allows Trubbish to wear down the opposition, and its good Speed stat combined with its decent bulk allows it to usually set one or two layers easily. Recycle provides a sustainable source of recovery along with Berry Juice. Gunk Shot hits Fairy- and Grass-types, such as Spritzee and Snivy, super effectively. Drain Punch acts as an answer to Steel-, Dark-, and occasionally Rock-types, such as Pawniard and Amaura, and allows Trubbish to further keep itself healthy. Drain Punch also allows Trubbish to act as a Pawniard check when combined with Sticky Hold and its higher Speed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sticky Hold prevents Trubbish's item from being removed by Knock Off in particular. The ability works well with Recycle in letting Trubbish reuse its Berry Juice so that it can stay healthy and lay down Spikes. Maximum Speed EVs allow Trubbish to outspeed and thus check non-Choice Scarf Pawniard. The HP and Defense investment lets Trubbish nearly always take two Knock Offs from Mienfoo and Timburr after Stealth Rock damage. The rest of the EVs are put into Attack and Special Defense to increase both by one point.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Trubbish can switch into Fighting- and Fairy-types relatively safely and provoke a switch. Trubbish should always set Spikes when it forces the foe out; this should be its main priority. It should also be switching into Knock Off as often as possible to allow its teammates to hold on to their important items. When you predict the foe to switch and Trubbish has consumed its Berry Juice, Trubbish should use Recycle so it can come back into the battle when necessary after it switches out. Trubbish struggles against teams with Diglett, which can remove Trubbish from play without much possible counterplay. Against Diglett, you should play Trubbish carefully and switch out if you predict it coming in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Trubbish is a Spikes setter, so it is necessary to pair it with spinblockers such as Pumpkaboo-XL, which also covers Trubbish's weakness to Ground-types. In return, Trubbish checks Dark-types with Drain Punch. Sweepers such as Shellder and Carvanha are able to take advantage of the chip damage from Trubbish's Spikes. Phazers like Munchlax can force a foe out, making the opposition take additional Spikes damage. Dark-type Pokemon like Houndour appreciate a check to Fighting-types, while Trubbish enjoys the coverage that Dark-types provide against Psychic-types. Pawniard is a great teammate in particular, as it serves as a Defog deterrent, allowing Spikes to stay up for longer. Stealth Rock setters such as Pawniard and Onix can stack entry hazards alongside Trubbish.</p>"

  "Zorua": {
    "overview": "<p>Zorua's signature ability Illusion gives it a decent and unique niche in Little Cup. Zorua's main function is to trick opponents into thinking they're using super effective moves when really they are merely attacking a disguised Zorua. Its relatively high Attack and Special Attack stats help Zorua score a surprise KO. It also has a great Speed tier at 17, Speed tying with Snivy, Drilbur, and Mienfoo. Zorua has access to some great moves, such as U-turn, STAB Knock Off, and Nasty Plot. However, Zorua's paper-thin defenses and relatively poor defensive typing leave it vulnerable to priority and any super effective moves aimed its way. Its fairly narrow movepool also leaves it completely walled by common Fairy-types, namely Spritzee and Snubbull. Finally, Zorua has a weakness to the common Fighting-types and U-turn users of Little Cup.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A fully physical Swords Dance set with Sucker Punch and Knock Off could work, but Pawniard runs such a set better due to its higher Attack and Steel secondary typing. Agility can be used to boost Zorua's Speed, but Zorua's raw power isn't very good for sweeping without boosts. Taunt is an option, but not many Pokemon are fazed by this, and Zorua is too frail to utilize it well. A Choice Scarf set with Trick could surprise some Pokemon, but after using Trick Zorua can't do very much. Memento can be used to assist a sweeper, but Cottonee and Diglett use it much better due to their Prankster and high Speed, respectively. Psychium Z can be used for a chance to OHKO Snubbull, but it doesn't do much more than that. Pursuit can trap Psychic- and Ghost-types, but Alolan Grimer does this job better, as it has better bulk, a better Attack stat, and a good secondary typing. Berry Juice and Eviolite can both make Zorua easier to disguise and bulkier, but non-Life Orb sets miss out on some key KOs, particularly on Mienfoo.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Zorua can do essentially nothing against Fairy-types like Spritzee, Snubbull, and Cottonee, and almost all can KO it with Fairy-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Although Zorua can deal with most Fighting-types using Extrasensory, many, like Timburr and Mienfoo, are bulky enough to survive an unboosted Extrasensory and can retaliate with a Drain Punch. Many also carry Fighting-type priority, such as Croagunk's Vacuum Wave or and Timburr's Mach Punch, meaning they can hit Zorua hard before it can KO them.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Entry hazards and other chip damage can reveal Zorua and make it hard to properly use Illusion. For example, if Zorua has switched into Stealth Rock more times than a teammate, your opponent can tell if Zorua is disguised as said Pokemon by its different HP.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Staryu, Doduo, and Ponyta can easily shut Zorua down by revenge killing it or simply switching in on a setup move.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Vullaby, Pawniard, and Alolan Grimer resist Zorua's STAB moves and are immune to Extrasensory, and many can either set up on Zorua or merely hit it with a powerful attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Night Daze is Zorua's primary STAB option and has the added bonus of having a high chance to drop a foe's accuracy. However, it is notable that using it reveals Zorua for what it is. Dark Pulse is a great alternative to Night Daze with 100% accuracy and a flinch chance, but it has slightly less power. This choice is mostly up to preference, though. Extrasensory is a powerful Psychic-type move that lets Zorua hit Fighting-types, such as Mienfoo and Croagunk, and Poison-types, such as Foongus and Mareanie. Nasty Plot allows Zorua to set up its Special Attack and potentially even sweep. U-turn is a great option to let Zorua pivot, and its immense prevalence makes it easy to bluff being another Pokemon early on. Hidden Power Fighting can be used to hit Steel- and Dark-types, primarily Pawniard and Scraggy, if you don't want to use U-turn. Knock Off can be used as an alternative to Nasty Plot or U-turn to cripple foes, and it also has the added bonus of being very common, making it another good move to use to bluff being another Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>196 Special Attack EVs and a Life Orb are used to maximize Zorua's damage output, which lets it OHKO Pawniard with Hidden Power Fighting and have a chance to OHKO Mienfoo with Extrasensory. 236 Speed EVs as well as either a Timid or a Naive nature are used to help Zorua outspeed as many Pokemon as possible, particularly Pawniard. Choosing between Timid and Naive is mainly up to if you would like to maximize Knock Off and U-turn damage or be slightly more bulky. The rest of Zorua's EVs are put into its defenses to make its bulk a bit better. Illusion makes opponents see Zorua as another Pokemon on its team until it is hit.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Deciding upon your team order is very important with Zorua, due to its unique ability. The Pokemon put in the last slot should usually be a Poison- or Fighting-type if your opponent has a Psychic-type such as Abra, as Zorua can bait the Psychic-type moves that it is immune to and hit back with a powerful Dark-type move. Your last Pokemon in other situations should be a Pokemon weak to attacks that Zorua resists, namely Psychic- and Ghost-type moves. Illusion also lets Zorua force switches by disguising itself as Timburr against a Pawniard, for example, allowing it to safely set up Nasty Plot. It can also be good to disguise Zorua as a Pokemon that uses the same moves as it, such as Nasty Plot Croagunk, U-turn Mienfoo, or Knock Off Timburr. If utilizing Nasty Plot, it is always a good idea to remove Zorua's checks and counters before attempting to sweep, as Fighting-types, faster Pokemon, and Fairy-types in particular can be troublesome. Keep careful watch on your team's HP, as Zorua's HP can reveal its disguise to opponents who pay close attention, and as such, try to keep Zorua's HP as close to the Pokemon it's disguised as as possible. Also be wary of switching into Stealth Rock when disguised as a Pokemon weak or resistant to it, as the damage Zorua takes will reveal it to observant opponents. Because of its frailty, Zorua should only be brought in on safe switches or via U-turn or Volt Switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting- and Poison-types, such as Mienfoo, Foongus, and Croagunk, can bait Psychic-types in quite well. Similarly, Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Gastly, Pumpkaboo-XL, and Abra can bait in Ghost-types. Fairy-type checks, such as Pawniard and Foongus, are important to keep Zorua safe from its biggest threats. Hazard removers, such as Staryu, Drilbur, and Kabuto, are also important, as they keep Zorua from taking chip damage and potentially revealing itself. Vullaby in particular can also partially check Fighting-types for Zorua and commonly runs Dark Pulse, U-turn, Knock Off, and Nasty Plot, all moves Zorua uses that can therefore help convince opponents Zorua is Vullaby. U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Mienfoo, Vullaby, and Chinchou can help safely get Zorua in. The first also makes it easier for Zorua to disguise itself. Similarly, Knock Off users such as Mienfoo, Timburr, Pawniard, Vullaby, and Scraggy can all make it easier for Zorua to disguise itself.</p>"

  "Minccino": {
    "overview": "<p>Minccino is a potent threat capable of breaking through weakened foes. Due to the way LC damage rolls work, the combination of Tail Slap and Skill Link allows it to do a lot of damage. An excellent Speed tier of 18 also allows it to outspeed Mienfoo, Vullaby, and Onix. However, it is outsped by Abra and Ponyta and only Speed ties with Gastly. Its Normal typing is unremarkable other than its weakness to the common Fighting-types that dominate LC. Furthermore, its poor defensive stats allow it to be OHKOed by a wide variety of foes, such as Abra and Mienfoo. Lastly, while it has a good range of coverage options, such as Knock Off and Seed Bomb, its low Attack stat means that other than Tail Slap, its moves are relatively weak.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Scarf set can be run to outspeed most of the metagame. However, this will reduce Minccino's Tail Slap damage significantly and prevent it from using its coverage moves, making it easier to check. King's Rock can be used to give Tail Slap a good chance of causing a flinch, but this reduces the power of Tail Slap. Aqua Tail can be used to hit Fire-, Rock-, and Ground-types, punishing potential switch-ins. However, Seed Bomb is more useful in general, as it hits Tirtouga very hard. Protect can be run to prevent chip damage from Fake Out and to scout Choice Scarf users. Substitute can be used to get around Foongus's Spore and Pawniard's Sucker Punch. Gunk Shot can be run to OHKO offensive Berry Juice Spritzee.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ferroseed</strong>: Ferroseed is able to switch into a Tail Slap and deal over half damage with Iron Barbs. It can then cripple Minccino with Thunder Wave or deal damage with Bullet Seed. It should be wary of Wake-Up Slap, however.</p> <p><strong>Mudbray</strong>: Mudbray's Stamina ability allows it to take a Tail Slap and reach +5 Defense, after which it can KO Minccino in return. However, it should be wary of switching into a Seed Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Flame Body Users</strong>: Flame Body users, such as Ponyta and Larvesta, can switch into a Tail Slap and have an 85% chance to burn Minccino. Ponyta can then outspeed Minccino and OHKO it with Flare Blitz.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Timburr's Mach Punch, Pawniard's Sucker Punch, and Croagunk's Vacuum Wave all do heavy damage to Minccino. However, Timburr and Croagunk should avoid switching into a Tail Slap, and Pawniard should be wary of Wake-Up Slap.</p> <p><strong>Faster Foes</strong>: Threats such as Abra and Ponyta can outspeed Minccino and KO it. Ponyta can also switch into Minccino and then outspeed it.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Common Choice Scarf users such as Mienfoo and Pawniard can outspeed Minccino and KO it.</p> <p><strong>Diglett</strong>: Diglett can trap and outspeed Minccino and KO it with Life Orb-boosted Earthquake or Tectonic Rage.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Tail Slap is a powerful STAB move that does significant damage to anything that does not resist it due to LC damage mechanics. For example, it 2HKOes Spritzee, Foongus, and Vullaby. Knock Off allows Minccino to hit Ghost-types and remove the foe's item to help itself or a teammate. Seed Bomb can be run to hit Rock-types such as Onix and Tirtouga. U-turn can give Minccino a way out of unfavorable matchups or as a way of gaining offensive momentum. Wake-Up Slap gives Minccino a way to hit Steel-types, such as Pawniard and Ferroseed, super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Minccino's Speed is maximized to allow it to outspeed Mienfoo and Onix while Speed tying with Gastly and Doduo. Life Orb is used as its item to massively increase the damage output of Tail Slap. The remaining EVs are invested in Defense and Special Defense to boost both its defenses by as much as possible, which slightly increases its longevity. Skill Link is used to force Tail Slap to always hit five times, giving it more consistent damage output than Technician would.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Minccino generally works best as an early-game breaker, dealing heavy damage to defensive foes to allow a partner to clean. Due to its poor defensive stats, Minccino should not be switched directly into an attack; instead, use a pivoting move such as Mienfoo's U-turn or Magnemite's Volt Switch to bring it in. Minccino can also be used to force out Weak Armor Vullaby, Eviolite Snivy, and Onix with any chip damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard setters such as Ferroseed work very well with Minccino, since a layer of Spikes and Stealth Rock can provide enough chip damage on defensive foes for Minccino to OHKO them. Mienfoo, Vullaby, and Magnemite all work well with Minccino by using Volt Switch and U-turn to get it in without taking damage. Diglett and Magnemite can help Minccino to clean by trapping common Steel-types such as Pawniard, Ferroseed, and Magnemite, while Minccino can weaken defensive Pokemon down to a point where they can be trapped. Fighting-type checks such as Spritzee and Foongus give Minccino a way out of a Fighting-type matchup. Switch-ins to Steel- and Rock-types such as Mienfoo are helpful, since Minccino struggles to OHKO most of them and many of them will KO in return. Minccino pairs well with Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr, since it can do heavy damage to their checks such as Spritzee and Foongus, allowing them to clean.</p>"

  "Solosis": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Solosis is almost completely overshadowed by Abra as an offensive Psychic-type, it finds a small niche for itself on dedicated Trick Room teams as an offensive Trick Room setter due to its horrendous Speed and huge Special Attack stat, tying with Abra for the highest Special Attack stat in the tier. Solosis is also blessed with an excellent ability in Magic Guard, which allows it to avoid all passive damage, and has access to Thunder, which lets it nail Vullaby for much higher damage than other Psychic-types are able to. However, Trick Room teams aren't particularly reliable or consistent in Little Cup, and Solosis's middling bulk and mediocre defensive typing mean it may struggle to justify use on Trick Room teams over alternate setters like Spritzee. In addition, Solosis's overreliance on Trick Room being active to sweep makes it almost useless outside of Trick Room teams due to its lacking Speed. Most teams should use Abra for their wallbreaking needs.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Regenerator, especially if coupled with an Eviolite, can be an option to heal off damage by pivoting in and out of opposing foes such as Croagunk and make Solosis a more reliable Trick Room setter, though it is generally less useful than the more offensive Magic Guard set. Overcoat allows Solosis to switch into Foongus's Spore with ease and threaten it with a powerful Psychic or set up Trick Room in its face, although it is generally significantly worse than Solosis's other abilities. Solosis has numerous utility options in its movepool, such as Substitute, Recover, and Thunder Wave, although it would rather not waste turns while Trick Room is active, and a defensive set would be outclassed by more effective walls such as Slowpoke and Spritzee. Shadow Ball may be used as coverage against opposing Psychic-types, although it is very hard to fit and hits few targets because defensive Psychic-types are not prevalent, and Thunder hits Slowpoke for high damage already.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stalling Out Trick Room Turns</strong>: Pokemon such as Mienfoo and Ferroseed are able to stall out Trick Room turns by virtue of Fake Out and Protect. This makes Solosis very vulnerable to faster threats once it expires.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-type Pokemon such as Pawniard and Stunky are immune to Solosis's Psychic-type STAB moves and can threaten it with Sucker Punch if Trick Room is activated or Knock Off if not while also trapping Solosis with Pursuit. However, Dark-types must be wary of switching into either Hidden Power Fighting or Gigavolt Havoc, both of which do significant damage.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferroseed and Magnemite both resist Psychic and can wear Solosis down with Bullet Seed and Volt Switch. However, they are hit super effectively by Hidden Power Fighting.</p>",

      "Offensive Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room is the only reason to use Solosis, so it is mandatory. When Trick Room is active, Solosis is capable of underspeeding nearly the entirety of Little Cup. Thunder allows Solosis to heavily damage or OHKO Vullaby as well as Water-types such as Slowpoke and Staryu so long as it does not miss. Hidden Power Fighting rounds out Solosis's coverage, allowing it to deal notable damage to Steel-types and in particular OHKO Pawniard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With a Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs, Solosis is able to underspeed every Pokemon in Little Cup barring a few rare Trick Room Pokemon like Munchlax, while its Special Attack EVs are maximized to increase its damage output. Electrium Z grants a perfectly accurate Electric-type nuke that lets Solosis bypass its biggest would-be counter in Vullaby while also minimizing Knock Off's damage. If a Z-Crystal is already being used on the team, a Life Orb is an effective alternative that offers more consistent damage output, although Thunder's low accuracy can be problematic. Focus Sash is an option that lets Solosis set up Trick Room incredibly consistently but greatly reduces its ability to sweep or break holes in the opponent's team, as Solosis is still susceptible to priority moves in Trick Room. Magic Guard is the preferred ability due to it allowing Solosis to avoid damage from entry hazards, status, and Life Orb recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Solosis should always prioritize setting Trick Room before starting to break through the opponent's team. Solosis should ideally avoid switching directly into attacks so that it has enough HP to set up Trick Room, since it is rather frail. Instead, it should come in after a teammate faints or through the help of a pivot. Steel- and Dark-types should be weakened or KOed before Solosis attempts to sweep if at all possible, since at high HP, they can prevent Solosis from sweeping.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Solosis appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon like Pawniard and Ferroseed, as entry hazards help it secure KOs on Pokemon like Vullaby. Supporting Trick Room setters like Spritzee and Pumpkaboo help alleviate pressure from Solosis and allow Trick Room to be activated more consistently for both Solosis and the rest of the team. Slow wallbreakers that can take advantage of Trick Room, including Cranidos and Clamperl, appreciate Trick Room support from Solosis. Fighting-types such as Timburr can dispose of Steel- and Dark-types that trouble Solosis and appreciate Solosis being able to lure Vullaby and Slowpoke with Gigavolt Havoc. Mienfoo also provides a slow U-turn to help Solosis get in safely. Finally, Magnet Pull Magnemite can trap and eliminate Steel-types like Pawniard and Ferroseed for Solosis.</p>"

However, Deerling's defensive typing is horrible in Little Cup, leaving it with many weaknesses to common types, notably Fighting-, Flying-, and Poison-types. This is coupled with rather poor defensive stats, meaning it can be easily KOed by even neutral attacks. Finally, even with a Life Orb, Deerling's attacks aren't really very powerful, so common bulky Pokemon like Vullaby, Ferroseed, and Mienfoo can easily wall it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Deerling can effectively run a paraflinch set with Serene Grace, Thunder Wave, and Headbutt, although it is luck based and fairly weak. A Flyinium Z set with Bounce can deal heavy damage to incoming Fighting-types, but it lacks the overall power granted by Life Orb and is typically unideal. Feint Attack is an option to hit most Ghost-types harder, although Wild Charge tends to be sufficient, as Gastly is the most common target. Aromatherapy can cure teammates of their status conditions, but Deerling isn't suited to a defensive role, nor can its moveset afford it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Abra, Ponyta, Gastly, and Ice Beam Staryu can all easily revenge kill Deerling. Gastly has the added bonus of easily switching into Deerling's common attacks. Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Rufflet, Mienfoo, and Pawniard can also easily dispose of Deerling and usually can switch into at least one of Deerling's attacks comfortably.</p> <p><strong>Vullaby</strong>: Vullaby is able to easily handle Deerling with any of its common sets. Weak Armor variants can switch into Deerling rather easily and gain a Speed boost to better deal with it, while Eviolite + Roost sets can easily stomach anything other than Wild Charge. Choice Scarf sets are also troubling, but they struggle to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Poison-types</strong>: Foongus, Alolan Grimer, and Mareanie all have the bulk to easily switch into Deerling and KO it. Foongus and Mareanie easily stay sufficiently healthy with Regenerator and recovery moves, while Alolan Grimer can Pursuit trap Deerling and quickly remove it from the match.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Mienfoo, Timburr, and Croagunk have the bulk to switch into Deerling's attacks. Mienfoo's Fake Out is an issue for Deerling, while Timburr's Mach Punch will easily KO even a healthy Deerling. Croagunk's Vacuum Wave is also troublesome, though Croagunk will take a large amount of damage if it switches into Return or Double Edge.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is a powerful STAB move and hits most Pokemon for neutral damage. Double-Edge can also be used for some extra power, but the recoil can be quite troublesome in combination with Life Orb. Seed Bomb is Deerling's other STAB attack and can hit the Rock-types that resist Return super effectively, with Onix and Tirtouga being the most common. Jump Kick hits Steel-types such as Pawniard and Ferroseed, which shrug off Deerling's STAB moves. Substitute allows Deerling to protect itself on forced switches and avoid revenge killers. Wild Charge can be used to hit Vullaby and Rufflet for acceptable damage and deal a large amount to Gastly as it switches in, but this will greatly reduce Deerling's longevity.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sap Sipper allows Deerling to be an offensive check to Grass-types, especially Snivy. Deerling's Speed stat is maximized in order to allow it to effectively check Snivy and Onix. 196 Attack EVs and a Life Orb supplement its Attack stat without Sap Sipper boosts. The rest of its EVs are poured into its Defense and HP to help it survive attacks such as Mudbray's Heavy Slam and Onix's Rock Blast, although it is still quite frail.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When trying to take advantage of Sap Sipper, be very careful, as nearly every relevant Grass-type has a way of crippling Deerling. Ferroseed has Thunder Wave, Foongus has Sludge Bomb, and Snivy has Hidden Power Ice and Glare. Deerling should primarily be used as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker, dealing heavy damage to foes so its teammates can clean up later. Additionally, it should not be switched in directly in most cases, as it is incredibly frail. Instead, bring it in via a slow Volt Switch or U-turn user such as Chinchou or Mienfoo. Substitute should be employed chiefly to either avoid Pawniard's Sucker Punch or predict a switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Deerling fits very well on Sticky Web teams, as it can check Snivy while also being able to keep an offensive presence. Pokemon that can set entry hazards can break opposing Sturdy users, and many common Stealth Rock setters such as Onix, Pawniard, and Tirtouga can also check Flying-types. Additionally, Kabuto, Staryu, and Vullaby can remove entry hazards for Deerling to stop it from being whittled down easily. Water-types like Corphish and Tirtouga can bait in Grass-types, which Deerling can take care of if it predicts correctly, as well as take care of Fire-types. Mienfoo, Vullaby, and Magnemite are all good pivots to pair with Deerling, as getting it in while taking minimum damage is important. Offensive checks to Fighting-types, such as Abra and Vullaby, can remove Fighting-types for Deerling, while Mudbray can remove Fire- and Poison-types.</p>"

  "Karrablast": {
    "overview": "<p>Karrablast has an interesting niche in the LC metagame due to its great Attack, a great ability in No Guard, and the highly powerful Megahorn, which make it a powerful physical attacker that never misses. Karrablast's moderate defenses grant it at least enough bulk to tank most priority and weak neutral attacks, although it is let down by its Bug typing, which has many weaknesses, especially to Stealth Rock, making it easy to target. Karrablast's coverage moves aren't good either, as they are underwhelming and weak, leaving it only with its Bug-type STAB move to deal damage, which isn't really good offensively either.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swords Dance Karrablast is an alternative option for a more offensive approach; +2 Attack Megahorn is very frightening and can hit even resisted Pokemon devastatingly, making Karrablast insanely hard to switch into. However, Karrablast's Speed makes it outsped quite easily, and it can be KOed easily as well due to common checks that can prevent Karrablast from setting up safely. An Eviolite set focusing more on bulk can be run, although it will get outsped by almost all of its checks and will lose a significant portion of its bulk straight off the bat if it is hit by Knock Off. Aerial Ace can be used as an alternative coverage option that can hit Fighting-type Pokemon on the switch. Life Orb can be used instead of Choice Scarf to instantly hit harder, although Karrablast gets outsped easily, and its frailness doesn't contribute to the fact that it gets KOed quite easily. Return or Double-Edge can do powerful neutral damage, but it provides no super effective coverage and is difficult to fit in a moveslot due to the important need for a coverage move. Shed Skin and Swarm can be used instead to remove status or boost Megahorn, respectively. However, No Guard is absolutely better than these two abilities, as it is one of the crucial parts that make up Karrablast's niche, since it allows Karrablast to have perfect accuracy, especially with Megahorn, which is much more important than status recovery and last-minute boosts.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bug-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that resist Karrablast's main and most powerful move can wall it most of the time at full health, since Karrablast's coverage moves are rather underwhelming even if they do hit super effectively; these Pokemon that resist Megahorn can proceed to wall Karrablast and either weaken or KO it if it doesn't switch out. Pokemon that can resist Megahorn include Fighting-types such as Mienfoo, Fairy-types such as Spritzee, Steel-types such as Pawniard, Fire-types such as Larvesta, and Flying-types such as Vullaby. Additionally, some of these Pokemon can also use Karrablast as setup bait if they take advantage of their resistance to Bug.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-type Pokemon such as Onix, Tirtouga, and Omanyte can take on everything Karrablast has to offer except for Drill Run and can take it out easily with a super effective Rock-type STAB move. They can also set up Stealth Rock before Karrablast switches in to inflict decent residual damage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Choice Scarf Users</strong>: As Karrablast is a rather slow Choice Scarf user, faster ones such as Doduo and Gastly can outspeed it and attack it with powerful moves, which either heavily damage or KO it, preventing Karrablast from revenge killing efficiently. Choice Scarf Vullaby and Rufflet, which are bulkier than the two previously mentioned Pokemon, can also take on Karrablast with ease by outspeeding Karrablast, resisting Karrablast's moves, and later taking it out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Megahorn is Karrablast's most powerful STAB move and is highly spammable with perfect accuracy, which is Karrablast's main niche, hitting Pokemon that are neutral against it like a truck. Knock Off allows Karrablast to remove opposing Eviolites to lower the opposing Pokemon's bulk, which makes them more susceptible to Megahorn afterwards. It also allows Karrablast to hit Ghost-types such as Gastly on the switch and is Karrablast's best option against Flying-types. Drill Run can be used to hit Steel- and Rock-types on the switch, as they would typically switch into a resisted Megahorn, although Karrablast will most likely only be able to 2HKO them. Poison Jab surprises Fairy-types that try to switch into a resisted Megahorn, as they would force out Karrablast otherwise; however, aside from Fairy-types, Poison Jab deals little damage to other Pokemon. Pursuit is an alternative option that can be used to trap Psychic-types such as Abra if Karrablast switches into them, which can provide decent utility for Karrablast's teammates, although Pursuit is generally more niche and the coverage Poison Jab provides, even though it only hits one significant type effectively, will be more useful in certain situations.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Attack and Speed investment alongside a Jolly nature allows Karrablast to hit like a truck and outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and other Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Mudbray, which makes it a feared Choice Scarf user alongside its ability and movepool. The Defense EVs allow Karrablast to tank physical attacks more comfortably, which allows it to switch into resisted physical attacks more often. Instead of a Jolly nature, Karrablast can run an Adamant nature to hit harder, although this allows Pokemon with 21 Speed such as Choice Scarf Mudbray, to Speed tie with Karrablast.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Karrablast can be used to revenge kill slower Choice Scarf users, weakened Pokemon, and Pokemon weak to Bug, as it can take them all out with Megahorn or its other moves. Additionally, revenge killing is made much more reliable thanks to No Guard. Karrablast should use Knock Off early-game to weaken opposing Eviolite users so Karrablast or its teammates can take care of them more easily later. Karrablast forces a lot of switches thanks to its powerful Megahorn, so it should be used to force out Pokemon that are weak to it or are physically weak, which gives Karrablast a good opportunity to use Knock Off to remove Eviolites on the switch, although Karrablast should often switch out after using Knock Off. After Pokemon that resist Megahorn and check Karrablast are eliminated, Karrablast can spam Megahorn to sweep late-game. Faster Choice Scarf users can pick Karrablast off quite easily, and some of them are reliable checks to Karrablast as well, so it is also wise to eliminate them from the battle first before Karrablast starts sweeping. Karrablast should try to avoid being setup bait once locked into a move that the opposing Pokemon resists. Due to Karrablast's mediocre defenses, it should stay away from powerful neutral and super effective attacks. If Karrablast runs Pursuit, it should use Pursuit if it can KO the opposing Pokemon or deal significant damage to it if you expect it to switch out, which can help out your teammates and possibly ruin the opposing team's momentum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Karrablast appreciates teammates such as Onix, Elekid, and Amaura because they can help it take out Flying-types such as Vullaby and Doduo, which can easily check Karrablast. Furthermore, Rock-types can set up Stealth Rock to aid Karrablast's sweeping. Teammates such as Timburr, Pumpkaboo-XL, and Staryu can help Karrablast deal with Rock-types, which can take all of Karrablast's moves bar Drill Run. Staryu can also help Karrablast by removing Stealth Rock planted by the opposing Rock-types. Karrablast appreciates teammates like Abra, Spritzee, and Vullaby because even though Karrablast resists Fighting, the very common Fighting-types such as Timburr and Mienfoo can still take it out regardless. Karrablast benefits from the company of Mienfoo, Ponyta, and Diglett because they can help remove opposing Steel-types from the battle, which can tank all of Karrablast's moves excluding Drill Run and take it out. Alolan Grimer and Pawniard are good teammates for Karrablast because they can take out the pesky Fairy-types that can wall Megahorn and all of Karrablast's other moves except for Poison Jab. Additionally, they provide beneficial Pursuit trapping. Spinners and Defog users such as Staryu and Vullaby are essential teammates due to Karrablast's weakness to Stealth Rock, which chips a lot of its health. Archen in particular is a great teammate to have due to its ability to check Flying-types and some Fighting-types and set up or remove entry hazards.</p>"

  "Foongus": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its great defensive typing, Foongus makes for an excellent answer to many of the metagame's top threats, such as Timburr, Snivy, and Chinchou, being able to nullify them for the entire match thanks to its great longevity with Regenerator and Giga Drain. Once in play, Foongus can turn out to be quite a nuisance with its supportive movepool, which most notably contains Spore, and decent offensive presence. However, its only decent defensive stats leave it somewhat vulnerable to lures.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ground OHKOes Magnemite if Sturdy is broken, but Hidden Power Fire or Fighting is usually enough. Stun Spore can most notably cripple Fire- and Flying-types looking to switch in after one of their teammates has been put to sleep, but Foongus already hits them hard with Sludge Bomb. Energy Ball is stronger than Giga Drain, but the extra healing Giga Drain offers is usually more useful. A combination of Venoshock and Toxic or Toxic Spikes support is not usually worth the effort, as Foongus does not have the Speed or Special Attack to sweep. Foongus has a good typing and access to Rain Dance, allowing it to fit onto rain teams easily. A fully physical set is not recommended, as Sludge Bomb is generally too good to pass up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Defensive RestTalk Users</strong>: Munchlax and Skrelp are two common RestTalk users that do not mind Spore and can completely wall Foongus's relatively weak attacks. If Foongus stays in, they can PP stall Foongus by simply not using Sleep Talk when they are asleep.</p> <p><strong>Poison- and Steel-types</strong>: Poison- and Steel-types such as Pawniard, Magnemite, Ferroseed, Alolan Grimer, and Croagunk resist or are immune to Foongus's STAB moves. Ferroseed in particular is also immune to Spore. However, they are heavily damaged by the appropriate Hidden Power.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-, Fire-, Ice-, and Flying-types</strong>: Once Spore has been used, Psychic-, Fire-, Ice-, and Flying-types, which hit Foongus super effectively, can attempt to switch in. However, they may not enjoy being poisoned by Sludge Bomb; frailer Pokemon may even be outright KOed by it. In particular, Overcoat Vullaby is bulky enough to withstand Sludge Bomb and is immune to Spore, though it dislikes Sludge Bomb's chance to poison.</p> <p><strong>Bulletproof</strong>: Chespin and Jangmo-o are immune to Sludge Bomb thanks to Bulletproof and resist Giga Drain; Chespin is also immune to Spore. However, Clear Smog prevents them from attempting to set up with their free turns, and if Chespin does not run Zen Headbutt, it actually risks losing once Synthesis runs out of PP. In addition, neither is considered to be competitively viable.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spore is almost guaranteed to temporarily eliminate an enemy Pokemon from the match. Sludge Bomb is a fairly threatening STAB move with a handy chance to poison, notably heavily damaging Fairy-types. Giga Drain further increases Foongus's longevity and hits Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types hard. Synthesis grants Foongus absurd amounts of staying power against anything that doesn't hit it super effectively, and allows it to win most Foongus mirrors. Hidden Powers can prevent Foongus from being walled by certain Steel-types; Hidden Power Fire 2HKOes Ferroseed, a notable switchin to Spore, while Hidden Power Fighting hits Pawniard hard. Clear Smog deters various setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Scraggy and Bulk Up Timburr from boosting. Hidden Power Psychic can also be used to surprise Croagunk.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs and nature grant Foongus solid 25 / 21 / 21 bulk after Eviolite; 14 Defense and Special Defense let Foongus gain an extra point from Eviolite. Regenerator is what gives Foongus its niche, making it extremely difficult to wear down. Eviolite is used over other defensive items like Berry Juice because Foongus has access to recovery already with Regenerator. An EV spread of 44 HP / 160 Def / 80 SpA / 160 SpD can also be used, as it still allows Foongus to heal 8 HP with Regenerator and gives it a decent chance to OHKO Doduo with Sludge Bomb after Stealth Rock damage. If Clear Smog is run and the IVs are not reduced by Hidden Power, you can include an extra Speed point as well with a spread of 44 HP / 156 Def / 76 SpA / 156 SpD / 76 Spe.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to use Spore on something important. If Foongus is within KO range of a +1 Knock Off from Dragon Dance Scraggy, it may be worth sacrificing Foongus by continuing to use Clear Smog so that Scraggy does not come out of the bout with a Speed boost, unless you have means to deal with a boosted Scraggy. If the opponent has a Vullaby not yet on the field and you're not sure if it has Overcoat, which blocks Spore, Sludge Bomb is the safest move to use, as Vullaby does not appreciate being poisoned; however, if your team is about to be swept by a +2 Nasty Plot or Z-Mirror Move Vullaby, you can sacrifice Foongus by repeatedly using Clear Smog instead. If the opponent allows Staryu to be put to sleep with Spore, there is a good chance that they plan to immediately switch Staryu out afterwards to activate Natural Cure, so using Spore again is an option. If Doduo or Houndour directly switches into Spore, chances are it has Early Bird as its ability, so Foongus should immediately switch out to your check afterward. If a bulky Pokemon such as Skrelp, Munchlax, or Mudbray switches into Spore, it might be a RestTalk variant.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Though it can fit into offensive teams as well, Foongus is a staple on bulkier teams for its defensive utility and ability to absorb Toxic Spikes while not being weak to Diglett. Due to its typing, Foongus synergizes well with a huge number of other defensive Pokemon, such as Chinchou, Munchlax, Ponyta, and Staryu; they are bulky Pokemon that appreciate Foongus handling some of their checks, while Foongus also likes them dealing with its checks. Foongus can be paired with Slowpoke and Mienfoo to form a Regenerator core that can be incredibly difficult for unprepared teams to break.</p>"

  "Frillish": {
    "overview": "<p>Frillish's access to Water Spout and Trick enables it to utilize a Choice Scarf to either deal significant damage before taking a hit or cripple a defensive switch-in. Furthermore, great coverage in Ice Beam and Energy Ball allows Frillish to surprise its checks and counters. Frillish is also able to spinblock and can counter the most common spinner in LC, Staryu. It can use Will-O-Wisp to cripple physical attackers and Recover to stay healthy throughout the match so it can keep spinblocking. However, Knock Off's prevalence in LC makes it harder for Frillish to check certain Pokemon, especially Fighting-types, which usually carry this move. Additionally, Dark-types such as Vullaby and Scraggy are able to set up on Frillish. It also faces competition from Pumpkaboo-XL as a spinblocker and Staryu as a fast offensive Water-type; however, Scald gives Frillish a niche over the former, and Water Spout gives it a niche over the latter.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs can be used over Choice Scarf to do more damage, but Frillish does not have the speed to effectively sweep teams, so Choice Scarf tends to be better. Dazzling Gleam is an option to hit Scraggy, Vullaby, and other Dark-types that could switch in or try to set up on Frillish. Psychic can be used to deal with Croagunk, which would otherwise absorb Frillish's Water-type attacks. Taunt can be used to deal with hazard setters and status moves, but Frillish is usually too slow to use Taunt effectively. Toxic can be used to try to outstall bulky Pokemon such as Munchlax, but it tends to be worse than Will-O-Wisp. Trick Room can be used by Frillish on Trick Room teams, but Pumpkaboo-XL and Spritzee are considered better setters. An offensive Berry Juice set can be used as a spinblocker on Sticky Web teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Elekid, Chinchou, and Magnemite can all force Frillish out, but they can sometimes have a hard time switching into attacks. Chinchou is bulky enough to take a Shadow Ball or Energy Ball, and since it resists Water-type moves, it can use Thunderbolt or Volt Switch on Frillish, which usually KOes it.</p> <p><strong>Munchlax</strong>: Munchlax is a huge threat to Frillish, as it can PP stall it with its large bulk and its RestTalk set, which can heal away the burns, or Pursuit trap Frillish and deal a lot of damage to it. However, the Berry Juice + Recycle set has trouble with Frillish.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types resist Water Spout and can hit Frillish for super effective damage. Ferroseed can set up entry hazards, which Frillish does not appreciate. Cottonee can use Taunt or Encore on the defensive set, which can force it out.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Pawniard, Doduo, and Mienfoo can all outspeed Frillish and KO it with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types in general can check or counter Frillish fairly well, as most are able to KO it with STAB Dark-type moves or set up on it. Scraggy and Vullaby are both able to set up on Frillish, and Pawniard, Stunky, and Alolan Grimer can Pursuit trap it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Frillish's main attack and is very useful for checking physical attackers that switch into Frillish. It can also hit Fire-types that attempt to predict Will-O-Wisp and is generally a useful move that can spread burns throughout the enemy team. Shadow Ball provides good STAB coverage and enables Frillish to hit Pokemon that resist Scald such as Slowpoke. Hex can be used over Shadow Ball if there is a lot of status on your team, and Frillish has Will-O-Wisp and Scald to help boost it. Recover is used to stay healthy throughout the game and allows Frillish to take multiple hits. Will-O-Wisp enables Frillish to cripple physical attackers while also whittling down their health slowly.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread and nature allow Frillish to hit 21 Defense and 24 Special Defense. This spread allows it to take two Wild Charges from Ponyta and two Thunderbolts from non-Life Orb Staryu. The rest of the EVs are put into Special Attack to help deal more damage. Water Absorb is considered the better ability, as it allows Frillish to get free recovery when it switches into Water-type attacks. It also plays mind games with the opponent and forces them to choose whether or not they should use a Water-type move. Cursed Body is also a good ability because most Pokemon only carry one coverage move that 2HKO Frillish, and Cursed Body can disable that move, making it hard to KO Frillish. However, its low activation rate can make it unreliable at times.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Frillish is able to counter Normal-, Fire-, and Ground-types such as Bunnelby, Larvesta, and Drilbur. Be careful trying to check Fighting-types, as many carry Knock Off, which can hurt Frillish a lot. It is usually better to use Frillish as a check as opposed to a counter, as it usually does not appreciate taking hits, but it can force out most Pokemon. Try to use Scald as often as possible, as it is able to burn checks to Frillish. Frillish can counter non-Thunderbolt Staryu, which is the most common spinner in LC. Frillish can also try to predict a Water-type move to get free recovery.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Chinchou is a major problem for Frillish, so Diglett is a good partner because it is able to trap and KO Chinchou. Grass-types such as Cottonee and Foongus are also able to deal with Chinchou. Chinchou is also a good check for itself, as it can absorb Electric-type attacks from Pokemon that check Frillish, such as Magnemite and Thunderbolt Staryu, and resist Water-type attacks. Frillish does not appreciate taking Knock Off's Off, so teammates that can take Knock Off well, such as Mienfoo and Trubbish, are good. Dark-types threaten Frillish, so Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr are good partners. Entry hazard setters such as Dwebble, Omanyte, Ferroseed, and Onix all appreciate Frillish, as it is able to spinblock. Hex Gastly can be a good partner, as Frillish is able to spread burns and weaken opposing Pokemon, and Gastly can clean up with Hex. Overcoat Vullaby works well because it can counter Foongus and force a lot of switches to take advantage of Frillish keeping up hazards.</p>"

Shadow Ball allows Frillish to deal neutral damage to most Pokemon, giving it a safe option. It also allows Frillish to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types that can threaten it, such as Honedge, Gastly, and Abra. Hydro Pump is another safe option when Frillish is at low health, and Frillish does not mind losing Shadow Ball because it does not hit many Pokemon super effectively. Ice Beam is able to hit Grass-types that resist Water Spout, such as Pumpkaboo-XL, Snivy, and Foongus. Energy Ball is able to hit Water-types that resist Water Spout such as Chinchou and Staryu. Trick lets Frillish cripple walls that enjoy switching into it, such as Munchlax, Foongus, and Spritzee.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Running 196 Speed EVs allows Frillish to reach 14 Speed and outspeed the entire unboosted metagame with a Choice Scarf equipped. 236 Special Attack EVs maximize Frillish's damage, and the rest of the EVs are put into HP to increase longevity. Water Absorb allows Frillish to switch into Water-type attacks for free and can also help Water Spout do more damage by restoring HP.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Frillish can help break holes into the opposing team to allow for its teammates to clean up. Frillish can also clean up opposing teams once its checks and counters have been weakened a bit thanks to its Choice Scarf. Make sure to play around the opponent's hazard setter if they have one because hazards make Water Spout weaker. Frillish can spinblock, but it can lose a good amount of HP if it switches into an attack, which will make Water Spout weaker. Try to not directly switch into any attacks, as that will weaken Water Spout's damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defog and Rapid Spin are necessary, as Water Spout is weakened by hazard damage. Vullaby and Staryu are both good options. Chinchou is a major problem for Frillish, so Diglett is a good partner, as it is able to trap and KO Chinchou. Grass-types such as Cottonee and Foongus are also able to deal with Chinchou. Frillish does not appreciate taking Knock Off, so teammates that can take Knock Off well, such as Mienfoo and Trubbish, are good. Dark-types threaten Frillish, so Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr are good partners. Entry hazard setters such as Dwebble, Omanyte, Ferroseed, and Onix all appreciate Frillish, as it is able to spinblock, which prevents the foe from spinning away hazards. Slow pivots such as Mienfoo and Chinchou can bring Frillish in without taking any damage, which allows it to fire off powerful Water Spouts.</p>"

Additionally, its learnset includes both Spikes and Stealth Rock, making it one of LC's best entry hazard stackers. Ferroseed's ability, Iron Barbs, works well with its role as a wall, wearing foes down and discouraging them from making contact. However, Ferroseed has several downsides that limit its potential. While its typing grants it many resistances, its typing also gives it a weakness to the incredibly common Fighting-types like Mienfoo and Timburr, along with a 4x weakness to Fire, which leaves it vulnerable to any Pokemon with Fire-type coverage, such as Ponyta and Pumpkaboo-XL. Additionally, it has rather underwhelming offenses and a low Speed stat, so it is forced to primarily rely on its support moves to contribute to the battle, making it setup bait for Pokemon like Scraggy. The prevalence of Knock Off means that Ferroseed can easily lose its Eviolite or Berry Juice, limiting its defensive capabilities. Ferroseed also lacks a recovery move aside from Rest, so it gets gradually worn down throughout the battle.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Leech Seed is a mediocre option that provides Ferroseed and its teammates with recovery, although, most of the time, it does not restore enough HP to be worthwhile, because level 5 Pokemon have very low HP stats. Seed Bomb is more reliable than Bullet Seed and deals with Mudbray more effectively, but generally it should not be used, because it often deals less damage and can't break through Sturdy or Focus Sashes. Toxic can wear down bulkier foes, but it is usually less useful than Ferroseed's other utility options. Explosion could be used to deal a considerable amount of damage once Ferroseed has finished performing its role in the battle, but it deals little damage with Ferroseed's low Attack stat, so the other move options are usually more useful. A RestTalk set gives Ferroseed a method of recovery, which works well with its great defenses, and with Curse, it can also act as a decent wincon. However, its weakness to Fighting and 4x weakness to Fire make it difficult to set up successfully. It also lacks important moves like Thunder Wave, which leaves it as setup bait.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-type Moves</strong>: Ferroseed's typing gives it a 4x weakness to Fire, which allows almost any Pokemon with access to a Fire-type move to easily break through its defenses. This means Pokemon like Ponyta, Pumpkaboo-XL, and Larvesta are very large threats. Additionally, special attackers that Ferroseed usually walls like Snivy sometimes carry Hidden Power Fire so they can break through Ferroseed.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon</strong>: Fighting-types like Timburr and Mienfoo can deal a lot of damage to Ferroseed with their strong super effective STAB attacks. Timburr is especially notable because it can receive an Attack boost from Thunder Wave via Guts.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Pokemon with access to Taunt such as Cottonee can prevent Ferroseed from using the majority of its moves. This is incredibly problematic for Ferroseed because it predominantly relies on its status moves to contribute to the battle.</p> <p><strong>Mudbray</strong>: Mudbray's ability Stamina means that it gains multiple Defense boosts when it is hit by Ferroseed's Bullet Seed. This means it can switch in and become a problem very quickly. It is also immune to Thunder Wave and can hit Ferroseed super effectively with Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Pawniard</strong>: Pawniard threatens Ferroseed with Knock Off, resists Bullet Seed, can set up on Ferroseed, and isn't greatly affected by Thunder Wave because of its access to Sucker Punch.</p>",

      "Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bullet Seed is the chosen STAB move because, due to mechanics at level 5, it tends to deal more damage than Seed Bomb. It also has the benefit of breaking through Onix and Tirtouga's Sturdy and Abra's Focus Sash. Knock Off can remove the Eviolite from foes like Vullaby, the Berry Juice from Pokemon like Dwebble, and the Choice Scarf from Pokemon like Pawniard to make them easier to KO. Thunder Wave can cripple a faster foe's Speed stat, which can allow Ferroseed's teammates to outpace it. This is especially useful versus setup sweepers, as it can prevent them from being able to successfully sweep. Stealth Rock and Spikes both provide chip damage that wears down the opposing team and punishes the opponent for switching. They also break Sturdy and Focus Sashes. Iron Head can be utilized to allow Ferroseed to hit Fairy-types super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite can be used to improve Ferroseed's defenses to maximize its durability and reduce damage from all attacks. For instance, it allows Ferroseed to survive two Earthquakes from Mudbray. Berry Juice is an alternative that provides Ferroseed with recovery, although it means it will take more damage from attacks. The EV spread and nature focus on increasing Ferroseed's bulk and maximize the boosts from Eviolite. The EVs invested into Special Defense allow Eviolite Ferroseed to survive three Ice Beams from Staryu and a Heat Wave from unboosted Nasty Plot Vullaby. The remaining EVs are dumped into Attack, to boost Bullet Seed damage, and Speed. Iron Barbs works well in conjunction with Ferroseed's role as a wall, as it provides chip damage that gradually wears down Ferroseed's foes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is very important for Ferroseed to avoid Fire- and Fighting-type attacks—most notably Fire, because of Ferroseed's 4x weakness. Ferroseed should switch in on Pokemon that it can wall for a safe opportunity to set up entry hazards, deal damage, paralyze a predicted switch-in, or remove a predicted switch-in's item. Examples of Pokemon Ferroseed can wall include Staryu, Spritzee, and Snivy. Thunder Wave should be used against faster foes so that Ferroseed's teammates can outspeed and KO them with ease. However, Ferroseed should be careful when using Thunder Wave if the opponent has Timburr, as it could switch in and receive an Attack boost from Guts. Bullet Seed should be used to whittle down frail Pokemon or Pokemon that are weak to Grass. If Ferroseed can wall the opponent's wincon, you should make sure Ferroseed is safe throughout the battle so that it can come in late-game to stop the sweep with Thunder Wave or Bullet Seed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fairy-types like Spritzee and Snubbull are arguably Ferroseed's best teammate options thanks to their fantastic defensive synergy with Ferroseed. Ferroseed can take on the Poison- and Steel-types that threaten Fairy-types, while they can take on the Fighting-types that trouble Ferroseed. Spritzee is especially notable because it can use Wish to restore Ferroseed's HP. Both Ferroseed and Fairy-types struggle versus Fire-types, however. Other Pokemon that can deal with Fighting-types are good partners too, such as Foongus and Mudbray. A switch-in for Fire-types is almost essential on a team with Ferroseed. This makes Chinchou and Slowpoke good options because they can pivot in and out with ease. Diglett is a nice option thanks to its ability to trap and remove Fire-types for Ferroseed. Mareanie is a great partner, as it can deal with Fire- and Fighting-types for Ferroseed. Mareanie also has access to Toxic Spikes, so together they form an effective entry hazard stacking core. Fire-types such as Ponyta work nicely with Ferroseed because Ferroseed can deal with the Water- and Ground-types that threaten Fire-types with their super effective STAB moves. Offensive Pokemon that benefit from Knock Off and hazard support, like Abra and Carvanha, are also good teammate options. Ferroseed appreciates having a spinblocker like Frillish or Pumpkaboo-XL on the team so that its hazards can remain on the field for as long as possible. Likewise, Pawniard is a good partner thanks to its ability Defiant, which discourages the opponent from using Defog. Slower Pokemon that appreciate speed control, such as Dewpider and Mudbray, can be supported by Ferroseed via Thunder Wave.</p>"

  "Klink": {
    "overview": "<p>Klink's access to Shift Gear, which raises Speed by 2 stages and Attack by 1 stage, and Gear Grind, which gives Klink a way to break through Sturdy and Focus Sash and deal good damage, allows it to function as a good late-game sweeper. Its nice bulk backed up by a Steel typing allows it to resist Stealth Rock and nine other types as well as take a lot of attacks, making it easy to set up Shift Gear. However, Klink has a terrible movepool that leaves it walled by many common Pokemon such as Pawniard, Magnemite, and Mudbray. It has common weaknesses in Fighting, Fire, and Ground. In addition, it faces severe competition with other sweepers such as Scraggy, Corphish, and Vullaby and has trouble finding a niche in teams. It’s slow before a Shift Gear boost, leaving it easily hit by Taunt. Even after a Shift Gear, Klink’s subpar Attack doesn't make it particularly powerful, meaning that multiple boosts are required to significantly damage teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rock Smash allows Klink to better hit Steel-types, but it's very weak unless boosted several times. If Rock Smash is being used, Fightinium Z can be held to deal a ton of damage to Munchlax and Ferroseed; however, it takes up a Z-Move slot, and the lack of bulk from Eviolite will make it harder to set up Shift Gear. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple opposing threats, but this doesn't fit well on a setup sweeper like Klink. Magnet Rise gives Klink an immunity to Ground-type attacks for five turns, but it loses out on coverage. Volt Switch could be run to gain momentum for your team, but it's weak because of Klink's lower Special Attack and removes any Shift Gear boosts.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Ponyta and Larvesta resist Gear Grind and can OHKO with Flare Blitz or weaken Klink by burning with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Timburr, Scraggy, and Croagunk are bulky enough to take a +1 Gear Grind and can KO Klink using Drain Punch, recovering HP at the same time.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Drilbur and Diglett have a good chance of OHKOing Klink but cannot switch in on anything but Wild Charge. Hippopotas doesn't take much damage from Klink's attacks and can set up Stealth Rock or KO with Earthquake. Mudbray can gain two Stamina boosts from Gear Grind and hit back with an Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Pawniard and Magnemite do not take much damage from any of Klink's attacks and can retaliate with their respective STAB attacks. Ferroseed walls all of Klink's attacks and can set up entry hazards on it.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Munchlax, defensive Chinchou, and Pumpkaboo-XL don't take much damage from any of Klink's attacks; Pumpkaboo-XL and Chinchou can burn Klink with Will-O-Wisp or Scald, while Munchlax can phaze it with Whirlwind. Alternatively, they can KO Klink with their coverage moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shift Gear": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shift Gear doubles Klink's Speed and raises Attack by 1 stage so that it can start a sweep. Gear Grind is Klink's strongest STAB attack, hits Fairy-, Rock-, and Ice-type Pokemon super effectively, and at +1 OHKOes Spritzee, Cottonee, and Eviolite Snubbull. It's also a two-hit attack, so it can break through Sturdy, Focus Sash, and Substitute users, OHKOing Abra as well as Onix and Dwebble if they've already consumed their Berry Juice. Wild Charge is used to hit Water- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Staryu, Vullaby, and Mareanie super effectively and hit Steel-types the hardest, as they resist both Gear Grind and Return. Return is Klink's best way to hit Pokemon that resist Gear Grind but aren't weak to Wild Charge, such as Chinchou, Larvesta, and Ponyta.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>116 Speed EVs are used for Klink to hit 22 Speed after a Shift Gear boost, outspeeding any Pokemon that doesn't have a Choice Scarf or Speed boost. 236 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature maximize Klink's Attack as well as guarantee an OHKO on Spritzee with Gear Grind at +1. The remaining EVs are put into Defense and Special Defense to reach stat numbers that maximize Klink's Eviolite-boosted bulk, making it easier for Klink to set up. Lastly, Clear Body prevents any stat drops from the likes of Sticky Web and Snubbull's Intimidate.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Klink should only start setting up Shift Gear when its counters are weakened or KOed. Knock Off support from teammates removes Eviolite from many Pokemon, which makes it a lot easier for Klink to start sweeping. Beware of setting up against Cottonee, as it can Encore Klink into Shift Gear, as well as Foongus, since it carries Spore. Klink can set up on defensive Pokemon or Pokemon that can't do much damage to it such as Spritzee and Snover.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Klink appreciates entry hazard support from Dwebble or Ferroseed so that it nets KOs more easily, such as getting the OHKO on non-Eviolite Mienfoo at +1. Knock Off support from Timburr, Pawniard, and Mienfoo removes Eviolites, giving Klink an easier time sweeping. Pumpkaboo-XL, Spritzee, and Vullaby can switch in on the Fighting-types that give Klink some trouble. Grass- and Flying-types such as Cottonee, Snivy, and Rufflet can switch in on Ground-types and KO them. Water- and Rock-types like Staryu, Onix, Tirtouga, and Slowpoke counter Fire-types that threaten Klink, but Onix and Tirtouga have to be wary of Will-O-Wisp. Dewpider resists all three of Klink's weaknesses, while Klink can take care of the Flying- and Rock-type Pokemon Dewpider is weak to. Memento users like Cottonee and Diglett can allow Klink to set up a lot more easily. Diglett makes for an especially good partner because it can trap a lot of Pokemon that Klink has a hard time with, like Pawniard, Magnemite, Chinchou, and Ponyta.</p>"

Possessing a weakness to Knock Off and Sucker Punch is detrimental for Elgyem, especially compared to Spritzee’s resistance to Dark, and having to resort to Hidden Power to hit said Dark-types diminishes Elgyem’s offensive presence. Becoming Pursuit trapped by Pokemon such as Alolan Grimer is also annoying for Elgyem. Even Solosis, although it's not viable either, is better than Elgyem in performing this role due to Magic Guard and a higher Special Attack stat. While Elgyem is a better check to Abra than Spritzee and Analytic is quite a useful ability to for it to have, its ability works against itself under Trick Room, and Elgyem's strengths pale in comparison to the overwhelming number of advantages Spritzee has over it as an offensive Trick Room setter.</p>",

  "Axew": {
    "overview": "<p>With a high base Attack, decent Speed, and access to Dragon Dance, Axew is able to sweep teams once given the chance to set up. Unfortunately, it struggles against Fairy- and Steel-types when locked into Outrage, though they're vulnerable to Axew's coverage moves. Due to Axew's lack of bulk, powerful offensive Pokemon such as Mienfoo and Vullaby make it hard for it to set up. Because of these factors, even at +1 Axew is often unable to sweep until late-game after the opposing team has been weakened.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf is an option, since it makes Axew a immediate threat and capable of revenge killing. However, this set lacks sweeping capabilities because Axew is locked into one move. Using Life Orb will increase Axew's Attack, but it will chip away at Axew's health in the process, making Axew quite frail on top of losing Eviolite. Dragon Claw is an option because it has a Base Power of 80 and no drawbacks. However, unfortunately even at +3 Axew can't OHKO Mienfoo. Facade can let Axew potentially set up on Ponyta and Scald users such as Chinchou. Taunt can let Axew set up on Foongus, not allowing it to use Spore. Focus Sash is another option, allowing Axew to survive a super effective hit and set up with Dragon Dance. Substitute is also an option, since it helps Axew avoid status; unfortunately, it makes Axew lose out on important coverage. Lum Berry can get around status, and if Axew lasts long enough, it can also cure Axew from Outrage confusion, but this will leave Axew very frail. Steelium Z allows for Axew to OHKO Spritzee at +1, Cottonee at +0, and Snubbull at +1 and never misses. The loss of Eviolite's bulk can be troublesome, however.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Spritzee and Snubbull are immune to Axew's Dragon-type moves and can easily take a Superpower. However, they have to be careful of Iron Tail or Poison Jab.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Axew suffers greatly to Sucker Punch Pokemon like Pawniard, which can be an issue. Croagunk's Vacuum Wave and Zigzagoon's Extreme Speed are threatening as well.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Axew's only move to go up against Steel-types is Superpower, and Superpower will decreases Axew's Attack and Defense by 1.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves</strong>: There are a lot of Pokemon with good Ice-type coverage moves. Offensive Staryu can 2HKO Axew with Ice Beam, and bulky Water-types such as Chinchou have access to Ice Beam as well.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Axew doesn't like being burned, paralyzed, or poisoned, since burn halves Axew's Attack, paralysis lowers its Speed, and poison chips away at its health, completely stopping Axew from sweeping effectively.</p>",

      "Dragon Dance Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance gives Axew the power and speed needed to get through walls and revenge killers, and after two to three boosts it will turn Axew into a fast physical sweeper. Outrage is a powerful Dragon-type STAB move, and at +1 it has a chance to OHKO Vullaby after Stealth Rock, as well as a guaranteed 2HKO on Timburr after Stealth Rock. Dual Chop is an option over Outrage if you don't wish to be locked into a move, and is a great way to get past Focus Sash users. It should be noted, however, that Dual Chop is rather weak even at +1 and requires multiple boosts to break bulkier threats like Vullaby. Superpower is a reliable way to take on Steel-types, especially Pawniard and Magnemite, which are both guaranteed to be OHKOed. Iron Tail is used against Fairy-types. It will always 2HKO Spritzee after Stealth Rock has been set up, OHKOes Cottonee at +1, and has a chance to OHKO Snubbull at +1 after Stealth Rock. The only downside about Iron Tail is its low accuracy. Poison Jab is a more reliable alternative, that has a guaranteed 2HKO on Snubbull at +1 after Stealth Rock and also OHKOes Cottonee.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Axew lacks in both Defense and Special Defense; Eviolite is needed to raise Axew's bulk, allowing Axew to survive a High Jump Kick from Choice Scarf Mienfoo and a Dazzling Gleam from non-Life Orb Abra. The EV spread is pretty standard for a sweeper. Maximized EVs in Attack and Speed allow Axew to hit as hard as possible and outpace the likes of Corphish and Magnemite. After a boost from Dragon Dance, Axew's power increases. A +1 Jolly Axew can outspeed some Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Scraggy and Magnemite. Alternatively Adamant will increase Axew's Attack and can let it OHKO Pokemon such as Omanyte, which Jolly Axew can only 2HKO, but Axew will still be vulnerable to a few Choice Scarf users such as Rufflet (which can outspeed it) and Timid Magnemite (which Speed ties). Mold Breaker is used to bypass defensive abilities like Sturdy and Solid Rock, giving Axew an easier time cleaning up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Axew is best used as a late-game sweeper when its checks have been weakened or removed. Using Superpower too much may prevent Axew from sweeping effectively, as Axew sorely needs its Attack boosts to have a reasonable shot at OHKOing enemies. Dragon Dance should only be used when Axew has an opening to set up or when there's a chance Axew will be able to take a hit. Examples of Pokemon that can be set up on by Axew would be Stunky and Lileep. Also, if Axew is locked into Outrage against something that resists it such as a Steel-type, Axew won't be able to do much damage and is prone to being counterattacked. When a Fairy-type is switched in to nullify Outrage, Axew will be able to use Iron Tail after Outrage has been blocked. However, if a Fairy-type comes in for a revenge kill, they're still able to get a free hit on Axew. Superpower can be used to hit a predicted Steel-type switch-in, and Poison Jab can be used to hit Fairy switch-ins. Axew should also be wary of priority on the opponent's team when attempting a sweep and has to look out for super effective coverage from Pokemon like Staryu and Timburr.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Diglett is an exceptional partner for Axew because its ability Arena Trap allows it to trap Steel-types and OHKO them with Earthquake. Axew benefits from having entry hazards up because they punish switching and aid Axew in sweeping. Good examples of hazard setters are Drilbur and Pawniard. Drilbur is also great for handling Steel-types, while Pawniard is good for threatening Fairy-types. Axew also benefits from Knock Off users, which are able to remove Eviolite and thus allowing Axew to sweep better. A good example of Knock Off user is Alolan Grimer. In addition to Knock Off support, Cottonee and Stunky can provide Axew with Memento support. Ice-types are really troublesome for Axew, so having a Pokemon that can go up against them is really important. Good examples of Pokemon that check Ice-types are Ponyta and Slowpoke. Bulky Pokemon are great teammates as well because Axew lacks bulk. Example of bulky pokemon that can support Axew include Chinchou to handle Ice-type moves and Mareanie or Foongus to handle Fairy-types. Mudbray and Onix are also great Ground-types to handle opposing Steel-types. Fighting-types such as Timburr and Mienfoo are major threats to Steel-types as well.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Cubchoo's ability Slush Rush along with its decent offensive stats allows it to be a potent hail sweeper. Cubchoo also has access to Water-type coverage to check Fire-types, which are generally quite threatening to hail teams. However, Cubchoo faces competition from Alolan Sandshrew, which has the same ability along with Rapid Spin and a secondary Steel typing. This leads to Cubchoo being a niche pick for hail teams at best. In addition, its weak STAB attack means it often underperforms despite its high Attack stat. Cubchoo's poor defensive typing and bad defensive stats also leave it weak to many common threats in LC, such as Ponyta and Mienfoo, as well as common priority moves like Timburr's Mach Punch. This bad bulk, coupled with a weakness to Stealth Rock, means it struggles to find opportunities to switch in. Finally, Cubchoo is absolutely useless outside of hail due to its poor Speed stat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A special-oriented set with Blizzard is an option, but Cubchoo is lacking in special coverage, and this set is even weaker when the hail is gone. Blizzard can also be used on the main set, replacing Surf; however, this means Cubchoo no longer has any way of dealing with opposing Fire-types. Life Orb can be used to boost Cubchoo's damage output, but the recoil and lack of recovery makes Cubchoo easier to KO outside of hail. Life Orb also makes it even weaker to priority moves, allowing it to be easy prey for revenge killers. Power-Up Punch and Hone Claws provide Cubchoo with a way to boost its Attack stat, making it easier to sweep. However, the former is really weak compared to Superpower, and Cubchoo is usually too frail to set up. Night Slash allows Cubchoo to hit Frillish but offers no utility otherwise. Finally, Cubchoo has some interesting support options such as Yawn and Encore, but it lacks the bulk needed to utilize them effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Pokemon that are physically bulky such as Alolan Grimer and Timburr can take pretty much any of Cubchoo's attacks and stall it out.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Many Steel-type Pokemon in Little Cup such as Magnemite and Ferroseed are very bulky and can take any of Cubchoo's attacks besides Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Hippopotas</strong>: Hippopotas removes hail, potentially stopping Cubchoo's sweep, but it cannot switch into Ice Punch.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Being a mono-Ice-type Pokemon, Cubchoo is weak to common priority moves such as Timburr's Mach Punch and Croagunk's Vacuum Wave.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Mareanie and Slowpoke can take just about anything Cubchoo throws at them, while Shellder, Omanyte, and Tirtouga can use it as setup fodder. The latter two should be wary of Superpower, however.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock takes away 25% of Cubchoo's health, allowing it to be OHKOed by attacks it would normally survive, such as Mienfoo's Drain Punch.</p>",

      "Hail Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Punch is the only physical STAB Cubchoo has access to, but it still hits relatively hard, dealing super effective damage to common Pokemon like Vullaby and Diglett. Superpower hits incredibly hard and breaks down Rock- and Steel-types that can cause trouble for hail, such as Omanyte and Ferroseed. Play Rough deals with Mienfoo and other Fighting-types that can also be troublesome for hail teams. Surf, while a bit weak compared to the other moves, lets Cubchoo check Fire-type threats such as Torchic and Ponyta, which are all 2HKOed after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread lets Cubchoo hit as hard as possible while letting it outspeed Choice Scarf Mienfoo under hail. The remaining EVs power up Surf and make Cubchoo a bit bulkier. A Naughty nature leaves it vulnerable to special attacks but lets Cubchoo hit harder with its physical attacks. However, a Naive nature can be used to outspeed Choice Scarf Chinchou and other fast Pokemon under hail. Slush Rush is the ability of choice here, as it doubles Cubchoo's Speed and lets it effectively sweep in hail. Eviolite enables Cubchoo to take a hit despite its mediocre bulk, letting it attack safely; for example, it has a high chance of surviving a STAB Drain Punch from Mienfoo. Berry Juice is another option to keep Cubchoo healthy and usually ensures it cannot be 2HKOed, for example, from Timburr's Mach Punch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Only send out Cubchoo when hail has been set up, as it's virtually useless otherwise. Since Cubchoo has so few opportunities to switch in, try and sweep late-game when all of its counters are gone or weakened. Cubchoo should use Surf if you think your opponent is going to switch into a Fire-type; this will cripple it, allowing Cubchoo to outspeed it and grab a KO. Cubchoo is still very frail even with Eviolite, so bring it in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch from Mienfoo or Magnemite to avoid taking prior damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hail setters are essential for Cubchoo to sweep, so having one on your team is a must. Alolan Vulpix in particular has access to Aurora Veil, which makes Cubchoo harder to KO. Electric-types like Chinchou and Magnemite can take care of bulky Water-types that Cubchoo struggles against and bring it in safely with a slow Volt Switch. Abra, Vullaby, and Snubbull, among other Fighting checks, can get rid of the Fighting-types that threaten Cubchoo. Mienfoo, Timburr, and other wallbreakers weaken physical walls such as Onix and Dwebble, letting Cubchoo deal with them easier. Drilbur receives a special mention, since it can also remove Stealth Rock, which Cubchoo is weak to. Staryu and Vullaby can also remove entry hazards, giving Cubchoo an easier time switching in. Vullaby is also immune to hail damage thanks to Overcoat. Entry hazard support from the likes of Ferroseed helps to break down bulky Pokemon such as Mareanie that Cubchoo struggles against. Finally, Fighting- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Mienfoo and Diglett can provide a secondary check to Rock- and Steel-types. Diglett is notable for being able to trap and remove these threats, but keep in mind that hail will break its Focus Sash.</p>"

  "Mienfoo": {
    "overview": "<p>Mienfoo has a variety of traits that make it one of the best all-around Pokemon in the metagame. Mienfoo's most common role is that of a pivot, using its good natural bulk, access to utility moves such as Knock Off and U-turn, and Regenerator ability to take a wide range of hits and then bring in a teammate, granting its team momentum instantly while gaining a third of its HP back just by pivoting out. However, Mienfoo is not limited to functioning as a bulky pivot, as it is also able to invest in its Attack and don a Choice Scarf to function as a threatening cleaner in the late-game. In short, Mienfoo's longevity thanks to Regenerator, ability to pivot and support its teammates with U-turn and Knock Off, good stat distribution, and wide support and coverage movepool make it an excellent choice on many teams. Mienfoo's only downside is its own popularity; despite its ability to perform many roles, Mienfoo is pretty consistently defeated by the same Pokemon, including Spritzee, Mareanie, and Foongus, which tend to be quite common because of how prevalent it is.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Feint is an option to give Mienfoo a more reliable form of priority, but it is extremely weak. Poisonium Z with Poison Jab can be used to give Mienfoo a high-power Z-Move to lure in opposing Fairy-types, but similarly to the Flyinium Z set, it also comes at the cost of the bulk that Eviolite provides. Choice Band is an option to dramatically increase Mienfoo's power, notably allowing it to OHKO Berry Juice Vullaby from full at the cost of bulk and the ability to switch moves. Life Orb is another acceptable option for fast offensive sets, but similarly takes away from Mienfoo's mix of offensive capabilities and bulk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types, especially Snubbull and Spritzee, wall Mienfoo completely unless it is running Poison Jab, which still doesn't do a lot of damage. Cottonee is also difficult to deal with but is much more susceptible to Poison Jab.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-type Pokemon, including Foongus and Mareanie, take very little damage from Mienfoo's attacks and can take advantage of the free turns Mienfoo gives them to set up entry hazards or spread status. However, none of them particularly like being hit by Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types do significant damage to Mienfoo, although they fear switching into it. Vullaby checks Mienfoo fairly well due to Weak Armor, which allows it to outspeed Mienfoo after switching in and deal significant damage, and Rufflet and Doduo check it offensively, although Rufflet needs a Choice Scarf to outspeed Mienfoo.</p> <p><strong>Flame Body</strong>: Ponyta and Larvesta make it costly for Mienfoo to spam Knock Off and U-turn as consistently as it would like, as they can switch in and potentially cripple it with a burn; however, both fear Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Abra</strong>: Abra is one of the best offensive checks to Mienfoo, although the bulkier sets can take a Psychic from the Focus Sash Abra set. Abra also must be wary of being surprised by a Choice Scarf Mienfoo variant, which can outspeed and U-turn out of it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>High Jump Kick is the preferred STAB move to grant Mienfoo a great deal of immediate power. U-turn turns Mienfoo into a stellar pivot, giving it the ability to gain momentum for its team just by switching out of a check. It also works well with Regenerator to keep Mienfoo healthy throughout a match. Knock Off allows Mienfoo to support itself and its team by removing items such as Eviolite and Berry Juice from foes to allow them to be more easily defeated. Mienfoo's final moveslot is less crucial to its success as a pivot, so the move choice can be tailored to support its team. Fake Out is Mienfoo's best 4th move option, allowing Mienfoo to get in chip damage notably against Weak Armor Vullaby, and scout for certain set variants based on how much damage Fake Out does. Mienfoo can also run Acrobatics to hit opposing Fighting-types and Foongus for super effective damage, which is made more effective by how often it is used as a Knock Off absorber during a match, meaning it frequently gets the damage boost. Poison Jab is an option to hit Fairy-types such as Spritzee and Snubbull super effectively. Taunt can be used to shut down slower hazard leads, to block Foongus' Spore, or to prevent Foongus or Mareanie from recovering HP.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread allows Mienfoo to hit 17 Speed and Eviolite numbers, outspeeding a decent majority of the metagame, notably Pawniard and Vullaby, and turning it into a better revenge killer and a slightly better switch-in to several key Pokemon such as Pawniard. An offensive spread of 236 Atk / 36 Def / 236 Spe with a Jolly nature significantly boosts the power of Mienfoo's High Jump Kick, notably allowing it to OHKO Vullaby after Stealth Rock damage. However, the given sets' Speed comes at the cost of special bulk and the ability to act as a slow pivot. An alternative spread of 76 HP / 196 Def / 196 SpD with an Impish nature is designed to take a variety of hits and keep its health up throughout a match. This gives it the ability to take a wide range of hits when holding an Eviolite such as Vullaby's Brave Bird, Focus Sash Abra's Psychic, and +2 Shellder's Icicle Spear after Stealth Rock. The lack of Speed investments would give Mienfoo 13 Speed, which is slower than a large portion of the metagame. This allows Mienfoo to take a hit before using U-turn to safely bring in a frailer ally.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Mienfoo set should be used as a pivot or a scout, coming in on resisted or weaker neutral hits throughout a battle and pivoting out when its health gets low. Regenerator comes in handy in doing this, as Mienfoo can regain health when it needs to just by coming out of battle. When Mienfoo is in battle, it should use Knock Off as much as possible to wear down the opposing Pokemon and remove items, especially to wear down Mienfoo's checks. Once it needs to recover health, or if a check is predicted to be coming into battle, Mienfoo can use U-turn to switch out while gaining momentum for its team. Its relatively slow U-turn is useful for bringing in frail allies as well. Be careful against opposing Flame Body users such as Ponyta and Larvesta, however, as Mienfoo relies on contact moves, which these Pokemon can come in on and potentially cripple Mienfoo with a burn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mienfoo is weak to Flying-types, so good partners include Onix, Pawniard and Magnemite. The latter also forms a powerful VoltTurn core with Mienfoo, which can give a team offensive momentum. Checks to Fairy-types are also important when using Mienfoo, as they are its most threatening switch-ins and Poison Jab doesn't do significant damage to them. Foongus switches into most Fairy-types and forms a potent Regenerator core with Mienfoo, and Steel-types such as Pawniard and Magnemite can deal with Fairy-types offensively. Finally, frail attackers such as Abra and Gastly appreciate Mienfoo's slow U-turn, as it can bring them in safely, and they can force many of Mienfoo's checks out of battle.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>High Jump Kick is Mienfoo's primary STAB move and does enormous damage to anything that doesn't resist it. U-turn allows Mienfoo to pivot and scout the opponent's team while dealing chip damage early in a game in order to weaken foes. Knock Off can soften up switch-ins by removing their items, allowing Mienfoo to do more damage later, and also hits Ghost-types like Gastly and Pumpkaboo, which deter Mienfoo from using High Jump Kick. Drain Punch and Brick Break are options in the final slot as a STAB move that can be more safely spammed in situations where a High Jump Kick miss would be especially costly; Drain Punch is preferable on Reckless sets to give Mienfoo more survivability, while Regenerator sets already have good survivability, making Brick Break's ability to remove Aurora Veil more useful. Stone Edge is an alternative that hits Flame Body users such as Ponyta that aim to come in on Mienfoo. Finally, Poison Jab can be used as a way for Mienfoo to hit Fairy-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With maximum Speed investment and a Choice Scarf, Mienfoo hits 25 Speed, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and serve as a good revenge killer. This pairs well with maximum Attack investment, which allows Mienfoo to hit as hard as possible. An Adamant nature can be used to allow Mienfoo to hit harder, but without the Speed investment Mienfoo will fail to outspeed a few key threats, such as Choice Scarf Pawniard, Choice Scarf Rufflet, and Carvanha after a Speed boost. Reckless boosts the power of High Jump Kick significantly, but it costs Mienfoo the longevity provided by Regenerator. Regenerator is a useful ability that allows Mienfoo to take weak hits and priority moves early on in a match and recover its health as it switches out, and can help make up for the damage taken from a High Jump Kick miss.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>In the early-game, Mienfoo should use Knock Off and U-turn to weaken foes and bring in checks. As the pivot set is far more common, Mienfoo can often bluff not having a Choice Scarf, which can be used to lure in Pokemon that aim to revenge kill Mienfoo. After foes have been worn down, High Jump Kick should be spammed because it hits extremely hard. However, care should be taken to remove opposing Ghost-types beforehand, as they can hurt Mienfoo significantly by coming in on High Jump Kick. Because Choice Scarf locks Mienfoo into a single move, be careful about picking a move that turns it into setup bait, and keep in mind that Mienfoo can always use U-turn if becoming locked into a single move is an issue. However, in most late-game scenarios, if opposing Ghost-types have been eliminated, locking Mienfoo into High Jump Kick has very few downsides.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Mienfoo set pairs well with other VoltTurn users, which can use slow pivoting moves to bring it in safely without it taking damage and work together with Mienfoo to give a team momentum. Examples of good partners that can do this include Magnemite and Vullaby. Diglett makes a good partner for its ability to trap and remove some Pokemon that can take Mienfoo's hits, including Poison-types and Ponyta. Alolan Grimer and Pawniard make good partners to this set as well, as they are able to use Pursuit to trap the Ghost-types that make it riskier for Mienfoo to use High Jump Kick and check opposing Fairy-types for it. Other Fighting-types such as Timburr work well as a partner to Mienfoo due to their ability to bring in and weaken shared checks and counters so that Mienfoo can clean with High Jump Kick late-game.</p>"
      },
      "Flyinium Z": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flyinium Z turns Bounce into a 160-Base Power Supersonic Skystrike, which surprises other Fighting-types like Timburr and Mienfoo as well as Foongus, a traditional Fighting-type check. High Jump Kick is the primary STAB option, giving Mienfoo more immediate power and 2HKOing most Pokemon that don't resist it. Fake Out is extremely helpful on this set, getting chip damage on the first turn Mienfoo is out and KOing Timburr and Foongus when combined with Supersonic Skystrike. Knock Off can give Mienfoo coverage against Ghost- and Psychic-types while also providing utility to its teammates by removing the foe's item. It also punishes switch-ins like Foongus by putting them in range to be KOed by Supersonic Skystrike. U-turn allows Mienfoo to gain momentum and get chip damage while switching.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Flyinium Z allows Bounce to become Supersonic Skystrike, a powerful Flying-type move that allows Mienfoo to lure and remove Foongus and surprise Timburr and opposing Mienfoo. On sets lacking Knock Off, Supersonic Skystrike can hit Pumpkaboo-XL as well. The ability is mostly up to preference; Regenerator gives Mienfoo slightly more staying power, allowing it to gain some HP back when switching or utilizing U-turn, but Reckless makes its High Jump Kick more difficult to switch into. A Jolly nature and 236 Speed EVs allow Mienfoo to outspeed the Pokemon it lures as well as Speed tie with other fast Mienfoo and Snivy. 156 Attack EVs allow Mienfoo to hit hard, notably scoring the KO on Timburr with Fake Out + Supersonic Skystrike. Finally, 116 Defense EVs net Mienfoo an extra two points in its physical bulk, allowing it to take less from priority moves like Aqua Jet and Mach Punch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be careful when using Supersonic Skystrike on predicted switches; it's a one-use move, so play it safe until the threatening Pokemon is on the field. Also, be sure not to reveal Bounce beforehand, as only this set utilizes it; switching into Knock Off can also tip off your opponent that you have a Z-Move, since Z-Crystals can't be removed. Be cautious when using High Jump Kick against teams with a Ghost-type, as they can switch in and force Mienfoo to take crash damage; use Knock Off to punish Ghost-types on the switch in. Be aware that Mienfoo is quite frail due to the lack of an Eviolite and won't be able to switch into attacks as easily as other variants. Otherwise, this Mienfoo can play similarly to pivot variants: coming in on resisted attacks, using U-turn to keep up its health and momentum, and using Knock Off to remove items to help teammates sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that appreciate Fighting-types removed like Pawniard, Zigzagoon, and Carvanha can utilize Mienfoo's ability to easily dispatch them. Mienfoo fits on cores with other Fighting-types like Timburr, as they share checks like Croagunk and Foongus, which Supersonic Skystrike can take care of easily. Similarly, Pokemon that want Grass-types removed like Staryu and Corphish are helped by Mienfoo's Supersonic Skystrike. Fairy-type checks like Pawniard, Foongus, and Magnemite can ward off Fairy-types, which this set has a hard time with. Flying-type checks like Onix and Pawniard are useful as well, patching up Mienfoo's Flying-type weakness. Both these Pokemon can use Stealth Rock too, which is helpful for getting the KO on Timburr and Foongus with Supersonic Skystrike without needing Fake Out. Pursuit trappers like Pawniard and Alolan Grimer are helpful, as without Knock Off Mienfoo has no way to deal with Pokemon like Abra and Gastly. Electric-types like Chinchou and Magnemite can form a VoltTurn core with Mienfoo and take care of Flying-types that outspeed and KO Mienfoo like Doduo and Choice Scarf Rufflet.</p>"

  "Golett": {
    "overview": "<p>Golett's niche lies in the fact that it is the only Pokemon in LC that can set Stealth Rock and block Rapid Spin at the same time, though it does lose to the most common spinner in the tier, Staryu. By virtue of its Ground / Ghost typing, Golett sports immunities to Normal-, Electric-, and Fighting-type moves, letting it hard counter non-Pursuit Munchlax and non-Shadow Ball Nasty Plot Croagunk while also beating Rock-types like Onix, Archen, and Cranidos. Golett is also one of the few Ghost-types available that aren't vulnerable to Alolan Grimer. Furthermore, its impressive Attack combined with Iron Fist allows Golett to hit decently hard, and its expansive movepool gives it coverage options to hit specific threats. However, Golett has fairly low Defense and Special Defense and is also slow, and its typing leaves it with glaring weaknesses to extremely common Dark-, Water-, and Grass-type moves. Because of this, it is unable to check most Fighting-types, fearing Knock Off. Golett is also vulnerable to common threats in Vullaby and Pawniard due to its typing. Golett faces competition from other Stealth Rock setters like Onix and Dwebble, which are faster and can check more Pokemon. Lastly, Golett also faces competition as a defensive Ghost-type from Pumpkaboo-XL, which has much more bulk and access to Synthesis and Will-O-Wisp.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Golett has an expansive movepool that includes coverage options to hit specific threats. Rock Slide is good coverage for Flying-types and never misses due to No Guard, but it isn't worth using over Ice Punch, which hits more of the metagame. Dynamic Punch along with No Guard can be run to heavily damage Dark-types and cause confusion to switch-ins, but Drain Punch already hits Dark-types hard anyway and can also heal Golett, and Golett values the damage boost given by Iron Fist. Fire Punch can be used to nail Ferroseed, while Thunder Punch can hit Water-types like Staryu. However, Ferroseed is already hit hard by Drain Punch, and Thunder Punch isn't as useful as Golett's other attacks. Golett can run Toxic to punish its switch-ins like Hippopotas, defensive Staryu, and Mudbray. However, doing so will make Golett lose out on coverage, and Toxic takes a long time to do significant damage. Golett has access to an amazing special movepool with moves like Shadow Ball, Earth Power, Focus Blast, Ice Beam, and Psychic, but its horrible Special Attack renders these moves completely inferior to its physical moves. Rock Polish allows Golett to become a setup sweeper, and it can make use of the boost due to its excellent coverage. However, Golett is both not strong enough and is easily KOed by many common Dark-, Water, and Grass-type attacking moves for this to be an effective option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types and Dark-type Coverage</strong>: Dark-types like Pawniard, Vullaby, and Scraggy are able to KO Golett with their super effective STAB moves. Furthermore, many Pokemon in the tier carry Knock Off as coverage, such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Doduo, making Golett weak to these Pokemon as well.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Staryu, Corphish, and Carvanha force Golett out with their super effective STAB moves, although they don't appreciate switching into it.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types like Gastly, Frillish, and Pumpkaboo-S are able to outspeed Golett and KO it with their STAB moves. However, if Golett is running Shadow Punch, they cannot switch in.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Cottonee, Snivy, and Pumpkaboo-XL threaten Golett with their super effective STAB moves as well as their resistance to Earthquake. These Pokemon are hit hard by Ice Punch, however.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Hippopotas, Mudbray, Spritzee, and Foongus don't take much damage from Golett's atacks and can proceed to wear it down.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Drain Punch is boosted by Iron Fist, dents Normal-types like Munchlax and Bunnelby, and hits Ferroseed. It also provides good coverage as well as recovery, allowing Golett to stay healthy over the course of the match while weakening its switch-ins. STAB Earthquake hits Steel-, Rock-, and Poison-types like Magnemite, Onix, Alolan Grimer, and Croagunk hard. Stealth Rock wears down the enemy team with chip damage. Ice Punch allows Golett to hit Grass- and Flying-types like Snivy and Vullaby and is boosted by Iron Fist. Shadow Punch can be run over Ice Punch for its solid neutral coverage. It is boosted by STAB and Iron Fist, enabling Golett to 2HKO Slowpoke and bulky Frillish.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>44 HP EVs and 196 Defense EVs increase Golett's physical bulk, allowing it to take hits from bigger threats in the tier at least once; Golett has a high chance of surviving bulky Pawniard's Knock Off. 164 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature allow Golett to hit as hard as possible without sacrificing too much bulk. They also enable it to OHKO Pawniard with Drain Punch, OHKO Chinchou with Earthquake, and 2HKO Ponyta with Earthquake. 76 Speed EVs let Golett reach 11 Speed, allowing it to outspeed 10 Speed Pokemon like Frillish, Hippopotas, 36 Speed EVs Snubbull, and uninvested Timburr. Eviolite increases Golett's bulk and survivability, and Iron Fist increases the power of Drain Punch, Ice Punch, and Shadow Punch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Golett's main role is to set up Stealth Rock and then attack whenever it can. Golett should be switched into Pokemon it beats, such as non-Shadow Ball Nasty Plot Croagunk, non-Pursuit Munchlax, and Onix. It should not be switched into powerful attacks from Pokemon like Rufflet and Doduo. Refrain from switching Golett in too much, as it has poor bulk and a pretty bad defensive typing. Except when switching into a resisted attack, Golett should be brought in via pivot support or after a teammate faints. Drain Punch is a good move for finishing off weakened threats due to the healing it provides. Set up Stealth Rock against Pokemon Golett checks like Onix and non-Pursuit Munchlax as well as support Pokemon like Spritzee. Be extremely careful when using Golett to spinblock, as both Staryu and Drilbur can beat it one-on-one. Only switch Golett in if you are sure that the foe will go for Rapid Spin; otherwise, Golett will be hit hard by Staryu's Scald or Hydro Pump or Drilbur's Earthquake.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dark-types like Pawniard, Alolan Grimer, and Vullaby can switch into Knock Off and deal with the Ghost-types that threaten Golett. Pawniard functions especially well due to it dissuading Defog, letting it protect Golett's entry hazards. Grass-types such as Snivy and Foongus can threaten Water-types like Staryu and Corphish that trouble Golett, while it is able to switch into the Poison-type moves that threaten them in return. Grass-types are also able to deter Drilbur from using Earthquake, allowing Golett to switch in more easily. Fighting-type Pokemon like Mienfoo and Timburr can handle the Dark-types that beat Golett. Fairy-types like Snubbull, Cottonee, and Spritzee can also deal with Dark-types, and Golett can check Poison-types like Croagunk that beat them. Said Fairy-types can also threaten Fighting-types like Mienfoo that typically carry Knock Off. Powerful Flying-types such as Rufflet and Doduo can threaten the Grass-types that beat Golett. It can switch into the Electric- and Rock-type moves that trouble them in return. Golett functions great with Sticky Web up, so setters like Surskit can come in handy. Pivots like Mienfoo, Magnemite, and Chinchou can bring in Golett safely with U-turn or Volt Switch.</p>"

  "Pawniard": {
    "overview": "<p>Pawniard is a metagame-defining force and a very potent wallbreaker with excellent STAB coverage and the strongest Knock Off in the tier. Its great offensive typing is really good defensively as well, taking on Flying- and Grass-type Pokemon with ease. It also severely threatens anything slower than it due to its good coverage, powerful attacks, and the potential for an Iron Head flinch. Additionally, unlike many of the best wallbreakers, Pawniard is no slouch against offense due to its powerful Sucker Punch. It does have a few flaws, though; a middling Speed stat leaves Pawniard in an awkward Speed tier, and it struggles with Fighting- and Fire-type Pokemon, which make for its best checks. Lastly, Pawniard suffers from having shaped the metagame in the past, as more Pokemon run coverage moves for Pawniard than for any other Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave allows Pawniard to cripple any switch-in and opens up the potential for infinitely frustrating paraflinch shenanigans. Rock Tomb allows Pawniard to slow down and remove Ponyta, one of its best checks, if it switches in on the attack. It also helps Pawniard deal with Weak Armor Vullaby. However, it's very difficult to find room on a moveset for coverage against a few specific threats. Running Substitute allows Pawniard to capitalize on the many switches it tends to force. Holding a Lum Berry allows Pawniard a one-time out from crippling status inflictions such as burn and sleep as it takes on Pokemon such as Foongus, Ponyta, and Gastly. However, it is generally less effective overall than other options presented. Alternatively, holding Steelium Z gives Pawniard access to a one time attack that will OHKO any Mienfoo or Timburr on the switch, provided their items have been removed. This can be valuable as a lure, but its effects are very situational, limited, and overall less valuable than those of other items. Pawniard can also run Rock Polish in order to boost its Speed to an extremely threatening level. However, since it already has access to Sucker Punch, Rock Polish can become redundant, and the moveslot is generally better used with another move. Lastly, Choice Scarf Pawniard can make use of Snarl, as 36 EVs in Special Attack and a neutral nature allow Pawniard to KO Gastly behind a Substitute; however, this move is incredibly niche.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon</strong>: Pawniard's best attacks are its Dark-type attacks, so its biggest threat is the plethora of Fighting-type Pokemon in the tier. The best examples are Mienfoo, which naturally outspeeds Pawniard, and Timburr and Croagunk, which each threaten Pawniard with priority Fighting-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Burn Status</strong>: Pawniard becomes significantly less threatening when inflicted with burn; this can be accomplished by Flame Body users such as Ponyta and Larvesta or by Will-O-Wisp users such as Ponyta and Gastly.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon</strong>: Mudbray and Diglett, specifically, are huge threats to Pawniard. Mudbray can repeatedly check Pawniard due to its ability Stamina and its powerful STAB Earthquake, whereas Diglett can come in on Pawniard after it KOes another foe Pokemon, trap it via Arena Trap, and KO it with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Hidden Power Fighting Users</strong>: Several Pokemon that do not ordinarily check Pawniard can be turned into checks by including Hidden Power Fighting in their moveset; these include fast Pokemon such as Cottonee, defensive Pokemon such as Foongus, and Magnemite, which can run a set that uses Hidden Power Fighting designed specifically to switch into and trap Pawniard.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off provides a strong STAB attack and removes the foe's item. Sucker Punch is a strong priority attack that allows Pawniard to revenge KO many faster foes. Iron Head is another strong STAB attack that gives Pawniard excellent neutral coverage. Stealth Rock is an essential move to most teams, providing chip damage and breaking foe's Sturdy and Focus Sashes. Swords Dance turns Pawniard into a huge wallbreaking threat; most defensive Pokemon have severe trouble taking Pawniard on when it's at +2 Attack. Brick Break provides coverage against the three Pokemon in Little Cup that resist Pawniard's STAB attacks: Houndour, Carvanha, and other Pawniard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>196 Speed EVs and a Jolly Nature maximize Pawniard's Speed. The defensive EV investment maximizes the boost to both of Pawniard's defenses that Eviolite provides. The remaining EVs go to Attack to boost Pawniard's power. Alternatively, an Adamant nature will further increase Pawniard's damage output but will leave it at risk of a Speed tie with Scraggy. Defiant is Pawniard's best ability; it gives Pawniard a +2 Attack boost if one of its stats drops. This helps Pawniard discourage the use of the move Defog and the ability Intimidate.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>One of Pawniard's main goals is to set Stealth Rock, a task easily accomplished against any Pokemon it forces out such as Snubbull. The next most important task for Pawniard is to spam Knock Off; the more items it can remove, the better! Pawniard has a tendency to bring in foe Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Mienfoo, as they attempt to take one of Pawniard's strong Knock Offs. A double switch to a check to Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Snubbull or Skrelp, is often a good idea. You can also use Pawniard to check a plethora of threatening Flying-, Grass-, and Fairy-type Pokemon due to its defensive typing and powerful priority attack. Additionally, if your opponent has a threatening setup sweeper such as Shellder or Omanyte, it is often wise to preserve Pawniard so it can KO them with Sucker Punch after they have set up and taken some damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pawniard is such a good Pokemon that it can fit on practically any team archetype, as there are very few teams that would not appreciate its immense offensive presence and strong defensive typing. However, a sturdy check to Fighting-type Pokemon is absolutely essential when using Pawniard. Good examples include Fairy-type Pokemon such as Snubbull and Poison-type Pokemon such as Mareanie and Foongus. Pawniard is also heavily threatened by Fire- and Ground-type Pokemon. A good switch-in to these Pokemon, such as Chinchou for Fire-types or Vullaby for Ground-types, helps remedy this issue. Lastly, Pawniard happens to synergize well with many Fighting-type Pokemon, as it threatens the Fairy- and Flying-type Pokemon with which Pokemon such as Mienfoo and Timburr tend to struggle.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off and Iron Head are Pawniard's best STAB attacks, and both have additional effects; Knock Off removes the foe's item and Iron Head has a chance to induce flinch. Brick Break complete's Pawniard's neutral coverage, allowing it to hit Houndour, Carvanha, and other Pawniard super effectively. Should you choose not to use Brick Break, however, Sucker Punch provides strong priority against Shell Smashers and is particularly useful if Pawniard gets Knocked Off. Stealth Rock is another option for teams that need the role compression it can provide. Pursuit allows Pawniard to trap weakened foes, and it guarantees the removal of any Gastly or Abra it manages to get in against.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>196 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature maximize Pawniard's Speed, which is then further boosted by Choice Scarf; Pawniard hits an impressive 24 Speed using this set. 236 Attack EVs maximize Pawniard's Attack, as it runs only attacking moves on this set and has little need for extra bulk. The remaining EVs boost Pawniard's defensive stats slightly; there's really no better place for them. Defiant gives Pawniard a +2 Attack boost when one of its stats is dropped by a foe; this allows it to severely threaten Defog users.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This variant of Pawniard is good at picking up revenge KOs following the fainting of a teammate thanks to its high Speed and access to Pursuit. Smart predictions can allow you to bring Pawniard directly in on strong attackers such as Abra and Gastly, which Pawniard can then trap with Pursuit. However, always be wary of being hit with Hidden Power Fighting on the switch! Pawniard's excellent typing still allows it to switch in on many Flying- and Grass-type Pokemon to an extent; however, missing out on the bulk of Eviolite or the recovery of Berry Juice really hurts Pawniard's ability to switch into attacks repeatedly, so be cautious of it being worn down.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since you will often lock Pawniard into a Dark-type attack due to Choice Scarf, a strong check to Fighting-type Pokemon is absolutely essential. Good examples of such Pokemon include Spritzee, Foongus, and Ponyta. In addition to Fighting-type Pokemon, Pawniard is threatened by Fire- and Ground-type Pokemon. A good switch-in to these Pokemon, such as Chinchou for Fire-types or Snivy for Ground-types, is always a good choice. Because of its access to Pursuit, Pokemon that appreciate the removal of threats like Abra and Gastly, such as Timburr, find a good partner in Pawniard. Lastly, Pawniard is threatened by status effects such as burn and paralysis; cleric support from the likes of Snubbull and Chinchou helps to remedy this issue.</p>"

      "Life Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is a great STAB attack that also removes foes' items. Sucker Punch is a powerful priority attack that allows Pawniard to revenge kill a plethora of Pokemon. Iron Head is another STAB attack that provides excellent neutral coverage and super effective coverage against Fairy-type Pokemon. Low Sweep hits every Pokemon that resists Pawniard's STAB attacks for super effective damage, and it also lowers the Speed of any Pokemon it hits. This allows Pawniard to slow down conventional checks such as Mienfoo and Ponyta and hit them hard the next turn. Alternatively, Swords Dance allows Pawniard to further boost its Attack, making it into a truly terrifying threat. However, the move is fairly difficult to use effectively without the added bulk of Eviolite.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread and nature maximize Pawniard's Speed and Attack, making it as threatening as possible; the remaining EVs are put in bulk, as there's really no other place to put them. Life Orb boosts Pawniard's damage output by a factor of 1.3x at the cost of 1/10 of its HP per attack; 0 HP IVs allow Pawniard to only lose 1 HP per attack, as the calculation will round down. Defiant allows Pawniard to discourage the use of Defog, Sticky Web, and Intimidate by giving it a +2 Attack boost whenever one of its stats is dropped by the foe.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to get Pawniard in on a free switch, like off a slow U-turn or after a teammate faints. That way, Pawniard will be able to stay as healthy as possible as it slowly loses HP to its Life Orb. For its Life Orb set more than ever, Pawniard has a tendency to bring in foe Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Mienfoo, as they attempt to take one of Pawniard's strong Knock Offs. A double switch to a check to Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Ponyta or Foongus, is often a good idea!</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pawniard appreciates a free switch from slow pivot moves due to its increased frailty when using Life Orb. Mienfoo and Chinchou make great partners, as they tend to bring in Pokemon that are threatened by Pawniard and can pivot out to it using U-turn or Volt Switch. As always, Pawniard absolutely needs a good check to Fighting-type Pokemon in order to be successful. Offensive options such as Snubbull and Ponyta tend to fit well with the offensive playstyles on which Life Orb Pawniard fits best. Pawniard is always a huge threat to Pokemon slower than it, so Sticky Web support from Spinarak or Surskit can make it very difficult to handle. Spinarak comes with the added benefit of checking Fighting-type Pokemon well due to its Bug / Poison typing. Additionally, other entry hazard support can help Pawniard secure valuable KOs it would not obtain otherwise. Pokemon such as Dwebble and Omanyte can reliably set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes to provide chip damage against foe Pokemon. As Pawniard is particularly hampered by status effects such as burn and paralysis, cleric support from the likes of Snubbull and Chinchou can go a long way in making it more effective. Lastly, Pokemon such as Magnemite and Snivy that can use Thunder Wave or Glare to cripple Pawniard's checks can help make Pawniard even more of a threat.</p>"

  "Rufflet": {
    "overview": "<p>Rufflet was a mediocre Pokemon in XY, but SM gave it access to Brave Bird, cementing its place as a fearsome threat. Rufflet is able to hit incredibly hard because of its ability Hustle, which raises its Attack stat by 1.5. However, the downside to this ability is that all of Rufflet's physical moves except for Aerial Ace have only an 80% hit rate. Rufflet's good bulk and ways to get around traditional Flying-type counters with Superpower allow it to run good Choice Scarf and Bulk Up sets, although its mediocre Speed tier makes it unable to outspeed faster threats like Mienfoo, Chinchou, and Onix.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Life Orb is an option, but it is not as good because of Rufflet's mediocre Speed. It should only be used on Sticky Web teams, as otherwise Doduo runs a better Life Orb set. Hone Claws sweeping sets are another option, but they generally have a much harder time completing a sweep, and using Bulk Up is generally better. If your team struggles with Honedge, you can use Shadow Claw to hit it. This is not recommended, though, because Shadow Claw doesn't really hit anything else that other moves already do. You can use Steel Wing or Rock Slide if you want to be able to OHKO Archen or other Flying-types (in the case of Rock Slide). Rufflet is a decent user of Tailwind because of its high damage output and access to U-turn. If you do not like missing, you can use Keen Eye Rufflet instead of Hustle, but then running Doduo or Vullaby instead is probably a better choice. Don't use completely defensive sets with Defog or Whirlwind because Vullaby does these sets better. You can add Sleep Talk on the Choice Scarf set if your team has no other way to deal with the sleep status.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Honedge</strong>: Honedge completely walls Rufflet unless it chooses to use Shadow Claw. Sacred Sword goes through Bulk Up boosts and hits Rufflet super effectively while it is using Roost.</p> <p><strong>Fast Electric-, Rock-, and Steel-types</strong>: Pokemon like Chinchou, Elekid, Magnemite, Amaura, and Onix can switch in on a resisted move and proceed to KO Rufflet with a strong STAB move. SturdyJuice Magnemite is a fairly safe switch-in, since Rufflet does not have access to Knock Off. Pokemon like Magnemite, Amaura, Pawniard, and Onix fear Superpower, but they can force Rufflet out if it is locked into a resisted move.</p> <p><strong>Shell Smash Users</strong>: Tirtouga and Omanyte can switch into Brave Bird and Return, set up, and then KO Rufflet.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird is Rufflet's most powerful attack, but it has the downside of causing Rufflet to take recoil damage. Superpower is Rufflet's main coverage move, as it allows it to hit Rock- and Steel- type Pokemon. U-turn is used to gain momentum and to add chip damage on opposing Pokemon. Return is Rufflet's other STAB attack, which allows it to hit Electric-types hard. However, it is not as important as Rufflet's other moves and can be replaced if necessary. Aerial Ace can be used if you want to use Rufflet's power without having to worry about missing, but it is a much weaker option and generally not as useful as Rufflet's other moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Rufflet's EVs and nature allow it to outspeed 15 Speed Pokemon with a +1 boost. Notable examples of these are Scraggy after a Dragon Dance and Choice Scarf Magnemite. The majority of the other EVs are invested in Attack to allow Rufflet's moves to hit as hard as possible. The remaining EVs are put into Defense so that Rufflet takes less damage from priority moves like Sucker Punch and Mach Punch. Rufflet's ability Hustle boosts its Attack stat by 1.5 and allows it to hit very hard.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rufflet is best used as an early-game pivot and a late-game sweeper. Use Brave Bird and Return to secure KOs in the early-game and sweep up the remnants of your opponent's team in the late-game. Whenever you suspect that your opponent is going to switch in a Rock- or Steel-type, use Superpower. If you think that your opponent is going to send in a Pokemon that Rufflet cannot KO with any of its moves, you should almost always U-turn out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Honedge completely walls this set, so Pokemon that can check it like Mienfoo and Timburr are good partners. Shell Smash users also have an easy time setting up and sweeping your team if they come in on a resisted move like Brave Bird or Return. Therefore, Pokemon that can deal with set-up Shell Smash users like Timburr, Pawniard, and Focus Sash Abra are good partners. Other VoltTurn Pokemon like Mienfoo, Chinchou, and Magnemite are good partners for Rufflet, as they can form a VoltTurn core for your team. Pokemon that resist or are immune to the types that Rufflet is weak to and can also hit them hard are good teammates. Some examples of these Pokemon are Mienfoo, Timburr, Chinchou, Diglett, and Drilbur. Entry hazard removers like Staryu, Drilbur, and Sandshrew can help alleviate Rufflet's weakness to Stealth Rock by removing it from the field. Conversely, Rufflet benefits greatly from hazards wearing down its checks and U-turning out as they switch in, so setters like Omanyte and Dwebble are good partners as well. Other Flying-types like Doduo and Vullaby are also good teammates, as they can wear down each other's checks.</p>"
      },
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird is Rufflet's strongest STAB move. You can run Aerial Ace if you do not want to risk missing, but the power loss is generally not worth it. Superpower hits most traditional Flying-type checks (Rock- and Steel-types). You can use Facade instead if you want to be able to safely set up on Pokemon like Ponyta and weaker Scald users like Mareanie, since being burned will not affect Rufflet as negatively as it would otherwise. Bulk Up allows Rufflet to gain massive Attack and Defense boosts and eventually sweep the opposing team. Roost is used to recover damage taken while setting up and attacking.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Rufflet's EVs and an Impish nature give it 25 / 21 / 21 bulk with Eviolite. 21 Defense allows you to set up Bulk Up on Mudbray and Drilbur. It also lets Rufflet survive both High Jump Kick and Stone Edge after Stealth Rock from maximum Attack Mienfoo. 21 Special Defense is the highest amount Rufflet can have without a positive nature, and it lets Rufflet set up on weaker special attackers like Spritzee and Mareanie. The remaining EVs are invested in Attack and Speed so that Rufflet can still hit hard and outspeed Pokemon like Croagunk and Stufful. Hustle allows Rufflet to hit hard by boosting its Attack by 1.5.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rufflet is best used to wall physical attackers like Mudbray and then set up and sweep the opposing team. It can set up on Pokemon like Mudbray and Drilbur, although it is unable to switch in on Drilbur and set up. It is also able to set up on weaker special attackers like Spritzee. Once strong special attackers like Abra and Gastly are gone, Rufflet has a much easier time sweeping opposing teams. Rufflet also has utility outside of being a sweeper; it is a good soft check for Pokemon like Snivy and Scraggy, but after dealing with them it is likely that it will be weakened too much to fulfill its normal role as a sweeper.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rufflet greatly appreciates Electric-types being removed, so Diglett is a good partner, as it can trap and KO all non-Choice Scarf Electric-types. Rufflet also dislikes strong special attackers like Abra and Gastly, so Alolan Grimer and Stunky are good partners, as they can trap these Pokemon. Pokemon that resist or are immune to the types that Rufflet is weak to and can also hit them hard are good teammates. Some examples of these Pokemon are Mienfoo, Timburr, Chinchou, Diglett, and Drilbur. Other Flying-type Pokemon are good team options, as they can weaken Rufflet's checks and make it easier for Rufflet to sweep late-game. Rufflet is also a decent Pokemon on Sticky Web teams, as it benefits from all opposing grounded Pokemon having lowered Speed. It is also a good check to Snivy, which generally threatens Sticky Web teams.</p>"

  "Vullaby": {
    "overview": "<p>Vullaby is one of the best Pokemon in LC thanks to its versatility. Vullaby's offensive typing allows it to hit every Pokemon in the metagame barring Pawniard for at least neutral damage, and it has powerful options such as Brave Bird, Knock Off, Air Slash, and Dark Pulse to utilize and customize. Vullaby's typing helps it defensively as well, giving it many useful resistances that make it easy to fit onto a team. Its terrific stats don't hurt either, giving Vullaby a mix of bulk and power that allows it to serve as a sweeper, a wallbreaker, and even a blanket check to much of the metagame. Vullaby's abilities also compound its usefulness. Weak Armor gives Vullaby the ability to to outspeed the entire unboosted (and much of the boosted) metagame after being hit by a physical attack, neutralizing its middling Speed and making it quite difficult to revenge kill. Alternatively, Vullaby can play more defensively with Overcoat, which gives it an immunity to Spore and does not lower its Defense.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A fully defensive set with Overcoat, Eviolite, and Roost makes Vullaby a wall and slow pivot that can be quite hard to break through, but it is very passive, often worn down, and generally outclassed by other sets in this offensive metagame. Iron Defense allows Vullaby to act as an incredibly strong check to physical attackers and take on its most common check in Onix, but it is still vulnerable to strong special attackers. Flyinium Z can be run alongside Mirror Move for the +2 Attack boost that Z-Mirror Move provides, potentially allowing Vullaby to sweep with Weak Armor; however, Vullaby's reliance on a Weak Armor boost to outspeed most offensive Pokemon, lowered bulk, and lack of longevity without Berry Juice makes this difficult to pull off. Rock Smash can be used to hit Pawniard on fully physical sets, but Vullaby is usually better off running other moves; Rock Smash also doesn't even OHKO Pawniard and triggers Defiant.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Onix is one of the most consistent Vullaby checks, outspeeding Vullaby before Weak Armor boosts. It can easily come in on Brave Bird and Knock Off to get a Weak Armor boost and heavily damage Vullaby with Rock Blast thanks to Weak Armor's Defense drop. However, Onix has to watch out for Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p><strong>Pawniard</strong>: Pawniard resists both of Vullaby's STAB attacks, can outspeed Vullaby before a Weak Armor boost, and can take advantage of Weak Armor Defense drops with Sucker Punch. However, it must be wary of Heat Wave and Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Spritzee can check most variants of Vullaby, while Snubbull is useful against physical variants. However, neither Pokemon likes Knock Off, and Vullaby's Brave Bird can still deal significant damage to both.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Strong special attacks from Staryu, Magnemite, and Elekid are the best way to handle Vullaby offensively. However, these Pokemon can only deal with Vullaby if its Speed hasn't been boosted by Weak Armor.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority users, including Fake Out Mienfoo, Mach Punch Timburr, and Sucker Punch Pawniard, can revenge kill Weak Armor sets after they have taken Defense drops.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird and Knock Off provide terrific neutral coverage, since Vullaby can cripple Flying-resistant foes with Knock Off. U-turn allows Vullaby to chip down and gain momentum against Pokemon such as Spritzee, Onix, and Pawniard. Vullaby is a safe and reliable Defogger thanks to the many switches it forces, its fantastic natural bulk, and potential Speed boosts from Weak Armor. Hidden Power Fighting OHKOes Pawniard, which it often lures in, after Knock Off with minimal Special Attack investment. If the team doesn't require Defog, Hidden Power Grass and Heat Wave are potentially useful coverage options for Rock-types like Onix and Steel-types like Ferroseed, respectively. It should be noted, however, that the mixed attacker set is usually a better choice to fulfill these roles. Protect is an option that allows Vullaby to dodge Mienfoo's High Jump Kick, shield itself against Z-moves, and scout for opposing moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This Vullaby set can run an enormous variety of EV spreads depending on the needs of its team. This analysis will go over the important EV benchmarks in each stat, and then it will list some common EV spreads that combine these benchmarks.</p> <p>Vullaby runs an Adamant nature and maximum Attack investment to reach 16 Attack, granting it a 75% chance to OHKO many Mienfoo and Timburr variants, as well as Foongus after Stealth Rock, with Brave Bird. 16 Attack Vullaby also 2HKOes Eviolite-less Spritzee with Brave Bird consistently, and it can OHKO frailer variants of opposing Vullaby after a Weak Armor Defense drop. However, some spreads sacrifice this offensive presence in favor of greater bulk to more reliably check key threats. While 76 Defense EVs with no HP investment are sufficient to survive defensive Mienfoo's High Jump Kick and three hits of Onix's Rock Blast after Stealth Rock, Vullaby avoids the OHKO from Reckless Mienfoo's High Jump Kick from full and opposing Vullaby's Brave Bird from full after a Weak Armor drop with an additional 116 HP EVs. 116 HP and 156 Special Defense EVs allow Vullaby to avoid the KO from Focus Sash Abra's Dazzling Gleam after Stealth Rock and Life Orb Abra's Dazzling Gleam from full while also taking Special Attacks much better in general. 196 Speed EVs allow Vullaby to hit 15 Speed, outspeeding +1 Ponyta and +2 Jolly Shellder after a Weak Armor boost and giving it a better chance of outspeeding opposing Vullaby. Lower Speed investments are viable to run more bulk or a combination of bulk and power. 14 Speed is still good to outspeed slow Mienfoo naturally and 18 Speed Choice Scarf users like Doduo after a Weak Armor boost, but it will cause Vullaby to be less capable in mirror matchups and force it to tie against +1 Ponyta and +2 Jolly Shellder after a Weak Armor boost. 13 initial Speed isn't usually ideal, as it will leave Vullaby to Speed tie with slow Mienfoo and outsped by most opposing Vullaby.</p> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Vullaby's Speed and offensive power while granting it enough physical bulk to withstand some common attacks. Other commonly used EV spread include:</p> <p>116 HP / 156 Atk / 156 SpD / 36 Spe with a Jolly nature, which gives Vullaby many of the Special Defense benefits listed above while retaining some offensive presence. This spread can be used as a very flexible pivot as well as a soft check to many special attackers, such as Abra and Staryu.</p> <p>116 HP / 76 Def / 156 SpD / 116 Spe with a Jolly nature, which gives Vullaby more general bulk and good Speed at the expense of substantial offensive presence. This spread, compared to the previous spread, retains the Special Defense benefits while also offering the aforementioned benefits of 15 Speed.</p> <p>116 HP / 76 Def / 236 SpD / 36 Spe with a Jolly nature, which maximizes Vullaby's special bulk. This spread is the best check to Snivy and Gastly, but it loses out on both Attack and Speed, making it relatively passive.</p> <p>If any of these sets were to run Hidden Power Fighting, then a neutral nature should be used to hit 11 Special Attack at the cost of 1 point of Speed, and 4 additional EVs must be added accordingly in Defense, Special Defense, or Speed to compensate for the dropped IVs required for Hidden Power.</p> <p>Weak Armor is usually the preferred ability, especially with more offensive EV spreads, to deter the opponent from using certain physical moves with Vullaby's presence alone. Vullaby is able to come in on common attacks such as Mienfoo's Knock Off and, if healthy, High Jump Kick to immediately threaten the opposition with powerful STAB moves or U-turn. Overcoat is also an option, mostly on more defensive spreads, for teams that need a switch-in to Foongus's Spore. Berry Juice allows Vullaby to remain healthy without giving up valuable turns to use Roost; it synergizes well with Brave Bird because it ensures that the recoil isn't overly detrimental.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Between Knock Off and U-turn, Vullaby is excellent at forcing in and weakening its checks early- and mid-game. Knock Off is often Vullaby's safest attack due to its high damage, extremely useful side effect, and lack of recoil; however, it may be punished by opposing Weak Armor users such as Onix and enemy Vullaby. If you predict the opponent to switch to a Pokemon that Vullaby can't immediately break, such as Onix, U-turn can be used to gain momentum; however, be careful of using the move too frequently if Stealth Rock is up, as this can quickly wear Vullaby down. Brave Bird recoil and Stealth Rock chip damage are often helpful for activating Berry Juice after some prior damage, putting Vullaby out of range of certain KOs. Defog should be used when Vullaby forces out its foe; however, be wary of using it against a Pawniard switch-in if it can't be revenge killed at +2 Attack. Weak Armor lets Vullaby come in on physical attacks that don't OHKO it from enemies that it can force out, as Vullaby will almost always outspeed them the turn after and gain offensive momentum Later in the game, when its checks have been worn down, Vullaby can use a Weak Armor boost to clean using Brave Bird. The ability does have its drawbacks; if Vullaby is unable to OHKO the enemy, it becomes vulnerable to attacks that hit its weakened Defense or are boosted by Analytic.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Weak Armor Pivot Vullaby ranks among the easiest sets in LC to include on a team; there are many teams that appreciate its ability to act as a wallbreaker, pivot, and soft check to a variety of threats. While this set lacks the longevity to reliably check Snivy, Abra, Fighting-types, and Foongus, it is able to soft check all of them while providing offensive presence. Vullaby is incredibly adept at gaining momentum when paired with other VoltTurn users such as Mienfoo and Magnemite. For example, Mienfoo handles Pawniard and Rock-types for Vullaby, while Magnemite forces out Fairy-types and Shellder; in exchange, Vullaby soft checks Foongus, Abra, and Fighting-types for them. Checks to Vullaby, including Onix, Spritzee and Magnemite, should be handled by the rest of the team. Examples of good teammates for this include Foongus, Ferroseed, and Ponyta. Eviolite Diglett is fantastic at supporting Vullaby by reliably trapping Onix, Pawniard, and Magnemite. Frailer variants of Diglett are more generally useful and can still support Vullaby quite well, but they struggle to trap Weak Armor Onix, Choice Scarf Pawniard, and Choice Scarf Magnemite.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird is Vullaby's primary STAB move. Knock Off complements Brave Bird and has the added utility of removing foes' defensive items. Heat Wave gives Vullaby an option to hit Steel-types, 2HKOing Pawniard with the given EV spread. Hidden Power Grass substantially damages Onix, OHKOing non-Eviolite variants unless Sturdy is active, and also deals good damage to Mudbray after a Stamina boost.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread sacrifices the raw power of investing solely in either Attack or Special Attack for mixed investment. 14 Attack still allows Vullaby's STAB attacks to hit quite hard, while 12 Special Attack allows it to KO Pawniard with Knock Off + Heat Wave after Stealth Rock or two Heat Waves from full, as well as OHKO SturdyJuice Onix after Stealth Rock and Groundium Z Onix from full. Alternatively, an EV spread of 236 Atk / 76 Def / 80 SpA / 116 Spe with an Adamant nature grants Vullaby 16 Attack, allowing it to OHKO many variants of Timburr and Mienfoo. The smaller Special Attack investment still allows Vullaby to OHKO non-Eviolite Onix and 2HKO Pawniard after Stealth Rock. Berry Juice works well on this set, allowing Vullaby to take a foe's attack, get a Speed boost, and return to full health.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Vullaby set can effectively lure in and surprise its common checks, such as Rock- and Steel-types. Generally, Vullaby should use Knock Off early in a match to weaken its checks by removing their defensive items. When appropriate, Vullaby can use Heat Wave or Hidden Power Grass to surprise a check and remove it, allowing Vullaby to use Brave Bird more safely. After its checks have been weakened or eliminated, Vullaby should attempt to come in on a weak physical attack to boost its Speed with Weak Armor and cause havoc with Brave Bird. This Vullaby set lacks longevity or significant Defense investment, so avoid allowing it to be worn down by super effective attacks or Stealth Rock damage until Vullaby can take advantage of its full offensive arsenal.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Vullaby set is effective at taking out common Flying-type checks, including Rock- and Steel-types, so other Flying-types, including Doduo and Rufflet, have terrific offensive synergy with it. Other Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Rock-types, such as Ponyta, also pair well with this set. As Vullaby gets worn down quickly by Stealth Rock, especially since it may be switching in frequently to aim for a Weak Armor boost, entry hazard control from Staryu and Snivy is helpful. When Vullaby's Weak Armor is not activated, it is susceptible to being revenge killed, especially by Rock- and Electric-type attacks. Thus, Pokemon that can switch into these attacks, and especially Pokemon that can check Onix, such as Mienfoo synergize well with it. Hazard setters such as Onix and Ferroseed help Vullaby accumulate chip damage onto its foes, bringing them into KO range.</p>"
      },
      "Flyinium Z": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird's high Base Power makes Supersonic Skystrike extremely strong, letting Vullaby deal huge damage to most Flying-neutral targets and potentially putting its checks into range of coverage moves. Knock Off complements this by weakening checks such as Spritzee, Onix, and Pawniard. Hidden Power Grass and Heat Wave provide coverage for switch-ins such as Onix and Pawniard. Hidden Power Fighting is a more reliable way of covering Pawniard, OHKOing it after Knock Off, but Vullaby loses the ability to KO Onix. Protect is usually run with Hidden Power Fighting, allowing Vullaby to scout for opposing attacks and block Fake Out and High Jump Kick.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread and Naughty nature maximize Vullaby's Attack stat and gives it the best chance of OHKOing opposing Vullaby. A Naughty nature with 80 EVs in Special Attack allows Hidden Power Grass to KO Onix after Supersonic Skystrike and Heat Wave to 2HKO Pawniard. With 116 Speed EVs, Vullaby can outspeed the vast majority of the metagame, including most Choice Scarf users after a Speed boost. If using Hidden Power Fighting, a spread of 36 HP / 236 Atk / 200 Spe with either a Naive or Naughty nature should be used. A Naive nature is preferred, granting Vullaby 16 Speed and allowing it to outspeed most opposing Vullaby variants and Speed tie with Pawniard. A Naughty nature can still be used to maximize Vullaby's offensive output.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Without Berry Juice, Vullaby lacks longevity, so it's important to be proactive in wallbreaking. Vullaby has a good matchup in physical attackers due to Weak Armor, and it should avoid special attackers in most scenarios. Flyinium Z Vullaby makes a great switch-in to Knock Off because it activates Vullaby's Weak Armor while dealing minimal damage. As a lead, Vullaby is able to surprise other lead Vullaby and 15 Defense Fighting-types, which survive Brave Bird, with Supersonic Skystrike. Watch out for Onix because it's the Pokemon that best tanks a Supersonic Skystrike. Try to avoid activating Onix's Weak Armor if Vullaby has a Weak Armor boost itself by using Hidden Power Grass on a predicted switch. If your team has Diglett or Ponyta, you can first aim to trap or burn Onix before sending in Vullaby.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ponyta burns physical attackers for Vullaby so it can take advantage of them via Weak Armor while staying healthy. Vullaby can support Ponyta in return by weakening Onix with Hidden Power Grass. Staryu is a great teammate for Vullaby because it can clear Stealth Rock, which Ponyta happens to appreciate too. Diglett can trap Flying-resistant Pokemon like Onix and Pawniard. Because Vullaby lacks its usual utility against special attackers, it's important to include checks to Abra and Gastly on the team, like the aforementioned Diglett and Pawniard. Diglett and Ferroseed are also useful to cover Staryu, which forces Vullaby out. Doduo is a decent teammate for Vullaby because they can overwhelm their shared checks and counters together.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot allows Vullaby to function as a potent special sweeper in conjunction with Weak Armor. Air Slash hits common Fighting-types for super effective damage, and its flinch chance makes Vullaby especially deadly. Heat Wave hits most Steel-types, including Magnemite and Pawniard, for solid damage. Hidden Power Grass provides useful coverage against Rock-types like Onix and Tirtouga, though Dark Pulse is an alternative that allows Vullaby to OHKO Gastly without Nasty Plot. Protect allows Vullaby to scout for opposing moves and avoid being revenge killed by Fake Out. Substitute is another option that lets Vullaby avoid Pawniard's Sucker Punch and set up on Foongus and Ferroseed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With 116 Speed EVs, Vullaby hits 14 Speed or 28 after a Weak Armor boost, allowing it to outspeed practically every Choice Scarf user in the metagame and avoid being easily revenge killed. 116 HP EVs improve Vullaby's mixed bulk significantly, allowing it to usually survive attacks like Spritzee's Moonblast from full HP and defensive Mienfoo's High Jump Kick after Stealth Rock damage. Berry Juice improves Vullaby's ability to sweep significantly and leaves it less vulnerable to priority attacks. Options such as Eviolite and Flyinium Z help Vullaby set up on even more attacks or nuke potential checks such as Spritzee, but they leave Vullaby much more vulnerable to priority attacks. Weak Armor is mandatory on this set, as Vullaby is unable to effectively sweep most teams without the Speed boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Vullaby can relatively easily find an opportunity to set up due to its solid Defense stat and plethora of resistances. Setting up against a physical sweeper is nearly always essential, as they are necessary to trigger Weak Armor. Checks such as Spritzee and Mareanie should be weakened before Vullaby attempts to sweep. Keep in mind that if the opponent knows that Vullaby is a Nasty Plot set, they may avoid attacking it to prevent the Speed boost, which leaves Vullaby open to revenge killing. However, due to the plethora of sets Vullaby can run, it won't be immediately obvious. As such, it is advisable to refrain from using Air Slash or Nasty Plot too early in the game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Nasty Plot Vullaby appreciates Pokemon that can weaken special walls like Spritzee and Mareanie. Mienfoo does so particularly well with Knock Off and also provides U-turn support for Vullaby to safely come in and set up. Entry hazard control is important as well; Pokemon such as Ferroseed and Onix can set Stealth Rock and Spikes to weaken switch-ins and help Vullaby get KOs on checks. These Pokemon also tend to bring in Fighting-types for Vullaby to set up on. Rapid Spin Staryu helps neutralize Vullaby's Stealth Rock weakness.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird and Knock Off form a strong STAB combination, allowing Vullaby to deal heavy damage to foes or soften them up by removing their items. U-turn lets Vullaby maintain offensive momentum. While being Choice-locked into Defog causes Vullaby and its team to lose momentum, Defog provides valuable entry hazard removal support in emergency situations. Hidden Power Grass is an offensive alternative that nails common Rock-type switch-ins such as Onix and Tirtouga.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A 236 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature give Vullaby good odds of OHKOing Timburr and Foongus after Stealth Rock damage and Mienfoo from full. 15 Speed allows Vullaby to outpace the entire unboosted metagame, as well as slower boosted Pokemon like Modest Choice Scarf Magnemite and +1 Torchic. A Jolly nature sacrifices raw power in exchange for outspeeding Timid Choice Scarf Magnemite and other 15 Speed Choice Scarf users. A Naive or Naughty nature can be run alongside Hidden Power Grass in order to guarantee the OHKO on SturdyJuice Onix after Stealth Rock damage, but it compromises Vullaby's good bulk. Overcoat allows Vullaby to switch into Spore from Foongus, though Weak Armor can be run to let Vullaby maintain its Speed advantage after being hit by Knock Off.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>With the existence of better late-game sweepers like Doduo and the opportunity cost of not running another Vullaby set, Choice Scarf Vullaby's niche relies on its surprise factor to net unsuspected KOs and put its team at an early advantage. Ideally, it should be put into positions where it can lure Mienfoo, Abra, and Staryu and KO them. A lack of Berry Juice or Eviolite means that this Vullaby set lacks longevity if played without caution, so Vullaby should attempt to avoid switching into even moderately strong neutral attacks. Careless use of Brave Bird, as well as switching into Stealth Rock, will also quickly reduce Vullaby's HP and put it into range of priority attacks. Vullaby is best served using Knock Off and U-turn early-game in order to chip away at its checks and build momentum for its team before attempting to clean a weakened team late-game with Brave Bird. Both Defog and Hidden Power Grass should be used sparingly, as they often give the opposing team at least one free turn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Diglett is an excellent partner for Vullaby due to its ability to trap and remove Steel-, Rock-, and Electric-types that check Vullaby, while Vullaby provides a safe opportunity for Diglett to enter the field with U-turn. Entry hazard setters allow Vullaby to achieve KOs and punishes switches that Choice Scarf Vullaby often causes. Due to Choice Scarf Vullaby's relative frailty compared to other sets, bulky teammates such as Ferroseed and Mudbray provide the team with ways to counter dangerous Pokemon, along with entry hazard support. Mienfoo makes a good partner, as it forms a pivoting core with Vullaby and deals with Pawniard. Strong but frail attackers such as Gastly greatly appreciate Vullaby's Knock Off and U-turn, while other Flying-types like Doduo can wear down shared Flying-resistant checks. Stealth Rock removal from Pokemon such as Staryu or Snivy is also appreciated to significantly increase Vullaby's longevity.</p>"

Its Speed is terrible, forcing it to use a Choice Scarf or risk being overrun by faster threats. While its defensive typing gives it useful resistances to Water, Grass, Electric, and Dark, its weaknesses to common Fighting- and Fairy-types only further limit its usefulness. Deino's reliance on Hustle as its main source of power means it is unreliable, ultimately leaving Deino as a poor choice in a metagame full of more potent threats.</p>",

Its reliance on Choice Scarf to be effective further hurts its ability to find a spot on a team. Overall, this set is outclassed by other wallbreakers like Rufflet, which also has Hustle and arguably better coverage, and Cranidos, which has a far superior Attack stat.

  "Larvesta": {
    "overview": "<p>Larvesta has all the tools to be a bulky pivot. It has access to two excellent STAB moves in U-turn and Flare Blitz, allowing it to pivot and hit hard. It can utilize these moves with its good Attack stat and great ability in Flame Body, which allows it to switch in on and pressure physical attackers. It can also come in easily on threats like Mienfoo, Pawniard, Snivy, and Snubbull. Additionally, reliable recovery in Morning Sun strengthens its role and increases its longevity. However, Larvesta has a few devastating flaws; namely, it is 4x weak to Stealth Rock and Rock-type coverage, such as Diglett's Rock Slide and Mienfoo's Stone Edge. It is also weak to common types like Flying and Water. It faces competition as a physical Fire-type from Ponyta, which is faster and less weak to Stealth Rock. Larvesta needs entry hazard removal to function, as otherwise it becomes dead weight. Finally, it rests at an awkward Speed tier and is unable to outspeed many of its foes, namely Doduo and Staryu.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Scarf set can be run for a more offensive approach; however, the loss of bulk really hurts Larvesta, and it faces competition as a fast, offensive Fire-type from Ponyta. Sunny Day increases Morning Sun's recovery, provides a stronger Flare Blitz, and reduces Larvesta's Water-type weakness. Toxic can be run to whittle down special attackers and Pokemon that can't be burned, like Chinchou or Ponyta, but Will-O-Wisp is generally better, as it halves Attack as well. Zen Headbutt hits Poison-types that resist Flare Blitz, like Skrelp and Mareanie, super effectively. Flame Charge can give Larvesta a shot against Diglett and boost its Speed at the cost of coverage. A special set with Fire Blast and Giga Drain exists, but its Special Attack is significantly lower than its Attack, and since Larvesta can't be burned, there isn't much of a reason to use it over the physical variant. Leech Life is a strong STAB move that offers extra recovery, but it struggles to find use over U-turn.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Setting up Stealth Rock ensures Larvesta can't switch in more than twice. Setters like Drilbur, Dwebble, Onix, and Archen can all set up Stealth Rock with little resistance on Larvesta.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Tirtouga, Onix, and Archen wall Larvesta and can deal serious damage back even if burned. Diglett's Rock Slide and Mienfoo's Stone Edge both OHKO Larvesta.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Mareanie and Chinchou wall Larvesta and essentially force a switch. However, they have to watch out for Wild Charge.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Larvesta struggles against Flying-types like Doduo and Vullaby, the former of which can OHKO with Brave Bird, while the latter can Knock Off Larvesta's Eviolite and take little damage from it. Nasty Plot Vullaby, in particular, doesn't fear getting burned and can set up on Larvesta. However, neither of them likes to switch into a Flare Blitz.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types resist both of Larvesta's STAB moves and can hit back harder. Ponyta can outstall Larvesta and do more damage with Flare Blitz. However, this can wear down Ponyta over time, since Larvesta can always U-turn out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is a powerful STAB move that can 2HKO notably bulky Pokemon like Mienfoo and Spritzee once they've lost their Eviolite. Morning Sun provides reliable recovery that keeps Larvesta healthy during the match. U-turn is another strong STAB move and allows Larvesta to switch out while doing damage, making it a good pivot. Will-O-Wisp is a more reliable way to get burns over Flame Body, while Wild Charge hits Water-types like Tirtouga and Skrelp so Larvesta isn't completely walled by them.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Eviolite increases Larvesta's bulk, letting it take key hits like Diglett's Rock Slide and Staryu's Scald. 76 HP EVs allow it to switch into Stealth Rock twice and survive. An alternative EV spread of 76 HP / 236 Def / 196 Spe with a Jolly nature allows Larvesta to reach 16 Speed, outspeeding Adamant Pawniard and most Vullaby. However, the bulk is generally better on this set, as it can take a Scald from Staryu, and Larvesta doesn't particularly need to outspeed these Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try not to switch Larvesta in on Stealth Rock; even with Morning Sun, it struggles to stay alive for prolonged periods of time when Stealth Rock is up. Do your best to keep entry hazards out in general, as Larvesta hates stacked hazards. Larvesta switches in on physical attackers like Pawniard and Mienfoo, but be aware that this is generally a predictable move, so plan accordingly. For example, using Will-O-Wisp can catch threats like Onix and Dwebble on the switch in. Another option is to use U-turn on a predicted switch to keep the momentum on your side. Use Morning Sun to keep Larvesta healthy and get more burns spread around the opposing team, but be aware that Morning Sun has low PP. Timburr may be a physical Fighting-type, but keep Larvesta away from it, as many Timburr carry Guts, so a burn will have the opposite effect on it. Don't be afraid to hard switch instead of using U-turn, especially if you're up against a faster Flying-, Water-, or Rock-type like Staryu, Doduo, or Onix. Also, while Larvesta can easily switch in on most Fighting-types, be wary, since most of them carry Knock Off, and Larvesta really needs its Eviolite. Be careful when facing hail and sand teams, as Morning Sun will heal less.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Any and all entry hazard removal is appreciated for Larvesta. Defoggers like Archen and Vullaby help out, as well as spinners like Drilbur. Staryu, in particular, can not only spin away hazards but also beat many Fire-types and Rock-types. Since Larvesta is a slow pivot, frail offensive Pokemon like Abra, Snivy, and Gastly appreciate its U-turn. Choice Scarf users like Bunnelby, which is frail and unable to switch in on most attacks on its own, can utilize Larvesta's U-turn as well. Chinchou and Magnemite are great partners, as they not only form a VoltTurn core with Larvesta but also switch in on Flying-, Water-, and Rock-types. Rock-type switch-ins like Mudbray and Mienfoo are extremely helpful to patch up Larvesta's quadruple weakness. Onix is a great teammate, as it can switch in on Flying-types, Taunt Stealth Rock users, and set up its own hazards. Water-type switch-ins like Ferroseed and Mareanie are also helpful. Diglett can trap and revenge kill many threats, including Chinchou, Ponyta, Mareanie, Skrelp, and Salandit, which otherwise wall Larvesta.</p>"

  "Chespin": {
    "overview": "<p>Chespin is a pretty weak Pokemon overall, but it has a few niches that allow it to remain usable in the current metagame. Chespin's ability, Bulletproof, allows it to counter several prominent Pokemon in LC like Foongus and Gastly that do not use Will-O-Wisp and Hex. Chespin can also set up Spikes while simultaneously having consistent recovery in Synthesis. In addition, it is able to check Ground-types like Drilbur and non-RestTalk Mudbray. Chespin's mono-Grass typing, however, makes it weak to both Flying- and Fire-types like Doduo, Rufflet, and Ponyta without being able to damage them very much. It also faces competition from other Spikes setters like Omanyte and Ferroseed, since they can set other entry hazards in addition to Spikes. Chespin is also very mediocre stat-wise, and it faces competition both offensively and defensively from Pokemon like Pumpkaboo-XL, Ferroseed, and Foongus. Finally, Chespin's Speed is fairly low, which affects its ability to put offensive pressure on the opponent.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Chespin can run a Bulk Up set, but its mediocre Attack and coverage make this not very good. It can also use Berry Juice along with a fully offensive set on Chespin instead of Synthesis, but Chespin really likes having the bulk and constant recovery; as such, this is only a good idea on extremely offensive teams. Wood Hammer is an option for Chespin, but it makes Chespin take recoil damage and thus decreases longevity; Chespin is more of a defensive Pokemon rather than an offensive one, so Seed Bomb is generally better. If Chespin wants to hit Grass- and Fighting-types, it can run Aerial Ace, but the added coverage on mono-Grass types is typically not too useful when compared to the coverage Zen Headbutt provides. Poison Jab is an option for Chespin to hit Grass- and Fairy-types. To be a phazer as well as a hazard setter, Chespin can run Roar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Ponyta don't take much from any of Chespin's attacks aside from Rock Slide and can OHKO or deal massive damage to it with a super effective move.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types like Vullaby, Doduo, and Rufflet don't take much from any of Chespin's attacks bar Rock Slide and can OHKO or deal massive damage to it with a super effective move.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: If Chespin is not using Drain Punch, it will be barely able to even dent Steel-types, as both Seed Bomb and Zen Headbutt hit them not very effectively. Pokemon like Pawniard and Ferroseed will either greatly resist or be immune to one of these two main moves as well.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Although the Water-type Shell Smash users have a hard time setting up on Chespin, almost all other setup sweepers can easily do so and proceed to sweep your team.</p>",

      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Seed Bomb gains a STAB bonus and lets Chespin hit Water-, Rock-, and Ground-type Pokemon like Chinchou, Tirtouga, and Onix. Zen Headbutt allows Chespin to counter Foongus and most Gastly sets as well as checking Croagunk, hitting all of them super effectively. Synthesis is a reliable source of recovery, increasing Chespin's longevity and helping it wall more Pokemon. Spikes helps Chespin's team deal continual damage to the opponent's Pokemon as they switch in and also breaks Sturdy for Pokemon on the opposing team. Drain Punch lets Chespin hit Steel-types like Pawniard and Magnemite and Ice-types like Alolan Vulpix and Alolan Sandshrew. Rock Slide is a coverage move that helps Chespin patch up its weakness to Flying- and Fire-types like Doduo and Ponyta by hitting them super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Bulletproof, Chespin's ability, is the main reason it is useful; it allows Chespin to not be hit by ball and bomb moves, letting it wall Foongus and most Gastly sets. Chespin is equipped with an Eviolite and the given EV spread to maximize its bulk.The majority of Chespin's EVs are invested in Special Defense to help Chespin tank special hits from the Pokemon that it walls the majority of the time like Gastly's Dazzling Gleam and Foongus's Hidden Power Fire and Clear Smog. The remaining EVs are put in HP to let Chespin take more hits and Attack so Chespin can hit opposing Pokemon harder.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Chespin in on the Pokemon it typically counters like Gastly and Foongus. Be wary, though, as Chespin may be unable to switch in on Gastly if it is the Will-O-Wisp + Hex variant. You can also switch in Chespin on bulky Water-types like Slowpoke and Mareanie, as it resists their Water-type STAB moves and can hit them super effectively. When Chespin is up against a Pokemon that it walls like Croagunk, you can have it set up Spikes or just hit the opposing Pokemon with a super effective move. When Chespin's HP is low, switch it out or use Synthesis to heal HP (if it is up against a Pokemon that cannot deal much damage to it). Keep Chespin away from Flying- and Fire-types like Doduo, Vullaby, Rufflet, Ponyta, and Houndour because they resist Grass-type moves and can OHKO Chespin with their STAB moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon like Onix and Archen that resist Chespin's weaknesses in Fire- and Flying-types and can also hit those types hard are very good teammates. Chinchou is an excellent teammate, since it counters many of the Pokemon that Chespin has a hard time dealing with like Ponyta and Doduo, while Chespin resists all of Chinchou's weaknesses. Setup sweepers like Omanyte and Tirtouga appreciate the entry hazards that Chespin can provide and also cover many of Chespin's weaknesses. Spinblockers and Defiant Pokemon like Gastly, Frillish, and Pawniard can deter opponents from trying to get rid of the Spikes that Chespin can set up and are thus good Pokemon to have on its team.</p>"

Aditionally, its decent Speed in conjunction with a Choice Scarf or Sticky Web support allow it to outspeed many important threats and effectively revenge kill as well. Due to its high Attack and coverage it is hard to switch into, but some common Pokemon, such as Onix, Ferroseed, and Pumpkaboo-XL can still easily come in. Additionally, Fighting-types such as Timburr and Mienfoo can easily force Bunnelby out, forcing Bunnelby's team to lose some momentum, and if it is being run on an offensive team, that can be hard to deal with. Finally, it has very low bulk, meaning it is very hard to get it in without U-turn or Volt Switch.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Endeavor can possibly be used to try to heavily weaken the foe if Bunnelby is weakened, but it is hard to get Bunnelby to low health without it getting KOed. Wild Charge is another coverage option that one can consider to deal with Archen, Vullaby, and Frillish, but it deals recoil damage, which can be taken advantage of if Bunnelby is Choice locked into it or can whittle down Bunnelby's health faster if it is using a Life Orb. Bounce can be used to hit Fighting-types and bulky Grass-types; however, it sometimes does not get the KO, and Return already hits very hard. Bounce is also incredibly obvious and the opponent will have a free turn to switch to a Flying-resistant Pokemon. Brick Break is an option to hit Steel-types such as Pawniard and Ferroseed, but most of the time, Earthquake is better. Bunnelby has access to several boosting moves such as Bulk Up and Agility, but these sets are all vulnerable to priority and very hard to set up properly. However, once priority users have been dealt with and entry hazards have been set up, these sets can become very powerful. Bunnelby has access to Spikes, but it does not have that much bulk, which means it does not have many opportunities to set Spikes up. A set with Salac Berry and Endure can be very threatening if opposing priority users have been removed, but it is very hard to pull off such a set successfully and usually is not worth it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Bunnelby's poor bulk means that priority moves such as Mach Punch and Sucker Punch can KO it after very little prior damage. Timburr and Pawniard are two Pokemon that typically carry priority moves.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types have a hard time repeatedly switching into Bunnelby, but once they are able to get in safely, they can threaten and usually OHKO Bunnelby. Timburr and Croagunk are especially scary because of their Fighting-type priority moves, Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Even though most Ghost-type Pokemon are KOed by Bunnelby's coverage moves, most can take advantage of Bunnelby being locked into a Normal-type attack. Gastly can set up a Substitute and fire off powerful attacks while Pumpkaboo-S can set up with Z-Trick or Treat and sweep. Other Ghost-types such as Pumpkaboo-XL and Frillish are very bulky and completely wall Bunnelby.</p> <p><strong>Ferroseed</strong>: Ferroseed's incredible bulk and typing lets it come in on all of Bunnelby's attacks, except Earthquake, which hits Ferroseed quite hard. It also punishes Bunnelby's contact moves, such as Return and U-turn, with Iron Barbs, whittling it down so it can be picked off with priority later. Ferroseed can set up entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes on Bunnelby or cripple it with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Being burned or paralyzed will completely ruin Bunnelby's offensive presence, essentially making it useless until its status has been healed, which is difficult to do most of the time. It also lacks the bulk to effectively stall through sleep turns and will usually be relegated to being fodder.</p>",

An Adamant nature allows Bunnelby to hit insanely hard, while a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed other common Choice Scarf users such as Scraggy and Magnemite. The EV spread gives Bunnelby the most Attack and Speed possible, while the rest of the EVs are put into Defense to help deal with priority attacks a bit better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bunnelby's main use in the early-game is to try to wear down its own checks with U-turn and revenge kill. Once priority users such as Pawniard and Timburr and Pokemon that resist Return such as Archen and Gastly have been removed, Bunnelby can sweep with Return. It is critical that you remove priority users because most of them can KO Bunnelby after minimal damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit support from Pokemon such as Pawniard, Alolan Grimer, and Stunky helps greatly in allowing Bunnelby to clean late-game with Return. Diglett can help trap and KO the Rock- and Steel-types that resist Return. A check to Fighting-types is very important when using Bunnelby, as many of them can beat it; Mareanie, Spritzee, and Foongus all are good choices for one. Any Pokemon that can beat common priority move users, especially Pawniard and Timburr, is very helpful. Ponyta is able to beat them both, and the Fighting-type checks listed before can beat Timburr. Entry hazards enable Bunnelby to KO Pokemon that rely on Sturdy and provide enough chip damage to obtain important 2HKOs. Dwebble and Onix are two excellent Pokemon that can help Bunnelby get them up. VoltTurn cores pair nicely with Bunnelby, as they can get it in safely and also check Pokemon that beat it, such as Larvesta, which checks Fighting-types. Hazard stacking also works well with Bunnelby, as it forces a lot of switches.</p>"

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is Bunnelby's strongest and best STAB option and hits incredibly hard, nearly 2HKOing the entire metagame. Quick Attack is vital for revenge killing many frail Pokemon such as Carvanha as well as picking off weakened Pokemon. Earthquake provides excellent coverage with Return, hitting many Steel- and Rock-types that resist Bunnelby's Normal-type STAB moves. Iron Head can be used to hit Archen and Ghost-types that resist or are immune to both Return and Earthquake.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs give Bunnelby the most Attack and Speed possible; the rest are put into Defense to help deal with priority attacks a bit better. Reduced HP IVs make sure that Bunnelby takes less Life Orb recoil. Giving Bunnelby a Life Orb makes its already very strong attacks even stronger making it hard to switch into. An Adamant nature helps Bunnelby hit as hard as possible, though a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed SturdyJuice Magnemite and Speed tie with Pawniard.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to avoid switching Bunnelby into a direct attack; otherwise, it will get KOed quickly due to its low bulk and its tendency to be worn down by Life Orb recoil. Use slow pivots such as Mienfoo and Chinchou to bring Bunnelby in safely. Quick Attack is useful for revenge killing weakened enemy Pokemon. Bunnelby is ridiculously strong and is capable of 2HKOing the entire metagame.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Life Orb Bunnelby pairs well with Sticky Web because its mediocre Speed tier does not allow it to handle the faster threats in LC. Surskit is considered the best option for Sticky Web support, but Spinarak and Sewaddle can also set up Sticky Web. Pursuit support from Pawniard, Alolan Grimer, and Stunky help weaken Pokemon to allow for a late-game sweep with Return. Pokemon such as Mienfoo and Chinchou can use U-turn or Volt Switch to allow Bunnelby to switch in more often. Depending on what Bunnelby chooses as a coverage move, a teammate to handle Archen and Ghost-types may be necessary. Pawniard can handle Archen easily and can also Pursuit trap Ghost-types. A Z-Memento user such as Cottonee can be used to get Bunnelby in safely and restore it to full health. Hazard removal support would help keep Bunnelby healthy, as it is already prone to being worn down from Life Orb recoil. Staryu and Vullaby can help keep hazards off the field. Entry hazard support is also useful because it helps whittle down the foe so that Bunnelby can sweep with Return; Dwebble and Onix are two Pokemon that are good at setting them up.</p>"

  "Fletchling": {
    "overview": "<p>With a good ability and a relatively good movepool, Fletchling theoretically should be one of the best revenge killers in Little Cup as well as a good setup sweeper. Its relatively good offensive stats help it even more with this. However, it's held back by a weakness to Stealth Rock and is mostly outclassed by the many other good Flying-types in the tier. Although it is a shadow of its former self, it still has a niche as a sweeper and revenge killer with its good priority.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fletchling can set up a Tailwind easily, but it doesn't last long enough to really be worth wasting a moveslot. Using Natural Gift with Salac or Apicot Berry to lure in and remove Rock-types has a very small niche, but it isn't recommended because it takes up a move and item slot. Taunt can be used to stop other Pokemon from setting up on Fletchling, but it can't do much afterwards. Steel Wing could be used to hit an incoming Archen, but it doesn't hit many other threats. Snatch can take the setup moves of common Shell Smash users that like to set up on Fletchling, but it doesn't do much more than Taunt does.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Common attackers such as Magnemite and Chinchou can switch into Fletchling easily unless it is running Overheat or Hidden Power Grass (although this still doesn't do much damage to it), respectively, and easily OHKO it in return. Electric-types also provide great momentum to the opponent with Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Most Rock-types are bulky and can switch into everything Fletchling can use bar Hidden Power Grass and defeat it in return, but even frailer Rock-types like Cranidos can revenge kill it easily. Many Rock-types also set up Stealth Rock, which is a very big problem for Fletchling because it nullifies Gale Wings.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Similarly to Rock-types, Steel-types are usually bulky, can take most moves Fletchling uses other than Overheat, and are generally troublesome. Pawniard and Honedge in particular are troublesome with Stealth Rock and Swords Dance, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Mudbray, Mareanie, and even Ferroseed when Fletchling isn't carrying Flame Charge can be troublesome to break through without being assisted by wallbreakers.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: All passive damage can break Gale Wings. Sand, hail, and Ferroseed's Iron Barbs are good examples. Stealth Rock especially is extremely hard for Fletchling to deal with and is extremely potent in Little Cup.</p>",

      "Bulky Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Acrobatics is Fletchling's best STAB move and takes advantage of Gale Wings to make Fletchling a better sweeper. Swords Dance helps Fletchling sweep by boosting its Attack. U-turn helps Fletchling pivot on some of its common switch-ins such as Chinchou and Mudbray. Flame Charge lets Fletchling boost its Speed to continue a sweep after its Gale Wings is deactivated and allows it to hit Ferroseed. Substitute allows Fletchling to activate its Berry Juice on demand. Overheat is used to hit Steel-types such as Ferroseed and Magnemite and is a powerful move in general. Hidden Power Grass hits Rock-types such as Tirtouga and Onix as well as certain other problematic Pokemon like Mudbray and Chinchou.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Berry Juice enables Fletchling to restore its HP to full when it is damaged to less than half HP, but an item can be completely left out so that Fletchling can automatically have a maximum-power Acrobatics. The Speed EV investment maximizes the Speed gained from Flame Charge and allows Fletchling to outspeed Croagunk and certain Timburr variants. It also has near-maximum Attack and an Adamant nature so it can eliminate more threats such as Croagunk that have taken Stealth Rock damage and faster Mienfoo while also having a much better chance to OHKO Snivy. The rest is put into Defense so Fletchling can survive longer. If using Overheat or Hidden Power Grass, be sure to use an EV spread of 76 HP / 200 Atk / 12 Def / 40 SpA / 180 Spe with an Adamant nature. The Gale Wings ability is Fletchling's main niche, giving it priority on Acrobatics, and should always be used.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Setting up a Swords Dance on a Pokemon you know cannot OHKO Fletchling is usually a good option, as if Berry Juice is consumed, Fletchling may find an opening to sweep. If Stealth Rock is not up, Fletchling makes for quite a good revenge killer. Conserving Fletchling for the late-game is usually a good idea, as it benefits greatly from opposing Pokemon being weakened. Use U-turn on predicted switches to help gain momentum. Be wary of using Flame Charge on Pokemon that can KO Fletchling, as it isn't a very powerful move. Flame Charge is more suited to getting a hit for a guaranteed KO or being used on a target that's weak to it and isn't weak to Acrobatics such as Ferroseed (be aware that Iron Barbs damage will nullify Gale Wings, however). Don't use Substitute if Berry Juice has been consumed, as you can't get Fletchling back up to full health easily, and when using it, it is a good idea to set up a Swords Dance after doing so. It is almost never a good idea to carelessly switch Fletchling into attacks due to its poor bulk and ruining Gale Wings. However, if Fletchling has already taken damage, switching it back in to activate Berry Juice can have the reverse effect.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Although they are niche, Pokemon using Z-Memento or Z-Parting Shot can bring Fletchling back up to full health and restore its Gale Wings ability. Rapid Spin and Defog users are almost essential to keep Fletchling healthy; Drilbur in particular can check Electric- and Rock-types for it, but Staryu is more consistent. Fletching pairs well with other offensive Flying-types such as Rowlet and Doduo, as they can wear down each other's checks. Slow U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Mienfoo and Chinchou are extremely helpful, as they can get Fletchling in without taking any damage. Knock Off support from Pawniard and the aforementioned Mienfoo can help cripple opposing walls for Fletchling to more easily deal with them. Slowpoke and Chinchou can use Thunder Wave on opposing Pokemon so Fletchling can outspeed many more threats as well as potentially obtain a free turn. Diglett can eliminate Steel-, Electric-, and Rock-types that can be a very big problem for Fletchling.</p>"

  "Pancham": {

Its wide movepool also includes Swords Dance, which can potentially turn it into a powerful wallbreaker or, with Sticky Web support, even a sweeper, and good coverage options such as Gunk Shot and Zen Headbutt, setting it apart from other Fighting-types.</p> <p>However, despite these unique traits, Pancham faces stiff competition as a Fighting-type from Mienfoo and Timburr, of which the former is faster and has Regenerator, giving it a form of recovery, and the latter has Guts and priority in Mach Punch, mitigating its low Speed and giving it an easier time setting up. Pancham also suffers from a low Speed stat, which means it is usually forced to take a hit before attacking and thus easily worn down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Darkinium Z can be used on the pivot set for Z-Parting Shot, which heals Pancham's incoming teammate up to full HP, in addition to Parting Shot's normal effect of lowering the foe's stats. In the late-game, this can guarantee a sweep by a teammate like Shellder. However, Pancham is too slow to properly use such a strategy, and it also does not appreciate the lack of Eviolite. A Choice Scarf set with Parting Shot, Drain Punch, Knock Off, and either Gunk Shot or Zen Headbutt can be used to take advantage of Parting Shot. With a spread of 180 Atk / 20 Def / 52 SpD / 252 Spe and an Adamant nature, Pancham hits 14 Speed, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame with a Choice Scarf. A set like that should focus on taking advantage of Parting Shot to grab momentum for Pancham's teammates. An all-out attacking set with Drain Punch, Knock Off, Gunk Shot, and Zen Headbutt can surprise both Fairy- and Poison-type switch-ins, but Pancham is too slow to utilize such a set very well. A RestTalk set with Circle Throw and Bulk Up can be used, but it is usually outclassed by the Swords Dance set listed above. This set should be used with the ability Scrappy so that it is not completely walled by Ghost-types. Superpower and Storm Throw can both be used over Drain Punch on any set for their greater power, but the recovery Drain Punch gives is preferred most of the time. Pancham also has access to other coverage moves not listed above; Ice Punch and Stone Edge could be used to hit Flying-types such as Vullaby, but Drain Punch is neutral on most targets of these moves and they are thus usually inferior to Gunk Shot and Zen Headbutt. Iron Head is a more accurate option than Gunk Shot to hit Fairy types, but the lower power means it misses out on the 2HKO on Spritzee and Eviolite Snubbull as well as the OHKO on Cottonee.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Foongus and Mareanie can both take most moves from Pancham easily and threaten it with Spore or a Scald burn. However, they do not like having their Eviolite removed by Knock Off and need to watch out for Zen Headbutt.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: If Pancham lacks Gunk Shot, it is unable to hurt Fairy-types such as Spritzee, Snubbull, and Cottonee. In return, they can force it out with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster, powerful attackers such as Doduo, Rufflet, Vullaby, Gastly, and Abra are all capable of easily revenge killing Pancham. All of these except for Abra are also immune to Sticky Web, meaning that they will outspeed Pancham no matter what.</p> <p><strong>Parting Shot Switch-ins</strong>: Snivy and Pawniard can both get boosts if they switch into Parting Shot thanks to their respective abilities in Contrary and Defiant. However, Pawniard must be wary of switching into Pancham, as Drain Punch will OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp Users</strong>: Ponyta and Larvesta can both take any of Pancham's moves with ease, and proceed to burn it with Will-O-Wisp, severely crippling it for the rest of the match.</p>",

      "Parting Shot Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Parting Shot allows Pancham to easily pivot, as the stat drops can give a teammate such as a setup sweeper a free switch. Drain Punch is the STAB move of choice, as it is boosted by Iron Fist and gives Pancham a form of recovery. Knock Off hits the Ghost-types that are immune to Drain Punch super effectively and provides incredible utility in removing a foe's item. Gunk Shot can hit the Fairy-types that can easily take any of Pancham's other moves very hard, notably 2HKOing Spritzee and non-Berry Juice Snubbull and OHKOing Cottonee. Zen Headbutt is another option that hits the Poison-types that resist Drain Punch as well as opposing Fighting-types super effectively, always 2HKOing Mareanie and nearly always 2HKOing Timburr and Mienfoo.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite enhances Pancham's already solid bulk, thus allowing it to stay alive longer in a match. 180 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature are used to maximize Pancham's Attack, meaning it hits as hard as possible while recovering a lot of HP with Drain Punch. The defensive EVs allow Pancham to survive Psychic from Focus Sash Abra as well as Icicle Spear from +2 Shellder. 12 Speed EVs give Pancham 11 Speed, making it outspeed Timburr, Skrelp, and Snubbull. Iron Fist increases Drain Punch's damage, allowing Pancham to 2HKO Alolan Grimer and non-Eviolite Vullaby, as well as OHKO both Doduo and Archen after Stealth Rock, with Drain Punch. Mold Breaker is another option to remove items from Sticky Hold users such as Trubbish and OHKO Magnemite through Sturdy.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pancham can be switched in on the Pokemon it threatens, such as Pawniard, Ferroseed, and Tirtouga, to create opportunities to dent the opponent's walls or generate momentum with Parting Shot. However, Pancham tends to get worn down quickly, so be careful not to switch it in too often and to preserve it for the threats it needs to beat. Be careful of using Parting Shot if the opponent has a Pawniard or Snivy: they both get offensive boosts if they are hit by the move. In the late-game, Parting Shot should be used to pivot into a powerful cleaner such as Shellder or Nasty Plot Vullaby, as the stat drops can give them the opportunity they need to set up and win the game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Setup sweepers that only need one turn to potentially win a game, such as Nasty Plot Vullaby, Swords Dance Pawniard, and Shell Smash Shellder, appreciate Parting Shot to get them in with a free switch and lower the opponent's stats. Pawniard is especially notable, as it can set up on the Fairy-types Pancham lures in. Users of Volt Switch and U-turn, such as Chinchou and Mienfoo, can form momentum cores with Pancham. Diglett is also a good partner for Pancham, as it can be brought in safely with Parting Shot and trap the Poison-types that resist Drain Punch. If Pancham is running Zen Headbutt over Gunk Shot, Gastly is a great teammate, as it is capable of taking advantage of Parting Shot if it is used on the Fairy-types that Pancham lures in, such as Spritzee, Snubbull, and Cottonee, by setting up a Substitute. It also appreciates Pancham threatening Pawniard and Munchlax.</p>"

      "Swords Dance Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Pancham's Attack, allowing it to effectively break down the opponent's walls. Drain Punch is Pancham's main STAB move, as it complements its solid natural bulk by giving it recovery. Knock Off hits the Ghost-types that are immune to Drain Punch and removes the foe's item, giving Pancham nice utility. Gunk Shot hits Fairy-type switch-ins such as Spritzee, Snubbull, and Cottonee very hard, OHKOing Cottonee and 2HKOing Spritzee and non-Berry Juice variants of Snubbull. Alternatively, Zen Headbutt hits Poison-types such as Mareanie, which is always 2HKOed by it, and Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr, which are nearly always 2HKOed, super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite is the item of choice, as it enhances Pancham's solid bulk, giving it more opportunities to set up. 180 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature maximize Pancham's Attack, allowing it to dent the opponent's team as much as possible while getting the maximum possible HP back from Drain Punch. The Defense and Special Defense EVs give Pancham good bulk, allowing it to survive +2 Shellder's Icicle Spear and Focus Sash Abra's Psychic. If Pancham's teammates can provide Sticky Web support, an alternative spread of 180 Atk / 20 Def / 52 SpD / 252 Spe should be used, as it hits 14 Speed, allowing Pancham to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame after Sticky Web. Mold Breaker is used to remove items from Sticky Hold users such as Trubbish with Knock Off and bypass Magnemite's Sturdy to OHKO it. Iron Fist is also an option to 2HKO Alolan Grimer and OHKO both Doduo and Archen after Stealth Rock. It also guarantees the OHKO on Alolan Grimer and Abra with Drain Punch after one Swords Dance.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pancham should be brought in on Pokemon it threatens out, such as Pawniard, Ferroseed, and Tirtouga. The opportunities created by these forced switches should be used to dent the opponent's switch-in and remove items in the early-game. In the late-game, these opportunities should be used to set up a Swords Dance to sweep the opponent's team or remove walls for your sweeper. If Pancham is being used as a wallbreaker for your team, setting up a Swords Dance can be useful, as it allows Pancham to power through walls even more quickly. Since Pancham will usually not be using Drain Punch on forced switches with this set, it tends to be worn down very quickly. As such, it should not be used as the primary counter for any Pokemon, but should instead focus on wallbreaking with the power boost from Swords Dance. If your team has Sticky Web, Pancham should be preserved until the late-game in order to set up a Swords Dance and sweep the opponent's team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pancham greatly appreciates Sticky Web support from Pokemon like Surskit and Spinarak, as it allows it to outspeed most of the opponent's team and potentially sweep in the late-game. Other Knock Off users are also appreciated, as they can remove Eviolites, giving Pancham an easier time wallbreaking, and Choice Scarves, allowing Pancham to clean more easily in the late-game on a Sticky Web team. Another Fighting-type such as Mienfoo can work very well with Pancham. Thanks to them sharing counters and having powerful attacks, those counters will often be worn down over the course of a match, meaning it will be unable to counter both. In addition, the two will also easily be able to deal with Dark-type cores. Pivots such as Chinchou, Mienfoo, and Foongus work very well with Pancham, as they can get it in on a free switch quite easily. Chinchou also deals with the Flying-types that threaten Pancham and are immune to Sticky Web. Pursuit users such as Munchlax and Alolan Grimer can trap Psychic- and Ghost-types for Pancham, giving it an easier time cleaning. Diglett is also a great partner for Pancham, as it can trap and KO the Poison-types that wall it, such as Mareanie and Trubbish. Lastly, since Pancham is weak to burns, it appreciates a cleric like Spritzee or Chinchou. The former of these can also pass Wishes to Pancham, improving its longevity, thus allowing it to wallbreak for longer over the course of a match, while the latter is capable of pivoting into Pancham with Volt Switch.</p>"

Honedge also has a good movepool, which includes coverage options in Sacred Sword and Rock Slide to complement its STAB moves, Pursuit to trap and KO Abra while being immune to Counter from Focus Sash variants, and Swords Dance to boost its already good Attack stat.

In addition, these moves are often run as coverage by Pokemon it would otherwise be able to check, such as Fighting-types like Mienfoo and Rock-types like Dwebble. Honedge also lacks any form of recovery outside of Berry Juice, which in combination with its bad Special Defense, leaves it open to being worn down, and its STAB moves have low Base Power and only average coverage, meaning that despite its good Attack stat, it's unable to deal significant damage to a big portion of the metagame. Lastly, Honedge faces a lot of competition from other Steel-types like Ferroseed, which has access to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Thunder Wave, as well as Pursuit trappers like Alolan Grimer, which has a more powerful Pursuit thanks to it being STAB, access to STAB Knock Off, and a great ability in Poison Touch.</p>",

Destiny Bond can be used alongside Autotomize in order to take out a Pokemon that would normally get a free KO on Honedge, but it is unreliable and takes up valuable moveslots. A set utilizing RestTalk to give Honedge recovery may seem alluring, but Honedge is not bulky enough to make proper use of it. Magnet Rise can be used to avoid Ground-type moves, but it is hard to fully utilize due to Honedge's low Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: While many Dark-types don't switch into Honedge very easily due to Sacred Sword, they significantly threaten it with Knock Off and thus usually force it out. Vullaby can also switch into any of Honedge's moves outside of Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types like Mienfoo and Timburr do not take much damage from any of Honedge's moves and can threaten it with Knock Off. Some, such as Timburr and Pancham, can also set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Ponyta and Larvesta can easily switch into Honedge and threaten it with a burn, though they have to be wary of Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Burns</strong>: If Honedge is burned, it is significantly crippled, as it will be unable to do much damage and also gets whittled down. In addition, the Fire- and Water-types that can burn it with Will-O-Wisp and Scald respectively, like Ponyta and Chinchou, can also easily switch into it.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Honedge has no way of dealing a lot of damage to bulky Ground-types like Mudbray and Hippopotas, while they can threaten it with their super effective STAB moves.</p>",

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shadow Sneak is a STAB priority move that hits Psychic-types such as Abra and Ghost-types such as Gastly super effectively, OHKOing Abra and Life Orb Gastly and Hex Gastly after Stealth Rock. Iron Head is Honedge's most powerful move and hits Fairy- and Rock-types super effectively, 2HKOing Spritzee and Eviolite Snubbull, while Berry Juice Dwebble is OHKOed if its Sturdy is broken. Sacred Sword can be used to hit Steel-types like Pawniard and Ferroseed, both of which can take Honedge's STAB moves with ease, super effectively, OHKOing Pawniard and 2HKOing Ferroseed after minor prior damage. Rock Slide is an option to hit Pokemon such as Vullaby and Fire-types like Ponyta and Larvesta super effectively, which are otherwise able to check Honedge; it 2HKOes Vullaby and Ponyta after Stealth Rock and OHKOes Larvesta after Stealth Rock. Pursuit can be used to trap frail Pokemon such as Abra, either knocking them out or significantly weakening them, making it harder for them to do their job. Swords Dance boosts Honedge's Attack by two stages, allowing its STAB moves to deal significant damage to even very bulky Pokemon, as it will 2HKO Mudbray through Stamina, Timburr, and bulky Mienfoo and OHKO Spritzee with Iron Head while 2HKOing Slowpoke with Shadow Sneak; this can give it a good shot at sweeping. Shadow Claw can be used over Shadow Sneak in order to OHKO Pumpkaboo-XL and nearly always OHKO Slowpoke after Stealth Rock if Honedge has a Swords Dance boost, but due to Honedge's low Speed, Shadow Sneak's priority is usually more valuable.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite is usually the item of choice, as in combination with the Special Defense investment, it allows Honedge to always survive one Hidden Power Ground from Life Orb Abra and one Dark Pulse from unboosted Nasty Plot Vullaby; in combination with the Defense investment, it allows Honedge to survive one Knock Off from non-Life Orb Pawniard and Vullaby. In addition, the Defense and Special Defense EVs hit Eviolite numbers, which maximizes Honedge's bulk. Berry Juice can be used to give Honedge a form of recovery, increasing its longevity slightly but leaving it usually OHKOed by the aforementioned moves. Berry Juice also synergizes well with Swords Dance, as it can bring Honedge back up to full HP if it takes a hit while setting up. 116 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature allow Honedge to hit as hard as possible, notably 2HKOing Spritzee with Iron Head and usually OHKOing Life Orb Gastly with Shadow Sneak. The leftover EVs are put into HP and Speed to raise both by one point. The Speed EVs notably let it outspeed Spritzee and Snubbull.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Honedge's role compression allows it to do many things for its team depending on what is needed, such as switching into and Pursuit trapping Abra, checking Flying-types like Rufflet and Doduo, and wallbreaking thanks to its high Attack stat and access to Swords Dance. Be careful of Honedge being worn down, as it doesn't have any form of recovery. As such, also try to avoid getting burned, as this will make Honedge significantly weaker and wear it down quickly. Because of this, Honedge should avoid attacking Flame Body users such as Ponyta and Larvesta. Shadow Sneak can be used to revenge kill threats that are weak to Ghost, such as Abra and Gastly, as well as other foes if they are weakened enough. The combination of Shadow Sneak and Pursuit can create mind games in the matchup against Gastly; however, Honedge has to be very careful, as Gastly can easily knock it out if you mispredict. Always try to avoid Knock Off users like Mienfoo and Vullaby unless it is to lure them with a super effective coverage move, as Knock Off will not only deal significant damage to Honedge but also cripple it by removing its item. Honedge has a plethora of resistances, so these should be taken advantage of to get Honedge into play against Psychic- and Fairy-types. However, it should still be wary of super effective coverage on Pokemon it can otherwise check, such as Abra and Snubbull.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Honedge should be used on teams that require a check to Psychic-, Fairy-, and Flying-types as well as a Pursuit trapper in only one teamslot. Pokemon that appreciate Honedge checking these synergize well with it; examples include Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr and Dark-types such as Vullaby and Pawniard. Fighting-types can also switch into the Dark-types that Honedge fears, while Dark-types switch into Ghost-types. Fairy-types like Spritzee and Snubbull appreciate Honedge checking Steel- and Poison-types, and in return, they can switch into Dark-types for it. Spritzee can also heal Honedge with Wish and remove burns with Aromatherapy. Flying- and Grass-types like Vullaby, Foongus, and Snivy can switch into Ground-types, and in the case of Grass-types, can KO them. Water-types like Chinchou and Mareanie and Rock-types like Onix can switch into the Fire-types that Honedge fears. Rock-types also appreciate Honedge checking Steel-types, while Chinchou can provide Heal Bell support for Honedge. Pokemon that appreciate Honedge trapping Abra with Pursuit such as Fighting-types like Mienfoo and Poison-types like Foongus, pair well with it. Knock Off users like the aforementioned Fighting-types as well as Dark-types like Pawniard and Vullaby can help Honedge by crippling defensive Pokemon by removing their Eviolite, allowing Honedge to wallbreak much more easily.</p>"

  "Spritzee": {
    "overview": "<p>Spritzee has a solid place in the metagame thanks to its good bulk and fantastic Fairy typing, allowing it to check the ever-present Fighting- and Dark-type moves that dominate the LC metagame. Additionally, Spritzee has fantastic defensive synergy with other prominent defensive Pokemon in the metagame, allowing it to form backbones to support defensive, balanced, and bulky offensive teams. Spritzee also has access to Wish, giving it both a semi-reliable form of recovery and the ability to support its team. Coupled with Aromatherapy, Wish helps Spritzee become the best cleric in the LC metagame. Spritzee can even act as a late-game wincon with access to Calm Mind. Its ability Aroma Veil doesn't hurt either, giving it an immunity to moves that would typically take down defensive Pokemon, including Taunt and Encore.</p> <p>Spritzee is held back, however, by several key flaws. Spritzee is essentially forced to rely on Moonblast as its sole attack, which leaves it easily walled by many of the Poison-, Steel-, and Fire-types that resist it. Even against Pokemon that don't resist its attack, Spritzee lacks offensive power without Calm Mind boosts, leaving it open to be setup fodder for key Pokemon. A limited movepool makes Spritzee quite predictable and easy to prepare for as well, meaning that most teams are equipped to handle it. In addition, because of its role as a Fighting-type check, Spritzee usually is hit by Knock Off during a match, depriving it of its Eviolite and thus limiting its defensive capabilities for the rest of the match.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fighting and Hidden Power Fire can surprise Pawniard and Ferroseed, respectively, but they are very situational and require Spritzee to give up a generally more useful move to be used. Spritzee is one of the most reliable defensive Trick Room setters in the metagame thanks to its bulk and low Speed stat, but dedicated Trick Room is a subpar strategy in the LC metagame.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types, including Ferroseed, Magnemite, and Honedge, can switch into Spritzee with ease and take advantage of the low damage dealt by Moonblast to either set up entry hazards or use boosting moves. Pawniard is a more offensive answer to Spritzee, though it can't switch in as fearlessly thanks to its partial Dark typing.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types also take very little damage from Spritzee's Moonblast and can take advantage of it in various ways. Trubbish appreciates the opportunity to stack Spikes, and offensive Pokemon such as Gastly and Skrelp can switch in on Spritzee and begin to fire off powerful attacks. Foongus and Mareanie are even more dangerous, however, as they are able to heal any damage Spritzee can deal with Regenerator, remove Spritzee's Calm Mind boosts with Clear Smog and Haze, respectively, and KO it with their Poison-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types resist Moonblast and have no trouble switching in on Spritzee. Ponyta and Larvesta can both blow past Spritzee with powerful Fire-type attacks while healing off damage dealt to them with Morning Sun.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wish allows Spritzee to restore its own HP and pass 13 HP boosts to teammates. Protect allows Spritzee to receive its own Wishes when it would otherwise be KOed by a foe's attack, and it can also ease prediction against Choice-locked Pokemon. Moonblast provides Spritzee with a STAB move that hits the Fighting-type Pokemon it aims to check, and it hits most of the metagame at least neutrally, making the most of Spritzee's limited offensive presence. Additionally, Moonblast carries a decent chance to lower the foe's Special Attack, which can come in handy against checks. Covet allows Spritzee to regain an item after switching in on Knock off, which it will do frequently. Alternatively, Psychic allows Spritzee to almost always OHKO Croagunk as well as 3HKO Foongus and Mareanie, making it more difficult to switch into. Calm Mind is used to allow Spritzee to sweep late-game if its checks have been eliminated, as it can slowly boost up while healing itself with Wish. Aromatherapy heals Spritzee's team from status moves, making it the better option on teams that are susceptible to burns or paralysis.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread and a Bold nature maximize Spritzee's physical bulk and allows Spritzee to pass the largest Wishes possible to its teammates. Spritzee prefers physical bulk over special bulk because its role is to check Fighting-types, which are predominantly physical attackers. The remaining EVs go into Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. Eviolite boosts Spritzee's Defense and Special Defense stats, giving it greater bulk and longevity. Aroma Veil is the preferred ability because it gives Spritzee an immunity to certain stallbreaking moves, such as Taunt and Encore.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Spritzee should be brought in against the Pokemon it checks, most notably Fighting-types that aren't Croagunk. From there, Spritzee can heal itself and its teammates with Wish and Protect. Despite its good bulk, be careful of allowing Spritzee to take super effective hits, especially if its Eviolite has been knocked off, as it can get worn down quickly. However, Spritzee can take most neutral hits, so don't be afraid to attack. If you're running Calm Mind, Spritzee should wait until late in the game to set up, after its checks have been weakened and it has a safe opportunity to set up. If Spritzee is acting as a wincon in a given battle, be careful about letting it get hit by Knock Off, which will limit its eventual setup opportunities. If you're using Aromatherapy, Spritzee can take advantage of the switches it forces by coming in on the Pokemon it checks to quickly heal its team. Be aware of the fact that Spritzee often requires using Protect the turn after using Wish to heal itself, which can give the opponent a free switch or setup opportunity, especially late in the game, and predict accordingly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>One of Spritzee's greatest attributes is its ability to form defensive cores. Munchlax and Ferroseed both appreciate Spritzee's ability to take care of opposing Fighting-types and the recovery that Spritzee's Wish passing can provide, and in return, they can handle Steel-types, except Pawniard, and Poison-types, respectively. Mudbray can handle the Steel-, Poison-, and to a lesser extent, Fire-type Pokemon that give Spritzee trouble, and it appreciates the recovery that Spritzee provides it. Hippopotas also makes a good defensive partner for Spritzee, checking Poison-, Fire-, and Steel-type Pokemon and wearing down opposing teams with weather damage, entry hazards, and Whirlwind. Bulky Pokemon without recovery appreciate Spritzee as well. Skrelp, Timburr, Mienfoo, and Croagunk easily take on most of the Pokemon that threaten Spritzee and appreciate Wish support, as they tend to get worn down. Pursuit trappers such as Alolan Grimer synergize well with Spritzee on all team types, as they are able to remove Gastly, which would otherwise render Spritzee useless for a match. If you're running the Calm Mind set, Spritzee appreciates partners that can break down the Pokemon that resist Moonblast for an eventual late-game sweep. Diglett makes a fantastic partner, as it is able to trap nearly all of the Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-types in the metagame and remove them from battle. Ponyta and Larvesta double as Pawniard checks and can check many of the Pokemon that threaten a Spritzee sweep, most notably Foongus, but both are vulnerable to Skrelp and Mareanie. A Pawniard check is essential when using Spritzee, however, making Fighting-types and Flame Body users good partners.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot is Spritzee's method of boosting, quickly allowing its attacks to do more damage. Moonblast is Spritzee's most powerful STAB move, OHKOing even defensive Vullaby sets after a Nasty Plot boost. Psychic hits Poison-types like Croagunk, Mareanie, and Foongus. Trick Room makes Spritzee even harder to stop, allowing it to outspeed most viable Pokemon, but it requires Spritzee to have two free turns of setup, which are often hard to find. Hidden Power Fire hits Steel-types like Magnemite and Ferroseed, which otherwise wall this set; however, the required IVs force a Special Attack drop, and the speed control from Trick Room is near required, especially on the Eviolite set. Draining Kiss is an option over Moonblast if you want Spritzee to have some more longevity, but the lack of power is very noticeable when compared to Moonblast.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs aim to invest as much into Special Attack as can be afforded. Spritzee's Special Attack is maximized, but enough defensive investment is given to hit Eviolite numbers and optimize bulk. 16 Speed EVs let Spritzee outspeed Foongus, allowing it to use Psychic before getting hit by Spore or Sludge Bomb. If running Hidden Power Fire, use an EV spread of 52 HP / 116 Def / 176 SpA / 76 SpD / 16 Spe to fill the requirements of running the move. This will cost an extra Special Attack point, however. Aroma Veil is Spritzee's most useful ability, making Taunt and Encore non-issues. Eviolite increases Spritzee's already impressive natural bulk, allowing it to tank a hit before setting up or attacking or bluff the normal set and set up on a U-turn. Berry Juice lets Spritzee avoid a 2HKO from Pokemon like Life Orb Staryu, Life Orb Diglett, and Mareanie, but makes it more difficult to set up on Knock Off users.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is a bit less bulky than others and lacks Wish recovery, so it functions less as an emergency blanket check to Fighting- and Dark-types and more like a regular setup sweeper. Thus, try not to switch it into attacks as often, as it will need to take a couple just to set up and attack. Try to keep entry hazards up, as Spritzee can't secure KOs on Pokemon like Foongus and Mareanie without them, even at +2 Special Attack. If using Trick Room, don't use it if Pokemon like Foongus are still healthy, as they will go before Spritzee under Trick Room and KO it. Spritzee doesn't need to sweep to be successful. Don't be afraid to use it to simply break a core or clean up late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard setters like Mudbray and Onix allow Spritzee to secure KOs more easily; they are also good at checking Fire- and Poison-types. Knock Off users like Mienfoo, Timburr, and Pawniard can soften up the opposing team further, especially Poison-types, allowing Spritzee to sweep. Slow Mienfoo sets can benefit from Trick Room and provide a slow U-turn to Spritzee. Diglett is very helpful for trapping all sorts of Poison-, Fire-, and Steel-types and dispatching them with Earthquake. It can also provide Memento support to aid a sweep. Magnet Pull Magnemite can trap Ferroseed, and Spritzee can get rid of Fighting-types for it in return. A secondary Fighting-type check, like Mareanie or Foongus, may be helpful, as this Spritzee lacks the longevity to consistently check them. Pokemon like Snivy and Corphish appreciate Spritzee's ability to break through Pokemon that normally check them, like Croagunk.</p>"

  "Inkay": {
    "overview": "<p>Inkay's ability, Contrary, in combination with the move Superpower allows it to perform as quite a unique sweeper that is able to boost its stats and deal damage at the same time. Furthermore, it has access to STAB Knock Off, allowing it to cripple defensive walls easily, and gets perfect coverage with the aforementioned two moves and Psycho Cut. Inkay has access to some interesting utility options such as Switcheroo and Trick Room as well. However, its 4x weakness to Bug-type moves such as U-turn makes it easy to force out by some of the most common Pokemon in the metagame, mainly Mienfoo and Vullaby. Inkay's lack of reliable recovery and poor base stats make it hard for it to switch into many attacks and remain healthy throughout a match. Inkay's low Speed also forces it to use a Choice Scarf, limiting its use of coverage and STAB options.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Trick Room set can be decent, but Inkay's incredibly pitiful defenses make this hard to pull off effectively. Topsy-Turvy can surprise opposing setup sweepers and negate their boosts, but it is extremely niche and is hard to pull off with Inkay's low Speed and poor bulk. Psychium Z can give Psycho Cut enough power to KO Snubbull, but it takes up an item slot, and Inkay can't afford this with its low Speed and relative frailty. Destiny Bond can be used to surprise an opponent when trying to sacrifice Inkay, although it is extremely niche. Rock Slide can hit Fire-types on a switch in, but Inkay isn't powerful enough to easily make use of it. Taunt can surprise setup sweepers such as Shell Smash Shellder and Nasty Plot Vullaby, but it is pretty niche and doesn't come in handy often.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Snubbull and Spritzee resist both Knock Off and Superpower and can OHKO Inkay with their respective STAB attacks. The former can also steal its Choice Scarf, while the latter can take a Psycho Cut with ease. Cottonee does this job alright as well, but it isn't as good defensively as the others.</p> <p><strong>U-turn</strong>: Inkay's 4x weakness to U-turn allows two of the most common Pokemon in Little Cup, Vullaby and Mienfoo, to damage it heavily, even after Defense boosts. Larvesta, in particular, can also burn Inkay easily.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Gastly and Pumpkaboo easily switch into Superpower and keep Inkay from doing much, although most are either OHKOed or severely crippled by Knock Off.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Superpower's ability to boost Inkay's Attack and Defense in conjunction with Contrary lets it set up and sweep simultaneously. Knock Off cripples defensive threats and most of Inkay's checks while also being a great Dark-type STAB move. Psycho Cut is a generally powerful STAB move to use against Pokemon that resist Superpower, such as Croagunk and Foongus. Switcheroo can also help cripple foes, mainly defensive walls like Spritzee, by forcing them to be Choice locked into one move and also taking their item, but doing so results in Inkay being outsped by many threats.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Contrary reverses Inkay's stat changes, deterring Sticky Web and stat-decreasing moves such as Rock Tomb while allowing it to boost with Superpower. Maximum Speed EVs and a Choice Scarf let Inkay outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and make it a decent revenge killer. The rest of the EVs are used to maximize Attack, which boosts Inkay's sweeping ability, and provide extra HP and Defense, helping its poor longevity. Using a Jolly or Adamant nature is mainly up to preference, as the former lets Inkay outspeed other Choice Scarf users such as Frillish and Modest Magnemite, while the latter gives it extra power—for example, it will always be able to 2HKO Ponyta after Stealth Rock damage—although the extra damage doesn't come into play often.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be wary of using Superpower or Psycho Cut if your opponent still has a Ghost- or Dark-type, as they can easily switch in if Inkay is Choice locked. Earlier in the game, be sure to use Knock Off extensively to cripple threats for a potential sweep from Inkay or any other sweeper. Inkay mainly functions as a revenge killer or a wallbreaker with Superpower, but it should almost never be directly switched in, as its pitiful bulk makes it quite frail. If your team has a slow pivot, that should be the primary method of getting Inkay in safely. If your opponent sets up Sticky Web, it may be beneficial to not clear it away, as Sticky Web boosts Inkay's Speed. When predicting your opponent to switch into a very bulky check to Inkay, such as Spritzee or Pumpkaboo-XL, using Knock Off or Switcheroo to cripple them can help Inkay sweep more easily late-game ; however, be careful of using Switcheroo too early, as it greatly cripples Inkay's Speed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slow pivots such as Mienfoo and Chinchou are almost essential for getting Inkay in safely and are extremely useful for most Pokemon. Entry hazard setters such as Dwebble, Onix, and Ferroseed appreciate Inkay's ability to defer Defog and in return can assist it by breaking Sturdy. Steel- and Poison-types such as Ferroseed and Alolan Grimer can help take down the Fairy-types that threaten Inkay. The latter, as well as some other Dark-types such as Stunky and Houndour, can also Pursuit trap the Ghost-types that commonly switch into Superpower. Pokemon that deter U-turn, such as Vullaby and Ponyta, can keep pivots from using it on Inkay to an extent.</p>"

  "Skrelp": {
    "overview": "<p>Skrelp is a powerful wallbreaker in the LC metagame due to its good typing, which gives it excellent coverage with just its STAB moves, and Adaptability, which boosts the power of these STAB moves. With those traits coupled with a solid Special Attack stat, Skrelp becomes very difficult to switch into. Defensively, Skrelp has eight resistances, most notably to the common Fighting and Fairy types, which gives it the ability to switch in on common Pokemon and pressure them out with its offensive potential. However, Skrelp is held back offensively by poor Speed, a shallow movepool that leaves it reliant on Hidden Power to hit the Pokemon that otherwise wall it, and a lack of recovery outside of Rest. Defensively, Skrelp faces competition from Mareanie, which has the same typing and comparable defensive stats but can check the same Pokemon more reliably thanks to its ability Regenerator, which forces Skrelp into an offensive role. It is also held back by weaknesses to common Ground- and Electric-type attacks and to Diglett, which can revenge kill it with no possibility of Skrelp switching out.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A physical set with Waterfall and Gunk Shot is a possibility, as Skrelp has decent Attack, but forces Skrelp to rely on less reliable STAB moves. This set is effective at luring in specially defensive Pokemon, however. A RestTalk set can be run to increase Skrelp's ability to check key Pokemon throughout the course of a match. However, Mareanie is generally a more reliable defensive answer to the Pokemon Skrelp checks. Berry Juice can be used over Eviolite if Skrelp isn't being used to check Fighting-types (and therefore, often subjected to Knock Off), to give it more longevity at the expense of bulk. Sludge Bomb is an option over Sludge Wave due to its higher chance of inflicting poison, but Skrelp generally appreciates the slightly better damage rolls that Sludge Wave gets. Skrelp can run an EV spread that maximizes its Speed with a Modest nature in order to outspeed Timburr, Croagunk, and Snubbull at the expense of bulk, or an EV spread with maximum Speed and Timid to outrun defensive Mudbray variants and take them out.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Diglett</strong>: Skrelp is extremely prone to being trapped by Diglett, which KOes it with Earthquake without allowing it to switch out. Diglett cannot switch into Skrelp, however.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon That Resist Skrelp's STAB Moves</strong>: Though Skrelp's STAB moves have excellent coverage, several Pokemon can wall it completely. Ferroseed walls Skrelp variants without Hidden Power Fire, and Croagunk walls variants without Hidden Power Psychic. Other Water-types, including Mareanie and Tentacool, do little damage to Skrelp but also take little damage from its attacks.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with high Special Defense stats take Skrelp's attacks fairly easily, especially Munchlax and the seldom seen Mantyke.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks</strong>: Although it has decent defensive stats, Skrelp is prone to being taken out by strong super effective attacks, especially because it is easy to outspeed. Electric-types such as Chinchou, Magnemite, and Elekid; Ground-types such as Mudbray and Drilbur; and Psychic-types such as Abra are all able to outspeed and either KO or nearly KO Skrelp.</p>",

Together they give Skrelp nearly perfect neutral coverage in the LC metagame. Skrelp has a choice of a Hidden Power to deal significant damage to one of the Pokemon that resist its STAB attacks. Hidden Power Fire is useful for Ferroseed, while Hidden Power Psychic is useful for Croagunk, as well as for other Poison-type Pokemon, including Mareanie, Tentacool, and other Skrelp. Thunderbolt is another option in this slot that hits the latter three for greater damage than Hidden Power Psychic. Toxic Spikes gives Skrelp a way to take advantage of the switches it forces by stacking Toxic Spikes to pressure opposing teams. Alternatively, Scald can be run as a Water-type STAB move that doesn't miss and can burn switch-ins to wear them down.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Skrelp's EV spread maximizes its Special Attack while giving it enough bulk to survive an Earthquake from Drilbur or Focus Sash Diglett, or a Psychic from Focus Sash Abra. Adaptability allows Skrelp to hit as hard as possible with its STAB moves, especially with Special Attack investment. An Eviolite improves Skrelp's defenses, allowing it to take as many hits as possible while dealing damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Skrelp can easily come in on the attacks that it resists, especially against Pokemon such as Spritzee and Timburr that cannot significantly damage it, and then begin to dish out damage against whatever comes in. Early-game, Skrelp can use Toxic Spikes or Scald to spread status and wear down the opposing team's checks and counters. Mid- or late-game, Skrelp can come in and break down the opposing team with powerful attacks. Be cautious when playing against teams using trappers, as these can easily come in after Skrelp gets a KO and remove it from the match. Also be careful about letting Skrelp take super effective, or even powerful neutral attacks, as despite its good defenses it is prone to getting worn down. Skrelp's Hidden Power should usually not be used except against Pokemon that resist both of Skrelp's STAB attacks because Adaptability gives Skrelp such a power boost on its STAB moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support from the likes of Dwebble and Onix enhances Skrelp's wallbreaking potential and helps it take advantage of the switches it forces. Fighting-types, including Mienfoo and Timburr, appreciate Skrelp's ability to check Fairy-type Pokemon, can Knock Off opposing Pokemon's items to help Skrelp deal more damage, and can handle Ferroseed easily. Checks to Ground-type Pokemon are essential, making Grass-types such as Snivy, Pumpkaboo, and Ferroseed good partners. Flying-type Pokemon, including Vullaby and Archen, also work in this role to a degree. Pokemon that can take advantage of the fact that Skrelp brings in Diglett work well, including Snivy and Z-Trick-or-Treat Pumpkaboo. Pokemon that appreciate Skrelp's ability to come in on and pressure Fighting-type Pokemon are also good partners, including Normal-type attackers such as Doduo and Bunnelby and Steel- and Rock-type attackers such as Omanyte and Pawniard. Lastly, Skrelp forms a solid defensive core with both Lickitung and Spritzee, both of which can also use Wish to pass Skrelp HP boosts, giving it longevity it would not otherwise have.</p>"

  "Tyrunt": {
    "overview": "<p>Tyrunt's high base Attack stat and solid base Defense stat make it a flexible Pokemon capable of performing offensive roles. Its STAB combination is not resisted by much in the tier other than the common Steel-types, and its great movepool gives it access to many coverage moves that hit specific threats. Tyrunt's typing enables it to check many Flying-type threats as well as some Fire-types. Furthermore, Tyrunt is able to have Sturdy, which works well in tandem with Berry Juice. Tyrunt's access to Dragon Dance allows it to be a formidable sweeper, and it can set up much more easily than other Dragon Dance sweepers. Unfortunately, its typing makes it vulnerable to the common Fighting-, Ground-, Ice-, and Steel-types in the tier. Tyrunt is also weak to common priority moves like Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave. Furthermore, its relatively low Speed stat means that it is outsped by many Choice Scarf users after a Dragon Dance boost, such as Mienfoo and Pawniard. Its low Special Defense can further hamper its sweeps from time to time. Tyrunt's lack of reliable recovery outside of Berry Juice makes it easily worn down. Tyrunt also faces competition from Sturdy Shell Smash users like Tirtouga and Dwebble, which can set up similarly easily but usually only need one boost to sweep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tyrunt can opt for a more defensively oriented Stealth Rock set with STAB Dragon Tail. However, this set faces overwhelming competition from better Stealth Rock setters like Archen and Onix, with the former having a better supporting movepool and the latter having a faster Dragon Tail. Choice Scarf Tyrunt can revenge kill a good portion of the metagame with its STAB moves combined with Earthquake; however, one of Tyrunt's main traits is its wide coverage, so being Choice locked is not as beneficial for Tyrunt. A defensive set containing Rest and Sleep Talk can increase Tyrunt's longevity, but it will lose out on coverage compared to Tyrunt's other sets. A fully offensive set with Life Orb and four attacks can be run for more coverage, but Tyrunt is slow and its damage output is fairly average without Dragon Dance boosts. Tyrunt has access to other boosting moves like Curse and Hone Claws, but both are inferior to Dragon Dance. Zen Headbutt can be used to hit bulkier Fighting-types such as Timburr and Mienfoo without locking Tyrunt into Outrage; however, a super effective Zen Headbutt is weaker than an Outrage. Fire Fang can be used without Strong Jaw to reliably 2HKO Ferroseed without a boost, OHKOing it at +1. Strong Jaw can be run to increase the power of Thunder Fang, which hits certain Water-types for super effective damage, and Ice Fang, which hits Drilbur and doesn't offer too much coverage outside of that. However, using Strong Jaw over Sturdy will lower Tyrunt's setup opportunities, as Tyrunt can be OHKOed by powerful super effective moves without Sturdy. Crunch is powerful with a Strong Jaw boost and hits Gastly and Abra, but Tyrunt's STAB moves plus Earthquake offer better coverage, and without Sturdy, Tyrunt struggles to set up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Strong Fighting-types such as Mienfoo, Croagunk, Timburr, and Scraggy all threaten Tyrunt with their super effective STAB attacks, and all of them can Knock Off Tyrunt's item. Furthermore, Timburr and Croagunk's super effective STAB priority moves can hinder Tyrunt's sweeping potential.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Snubbull, Spritzee, and Cottonee threaten Tyrunt with their super effective attacks and are immune to Tyrunt's Dragon-type STAB moves, meaning that they can easily come in on Outrage. Cottonee can also easily use Encore and Memento against Tyrunt. Fairy-types still have to be wary of Iron Tail, although it doesn't always 2HKO Spritzee or Snubbull.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Offensive Ground-types such as Diglett, Choice Scarf Drilbur, and Choice Scarf Mudbray can all outspeed Tyrunt and threaten it with their super effective STAB moves. Bulkier Ground-types like defensive Mudbray and Hippopotas can tank Tyrunt's attacks reasonably well and can threaten it with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Many of the most common Steel-types pose as threats to Tyrunt. Magnemite resists both of Tyrunt's STAB moves and can threaten Tyrunt with a Flash Cannon. Pawniard can outspeed Tyrunt and either Knock Off its item or hit it with an Iron Head. Ferroseed can easily switch into Tyrunt's attacks barring Fire Fang and can deter Tyrunt's sweep with a Thunder Wave. However, all of these Steel-types, except for Ferroseed, are hit hard by Earthquake and Superpower, while Ferroseed is smacked by Fire Fang.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status ailments like burns and paralysis can seriously hamper Tyrunt's sweeping potential and overall usefulness. Burns from Ponyta and Larvesta make Tyrunt very weak, while paralysis makes Tyrunt incredibly slow.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Coverage</strong>: Many Pokemon that Tyrunt normally beats and can switch into, such as Doduo, Rufflet, and Deerling, carry Fighting-type coverage moves that seriously damage it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance enables Tyrunt to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame after a boost while increasing its Attack. Stone Edge is a powerful STAB move that dents anything that doesn't resist it. Rock Slide trades firepower for consistency and is a decently powerful STAB move that hits Flying- and Fire-types for super effective damage, but it is usually much weaker than Stone Edge and as such doesn't deal with bulkier foes as reliably. Outrage is the strongest STAB option Tyrunt gets and can sweep weakened teams after a Dragon Dance boost due to its great neutral coverage. Earthquake gives Tyrunt perfect coverage in tandem with its STAB combination, and it allows Tyrunt to threaten the common Steel-types in the tier, such as Pawniard and Magnemite. Superpower is an alternative that gives Tyrunt a way to deal with Steel-types that take neutral damage from Earthquake, such as Ferroseed, but it has the downside of lowering Tyrunt's Attack. Dragon Claw can be used instead of Outrage in order to not lock Tyrunt into the same move, but it is weaker than Outrage and is not that threatening even after a boost. Iron Head or Iron Tail can be used to hit Fairy-types such as Snubbull and Cottonee.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread along with a Jolly nature maximizes Tyrunt's Attack while enabling it to reach 15 Speed, allowing it to outspeed Pokemon such as pivot Vullaby and defensive Chinchou before a Dragon Dance and everything up to and including base 14 Speed Choice Scarf users, such as Modest Magnemite, at +1. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense to slightly increase Tyrunt's special bulk. Sturdy is very useful, as it allows Tyrunt to survive at least one hit if at full health, guaranteeing a chance to use Dragon Dance. Berry Juice works well in combination with Sturdy, healing Tyrunt back to full HP and re-activating Sturdy. Running 23 HP IVs enables Tyrunt to reach 21 HP, which allows it to completely heal after Berry Juice activates and thus regain Sturdy.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tyrunt should be used as a late-game sweeper when its checks have been weakened or removed, such as bulky Fighting-types and Steel-types like Ferroseed. Tyrunt can also be used to wallbreak early-game to punch holes for another sweeper, provided that Tyrunt is not favorable to sweep the opposing team. It is best to not switch Tyrunt directly into an attack, as Sturdy being broken really reduces its longevity. Similarly, entry hazards should be removed before attempting to sweep in order to keep Sturdy intact. It is best to send Tyrunt in after a teammate has been KOed or through a slow U-turn or Volt Switch. Tyrunt should not set up until its checks have been weakened or eliminated in order to get the best chance of sweeping. If all priority users have been KOed and Sturdy is intact, Tyrunt can opt to set up two Dragon Dances due to Sturdy and Berry Juice, becoming incredibly powerful and outspeeding most Choice Scarf users. Set up appropriately if Tyrunt is carrying a specific coverage move over another; for example, if Tyrunt is running Fire Fang or Superpower, it can set up if an opposing Ferroseed is present. If Sturdy is intact, Tyrunt can even set up on Pokemon that hit it for super effective damage, such as Timburr and Mienfoo. Tyrunt must be careful of being hit by a status move, as status will cripple Tyrunt's longevity or sweeping potential. When sweeping, Outrage should only be used once all Fairy- and Steel-types have fainted.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tyrunt appreciates Pokemon that can check the Fighting-types that threaten it, such as Snubbull and Foongus. Steel-types such as Magnemite and Pawniard can get rid of the Fairy-types that trouble Tyrunt. Pokemon such as Snivy, Vullaby, and Staryu can handle the threatening Ground-type attackers for Tyrunt. Fighting- and Ground-type Pokemon, such as Mienfoo and Mudbray, can threaten Steel-types for Tyrunt, particularly Pawniard and Magnemite. In turn, Tyrunt can check and threaten the Flying-types that trouble them. Fire-types like Ponyta and Larvesta are able to eliminate Ferroseed, which walls Tyrunt completely if it is not carrying Fire Fang or Superpower, and they can also remove other Steel-types and resist the Ice- and Fairy-type attacks that threaten Tyrunt. Powerful wallbreakers like Doduo and Corphish can weaken an opposing team to make it easier for Tyrunt to sweep late-game. Diglett is able to trap and KO Steel-types, making it easier for Tyrunt to sweep, while Memento support from the likes of Cottonee and Diglett provides Tyrunt with a reliable setup opportunity. Entry hazard support from the likes of Onix and Ferroseed can aid Tyrunt when sweeping. Pokemon that remove entry hazards, such as Drilbur and Staryu, allow Tyrunt to switch in without its Sturdy being broken by hazards. U-turn and Volt Switch support grants Tyrunt safe switches, so Pokemon like Mienfoo and Magnemite make good teammates.</p>"

  "Amaura": {
    "overview": "<p>By virtue of its amazing offensive typing, which offers unresisted coverage alongside Earth Power, Amaura secures itself a niche in LC as a good offensive check to Flying-types and as a potent revenge killer with a Choice Scarf. Its access to two good abilities in Snow Warning, which grants it a 100% accurate Blizzard and chip damage on foes, and Refrigerate, which provides Amaura with an immensely powerful Hyper Voice and the ability to bypass Substitute, further bolsters its offensive presence. Furthermore, Amaura has a rather diverse special movepool, with access to useful moves like Thunderbolt, Earth Power, and Flash Cannon in addition to its STAB moves, which allows it to sufficiently cover most of the metagame. Unfortunately, despite its offensive prowess, Amaura has an absolutely awful defensive typing, with 4x weaknesses to Fighting- and Steel-type attacks, weaknesses to common priority moves such as Aqua Jet and Vacuum Wave, and a weakness to Stealth Rock. Amaura is also hurt by its poor Speed, which leaves it either reliant on a Choice Scarf to outspeed foes, or outsped and threatened by common Pokemon such as Mienfoo, Pawniard, and Diglett. Lastly, Amaura suffers from a general lack of power behind any of its Rock-type STAB attacks, which keeps it from hitting too hard with them unless used against targets that take super effective damage and at times can also limit its overall neutral coverage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Amaura can opt to use Rock Polish alongside Berry Juice, but it is already able to circumvent its Speed problem with Choice Scarf and often struggles to find setup opportunities. Stealth Rock alongside Berry Juice is also an option that allows Amaura to support its teammates, though Amaura is more consistently effective as a revenge killer with Choice Scarf and is even more vulnerable to its checks due to its poor Speed. This set also faces quite a bit of competition from the likes of Ferroseed and Hippopotas, which have much better typing and can thus lay down Stealth Rock more reliably. Calm Mind is another setup option that allows Amaura to simultaneously boost its offensive presence and Special Defense. However, Amaura still struggles to find setup opportunities and will be quite slow. If Amaura wishes to bypass Sucker Punch or inflict foes with status, it can opt to use Nature Power, which will turn into a powerful Refrigerate-boosted Tri Attack, though this is at the cost of better power with Hyper Voice, which is usually more preferable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Due to Amaura's 4x weakness to Steel-type attacks, it is heavily pressured by common Pokemon of the type in Ferroseed, Pawniard, and Magnemite, all of which threaten to OHKO Amaura with their super effective STAB attacks. The latter two, however, must be wary of Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Amaura also has a 4x weakness to Fighting-type attacks, which leaves it heavily threatened by extremely common Fighting-types like Mienfoo, Scraggy, and Pancham. Timburr and Croagunk are particularly troublesome, as they carry 4x effective priority in the forms of Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, respectively, thus KOing Amaura before it can attack them at all.</p> <p><strong>Faster Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Amaura's mediocre bulk means that other Choice Scarf users that outspeed it, such as Chinchou, Doduo, and Mienfoo, can all threaten to OHKO it before Amaura can even attack.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Most Water-types are bulky enough to survive a Thunderbolt and KO Amaura in return with their super effective STAB attacks. Examples include Staryu, Omanyte, and particularly Chinchou, which fears Earth Power but can safely switch in if Amaura is locked into Hyper Voice or Thunderbolt by virtue of its Volt Absorb ability. Users of Aqua Jet, such as Corphish and Tirtouga, are especially threatening, as they can threaten to revenge kill Amaura with super effective priority before it can attack them.</p> <p><strong>Munchlax</strong>: Munchlax's Thick Fat ability allows it to safely switch into either of Amaura's Ice-type attacks, while its great natural special bulk allows it to comfortably tank any of Amaura's other attacks and in return threaten it with Earthquake.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Blizzard is granted 100% accuracy in hail and is an extremely powerful STAB attack that, alongside the chip damage that hail provides, is capable of 2HKOing common threats in Mienfoo, Vullaby, and Foongus. Hyper Voice is an option over Blizzard if Amaura is running Refrigerate and sacrifices a slightly better damage output for the ability to bypass Substitutes and nail common users of the move, like Abra and Diglett. Earth Power is excellent coverage alongside Blizzard or Hyper Voice, hitting Pokemon resistant to Ice, such as Magnemite, Chinchou, and Ponyta, super effectively. Thunderbolt allows Amaura to hit bulky Water-types such as Staryu, Shellos, and Slowpoke, which can otherwise tank its attacks, super effectively. Ancient Power is used as a secondary STAB attack to hit Larvesta super effectively, with the additional benefit of potentially boosting all of Amaura's stats by one stage. Hyper Beam is an extremely powerful Refrigerate-boosted STAB attack that is preferable on Refrigerate sets and can blow past weakened bulkier threats such as Spritzee and Ferroseed, especially after they've been hit with Knock Off, though the turn Amaura will take to recharge after using the move should be noted.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack with a Modest nature gives Amaura as much offensive prowess as possible, and maximum investment in Speed with a Choice Scarf allows it to hit 21 Speed and outpace the entire unboosted metagame. A Timid nature can be used instead of Modest to hit 22 Speed, thus allowing Amaura to outpace 21 Speed Choice Scarf users like Modest Magnemite and Snover and Speed tie with 22 Speed Choice Scarf users. However, neither are very common, and this is also at the cost of the slight increase in power a Modest nature would provide. The remaining EVs are invested into HP, thus allowing Amaura to switch into Stealth Rock five times. Snow Warning can be used for a 100% accurate Blizzard and chip damage on foes, which allows Amaura to 2HKO slow Mienfoo, while Refrigerate can be used if Amaura wishes to bypass Substitutes with its powerful Refrigate-boosted Hyper Voice and boost the power of Hyper Beam.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to the good Speed Choice Scarf provides Amaura with, this set's best use is as a revenge killer, particularly of Pokemon weak to Ice-type attacks such as Vullaby, Doduo, and Snivy. Amaura can, however, try cleaning up late-game after its checks have been removed or weakened, though it can at times weaken its checks enough to KO them considering the power of its attacks. If Amaura is attempting to sweep late-game, it's best that Fighting-types and Steel-types are removed, as most Pokemon of these types can tank a hit and take advantage of Amaura's 4x weakness to their STAB attacks to KO it. Although Amaura can dent Water-types with Thunderbolt, it is best that they are also weakened or removed before Amaura attempts to clean up late-game, as most can survive a Thunderbolt and potentially KO Amaura with super effective STAB attacks. Priority users like Corphish and Croagunk are also important to remove, as they can capitalize on Amaura's poor typing to KO it before it can even attack. Faster Choice Scarf users like Rufflet and Doduo should be scouted out in order to make full use of Amaura, as these threats will otherwise outpace and OHKO it with their respective coverage options. If Amaura wishes to use Hyper Beam to muscle past and revenge kill a bulkier foe, it must be weakened first. Spritzee, bulky Mienfoo, and Ferroseed are the main examples of bulky Pokemon Amaura will need weakened to break with Hyper Beam. Amaura is often capable of forcing switches due to the metagame's general lack of Ice-resistant Pokemon and should thus capitalize on this by switching out on a predicted switch to bring out ateammate capable of taking on the foe switched into play. Lastly, due to its susceptibility to Diglett, Amaura should be wary of being locked into Thunderbolt or Ancient Power, as neither move will do sufficient damage to Diglett, which can then easily trap and revenge kill Amaura in return.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Amaura's huge weakness to Fighting-type attacks means that it requires the support of Pokemon that are capable of checking Fighting-types, such as Doduo, Snubbull, and Spritzee. Amaura also has a big weakness to Steel-type attacks and thus appreciates the likes of Ponyta, Croagunk, and Diglett, which can all take care of common Steel-type threats in Pawniard and Magnemite. Entry hazard support from the likes of Onix, Dwebble, and Omanyte is useful to Amaura, as it allows it to secure OHKOs on Pokemon like Foongus and Vullaby. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Staryu, Vullaby, and Kabuto is also appreciated, as it allows Amaura to switch in without losing 25% of its HP to Stealth Rock. Knock Off support from Pokemon like Pawniard, Timburr, and Alolan Grimer is useful for helping Amaura to break past bulkier threats. Foongus and Pumpkaboo-XL make good teammates, as they can switch in on and remove bulky Water-types like Slowpoke and Staryu, allowing Amaura to spam Blizzard or Hyper Voice more reliably. Powerful attackers like Abra, Doduo, and Mudbray are all capable of punching holes in the opponent's team and make it easier for Amaura to clean up late-game. Alolan Sandshrew and Cubchoo can make use of their Slush Rush abilities to benefit from Amaura's hail after it's been KOed, as they will be able to outspeed and pick off foes Amaura has weakened for them while hail is still up. Finally, due to Amaura's reliance on Choice Scarf, it is best that Knock Off is avoided as much as possible, so Pokemon capable of absorbing Knock Off, such as Alolan Grimer, Snubbull, and Vullaby, all make for good teammates.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Trick Room set with Trick Room, either Giga Drain or Bullet Seed, Will-O-Wisp, and either Destiny Bond or Explosion with a Quiet or Brave nature and an EV spread of 44 HP / 44 Atk / 196 Def / 156 SpD / 68 SpA can be used for Pumpkaboo-XL and other slow Pokemon to sweep the opposing team, but with the loss of one of the best Trick Room sweepers, Porygon, this set is underwhelming. Rock Slide can be very effective on the aforementioned Trick Room set, as it hits Fire-, Flying-, and Ice-type Pokemon such as Ponyta, Vullaby, and Slush Rush users super effectively while outspeeding them, but Fire Blast hits Ice-types a lot harder than Rock Slide. Another form of recovery that Pumpkaboo-XL can utilize is Leech Seed + Protect, as it can drain the opposing Pokemon's health and use Protect to heal itself up safely; however, this combination is underwhelming, as it takes up significant space in Pumpkaboo-XL's moveset and is too passive in comparison to the more reliable Synthesis. Instead of Will-O-Wisp, Toxic can be used to cripple setup sweepers and can be spread early-game, crippling opposing Pokemon and some of Pumpkaboo-XL's checks. Pumpkaboo-XL can also utilize Ghostium Z + Trick-or-Treat to gain a boost to all of its stats, but Pumpkaboo-XL's bulk is much more important than stat boosts; Z-Trick-or-Treat is much more fitting for Pumpkaboo-S because of its superior offensive capabilities.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong> Fire-types, especially Houndour, which has a super effective typing against Pumpkaboo-XL's, can resist nearly all of Pumpkaboo-XL's moves and likely OHKO or 2HKO it with super effective special moves without much difficulty; some Fire-types can also gain a Flash Fire boost if they switch into Will-O-Wisp, causing trouble for Pumpkaboo-XL and its teammates.</p> <p><strong>Guts Users</strong> Guts users such as Timburr and Taillow can easily switch into Will-O-Wisp because of the negligible damage a burn deals per turn and defeat Pumpkaboo-XL easily with Guts-boosted Knock Off and Brave Bird, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Dark- and Flying-types</strong> Dark- and Flying-types, especially special Vullaby, can easily deal with Pumpkaboo-XL with their super effective STAB moves, either OHKOing or 2HKOing it, and can take all of Pumpkaboo-XL's moves, although most don't appreciate being burned by Will-O-Wisp.</p>",

      "Special Spinblocker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Giga Drain is Pumpkaboo-XL's main STAB move, which lets it hit Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types such as Chinchou, Slowpoke, Tirtouga, and Mudbray super effectively, and is a semi-reliable recovery option. Pumpkaboo-XL's most reliable form of recovery is Synthesis, allowing it to maintain its longevity in battle to spinblock as long as possible. Will-O-Wisp allows Pumpkaboo-XL to spread status and cripple physical attackers, which switch into this set. Fire Blast is Pumpkaboo-XL's most powerful coverage move, hitting Steel-, Grass-, Bug-, and Ice-types such as Ferroseed, Foongus, Spinarak, and Alolan Sandshrew. Instead of Fire Blast, Shadow Ball can be run as Pumpkaboo-XL's secondary STAB move, hitting Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Abra and Gastly.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Pumpkaboo-XL's current EV spread maximizes its special bulk, since its Special Defense is lower than its physical Defense. The special bulk also allows it to deal with Staryu, a common spinner. Pumpkaboo-XL can utilize a physically defensive EV spread of 204 HP / 196 Def / 4 SpA / 76 SpD / 28 Spe to increase its already high Defense; this allows Pumpkaboo-XL to efficiently check Mudbray, as it is now more resistant to its physical attacks; however, the spread's lower Special Defense makes Pumpkaboo-XL somewhat vulnerable to special attacks. 28 Speed EVs allow Pumpkaboo-XL to outspeed base 10 Speed Pokemon such as Ferroseed. They also allow it to Speed tie with Pokemon that reach 11 Speed, such as Mudbray. Eviolite is very important for Pumpkaboo-XL, as it maximizes its defenses, which helps it maintain its longevity in battle. Frisk is the ability of choice because it can help determine the foe's set, which provides good foresight. A Calm nature is preferred for Pumpkaboo-XL, as it further increases Pumpkaboo-XL's Special Defense, making it more specially bulky.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pumpkaboo-XL should be switched into a spinner to attempt to spinblock, allowing entry hazards to stay on the opposing side of the field. Pumpkaboo-XL can also be sent out early-game and spam Will-O-Wisp to spread burns and cripple early-game physical attackers. Pumpkaboo-XL can also switch into Pokemon that it can check, such as Mudbray and some Pokemon that have low Special Defense. It is best to keep Pumpkaboo-XL in the game until all of the opponent's spinners are defeated to ensure that the opposing side's entry hazards don't get removed. Pumpkaboo-XL should also be cautious of Life Orb Ice Beam Staryu, especially if it runs its physically defensive EV spread. Pumpkaboo-XL should generally avoid Knock Off, as it hits Pumpkaboo-XL super effectively and takes away its Eviolite, which is very important in maintaining its precious bulk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Pumpkaboo-XL is a spinblocker, it would be sensible to have entry hazard setters such as Drilbur, Ferroseed, Mareanie, and Surskit as teammates. The aforementioned entry hazard setters also appreciate Pumpkaboo-XL's utility; however, Pumpkaboo-XL can also be used on teams that don't rely on stacking hazards, as it can still check some Pokemon such as Mudbray. Pumpkaboo-XL's main checks are Dark-, Fire-, and Flying-type Pokemon such as Pawniard, Ponyta, and Vullaby, which can mostly wall all of Pumpkaboo-XL's moves and defeat it easily. Great partners to check the aforementioned Pokemon are Timburr, Mienfoo, and Chinchou, as Timburr can be good on entry hazard-stacking teams and can handle Houndour and Ponyta, as it doesn't mind getting burned and can KO them; Mienfoo can handle Dark-type Pokemon such as Pawniard, but it does mind getting burned; and Chinchou can take care of Vullaby and Ponyta with its Water- and Electric-type moves as well as provide a slow Volt Switch to get Pumpkaboo-XL safely into battle if necessary. Knock Off users and Pursuit trappers can be a pain to Pumpkaboo-XL, so Pokemon such as Trubbish and Diglett can be of use; Trubbish can deal with Knock Off users easily because of its decent physical bulk and ability, Sticky Hold, whereas Diglett can trap Pursuit trappers, and most likely OHKO them, and can also deal with Fire-types and some Steel-types for Pumpkaboo-XL; Pumpkaboo-XL can deal with Water- and Grass-types for it in return. Special walls can take nearly all of Pumpkaboo-XL's moves and proceed to stall out Pumpkaboo-XL until it gets KOed (although some of them don't appreciate getting burned), so powerful physical attackers can help Pumpkaboo-XL take care of them. Pawniard also makes for a good teammate to Pumpkaboo-XL, which cannot block Defog; Pawniard can switch into an expected Defog and gain a Defiant boost in compensation for the removal of entry hazards.</p>"

      "Mixed Spinblocker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Giga Drain is Pumpkaboo-XL's primary Grass-type STAB move, hitting Rock-, Water-, and Ground-type Pokemon such as Tirtouga, Chinchou, Slowpoke, and Mudbray. It also acts as a source of recovery. Bullet Seed can be used over Giga Drain because it generally hits harder, is physical instead of special, and can break Sturdy, which can be very effective against Pokemon like Onix and Tirtouga; however, Mudbray gets insane Stamina boosts from Bullet Seed and can wall Pumpkaboo-XL as its Defense rises. Synthesis is Pumpkaboo-XL's main recovery option, allowing it to spinblock consistently for its team. Will-O-Wisp allows Pumpkaboo-XL to spread burns and cripple physical attackers that may switch into it. Shadow Sneak is Pumpkaboo-XL's secondary STAB move and a priority move, which allows it to pick off weakened Pokemon and hit Ghost- and Psychic-types super effectively. Fire Blast can be used instead of Shadow Sneak to hit Steel-, Grass-, Bug-, and Ice-types such as Ferroseed, Foongus, Spinarak, and Alolan Sandshrew super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Pumpkaboo-XL's main EV spread allows it to be quite bulky, increasing its Special Defense to nearly be on par with its already high Defense, which helps it against Staryu, one of the most common spinners in the metagame. The EV spread also allows Pumpkaboo-XL to hit decently hard and outspeed base 10 Speed Pokemon and Speed tie with 11 Speed Pokemon such as Ferroseed and Mudbray, respectively; however, a Sassy nature will cut Pumpkaboo-XL's Speed to some degree. Instead of the main EV spread, Pumpkaboo-XL can run a physically defensive EV spread of 204 HP / 196 Def / 4 SpA / 76 SpD / 28 Spe, which allows it to further enhance its monstrous physical Defense to check Mudbray more effectively, but this leaves it vulnerable to powerful special attackers. Eviolite plays a large role in Pumpkaboo-XL's longevity, as it maximizes its already high bulk. Frisk can potentially determine the set of the opposing Pokemon, creating insight for Pumpkaboo-XL's teammates. A Sassy nature can be used to further enhance Pumpkaboo-XL's Special Defense giving it more bulk at the cost of its Speed, which isn't as important as its bulk. Instead of losing its Speed, Pumpkaboo-XL can utilize a Careful nature, which also increases its special bulk but lowers its Special Attack, making moves such as Giga Drain and Fire Blast less effective, so this nature is preferred if Pumpkaboo-XL chooses to use Bullet Seed and Shadow Sneak.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Like the special spinblocker variant, Pumpkaboo-XL's main purpose is to switch into spinners and prevent them from removing the entry hazards on their side of the field, which helps the sweepers on Pumpkaboo-XL's team to sweep efficiently. Pumpkaboo-XL can deal with and force out most spinners, preventing them from removing the entry hazards. Pumpkaboo-XL should be kept alive until all spinners are defeated, as if Pumpkaboo-XL faints before that, the entry hazards could be removed, decreasing Pumpkaboo-XL's team's sweeping capabilities. Pumpkaboo-XL, like the special variant, should be wary of Knock Off, as it takes away an important factor of its bulk, leaving it more vulnerable to attacks. Pumpkaboo-XL can also be used early-game to spread burns and cripple physical attackers, which renders them mostly useless.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since this variant of Pumpkaboo-XL is also a spinblocker, Pokemon like Drilbur, Mareanie, Ferroseed, and Surskit appreciate Pumpkaboo-XL's ability to keep their entry hazards on the opposing side; however, Pumpkaboo-XL can also be used without entry hazard setters, as it can still check important Pokemon. Pawniard is a great asset to the team, as Pumpkaboo-XL cannot block Defog, so Pawniard can punish Defog users by gaining a Defiant boost as compensation for the loss of entry hazards. Knock Off users and Pursuit trappers spell trouble for Pumpkaboo-XL, so Pokemon like Trubbish and Diglett are great partners, as Trubbish can easily take a Knock Off due to its good physical bulk and Sticky Hold ability, while Diglett can trap Pursuit trappers and most likely OHKO them and can also deal with Fire-types that might pose a problem to Pumpkaboo-XL. Pokemon such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Chinchou can deal with opposing Vullaby, Steel-, Dark-, and Fire-types for Pumpkaboo-XL; Chinchou and Pumpkaboo-XL also have good synergy, as both can deal with each others' checks, and Chinchou can provide a useful slow Volt Switch for Pumpkaboo-XL to safely enter battle.</p>"

  "Pikipek": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Pikipek may seem an underwhelming choice; it boasts overall mediocre stats, has almost nonexistent defenses, and does not have many coverage options. Secondly, there are stronger Flying-types like Doduo, Archen, and Rufflet that can work better than Pikipek, which has to rely on Brave Bird and Life Orb to deal significant damage, meaning that it will constantly lose its HP in the process; this combined with a weakness to Stealth Rock makes it difficult for Pikipek to be efficient. However, Pikipek carves itself a small niche that makes it truly shine and, more importantly, it doesn't share with any other Flying-type Pokemon in LC: access to Bullet Seed and Skill Link, meaning that it can remove Rock-types with ease, even Sturdy + Berry Juice ones. It also sports respectable Attack and Speed stats, letting it deal a solid amount of damage with its STAB or coverage moves and outspeed Pokemon such as Pawniard and Rufflet with ease. While far from being the premier LC Flying-type, Pikipek can prove to be a good pick on teams searching a way to beat opposing leads and check a good number of Rock- and Water-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Pikipek has access to STAB Skill Link Fury Attack, which seems very appealing at first; however, Pikipek has issues finding a slot for it, its 85% accuracy move means it will fail at bad times, and even though Skill Link makes it hit 5 times, it doesn't provide important KOs like Bullet Seed or Brave Bird do, so it's a unadvised option. Swords Dance is an interesting option to boost Pikipek's offensive stats to an insane level, but it can't pull it off very well because its defenses are pathetic, so it can't afford to withstand a hit and boost; moreover, keep in mind that Pikipek lacks priority moves, making it difficult to sweep against faster threats even at +2. Swords Dance in conjunction with Focus Sash can turn Pikipek into a sweeping machine once priority users have been eliminated; on such a set, Drill Peck is advised because it avoids the recoil of Brave Bird. However, consider that the absence of Life Orb is somewhat unappealing, because even at +2, Pikipek struggles to wear down opposing Pokemon with Drill Peck alone. Even if you can pull off a Swords Dance, any priority move can obliterate a 1 HP Pikipek. Mirror Move can be used with Flyinium Z to threaten a powerful attack and boost in the same turn, but this is usually better done by Vullaby thanks to its bulk and Weak Armor. Pikipek has access to Boomburst, but such a set is better suited for Taillow, which sports better Speed, Heat Wave, and Scrappy. Steel Wing may be attractive at first as it hits support Archen and other Rock-types super effectively; however, the nature of damage rolls in LC makes Bullet Seed a better choice, whereas Steel Wing fails to OHKO any Rock-type (even Archen). As supportive options, Pikipek has access to both Roost and Tailwind; Roost can find a place in the Life Orb set, but it's not recommended because Pikipek is too frail to use Roost efficiently, while Tailwind can be used to give support to the team, but Pikipek is again too frail to make full use of it and also has issues finding a moveslot for it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Pikipek has a horrible time against most Steel-types, because even though it has coverage for them, they simply withstand the hit and KO it back. Life Orb Pawniard can easily OHKO Pikipek with Sucker Punch, but Brick Break is a clean OHKO. If Pikipek's set lacks Brick Break, then Pawniard somewhat walls it, since Flame Charge isn't a 2HKO on Pawniard's Eviolite set, while Sucker Punch is a sure 2HKO in the worst-case scenario. If Pikipek is running Brick Break, then Honedge completely walls Pikipek by virtue of its typing and can OHKO it after Stealth Rock damage. It should be noted, however, that Honedge fails to OHKO Pikipek without Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types are usually slower than Pikipek, and it can easily take them out with a Life Orb-boosted Skill Link Bullet Seed; however, there are exceptions. Archen is a prime example, because Jolly Archen Speed ties with Jolly Pikipek, takes a Bullet Seed, and can OHKO Pikipek back more than 90% of the time with Rock Slide, even with Defeatist. Jolly Onix can also Speed tie with Jolly Pikipek and OHKO it with Rock Blast; however, if Onix loses the Speed tie, it's OHKOed by Pikipek's Bullet Seed. +2 Tirtouga can OHKO Pikipek with an Aqua Jet or a STAB move, but it must be wary because Pikipek can KO it with Bullet Seed.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Choice Scarf Chinchou can outright OHKO Pikipek with an Electric-type move before it can even try to use Bullet Seed; however, slower and bulkier variants of Chinchou should be wary of Bullet Seed (although it can't OHKO Berry Juice variants and some Eviolite defensive sets). Magnemite is an excellent answer to Pikipek, because it 4x resists Flying, resists Grass, and isn't OHKOed by Brick Break; in exchange, it OHKOes Pikipek with its Electric STAB move. Elekid is fast enough to outspeed the Life Orb variant and OHKO it with its Electric-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers and Strong Priority Users</strong>: Pikipek's defenses are almost nonexistent, and it also lacks a strong priority move like Fletchling's Acrobatics; this lets faster revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Doduo or priority users like Carvanha and Corphish decimate Pikipek.</p> <p><strong>Status Ailments and Residual Damage</strong>: Burns completely stop Pikipek, making Scald users such as Chinchou and Will-O-Wisp users like Ponyta good answers to Pikipek. Toxic poison from Pokemon like Mareanie and special walls such as Spritzee and Munchlax is also a huge pain; finally, paralysis's Speed drop can completely shut it down. Pikipek takes constant damage from Life Orb and Brave Bird; it is also weak to Stealth Rock, takes damage from Hail (which is often seen on teams), is hit neutrally by all priority moves, and is weak to Ice Shard.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird is the main move Pikipek should be using, as it is a powerful STAB move that severely dents anything neutral to Flying and has a good chance to OHKO Timburr and Foongus. Skill Link Bullet Seed is what sets Pikipek apart from other Flying-types, allowing it to do a huge amount of damage to typical Flying-type checks such as Chinchou, Onix, and Shell Smash users such as Tirtouga and Omanyte. For the third moveslot, Brick Break is the prime choice because it can heavily damage Pawniard and Steel-types in general, which resist both Brave Bird and Bullet Seed; however, Drill Peck can be used as a more conservative STAB option when Pikipek's health is low. Finally, U-turn is used to gain momentum and works very well with Pikipek's boosted Speed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment is required in order to boost Pikipek's offensive presence, as without it, Pikipek may be in a difficult position when attempting to clean or damage the opposing team. Maximum Speed is also necessary, as it gives Pikipek the ability to outspeed Pokemon such as Jolly Choice Scarf Pawniard, +1 Jolly Scraggy, and Modest Choice Scarf Chinchou. Finally, 36 Def EVs allow Pikipek to take physical priority moves more easily. Choice Scarf boosts Pikipek's Speed to a very high level, outspeeding base 60 Speed Pokemon with a positive nature and a Choice Scarf like Pawniard. A Jolly nature should typically be chosen, because it allows Pikipek to outspeed 16 Speed Choice Scarf users such as Jolly Pawniard and Jolly Rufflet and Speed tie with 17 Speed Choice Scarf users like Jolly Mienfoo and Timid Chinchou, which is a notable benchmark. An Adamant nature is viable as well, since it significantly improves the chances of OHKOing Timburr and Foongus; however, Pikipek will only Speed tie with Pawniard and Rufflet and get outsped by Timid Chinchou and Jolly Mienfoo, making it the inferior choice.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Pikipek should be brought in early in the match, as it can be useful to gain momentum against the opposing lead, or to eliminate the opposing lead itself with Bullet Seed (in Onix's case) or severely dent it with a Brave Bird (in Mienfoo's case). U-turn or coverage moves should be used when a switch is predicted. Remember that Choice Scarf Pikipek is not going to punch huge holes in the opposing team; it should be played with \"hit-and-run\" tactics, with frequent switches out or U-turn uses, unless the opponent lacks a way to stop Pikipek; in that case, just spam Brave Bird or Bullet Seed on frail and slower enemies. Pikipek applies a large amount of pressure on its checks when it's paired with other powerful Flying-types such as Archen and Vullaby; the aforementioned partners can severely weaken the Flying-type checks, leaving Pikipek free to pick them all off.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A powerful Ground-type is a nice partner for Pikipek, as Pikipek suffers from the presence of Electric- and Steel-types; it also suffers from Rock-types, but Bullet Seed is almost always a good answer to them. Both Diglett and Drilbur can be helpful because they check Electric- and Steel-types like Pawniard, Magnemite, and in Mold Breaker Drilbur's case, Bronzor. Diglett can trap Magnemite and Pawniard, proceed to KO them with Earthquake, and set up Stealth Rock; on the other hand, Drilbur can set up Stealth Rock, remove the entry hazard from Pikipek's side of the field, and OHKO Magnemite with Sturdy thanks to Mold Breaker. Chinchou makes for a fine partner, because it has interesting type synergy with Pikipek; Chinchou can absorb Electric-type moves and resists Ice-type attacks, while Pikipek comes in on Ground-type moves and easily removes Grass-types. Pikipek has no real chance against Gastly if locked in Bullet Seed or Brick Break, and can't do anything at all to Honedge; this makes Choice Scarf Pawniard an excellent teammate for Pikipek, since it can trap both of these Ghost-types with Pursuit. In exchange, Pikipek is immune to the Ground-type moves that scare Pawniard away. Alolan Grimer plays a similar role, but it can run an Eviolite set to wall and trap Gastly by resisting both its STAB types, and trap Honedge without fearing a Sacred Sword too much. Finally, when paired with Nasty Plot Vullaby, Pikipek forms a powerful Flying-type core that uses both physical and special attacks, which weakens their shared checks.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird is a STAB option that packs a lot of power; however, in conjunction with Life Orb, it cuts Pikipek's HP very quickly. Drill Peck, on the other hand, is a less aggressive STAB option that preserves Pikipek's HP but is significantly weaker. Bullet Seed is a must, since it is a spectacular Grass-type coverage move against many Water- and Rock-types, notably OHKOing Onix and Tirtouga (even through Solid Rock), and deals an enormous amount of damage to Chinchou. As further coverage, Brick Break hits Pawniard very hard, OHKOing it even through Eviolite; on the other hand, Flame Charge boosts Pikipek's Speed, turning it into a potent sweeper once its checks and priority users are removed from the battle. Substitute is an interesting option that can be used as a reliable way to bypass Sucker Punch from Pawniard; it also protects Pikipek from status moves like Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave. Finally, U-turn can be used as well because Pikipek hits 17 Speed, outpacing many Pokemon and gaining momentum; it also does chip damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs spread is used to maximize Pikipek's Speed and Attack. Fully invested Speed with a Jolly nature allows Pikipek to hit 17 Speed, which let it outpace many Pokemon sitting at 16 Speed, such as Jolly Pawniard and Jolly Rufflet; note that Pikipek will still Speed tie with Jolly Onix and Jolly Mienfoo. The leftover 36 EVs are put into Defense to turn a guaranteed OHKO from Life Orb Jolly Pawniard Sucker Punch into a 56% chance to OHKO; they also reduce the amount of damage taken by Pikipek from other priority users, such as Timburr and Corphish. 10 HP IVs make Pikipek hit 19 HP, turning Life Orb recoil from 2 HP per move to 1 HP per move. Life Orb boosts Pikipek's damage output significantly, allowing Pikipek to OHKO Timburr and Foongus much more often.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set can be used in the first turns of the match to gain momentum against opposing leads; however, keep in mind that Jolly Pikipek Speed ties with Jolly non-Choice Scarf Mienfoo and, more dangerously, with Jolly Onix. Pikipek can work more efficiently when priority users (specifically Pawniard) and faster Electric- and Rock-types (including Choice Scarf Chinchou and Archen) are removed from the field. When using Pikipek, prediction is essential; even though Brave Bird or Drill Peck should be the move to spam the most, Bullet Seed should be used when a Chinchou or Rock-type switch-in is predicted, since it has a very high chance to KO speedy variants of Chinchou, while Brick Break or Flame Charge should be used only when it's obvious that a Steel-type is entering the battlefield or when the opponent struggles to deal with a +1 Speed Pikipek.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Diglett traps and removes Steel-, Electric-, and Rock-types, opening some holes for Pikipek; its Stealth Rock also helps turn 2HKOs into OHKOs. In a similar way, Drilbur can break through Electric- and Rock-types as well as Pawniard; it can also set up Stealth Rock for Pikipek and remove it from its side with Rapid Spin. Chinchou pairs very well with Pikipek, providing an Electric immunity, a resistance to Ice-type moves, good type synergy, and a slow Volt Switch to let Pikipek come in unscathed; in exchange, Pikipek removes Grass-types and helps with the Ground-types that trouble Chinchou. Remember that Diglett can outspeed Pikipek and OHKO it with Rock Slide. Pawniard and Alolan Grimer are good partners, as Pikipek lures in Honedge and allows them to Pursuit trap it. Strong priority users such as Carvanha, Corphish, Timburr, and Croagunk are good partners for Pikipek, because they help mitigate the issue with Diglett (especially Carvanha and Corphish), and also help against weather sweepers (in particular against Slush Rush users, such as Cubchoo and Alolan Sandshrew, that are problematic for Pikipek). Slow components of a VoltTurn core, like defensive Mienfoo and Chinchou, help Pikipek come in on things it can take advantage of, such as slow Ground-types like Hippopotas or Fighting-types such as Timburr. Pikipek itself is a nice U-turn user, gaining momentum against slower Electric-types if you opt for Chinchou as a partner. Since this set is more inclined to deal huge blows instead of pick off foes, Sticky Web support from Surskit can turn Life Orb Pikipek into a sweeping machine, easily outspeeding many foes at -1 Spe (just be wary of Defiant users such as Mankey and Pawniard). Finally, this Pikipek set is particularly good against slower Rock-types, making it a great member of \"bird spam\" cores that struggle against Rock-types.</p>"

  "Crabrawler": {
    "overview": "<p>Crabrawler is able to beat Pokemon that give Fighting-types trouble, such as Mudbray and Mareanie, thanks to its impressive coverage. Its decent Attack and Speed stats make it a good wallbreaker or late-game cleaner, and its passable bulk allows it to take resisted hits well. Its ability Hyper Cutter provides some use in not weakening the power of Crabrawler's moves. However, Crabrawler's bulk is not the best, and Iron Fist, usually an ideal ability for physical Fighting-types, is completely useless on it, as it does not have access to a good punch-based move. Furthermore, Crabrawler faces competition from other bulky attackers such as Mienfoo, Croagunk, and Timburr, as well as Mankey, which has a useful ability and access to Gunk Shot. It also does not have access to Knock Off, resulting it with a poor matchup against Psychic- and Ghost-types and meaning that Crabrawler requires a lot of support to help against them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thief can be used to hit Ghost-types and make Crabrawler a decent Knock Off absorber. Bulk Up lets Crabrawler attempt to sweep, but its main focus should simply be on attacking, not attempting to do something Mienfoo and Timburr outclasses it at. Rock Tomb allows Crabrawler to slow down the foe and potentially get another attack in the next turn.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Ghost-types</strong>: Crabrawler has no way to deal with bulky Ghost-types like Pumpkaboo and Frillish, which can easily burn and cripple it with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that resist Fighting such as Fairy-types, Slowpoke, and Foongus can wall Crabrawler, as it rarely runs any coverage to hit them. They all threaten to at least 2HKO Crabrawler in return.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Staryu, Abra, Doduo, and other faster, stronger Pokemon can threaten Crabrawler, but they usually cannot switch in safely due to Crabrawler's high-Base Power attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat is Crabrawler's best Fighting-type STAB move, dealing significant damage off of 17 Attack to anything that doesn't resist it. Crabhammer is a hard-hitting coverage move that 2HKOes Eviolite Mudbray. Earthquake hits Poison-types, such as Alolan Grimer and Mareanie, super effectively. Stone Edge is Crabrawler's best option against Flying-types like Rufflet and Vullaby, which are threatening otherwise; however, be aware of its poor accuracy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs, along with a Jolly nature, allow Crabrawler to reach 17 Speed and 17 Attack with an extra point in Defense. Life Orb allows Crabrawler to 2HKO Mudbray, offensive Vullaby, and Mareanie. Alternatively, Choice Scarf allows Crabrawler to utilize its good Speed and Attack and revenge kill better. Its unpredictability and Speed boost allow it to have a surprise factor at the cost of some power from Life Orb. However, Mankey and Mienfoo are better users of Choice Scarf, and they overshadow Crabrawler due to their access to U-turn and better abilities that complement their role as a revenge killer. Do note that if you forgo Life Orb, 0 HP IVs are unnecessary.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Crabrawler should spam its high-Base Power moves, no matter how much HP it has. While it has decent bulk, it cannot take too many neutral attacks, so be aware of that before switching it in recklessly. A resistance to Stealth Rock might be appealing, but Crabrawler is vulnerable to being severely worn down by Spikes and Toxic Spikes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Powerful Pursuit trappers such as Stunky, Alolan Grimer, and Pawniard synergize well with Crabrawler and can deal with the Psychic- and Ghost-types that threaten it. Ponyta can handle Pumpakboo and switch into Will-O-Wisp for Crabrawler. Staryu is able not only to remove entry hazards, but also to switch into Scald, which Crabrawler hates due to the fear of a crippling burn. Pokemon that can threaten Fairy-types, such as Magnemite and Gastly, make for great partners. Crabrawler pairs really well with other Fighting-types such as Mienfoo or Timburr, as they can break through each others' checks. Sticky Web support is useful for helping Life Orb Crabrawler outspeed Ponyta, as well as 15 Speed or lower Choice Scarf users, such as Magnemite.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Mareanie's fantastic defensive ability in Regenerator alongside its decent mixed bulk, access to reliable recovery, and typing allow it to function on balanced and defensive teams as a stellar defensive pivot as well as a reliable check to common threats in Mienfoo, Vullaby, Alolan Grimer, and more. Furthermore, Mareanie's expansive utility movepool, consisting of useful options in Haze, Toxic Spikes, and Scald, allows it to discourage setup sweepers and inflict foes with status to stall them out. Despite these perks, Mareanie's poor offensive stats make it quite passive, and its merely decent bulk still leaves it susceptible to the tier's common Electric- and Ground-type attacks as well as especially powerful wallbreakers in Abra and Gastly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Haze can be used in order to help Mareanie deal with threatening setup sweepers in Calm Mind Spritzee and Nasty Plot Croagunk more reliably by removing their stat boosts. Gunk Shot is Mareanie's most powerful attack, usually OHKOing Eviolite Snivy after Stealth Rock; however, its low accuracy and PP makes Sludge Bomb the preferred Poison-type STAB move most of the time. Covet allows Mareanie to simultaneously remove an enemy's item and possibly regain its Eviolite, but its Eviolite is easily removed again later on in the match and Knock Off is more reliable for removing the enemy's item. Sludge Wave is stronger than Sludge Bomb, but the poison chance from Sludge Bomb is usually more useful. Mareanie can use Toxic alongside its good bulk and recovery to cripple and stall out offensive and defensive threats alike, though due to the low HP stats of Pokemon in LC, this is rather difficult given the amount of time it takes for foes to take heavy damage from poison. Mareanie can also use its Merciless ability alongside Toxic or Toxic Spikes to guarantee critical hits on any poisoned target, though Mareanie is still fairly weak, it comes at the cost of Mareanie's invaluable pivoting recovery provided by Regenerator, and it's very situational given the tier's amount of Pokemon immune to poisoning or Toxic Spikes. A physical set with Liquidation can be used because of Mareanie's higher Attack stat; however, this usually isn't preferred due to Scald and Sludge Bomb's burn and poison chances. Mareanie can opt to run a Stockpile set to increase its tanking capabilities, but this is at the cost of typically more valuable utility options and makes Mareanie very passive. Mareanie can run Hidden Power Fire to hit Ferroseed, Hidden Power Fighting to hit Pawniard, Hidden Power Psychic to hit Croagunk, or Hidden Power Ground for Magnemite, but they are all situational given the low damage output against any foe that isn't 4x weak to them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers</strong>: Despite Mareanie's impressive mixed bulk, powerful wallbreakers like Life Orb Diglett, Cranidos, and Abra are capable of severely damaging or OHKOing it with their respective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Chinchou, Elekid, and Magnemite are capable of severely damaging Mareanie with their super effective STAB attacks and either forcing it to switch out or finishing it off.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Diglett, Mudbray, and Drilbur won't be able to switch into Mareanie's Scald, but will otherwise be able to threaten to OHKO it with their super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Croagunk</strong>: By virtue of its Dry Skin ability, Croagunk is immune to Mareanie's Scald, and it also resists Sludge Bomb. Furthermore, Croagunk can remove Mareanie's Toxic Spikes just by switching in, set up on it if it lacks Haze, and remove its Eviolite via Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Because Mareanie is so passive, it's often set up on and threatened by the likes of Vullaby, Timburr and Mienfoo.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is a useful STAB attack that has a decent chance to burn physical attackers such as Mudbray, Doduo, and Pawniard. Sludge Bomb is a good STAB attack that hits Fairy- and Grass- types such as Cottonee and Snubbull; the former is OHKOed and the latter is often 2HKOed. Recover provides Mareanie with an impressive amount of longevity and, alongside Regenerator, allows it to sustain itself throughout a match and stall out status-inflicted foes. Knock Off allows Mareanie to cripple switchins and support its more offensive teammates. Toxic Spikes allows Mareanie to support its teammates by poisoning foes; thanks to Regenerator, it is able to be set up consistently throughout a match. Iron Defense lets Mareanie obtain KOs without fear of being revenge-killed by Diglett when paired with a more physically bulky EV spread, set up alongside certain physical setup sweepers, and potentially sweep against physically inclined teams late game.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP EVs allow Mareanie to heal an extra hit point with Regenerator upon switching out, and 180 EVs in both Defense and Special Defense, a Calm nature, and an Eviolite allow Mareanie to optimize its bulk and tank powerful hits such as Snivy's unboosted Leaf Storm, Staryu's Psychic, and Ponyta's Wild Charge. If Iron Defense is run, the EV spread should be changed to 116 HP / 180 Def / 12 SpA / 180 SpD with a Bold nature, as this allows Mareanie to survive Diglett's Tectonic Rage after being Knocked Off at +2 Defense, and the extra recovery from Regenerator is less important. 92 EVs are invested in Special Attack to OHKO Eviolite-less Snivy, with the remainder dumped into Attack to slightly boost the power of Knock Off. However, 80 SpA EVs can be moved to Spe for an EV spread of 196 HP / 12 Atk / 100 Def / 12 SpA / 100 SpD / 76 Spe to tie with fast Timburr and outspeed slower variants of Mudbray, at the cost of a variety of damage rolls gained from 12 SpA. Regenerator is the preferred ability, as it allows Mareanie to switch out of attacks that threaten it, such as Mudbray's Earthquake or Abra's Psychic, and recover in the process.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Thanks to its Regenerator ability, typing, and good bulk, Mareanie is able to reliably switch into a plethora of fearsome attacks such as Mienfoo's High Jump Kick, Spritzee's Moonblast, and Rufflet's Superpower. Regenerator should be taken advantage of whenever possible, such as when threatened by a powerful attacker like Abra or when you predict a switch to a foe that threatens it. Because of Regenerator, Mareanie should try to avoid using Recover when it doesn't need to in order to preserve momentum. Because Mareanie forces switches against common Pokemon in Mienfoo and Ponyta, it often has access to free turns, which it should use to set up Toxic Spikes, try burning switch-ins with Scald, or recover. Despite its good bulk, Mareanie has glaring weaknesses to Ground-, Psychic-, and Electric-type attacks, which means it should pivot out of Pokemon with these types of attacks to avoid taking severe damage that compromises its tanking capabilities. Don't be conservative about using Haze if running it; it's better for Mareanie to use Haze and have the opponent KO it, as this will allow Mareanie's teammates to safely revenge kill a foe that hasn't accumulated any stat boosts. Mareanie is very reliant on Eviolite, and as a result, must be wary of super effective coverage options from the likes of Mienfoo and Timburr after having its Eviolite removed by Knock Off. Mareanie should also always be wary of Guts Timburr, as it is a prevalent threat that receives an Attack boost from status, thus discouraging the use of any of Mareanie's status-inflicting moves. Lastly, Mareanie should be wary of switching into a pivoting attacker such as Mienfoo or Pancham if Diglett is on the opposing team, as it will trap and KO Mareanie.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mareanie's poor Speed and passiveness often mean that it fits best on slower-paced teams due to otherwise being a less useful pick than Skrelp. Ferroseed is a fantastic teammate, as it appreciates Mareanie's Fire-type resistance, is able to provide additional entry hazards with Spikes or Stealth Rock, and it is able to come in on the Ground-, Psychic-, and Electric-type attacks that Mareanie hates taking. Diglett is also a good partner, as it can make use of its Arena Trap ability to trap and remove foes that absorb Toxic Spikes such as Alolan Grimer and Stunky. Pokemon that are capable of switching into or KOing Psychic-types, such as Ferroseed, Pawniard, Magnemite, and Carvanha, all make for fantastic partners that can help Mareanie ease the pressure that Psychic-types like Abra and Slowpoke put on it, while Electric-type checks such as Onix, Drilbur, Diglett, and Chinchou are all either able to switch into or eliminate common Electric-types in Magnemite and Elekid that Mareanie hates dealing with. Grass-types such as Snivy and Cottonee appreciate Mareanie's ability to tank Bug-, Ice-, Fire-, and Poison-type attacks. In return, Mareanie appreciates the aforementioned Pokemon's abilities to switch into Electric- and Ground- type attacks that it hates taking. Fairy-types such as Spritzee and Snubbull appreciate Mareanie's ability to tank the Steel- and Poison-type attacks that threaten them, while Ghost-types such as Gastly, Pumpkaboo-XL, and Honedge are useful teammates for Mareanie because of their ability to prevent users of Rapid Spin from removing Toxic Spikes. Mienfoo, Buneary, and Ponyta are all examples of Pokemon that appreciate the Toxic Spikes support Mareanie provides, as it helps them break through bulkier threats. Lastly, if Mareanie isn't running Haze, it appreciates other phazers such as Hippopotas and Munchlax as teammates, as its team won't be as vulnerable to threatening setup sweepers.</p>"

  "Mudbray": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to an excellent defensive ability in Stamina as well as good defensive stats, Mudbray is one of the best defensive Pokemon in Little Cup. It also has an incredible base 100 Attack stat as well as excellent physical coverage, allowing it to run a viable offensive set as well. Even with no investment, it still reaches an impressive 17 Attack, meaning defensive sets are still not passive at all. Additionally, even though it is slow, it can reach 14 Speed without a Jolly nature, meaning it can run a Choice Scarf set to catch its opponents off guard.</p> <p>However, Mudbray lacks reliable recovery outside of Rest, meaning that it is prone to being worn down over time. Without a Choice Scarf, Mudbray will also usually be outsped by offensive Pokemon, which sometimes means it struggles to switch into them without being forced to use Rest immediately, thus losing your team momentum. Lastly, since Mudbray doesn't fulfill a specific role, it is sometimes difficult to fit on a team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Roar works well in conjunction with Stealth Rock. Bulldoze or Rock Tomb can be used on any set to lower the Speed of foes, but the low power is very noticeable. Superpower is an option over Close Combat if you prefer the Attack drop compared to the Special Defense drop. Toxic can be used to cripple bulky switch-ins, but Mudbray does enough damage to 2HKO them most of the time instead.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Snivy can switch into Mudbray and take any of its moves and proceed to OHKO with Leaf Storm, getting a Special Attack boost in the progress. Pumpkaboo-Super can take all of Mudbray's hits well and threaten it with Giga Drain or Will-O-Wisp. Foongus can take Mudbray's hits well, though it is usually 2HKOed by Earthquake after Stealth Rock by an offensive set. Lastly, Cottonee can take any of Mudbray's moves except for Heavy Slam with ease.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon</strong>: Since most of Mudbray's damage comes from its STAB Earthquake, Pokemon that are immune to it can take significantly less damage from Mudbray. Though Flying-types are hit super effectively by Rock Slide, defensive Vullaby is not 2HKOed by it, and Bronzor only has a small chance to be 2HKOed by Close Combat after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Powerful Water-types like Chinchou and Staryu can 2HKO even defensive Mudbray with a super effective STAB move while outspeeding it.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Since Stamina doesn't influence their damage, powerful special attackers such as Abra, Gastly, and special Carvanha can break through Mudbray with relative ease.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is Mudbray's strongest move. Heavy Slam deals good damage thanks to Mudbray's weight and provides excellent neutral coverage with Earthquake, and it notably 2HKOes Spritzee, Snubbull, and Cottonee, all of which can take Earthquake with ease. Rock Slide hits the Bug- and Flying-types that can switch into Earthquake super effectively, OHKOing Larvesta and Doduo as well as 2HKOing Rufflet after Stealth Rock and non-Eviolite variants of Vullaby. Stealth Rock allows Mudbray to support the team, and synergizes well with how easily it forces switches. If Stealth Rock isn't needed, Close Combat hits certain Pokemon that take any of Mudbray's other moves, such as Munchlax and Ferroseed, super effectively, 2HKOing both of them.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Stamina is the ability of choice because it allows Mudbray to take hits from certain physical attackers such as bulky Mienfoo and Ferroseed. Eviolite allows Mudbray to survive OHKOs from almost the entire metagame and lets it come in on Knock Off users more easily, whereas Berry Juice is used because it can give Mudbray as second chance at wallbreaking after it drops below half HP. It can also aid in acquiring Stamina boosts, as it can get one or two boosts and then be healed up completely, keeping the boosts and making it harder for foes to knock it out. 196 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature maximize Mudbray's Attack, allowing it to hit as hard as possible, while 116 HP and 36 Defense EVs allow Mudbray to take hits from weaker physical attackers such as bulky Mienfoo consistently. 156 Speed EVs give Mudbray 13 Speed, outspeeding threats such as Timburr, Skrelp, and Alolan Grimer, but a slower EV spread of 116 HP / 196 Atk / 36 Def / 156 SpD is also usable.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mudbray should try and set up Stealth Rock early on in the game to support its team. After that, Earthquake is Mudbray's most spammable attack. Thanks to Mudbray's high Attack stat, it hits incredibly hard against anything that doesn't resist or is immune to it. When a switch is predicted, don't be afraid to use the appropriate coverage moves. Mudbray hits hard even with coverage moves, meaning that it is difficult to stay in even if it is not using Earthquake. Since Berry Juice is quite important to extend Mudbray's longevity, switching into a potential Knock Off is usually not recommended.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Foongus is an excellent partner for Mudbray, as it can beat both Water- and Grass-types, all of which threaten Mudbray. Other Snivy checks such as Vullaby and Rufflet are also good partners, since Snivy is easily able to KO Mudbray and get a boost in the progress. Pokemon that can take out Flying-types such as Pursuit Pawniard and Chinchou help Mudbray, as they can allow it to use Earthquake more freely. Fairy-types like Spritzee and Snubbull appreciate Mudbray taking out Fire-, Ground-, and Poison-types. Calm Mind Spritzee especially has a chance to win after Mudbray takes out its counters. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Munchlax work well with Mudbray, since the latter's high Defense allows it to check the physically offensive Pokemon that threaten the specially defensive Pokemon.</p>"
      },
      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is Mudbray's best STAB move and deals good damage to its foes. Rest heals Mudbray to full HP and removes any status ailments it might have, greatly increasing its longevity and allowing to wall threats multiple times throughout a match. Sleep Talk allows Mudbray to attack during the two turns of sleep that are caused by Rest, meaning it is not completely passive during that time. Since Mudbray is one of the heaviest Pokemon in Little Cup, Heavy Slam deals great damage, notably 2HKOing Spritzee and Snubbull and its Steel typing provides excellent neutral coverage alongside Earthquake. Alternatively, Rock Slide also gives Mudbray good neutral coverage, as it hits the Flying- and Bug-types that can switch into Earthquake super effectively, OHKOing Doduo, Choice Scarf Rufflet, and Dewpider after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite raises Mudbray's bulk to incredible levels and thus increases its longevity in combination with Rest. Stamina allows Mudbray to wall many physical attackers, such as Pawniard, Timburr, and Mienfoo, as the ability gives it a Defense boost each time it gets hit. The Special Defense and HP investment in combination with a Careful nature efficiently raises Mudbray's bulk with an Eviolite and allow it to nearly always avoid the 2HKO from Magnemite's Flash Cannon. 116 Attack EVs give Mudbray a good chance to OHKO offensive Mienfoo after Stealth Rock and allow it to OHKO non-Eviolite Mareanie with Earthquake, as well as 2HKO Spritzee with Heavy Slam. The leftover EVs are put into Defense to raise it by one point and hit another Eviolite number.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mudbray should usually be switched in when an opposing physical attacker is predicted to go for a weaker move. For example, Mienfoo going for Drain Punch instead of High Jump Kick, or Timburr going for Mach Punch. It will usually take the hit quite well while getting a Defense boost in the progress thanks to Stamina. This boost can allow it to wall the physical attacker further. Be careful of staying in and using Rest against special attackers. Many of them will be able to 3HKO Mudbray, meaning that the duration of the sleep that Rest causes is too long to wall them. Don't be afraid of using Earthquake a lot. Thanks to Mudbray's high Attack stat, it will significantly hurt any foe that does not resist or is immune to it. Rest should be used when Mudbray is running low on HP to recover all of its health. While Mudbray is sleeping, Sleep Talk should be used to potentially hit the foe hard. Keep in mind that every time Mudbray uses Rest, it can use Sleep Talk exactly twice. After that, it will wake up, and a different move should be used.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Checks for Grass-types such as Vullaby, Doduo, and Foongus are all great teammates for Mudbray, as it greatly fears their super effective STAB moves. Pokemon that can check Water-types, such as the aforementioned Foongus as well as Ferroseed and Chinchou, are also greatly appreciated. Phazers such as Munchlax and Mareanie help Mudbray remove bulky setup sweepers, such as Timburr and Shellder, which are able to set up on it. Fairy-types such as Spritzee and Snubbull appreciate Mudbray checking Steel-, Fire-, and Poison-types.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake reaches incredible power with Mudbray's high Attack stat and STAB. Heavy Slam deals really nice damage because of how heavy Mudbray is and has great neutral coverage in combination with Earthquake, notably 2HKOing Spritzee, Snubbull, and Cottonee, which can all take Earthquake with ease. Rock Slide hits the Bug- and Flying-types that can switch into Earthquake super effectively, OHKOing Larvesta and Doduo and 2HKOing non-Eviolite variants of Vullaby as well as Rufflet after Stealth Rock. Close Combat 2HKOes Munchlax and Ferroseed, both of which take any of Mudbray's other moves well.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf in combination with 236 Speed EVs allow Mudbray to hit 21 Speed, thus outspeeding the every unboosted Pokemon in Little Cup. 196 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature allow Mudbray to hit as hard as possible, notably reliably OHKOing Life Orb Staryu after Stealth Rock. A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed opposing 14 Speed Choice Scarf users, such as Modest Magnemite and Adamant Scraggy. The leftover EVs are placed into HP and Defense to raise both by one point. Stamina is the ability of choice to reliably take hits from weaker physical attackers such as bulky Mienfoo and Ferroseed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Since Choice Scarf Mudbray is uncommon, your opponent will usually not expect it. Use this to your advantage by not revealing that Mudbray has a Choice Scarf too early in the match. Mudbray can be used to revenge kill Pokemon such as Chinchou and Ferroseed, though if the former is holding a Choice Scarf it will outspeed and potentially KO Mudbray. Be careful of locking Mudbray into Earthquake if the opponent still has a Ground-immune Pokemon remaining. They will easily be able to come in and set up or do significant damage to Mudbray or one of its teammates. This set can also be used as a lure for Staryu and Snivy. Staryu is 2HKOed by Earthquake, while Heavy Slam does the same to Snivy and, since they expect to outspeed and OHKO Mudbray, they will often switch in. Thanks to the Choice Scarf, Mudbray can surprise them and knock them out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Checks to Flying-types help Mudbray, as they can often come in when Mudbray is locked into Earthquake. Pursuit Pawniard is especially good, as it can not only check Flying-types but also trap other Ground-immune Pokemon such as Gastly and Bronzor. Foongus is an excellent partner for Mudbray, as it can take on the Water- and Grass-types that threaten Mudbray. Entry hazard setters such as Ferroseed can use Stealth Rock or Spikes to break the foe's Sturdy, allowing Mudbray's Earthquake to get knock outs more easily. Fairy-types appreciate Mudbray's ability to KO Fire-, Ground-, and Poison-types. Calm Mind Spritzee in particular appreciates Mudbray taking out its counters so that it can potentially sweep.</p>"

  "Morelull": {
    "overview": "<p>With very good defensive stats, a passable Special Attack stat, and a cool signature move in Strength Sap, Morelull can make for a relatively good defensive pivot. Spore and Moonblast add to this by putting switch-ins to sleep and catching incoming Fighting-types, respectively, as does its ability, Effect Spore. However, Morelull is commonly outclassed by the many other bulky Grass-types such as Ferroseed, Lileep, and most of all, Foongus, which also acts as a defensive pivot with Spore but has access to Regenerator. With the rise of Poison-types in SM, Morelull struggles to find a teamslot over Foongus due to its 4x weakness to the type, but its Fairy typing and slightly wider support movepool can certainly grant it a niche. It also struggles with a relatively passive playstyle in a very offensive metagame, making it unwelcome on many teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Using Thunder Wave could work, but it usually isn't worth using, since giving up damage, recovery, or the utility of Spore often isn't worth it. A more specially defensive set using Strength Sap to deal with physical threats and an EV spread of 116 HP / 156 Def / 236 SpD with a Calm nature could work in theory, but that wouldn't let it survive long enough against these threats to pull it off. Leech Seed, though it may look appealing, isn't as good in practice; if Morelull is switching around a lot as it should be, the foe will usually do so as well. Using Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Fighting could surprise unsuspecting Ferroseed and Pawniard on the switch, respectively, but it isn't recommended, as it only hits a few Pokemon. Light Screen could provide extra utility, but there is usually no room for it on a set, and it generally isn't good in Little Cup.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Due to Morelull's 4x weakness to Poison, every Poison-type in Little Cup can beat it on their own. They also all resist at least one of its STAB moves, giving Morelull an extremely tough time inflicting even the slightest amount of damage.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Resisting both of Morelull's STAB options along with being generally bulky makes Steel-types quite hard for Morelull to deal with. Pawniard in particular is troublesome due to it gaining extra Attack via Defiant when Strength Sap is used against it, making it the probable best counter to Morelull.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Similarly to Steel-types, Fire-types resist Morelull's STAB options and many of them in Little Cup, mainly Larvesta and Ponyta, can be quite bulky. Additionally, many Fire-types are special attackers, making them essentially unaffected by Strength Sap.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers with Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Although Morelull is fairly specially bulky, a super effective special attack from Pokemon like Magnemite and Houndour can usually 2HKO it, and Morelull can't reliably recover enough HP to avoid the 2HKO.</p>",

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spore is used to cripple foes and to more safely guarantee recovery with Strength Sap. Moonblast is Morelull's main Fairy-type STAB move, and is very useful for hitting common threats such as Vullaby, Mienfoo, and Scraggy while also having a fairly good chance to lower the foe's Special Attack stat, which can become quite annoying to deal with in conjunction with Strength Sap. Giga Drain is Morelull's Grass-type STAB move and is another good form of recovery, able to score a KO while recovering HP. Strength Sap is very unique and quite good in Little Cup because, unlike other forms of recovery in the tier, Morelull gains more than 50% of its HP back by using this move against most physical attackers, and it weakens their offensive potential by lowering their Attack. The move is less effective against special attackers, however. It is also important to note that Strength Sap deals no damage. All in all, it is a fairly good move, and it is one of Morelull's main niches over Foongus.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Morelull's EV spread is used to maximize its Defense and Special Defense when used with Eviolite, and the HP and Special Attack EVs help Morelull's pivoting potential. A Bold nature also helps to maximize its Defense. Eviolite boosts Morelull's Defense and Special Defense to help it take hits better. Effect Spore is the only viable ability on Morelull and it certainly has its perks, as it can passively apply status without Morelull needing to use up a moveslot, but it can sometimes incorrectly status the foe with what you don't want it to, such as poisoning a sweeper instead of paralyzing it or putting it to sleep.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to its bulk, Morelull can freely switch into any resisted attack and many neutral attacks. Try to avoid staying in on Poison-types such as Croagunk, Mareanie, and Stunky. Using Strength Sap to heal up when you predict a physical attacker switching in can both heal Morelull and lower the Attack of said foe. However, even when pivoting, never be careless with letting Morelull lose excessive amounts of health, as its recovery is not passive like Foongus's, and it doesn't work very well against special attackers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Other pivots, particularly offensive ones such as Mienfoo, Chinchou, and Magnemite, are good partners for Morelull's playstyle and can help get it in without taking too much damage. Salandit, although particularly niche, has good type synergy with Morelull, resisting Poison-, Fire-, and Steel-type moves, and it can help break opposing walls for Morelull. Mareanie also has good type synergy with Morelull and can help with resisting the ever-present Water-types of Little Cup. Pawniard also boasts good type synergy and a similar wallbreaking nature with Knock Off. A special wall such as Munchlax can help cover some attackers that Morelull can't beat such as Abra. Rapid Spin and Defog users can help keep Morelull from taking damage every time it pivots in. Diglett can trap Poison- and Steel-types for Morelull that would otherwise threaten it.</p>"

  "Salandit": {
    "overview": "<p>Salandit can make for a relatively good wallbreaker with its high Speed, good offensive typing, and good Special Attack. Its hidden ability, Oblivious, lets it set up Nasty Plot without needing to worry about being Taunted; getting Taunted is not a big problem for most set up sweepers in the first place, but it can be useful. However, Salandit's huge weakness to trappers largely holds it back from its full potential. It also has paper-thin defenses, being OHKOed by almost every super effective hit. But, despite its weaknesses, Salandit can shine through in the right scenarios.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Using Flamethrower over Fire Blast could work, but it doesn't provide the necessary amount of power to justify using it for accuracy alongside Sludge Bomb. Knock Off can help Salandit wallbreak much more easily and is probably its best option not listed on the set above, but giving up a moveslot to use it isn't recommended. A set utilizing Salandit's signature ability, Corrosion, to poison all opponents could work if stall was more viable in Little Cup, but since it isn't a common archetype, there is no need to counter it. Similarly, a set using Venoshock in conjunction with Toxic may be used to do extra damage to all targets, but the ever-present Steel-types completely shut it down. Flame Charge can be used to help Salandit get around trappers and other fast Pokemon, but Salandit can't make room on its moveset to use it. Hidden Power Grass instead of Hidden Power Ground could work to more easily beat Water-types, but it doesn't check as many threats as Hidden Power Ground does. Salandit's high Speed stat could warrant a Taunt set, but it is easily OHKOed by many common Stealth Rock users such as Onix.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Trappers</strong>: Diglett is one of the most common Pokemon in Little Cup, and sadly obliterates Salandit in its own way. First of all, Diglett traps and outspeeds Salandit, and since Salandit has no relevant priority, Diglett can easily KO it. In a similar vein, Wynaut, while not as prevalent, is able to tank an attack and KO Salandit. These Pokemon are what significantly lowers Salandit's viability and are very important to note.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Although they cannot trap Salandit, many common Choice Scarf users and naturally fast Pokemon can stop Salandit with ease, the most notable and common of these being Choice Scarf Chinchou, Abra, and Carvanha.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy + Berry Juice Users</strong>: Onix, Dwebble, and even Magnemite commonly carry options to OHKO Salandit, namely Earthquake, Rock Blast, and Hidden Power Ground. In return, Salandit can do almost nothing unless Stealth Rock or Spikes are set up on the opponent's side.</p> <p><strong>Ground- and Water-types</strong> Although they usually can't safely switch in, many bulky Ground- and Water-types such as Numel and Staryu can take one hit and KO Salandit. Many Water-types also carry Aqua Jet, a priority move that will usually knock it out.</p> <p><strong>Munchlax</strong> Munchlax's incredible special bulk and high Attack can let it simultaneously wall and KO Salandit with a STAB Body Slam.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Poisonium Z": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sludge Bomb is Salandit's main Poison-type STAB move, and in combination with Poisonium Z, it grants Salandit one extremely powerful attack per game, usually OHKOing Staryu, Ponyta, and Mienfoo after Stealth Rock and almost always KOing Slowpoke after a regular Sludge Bomb—all of these Pokemon are able to easily take any other move. Fire Blast is Salandit's other STAB option and is its most powerful move bar Acid Downpour, OHKOing Pawniard after Stealth Rock and Ferroseed from full HP. Hidden Power Grass hits Rock-types which would otherwise wall Salandit for super effective damage. It can also hit Water- and Ground-types, but the former are usually hit harder by Sludge Bomb and the latter by Fire Blast. Flame Charge allows Salandit to boost its Speed to let it sweep and provides a bit of chip damage on foes, which can really help in KOing certain Pokemon such as Staryu and Choice Scarf users such as Chinchou, Mienfoo, and Pawniard. Additionally, if Salandit gets to +1 Speed via Flame Charge, it can outspeed Life Orb Diglett, which would otherwise trap and OHKO it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Poisonium Z gives Salandit a one-use super powerful move. 220 Speed EVs and a Timid nature give Salandit 18 Speed, letting it outspeed much of the metagame before a Flame Charge boost and even most Choice Scarf users after. 192 Special Attack EVs help Salandit do maximum damage, and the leftover EVs are put into Defense and Special Defense to help Salandit survive more hits. It is notable that the remaining EVs are not put into HP to let Salandit switch into Stealth Rock four times without fainting.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Poisonium Z Salandit's main function is to sweep, clean, wallbreak, and in some cases revenge kill. Due to Salandit's poor defensive stats, it should rarely be directly switched into attacks and should instead be used as a revenge killer or simply be brought in through a U-turn or Volt Switch user. Flame Charge should only be used in two certain scenarios: if a Pokemon that can't do much to Salandit such as Spritzee is in, and if a Pokemon that can be KOed is in, usually either a Pokemon on a sliver of HP due to Focus Sash or Sturdy or a weakened Grass- or Ice-type. If the opponent has a Pokemon with Weak Armor, such as Onix or Kabuto, you should be extra careful about using Flame Charge, as if these Pokemon switch in on it, it can give them a Speed boost. In fact, if necessary, you can try and predict the switch, then pick off the incoming Pokemon with Hidden Power Grass. Salandit should usually be saved for late in the game, but if necessary, it can function as a fairly good revenge killer. Sweeping with Salandit is also best done when a good opportunity to use Flame Charge presents itself. Try to save Acid Downpour for when it can KO a Pokemon that would otherwise be a big threat, such as Staryu. All of Salandit's checks should be removed before an attempted sweep. If Diglett is alive on your opponent's team, Salandit is in a position where if it scores a KO without being at +1 Speed, it will easily be trapped and eliminated. Therefore, be sure to always eliminate Diglett before using Salandit. As a riskier option, Salandit can use Flame Charge on a predicted switch of a faster Pokemon, Choice Scarf Chinchou and Ponyta being notable, but, again, this is extremely risky. It can also use Acid Downpour in these situations to merely remove these threats.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Grass-types such as Pumpkaboo-XL, Foongus, and Ferroseed can all check the Water- and Ground-types that give Salandit trouble. Slow U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Chinchou, Mienfoo, and Vullaby can help safely get Salandit in. Vullaby and Alolan Grimer can also deal with Abra, a Pokemon that otherwise greatly threatens Salandit, although having too many Poison-types on one team can leave you open to Diglett and other Ground-types. Additionally, Vullaby can remove entry hazards for Salandit, as it is quite weak to them; Staryu, Drilbur, or Kabuto can also fulfill this role. On the other side, hazard setters such as Dwebble, Ferroseed, and Onix can help give Salandit the chip damage it so often needs to KO major threats, primarily Staryu. Fighting-types, mainly Mienfoo and Timburr, can remove Munchlax and commonly carry Knock Off, which can remove items from other bulky threats. Croagunk in particular makes for a good Water-type check, although as mentioned above too many Poison-types leaves one weak to Ground-types. Knock Off users in general can help Salandit sweep through bulkier Pokemon, with Pawniard and Kabuto utilizing it quite well. Corphish in particular can wear down Salandit's checks for it, easily defeating Ground-, Rock-, and Fire-types, while Salandit can take down almost all of Corphish's checks, such as Croagunk, Ferroseed, Foongus, and Cottonee. Salandit pairs well with other offensive Fire-types such as Ponyta by breaking down shared checks early on so the other can sweep, though this stacks weaknesses.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot is used to set up for a sweep. Sludge Bomb is Salandit's main Poison-type STAB move; its 100% accuracy can be very useful for guaranteed damage. Fire Blast is Salandit's Fire-type STAB move and is an extremely powerful move in general used to defeat many common Steel-types such as Ferroseed and Pawniard. Hidden Power Grass covers the Rock-types such as Onix and Omanyte that Salandit's STAB moves cannot hit. Hidden Power Ground requires a Nasty Plot boost or prior damage to KO most Rock-types, but hits Mareanie harder than any of Salandit's other moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb is Salandit's main item to boost its attacking moves, and the 3 IVs in HP are used to minimize damage done by Life Orb each turn. A Timid nature maximizes Salandit's Speed so that it can reach 18 Speed to outpace some of LC's most common attackers, such as Mienfoo, Snivy, and Drilbur. Salandit's Oblivious ability lets it guarantee the set up of a Nasty Plot against Taunt users if it can avoid being KOed long enough to do so. Most of Salandit's EVs are put into Special Attack and Speed to maximize damage output, while the rest of the EVs are put into Defense and Special Defense to help it potentially endure an attack while it is setting up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Conserving Salandit until the late-game is usually the best option, but if your opponent has many ways to stop Salandit from sweeping, it can be used to make a dent in their team before they can deal with it. If you think Sludge Bomb will knock out your foe, it is always good to use it over Fire Blast, as risking a miss can result in an immediate stop to Salandit's sweep. Be sure to eliminate all opposing threats before attempting to sweep, as sweeps can be stopped very easily by one of Salandit's many counters. Only use Nasty Plot when you're confident you can pull off a sweep and when all threats are gone, as a poorly timed Nasty Plot can result in a KOed Salandit.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dark-types, namely Vullaby, Pawniard, and Alolan Grimer, surprisingly make for the best partners for Salandit, as they can stop Abra in its tracks. Vullaby and Stunky can be useful for removing hazards, and Pawniard can set them up. Bulky Grass-types such as Foongus, Ferroseed, and Morelull can check many Water- and Ground-types such as Diglett and Chinchou for Salandit, while Salandit can break through Steel-types that wall them and Ice-types that KO them. Salandit helps Fairy-types immensely by removing troublesome Steel-types, while many Fairy-types such as Spritzee and Snubbull can use utility moves to keep Salandit healthy. Pokemon who can set up Stealth Rock to break opposing Sturdy Pokemon are extremely useful for Salandit to have on its side, as many of them can stop it in its tracks. Honedge can check Abra, making it useful to have. Scraggy and Snivy can take advantage of Diglett and set up on it, making them ideal partners for beating it.</p>"

  "Stufful": {
    "overview": "<p>Stufful is a unique and decent setup sweeper that can also function as an emergency check to physical attackers. Thanks to Fluffy and a good HP stat, Stufful is very physically bulky and can check Pokemon like Pawniard. It's not passive, either, hitting 18 Attack and getting access to Swords Dance. Normal / Fighting is a good offensive typing, letting Stufful's STAB moves hit almost the entire metagame, bar Ghost-types, for at least neutral damage. Stufful also gets good coverage moves like Ice Punch to hit Grass-types such as Pumpkaboo-XL and Foongus, Earthquake to hit Poison-types like Mareanie and Alolan Grimer, and Rock Slide to hit Flying- and Fire-types such as Vullaby and Larvesta. Unfortunately, for a sweeper, Stufful is quite slow, and while its physical bulk is phenomenal, its Special Defense is poor. It is completely walled by Ghost-types due to its only way of hitting them hard, Brutal Swing, having such a low Base Power. Fluffy gives Stufful a pseudo-weakness to Fire, meaning it is easily pressured by special Fire-types like Houndour and, to a lesser extent, physical Fire-types like Ponyta and Larvesta. As a result, Stufful is easily revenge killed and requires significant support to thrive. Stufful's best Fighting-type STAB attack with no drawback is Brick Break, and it misses out on the better STAB moves that other Fighting-types get, like Drain Punch, High Jump Kick, and Close Combat. Even with Fluffy, Stufful struggles against opposing Fighting-types and almost always loses against them one-on-one. Thus, it faces incredible amounts of competition from top-tier Fighting-types like Croagunk, Mienfoo, and Timburr, since many of the things Stufful does, they do as well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hammer Arm is usable, but it's not ideal because of the Speed drop; this causes Stufful to be outsped by Timburr and leaves it vulnerable to its Drain Punch. Substitute in conjunction with Swords Dance can be used to capitalize on status move users like Ferroseed and Foongus, but Stufful already has too few slots to carry all the coverage it wants. Thus, an all-out attacking set is an option as well, but without a boost Stufful is often too weak to effectively wallbreak or sweep. Bulk Up is an option, but it lacks the power that Swords Dance provides in order to get KOs. A Bulk Up set is also outclassed by Timburr due to the latter's better defensive typing, access to priority and Knock Off, and passive recovery in the form of Drain Punch. Rock Slide is an option to hit Flying-types and Larvesta and has a nifty flinch chance, but Ice Punch is often the better bet, since Larvesta isn't very common. Other coverage moves such as Thunder Punch, Brutal Swing, and Aerial Ace are options, but the Pokemon that would be hit by these moves are already hit hard enough by Stufful's STAB moves or other coverage attacks. In the case of Brutal Swing, it can be used to hit Ghost-types, but it is simply so weak that switching out to a Ghost-type check or counter often works just as well, if not better.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fast Special Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Abra, Elekid, and Staryu outspeed Stufful and threaten its much weaker Special Defense, forcing the sweep to end early on.</p> <p><strong>Foongus</strong>: Foongus survives a +2 Ice Punch from full health and can use Clear Smog to remove Swords Dance boosts or Spore to put Stufful to sleep, ending its sweep. It can also recover health by switching out thanks to Regenerator. However, if Stealth Rock is up, Foongus has a chance to faint to a +2 Ice Punch.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type moves deal double damage to Stufful, and Fire-types such as Ponyta and Larvesta can burn Stufful and cut its Attack in half with Will-O-Wisp or Flame Body.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types are immune to both of Stufful's STAB moves, so it has to rely on its coverage move to hit them. Gastly in particular is immune to all of Stufful's attacks if Earthquake is Stufful's final move. Pumpkaboo can work as a decent check, but it is threatened by Ice Punch.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Spritzee and Cottonee resist Brick Break and Superpower and threaten Stufful with their super effective STAB Fairy-type attacks. Cottonee can even use Encore to lock Stufful into an undesirable move, giving the momentum to the opponent. However, no Fairy-type can OHKO Stufful unboosted, so they may lose if switching directly into a Swords Dance or, in Cottonee's case, Ice Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance gives Stufful the power it needs to break through foes. STAB Return is a very hard neutral hit on most of the tier. Brick Break provides good coverage with Return, hitting the Rock- and Steel-types that resist Return, such as Onix, Magnemite, and Pawniard, super effectively. It also breaks through Aurora Veil strategies as well as Light Screen and Reflect. Superpower is an option if you want Stufful to run a wallbreaker set; while it greatly reduces Stufful's sweeping potential, Superpower almost always 2HKOes Mienfoo and OHKOes Sturdy + Berry Juice Onix if its Sturdy is broken. However, the Defense and Attack drops from Superpower force Stufful out after one or two hits. Ice Punch provides a good option to hit Foongus and Pumpkaboo-XL hard, the latter of which is immune to both of Stufful's STAB attacks. Earthquake can secure OHKOs on Berry Juice Croagunk before a Swords Dance boost, and Mareanie and Alolan Grimer after a boost. It also hits Fire-types super effectively, which threaten Stufful massively otherwise.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>236 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature make sure Stufful hits as hard as possible, allowing it to obtain KOs on Vullaby, Foongus, and Pumpkaboo-XL after a Swords Dance boost and Stealth Rock damage. 36 Speed EVs let Stufful reach 12 Speed, outspeeding Pumpkaboo-XL, Bulk Up Timburr, and anything below 18 Speed if Sticky Web is on your opponent's side of the field. Fluffy is by far Stufful's best ability, halving the damage taken from all contact moves. 36 Defense EVs let Stufful reach an even Defense stat, thus efficiently boosting its Defense with Eviolite. 196 Special Defense EVs give Stufful an even number as well and boost up its average special bulk, letting it take a Psychic from Focus Sash Abra at full health. Eviolite, especially when combined with Fluffy, provides Stufful with more opportunities to set up and stay healthy long enough to sweep.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Stufful can be used to sweep late-game after strong special attackers and its checks have been removed, but it can also be used as an early-game wallbreaker, especially if it's running Superpower. Swords Dance lets it break through bulky Pokemon early-game. Superpower should be saved for when most of the opposing Pokemon are hit hard by it, since Stufful will usually need to switch out after using it due to the stat drops. Stufful can be used to tank weaker attacks that make contact throughout the game like Knock Off from Pawniard. Don't let it take many special hits, or even a few strong ones, from the likes of Staryu, Gastly, and Magnemite; it doesn't have the best special bulk, and you would mainly be wasting its fantastic physical bulk, so you should let a teammate take special hits instead. Fairy-types generally stop Stufful's sweep, so they need to be taken out beforehand; Cottonee can lock Stufful into an undesirable move with Prankster Encore, and Spritzee survives a Swords Dance-boosted Return and can KO a weakened Stufful back with Moonblast. It's important for Stufful to only set up when its checks such as Foongus and Pumpkaboo-XL have been weakened, as they otherwise stop its sweep. Swords Dance should be used against a Pokemon that Stufful forces out, such as Pawniard or Alolan Sandshrew, or a physical attacker that can't do much damage to Stufful, like Onix or Diglett. Finally, be careful of all Fire-type moves; Fluffy doubles all damage taken from Fire-type attacks, effectively giving Stufful a weakness to them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can trap special attackers and take them out make good teammates for Stufful. Alolan Grimer is a great option because it can use Pursuit on powerful Psychic- and Ghost-types like Abra and Gastly. Pokemon that can handle the many Fighting- and Fairy-types that threaten Stufful are also good teammates. Foongus can deal with both of those types, as well as the Water-types that might be using Scald, causing Stufful to risk being burned. Snubbull, Ponyta, and Alolan Grimer are also decent Fighting- and Fairy-type checks. Entry hazard setters such as Dwebble and Onix help Stufful secure certain KOs when it would normally just fall short. Knock Off support helps Stufful break past bulky Pokemon, such as Spritzee, Vullaby, and Foongus, that would normally survive a Swords Dance-boosted hit by removing their Eviolite. Good Knock Off users include Mienfoo, which can provide pivot support, and Timburr, which can absorb status. Due to Fluffy, Pokemon that can deal with Fire-types are good teammates as well; examples include Staryu, Chinchou, and Diglett. Stufful is very strong but very slow for a sweeper, so Sticky Web support from Surskit or Spinarak makes Stufful much better, allowing it to outspeed a large portion of the metagame.</p>"

  "Wimpod": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to access to Spikes and Taunt as well as having a great Speed stat, Wimpod can function as a decent suicide lead on offensive teams, as it is the fastest user of Spikes. Thanks to its 18 Speed, it can notably outspeed every common lead in the metagame, including Onix and Dwebble. Its ability Wimp Out allows it to usually get up one layer of Spikes and immediately give a teammate a safe switch. This can give your team a lot of momentum, and in combination with Spikes can put your opponent on the backfoot from the start of the game. However, Wimpod's stats other than its Speed are bad, meaning it will be knocked out easily and unable to do much damage in return. In addition, its movepool is very lacking, making it struggle to hit Pokemon that aren't weak to its STAB moves. This makes it incredibly passive. Wimpod's typing leaves it weak to Rock, not only meaning it is weak to Stealth Rock but also that it loses to common leads like Dwebble and Onix. At the same time, Wimpod faces a lot of competition from these Pokemon, as they have greater bulk and can set up entry hazards more consistently thanks to their less situational abilities, though Wimp Out does give Wimpod a small niche. However, Wimp Out can also be a curse, as a faster Pokemon can easily knock it below half HP, thus forcing it to switch out, meaning Wimpod cannot get up a layer of Spikes. Since it is unable to do much other than set up Spikes, Wimpod is very predictable, and opponents will thus easily be able to see its lead coming. Lastly, after it has been forced out because of Wimp Out, it struggles to get back in due to its weakness to Stealth Rock and general frailty.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Wimpod's movepool is incredibly limited, so it has very few other options. Leech Life and Waterfall can be used as slightly more powerful moves, but since Wimpod's offensive stats are so weak, the utility from Scald and Aqua Jet is generally preferred. Struggle Bug is an option to lower a foe's Special Attack and hit certain Grass-types like Snivy and Snover super effectively, but it is very weak and will actually raise Snivy's Special Attack due to its Contrary ability. Toxic can be used to cripple bulky switch-ins like Pumpkaboo-XL, but Wimpod usually prefers to set up Spikes and use Taunt against them. Berry Juice can be used to give Wimpod a chance to set up multiple layers of Spikes before being forced out by Wimp Out, though it leaves Wimpod open to OHKOs from many offensive threats such as Vullaby, Thunderbolt Staryu, and Abra.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Abra, Staryu, and Choice Scarf users can easily knock Wimpod below half HP, thus forcing it out due to Wimp Out, which means it is unable to set up a layer of Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Hazard Removal</strong>: Defog and Rapid Spin users like Vullaby and Staryu can easily undo all of Wimpod's work by removing its Spikes. Natu's ability Magic Bounce can also prevent Wimpod's Spikes from going up.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Spikes Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes is a good entry hazard that can significantly dent foes when they switch in, especially if multiple layers are set up. Taunt can prevent an opposing lead such as Onix or Dwebble from setting up their own hazards or a setup sweeper such as Shellder and Omanyte from setting up. Scald is Wimpod's main STAB move; it is used despite coming off of Wimpod's weaker Special Attack stat for its good chance to burn while still OHKOing Weak Armor Onix and 2HKOing Dwebble. However, it misses out on the 2HKO on Ponyta. Aqua Jet's priority is very useful for picking off very significantly weakened threats if Wimpod comes back into play later in the game.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Wimp Out is the main reason to use Wimpod, as it can give a teammate a safe switch in without forcing Wimpod to go down after it has done its job. Focus Sash allows Wimpod to nearly always survive at least one attack if it is at full HP, meaning it will usually be able to outspeed the foe, get up layer of Spikes, and then immediately activate Wimp Out. With maximum Speed investment and a Naive nature, Wimpod hits 18 Speed, allowing it to outspeed the majority of the metagame and, notably, other leads like Onix and Dwebble as well as other Taunt users like Mienfoo. With the Defense investment, Wimpod nearly always takes one Rock Blast from Onix and Dwebble if they only get two hits. In addition, it allows Wimpod to nearly always take any two hits from Timburr. 76 Attack EVs raise Attack by one point in order to increase Aqua Jet's damage on specific targets, most notably Eviolite Onix. The leftover EVs are put into Special Attack to raise it by one point. Even though these EVs could be moved to HP easily, as the Special Attack EVs don't change any notable damage rolls, this isn't done in order to make sure Wimpod can switch into Stealth Rock four times without going down. A Naive nature is used instead of a Jolly nature in order to secure the OHKO on Eviolite Onix with Scald.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Wimpod should almost always be used as a lead. However, if you predict your opponent to lead with a Pokemon that is faster than Wimpod, such as Abra, it is often advised to lead with something else so that Wimpod can be used to grab momentum later in the game. When it is in, setting up Spikes should be the main priority. However, when Wimpod is in on an opposing hazard setter, like Onix or Dwebble, or a setup sweeper, like Shellder or Zigzagoon, going for Taunt is usually worth it, as it can greatly aid your team by preventing these Pokemon from doing what they do best. Always be careful of multi-hit moves like Rock Blast, as they can KO Wimpod even through its Focus Sash. Once Wimpod has taken a hit and thus given a teammate a safe switch thanks to Wimp Out, it can come back in to give another safe switch by going down, use its good Speed to use Taunt on a setup sweeper, or set up another layer of Spikes. If Wimpod hasn't activated Wimp Out yet and is not on the field, it can be used to take a hit from Pokemon such as Timburr and grab momentum using Wimp Out. If Wimpod's Focus Sash hasn't been broken yet, it can do the same against any Pokemon. Since Wimpod is so weak, it's usually not worth it to go for an offensive move instead of Spikes or Taunt. You should only use an offensive move if you are either certain that it will knock out the foe or if you already have three layers of Spikes up and using Taunt is not worth it, such as when Wimpod's foe is an all-out attacker or it is already afflicted with Taunt.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wimpod should only ever be used on hyper offense teams, as these teams do not mind losing one Pokemon early on in the game. Other teams struggle to win when they only have 5 Pokemon, and since Wimpod will generally be significantly weakened or even KOed at the very start of the game, these situations are common on teams that utilize it. In addition, the powerful wallbreakers that are often found on these sorts of teams like Abra and Doduo appreciate a safe switch and thus pair very well with Wimpod, as they can not only take advantage of Wimp Out but also force a lot of switches, meaning they take full advantage of Wimpod's Spikes. Similarly, Sturdy users like Onix and Dwebble appreciate the free switches Wimpod can give them thanks to Wimp Out. Both can also set up Stealth Rock, which synergizes nicely with Wimpod's Spikes, and they appreciate that Wimpod usually prevents hazards from going up on its side of the field thanks to its very fast Taunt. Other offensive Stealth Rock setters like Pawniard can also stack hazards with Wimpod while not draining too much momentum for the hyper offense teams Wimpod finds itself on. Setup sweepers like Shellder and Nasty Plot Vullaby appreciate Wimpod providing them with a safe switch in thanks to Wimp Out. Spinblockers like Pumpkaboo-XL and Defog deterrents like Pawniard work well with Wimpod, as they prevent or scare foes out of removing Wimpod's Spikes. Rapid Spin users like Staryu and Drilbur can remove Stealth Rock, allowing Wimpod to come back into play much more easily. Defog users can also be used to accomplish this, but they are not recommended, as they also remove Wimpod's Spikes.</p>"

  "Sandygast": {
    "overview": "<p>Sandygast is a powerful special attacker with great physical bulk, allowing it to become an adequate sweeper under the right circumstances. These great stats combined with its offensive typing, which allows it to both spinblock and intercept Volt Switch while also giving it good neutral coverage, give it a significant niche. It also has a nice array of coverage moves. Sandygast is pretty sluggish even though it has Rock Polish to make up for its low Speed. One of Sandygast's major flaws is its low Special Defense which makes it weak to special attackers. Sandygast also lacks access to a useful ability, as it can only choose between Water Compaction and Sand Veil, both of which are mediocre abilities. Sandygast is outclassed by other Ground-type Pokemon such as Diglett and Mudbray in an offensive role because their good abilities and coverage give them more offensive presence; however, Sandygast is one of the strongest Ground-type special attackers. Sandygast may have a good offensive typing, but it is held back by its weakness to the commonly seen Knock Off and its low speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A defensive set utilizing Eviolite and Shore Up can be run along with more defensive EVs, but it is generally less effective than the main set. Ancient Power, Energy Ball, or Psychic can be used as additional coverage moves; however, Destiny Bond is usually more effective in bringing Pokemon down. Sandygast can be used as a secondary sand setter in sand teams due to its access to Sandstorm and Sand Veil, but it has difficulty finding a place for Sandstorm with its limited moveslots. Sandygast's low Speed enables it to function well on a Trick Room team, but it needs a lot of support to sweep efficiently. Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit Flying- and Grass-types, but it is rather weak and likely cannot land an OHKO unless the target has a quadruple weakness to Ice. Hidden Power Fire can also be used to hit Ferroseed, but has little utility otherwise.</p> <h3>Checks &amp; Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Since the majority of Flying-types are Normal / Flying, they are immune to Sandygast's STAB moves and can KO it without taking any damage. Vullaby is a good check to Sandygast, as it resists Shadow Ball and can either KO Sandygast with super effective Dark-type moves or use it as setup bait.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: The aforementioned Vullaby and Pawniard can easily deal with Sandygast as they outspeed Sandygast before it uses Rock Polish and OHKO it with Knock Off. After Sandygast uses Rock Polish, Dark-type Pokemon must watch out for Destiny Bond and Pawniard must also watch out for Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Although Sandygast has Water Compaction, the majority of Water-types in the metagame are special attackers that ignore the +2 Defense Sandygast gains and can proceed to KO it with super effective STAB Water-type moves. Carvanha can OHKO Sandygast with Waterfall and Aqua Jet and Corphish can use an Adaptability-boosted Crabhammer to OHKO Sandygast or use it as Dragon Dance bait. Chinchou can easily KO Sandygast but fears Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-type Pokemon resist Earth Power and are rarely OHKOed by Shadow Ball. Foongus is 3HKOed by the rare Psychic, but it can make quick work out of Sandygast with Giga Drain. Snivy outspeeds Sandygast and can easily OHKO it with Leaf Storm while Ferroseed walls all of Sandygast's moves except for the rare Hidden Power Fire and can OHKO it with Bullet Seed.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Snover is a good check to Sandygast as it doesn't take much damage from Earth Power and isn't OHKOed by Shadow Ball. Alolan Vulpix can 2HKO Sandygast and take an Earth Power or Shadow Ball while setting up Aurora Veil. Life Orb Adamant Alolan Sandshrew can OHKO Sandygast with three or more hits from Icicle Spear. Lastly, Choice Scarf Amaura outspeeds unboosted Sandygast and can always OHKO it with a Refrigerate-boosted Hyper Voice.</p> <p><strong>Fast Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf users with more than 15 Speed can outspeed a boosted Sandygast and revenge kill it. Choice Scarf Pawniard and Vullaby OHKO it with super effective Dark-type moves, while Choice Scarf Timid Chinchou can KO Sandygast but needs to be careful of Earth Power. Choice Scarf Gastly can OHKO Sandygast with Shadow Ball and is immune to Earth Power, but it can't reliably switch in.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Polish is Sandygast's main move, as it allows Sandygast to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame after a boost. Earth Power is one of Sandygast's STAB moves, hitting Steel-, Rock-, and Fire-types such as Magnemite, Onix, and Ponyta. Shadow Ball is Sandygast's other powerful STAB move, hitting Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Natu and Gastly for super effective damage. Destiny Bond can be used to take down Staryu and non-Choice Scarf Pawniard along with other Pokemon that would be a threat to Sandygast's team, although it is best used after Rock Polish has been used and Sandygast has been weakened to the point where it can be easily OHKOed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sandygast's EV spread along with a Modest nature allows it to hit as hard as possible with its two STAB moves and outspeed the entire unboosted metagame after it uses Rock Polish. The HP and Special Defense EVs allow Sandygast to almost always survive one Scald from Staryu. Berry Juice allows Sandygast to recover health so it can proceed to sweep with its powerful moves and Rock Polish; it also allows Sandygast to spinblock and take down Staryu efficiently. Water Compaction is the best choice out of Sandygast's two abilities, but it is a mediocre ability overall since Sandygast generally shouldn't switch into Water-type moves regardless of its ability.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Sandygast's main purpose is to spinblock and take down Staryu, which is one of the most powerful and effective spinners in LC. Sandygast's EV spread allows it to take a Scald from Staryu most of the time, recover its HP with Berry Juice, and set up with Rock Polish to outspeed Staryu. Sandygast can then proceed to use Destiny Bond and take Staryu down with it. This should only be done if maintaining entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field is important for your team. Sandygast has a nice niche in being able to spinblock common spinners such as Drilbur and Staryu while being able to prevent Volt Switch from Pokemon like Magnemite. After all Flying- and Dark-type Pokemon have been eliminated, Sandygast can proceed to spam its STAB moves after it sets up; however, it still needs to beware of its remaining checks. In addition to beating Staryu, Sandygast can use Destiny Bond to take down other threatening Pokemon such as non-Choice Scarf Pawniard, but it needs to set up with Rock Polish to effectively utilize Destiny Bond. Slow VoltTurn support allows Sandygast to set up more easily because Sandygast struggles to take hits as a result of its low bulk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to its low bulk and its requirement to set up before being useful, Sandygast needs a lot of support from its teammates. Pokemon that resist Dark-type moves such as Pawniard and Vullaby make good teammates. Fighting-type Pokemon or priority users such as Timburr and Croagunk can deal with Pawniard and Fairy-type Pokemon such as Snubbull can deal with Vullaby. Onix, Chinchou, Magnemite, and Alolan Sandshrew make good teammates because they can take down the Normal / Flying types that wall Sandygast; Magnemite in particular appreciates Sandygast's ability to switch into Fighting-type moves while the former can tank most moves aimed at Sandygast, giving them good defensive synergy. Flying-types such as Rufflet and Vullaby are also good teammates because they can deal with Grass-type Pokemon such as Snivy and Cottonee that check Sandygast. Furthermore, Sandygast can take out most Rock-, Steel-, and Electric-types that trouble most Flying-types with Earth Power. Although they don't provide much defensive synergy, Fire-type Pokemon such as Ponyta and Larvesta can also deal with Grass-, Steel-, and Ice-types such as Snivy, Pawniard, and Alolan Sandshrew. Entry hazards allow Sandygast to sweep more easily as they break Sturdy and Focus Sash. Rock-type Pokemon such as Onix and Archen can help take care of Flying-types for Sandygast and can also set entry hazards to aid Sandygast's sweeping capabilities. In return, Sandygast can spinblock and take care of most Steel-types and spinners. Slow U-turn and Volt Switch users such as non-Choice Scarf Chinchou and Larvesta can help bring Sandygast safely.</p>"

  "Jangmo-o": {
    "overview": "<p>Jangmo-o's access to Dragon Dance allows it to function as a late-game sweeper and cleaner on offensive teams. Its ability Bulletproof lets it check some Gastly and Croagunk variants and set up with Dragon Dance. Furthermore, Jangmo-o's useful resistances to Fire, Water, Grass, and Electric can help it find setup opportunities at times. However, it faces serious competition from other Dragon Dance cleaners such as Axew and Dratini; the former has better stats, and the latter has access to Extreme Speed to aid it in cleaning. Also, Jangmo-o finds it difficult to set up, as it's frail, weak, and slow, and consequently heavily reliant on team support. Finally, it struggles with Fairy-types such as Snubbull and Spritzee due to lack of super effective coverage to hit them with.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Swords Dance set is an option for more power but isn't preferable due to the loss of Speed and Jangmo-o's susceptibility to being revenge killed. Choice Scarf Jangmo-o is plausible but outclassed by many other Choice Scarf users such as Axew, as it has less power and coverage. Aerial Ace can be used instead of other coverage moves to deal with Pokemon like Cottonee and Morelull, which resist Jangmo-o's attacks entirely. However, its low power and limited coverage mean it isn't worth a moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Spritzee and Snubbull are usually capable of taking all of Jangmo-o's attacks due to their immunity to Dragon and resistance to its coverage moves, and they can OHKO it with super effective STAB attacks in return. Cottonee, in particular, resists both Earthquake and Brick Break and can lock Jangmo-o into Dragon Dance with Prankster Encore.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: The majority of Steel-types can take a hit from Jangmo-o and cripple it with an attacking or status move. Magnemite, Alolan Sandshrew, and Ferroseed, for example, wall Jangmo-o, but they all fear either Earthquake or Brick Break.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Jangmo-o's average Speed leaves it easily revenge killed by faster Pokemon like Abra and Vullaby and Choice Scarf users like Axew. Priority moves like Ice Shard from Snover can easily take down Jangmo-o, as it is very frail and worn down quickly.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls put a halt to Jangmo-o, especially if they have access to reliable recovery. Pokemon like Mudbray and Hippopotas can take its attacks comfortably.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status moves are Jangmo-o's downfall, as it can only avoid them if running Substitute, and due to its average Speed, some status users like Cottonee can outspeed and paralyze or put Jangmo-o to sleep. However, with Overcoat, it is immune to certain status moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance allows Jangmo-o to boost its Attack and Speed, helping it sweep. Outrage is used to clean when foes are weakened; a boosted Outrage 2HKOes top-tier threats like Timburr, Vullaby, and Mienfoo. However, it is not optimal to be locked into, as the opponent can exploit this and switch in a Dragon-resistant or -immune Pokemon to set up on Jangmo-o. Alternatively, Dragon Claw can be used if you do not wish to be locked into a move, though the power difference is noticeable. Earthquake allows Jangmo-o to hit Fairy-types neutrally while hitting relevant Steel-types like Alolan Sandshrew and Magnemite, which resist Jangmo-o's STAB attacks. Brick Break hits Ferroseed super effectively and guarantees an OHKO on Pawniard. However, Substitute allows Jangmo-o to set up safely by shielding it from moves like Spore and Will-O-Wisp from Pokemon like Foongus and Pumpkaboo-XL, respectively, which would otherwise cripple it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>236 Speed EVs allow Jangmo-o to hit 14 Speed, outspeeding the entire unboosted metagame after a boost. 236 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature allow Jangmo-o to reach 15 Attack, thus making it hit as hard as possible. Berry Juice is the ideal item for Jangmo-o to regain health, support its sweep better, and also heal back Substitute damage. Bulletproof allows Jangmo-o to set up on and check Gastly and Croagunk; alternatively, Overcoat allows it to dodge Foongus's Spore and any other powder move.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Jangmo-o should be sent out when Fairy-types like Snubbull and Spritzee and Steel-types are weakened, as well as when bulky foes are down or have their items Knocked Off. Don't lock Jangmo-o into Outrage until Fairy- and Steel-types are eliminated. Come in on bulky status inducers, create a Substitute, and then set up, as they can hinder Jangmo-o's sweep. Setup opportunities for Jangmo-o are limited, so create a Substitute on forced switches, such as Croagunk and Magnemite locked into Flash Cannon. Jangmo-o can set up or create a Substitute on Pokemon like Gastly and Foongus, as it resists their STAB moves, and Jangmo-o can use Substitute on a predicted Spore from the latter. Jangmo-o mustn't attempt to set up on faster, powerful Pokemon, such as Doduo, Abra, and Mienfoo, as it will usually be KOed due to its poor defenses.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Jangmo-o fits well on bulky offensive teams, as it appreciates foes being weakened for a sweep. Steel-types are great partners for Jangmo-o, as they can take on Fairy- and Ice-types that Jangmo-o is weak to. Pawniard, for example, can punch holes in the opposing team for Jangmo-o with Swords Dance and Knock Off. Poison-types like Gastly and Foongus in general are effective at removing Fairy-types. Bulky pivots like Vullaby and Chinchou work well with Jangmo-o, bringing it in for free. Wallbreakers like Corphish can punch holes for Jangmo-o and allow it to sweep more easily late-game. Jangmo-o hates being worn down by entry hazards, as its only form of recovery is Berry Juice, so Pokemon like Staryu and Vullaby make for good partners. On the other hand, Jangmo-o loves entry hazards on the opposing side to wear down the opposition, so Onix, Dwebble, and Omanyte make for great partners. Knock Off users, such as Pawniard, Vullaby, and Mienfoo, can help to remove opposing Eviolites and help Jangmo-o break past foes more easily. Diglett traps the Steel-types that prevent Jangmo-o from spamming Outrage.</p>"
