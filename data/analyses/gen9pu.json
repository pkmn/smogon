        "description": "<p>Alolan Sandslash is a great role compressor, as it can remove entry hazards and set up its own, and on top of this, it can also check threats like Meloetta, Florges, and Rotom-C. While Triple Axel is more powerful than Ice Spinner, it must land all three times to do so, making the latter a more accurate alternative. Ice Spinner also removes Terrain, meaning it can also help out in more fringe cases versus Terrain setters like Indeedee-F and Thwackey to prevent Terrain sweepers such as Sceptile and Hitmonlee from gaining a Speed boost. Knock Off allows Alolan Sandslash to remove items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Choice Scarf from Pokemon like Altaria, Milotic, Paldean Tauros-F, and Flamigo. Removing Heavy-Duty Boots allows it to take advantage of its entry hazards to chip away at the aforementioned walls so that teammates like Paldean Tauros-W and Delphox can break through them. Spikes is preferred, as they can be stacked, and there are many more Stealth Rock users in PU compared to the number of Pokemon that learn Spikes. However, if there are no Stealth Rock users on a team or if Spikes are covered somewhere else, Stealth Rock can be run instead. Leftovers provides passive recovery for Alolan Sandslash, as it lacks any form of it, but Heavy-Duty Boots makes it be a more reliable spinner. The Speed investment helps Alolan Sandslash outpace Sandaconda. 20 Attack EVs allow Alolan Sandslash to always OHKO Golurk from full health if all three Triple Axel hits land. Tera Water both lets Alolan Sandslash take a Fire-type attack from Delphox, Salazzle, and Arcanine in a pinch and gives it a strong defensive Tera type. Tera Ghost, on the other hand, helps Alolan Sandslash act as an emergency spinblocker against Tatsugiri, Coalossal, and opposing Alolan Sandslash while also helping it take super effective coverage in Body Press from Mudsdale and Bronzong and Close Combat from Scyther.</p> <p>Although Alolan Sandslash easily fits on a lot of teams thanks to its good general utility, it fits best on entry hazard stacking teams that can utilize Spikes to great use alongside offensive pressure to chip away at and break through walls. This means wallbreaking partners like Zoroark, Heracross, and Delphox greatly appreciate Alolan Sandslash's support. Alolan Sandslash is easily beat by Fighting- and Fire-types like Hariyama, Paldean Tauros-F, and Arcanine, so teammates that can check these threats like Bellibolt, Milotic, and Mudsdale make for great partners and create a strong defensive backbone with Alolan Sandslash. Other Knock Off users like Heracross, Ambipom, and Scrafty pair well alongside Alolan Sandslash, as it can then fully utilize its hazards. Alolan Sandslash's lack of recovery can be quite detrimental versus Galarian Articuno and Florges, so a second specially defensive wall, like Goodra or Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro, or a Wish-passing partner, such as Scream Tail or Florges, makes for a great teammate. Alolan Sandslash struggles against Steel-types like Bronzong, Duraludon, and opposing Alolan Sandslash, so Pokemon like Skuntank, Flamigo, and Paldean Tauros-F can all pressure them so that they can't take advantage of Alolan Sandslash. Wallbreakers weak to Stealth Rock and walls worn down by Spikes that also prefer to run other items instead like Staraptor, Arcanine, Gastrodon, and Galarian Slowbro have strong synergy with Alolan Sandslash because it can remove entry hazards for them. The former two pair especially well, as Alolan Sandslash can chip away at their checks like Mudsdale and Milotic with Knock Off and entry hazards. In return, Staraptor and Arcanine threaten out Fighting- and Fire-types like Flamigo and Delphox, respectively.</p>"

Curse boosts Arcanine's physical stats, making it a stronger threat and a bulkier attacker while also naturally synergizing with Extreme Speed and Intimidate. Morning Sun provides recovery, allowing Arcanine to alleviate its Stealth Rock weakness and recover against more passive walls like Altaria and Wo-Chien. An alternative to Morning Sun is Close Combat, which prevents Arcanine from being walled by Coalossal and does more damage to Water-types than Extreme Speed before Terastallization; however, it severely cuts into Arcanine's longevity. Leftovers aids with Flare Blitz recoil, although it does leave Arcanine extremely weak to entry hazards. Heavy-Duty Boots is another viable option to make it completely immune to Stealth Rock and other entry hazards, although it does come at the cost of Arcanine solely relying on Morning Sun to recover off damage. The given EV spread allows Arcanine to outspeed Modest Toxtricity before a Curse. Tera Normal removes all of Arcanine's weaknesses, allowing it to set up on Pokemon like Decidueye and non-Clear Smog Gastrodon while also boosting Extreme Speed, enabling it to pick off faster attackers like Kilowattrel and Staraptor after a Curse.</p> <p>Arcanine fits on a variety of teams but most commonly finds itself on hyper offense and balance teams looking for a powerful sweeper and setup threat. Arcanine struggles to deal with bulky physically defensive walls that can cripple it with status or phaze it like Bellibolt, Mudsdale, and Galarian Slowbro, so checks to these Pokemon like Golurk and Tatsugiri make excellent partners. Other physical attackers like Decidueye and Flamigo also make great partners, as they work together with Arcanine to chip away at their shared checks like Bellibolt and Houndstone. If Arcanine is using Leftovers as its item, entry hazard control from Pokemon like Tastugiri, Scyther, and Altaria can help alleviate Arcanine's Stealth Rock weakness to make it a more potent sweeper. As Arcanine struggles to set up against special attackers like Toxtricity and Scream Tail, special walls like Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro and Milotic can provide a defensive backbone for Arcanine to fall back on.</p>"

U-turn allows Scyther to pivot out of bad matchups such as Bronzong and Houndstone, can bring a teammate onto the field safely, and can let Scyther gain momentum for its team. In contrast, Close Combat is a valuable coverage move to target Rock- and Steel-types like Coalossal, Regirock, and Alolan Sandslash. Trailblaze allows Scyther to operate as a dual setup sweeper, making it a bigger offensive threat by outspeeding faster Pokemon such as Salazzle and Choice Scarf Paldean Tauros-F. Finally, Quick Attack is a valuable priority move, letting Scyther pick off setup sweepers such as Shift Gear Toxtricity and Nasty Plot Salazzle. Scyther's Tera type is extremely flexible; Tera Grass should be paired with Trailblaze, as it boosts the move while also giving it a useful defensive typing to set up on threats like Rotom-M and Paldean Tauros-W. Tera Normal lacks defensive advantages but boosts Quick Attack to great levels of power after a Swords Dance, achieving rolls such as a chance to OHKO Salazzle and Staraptor after Stealth Rock. Finally, Tera Ground is a purely defensive Tera Type type that allows Scyther to get setup opportunities against Pokemon it usually would not like Bellibolt, Toxtricity, Delphox, and Galarian Slowbro.</p> <p>Scyther finds itself primarily on hyper offense and balance teams looking for a consistent setup sweeper. Scyther struggles to break though physical walls like Bellibolt, Bronzong, and Coalossal if it does not run Close Combat, so checks to these threats like Golurk and Tatsugiri make excellent partners. Other offensive pivots like Staraptor and Rotom-H make a powerful VoltTurn core with Scyther, which can be difficult to stop and can bring Scyther in to safely set up. Scyther's ability to pivot can also be helpful for other frailer setup sweepers, like Decidueye and Zoroark, to get in safely and attempt a sweep of their own. If Scyther does not opt for Trailblaze or Quick Attack, it is extremely susceptible to getting revenge killed by Choice Scarf Flamigo and Staraptor as well as naturally faster Pokemon like Tornadus and Ambipom; checks to these threats like Bellibolt, Dudunsparce, and Duraludon make excellent partners.

U-turn allows it to gain momentum for its team, rack up chip damage on the likes of Galarian Slowbro and Gastrodon, and pivot out of Pokemon that it has issues with, like Bronzong. Close Combat lets Scyther deal with entry hazard setters like Alolan Sandslash and Coalossal while also providing good coverage into Pokemon like Dudunsparce and Abomasnow. Defog allows it to capitalize on the Pokemon it forces out like Wo-Chien and Paldean Tauros-W and subsequently remove entry hazards. Scyther has a variety of viable Tera types; most commonly, it runs Tera Ground, as it is an excellent defensive Tera type that lets it take on Pokemon like Kilowattrel, Rotom-H, Toxtricity, and Coalossal while also blocking Volt Switch. An alternative to this is Tera Flying, boosting the power of Dual Wingbeat while still removing Scyther's Bug typing to take on Fire-types like Delphox and Arcanine. Finally, Tera Fighting boosts the power of Close Combat while giving Scyther a decent defensive Tera type, helping it handle Dark-types like Skuntank and Zoroark and changing its Rock weakness to a resistance.</p> <p>Scyther most commonly finds itself on bulkier balance teams looking to compress multiple roles into one Pokemon. Scyther makes an excellent VoltTurn core with Pokemon like Rotom-H and Zoroark, which can threaten physical walls such as Altaria, Bronzong, and Galarian Slowbro that can make Scyther's job difficult. As Scyther threatens Decidueye, Florges, and Wo-Chien, Pokemon checked by these threats, like Paldean Tauros-W and Toxtricity, can make good partners with it, and Scyther can help them get on the battlefield with U-turn and Defog. Scyther makes a good defensive backbone with Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro and Houndstone thanks to its ability to counter their few checks like Skuntank and Decidueye. In turn, they operate as a fallback for Scyther after it pivots out with U-turn against its problematic matchups. Coalossal and Bellibolt are issues for Scyther, as it can't reliably pivot on them due to Flame Body and Static, so checks to these threats like Golurk, Goodra, and Mudsdale are good partners.</p>"

Future Sight is used over other Psychic-type attacks like Freezing Glare and Psyshock, as it synergizes well with U-turn and can make playing against Galarian Articuno difficult even when it's off the battlefield.

Other wallbreakers like Paldean Tauros-F, Golurk, and Goodra appreciate Galarian Articuno's ability to deter their checks like Milotic and Galarian Slowbro from switching in thanks to Future Sight and the fact that it can pivot them in.

Pain Split is Qwilfish's primary form of recovery and is a great utility move, as Pokemon that switch into it, like Galarian Slowbro and Gastrodon, can't passively recover without allowing Qwilfish to do so as well. Taunt gives Qwilfish the ability to prevent opposing entry hazard setters, like Coalossal and Gastrodon, from establishing their own hazards and stops slower setup sweepers like Scrafty and Galarian Slowbro from taking advantage of it. Thunder Wave can be used to hinder setup sweepers like Decidueye and Scyther. Toxic guarantees a poison on a Pokemon like Mudsdale and Gastrodon and doubles the damage of Barb Barrage. Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers, pivot attempts from the likes of Ambipom, Bombirdier, and Paldean Tauros-W, and Rapid Spin users like Alolan Sandslash and Tatsugiri. 16 Speed EVs allows Qwilfish to outpace Adamant Golurk. Tera Ground gives Qwilfish a key immunity to Electric, helping against Bellibolt, Kilowattrel, and Rotom-H Volt Switch cores. Tera Ground does allow Paldean Tauros-W to break through it easier, however, and limits the overall defensive utility provided by the natural Water / Poison typing. Tera Ghost provides a valuable immunity to Rapid Spin, enabling hazard stacking structures further.</p> <p>Qwilfish is a valuable asset for balance and bulky offense teams looking for an entry hazard setter and temporary defensive answer to many of the physical sweepers in the metagame. Spikes Qwilfish partners well with many Stealth Rock setters, like Coalossal, Gligar, and Palossand, as Qwilfish appreciates a sturdy teammate that can take Electric- and Ground-type attacks for it so it can stack Spikes more freely. Hazard stacking relies on Knock Off users to remove Heavy-Duty Boots, which makes Bombirdier, Gligar, and Wo-Chien notable teammates; not only are they good Knock Off absorbers, they also resist or are immune to Ground. Bombirdier and Wo-Chien are reliable defensive pivots into Decidueye as well, providing great coverage for most of the top threats in the metagame. Qwilfish is a great defensive presence, as it does well into some of the best physical attackers in the metagame, like Arcanine and Paldean Tauros-W, which opens up the rest of the team significantly. Offensive teammates like Scrafty, Toxtricity, and Zoroark can be potent late-game cleaners after Qwilfish wears down physical wallbreakers. Mid-game wallbreakers like Decidueye and Golurk, which also function as spinblockers, appreciate Qwilfish for giving them a reliable defensive answer to their checks, notably Paldean Tauros-F and Paldean Tauros-W, respectively, and safe entry points provided by Flip Turn. Tatsugiri is a difficult matchup for Qwilfish teams, as it threatens strong STAB attacks, often getting an opportunity to spin as Qwilfish is forced out. Teammates that can match up well into Tatsugiri, like Florges and Scream Tail, can mitigate the relatively safe entry it has against Qwilfish.</p>"

Brave Bird allows Altaria to not be completely passive and helpless against Taunt from Pokemon like Bombirdier and Skuntank while also doing more damage than Hurricane against specially defensive Pokemon like Florges and Delphox. Altaria's choice of its final move is flexible; Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers Altaria switches into like Paldean Tauros-W, Scrafty, and Decidueye. Haze allows Altaria to prevent setup sweepers like Nasty Plot Delphox and Zoroark as well as Curse Arcanine from using it as setup fodder, while Roar does the same but also functions better against Substitute users such as Scream Tail, although it can be counterintuitive with Defog due to not being able to accrue chip damage from hazards that Defog removes. The given EV spread allows Altaria to outspeed Golurk and Adamant Emboar while still providing as much bulk as possible, although a spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD can be used to be bulkier if outspeeding these two is not needed. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 120 SpD / 136 Spe can allow Altaria to become a better special wall, checking Pokemon like Kilowattrel and Meloetta better. Tera Steel flips all of Altaria's weaknesses, allowing it to more safely threaten Pokemon like Alolan Sandslash, Florges, and Scream Tail, although Terastallizing does make it unable to check Fighting- and Fire-types like Flamigo and Delphox as well as removing Altaria's Ground immunity, making the matchup against hazard setters like Gligar and Mudsdale harder.</p> <p>Due to its relative passivity, Altaria fits mostly on bulky balance teams needing a Defogger that can also compress multiple roles. Altaria's ability to absorb status moves like Toxic and Thunder Wave is appreciated by other walls like Wo-Chien and Gastrodon as well as setup sweepers like Delphox and Virizion. In turn, Pokemon like Wo-Chien and Virizion can be reliable Knock Off absorbers for Altaria, so it does not lose its Heavy-Duty Boots. Altaria finds itself extremely susceptible to Ice- and Fairy-types like Alolan Sandslash, Froslass, and Florges as well as coverage moves like Triple Axel from Ambipom; checks to these threats like Bronzong, Skuntank, and Rotom-H thus make excellent partners. Specially defensive walls like Bronzong, Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro, and Florges create a defensive backbone with Altaria. Altaria's ability to check and burn physical attackers like Paldean Tauros-W, Zoroark, and Flamigo allows Pokemon that are checked by these threats like Arcanine and Houndstone become more potent attackers. Altaria's ability to remove entry hazards allows Pokemon particularly weak to them like Choice Scarf Staraptor, Arcanine, and Galarian Slowbro to become bigger threats.</p>"

Clear Smog, however, works best on bulkier teams, as it both stops Gastrodon from being setup fodder and lets it check setup sweepers that these teams struggle with such as Bulk Up Scrafty, Calm Mind Florges, and Curse Arcanine. Surf targets Rotom-H, which Gastrodon walls but has issues with taking out, gives it a useful secondary STAB move and hits Flying-types neutrally. Gastrodon usually runs Stealth Rock is usually ran, but if a team already has a Stealth Rock user like Bronzong, Bombirdier, or Coalossal, Spikes could be used instead so it can help out its team entry hazard-wise no matter what. Leftovers prevents Gastrodon from having to heal as often, while Heavy-Duty Boots alleviates pressure from entry hazards during switches. Storm Drain allows Gastrodon to wall Water-type wallbreakers like Tatsugiri and also stop Qwilfish from pivoting with Flip Turn. Sticky Hold can be used on more defensive teams that require a Knock Off switch-in. Tera Poison helps Gastrodon check Fighting-types like Paldean Tauros-W, Hariyama, and Heracross while also turning its 4x weakness to Grass-type attacks into a resistance, letting it take hits from Rotom-C and Decidueye in a pinch. Tera Fairy also helps Gastrodon versus the aforementioned Fighting-types, gifting it a more well-rounded defensive typing that allows it to check Scrafty, Zoroark, and Scyther better.</p> <p>While Gastrodon is a strong specially defensive wall, its Defense is lacking. In order to patch up this issue, Gastrodon pairs well with Bellibolt, Galarian Slowbro, and Altaria, as they can handle Staraptor, Flamigo, Paldean Tauros-W, and Hariyama more reliably. Gastrodon consistently checks Fire-, Poison-, and Steel-type Pokemon like Rotom-H, Skuntank, and Duraludon, so Pokemon that can benefit from this like Rotom-C, Flamigo, and Choice Specs Florges make for great teammates. Grass-types like Hisuian Electrode, Decidueye, and Rotom-C easily threaten Gastrodon; therefore, it should have partners like Arcanine, Paldean Tauros-F, and Rotom-H that can scare out these foes. In turn, Gastrodon handles threatening Water-types like Tatsugiri and Kingdra amazingly. With entry hazard support from Gastrodon, wallbreakers like Toxtricity, Zoroark, and Emboar break through their checks like Bronzong, Wo-Chien, and Milotic more effectively. Gastrodon also tends to drain momentum, so to circumvent this, partners like Rotom-H, Scyther, and Flamigo can check common switch-ins to Gastrodon like Rotom-C and Wo-Chien and also pivot to regain momentum.</p>"

Opposing sweepers, other revenge killers, and fast pivots such as Shift Gear Toxtricity, Choice Scarf Staraptor, and Kilowattrel, whose Speed tiers make them otherwise hard to deal with, can be picked off or forced out by using Fake Out. U-turn allows Ambipom to escape after dealing Fake Out chip or maintain pressure on an anticipated switch. Knock Off serves as coverage for Ghost-types such as Decidueye and Golurk while also making progress by removing key items like Heavy-Duty Boots from users such as Bombirdier and Eviolite from foes such as Hisuian Qwilfish. Triple Axel provides Technician-boosted coverage for potential switch-ins, being most effective against Gligar and Altaria. Alternatively, Double-Edge provides a more accurate and STAB-boosted option that has a chance to OHKO frailer offensive Pokemon—Tatsugiri and Salazzle being two examples. Double Hit is another STAB-boosted option that trades accuracy and some power for longevity, especially when paired with Protective Pads. Because of its frequent pivoting, Ambipom often uses Heavy-Duty Boots for greater longevity throughout games, avoiding chip damage from entry hazards. Protective Pads guards Ambipom from contact effects like Flame Body burns and Rocky Helmet chip damage, which are most inhibiting to sets with Triple Axel and Double Hit. Silk Scarf and Tera Normal achieve a similar effect for Ambipom, improving key Fake Out rolls in a pinch by consistently 2HKOing Kilowattrel and Salazzle, whose high Speed can mandate trading Pokemon for Fake Out hits. Tera Normal or Silk Scarf Double-Edge and Double Hit also have respectable damage outputs, OHKOing Tatsugiri and Zoroark. When used together, Ambipom gains legitimate wallbreaking potential: Tera Normal Silk Scarf Double-Edge has a favorable roll to 2HKO Galarian Slowbro and Bellibolt, the two best physical walls in the tier.</p> <p>Ambipom is well suited for bulky or fast offense and balance teams susceptible to fast threats and opposing setup. Sweepers such as Dragon Dance Scrafty and Calm Mind Scream Tail that have fewer chances to set up may be picked off by speed control or trade damage with bulkier Pokemon like Goodra and Meloetta. Thus, Ambipom's ability to apply pressure after they faint and prevent counter sweeps is a helpful addition. Entry hazard users like Gastrodon and Gligar also synergize with Ambipom, taking advantage of Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots to wear down susceptible foes—removal options like Alolan Sandslash and Defog Scyther rely on Heavy-Duty Boots to switch in several times. Hazards also allow Ambipom to wear down teams by repeated switching and enable Silk Scarf sets to break through chipped switch-ins like Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro, which it 2HKOes with Stealth Rock up. Unfortunately, without Protective Pads, Ambipom is very susceptible to contact abilities like Static and Flame Body, and it struggles to break common physical walls like Bellibolt and defensive Galarian Slowbro that it cannot consistently 2HKO after Terastallizing without Silk Scarf. As such, it benefits from wallbreakers such as Toxtricity and Golurk that clear through these checks. Ambipom also appreciates bulky teammates with recovery such as Milotic and Florges, allowing a safe switch in after using U-turn. Finally, variants of Ambipom not using Heavy-Duty Boots are easily worn down by opposing hazards and appreciate removal from teammates like Coalossal and Altaria, which in turn appreciate Ambipon providing more opportunities for them to be brought in on favorable matchups and remove hazards or make progress with other utility moves.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Skuntank's unique typing, ability in Aftermath, and movepool tailored for both stallbreaking and revenge killing establish it as a solid glue Pokemon in the metagame for a variety of team structures. Its typing allows it to check a variety of threats, such as Galarian Slowbro and Decidueye, which creates reliable opportunities to debuff walls like Mudsdale, Gligar, and Bellibolt on the switch, as not much in the metagame can resist its STAB combination of Gunk Shot and Knock Off. Sucker Punch is able to pick off weakened offensive threats such as Delphox and Toxtricity as well as Choice Scarf users like Staraptor and Rotom-C. Taunt is useful to stop the likes of Bellibolt and Milotic from healing freely and also inhibits setup sweepers such as Scrafty. Toxic can be used instead to cripple and wear down switch-ins like Mudsdale and Gastrodon. Rocky Helmet is useful to punish opposing Knock Off users like Scrafty, Bombirdier, and other Skuntank, as Skuntank is often the designated Knock Off absorber for many teams. Rocky Helmet also synergizes well with Aftermath to allow Skuntank to trade with contact-attacking threats like Arcanine and Paldean-Tauros W as needed. The boost from Black Glasses works exceptionally well with an Adamant nature and Tera Dark, as Skuntank can break through walls like Gastrodon and Altaria with these boosts stacked while also notably giving Adamant variants a guaranteed chance to OHKO Delphox from full with Sucker Punch. Some teams may opt for Heavy-Duty Boots, as it can be used to more reliably handle Decidueye for teams that need that support, avoiding the 3HKO from Spirit Shackle after Stealth Rock chip damage. A Jolly nature is useful to outspeed the likes of Goodra, Tatsugiri, and Jolly Bombirdier, while an Adamant nature can be used for additional power, for example, guaranteeing an OHKO against Golurk with Knock Off even without Black Glasses. Tera Ghost can be used over Tera Dark for its defensive merits versus certain Hyper Offensive sweepers; for example, Skuntank becomes immune to Boomburst from Toxtricity and Scream Tail as well as Curse Arcanine's Extreme Speed in a pinch and can then fire back with Gunk Shot or Knock Off.</p> <p>Skuntank functions well on entry hazard-stacking archetypes thanks to its ability to lure in and remove Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Bellibolt, Arcanine, and Milotic. Spikes setters such as Gastrodon and Coalossal are able to wear down offensive threats like Tatsugiri and Salazzle into range of Skuntank's Sucker Punch as well. Additionally, Skuntank is a valuable asset for hyper offense teams, providing role compression by being able to defensively check problematic threats like Decidueye while also supporting setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Scream Tail, Curse Arcanine, and Bulk Up Paldean Tauros-W by wearing down shared checks such as Coalossal, Mudsdale, and Milotic with Toxic and Knock Off support. These offensive threats also appreciate Skuntank's ability to pivot into one of their best answers, Galarian Slowbro, fairly reliably. Decidueye is another great partner with solid synergy, appreciating Skuntank's ability to take on checks like Scrafty and Wo-Chien and even wear down opposing Skuntank while Decidueye directly takes on Mudsdale, Gastrodon, and Paldean Tauros-W. Offensive Water-types such as Tatsugiri and Paldean Tauros-W appreciate Skuntank's ability to pressure Grass-types like Wo-Chien and Decidueye, while in return, they can switch into Ground-types like Mudsdale and Gligar immediately after Skuntank has crippled them with Knock Off. Skuntank's ability to offensively check the likes of Delphox, Decidueye, and Staraptor can also be beneficial for defensive pieces such as Wo-Chien and Bellibolt to not become overwhelmed, which can allow them to return the favor by better handling threats to Skuntank such as Mudsdale and Flamigo, respectively.</p>"

Ice Beam is Froslass's preferred STAB move for its power, but Icy Wind could be run instead to slow down foes like Salazzle and Choice Scarf Meloetta for its teammates. Taunt stops Pokemon like Coalossal and Gastrodon from setting up their entry hazards on Froslass as well as Pokemon such as Bronzong from using it as setup fodder. On the other hand, Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers like Paldean Tauros-W and messes with Sucker Punch users such as Skuntank and Bombirdier. Destiny Bond lets Froslass get either a KO or an extra turn to set up another layer of Spikes unharmed due to its threat. Thunder Wave can be used over Taunt or Will-O-Wisp so that Froslass can cripple special attackers like Delphox and Florges better, but its matchups into the aforementioned Sucker Punch users worsen a bit. Avalanche could also be run as Froslass's STAB move because its negative priority means Destiny Bond might get a surprise KO on a foe, but it misses out on the power of Ice Beam and the utility of Icy Wind, and it can be played around easily once revealed. Since Froslass's goal is to set up hazards and then provide an entry point for its partners when it faints, its Tera types are for the niche situations in which it has difficulty achieving this, and therefore, Froslass should be Terastallized sparingly. Tera Fairy gives Froslass a strong defensive typing that provides a Dark resistance, helping it against Sucker Punch Bombirdier and Skuntank. Alternatively, Tera Dark gifts Froslass a Dark resistance as well alongside a Ghost resistance, which helps it versus Decidueye and Golurk, and it blocks status moves like Encore and Taunt from Prankster users such as Sableye and Grimmsnarl. However, Froslass gains a Fighting weakness.</p> <p>Froslass works exclusively as a dedicated lead on hyper offensive teams, which enjoy Spikes weakening checks. As Froslass's Spikes can be easily removed after it's KOed, a Defog deterrent like Competitive Kilowattrel, Pokemon such as Toxtricity and Skuntank that threaten out Defoggers, and spinblockers like Oricorio-G and Tera Ghost Salazzle are vital partners to help keep up pressure. Pokemon like Arcanine, Salazzle, and Minior, which prefer to run other items like Leftovers, Focus Sash, and White Herb instead of Heavy-Duty Boots, appreciate Froslass's ability to deny opposing hazards from being set up. Teammates like Bulk Up Paldean Tauros-W and -F, both Nasty Plot and Swords Dance Zoroark, and Throat Spray Toxtricity all benefit greatly from their checks like Gastrodon, Wo-Chien, and Golurk being whittled into range of a 2HKO or OHKO. Fighting-type teammates like Paldean Tauros-W and Scrafty that can take advantage of common switch-ins to Froslass such as Coalossal and Dark-types like Skuntank and Zoroark are greatly appreciated, as Froslass fails to effectively threaten the latter two otherwise, barring status conditions from moves like Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Rotom-H is a solid wallbreaker that offers a lot of utility, both offensively and defensively, in comparison to stronger special attackers like Delphox and bulkier pivots like Bellibolt. With its typing, bulk, and access to Levitate, Rotom-H can easily switch into walls like Mudsdale and Bronzong as well as offensive threats like Arcanine and either set up on them or pivot with Volt Switch. Pain Split makes Rotom-H more adept at dismantling defensive teams, simultaneously keeping it healthy and helping it overwhelm special walls like Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro and Florges. The move is an inconsistent source of recovery, though, so Rotom-H shouldn't rely on it too heavily. Investing in HP maximizes the mileage Rotom-H gets from its defensive profile and also gives it an easier time setting up and sticking around. Overheat's high Base Power means that it hits hard even without Special Attack investment. Thunderbolt and Discharge are alternatives to Volt Switch that are better suited for wallbreaking, don't force Rotom-H to switch out, and can paralyze foes, but pivoting with Volt Switch is a huge part of Rotom-H's viability. Tera Steel makes Rotom-H immune to poison, letting it set up on Toxic users like Bellibolt and Gligar, and resist Stealth Rock in case it loses its Heavy-Duty Boots. It also helps Rotom-H stomach Normal-, Psychic-, and Dragon-type attacks from the likes of Toxtricity, Meloetta, and Duraludon while keeping most of its natural resistances. Tera Poison maintains the Toxic immunity in addition to flipping the script on Fighting-types like Paldean Tauros-F and Pawmot. Both options synergize well with Levitate, though Tera Poison leaves Rotom-H open to Psychic-type moves from the likes of Galarian Slowbro and Calm Mind Florges.</p> <p>Rotom-H shines on bulky offense and balance teams, which best leverage its unique blend of offense and defense and benefit from it breaking through opposing bulky builds early- or mid-game. Gastrodon is nearly impossible for Rotom-H to break on its own and must be accounted for when using it. Strong physical attackers like Decidueye and Flamigo are good at pressuring Gastrodon as well as other special walls like Florges and Goodra. In return, Rotom-H covers these wallbreakers against revenge killers like Kilowattrel and Scyther; exploits nuisances like Bombirdier, Wo-Chien, and Houndstone; and gets them in safely against other walls like Scream Tail and Coalossal. A lure like Toxic Skuntank or Power Whip Goodra can either gradually or immediately get rid of Gastrodon, with both examples also softening foes like Gligar and Naclstack with Knock Off. Additional pivots like Flamigo, Zoroark, and Bruxish form strong VoltTurn cores with Rotom-H, which can be difficult for foes to withstand. While Rotom-H's bulk is good, it benefits from having proper defensive walls like Mudsdale, Galarian Slowbro, and Gastrodon to fall back on against stronger attackers while making up for their occasional passivity. Florges and Scream Tail are walls that also offer Wish support, which can reduce Rotom-H's reliance on Pain Split for recovery. Finally, Pokemon like Skuntank, Flamigo, and Mudsdale can absorb Knock Off for Rotom-H, ensuring that it doesn't lose its Heavy-Duty Boots while playing around foes like Scrafty and Copperajah.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Rotom-C makes for a decent Choice Scarf user with its solid typing, useful moves such as Trick and Volt Switch, Levitate, and solid stats all-around. While Rotom-C's Speed is average, with the Choice Scarf, it still outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame, other Choice Scarf users like Hoopa, and Speed-boosted Pokemon like Rapid Spin Tatsugiri and Dragon Dance Scrafty. Rotom-C's typing is what differentiates it from other fast Electric-types like Kilowattrel and Choice Scarf Toxtricity, letting it resist moves like Paldean Tauros-W's Wave Crash and Aqua Jet and threaten foes that can absorb Volt Switch like Golurk, Mudsdale, and, most notably, Gastrodon. While Rotom-C shares its typing with Hisuian Electrode, it is the preferred offensive option because it has naturally higher Special Attack, offers different utility moves, and does not need to hold Heavy-Duty Boots; Choice Scarf even allows Rotom-C to make up for its lower Speed. Thunderbolt gives Rotom-C a stronger Electric-type move and a more spammable STAB attack without the need to switch out or worry about stat drops. Discharge can help support slower teammates thanks to its high paralysis chance, and its lower Base Power is almost never a significant drawback. Electric is the go-to Tera type on Rotom-C, improving its ability to wear foes down with Volt Switch and clean up with either Thunderbolt or Discharge. Tera Electric also leaves Rotom-C with no weaknesses and allows it to tank certain moves like Brave Bird from Staraptor and Flamigo.</p> <p>Rotom-C will often click Volt Switch, letting it form a solid VoltTurn core with other pivots such as Scyther, Staraptor, Gligar, and Bruxish. This momentum ideally leads to the opponent switching a lot, making Gligar and other hazard setters like Duraludon and Qwilfish useful for building up chip damage. Being Choice-locked can leave Rotom-C very prediction-reliant, especially against foes immune to Volt Switch such as Gastrodon, Golurk, and Mudsdale. Gastrodon is especially notable, since it sometimes runs Sticky Hold for an immunity to Trick. Offensive checks to these Pokemon such as Meloetta, Staraptor, and Paldean Tauros-W help ease a wrong prediction, and the first two have pivot moves of their own. Teammates that can lure in and weaken these threats throughout the match such as Goodra, Ambipom, and Copperajah can also help with this. With Grass- and Dragon-types such Decidueye, Virizion, and Goodra resisting both of Rotom-C's STAB moves, it appreciates pairing with checks to them like Skuntank, Galarian Slowbro, and Florges, respectively. In return, Rotom-C offers resistances to some of their threats, such as Ground-types like Mudsdale and Steel-types like Bronzong and Copperajah. A handful of Electric-types such as Rotom-H, Kilowattrel, and Toxtricity also resist both of Rotom-C's STAB moves, so their own checks like Goodra, Gastrodon, and Golurk also come in handy. As Choice Scarf Rotom-C does not outspeed certain boosted setup sweepers like Shift Gear Toxtricity and Shell Smash Minior and other Choice Scarf users like Flamigo, it may be useful to have another form of speed control such as priority users like Extreme Speed Arcanine and Sucker Punch Skuntank. Rotom-C also loses its speed control capabilities after Trick, making these Pokemon even more valuable to have around.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Despite facing tight competition from other Fighting-types like Flamigo, Scrafty, and the Paldean Tauros formes, which are faster, more useful defensively, or both, Emboar is still a solid wallbreaker. Emboar's sheer strength, coverage, and access to Reckless-boosted STAB Flare Blitz let it easily cleave through physical walls like Galarian Slowbro and Bellibolt without requiring Choice Band or setup, making it hard for balance to pivot around. Sucker Punch makes up for Emboar's low Speed, picking off weakened foes such as Delphox and Salazzle; be mindful of utility moves like Encore and Toxic when trying to revenge kill these Pokemon, though. Knock Off punishes walls like Gligar and Altaria that are reliant on their items and can otherwise annoy Emboar, while Earthquake provides coverage for Bellibolt, Skuntank, and Qwilfish that doesn't trigger Static, Aftermath, and Rocky Helmet. Emboar can run additional Reckless-boosted coverage in Head Smash and Wild Charge to destroy Altaria and Tera Water Gligar, respectively, but these moves aren't particularly useful against most teams. These moves also wear Emboar down even faster, especially Head Smash, which limits its offensive capabilities. Even though a Jolly nature lets Emboar outspeed neutral-natured threats like Decidueye and Toxtricity, an Adamant nature allows it to potentially 2HKO Galarian Slowbro, Milotic, and physically defensive Gastrodon from full HP with the appropriate STAB move. Heavy-Duty Boots is preferred for increasing Emboar's longevity and giving it more flexibility in its approach to wallbreaking, but Choice Band can be used if Emboar wishes to go all in on decimating the opposition, letting Flare Blitz 2HKO even Mudsdale and Palossand.</p> <p>Emboar can't afford to switch directly into most Pokemon, since it's quite slow and already on a timer due to Flare Blitz's recoil; as such, it benefits a lot from being paired with pivots. Scyther, Rotom-C, and Meloetta are some offensive Pokemon that fulfill this role, baiting in walls like Coalossal and Wo-Chien for Emboar to clobber while picking up the slack for it against faster teams. Rotom-C is also notable for checking Water- and Ground-types like Milotic, Mudsdale, and Gastrodon. Slower pivots like Bellibolt, Gligar, and Milotic also generate momentum for Emboar while using their bulk and typing to stave off revenge killers like Paldean Tauros-W and Skuntank. Bellibolt can also potentially slow down faster physical attackers with Static, giving Emboar even more opportunities to fire off its strong attacks. Other paralysis spreaders like Duraludon and Dudunsparce can supply additional speed control, effectively nullifying Emboar's main flaw. Psychic- and Fairy-type sweepers such as Galarian Slowbro and Florges benefit from the immense pressure Emboar puts on Dark- and Steel-types. In return, these Pokemon offer Emboar safety from faster foes like Flamigo and Kilowattrel and can use moves like Toxic and Psychic Noise to quickly wear down nuisances like Mudsdale and Scream Tail. In addition, physical setup sweepers like Scrafty, Zoroark, and Scyther have an easier time finishing teams off with Emboar ripping through walls like Florges, Coalossal, and Houndstone early-game.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Emboar makes use of Choice Scarf to counteract its middling Speed stat, becoming a terrifying revenge killer. Its main advantages over other revenge killers are its surprise factor and, more importantly, its incredible attacking power compounded by Reckless, with Reckless-boosted Flare Blitz making light work of threats like Scyther and Florges as well as breaking past common walls such as Wo-Chien and Bronzong. Knock Off complements Emboar's dual STAB moves well; it can slice through the likes of Delphox and Golurk with no drawbacks, as well as remove items from the likes of Gligar and Galarian Slowbro switching into it. Knock Off is usually the safest move to lock into due to its complete lack of drawbacks and its guarantee of progress with item removal. Earthquake is a useful mid-ground that can hit Fire-resistant Pokemon like Delphox and Arcanine and Fighting-resistant Pokemon like Toxtricity and Galarian Slowbro in the same slot while additionally avoiding negative contact effects like Bellibolt's Static, Skuntank's Aftermath, and chip damage from the various Rocky Helmet users in the tier. Head Smash is a risky coverage option that allows Emboar to hit Altaria super effectively while cleanly OHKOing Hisuian Braviary and making light work of Arcanine. Additionally, it retains some of the benefits of Earthquake by hitting Fire-types super effectively, and, as it's a Rock-type move, it has no immunities, unlike Earthquake. Head Smash is still a risky option because the recoil damage is a huge drawback, and its accuracy is poor. Wild Charge is another midground option that lets Emboar hit Water-types like Paldean Tauros-W and Milotic and, like Head Smash, is boosted by Reckless. Tera Dark sharpens Knock Off into a strong STAB attack that can cleanly OHKO Delphox and 2HKO physically defensive Galarian Slowbro. Additionally, Tera Dark gives Emboar a relevant Psychic immunity in the face of Choice Scarf Meloetta and Galarian Articuno. Tera Fighting and Tera Fire can be used to bolster the already great power of Emboar's STAB attacks, letting it 2HKO Milotic and Arcanine with Tera Fighting Close Combat and 2HKO physically defensive Bellibolt and Gligar with Tera Fire Flare Blitz. Emboar's Choice Scarf-boosted Speed allows it to outrun even base 120 Speed Pokemon like Minior; however, Kilowattrel and various faster Choice Scarf users still outspeed and threaten Emboar.</p> <p>Emboar fits well on balance teams, where it can act as a physical attacker and revenge killer, taking the pressure off of potential defensive teammates like Florges and Duraludon in the face of threats like Delphox, Heracross, and Salazzle. In order to get the most out of Emboar, it should be paired with pivoting support, bringing it in without it taking unnecessary chip damage against offensive threats like Tatsugiri and Delphox. Good examples of partners that can provide this are Kilowattrel, Gligar, and Bellibolt. Florges appreciates Emboar's ability to threaten Steel-types like Bronzong and Alolan Sandslash. In return, it can either pass Wish, which is incredibly helpful due to Emboar's tendency to be worn down quickly, or clean up games with Calm Mind after Emboar has broken a hole in the opposing team. Healing Wish support from the likes of Mesprit is useful to not only give Emboar a second wind after it's chipped down by recoil and attacks but also clear potential status like paralysis to allow it to clean. Other physical attackers like Decidueye and Golurk can beat Milotic and Galarian Slowbro, respectively, additionally working with Emboar to take chunks out of Bellibolt. Entry hazard removal is important because Emboar already has enough issues being worn down by its own attacks; spinners like Alolan Sandslash and Hitmontop and Defoggers like Altaria and Scyther can fill this role. Kilowattrel is a good naturally fast speed control option to help round out Emboar's team and prevents over-reliance on Emboar to force out opposing threats. Choice Scarf Emboar should be used over its Heavy-Duty Boots and Choice Band variants on slower teams that rely on Emboar to outspeed and force out threats for them.</p>"

  "Scrafty": {
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Scrafty is one of the PU tier's most potent sweepers, finding ample setup opportunities thanks to its high bulk coupled with Shed Skin's chance to remove status conditions. Its defensive typing is also excellent, allowing it to shrug off attacks from foes such as Galarian Slowbro, Zoroark, and Bronzong. This is pushed even further thanks to Terastillization, allowing Scrafty to force opponents into guessing games over what moves will be effective. Dragon Dance boosts Scrafty's power while shoring up its rather poor Speed, alleviating the risk of being revenge killed by slow wallbreakers such as Rotom-H and Golurk. Drain Punch is used over Close Combat due to its ability to considerably extend Scrafty's longevity while maintaining reasonable power after a boost. Poison Jab allows Scrafty to threaten Florges with meaningful damage, while Ice Punch allows it to flip the script against Altaria and Gligar. Rest is an option in the last slot to give Scrafty a more direct means of recovery, but it generally does not want to drop its coverage option, and if Shed Skin does not activate, Scrafty becomes prone to being easily removed. The given EV spread allows Scrafty to outspeed Adamant Golurk while also avoiding the OHKO from Decidueye's +2 Leaf Blade after Stealth Rock. A spread of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Speed with a Jolly nature can also be used to make Scrafty more immediately threatening at the cost of longevity and allows it to be less wary of opposing revenge killers without the need for multiple boosts. Tera Poison boosts the power of Poison Jab and flips Scrafty's otherwise poor matchup into Fairy-types such as Florges and Grimmsnarl, though one must be wary of Psychic Noise on the former, and other Fighting-types like Paldean Tauros-W alongside giving it an immunity to Toxic. However, the newfound weaknesses to Psychic and Ground make Scrafty much more vulnerable to foes it can otherwise defeat handily such as Delphox, Bruxish, and Galarian Slowbro. Therefore, it should only be used in situations where it would guarantee Scrafty a setup opportunity or to prevent an attempt at revenge killing it after it has accumulated several boosts already.</p> <p>Scrafty functions as a potent win condition on nearly any team, utilizing the additional speed from Dragon Dance to limit offensive counterplay more effectively than Bulk Up variants. However, despite its snowballing potential, it does have a good few matchups it struggles with. Notably, Milotic and Altaria can shrug off Scrafty's attacks and dispel its boosts with Haze. In a similar vein, Mudsdale can keep up with Scrafty's onslaught thanks to the Defense boosts from Stamina, dissuade setup attempts by dealing respectable damage with Body Press, phaze it out with Roar, and punish Tera Poison with Earthquake. Therefore, Pokemon like Decidueye and Kilowattrel make excellent partners, weakening or outright removing these foes before Scrafty attempts to close out the game. In return, Scrafty offers a 4x resistance to Knock Off and can utilize its bulk in an emergency to shrug off weaker neutral hits that would cripple these frailer teammates. Scrafty also struggles considerably with Fairy-types due to needing to utilize Tera to have any sort of defensive matchup against them. Therefore, checks to these Pokemon such as Salazzle and Copperajah are greatly appreciated. Entry hazard support from Gligar, Coalossal, and Alolan Sandslash is also extremely helpful and pairs especially well with Knock Off's ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from opposing Pokemon. Faster revenge killers are also problematic, as even after a Dragon Dance, Scrafty is still somewhat slow, so partners that can stifle these foes defensively such as Bellibolt and Coalossal and priority users like Decidueye that can pick them off are extremely valuable.</p>"

      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>Scrafty utilizes Bulk Up in conjunction with Rest, Shed Skin, and good natural bulk to become a strong setup sweeper that also provides valuable defensive utility as a special wall. Drain Punch and Knock Off are solid STAB moves that give it longevity, utility, and the ability to weaken Pokemon that like their items such as Gligar and Arcanine, all while forcing out special attackers like Galarian Slowbro and Delphox. Poison Jab is a fringe option that sees use mainly to hit Florges as it switches in, making it a shakier check; however, dropping one of Knock Off or Drain Punch can cause problems for Scrafty's ability to hit Ghost-types and its longevity, respectively, while dropping Rest means Scrafty lacks immediate recovery. Rest also synergizes well with Shed Skin, buffing Rest's recovery while giving it setup opportunites on status users like Bellibolt and Altaria, which is preferable to Intimidate. Tera Poison is mainly used for flipping Scrafty's otherwise horrible 4x Fairy weakness into a resistance, letting it set up on foes like Scream Tail and Grimmsnarl, as well as giving it a useful Fighting resistance for foes like Virizion and Flamigo. This is mainly a defensive Terastallization, though, and Scrafty is unable to properly threaten these Pokemon without outside support or some chip damage accrued beforehand.</p> <p>Being a specially defensive Pokemon, Scrafty appreciates physically defensive bulwarks like Bellibolt and Galarian Slowbro that can also take on Flying- and Fighting-types like Staraptor, Flamigo, and Paldean Tauros-W for it. In return, Scrafty helps check strong special attackers like Delphox and Zoroark. Offensive partners like Staraptor and Decidueye can wear down shared checks like Mudsdale and Bombirdier for Scrafty, and in return, they appreciate Scrafty removing items from these checks. Florges also deserves a special mention, as every set can OHKO Scrafty before it Terastallizes, and Psychic Noise sets can hit Scrafty even after Terastallization, so checks like Galarian Slowbro and Alolan Sandslash to help deal with it are heavily appreciated.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Zoroark is a powerful wallbreaker that, unlike others, can surprise opponents thanks to Illusion and net KOs, paving the way for partners like Galarian Slowbro and Paldean Tauros-F. Sludge Bomb hits incoming Fairy-types that plan on taking a Dark Pulse like Scream Tail and Grimmsnarl. Trick allows Zoroark to maintain utility, as it can then cripple bulkier Pokemon like Wo-Chien and Florges and bulky setup sweepers like Scrafty and Arcanine. Focus Blast punishes Dark-types that try to take on Zoroark's Dark Pulse like Skuntank and Bombirdier. U-turn can also be run to give extra utility to Zoroark, allowing it to gain momentum. Tera Dark is preferred to boost Zoroark's wallbreaking capabilities to insane levels, allowing it to 2HKO Gastrodon after a layer of Spikes and non-Assault Vest Goodra, but Tera Poison gifts Zoroark a boost to its Sludge Bomb and a resistance to Fighting-type attacks, letting it survive a hit from Heracross and Paldean Tauros-F. However, Tera Fighting can also be used to boost Focus Blast's damage output, preventing Pokemon like Skuntank and Wo-Chien from taking on Zoroark as well as they could otherwise. Though, with the latter two Tera types, Zoroark's Psychic-type immunity turns into a weakness, worsening its matchup against Delphox, Meloetta, and Galarian Articuno.</p> <p>Zoroark's access to Illusion allows it to pair well with Paldean Tauros-W and Calm Mind Florges, as it can disguise as them to lure in and beats Pokemon such as Decidueye, Bronzong, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro, which tend to switch in to check them. Some of Zoroark's checks, namely Milotic and Assault Vest Hariyama, are open to getting chipped away at by entry hazards, so Spikes setters like Gastrodon, Alolan Sandslash, and Heracross pair well alongside it. When paired with physical wallbreakers like Emboar and Hariyama, Zoroark can have its specially defensive checks like Scrafty and Gastrodon overpowered while together they can chip away at shared checks like Milotic and Scream Tail. Fairy- and Fighting-types like Grimmsnarl and Flamigo force Zoroark out, so checks to these Pokemon like Salazzle and Bellibolt make for strong teammates. In return, Zoroark can chip away at bulky Water- and Ground-types they struggle against, such as Qwilfish and Gligar. While Zoroark can play mind games with Illusion, how healthy a Pokemon is can easily give away who's out on the battlefield, so it must be paired with teammates that have access to entry hazard removal like Altaria, Alolan Sandslash, and Tatsugiri.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Although suffering competition from other Choice Scarfers such as Florges and Flamigo due to more spammable STAB moves and more utility, Zoroark finds itself a niche thanks to a spammable STAB attack in Knock Off, great Attack and Speed stats, and Illusion allowing it to create mindgames against the opposing team. U-turn allows Zoroark to pivot against awkward matchups such as Florges and Mudsdale while generating momentum for its team. Trick cripples walls such as Bellibolt, Milotic, and Terastallized Wo-Chien as well as setup sweepers like Florges and Scrafty that would otherwise try and switch into Knock Off or try to setup and sweep. Low Kick targets Pokemon like Coalossal and opposing Dark-types such as Wo-Chien for decent damage. Tera Dark boosts the power of Knock Off, allowing Zoroark to achieve rolls such as 2HKOing Rotom-H and OHKOing Bronzong and Ambipom after minimal chip and helping Zoroark to clean up games with Knock Off. Alternatively, Tera Fighting boosts Low Kick, OHKOing Alolan Sandslash while also providing a valuable defensive typing that allows Zoroark to resist Stealth Rock and U-turn, although it makes Zoroark lose its valuable immunity to Psychic.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Zoroark finds itself fitting on balance teams looking for a revenge killer and fast pivot. Zoroark struggles to break through bulky physical walls such as Bellibolt, Coalossal, and Mudsdale, so checks to these threats like Golurk and Paldean Tauros-W make good partners. Zoroark's ability to threaten out Bronzong, Delphox, and Galarian Slowbro makes it an excellent partner to Pokemon like the aforementioned Paldean Tauros-W, Toxtricity, and Salazzle. In return, Zoroark appreciates disguising as these three in order to play mindgames with its checks such as Wo-Chien and Milotic. Hazard control from Coalossal, Altaria, and Tatsugiri allows Zoroark to be a more effective pivot and revenge killer while also helping it to keep its Illusion intact. Zoroark appreciates teammates like Decidueye, Paldean Tauros-F, and Toxtricity that can take advantage to setup or revenge kill offensive Pokemon that threaten it out, such as Paldean Tauros-W, Scrafty, and Florges.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Zoroark's high Speed and Special Attack alongside decent coverage allow it to serve as a threatening Nasty Plot sweeper. However, what allows Zoroark to excel in this field is its unpredictability, with its wide variety of sets and unique ability in Illusion giving it a definite niche over other Nasty Plot users such as Delphox and Salazzle. Sludge Bomb provides coverage for Fairy-types such as Florges and Grimmsnarl, as well as hitting other Dark-resistant foes such as Emboar, Hariyama, and Bombirdier neutrally. Flamethrower hits any remaining threats, OHKOing Skuntank and Heracross at after a Nasty Plot. Focus Blast is another option that hits many of the same neutral targets harder and, after using Nasty Plot, OHKOes some of Zoroark's largest roadblocks, such as Snorlax, Assault Vest Copperajah, Bulk Up Scrafty, and specially defensive Wo-Chien. However, this extra power is often not needed once boosted, and Focus Blast missing can put an end Zoroark's sweep instantly. While vast, Zoroark's special movepool falls short in power, so the extra boost from Life Orb is greatly appreciated and needed for many of the previously mentioned KOes. Heavy-Duty Boots can help Zoroark set up more safely and further help it bluff the opponent via Illusion, but losing out on the power boost from Life Orb is suboptimal. Tera Dark further helps with the lacking power, giving Dark Pulse its much-needed boost to KO bulky threats such as Milotic, Goodra, and Gastrodon with little previous damage. Tera Poison boosts Sludge Bomb to further its reliability against neutral targets and grants resistances to all of Dark's weaknesses, allowing Zoroark to tank a hit from threats like Florges, Flamigo, and Pawmot. Tera Ghost supplies similar resistances while giving up any offensive prowess for the useful immunity to priority moves like Arcanine's Extreme Speed and Pawmot's Mach Punch, and it can punish Choice-locked Pokemon like Emboar and Paldean Tauros-F. However, this also leaves Zoroark weak to previously resisted priority moves like Decidueye's Shadow Sneak and Skuntank's Sucker Punch. The defensive utility and surprise factor of Tera Poison and Ghost can also give Zoroark a chance to start setting up.</p> <p>Nasty Plot Zoroark is ideally run on offensive teams seeking a late-game special sweeper rather than the utility ran on Zoroark's other sets such as item control, pivoting, and speed control. As such, it should have teammates that can take out common revenge killers like Ambipom, Choice Scarf Staraptor, and Choice Scarf Paldean Tauros-F. Bellibolt and Mudsdale make for good defensive checks to these revenge killers, with the former notably being able to paralyze these faster threats with Static and safely bring Zoroark in with its slow Volt Switch. Knock Off users like Copperajah and Gligar can also be helpful with this due to being able to remove a foe's Choice Scarf. Smeargle or Vikavolt's Sticky Web is a niche option to slow down foes but is rarely run outside of teams centered around it. Fighting-types like Pawmot, Flamigo, and Hariyama pair well with Zoroark, simultaneously luring Psychic-type moves that it can take advantage of while benefitting from the opponent's hesitance to use them. Furthermore, they are able to check special walls like Scrafty and Snorlax for Zoroark. Psychic- and Ghost-types like Delphox, Hoopa, and Golurk can accomplish similar feats alongside Zoroark while keeping Fighting-types in line. The former two pair especially well with Zoroark due to also being able to run sets with both Choice items and boosting moves, leading to more mind games with the opponent. Wallbreakers like Goodra and Choice Specs Toxtricity can wear down special walls like Wo-Chien and Gastrodon to put them in KO range for a boosted Zoroark. Florges is an especially notable threat to Zoroark due to its bulk and Fairy typing, so checks to it such as Copperajah, Galarian Slowbro, and Arcanine are much appreciated.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Zoroark stands out as a very strong Swords Dance user, leveraging the lack of defensive Dark-resistant Pokemon; the various Dark-weak staples like Galarian Slowbro, Delphox, and Golurk; and Illusion allowing it to disguise itself as other Swords Dance users to give it setup opportunities and tear holes in the opposing team. Knock Off and Sucker Punch are great STAB options that give Zoroark a devastating mix of wallbreaking power and priority, with Sucker Punch allowing it to pick off weakened Choice Scarf users like Staraptor and Rotom-C. Aerial Ace allows Zoroark to hit Fighting-types like Heracross and Emboar that would survive a +2 Knock Off as well as weakening all Paldean Tauros formes, while Low Kick removes Coalossal, Regirock, and Duraladon consistently; both of these options let it remove or severely weaken Scrafty and Wo-Chien. A Life Orb in conjunction with Tera Dark gives Zoroark outstanding power at +2; it gains great odds to OHKO physically defensive bulwarks like Bellibolt and Mudsdale after a single layer of Spikes, as well as always OHKOing Milotic, Altaria, and specially defensive Alolan Sandslash. Heavy-Duty Boots forgoes the power on Life Orb in favor of more bluffing potential and less chip damage, getting more setup opportunities as a result. Black Glasses can be used to hit similar damage benchmarks compared to Life Orb without taking recoil; however, it misses out on the guaranteed OHKOs stated above and has worse odds to OHKO Bellibolt and Mudsdale under the same circumstances.</p> <p>Swords Dance Zoroark is an effective wallbreaker but struggles with faster Pokemon that resist Sucker Punch and slower priority users that resist Sucker Punch, like Skuntank, Paldean Tauros-W, and Choice Scarf users like Flamigo, so checks to these Pokemon are highly recommended. Bellibolt and Houndstone are solid switch-ins on bulkier playstyles, while Paldean Tauros-F and Decidueye can use Skuntank and Paldean Tauros-W, respectively, as setup fodder or can easily revenge kill them with priority after Zoroark has weakened them. Zoroark heavily appreciates partners that it can disguise itself as effectively; some notable ones include Bruxish, Scyther, and Delphox, since Zoroark disguised as them can take advantage of their switch-ins like Milotic and Meloetta. Bruxish and Scyther's access to Swords Dance as well as Scyther's and Delphox's Speed tiers make it hard to tell if it's Zoroark or not.</p>"

Golurk excels at dismantling common defensive cores thanks to its high Attack and great typing, which let it switch into and force out defensive staples like Galarian Slowbro and Bellibolt. Dynamic Punch lets Golurk 2HKO Wo-Chien while also hitting other Dark- and Normal-types like Scrafty and Snorlax and threatening confusion against everything else. Close Combat can be used as an alternative due to its higher Base Power, which lets it guarantee a 2HKO on Wo-Chien after Leech Seed recovery; however, Golurk misses out on the confusion, and the Defense and Special Defense drops make it more susceptible to being revenge killed. Ice Punch lets Golurk OHKO Bombirdier and Staraptor while also serving as a good middle ground into Gligar. Stone Edge can be used as an alternative that's stronger versus neutral targets and has a higher chance to land a critical hit; although, Golurk loses out on the ability to deal with Gligar. Tera Dark flips Golurk's Ghost and Dark weaknesses while also removing its Water and Ice weaknesses, allowing it to avoid revenge kill attempts from Pokemon like Skuntank, Bombirdier, and opposing Golurk. Tera Ghost can be used instead to further boost Golurk's power, letting it 2HKO Pokemon like Gligar and guaranteeing OHKOs against Pokemon like Rotom-H with Poltergeist while still removing its susceptibility to Water- and Ice-type moves to avoid revenge killing attempts from Pokemon like Paldean Tauros-W.</p> <p>Golurk works best alongside Pokemon that benefit from its wallbreaking abilities such as Choice Scarf Staraptor and Curse Arcanine, which struggle with Bellibolt and Gastrodon, respectively. While Golurk has the coverage to hit the likes of Staraptor, Bombirdier, and Wo-Chien, their presence on the opposing team hurts its ability to freely use its STAB moves and forces it to make more predictions, so teammates that can handle these Pokemon like Bellibolt, which checks Staraptor and Bombirdier, and Paldean Tauros-F, which helps against Wo-Chien, make excellent partners. Furthermore, Paldean Tauros-F offensively and defensively checks the Dark-types that threaten Golurk, and other Fighting-types like Paldean Tauros-W and Flamigo are similarly good partners for this purpose. Golurk is also forced out by Water- and Grass-types, so teammates that can switch into these Pokemon, like Milotic and Gastrodon for Paldean Tauros-W and Tatsugiri as well as Skuntank for Decidueye, are incredible partners for Golurk.</p>"

Hyper Voice is preferred, as it is stronger, but Tera Blast allows Meloetta to use Terastallization to flip matchups versus targets that typically comfortably switch into its Normal STAB move such as Copperajah with Tera Fighting while still being a functional Normal-type STAB move before Terastallizing. Psyshock is preferred, as it allows Meloetta to put pressure on Calm Mind users such as Florges and 3HKO Assault Vest Copperajah, which otherwise walls non-Focus Blast Meloetta. On the other hand, Psychic allows Meloetta to deal more damage to physically defensive targets such as Gligar and Bellibolt. Shadow Ball hits Galarian Slowbro and Bronzong while OHKOing Decidueye after Stealth Rock and also takes advantage of Serene Grace to put more pressure on foes with Special Defense drops. Focus Blast nails Scrafty and Wo-Chien, OHKOes Alolan Sandslash, and puts huge dents in checks like Copperajah, Naclstack, and Coalossal at the cost of inconsistency. If Meloetta opts for Focus Blast, Hyper Voice should be used as its Normal-type STAB move. Alluring Voice is an alternative that outright OHKOes Scrafty and Bombirdier while still 2HKOing Wo-Chien. Tera Ghost lets Meloetta 2HKO Alolan Sandslash and OHKO Houndstone with Shadow Ball while preventing it from being revenge killed by Arcanine's Extreme Speed and allowing it to spinblock versus checks like Coalossal and the aforementioned Alolan Sandslash, though making it susceptible to Decidueye's Shadow Sneak. Tera Normal boosts the power of Hyper Voice, 2HKOing Florges and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro while also making Meloetta less susceptible to being revenge killed by Sucker Punch from Skuntank and Bombirdier. Tera Fighting also helps versus Sucker Punch users and lets Meloetta function as an emergency check to +1 Scrafty and should be used in conjunction with Tera Blast to allow Meloetta to take on checks such as Copperajah and Alolan Sandslash, though it could also be used with Focus Blast to outright OHKO checks such as Coalossal and Assault Vest Copperajah; however, this is usually less useful than Tera Ghost or Normal on Focus Blast variants.</p> <p>Meloetta's potent wallbreaking capabilities make it a strong pick on bulky offense teams. Bellibolt is a good partner, as it can take on Skuntank and Bombirdier for Meloetta while being able to pivot to generate opportunities for Meloetta; in return, Meloetta's natural special bulk allows it to take on threats such as Toxtricity and Hoopa. Other pivots such as Scyther and Flamigo are also appreciated, as they force in targets such as Bellibolt, Galarian Slowbro, and Houndstone, which Meloetta can exploit while also matching up well into offensive threats to Meloetta such as Scrafty and Paldean Tauros-W and some defensive answers such as Wo-Chien. Meloetta's natural bulk facilitates wallbreaking opportunities; to utilize this effectively, entry hazards should ideally be off its side of the field, so teammates such as Alolan Sandslash and Coalossal are appreciated. Arcanine is a good partner, as it appreciates Meloetta's ability to weaken shared checks such as Coalossal to facilitate it sweeping late-game; in return, Arcanine can take on physical threats such as Scrafty and Decidueye, which could otherwise use Meloetta as setup fodder, depending on which move it is locked into. Choice Scarf Staraptor is a partner that appreciates Meloetta overwhelming foes such as Bronzong, Copperajah, and Coalossal, allowing Staraptor to use Brave Bird or Double-Edge more freely; in return, Staraptor revenge kills faster threats to Meloetta such as Paldean Tauros-W and Choice Scarf Flamigo.</p>"

At +2, Fire Blast is able to 2HKO Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro, OHKO Bronzong, and even OHKO Bellibolt after Stealth Rock. While Flamethrower can be more consistent in terms of accuracy, its lower damage output will often lead to Delphox missing important benchmarks. Psyshock gives Delphox a way to reliably damage frailer foes that resist Fire Blast such as Salazzle as well as an option to muscle through special walls such as Florges. It also provides a reliable option to damage Pokemon that may not be hit super effectively by Delphox's other coverage moves, such as Tatsugiri and Coalossal, as well as a way to secure KOs in cases where Fire Blast missing would result in a sticky situation. Delphox's last moveslot is adjustable; Encore allows Delphox to lock foes into undesirable moves like Gastrodon's Stealth Rock and Scrafty's Bulk Up and generate setup opportunities. Grass Knot is a reliable coverage option against bulky Ground-types that may not crumble to a Fire Blast such as Gastrodon, Mudsdale, and Golurk, while Dazzling Gleam deals consistent damage to Bulk Up Paldean Tauros-W and lets Delphox beat Scrafty without prior chip damage. Tera Fairy provides Delphox with a resistance to Dark and prevents it from being revenge killed by Sucker Punch users such as Skuntank and Bombirdier while also removing other problematic weaknesses to Water, Ground, and Ghost and boosting the power of Dazzling Gleam.</p> <p>Delphox is rather frail, so it needs teammates that can pivot it in safely such as Milotic, Rotom-C, and Gligar.

Sticky Web support from Vikavolt is also valued, allowing Delphox to remedy its sometimes awkward Speed tier. Pokemon that can discourage or absorb Knock Off, like Virizion and Scrafty, also make good partners, as Delphox largely relies on Heavy-Duty Boots to find opportunities to switch in. Checks to Decidueye, such as Ambipom and Bombirdier, are also highly valued, as Delphox is 2HKOed by a Spell Tag-boosted Shadow Sneak. Decidueye itself, alongside Pokemon like Paldean Tauros-W and Scrafty, are also valuable for their ability to take on a myriad of other foes that can threaten Delphox offensively, such as Golurk and Zoroark. Faster revenge killers like Kilowattrel and Salazzle are also threatening, so Pokemon with priority moves like Sucker Punch Zoroark, Aqua Jet Paldean Tauros-W, and Shadow Sneak Decidueye make excellent partners. Choice Scarf users such as Duraludon, Staraptor, and Flamigo can also fulfill this role. In return, Delphox can blow holes in the opposing team, allowing these Pokemon to clean up once their checks have been weakened.</p>"

Synthesis allows Florges to recover health against Pokemon it forces out such as Bombirdier, Wo-Chien, and Altaria; however, it is risky if Florges has not given away its Choice Scarf with Trick. Calm Mind makes Florges become a setup sweeper after using Trick to give away its Choice Scarf. Tera Blast should be used with Tera Groundto hit Pokemon that otherwise wall it such as Galarian Slowbro and Coalossal while also providing defensive utility against Pokemon like Skuntank. Psychic is a decent mid-ground against Poison-types such as Salazzle and Toxtricity and comes with the benefit of targeting these two without Terastallizing. Finally, Wish gives Florges utility by allowing it to help heal its teammates' HP. Tera Fairy boosts Moonblast to incredible amounts of power, allowing Florges to 2HKO Bellibolt and OHKO Kilowattrel. Florges can either opt for an EV spread of 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe or use a more bulky EV spread of 252 HP / 24 Def / 232 Spe, which allows it to have enough Speed to outpace Jolteon and Adamant Bombirdier as well as Skuntank after Trick, and it can pass bigger Wishes to its teammates. Finally, Tera Poison is a purely defensive Tera type that allows Florges to take attacks from Pokemon like Salazzle, Decidueye, and Duraludon.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Florges finds itself mostly on offense and balance teams looking for a reliable form of speed control that can disrupt balance teams thanks to Trick.

Florges can't reliably break though Steel- and Poison-types such as Bronzong, Galarian Slowbro, and Copperajah without Terastallizing, so Pokemon that can take these threats on like Zoroark, Mudsdale, and Paldean Tauros-F all make good partners. Florges's ability to revenge kill Pokemon like Paldean Tauros-W and Zoroark allows slower wallbreakers that struggle with these faster threats such as Golurk, Rotom-H, and Decidueye to be more potent attackers. Since it can't run Heavy-Duty Boots and will likely switch in often, Florges appreciates entry hazard control from Pokemon like Altaria, Coalossal, and Tastugiri so it can become more threatening.

Tera Blast should be paired with Tera Ground, which allows Florges to break through Poison- and Fire-types like Galarian Slowbro, Coalossal, and Arcanine. Finally, Wish allows Florges to provide support for its team and gives it extra PP for recovery to pair with Synthesis; it is primarily used as a wall rather than a primary win condition, although it comes at the cost of not having coverage. The given EV spread allows Florges to obtain as much physical bulk as possible while also outspeeding Adamant Golurk as well as opposing walls such as Wo-Chien and Milotic. When not running Tera Blast, Tera Poison is ideal for a strong defensive typing, allowing Florges to set up against Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro and Bellibolt. Tera Ground should be paired with Tera Blast, and although it provides a worse defensive typing, it allows Florges to set up against Pokemon like Salazzle as well as Pokemon like Kilowattrel and Delphox.</p> <p>Florges is most commonly used on bulky balance teams looking for a secondary wincon that, when teamed with a primary wincon like Arcanine and Decidueye, can also function as a special wall or a Wish passer if need be.

Likewise, in order for Florges to attempt a sweep without Tera Blast Ground, Fire- and Steel-types like Arcanine, Delphox, and Alolan Sandslash must be chipped or KOed, which can be achieved by Pokemon like Golurk, Bruxish, and Rotom-H. In return, Florges can soft check and threaten out their offensive checks like Zoroark and Goodra. Florges's ability to soft check and threaten Dark- and Fighting-types like Grimmsnarl, Zoroark, Scrafty, and Hariyama makes the likes of Galarian Slowbro, Galarian Articuno, and one's own Scrafty amazing partners. In return, these three can defensively or offensively check some of Florges's own checks like an opposing Galarian Slowbro and Bronzong. If Florges opts for Wish, the ability to pass Wish is extremely beneficial to offensive partners like Staraptor and Decidueye, which chip away at opposing walls like Milotic and Gastrodon that can phaze out Florges, allowing Florges to sweep; Wish is also beneficial for partner walls lacking reliable recovery like Mudsdale, Houndstone, and Gligar.</p>"

Synthesis gives Florges reliable recovery, although Protect synergizes well with Wish and allows Florges to scout out attacks from Choice-locked Pokemon such as Staraptor and Flamigo. Psychic Noise lets Florges disrupt walls such as Gastrodon and Bellibolt by preventing them from recovering while also being a decent coverage option against Poison-types such as Salazzle and Toxtricity. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Florges to ignore entry hazards, although Leftovers is an option to give small amounts of recovery that can be helpful in tandem with Protect. The given EV spread allows Florges to outspeed Wo-Chien and Milotic while investing as much into Defense as possible to take advantage of its valuable resistances to Fighting and Dark. Tera Poison grants Florges a resistance to Grass- and Poison-type attacks from Pokemon like Rotom-C, Salazzle, and Skuntank.</p> <p>Florges finds itself on bulky balance teams that like its ability to Wish pass while also being a great mixed wall. Walls lacking recovery like Gligar, Mudsdale, and Bronzong appreciate Florges's ability to keep them healthy throughout the game. Florges can struggle with Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro, Skuntank, and Copperajah, which it can't Wish pass safely against, so Pokemon that can check these threats and also benefit from Florges's Wish passing capabilities such as Golurk, Mudsdale, and Arcanine make good partners. Florges's ability to check Pokemon like Scrafty and Kilowattrel makes it an excellent partner for Pokemon that struggle against these threats, such as Decidueye and Zoroark. Even though it resists Fighting-type attacks, Florges still appreciates other Fighting-resistant teammates like Galarian Slowbro and Altaria to not be its team's sole switch-in to them.The latter also takes advantage of setup sweepers Florges can't handle on its own, like Decidueye.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Goodra finds a home in PU as a bulky attacker with exceptional offensive coverage, utility, and natural bulk. Flamethrower hits Steel-type walls like Bronzong and Copperajah for super effective damage, limiting the amount of times they can come in and try to absorb Draco Meteors. Sludge Bomb hits Florges, Grimmsnarl, and Scream Tail hard while also providing opportunities to fish for poisons against bulky Pokemon that don't immediately threaten Goodra like Coalossal, Gastrodon, Milotic, and Wo-Chien. Knock Off is a great utility move for Goodra, as it can remove Eviolite from Gligar and Heavy-Duty Boots from specially defensive walls like Coalossal and opposing Goodra, allowing entry hazards to hinder their ability to switch in later in the game. Toxic can more reliably hinder defensive walls like Bellibolt and Gastrodon than Sludge Bomb at the cost of not providing immediate damage. Acid Spray can be used to limit the ability of specially defensive walls like Coalossal and Gastrodon from absorbing attacks and stacking hazards. Both Toxic and Acid Spray can dissuade Pokemon like Hisuian Braviary and Rotom-H from setting up. Dragon Tail is an excellent utility move to phaze setup attempts, notably preventing Curse Arcanine, Scrafty, and Throat Spray Toxtricity from getting too comfortable, while accruing hazard chip damage. Scald is an optional move for Goodra that can hit Coalossal hard and fish for burns. Tera Poison gives Goodra a resistance to Fairy and Fighting, allowing it to more reliably match up into Florges, Scream Tail, and Paldean Tauros-W while also preventing Goodra from getting worn down by poison. Tera Poison does, however, limit Goodra as a switch-in to Ground-type attacks, notably making Gastrodon, Gligar, and Mudsdale much more difficult to switch into. Tera Fairy helps into opposing Goodra, Nasty Plot Tatsugiri, and Fighting-types like Hariyama and Paldean Tauros-W. Tera Dragon can be used to boost the damage output of Draco Meteor, allowing for notable OHKOs into Arcanine and Houndstone after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKOs into Bellibolt, Galarian Slowbro, and Gligar, though it doesn't provide defensive utility like Tera Poison and Fairy do.</p> <p>Heavy-Duty Boots Goodra fits best on balance and bulky offense structures that can maximize its ability to both defensively and offensively apply pressure throughout a game. Goodra appreciates support from physically defensive teammates, such as Bellibolt, Galarian Slowbro, and Houndstone, that can switch into the litany of wallbreakers in the tier that threaten it like Staraptor and Paldean Tauros-W. Goodra can form defensive cores with entry hazard setters like Coalossal, Gastrodon, and Gligar to create difficult-to-break pairings that force switches and accumulate gradual chip. Offensive teammates that try to set up and clean late-game, like Curse Arcanine and Bulk Up Scrafty, can benefit from Goodra switching into and wearing down faster special attackers like Toxtricity and Zoroark. VoltTurn cores with teammates such as Ambipom, Kilowattrel, and Staraptor can pivot Goodra into favorable matchups safely and keep offensive pressure on. Poison- and Steel-types that can handle Fairy-types like Calm Mind Florges and Scream Tail, like Salazzle, Bronzong, and Copperajah, are excellent teammates to keep Goodra from needing to Tera to deal with them reliably. Choice Scarf users like Flamigo, Staraptor, and Toxtricity especially appreciate the gradual wear-and-tear that Knock Off Goodra and hazards can put on defensive foes, making their late-game cleaning or mid-game breaking much easier.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Goodra functions as a competent wallbreaker in PU, utilizing its respectable Special Attack and excellent coverage to shred through foes. Sap Sipper is also extremely helpful, allowing Goodra to not fear Wo-Chien's Leech Seed, as well as letting it more easily come in against foes such as Rotom-C and Hisuian Electrode and retailiate with a devastating blow. Flamethrower gives Goodra the means to hit Steel-types like Alolan Sandslash and Levitate Bronzong for meaningful damage. Fire Blast is less reliable but does ensure the 2HKO on Bronzong after Leftovers recovery. However, Flamethrower is generally preferred, as it does not miss out on any important damage benchmarks, and Goodra's Fire-type coverage is most often used to punish Steel-types as they switch in. Sludge Bomb allows Goodra to catch Fairy-types expecting a Draco Meteor by surprise, such as Scream Tail and Florges. Goodra's last moveslot is customizable; Dragon Pulse offers a reliable alternative to Draco Meteor that exchanges power for perfect accuracy and the ability to secure 2HKOs against foes like Gastrodon and Bellibolt without worrying about being stalled out by Recover, while Scald offers a handy OHKO against Coalossal after Stealth Rock as well as the ability to bully physical wallbreakers like Paldean Tauros-W with the threat of a burn should they attempt to switch in on it. Tera Poison helps shore up Goodra's defensive matchup against Fairy-types like Grimmsnarl and Florges while boosting the power of Sludge Bomb, even giving Goodra a chance to OHKO Grimmsnarl after Stealth Rock. Tera Fairy also somewhat helps Goodra's defensive matchup against Fairy-types, helps it check foes like Paldean Tauros-W and Zoroark, and provides it with an immunity to opposing Goodra's STAB moves. Tera Dragon is also an option to boost the power of Draco Meteor to absurd levels, and it nets certain damage rolls such as OHKOing Bellibolt and having a chance to 2HKO Assault Vest Meloetta. It also bolsters Dragon Pulse's rather mediocre power but offers absolutely no additional defensive utility. A Modest nature can also be used for additional power, but this does notably make Goodra slower than Timid Hoopa and Adamant Heracross, Skuntank, and Bombirdier.</p> <p>Choice Specs Goodra is a powerful wallbreaker on balance teams, offering an intersection of power and unique defensive utility that can keep opponents guessing. Checks to Steel-types, such as Delphox and Paldean Tauros-F, are valued for their ability to make Goodra less prediction reliant, and Pokemon like Skuntank and Copperajah that can easily remove Fairy-types are immensely valuable due to making Draco Meteor much safer. Although it acts as a soft check to a large number of special attackers, Goodra can be worn down rather easily. For this reason, Florges and Scream Tail are also notable partners thanks to their ability to take some of the burden off of Goodra as a special wall while also compensating for its lack of recovery with Wish. Teammates like Gastrodon, Mudsdale, and Milotic greatly appreciate Goodra's immunity to Grass and can take the brunt of attacks that would otherwise wear it down quickly. While Goodra's special bulk is exceptional, the lack of Heavy-Duty Boots and recovery makes it difficult to get in safely, so pivots like Gligar, Rotom-H, and Scyther are greatly appreciated. In return, Goodra can whittle down checks to these Pokemon like Coalossal, Mudsdale, and Bellibolt with ease.</p>"

Mountain Gale threatens a multitude of common leads such as Gligar, Mudsdale, and Bombirdier with high damage. Body Press capitalizes on Hisuian Avalugg's gargantuan Defense to punish Steel-types like Alolan Sandslash and Copperajah that it may otherwise struggle with. Alternatively, Earthquake can be used to deal extra damage to targets like Coalossal while also still hitting the aforementioned Steel-types and dealing considerable damage to Fire-types such as Delphox and Paldean Tauros-F. Rapid Spin offers additional role compression and pairs well with Hisuian Avalugg's ability to victimize most common hazard setters, sometimes even letting it remove the opponent's hazards permanently at the beginning of the match. It also gives Hisuian Avalugg some utility outside of being a dedicated lead, although using Hisuian Avalugg for this purpose is generally not optimal, as the damage from opposing hazards breaks Sturdy and makes Hisuian Avalugg exceptionally more vulnerable to opposing wallbreakers. 0 Special Defense IVs in combination with a Naughty nature can be used to ensure that opposing special attackers will nearly always trigger Sturdy, although it is generally not necessary due to Hisuian Avalugg's pitiful Special Defense. Tera Ghost further compounds Hisuian Avalugg's utility by making it immune to Rapid Spin, allowing it to keep hazards up in a pinch against Tatsugiri and Coalossal, while also removing its crippling weaknesses to Fighting and Steel, making it much more effective against foes such as Toxicroak and Copperajah. However, this should be done sparingly, as it is often more ideal to Terastallize more offensive teammates such as Decidueye and Arcanine.</p> <p>Hisuian Avalugg fits exclusively on hyper offense teams that appreciate its ability to reliably set entry hazards and punish foes for attempting to do so. However, due to the nature of being a hazard lead, it will often faint rather quickly and have few — if any — opportunities to set Stealth Rock again. Therefore, Taunt users like Skuntank and Bombirdier as well as Ghost-types like Decidueye that can stop attempts at hazard removal are highly valuable. Knock Off users such as Zoroark, Skuntank, and Bombirdier are also valuable thanks to their ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes, ensuring that Hisuian Avalugg's hazards will be effective. In addition, teammates such as Arcanine and Minior appreciate Hisuian Avalugg's ability to remove hazards, allowing them to utilize items such as Leftovers and White Herb. Pokemon like Scrafty, Toxtricity, and Arcanine also greatly appreciate Hisuian Avalugg's ability to threaten and remove foes like Gligar and Mudsdale that are otherwise extreme nuisances while also being able to act as an emergency stopgap against revenge killers like Flamigo. Powerful wallbreakers such as Delphox and the Paldean Tauros formes also greatly appreciate Hisuian Avalugg's consistency in setting Stealth Rock, further lowering the number of times that Pokemon like Milotic and Florges can switch into their STAB moves.</p>"

Psyshock is the generally superior Psychic-type move, letting it more easily break through common specially defensive Pokemon like Florges, Gastrodon, and Goodra. Alternatively, Psychic has more power, hitting the likes of Bellibolt, Mudsdale, and Gligar stronger than Psyshock. Focus Blast synergizes well with Hoopa's STAB moves, hitting Dark-types such as Scrafty, Bombirdier, and Wo-Chien that would otherwise hinder Hoopa's offensive progress. Trick is a useful utility move, hampering Pokemon such as Coalossal, Gastrodon, and Milotic that Hoopa would otherwise do lackluster damage to. Tera Fighting further powers up Focus Blast, letting it do things such as 2HKO Bellibolt and Grimmsnarl and potentially OHKO non-Assault Vest Duraludon and Wo-Chien. It also presents amazing defensive benefits, giving Hoopa a resistance to Sucker Punch from Skuntank and Zoroark and a neutrality to Decidueye's Shadow Sneak. Alternatively, Tera Ghost further powers up Shadow Ball, letting Hoopa 2HKO Gligar and Altaria and OHKO Kilowattrel while improving Hoopa's ability to clean late-game.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Hoopa fits best on offensive teams as both a form of speed control and a fast wallbreaker and capable of overwhelming both offensive and defensive foes alike. Hoopa's STAB moves are resisted by Dark-types, which leaves it vulnerable to being taken advantage of by Pokemon like Scrafty, Skuntank, and Zoroark, relying on the inaccurate Focus Blast to hit them. As a result, Pokemon that can beat Dark-types such as Florges, Paldean Tauros-W, Flamigo, and Heracross make for excellent partners, beating these threats while appreciating Hoopa's ability to break through the likes of Galarian Slowbro, Gligar, and Houndstone. Additionally, these Pokemon appreciate Hoopa's speed control, opening them up to performing other roles. They can also absorb Knock Off, which lets Hoopa both maintain its speed control and its longevity. Entry hazard setters such as Mudsdale, Bombirdier, and Duraludon heavily appreciate Hoopa's capability as a spinblocker while helping chip down foes such as Bellibolt and Rotom-H for Hoopa to 2HKO. The last two also check Decidueye, whose Shadow Sneak would otherwise force Hoopa out. Other wallbreakers such as Decidueye, Flamigo, Tatsugiri, and Zoroark can help wear down checks such as Skuntank, Meloetta, and Grimmsnarl while appreciating Hoopa's high Speed with Choice Scarf.</p>"

While Spirit Shackle is generally preferred for its increased accuracy, Poltergeist can be opted instead for its higher power, allowing Decidueye to OHKO Bellibolt with Tera Ghost after a Swords Dance, although its anti-synergy with Knock Off can make it unappealing. Leaf Blade targets Pokemon such as Mudsdale and Milotic, but if these aren't issues, then Low Kick can allow Decidueye to not be walled by Coalossal while also dealing with Alolan Sandslash and Copperajah. Shadow Sneak is useful priority to pick off faster weakened threats like Salazzle and Delphox. Knock Off can be used to give Decidueye extra utility and punish common switch-ins like Staraptor and Wo-Chien, but it is very hard to justify using it over other moves, and it does not work well with Poltergeist. Spell Tag lets Decidueye OHKO Toxtricity with unboosted Poltergeist and Tatsugiri with +2 Shadow Sneak after Stealth Rock. Decidueye's choice of Tera type is flexible; Tera Ghost boosts the power of its Ghost-type STAB moves and gives Decidueye a better defensive typing, allowing it to spinblock Alolan Sandslash and set up on Pokemon like Delphox and Salazzle, while Tera Fairy allows Decidueye to take on Dark-type Pokemon like Zoroark and Scrafty.</p> <p>Decidueye excels on offensive or balance teams looking for a strong wallbreaker with sweeping and cleaning potential. Faster Normal-types like Staraptor, Meloetta, and Ambipom cannot be swept by Shadow Sneak and can threaten Decidueye in return, so checks to these Pokemon like Bellibolt and Gligar make good partners. Decidueye is also relatively frail, so slow pivots like Bellibolt, Gligar, and Milotic can help bring it in safely. Florges, Mudsdale, Paldean Tauros-W, and Skuntank can help switch into Decidueye's checks like opposing Skuntank, Bombirdier, Scrafty, and Galarian Articuno. Decidueye can struggle against offensive Fire-types like Arcanine and Paldean Tauros-F, so Pokemon like Mudsdale and Milotic make excellent partners. Decidueye's ability to beat common physical walls like Mudsdale, Galarian Slowbro, and Bellibolt make other physical sweepers like Arcanine, Ambipom, and Paldean Tauros-W valuable teammates.

        "description": "<p>Although facing slight competition from Golurk, Decidueye's great STAB combo, ability to pivot thanks to U-turn, great ability in Long Reach, and good Attack stat make it a great all-out attacker in PU. Spirit Shackle is generally preferred for its better accuracy and lack of conflict with Knock Off, although Poltergeist is an option if the extra power is preferred, allowing Decidueye to OHKO Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro with a boosting item and Stealth Rock chip damage. Shadow Sneak is valuable priority, allowing Decidueye to pick off faster threats and setup sweepers such as Salazzle, Delphox, and Flamigo. U-turn allows Decidueye to operate as a pivot, allowing it to safely escape unfavorable matchups such as Bellibolt, Bombirdier, Coalossal, and Wo-Chien. Leaf Blade is a secondary STAB move that targets Ground-types such as Gastrodon and Mudsdale, but if these aren't an issue, Low Kick allows Decidueye to hit Steel-types such as Copperajah and Alolan Sandslash as well as Coalossal. On Heavy-Duty Boots variants, Sucker Punch is a viable option that targets faster Normal-types like Meloetta and Staraptor and hits Ghost-types harder than Shadow Sneak; however, Shadow Sneak normally provides more value. Choice Band grants Decidueye incredibly high power, allowing it to 2HKO even Skuntank and Bombirdier after minor chip damage and more easily push past Pokemon like Bellibolt, Duraludon, and Coalossal. Spell Tag only boosts Decidueye's Ghost-type STAB moves but lets it switch attacks, which makes it less prediction reliant. Heavy-Duty Boots is an alternative to not take entry hazard damage, which is especially useful with U-turn. Just like Spell Tag, Tera Ghost boosts Decidueye's Ghost-type STAB moves, allowing it to achieve rolls such as 2HKOing Florges with Spirit Shackle, potentially OHKOing Delphox with Spell Tag-boosted Shadow Sneak, and 2HKOing Bellibolt with Spell Tag-boosted Poltergeist. Alternatively, Tera Fairy is a purely defensive Tera type that allows Decidueye to live Dark-type attacks like Sucker Punch and Knock Off from Pokemon like Skuntank, Scrafty, and Emboar and threaten them back.</p> <p>Decidueye finds itself on offensive and bulky offensive teams that appreciate its unique ability to function as a wallbreaker, spinblocker, and pivot all in one. Even with Low Kick and U-turn, Decidueye can struggle against Dark-types such as Skuntank, Bombirdier, and Wo-Chien that it can't reliably beat, so Pokemon that can check these threats such as Mudsdale, Florges, and Flamigo all make excellent partners. Other pivots such as Bellibolt, Milotic, and Gligar make a great pivot core with Decidueye and can be fallbacks for it against Pokemon such as Coalossal, Bombirdier, and Scyther. If Decidueye opts to not run Heavy-Duty Boots, entry hazard control from Pokemon like Altaria, Coalossal, and Alolan Sandslash allows Decidueye to be a better pivot and wallbreaker. In turn, Decidueye beats their checks such as Gastrodon and Bronzong. Decidueye's ability to pressure common defensive cores such as Galarian Slowbro and Wo-Chien as well as Gastrodon and Bellibolt allows teammates like Arcanine and Toxtricity to set up and sweep. Decidueye's Ghost typing allows it to be a failsafe against Pokemon like Arcanine and Quick Attack Scyther, making it a decent teammate for the likes of Wo-Chien and Paldean Tauros-F. Likewise, if it's running Spirit Shackle, Decidueye can trap and revenge kill Pokemon like Scyther and Florges, enabling teammates like Zoroark and Goodra.</p>"

Endeavor is useful for ensuring Lycanroc whittles down bulky Pokemon switching in when its Focus Sash has been broken. Accelerock can also be used as a devastating follow-up for Endeavor, always ensuring that Lycanroc will at least trade with something; however, this comes at the downside of having worse matchups versus opposing entry hazards leads. Maximum Attack investment gives Lycanroc better rolls on Rock Blast, always OHKOing Froslass and Smeargle in 3 hits as opposed to requiring 4, and this investment helps Lycanroc break its Focus Sash easier in conjunction with minimal HP, Defense, and Special Defense IVs. Tera Ghost is used to prevent opposing Rapid Spin users like Alolan Sandslash and Coalossal from removing entry hazards, but it should be used only in dire situations, as the types of teams Lycanroc fits on can rarely afford to use Terastallization too early.</p> <p>As an entry hazard lead, Lycanroc fits exclusively on hyper offense teams that can take advantage of the pressure Stealth Rock provides and the lack of Stealth Rock on their side, so partners include Pokemon such as Arcanine, Zoroark, Paldean Tauros-W, and Decidueye, all of which are very strong choices on hyper offense. Ghost-types like the aforementioned Decidueye and Houndstone can stop Rapid Spin users like Coalossal and Tastugiri from removing Stealth Rock, though they are only consistent at this short-term. Lycanroc is also often removed by faster Pokemon like Ambipom, Salazzle, and Choice Scarf Rotom-C, so Pokemon that can set up on them like Paldean Tauros-F and Toxtricity are greatly appreciated.

Body Press lets Mudsdale put Stamina to good use, allowing it to get good damage off on Zoroark, Scrafty, and Tera Normal Arcanine. Heavy Slam, on the other hand, hits Flying-types neutrally while also letting Mudsdale hit Fairy-types that could otherwise easily set up in front of it like Scream Tail, Florges, and Grimmsnarl. However, Stone Edge hits Flying-types like Staraptor and Bombirdier super effectively while also threatening Rotom-H. Roar deters setup sweepers like Bulk Up Scrafty, Hariyama, and Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro before they get out of hand. Leftovers improves Mudsdale's longevity, while Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers like Staraptor and Scyther. Tera Water allows Mudsdale to take on Water-type wallbreakers like Paldean Tauros-W and Tatsugiri in a pinch, but it can no longer check Pawmot and Bellibolt as easily as before. On the other hand, Tera Steel grants Mudsdale the ability to check Fairy-types like Florges and Scream Tail, boosts Heavy Slam's damage output, and helps its matchup versus Galarian Articuno, Goodra, and Decidueye.

Like Encore, it also allows Salazzle to work around its mediocre bulk. Both Trailblaze to boost Salazzle's Speed and Tera Blast Grass to allow Salazzle to hit Gastrodon are options as well, but they are niche due to not providing as much value compared to other moves. Focus Sash gives Salazzle an easier time setting up and securing KOes and lets it serve as an emergency check to a threat like Shift Gear Toxtricity. It should only be used on hyper offense teams, since other playstyles are more likely to let entry hazards go up and ruin Salazzle. Tera Dark allows Salazzle to gain a valuable defensive typing, allowing it to more easily set up on Psychic-types like Delphox and Hoopa. Alternatively, Tera Ghost also provides Salazzle setup opportunities—particularly against Choice-locked Fighting-types like Paldean Tauros-F and Emboar—and can allow it to be immune to priority from Arcanine and Scyther, although it comes at a cost of being weak to other priority such as Shadow Sneak from Decidueye and Sucker Punch from Bombirdier.</p> <p>Nasty Plot Salazzle finds itself on offense and hyper offense teams as well as on balance teams looking for a reliable wincon and attacker that can be valuable before setting up by spreading Toxic or enabling other setup sweepers with Encore. While strong, Salazzle can find itself struggling to break against offensive and defensive Water-types. like Qwilfish, Gastrodon, and Milotic, so checks to these threats like one's own Gastrodon, Kilowattrel, and Decidueye make good partners. In return, Salazzle can aid these Pokemon by chipping down their checks like Wo-Chien and Bronzong. Salazzle's relative frailty means that slow pivots like Bellibolt and Gligar that can sponge a hit for it and bring it onto the battlefield safely are also valued. Other offensive teammates that can struggle to reliably break through Water-types like Arcanine and Scream Tail can form a solid backbone with Salazzle, as they work together to take down their shared checks. Although fast, Salazzle itself can still be revenge killed by faster threats such as Kilowattrel and priority from Arcanine and Decidueye; thus, checks to these threats such as Gastrodon, Paldean Tauros-W, and Wo-Chien all make good partners.</p>"

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<p>With Salazzle's deep utility movepool, it can act as great support Pokemon that lacks passivity thanks to its high Speed and its nearly unresisted STAB combination's damage output. Fire Blast is preferred for pure damage, but Flamethrower can be used instead for higher accuracy. Toxic + Corrosion allow Salazzle to break through bulkier Pokemon in the tier that other Pokemon simply can't like Galarian Slowbro, Qwilfish, and Gastrodon. Encore helps Salazzle take advantage of Pokemon that would otherwise wall it like Milotic, Gastrodon, and Mudsdale; however, Knock Off can be used instead to cripple item-reliant Pokemon like Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro, Gligar, and Duraludon. Tera Grass allows Salazzle to check Paldean Tauros-W and Golurk in a pinch. On the other hand, Tera Steel helps when facing Galarian Slowbro, Galarian Articuno, and Meloetta. Tera Ghost can also be used to ignore Fake Out and Extreme Speed from Ambipom and Arcanine, respectively, and in tandem with Encore, it can force them to continually do no damage to it, letting Salazzle attack freely.</p> <p>Salazzle easily handles Steel-types like Bronzong and Alolan Sandslash, so Pokemon that are checked by these walls work well alongside it like Florges, Galarian Articuno, and Grimmsnarl. If running Knock Off, Salazzle can help to chip away at opposing teams alongside entry hazard setters like Gligar, Gastrodon, and Alolan Sandslash. On top of this, Salazzle is also quite easily revenge killed by Choice Scarf users and naturally fast Pokemon like Staraptor, Flamigo, and Kilowattrel, so walls like Bellibolt and Gastrodon help it defensively.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Physically defensive Palossand is an exceptional addition to teams looking to shore up their defensive answers to the physical sweepers in the metagame, like Arcanine and Heracross, as well as most Toxtricity sets. Using its natural bulk and resilience to entry hazards, Palossand can establish its own hazards into many of the dominant physical attackers in the metagame while maintaining its health to function as a physical sponge with Shore Up. Shadow Ball allows Palossand to hit Ghost-types like Decidueye and Hoopa for solid damage, preventing them from using it as setup fodder. Sludge Bomb gives Palossand the coverage to hit Grass-types like Rotom-C and Wo-Chien, with the chance to inflict poison on them and secure valuable chip damage against switch-ins like Bombirdier, Gastrodon, and especially Wo-Chien. Scorching Sands is a STAB move that has a chance to inflict burn, which is run alongside Shadow Ball and preferred over Sludge Bomb to not accidentally inflict poison on something that it would rather burn. Similarly, Earth Power is used in conjunction with Sludge Bomb to not risk an accidental status effect from Scorching Sands. Colbur Berry can make Knock Off and other Dark-type attacks from Pokemon like Skuntank and Zoroark much easier to switch into. Rocky Helmet punishes pivoting attempts and physical attackers as a whole, wearing down foes without access to recovery like Ambipom and Staraptor. Having no item is a niche option that allows Palossand to comfortably switch into strong Poltergeists from Golurk while also reducing damage taken from Knock Off. Tera Water is used to flip the weakness to Water-type attacks into a resistance, capitalizing on its ability to get a Defense boost thanks to Water Compaction while comfortably taking on threats like Bruxish and Paldean Tauros-W. Tera Water does create a weakness to Electric, however, making matchups into Kilowattrel, Rotom-H, and Toxtricity much more difficult. Tera Dark converts weaknesses to Dark and Ghost into resistances, notably helping with the slew of strong Dark- and Ghost-types in the tier like Decidueye, Hoopa, Skuntank, and Zoroark. Tera Dark makes the matchup into wallbreakers like Flamigo, Heracross, and Paldean Tauros-W much more difficult, though.</p> <p>Palossand is a good choice for balance and bulky offense teams in need of a reliable spinblocker and Stealth Rock setter. Teammates like Florges, Scream Tail, and Wo-Chien pair well with Palossand, providing a partner that can switch into the special attackers in the tier like Goodra, Rotom-C, and Zoroark. Palossand works especially well on Spike stacking cores, with Coalossal and Alolan Sandslash providing hazard-stacking and hazard removal in one slot. Being able to spinblock opposing Coalossal is valuable, as it can be threatened out while maintaining hazards for teammates to capitalize on. Offensive pivots appreciate Palossand as a safe switch-in to threats like Heracross and Lycanroc, making Ambipom, Flamigo, and Toxtricity great supporting Pokemon that can rely on their defensive backbones to wear down their checks and counters like Bronzong, Coalossal, and Mudsdale. Florges and Zoroark appreciate Palossand for its ability to wear down physical sweepers like Arcanine and Heracross, giving them late-game sweeping potential with Calm Mind and Nasty Plot, respectively. Venusaur is a common switch-in against Palossand, so teammates like Delphox and Paldean Tauros-F are valuable to check it offensively.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Minior is a colorful setup sweeper with its decent offensive stats, unrivaled Speed once boosted, and access to one of the best setup moves in the game: Shell Smash. Minior's unique ability can make it easier to set up with its Meteor forme's higher bulk and immunity to status moves, though it can be unreliable when trying to change to base forme and sweep. With Acrobatics and Earthquake having near-perfect neutral coverage, Stone Edge offers a secondary STAB move that hits foes that resist these moves such as Rotom-H and Kilowattrel as well as dealing more damage to certain walls like Altaria and Houndstone. Alternatively, Substitute helps Minior find turns to set up, makes it harder to revenge kill, and punishes moves like Sucker Punch from Skuntank and Bombirdier. 30 HP IVs activates Minior's Shields Down after two Substitutes, allowing it to be much more self-sufficient. An Adamant nature gives Minior an easier time sweeping, as once boosted and in its base forme, Minior outspeeds the entire metagame. However, a Jolly nature makes Minior slightly less reliant on setting up, since unboosted Adamant Minior's base forme Speed ties with base 105 Speed foes like Zoroark and Pawmot and is outsped by Pokemon like Salazzle, Virizion, and Whimsicott. Furthermore, a Jolly nature means its Meteor forme after a Shell Smash no longer Speed ties with Hisuian Electrode and isn't outsped by Choice Scarf users like Flamigo and Rotom-C. Tera Flying eases Minior's matchup against walls like Mudsdale and Milotic while sweeping and is preferred if not running Stone Edge for a stronger way to hit Altaria and Rotom-H. Tera Flying also allows Minior to tank certain priority moves like Pawmot's Mach Punch and Bruxish's Aqua Jet when at 50% HP. Alternatively, Tera Ground allows Minior to break through Flying-resistant foes such as Bellibolt, Hisuian Avalugg, and Duraludon. It can also give Minior chances to set up when baiting Electric- and Rock-type moves like Bellibolt's Volt Switch, Kilowattrel's Thunderbolt, and Coalossal's Power Gem. Both of these options come at the cost of Minior's resistance to priority moves like Staraptor's Quick Attack and Arcanine's Extreme Speed.</p> <p>Minior fits well on offensive teams as a secondary sweeper, since it lacks the raw strength needed to break healthy walls and often relies on having low HP to win. Defensive walls that can tank its boosted attacks like Mudsdale, Houndstone, and Bronzong should be worn down with their checks like Decidueye and Paldean Tauros-F and special wallbreakers like Toxtricity. If not running Stone Edge, Pokemon like Rotom-H and Kilowattrel can also tank a hit, so their own checks like Tatsugiri and Duraludon can come in handy. Pokemon like Rotom-C and Scyther can also lure in many of these walls in, and while they don't do much damage, they can eventually put these threats in range for Minior. The wide array of priority move users like Skuntank, Bombirdier, Hariyama, and Paldean Tauros-W should also be accounted for, especially if not running Substitute for the former two, as they easily KO Minior in its base forme, immediately putting a stop to its sweep. Encore and Trick users like Delphox, Calm Mind Scream Tail, and Rotom-C can help Minior come in safely and get an opportunity to set up. Offensive pivots like Decidueye and Kilowattrel can give Minior setup opportunities by luring in setup bait like Altaria and Gligar.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Bruxish is a great choice for a mid-game wallbreaker or late-game cleaner because of its dynamic STAB combination, access to priority, excellent Speed tier, and exceptional coverage that is largely boosted by Strong Jaw. Choice Scarf Bruxish notably outpaces other Choice Scarf users in the tier like Rotom-C, Flamigo, and Meloetta. Flip Turn is a great momentum move, as Bruxish uses its fast pivoting abilities to allow slower teammates like Golurk to enter the field safely and wear down its checks like Bronzong, Galarian Slowbro, and Wo-Chien. Crunch hits Ghost- and Psychic-types like Bronzong, Decidueye, Galarian Slowbro, and Galarian Articuno for massive damage. Aqua Jet is a strong STAB priority option that allows Choice Scarf Bruxish to reliably revenge kill other Choice Scarf users like Staraptor and Paldean Tauros-F. Ice Fang is a strong coverage option to chunk Dragon- and Grass-types like Altaria, Goodra, and Rotom-C. Strong Jaw is an outstanding ability for Bruxish, as a lot of its attacks like Psychic Fangs, Ice Fang, and Crunch are benefitted by the large boost it provides. Dazzling is a secondary choice for ability on Bruxish and prevents priority against it, stopping Sucker Punch and Shadow Sneak from the likes of Skuntank and Decidueye, respectively, along with Extreme Speed from Curse Arcanine and Quick Attack from Scyther. While Dazzling is a solid ability and prevents Bruxish from being taken out with priority, it does miss potential rolls that Strong Jaw provides such as a 2HKO on Bronzong with Crunch, a 2HKO on Gastrodon with Psychic Fangs, and an OHKO on Altaria with Ice Fang. Tera Psychic boosts Psychic Fangs to nearly unwallable levels when combined with Strong Jaw, providing 2HKOs into Bellibolt, Galarian Slowbro, and Milotic after minimal chip. Tera Water can be run to bolster Wave Crash, Flip Turn, and Aqua Jet damage, notably giving Wave Crash the boost needed to 2HKO Goodra and OHKO Paldean Tauros-F after an Intimidate drop while also removing the weaknesses to Dark and Ghost, which is especially important on Strong Jaw sets.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Bruxish can fit on all sorts of teams, being found mainly on balance and offense as a form of Speed control and breaking power. With access to Flip Turn, VoltTurn cores with teammates like Kilowattrel, Rotom-H, and Scyther can be incredibly difficult for teams to manage throughout a game. Entry hazard stacking teams similarly use the threat of Flip Turn and strong breaking power to rack up hazard chip, appreciating support from Knock Off users like Bombirdier, Gligar, and Skuntank to remove Heavy-Duty Boots. Bombirdier is a notable teammate for Bruxish because of its access to Stealth Rock and U-turn, and it is usually easy to slot one of these on Bombirdier. Bombirdier also resists Dark- and Ghost-type attacks, so the duo has immense upside as a capable VoltTurn duo that has a lot of utility and coverage. Other teammates like Flamigo and Staraptor can help break through bulky checks to Bruxish, such as Duraludon and Wo-Chien, and can provide another mid-game breaker or late-game cleaner for teams that strive to keep offensive pressure up. To break through physical walls more efficiently, teams using Choice Scarf Bruxish can often slot a strong special attacker like Hoopa, Zoroark, or Toxtricity to support its endeavors to break teams down, with the latter two having access to pivot moves to further build off the VoltTurn structure. Bruxish's ability to threaten every Ground-type in the tier is also important for teammates like Arcanine and Salazzle, which become very threatening late-game when Ground-types are removed.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Bruxish serves as one of PU's most frightening wallbreakers thanks to its high Attack and alright Speed stat, its access to Strong Jaw, great move options with a great STAB combination, priority, pivoting moves, and coverage options. It 2HKOes a vast majority of the tier's staple walls, like Bellibolt, Mudsdale, Galarian Slowbro, and Gastrodon, with its terrifying STAB attacks. Aqua Jet is used to deal with faster weakened threats and setup sweepers, such as Choice Scarf Flamigo and Salazzle. Finally, Flip Turn lets Bruxish safely switch out of bad matchups, such as Wo-Chien and Bronzong. Tera Psychic can be used to let Psychic Fangs OHKO Pokemon like bulky Florges, and it removes Bruxish's weaknesses to the Grass- and Electric-types that litter the tier. Tera Water can be used to OHKO foes like Bronzong and Alolan Sandslash after Stealth Rock chip damage. It also removes Bruxish's Ghost and Dark weaknesses, making Pokemon like Decidueye easier to deal with.</p> <p>Due to Bruxish's pitiful defenses and rather mediocre Speed stat, it fits best on bulky balance and offense teams to make up for its lackluster hit-taking abilities. Bruxish struggles with faster or bulkier Dark-type Pokemon such as Zoroark and Wo-Chien, so it really appreciates Fighting-type Pokemon like Flamigo and Scrafty, which also provide a valuable Knock Off-resistant teammate. Defensive Ground-types like Gligar work well with Bruxish, as they remove deadly threats like Bellibolt and Choice Scarf Toxtricity, while Bruxish can deal with Pokemon that check them like Hoopa and opposing Gligar. Gastrodon is another valuable defensive Knock Off absorber if it runs Sticky Hold and can set Stealth Rock and deals well with Bruxish's counters, such as Eviolite Duraludon. Faster Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon, such as Kilowattrel and Choice Scarf Rotom-C, threaten Bruxish immensely, so teammates that resist their moves such as Rotom-H and Venusaur are great teammates, along with being more reliable checks to Paldean Tauros-W than Bruxish. In return, Bruxish can take out the Poison- and Rock-type Pokemon that threaten them such as Salazzle, Galarian Slowbro, and Coalossal. Teammates such as Choice Scarf Toxtricity and Arcanine appreciate Bruxish, as it can remove the bulky Pokemon that wall them such as Coalossal, Gligar, and Mudsdale. Thanks to Bruxish's wallbreaking ability, it makes for a great teammate for late-game sweepers and cleaners, such as Staraptor, Salazzle, and Ambipom.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Toxtricity offers the liberty to swap between the roles of a Shift Gear cleaner and Throat Spray + Boomburst wallbreaker with the same set. Very few walls can take its Punk Rock-boosted attacks after Throat Spray activates––Ghost / Ground-type Pokemon like Golurk and Palossand being the only exceptions––making the likes of Gastrodon, Coalossal, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro shoddy switch-ins at best. This threat creates setup opportunities for Toxtricity, which can then outspeed most of the metagame at +2 and clean late-game. Tera Blast Ghost is its best coverage move, nailing would-be checks like Decidueye, Golurk, Palossand, and Bronzong; importantly, the defensive benefits of Tera Ghost include more setup opportunities for Toxtricity and immunity to common priority attacks from Ambipom and Arcanine. Alternatively, Tera Normal offers a nuke of a Boomburst that outright OHKOes foes like Bellibolt and Mudsdale at +1. This comes at the cost of running the weaker Snarl to hit Ghost-types, and while Snarl offers good coverage without Terastallizing, it fails to reliably OHKO any of the metagame's Ghost-types and also makes Toxtricity completely walled by Soundproof Pokemon like Hisuian Electrode. A last alternative is Sludge Bomb, and in the same vein as Snarl, it can be a stronger option versus some walls like Wo-Chien without having to use Tera Normal Boomburst, but it fails to address some targets such as Golurk and Palossand.</p> <p>Sweepers such as Paldean Tauros-W and Decidueye alleviate some offensive tension that Toxtricity suffers from by targeting foes that could otherwise check it like Golurk, Goodra, and Gligar. Knock Off users like Skuntank and Scrafty help wear down walls like Mudsdale and Bellibolt so that they are KOed by a +1 Boomburst late-game. Specially offensive Knock Off users like Goodra and Salazzle also work for weakening special walls like Galarian Slowbro and Gastrodon; the former is in OHKO range from +1 Boomburst after Stealth Rock if it loses its Assault Vest. Toxtricity is often vulnerable to priority attackers after it takes damage when setting up, so teammates like Paldean Tauros-F and Staraptor are valid checks to the likes of Skuntank and Decidueye, respectively. This way, Toxtricity can be preserved and return the favor to these physically offensive teammates by putting pressure on physical walls like Mudsdale and Milotic.</p>"

That power, along with the opportunity to pivot with Volt Switch on the few checks Toxtricity has like Decidueye, makes Toxtricity an effective wallbreaker and pivot. Ghost-types like Golurk and Palossand are not safe switch-ins to Toxtricity given that Snarl 2HKOes them, albeit locking into Snarl can be prediction reliant. Sludge Bomb offers chances to OHKO walls like Wo-Chien and Florges, although its damage is equal to Tera Normal Boomburst and its coverage fails to nail anything notable bar Soundproof Hisuian Electrode. Due to relying heavily on prediction and Terastallization, this set sees less use and is harder to fit on teams in comparison to Toxtricity's Shift Gear set.</p> <p>One of Toxtricity's shortcomings is its frailty, so it relies on pivots such as Scyther, Staraptor, and Ambipom to get in safely. These teammates make an offensive VoltTurn core with Toxtricity, which returns the favor by positioning them through Volt Switch on some of its potential switch-ins like Decidueye and Galarian Slowbro. Dark-types like Bombirdier and Skuntank are necessary to punish opposing Ghost-types once Toxtricity is locked into Boomburst. Similarly, teammates such as Decidueye and Kilowattrel are important to defeat Ground-types like Gligar and Gastrodon. Toxtricity's wallbreaking can pave the way for specially offensive teammates like Calm Mind Scream Tail and Choice Scarf Florges to clean late-game. Spikes support from Alolan Sandslash and Qwilfish is noteworthy in supporting Toxtricity's wallbreaking, as a single layer of Spikes creates favorable chances to OHKO walls like Gastrodon and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro with +1 Tera Normal Boomburst.</p>"

Thanks to its ability, Grimmsnarl can invest fully in its bulk, allowing it to take multiple hits before fainting. Grimmsnarl's STAB combination is also difficult to switch into, as it's unresisted by the entire tier. Sucker Punch helps Grimmsnarl pick off fast frail Pokemon like Kilowattrel and Salazzle. Substitute allows it to take advantage of walls like Milotic, Gastrodon, and Bellibolt, letting it ignore status and set up freely. On top of this, it also helps Grimmsnarl scout Choice-locked Pokemon like Florges and Duraludon. Tera Steel grants it a resistance to Fairy-type attacks, as well as gaining a multitude of other resistances, notably helping Grimmsnarl versus Toxtricity's Boomburst, Staraptor's Brave Bird, and Bronzong's Heavy Slam. Similarly, Tera Poison helps Grimmsnarl take on Fairy-type attacks from Florges, but it trades Tera Steel's wide array of resistances for a resistance to common Fighting-type attacks from faster Pokemon like Heracross and Flamigo. However, it now has to deal with super effective Psychic Noise from both Scream Tail and Florges.</p> <p>Due to having to rely on Sucker Punch to hit Steel-types like Alolan Sandslash, Grimmsnarl commonly struggles against them; because of this, Grimmsnarl appreciates teammates that can pressure them like Salazzle, Delphox, and Golurk. Grimmsnarl's Substitute is easily broken by powerful wallbreakers like Paldean Tauros-F and Staraptor, or it can be ignored by Toxtricity. So, Milotic, Bellibolt, and Bronzong make for great partners, being able to check these strong offensive threats. Grimmsnarl easily takes advantage of and sets up against special attacking walls like Gastrodon and Bellibolt. In order to get Grimmsnarl in against these Pokemon, it must be paired with teammates that force these walls in and can pivot like Grafaiai and Flamigo. Grimmsnarl, due to being slow and having to rely on Sucker Punch to take care of faster threats, likes to have cleaners alongside it such as Choice Scarf users like Staraptor, Rotom-C, and Bruxish to finish up games after it's beaten the bulkier Pokemon. Grimmsnarl also struggles with sweeping early-game, so wallbreakers like Meloetta, Paldean Tauros-F, and Hariyama pair well to overwhelm shared checks such as Coalossal, Mudsdale, and Qwilfish. Scream Tail and Florges are both annoyances for Grimmsnarl, as they can both lock it into a move with Encore and Trick, respectively.

It is also the only physical Electric-type in the tier. Knock Off provides utility by removing items from Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro and Gligar while also providing coverage for Ghost-types such as Decidueye and Golurk; however, Ice Punch provides coverage for the aforementioned Decidueye, Golurk, and Gligar while also doing more damage to other Pokemon like Colbur Berry or itemless Palossand and Altaria. Pawmot has a wide variety of options in for its final moveslot; Mach Punch gives Pawmot valuable priority against weakened setup sweepers and Choice Scarf users such as Zoroark, Paldean Tauros-W, and Staraptor. Rest should be paired with Natural Cure takes advantage of Pokemon that Pawmot forces to switch out like Bombirdier and Milotic. Finally, Volt Switch allows Pawmot to pivot against Pokemon like Goodra and Rotom-H and should be run with Heavy-Duty Boots. Life Orb allows Pawmot to achieve rolls such as having a chance to 2HKO Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro with Knock Off and OHKOing Delphox with Double Shock, but Heavy-Duty Boots lets it switch in more safely. Iron Fist boosts the power of Ice Punch and Mach Punch, but Natural Cure naturally pairs well with Rest and can allow Pawmot to recover from burn and poison. It should should be used when not running Ice Punch or Mach Punch. Volt Absorb can allow Pawmot to operate as an Electric immunity for its team, but this is generally not needed, and its other abilities are more viable. Tera Electric boosts the power of Double Shock, allowing Pawmot to OHKO Skuntank and Milotic, and makes the move spammable thanks to cancelling out the type loss from Double Shock. It also provides a useful Flying resistance, which is helpful against Pokemon like Scyther and Kilowattrel.</p> <p>Pawmot finds itself on offense and balance teams looking for a strong wallbreaker that can also function as a utility Pokemon with Knock Off, pivoting, and revenge killing. Pawmot struggles to break through certain physical walls such as Bellibolt and Mudsdale, so checks to these threats like Galarian Slowbro and Decidueye make excellent partners. Pawmot appreciates entry hazard control from Pokemon like Coalossal, Altaria, and Tatsugiri due to it switching out often due to Double Shock, especially if it is running Life Orb. Coalossal and Altaria can also sponge hits from faster foes that threaten Pawmot such as Galarian Slowbro and Ambipom, while Tatsugiri can form a potent wallbreaking core with Pawmot. In turn, Pawmot takes cares of their checks such as Paldean Tauros-W and Goodra. Pawmot's ability to revenge kill Pokemon like both Paldean Tauros formes, Delphox, and Bruxish means that walls checked by these threats like Bronzong, Copperajah, and Florges are excellent partners.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Specially defensive Naclstack is a formidable defensive pivot and wall, checking many of PU's best offensive options like Arcanine, Salazzle, and Florges while being capable of absorbing attempts at status. Salt Cure accrues massive amounts of residual damage, and nothing wants to stay in and get worn down by its effect. Protect scouts attacks from Choice-locked Pokemon like Flamigo and Staraptor while racking up Salt Cure damage. Curse can be used to bolster its already excellent Defense, giving Naclstack the ability to excel in late-game situations as an impenetrable wall and counter to Curse Arcanine. Stealth Rock is an option for Naclstack, as it can use its defensive utility to establish hazards repeatedly throughout a game while freeing up a slot for teammates that prefer other options over Stealth Rock, like Spikes Gastrodon and Gligar. Tera Water is generally a good Tera type for defensive walls and works especially well for Naclstack, giving it much better matchups into the strong Fighting- and Water-types in the tier like Emboar, Flamigo, Paldean Tauros-W, and Tatsugiri. Tera Ghost similarly helps with Fighting-type attacks and can prevent attempts at Rapid Spin from Coalossal and Tatsugiri, though it comes at the expense of becoming much weaker to Knock Off and its inability to boost with Curse.</p> <p>Balance and bulky offense teams appreciate Naclstack greatly as a specially defensive wall capable of sponging hits, absorbing status, and functioning as an entry hazard setter that can get them up multiple times a game. Hazard stacking cores with teammates like Gastrodon and Gligar are incredibly efficient in wearing teams down with gradual chip damage, though they need support in the form of Knock Off from offensive teammates like Ambipom and Skuntank to help remove Heavy-Duty Boots. With Salt Cure, Naclstack can often prevent defensive walls like Bronzong, Coalossal, and Copperajah from getting too comfortable against it, allowing teammates to get momentum through forcing multiple switches. Once it is able to get a Salt Cure off, Naclstack will often force switches, and to avoid it being face-to-face with a wallbreaker like Golurk or Decidueye, it's a good idea to double switch into an offensive teammate like Staraptor and Paldean Tauros-W. These two also appreciate Naclstack for its ability to stack chip damage to the walls that may switch into Naclstack, like Mudsdale and Houndstone. Naclstack can sometimes be reliant on Tera to function as the immovable object it desires to be, so pairing it with teammates that can use their natural defensive typing well, like Decidueye, Rotom-C, and Skuntank, is important to get the most out of Naclstack.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Bellibolt is a fantastic physically defensive wall and utility pivot thanks to its decent defensive typing, great abilities in Static and Electromorphosis, reliable recovery in Slack Off, and access to useful utility moves like Volt Switch and Toxic. Toxic prevents Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Golurk from coming in freely to take advantage of Bellibolt while also putting setup sweepers such as Decidueye and Florges on a timer. Volt Switch allows Bellibolt to be an effective slow pivot and generate momentum for its team. Muddy Water can be used to directly threaten Ground-types such as Golurk, Mudsdale, and Gligar while also hitting the likes of Coalossal and Rotom-H. Parabolic Charge can be used in lieu of Volt Switch or Muddy Water, dealing damage while also functioning as a source of recovery that reduces Bellibolt's reliance on Slack Off. It should, however, only be used with the Electromorphosis ability, as it is fairly weak and unreliable without the Charge boost. Soak, while a more niche and hard-to-fit option, has benefits such as nullifying foes' STAB attacks and notably allowing Bellibolt to turn the tables on Ground-types; it can also work well in tandem with Parabolic Charge and removes the immunity to Toxic from the likes of Alolan Sandslash, Bronzong, and Galarian Slowbro, which can be invaluable in making progress against them. However, Soak is extremely niche and very hard to fit over Volt Switch or Muddy Water. Bellibolt generally prefers utilizing Static over Electromorphosis to hinder contact attackers like Arcanine, Paldean Tauros-W, and Scyther with paralysis. However, Electromorphosis can boost Bellibolt's Electric-type STAB attacks after taking a hit and works especially well when combined with Parabolic Charge. Heavy-Duty Boots is Bellibolt's preferred item, which can be useful to increase longevity against entry hazard-stacking teams. Alternatively, Rocky Helmet synergizes with Static to further punish contact attackers such as Staraptor, Paldean Tauros-W, and Ambipom. Another option is Leftovers to grant Bellibolt residual healing, reducing its reliance on Slack Off at the cost of its ability to prevent hazard chip or wear down contact attackers as effectively. Tera Water removes Bellibolt's weakness to Ground-types, allows it to better take on attackers like Arcanine and Bruxish, and also boosts the power of Muddy Water when targeting Ground-types.</p> <p>Bellibolt pairs well with frail offensive threats such as Bruxish, Flamigo, and Salazzle that appreciate its slow pivot support to get them onto the field safely. It can also form pivot cores with the aforementioned Bruxish and Flamigo as well as the likes of Scyther, which can handle Pokemon like Wo-Chien. Specially defensive walls such as Bronzong, Gastrodon, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro synergize well to handle the likes of Meloetta, Tatsugiri, and Toxtricity, respectively. Secondary physical walls such as Mudsdale, Milotic, and Galarian Slowbro can be useful to prevent Bellibolt from becoming overwhelmed by threats such as Skuntank, Paldean Tauros-W, and Flamigo. Mudsdale and Milotic can also help into setup sweepers like Scrafty and non-Taunt Grimmsnarl thanks to Roar and Haze, respectively. Powerful Ground-types such as Golurk can pressure Bellibolt, so switch-ins to these Ground-types such as Wo-Chien and Bombirdier are appreciated. Wo-Chien also helps into Nasty Plot Rotom-C and Swords Dance Decidueye. In return, Bellibolt is able to handle Pokemon like Scyther and Staraptor that it struggles with.</p>"

Sucker Punch allows Bombirdier to pick off weakened faster threats and setup sweepers such as Choice Scarf Staraptor, Delphox, and Toxtricity. Bombirdier has a wide variety of options in its final slot; Taunt allows Bombirdier to deny setup attempts from Pokemon like Arcanine and Scream Tail, hazard-setting attempts from Mudsdale and Gligar, Defog from Altaria, and recovery attempts from Pokemon like the beforementioned Altaria, Milotic, and Palossand. Stealth Rock allows Bombirdier to support its team with entry hazards and allows it to free up a moveslot for teammates like Alolan Sandslash and Gastrodon. Roost allows Bombirdier to capitalize on the switches it forces on Pokemon like Bronzong and Decidueye and recover off damage and Brave Bird recoil. U-turn or Parting Shot allows Bombirdier to safely pivot into teammates, but both moves can be hard to fit over other options. Tera Dark boosts the power of Knock Off and Sucker Punch, allowing Bombirdier to achieve rolls such as OHKOing Bronzong and Toxtricity with minimal chip and 2HKOing Altaria while also removing its weakness to Electric- and Rock-type attacks, which is valuable against Pokemon like Kilowattrel and Minior.</p> <p>Bombirdier finds itself on a wide variety of teams ranging from bulky balance to hyper offense. Although it resists Knock Off, Bombirdier appreciates fellow Dark-resistant Pokemon such as Scrafty and Paldean Tauros-F that can switch into Knock Off for it, as Bombirdier requires Heavy-Duty Boots to be an effective pivot. Bombirdier's ability to take out walls like Galarian Slowbro, Gastrodon, and Wo-Chien allows for Pokemon checked by these threats such as Calm Mind Florges, Tatsugiri, and Decidueye to become much more potent offensive threats. Bombirdier struggles with bulkier walls who can cripple it with status like Bellibolt and Coalossal, so Pokemon who can check these threats like Mudsdale, Goodra, and Tatsugiri make good partners. While it is immune to Ground-type attacks, Bombirdier should be paired with other Pokemon that resist Ground such as Decidueye and Bronzong because it cannot reliably take on Ground-types such as Gligar and Mudsdale on its own.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Houndstone is a stellar physical wall courtesy of its immense bulk with Fluffy. Its vast array of disruptive utility moves and its great typing lets it check common physical attackers such as Paldean Tauros-W, Flamigo, Staraptor, and Pawmot, as well as letting it act as an excellent spinblocker. Night Shade is Houndstone's most reliable form of making progress thanks to its fixed damage, wearing down physical setup Pokemon such as Bulk Up Paldean Tauros-W and Bulk Up Hariyama. Body Press capitalizes on Houndstone's gargantuan Defense, targeting Dark-types like Zoroark, Wo-Chien, and Scrafty as well as Steel-types like Copperajah and Duraludon. Additionally, it lets non-Will-O-Wisp variants touch Normal-types such as Staraptor and Ambipom. Houndstone's last two slots are quite versatile; Will-O-Wisp lets it cripple a large variety of physical attackers, namely Paldean Tauros-W, Flamigo, Ambipom, and Staraptor, while also punishing Ghost-types such as Golurk and Decidueye that attempt to capitalize off of Houndstone's passivity. Protect synergizes amazingly with Will-O-Wisp, wearing down foes while helping maintain longevity with Leftovers. It can also assist in scouting attacks from foes like Choice Scarf Florges and Paldean Tauros-F. Alternatively, the combination of Rest and Sleep Talk offers Houndstone a form of semi-reliable recovery, letting it capitalize on the presence of Pokemon that are unable to do very much damage to it, namely foes like Choice Scarf Flamigo and Ambipom, to heal to full health. However, the unreliable nature of Sleep Talk may leave Houndstone open to being taken advantage of by offensive Pokemon like Arcanine and Scrafty, giving them a prime opportunity to use it as setup bait. Pain Split is a niche alternative, acting as a less committal option for recovery compared to Rest, although it is more unreliable due to its reliance on foe's HP. Charm is another niche alternative option, heavily halting the momentum of physical setup sweepers such as Bulk Up Scrafty, Curse Arcanine, and Bulk Up Paldean Tauros-W. Roar similarly dissuades setup Pokemon while having more utility against special attackers and synergizing well with entry hazards. Houndstone has a solid array of viable Tera types; Tera Water turns its Fire weakness into a neutrality, which can prove vital against the likes of Arcanine and Paldean Tauros-F. Tera Fighting powers up Houndstone's Body Press, letting it 2HKO Skuntank after Stealth Rock while alleviating its weakness to Dark so it can more easily handle the likes of Skuntank and Scrafty. Tera Fairy also gives Houndstone a Dark resistance as well as a Fighting resistance, opening it up to completely wall the likes of Hariyama and Bombirdier.</p> <p>Defensive Houndstone fits best on a variety of balance and bulky offense teams as a reliable physically defensive wall. Entry hazard setters such as Bronzong, Gligar, and Gastrodon make for excellent partners, heavily appreciating Houndstone's ability to block Rapid Spin attempts while in return offering their own great utility; Bronzong's Psychic Noise further bolsters burn damage from Houndstone's Will-O-Wisp. Gligar can use Toxic to stall out and wear down foes that Houndstone may not do as well against. Additionally, Earthquake and Knock Off can threaten Fire-types such as Arcanine, Emboar, and Paldean Tauros-F that Houndstone is weak to. Bulky setup Pokemon such as Curse Arcanine, Iron Defense Bronzong, and Calm Mind Florges appreciate Houndstone burning foes that could otherwise overwhelm them, making it easier for them to find opportunities to set up and sweep. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Florges, Gastrodon, and Wo-Chien can handle the special attackers that Houndstone may otherwise struggle with such as Kilowattrel, Inteleon, and Hoopa, respectively. Scream Tail is another great defensive partner that can provide Wish support, which can open Houndstone up to more easily run Will-O-Wisp and Protect. Pokemon that can check Dark-types such as Florges, Skuntank, and Paldean Tauros-W are good partners for Houndstone, being able to switch in on Dark-type moves from the likes of Scrafty, Zoroark, and Bombirdier. In return, Florges can provide valuable Wish support, Skuntank can use useful utility moves like Knock Off and Taunt to assist Houndstone in wearing down foes, and Paldean Tauros-W can capitalize off of Dark-types for offensive momentum.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>While it faces tight competition from Decidueye and Golurk, which are both stronger, Houndstone dual functions as an effective wallbreaker and spinblocker. Fluffy is a noteworthy niche over the aforementioned Ghost-types, preventing Houndstone from being immediately ruined by moves like Knock Off and letting it trade more easily with physical attackers like Pawmot and Flamigo. Houndstone also has access to Play Rough, which hits Staraptor and Dark-types like Scrafty and Bombirdier harder than Decidueye often can, in addition to Shadow Sneak, which Golurk notably lacks. Roar prevents setup sweepers like Paldean Tauros-W, Arcanine, Scream Tail, and Dudunsparce from exploiting Houndstone or getting out of hand and spreads chip damage if entry hazards are up. Pain Split can be used instead of Roar to improve Houndstone's longevity, which bulkier teams may find more useful. Will-O-Wisp is another option that wears down walls like Wo-Chien while still punishing threats like Skuntank and slowing setup sweepers like Paldean Tauros-W down. Both options are less consistent than Roar, though, due to being predictable and having imperfect accuracy, respectively. Body Press nails Normal-types like Tera Normal Scream Tail and offers accurate coverage for Dark-types, but it's not very useful otherwise. Spell Tag allows Poltergeist to 2HKO Florges and OHKO Galarian Slowbro after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. It also turns Shadow Sneak a better revenge killing tool. Spell Tag is generally better than Choice Band, even with the added power and Houndstone's access to Trick, since it gives Houndstone more room for error against Dark-types. Either Heavy-Duty Boots or Leftovers can be used to give Houndstone more staying power, which may be desirable on bulkier teams, but it loses quite a bit of power without Spell Tag. Tera Fairy removes Houndstone's weaknesses to Dark and Ghost, allowing it to get past threats like Bombirdier and Decidueye. It also boosts Play Rough and blocks Tatsugiri's Draco Meteor, which gives Houndstone an easier time denying its Rapid Spin. Tera Ghost gives Spell Tag-boosted Poltergeist the strength to 2HKO physical walls like Bellibolt after Stealth Rock and makes up for the power Houndstone loses if it forgoes Spell Tag.</p> <p>Houndstone's great matchup against entry hazard removers like Alolan Sandslash and Scyther make it a good fit on hazard-stacking teams, though its wallbreaking potential and Fluffy-boosted bulk are valuable traits for bulky offense in general. Gastrodon is an amazing partner, blanking special Fire-types like Delphox and Salazzle and standing up to spinners that can pressure Houndstone out of switching in, such as Tatsugiri and Coalossal. Sturdier physical walls like Mudsdale and Gligar can cover Houndstone against threats like Arcanine, Bombirdier, and Paldean Tauros-F while still offering hazard support to help it push past bulky foes like Duraludon. Gligar should strongly consider not running Knock Off when pairing with Houndstone, though, since the move synergizes poorly with Poltergeist. Houndstone is virtually helpless against Normal-types like Dudunsparce and also struggles with Dark-types like Skuntank and Zoroark, which makes Fighting-types like Paldean Tauros-W and Flamigo excellent offensive teammates. In return, Houndstone offers these Pokemon some safety against revenge killers like Scyther and Ambipom, pressures physical walls like Bellibolt, and threatens Psychic-types like Galarian Slowbro and Scream Tail. Sticky Web teams love the role compression that Houndstone provides and are more than capable of punishing the spinners that do threaten it, with the best setters being Vikavolt and Smeargle.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Tatsugiri is a Nasty Plot sweeper that compresses offensive utility in its access to both Rapid Spin and Storm Drain. The former is not only a valid option for entry hazard removal but also one way that Tatsugiri may clean late-game when setting up on more passive foes like Bronzong and Coalossal. That being said, Tatsugiri is very frail, which limits its potential to set up both Nasty Plot and Rapid Spin, making it easier to revenge kill with priority and diminishes the impact of Storm Drain when Water-types like Paldean Taurus-W and Bruxish can OHKO it with their stronger coverage. Eject Pack is ran over Heavy-Duty Boots on some offensive VoltTurn teams, as the sacrifice to Tatsugiri's bulk and consistency in removing entry hazards could be worth it to preserve momentum and bring in a wallbreaker after using Draco Meteor. A Timid nature ensures Tatsugiri may revenge kill Adamant Skuntank and Bombirdier, but on teams where its revenge killing purposes are not as necessary, Tatsugiri may opt for a Modest nature, which enjoys some extra liberties like 2HKOing Decidueye with Draco Meteor. Tatsugiri's Tera typings are defensive, as they offer the strongest sweeping chances by limiting its revenge killers; Tera Fairy is generally the best, allowing Tatsugiri to wall opposing Tatsugiri and Paldean Tauros-W and resist Sucker Punch. Tera Ghost is another option to wall Paldean Tauros-W, and it also allows Tatsugiri to reliably revenge kill—or prevent the revenge kill from—Curse Arcanine. Lastly, Tera Normal is a niche option to avoid relevant Ghost-type attacks like Decidueye's Shadow Sneak and Choice Scarf Hoopa's Shadow Ball, with the minor benefit of buffing Rapid Spin.</p> <p>Tatsugiri may easily fit on a variety of teams due to its offensive utility, with a predilection for offensive structures, but it ultimately always needs careful positioning for it to get on the field due to its frailty. It will best offensively check entry hazard users like Mudsdale, Gligar, and Coalossal, so pivots like Staraptor, Scyther, and Kilowattrel are great at getting Tatsugiri in safely against these walls. Arcanine and Skuntank may lure these walls in as well, making for riskier albeit just as rewarding, positioning plays for Tatsugiri to double switch or simply come in on their Stealth Rock and Spikes. In return, these two offensive teammates put pressure on some of the specially defensive walls that Tatsugiri struggles with, like Florges and Copperajah. Fire- and Ground-types such as Paldean Tauros-F and Golurk will enjoy Tatsugiri's ability to deter Water-type attacks from walls and revenge killers alike, such as Milotic, Gastrodon, and Choice Scarf Paldean Tauros-W; use these matchups as setup opportunities for Tatsugiri. Defensive cores with walls such as Mudsdale, Galarian Slowbro, and Copperajah are good to rely on when Tatsugiri is forced out by faster revenge killers like Staraptor and Choice Scarf Florges. With Eject Pack, Tatsugiri will have a one-time switch on special walls like Copperajah and Gastrodon, so physical wallbreakers that enjoy the free switch-in like Flame Orb Heracross and Choice Band Paldean Tauros-F will make the most out of this interaction.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With its staggering Tablets of Ruin-bolstered bulk and disruptive utility options, Wo-Chien serves as a sturdy physical wall that can be difficult for teams to maneuver around. Wo-Chien's typing also provides it with multiple valuable resistances, such as Ghost, Ground, and Psychic, helping it both stave off deadly wallbreakers like Decidueye, Golurk, and Meloetta and punish opposing walls like Mudsdale and Gastrodon. On top of scouting what move Choice-locked foes like Flamigo go for, Protect maximizes the health Wo-Chien regains from Leftovers and the progress it makes with Leech Seed. Ruination consistently puts immense pressure on Pokemon looking to exploit Wo-Chien, such as Florges, Skuntank, and Coalossal, especially if they lack recovery like the latter two or have already been hit by Leech Seed. Foul Play more directly deals with physical attackers like Decidueye and Copperajah and lets Wo-Chien trade damage with setup sweepers like Zoroark and Scyther after it Terastallizes. While Heavy-Duty Boots seem appealing to protect Wo-Chien from entry hazards, especially if its team opts not to run removal, Leftovers is generally better for making Wo-Chien more durable. Tera Poison removes all of Wo-Chien's weaknesses; this notably makes it much less vulnerable to U-turn while also letting it wall the likes of Paldean Tauros-W, Skuntank, and Scrafty and punishing foes like Hoopa for using coverage. It also improves Wo-Chien's longevity by preventing it from being poisoned by moves like Bellibolt's Toxic and Gastrodon's Sludge Bomb. Wo-Chien can be tough to break after it Terastallizes, which is why it's often a team's Tera user; upon doing so, though, it becomes weak to Ground- and Psychic-type moves from foes like Golurk and Hoopa and easier to overwhelm with threats like Decidueye. Wo-Chien's massive Special Defense also makes running specially bulky sets a viable option, letting it more easily sponge attacks from Goodra and non-Sludge Bomb Toxtricity and virtually function as a mixed wall thanks to Tablets of Ruin.</p> <p>Balance teams benefit a lot from Wo-Chien's unique defensive profile and the amount of progress it can potentially force, all without being too bothered by its occasional passivity. Galarian Slowbro is an excellent teammate; on top of absorbing Toxic, Assault Vest variants stifle special sweepers like Florges and Salazzle, while physically defensive sets more reliably answer Fighting-types like Flamigo. Special walls, such as Florges, Gastrodon, and the aforementioned Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro, keep threats like Tatsugiri, Rotom-H, and Scream Tail at bay while forming robust defensive cores with Wo-Chien. Florges can also run Wish to reduce Wo-Chien's reliance on Leech Seed for recovery, while Gastrodon and Galarian Slowbro are good at wearing down nuisances like Coalossal. Entry hazard removers like Altaria and Coalossal give Wo-Chien more opportunities to switch in and help it stay healthy without needing to play predictably. Both examples deal with physical Fire-types like Paldean Tauros-F and Arcanine, respectively, and can give Wo-Chien an easier time outlasting both physical attackers and opposing walls by spreading burns. Setup sweepers like Scrafty, Paldean Tauros-F, and Grimmsnarl pose a threat to Wo-Chien, particularly if it can't Terastallize, mandating offensive teammates that can either revenge kill them or scare them out; good examples include Choice Scarf users like Florges, Bruxish, and Flamigo and tanks like Arcanine and Assault Vest Copperajah.</p>"
