  "Leafeon": {
    "overview": "<p>Leafeon is a fairly powerful wallbreaker for PU with high Attack and Speed, solid coverage options, and access to two excellent boosting moves in Z-Celebrate and Swords Dance. Leafeon's bulk and typing also give it a good matchup versus most defensive Pokemon in PU, including Jellicent, Torterra, Mudsdale, and Regirock. Its defensive presence and access to Knock Off and Synthesis make it a fairly well-rounded Pokemon, allowing it to fit on a wide variety of teams. However, Leafeon is very susceptible to status and vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards, forcing it to choose its switching somewhat carefully. Furthermore, although it's hard to counter defensively, Leafeon is easily offensively checked by most faster Pokemon and has a somewhat awkward defensive typing with a weakness to common Ice- and Flying-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Leafeon can be used on sun teams and may want to opt for a Life Orb rather than a Z-Crystal if another sweeper needs the breaking power. However, sun is an overall weak playstyle. Swords Dance Leafeon can also opt for a Yache or Lum Berry if another teammate needs to use a Z-Move, with the former allowing it to take a hit from certain Ice-types such as Cryogonal and the latter helping Leafeon to set up on status inducers such as Audino.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Leafeon can be revenge killed by a plethora of faster Pokemon, including Choice Scarf Rotom-F, Scyther, Choice Scarf Alolan Sandslash, Simisear, and Cryogonal. After a Z-Celebrate, Choice Scarf Dodrio and Simisear can still outspeed and KO Leafeon, although Dodrio requires slight chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic from the likes of Regirock and Audino can wear down Leafeon extremely quickly. Burn from foes like Jellicent completely negates Leafeon's breaking abilities. Although rarer, Thunder Wave users such as Clefairy can make Leafeon much easier to revenge kill.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Despite potentially losing its Eviolite to Knock Off, Tangela is by far the best hard counter to Leafeon. Other bulky Grass-types such as Bellossom and Lurantis can be somewhat annoying, although they will take a few turns to KO Leafeon, while Leafeon can potentially break through them with boosted Double-Edges. Ferroseed can cripple Leafeon with Toxic or Thunder Wave, although Synthesis sets can otherwise set up on it for free, and it doesn't enjoy losing its Eviolite. Victreebel and Roselia can tank any unboosted hit from Leafeon other than Breakneck Blitz and OHKO in return with Sludge Bomb.</p>",

      "Z-Celebrate": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Z-Celebrate gives Leafeon a boost to all of its stats, turning it into a fast, bulky, and powerful sweeper all at once. Knock Off hits Steel-types like Alolan Sandslash and Ferroseed, while Double-Edge is a more powerful attack versus most Grass-type checks like Victreebel, Oricorio-E, and Drampa. Synthesis allows Leafeon to use its boosted bulk to tank hits from Pokemon like Choice Scarf Primeape without getting overwhelmed by chip damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leaf Guard is the only ability compatible with Celebrate.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Depending on the matchup, Leafeon might want to function as a late-game sweeper or an early-game wallbreaker. More specifically, if facing a team with a very fast Choice Scarf user like Dodrio or Simisear, Leafeon is unlikely to ever be able to sweep and should try to get its hits in early and make use of its defensive presence. In these situations, it may also be beneficial to use Breakneck Blitz instead to catch a Grass-type check like Victreebel or Oricorio-E. However, versus teams that lack an effective revenge killer, Leafeon is an excellent sweeper once checks such as Alolan Sandslash have been worn down. Even if planning to preserve Leafeon for late-game, it can still be used earlier on to check Pokemon such as Torterraâ€”just make sure to avoid the occasional Toxic. In general, Leafeon should avoid setting up on status users such as Bronzor and Jellicent whenever possible, and you may even want to scout for options such as Thunder Wave and Toxic from Ferroseed before assuming Leafeon can set up for free. Leafeon can use the defensive boost provided by Z-Celebrate to set up on powerful physical attackers such as Hitmonchan. However, keep in mind that its special bulk is poor enough that you'll rarely be able to set up on special attackers carrying super effective coverage. Even when you can, Leafeon will still likely take more damage than it can heal off with Synthesis after the boost. Other good Pokemon to set up on include Choice-locked Pokemon such as Primeape and Alolan Sandslash and slower Pokemon that rarely carry status moves such as Torterra.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Skuntank is an excellent partner, capable of trapping nuisances like Bronzor and Choice Scarf Dodrio, pressuring Tangela, and removing Toxic Spikes for Leafeon. In return, Leafeon checks Ground-types like Torterra and Mudsdale. Stealth Rock setters like Regirock are a must, as many of Leafeon's checks are weak to Rock, including Simisear and Articuno. Regirock is also a valuable defensive partner that covers most of Leafeon's weaknesses. Leafeon likes to partner with physical wallbreakers capable of wearing down walls like Ferroseed, such as Stoutland and Crabominable. Simisear checks such as Lanturn, Ice-type checks like Alolan Sandslash, and Flying-type checks such as Carbink are strongly advisable, as Leafeon may get forced out frequently. Leafeon supports all of these Pokemon in return by checking Mudsdale and Torterra.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off has good utility in removing useful items from the likes of Bronzor and Alolan Sandslash, but Double-Edge provides higher power to threaten Grass-resistant foes like Altaria and Abomasnow. Synthesis allows Leafeon to act as a more long-term wallbreaker, capable of switching into Pokemon like Clefairy multiple times, but it can be dropped for the ability to cover nearly all of its checks at once with both offensive moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Grassium Z gives Leafeon access to Bloom Doom, a much stronger nuke capable of blowing through Pokemon like Silvally-Fairy and Musharna much more quickly. However, Normalium Z lets Leafeon put more pressure on Grass-type checks like Articuno and Skuntank with Breakneck Blitz, which it otherwise struggles more heavily with.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Leafeon primarily wants to function as an early-game wallbreaker due to both the amount of pressure it can exert after only a single turn of setup and the excellent utility of removing items from foes as early as possible. Since Leafeon is so hard to counter after a Swords Dance, opponents will likely look to pivot in frail but faster Pokemon such as Cryogonal and Dodrio as Leafeon sets up in order to force it out. Leafeon will also often face Pokemon such as Skuntank, Qwilfish, and Ferroseed, which cannot beat it one-on-one but aim to chip it with Aftermath, Rocky Helmet, and Iron Barbs. Be careful about preserving Leafeon's health, and keep in mind that it can deal non-contact damage with its Z-Move. That being said, don't be afraid to use Leafeon extremely aggressively. Versus offensive teams it rarely has much late-game utility unless it's absolutely needed to keep a threat like Torterra in check.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defensive partners like Bronzor, Jellicent, and Regirock capable of taking on the slew of Poison-, Ice-, Fire-, and Flying-types aiming to check Leafeon offensively are an absolute must. Leafeon's breaking power means that it provides good support for late-game sweepers like Omastar and Trick Room Musharna. Heal Bell users like Lanturn and Audino are worth considering, as they can allow Leafeon to more effectively check status inducers like Mudsdale and Jellicent without being permanently crippled. Lanturn is also notable because it will frequently use Volt Switch to pivot out on specially bulky Pokemon such as Clefairy, which Leafeon can take advantage of. Gurdurr is another notable partner that can threaten Steel-types like Ferroseed and Alolan Sandslash and appreciates Leafeon checking Jellicent. The pair also effectively pressures Oricorio-E and Tangela together.</p>"

Avalugg's terrible mono-Ice typing leaves it with a Stealth Rock weakness, no useful resistances, and several crippling weaknesses, while its low Special Defense stat makes it very weak to most special attackers. Additionally, Avalugg is a bad entry hazard remover, as it's extremely vulnerable to every hazard and can't beat common entry hazard setters such as Aggron and Qwilfish. It's also extremely vulnerable to poison and burns, and, thanks to its rock bottom Speed stat, it's vulnerable to Taunt from omnipresent Pokemon such as Jellicent, which can also spinblock it. Because of these facts, Avalugg faces hopeless amounts of competition as an entry hazard remover from Pokemon such as Alolan Sandslash and Skuntank, which actually fit on teams and provide far more utility than Avalugg.</p>",

  "Crabominable": {
    "overview": "<p>Crabominable boasts one of the highest Attack stats in the tier, which in tandem with its solid offensive typing, Iron Fist ability, and access to high-powered STAB moves in Close Combat and Ice Hammer gives it the ability to 2HKO a vast majority of the tier. Crabominable functions as an effective Assault Vest user due to its solid bulk, coveted resistance to Ice, and decent damage output even without investment. Because of its low Speed, Crabominable also fits solidly on Trick Room teams as a hard-hitting physical wallbreaker. Due to how hard it hits under Trick Room, revenge killing it becomes rather difficult even for teams with priority moves. However, Crabominable is pressured easily by common offensive Pokemon such as Stoutland as a result of its aforementioned low Speed, awkward defensive typing, and only decent bulk. While amazing offensively, Crabominable's typing isn't very good defensively outside of checking very specific Pokemon such as Aurorus, burdening it with weaknesses to common attacking types in Fire, Fighting, Flying, and Psychic. Crabominable faces stiff competition from other Fighting-types in the tier such as Gurdurr and Primeape and is forced to find its niche through Assault Vest or Trick Room sets rather than traditional offensive sets.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Band set with maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature can be used outside of Trick Room, but despite its higher power, it is outclassed in this role by Primeape due to the latter's higher Speed and access to U-turn. Still, it is much stronger, able to break Pokemon such as Mudsdale more easily. Pursuit can be used to trap Ghost-types such as Oricorio-G, allowing Crabominable to more freely use Close Combat, but it is not a desirable move to be locked into, and many of them are already hit hard by Ice Hammer.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Crabominable is easily pressured by common offensive Pokemon such as Dodrio and Stoutland outside of Trick Room due to its low Speed, average bulk, and poor defensive typing.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Although Crabominable is capable of forcing its way through Pokemon like Musharna, Sableye, and Qwilfish, it can only safely 2HKO them if they switch directly into it. They are each capable of taking one hit and either weakening it or crippling it with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Due to Crabominable lacking reliable recovery, residual damage taken from entry hazards, status conditions, and Life Orb leaves it worn down faster. In particular, Toxic Spikes are annoying for Crabominable to deal with, since being badly poisoned leaves it even more susceptible to priority from the likes of Hitmonchan and Kangaskhan.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake gives Crabominable a solid neutral coverage option that also doesn't trigger Rocky Helmet or Aftermath from Pokemon such as Qwilfish and Skuntank. Thunder Punch deals adequate damage to Jellicent while securing an OHKO on Swanna.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Crabominable's EVs are dedicated to maximizing its HP and special bulk, allowing it to switch into special attackers such as Aurorus, Cryogonal, and Rotom-F as best as possible. An Adamant nature serves as a jump point, enabling Crabominable to hit hard even when lacking full investment.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Crabominable can pivot into various special attackers such as Aurorus, Haunter, and Alolan Persian lacking Dream Eater in order to sponge a powerful hit for its teammates. Against such Pokemon, Crabominable is presented with a great opportunity to fire off an attack. Do be mindful about more powerful special wallbreakers such as Drampa, however, as Crabominable can only switch into certain Choice-locked moves a limited number of times and thus should not be used as a constant switch-in. Crabominable should be kept healthy if it intends to stomach an especially powerful special attack, such as a boosted Omastar's Hydro Pump or a Supersonic Skystrike from Swanna or an unboosted Oricorio-G. Crabominable can then retaliate with a powerful, potentially super effective attack or heal off damage taken with Drain Punch. Bring Crabominable in against slow, bulkier teams whenever presented with the chance, as its high power and effective STAB combination allow it to apply heavy amounts of pressure to such teams. Against more offensive teams, Crabominable should be brought in through double switches or pivots against foes that generally don't bother it such as Aurorus and Rotom-F lacking Will-O-Wisp. Prediction plays a key role when using Crabominable, as its poor Speed and exploitable weaknesses means it can easily be taken advantage of if an opponent is able to safely switch in. For example, use Earthquake in order to maximize damage output on an incoming Qwilfish. Thunder Punch can be used on a predicted Jellicent switch-in to 2HKO offensive variants or force defensive sets to use Recover. Keep Crabominable away from status moves whenever possible, as most are detrimental to its role as a specially bulky wallbreaker. Toxic puts Crabominable on a timer and reduces its ability to pivot into special attackers like Aurorus, while burns severely limit what it can break, making it unable to do adequate damage to the likes of Tangela and turning it into setup fodder for Clefairy.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Musharna, Regirock, and Spiritomb are able to pressure offensive Fighting-, Flying-, and Psychic-types like Gurdurr, Scyther, and Alolan Raichu. Entry hazard setters such as Mudsdale, Qwilfish, and Torterra allow Crabominable to wallbreak far more easily. Qwilfish can additionally cripple physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Alolan Sandslash. Pivots such as Silvally-Fairy enjoy Crabominable wearing down walls and are able to bring it in more safely whilst luring in bulkier threats such as Regirock and Mudsdale for Crabominable to take advantage of. Defoggers like Altaria and Skuntank are able to clear entry hazards off the field, which otherwise wear at Crabominable and water down its ability to pivot into special attackers. Altaria also doubles as a cleric with Heal Bell, while Skuntank can absorb Toxic Spikes and take on Musharna. Late-game sweepers such as Lycanroc, Combusken, and Dodrio highly appreciate Crabominable's ability to heavily dent bulkier foes like Mudsdale, Clefairy, and Regirock. Physically defensive walls such as Mudsdale and Torterra are able to switch into incoming attacks from various offensive threats like Aggron and Primeape looking to exploit Crabominable's mediocre physical defense.</p>"
      },
      "SubToxic": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute allows Crabominable to avoid status conditions from foes such as Audino and rack up Toxic damage more easily. It also prevents threats such as Primeape and Dodrio from revenge killing Crabominable. Drain Punch and Ice Hammer are both strong Iron Fist-boosted STAB moves that allow Crabominable to maintain a strong offensive presence despite the lack of Attack investment, notably allowing it to OHKO Victreebel even after the latter uses Strength Sap. Moreover, they provide complementary coverage, and Drain Punch somewhat mitigates the damage taken by setting a Substitute up.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Speed EVs allow Crabominable to outspeed Pokemon such as Audino and Regirock before they can cripple it with Toxic. The leftover EVs are put into HP and Special Defense, which allows Crabominable to take on threats such as Aurorus and Victreebel while also letting its Substitute tank various hits such as Jellicent's Scald and defensive Cryogonal's Hidden Power Fire or Fighting. Leftovers somewhat mitigates the damage taken from setting a Substitute up and gives it Crabominable more leeway in switching into threats like Alolan Persian. An alternative EV spread with 196 Speed EVs to outspeed defensive Lanturn can be used, to avoid getting crippled with Toxic before Crabominable can set a Substitute up. This also allows Crabominable to outspeed Jellicent and Drampa, which can use Taunt on Crabominable before it can react with Substitute or Toxic and do high damage to it with Hyper Voice, respectively. However, this takes away some of Crabominable's defensive utility and makes it harder for it to pivot into various threats.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Crabominable should mainly be used early- to mid-game to weaken defensive behemoths such as Jellicent so a teammate can get past them late-game. Its typing and solid bulk make it a very reliable switch-in to threats like Aurorus, non-Toxic Cryogonal, and Nasty Plot Alolan Persian, which allows it to set a Substitute up to pressure the opposing team or cripple an incoming check such as Jellicent with Toxic. Although it has solid bulk, be cautious about recklessly sending Crabominable in against these Pokemon; it needs to be healthy to rack up Toxic damage effectively. Instead, it greatly appreciates being brought it via U-turn and Volt Switch. Against bulkier teams with a solid defensive answer to Crabominable, it is better to cripple the switch-in and then set a Substitute up to rack up damage instead of simply attacking, which could result in a loss of momentum. Against more offensive teams with no real answers to Crabominable, setting a Substitute up against a threat that's forced out by Crabominable such as Rotom-F will allow it to wallbreak more easily and make it significantly harder to revenge kill while also easing prediction. This often leads to the opponent having to sacrifice one or multiple Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Primeape, Omastar, and Lycanroc appreciate Crabominable weakening walls such as Jellicent, Sableye, and Regirock. In return, Omastar and Lycanroc take advantage of Flying-types that threaten Crabominable, like Dodrio and Oricorio-E. U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Silvally-Fairy, Lanturn, and the aforementioned Primeape can bring Crabominable in against Pokemon like Mudsdale, Regirock, Audino, Clefairy, and Cryogonal, giving it a free opportunity to either attack, cripple a switch-in, or set a Substitute up. Silvally-Fairy can, in return, switch into Fighting-types that Crabominable invites in and use them as setup fodder, while Lanturn can switch into Fire-types that threaten Crabominable. Moreover, Lanturn's access to Heal Bell allows Crabominable to switch into Toxic and Scald users without much risk. Crabominable struggles a lot against Fighting-types like Primeape, Gurdurr, and Hitmonchan, which makes checks to these foes such as Jellicent, Musharna, and Oricorio-E necessary. Jellicent and Musharna appreciate Crabominable dealing with Dark-types like Alolan Persian, Musharna can further support Crabominable via Future Sight and Healing Wish, and Oricorio-E appreciates Crabominable weakening Regirock. All of them also invite in various special walls such as Cryogonal and Alolan Sandslash that Crabominable can beat. Specially offensive Victreebel is a good partner too, as it draws in Cryogonal and Altaria for Crabominable to take advantage of and can, in return, deal with Qwilfish and Gurdurr. Stealth Rock and Spikes users such as Mudsdale and Ferroseed are greatly appreciated, as they further pressure the opposing team in conjunction with Toxic. Regirock is an amazing partner, as it can also switch into Flying-types and physical wallbreakers such as Dodrio that threaten Crabominable. In return, Crabominable can switch into some special wallbreakers like Aurorus that threaten Regirock. Qwilfish is also a solid partner thanks to its ability to check Fighting-types like Gurdurr, and similarly to Regirock, it appreciates Crabominable's ability to switch into special wallbreakers. Rapid Spin and Defog users are appreciated, as they make Crabominable's job far easier and allow it to set more Substitutes up if needed. Altaria and Swanna are solid partners, as not only do they provide Defog support, they can also switch into Fire- and Fighting-types like Simisear, Combusken, and Gurdurr. Kabutops can also work, as it appreciates Crabominable crippling and weakening Jellicent to the point where it can't reliably spinblock against Kabutops. Lastly, Pursuit users such as Stoutland, Skuntank, and Absol are appreciated, as they ease Crabominable's job by trapping Musharna and Bronzor, and they all appreciate Crabominable weakening Pokemon like Ferroseed and Regirock.</p>"

      "Trick Room Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Hammer is Crabominable's strongest Ice-type STAB move, and it deals heavy damage to some of the tier's most reliable physical walls such as Tangela. It also decreases Crabominable's Speed, helping it outspeed opposing Crabominable and Musharna under Trick Room. Close Combat is Crabominable's strongest Fighting-type STAB move, hitting a lot of Ice-resistant Pokemon like Aggron and Lanturn for either neutral or super effective damage. Earthquake gives Crabominable the ability to KO Skuntank without triggering Aftermath, while Thunder Punch allows Crabominable to threaten Jellicent.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Brave nature and 0 IVs in Speed serve to further augment Crabominable's power while making it as slow as possible, which helps it outspeed as much as it can under Trick Room. Iron Fist is useful for increasing the power of Ice Hammer and Thunder Punch. Life Orb increases the power of all of its moves at the unfortunate cost of recoil damage per attack. Choice Band is an alternative that allows Crabominable to hit even harder without costing it health with every attack, but it comes with the drawback of locking Crabominable into one move, which can be taken advantage of by Ghost-types if it locks itself into Close Combat.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Crabominable should only be used on Trick Room teams due to its previously mentioned low Speed. It is highly advised not to switch Crabominable into moves throughout the match, as its bulk is only average, and this in combination with any residual damage, including possible Life Orb recoil, wears it down much faster. Due to how quickly Crabominable is worn down, it often makes for a really good recipient of Healing Wish from Pokemon such as Musharna. Crabominable works best as a wallbreaker under Trick Room that gives its teammates an easier time cleaning. The best ways to get Crabominable in are after something is KOed or through the use of U-turn. Observing the opposing team is important, as this will confirm whether or not Crabominable is free to spam Close Combat or if it must predict. Don't be afraid to make predictions if using the Choice Band variant, as being locked into the wrong move can completely lose all of the momentum previously obtained, which isn't good for hyper offensive teams. Crabominable should switch out as soon as Trick Room ends due to how easily common offensive Pokemon like Dodrio and Simisear deal with it outside of Trick Room.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Partners that can set up Trick Room such as Audino, Musharna, and Carbink for Crabominable are a necessity due to its role as a Trick Room wallbreaker. Healing Wish support from the aforementioned Audino and Musharna is appreciated, as Crabominable's going to be switching out and possibly taking Life Orb recoil a lot throughout the match, which racks up unwanted damage and leaves it more susceptible to priority attacks. Slow special attackers such as Exeggutor and Wishiwashi make for good partners, as they can break through Pokemon like Jellicent and Sableye for Crabominable. In return, Crabominable takes care of bulkier Steel-types and Lanturn for them, respectively. Ursaring makes for a good partner due to its ability to absorb burns for Crabominable and severely weaken Pokemon that Crabominable can only 2HKO, like defensive Jellicent.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sucker Punch gives Lycanroc a slightly stronger priority move to mildly increase the damage dealt to foes such as Choice Scarf Primeape, but is much less reliable than Accelerock and far weaker versus Alolan Persian. Toxic can also be used over a coverage move on the Swords Dance set to cripple Lycanroc's checks like Poliwrath; however, this severely hampers its main purpose as a sweeper. Alternatively, a suicide lead set of Stealth Rock, Accelerock, Taunt, and Endeavor can be run, but it faces notable competition from Omastar, which has access to Spikes as well, and is generally inferior to the Offensive Stealth Rock set. Zen Headbutt with Psychium Z gives Lycanroc a much better move versus Fighting-types like Gurdurr and Poliwrath, which can otherwise switch into it comfortably, but it forces Lycanroc to give up either coverage for Steel-types or priority for Choice Scarf users. Lastly, Life Orb or Stone Plate can be used if you have a Z-Move user elsewhere on your team, but Lycanium Z is generally a much more effective item.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types like Claydol, Mudsdale, Torterra and Golurk can come in on Lycanroc and Torterra can recover off the damage from even +2 Splintered Stormshards with Synthesis, as can Mudsdale if using RestTalk. However, the other two as well as Mudsdale without RestTalk are prone to being worn down.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types both resist Lycanroc's STAB moves and can hit back with moves that almost always OHKO, though only Gurdurr, defensive Poliwrath, and Throh can safely switch into Splintered Stormshards. Gurdurr, Hitmonchan, Poliwrath, and Choice Scarf Primeape are all fine answers to Lycanroc thanks to their ability to revenge kill Lycanroc by either outspeeding it or using a priority move.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Walls</strong>: Because Lycanroc is so reliant on its Z-Move, very bulky Pokemon that aren't weak to Stone Edge such as Jellicent, Regirock, and Tangela can check Lycanroc without its Z-Move still in play. Most of these Pokemon can tank an unboosted Splintered Stormshards with relative ease and are only threatened if they're weakened and Lycanroc finds an opportunity to set up Swords Dance and has its Z-Move available.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brick Break targets Steel-types like Aggron, Alolan Sandslash, and Ferroseed, OHKOing the former two and doing a considerable amount of damage to the latter at +2. Fire Fang is also an option that reliably OHKOes Ferroseed at +2 in addition to Alolan Sandslash so that Lycanroc is not required to spend its Z-Move. Accelerock is used to threaten the few Pokemon capable of outspeeding Lycanroc, picking off foes such as Choice Scarf Swanna and Dodrio.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Lycanium Z gives Lycanroc an incredibly powerful nuke to bust past some of its would-be checks such as Jellicent and Lurantis. Steadfast gives Lycanroc a +1 Speed boost when flinched by Kangaskhan's Fake Out.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lycanroc should be used primarily as a late-game sweeper utilizing its combination of a one-time nuke, priority, and coverage to clean up weakened teams. If the opposing team has a hard counter like Gurdurr, try to pressure and eliminate it before attempting to sweep. Lycanroc's Z-Move is fully accurate whereas Stone Edge is not, so if a sweep relies on landing Stone Edge, make sure your other moves such as Brick Break and Accelerock won't already KO a foe before using it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Strong special attackers such as Haunter and Swanna are great teammates for breaking common checks to Lycanroc like Mudsdale and Gurdurr. Checks to Fighting-type Pokemon are also useful for taking Mach Punches from the likes of Gurdurr and Hitmonchan, which are commonly used to revenge kill Lycanroc. Pokemon like Jellicent and Ferroseed are great for sponging Water- or Grass-attacks aimed at Lycanroc and can do a good job wearing down Pokemon with status or entry hazards so that Lycanroc can sweep. Finally, Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Rotom-F and can more effectively sweep late-game thanks to Lycanroc's ability to remove foes such as Oricorio-E and Cryogonal, and Rotom-F can threaten defensive behemoths that can wall Lycanroc like Mudsdale and Tangela.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Accelerock is used for threatening Pokemon capable of outspeeding Lycanroc such as Floatzel and for picking off faster foes such as Choice Scarf Swanna and Scyther. Toxic punishes bulky foes that can take Stone Edge such as Regirock, Mudsdale, Torterra, and Gastrodon by putting them on a timer. Toxic also allows Lycanroc to punish setup sweepers like Carracosta. Similarly, Taunt shuts down defensive Pokemon such as Regirock, preventing it from setting up entry hazards, while also disabling other status moves like Silvally-Fairy's Defog and Audino's Wish and Toxic.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Lycanium Z turns Stone Edge into a powerful nuke that allows Lycanroc to break through Pokemon like Alolan Sandslash that would otherwise be able to remove its entry hazards. Steadfast allows Lycanroc to gain a +1 Speed boost on a Fake Out from Kangaskhan.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lycanroc can find wallbreaking opportunities mid- to late-game against offensive and balanced teams once it has set up Stealth Rock and its checks like Gurdurr, Mudsdale, and Claydol have been either severely crippled or weakened. Wallbreaking shouldn't be Lycanroc's main priority, though; it should aim to set up Stealth Rock and check Pokemon like Simisear before it starts looking for wallbreaking opportunities. The optimal time for Lycanroc to set up Swords Dance or Stealth Rock is against a Pokemon that it threatens out like Scyther and Dodrio. However, if you expect a bulky foe like Torterra or Regirock to come in, you should use Toxic to wear it down. Lycanroc should use Accelerock to hit faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf Swanna and revenge kill a +1 Speed Jynx. Lastly, Lycanroc should try to preserve its Z-Move for a scenario where it needs to OHKO a Pokemon that Stone Edge would miss out on or when it needs to break through a Pokemon like Regirock for a teammate instead of wasting it early-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Lycanroc fits best on teams that require an offensive entry hazard setter and a way of keeping faster foes such as Simisear in check. Pokemon that appreciate entry hazard support like Silvally-Fairy, Primeape, and Kangaskhan make for good partners, as chip damage allows them to break through bulky foes more easily. Wallbreakers such as Jellicent and Drampa can aid Lycanroc in breaking down bulky Pokemon like Regirock and Sableye, while Lycanroc can break down Eelektross and Clefairy for them. Drampa is also able to pivot into Water- and Grass-type attacks from Pokemon like Ludicolo and Victreebel for Lycanroc. Lycanroc appreciates entry hazard support and completes a potent offensive core with Qwilfish. Qwilfish is also able to check Fighting-types like Hitmonchan and Gurdurr for Lycanroc and can set up Toxic Spikes to wear down foes like Regirock more easily for Lycanroc.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Lycanroc-N is able to carve a slight niche thanks to its reasonable Attack and Speed stats coupled with No Guard, which allow it to function as a passable revenge killer and offensive threat with somewhat rare access to a fully accurate Stone Edge. While not exceptional, Lycanroc-N has decent defensive stats and workable coverage moves including Fire Punch and Stomping Tantrum that allow it to pivot into certain offensive threats and handle some Rock-resistant Pokemon such as Ferroseed. However, Lycanroc-N is fairly slow for a Choice Scarf user and fails to outspeed many boosted threats or opposing Choice Scarf users, limiting it to revenge killing offensive Pokemon that don't boost their Speed such as Oricorio-G. All of its moves can be exploited by certain setup sweepers, which forces Lycanroc-N to be very careful about what attack locks itself into, and it is also weak to many forms of priority such as Gurdurr's Mach Punch and Carracosta's Aqua Jet. Lycanroc-N is also walled by many bulkier Pokemon in the tier such as Type: Null and Mudsdale.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Swords Dance set with a Jolly nature can turn Lycanroc-N into an interesting wallbreaker, especially with No Guard, but standard Lycanroc is able to do this better thanks to a great Speed tier and access to Accelerock. Lycanroc-N also has to drop one of its coverage moves because it wants to run Sucker Punch to mitigate its low Speed, which is not desirable. A Jolly nature can also be run on Choice Scarf Lycanroc-N to outspeed Choice Scarf Kabutops, but that set is somewhat rare and not worth the loss in power. A Stealth Rock lead set can be utilized, but Lycanroc has a better Speed tier and access to Accelerock, thoroughly outclassing Lycanroc-N. Choice Band can be used for a higher damage output against physical walls such as Musharna, but this set is often outclassed by other wallbreakers such as Aggron, which possess better coverage and STAB attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Lycanroc-N has trouble breaking Pokemon like Musharna and Type: Null, which can use it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Lycanroc-N has very little to break Ground-types like Gastrodon, Golurk, and Mudsdale, which are able to easily force it out. All of them have to be wary of Toxic though, which cripples them.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Lycanroc-N is unable to break most Fighting-types, as Pokemon like Gurdurr and Hitmonchan resist its STAB Stone Edge and both carry priority. Gurdurr can also switch into Toxic and benefit from it thanks to Guts.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Although Lycanroc-N has appropriate coverage moves to threaten Steel-types such as Ferroseed and Aggron, they force mind games and prevent Lycanroc-N from freely spamming Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Faster Choice Scarf users</strong>: Due to Lycanroc-N being a very slow Choice Scarf user, other Choice Scarf Pokemon like Primeape, Dodrio, and Kabutops can outspeed and revenge kill it. However, Dodrio cannot safely switch into Lycanroc-N.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Punch gives Lycanroc-N the ability to threaten Ferroseed, which walls it completely otherwise. Stomping Tantrum allows Lycanroc-N to hit Aggron and Probopass, which can take both Stone Edge and Fire Punch extremely easily. Toxic is used to cripple most physical walls, bar Steel-types, that usually switch in versus Lycanroc-N, like Gastrodon and Regirock.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature squeezes the most power out of Lycanroc-N, allowing it to 2HKO offensive Torterra variants with Fire Punch after Stealth Rock. No Guard gives Lycanroc-N a spammable STAB Stone Edge that is unable to miss.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lycanroc-N is able to act as a decent revenge killer against usually faster foes, like Alolan Raichu and Floatzel, but cannot be relied on to revenge kill Speed-boosting Pokemon like Jynx and Bellossom. It should not be used as a traditional revenge killer but rather as an offensive threat that happens to use Choice Scarf. Lycanroc-N should aim to spam Stone Edge as much as possible, as it's Lycanroc-N's strongest move, to deal with weakened or frail foes. When faced with checks such as Ferroseed and Gastrodon, be careful about locking Lycanroc-N into a weak coverage move or Toxic. Like most Choiced Pokemon, it can be an extreme momentum drain and give the opponent ample opportunity to either set up or chip the incoming teammate.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Lycanroc-N will most often see use on more offensive teams as a soft check to Fire- and Normal-types. Victreebel is able to check Grass- and Fighting-types such as Lurantis and Gurdurr for Lycanroc-N, as well as specific Water-types like Jellicent. Lycanroc-N in return soft checks Pokemon like Skuntank for Victreebel. As Lycanroc-N is not an effective revenge killer for boosted sweepers, a secondary Choice Scarf user or a strong priority user is recommended. Choice Scarf Dodrio is notable for soft checking Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Hitmonchan for Lycanroc-N, outspeeding Choice Scarf Primeape, and acting as an emergency check to Shell Smash Omastar. Lycanroc-N in return helps deal with scary foes to Dodrio like Lycanroc. Gurdurr and Hitmonchan are good partners for Lycanroc-N as Gurdurr absorbs status, such as Toxic and Will-O-Wisp, and Hitmonchan can spin entry hazards away to ensure that Lycanroc-N isn't constantly chipped whenever it switches in, while Lycanroc-N threatens certain Ghost-types like Oricorio-G and helps chip away at many physically bulky Pokemon. Strong Fire-types like Combusken appreciate fast Water-types like Swanna and Floatzel being lured in by Lycanroc-N, and also absorb Will-O-Wisp from Pokemon such as Rotom-F.</p>"

  "Shiftry": {
    "overview": "<p>Shiftry is an offensive force to be reckoned with as a result of its solid offensive typing, decent mixed attacking stats, and strong STAB options such as Knock Off, Leaf Storm, Seed Bomb, and Sucker Punch. Because of its mixed coverage, Shiftry manages to stand apart from other Dark- and Grass-types in the tier and is a massive threat to teams that are overly reliant on Pokemon such as Gurdurr, Mudsdale, and Regirock to check physical attackers. Shiftry becomes even more threatening under sun because of its ability Chlorophyll doubling its Speed, which allows it to also threaten opposing sun teams. It can also function well as an offensive user of Defog because its typing gives it the ability to threaten common entry hazard setters such as Mudsdale, Golurk and Regirock, allowing it to clear the field of entry hazards on the turn that they switch out. However, its great offensive typing curses it with weaknesses to common attack typings such as Fire, Flying, Poison, and Ice, and its poor bulk doesn't make matters much better. Although its Speed is far from terrible, Shiftry is outsped by common offensive Pokemon such as Primeape and Silvally-Fairy, and its main method of mitigating this in Sucker Punch isn't very reliable due to how it can be taken advantage of. Finally, as a purely physical wallbreaker, Shiftry faces competition from other Dark-types in the tier such as Absol and Alolan Raticate, both of which, while slower, are stronger.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A purely specially offensive or specially biased mixed set is an option, and Shiftry even has access to Nasty Plot to boost the power of those moves. Solar Beam can be used over Leaf Storm on the mixed set if Shiftry is on a sun team so that Shiftry has a more spammable Grass-type STAB attack that doesn't drop its Special Attack; however, it's fairly useless outside of sun, and it's less strong than Leaf Storm. Pickpocket can be used on the Choice Scarf set to steal the opposing Pokemon's item if Shiftry loses its Choice Scarf, which can be useful for crippling defensive Pokemon in the event that Shiftry takes a Knock Off. A Lum Berry can be used on the Swords Dance sets to let Shiftry ignore a status condition once and have a slightly easier time setting up as a result. It's noticeably weaker without the boost from Black Glasses or a Life Orb, though. Synthesis gives Shiftry a form of reliable recovery, taking advantage of the switches it can force, but it usually prefers having a move to hit Alolan Sandslash or remove entry hazards as the final move on the mixed set, and it struggles to find room for Synthesis on any other set. Furthermore, Shiftry really doesn't need recovery, as its main priority should be breaking as much as it can. Grassium Z can be used on the Swords Dance set to turn Seed Bomb into Bloom Doom, which can be nice for luring Pokemon like Skuntank and taking them out after a Swords Dance boost. Normalium Z can be used on non-Choice Scarf sets with Explosion to still hit hard and not lose Shiftry in the process. It should be noted that Breakneck Blitz is slightly less strong than Explosion, and this takes away from the surprise factor that Explosion has. Flyinium Z can be used with Hurricane to lure and KO Gurdurr and Hitmonchan, and Shiftry can do this easier with Nasty Plot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Muk and Skuntank can all deal heavy damage to Shiftry with their respective Poison-type STAB moves and don't mind Knock Off much, and Skuntank even resists both of Shiftry's STAB types. They do have to watch out for Explosion, however, boosted in power or not.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Combusken, Gurdurr, Hitmonchan, and Primeape all resist Sucker Punch and force Shiftry out due to either outspeeding it or having Mach Punch; however, none of them except for Combusken and Hitmonchan want to be brought in on Leaf Storm, Gurdurr hates losing its Eviolite to Knock Off, and none of them wants to take an Explosion. Combusken can shield itself from Explosion and obtain a Speed boost with Protect, and it resists both of Shiftry's STAB types. Primeape can generate momentum for its team by using U-turn on the turn Shiftry switches.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Kangaskhan, Primeape, Rotom-F, and Pinsir all have the power to OHKO Shiftry due to its frailty. The Choice Scarf set does deal with almost all of them, though, and when facing other sets, they have to take a Sucker Punch before they get to attack Shiftry.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: As a result of Shiftry's frailty, priority often leaves dents in it or KOs it with enough prior damage. Pokemon like Abomasnow, Gurdurr, Hitmonchan, Kangaskhan, and Zangoose all threaten Shiftry with either super effective or strong neutral priority moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is one of Shiftry's two Dark-type STAB moves, and on top of hitting a lot of Pokemon that resist Leaf Storm fairly hard, it removes the opposing Pokemon's item. This effectively cripples Pokemon reliant on their Assault Vest or Eviolite to check Shiftry and its teammates, like Eelektross, Hitmonchan, and Ferroseed. Sucker Punch is the second of Shiftry's Dark-type STAB moves. It can be used to score KOs on faster but frailer Pokemon like Alolan Raichu or Floatzel after they take a bit of damage beforehand. Do keep in mind, however, that it fails if the foe doesn't attack, which can be taken advantage of by Pokemon with reliable recovery like Swanna. Leaf Storm is Shiftry's main Grass-type STAB attack, and it can be used to hit physically defensive Pokemon like Aggron and Mawile harder than its Dark-type moves, which neither of them mind all that much. Defog can be opted for if your team lacks hazard control, which is good for more offensive teams due to the pressure Shiftry puts on common hazard setters like Regirock. Alternatively, Low Kick hits Alolan Sandslash, which could otherwise take advantage of Shiftry. Explosion gives Shiftry access to a one-time physical attack with 250 Base Power at the cost of Shiftry itself. Explosion is Shiftry's best attack against Skuntank, which resists both of Shiftry's STAB types and threatens it with Poison Jab, and Explosion also has the secondary advantage of severely weakening even some of the most physically bulky non-Normal-resistant Pokemon in the tier, such as Gurdurr.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Special Attack investment isn't necessary, as even without it, Leaf Storm hits its main targets harder than any of the physical attacks do. A Lonely nature is used to increase Shiftry's attacking power without lowering its Special Attack. A Hasty nature can be used if you wish to outspeed certain neutral-natured Pokemon such as Kangaskhan and Stoutland, though this does cause Shiftry to lose out on certain KOs. Chlorophyll doubles Shiftry's Speed under sun, making it even more threatening on and against sun-based teams. Life Orb strengthens all of Shiftry's attacks, but it comes with the downside of recoil damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Knock Off a lot early on, as it's Shiftry's most reliable STAB move and cripples defensive Pokemon like Tangela by removing Eviolite, rendering it unable to check Shiftry as effectively. If you're using Defog on Shiftry, bring it in on entry hazard setters that it threatens like Bronzor and Regirock, and Defog on the turn they switch. Sucker Punch is a great tool for revenge killing, but as mentioned before, it can be exploited by Pokemon that can recover their health or set up such as Swanna and Jynx. Exercise caution when using Explosion, as Shiftry only gets one use at the move, so refrain from using it until Shiftry is no longer required and wants to dish out one last heavy hit. Shiftry is easy to wear down due to Life Orb recoil, entry hazards, and its poor bulk, so not letting it take much or any unnecessary damage is smart, especially if it's the team's only form of entry hazard control.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fire-types like Simisear and Turtonator break through bulkier Grass-types and physical walls like Tangela for Shiftry, while Shiftry provides entry hazard removal for them and combats the Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types that threaten them such as Carbink and Lanturn. Fighting-types like Gurdurr, Hitmonchan, and Primeape place pressure on both physical walls and opposing Dark-types for Shiftry, and it pressures Psychic-types in return. Pokemon that resist Fighting such as Musharna, Swanna, and Qwilfish synergize well defensively with Shiftry, as they handle the Fighting-types that force it out, especially those with Mach Punch like Gurdurr and Hitmonchan. They appreciate how Shiftry deals with Electric- and Psychic-types like Lanturn and Alolan Raichu. Slow users of Volt Switch like Eelektross and Lanturn work to get Shiftry in as safely as possible. Each has its own benefits: Eelektross beats Pokemon like Tangela, while Lanturn can cure Shiftry of status with Heal Bell and can check Fire-types. Entry hazard setters such as Qwilfish and Mudsdale pair well with Shiftry because hazards pressure Fire-types and faster but frailer Pokemon, which can't take Shiftry's moves as well if they are up, particularly Sucker Punch. Shiftry can even keep the entry hazards up with Explosion while either severely weakening the opposing Pokemon or securing a KO. If Shiftry's on a sun team, Sunny Day users like Liepard, Regirock, and Volbeat are definitely important. Fellow sun sweepers like Simisear and Victreebel pair well with it too. Victreebel can absorb Toxic Spikes for Shiftry, which helps it remain around for longer, and Shiftry can put holes in teams and make it easier for the other sun sweepers to finish them off.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is Shiftry's main Dark-type STAB move that removes the item of the opposing Pokemon and hits a lot of Pokemon that resist Seed Bomb for neutral damage. Sucker Punch is Shiftry's secondary Dark-type STAB move, and it improves Shiftry's matchup against fast but frail Pokemon such as Alolan Raichu and Dodrio, especially after a Swords Dance. Low Kick is an option over Seed Bomb as it allows it to hit Aggron and Alolan Sandslash harder.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature helps to increase Shiftry's power and give it stronger priority, but a Jolly nature can be used to let it outspeed neutral-natured Pokemon like Adamant Skuntank. Chlorophyll doubles Shiftry's Speed under sun, letting it outspeed the entire unboosted metagame as well as some Choice Scarf users like Primeape, which makes it threatening on and against sun teams. Life Orb gives all of Shiftry's moves a bit more power, at the cost of some of its health for every attack. Black Glasses is an alternative that doesn't deal recoil damage to Shiftry and still boosts the power of Knock Off and Sucker Punch, but it doesn't give Seed Bomb a boost in power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Using Knock Off a lot early on to weaken checks and remove the items of checks is good for pressuring them and making them unable to keep Shiftry in check. Finding opportunities to set up a Swords Dance on Pokemon that Shiftry forces out like Bronzor, Gastrodon, or Sableye is ideal due to their passivity. Once Shiftry manages to use Swords Dance, it should weaken and break as much of the opposing team as it can, paving the way for its teammates to and clean up. Sucker Punch allows Shiftry to check faster but frailer Pokemon as well as setup sweepers. None of them appreciate taking a Sucker Punch, especially if Shiftry uses Swords Dance beforehand. Shiftry is really frail and doesn't like taking even resisted hits when it doesn't have to, so be sure to keep Shiftry as healthy as possible when attempting to set up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set has problems with physical walls due to a lack of mixed coverage, so good partners are Pokemon such as Simisear and Drampa that can severely weaken or KO physically defensive walls like Tangela and Alolan Persian. Primeape greatly appreciates Shiftry's ability to pressure Ghost-types like Sableye and Jellicent, and in return gives Shiftry set-up opportunities with U-turn. Similarly, Hitmonchan is able to check Ice- and Fire-types like Aurorus and Simisear for Shiftry, and can provide entry hazard removal to aid Shiftry in remaining alive for as long as it can. Skuntank resists both of Shiftry's STAB moves, so Ground- and Steel-types that can handle it like Mudsdale and Aggron are beneficial. Mudsdale in particular is notable because of its ability to check Fighting-types like Primeape, Hitmonchan and Gurdurr that Shiftry struggles with. Other Pokemon that check Fighting-types and can tank Fighting-type moves for Shiftry such as Silvally-Fairy, Musharna, Oricorio-G, and Swanna make for good partners, and Shiftry helps them in return by removing Eviolite from Pokemon such as Gurdurr, Type: Null and Ferroseed, making them easier to handle. Slower users of Volt Switch and U-turn such as Eelektross, Lanturn and Type: Null make for good partners due to their ability to get Shiftry in on some of the more passive Pokemon they tend to bait in, like Audino, opposing non-Ice Beam Lanturn, and Sableye, all of which Shiftry takes advantage of and sets up on. Shiftry likes entry hazards being up on the opposing side so that its moves are even harder to come in on, especially after a Swords Dance, so hazard setters like Metang and Qwilfish pair well with it. If Shiftry is being used on a sun team, Sunny Day users like Liepard, Regirock, and Volbeat alongside other sun sweepers are necessary. Sun sweepers like Victreebel and Leafeon benefit from Shiftry's presence because they are often able to weaken their shared checks, with one allowing the other to clean up as a result.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is Shiftry's most reliable physical STAB attack, hits Pokemon like Jynx and Oricorio-G for super effective damage, and removes the items of the opposing Pokemon, which is good for crippling defensive Pokemon. Rock Slide hits Fire- and Flying-types like Simisear and Swanna for super effective damage. Low Kick allows it to hit Aggron and Alolan Sandslash harder than anything else. Alternatively, Explosion is used for taking a huge portion of health from Pokemon that Shiftry lures in, like Skuntank and Gurdurr, as well as for generating momentum. Defog can also be used as a means of emergency hazard control in order to have a better matchup versus entry hazard stacking teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf allows Shiftry to outspeed Pokemon like Jynx, Oricorio-G, and Swanna, even with an Adamant nature, which lets Shiftry hit as hard as possible. Chlorophyll doubles Shiftry's Speed under sun, making sure Shiftry outspeeds every opposing Chlorophyll user under it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Using Knock Off a lot early on is smart, as it keeps opponents from immediately suspecting Shiftry's set. Refrain from using Rock Slide or otherwise making it obvious that you're using a Choice Scarf set until need be, as this will make the set ineffective at luring in faster threats. This set isn't very common in comparison to the other two, so take advantage of how it's unexpected by luring in the faster Pokemon that normally force Shiftry out like Simisear and Skuntank and KOing them. Shiftry serves as a solid revenge killer, as well, due to its lack of reliance on Sucker Punch for picking things off, so take advantage of Choice Scarf by taking down normally faster Pokemon like Alolan Raichu and Oricorio-G. Explosion still packs a punch despite the lack of a Life Orb boost, so use it to deal heavy damage to Pokemon like Skuntank and weakened physical walls.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Special wallbreakers like Aurorus, Drampa, and Haunter place pressure on Pokemon that Shiftry struggles with breaking, such as bulky Grass-resistant Pokemon like Tangela, Oricorio-G, and Mawile. In return, Shiftry cripples their switch-ins with Knock Off and can weaken them with Explosion, making them easier to KO. Fighting-types like Primeape appreciate Shiftry luring in and beating Flying-types and keeping out Ghost- and Psychic-types, and they beat the Dark-types that give it trouble like Alolan Raticate and Skuntank. Pokemon such as Silvally-Fairy and Musharna take on opposing Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan, while Shiftry's Explosion weakens or removes Dark- and Poison-types for them. Entry hazard setters like Ferroseed and Qwilfish make Shiftry's moves even harder to switch into, and Shiftry can keep the hazards up for longer by preventing Defog and Rapid Spin with Explosion. Qwilfish also acts as a Fighting-type check for Shiftry. Checks to Fire-types are important, as while Shiftry does outspeed them and possess good options for them, it prefers to have something to fall back on should it get locked into Leaf Blade, so Pokemon like Assault Vest Hitmonchan and Lanturn make for good partners. Checks to Ice-types are important for the same reason, so Shiftry appreciates Pokemon such as Lycanroc, Assault Vest Crabominable, and Alolan Sandslash. Shiftry also handles some of their collective weaknesses to typings like Ground, Psychic and Water. Pokemon that can easily bluff Choice Scarf sets such as Z-Lovely Kiss Jynx and Primeape pair well with Shiftry, preventing any suspicion in regard to Shiftry's set.</p>"

  "Raticate-Alola": {
    "overview": "<p>With access to Hustle and Swords Dance along with a nice offensive typing, Alolan Raticate makes a usable offensive Pokemon that can serve as a setup sweeper or wallbreaker. This allows it to do well against both offensive and defensive teams, especially if it manages to set up a Swords Dance, and it also has access to utility in the form of Knock Off. Sadly, Alolan Raticate has a mediocre Speed stat and meager defenses, which can hold it back at times when it is trying to set up and sweep, although having access to Sucker Punch helps against faster foes. While Hustle is one of the large reasons that Alolan Raticate is viable at all, the accuracy drop can also screw it over at times, making it a high-risk high-reward Pokemon. Fighting-types, which are very common in the metagame, are a huge problem for Alolan Raticate, as they can OHKO it with their priority moves if they don't already outspeed it. Furthermore, Alolan Raticate faces a lot of competition from Absol and Normal-types such as Zangoose that also have access to Swords Dance, extra coverage, and similar Attack stats without the accuracy drop of Hustle. But what sets Alolan Raticate apart from them is its access to multiple STAB options, powerful priority, and a Z-Move that makes it nearly impossible to switch into.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Quick Attack is a more reliable alternative to Sucker Punch at the cost of power and the ability to hit Ghost-types such as Oricorio-G. Alolan Raticate can be run as an all-out attacker with Pursuit or Quick Attack instead of Swords Dance. U-turn is another option, although the potential for the attack to miss, meaning that Alolan Raticate stays in, can often be less reliable than simply switching. Return can be run as Alolan Raticateâ€™s Normal-type STAB move, as it has no recoil with the setback of having a noticeably lower damage output. Crunch can replace Knock Off as Alolan Raticate's Dark-type STAB move, as it can deal more damage to Z-Crystal users such as Musharna or Colbur Berry holders such as Jellicent, along with having a stronger Z-Move, but Alolan Raticate values the utility and extra power Knock Off otherwise provides. Substitute can be used to potentially take more hits and block status conditions, but Alolan Raticate does not appreciate the HP loss and can make much better use overall of its moveslots. If you already have the Z-Crystal slot taken on your team, Life Orb is Alolan Raticateâ€™s best alternative item, boosting the power of all its moves. Lum Berry is another option, allowing Alolan Raticate to better deal with Jynx's Lovely Kiss and Colbur Berry Jellicent's Will-O-Wisp. Choice Scarf can be run with Switcheroo and U-turn to allow Alolan Raticate to lure otherwise faster Pokemon such as Pinsir, but it makes Alolan Raticate somewhat underwhelming against defensive teams and much easier for them to handle, along with not being the most reliable revenge killer due to Hustle. A similar set can be run with Choice Band but as an immediate wallbreaker, although being locked into a single move can make Alolan Raticate much easier to check even with the extra power.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan and Gurdurr OHKO Alolan Raticate with Mach Punch and can easily take either of Alolan Raticateâ€™s priority moves. Primeape outspeeds Alolan Raticate and can take a +2 Sucker Punch, OHKOing it in return with Close Combat or heavily weakening it with U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: If Alolan Raticate lacks the proper Z-Move to use against them, physically bulky Pokemon such as Gurdurr, Regirock, and Mawile can wear Alolan Raticate down with a combination of Double-Edgeâ€™s recoil and status conditions as well as use Alolan Raticate as setup fodder for Spikes or Stealth Rock. However, this can start mind games where Alolan Raticate can potentially take advantage of these turns to set up more Swords Dances.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: Bulkier Pokemon such as Regirock, Alolan Sandslash, and Colbur Berry Jellicent can take a hit and cripple Alolan Raticate with Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp, while faster Pokemon such as Jynx can outspeed it and put Alolan Raticate to sleep without fear of Sucker Punch, but it must be wary of Quick Attack.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Since Alolan Raticate is not too hard to whittle down, it is not too difficult to revenge kill with faster Pokemon such as Silvally-Fairy and Kabutops. However, Sucker Punch can threaten them if theyâ€™re weakened enough. A strong and faster priority user, such as Kangaskhan or Lycanroc, can sometimes be a safer way to take Alolan Raticate out without having to fear Sucker Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Double-Edge is a powerful Normal-type STAB move for Alolan Raticate, having recoil as its only setback. Knock Off provides a second STAB move that hits Ghost-types such as Spiritomb, Sableye, and Jellicent, which are immune to Double-Edge. It also provides the secondary effect of removing foes' items, most notably from Eviolite and Choice item users like Gurdurr and Aurorus. Sucker Punch is a decently strong STAB priority move that allows Alolan Raticate to hit faster Pokemon such as Jynx, Oricorio-G, and Alolan Raichu. Pursuit can be run over Knock Off to trap Pokemon such as Cryogonal along with the nice add-on that it can't miss if the foe switches.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Hustle boosts Alolan Raticate's Attack, letting it do as much damage as possible at the risk of missing attacks. A Jolly nature achieves notable Speed benchmarks, allowing Alolan Raticate to outspeed neutral-natured maximum Speed Skuntank as well as base 80s such as Stoutland and Shiftry. Adamant nature allows Alolan Raticate to have maximum damage output, making it easier to break through bulkier foes. Both Z-Crystals can help break through different walls; Normalium Z helps with Fairy-, Fighting-, and Dark-types such as Silvally-Fairy, Throh, and Alolan Persian, on top of having higher Base Power, while Darkinium Z helps against Ghost-, Rock-, and Steel-types such as Spiritomb, Regirock, and Aggron.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Alolan Raticate is best used mid- or late-game when all of its counters and certain walls have been weakened if not KOed. It mainly relies on Swords Dance when facing defensively oriented teams in order to break through opposing walls more easily; however, it does not need to always depend on Swords Dance to do well, as it often doesn't need the Attack boost to break through offensively oriented teams. Alolan Raticate does not always need to serve as a sweeper and can be used to support the rest of its team by breaking down foes and hitting them hard before bringing out a dedicated sweeper. Try to get Alolan Raticate onto the field against Pokemon like Sableye that can do very little damage to it in return and set up Swords Dance, as they are forced to switch out or be used as setup fodder if they try to stay in. Be wary of coverage however; While Alolan Raticate is immune to Psychic- and Ghost-type attacks, Pokemon like Musharna and Haunter are still capable of suprising Alolan Raticate with Dazzling Gleam. While the Z-Moves are mainly to help Alolan Raticate break through bulkier Pokemon, they can also be used to ensure a hit, as they ignore the accuracy drop from Hustle while still keeping the Attack boost.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Alolan Raticate is weak to Fighting-types and often has a hard time bypassing physically defensive walls like Regirock and Mawile. As a result, strong special attackers like Jellicent, Musharna and Victreebel make for great partners, taking advantage of the physically defensive walls Alolan Raticate lures in and soaking Fighting-type attacks from the likes of Primeape, Hitmonchan and Gurdurr. Musharna in particular makes for an attractive partner, with Future Sight weakening Steel-types like Aggron and luring in specially defensive walls and opposing Psychic-types that Alolan Raticate can punish, while also offering Healing Wish utility in case Alolan Raticate is heavily damaged or afflicted with status. Mudsdale is also able to check the aforementioned Fighting-types while also threatening Rock- and Steel-types like Regirock and Aggron for Alolan Raticate. Alolan Raticate appreciates entry hazards weakening opposing Pokemon into range of its strong attacks, so Stealth Rock and Spikes users like Mudsdale, Torterra and Qwilfish make for useful partners. Since Alolan Raticate can be slow at times, speed control is nice. Noteworthy teammates include Silvally-Fairy, Qwilfish, and Ferroseed. All of these Pokemon have access to Thunder Wave, allowing Alolan Raticate to outspeed otherwise faster threats. Slow pivots such as Lanturn and Eelektross can take a hit before getting Alolan Raticate on the field practically for free. Cleaners such as Choice Scarf Alolan Sandslash and Primeape benefit from Alolan Raticate's ability to break down the opponent's walls, such as Regirock and Tangela, so that they can come in late-game and clean up the match.</p>"

  "Raichu-Alola": {
    "overview": "<p>Alolan Raichu solidifies itself as one of the best setup sweepers in the PU metagame courtesy of its potent coverage options and great offensive stats, allowing it to pose a significant threat to multiple playstyles. Alolan Raichu's STAB combination and access to Focus Blast give it near-perfect coverage, allowing it to break past bulky titans like Regirock, Ferroseed, and Lanturn after a Nasty Plot boost, which, in tandem with its solid Speed tier, makes it fairly difficult to revenge kill without priority or a faster Pokemon. However, Alolan Raichu is burdened with abysmal defensive stats, which leaves it prone to numerous priority users and faster threats like Kangaskhan, Skuntank, Lycanroc, and Choice Scarf Primeape and can give it difficulty when attempting to set up or sweep late-game. Alolan Raichu is also in a popular Speed tier, as it's forced to Speed tie with Dodrio and Alolan Dugtrio. Alolan Raichu also lacks immediate firepower, which means it can struggle to break past Pokemon like Mudsdale, Gastrodon, and Metang if it finds itself in a position where it can't set up or lacks the proper Z-Move.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Z-Celebrate grants Alolan Raichu a one-time boost to all of its stats, which greatly aids in its ability to take certain priority moves and allows it to outpace would-be revenge killers like Alolan Persian and Choice Scarf Primeape. However, this set has a more difficult time against more defensive teams, as it sacrifices the use of a powerful Z-Move and either Nasty Plot or a coverage option. Choice Specs gives Alolan Raichu immediate attacking power but sacrifices its ability to switch between its coverage moves and break down walls with Nasty Plot + a Z-Move, and being Choice-locked into any one of its moves can be costly. Encore can punish the use of status or utility moves and gives Alolan Raichu a free turn of setup, though this is mostly situational, forces Alolan Raichu to drop Focus Blast, and oftentimes requires aggressive play to make full use of it. If Alolan Raichu's team already has a Z-Move user, Life Orb and Colbur Berry are alternative item choices that give it a boost in power or a way to sponge Sucker Punch. However, Z-Moves are an integral part of Alolan Raichu's wallbreaking capabilities, and its ability to muscle past bulkier teams is greatly hindered when using either option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Mudsdale, Gastrodon, and Torterra all have the capability of surviving any move that isn't a boosted Shattered Psyche and can OHKO Alolan Raichu with Earthquake in return. Claydol is especially notable, as it boasts a resistance to all of Alolan Raichu's main attacking options. Torterra is the only option here that does not fear the rare Grass Knot, however.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority</strong>: Alolan Raichu's poor bulk leaves it open to faster threats that can revenge kill it such as Lycanroc and Alolan Persian as well as Choice Scarf users like Primeape, Scyther, and Kabutops. Alolan Raichu also sports a weakness to Sucker Punch, which makes it vulnerable to users of the move like Skuntank, Kangaskhan, Absol, and Shiftry. Other priority users such as Carracosta and Abomasnow can pick off Alolan Raichu once it's weakened.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Alolan Raichu's paltry defenses limit its setup opportunities, and even weaker Pokemon like Silvally-Fairy and Qwilfish can do a considerable amount of damage to it with Multi-Attack or Liquidation prior to it setting up.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Depending on if Alolan Raichu is unable to set up Nasty Plot, has the wrong Z-Move, or has used it, it can fall short of breaking down Pokemon like Metang and Type: Null, all of which have ways of retaliating back.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psyshock is Alolan Raichu's preferred Psychic-type STAB move, as it deals extra damage to targets like Cryogonal, Lanturn, Clefairy, Audino, and Eelektross, but Psychic is also an option that deals more damage to foes such as Gurdurr and gives a slight power boost to Shattered Psyche. Focus Blast gives Alolan Raichu a tool to break past Ferroseed, and it's also an excellent way of dispatching foes like Audino, Alolan Sandslash, and Type: Null when unboosted. Substitute is another option that punishes Sucker Punch users like Skuntank and Kangaskhan while providing a temporary barrier from attacks, notably preventing Pokemon like Choice Scarf Dodrio and Primeape from revenge killing it. Grass Knot is a viable attacking option, as it gives Alolan Raichu a way of pressuring Ground-types such as Mudsdale and Golurk without needing to use Psychium Z, and it notably targets Claydol. However, replacing Focus Blast or Substitute gives Alolan Raichu no way of pressuring Ferroseed and makes the task of breaking through Pokemon like Audino much more arduous.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Psychium Z provides Alolan Raichu with a powerful STAB-boosted nuke that allows it to muscle past Pokemon like Mudsdale, Torterra, and Gastrodon at +2 while securing an OHKO on Gurdurr if running Psyshock. Alternatively, Aloraichium Z turns Thunderbolt into Stoked Sparksurfer, which is slightly stronger than Shattered Psyche against neutral targets, helps against Pokemon like Skuntank and Metang, and comes with a guaranteed paralysis chance. However, this comes at the expense of making Pokemon like Mudsdale and Gastrodon much harder to combat. Fightinium Z is another option that converts Focus Blast into All-Out Pummeling, which allows Alolan Raichu to OHKO foes such as Audino while being perfectly accurate, but boasts less overall power than Alolan Raichu's other options.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Alolan Raichu best operates mid- to late-game as a wallbreaker that can break past bulkier teams or a cleaner utilizing its solid Speed tier and well-rounded coverage. It is ill advised to attempt to clean late-game if faster Pokemon or priority users like Alolan Persian and Kangaskhan are still healthy, as they can outspeed Alolan Raichu and deny it chances of sweeping. Pokemon that pose little threat to Alolan Raichu like Oricorio-E and Scald Qwilfish as well as Pokemon forced to switch like Gurdurr and Swanna are its most ideal setup targets, as its poor bulk limits setup opportunities in other matchups. Alolan Raichu can usually forgo setting up against more offense-oriented teams once they've been weakened, as it can use its Speed and coverage moves to apply immediate pressure. Finally, keeping Alolan Raichu's Z-Move intact is important if its main priority is wallbreaking, as without Psychium Z or Fightinium Z, it can be stopped by healthy tanks like Mudsdale. Similarly, Pokemon like Torterra, Regirock, and Gastrodon have the capability to survive an unboosted Z-Move or a boosted regular attack, so Alolan Raichu should preserve its Z-Move if it intends to break past such foes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Alolan Raichu fits best on offense-oriented teams, where it can be supported via wallbreakers, entry hazards, and momentum. Pokemon like Absol, Choice Band Aggron, and Stoutland can form an offensive core with Alolan Raichu, as they're able to break through Pokemon like Metang and Type: Null, while they appreciate having defensive walls like Tangela and Regirock disposed of. Aggron and Stoutland can also threaten Pokemon that can Pursuit trap or use Sucker Punch against Alolan Raichu like Skuntank and Spiritomb, while Absol can utilize Knock Off to remove items off of bulkier foes to aid Alolan Raichu. Other offensive teammates like Omastar and Kangaskhan greatly appreciate having Pokemon like Lanturn, Poliwrath, and Gurdurr in check and are capable of threatening foes such as Type: Null in return. Alolan Raichu can struggle to break past Pokemon such as Mudsdale and Gastrodon without Psychium Z as well as Claydol even with it, so teammates like Victreebel and Abomasnow are recommended to take these Pokemon on. Victreebel and Abomasnow also appreciate Alolan Raichu's ability to keep Pokemon such as Articuno and Swanna in check. Entry hazard setters like Ferroseed and Qwilfish are excellent means of whittling down bulkier teams for Alolan Raichu to dismantle. Stealth Rock users such as Mudsdale and Regirock also provide defensive utility; both of these examples can threaten foes that can revenge kill Alolan Raichu like Skuntank, Kangaskhan, and Lycanroc while also crippling foes such as Gastrodon and opposing Mudsdale with Toxic, giving Alolan Raichu sets lacking Psychium Z more leeway. Fighting-types such as Gurdurr, Primeape, and Hitmonchan appreciate an answer to Pokemon like Oricorio-E and Jellicent and can check threats to Alolan Raichu like Kangaskhan and Lycanroc in addition to Dark-types such as Skuntank and Alolan Persian in return. Primeape also functions as a pivot that can draw in Pokemon like Jellicent, while Hitmonchan clears entry hazards from the field. Pivots like Scyther can bring Alolan Raichu into play much more safely and can draw in foes for it to take advantage of such as Regirock and Jellicent.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Alolan Sandslash fits excellently on a variety of teams thanks to its solid role compression in addition to its coveted resistances to types such as Ice, Grass, Psychic, and Flying courtesy of its Ice / Steel typing. Its role compression is further improved by access to both Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin. Alolan Sandslash also makes for a potent setup sweeper or cleaner thanks to its near-unresisted STAB combination in addition to Slush Rush, which enables it to outpace the entire unboosted metagame when under hail. Thanks to Alolan Sandslash's high physical bulk and ability to shrug off weaker attacks, revenge killing it under hail can prove to be difficult. However, its typing burdens it with two crippling 4x weaknesses to Fighting and Fire, meaning that it is very vulnerable to common Pokemon like Gurdurr and Simisear and can fall victim to Hidden Power Fighting or Fire from Pokemon it intends to check such as Oricorio-E or Victreebel. Alolan Sandslash's damage output can also prove to be rather disappointing if it hasn't used Swords Dance, which offensive sets can struggle doing because of its typing and poor special bulk. Finally, Alolan Sandslash's meager Speed tier leaves it outsped and easily revenge killed by relatively slow offensive Pokemon like Ludicolo outside of hail, and as a Choice Scarf user it fails to outpace most Speed boosting sweepers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An Adamant nature can be used over Jolly for additional firepower, but this leaves Alolan Sandslash outpaced by foes like Ludicolo outside of hail and by certain Choice Scarf users like Simisear and Primeape under hail. Lum Berry is a viable alternative that allows non-Substitute Alolan Sandslash to ignore a status condition once and have an easier time setting up against foes such as Sableye. Shadow Claw can be used with Ghostium Z to more immediately threaten Colbur Berry variants of Jellicent, but it is otherwise inferior to Knock Off. A bulkier utility set with Special Defense investment might seem appealing due to its typing letting it handle common Grass- and Flying-type special attacks. However, it is largely outclassed by Cryogonal as a defensive spinner due to its access to recovery and better defensive stats, and it struggles with Pokemon like Victreebel and Altaria that regularly run Fire coverage; The former is even capable of stalling Alolan Sandslash out with Strength Sap.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-type Attacks</strong>: Fighting-types such as Gurdurr, Hitmonchan, and Primeape can all force Alolan Sandslash out due to its 4x weakness to their STAB moves, with the former two also threatening Alolan Sandslash with Mach Punch; furthermore, both only need a little bit of prior damage to secure the OHKO. Other Pokemon with Fighting-type coverage such as Stoutland, Dodrio, and Jynx can all give Alolan Sandslash some trouble as well, and though Alolan Sandslash outspeeds all of them bar Choice Scarf Dodrio under hail, Stoutland and Gurdurr are capable of taking one hit before KOing it. However, +2 Subzero Slammer OHKOes Stoutland and KOes Gurdurr after a bit of prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Attacks</strong>: Fire-types such as Combusken and Simisear also give Alolan Sandslash issues, since they can outspeed Alolan Sandslash outside of hail and can OHKO it with Fire Blast. Fire- and Fighting-type coverage from foes such as Tangela and Victreebel can also prove rather annoying.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: Opposing weather setters such as Liepard and Volbeat are annoying for Alolan Sandslash if it is being used on a hail team, since they can set either set sun or rain in place of the hail and pivot into a faster Pokemon and revenge kill it. Both can also cripple it with Encore and Thunder Wave even under hail due to Prankster.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Alolan Sandslash's average Speed tier leaves it outsped by common offensive Pokemon such as Haunter, Oricorio-G, and Swanna outside of hail. Choice Scarf Scyther and Dodrio outspeed it even under hail and OHKO it.</p>",

      "Hail Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Iron Head allows Alolan Sandslash to hit opposing Ice-types such as Cryogonal, Rotom-F, and Abomasnow harder than any of its other moves while also being a more reliable attack to hit Fairy-types like Silvally-Fairy. Earthquake gives Alolan Sandslash coverage for foes that resist its dual STAB combination like Lanturn and Combusken and also hits Pokemon like Aggron and Qwilfish harder than any of its other attacks, while Knock Off improves its matchup against one of its most consistent defensive answers in Jellicent. Substitute makes Alolan Sandslash harder to revenge kill outside of hail, guards it from status conditions, and allows it to take advantage of passive Pokemon like Roselia by setting up on them. Substitute is an option that makes Alolan Sandslash harder to revenge kill outside of hail, guards it from status conditions, and allows it to take advantage of passive Pokemon like Ferroseed by setting up on them. However, it struggles to give up on coverage for it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature is used to outspeed Choice Scarf users such as Jynx and Primeape under hail. Icium Z turns Icicle Crash into Subzero Slammer, which can be used to break through very physically bulky Pokemon like Gastrodon at +2. Shuca Berry is an alternative that reduces the damage dealt by Ground-type attacks from Pokemon such as Kangaskhan, which prevents it from being overwhelmed by them outside of hail. If running Knock Off, Darkinium Z can be used to heavily threaten Jellicent and deal more damage than Icium Z to neutral targets like Simisear and Lanturn. Life Orb can also be used to increase Alolan Sandslash's damage output if its team already has a Z-Move user, but this does come with the drawback of recoil damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If running Substitute, Alolan Sandslash should aim to use it on Pokemon that it will force out under hail such as Oricorio-G, as this shields it from status conditions, allows it to scout, and makes setting up with Swords Dance easier. It can also use Swords Dance against these Pokemon if it is necessary to break through a bulkier foe. Swords Dance should mainly be used when up against bulkier teams, since it allows Alolan Sandslash to break through typical checks. Against more offensive teams, it may not always be necessary to do so, though it does make sweeping easier if Alolan Sandslash gets the chance to do so. It is advised to wait until very physically bulky Pokemon like defensive Jellicent and Poliwrath have been weakened or removed to begin attempting a sweep if Alolan Sandslash isn't running Substitute, as this lessens the need for it to use its Z-Move if Alolan Sandslash is running it and allows it to preserve it if Subzero Slammer is needed to break through another foe. However, Alolan Sandslash is also capable of serving as a wallbreaker that can pave the way for a teammate to sweep. Waiting for Mach Punch users such as Gurdurr to be removed is also important, since they can quickly put an end to Alolan Sandslash's late-game sweep. Avoid switching Alolan Sandslash directly in on attacks, especially special attacks, as this will reduce its longevity and make sweeping more difficult. Despite excelling under hail, Alolan Sandslash is still capable of setting up and breaking with Icium Z outside of it. Life Orb variants of Alolan Sandslash should avoid simply using attacks against teams, since they can just pivot around and let the recoil work against it until it can be picked off by a priority move. Use the fact that it can be rather difficult to discern what item Alolan Sandslash is holding to your advantage by setting up on Pokemon like Kangaskhan, as they are forced out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hail setters such as Abomasnow and Aurorus are indispensable teammates, as Slush Rush is one of the main things that make Alolan Sandslash as threatening as it is. Both can wallbreak for Alolan Sandslash, with the latter also being able to potentially provide Stealth Rock support and generate free setup turns with Encore, while Alolan Sandslash can break through specially defensive Pokemon like Clefairy. Since Fighting-types threaten Alolan Sandslash with strong, 4x super effective attacks, checks to them are a necessity; Pokemon such as Musharna, Silvally-Fairy, and Swanna perform this role well. Checks to Fire-types are also important for the same reason, so Pokemon such as Silvally-Dragon and Lanturn are good teammates, and both are capable of bringing Alolan Sandslash in safely with Parting Shot and Volt Switch, respectively. Fighting-types like Gurdurr appreciate Alolan Sandslash taking care of both their defensive and offensive checks like Qwilfish and Oricorio-E and can have an easier time sweeping late-game because of this. Special wallbreakers such as the two previously mentioned hail setters, Haunter, and Simisear are appreciated due to their ability to either heavily pressure or outright KO most physical walls that Alolan Sandslash has problems bypassing. In return, Alolan Sandslash can handle specially bulky Pokemon like Audino and Carbink.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is all-around good coverage, dealing super effective damage to Pokemon like Aggron, Simisear, Qwilfish, and opposing Alolan Sandslash that resist Alolan Sandslash's STAB attacks. Knock Off can be run over Rapid Spin to cripple common switch-ins to Alolan Sandslash such as Gurdurr, Bronzor, and Ferroseed, removing their vital items. However, this should only be done if the team has a different source of entry hazard control.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Slush Rush is the best ability on Alolan Sandslash, allowing it to outspeed every Pokemon in the tier under hail.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Alolan Sandslash's main role is to act as a revenge killer, picking off faster threats such as Swords Dance Dodrio and Lycanroc using its STAB attacks. Alolan Sandslash has a large number of resistances that it ought to use frequently to pivot into foes such as Aurorus and Victreebel. While this is not risk free, and Alolan Sandslash can be caught by super effective coverage, it is still critical to use Alolan Sandslash very offensively. If opting for Rapid Spin, Alolan Sandslash can be brought in against a passive Pokemon like Audino or Clefairy to remove entry hazards, improving the longevity of its teammates. Rapid Spin can still be a fairly risky move to lock Alolan Sandslash into, as it can be taken advantage of by common setup sweepers and Ghost-types such as Carracosta and Jellicent.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Alolan Sandslash primarily fits on balance teams looking for a good source of role compression, functioning as a revenge killer / way of keeping faster foes in check, entry hazard removal, and an Ice-type check all in one. Choice Scarf Alolan Sandslash is well received by Spikes stacking teams, which appreciate the fast Rapid Spin Alolan Sandslash offers and the fact it doesn't remove its team's entry hazards like a Defogger would. Qwilfish is an ideal partner, offering a Fighting and Fire resistance. Due to Alolan Sandslash's 4x weakness to Fighting-type moves, Fighting-types checks are often a necessity when using it. Silvally-Fairy is another good partner that can take on Hitmonchan and Gurdurr, switching into their priority moves that would stop Alolan Sandslash in its tracks. Silvally-Fairy can also run Defog if you're looking to run Knock Off on Alolan Sandslash instead. Musharna is another good partner. Not only does it check Fighting-types, but Choice Scarf Alolan Sandslash can make good use of Future Sight support, as it is an effective way to break through Gurdurr and cripple bulky Water-types such as Carracosta. Other solid Fighting-type checks include Victreebel and Oricorio-E. Victreebel breaks the physically defensive Pokemon that Alolan Sandslash struggles to break through like Regirock and Alolan Persian, and Oricorio-E provides a Ground immunity; in return, Alolan Sandslash offers both an Ice-type check. Alolan Sandslash is also vulnerable to Fire-type Pokemon like Simisear and Combusken, so partners such as Lanturn and Jellicent that can hard switch into them most of the time are recommended. If Alolan Sandslash opts for Knock Off, it can lure in and cripple Eviolite-reliant Pokemon such as Type: Null and Tangela. This is greatly beneficial to setup sweepers such as Lycanroc and other physical wallbreakers such as Kangaskhan and Torterra. While Alolan Sandslash outspeeds most of the unboosted tier, it is not good at revenge killing Speed-boosting setup sweepers such as Combusken and Omastar. Priority users such as Hitmonchan and faster Choice Scarf users such as Primeape can help cover these threats. Ludicolo is a strong offensive partner, as it threatens Jellicent and Regirock, while Alolan Sandslash can check hail setters such as Aurorus and Poison-types like Victreebel.</p>"

      "Offensive Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin clears entry hazards from Alolan Sandslash's side of the field, which can prove useful for maintaining the longevity of its teammates without compromising any potential entry hazards that its team may set. Alternatively, Stealth Rock can be used to pressure opposing teams by wearing foes down every time they switch in. Knock Off cripples bulkier Pokemon that are quick to switch in on Alolan Sandslash such as Regirock and Gurdurr by removing their item, which may prove useful for supporting a teammate. Iron Head threatens to hit certain Fairy- and Rock-types such as Clefairy and Regirock harder than Icicle Crash. Earthquake gives Alolan Sandslash the ability to threaten foes like Qwilfish, Aggron, and Kabutops, all of which would otherwise switch in with few issues aside from taking a Knock Off.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Slush Rush doubles Alolan Sandslash's Speed under hail, which allows it to then outpace the entire unboosted metagame and pose a threat to opposing hail teams. Shuca Berry is the preferred item, since it gives Alolan Sandslash an easier time setting up or removing entry hazards against foes with Ground-type attacks such as Torterra, Kangaskhan, and opposing Alolan Sandslash as well as against Stealth Rock setters such as Regirock and Golurk. Leftovers can be used instead to prevent Alolan Sandslash from being worn down by entry hazards by granting it a form of passive recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Alolan Sandslash should capitalize on its decently broad coverage, immunity to Toxic Spikes, and advantageous matchup against common Stealth Rock setters, entry hazard removers, and spinblockers by either setting or removing entry hazards on the turn that the aforementioned Pokemon switch out. Because it is holding a Shuca Berry, Alolan Sandslash is also capable of setting Stealth Rock against foes that are reliant on Ground-types attacks to KO it such as Kangaskhan. Knock Off should also be used a lot early-game, since it cripples defensive Pokemon as well as bulkier Pokemon that can otherwise switch in with no qualms like Gurdurr. Switching in on stronger, neutral attacks is ill advised, especially if Alolan Sandslash is a team's only means of entry hazard removal, as this will wear it down faster and leave it incapable of supporting its team as effectively. However, Alolan Sandslash can switch in on Pokemon like physical Skuntank fairly well and use the following turn to its advantage by either setting Stealth Rock or clearing its side of the field. If the opposing team has a hail setter, preserving Alolan Sandslash may prove to be a good idea, since it is still capable of cleaning late-game due to its decent Attack stat and Slush Rush. Be sure to scout for Fire-type coverage from Pokemon that Alolan Sandslash can otherwise switch into, such as Silvally-Fairy and Skuntank, as they will either heavily damage or OHKO it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers that appreciate the removal of entry hazards or the potential setting of Stealth Rock like Oricorio-G and Drampa are good partners, since they can break through physically bulky Pokemon that Alolan Sandslash has issues with such as Gurdurr and Gastrodon. Oricorio-G can also offensively check Fighting-types for Alolan Sandslash, appreciates Pokemon like Lanturn and Probopass being worn down, and can pivot around with U-turn depending on the set. Checks to Fighting-types are very important due to them threatening Alolan Sandslash with 4x super effective STAB moves, so teammates such as Sableye and Oricorio-E are appreciated. Similarly, checks to Fire-types such as Lanturn and Floatzel are important due to Alolan Sandslash's 4x weakness to their STAB attacks. Note that Floatzel is more of an offensive option. Since Alolan Sandslash has issues with switching directly in on attacks, it appreciates pivots like Eelektross and the previously mentioned Lanturn getting it in for free against Pokemon that they bait in such as Audino. In return, Alolan Sandslash can prevent the two from being worn down too fast by getting rid of entry hazards. Alolan Sandslash can take advantage of opposing Ice-types like Aurorus and non-Focus Blast Jynx, so teammates that are vulnerable to Ice-type attacks such as Victreebel and Oricorio-G appreciate having Alolan Sandslash to fall back on. Alolan Sandslash can also take advantage of the hail that the former sets due to Slush Rush.</p>"

  "Clefairy": {
    "overview": "<p>As a result of Clefairyâ€™s solid Eviolite-augmented bulk and access to reliable recovery in Soft-Boiled, Clefairy is capable of functioning as an effective check to many threatening special attackers, such as Rotom-F and Silvally-Dragon. Clefairy also has access to a stellar defensive ability in Magic Guard, which blocks all forms of passive damage, making it immune to entry hazards and allowing it to act as a status absorber, which is particularly useful for Calm Mind sets. On top of this, Clefairy boasts an amazing support movepool, with moves such as Knock Off, Stealth Rock, and Thunder Wave in its arsenal, making Clefairy one of few Pokemon in the tier to have both Stealth Rock and recovery. Unfortunately, Clefairy is heavily reliant on its Eviolite to check most special attackers due to its otherwise below-average bulk, making it vulnerable to Knock Off and thus shaky as a Dark-type check. Even with its Eviolite intact, Clefairy is unfortunately unable to reliably switch into many of the stronger special attackers in the tier such as Aurorus, Jellicent, and Drampa, and struggles against strong physical attackers such as Stoutland and Golurk as a result of its poor physical bulk. In addition, Clefairy's passive nature and Fairy-typing unfortunately leaves it helpless against a variety of threatening wallbreakers including Victreebel and Aggron, and often gives these Pokemon free entry. As a result, Clefairy is largely restricted to bulkier, more defensive teams, where these weaknesses can be patched up.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Encore can be used to prevent Pokemon such as Oricorio-G from freely setting up on Clefairy or to lock more passive Pokemon into their support moves. Healing Wish gives one of Clefairy's teammates a second chance at walling, wallbreaking, or sweeping, but Clefairy has trouble finding a slot for it, and this goes against Clefairy's primary use as long-term utility. Wish can be used to support teammates, but Clefairy prefers having access to one-turn recovery so that it can consistently switch in on attacks. Furthermore, Audino gives it competition as a Wish passer, since Audino's much higher HP stat allows it to pass bigger Wishes, and Clefairy doesn't appreciate dropping a move for Protect. One of either Fire Blast or Flamethrower may seem appealing so that Clefairy can hit Steel-types like Alolan Sandslash for super effective damage, but they're both weak coming off of Clefairy's low Special Attack stat and have very few targets. Magic Coat can be used to block entry hazards and Taunt from Pokemon such as Oricorio-E. Heal Bell can be used to cure the entire team of any status conditions, with Magic Guard giving it a niche advantage in this role over Audino. It does have some issues finding room for these options, however.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Aggron, Alolan Sandslash, and Alolan Dugtrio pretty much wall Clefairy if it lacks Seismic Toss and easily KO Clefairy with their respective STAB attacks, and Seismic Toss isn't even really that helpful against them. This is made worse by the latter two's immunity to Thunder Wave and their collective immunity to Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Victreebel and physical Skuntank really only fear Thunder Wave from Clefairy, and have no problem dealing with Clefairy with their respective STAB attacks. Skuntank can also use Taunt against it, preventing Clefairy from healing itself or supporting its team.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Pokemon such as Jellicent and Oricorio-E completely shut Clefairy down with Taunt, preventing it from doing much of anything, which is especially bad if Clefairy's low on HP. Simisear can also run Taunt, which prevents Clefairy from checking it as well.</p> <p><strong>Loss of Eviolite</strong>: Without its Eviolite to increase Clefairy's defenses, its bulk is fairly underwhelming, and it cannot reliably switch in on stronger attackers should it take a Knock Off or get its Eviolite taken by Trick or Switcheroo from Pokemon like Rotom-F and Jynx.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Numerous physical attackers such as Kangaskhan, Stoutland, and Aggron can very easily muscle through Clefairy even with its Eviolite intact due to its lower physical bulk.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind increases Clefairy's Special Attack and Special Defense, which gives it an easier time taking special attacks from Pokemon such as Aurorus and Ludicolo and makes Moonblast harder to switch into. Soft-Boiled gives Clefairy the ability to regain any lost HP, allowing it to continuously switch into special attackers like Swanna and Rotom-F throughout the match. Thunder Wave can be used instead of Toxic to cripple checks like Victreebel and Alolan Sandslash as well as give Clefairy an easier time setting up against Pokemon like Jellicent. Thunder Wave also supports Clefairy's team by providing speed control. Knock Off is another alternative that cripples Pokemon that are reliant on their item for either bulk or longevity such as opposing Clefairy, Type: Null, and Regirock as well as Choice Specs users like Aurorus and Jellicent. Knock Off also allows Clefairy to scout for Z-Crystals. Seismic Toss is another option that can be useful for preserving Moonblast's PP against Pokemon like Alolan Sandslash and Aggron. Toxic can also be used to put opposing Pokemon on timers to give Clefairy an easier time KOing them with Moonblast.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An alternative EV spread with maximum investment in HP and Defense using a Relaxed nature can be used in order to give Clefairy an easier time taking hits from Pokemon like physical Skuntank that become rather annoying to take down due to Calm Mind increasing its Special Defense, though Clefairy is outclassed as a physical wall by Pokemon like Tangela due to its Defense being rather lackluster even with investment. Furthermore, this leaves Clefairy more vulnerable to stronger special attackers like Drampa, which 2HKOes it with Hyper Voice. Either speed-reducing nature and 0 Speed IVs minimize the damage that Clefairy takes from Ferroseed's Gyro Ball. Magic Guard blocks all forms of residual damage, including hail from Aurorus, which gives Clefairy an easier time switching into strong special attacks if entry hazards are up. Magic Guard also allows Clefairy to avoid being damaged by status conditions.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Clefairy should prioritize setting up Stealth Rock or crippling foes with one of either Thunder Wave or Knock Off early-game, as it is unsafe to set up Calm Mind before threats that can take out Clefairy like Victreebel and Aggron have been removed. Late-game, once these physical attackers are gone, Clefairy can safely use Calm Mind, as there won't be much that can pressure it out of setting up and sweeping by this point. Against more defensive teams that can't pressure Clefairy offensively, however, it has more opportunities to set up. Clefairy finds setting up against stall teams much easier due to Magic Guard preventing damage from Toxic and their inability to effectively pressure it. Clefairy should primarily switch into special attackers, since they more than likely won't be doing much damage to it and can give it a chance to set up. Because of Magic Guard nullifying passive damage, use Clefairy as a status absorber for teams that are vulnerable to moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Toxic from Pokemon like Regirock and Poliwrath. Clefairy should mainly set up on passive Pokemon such as Tangela or Regirock. Be cautious of Knock Off, as even though Clefairy resists it, it loses quite a bit of its bulk and is unable to reliably switch into stronger special attackers like Choice Specs Drampa if it loses its Eviolite. Scouting for Taunt from foes such as Oricorio-E and Jellicent is important, since they can take Clefairy by surprise, prevent it from recovering, and KO it if it has been weakened enough.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Balance teams appreciate the solid role compression that Clefairy provides, since it can set up Stealth Rock while also serving as a wincon against opposing balance and stall teams. Jellicent is a great partner for Clefairy due to its ability to check and cripple most physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp, most notably physical Skuntank, and can create setup opportunities for Clefairy with Taunt. In a similar vein, other physically bulky Pokemon such as Mudsdale, Tangela, Sableye, and Ferroseed pair well with Clefairy, since they are capable of taking on many of the physical attackers that threaten Clefairy while it handles stronger Ice- and Fire-types in return. Due to its weaknesses to Poison and Steel, Clefairy appreciates being paired with Ground-types like Gastrodon and Mudsdale due to their ability to check foes with these typings and also wear down specially bulky Pokemon like Encore Audino with Toxic. Wallbreakers such as Aggron, Simisear, and Kangaskhan are appreciated, since they heavily pressure Pokemon like Aggron and Skuntank for Clefairy. In return, Clefairy can switch into status conditions and potentially weaken or slow down their offensive checks with Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Soft-Boiled gives Clefairy the ability to keep itself healthy, allowing it to check special attackers consistently throughout the match. Seismic Toss gives Clefairy a way of dealing a fixed amount of damage to all targets barring Ghost-types, including some of Clefairy's checks such as Alolan Sandslash. Moonblast, on the other hand, gives Clefairy a STAB option that deals super effective damage to Dark-types such as Absol and Spiritomb, as well as Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan and Primeape. Should the team already have a Stealth Rock user, Knock Off should be used for crippling Assault Vest and Eviolite users, such as Eelektross, opposing Clefairy, and Type: Null; Pokemon reliant on their Leftovers or Black Sludge for recovery such as Regirock, Alolan Sandslash, and Skuntank; and Choice-locked wallbreakers such as Stoutland by removing their item. Knock Off also allows Clefairy to scout for Z-Moves. Toxic is used to cripple opposing Pokemon by putting them on timers, preventing Pokemon such as Musharna from freely setting up on Clefairy, and gives it the ability to wear down Pokemon with reliable recovery that aren't weak to Moonblast without resorting to PP stalling. Alternatively, Thunder Wave can be opted for to slow opposing Pokemon down and provide speed control.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Sassy nature and 0 Speed IVs minimize the damage Clefairy takes from Ferroseed's Gyro Ball. Magic Guard is Clefairy's only viable ability, and it prevents Clefairy from taking any damage from entry hazards, status conditions, and weather, giving it a much easier time switching into special attacks and allowing it to absorb status.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Clefairy should primarily pivot into special attackers such as Silvally-Dragon and Swanna. Take advantage of how Clefairy forces these Pokemon out by setting up Stealth Rock or firing off one of Toxic and Thunder Wave on the turn that they switch, as this applies immediate pressure. Use Soft-Boiled once Clefairy begins taking damage to keep it consistently healthy, allowing it to better take on special attackers. Soft-Boiled can also be used to stall out attackers once they've been put on a timer by Toxic. Clefairy should prioritize remaining healthy rather than crippling a Pokemon that's switching out if it has already taken prior damage, as this leaves it unable to switch in on Pokemon like Choice Scarf Aurorus as reliably. Because of Magic Guard, Clefairy can also act as a status absorber for teams, so switch it in on Toxic or Will-O-Wisp from Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Spiritomb to avoid letting another member get crippled. Magic Guard and Clefairy's aforementioned coverage options allow Clefairy to serve as a good pivot against stall teams due to Clefairy not being affected by chip damage from status and entry hazards. Due to Clefairy's susceptibility to Knock Off, Clefairy also is not a reliable Dark-type answer and should generally not be switched in on Dark-types or Pokemon that commonly run Knock Off either.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Physically defensive Pokemon such as Ferroseed, Regirock, Jellicent, and Mudsdale can handle stronger physical attackers for Clefairy, while Clefairy can switch into special attackers that threaten them such as Aurorus and Articuno. Additionally, Jellicent and Sableye both have access to Will-O-Wisp, which is useful for weakening physical attackers such as Aggron. Checks to Poison- and Steel-types are important, since they are immune to Toxic, resist Moonblast, and can still KO Clefairy even if they take a Knock Off, so Pokemon such as Ferroseed, Mudsdale, and Jellicent make for good partners. Wallbreakers that can take advantage of opposing Pokemon being slowed down by Thunder Wave such as Aggron and Crabominable are good partners, as Clefairy eases the matchup against their offensive checks. In return, these wallbreakers break through Poison- and Steel-types that Clefairy struggles with. Slower wallbreakers with better physical bulk such as Aggron appreciate having Clefairy to fall back on when a special attacker such as Alolan Raichu switches in to revenge kill them. Clefairy also fits well on stall because of its solid defensive capabilities, and Pokemon that are most common on stall teams such as Audino and Articuno can benefit from Clefairy soaking up status.</p>"

This relegates it to being an offensive Stealth Rock user that can pressure Defog users with decent neutral coverage. However, Wigglytuff's middling defenses, mediocre firepower, and horrendous Speed make using it difficult.

Its best set is Substitute + Toxic, which allows it to play around Sucker Punch, forces out Pokemon like Lanturn and Simisear, and cripples checks like Gastrodon and Poliwrath with Toxic. Alolan Dugtrio's STAB attacks and coverage allow it to hit the tier for neutral damage, and its Speed tier allows it to outspeed top threats like Cryogonal as well as Speed tie with Dodrio and Alolan Raichu. However, keep in mind that its Attack stat is mediocre, which means it struggles to break bulky Pokemon like Tangela. Lastly, be aware that Alolan Dugtrio has terrible defenses and struggles to switch in on even resisted attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stone Edge can be used over Pursuit on Alolan Dugtrio's All-out Attacker set to hit Flying-type Pokemon such as Swanna that would otherwise wall it. Choice Scarf can also be used if Alolan Dugtrio's team needs a solid way of revenge killing fast threats like Jynx and Primeape; however, keep in mind that Choice Scarf Alolan Dugtrio is very weak. Additionally, Choice Band can be used over Life Orb for more power; however, being Choice-locked can be costly for Alolan Dugtrio, as it may potentially give an opposing Pokemon a free setup opportunity. Groundium Z with Earthquake can be used to attempt to break past bulky Pokemon such as Gastrodon with prior damage; however, the consistent damage output boost from Life Orb is preferred. Rockium Z allows Alolan Dugtrio to use Z-Sandstorm to give it +1 Speed and boost its Ground-, Steel-, and Rock-type moves with Sand Force. Darkinium Z can be used with Memento to give new life to a sweeper of your choice by easing its setup and healing it to 100% HP at the same time. The drawback of using Z-Memento is giving up Leftovers recovery on its Substitute set or losing attack power on Alolan Dugtrio's All-out Attacker set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Physically defensive Pokemon such as Sableye, Type: Null, Mudsdale, and Oricorio-E can take Alolan Dugtrio's attacks with ease, although many of these defensive switch ins are liable to being worn down by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Kabutops can outspeed and KO Alolan Dugtrio with their respective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Gastrodon and Jellicent can deal with Alolan Dugtrio well; however, Substitute + Toxic variants of Alolan Dugtrio can lure them in and wear them down.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-type Pokemon such as Tangela and Lurantis can take its attacks without much issue, but they have to be careful of Substitute + Toxic sets.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Most priority users are able to either beat or force out Alolan Dugtrio due to it having low Defense and being weak to common priority such as Hitmonchan's Mach Punch, Gurdurr's Mach Punch, and Kabutops's Aqua Jet.</p>",

      "Substitute + Toxic": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Toxic is used to put bulky Water-types that Alolan Dugtrio lures in such as Gastrodon and Poliwrath on a timer. When coupled with Toxic, Substitute is used to ease prediction and wear down teams. When this set is used in conjunction with Toxic Spikes support, Toxic can be replaced with Stone Edge, which expands Alolan Dugtrio's coverage and allows it to hit Pokemon like Swanna and Oricorio-E super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers gives Alolan Dugtrio passive recovery, which allows it to use Substitute more often. Tangling Hair is the preferred ability because it lowers the foe's Speed by one stage if Alolan Dugtrio is hit by a contact move, and its other abilities are generally more situational.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Alolan Dugtrio should use Toxic to wear down bulky Water-types such as Gastrodon and Jellicent and other Pokemon that can wall its STAB moves like Oricorio-E and Eelektross. Generally, Alolan Dugtrio should use Substitute against poisoned foes in order to rack up poison damage. It can acquire Substitutes against Pokemon that can't break its Substitute like Clefairy lacking Seismic Toss and against Pokemon that Alolan Dugtrio can force out like Lanturn and Simisear. Substitute can also force 50/50s with Sucker Punch users like Absol and Skuntank. Lastly, try to avoid switching in Alolan Dugtrio even on resisted hits because it's very frail.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard users such as Omastar and Clefairy make for good teammates because hazards make it easier for Alolan Dugtrio to clean, since its Attack stat is mediocre. Alolan Dugtrio wears down bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Poliwrath with Toxic, so Pokemon like Combusken make for decent teammates because they appreciate their similar checks being crippled. Additionally, Electric-types such as Alolan Raichu and Lanturn appreciate Alolan Dugtrio's ability to cripple opposing Ground-types like Mudsdale and Golurk with Toxic. Strong physical attackers like Lycanroc and Stoutland make good partners because they appreciate Toxic wearing down their defensive answers like Regirock and Tangela. Additionally, Kangaskhan also appreciates Normal-type checks weakened, and it can rack up poison damage from Alolan Dugtrio's Toxic via Fake Out. Finally, Fighting-type checks such as Qwilfish and Roselia pair well with Alolan Dugtrio because they can set up entry hazards to further wear down the opposing team.</p>"

While Sand Force can be chosen if Alolan Dugtrio is used in conjunction with Sandstorm, its use over Tangling Hair is situational.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Alolan Dugtrio is usually useless versus bulkier teams, so it should switch out versus Pokemon like Oricorio-E and Gastrodon that wall it. Use Alolan Dugtrio to revenge kill threats such as Simisear and Aurorus. Alolan Dugtrio can be preserved for late-game use in case its Sucker Punch is needed to stop setup sweepers, such as Normalium Z Jynx and Alolan Raichu. Alolan Dugtrio should use Memento at the right opportunity to ease setup for another teammate. Additionally, if it's not using Memento, Alolan Dugtrio can be sacrificed in battles with unfavorable matchups by switching directly into physical attacks that would KO it to lower the Speed of its foe via Tangling Hair, which allow its teammates to revenge kill the threat in question more easily.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Strong wallbreakers like Drampa and Aurorus can open opportunities for Alolan Dugtrio to clean late-game, since they are able to break past most of Dugtrio's common checks like Tangela and Torterra. Bulky Water-type checks such as Hitmonchan and Ludicolo also work well with Alolan Dugtrio. Ludicolo also appreciates Alolan Dugtrio's Memento support, which eases its setup. Alolan Dugtrio pairs well with Fighting-type checks such as Spiritomb and Qwilfish, since a common way of revenging it is by using Mach Punch or Choice Scarf Primeape. Qwilfish's Toxic Spikes wears down many of Alolan Dugtrio's natural checks as well as bulky Pokemon with the ability to switch into Alolan Dugtrio's STAB-boosted moves, like Ludicolo and Tangela, respectively.</p>"

  "Persian-Alola": {
    "overview": "<p>Alolan Persian has quite a few niches that allow it to warrant use on a team. First off, it has access to the coveted Parting Shot, which provides momentum, lowers the foe's attacking stats, and, if used with Darkinium Z, can heal an incoming teammate to full HP. Another niche is access to the ability Fur Coat, doubling Alolan Persian's Defense and making it a decent check to physical attackers, as well as providing ample setup opportunities. Alolan Persian's Speed makes it faster than important threats like Alolan Raichu and Lycanroc, turning it into one of the tier's best Nasty Plot sweepers. It also has a vast array of support moves to help many different team archetypes, including Knock Off. Despite these qualities, Alolan Persian has a somewhat small offensive movepool, lacking effective coverage options. It struggles to damage foes that don't take much from Dark-type attacks, and it also doesn't appreciate the Fighting-types in the tier like Hitmonchan and Gurdurr. That being said, its excellent Speed and access to both Nasty Plot and Z-Parting Shot are usually worthwhile enough to consider using Alolan Persian.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Knock Off is an option to cripple some Pokemon that rely on their items like Clefairy but has far less consistent damage output against physical attackers. Fake Out can be run over Toxic on a team that already has Toxic Spikes support to help rack up damage while the foe is unable to attack. Hypnosis can be run to leave a foe unable to attack, though its low accuracy can leave Alolan Persian vulnerable. Alolan Persian can function as a weather setter with Sunny Day or Rain Dance and then pivot out with Parting Shot, though Liepard generally performs this better with its access to Prankster.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Primeape in particular is a problem for Alolan Persian, as the common Choice Scarf set outspeeds Alolan Persian and does a huge chunk of damage with Close Combat. Parting Shot also boosts Primeape's Attack by three stages if used against it and makes it harder for the incoming Pokemon to handle it. Hitmonchan and Gurdurr can both pick off the offensive set with Mach Punch if Alolan Persian takes too much damage, and Foul Play doesn't do enough damage to threaten them.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Clefairy is a hard counter to any Alolan Persian set, as it doesn't have a good way of damaging it. Silvally-Fairy and Granbull can also do fairly well versus Alolan Persian but don't like taking too much damage from Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers like Aurorus and Drampa can break through support Alolan Persian quite easily while not taking much damage from Foul Play and can force it to pivot out, though Toxic and Parting Shot can be annoying to them.</p>",

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Parting Shot creates momentum and allows a teammate to get in safely due to the Attack and Special Attack drop. Thunderbolt hits Dark-resistant threats like Skuntank and Poliwrath for decent damage, which would otherwise wall Alolan Persian. Alternatively, Dream Eater can be used with Psychium Z to get past Fighting-types like Gurdurr, Hitmonchan, and Assault Vest Crabominable while heavily chunking Fairy-types like Silvally-Fairy and Granbull. However, this leaves Alolan Persian unable to do much to opposing Dark-types like opposing Alolan Persian, and it can only be used once. Hypnosis can be used over Parting Shot to give Alolan Persian setup opportunities while its high Speed and ability to force out threats allow it to cripple an opposing Pokemon, but it suffers from low accuracy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Darkinium Z can be used alongside Dark Pulse to heavily damage bulkier threats such as Regirock and Lanturn after a boost and to OHKO Alolan Raichu with no boost required. It can also be used with Parting Shot to fully heal a teammate, giving them a second chance of sweeping or wallbreaking. Fur Coat is the preferred ability, as it gives Alolan Persian setup opportunities while preventing revenge killing from Choice Scarf users like Kabutops and priority moves like Gurdurr's Mach Punch and Kangaskhan's Fake Out. Psychium Z can be used over Darkinium Z to turn Dream Eater into Shattered Psyche, allowing Alolan Persian to deal with Fighting- and Fairy-types like Hitmonchan and Silvally-Fairy.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early- and mid-game, when its checks are healthy, Alolan Persian should try to generate momentum for its teammates with Parting Shot, especially against threats it forces out. This also allows Alolan Persian to bluff a bulky set, which may leave you in an advantageous position. It should primarily set up late-game, when its checks, such as Lanturn, are worn out, allowing it to sweep or set up on a forced or predicted switch. Alolan Persian should be kept as healthy as possible to prevent revenge killing from fast Pokemon like Choice Scarf Dodrio and priority users like Hitmonchan. The Z-Crystal should be used to get past threats such as Eelektross and Regirock if holding Darkinium Z and Gurdurr and Silvally-Fairy if holding Psychium Z. However, if holding Darkinium Z, it can also be used alongside Parting Shot to fully heal a teammate, giving it a second chance of sweeping or wallbreaking. Even if it's not Alolan Persian's primary job, Alolan Persian can also be used to revenge kill slower and frail threats such as Dodrio and Alolan Raichu thanks to the Z-Move; however, unless they're weakened, Alolan Persian won't be able to revenge kill them due to its mediocre firepower.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazards are greatly appreciated, since they pair well with Parting Shot while also weakening Alolan Persian's checks. Therefore, setters such as Qwilfish and Roselia pair well with Alolan Persian, and the former can also check troublesome Fighting-types. U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Scyther and Eelektross are decent partners in general due to their ability to generate momentum with Alolan Persian. Primeape is an especially good option, since Alolan Persian deals with its checks like Jellicent and Oricorio-G. Wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Drampa appreciate Alolan Persian's ability to bring them in safely with Parting Shot and heal them with Z-Parting Shot, giving them a second chance of wallbreaking while also allowing them to play more aggressively. They also weaken or deal with walls such as Regirock and Clefairy, paving a way for Alolan Persian to sweep. On a similar note, sweepers like Simisear and Dodrio appreciate the setup opportunities Parting Shot brings, while Z-Parting Shot gives them a second chance of sweeping, allowing them to play aggressively early-game. Due to Alolan Persian's inability to hit Fighting-types for considerable damage if lacking Dream Eater, Fighting-type checks like Oricorio-E and Qwilfish are mandatory. Oricorio-E also has the added bonus of checking Bug-types like Scyther for Alolan Persian. However, if running Dream Eater + Psychium Z, Alolan Persian will struggle against opposing Dark-types like Skuntank and Alolan Raticate. Because of this, Dark-types checks like Gurdurr and Poliwrath make for decent partners.</p>"

      "Bulky Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Parting Shot allows Alolan Persian to be an effective pivot, lowering the stats of the opposing Pokemon, and can be used with Darkinium Z to bring a teammate back to full HP. Taunt is used to stop setup sweepers like Shell Smash Carracosta, bulky Pokemon trying to recover like Gastrodon and Audino, and entry hazard setters like Golurk and Regirock. Foul Play is used to damage physical attackers and is useful because it doesn't rely on Alolan Persian's far-below-average Attack stat. Toxic can further help wear down walls like Gastrodon, Lanturn, and Regirock.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment is used to make Alolan Persoan as good of a pivot as possible. Fur Coat is Alolan Persian's most useful ability, doubling its Defense and letting it switch into Pokemon like Lycanroc, Absol, and Golurk. Darkinium Z can be used with Parting Shot to bring in a teammate to full HP or Foul Play to pick off something weakened with Black Hole Eclipse. A Jolly nature is used so the power of your Z-Move isn't weakened if you are in a position to use it. Leftovers can be used to provide passive recovery and make Alolan Persian harder to wear down, though Z-Parting Shot is Alolan Persian's main niche, so Leftovers should only be used if you already have another Z-Move user.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Alolan Persian is best used as a pivot to take a physical hit from Pokemon like Regirock and Golurk, and switch out with Parting Shot. Alolan Persian can make an excellent lead with its fast Taunt, stopping opposing leads from getting up entry hazards, and Parting Shot allows it to scout for the opponent's initial switch-in and gain momentum. Toxic should be used as a way of wearing down Pokemon that can switch into Alolan Persian and don't take much damage from Foul Play like Audino and Gastrodon. If running Darkinium Z, it is helpful to save your Z-Parting Shot until a later part of the game so a worn down teammate can benefit from the full heal. Foul Play can be turned into Black Hole Eclipse in a pinch if Alolan Persian needs to hit a special attacker that wouldn't take much from Foul Play.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Alolan Persian typically finds its home on more offensive teams as a way of gaining momentum and providing a setup opportunity for a teammate, though it can also be used on bulkier teams as a decent check to physical attackers. Setup sweepers like Nasty Plot Jynx, Lycanroc, and Absol greatly appreciate Alolan Persian's access to Parting Shot, as it gives them a way of coming in on a weakened attack and being able to set up. Strong breakers like Drampa and Toxic Orb Zangoose value Z-Parting Shot to have a second chance at breaking through a team. Psychic-types like Claydol and Musharna can check Fighting-types for Alolan Persian while benefiting from Alolan Persian's ability to check Dark- and Ghost-types. Alolan Persian also likes a Fairy-type check like Alolan Dugtrio or Skuntank to help with Clefairy and Silvally-Fairy. Users of Spikes and other entry hazards like Qwilfish and Golurk can partner with Alolan Persian to help rack up damage on foes from the switches that Parting Shot usually forces.</p>"

Primeape, being one of the few Fighting-types with access to U-turn, is beneficial for providing momentum for its teammates and pivoting out on predicted switches. Primeape also has access to Defiant, which allows it to deter Defog very effectively. Primeape is also somewhat unpredictable, as it is able to run multiple sets, items, and coverage moves. Despite these attributes, Primeape has mediocre bulk and struggles to break past bulky Ghost-, Poison-, and Psychic-types without a moderate amount of team support. Furthermore, common balance Pokemon such as Jellicent make using STAB Close Combat a liability. Base 95 Speed is also a crowded Speed tier for non-Choice Scarf users, with Primeape finding trouble effectively revenge killing Jynx, Silvally-Ghost and -Fairy, and Haunter without forcing a Speed tie.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bulk Up can be run over U-turn on Primeape's non-choiced offensive set, but Primeape is too slow to sweep and the extra power is usually not needed to wallbreak effectively. Punishment is an option for beating Psychic-types such as Musharna, but it should only be used on the Choice Band set, as it's inferior to other coverage moves most of the time. Additionally, Z-Encore is a solid option, as it locks the foe into a move and gives Primeape a Speed boost; however, despite these attributes, it takes up the Z-Move slot and isn't very strong if Primeape doesn't get a Defiant boost. Life Orb can be used to allow Primeape to hit harder than Fist Plate while being able to switch attacks, but sacrifices the ability to bluff other sets. Toxic can be used as another option to status Pokemon such as Musharna and Sableye after it has been lured in.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Primeape is either walled, crippled, or checked offensively, by the tier's Ghost-types such as Sableye, Jellicent, Haunter, and Oricorio-G.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Bulky Psychic-types like Musharna can take any attack from Primeape with ease. Choice Scarf Jynx can revenge kill Primeape, since Primeape can't reliably revenge kill Z-Lovely Kiss sets without a Speed tie.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Swanna and Oricorio-E check Primeape due to them being able to take Close Combat with ease or being naturally faster.

Close Combat is Primeape's main revenge killing tool and its coverage, most notably Stone Edge, should be used sparingly because it's weak and easily taken advantage of, allowing Pokemon like Musharna and Carracosta to set up for free. You should use U-turn every time you expect a defensive switch-in to be brought in in order to keep momentum up. Be aware that Primeape isn't all that bulky, so be careful when pivoting into Defog users such as Skuntank and Lurantis.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primeape fits well on teams that need a reliable revenge killer. Entry hazards from Pokemon like Qwilfish increase Primeape's capability of pressuring its checks and counters. Flying checks such as Regirock and Alolan Sandslash are beneficial for when you predict wrong with Close Combat versus the opposing team. Lastly, Pursuit support from the likes of Absol, Skuntank, and Liepard is appreciated to deal with Psychic and Ghost-types that take on Close Combat.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stone Edge hits Flying-type Pokemon that resist or are immune to Close Combat for super effective damage, such as Scyther, Swanna, and Oricorio-G. It is also Primeape's best way of dealing damage to Poison-type Pokemon such as Haunter and Qwilfish. U-turn is used to pick up momentum on forced switches and pivot Primeape out of foes that beat it such as Sableye and Jellicent. Encore annoys foes by locking them into undesirable status moves such as Stealth Rock, Toxic, and setup moves. Pokemon that may use such moves include Clefairy and Calm Mind Spiritomb. It has good synergy with U-turn as well, generating free turns. Gunk Shot provides coverage for the Fairy-types that tank Primeape's Close Combat, such as Clefairy and Silvally-Fairy, and it also hits Grass-types such as Lurantis for more damage than Close Combat. Earthquake is an option that allows Primeape to do more damage to Skuntank while bypassing Aftermath, as well as chip Spiritomb more reliably than Stone Edge. It also hits Pokemon such as Regirock without suffering the drops of Close Combat. However, Primeape would much rather use Encore or Gunk Shot due to them being more useful overall, and Primeape can KO the former with some chip anyway.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Fist Plate allows Primeape to bluff a Choice item set while also boosting the power of its STAB move. Fightinium Z does the same but exchanges Fist Plate's consistent power boost for a one-time powerful All-Out Pummeling, doing more damage to foes such as Torterra. Defiant takes advantage of Defog when used by Pokemon such as Skuntank and Lurantis by receiving a +2 Attack boost from the evasion drop. It also boosts Primeape's Attack when its stats are dropped by Sticky Web or Intimidate.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Primeape set is best used as an early-game wallbreaker. If Primeape has not yet revealed its lack of Choice Scarf, it is a good idea to send it in after something has fainted to bluff a Choice Scarf set and take advantage of the forced switch with U-turn. Switching Primeape out instead of switching moves helps bluff the Choice Scarf set as well. U-turn can also be used when Primeape threatens the foe with heavy damage. Intentionally using the incorrect attack against foes that often carry Protect such as Audino and Regirock is smart to lull the opponent into a false sense of security, as they will often stay in afterward believing Primeape is locked into a move. Try not to reveal Encore, use All-Out Pummeling, or switch moves too soon, as revealing the fact that Primeape is not using a Choice Scarf set removes a lot of its surprise factor and makes it less threatening against faster Pokemon. An appropriate time to do the aforementioned is when Primeape is able to KO, heavily damage, or Encore a foe attempting to take advantage of Primeape supposedly being locked into one move. Such Pokemon include Oricorio-G and Type: Null. All-Out Pummeling should be used to KO a foe that would otherwise be out of range of Primeape's other moves. It can also be used to take out foes if you cannot risk Stone Edge or Gunk Shot missing. After having locked a foe into an exploitable move via Encore, using U-turn or Close Combat is generally the best play, as Primeape can either bring a dangerous teammate in for free, pick up momentum as the foe switches out, or fire off a powerful attack with few to no repercussions. If it is known that an enemy Pokemon such as Qwilfish is carrying a Rocky Helmet, spamming U-turn is discouraged, as Primeape will end up being worn down very quickly. Instead, double switch into an ally such as Eelektross that can beat said foes. As Primeape is very frail, switching it in on even resisted hits is not recommended. Instead, get Primeape in via pivoting moves such as U-turn, double switching, or switching Primeape in on a predicted status move such as Stealth Rock. It can switch into predicted uses of Defog from Pokemon such as Skuntank but must be wary of said Pokemon predicting this and choosing to attack instead.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Aurorus, Haunter, and Oricorio-G are able to beat or force out Primeape's checks, like Sableye. In return, Primeape is able to beat their checks as well, specifically specially defensive Pokemon such as Eelektross and Regirock, and it provides them with U-turn and Encore support, giving them more opportunities to break. Oricorio-G can use these chances to set up Calm Mind as well. Primeape's ability to deter Defog with Defiant is appreciated by Pokemon that stack entry hazards, such as Qwilfish, Omastar, and Shuckle. Primeape appreciates the chip damage these hazards give, which helps it exert more pressure in conjunction with U-turn. Sticky Web also allows Primeape to outspeed normally faster grounded foes such as Floatzel and Alolan Raichu while also not giving away its lack of Choice Scarf. Stoutland and Bellossom are both Pokemon that appreciate Primeape being able to surprise Pokemon such as Regirock and Oricorio-G with its lack of Choice Scarf, as they will often switch in after Primeape has KOed a foe due to believing it is Choice locked and attempt to set up hazards or use Calm Mind. Other pivots such as Eelektross and Silvally-Water can create a VoltTurn core with Primeape, putting lots of pressure on the opposing team as well as helping to keep momentum. These Pokemon also help break down some of Primeape's checks, such as Sableye and Golurk. Eelektross also provides Knock Off support, removing the passive recovery of Pokemon such as Altaria, while Silvally-Water appreciates Primeape threatening its checks such as Audino and Lanturn. Choice Scarf users such as Swanna and Dodrio help both Primeape and its team keep faster foes in check, as Primeape is unable to fill the role of revenge killer with this set. Their presence also makes it easier for Primeape to bluff the Choice Scarf set. Teammates with multiple common sets outside of Choice Scarf such as Haunter also make it more difficult for the opponent to predict which Pokemon is holding a Choice Scarf.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn is used to gain momentum, giving a free switch in to a teammate if the foe switches out or you predict correctly versus a check or counter, while also doing a decent amount of damage to Psychic-types. Stone Edge allows Primeape to threaten Flying-types such as Scyther, Oricorio-G, and Swanna more effectively, as well as providing useful neutral coverage. Gunk Shot is great coverage to have on Primeape because it OHKOes Fairy-types such as Silvally-Fairy. Seed Bomb is somewhat weaker but allows Primeape to lure Jellicent. Alternatively, Earthquake can work over Stone Edge as a more accurate option which can revenge kill Skuntank without triggering Aftermath.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With a Choice Band maximizing the damage output of its moves, Primeape can 2HKO a large portion of the metagame with its spammable Close Combat. Defiant allows Primeape to pivot into and punish Skuntank and Cryogonal on a predicted Defog.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Close Combat is a very spammable move and, coupled with its high Base Power and a Choice Band, it can severely dent teams. Choice Band Primeape is best utilized as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker. Generally, you want to get Primeape on the field as often as possible for it to take advantage of its wallbreaking opportunities for its teammates, usually a late-game cleaner or sweeper. Primeape has decently strong coverage, so feel free to use whatever works in different situations to avoid being set up on by Pokemon that tank Close Combat. With that said, using Primeape with Choice Band requires a decent amount of prediction, so playing aggressively will get the most out of it; you have to be very careful about getting set up on if you are locked into Stone Edge and the opponent brings in a Pokemon like Alolan Persian or Carracosta.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support from the likes of Regirock and Qwilfish is helpful for the passive damage it provides because Primeape pivots into and out of the field, making wallbreaking easier for Choice Band sets. Primeape does not like to switch into entry hazards itself, though, as they can wear it down fast so Skuntank is a perfect partner that can remove hazards, while also being able to Pursuit trap Ghost- and Psychic-types for Primeape. Pokemon with access to Rapid Spin such as Alolan Sandslash also make good partners. A setup Sweeper such as Bulk Up Gurdurr is also a good partner for Primeape because Choice Band Primeape breaks through Gurdurr's checks, making it easier to set up. Furthermore, Pokemon that are immune to Will-O-wisp such as Simisear and Combusken are good teammates. Finally, Pursuit trappers such as Spiritomb make for good teammates to Primeape, as they can trap Psychic-types.</p>"

  "Poliwrath": {
    "overview": "<p>Poliwrath is a strong option in the PU metagame thanks to its unique defensive typing and ability, which allow it to combat many of the tier's top threats including Alolan Sandslash, Lycanroc, Omastar, and Skuntank. Aside from extreme role compression, Poliwrath also has a diverse enough movepool to allow it to run a range of offensive and defensive sets as both a physical and special attacker while still managing to keep the aforementioned threats in check. Poliwrath is also one of the few Pokemon with access to moves and abilities such as Circle Throw, Vacuum Wave, and Water Absorb, which are extremely useful for phazing in conjunction with Spikes, revenge killing Omastar, and checking Water-types, respectively. However, Poliwrath's stats are incredibly average, meaning that it can't specialize or excel in any offensive or defensive roles outside of checking the same list of Pokemon. While Poliwrath's typing is extremely good for checking specific Rock- and Water-types, it also leaves Poliwrath vulnerable to a wide range of common Grass-, Flying-, Electric-, and Psychic-types, meaning that almost every team will naturally have multiple Poliwrath checks such as Oricorio-E or Eelektross. Lack of reliable recovery means that Poliwrath must use unreliable means such as Rest or a combination of Leftovers and Protect to avoid being worn down too quickly. Poliwrath also faces some competition from other Fighting- and Water-types such as Gurdurr and Lanturn, but while it will usually be outclassed in terms of raw bulk or strength, its niche is incredibly solid because nothing can compress roles quite like Poliwrath.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs sets increase Poliwrath's power while still checking many dangerous sweepers, but Poliwrath remains somewhat weak even with the boost in power. Substitute + Focus Punch sets hit much harder than the special tank set is capable of, but they lack the same amount of longevity and are still checked very hard by many common Pokemon like Qwilfish. Bulk Up sets, with or without Substitute, can be dangerous wallbreakers, but they are somewhat matchup reliant and still have difficulty breaking through moderately bulky Pokemon such as Scyther and are very easy to revenge kill. Earthquake can be used on the special tank set, as it is Poliwrath's best move to hit Lanturn and Qwilfish with. However, it has little other utility. Rain Dance sets can attempt to sweep with Swift Swim, but this is generally done better by Ludicolo and Omastar if special or Qwilfish and Kabutops if physical. Poliwrath can also be run on full rain teams as a Belly Drum sweeper, but such a set has difficulties setting up. Z-Hypnosis + Belly Drum sets can help Poliwrath to be a very strong wallbreaker if it is able to land Hypnosis, but they are still fairly easy to revenge kill due to Poliwrath's mediocre Speed. Encore is an annoying utility option that helps Poliwrath not be quite so useless versus special walls, but it isn't exceptionally useful, especially when compared to the constant utility of Protect.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Type-advantaged Pokemon</strong>: Grass-types such as Victreebel and Tangela, Flying-types such as Swanna and Oricorio-G, Psychic-types such as Jynx, and Electric-types such as Eelektross and Lanturn can all take on Poliwrath one-on-one fairly easily, with most being able to switch in with little risk. Poliwrath can attempt to phaze them on the switch with Circle Throw, burn them with Scald, or cripple them with Toxic, but it must often make a good prediction to cripple them most effectively. Jellicent is also notable for fearing nothing but Toxic from any Poliwrath set.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Special tank Poliwrath fails to break through most specially bulky Pokemon, including Hitmonchan, Clefairy, and Throh, and is susceptible to being worn down by their attacks or used as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Due to its lack of reliable recovery, Poliwrath is prone to being slowly worn down by, entry hazards, status, and repeated switches into strong Pokemon such as Aggron and Kangaskhan.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Toxic is necessary for crippling defensive switch-ins like Jellicent, which Poliwrath otherwise fails to threaten. Protect helps Poliwrath rack up passive recovery and Toxic stall opposing Pokemon, and it is generally the most useful final move, as Poliwrath will constantly need to regenerate more health. Vacuum Wave is another solid option for teams that need to better handle Omastar, Carracosta, and Lycanroc, all of which can KO a weakened Poliwrath once boosted but none of which appreciate a STAB priority Fighting-type attack. Ice Beam allows Poliwrath to 2HKO Victreebel, Altaria, and Tangela without risking Focus Blast missing, but it tends to be less useful in most matchups.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Poliwrath to outspeed Modest Jellicent, Jolly Aggron, Modest Aurorus, and neutral-natured Abomasnow, four Pokemon Poliwrath greatly benefits from being able to move before. Maximum HP investment is used because Poliwrath prioritizes its bulk in order to better switch into threats such as Aggron. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Attack to slightly bolster Poliwrath's offenses, but Poliwrath cannot hit especially hard regardless. Leftovers helps provide passive recovery and goes well with Protect, while Water Absorb allows Poliwrath to better check Water-types including Floatzel and Omastar.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be very thoughtful about how Poliwrath's health is preserved. It is often used to switch into a number of different things, and prioritizing whether it's more important to switch directly into Aggron early-game or play around Aggron by other means and keep Poliwrath healthy for checking Omastar late-game can be a critical decision. If running Ice Beam, don't reveal it too early and obviously. Keeping Poliwrath's fourth moveslot vague can be quite useful in catching opponents off guard. Scald is Poliwrath's most spammable move due to its ability to burn switch-ins and Focus Blast's unreliability, but be aware that there are some foes such as Oricorio-E that Poliwrath would much rather cripple with Toxic than burn. Spreading status with Toxic is also a relatively safe option, as most Poliwrath switch-ins like Lurantis and Swanna are extremely averse to being badly poisoned. However, you'll want to avoid spamming Scald if facing teams with Clefairy. Protect is incredibly valuable, but it is also risky; as good as stalling for Toxic and Leftovers recovery is, you should be cautious about giving threats like Alolan Raichu free turns to set up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wish from Audino and Z-Parting Shot from Alolan Persian can significantly improve Poliwrath's longevity and allow it to more freely switch into strong attackers earlier in a match. Poliwrath requires sturdy Psychic-, Grass-, and Flying-type checks due to its very common weaknesses. Thus, Pokemon like Skuntank, Oricorio-G, and Lycanroc are highly recommended. Entry hazard removers such as Lurantis and Altaria are also important, as Poliwrath is extremely susceptible to chip damage from Spikes. Many specially bulky Pokemon, such as Clefairy and the aforementioned Altaria, highly appreciate Poliwrath's ability to check Aggron. Poliwrath is also a good teammate for Pokemon that give Shell Smash Omastar and Carracosta free setup opportunities, like Scyther and Type: Null, which also appreciate Poliwrath's ability to absorb Knock Off fairly well. An Electric-immune Pokemon such as Lanturn or Torterra can help to stop opposing Electric-types from freely using Volt Switch versus Poliwrath. General Electric-type checks such as Drampa are also a good investment. Water-weak Pokemon, including Mudsdale and Combusken, benefit from Poliwrath's presence discouraging free usage of Water-type moves. Poliwrath struggles with bulky setup sweepers like Bellossom and Clefairy, which makes stallbreakers like Oricorio-G, Acid Spray Eelektross, and Taunt Aggron ideal partners. Grounded Poison-types like Skuntank and Qwilfish are useful for removing Toxic Spikes, which can cripple Poliwrath. Strong physical wallbreakers such as Stoutland are good teammates, since Poliwrath is complete bait for most specially defensive Pokemon like Clefairy.</p>"
      },
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Circle Throw is a huge selling point for this set, allowing Poliwrath to phaze opposing Pokemon and rack up extra damage in conjunction with Spikes and Stealth Rock. Scald helps Poliwrath threaten switch-ins with a potential burn, as well as hitting Ghost-types such as Oricorio-G. Rest keeps Poliwrath healthy in order to check boosting sweepers and continue phazing over longer games, while Sleep Talk keeps Poliwrath from being completely passive while asleep.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers provides a bit of passive recovery given Rest's unreliability. A Rocky Helmet can be used to rack up more chip damage at the cost of forcing Poliwrath to use Rest more frequently. Water Absorb helps Poliwrath to check Water-types like Omastar.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Rest whenever needed to keep Poliwrath healthy enough to switch into threats such as Assault Vest Crabominable. However, you should also attempt to avoid doing so whenever it isn't completely necessary, because it forces Poliwrath to rely on Sleep Talk. When lots of entry hazards are up on the opponent's side, use Circle Throw frequently to rack up chip damage. When no hazards are set up, spamming Scald to fish for burns is generally more effective. Poliwrath is a somewhat common and predictable switch-in to many Pokemon including Aggron, Lycanroc, Omastar, and Alolan Raticate, but beware of double switches or somewhat lure sets such as Normalium Z Omastar and Zen Headbutt Carracosta.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit trappers such as Skuntank are all but mandatory, as this set is completely unable to damage Jellicent. This set is almost always found on very bulky teams that require a sturdy Rock-, Water-, and Dark-type check, in particular teams that also utilize Spikes. Spikes setters like Qwilfish and Ferroseed, as well as Stealth Rock setters such as Clefairy, turn Circle Throw from a weak nuisance into a quick way to rack up extra damage from entry hazards. Sturdy Psychic, Grass, and Flying switch-ins such as Spiritomb, Altaria, and Regirock are required due to Poliwrath's plethora of common weaknesses. Specially defensive Pokemon appreciate Poliwrath's ability to check physical wallbreakers such as Kangaskhan. Clefairy, Altaria, and Audino are good examples of both special walls and clerics, which can remove Poliwrath's sleep status and prevent it from relying on Sleep Talk rolls. Dark-weak Pokemon such as Musharna and Haunter appreciate this set's ability to counter most offensive Dark-types save Shiftry. Poliwrath also acts as a Knock Off absorber, which Eviolite-reliant Pokemon like Tangela enjoy. Rapid Spin Alolan Sandslash is a useful teammate, since Poliwrath dislikes Spikes but allows relatively free setup to Roselia and Qwilfish. Defog users such as Skuntank can also be run, but they will remove the entry hazards set by Poliwrath's teammates as well.</p>"

  "Kadabra": {
    "overview": "<p>Kadabra is an excellent revenge killer in the PU tier. In contrast to Musharna, which offers good defensive utility, Kadabra's main niche comes with its unique ability to check many offensive threats with Magic Guard and Counter. Kadabra's Focus Sash cannot be broken by residual damage due to its ability, which makes it very reliable at revenge killing. Its base 105 Speed tier is decent in PU, as it lets Kadabra outspeed Pokemon like Jynx, Simisear, and the Silvally formes, but it isn't amazing either, as Kadabra can also be outsped by important threats such as Alolan Persian and Lycanroc. Kadabra's main drawback comes from its terrible defensive stats, meaning it cannot switch into any type of attack; this makes Kadabra hard to fit on any archetype other than hyper offense.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Encore can be used on Kadabra's revenge killer set, allowing it to lock offensive Pokemon into setup moves or lock more defensive Pokemon into status moves, but Taunt is typically preferable as a utility option. Using Encore can also be disadvantageous if your opponent switches, as it gives them free momentum. Signal Beam grants Kadabra coverage against opposing both Psychic-types like Musharna as well as Dark-types like Shiftry and Absol in one moveslot, but this comes at the cost of power and is more situational in general. Calm Mind boosts the power of Kadabra's special attacks and turns it into more of a breaker. This is generally used in conjunction with Encore, as Kadabra's terrible bulk doesn't allow the foe to set up well without it being locked into a non-damaging move. A Life Orb set with three attacks and Taunt changes Kadabra's role into that of a wallbreaker. This can be used to break down defensive cores more easily. Counter should not be used with this set, as without a Focus Sash Kadabra won't be able to take any type of physical attack. Other Psychic-type wallbreakers such as Alolan Raichu and Nasty Plot Jynx are generally better at accomplishing this role. Psyshock lets Kadabra strike specially defensive walls such as Eelektross and Audino harder than Psychic can and is especially effective when used in tandem with Life Orb. Although there a few targets that Psyshock actually hits, it can also be detrimental for hitting some more physical defensively inclined foes like Carracosta and Tangela. Knock Off can cripple Pokemon that may attempt to switch into Kadabra, like Ferroseed, by removing their Eviolite. Additionally, Knock Off can let Kadabra scout for Z-Crystals. However, Knock Off should only be used on the switch, especially if Kadabra's Focus Sash needs to be preserved, as using it can be disadvantageous when foes like Absol, which can capitalize on it thanks to Justified, are visible at Team Preview. Protect can be used to scout Pursuit users such as Dodrio and Stoutland, although Kadabra struggles to fit this onto its limited moveslots and Counter is typically sufficient. Energy Ball can be used to revenge kill Water-types more effectively, especially Shell Smash Carracosta and Swift Swim Kabutops. However, the coverage that it offers is generally inferior to Dazzling Gleam.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Kadabra lacking Hidden Power Fighting or Ground struggles to break past Pokemon such as Aggron, which resists both of Kadabra's other moves, though with correct prediction, Counter can eliminate it. Bronzor counters non-Shadow Ball Kadabra, though it needs to watch out for Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types like Skuntank and Absol are immune to Kadabra's Psychic and can either Pursuit trap and break its Focus Sash or threaten to break it with Sucker Punch. However, as previously mentioned, physical Dark-types are threatened by Kadabra's Counter, but specially attacking Dark-types like Alolan Persian and Shiftry can beat Kadabra that lack Dazzling Gleam one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Naturally faster Pokemon like Dodrio and Lycanroc or Pokemon with a Choice Scarf like Oricorio-G and Primeape are able to outspeed Kadabra and break its Focus Sash as well as check it after its Focus Sash has been used up. However, faster physical attackers have to be wary of getting hit by Counter.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Kangaskhan can run Fake Out, which breaks Kadabra's Focus Sash and doesn't allow Kadabra to attack. In turn, it avoids Counter and knock out Kadabra with its next attack. Other priority users are able to pick off Kadabra if the Focus Sash is broken.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Focus Sash Revenge Killer": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Counter with Magic Guard allows Kadabra to check physical attackers that try to take advantage of its pitiful Defense a lot more easily, including Pursuit trappers such as Skuntank and Dodrio. Taunt is good in conjunction with Counter, as it forces the foe to attack. It is also good for preventing bulky walls from healing and stopping the use of entry hazards or Defog. Shadow Ball can be used as coverage against other Psychic-types such as Musharna and Metang. Thunder Wave cripples Pokemon and slows them down, which is good against opposing sweepers that aren't knocked out by Kadabra's other moves. Dazzling Gleam is used in the last slot, as it is good coverage against Dark-types such as Alolan Persian, Absol, and Shiftry. Hidden Power Fighting threatens to heavily damage Aurorus and OHKO Aggron as well as Alolan Sandslash. Hidden Power Ground still OHKOes Aggron while 2HKOing Skuntank and Alolan Sandslash.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Focus Sash is used so that Kadabra can always take at least one hit before it goes down, which is good for revenge killing. Magic Guard prevents Kadabra's Focus Sash from being broken by entry hazards or other residual damage sources like sandstorm and hail.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kadabra should be used as a means to stop the opposing Pokemon from sweeping, so keeping its Focus Sash intact is vital. Kadabra's terrible defensive stats mean you do not want it to take any kind of hit if the Focus Sash is broken. Be careful in choosing which Pokemon you want to save Kadabra's Focus Sash for, as using it up on the wrong Pokemon can mean your opponent is able to sweep with something else. Counter is a great move to use if you think the foe is going to use a physical attack, as it basically guarantees the OHKO back due to Kadabra's terrible Defense. Kadabra can also use Counter against Pursuit trappers such as Skuntank, which is great for teammates to capitalize on with Toxic Spikes and other entry hazards. While Kadabra should be reserved for revenge killing boosted threats in match-ups against offensive teams, it can sometimes find opportunities to come onto the field by switching into more passive Pokemon like Roselia when they are predicted to use status moves such as Synthesis and Spikes that will not harm Kadabra.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hyper offense teams in general appreciate Kadabra's ability to check setup sweepers, as they often don't use any sturdy counters to threats. Pokemon like Haunter and Shiftry can take advantage of Kadabra's ability to lure in Pursuit Skuntank and KO it with Counter. Kadabra generally can't really touch Steel-types if it opts to run Dazzling Gleam, so pairing it with Fighting-types like Primeape can often work well. Additionally, Fighting-type checks such as Qwilfish and Victreebel are threatened by Kadabra. Pivots such as Eelektross and Lanturn all excel in providing Kadabra opportunities to come onto the field without being hit first, which is ideal for preserving Kadabra's Focus Sash while simultaneously allowing Kadabra enough breathing room to place offensive pressure on the opposing team. The residual damage that Stealth Rock provides increases the likelihood that Kadabra will successfully score a revenge kill; therefore, offensive Stealth Rock users like Lycanroc, Omastar, and Golurk are useful partners. Spikes setters such as Qwilfish and Ferroseed are also useful for their ability to wear down opposing teams with their entry hazards, with the latter also being able to check physical variants of Skuntank for Kadabra.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Victreebel is one of PU's top wallbreakers thanks to its excellent offensive prowess as well as its unique defensive properties. Strength Sap not only provides Victreebel with a form of reliable recovery but also allows it to beat Pokemon it otherwise wouldn't be able to beat in a one-on-one scenario, like Adamant Stoutland, physically offensive Skuntank, and Hitmonchan. Additionally, a good defensive typing lets it easily switch into and check threats such as Gurdurr, Regirock, and Lurantis, as well as absorb Toxic Spikes. Its ability to run both physically and specially offensive sets viably makes it unpredictable and very difficult to switch into, with counters to specially offensive Victreebel like Cryogonal and Drampa being unable to switch into physical moves like Power Whip and Poison Jab and Pokemon that can wall Swords Dance Victreebel like Alolan Sandslash and Metang being threatened by Hidden Power Fire. However, Victreebel struggles against Flying-types such as Oricorio-G, Articuno, and Altaria that can reliably switch in multiple times on the majority of Victreebel's sets and take it out easily. Moreover, Victreebel's mediocre bulk and middling Speed tier leave it easily revenge killed by a wide array of faster threats including Oricorio-E, Kangaskhan, Dodrio, and Simisear.</p>",

However, it is extremely reliant on sun to function and can be easily shut down by Snow Warning users like Aurorus and Abomasnow. Sleep Powder can be used on both sets to shut down some of Victreebel's common switch-ins such as Oricorio-G and Cryogonal; however, Victreebel struggles to fit it over extra coverage. Knock Off can be used on mixed or physical sets, allowing Victreebel to deal significant damage to switch-ins like Oricorio-G and Cryogonal as well as weaken checks like Metang and Bronzor, and Sucker Punch allows Swords Dance Victreebel to also threaten revenge killers such as Alolan Raichu and Jynx. However, it struggles to fit either move over generally more useful coverage options; furthermore, Sucker Punch is incompatible with Power Whip and leaves Victreebel reliant on a much weaker Grass-type STAB move in Leaf Blade, making it harder to pressure foes like Eelektross and Torterra. Poisonium Z can be used over Grassium Z to pressure Dragon- and Flying-types, and it lends physically offensive sets a notably better matchup against stall, with primary targets being Articuno and Altaria; however, it misses out on Grassium Z's superior coverage. Air Balloon can be used to ease Victreebel's task of switching into Mudsdale and Torterra, as switching into a correctly predicted Earthquake can allow Victreebel to use one of its coverage moves and lower the pressure of having to heal damage from Earthquake with Strength Sap. However, the benefits of using it are very situational compared to items like Grassium Z and Rocky Helmet, which improve Victreebel's matchup against a broader range of threats.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: While they don't like getting poisoned by Poison-type coverage moves, Oricorio-G, Oricorio-E, and Articuno can all switch in safely on most Victreebel sets with Stealth Rock off the field and force it out with super effective coverage, and the former two can even take advantage of forced switches to set up with Calm Mind. Dodrio and Swanna can easily check Victreebel, although they can't switch in directly on it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Combusken, Simisear, and Turtonator can all check Victreebel from full health and either take it out or set up on it. None of them can switch in safely, however, as they take substantial damage from Poison-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Although none of them can switch in safely on any of Victreebel's moves, faster threats like Alolan Raichu, Choice Scarf Aurorus, Choice Scarf Abomasnow, Rotom-F, and Jynx can all KO Victreebel with super effective STAB moves from full health, while Kangaskhan and Floatzel can take it out after slight chip damage, with the latter also being able to Pursuit trap it.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Cryogonal and Audino can come in safely on any of specially offensive Victreebel's moves and proceed to either take it out or pass Wish. Drampa is also notable for its ability to switch in on predicted Grass moves like Strength Sap due to its access to Sap Sipper, and it can even take one Sludge Bomb comfortably. They are all incapable of switching in on Swords Dance variants, however, and Drampa also doesn't like getting poisoned from Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: While they all fear Hidden Power Fire, Steel-types like Alolan Sandslash and Metang can effectively wall Swords Dance variants of Victreebel and can set up as it's forced out. Alolan Sandslash can even outspeed Victreebel under hail and revenge kill it.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm is Victreebel's strongest STAB move, allowing it to take out slower targets like Mudsdale, Regirock, Jellicent, Carracosta, and Aggron easily; pressure others like Eelektross, Stoutland, and Gurdurr; and prevent faster threats like Kangaskhan and Choice Scarf Aurorus from switching in safely. Hidden Power Fire threatens Steel-types like Alolan Sandslash and Ferroseed that can otherwise wall Victreebel.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature, along with maximum investment in Speed, enables Victreebel to outspeed neutral-natured Stoutland and Ludicolo as well as positive-natured Alolan Sandslash. Alternatively, a Modest nature can be used to increase Victreebel's power, notably raising its chance of OHKOing targets like Jellicent, Qwilfish, and Claydol with Leaf Storm. Grassium Z enables Victreebel to KO targets such as Lanturn and to avoid the drop in Special Attack from Leaf Storm when targeting bulky Pokemon like Eelektross or using its Grass-type move on consecutive turns. If your team's Z-Move slot is already occupied, Victreebel can use Rocky Helmet to further pressure Pokemon that use contact moves like Gurdurr, Stoutland, and Skuntank, allowing it to deal residual damage while simultaneously using Strength Sap to replenish its HP.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Victreebel can be brought in on targets that don't threaten it like Mudsdale, Regirock, Gurdurr, and Lurantis, as well as on Choice item users like Stoutland and Absol locked into unfavorable moves so it can proceed to either attempt to wallbreak or recover health with Strength Sap. However, it should be wary of using Strength Sap against Primeape, as it is able to 2HKO Victreebel with any of its moves after an Attack boost from Defiant. Otherwise, it should be brought in by pivots on targets that it can't switch in on easily or that threaten it with their potential coverage options like Hitmonchan and Golurk. Early-game, when counters to Victreebel like Oricorio-G and Cryogonal are on the field, it should prioritize using Strength Sap to secure additional opportunities to switch in or perform aggressive double switches out of its counters. Additionally, Victreebel should be preserved or kept healthy via Strength Sap if it needs to stick around to counter Pokemon like Gurdurr late-game. Bloom Doom should be reserved for mid- or late-game, ideally until counters like Cryogonal are KOed or in the move's KO range. It should also be used as a means of avoiding the Special Attack drop from Leaf Storm to guarantee a 2HKO on bulky Pokemon like Eelektross. Victreebel should use its Poison typing to sponge Toxic for its teammates, as well as remove Toxic Spikes from the field upon switching in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Victreebel highly benefits from pivots such as Lanturn, Primeape, Rotom-F, and Silvally-Fairy that can bring it in safely with Volt Switch, U-turn, or Parting Shot on targets that it can't switch into freely such as Stoutland, Jellicent, and Claydol. Lanturn is a particularly good teammate for Victreebel, as its typing and bulk allow it to switch comfortably into threats like Oricorio-E, Rotom-F, non-Grassium Z Simisear, Swanna, and Floatzel, while it appreciates Victreebel taking care of Grass- and Ground-types such as Lurantis and Mudsdale as well as opposing Lanturn. Rotom-F and Silvally-Fairy can also provide Defog support in addition to Volt Switch and Parting Shot; the former can also pressure Oricorio-G and Oricorio-E and appreciates Victreebel's ability to check Gurdurr and Lanturn, and the latter can act as a secondary Fighting-type check and ease pressure off Victreebel by checking Gurdurr and Hitmonchan. Jellicent can support Victreebel defensively by alleviating the pressure of checking Fighting-types like Primeape and Hitmonchan while also taking on various checks to Victreebel such as Alolan Sandslash, Combusken, and Scyther.</p> <p>Victreebel appreciates entry hazard support from Stealth Rock setters such as Regirock, Torterra, and Mudsdale, as they help it pressure Flying- and Ice-types such as Oricorio-E and Cryogonal as well as ease its task of taking out Pokemon such as Torterra and Silvally-Fairy. Regirock can also switch in reliably on Pokemon like Oricorio-G, Cryogonal, and Articuno, and Torterra helps Victreebel pressure mutual targets like Eelektross. Cryogonal and Alolan Sandslash provide Victreebel with reliable entry hazard removal, as well as a solid specially defensive backbone by switching in on threats like Oricorio-E and Oricorio-G. In return, Victreebel can check Fighting-types like Gurdurr and Hitmonchan for them. Stoutland, as well as offensive variants of Alolan Sandslash, stand out as excellent offensive partners to Victreebel, as they can reliably take out some of Victreebel's counters such as Cryogonal, Articuno, Audino, and Altaria, while Victreebel is capable of reliably switching into and taking out threats that Stoutland and Alolan Sandslash struggle with such as Gurdurr, Regirock, Mudsdale, and Tangela. Additionally, they assist each other by pressuring shared targets such as Eelektross for Stoutland and Torterra for Alolan Sandslash.</p> <p>Rock-types like Carracosta and Lycanroc appreciate Victreebel taking out Pokemon that can wall them, stop them from setting up, or cripple them with Will-O-Wisp, like Tangela, Jellicent, and Sableye. In return, they can force out threats to Victreebel like Oricorio-G and Cryogonal and can threaten Fire-types like Combusken and Simisear with unboosted priority moves after slight chip damage. Choice Scarf Aurorus can notably outspeed and threaten a wide array of Pokemon that can check Victreebel, such as Oricorio-G, Silvally-Dragon, and Drampa, as well as lure in Cryogonal and Rotom-F and weaken them with Stone Edge. In exchange, Victreebel can check Stealth Rock setters that wear Aurorus down like Regirock and Carbink, as well as Fighting-types like Gurdurr and Primeape. Skuntank appreciates Victreebel checking physical walls like Mudsdale and Regirock, and in return, it is able to check and Pursuit trap Psychic-types that Victreebel struggles with such as Musharna, Alolan Raichu, Jynx, and Bronzor. Simisear highly appreciates Victreebel pressuring Pokemon like Lanturn as well as chipping Dragon-types like Drampa, Altaria, and Silvally-Dragon with Sludge Bomb, making it easier for Simisear to break past them late-game.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Power Whip is Victreebel's strongest physical Grass-type STAB move, giving it the ability to score KOs against specially defensive targets such as Assault Vest Eelektross and Crabominable after a boost, and Cryogonal after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed neutral-natured Stoutland, Ludicolo, and Absol, while an Adamant nature can be used to pressure threats like Eelektross and Gurdurr more heavily, notably giving Victreebel a higher chance to OHKO the former with Grassium Z-boosted Power Whip. Grassium Z allows Victreebel to take out Mudsdale from full health and Eelektross and Regirock after slight chip damage even without a Swords Dance boost, as well as Torterra after a Swords Dance boost. Alternatively, Lum Berry prevents Victreebel from getting crippled by Will-O-Wisp users like Jellicent and Sableye, as well as Scald users that it otherwise switches into easily like bulky Lanturn and Gastrodon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early-game, Victreebel should take advantage of opposing Pokemon like Cryogonal and Audino that expect to switch into specially offensive sets and heavily damage them with Power Whip. Rather than throwing out attacks with Victreebel early-game, conceal the fact that Victreebel is physically offensive rather than specially offensive and gauge the opponent's response to Victreebel before unleashing Bloom Doom. Victreebel should preferably be brought in by VoltTurn partners or to revenge kill foes whenever possible to make it less reliant on Strength Sap to preserve its longevity and ability to counter Pokemon like Mudsdale repeatedly. Against more offensive teams or in the presence of a counter to Victreebel like Oricorio-G or Alolan Sandslash, Victreebel should prioritize recovering health lost from countering Pokemon like Gurdurr and Regirock with Strength Sap or performing double switches out of its counters. When it can force a switch, Victreebel should attempt to boost its Attack with Swords Dance so it can wallbreak more efficiently.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Victreebel fits well on VoltTurn teams than can provide it with opportunities to come in safely on targets such as Eelektross, Jellicent, Golurk, and Audino and proceed to wallbreak or set up on forced switches, with ideal partners including Eelektross, Lanturn, Primeape, and Alolan Persian. Eelektross and Lanturn can assist Victreebel by pressuring Flying-types like Oricorio-G, Dodrio, and Swanna with super effective coverage. In addition, Eelektross can take out Steel-types that Victreebel struggles with such as Ferroseed, Metang, and Alolan Sandslash with Flamethrower, and Lanturn can check Fire-types like Simisear and Combusken and heal Victreebel of burns with Heal Bell. Primeape highly appreciates Victreebel's ability to check Pokemon that it struggles to break through, like Mudsdale, Regirock, Jellicent, and Tangela, and in return, Primeape can check faster targets that threaten Victreebel like Kangaskhan, Simisear, and Choice Scarf Aurorus, as well as Steel-types like Alolan Sandslash. Alolan Persian can assist Victreebel by pressuring Psychic-types such as Musharna, Alolan Raichu, and Metang and by giving it opportunities to set up thanks to Parting Shot, and in return, it appreciates Victreebel checking Fighting-types like Gurdurr and Hitmonchan.</p> <p>Victreebel appreciates Stealth Rock support from setters like Regirock, Mudsdale, and Torterra, as the chip damage from entry hazards helps it check targets like Articuno, Drampa, Gurdurr, and Torterra more easily. Regirock in particular has great synergy with Victreebel, as it is able to check Ice-types like Alolan Sandslash and Cryogonal, Flying-types like Oricorio-E and Dodrio, and faster Normal-types like Kangaskhan, while Victreebel can threaten Water-types like Lanturn as well as opposing Grass-types like Tangela and Lurantis. Cryogonal also has excellent synergy with Victreebel, as it is able to switch in reliably on threats to Victreebel like Oricorio-E, Oricorio-G, and Swanna, and it also assists it by pressuring shared targets such as Torterra, Drampa, and Jellicent. In return, Victreebel can reliably switch into and threaten Pokemon that Cryogonal is incapable of handling, such as Gurdurr and Regirock, as well as pressure other physical attackers such as Stoutland, Skuntank, and Hitmonchan.</p> <p>Fire-types like Combusken and Simisear highly appreciate Victreebel taking out bulky Water- and Rock-types such as Jellicent, Lanturn, and Regirock, allowing them to function as late-game cleaners more easily. They can also pressure Steel-types like Alolan Sandslash and Metang as well as Ice-types like Cryogonal and Abomasnow that threaten Victreebel. Jellicent benefits from Victreebel's ability to lure and take out specially defensive walls such as Cryogonal and Audino and threaten opposing Water-types such as Lanturn and Gastrodon. In return, it assists Victreebel by reliably switching into Alolan Sandslash and checking Fire-types like Simisear and Combusken. Musharna can use Future Sight to enhance Victreebel's wallbreaking potential further, as there are very few Pokemon that can comfortably take both Future Sight and a boosted Power Whip, as well as support it with Healing Wish, creating more opportunities for it to wallbreak or set up and alleviating the pressure of having to use Strength Sap for recovery.</p>"

  "Golem": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Golem does face heavy competition as a lead, it does boast rather impressive offensive presence as a result of its high Attack and unresisted STAB combination, which allow it to exert more offensive pressure than competing Ground-type setters in Torterra and Mudsdale. Unlike most suicide leads, Golem isn't reliant on Focus Sash to do its job because of its ability Sturdy, meaning that it can hold other items like Weakness Policy or a Custap Berry and augment its offensive presence even further. Additionally, Golem's access to Explosion gives it a powerful means of pressuring removers not to clear the field and immediately generating momentum for its team, while its access to Sucker Punch gives it the ability to threaten more offensive teams as well as compensate for its low Speed. However, Golem tends to be less consistent than other suicide leads such as Lycanroc, Aurorus, and Omastar due to their access to solid support and utility options in Spikes, Spore, Encore, and Knock Off and their higher Speed. Golem also faces competition from Stealth Rock Aggron despite it not being a dedicated lead, as it boasts higher Speed, slightly greater offensive presence because of Head Smash, and access to Taunt. In addition, Golem is very predictable due to a lack of viable options outside of its main set, and has a hard time forcing out Defog users like Swanna and Cryogonal after Sturdy has been broken.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Though it is less reliable than Stone Edge and has limited use, Rock Blast can be used to break Focus Sash on opposing Focus Sash users such as Jynx, as well as breaking Substitute against the likes of Alolan Raichu and the aforementioned Jynx. Choice Band could be used to take advantage of Golem's dangerous STAB combination and coverage in Explosion and Sucker Punch by turning it into a fearsome wallbreaker, though Aggron is a better wallbreaker both offensively and defensively. A physically or specially defensive Stealth Rock set can be used to make use of Golem's defensive capabilities, though a set like this is hindered by Golem's plentiful weaknesses and lack of recovery. Furthermore, other defensive Stealth Rock setters like Regirock, Torterra, and Mudsdale perform this role better because of their better defensive presence. A set of Sunny Day / Stealth Rock / Explosion / Earthquake or Stone Edge can be used as a lead for sun teams, though Regirock tends to outperform Golem because of the better defensive typing and higher bulk it offers, giving it an easier time setting both Stealth Rock and Sunny Day. Fire Punch and Superpower are alternatives that give Golem super effective coverage for Pokemon like Bronzor and Ferroseed, though these Pokemon aren't very common and Golem's STAB moves in combination with Explosion and Sucker Punch provide as much coverage as it typically needs. Rock Polish could be used in tandem with Weakness Policy to make up for Golem's lackluster Speed and turn it into a setup sweeper, though most common Choice Scarf users like Primeape and Kabutops can still easily revenge kill Golem even after the boosts. Toxic cripples switch-ins like Mudsdale, Tangela, and Torterra by putting them on a timer, though finding room for this option can be rather difficult. Mental Herb prevents Golem from being stopped by Taunt once, which can be especially useful given that Sturdy already makes setting Stealth Rock easier, though this leaves it much weaker. Counter is a niche option that allows Golem to take advantage of Sturdy by removing physical attackers like Mudsdale and Primeape after they attack, though Sturdy combined with any Weakness Policy-boosted attack serves almost exactly the same purpose and doesn't rely on making as many predictions. Another thing holding such a set back is the prevalence of U-turn users, with Primeape and Scyther being notable examples. Flail can be used to take advantage of Golem's many weaknesses and meager uninvested bulk, though Explosion fulfills a similar purpose, and Golem's low Speed limits the damage it can cause to opposing teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt from Pokemon like Alolan Persian, Jellicent, and Sableye prevents Golem from setting up Stealth Rock, and its low Speed only makes matters worse. The latter two examples can also burn Golem with Will-O-Wisp. There are more offensive Taunt users like Qwilfish and Oricorio-E, though they don't appreciate taking Golem's attacks and the former activates Golem's Weakness Policy with its Water-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removal</strong>: Although Golem offensively pressures many removers such as Cryogonal, Swanna, and Hitmonchan, they are capable of getting rid of Stealth Rock for good once Golem is KOed.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks</strong>: Once Golem's Sturdy isn't intact, Pokemon with super effective STAB moves like Victreebel, Aurorus, and Leafeon can easily KO Golem. Pokemon that possess super effective coverage like Fightinium Z Kangaskhan are also notable, as they can lure Golem in and take it out. It's also worth mentioning that all of these examples outspeed Golem. Prior to Sturdy being broken, however, all but Aurorus cannot KO Golem.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Explosion is a powerful one-time attack that can pressure hazard removers, generates momentum instantly, and deals massive damage to Pokemon that could otherwise wall Golem like Tangela, Mudsdale, and Gurdurr at the cost of sacrificing Golem. Alternatively, Sucker Punch can be used to pick off weakened, fast Pokemon and threaten faster Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Haunter and Alolan Raichu as well as other frail Pokemon like Swanna, which is especially useful after Golem's Sturdy has been broken.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature can opted over an Adamant nature to outspeed Adamant Aggron, though the loss of power is noticeable. Sturdy guarantees that Golem will always be able to take one hit from full, giving it a much easier time with both setting Stealth Rock and attacking. Custap Berry allows Golem to have a fast Explosion, forcing out faster threats such as Victreebel, Rotom-F, and Alolan Sandslash. Alternatively, Weakness Policy doubles Golem's Attack if it is hit by a super effective attack and turns it into a major offensive threat. Note that if a Custap Berry is used, Explosion is typically a superior option in the last slot over Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Golem should almost always be used as a lead, since Sturdy can be difficult to preserve because of entry hazards and gives it the best possible chance of immediately using Stealth Rock. Leading with Golem also gives it an opportunity to heavily damage or KO opposing leads like Regirock. Try to set Stealth Rock as soon as possible in order to instantly begin applying constant pressure to teams. After doing so, Golem should go on to either inflict damage with its powerful STAB moves and Sucker Punch or use Explosion to prevent removers from switching in and clearing the field. Preserve Golem if the opposing team carries a faster Taunt user like Sableye or Alolan Persian, since they prevent Golem from fulfilling its role by disallowing the use of Stealth Rock. Sableye can also burn Golem with Will-O-Wisp. Against more offensive users of Taunt like Aggron, Golem should go for the KO rather than attempt to set Stealth Rock. Despite being a lead, Golem can be preserved to reliably revenge kill Pokemon on offensive teams like Kangaskhan or if Golem's team is exceptionally weak to any one threat on the opposing team such as Omastar because of Sturdy. Golem can also be preserved to prevent Volt Switch users like Rotom-F from freely generating momentum before generating its own momentum by setting Stealth Rock. Although Explosion and Sucker Punch are both powerful tools against offensive teams, they can both potentially be exploited by Ghost-types and certain setup sweepers, respectively, meaning that Golem should be careful about using these moves against teams if they have one or the other. Most setup sweepers find directly setting up on Golem difficult if its Sturdy is still intact, however. Lastly, note that Custap Berry does not give Golem's moves priority, and as such Sturdy should be preserved against slower priority users such as Gurdurr and Carracosta.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Golem should be used as a Stealth Rock setter on offensive and hyper offensive teams due to the combination of Sturdy, its power, and its ability to prevent Stealth Rock from being removed thanks to Explosion. Qwilfish pairs well with Golem, as its Spikes increase the amount of chip damage opposing teams are forced to take upon entry, and it can prevent Defog users like Skuntank from clearing the field with Taunt. Similarly, Ghost-types such as Spiritomb, Oricorio-G, and Jellicent are great partners to have, since removing Stealth Rock becomes much easier once Golem is KOed, and these Pokemon can block Rapid Spin. Likewise, pairing Golem with Pokemon that can use Defiant or Contrary to deter Defog such as Primeape, Pawniard, and Servine is wise. Stealth Rock damage as well as Explosion wearing Pokemon like Torterra, Altaria, and Mudsdale down gives setup sweepers like Absol, Simisear, and Lycanroc an easier time finishing off weakened teams late-game. These Pokemon also appreciate Explosion instantly generating momentum for them. These same setup sweepers as well as powerful wallbreakers like Aurorus and Victreebel also appreciate Stealth Rock providing additional chip damage that allows them to break through teams with less effort.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Dodrio's fantastic offensive stats, near-unresisted coverage, and access to Swords Dance solidify it as a top offensive threat in PU that's able to blitz through Pokemon found on offensive and defensive teams alike. It can run a variety of sets that each offer immense amounts of offensive pressure: Swords Dance and Choice Band sets excel at wallbreaking, whereas Choice Scarf sets boast a near-unrivaled Speed tier. Since all of Dodrio's sets fit on offensive teams, deciphering what set it's running from Team Preview is nearly impossible, giving Dodrio the upper hand in many situations. However, Dodrio's lackluster bulk and weakness to Stealth Rock limit what it can safely switch into or use Swords Dance on, and it is easily worn down by Brave Bird's high recoil. Dodrio's matchups are also highly set dependent, as wallbreaking sets are prone to being revenge killed, while Choice Scarf lacks the power to break through bulky walls like Regirock and Mudsdale.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt + Roost can be used to give Dodrio the functionality of a stallbreaker, but such a set falls flat due to its shortage of attacking options. Moreover, this competes heavily with other stallbreakers such as Oricorio-E due to its superior defensive capabilities. Life Orb gives Dodrio freedom to switch between its moves and is not one-time use like Z-Crystals are, but Dodrio already struggles with being worn down from Stealth Rock damage and Brave Bird recoil.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Regirock and Carracosta possess enough physical bulk to can switch into Dodrio lacking Fightinium Z and threaten it with their STAB moves. Regirock in particular has the most consistency when it comes to checking all of Dodrio's sets; it can easily switch into Choice-locked variants of Dodrio and OHKO it with Stone Edge, and it can viably run Chople Berry or Protect to sponge an All-Out Pummeling. Lycanroc and Choice Scarf Kabutops outspeed Dodrio lacking a Choice Scarf, and the former can use Dodrio as setup fodder if it's Choice-locked into Pursuit or Quick Attack. All of these Pokemon must be wary of taking a boosted All-Out Pummeling, however.</p> <p><strong>Set-dependent Switch-ins</strong>: Physically defensive walls such as Mudsdale and Sableye are able to switch into Dodrio lacking Flyinium Z and take very little from Choice Scarf Dodrio. They can then proceed to stall it out or cripple it with a burn, respectively. These Pokemon must be cautious of directly switching into Choice Band Dodrio, however. Oricorio-E, Aggron, and Aurorus can come in on Choice-locked Dodrio depending on what it's locked into and threaten it with their respective super effective moves.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers and Priority</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Swanna outspeed variants of Dodrio lacking Choice Scarf and obliterate it with their moves. Floatzel and Alolan Persian are naturally faster than Dodrio and can do serious damage to it with Ice Beam and Foul Play or Thunderbolt, respectively. Alolan Persian can also comfortably take Quick Attack thanks to Fur Coat. All variants of Dodrio are outsped by priority moves such as Kangaskhan's Fake Out and Abomasnow's Ice Shard, both of which do serious damage to it. Additionally, without Quick Attack, Dodrio has little to no way of playing around Sucker Punch users like Skuntank and Absol.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Dodrio gets worn very easily by Brave Bird and has a weakness to Stealth Rock, which limits how many times it can come in or set up.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Jump Kick gives Dodrio a way to threaten Steel- and Rock-types like Aggron and Kabutops, while notably allowing Dodrio to revenge kill Alolan Sandslash under hail. Knock Off provides Dodrio with unresisted coverage and can be used to weaken item-dependent Pokemon such as Mudsdale and Type: Null. Pursuit enables Dodrio to trap weakened offensive foes such as Alolan Raichu and Haunter, further solidifying this set's ability to revenge kill.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf grants Dodrio the ability to outspeed every other relevant Choice Scarf user. Choice Scarf Dodrio can also outspeed weather-reliant Pokemon such as Victreebel, Alolan Sandslash, and Ludicolo in addition to setup sweepers like +2 Omastar and Combusken.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Pursuit in order to trap weakened threats or Pokemon weak to Pursuit such as Oricorio-G and Haunter. This works out especially well if one decides to not reveal Choice Scarf until mid or late-game when Dodrio's checks are weakened, as this allows Dodrio to get the jump on foes like Alolan Raichu, Floatzel, and opposing Choice Scarf users like Scyther and Primeape. Knock Off can be used to weaken defensive checks early-game; however, avoid reckless use of such moves, as Pokemon like Aggron can switch into these moves easily. Prediction plays an important role when using this set, as Dodrio is incredibly frail and will not be able to do much to targets if it isn't locked into the best move. Late-game, Dodrio can liberally spam its STAB moves for optimal damage output once Rock- and Steel-type checks such as Omastar and Aggron are removed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Hitmonchan act as solid answers to Steel- and Rock-types like Aggron and Aurorus, and their removal allows Dodrio to use its STAB moves far more freely. Dodrio greatly appreciates specially offensive wallbreakers such as Aurorus, Drampa, and Jellicent to punch holes through physically defensive walls like Regirock, Mudsdale, and Carbink. Entry hazard setters such as Mudsdale, Regirock, and Qwilfish are pivotal to Choice Scarf Dodrio's role as a revenge killer, as they're able to wear down the opposing team to help Dodrio secure KOs. These examples are also able to cripple the opposing team with moves like Toxic and Scald. Since Dodrio will be coming in and out to pick off weakened threats, entry hazard removal from the likes of Skuntank and Alolan Sandslash is important so as to not let Dodrio be worn down. Lurantis can breeze past checks to Dodrio such as Sableye, Mudsdale, and Carracosta, while Silvally-Dragon can chip at physical walls with a powerful Draco Meteor and provide momentum for Dodrio through Parting Shot.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Jump Kick enables Dodrio to hit Rock- and Steel-types that resist its other moves such as Regirock, Aggron, and Aurorus. Return is a safe STAB option with no recoil; this is also Dodrio's strongest move against Electric-types like Oricorio-E and Lanturn. Quick Attack gives Dodrio a form of priority and does a solid amount to would-be revenge killers like Choice Scarf Primeape and Jynx, OHKOing the latter at +2.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Flyinium Z turns Brave Bird into Supersonic Skystrike, negating Brave Bird's hefty recoil and enabling Dodrio to OHKO targets such as Mudsdale and Ferroseed at +2 and Pokemon like Skuntank and Golurk without any boosts. Fightinium Z converts Jump Kick into All-Out Pummeling, allowing Dodrio to whistle past checks like Regirock and Carracosta, OHKOing both of them at +2 after Stealth Rock damage. This is also the item of choice when using Quick Attack over Return as to maximize damage against Electric-types such as Eelektross and Lanturn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dodrio should mainly be brought in through slow pivots or double switches to minimize chances of Dodrio getting chipped and generate good matchups. Dodrio can also switch into Ghost- and Ground-type attacks thanks to its immunities, though this is a risky endeavor due to its lousy defenses. Setting up with Swords Dance safely can be achieved against Pokemon that are forced out like Tangela and Lurantis, passive walls like Audino and Clefairy, and Choice-locked Pokemon like Jellicent. Avoid late-game setup if Dodrio lacks Quick Attack for faster revenge killers or if Pokemon that resist or are immune to Quick Attack such as Lycanroc and Choice Scarf Haunter are still around. Swords Dance doesn't necessarily have to be used in order for Dodrio to wallbreak; Dodrio's respective Z-Move can be thrown right off the bat to ensure that Pokemon like Simisear and Aggron drop. This is also effective at punishing Pokemon that may stay in predicting a Swords Dance. Outside of Swords Dance, Dodrio can be used as a revenge killer against slower Pokemon such as Scyther and unboosted Omastar. Dodrio's revenge killing capabilities are further bolstered against bulkier foes like Articuno and Stoutland through the use of Z-Crystals.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky pivots such as Lanturn and Alolan Persian are able to bring Dodrio in as safely as possible and lure in Pokemon such as Roselia and Poliwrath for Dodrio to take advantage of. Lanturn and Alolan Persian are also solid switch-ins to moves such as Swannaâ€™s Scald and Lycanroc's Stone Edge, respectively. Fighting-types such as Primeape and Gurdurr have amazing offensive synergy with Dodrio, as they can pressure Rock- and Ice-types such as Lycanroc and Abomasnow, while Dodrio can dispatch Pokemon like Tangela and Scyther in return. Hitmonchan can also remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin and switch into Pokemon such as Aurorus. Mudsdale, Torterra, and other Pokemon that are able to switch in on Rock-types can stomach hits from the likes of Lycanroc, which may attempt to revenge kill Dodrio. Entry hazard removal from the likes of Alolan Sandslash and Cryogonal keep Stealth Rock off of Dodrio's side, keeping it healthy and giving it more chances to set up or attack. Sponges to attacks such as Tangela, Mudsdale, and Metang are able to switch into Choice Scarf users that can revenge kill Dodrio like Kabutops, Primeape, and Jynx. Additional team support can be used to give Dodrio as many setup opportunities as possible. Jellicent and Sableye can cripple physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp, allowing Dodrio to set on weakened Pokemon like Scyther and Type: Null. Skuntank's Memento reduces the amount of damage Dodrio takes and provides momentum.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off gives Dodrio the ability to chip at and weaken switch-ins like Regirock and Metang by removing their items. Pursuit allows Dodrio to trap slower, weakened foes like Oricorio-G and offensive Jellicent. With a Choice Band, Dodrio is notably able to do around 70% to bulky Oricorio-G, securing an OHKO after Stealth Rock and slight residual damage. Quick Attack picks off weakened Pokemon that can otherwise outspeed Dodrio such as Choice Scarf Swanna and Primeape.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band allows Dodrio to immediately wallbreak, 2HKOing Pokemon like Ferroseed and OHKOing the likes of Golurk and Aggron right off the bat.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Given how most players maneuver around Dodrio's other sets, Choice Band's increase in power can be utilized to grab KOs on bulky Pokemon such as Stoutland and Gurdurr far more easily, as they may stay in fearing the possibility of Swords Dance. Pursuit should be used on predicted switches; for instance, Dodrio can OHKO Pokemon like Haunter and offensive Oricorio-G courtesy of Choice Band. If necessary, Dodrio can occasionally switch into moves like Golurk's Earthquake and Oricorio-G's Revelation Dance, but you must exercise caution when doing so because of Dodrio's poor bulk. Brave Bird's recoil can be put to use late-game by allowing Dodrio to KO itself, creating momentum for its team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pivots such as Lanturn and Alolan Persian can generate momentum for Dodrio and are able to bait in Pokemon such as Lurantis and Gurdurr. Choice Band Dodrio can form an offensive core with specially offensive wallbreakers such as Drampa, Jellicent, and Rotom-F, as these Pokemon target physically defensive walls like Regirock and Sableye, while Dodrio can break through Pokemon like Audino, Lurantis, and Hitmonchan in return. Entry hazard removal from the likes of Skuntank and Alolan Sandslash keeps Stealth Rock off the field, increasing the number of times Dodrio can switch in. Fighting-types like Gurdurr and Hitmonchan are able to dispatch Steel- and Rock-types early on, allowing Dodrio to use its STAB moves more frequently. Hitmonchan can also remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin. Pivots like Lanturn and Silvally-Dragon bring Dodrio in as safely as possible and can lure in Pokemon such as Lurantis and Clefairy. These two Pokemon can also weaken bulky walls like Regirock and Mudsdale. Late-game sweepers such as Lycanroc and Combusken greatly appreciate Dodrio's wallbreaking and the removal or weakening of Pokemon like Mudsdale and Lanturn.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Dewgong is completely outclassed as a bulky Water-type by Pokemon like Lanturn and Jellicent due to their better typing and lack of Stealth Rock weakness. Jellicent also has reliable recovery, and both have more valuable utility options such as Volt Absorb and Heal Bell for Lanturn, as well as Taunt and Will-O-Wisp for Jellicent. Dewgong's awful defensive typing also makes it extremely passive, so it can't even utilize its niche to the fullest extent; While it can be used on stall as a Perish trapper, Pyukumuku has a more valuable role on stall as a trapper with Block that can wear down opposing Pokemon with Toxic, punish setup sweepers with Unaware, and use reliable recovery in Recover.</p>",
    "sets": {"Perish Trapper": {"description": "<p>The main goal of this set is to trap passive and defensive Pokemon and stall them out with Rest until they inevitably fall to Perish Song. This seems good on paper, but in actual play, this niche isn't important enough to separate Dewgong from Pyukumuku, which fills almost the same role as Dewgong but does a better job of it due to its massive defensive stats, better typing in pure Water, and lack of Stealth Rock weakness. Recover is also far more consistent as a form of recovery. This set is also extremely vulnerable to Pokemon that carry Taunt, which completely shut Dewgong down and render it useless.</p>"}},

  "Muk": {
    "overview": "<p>Muk carves a niche in the metagame as a capable bulky setup sweeper thanks to its access to Curse, managing to separate itself from other bulky setup sweepers like Spiritomb and Type: Null because of its inability to be crippled by Trick, Switcheroo, and Knock Off, courtesy of its ability Sticky Hold. Muk can also serve as a decent check to certain threatening special attackers such as Oricorio-E and Floatzel due to its high special bulk, with its typing also allowing it to absorb Toxic Spikes. Because of its high Attack, powerful STAB Gunk Shot, access to Shadow Sneak to slightly mitigate its low Speed, and expansive coverage in moves such as Fire Punch, Ice Punch, and Explosion allowing it to threaten Pokemon like Mawile, Claydol, and Qwilfish, Muk is also capable of pulling off a Choice Band set, standing apart from Skuntank due to its higher Attack and Special Defense as well as its ability to more reliably switch into bulkier Pokemon such as Ferroseed and Clefairy. However, Muk still faces a decent amount of competition as both a setup sweeper and an offensive Poison-type. Curse Muk requires a lot more support to work than other bulky setup sweepers like Spiritomb, Type: Null, and Lurantis, while Skuntank tends to outperform Choice Band Muk due to its higher Speed, secondary Dark typing that allows it to threaten Ghost- and Psychic-types, and greater utility. Muk's typing isn't very good offensively, and it struggles to break through certain Steel-, Ground-, and Ghost-types like Aggron, Mudsdale, and Spiritomb because of this. Choice Band Muk is also relatively easy to exploit because of how common bulkier Pokemon like Qwilfish are. Despite Shadow Sneak slightly mitigating Muk's low Speed, it will still often have to take a hit before dishing one out in response. Finally, Muk is vulnerable to strong physical attackers like Zangoose because of its low Defense.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Assault Vest can be used in order to give Muk an easier time taking special attacks from Oricorio-E while still maintaining offensive presence and not being locked into any of its moves, but this leaves Muk much weaker. Focus Punch is an option, possibly in tandem with Fightinium Z or Substitute, that can KO certain Rock- and Steel-types such as Regirock, Lycanroc, Aggron, and Probopass that Muk lures in, but it is very reliant on prediction in order to function properly. Special attacks like Fire Blast and Giga Drain can catch certain checks like Mawile and Omastar off guard, but Muk's mediocre Special Attack prevents these attacks from being very strong or useful. Though these moves hit the previously mentioned Pokemon harder, Choice Band Muk can potentially break through both of these Pokemon with Fire Punch and Explosion, both of which are more consistent moves overall. Memento is an interesting support option that can be used over Explosion, though Muk's low Speed and difficulty finding room for it prevent it from being an efficient user of the move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: While they don't appreciate switching in on Explosion or Ice Punch, bulkier Ground-types such as Mudsdale and Claydol are capable of taking at least one hit from Muk and retaliating with a super effective STAB attack. Mudsdale can also take advantage of any attack Muk uses besides Explosion or Ice Punch due to Stamina increasing its Defense. More offensive Ground-types such as Alolan Dugtrio and Golurk outspeed and OHKO Muk, though they can't switch in as reliably and can be KOed by Shadow Sneak after taking enough prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Aggron and Probopass are immune to Poison-type moves and can switch in on everything else rather well.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Jynx threaten to KO Muk with Psyshock, though it can't switch in safely and can be revenge killed by Shadow Sneak after acquiring enough damage beforehand.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ghost-types</strong>: Bulky Ghost-types like Spiritomb, Sableye, and bulky Oricorio-G don't take very much from Choice Band Muk's Gunk Shot and can put Curse Muk to a complete stop with Taunt. Spiritomb and Sableye can also burn Muk with Will-O-Wisp, while Calm Mind Spiritomb and bulky Oricorio-G can even set up alongside Curse Muk. However, Oricorio-G needs to watch out for Ice Punch and Shadow Sneak from Choice Band variants.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Muk's merely decent Defense and low Speed leave it vulnerable to faster, powerful physical attackers such as Lycanroc, which can easily use Swords Dance against Curse Muk, as well as Kangaskhan. They may face issues with KOing Curse Muk after it obtains enough Defense boosts, however. In addition, even though Muk's special bulk is high, strong special attackers like Aurorus are still capable of 2HKOing it.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Bulky Rock-types like Regirock, Omastar, and Carracosta take very little damage from any of Muk's attacks and can easily set Stealth Rock against it, with Omastar being able use both variants of Muk as setup fodder if it isn't locked into Thunder Punch. Lycanroc can easily switch into Fire Punch from Choice Band variants as well as an unboosted Poison Jab from Curse Muk and set up with Swords Dance. Choice Specs Aurorus is capable of 2HKOing even Curse Muk and can handle any attack Muk throws at it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rest + Sleep Talk": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Curse increases Muk's lackluster Defense and already decent Attack, which allows it to outlast threatening physical attackers that it would otherwise have issues with like Kabutops. Poison Jab is Muk's only attacking move, becoming fairly powerful after Muk accrues enough boosts. Poison Jab is chosen over Gunk Shot due to the former's higher accuracy and higher PP making it more reliable. Poison Jab also boasts a decent chance to poison the opposing Pokemon, which is useful for a set of this nature due to it lessening the need to attack in some instances and potentially providing Muk with more opportunities to focus on setting up. Rest gives Muk a means of recovery that also allows it to heal status conditions, at the cost of incapacitating it for a few turns. Sleep Talk allows Muk to use one of its attacks while it is asleep, preventing it from being helpless after using Rest. It also allows Muk to freely absorb sleep-inducing moves from Pokemon like Tangela.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The investment in HP and Special Defense in combination with a Careful nature maximizes Muk's special bulk, allowing it to more reliably take on threatening special attackers like Swanna. Leftovers gives Muk a form of passive recovery, which lessens the need to use Rest. Sticky Hold allows Muk to easily take Knock Off from Pokemon like Audino and Gurdurr and prevents Muk from being crippled by Trick from Pokemon such as Rotom-F and Jellicent.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early-game, Muk should primarily be used to sponge special attacks from Pokemon like Floatzel and Swanna due to its high special bulk as well as pivot into Knock Off and Toxic from Pokemon such as Eelektross and Audino. Do not attempt to set up until all Steel-types have been removed, as they are immune to Muk's only attacking move. Muk should also wait until bulky Ghost- and Ground-types like Sableye and Mudsdale as well as Taunt users like Qwilfish have been removed. After Muk's checks and counters have been removed, it should attempt to use Curse against passive foes like Audino and Clefairy that cannot do much to it in return, as well as weaker special attackers like Manectric. Avoid Encore and Taunt from Pokemon such as Audino and Skuntank, since both moves render Muk completely useless. Take advantage of Sleep Talk and Muk's enhanced special bulk by switching it into special attackers with sleep-inducing moves like Bellossom.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to its general lack of offensive presence prior to using Curse, Muk fits best on bulkier, defensive teams as a bulky late-game sweeper that can also absorb Toxic Spikes as well as Knock Off and Trick, all of which can hinder these teams. Probopass pairs well with Muk due to its ability to easily trap and dispose of Steel-types like Mawile courtesy of Magnet Pull and set Stealth Rock. Muk appreciates being paired with Pursuit trappers like Spiritomb, since they can remove Ghost-types like Golurk and Oricorio-G. Spiritomb can also cripple physical wallbreakers with Will-O-Wisp and potentially lure Gurdurr before beating it with Psychic. Physically bulky Pokemon such as Tangela and Torterra pair well with Muk, as they are capable of sponging strong physical attacks from the likes of Kabutops for it. These two are also capable of checking Ground-types like Golurk. In return, Muk can take on special attackers like Victreebel for these Pokemon. Cleric support from Pokemon like Audino and Lanturn is useful, since this can wake Muk up and prevent it from having to burn sleep turns itself, which allows it to use Rest again when necessary. Audino is especially notable, since it can also provide Wish support to keep Muk healthy and act as a check to stronger special attackers like Drampa. Muk's ability to check threats to defensive teams like Lurantis and Calm Mind Clefairy is appreciated by teammates such as Pyukumuku, Spiritomb, and Regirock. Muk appreciates being paired with checks to Pokemon like Sableye and Calm Mind Spiritomb due to their ability to pose a threat to the archetypes that Curse Muk fits on, with Clefairy standing out as a premier example. Clefairy can also set Stealth Rock to pressure switch-ins and set up with Calm Mind to wear down bulkier Pokemon, with Muk sponging Knock Off from Sableye in return.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gunk Shot is Muk's strongest Poison-type STAB move, threatening to 2HKO physically bulky foes such as Gurdurr as well as certain Poison-resistant Pokemon like Skuntank. Its low accuracy and PP hinder its reliability, however. Shadow Sneak provides Muk with a form of priority that allows it to revenge kill Pokemon such as Haunter and Oricorio-G as well as weakened frailer Pokemon like Alolan Dugtrio. Thunder Punch enables Muk to threaten Qwilfish and Omastar, while Fire Punch gives Muk coverage for Steel-types such as Metang, Ferroseed, and Mawile. Ice Punch allows Muk to threaten certain Ground-types such as Claydol, Mudsdale, and Golurk, though it must be used on the switch to be effective. Explosion can be used over Ice Punch to give Muk a 250-Base Power attack that threatens to deal heavy damage to Pokemon like Qwilfish at the cost of Muk itself. It is important to note that Muk must catch Qwilfish on the switch with it in order for the lure to work, since Qwilfish outspeeds Muk. Poison Jab can be used instead of Gunk Shot as a more reliable STAB move, though it isn't as strong as Gunk Shot and doesn't achieve the previously mentioned 2HKOs that Gunk Shot does.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The investment in Attack in combination with an Adamant nature and a Choice Band maximizes Muk's offensive presence, with 52 Speed EVs being used so that Muk outspeeds defensive Torterra. The remainder of the EVs are poured into HP to increase Muk's mixed bulk. Sticky Hold allows Muk to freely switch into Trick and Switcheroo as well as take Knock Off from Pokemon such as Audino and Gurdurr with fewer issues. Alternatively, Poison Touch can be used to give Muk's contact moves a chance to poison non-Steel- and non-Poison-type Pokemon, which gives Muk an easier time wearing them down.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is geared towards wallbreaking and should mainly be used to punch holes in teams early- or mid-game. It is important to note that Muk isn't very powerful when it isn't either using Gunk Shot or hitting a foe super effectively, which can hamper its ability to wallbreak. Due to Muk being Choice-locked, prediction plays a heavy part in its success; for example, should Muk predict a Ground-type like Mudsdale to switch in, it should use Ice Punch, and if it predicts Qwilfish to switch in, it should use Thunder Punch. Once all Poison-resistant and -immune Pokemon have been removed, Muk should prioritize using Gunk Shot, as there will be very little to prevent it from doing so by this point. Against teams relying solely on Pokemon like Skuntank to check Poison-types, it is safer to simply chip away at them with Gunk Shot. Recklessly switching Muk into attacks is ill-advised due to its lack of recovery and only middling bulk, though it can switch in on certain special attackers like Eelektross as well as certain passive Pokemon like Clefairy. Refrain from using Explosion until you are certain that Muk has served its purpose and wish to heavily damage Pokemon that aren't Ghost-type, since Muk can only use it once.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Probopass makes for an amazing teammate due to its ability Magnet Pull, since it can trap and dispose of problematic Steel-types like Mawile that can prevent Muk from safely locking into Gunk Shot. Probopass can also set up Stealth Rock, while its slow Volt Switch is useful for preserving Muk's HP. Eelektross also pairs fairly well with Muk, as it can bring Muk in safely with a slow Volt Switch, pressure defensive cores with its coverage, and pivot into Ground-type attacks due to its ability in Levitate, while Muk can heavily damage Pokemon that Eelektross tends to bait in like Hitmonchan and Audino in return. Fighting-types like Gurdurr and Primeape can also threaten and remove Steel-types as well as bulky Rock-types like Regirock and Carracosta, and they appreciate Muk potentially luring in Musharna. Dark-types and Pursuit trappers such as Spiritomb and Absol pair well with Muk, as they can remove Ghost- and Psychic-types and give Muk an easier time with breaking. Absol can also provide Knock Off support and potentially lure in Steel-types and opposing Spiritomb and KO them with Superpower and Play Rough, respectively. Power-Up Punch Kangaskhan is a good partner, since it can break through checks it shares with Muk, such as Regirock, Carracosta, Sableye, and Omastar. In return, Muk can absorb Toxic Spikes for it, preventing its longevity from being shortened. Strong special wallbreakers like Aurorus and Floatzel pair well with Muk due to their ability to easily remove Pokemon like Qwilfish, with Floatzel additionally being able to offensively check Ground-types and other fast threats like Lycanroc for Muk. Entry hazards are useful for placing pressure on Muk's checks, making setters of them like Torterra and Ferroseed good partners. Late-game sweepers and cleaners like Carracosta, Lycanroc, and Victreebel appreciate Muk making their job easier by punching massive holes into the opposing team and potentially weakening checks. Muk can also switch into and pressure other checks to them like Tangela, Eelektross, and Articuno.</p>"

  "Haunter": {
    "overview": "<p>Haunter is an overall decent offensive threat, being able to serve as a wallbreaker with its Life Orb set or as a revenge killer with its Choice Scarf set. This is mostly thanks to its good base 95 Speed tier, which allows it to outspeed Pokemon such as Oricorio-E and Rotom-F and Speed tie with Pokemon such as Jynx and Primeape, and its threatening Special Attack. Furthermore, Haunterâ€™s good Ghost / Poison typing allows it to hit almost the entire metagame neutrally with STAB attacks and combines with Levitate to give Haunter three useful immunities in Ground, Normal, and Fighting. Haunter also has a vast utility movepool that includes moves such as Destiny Bond, Trick, Will-O-Wisp, and Substitute, which allows it to better handle its checks and support its teammates. Despite this, Dark-types are always a large problem for Haunter, as Skuntank resists both of its STAB moves while Spiritomb can bypass Substitute, and both can Pursuit trap Haunter or threaten it with Sucker Punch, although they do fear certain utility or coverage moves. Haunter's abysmal defenses leave it unable to switch into even most resisted hits, and it can be easily revenge killed by faster threats and priority users assuming it does not have a Substitute up. This also makes it tricky to use as a spinblocker, as it fears moves such as Hitmonchan's Thunder Punch. Finally, Haunter faces competition from Oricorio-G, which boasts access to Calm Mind, better bulk, reliable recovery in Roost, and Dancer to give it an even better matchup against Bellossom.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Specs set supplies Haunter with more power as a wallbreaker, although this set is much easier to Pursuit trap compared to the Life Orb set, which accomplishes the same goal while having access to utility moves. A combination of Life Orb, Substitute, and Pain Split can be run as a means to weaken bulkier foes, giving Haunter a good matchup against bulkier teams while also supplying it with a form of recovery, which can especially useful due to Haunter's low HP stat. However, it is overall unreliable, as it leaves Haunter dependent on the amount of health the foe has remaining. Substitute can also be run alongside Disable to potentially stop Skuntank from using Pursuit or simply to immobilize Choice-locked Pokemon, although it is situational compared Haunter's other utility options. Disable can also be run with Protect for a similar effect while allowing Haunter to also switch out against Spiritomb, but it is even more situational otherwise. Reflect Type ideally removes Haunter's weakness to Dark, serving as another way for Haunter to switch out against Pursuit users such as Skuntank. Despite this, Haunter still takes decent damage from Pursuit due to its low bulk, and it is still OHKOed by Black Glasses Spiritomb on the switch. Hex can be run over Shadow Ball on the Life Orb set, as it benefits from Will-O-Wisp and the potential poison from Sludge Bomb, which allows it to hit harder, although at the cost of less immediate damage. Haunter has access to various coverage options, such as Energy Ball and Hidden Power Fighting, which allow it to hit Pokemon like Carracosta and Alolan Sandslash. However, they have little usage outside of those select Pokemon, and Haunter prefers utility. Taunt allows Haunter to better handle certain bulky Pokemon such as Type: Null but is much more situational compared to its other utility options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Skuntank and Spiritomb threaten Haunter with their priority in Sucker Punch and ability to trap it with Pursuit. Spiritomb also bypasses Substitute, while Skuntank, along with Pawniard, resists both of Haunterâ€™s STAB moves. Other Dark-types include Alolan Raticate, Absol, Shiftry, and Liepard. However, all of these do fear switching into coverage from Haunter or being burned by Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Haunter's low defenses, it can be revenge killed relatively easily by Pokemon that outspeed it like Dodrio, Floatzel, and Swanna. However, these Pokemon have to watch out for Choice Scarf Haunter if they are not holding a Choice Scarf themselves. They can also struggle to revenge kill Haunter if it manages to keep a Substitute up.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Priority users such as Kangaskhan, Abomasnow, and Kabutops bypass Haunterâ€™s high Speed and can pick it off after some previous damage. Sucker Punch users such as Kecleon and Mawile are notable, as the move can OHKO Haunter, but they must be wary of Substitute or Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon such as Audino, Eelektross, and Kecleon can take a hit from Haunter while dealing a good amount of damage in return. Pokemon like Type: Null can be brought in to take a hit before using U-turn for a better matchup. However, all of these Pokemon can be crippled through Trick or Haunterâ€™s other utility moves.</p>",

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dazzling Gleam provides coverage for Dark-types like Absol and Alolan Raticate, while also dealing decent damage to Skuntank, especially if it's caught on the switch. Hidden Power Ground is specifically used to 2HKO Skuntank on the switch. It can also hit foes such as Aggron and Probopass for super effective damage. Destiny Bond allows Haunter to take a foe down with it if it is KOed, ideally after it has been weakened a reasonable amount through means such as its Life Orb. It can also be used to eliminate Dark-types trying to Pursuit trap Haunter such as Spiritomb. Substitute is an alternative that allows Haunter to better take on faster foes that could otherwise come in to revenge kill it. It can also create mind games when facing Sucker Punch users such as Skuntank, but not Spiritomb. Will-O-Wisp is another option for the last slot, as it can be used to cripple physical foes such as Hitmonchan. It is also another way for Haunter to play around Skuntank and Spiritomb, as it bypasses Sucker Punch and cripples them both, even allowing Haunter to barely take non-Black Glasses Jolly Skuntankâ€™s Pursuit when switching out and potentially survive Spiritomb's too.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb gives all of Haunter's attacks a boost at the cost of recoil, a downside that is not always significant due to Haunter's poor defenses. Levitate is Haunter's only ability, giving it an immunity to Ground-type attacks, which can make Pokemon like Choice Band Mudsdale think twice before they lock themselves into Earthquake.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Haunter can utilize its good STAB coverage to serve as a wallbreaker against foes such as Clefairy and Mudsdale. Furthermore, due to its high Speed, it can also serve as a revenge killer for foes such as Qwilfish and Oricorio-G. However, if the opponent has a threat such as Skuntank or Spiritomb ready to switch in, Haunter can predict the switch and go for Hidden Power Ground or Dazzling Gleam instead to 2HKO it. However, stay aware that both cause mind games with their combination of Sucker Punch and Pursuit, although Spiritomb is less affected due to the fact that it can bypass Substitute. Therefore, another option is to make a double switch and have teammates weaken these foes until Haunter can KO. If they are brought in, Destiny Bond is an option that can take them down with Haunter if they are a threat to the rest of the team or if you predict them to take out Haunter with Pursuit. Destiny Bond can be similarly used against any other threat, ideally when Haunter is at low health. Substitute can be set up against passive Pokemon such as Clefairy or upon a forced switch like against Primeape Choice-locked into Close Combat. It can also be used to take advantage of attacks like Skuntank's Sucker Punch or to scout for what move slower Choice item Pokemon such as Drampa will lock themselves into. Haunter should not be brought in expecting to take an attack due to its low defenses. However, it can switch into a predicted utility move, such as Golurk's Stealth Rock, or a move it's immune to such as Claydol's Earth Power, though it has to watch out for coverage from both. It can also be brought in through a slow pivot such as Eelektross or Lanturn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fast Pokemon such as Floatzel and Lycanroc benefit from Haunter's ability to weaken the opposing team, particularly bulkier foes such as Clefairy and Tangela, as it allows them to more easily clean up. Physical wallbreakers such as Aggron can break through special walls that Haunter can struggle against such as Audino and Articuno, while Haunter can help against physical walls such as Mudsdale. Haunter most benefits from checks to Dark-types, especially Pokemon such as Calm Mind Clefairy, which can beat RestTalk Spiritomb one-on-one. Other Dark checks include Primeape and Hitmonchan, both of which can also lure in Pokemon such as Musharna for Haunter. These Fighting-types appreciate Haunter's ability to weaken or KO Spiritomb with Dazzling Gleam or Destiny Bond as well. Entry hazard setters such as Qwilfish, Roselia, Smeargle, and Shuckle appreciate Haunter's immunity to Rapid Spin, which helps keep their hazards on the field. In return, Haunter benefits from the hazards, as Stealth Rock and Spikes can weaken foes while Sticky Web can slow down faster foes. Many of these hazard setters also appreciate Haunter's ability to lure and weaken or potentially eliminate Skuntank, which is a common Defogger. Other Pokemon that are threatened by Dark-types such as Jynx and Alolan Raichu also benefit from this. Slow pivots such as Eelektross and Lanturn can help bring Haunter onto the field safely. Lanturn can also cripple foes with Toxic and serve as a check to revenge killers like Dodrio and Swanna.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Destiny Bond is for when Haunter is greatly weakened, as it allows Haunter to potentially take a threat down with it. However, Haunter does not appreciate being locked into it, especially since foes can use it as setup fodder. Trick is used to cripple bulky Pokemon that may try to switch in on Haunter, like Audino and Type: Null, and gives Haunter potentially useful items such as Leftovers and Eviolite. Will-O-Wisp is an alternative that can cripple offensive Pokemon that may try to switch in against Haunter such as Kangaskhan and Scyther. It even allows Haunter to take a Pursuit from a non-Black Glasses Jolly Skuntank, and potentially Spiritomb, if switching out at full health.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf allows Haunter to outspeed foes such as Choice Scarf Kabutops while Speed tying with Pokemon like +1 Jynx and Choice Scarf Primeape. Levitate makes Haunter immune to all Ground-type attacks, Spikes, and Sticky Webs.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Haunter is best used as a revenge killer or late-game cleaner. However, Haunter can also utilize its good offensive typing to serve as an offensive check to various Pokemon such as Golurk, Alolan Raichu, and Tangela throughout the game. Haunter should be brought in after a teammate has been KOed or through a slow pivot such as Lanturn or Eelektross; due to its low bulk, Haunter should rarely be switched directly into an attack, even resisted ones. If switching into an immunity, it should still watch out for coverage such as Gurdurr's Knock Off. Haunter similarly can be switched into a predicted harmless status move such as Clefairy's Stealth Rock or Soft-Boiled, but it still has to watch out for moves like Thunder Wave. When Haunter is brought in, stay aware of what checks the opponent has for it, as it will be locked into the same move until it is switched out. This is especially important if their switch-ins include Pursuit users such as Skuntank and Spiritomb, which can Pursuit trap Haunter with ease if they manage to come in when it is locked into a resisted move. If Dark-types pose a threat to the rest of your team, Haunter can use Destiny Bond in such situations. Destiny Bond can also be used to take out any other potential threats to the team or pick off a foe late-game if Haunter is weakened or has no more use. On the other hand, be careful when using Destiny Bond, as it can be exploited by the opponent and be a huge momentum drain. Watch out for any potential Choice Scarf users with naturally higher Speed such as Dodrio and Swanna, as they could otherwise lure Haunter in, thinking it can outspeed. If facing bulkier teams, in which case Haunter's Choice Scarf is not needed, Haunter can use Trick to switch between moves and potentially cripple a foe in the process.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Haunter works well on offensive and balance teams in need of a way to keep faster foes in check. Wallbreakers such as Aurorus and Kangaskhan can help weaken the opposing team before Haunter comes in to clean. They can also help against some walls that give Haunter trouble, such as Articuno and Audino, while in return Haunter can cripple Pokemon that wall them such as Type: Null and Regirock with Trick. Haunter also struggles against Dark-types, so checks to them such as Silvally-Fairy, Gurdurr, and Hitmonchan are vital. The latter two also appreciate Haunter's ability to offensively check Psychic-, Fairy- and Ghost-types such as Musharna, Alolan Raichu, and Oricorio-G. Similarly, Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types such as Carracosta, Lycanroc, and Mudsdale benefit from Haunterâ€™s ability to check Grass-types such as Lurantis and Tangela. All three can serve as wallbreakers or provide Stealth Rock to weaken foes, depending on their set. The former two also value Haunter's immunity to Fighting and Ground, although due to Haunter's poor bulk, more reliable checks such as Claydol are recommended. Slow pivots such as Eelektross, Lanturn and Type: Null can get Haunter onto the field safely. Eelektross also has access to Knock Off, which can cripple Eviolite and Assault Vest users such as Type: Null and Hitmonchan. Finally, Haunter can be run alongside other Pokemon that often use Choice Scarf such as Swanna, as this can create mind games for the opponent.</p>"

  "Electrode": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to a phenomenal Speed stat and access to both Reflect and Light Screen, Electrode is able to set itself apart from PU's other Electric-types as the best dual screens user in the tier, functioning as a potent lead for hyper offense teams. Electrode also is the fastest user of Taunt in PU and can deny opposing Taunt from the likes of Jellicent and Lycanroc, prevent the use of Defog to clear Reflect and Light Screen from the field, and obstruct setup from sweepers such as Oricorio-E and Bellossom to compensate for its lack of offensive presence. Electrode's access to Explosion and Volt Switch allows it to instantly generate momentum for its team and maximizes the number of turns Electrode's teammates can utilize before screens wear off, though Explosion will sacrifice Electrode in the process. Unfortunately, Electrode is only viable on screens-based hyper offense teams and is outclassed offensively by other Electric-types such as Oricorio-E and Alolan Raichu due to their greater offensive stats, more expansive movepools, secondary typing, and access to setup moves in the form of Calm Mind and Nasty Plot, respectively. Screens-based hyper offense teams are heavily reliant on offensive pressure to function and, as a result, are inconsistent against teams that have enough defensive checks to common breakers and setup sweepers. Electrode is also vulnerable to Prankster users such as Liepard and Sableye, as they can use Taunt on Electrode before it can get up Reflect and Light Screen. Choice Scarf Primeape is also able to outspeed Electrode and restrict it to only setting up one screen by threatening it with Close Combat, while Ground-type Stealth Rock setters such as Mudsdale and Golurk can punish Electrode with Earthquake if it opts to use Taunt.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Electrode can use an offensive Choice Specs or Life Orb set with Thunderbolt, Volt Switch, Hidden Power Grass, and either Signal Beam or Explosion, but Electrode is outclassed offensively by other Electric-types such as Manectric and Alolan Raichu due to the former's access to Overheat and Switcheroo and the latter's access to Nasty Plot. A Rain Dance set could also be used to support Swift Swim users such as Ludicolo and Kabutops; however, Electrode faces heavy competition in this role from Liepard and Volbeat due to their access to the Prankster ability, U-turn, and additional utility in the form of Encore. Volbeat in particular can use its slow U-turn to provide teammates with a safe switch in without having to sacrifice itself in the process, which is something Electrode cannot replicate even with Volt Switch or Explosion. Magic Coat can be used instead of Taunt to reflect Spikes, Taunt, and Toxic instead of denying them outright and allows Electrode to beat Prankster Taunt users such as Sableye. However, Taunt's ability to prevent the use of status moves and Defog across multiple turns is more beneficial, as it eases prediction. Similarly, Toxic can be used to wear down bulkier walls such as Gastrodon and Assault Vest Lanturn, allowing offensive teammates like Primeape and Oricorio-E to sweep more easily. However, Electrode is unable to prevent Defog, Toxic, and setup moves without Taunt, so this is generally an inferior option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-immune Pokemon</strong>: Ground-types like Mudsdale and Golurk can 2HKO Electrode through Reflect, preventing it from denying Stealth Rock without risking the KO in the process. Additionally, Pokemon with access to Volt Absorb like Lanturn can prevent Electrode from pivoting out to one of its teammates via Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Primeape is able to outspeed Electrode with the use of a Choice Scarf and threaten a 2HKO, forcing Electrode to choose between either Reflect or Light Screen. Prankster users like Liepard and Sableye can consistently outspeed Electrode and shut it down with a fast Taunt. Sableye in particular is also immune to Electrode's Explosion and can cripple switch-ins with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: While Knock Off doesn't prevent Electrode from setting up screens, it does reduce the duration of Reflect and Light Screen to only five turns. This makes it harder for Electrode and its teammates to capitalize on the defensive utility provided.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Taunt is primarily used to block Defog, which could otherwise clear dual screens from the field, but it also has a multitude of other uses in preventing opposing leads from setting entry hazards, denying status moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave, which could otherwise hamper Electrode's partners from setting up, and impeding opposing setup sweepers such as Omastar from taking advantage of Electrode's passive nature. Explosion is used to keep up momentum after setting screens, providing a one-time pivot option that brings teammates in as safely as possible and preserves the maximum number of Light Screen and Reflect turns. Volt Switch is an alternative option that keeps Electrode alive after pivoting but has the downside of being blocked by many prevalent Pokemon with Electric immunities such as Lanturn and Mudsdale, making Explosion the better choice most of the time. Volt Switch will also typically force one of Electrode's partners to take a hit upon switching in, though this is mitigated to some extent by the defense buff provided by dual screens.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum EVs are put into HP to bolster Electrode's defensive capabilities and ensure that both screens are successfully set up, as investing in the power of Electrode's Explosion is unnecessary. While a Jolly nature is used to slightly bolster the power of Electrode's Explosion, a Timid nature with minimal attack IVs should be used when running Volt Switch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Electrode is best used as a lead in the majority of games, preventing entry hazards from the opponent's Pokemon with Taunt and setting Reflect and Light Screen to provide early momentum. When faced against specific hazard setters such as Mudsdale, however, alternative leads should be sent out to take advantage of them and conserve Electrode's screens for a later period in the match. It is also preferable to lead with hazard setters when against bulkier teams to provide additional chip damage that can help secure KOs later in the match. After dual screens have been set up, Taunt is likely to have worn off. Using Taunt again instead of immediately pivoting can sometimes be beneficial to deny hazards and supply teammates with a temporary immunity to status moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave from the likes of Metang and Clefairy. After dual screens have been set up, Electrode should look to pivot into a teammate such as Omastar or Stoutland that can take advantage of dual screens as soon as possible to maximize the number of turns in which the defense buff provided by dual screens can be utilized.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Setup sweepers such as Oricorio-E, Carracosta, and Turtonator enjoy the defensive protection Electrode's screens provide, with Oricorio-E in particular taking advantage of Ground-type entry hazard setters like Mudsdale and Torterra that Electrode struggles against. Similarly, bulky wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Aggron also appreciate the defensive utility of dual screens, as it allows them to switch into attacks without suffering heavy damage. Primeape is an especially notable partner, as it can punish the use of Defog thanks to its ability Defiant. Electrode also pairs well with Memento users such as Alolan Dugtrio and Skuntank, as they can grant additional setup opportunities to Electrode's teammates throughout the match. Entry hazards from fast offensive Pokemon like Alolan Dugtrio and Lycanroc can help secure KOs without giving up too much momentum. Alternatively, Stealth Rock users such as Golurk and Alolan Sandslash can be used, with Golurk functioning as a spinblocker and Alolan Sandslash removing hazards with Rapid Spin while also using its typing to check Psychic- and Flying-types for Primeape. Thanks to its typing and bulk, Electrode is able to act as a soft check to Flying-types such as Swanna and Oricorio-E and weaken or KO them, opening the door for wallbreakers such as Victreebel and Oricorio-G to sweep. In return, Victreebel and Oricorio-G check top threats that dual screens teams may otherwise struggle with, such as Primeape and Gurdurr, thanks to the defensive boost provided by Electrode's dual screens.</p>"

  "Exeggutor": {
    "overview": "<p>Exeggutor's high Special Attack combined with its decent movepool makes it a decent wallbreaker or sweeper, which is further enhanced by its access to Sleep Powder to cripple switch-ins such as Skuntank and Audino. Due to the Trick Room and Choice Specs sets having different counterplay, it can be somewhat hard to deal with, as the former has a good matchup against offensive teams while the latter has a nice matchup against balance builds. This is bolstered by Exeggutor's typing and decent bulk, which allow it to switch into Water-, Grass-, Ground-, Electric-, and Fighting-type attacks from the likes of Poliwrath, Bellossom, Mudsdale, Alolan Raichu, and Hitmonchan, as well as its ability to pressure walls it comes into, such as Gastrodon and Regirock. However, Exeggutor suffers from mediocre speed, leaving it extremely susceptible to faster threats like Skuntank, Aurorus, Dodrio, and Scyther, although this can be remedied with Trick Room. Its STAB moves can be hard to use effectively due to Pokemon like Alolan Sandslash being so common, leaving it extremely reliant on making the right prediction, and even if it does, being locked into a move can be extremely costly. While its typing gives it some opportunities to come in, it also brings weaknesses to common Pokemon such as Simisear and particularly to Pursuit trappers like Skuntank. U-turn from the likes of Primeape is also extremely annoying. Lastly, Exeggutor suffers from competition as an offensive Grass-types from Victreebel, which has a better typing both defensively and offensively, making it way easier for it to simply spam its STAB attacks and giving it more opportunities to come in.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ground can be used over Hidden Power Fire to hit Skuntank harder, but Ferroseed and Alolan Sandslash are more important targets. A set based around Harvest and a Sitrus Berry can be used, but it's extremely unreliable and vulnerable to Knock Off and applies way less offensive pressure, making it extremely passive. Finally, a set based around Chlorophyll can work, but it's heavily outclassed by Victreebel, and sun is a rather mediocre playstyle.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Skuntank pose an immense threat since it can switch in and Pursuit trap Exeggutor. However, Skuntank doesn't appreciate switching in on the Choice Specs set, and dislikes Sleep Powder. Other Dark-types such as Absol and Alolan Raticate can act as checks even under Trick Room thanks to Sucker Punch, although they're susceptible to getting put to sleep when Trick Room is active and neither can switch in.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Walls such as Audino and Articuno are troublesome and make it harder for Exeggutor to sweep or wallbreak. Audino can remove Exeggutor's item thanks to Knock Off, while Articuno can 2HKO it with Freeze-Dry, although they both dislike taking Psyshock from the Choice Specs set.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats and Priority Move Users</strong>: Faster threats such as Simisear and Dodrio can easily revenge kill Exeggutor out of Trick Room. Under Trick Room, priority moves users such as Kangaskhan, which can stall out Trick Room turns with Fake Out, and Abomasnow can revenge kill a slightly weakened Exeggutor, although they risk getting 2HKOed if they switch into an attack.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Coverage such as U-turn from Primeape and Knock Off from Gurdurr can greatly weaken or cripple Exeggutor. This also means that, while it would like to, it can't check them. Other users of these moves like Scyther can also easily OHKO Exeggutor.</p>",

      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room allows Exeggutor to act as a late-game sweeper and take advantage of its poor Speed. Giga Drain can be used over Leaf Storm, as it doesn't force Exeggutor to switch out due to the Special Attack drop if not running Grassium Z. Hidden Power Fire hits Alolan Sandslash and Ferroseed which resists Exeggutor's dual STAB. Alternatively, Sleep Powder cripples switch-ins such as Alolan Sandslash, Audino, and Articuno, giving a partner a free opportunity to come in.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Grassium Z coupled with Leaf Storm gives Exeggutor a nuke to get past threats like slightly weakened Eelektross and even Pokemon that resist it such as Skuntank. It also ignores Leaf Storm's secondary effect of dropping the user's Special Attack. Life Orb is another possible item, as it gives all of Exeggutor's moves a boost in power, notably allowing it to always OHKO specially defensive Alolan Sandslash with Hidden Power Fire, at the cost of losing some of its health every time it attacks and leaving it more susceptible to priority attacks. While Exeggutor isn't holding any Berry, Harvest is chosen to avoid having its Speed boosted by Chlorophyll when facing sun teams.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Exeggutor should get its checks, such as Articuno, whittled down by a teammate before trying to sweep mid- to late-game. It greatly appreciates being brought in safely via a slow U-turn or Volt Switch, as this gives it an easier time setting Trick Room or simply firing off an attack. Exeggutor can also make use of its decent bulk and typing to switch into threats like Hitmonchan, Lurantis, Lanturn, Mudsdale, and Alolan Raichu to set up Trick Room, although it has to be wary of switching into Toxic from some of them. As the Z-Move can only be used once, it should be used carefully. It should be used to get past frailer answers, such as Skuntank and Eelektross, and it shouldn't be used if your opponent has a solid switch-in to it, such as Articuno, Altaria, and Type: Null, as it could go to waste. If Exeggutor is weakened and unable to clean, it can set up Trick Room for another slow partner, such as Assault Vest Crabominable or Mudsdale, to take advantage of it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazards ease Exeggutor's job and allow it to clean more easily, as they help it weaken its checks like Skuntank and Audino. Therefore, Pokemon such as Qwilfish and Regirock make for good options as partners, with the former also being able to punish U-turn from the likes of Scyther if it's holding a Rocky Helmet. In exchange, Exeggutor can break Pokemon that they let in, such as Mudsdale and Gastrodon. Stealth Rock Lycanroc is a good partner; Exeggutor deals with its checks such as Torterra and Mudsdale, while Exeggutor's checks like Articuno and Clefairy lose to Lycanroc. Exeggutor appreciates Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Lanturn, Primeape, as they allow it to come onto the field safely. Lanturn deals with Fire-types like Simisear, provides Heal Bell support, and can cripple Drampa with Toxic; Primeape can offensively check Dark-types like Alolan Persian and can bring Exeggutor in on its checks, such as Gastrodon for Exeggutor, to deal with them. Other special wallbreakers and sweepers can be used alongside Exeggutor for it to get past its checks more easily. Since Dark-types like Skuntank, Alolan Persian, and Absol greatly threaten Exeggutor, answers to them such as Hitmonchan, Gurdurr, and Assault Vest Crabominable work very well alongside it. The latter two can also take advantage of the Trick Room Exeggutor sets, making them even better partners, and Crabominable is able to switch into Ice-types like Aurorus for Exeggutor.</p>"

Hidden Power Fire hits Alolan Sandslash and Ferroseed, which would otherwise wall Exeggutor. Giga Drain gives Exeggutor a secondary STAB attack used when Leaf Storm's power isn't needed. It also partially negates chip damage Exeggutor takes. Sleep Powder is another option, as it can cripple Exeggutor's checks, such as Audino, and Articuno, although being locked into it can result in a huge loss in momentum.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Modest nature allows Exeggutor to hit as hard as possible whereas a Timid nature allows it to outspeed threats such as Jolly Aggron, specially defensive Articuno, and Modest Choice Specs Jellicent.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Exeggutor should be used to wallbreak early- to mid-game for a partner to clean. It can also be used to switch into threats such as Mudsdale, Regirock, and Lurantis thanks to its bulk and typing and proceed to wallbreak, although it has to be cautious of Toxic when switching in. However, even if it can come in directly on certain threats, Exeggutor really appreciates being brought it in via U-turn or Volt Switch. Be cautious of what move you lock Exeggutor into, as using a Psychic move can be costly if your opponent has a Dark-type such as Skuntank, which would Pursuit trap Exeggutor. Locking Exeggutor into Sleep Powder is also not recommended if there's a Pokemon that could take advantage of that, such as Bellossom. Even if Exeggutor is rather slow, it can be used to revenge kill threats such as Aggron and even faster threats like Jellicent and Aurorus if it's using a Timid nature.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Physical wallbreakers work really well alongside Exeggutor. Stoutland is a perfect example, as it can deal with Exeggutor's checks like Articuno, while Exeggutor can deal with Stoutland's checks, such as Regirock. Volt Switch and U-turn users work really well alongside Exeggutor due to their ability to bring in Exeggutor safely. Both Scyther and Primeape work well alongside Exeggutor, and they have a solid offensive synergy. Scyther and Primeape also lure in their checks, such as Regirock, for Exeggutor to deal with. In exchange, they can deal with Dark-types, and the latter can handle Steel-types for Exeggutor. Another good example is Eelektross, which can punish the checks Exeggutor and it have in common with Knock Off. Entry hazards greatly help Exeggutor and make it even harder to switch into. Mudsdale can help check physical attackers like Primeape and Scyther that try and pressure Exeggutor, while Regirock lures in Gurdurr for Exeggutor and takes care of Skuntank. Lastly, Exeggutor appreciates answers to the threats it invites depending on what it locks itself in. Regirock, Mudsdale, and Gurdurr can deal with Skuntank, while Oricorio-E can deal with Scyther.</p>"

  "Hitmonchan": {
    "overview": "<p>Hitmonchan is a solid Pokemon in PU thanks to its amazing role compression. It's an offensive spinner that threatens many of the tier's Stealth Rock setters such as Regirock, Alolan Sandslash, and Aggron while being bulky enough to act as a blanket check to some of the best specially offensive Pokemon such as Aurorus, and it can act as a revenge killer thanks to Mach Punch. While it lacks a method of reliable recovery, it can mitigate this with Drain Punch or a pinch Berry. However, Hitmonchan's limited movepool leaves it unable to deal with Pokemon that can threaten it out of the battle such as Clefairy and Tangela, and it is worn down quickly by entry hazards and status conditions. Unless it runs Toxic or an appropriate coverage move, Hitmonchan is helpless against Ghost-types such as Jellicent and Sableye and other hazard setters such as Roselia and Qwilfish, which can make it an unreliable spinner at times. Hitmonchan is also vulnerable to being revenge killed by physically offensive threats such as Gurdurr, Kangaskhan, and Dodrio because of its low Defense. Gurdurr, in particular, can set up in front of it and take advantage of Toxic by activating Guts.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Band set with Close Combat or Drain Punch / Thunder Punch / Ice Punch / Mach Punch is a usable option to 2HKO Qwilfish and Victreebel, and it has an 85% chance to 2HKO Clefairy. However, this isn't the best set, since it sacrifices Hitmonchan's ability to switch moves when it needs to. Bulk Up can also be considered to break through defensive Pokemon that usually stop Hitmonchan such as Mudsdale. However, this set is performed much better by Gurdurr, since it is bulkier than Hitmonchan thanks to Eviolite, can take advantage of status conditions with Guts, and has Knock Off to further increase its offensive presence. Throat Chop is an offensive option so Hitmonchan can deal super effective damage to Ghost-types like Jellicent and Haunter. However, Thunder Punch and Stone Edge accomplish the same thing against Qwilfish and Jellicent with the added bonus of dealing with Flying-types. Foresight is an interesting tech that allows Hitmonchan to use Rapid Spin against Ghost-types like Golurk and Jellicent and hit them with its Fighting-type moves. However, this move is difficult to fit on a set and only works one turn after use, meaning repeated use is required. Ice Punch is another alternative to beat Pokemon like Claydol, Victreebel, and Golurk but leaves Hitmonchan unable to beat Jellicent and Qwilfish.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Hitmonchan may resist Stealth Rock, but it is still worn down by continually switching into entry hazards to clear them. It also has to be cautious about spinning in front of Rocky Helmet users like Skuntank, since the contact damage also hurts Hitmonchan. Toxic Spikes are especially detrimental, as they can inflict poison damage, which can chip away at Hitmonchan's longevity. Burns from Will-O-Wisp and Scald similarly wear Hitmonchan down further and force offensive sets to lose offensive pressure.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Hitmonchan has limited options for dealing with Ghost-types. While bulky ones such as Jellicent, Sableye, and Spiritomb are crippled by Toxic and offensive ones such as Oricorio-G do not want to risk switching into a potential Stone Edge, Hitmonchan does not want to risk staying in against these Pokemon because they all spinblock it and threaten it out with either status moves or their own powerful STAB moves. Golurk can even set Stealth Rock and block Hitmonchan's efforts to clear them, while Haunter is immune to Toxic and forces Hitmonchan out if it doesn't carry coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Because Hitmonchan lacks super effective coverage to hit them, Pokemon such as Musharna and Alolan Raichu can easily pivot into its Fighting-type moves and force it out with their super effective coverage. They do need to be cautious about potentially switching into Toxic or its coverage moves, however.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Fairy- and Flying-types such as Clefairy, Scyther, and Oricorio-E can threaten Hitmonchan out of battle with their powerful STAB moves. Qwilfish can force Hitmonchan out of the battle with Intimidate or the threat of a Scald burn and proceed to set up its own hazards. Victreebel can also come in against Hitmonchan's Fighting-type moves and weaken it with Strength Sap. Outside of Clefairy and Victreebel, none of these Pokemon want to risk switching into Toxic, Stone Edge, or Thunder Punch, though.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Defensive Pokemon like Gurdurr and Lanturn can easily take any hit Hitmonchan goes for while also Toxic stalling it and proceeding to recover their health. Mudsdale can also wear Hitmonchan down with Toxic and even gain a Defense boost from Hitmonchan's moves. From there, it can threaten out Hitmonchan with its own powerful moves. Mudsdale and non-Heal Bell Lanturn want to avoid Toxic themselves, however.</p> <p><strong>Physically Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Thanks to Hitmonchan's poor physical bulk, offensive Pokemon like Primeape, Kangaskhan, and Dodrio can threaten Hitmonchan but don't want to risk switching into any of its moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Toxic + Iapapa Berry": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Drain Punch serves as both Hitmochan's main STAB attack and primary method of recovering HP, allowing it to continue using Rapid Spin. Mach Punch gives Hitmonchan a way to deal with weakened faster Pokemon such as Lycanroc, Kabutops, and Kangaskhan. Toxic gives Hitmonchan a way to cripple defensive switch-ins such as Jellicent and Sableye.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV investment lets Hitmonchan always OHKO maximum HP Alolan Sandslash with Drain Punch while still having a good chance of avoiding a 2HKO by Timid Choice Scarf Aurorus's Blizzard after hail and Stealth Rock damage. Iapapa Berry gives Hitmonchan an extra form of recovery without relying on Drain Punch. This is especially helpful after switching into entry hazards and powerful Pokemon often.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hitmonchan can try to pivot into Pokemon such as Cryogonal, Audino, and Eelektross, but you should be cautious, because Hitmonchan should still try to be as healthy as possible so it can continue clearing entry hazards for its team. Be mindful of Hitmonchan's HP, since it can only take certain attacks such as Aggron's Head Smash from full HP. Hitmonchan can also come into battle against Stealth Rock users such as Regirock and Alolan Sandslash as they are setting their hazards or with the help of a pivot. Rapid Spin is most likely going to be the most used move, as Hitmonchan should aim to clear its side of the field of entry hazards as soon as possible. Since Hitmonchan often invites Pokemon like Jellicent, Golurk, and Sableye into battle, it can use Toxic as they come in to cripple them. Afterwards, Hitmonchan should try to pivot out because these Pokemon threaten it with their own Toxic or a potential burn from Scald. Once these Pokemon are properly dealt with, Hitmonchan can use Drain Punch to keep itself healthy. Still, be mindful of common Rocky Helmet users such as Skuntank and Qwilfish, as the extra residual damage is detrimental to Hitmonchan's attempt to restore its health with Drain Punch. Skuntank can also wear Hitmonchan down further with Aftermath.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hitmonchan fits on most bulky or balanced teams thanks to its ability to clear entry hazards while threatening Stealth Rock setters like Regirock. Offensive Pokemon that are weak to Stealth Rock such as Simisear, Scyther, and Oricorio-E appreciate Hitmonchan's Rapid Spin support and ability to check Rock-types. These Pokemon can also threaten physically defensive Pokemon like Tangela and Gurdurr for Hitmonchan. Spikes setters like Ferroseed, Qwilfish, and Roselia also pair well with Hitmonchan, since it can remove hazards without removing the Spikes they set. Qwilfish and Roselia can also absorb Toxic Spikes for Hitmonchan. Physically defensive teammates like Aggron, Mudsdale, and Regirock can help Hitmonchan by taking physical attacks aimed at it such as Poison Jab from Skuntank. Aggron and Regirock can also threaten Flying-types for Hitmonchan. Partners like Skuntank, Alolan Persian, and Spiritomb can also be beneficial, since they can help stop the Ghost- and Psychic-types like Golurk and Claydol that wall Hitmonchan. Skuntank can even absorb Toxic Spikes for Hitmonchan, which benefits its longevity. Pivots such as Scyther, Lanturn, and Eelektross can help bring Hitmonchan safely into battle against Pokemon like Drampa, Stoutland, and Audino.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunder Punch can deal super effective damage to bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Qwilfish, which can otherwise spinblock Hitmonchan and set Spikes, respectively. Stone Edge can punish Pokemon like Oricorio-E and Altaria that attempt to switch into Hitmonchan.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed ensures that Hitmonchan will outpace Timid Omastar before Shell Smash and Timid Aurorus.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set turns Hitmonchan into a wallbreaker that can also act as a revenge killer and take care of offensive threats such as Omastar, Stoutland, and Simisear thanks to Mach Punch. Hitmonchan shouldn't be brought in against a direct attack, because this set sacrifices bulk for power. Instead, it should be brought in through aggressive double switches, by using a pivot, on passive Pokemon such as Audino, or after a teammate has fainted. Hitmonchan is most likely going to be using its Fighting-type STAB moves throughout the match, so it will be inviting Pokemon such as Oricorio-G and Jellicent to take these moves. If this is anticipated, Hitmonchan can use one of its coverage moves to punish these Pokemon that attempt to switch directly into it. This play can be especially rewarding given the extra power that Life Orb provides. Clearing entry hazards is still an important role that Hitmonchan provides, although it isn't that durable because of its lack of bulk investment and the recoil from Life Orb. If hazards are clear, Hitmonchan should focus on wallbreaking and revenge killing.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Life Orb Hitmonchan fits on teams that need a check to fast and frail setup sweepers such as Omastar, Lycanroc, and Simisear as well as a spinner. Since Hitmonchan forces many switches, it can take advantage of entry hazards to provide important chip damage. Stealth Rock setters like Aggron, Mudsdale, and Regirock have good synergy with Hitmonchan. Spikes setters like Roselia and Qwilfish also appreciate the fact that Hitmonchan doesn't remove the Spikes they set when it clears hazards. Dark-types like Skuntank, Absol, and Spiritomb are beneficial, as they can properly check the Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Claydol, Jellicent, and Haunter that can give Hitmonchan trouble. Since Hitmonchan isn't as invested in its defenses, having a pivot that can bring it in safely is important. Teammates such as Eelektross, Alolan Persian, and Oricorio-E are decent options for this role. Eelektross can threaten out Jellicent and Qwilfish for Hitmonchan if it chooses to run Stone Edge instead of Thunder Punch. Special attackers such as Haunter, Rotom-F, and Simisear appreciate Hitmonchan's ability to clear hazards and threaten special walls like Type: Null and Eelektross.</p>"
      },
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunder Punch is the primary coverage move to threaten Pokemon like Jellicent, Oricorio-G, and Qwilfish that attempt to switch into Hitmonchan. Stone Edge is a more powerful yet less accurate option to punish Pokemon like Scyther and Oricorio-E.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>156 HP EVs with an Assault Vest guarantee that Hitmonchan survives Modest +2 Omastar's Hydro Pump after Stealth Rock damage. The EVs in Speed allow Hitmonchan to outspeed Choice Specs Modest Jellicent, Aurorus, and Aggron. Alternatively, it can run 196 Speed EVs to outpace Timid Aurorus and Mild Abomasnow. The rest of the EVs are placed into Attack so Hitmonchan can have greater offensive presence combined with an Adamant nature and Iron Fist.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hitmonchan can threaten out Pokemon such as Drampa, Alolan Sandslash, and Aurorus thanks to its STAB attacks, as well as blanket checking powerful special attackers such as Drampa, Omastar, and Rotom-F. Be careful with Hitmonchan's health; it only checks these aforementioned threats for a limited time, since it has a low amount of HP and Drain Punch is not the most reliable recovery move. Make sure Toxic Spikes are also cleared, since Hitmonchan doesn't appreciate being poisoned. After it has come into battle, it should aim to clear away entry hazards if they are present, recover its health lost with Drain Punch, or revenge kill a weakened threat with Mach Punch. However, the opponent could anticipate these moves and go to a Pokemon that resists Hitmonchan's STAB attacks or blocks Rapid Spin such as Oricorio-G, Silvally-Fairy, or Jellicent. If this is anticipated, it would be wise to use one of Hitmonchan's coverage moves to catch these switch-ins off guard. However, Hitmonchan should not stay in against these Pokemon because they can threaten it out with their STAB moves, Toxic, or a burn from Will-O-Wisp or Scald.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Keeping Hitmonchan healthy is a priority so it can continue being a blanket check to strong special attackers. Teammates such as Alolan Persian and Lanturn can help keep Hitmonchan healthy with Z-Parting Shot and Heal Bell, respectively. Having a Poison-type teammate like Skuntank, Qwilfish, or Roselia can also be a good idea, since they absorb Toxic Spikes for Hitmonchan. Qwilfish and Roselia also appreciate Hitmonchan not clearing the Spikes they set when it uses Rapid Spin. Qwilfish can also provide Intimidate support so Hitmonchan has an easier time taking physical attacks. Pursuit trappers like Skuntank and Stoutland can trap Ghost- and Psychic-types that can give Hitmonchan trouble. Physically defensive Pokemon such as Mudsdale and Regirock appreciate Hitmonchan's ability to soft check special attackers. These Pokemon also enjoy Hitmonchan's ability to check Water-type Pokemon such as Omastar, Carracosta, and Ludicolo. Other offensive Pokemon such as Scyther, Dodrio, and Articuno appreciate Hitmonchan's ability to remove Stealth Rock.</p>"

  "Tangela": {
    "overview": "<p>Tangela is capable of providing an amazing defensive presence for teams due to its gargantuan physical bulk that is further supplemented by Eviolite, making it one of the most solid blanket checks to physical attackers in the tier, checking Kangaskhan, Torterra, and Lycanroc. It also has many forms of recovery, with Regenerator being by far its most advantageous trait, allowing it to heal off prior damage with greater efficacy with the HP regained upon switching out, helping it remain healthy. Despite its lack of offensive presence, Tangela can pressure opposing teams with its utility moves such as Knock Off, Sleep Powder, and Leech Seed. Although Tangela's Grass typing is great for the purpose of checking physically offensive Water- and Ground-types, this, unfortunately, comes with weaknesses to extremely prevalent attacking types in Ice, Fire, and Flying, leaving it easily threatened by offensive threats such as Simisear, Aurorus, Eelektross, and Oricorio-G. In addition, Tangela's abysmal Special Defense means that even passive Pokemon with super effective coverage such as Roselia can easily overpower it. Furthermore, it is reliant on Eviolite to function as a blanket check to strong physical attackers, despite its naturally good Defense, and thus is prone to being crippled by certain Pokemon it can be used to deal with, such as Gurdurr and Absol.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic does a fine job of crippling bulky Pokemon in general and is one of Tangela's best options for responding to opposing Grass-types, but choosing this option would require Tangela to forgo one of its other utility or recovery options. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 96 Def / 160 SpD can be used to always survive a hit from Jynx and Eviolite Combusken while still being a physical wall; however, Tangela has to sacrifice a significant amount of Defense in order to use this spread. Tangela can take the route of an offensive pivot and be fairly threatening thanks to Leaf Storm, decent coverage, ability to tank hits against some attackers, and Sleep Powder, but it prefers the role of checking hard-hitting physical attackers, a trait that this set would sacrifice. It also still fails to be very threatening to its strongest checks due to its lack of strong coverage options. Stun Spore is an option for crippling fast switch-ins like Dodrio and Jynx, but it tends to be less consistent than its main utility options. Hidden Power Ice is a viable option that allows Tangela to hit Altaria and Drampa harder, but the move renders Tangela without a means to significantly wear down Alolan Sandslash. A fully specially defensive spread can help take on Pokemon like Lanturn and special Floatzel better, but Tangela usually functions better in the majority of matches as a physical wall. Finally, Worry Seed can be used on movesets with Toxic to quickly wear down and cripple Clefairy, Type: Null, and Spiritomb; it cripples Clefairy by removing its Magic Guard ability and therefore making it vulnerable to Toxic, and it nullifies Type: Null and Spiritomb's recovery option by preventing them from using Rest due to Insomnia. This strategy, however, tends to render Tangela's moveslot less useful in other matchups, and Knock Off, Sleep Powder, and Leech Seed are already plenty useful in crippling these Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types resist both of Tangela's most common attacking moves, and its best way of chipping at them is the uncommon Hidden Power Ice, making these Pokemon among the most solid switch-ins. Due to Drampa's Sap Sipper ability, it isnâ€™t worried about being crippled Tangela's utility moves in Leech Seed and Sleep Powder and can easily OHKO Tangela. Silvally-Dragon doesn't have the same advantage in being immune to Tangela's Grass-type utility moves, but it can still take on the majority of Tangela's moveset extremely well and can reliably threaten it with Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Offensive Fire-types such as Simisear and Combusken only really fear Sleep Powder and can get chipped somewhat with Leech Seed, but they otherwise have little trouble taking any hit that Tangela can throw at it and can easily OHKO Tangela in return with their Fire-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Swanna and Oricorio-G both have the ability to easily break past Tangela due to their strong special STAB moves. Additionally, Oricorio-G resists Tangela's STAB moves and can safely use it as setup fodder with Calm Mind and bypass Sleep Powder with Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Due to Tangela's low Special Defense even with Eviolite, it can be heavily punished by practically any specially offensive wallbreaker, with prominent examples being Eelektross, special Skuntank, and Haunter.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Despite Tangela's recovery options, Toxic effectively puts it on a timer by severely limiting its survivability and defensive capabilities. Toxic Spikes are equally problematic and can be set by Pokemon like Roselia, whose typing, decent bulk, and ability to deal significant damage with its own STAB moves are enough to force Tangela out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Giga Drain is Tangela's main way of dealing consistent damage while also functioning as a source of recovery and greatly punishing Pokemon weak to it such as Gastrodon and Regirock. Hidden Power Fire can be used to deal heavy damage to Abomasnow and Alolan Sandslash. Knock Off is a strong option due to its utility, allowing Tangela to pressure Pokemon such as Clefairy, Type: Null, Roselia, and Skuntank by removing their Eviolite or recovery items. This move can also scout for Z-Moves if it doesn't remove an item. Leech Seed supplies Tangela with another form of recovery that it can use to pressure switch-ins by racking up residual damage against them. Alternatively, Synthesis trades the ability to deliver chip damage for functioning as Tangela's most reliable form of recovery besides Regenerator, allowing it to heal 50% of its HP. Finally, Sleep Powder can incapacitate a threat from the opposing team and is a solid option against many Pokemon that take negligible damage from the rest of Tangela's attacks like Skuntank and Combusken. It can also be used to effectively prevent slower Pokemon such as Regirock and Clefairy from getting up Stealth Rock early-game.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Regenerator combined with Tangela's physical bulk is an integral part of what makes this set viable, allowing it to negate one-third the amount of damage it may have taken by simply switching out. Eviolite is necessary for augmenting Tangela's bulk to function as an extremely sturdy physical wall against the majority of the tier.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Although Tangela can be used at any point in the battle, its primary function is to utilize its massive Defense stat and pivot into physical attackers such as Kabutops, Kangaskhan, and Primeape. Utilizing Regenerator and the rest of Tangela's recovery options to keep it as healthy as possible is key in consistently addressing hard-hitting attackers such as Stoutland and can make dealing with late-game powerhouses like Belly Drum Zangoose and Lycanroc a lot easier as well. Tangela should generally avoid switching into special attackers unless it is a defensive Pokemon that it has a good matchup against, such as Gastrodon. It's good to be mindful of possible utility options that can be used to cripple Tangela, as moves such as Toxic and Knock Off can significantly disrupt it and reduce its longevity. Tangela's utility options in Leech Seed and Knock Off are very safe for pressuring the opposing team, while Sleep Powder can be quite impactful for incapacitating switch-ins or temporarily stopping slower Pokemon like Clefairy and Audino from doing their jobs throughout the match. Finally, Synthesis makes it easy to recover off damage once Tangela has been considerably weakened.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to Tangela's massive Defense and mediocre Special Defense, defensive checks to popular special attackers form some of the best cores on balanced teams with it, such as Clefairy, Type: Null, Audino, and Lanturn. Meanwhile, they appreciate Tangela's ability to switch into powerful physical wallbreakers. They also provide responses to Toxic through Magic Guard, Rest, or Heal Bell, respectively. Although Tangela's bulk is still good without Eviolite, teammates that can sponge Knock Off such as Regirock and Silvally-Fairy are still great for alleviating pressure on it. Regirock can also switch into troublesome Pokemon that can otherwise easily KO Tangela, such as Oricorio-E, special Skuntank, and Oricorio-G. Silvally-Fairy can act as a secondary check to Dark-types like Absol and Alolan Raticate. Hazard control is ideal, as it allows Tangela to get the most out of its recovery from Regenerator when pivoting and not be constantly chipped from Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes. Hitmonchan can offer this role while checking special attackers like Eelektross and Aurorus. Skuntank can Pursuit trap special attackers like Haunter and absorbs Toxic Spikes for Tangela, while in return, Tangela can switch into Ground-types like Gastrodon and Alolan Dugtrio. Tangela's solid utility and Defense allows it to also fit on stall archetypes, pairing with staples like Audino and Pyukumuku that appreciate it offering support options like Knock Off and taking on hard-hitting physical attackers like Zangoose and Choice Band Primeape. Audino can remove any possible status ailment with Heal Bell and forms a strong Regenerator core with Tangela, which allows them to pivot between each other with ease while staying healthy.</p>"

  "Kangaskhan": {
    "overview": "<p>Kangaskhan is a solid pick in PU due to its solid Attack and Speed alongside Fake Out, which allows it to act as a decent revenge killer. These traits are aided by naturally good bulk that lets it to take a couple of hits if it must. Due to these traits, Kangaskhan acts as a blanket check against offense with the ability to pressure most setup sweepers with dual priority and chip faster foes while also being bulky enough to switch in a few times throughout a match. Additionally, Scrappy allows it to threaten offensive Ghost-types such as Oricorio-G or Haunter with Fake Out while denting defensive ones such as Jellicent and Spiritomb with Double-Edge. Kangaskhan can also effectively lure most of its counters with Z-move and Substitute + Toxic sets, significantly increasing its diversity and threat level. However, lack of reliable recovery alongside Double-Edge recoil wears down Kangaskhan quickly. All-out attacking sets struggle against bulky Normal-resistant Pokemon like Regirock and Carracosta, and it faces notable competition from Stoutland which can reliably deal more immediate damage at the cost of Speed and priority.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic is an alternative to Sucker Punch on all-out attacking sets to pressure bulkier Pokemon such as Tangela and Sableye at the cost of a weaker presence against offensive teams. Assault Vest can be run to exchange power for greater special bulk and more opportunities to switch in, but typically offers less sustainability than a pinch berry. A set with Focus Punch and Substitute is an option to punish Omastar and other Normal-resistant Pokemon, but Kangaskhan is rarely able to free up the additional moveslots. Lastly, Circle Throw can be ran on bulkier spreads to give Kangaskhan a consistent phazing move that nothing is immune to, especially on teams utilizing Spikes.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Normal-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Omastar, Regirock, and Shuca Berry Aggron can easily switch into Kangaskhan's Fake Out and proceed to cripple it or set up entry hazards. Power-Up Punch Kangaskhan is capable of breaking through many Normal-resistant Pokemon, however.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Physically bulky Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Throh can take a hit from Kangaskhan and proceed to KO it or set up a Bulk Up. It should be noted, however, that Throh cannot switch into a Double-Edge without being 2HKOed. Other Pokemon such as Hitmonchan, Primeape, and Poliwrath don't enjoy taking Kangaskhan's STAB moves but nonetheless can still force out it with their Fighting STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Physically bulky Pokemon such as Tangela and Musharna can switch into basically any of Kangaskhan's attacks and proceed to force it out with the threat of status or just generally deal heavy damage to it. +1 Z-Double Edge heavily damages many of these Pokemon, though.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fake Out deals decent priority damage while making the foe flinch, making it proficient at chipping frail and fast targets such as Primeape, Oricorio-E, and Dodrio. Double-Edge hits for heavy damage and is preferred over Return for the higher damage output despite the recoil, giving Kangaskhan a good chance to KO Skuntank after Stealth Rock damage alongside other benchmarks. Earthquake hits Normal-resistant Pokemon such as Carracosta and Regirock for solid damage. Lastly, Sucker Punch further improves Kangaskhan's offense matchup, securing the KO on some setup sweepers that are not KOed by Fake Out alone, such as Alolan Raichu.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Adamant is the preferred nature to maximize damage output, and the Speed loss is mostly unimportant when using priority attacks. Jolly, however, can still outspeed Pokemon such as Skuntank and other positive nature base 80 Speed Pokemon while also beating out or tying with other Kangaskhan. Maximum Speed is opted over additional bulk to still pose as a threat to offense after the Fake Out while still having enough bulk to take a few neutral hits. Silk Scarf is run over items such as Life Orb and Leftovers for the damage boost on Fake Out and Double-Edge while avoiding the recoil of Life Orb, allowing Kangaskhan to switch in and fire off Fake Out more often throughout the match. However, a Figy Berry can also be used to provide Kangaskhan with more switch-in opportunities and to somewhat negate recoil from Double-Edge. Lastly, Scrappy is the ability of choice, as it gives Kangaskhan's STAB moves the ability to hit Ghost-type targets such as Jellicent and Golurk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kangaskhan's main goal early in the match is to wear down the opponent's Pokemon with Fake Out (or Earthquake on a predicted switch), after which it should be kept in reserve to keep the opponent's sweepers from setting up freely lest they be revenge killed by the Fake Out + Sucker Punch combination. Kangaskhan should be brought in after a teammate is KOed to revenge kill frail offensive threats such as Absol or Floatzel with dual priority. Note, however, that these Pokemon often need to have some form prior damage on them to ensure a KO, especially Jynx, as they can use a sleep-inducing move after the initial Fake Out to easily avoid the Sucker Punch while shutting down Kangaskhan. While Kangaskhan has good natural bulk, avoid switching it into stronger attacks, as Kangaskhan should be at a decent HP for the later parts of a match to successfully revenge kill and possibly take a hit if need be. This can be alleviated by bringing Kangaskhan in on predicted switches or via pivot moves from teammates such as Eelektross and Silvally-Fairy. On another note, Normal-type moves shouldn't be spammed if the opponent has anything Normal-resistant, as this can grant them a safe switch in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Kangaskhan acts as a decent catch-all check against offense, so it fits well on more offensively inclined teams that need a reliable revenge killer. This role as an anti-offense Pokemon doesn't mandate any direct support, but Pokemon that can remove Normal-resistant threats such as Gurdurr and Victreebel allow Kangaskhan to more easily chip the foe with its Normal STAB moves. Additionally, slow pivots such as Eelektross can provide Kangaskhan with opportunities to come onto the field without taking any prior damage, giving it more chances to break early on. Fighting checks such as Musharna and Oricorio-E help alleviate Kangaskhan's weakness to bulky Fighting-types like Gurdurr or Throh. Musharna in particular is notable for its access to Healing Wish, giving Kangaskhan additional chances to break when well timed. Toxic Spikes from teammates such as Qwilfish or Roselia are greatly appreciated by Kangaskhan, as they wear down Kangaskhan's checks while also keeping opposing targets from switching out freely. Clerics such as Altaria and Lanturn can help Kangaskhan if it gets crippled by burn. Finally, hazard setters such as Ferroseed and Mudsdale aid Kangaskhan in wearing down its checks and counters over the course of the match.</p>"

      "Power-Up Punch + Z-Move": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Power-Up Punch increases Kangaskhan's Attack by one stage, which allows it to break through bulkier Pokemon such as Mudsdale, Regirock, and Spiritomb more easily. Double-Edge is Kangaskhan's most powerful STAB move and has an incredibly high damage output even without an Attack boost. Sucker Punch gives Kangaskhan the ability to revenge kill offensive Ghost- and Psychic-types like Oricorio-G, Haunter lacking Will-O-Wisp, and Alolan Raichu. Sucker Punch also gives teams a harder time revenge killing Kangaskhan after it has set up. Facade can be used over Sucker Punch or Double-Edge to prevent Kangaskhan from being completely hindered by status conditions, which is particularly useful for teams that struggle breaking through Sableye. Power-Up Punch gives Kangaskhan an even easier time luring these Pokemon in and breaking through them. Focus Punch is Kangaskhan's strongest Fighting-type attack if it chooses to run Fightinium Z in order to threaten certain Normal-resistant Pokemon better such as Regirock. Hammer Arm, while slightly weaker than Focus Punch, is an alternative that's less reliant on prediction and not reliant on the Z-Move, meaning that it can be used with Normalium Z, though it decreases Kangaskhan's Speed and leaves it vulnerable to previously slower Pokemon like Stoutland. Earthquake is an alternative that gives Kangaskhan coverage for Qwilfish. Earthquake also allows Kangaskhan to KO Skuntank without triggering Aftermath, taking recoil damage, or using its Z-Move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature further augments Kangaskhan's offensive capabilities, while a Jolly nature can be used instead to outspeed Skuntank and Pinsir as well as Speed tie with Mr. Mime and Zangoose at the cost of wallbreaking power. Scrappy allows Kangaskhan to hit Ghost-types with its Normal- and Fighting-type attacks, preventing them from freely switching into it. Fightinium Z turns Focus Punch into All-Out Pummeling, allowing it to reliably break through bulkier Rock- and Steel-types like Regirock, Carracosta, and Aggron. Alternatively, Normalium Z turns Double-Edge into Breakneck Blitz, a very powerful STAB move that deals more damage to checks that aren't weak to Fighting, such as Mudsdale. Breakneck Blitz also allows Kangaskhan to avoid taking Double-Edge recoil once.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Kangaskhan into threats it can revenge kill like Lanturn and Eelektross, as this generates offensive pressure and provides Kangaskhan with an opportunity to safely use Power-Up Punch. Disguise Kangaskhan's set until it is necessary to break through a foe, as the set will become apparent to opponents once Kangaskhan uses Power-Up Punch or it is revealed that it lacks Fake Out. Use Power-Up Punch when anticipating a physically bulky Pokemon like Omastar, Carracosta, or Qwilfish that would otherwise take on Kangaskhan with little issue to switch in, since this enables Kangaskhan to break through them. Aside from luring in these checks, Kangaskhan should still be used to break through specially defensive Pokemon like Clefairy, Audino, and Eelektross for its team as well. Be careful about when Kangaskhan uses its Z-Move, especially in the case of Fightinium Z variants, since opposing teams can take advantage of Kangaskhan's reliance on the Z-Move to break through most Normal checks by forcing predictions and absorbing the Z-Move with weakened Pokemon. Once all Normal-resistant foes have been weakened enough or removed, Kangaskhan can more freely set up with Power-Up Punch and clean teams with Double-Edge. Late-game, Kangaskhan can also make use of Sucker Punch to finish off more offensive teams, as the move becomes fairly powerful after a boost from Power-Up Punch. Though Kangaskhan has decent bulk, refrain from directly switching it into stronger attacks, since it needs to be as healthy as possible to reliably wallbreak as well as stomach priority moves from Pokemon like Skuntank and Spiritomb.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Kangaskhan fits on offensive, bulky offensive, and balance teams in need of a powerful wallbreaker that can lure in and heavily damage or outright remove physically bulky Ghost-, Rock-, and Steel-type Pokemon, which can potentially open the door for another teammate to finish the opposing team off late-game. Entry hazard setters such as Mudsdale, Qwilfish, and Clefairy are appreciated, since the chip damage they provide is essential for making certain KOs possible, such as on Regirock with +1 All-Out Pummeling. Both Spikes and Toxic Spikes are especially useful for wearing down standard Normal-resistant Pokemon much faster. Calm Mind variants of Clefairy have an easier time setting up due to Kangaskhan removing Steel-types, while Musharna provides Kangaskhan with a consistent switch-in to Gurdurr and can potentially give it another chance to wallbreak with Healing Wish. Both of these Pokemon also appreciate Kangaskhan pressuring Skuntank. Since Kangaskhan still has issues breaking through certain physically defensive Pokemon like Tangela and Pyukumuku, pairing it with strong special wallbreakers like Aurorus and Drampa is ideal. Due to its vulnerability to Fighting-types like Primeape, Hitmonchan, and Gurdurr, Kangaskhan appreciates being paired with checks like Victreebel, Oricorio-E, and Qwilfish. Pairing Kangaskhan with pivots such as Eelektross, Scyther, or Primeape is ideal since this gives it an easier time switching in and threatening opposing teams. Late-game sweepers and cleaners that can take advantage of Kangaskhan breaking through teams and heavily damaging their checks, such as Carracosta and Jynx, make for good partners. Jynx can also put foes to sleep with Lovely Kiss, which can potentially provide Kangaskhan with additional opportunities to switch in.</p>"

      "Substitute + Toxic": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute allows Kangaskhan to avoid status moves such as Pyukumuku's Toxic and rack up damage with Toxic more easily. Toxic cripples switch-ins such as Regirock, Pyukumuku, and Tangela and allows Kangaskhan to get past them. Lastly, Power-Up Punch raises Kangaskhan's Attack stat by one stage every time it's used, increasing its offensive presence and allowing it to exploit its checks such as Mudsdale more easily. Alongside Toxic, this allows Kangaskhan to be a threat to bulkier teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers gives Kangaskhan passive recovery and allows it to partially negate the damage taken by making a Substitute. An Impish nature combined with the EV investment in Special Defense prevents a fully invested Musharna from breaking Kangaskhan's Substitute with Dazzling Gleam, while the rest of the EVs are poured into Defense, making sure Kangaskhan has enough bulk to take hits on both sides and preventing Regirock from breaking Kangaskhan's substitute with Rock Slide.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early- and mid-game, Kangaskhan should aim to cripple its checks like Mudsdale and Regirock and set up a Substitute to rack up damage with Toxic. Due to its decently high bulk, it can be used as a check to foes such as non-Flyinium Z Oricorio-E and Silvally-Fairy if healthy. It can come in on passive Pokemon that can't break its Substitute like Jellicent and Articuno. However, it has to be wary of Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, which greatly hinder its longevity. Furthermore, Kangaskhan should only set up when its checks, such as Regirock and Mudsdale, are weakened. However, in Pyukumuku's case, Kangaskhan should pressure it with Toxic and attacks until it's forced to switch out, as Unaware allows Pyukumuku to ignore the Attack boost provided by Power-Up Punch. Finally, due to Kangaskhan's lack of reliable recovery, it shouldn't be switched in repeatedly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to Kangaskhan's weakness to Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Primeape, checks to them like Oricorio-E are greatly appreciated. Qwilfish is also a good option, as it can also help Kangaskhan weaken its checks faster thanks to entry hazards. Other good partners are the ones that appreciate the likes of Pyukumuku, Regirock, and Tangela weakened or outright taken out such as Lycanroc, Dodrio, and Gurdurr. Lastly, Kangaskhan's lack of reliable recovery means that it can easily be chipped away with entry hazards and status conditions. Entry hazard removers such as Skuntank and Alolan Sandslash are especially good partners, as the former can remove Toxic Spikes by coming on the field, while the latter is immune to Toxic Spikes.</p>"

Even with its unique ability for a Water-type in Lightning Rod, Seaking finds itself outclassed by Lanturn. Lanturn has higher overall bulk, a secondary typing, and access to Volt Switch. Furthermore, Seaking is also outclassed by other physical Water-types such as Floatzel, Kabutops, and Carracosta with their higher offensive presence, ability to set up, overall versatility, the first two's higher Speed, the last two's secondary typing, and Carracosta's better bulk.</p>",

  "Mr. Mime": {
    "overview": "<p>Mr. Mime struggles to stand out from other Psychic-types like Musharna and Jynx despite its secondary Fairy typing. Its Nasty Plot set can work against balance and stall teams by breaking through walls and hitting surprisingly hard with its perfect neutral coverage, and its Fairy typing helps it serve as a reliable check to Dragon-types in the tier like Drampa and Altaria. However, although Mr. Mime's Speed is slightly above average, it is slow enough to be scared out by faster Pokemon due to its poor physical bulk and HP. Its defenses also leave it susceptible to priority moves and Pursuit trapping, which can make it hard to use. While its Fairy typing can lend a hand in checking Fighting-types more easily, Mr. Mime still faces a lot of competition from fellow Psychic-types Jynx and Musharna, which are simply much better all around due to better secondary STAB and access to Lovely Kiss for the former and far superior bulk for the latter.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mr. Mime can run a passable Choice Scarf set which carves out a niche through its access to Trick and Healing Wish and ability to check Drampa, but its extreme frailty makes it underwhelming. Another tool that can be used against stall is Substitute + Nasty Plot. Substitute helps avoid status from Pokemon like Audino and Gastrodon, though it can be annoying to use because Mr. Mime can't take hits very well and the Substitute will not last against many hits. Encore can be added to the set because of its potential to create setup opportunities, but this comes at the cost of reducing Mr. Mime's coverage. Psychic can be run on Mr. Mime to have a more powerful neutral hit, but Psyshock's utility is usually preferred because of how it hits otherwise troublesome specially bulky Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Mr. Mime's physical bulk is terrible, so almost anything that hits with physical moves and is faster can revenge kill Mr. Mime. This includes such threats as Alolan Dugtrio, Floatzel, and Lycanroc. Mr. Mime also struggles with strong special attackers, especially ones with super effective coverage such as Oricorio-G.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Pokemon like Absol, Alolan Raticate, and Skuntank can KO Mr. Mime with Sucker Punch with enough prior damage due to its poor physical bulk. Kangaskhan can severely dent Mr. Mime with Fake Out and then finish it with Sucker Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Focus Blast hits Steel-, Rock-, and Normal-type walls such as Alolan Sandslash, Regirock, and Type: Null that would otherwise switch into Mr. Mime. Psyshock allows Mr. Mime to hit specially defensive walls such as Eelektross, Cryogonal, and Clefairy hard without having to resort to Focus Blast or setting up more Nasty Plots.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Fightinium Z set gives Mr. Mime a chance to break through particularly pesky walls such as Type: Null and Audino or safely go for a strong Fighting-type move without the fear of missing. The Life Orb set, on the other hand, gives Mr. Mime additional firepower and immediate damage and aids in its wallbreaking potential and the ability to pick up KOs more easily, namely on Pokemon like Eelektross. Life Orb is riskier, however, and limits the number times Mr. Mime can switch or attack within the game. Soundproof is by far the best option for Mr. Mime's ability because it allows Mr. Mime to offensively check Drampa by making it immune to Hyper Voice. It can also come in on Alolan Persian and block Parting Shot, forcing a switch or a Black Hole Eclipse.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The goal with this set is to get a Nasty Plot up and start doing damage. It is possible to sweep with it, but the more realistic goal is to break through the other team's bulkier Pokemon to make way for your other Pokemon to sweep. In the event the opposing player is running a very offensive team, Mr. Mime is strong enough to hit frail offensive Pokemon hard enough without a Special Attack boost, so just firing off attacks is the best option. The easiest way to set up a Nasty Plot is to do so on a threatened or passive Pokemon. A slow U-turn or Volt Switch from Eelektross or Lanturn can aid in getting Mr. Mime in on these Pokemon. Notable Pokemon Mr. Mime can set up on are Hitmonchan, Gurdurr, Sableye, and Lanturn. When using Life Orb, it is imperative that the player limit the use of Mr. Mime and wait until a safe opportunity to set up or attack due to the limited number of attacks that can be used. If All-Out Pummeling is not needed for a specific wall, keep in mind that it is still the strongest move in Mr. Mime's arsenal, but always be wary of the opponent's Ghost-types when using it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mr. Mime works well with pivots such as Alolan Persian, Lanturn, and Silvally-Fairy that can use moves such as Volt Switch, U-turn, and Parting Shot to either safely get Mr. Mime in or keep momentum up on a predicted switch. A slow pivot works best so Mr. Mime can come in without taking a hit or status move. Regirock, Mudsdale, and Qwilfish are all good teammates for Mr. Mime because they provide reliable defensive switch-ins to Pokemon that threaten Mr. Mime out after it has scored a KO such as Dodrio and Floatzel. They also have good entry hazard setting options that will work with Mr. Mime's wallbreaking potential. Fighting-types like Primeape and Gurdurr appreciate the fact that Mr. Mime can pressure Pokemon like Victreebel and Musharna, clearing a way for them to punch through an opponent's team. It is a good idea to pair Mr. Mime up with fast special attackers such as Haunter and Choice Scarf Aurorus or physical attackers such as Skuntank and Kangaskhan to keep up offensive pressure and to clean up a game after the opponent's walls are gone.</p>"

  "Scyther": {
    "overview": "<p>Scyther is a mediocre choice in PU and primarily functions as a pivot capable of checking fairly common Fighting- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Gurdurr and Victreebel. With a bulky Swords Dance set, it is capable of using its bulk to check the aforementioned Pokemon while simultaneously pressuring defensive cores reliant on Pokemon such as Sableye and Lanturn with its ability to pivot out while going for boosted attacks. It can also run a passable Choice Scarf set, being an extremely fast pivot capable of revenge killing and gaining momentum quickly, or manage a Choice Band set that can hit decently hard and be more difficult to handle defensively. Unfortunately, a crippling 4x weakness to Stealth Rock severely limits Scyther's capabilities and mandates good entry hazard removal to make it usable. This also leads to Scyther being easily pressured by Rock-type move users like Lycanroc, Aggron, and Choice Scarf Primeape and by common Ice-, Flying- and Electric-types such as Alolan Sandslash, Dodrio, and Eelektross. Even with a Swords Dance set, Scyther cannot break through common defensive options in the tier such as Regirock and Mudsdale, which leads to Scyther really struggling in a lot of matchups.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bug Bite is another option as a last move on both the Choice Band and Choice Scarf sets as a secondary Bug-type STAB attack that doesn't force Scyther out, but it is rarely worthwhile. Scyther can afford to go a fully offensive Swords Dance set with an EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature and either Buginium Z or Fightinium Z to lure in traditional checks like Carracosta and Regirock and remove them with a boosted Z-Move. However, since Scyther loses much of its bulk when not running Eviolite or HP investment and becomes more vulnerable to the Pokemon it's supposed to be checking like Hitmonchan, a bulky Swords Dance set is preferred. Utilizing Technician Quick Attack as a fourth move gives Scyther a revenge killing tool to dispatch weakened faster threats such as Dodrio. However, it is still very weak and exploitable. Tailwind can give the Choice Scarf set more utility in order for Scyther's teammates to sweep, and it should be used on the same turn Scyther is KOed. However, locking Scyther into a status move makes it very exploitable, and it automatically leaves the player one Pokemon down.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Scyther loses half its health upon switching into Stealth Rock. This is a huge detriment for Scyther, as it cannot perform its roles consistently and can make it a liability on teams.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Rock-type Pokemon such as Regirock and Carracosta easily switch into Scyther's attacks and threaten it out with super effective STAB attacks. Lycanroc and Choice Scarf Kabutops can outspeed non-Choice Scarf Scyther and threaten it with Stone Edge, and Lycanroc can pressure Choice Scarf variants with Accelerock.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Alolan Sandslash and Aggron resist Scyther's STAB combination, and the latter scares Scyther with its strong 4x super effective Head Smash. However, both of the aforementioned Pokemon can be caught off guard by Brick Break. While rare, Mawile completely walls everything Scyther has to offer.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Mudsdale, Jellicent, and Sableye are all capable of eating at least one attack from any Scyther set and crippling it with status.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Alolan Raichu and Choice Scarf Abomasnow, among others, are capable of outspeeding and OHKOing non-Choice Scarf Scyther. Choice Scarf Dodrio can outspeed and KO all Scyther sets.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn is Scyther's Bug-type STAB attack and lets it pivot out of poor matchups and keep momentum going. Aerial Ace rounds out Scyther's STAB coverage and allows it to hit Gurdurr super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs ensure Scyther is as bulky as possible in conjunction with Eviolite, letting it better switch into foes like Hitmonchan. This amount of HP investment also allows Scyther to survive switching into Stealth Rock twice.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Scyther utilizes its bulk and typing to act as a decent check to a number of weaker attackers or Pokemon with a type disadvantage. It is at its best switching into foes such as Lurantis, Claydol, and Clefairy, setting up a Swords Dance, and getting off a boosted hit for free. However, it is not recommended to switch in Scyther when Stealth Rock is present on the field, as losing half of its HP stops it from performing its role effectively. It also places Scyther in situations where it must use Roost to recover its health, which potentially allows opposing Pokemon to gain momentum against Scyther if it cannot safely use U-turn. Scyther will also want to immediately pivot out with U-turn rather than bothering to set up with Swords Dance when facing certain foes such as Regirock and defensive Alolan Sandslash that it won't be doing much damage to regardless. It is not optimal to bring in Scyther against status users like Sableye and Jellicent, whose Will-O-Wisp cripples Scyther and reduces its damage output.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Scyther is best found on offensive teams that require a fast pivot to gain momentum and appreciate its typing to check Grass- and Fighting-types in the tier. Entry hazard removal is key when using Scyther, and teammates such as Skuntank and Choice Scarf Alolan Sandslash massively help Scyther to improve its longevity while still fitting well on the more offensive teams Scyther tends to find itself on. Fast pivots such as Silvally-Water form a VoltTurn core with Scyther, which also appreciates the Fire resistance Silvally-Water offers. Silvally-Water also pressures common Stealth Rock users like Mudsdale and Regirock and removes their entry hazards. Similarly, Eelektross and Lanturn form solid VoltTurn cores with Scyther and help check Electric- and Flying-types. Scyther also works well with wallbreakers such as Stoutland. Scyther is able to check Fighting-types like Hitmonchan that give Stoutland trouble, and, in return, Stoutland can break through the Steel-types that completely wall Scyther, such as Aggron and Alolan Sandslash. Omastar is another notable offensive partner, as it pressures bulky Rock-, Ground-, and Steel-types quite well and can make good use of Scyther's pivoting abilities to find setup opportunities. On the defensive side, Regirock is a nice partner because it can check Flying- and Rock-types such as Dodrio and Lycanroc, two Pokemon that heavily pressure this Scyther set.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brick Break enables Scyther to hit Steel-types such as Alolan Sandslash, OHKO Aurorus, and pressure Aggron. Knock Off is a useful move to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Clefairy and Audino. Toxic is another nice utility option that can cripple Scyther's standard checks like Regirock. However, it can be extremely risky to lock Scyther into.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf allows Scyther to beat out Modest Ludicolo under rain, Alolan Sandslash under hail, and Choice Scarf Primeape.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Scyther should be primarily used to revenge kill weakened Pokemon or force out Bug-weak threats such as Alolan Raichu and gain momentum for its teammates with U-turn. Be mindful before locking Scyther into any other move. Toxic can easily be played around; Brick Break and Knock Off are fairly weak, with the latter being exploitable by setup sweepers using Z-Moves; and even Aerial Ace provides Rock-types such as Lycanroc and Omastar with a free setup opportunity. Scyther will need good prediction to switch into most attacks safely. For example, while it can pivot into Gurdurr's Drain Punch and Victreebel's Leaf Storm, it will not want to be hit by a Knock Off from the former or Sludge Bomb from the latter. Choice Scarf Scyther is a risky set to utilize on teams due to the fact that all it really does is pivot in and out with a little chip damage and provide setup opportunities for certain sweepers; thus, it needs to be used extremely carefully so as not to give the opponent the upper hand.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Scyther set fits on VoltTurn offense teams that appreciate a fast pivot to bring in slower wallbreakers. Pairing it with other pivots such as Rotom-F is a must. Entry hazard removal is vital when utilizing Scyther. Lurantis provides Defog support and is a good check against Mudsdale and Regirock, which heavily pressure Scyther. Hitmonchan is also a good hazard remover to pair with Scyther, as it can take the brunt of attacks from special attackers like Simisear and Aurorus and threaten them out. Conversely, Scyther also appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Torterra, as the chip damage makes its pivoting noticeably more effective. Special wallbreakers like Drampa are good teammates, as they heavily pressure physical walls like Tangela and Sableye, which Scyther has trouble breaking through. Additionally, Scyther offers a Fighting-type resistance to Drampa, while Drampa resists both Fire- and Electric-type attacks for Scyther.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brick Break provides coverage against Steel-types like Aggron, which wall Scyther otherwise. Knock Off cripples defensive answers to Scyther like Ferroseed and Mudsdale, removing vital items from each of them. Pursuit can also be used to trap and KO weakened or Dark-weak Pokemon, allowing Scyther to support its teammates at the cost of not being able to cripple its checks as well.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Technician is the ability of choice to boost the damage output of Aerial Ace as well as of Pursuit if the opponent does not switch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Scyther should be used early- to mid-game to chip away at opposing defensive Pokemon like Qwilfish and ease the job of its teammates. However, since Scyther lacks Roost on this set, it is prone to getting worn down quite easily, so it is ideal to avoid switching Scyther into direct attacks whenever possible and never bring it in when Stealth Rock is up. Scyther should mostly be brought in versus physically frail or Bug-weak Pokemon and pivot out with powerful U-turns to rack up as much chip damage as possible early on. Knock Off can be extremely rewarding to surprise opponents with, as it can destroy the passive recovery of Pokemon like Regirock and Mudsdale and make them significantly easier to wear down. Choice Band Scyther relies on good prediction and surprise factor. Predicting a Steel-type like Alolan Sandslash to come in on an expected U-turn or Aerial Ace and KOing it with Brick Break is the best way to get maximum mileage out of its power. However, despite its boosted power, Choice Band Scyther is still very easy to exploit if it locks itself into the wrong attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Scyther pairs well with other pivots like Lanturn and Silvally-Dragon, which are able to pressure its defensive checks like Regirock and Sableye. Entry hazard removal is a necessity on any team with Scyther; Claydol can be a decent partner due to its ability to check most Rock-types and use Rapid Spin versus Regirock and Mudsdale. Thanks to Scyther's good damage output with a Choice Band, it supports physical setup sweepers quite nicely; Lycanroc is a good example, with Scyther punching holes into Gurdurr and chipping down Tangela with U-turn. Scyther also welcomes Fighting-type Pokemon like Gurdurr and Hitmonchan as teammates, since they are able to break past Steel- and Rock-types like Alolan Sandslash and Carracosta without having Scyther locking itself into Brick Break. Gurdurr can also act as a bulky setup sweeper and become a wincon thanks to Scyther chipping down defensive Pokemon like Mudsdale. Furthermore, Hitmonchan can use Rapid Spin to help out with Scyther's Stealth Rock weakness. Victreebel is a notable offensive partner for its ability to pressure nearly all of Scyther's offensive and defensive checks such as Choice Scarf Primeape and Jellicent.</p>"

  "Jynx": {
    "overview": "<p>Jynx stands out as a dangerous and effective sweeper and wallbreaker thanks to its access to the incredible Z-Lovely Kiss as well as Nasty Plot, which allows it to boost its Speed and Special Attack while putting foes to sleep. Its excellent dual STAB combination allows Jynx to forgo coverage if it needs to, although Focus Blast is a great option for getting neutral coverage on the entire tier. Jynx also has decent set diversity, with its Choice Scarf and Substitute sets being able to catch foes off guard. Dry Skin gives Jynx even more utility, allowing it to check a plethora of Water-types in the tier including Poliwrath and Floatzel. However, Jynx has awful defenses and a terrible defensive typing, leaving it susceptible to most forms of priority and all entry hazards. While its Speed tier is decent, it still leaves Jynx open to being revenge killed by a number of threats, including a few notable Choice Scarf users such as Dodrio even when Jynx is at +1. Finally, Jynx can have difficulty with Lovely Kiss's accuracy and the prevalence of other base 95 Speed Pokemon, which can lead to very common Speed ties with foes such as Primeape.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Focus Sash can be used on a Nasty Plot set if another teammate is using the Z-Move, but this set is much more mediocre as a sweeper and requires strong entry hazard removal. Fightinium Z or Icium Z can help break past certain defensive checks like Alolan Sandslash, but Jynx forgoes the incredibly useful Speed boost of Z-Lovely Kiss. Choice Specs makes Jynx a decently strong wallbreaker, but it also gives up Jynx's more unique attributes for a set mostly outclassed by the likes of Simisear and Aurorus.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Jynx's awful defenses, almost every faster attacker will threaten to OHKO it after Stealth Rock damage. This includes Pokemon such as Lycanroc and Alolan Persian if Jynx's Speed has not been boosted and Choice Scarf users such as Scyther and Swanna if Jynx is at +1 Speed. Choice Scarf Dodrio is one of the few Pokemon able to reliably revenge kill a +1 Speed Jynx, and non-Choice Scarf variants can still revenge kill an unboosted Jynx.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Jynx's terrible defenses and defensive typing leave it highly susceptible to Sucker Punch users like Skuntank and Shiftry, Mach Punch users like Gurdurr and Hitmonchan, Fake Out users like Kangaskhan, and other assorted priority users including Lycanroc and Zangoose. However, all of the priority users lacking Sucker Punch or Accelerock need some amount of chip damage on Jynx before they're able to KO.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Alolan Sandslash, Metang and Probopass can tank anything Jynx has to throw at it save a Focus Blast prediction from Choice Scarf Jynx and threaten to OHKO it in return. However, they do have to watch out for getting put to sleep and KOed once Jynx has accumulated enough Nasty Plot boosts.</p>",

      "Z-Lovely Kiss": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Lovely Kiss puts foes to sleep to grant Jynx easier setup opportunities. Z-Lovely Kiss boosts Jynx's Speed to make it a more effective sweeper once it has set up. Psyshock is the preferred Psychic-type STAB move to hit a number of common Assault Vest users, such as Lanturn and Eelektross, all well as naturally specially bulky Pokemon such as Clefairy, but Psychic is an option to guarantee the OHKO on Gurdurr at +2 and better threaten a few other physically defensive Pokemon such as Carracosta.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Normalium Z allows Jynx to use Z-Lovely Kiss, a critical part of the set. Dry Skin is useful for checking Water-types such as Floatzel and absorbing Aqua Jet from Carracosta and Kabutops.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Jynx is typically more of a late-game sweeper; it can be used earlier to put a foe to sleep or revenge kill a slower Pokemon, but Z-Lovely Kiss's single-use nature means that Jynx should not set up until absolutely necessary. If Jynx does need to put a foe to sleep early, using regular Lovely Kiss rather than the Z-Move should be considered in order to preserve the Speed boost opportunity for later on. Try to avoid switching Jynx in while entry hazards are up, as even minimal chip damage can put Jynx in range of priority users such as Hitmonchan. Jynx will often need to set up Nasty Plot versus bulky teams, and it sets up best immediately after putting a foe to sleep. Jynx's defenses are so poor that it's generally best not to use Nasty Plot versus a foe ready to attack. However, also consider avoiding putting a foe to sleep until Jynx is faced with a Sucker Punch user such as Skuntank or Shiftry. This can allow Jynx to avoid deadly mind games in playing around Sucker Punch with Nasty Plot.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Jynx fits best on offensive teams, as it's a fairly self-sufficient Pokemon that mainly requires hazard support and wallbreakers to wear away at teams before it attempts to sweep. Entry hazard removers such as Hitmonchan and Swanna are critical for keeping Jynx healthy as it switches in, while entry hazard setters such as Qwilfish and Clefairy can help chip away at Jynx's checks. Special wallbreakers such as Simisear can weaken Pokemon like Regirock and Type: Null for Jynx. Eelektross in particular is an effective partner, as it can bring Jynx in safely with its slow Volt Switch and use Knock Off to annoy Eviolite-using checks like Clefairy and the aforementioned Type: Null. Fighting-type checks such as Oricorio-G and Qwilfish can help take on Primeape and Hitmonchan, which can threaten Jynx with a Speed tie or priority, respectively.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic helps Jynx to threaten physical bulky Pokemon such as Gurdurr, although Psyshock is a usable albeit weaker option to deal more damage to Assault Vest Hitmonchan. Focus Blast gives Jynx coverage for Steel-types like Alolan Sandslash as well as doing more damage to bulky Normal-types such as Type: Null and Audino. In the last slot, Lovely Kiss and Trick are both single-use options to cripple foes that Choice Scarf Jynx cannot revenge kill otherwise. Trick fails versus Z-Move users such as Alolan Raichu, which can often be devastating if given free turn to set up, while Lovely Kiss does not help versus certain defensive sweepers such as Type: Null.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf allows Jynx to outpace and revenge kill as many foes as possible. Dry Skin allows Jynx to revenge kill a +2 Carracosta without fear of Aqua Jet.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Jynx is a very straightforward revenge killer that should be brought in on slower, boosted sweepers such as Dodrio to either KO them or force them out. However, there is some surprise factor associated with the set, which can be used to Jynx's advantage. Be careful of using Psychic if the opponent has a Dark-type Pursuit trapper such as Skuntank on their team, as it can leave Jynx vulnerable. All of Jynx's moves can allow certain Pokemon to set up on it if they are aware that Jynx is Choice locked, so hiding that fact can be useful. Lovely Kiss in particular necessitates that Jynx switch out afterwards due to Sleep Clause, so be careful with its use. Make sure when using Trick to cripple foes that Jynx does not need its Choice Scarf to outpace a sweeper such as Carracosta later in the game, and also be careful of a Pokemon carrying a Z-Crystal switching in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Jynx fits best on offensive or balanced teams in need of strong speed control. It keeps sweepers such as Simisear and Omastar in check for defensive Pokemon like Regirock that might otherwise be overwhelmed. Fire-type checks such as Lanturn and the aforementioned Regirock make for good partners due to Jynx's natural weakness to them. Similarly, Dark-type checks such as Gurdurr and Primeape are a good option. Jynx benefits from entry hazard removers such as Skuntank, as Stealth Rock and Spikes severely limit its switching in opportunities.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Lovely Kiss puts foes to sleep, giving Jynx the opportunity to set up a Substitute or Nasty Plot, with Substitute giving Jynx a failsafe if the opponent wakes up and making Jynx harder to revenge kill. Z-Lovely Kiss boosts Jynx's Speed, allowing it to more effectively sweep. Ice Beam is Jynx's attacking move of choice, as nothing is immune to it and it can break through most Pokemon that resist it if Jynx has enough boosts.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Dry Skin provides Jynx with setup opportunities versus Pokemon such as Lanturn. Normalium Z allows Jynx to boost its Speed with Z-Lovely Kiss to more effectively sweep late-game, but Leftovers can be used for passive recovery to make up for Substitute recoil if another Z-Move user is being used. If using Leftovers, Jynx is more often oriented towards early-game wallbreaking.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If running Normalium Z, Jynx should be used primarily as a late-game sweeper, as Ice-resistant Pokemon must be removed or weakened for maximum effectiveness. However, Leftovers sets can be effective at chipping away at checks such as Lanturn, Alolan Sandslash, and Aurorus, which more handily beat Normalium Z Jynx, throughout a match. However, if the opposing team lacks strong Ice-resistant Pokemon, Jynx may attempt to sweep or wallbreak earlier on in the match. Jynx is highly susceptible to priority and faster Pokemon due to its poor bulk, so setting up a Substitute should take priority over boosting with Nasty Plot unless no attempt to sweep is being made. Jynx can bluff a different set rather effectively before revealing Substitute, so attempt to keep it hidden for as long as possible. Getting a KO while Jynx has a Substitute set up can be an incredibly powerful position, as allowing Jynx to bypass certain checks such as Hitmonchan and Kangaskhan can easily turn the tide of a match. Avoid sending out Jynx until entry hazards have been removed, as it takes significant damage from both Stealth Rock and Spikes. If Jynx is carrying Leftovers, this may also reveal Jynx's set earlier than intended.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removers such as Kabutops are excellent for keeping Jynx healthy as it switches in. Meanwhile, entry hazard setters like Qwilfish and Ferroseed are important partners for chipping away at common Ice-resistant Pokemon such as Lanturn. Other special wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Jellicent are also useful for wearing down Ice-resistant Pokemon, as well as other specially bulky Pokemon that may cause problems for Jynx. Knock Off users such as Absol and Eelektross can lure in many Jynx checks such as Clefairy and Hitmonchan and remove their Eviolite or Assault Vest for Jynx's convenience.</p>"

  "Pinsir": {
    "overview": "<p>Pinsir is the best offensive Bug-type in the tier thanks to its impressive base Attack stat, good movepool, and great abilities. It functions best as a mid- or late-game sweeper because Z-Me First and Moxie cause Pinsir to become unstoppable against weakened and more offensive teams. However, it also does well as a wallbreaker thanks to its high Attack and access to Swords Dance and Mold Breaker, which allows it to hit Pokemon with the Levitate ability and bypass Pyukumuku's Unaware ability. The similarity between Pinsir's two main sets and the nearly equal popularity of both make it difficult to predict which Pinsir set is being used at first, allowing players to use this to their advantage. However, Pinsir is somewhat limited in power due to its only STAB attack being X-Scissor, which only has 80 Base Power; this, when coupled with Pinsir's merely average Speed stat, makes it hard for Pinsir to consistently wallbreak against more offensive teams. Pinsir's Speed stat, poor defensive typing, and mediocre bulk cause it to be easily revenge killed by the likes of Swanna, Simisear, and Oricorio-G. Its typing also means Pinsir has to deal with a crippling weakness to Stealth Rock, which wears it down quickly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Scarf set can be used in a similar fashion to Normalium Z by acting as a late-game cleaner with Moxie, but the obvious downside is the inability to switch between its moves, which can make it hard to break through a team with easily wallable moves like X-Scissor and Earthquake. Choice Band Pinsir with Mold Breaker can act as a decently strong threat to many Pokemon with its near-perfect coverage but generally does not find use due to its weakness to entry hazards and inability to switch moves. Close Combat can be run on either the Z-Me First or the Swords Dance set as an alternative to Stone Edge and Knock Off because it gives Pinsir an option to hit specific bulky Pokemon like Type: Null, Audino, and Ferroseed. It does this, however, by giving up needed coverage for Flying- and Ghost-types, and Close Combat makes Pinsir easier to revenge kill, especially with regards to priority. Buginium Z can be used to break past a physically bulky Pokemon like Mudsdale or get a quick KO against an offensive Pokemon without needing to set up. However, Buginium Z finds a hard time being used because Savage Spin-Out is resisted by many Pokemon. Not using a Life Orb also means that Pinsir will have difficulty breaking other walls with its coverage moves. Pinsir can fill in a niche role by utilizing an offensive Stealth Rock set in a couple of ways. Pinsir can attempt to use a suicide lead set with Earthquake, Stone Edge or Rock Tomb, and X-Scissor to set Stealth Rock early-game against foes that attempt to set up. It can also use a set with a Lum Berry and Swords Dance as a way of compressing the two roles of Stealth Rock setter and wallbreaker together, thus making it more justifiable to put on teams. Running a Jolly nature on the Z-Me First set is another option, as it allows Pinsir to outspeed Pokemon such as maximum Speed Jolly Kabutops and Skuntank, but those sets are not really that common and the ability to use Z-Me First on Skuntank isn't really helpful. It should be noted that Quick Attack can be used on either Pinsir set, though it is significantly more useful on the Swords Dance set, because the priority helps Pinsir patch up its mediocre Speed versus more offensive teams. This is not recommended as much, however, because Quick Attack is very weak even after a Swords Dance and Life Orb boost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types that inhabit the tier such as Mudsdale and Gastrodon, pose a roadblock to Pinsir, especially without a boost. Apart from most of them either resisting or being neutral to Pinsir's coverage, all of them have options to heavily damage Pinsir, and Gastrodon has access to reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: This applies more to the Z-Me First set because it lacks the power necessary to overcome physical walls like Regirock, Gurdurr, and Type: Null. However, the Swords Dance set usually requires a Swords Dance boost to be effective against these Pokemon; otherwise, Pokemon like Regirock can deal massive damage with Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Pinsir is not very fast, so it is threatened by many offensive Pokemon like Simisear and Oricorio-G. Pinsir's poor defensive typing also makes it easier to threaten. This applies more to the Swords Dance set because the Z-Me First set outspeeds revenge killers at +2.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Pinsir's weakness to Stealth Rock limits how often it can switch in, especially if it is using a Life Orb. A weakened Pinsir becomes less of a threat because many bulky Pokemon and priority users will have an easier time KOing it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Z-Me First": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Me First copies a slower foe's move at 1.5x power; when used with Normalium Z, it turns the copied attack into a Z-Move and gives Pinsir a +2 Speed boost that allows it to outspeed the majority of the metagame, making it an excellent late-game cleaner. Earthquake allows Pinsir to hit Rock- and Steel-types like Regirock, Carracosta, Alolan Sandslash, and Metang hard. Stone Edge lets Pinsir KO Flying-types like Oricorio-E and Swanna that would otherwise wall the set and force Pinsir out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature is preferred over Jolly for the power boost and because Pinsir is capable of outspeeding most of the metagame at +2 Speed with just Speed investment. Moxie boosts Pinsir's Attack whenever it KOes a foe. Normalium Z allows Pinsir to double its Speed with Z-Me First, making it faster than common Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Dodrio, which, when combined with a potential boost from Moxie, can let Pinsir sweep easily.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to Pinsir's mediocre Speed and bulk, setting up with Z-Me First requires patience and proper prediction. For example, if it is avoidable, Pinsir should not use Z-Me First against foes that are predicted to use special attacks or attacks that they resist. Pinsir will want to wait until the enemy team is sufficiently weakened so it can easily clean through the rest of the team. However, it is important to keep in mind how Moxie will play into Pinsir's attempts to sweep, as Pinsir can snowball rather quickly and possibly even sweep early-game. The best time to set up with Z-Me First is on slower physical attackers such as Golurk, Hitmonchan, and Stoutland that are likely to be KOed by the copied Z-Move. After the Speed increase and a boost from Moxie, it is very difficult to stop Pinsir from sweeping, so it is wise to be patient when using it due to the one-use nature of the Z-Move. It's better to preserve Pinsir's health as much as possible so it can take priority moves more easily while it is sweeping. Eliminating opposing priority users beforehand is also preferred, as they can halt Pinsir's sweep if is not healthy enough. It is important to note that this set does not fare well against stall because it does not have enough power or coverage to hit common Pokemon found on the playstyle. The best that can be hoped for is to get a Moxie boost from KOing a Pokemon and become semi-threatening.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pinsir will want a team around it that is good at hitting hard and weakening the opponent's Pokemon to ease Pinsir's attempts at sweeping. Because of this, strong wallbreakers like Choice Specs Drampa, Choice Specs Aurorus, and Choice Band Stoutland make for good partners. Entry hazard support helps to wear down foes as they switch in, so Spikes users like Qwilfish as well as reliable Stealth Rock users such as Regirock and Clefairy make for amazing partners. Pursuit trapping can be another valuable asset to weaken foes and ease Pinsir's attempts at sweeping. The most notable Pursuit trapper is Skuntank, but Absol and Stoutland are also fine partners. Pokemon such as Victreebel and Tangela provide options for dealing with certain bulky Ground-types that Pinsir has great trouble dealing with; Victreebel can pressure Ground-types because of its wallbreaking potential and threatening STAB attacks, whereas Tangela can beat Ground-types because of its bulk and sustainability.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is a powerful coverage move that can hit Eelektross, Lanturn, Skuntank, and Aggron super effectively and hit Fighting-types neutrally. Stone Edge hits Flying-types such as Altaria and Articuno. Knock Off is an alternative option that gives Pinsir a better matchup against walls like Jellicent that would otherwise give Pinsir a hard time, and it also hits Flying-types neutrally.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb is the preferred item because Pinsir relies a lot on the boosted power to be a substantial threat, but this also comes with the drawback of recoil damage, which can quickly wear down Pinsir throughout the battle. Lum Berry is an alternative choice that makes Pinsir better suited to beat Pokemon like Sableye and other passive status inducers, as it gives Pinsir a free opportunity to set up and saves Pinsir's HP in the long run. It also allows Pinsir to be worn down less due to the lack of a Life Orb, but this comes with the cost of reducing Pinsir's overall damage output, which is useful for reliably KOing Carracosta from full at +2 and KOing Regirock with enough chip damage. Mold Breaker is the most preferred ability on this set because it allows Pinsir to ignore Unaware Pyukumuku, while also hitting Pokemon with Levitate like Eelektross.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swords Dance Pinsir functions as a wallbreaker, which means it has the job of boosting up early- or mid-game and powering through bulky Pokemon, making way for other Pokemon to clean up the battle. Swords Dance is only necessary if the opposing team is more defensively oriented and a boost is required to KO opposing bulky Pokemon. Pinsir should aim to set up by threatening out Pokemon like Eelektross, Torterra, and Skuntank, as taking damage while setting up can prevent Pinsir from taking another hit from potential revenge killers or defensive Pokemon such as Jellicent. Versus offensive teams, attacking is generally better because Pinsir will likely not require a boost to get KOes and doesn't have to worry about finding safer chances to set up. Due to Pinsir's average Speed tier, Pinsir is often prone to getting revenge killed against offensive teams and thus will have any potential Swords Dance sweeps cut short.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Primeape make for great partners with Pinsir because Pinsir KOes and pressures opposing Psychic-types and takes on Qwilfish and Claydol thanks to Swords Dance. Late-game cleaners like Floatzel and Omastar also appreciate Pinsir's wallbreaking ability. Entry hazard removal is very helpful to Pinsir, as it helps deal with Pinsir's susceptibility to Stealth Rock and other hazards. Swanna pairs well with Pinsir because it can provide Defog support and weaken some of the Pokemon that Pinsir has trouble getting through such as Mudsdale and Gurdurr. Blanket defensive Pokemon like Lanturn, Regirock, and Qwilfish serve as dedicated switch-ins when Pinsir is threatened out by revenge killers. Regirock and Qwilfish can also set entry hazards, which helps Pinsir break through walls.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Lapras is an unviable choice in PU. Despite decent stats and a passable offensive movepool letting it function as a rather threatening Choice Specs user, it is wholly outclassed by Jellicent; besides having the same Special Attack and Speed stats and a similar ability in Water Absorb, Jellicent has a broader offensive movepool and a considerably better defensive typing that lets it check prominent threats that force Lapras out, such as Primeape and Gurdurr. Jellicent's rich support movepool, which includes Taunt, Recover, and Trick Room, also allows it to run other offensive sets successfully without being constrained to Choice Specs. Lapras is also heavily outclassed by other offensive Water- and Ice-types such as Ludicolo, Aurorus, and Jynx which are considerably more threatening and can provide utility in weather, entry hazards, and speed control, making them much easier to fit on teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A physical set with Dragon Dance can be used but is weak even when set-up and is outclassed by physical Floatzel. Thunderbolt can be used over Ice Beam for more damage on Articuno, but it is not worth it especially because Articuno is not common and being Choice locked into Thunderbolt gives more setup opportunities than being locked into Hydro Pump. Waterium Z can be used for a surprise against foes like Type: Null and the ability to switch moves, but it's still weak. A Substitute + Toxic set can be used to cripple bulky walls like Audino, but this is very passive.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Primeape and Absol can all outspeed and heavily damage or OHKO Lapras; however, most of them cannot switch into any of Lapras's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon</strong>: Electric-type Pokemon such as Lanturn and Rotom-F really threaten Lapras, as they can do massive damage with STAB attacks. They also gain momentum with Volt Switch, as Lapras is often forced out, but they don't appreciate taking a hit.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon</strong>: Fighting-types such as Primeape and Assault Vest Hitmonchan can OHKO Lapras with their respective STAB attacks. Furthermore, Primeape can predict a switch and keep momentum up with U-turn, while Hitmonchan can spin away entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon</strong>: Grass-types such as Abomasnow and Victreebel offensively check Lapras, as they can pivot in on Hydro Pump and retaliate with their super effective STAB moves, though they have to be careful of Hidden Power Fire and Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Lapras is not only weak to Stealth Rock but also vulnerable to all entry hazards, which make it easier to wear down and limit its opportunities to switch onto the field. Lapras also does not appreciate any form of status because it lacks recovery.</p>",

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Freeze-Dry allows Lapras to threaten opposing Water-types like Gastrodon, Poliwrath, and Lanturn. Hidden Power Fire allows Lapras to 2HKO Ferroseed and OHKO Abomasnow.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>176 Speed EVs allow Lapras to outspeed Adamant Aggron, while also outspeeding other slow wallbreakers such as Drampa. Water Absorb is the preferred ability because it makes Lapras immune to all Water-type attacks, and its other abilities aren't very useful.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lapras is best used as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker to punch holes in the opponent's team, and a good way to start doing so is bringing it in against slower and passive Pokemon such as Spiritomb. Make sure to remove entry hazards with Pokemon like Hitmonchan before you bring Lapras onto the field, as entry hazards greatly cripple it. Identify your opponent's Hydro Pump switch-ins, and if they don't have any, it's practical to try wearing down the opposing team with repeated Hydro Pumps. If your opponent's team carries checks, Freeze-Dry can be used to chip switch-ins like Lanturn, while Hidden Power Fire can be used to lure and KO bulky Grass-types like Ferroseed and Abomasnow that take Hydro Pump with ease. Due to Lapras's great bulk and defensive typing, it should be used to pivot into predicted Water-type attacks from Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Floatzel so it can put pressure on the opposing team with Freeze-Dry or Hydro Pump. Lastly, be wary that predicting wrong comes with very big risks, as it could cost the team's momentum or end up giving Pokemon like Ludicolo setup opportunities when Lapras locks into Hydro Pump.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Lapras appreciates slow U-turn and Volt Switch support from Pokemon such as Silvally-Fairy and Eelektross, as they can bring in Lapras safely and prevent it from getting worn down. Silvally-Fairy checks Fighting-type Pokemon such as Hitmonchan and provides Defog support, while Eelektross is good at checking Electric-types such as Oricorio-E. Pokemon like Combusken that appreciate Lapras's ability to weaken walls such as Audino and check Water-types like Jellicent and Gastrodon also pair well with it. In return, Combusken is able to check offensive Grass-types such as Abomasnow and put pressure on Stealth Rock users like Ferroseed and Alolan Sandslash for Lapras. Pairing Lapras with entry hazard removal is ideal because it keeps Lapras from being worn down. Skuntank in particular is a good partner because it's a reliable Defog user that can chip away at Ferroseed, making wallbreaking easier for Lapras. Entry hazard support from Ferroseed is appreciated for making walls like Type: Null unable to pivot in on Hydro Pump as consistently. Finally, physical wallbreakers like Stoutland are ideal partners because they pressure specially defensive walls such as Clefairy and Audino.</p>"

  "Ditto": {
    "overview": "<p>Ditto is a rather unique Pokemon, as it has the ability Imposter, which allows it to copy the foe's moves and stats, apart from HP. This allows it to function as a decent anti-offense option and reliable revenge killer, as, with a Choice Scarf, it'll almost always outspeed the opposing Pokemon. Because of how Imposter functions, Ditto will have any entry hazard effects applied before it transforms, meaning that it'll only take neutral damage from Stealth Rock and ignore the Sticky Web Speed drop, allowing it to be a solid answer to Sticky Web teams. Ditto can also use its ability to scout movesets, providing information on what the opponent is running. Even though Ditto is decent against more offensive Pokemon, it struggles against bulky defensive set-up Pokemon, like Clefairy and Musharna, because Ditto is forced to run a Choice Scarf to properly function as a revenge killer. Ditto also has a rather low HP stat, meaning it struggles to switch in or take hits, even when transformed. Imposter and Transform also fail against Pokemon that have set up a Substitute, leaving Ditto unable to revenge kill Pokemon like Oricorio-G and Alolan Dugtrio. While Ditto can act as a deterrent to certain setup Pokemon at Team Preview, it often struggles in practice, as the opponent can often play around it and weaken it enough for it to be unable to function as intended.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Due to Ditto only having one move, its only available other option is altering its IVs to change which Hidden Power type it is using. An IV spread of 31 / 31 / 30 / 30 / 31 / 1 allows Ditto to use Hidden Power Grass to hit foes like Gastrodon and Lanturn.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Due to how Imposter works, it fails if the foe is already behind a Substitute, meaning that Oricorio-G, Alolan Dugtrio, and Life Orb Haunter can all counter Ditto once they're behind one.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Clefairy, Musharna, and Gurdurr are able to use Ditto as setup bait, as Ditto isn't able to do enough damage to any of them.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room Sweepers</strong>: Even though Ditto copies the Speed IVs and EVs of the opposing Pokemon, the use of a Choice Scarf means that it is borderline useless against Trick Room Pokemon like Jellicent, Crabominable, and Ursaring.</p>",

      "Imposter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Transform is the only move Ditto can learn naturally and will almost never be used, as Imposter transforms Ditto into the opposing Pokemon when it switches in.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With Imposter, Ditto copies all of its foe's stats except for HP, so 252 HP EVs are used to maximize Ditto's bulk. A Choice Scarf is used to ensure Ditto outspeeds setup sweepers. The IVs chosen allow Ditto to use Hidden Power Fire against Victreebel and hit Steel-types like Ferroseed and Alolan Sandslash on the switch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ditto is almost always used as a revenge killer, capable of outspeeding boosted and unboosted foes alike thanks to copying their stats and holding a Choice Scarf. Ditto is capable of revenge killing foes like Oricorio-G, Stoutland, and Pinsir, even if the first and last have received boosts from either Calm Mind or Z-Me First. Against stall and balance, Ditto can opt to try and have its Choice Scarf removed with Knock Off so it can freely switch moves and essentially PP stall these types of teams. Ditto shouldn't be used to try to take on bulkier setup sweepers like Musharna and Clefairy, as their access to recovery and ability to switch moves means Ditto will almost always lose. Ditto should avoid switching directly into even strong resisted attacks due to its rather low HP stat. In matches where Ditto isn't required to check setup sweepers, it can use its Imposter ability to scout the movesets of the opponent's Pokemon; this can also help reveal what item the opposing Pokemon is using.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The way Ditto functions means that it can essentially be placed on almost every team  and thus has no real set teammates. Stall teams may use Ditto as a way to deal with powerful wallbreakers like Nasty Plot Alolan Raichu and Swords Dance Pinsir, both of which put immense pressure on most forms of stall. On the other hand, offensive and hyper offensive teams can use Ditto if they lack a revenge killer or Choice Scarf user; it can act as a deterrent to Pokemon like Shell Smash Carracosta and even sun and rain teams. Even though Ditto functions on almost every archetype, it does appreciate entry hazard control, as both Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes can easily wear it down if left unattended. Hazard removers like Skuntank, Swanna, and Hitmonchan are all valuable for Ditto; Skuntank is especially notable because it can absorb Toxic Spikes as it switches in.</p>"

  "Flareon": {
    "overview": "<p>Flareon might look good to use based on its excellent Attack and good Special Defense stats. However, its horrid Speed and shallow movepool make it hard to use. Furthermore, it has no defensive utility outside of Flash Fire due to its bad defensive typing, vulnerability to hazards, and inability to switch into unresisted attacks. Flareon is one of the few Fire-types in the tier, as well as one of the fewer physical Fire-types, which gives it a small niche; however, it struggles to be a good wallbreaker due to its low Speed stat and the recoil from Flare Blitz. It is outclassed by other wallbreakers like Combusken, Stoutland, and Dodrio due to their better Speed stats and movepools.</p>",
    "sets": {"Wallbreaker": {"description": "<p>This set is meant for Flareon to become a dangerous wallbreaker. However, its poor Defense and Speed, weaknesses to common offensive types, and vulnerability to Stealth Rock limits its opportunities to switch in or fire off an attack. In addition, Rock-types like Omastar can easily come in on Flareon if it is not locked into Superpower. It is outclassed by other wallbreakers like Stoutland and Dodrio because of their better Speed and Stoutland's access to Scrappy and neutrality to Stealth Rock.</p>"}},

  "Omastar": {
    "overview": "<p>Omastar's vast movepool, high Special Attack, and access to Shell Smash make it a threatening setup sweeper able to muscle through common special walls like Cryogonal and Audino and Water-type checks such as Lanturn and Jellicent depending on its Z-Crystal. Its decently high Defense and typing give it plenty of setup opportunities against threats like Silvally-Fairy, Alolan Sandslash, and Skuntank. This allows it to take full advantage of its ability Weak Armor, which allows it to outspeed common revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Primeape. Omastar's typing also allows it to force out defensive Pokemon like Regirock, giving it more setup opportunities. Moreover, its access to both Spikes and Stealth Rock makes it a potent lead on more offensive teams, which is further enhanced by its ability to threaten most Defoggers and spinners such as Lurantis, Articuno, and Cryogonal depending on what it decides to run. However, Omastar's typing grants it weaknesses to common typings like Fighting, Ground, and Grass, which, when combined with its atrocious special bulk, give it a harder time setting up and make it easy to revenge kill with moves like Mach Punch. Due to its poor Speed, it remains slower than Choice Scarf users like Primeape even after a Shell Smash, meaning it often can be reliant on triggering Weak Armor and left easier to pick off with a priority move like Sucker Punch. Omastar's Speed also hinders its job as a lead, as most Defoggers and spinners outspeed it and threaten it if it isn't running the right coverage. Lastly, Omastar suffers from competition with Carracosta and Ludicolo as sweepers, with the former carrying Aqua Jet and having better bulk, making it harder to revenge kill, and the latter having a superior Speed tier, typing, and movepool. As a lead, Lycanroc is considerably faster and has access to Taunt and Endeavor, while Qwilfish is also faster and has a superior typing along with Intimidate.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Specs set is a potent option thanks to Omastar's incredibly large movepool, high Special Attack, and Weak Armor, making it very hard to switch into and potentially hard to revenge kill. It can also make use of Omastar's access to Spikes in the last moveslot to eventually overwhelm answers like Jellicent and Ferroseed. Chople Berry allows Omastar to withstand Primeape's Close Combat, Dodrio's Jump Kick, and Hitmonchan's and Gurdurr's Mach Punch, making it considerably harder to revenge kill. However, it does miss out on some firepower when not holding a Z-Crystal and is easier to revenge kill with other Pokemon when not holding a White Herb. If Omastar is holding Groundium Z, Stone Edge is an option over Ice Beam on the Shell Smash set that targets Flying- and Ice-types like Articuno, Swanna, and Cryogonal. However, this leaves Omastar unable to hit Grass-types like Leafeon and a healthy Torterra, and a boosted Hydro Pump has a very solid chance to OHKO Cryogonal after Stealth Rock. A physically defensive set with both Stealth Rock and Spikes is an option, although it suffers from immense competition from other Water- and Rock-types like Qwilfish and Regirock, which are faster and bulkier, respectively. Omastar's poor Special Defense also makes it a pretty mediocre switch-in to Flying-types like Oricorio-G compared to Regirock. Ferroseed is another entry hazard setter Omastar has to compete against, as it also has access to both Stealth Rock and Spikes. Its typing, overall bulk, and ability make it the superior choice on most teams, making this Omastar set very hard to justify. Lastly, Hidden Power Fire is a very niche option over Ice Beam or Rock Tomb on the lead set, allowing Omastar to hit Ferroseed at the cost of struggling more against Dragon-, Grass-, and Ice-types like Altaria, Torterra, and Cryogonal.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Jellicent, Gastrodon, and a healthy Lanturn can shrug off Omastar's moves and easily KO it back in Lanturn's case or 2HKO it in Jellicent's case. Assault Vest Lanturn also outspeeds Modest Omastar pre-setup and OHKOes it with Volt Switch after it has taken some minor chip damage. However, both Jellicent and Lanturn struggle against Tectonic Rage variants, and Gastrodon struggles against Hidden Power Grass ones. Offensive Water-types like offensive Trick Room Jellicent and Floatzel can threaten Omastar pre-setup, with the former even using it as setup fodder because it tanks a boosted Earth Power pretty comfortably.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Articuno, Cryogonal, Toxic Audino, and Crabominable all pose an issue to Omastar if it has already used its Z-Move or lacks Waterium Z. However, if it does have Waterium Z, Omastar doesn't struggle to get past any of them, and Articuno and a slightly chipped Cryogonal both fall to a boosted Hydro Pump after Stealth Rock. Ferroseed, on the other hand, doesn't really struggle against non-Tectonic Rage set and can cripple Omastar with Leech Seed or Toxic. Roselia is another issue, although it's not very common and usually finds itself in range of a boosted Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Choice Scarf users like Primeape and Punishment Skuntank can revenge kill Omastar with almost no difficulties, although the latter struggles against White Herb variants and is slower than Timid Omastar. Moreover, they both can't deal with Endure Omastar, as they end up triggering Weak Armor. Choice Scarf Rotom-F doesn't trigger Weak Armor and is largely unaffected by Endure. Pokemon like Victreebel and Simisear that outspeed Omastar before it has used Shell Smash can also effectively deal with it. However, none of these examples can reliably switch into Omastar, and they're all slower than it if Weak Armor got triggered.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Pokemon like Gurdurr, Hitmonchan, and Choice Band Absol can all revenge kill Omastar after it has taken some chip damage with their respective priority moves. However, outside of Hitmonchan, none of them can switch into Omastar. Absol is also reliant on Sucker Punch, meaning Omastar can take advantage of that by using Shell Smash again.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam hits Grass- and Dragon-types like Leafeon, Torterra, and Drampa and is Omastar's best option to hit Ludicolo. Earth Power hits Lanturn and Steel-types like Alolan Sandslash for super effective damage, while Hidden Power Grass is a weaker option that forgoes OHKOing pivot Lanturn after Stealth Rock for pressuring Jellicent and Gastrodon more effectively, OHKOing the latter. Endure's an option, as it allows Omastar to survive a hit from faster Choice Scarf users that trigger Weak Armor, like Primeape and Dodrio.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Modest nature allows Omastar to always OHKO specially defensive Articuno and Assault Vest Crabominable with Hydro Vortex after using Shell Smash. A Modest nature also allows it to 2HKO Assault Vest Lanturn with Hidden Power Grass. However, a Timid nature sacrifices some of Omastar's power in exchange for some Speed, which makes it faster than Choice Scarf Kabutops and Skuntank after a Shell Smash. Groundium Z allows Omastar to get past Water-types like Jellicent and Lanturn with a boosted Tectonic Rage, which is also its best option against Ferroseed. However, this leaves Omastar unable to get past Pokemon like Articuno. White Herb resets Omastar's Defense and Special Defense after using Shell Smash or after a Weak Armor boost, making it harder to revenge kill.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Omastar can be brought in early- to mid-game via U-turn or Volt Switch on Pokemon like Skuntank and Regirock to punch holes in the opposing team or set up, making it easier for a teammate to clean late-game when its switch-ins, like Lanturn, are weakened. If Omastar is not running Endure, it should aim to set up when faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf Primeape and Dodrio have been KOed if it's needed to clean. However, if running Endure, it should wait until its switch-ins like Lanturn and Jellicent are in range of its attacks due its lack of appropriate coverage. Omastar should aim to set up against Pokemon it forces out like Skuntank, Regirock, and Mudsdale and Choice-locked threats like Stoutland, Primeape, and Dodrio. Omastar's respectable physical bulk allows it to switch into weaker, resisted physical attacks like Skuntank's Poison Jab and Alolan Sandslash's Icicle Crash to take advantage of Weak Armor, although doing so too often leaves Omastar in range of priority moves like Choice Band Absol's Sucker Punch and Gurdurr's Mach Punch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers like Stoutland, Absol, and Victreebel pressure common answers to Omastar like Gastrodon, Ferroseed, and Lanturn, with the former two Pursuit trapping them and the latter inviting in Flying-types like Dodrio and Oricorio-G for Omastar to take advantage of. Musharna also works, as it can force Pokemon out with Future Sight and support Omastar with Healing Wish, giving it more setup opportunities and allowing it to set up Shell Smash multiple times to wallbreak itself. Wallbreakers are especially important if Omastar is running Endure, as it struggles to break through Lanturn and Jellicent. In return, Omastar deals with physically bulky Pokemon like Regirock and Tangela that answer Stoutland and Absol. If not running Endure, Omastar appreciates Pokemon able to deal with revenge killers like Choice Scarf Primeape and Dodrio. Skuntank is a good option, as it can effectively KO them with Sucker Punch and Aftermath as well as Pursuit trap the aforementioned Jellicent and Cryogonal. In exchange, Omastar deals with Regirock and Mudsdale. Substitute Haunter and Swords Dance Silvally-Fairy take advantage of them if they're locked into a Fighting-type move and can make them wary about using it. Omastar greatly appreciates Spikes, as they put Pokemon like Lanturn and Roselia in range of moves like Earth Power and Ice Beam after it has used Shell Smash. They also chip its offensive answers like Kangaskhan and Choice Scarf Skuntank. Ferroseed is a solid partner, chipping Omastar's answers even further thanks to Iron Barbs. U-turn and Volt Switch users like Silvally-Fairy and Eelektross can bring Omastar in against defensive behemoths like Regirock and non-Toxic Audino they struggle against, giving Omastar more setup opportunities. Parting Shot and Memento support from the likes of Alolan Persian and Choice Scarf Skuntank is also appreciated, giving Omastar an easier time setting up. However, Alolan Persian and Omastar do compete for the Z-Crystal. Finally, other cleaners like Combusken and Calm Mind Oricorio-E can wear down shared checks like Jellicent and Articuno with Omastar, giving one or the other a considerably easier time cleaning. Combusken also pressures bulky Ice-types that threaten non-Waterium Z Omastar, like Crabominable, while Oricorio-E can pivot into Fighting- and Grass-types like Hitmonchan and Victreebel before Omastar has used Shell Smash. In return, Omastar takes advantage of some Fairy- and Rock-types like Carbink and Regirock that switch into Combusken and Oricorio-E.</p>"

      "Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam threatens Grass- and Dragon-types like Leafeon and Drampa. It also pressures Lurantis and Altaria, which are important targets because they would otherwise freely get rid of Omastar's entry hazards with Defog. Rock Tomb is an alternative that hits Ice- and Flying-types like Cryogonal, Articuno, and Swanna, which otherwise don't have much difficulty shrugging off Omastar's attacks and get rid of its entry hazards. It's run over Stone Edge because its Speed drop allows Omastar to outspeed the aforementioned Pokemon and effectively 2HKO them, force them out, or set another layer of entry hazards.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Focus Sash is used to allow Omastar to set at least one layer of entry hazards and trigger Weak Armor, allowing it to potentially set two layers. It also allows Omastar to come in later during the game to revenge kill a threat like Lycanroc. A Timid nature makes Omastar faster than Aggron and Modest Aurorus, allowing it to pressure them offensively.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Omastar should either be led with or be brought in early-game to set entry hazards, as this allows it to take advantage of its Focus Sash when entry hazards still haven't been set by the opponent to withstand hits like Eelektross's Giga Drain and Rotom-F's Thunderbolt. Depending on its coverage, it struggles against some Pokemon and Defoggers and spinners; without Ice Beam, Grass- and Dragon-types like Lurantis and Altaria can come in and remove Omastar's entry hazards with Defog, while if lacking Rock Tomb, it can't keep its own entry hazards on the field against Cryogonal and Articuno. This means it should either switch to a partner that can take advantage of them or keep on setting entry hazards. Omastar can be kept for later on in the game to switch into Pokemon like Kangaskhan once. Alolan Sandslash is another example, as it often tries to get rid of Omastar's entry hazards with Rapid Spin. This allows Omastar to take advantage of Weak Armor to set more entry hazards, revenge kill the opponent's Pokemon, or deter Alolan Sandslash from using Rapid Spin in the first place. This is especially true if its Focus Sash was kept intact.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set mainly fits on hyper offense teams. Wallbreakers and cleaners like Dodrio and Silvally-Fairy greatly appreciate the entry hazards Omastar sets to wear down their switch-ins like Regirock. Omastar also invites in Fighting-types like Hitmonchan and Primeape for Silvally-Fairy to take advantage of and can pressure Pokemon like Mudsdale and the aforementioned Regirock Dodrio and Silvally-Fairy struggle against. Volt Switch and U-turn users like Eelektross and Silvally-Fairy make for incredible partners, as they appreciate Spikes weakening the opponent's team further. They also give Omastar more opportunities to come in and set entry hazards, while it weakens some of their mutual switch-ins like Cryogonal and Ferroseed. Primeape deters the usage of Defog thanks to Defiant and also appreciates the entry hazards Omastar sets, allowing it to weaken switch-ins like Jellicent and Mudsdale faster. Spinblockers make for good partners, as they can come in on Pokemon like Hitmonchan that force Omastar out to try to get rid of the entry hazards it sets. Oricorio-G is a prime example, as it can also use Taunt against Defoggers like Altaria. It also greatly appreciates Omastar setting entry hazards up, weakening its switch-ins like Lanturn and Regirock, and dealing with spinners it struggles against like Alolan Sandslash. Offensive Cryogonal appreciates Omastar's entry hazards, as they allow it to get past Regirock, Ferroseed, and Eelektross more quickly. In return, it pressures the Grass- and Water-types that threaten Omastar, like Victreebel and Lanturn, and can get rid of the opponent's entry hazards with Rapid Spin, keeping Omastar's Focus Sash intact.</p>"

  "Kabutops": {
    "overview": "<p>Kabutops is a solid Choice Scarf user that has plenty of utility in checking top threats such as Oricorio-E due to its unique combination of typing and Speed. Unlike most Choice Scarf users, it functions more as a utility revenge killer, with excellent support options such as Rapid Spin and Knock Off, and not as a check to most setup sweepers due to its mediocre base Speed. Kabutops is also notable for its role on rain teams, as its solid Speed, decent Attack, access to Swords Dance, and excellent STAB combination all make it highly suited to become one of the tier's top rain sweepers. Kabutops gets by on key resistances to Fire, Flying, Ice, and Normal, but its typing is a double-edged sword, leaving it with common weaknesses to Fighting, Ground, Electric, and Grass. This leaves it vulnerable to many coverage moves such as Kangaskhan's Earthquake and Dodrio's Jump Kick, and this can often limit its opportunities for setup or revenge killing. Additionally, outside of rain, Kabutops is prone to being revenge killed by common Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Dodrio and struggles with how common Mach Punch Hitmonchan and Gurdurr are. Ultimately, Kabutops faces a lot of competition from faster Choice Scarf users such as Dodrio, Primeape, and Swanna, which are far more capable at revenge killing, and only sets itself apart with its unique set of resistances and ability to remove entry hazards.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Band turns Kabutops into a powerful wallbreaker that can benefit massively from access to Weak Armor. However, it is also extremely prediction reliant and needs to play extremely well around Pokemon that can tank multiple of its moves with ease, such as Ferroseed or Gurdurr. Waterfall is a worthwhile alternative to Liquidation that passes up slight boost in power for the chance to make opposing Pokemon flinch. Kabutops can be used as a suicide lead for hyper offensive teams with a Focus Sash, Weak Armor, and Stealth Rock. Although it faces tight competition from other leads such as Omastar, Aurorus, and Lycanroc, which have multiple entry hazards, more utility outside of setting Stealth Rock, and more offensive presence, respectively, Kabutops can remove the opponent's entry hazards with Rapid Spin, allowing you to take an early lead in the entry hazard game. Swords Dance sets can be run outside of rain teams, although they ought to utilize Weak Armor to make up for their lack of Speed without Swift Swim being active. However, Lycanroc and Carracosta tend to be much more useful due to the former's immediate Speed and the latter's ease of setting up and higher Attack. Offensive Rapid Spin sets are also workable for non-Choice Scarf Kabutops, although there is very little reason to use them over Pokemon such as Shiftry and Hitmonchan. Toxic can cripple switch-ins such as Tangela, Poliwrath, and Gastrodon, but is extremely difficult to justify using over better options and is extremely exploitable if Choice Scarf Kabutops locks itself into the status move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Poliwrath is one of the best switch-ins to Kabutops, as it is immune to Liquidation, resists Stone Edge, and threatens to OHKO Kabutops with Focus Blast, only fearing a boosted Superpower. Gurdurr has the bulk to take a +2 Liquidation from non-Life Orb Kabutops in the rain and threatens to KO it with Drain Punch. Both of these Pokemon can also pick Kabutops off with Vacuum Wave and Mach Punch, respectively. Hitmonchan can also be a nuisance with Mach Punch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Rotom-F can easily revenge kill Choice Scarf Kabutops, as it is somewhat frail. Very few foes outspeed Kabutops under rain, but Choice Scarf Alolan Raichu can revenge kill non-Aqua Jet rain sweeper Kabutops.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Kabutops can struggle to break through Pokemon such as Tangela, Qwilfish, Ferroseed, Torterra, and Pyukumuku. Although they must be careful about taking a boosted Z-Move and don't appreciate losing their item, all of these Pokemon can KO Kabutops or cripple it with status.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: Choice Scarf Aurorus and Abomasnow can remove Kabutops's rain, outspeed it, and KO it with Freeze-Dry or Giga Drain, although a weakened Aurorus is vulnerable to Aqua Jet and neither fares especially well versus Choice Scarf Kabutops.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off enables Kabutops to cripple switch-ins that are reliant on their item for bulk, such as Gurdurr and Tangela, or recovery, such as Poliwrath, Gastrodon, and Qwilfish. Rapid Spin allows Kabutops to serve as an emergency entry hazard remover, with its heightened Speed and positive matchup against spinblockers like Oricorio-G giving it an easier time clearing its side of the field. Superpower is an option to reliably revenge kill Modest Omastar after a Shell Smash, OHKO Aggron and Alolan Sandslash, and deal more damage to Ferroseed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Swift Swim gives Kabutops more utility in case of facing an opposing rain team, as it can outspeed and KO rain sweepers such as Ludicolo with slight chip damage, although Battle Armor's ability to prevent critical hits can be helpful.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Kabutops is best used as a pivot into offensive threats it has a type advantage against, such as Dodrio and Simisear. Kabutops will rarely be a completely safe switch-in to said threats; it cannot comfortably switch into Dodrio's Jump Kick and Simisear's Grass Knot. However, with good prediction, Kabutops can limit the opponent's ability to spam moves it can switch into and keep top threats such as Stoutland on their toes. Once Kabutops has managed to come in safely, use Knock Off and Rapid Spin aggressively when possible. Taking advantage of a forced switch to remove entry hazards or cripple a switch-in such as Tangela can reap huge dividends late-game. Kabutops won't have much longevity, so make sure to keep a close tab on what it needs to accomplish in any given game and avoid risking it recklessly if, for example, it will need to stick around to remove Qwilfish's Spikes later in the match or revenge kill Calm Mind Oricorio-G. Keep in mind that all of its moves can be exploited by certain setup sweepers if Kabutops opts to lock itself into them. In particular, Rapid Spin and Knock Off allow many setup sweepers such as Lycanroc and Carracosta to set up with Swords Dance or Shell Smash practically risk-free. If your team finds itself pressured by a particular setup sweeper, make sure that Kabutops avoids locking itself into one of the moves that might give the sweeper the chance it needs to sweep your team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that are vulnerable to entry hazards such as Aurorus and Lanturn appreciate Kabutops's Rapid Spin support. However, Kabutops is prone to being spinblocked by many of the tier's common Ghost-types, so a secondary entry hazard remover such as Lurantis or Shiftry is advisable. Teams that use their own dedicated entry hazard setters such as Smeargle and Qwilfish and don't want to Defog away their own Sticky Web or Spikes should consider using Kabutops for entry hazard removal. Kabutops also benefits noticeably from Spikes, as they can chip away at many of its grounded checks, including Gurdurr and Tangela. Fighting-type checks such as Musharna and Haunter are needed to keep Pokemon such as Primeape and the aforementioned Gurdurr in check for Kabutops, and additional switch-ins to Ground-, Grass-, and Electric-type attacks such as Oricorio-E, Skuntank, and Mudsdale are advisable. On the other hand, Kabutops can be excellent support for Flying- and Fire-weak Pokemon such as Gurdurr and Jynx, helping teams using them to keep offensive momentum even when forced out. Kabutops is fairly mediocre at revenge killing setup sweepers such as Jynx and Pinsir, so strong priority users such as Kangaskhan and Alolan Raticate can help keep these sweepers in check. Kabutops appreciates being paired with strong wallbreakers such as Aurorus and Stoutland, since it struggles with most physically bulky Pokemon. In the same vein, Kabutops lets many bulky Grass- and Water-types such as Tangela and Poliwrath switch in fairly freely, so checks to these types of Pokemon such as Altaria and Jynx are advisable.</p>"
      },
      "Rain Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Superpower gives Kabutops neutral coverage for Poliwrath, which would otherwise completely wall it, and the ability for non-Life Orb sets to OHKO Aggron without rain. Alternatively, Aqua Jet can be used to pick off Pokemon that outspeed Kabutops outside of rain such as Choice Scarf Dodrio as well as hit Choice Scarf Aurorus, which is otherwise a highly problematic Pokemon for rain teams to handle. It can also pick off a weakened Gurdurr before Mach Punch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Swift Swim allows Kabutops to outspeed almost the entire tier under rain without the need for a Choice Scarf or a Speed-boosting nature. Rockium Z gives Kabutops an excellent nuke to OHKO many Pokemon otherwise capable of tanking a hit such as physically defensive Qwilfish. It also avoids the need to rely on Stone Edge's subpar accuracy for a single turn. Life Orb is another solid option that keeps Kabutops's power level consistently high, although the recoil can put Kabutops in range of certain priority users. Lum Berry is another alternative to set up a Swords Dance versus status users such as Jellicent.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swords Dance dramatically increases Kabutops's power and threat level, so try to set up with it when possible. Kabutops can set up versus many Choice item users and most defensive Pokemon, such as Stoutland Choice-locked into Return and bulky Oricorio-G, as well as on forced switches versus Pokemon like Scyther. If using Life Orb, be very careful about allowing Kabutops to take too much chip damage, or it won't be able to sweep. Kabutops should try to avoid being used until rain has been set up, as without rain Kabutops finds itself much weaker and slower. However, it may sometimes be needed to revenge kill certain threats outside of rain. Choice Scarf Aurorus in particular is a large threat that many rain teams may rely on Aqua Jet Kabutops to revenge kill. Normally Z-Moves ought to be played carefully and preserved for one specific instance, but so few Pokemon are capable of switching into a +2 Continental Crush with rain up and prevent Kabutops from grabbing a KO on the next turn that it is often fine to simply use it as soon as the opportunity prevents itself, especially since entering into a drawn-out series of predictions with your opponent about when you'll finally use the Z-Move may waste precious rain turns. One exception to this is a full-health Gurdurr, however.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is meant for rain teams only. Rain setters such as Liepard and Volbeat give Kabutops not only the weather it needs to function effectively, but also free opportunities to switch in with their slow U-turn. Fellow rain sweepers like Omastar, Qwilfish, and Ludicolo can help break down teams in tandem with Kabutops. Qwilfish is an especially good partner, since both Pokemon can break down physically bulky annoyances like Type: Null with their Swords Dance sets. Qwilfish also checks Fighting-types like Gurdurr for Kabutops and can absorb Toxic Spikes, which are extremely annoying for Life Orb Kabutops. Checks to Choice Scarf Aurorus, such as Alolan Sandslash and Assault Vest Crabominable, are very important for rain teams, as it can easily revenge kill Kabutops lacking Aqua Jet due to its ability removing rain. However, these Pokemon may be somewhat difficult to fit onto rain teams.</p>"

  "Articuno": {
    "overview": "<p>Articuno carves itself a good niche in the PU metagame, as it has good offenses, respectable bulk, a useful ability in Pressure, and a decent Speed tier. These traits allow Articuno to run effective offensive and defensive sets, capable of breaking weaker teams or stalling out defensive threats such as Audino. Articuno's good bulk also allows it to blanket check many offensive Pokemon like Victreebel, Skuntank, and Swanna and deal with them with its STAB moves in return. However, Articuno does have a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, which limits its opportunities to switch in freely. As a result, Articuno must be partnered with a teammate that can remove entry hazards. In addition, Articuno's poor defensive typing prevents it from being a fully defensive wall, and its average offenses make it too weak to be a fully offensive sweeper. Articuno competes with other Ice-types in the tier, namely Aurorus, Jynx, and Abomasnow, all of which are more versatile and stronger offensively. Despite outspeeding the likes of Skuntank and Stoutland, Articuno sits in a slightly awkward Speed tier, leaving it outpaced by common threats like Kangaskhan, Primeape, and Dodrio. Finally, Articuno has trouble in some matchups versus more offensively based teams, as it can be more easily pressured by strong wallbreakers. Those teams also tend to set up Stealth Rock more easily and are able to apply more pressure to the hazard remover.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A spread of 248 HP / 8 SpA / 252 Spe can be used, at the expense of power, to have a better chance of keeping its Substitute intact from weak attacks like defensive Qwilfish's Waterfall and specially offensive Skuntank's Dark Pulse. An Agility + Flyinium Z set can be a threatening late-game sweeper but can be tricky to pull off because it is still often too weak offensively to sweep unless all of its checks and counters have been eliminated or severely weakened.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Articuno loses almost half of its health when switching into Stealth Rock, which limits its longevity and defensive capabilities.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Alolan Sandslash, Metang, and Aggron all threaten Articuno with their STAB move while walling defensive Articuno entirely. Alolan Sandslash and Aggron have to be wary of Hidden Power Fighting from offensive Articuno though.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: Pokemon such as Alolan Dugtrio, Alolan Raichu, and Lycanroc are all capable of utilizing their advantageous offensive typing and strength to OHKO or 2HKO Articuno.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Pokemon like Type: Null and Audino can take on Articuno's average offensive stats. The former can set up on it and beat it one-on-one, while the latter can lock Articuno into a move via Encore and switch out to an appropriate teammate. However, Audino must resort to PP stalling Articuno to truly beat it.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Freeze-Dry is preferred over other Ice-type attacks so that Articuno can reliably damage Water-types like Lanturn, Jellicent, and Omastar. Hidden Power Fighting targets Steel- and Rock-types such as Alolan Sandslash, Aggron, and Aurorus.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Flyinium Z grants Articuno a perfectly accurate Flying-type nuke that lets it easily dispatch of threats such as Skuntank, Stoutland, and Hitmonchan without having to risk missing Hurricane.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Articuno is best used mid- to late-game to clean teams once checks such as Regirock, Cryogonal, and Metang have been weakened or removed entirely. If using Articuno early-game, keep in mind that it commonly draws in Steel-types such as Alolan Sandslash and Aggron; therefore, it is capable of luring in and KOing such Pokemon with Hidden Power Fighting after Supersonic Skystrike. Articuno struggles to break counters such as Type: Null and Cryogonal due to their bulk and recovery, so it's advised to double switch to checks to these Pokemon to pressure or eliminate them. Articuno is susceptible to being worn down by Stealth Rock and weaker attacks from the likes of Swanna, Jellicent, and Roselia. Take advantage of its ability to force switches against Pokemon like Gurdurr and Tangela by recovering health with Roost.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock severely limits Articuno's ability to switch in and wallbreak, so entry hazard removal from the likes of Skuntank, Hitmonchan, and Kabutops is required. Articuno also appreciates Kabutops pressuring Fire-types as well as Lycanroc. Similarly, Articuno benefits from teammates such as Mudsdale and Poliwrath, which can switch into Rock-type attacks aimed its way. Mudsdale also provides Stealth Rock support, which aids Articuno in wallbreaking. Despite Articuno's good coverage, it struggles to break blanket special walls such as Audino, Type: Null, and Assault Vest Eelektross, as well as Rock-types like Regirock and Lycanroc. Pokemon such as Gurdurr and Primeape put immense pressure on them; additionally, Primeape can safely bring Articuno into battle with U-turn. In return, Articuno can pressure Pokemon such as Tangela and Mudsdale for them. Stoutland and Choice Band Dodrio appreciate Articuno's ability to weaken or remove Steel-types like Aggron and Alolan Sandslash, enabling them to spam their STAB attacks more freely. In return, the latter two help weaken Regirock.</p>"
      },
      "SubRoost": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute allows Articuno to buffer weaker attacks and avoid status. It is also the key component to stalling out the foe's PP. Roost is Articuno's reliable source of recovery that keeps it healthy throughout the match and also allows Articuno to continue using Substitute. Freeze-Dry is Articuno's primary STAB move and has super effective coverage on Water-types like Lanturn and Floatzel.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Pressure allows Articuno to whittle the foe's PP much faster and stall out moves. Leftovers gives Articuno passive recovery and helps it set up more Substitutes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Send out Articuno as early as possible if the opponent does not have a direct counter to it, such as Metang, Probopass, or Type: Null. Since Articuno's offensive coverage is very threatening, don't hesitate to simply attack if the opponent cannot switch into its Ice- or Flying- coverage well. Switch Articuno into passive Pokemon or Pokemon that don't threaten it offensively, such as Clefairy, but be cautious of status moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave. Then, set up Substitute or just attack without a Substitute if they are within range of being KOed. Repeatedly set up Substitute against foes that are slower and have moves with low PP in order to stall them out, such as Regirock's Stone Edge. Use Roost when moves have either run out of PP or have missed. Avoid switching in Articuno when Stealth Rock is on the field unless absolutely necessary. If it must switch in, it should almost always use Roost to recover, though this makes it lose momentum, makes it vulnerable to attacks or status, or gives the opponent a free switch. Articuno is best used as a Pokemon that breaks down the opponent's team for teammates to sweep, so focus primarily on chipping and whittling down the foes rather than sweeping late-game on its own.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Articuno's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock means entry hazard control is required. Therefore, hazard removers like Hitmonchan, Skuntank, and Lurantis are mandatory. Hitmonchan is notable, as it can take on many strong special attacking Fire- and Electric-types such as Combusken and Eelektross. Articuno appreciates answers to Steel-type Pokemon, most notably Alolan Sandslash and Aggron, so offensive Ground- and Fighting-types such as Golurk, Primeape, and Gurdurr are good partners. In return, Articuno can help pressure Pokemon like Tangela and Clefairy that serve as defensive checks to them. Fire-types like Simisear and Combusken check Articuno well, so Articuno welcomes checks to them such as Regirock and Lanturn. In return, Articuno can beat Ground- and Grass-types, like Mudsdale and Lurantis, that threaten them. Pokemon that take on Electric-types, such as Lanturn, Gastrodon, Type: Null, and Eelektross, are also appreciated. Stealth Rock support from the likes of Regirock and Clefairy chips Articuno's checks and counters and helps it beat them more easily. Pivots, namely slow U-turn and Volt Switch users like Eelektross, Lanturn, and Type: Null, can help Articuno come in more safely. Late-game cleaners and sweepers such as Lycanroc, Carracosta, and Gurdurr appreciate Articuno's ability to stall out and break down walls for them. Wallbreakers like Stoutland, Drampa, and Aggron that break through defensive Pokemon that Articuno can't stall out, namely Type: Null, are appreciated.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog supports not only Articuno's teammates but also itself, as steering its side clear of Stealth Rock is an integral part of keeping Articuno healthy. Articuno will have many chances to make use of this move thanks to its ability to switch into many common entry hazard setters such as Qwilfish and Roselia with little to no risk. Freeze-Dry is Articuno's Ice-type STAB attack with added coverage on Water-type Pokemon, punishing Qwilfish, Lanturn, and Carracosta. Heal Bell cures Articuno and its teammates of status conditions. Alternatively, Toxic is a staple on the bulkier and stall teams that Articuno best fits in as a top-notch option for wearing down defensive and offensive Pokemon alike. Substitute takes advantage of Articuno's Pressure against Pokemon by reliably stalling out moves like Regirock's Stone Edge or Rock Slide and Aggron's Head Smash. Haze is a unique choice that negates stat boosts, which is particularly notable for disrupting Calm Mind users such as Spiritomb and Clefairy throughout the match.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Pressure allows Articuno to stall out crucial moves from opposing Pokemon to alleviate pressure for the rest of the team. Leftovers gradually restores Articuno's HP and, with Roost, makes Articuno as durable as possible. 248 HP EVs and 208 EVs in Special Defense provide Articuno with great special bulk, notably allowing it to always survive a Choice Specs-boosted Blizzard from Aurorus after Stealth Rock damage and safely Roost off the damage afterward. 56 Speed EVs let Articuno outspeed Modest Jellicent and Jolly Aggron, letting it PP stall or beat them with Roost, Substitute, or Freeze-Dry, respectively. Outspeeding Aurorus is noteworthy as well; Articuno can use Roost first to gain a resistance to its Ice-type STAB attacks and reduce its Rock weakness, allowing it to tank subsequent hits and stall out Aurorus's limited PP with ease.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>One must keep track of the PP of moves of opposing Pokemon that Articuno can be in a position to stall, as this is effectively Articuno's way to secure a win for its team, whether it's through stalling out Aggron's Head Smash or Clefairy's Moonblast PP. Articuno can also stall a single Pokemon out of all its Toxic PP, which is great for dealing with individual users like Clefairy. Otherwise, Articuno should prioritize utilizing Pressure by proactively switching into Stealth Rock users and other hazard users that can't directly threaten it like Clefairy and Qwilfish and removing them with ease. The threat of Freeze-Dry deters Qwilfish enough to force it out as opposed to Taunting, so this can be used to Articuno's advantage. If the opponent already manages to have Stealth Rock out on the field, it is highly advised to rely on the secondary remover to clear them out on the field instead of recklessly switching Articuno in to remove them. Utilize options like Heal Bell or Substitute to deal with potential status ailments. If using Heal Bell, Articuno should directly switch into Toxic users that can't threaten it, as with Pressure it can win the PP war against any individual Toxic user. Articuno should keep itself as healthy as possible with Roost, as it can act as a secondary pivot into strong special attackers when teammates like Audino are weakened, such as against Drampa, Ludicolo, and Jellicent. It can also use Haze to stop a variety of forms of setup from Pokemon like Lurantis and Calm Mind Clefairy.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Articuno is specialized on stall-oriented teams as a staple option for entry hazard control thanks to its reliable recovery, its great bulk, and the great options it has for supporting its teammates. Despite it acting as a Defogger, separate hazard control remains vital alongside it to maintain its longevity due to its Stealth Rock weakness. Skuntank and Altaria are notable picks, with the former being great for bulky teams that need a Toxic Spikes absorber while also a decent check to stallbreakers like Oricorio-G. Altaria offers good support with its utility and reliability as a Defogger and is able to come in more safely against Eelektross and Combusken and remove hazards. As this set is meant to be used on stall teams, standard stall staples such as Audino and Clefairy are expected to be run alongside it, as they form a core that is vital in providing recovery, Wish passing, spreading Toxic, and blanket checking a majority of threats. These three Pokemon can also all alternate their support options based on the team's needs. Physical tanks such as Regirock, Mudsdale, and Tangela can be quite effective in taking on physical attackers such as Stoutland, Aggron, Lycanroc, and Alolan Raticate. These Pokemon, in general, also appreciate Articuno's ability to check Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type special attackers like Poliwrath, Aurorus, and Bellossom.</p>"

  "Noctowl": {
    "overview": "<p>Noctowl sports Tinted Lens, Work Up, and a powerful STAB move in Hurricane, making it capable of breaking past Pokemon that check other Flying-types such as Regirock and Lanturn. Access to Agility lets Noctowl double as a late-game sweeper by being able to outspeed prominent threats such as Alolan Raichu and Choice Scarf Primeape after a boost. The combination of these traits allows Noctowl to match up well versus offensive and defensive teams alike. Noctowl's respectable special bulk also grants it valuable setup opportunities versus weaker special attackers like Lurantis. However, Noctowl's paltry base 50 Defense can prove troublesome, as common powerful attackers such as Kangaskhan and Alolan Sandslash can outspeed Noctowl and OHKO it. By extension, +2 Modest Noctowl fails to outspeed particularly fast and threatening Choice Scarf users such as Dodrio and Scyther. Even though Roost can somewhat remedy residual damage taken, a weakness to Stealth Rock means that Noctowl will often be forced to use Roost and miss out on chances to set up or fire off an attack. Furthermore, Noctowl is reliant on setting up and having a Z-Move to apply offensive pressure, as its middling Special Attack and mediocre Speed otherwise keep it from being a sizeable threat. Finally, Noctowl faces stiff competition from other Flying- and Normal-type wallbreakers and sweepers such as Oricorio-G and Drampa; the former can similarly break through balance and stall teams with its powerful STAB combination alongside access to a superior boosting move in Calm Mind, while the latter possesses far more raw power.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Specs set gives Noctowl more immediate power without the need to set up, turning it into a dedicated wallbreaker; this set is most notably capable of 2HKOing Regirock. However, this set faces heavy competition from other Choice Specs users such as Drampa, which offers better wallbreaking capabilities overall due to its sheer power. Air Slash is a more accurate STAB move, but the severe drop in power from Hurricane limits its wallbreaking power. For instance, Noctowl would require the use of Work Up three times to even guarantee that a Supersonic Skystrike can OHKO Regirock. Hidden Power Fighting can be used to hit Pokemon like Aggron and Probopass especially hard, even OHKOing the former without any boosts, but otherwise it serves little purpose and is generally hard to fit onto moveslots. Substitute grants Noctowl a shield from harmful status moves such as Thunder Wave and Toxic, but the usefulness of Noctowl's other moves makes it hard to fit. Using Psycho Shift with Psychium Z lets Noctowl perform well as a stallbreaker, granting it +2 in Special Attack and swapping whatever harmful status condition is inflicted onto it with the target. However, having to forfeit Work Up and a powerful nuke in Flyinium Z makes this set a one-trick pony, as Noctowl won't be able to set up a second time. On the other hand, sacrificing Agility worsens Noctowl's matchup considerably against offensive teams. Furthermore, as a dedicated stallbreaker, Noctowl faces competition from Pokemon such as Oricorio-G. Finally, while a defensive Defog set sounds appealing with access to Roost and good special bulk, Noctowl offers little as a Defogger over Pokemon like Swanna, Articuno, and Altaria, and its extremely passive nature makes it easy setup fodder.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Type: Null and Munchlax take pathetic amounts of damage from even a boosted Noctowl and can use setup of their own to break through Noctowl. Clefairy can use Calm Mind to beat Noctowl in a one-on-one situation but does not appreciate taking boosted damage beforehand.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Alolan Raichu and Rotom-F hit Noctowl hard and can force it out to secure an opportunity to pivot with Volt Switch. Certain Electric-types like Eelektross and Lanturn possess high special bulk and can pivot into unboosted attacks, and Lanturn can fish for paralysis with Discharge.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Regirock and Aggron are sturdy enough to take on a Noctowl without a Z-Move or boosts and threaten it with their respective Rock-type moves. Faster Rock-types like Kabutops can outspeed Noctowl without any Agility boosts, and Lycanroc can always hit first with Accelerock, revenge killing Noctowl if it's sufficiently weakened. The likes of Regirock and Golem can take advantage of Noctowl switching out by setting up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Pokemon like Jynx and Rotom-F can outspeed an unboosted Noctowl and hit it hard with their STAB moves, while Abomasnow threatens to hit Noctowl first with Ice Shard. Choice Specs Aurorus can even OHKO Noctowl despite its high Special Defense, though it must be careful about taking a boosted Supersonic Skystrike.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Stoutland, and Choice Band Skuntank have little issue outspeeding an unboosted Noctowl and exploiting its low Defense, with the former two also having a solid chance of surviving an unboosted Supersonic Skystrike if at full health. Kangaskhan also possesses two solid priority moves, threatening to hit Noctowl first.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Noctowl depends on Agility to outspeed powerful threats like Primeape and Alolan Sandslash and can be revenge killed very easily otherwise. Particularly fast Choice Scarf users such as Dodrio and Simisear outpace Noctowl even after an Agility boost.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: While Noctowl can heal damage dealt by Stealth Rock, taking a turn to do so can invite Pokemon like Stoutland and Alolan Sandslash to come in and threaten it out. In situations where Noctowl can't heal, Stealth Rock damage will let faster attackers like Primeape and Jynx KO it.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Users of Toxic like Oricorio-E and Alolan Persian can put Noctowl on a timer, severely reducing its time on the field. Being afflicted with paralysis from Pokemon like Qwilfish nullifies any use Agility could have had.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Double Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hurricane is Noctowl's STAB move of choice despite its low accuracy because of its high Base Power and ability to deal neutral damage to most targets courtesy of Tinted Lens while also OHKOing Victreebel after Stealth Rock. Roost keeps Noctowl healthy and provides additional chances to sweep or wallbreak. Roost also compensates for Noctowl's weakness to Stealth Rock and can be used to sponge Volt Switch from slow users such as Lanturn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Modest nature is preferred so that Noctowl can function primarily as a wallbreaker and OHKO Assault Vest Hitmonchan and Skuntank unboosted; it's still faster than threats such as Choice Scarf Primeape after Agility. A Timid nature lets Noctowl naturally outspeed neutral-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon like Shiftry, but this forfeits a considerable amount of Noctowl's attacking power. Tinted Lens is a crucial ability, as it lets Hurricane hit the likes of Aurorus and Regirock neutrally. Flyinium Z gives Noctowl a one-time nuke that, alongside setup, is capable of demolishing specially bulky Pokemon like Lanturn and Eelektross. Its perfect accuracy is also helpful in dire situations where Noctowl needs to land an attack. Sky Plate is a viable alternative if another teammate is using a Z-Crystal, giving Noctowl more consistent damage output. However, Noctowl sorely misses out on the power brought by using Flyinium Z, which includes OHKOing Pokemon like Eviolite Scyther and Oricorio-E after Stealth Rock without a boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Noctowl functions best utilizing Work Up, Tinted Lens, and Hurricane to break through balance and bulky offense teams that rely on Pokemon like Regirock, Oricorio-E, and Lanturn to take Flying-type attacks. Assess whether Agility or Work Up is more important to set up first. Against offensive teams, Agility gives Noctowl an edge over fast Pokemon that would otherwise threaten it like Alolan Sandslash and Jynx. Work Up functions well versus bulkier teams, allowing Noctowl to punch through walls after a sufficient number of uses. For instance, +1 Supersonic Skystrike can OHKO Aurorus and Regirock after Stealth Rock damage, whereas an unboosted Supersonic Skystrike or a boosted Hurricane can OHKO Alolan Sandslash and Kabutops. Supersonic Skystrike can also be used if Noctowl can't afford to miss Hurricane, such as against a Pokemon like Aggron, which threatens to decimate Noctowl in return. It's also useful for securing an OHKO on Pokemon like Carracosta and Omastar, where Noctowl can't afford to set up at all. In spite of great special bulk, Noctowl should not be used as a sponge to special attacks; instead, bring it in safely through pivoting moves like Volt Switch and Parting Shot. However, Noctowl can switch into weaker users of Knock Off such as Tangela and Sableye to preserve its teammates' items and threaten both examples with Supersonic Skystrike. A weakness to Stealth Rock and susceptibility to residual damage is often a liability for Noctowl, so keeping it healthy increases its chances of being able to successfully set up versus weaker special attackers such as Bellossom. Use Roost to heal when against Pokemon that can't do much harm to Noctowl, such as Audino, but be wary of the occasional Toxic. Status from users like Toxic Poliwrath and Thunder Wave Qwilfish is something Noctowl should try to avoid in general. Use advantageous matchups as setup time, as this is the key to Noctowl's success. Choice item users such as Haunter can be taken advantage of, depending on what they're locked into. Some Pokemon that can't do much to Noctowl include Lurantis and Bellossom. Finally, Noctowl can engage in mind games with other Pokemon like Hitmonchan and Abomasnow, which are naturally threatened out by Supersonic Skystrike.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers such as Drampa and Aggron can weaken defensive Pokemon like Audino and Clefairy, paving the way for Noctowl to sweep using Agility. Similarly, late-game cleaners such as Jynx, Carracosta, and Primeape appreciate Noctowl's ability to weaken bulky Pokemon such as Poliwrath and Gurdurr. Blanket checks to physical attackers such as Regirock, defensive Carracosta, and Gurdurr take powerful physical hits for Noctowl, while it can check Grass-types like Bellossom and Lurantis in return. Noctowl thrives on getting free switches to start setting up, so slow pivots like Probopass and Eelektross can help. Conversely, Silvally-Dragon operates well as a fast pivot thanks to Parting Shot lowering the foe's offensive stats, giving Noctowl an easier shot at setting up. Silvally-Dragon's ability to unleash a powerful Draco Meteor and target Steel-types like Ferroseed with Flamethrower can help secure a potential sweep for Noctowl. Entry hazard removers such as Hitmonchan and Skuntank are essential, as Noctowl is weak to Stealth Rock. Hitmonchan also works as an offensive check to Pokemon like Ferroseed and Aggron while appreciating Noctowl's ability to break threats such as Tangela, whereas specially offensive Skuntank can soften special walls with Acid Spray. Skuntank also enjoys Noctowl being able to switch into Ground-type attacks. Noctowl appreciates entry hazards from Pokemon like Qwilfish weakening switch-ins. A notable feat that Noctowl can pull off with Stealth Rock is OHKOing Regirock with +1 Supersonic Skystrike. Qwilfish can weaken physical attackers with Intimidate and soften targets with Explosion. Clefairy also appreciates Noctowl being able to power through Steel-types like Aggron and Metang with Supersonic Skystrike and absorb Knock Off from weaker users like Audino.</p>"

  "Lanturn": {
    "overview": "<p>Lanturn's unique set of resistances allows it to check specially offensive Electric-, Flying-, Water-, and Fire-types like Rotom-F, Oricorio-G, Swanna, and Simisear. Its large HP stat coupled with serviceable Special Defense, which can be further augmented through the use of an Assault Vest, grants it a niche in PU as a blanket check to a large portion of the tier's special attackers. In addition to defensive sets, with the use of Assault Vest or support moves like Heal Bell, Lanturn can also viably run offensive sets thanks to its wide movepool and usable Special Attack stat, which means Pokemon that are able to set up on or take advantage of defensive Lanturn, like Ferroseed, cannot always switch into Lanturn directly. Lanturn's ability to control momentum in battles is exceptional; not only is it able to block the opponent's attempts at gaining momentum with Volt Switch thanks to its ability Volt Absorb, but its own Volt Switch in conjunction with its low Speed stat is also an effective tool for grabbing momentum as well as bringing in frail teammates like Simisear and Jynx safely. Despite Lanturn's lower Speed stat being useful in this context, it is also harmful in certain matchups, as faster offensive Pokemon with a type advantage like Victreebel and Alolan Dugtrio are able to outspeed and OHKO Lanturn. While Lanturn sports only two weaknesses, Ground- and Grass-type coverage moves are commonplace in PU and are regularly run by Pokemon that Lanturn switches into like Omastar and Simisear. This combined with Lanturn's vulnerability to entry hazards, its lack of reliable recovery, and its lackluster Defense stat can cause Lanturn to be worn down quickly over the course of a battle. Despite these weaknesses, however, Lanturn is still an overall advantageous choice for many different team archetypes, owing to both its ability to run offensive and defensive sets and the unparalleled team support that it provides.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Normalium Z can be used in place of Leftovers on Lanturn's bulky pivot set for a full heal from Z-Heal Bell. However, a one-time heal does not grant Lanturn the longevity required for longer battles. Ion Deluge in conjunction with Volt Absorb allows Lanturn to absorb Normal-type attacks like Rapid Spin and heal itself for 25% of its maximum HP. Additionally, this combination allows Lanturn to scout for Choice-locked Normal-Type attacks from the likes Stoutland. Lanturn can run a set of Rain Dance, Hydro Pump, Thunder, and Volt Switch with a Damp Rock to better support rain teams in need of an immunity to Electric-type moves, to act as a bulky pivot to bring in frail sweepers safely, and as a secondary Rain Dance setter. Additionally, Rain Dance increases the potency of its STAB moves. Rest and Sleep Talk can be used to keep Lanturn healthy and allow it to continuously pivot in and out of battle. However, such a set lacks counterplay for Grass-types and Gastrodon, which causes Lanturn to be forced out more often. Charge Beam can be used on Lanturn's Assault Vest set so that it can attack with the same power as its Choice Specs set while retaining its ability to switch between moves. This is a lackluster option, however, given that Discharge and Hidden Power Grass are more practical for beating common switch-ins to Lanturn.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Abomasnow and Victreebel easily force Lanturn out via their STAB moves, although they must be careful of switching into Lanturn's coverage moves. Lurantis can use Lanturn as a way to boost its Special Attack via Contrary Leaf Storm, while it is able to heal any status that Lanturn might inflict on it or its teammates with Aromatherapy. Abomasnow and Ferroseed wall Lanturn fairly easily if it lacks Hidden Power Fire. Cradily can easily pivot into Lanturn's STAB attacks, and even capitalizes on its Water-type moves via Storm Drain. However, it fears taking Ice Beam and Toxic on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Absol and Stoutland are able to target Lanturn's lower Defense stat and bring it down with a Choice Band-boosted Knock Off or Return, respectively. Similarly, Crabominable's Attack-invested Close Combat allows it to OHKO even bulky Lanturn with Stealth Rock damage factored in.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Jynx can use its decent bulk and immunity to Water to set up on Lanturn's defensive sets and break it with a +2 Psyshock. While it can't switch in on any set, Grassium Z Simisear can take Lanturn out or heavily dent it with Bloom Doom. Lastly, Type: Null avoids the 3HKO from even Choice Specs Lanturn's Hydro Pump, meaning Lanturn can be used for Type: Null to boost its stats with Swords Dance and Iron Defense.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: While they are unable to switch into Lanturn reliably due to the risk of being hit by Scald or Hydro Pump, offensive Ground-types like Golurk and Alolan Dugtrio are able to outspeed and OHKO defensive variants of Lanturn with their STAB moves. Mudsdale is capable of tanking any hit from non-Choice Specs Lanturn and OHKOing back if Scald does not burn.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Given Lanturn's lack of reliable recovery, passive sources of damage can limit the number of times Lanturn can pivot into attacks for its teammates. Entry hazards set by Pokemon like Qwilfish and Ferroseed are crippling to Lanturn. Toxic is similarly threatening to variants of Lanturn lacking Heal Bell.</p>",

      "Bulky Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch hits Water- and Flying-types like Swanna and Oricorio-G super effectively and allows Lanturn to grab momentum for its teammates and pivot out of checks or counters that might switch in, assuming they are not immune to Electric coverage. Scald hits Ground-, Rock-, and Fire-types such as Claydol, Aggron, and Simisear for super effective damage. Its chance to burn is useful in wearing down the opposition and crippling physical attackers that might try to take advantage of Lanturn's lower Defense stat. Toxic wears down Grass-type switch-ins like Lurantis and Torterra as well as other Pokemon that wall Lanturn's Electric- and Water-type moves like Gastrodon. Heal Bell rids Lanturn and its teammates of status afflictions. Protect eases prediction, grants Lanturn a free turn of Leftovers recovery, and can stall out foes when used in tandem with Toxic.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Volt Absorb lets Lanturn heal 25% of its maximum HP when struck by Electric-type moves like Rotom-F's Volt Switch and Alolan Raichu's Thunderbolt while granting it an immunity to them. Leftovers grants Lanturn greater longevity and mitigates its lack of reliable recovery. 40 HP EVs maximize Leftovers recovery, with the rest dumped into Defense. Additionally, this investment lets Lanturn take an unboosted Earthquake from Alolan Dugtrio as well as Alolan Raichu's Nasty Plot- and Life Orb-boosted Psyshock. Its remaining EVs are poured into Special Defense to take on strong special wallbreakers such as Jellicent as effectively as possible. In general, Lanturn's defensive EV spreads can be tailored to a team's specific needs. For example, 120 Speed EVs can be used to let Lanturn outspeed Aggron and hit it with Scald.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Lanturn's Volt Absorb to pivot into attacks for its teammates such as Rotom-F's Volt Switch and Alolan Raichu's Thunderbolt and to keep Lanturn healthy throughout the match so that it can take on powerful special attackers like Jellicent and Swanna. Even with Defense investment, Lanturn's bulk should not be overestimated in light of its lack of reliable recovery; switch it out of strong physical attackers like Victreebel and Stoutland. Use Lanturn's slow Volt Switch to safely bring in frail Pokemon that cannot afford to take a hit such as Simisear, Jynx, and Abomasnow. If the opponent's team includes a Pokemon with an Electric immunity like Gastrodon or Mudsdale, it is often better to use Toxic or Scald on a predicted switch so that the opponent is unable to capitalize on Lanturn's Volt Switch. Use Heal Bell to cure Lanturn and its teammates of crippling status effects. Heal Bell's PP can be depleted easily, so be sure to conserve it during longer battles. Use Protect for an extra turn of Leftovers recovery, especially in situations where Lanturn is in danger of being 2HKOed. Additionally, Protect and Toxic can be used together to stall out Lanturn's foes. Finally, Protect is an effective tool for easing prediction against Choice-locked Pokemon and reducing the damage of incoming Z-Moves, but avoid its overuse, as this can provide the opponent with a free turn of setup.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defensive checks to Grass-types like Bronzor and Oricorio-G mesh well with Lanturn. Bronzor appreciates Lanturn's ability to soak Fire- and Ghost-type attacks from the likes of Simisear and Jellicent, and in return is able to address the physical attackers like Stoutland that pressure Lanturn. Oricorio-G meanwhile appreciates Lanturn's ability to soak up the Electric- and Ice-type attacks that plague it, and in exchange offers a Ground-type immunity and access to Taunt, breaking down the bulkier teams that Lanturn struggles to take on alone. Lanturn also appreciates offensive checks to Grass-types, such as Jynx, Swanna, Simisear, and Haunter. These Pokemon function optimally with Lanturn's slow Volt Switch given their lower defenses. Using Volt Switch too much when entry hazards are present can wear Lanturn down prematurely, so Defog and Rapid Spin support is useful in keeping it healthy. Skuntank and Alolan Sandslash can remove entry hazards with Defog and Rapid Spin respectively and also check Grass-types. Hitmonchan removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin and checks troublesome physical attackers like Absol and Zangoose, while Lanturn can switch into Flying-types like Swanna and Oricorio-G in return. Grass-types can switch into Ground-type moves for Lanturn, making Torterra, Tangela, and Leafeon effective partners. Fighting-types like Primeape appreciate Lanturn's Heal Bell support as well as its ability to switch into Flying-type moves. Additionally, Lanturn can wear down checks to Fighting-types, like Jellicent and Oricorio-E, with Toxic or one of its STAB moves. Finally, Lanturn and Primeape form a VoltTurn core together, which serves to weaken checks and counters to both.</p>"
      },
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald deals super effective damage to Ground-, Rock-, and Fire-types, and despite its low Base Power, it is still able to OHKO offensive threats like Simisear and Aggron. Scald-induced burns wear Lanturn's foes down and cripple physical attackers. Alternatively, Hydro Pump gives Lanturn a more powerful STAB option that allows it to deal more significant damage to Ground- and Rock-types like Golurk and Regirock. Volt Switch is a great tool for applying offensive pressure and letting Lanturn pivot out of unfavorable matchups. Ice Beam grants Lanturn super effective coverage against Dragon- and Grass-types. For example, it 2HKOes Drampa and Tangela, and does more damage to Oricorio-E than Lanturn's other moves would. Hidden Power Fire is Lanturn's best move to threaten Ferroseed, Abomasnow, and Alolan Sandslash. Alternatively, Hidden Power Grass 2HKOes Gastrodon and guarantees the OHKO on Kabutops. Discharge is an alternate Electric-type STAB that doesn't force Lanturn out, and its high paralysis chance helps Lanturn reliably beat bulky Oricorio-G.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Volt Absorb heals Lanturn when it is hit by an Electric-type attack and lets it block Volt Switch for its teammates. 172 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature allows Lanturn to OHKO Aggron with Scald. 200 Speed EVs are used to outspeed everything up to Modest Jellicent. Alternatively, 252 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed Jolly Torterra. Its remaining EVs are used to augment its special bulk, which in conjunction with its Assault Vest lets it survive Modest Omastar's boosted Earth Power even after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Given its ability to switch between its coverage moves, Assault Vest Lanturn's Volt Switch is difficult to punish by Pokemon with an immunity to Electric-type moves. If entry hazards have been set on Lanturn's side of the field, avoid using Volt Switch too often without removing them, as they can whittle away Lanturn's HP prematurely. Use Lanturn's increased bulk from Assault Vest to switch into special attackers like Alolan Raichu, Simisear, and Oricorio-E. While Scald can be used liberally, be careful when using it against Pokemon that can capitalize on burns inflicted by Lanturn. For example, Facade users like Stoutland and Pokemon with Guts like Gurdurr become more threatening when burned.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can switch into Ground-type moves on Lanturn's behalf are useful partners. For example, Lurantis and Servine can easily pivot into Mudsdale's Earthquake and force it out while using this opportunity to remove entry hazards via Defog. Drampa is able to use predicted Grass-type moves as a means of entering the field safely and firing off a powerful STAB- and Choice Specs-boosted move on the following turn. Pinsir can also do this to some extent, while Lanturn's slow Volt Switch allows Pinsir enough breathing room to set up either Swords Dance or obtain a Speed boost via Z-Me First. Frail attackers, especially those that require a turn of setup to function optimally, appreciate being brought onto the field safely by Lanturn's slow Volt Switch. Not only do they share beneficial type synergy with Lanturn, but sweepers like Jynx, Oricorio-G, Simisear, and Omastar are also effective in removing Grass- and Ground-types for Lanturn. Ursaring and Zangoose are able to activate their Flame Orb and Toxic Orb respectively on the turn they are brought in via Volt Switch and can break down specially defensive walls like Clefairy and Audino for Lanturn. Without Leftovers, Assault Vest Lanturn can be worn down quickly by entry hazards, so it works well with Rapid Spin or Defog support provided by the likes of Hitmonchan, Cryogonal, Lurantis, and Skuntank. Skuntank in particular is a noteworthy partner, as it has the bonus of absorbing Toxic Spikes for Lanturn. Finally, other grounded Poison-types like Roselia and Victreebel keep Lanturn safe from Toxic Spikes, too, while also checking Ground- and Grass-types.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam is capable of 2HKOing Grass-types like Victreebel and Torterra, preventing them from switching in freely. Thunderbolt complements Hydro Pump as a more reliable STAB move that notably lets Lanturn pressure defensive Jellicent without switching out. Heal Bell can be used over Thunderbolt to provide status healing in a pinch, although locking into it can provide the foe with free setup opportunities. Hidden Power Fire is another option that can be used to patch up a particular weakness to Ferroseed, but it is extremely prediction reliant and likewise may facilitate easy setup for opposing Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Choice Scarf and maximum Speed investment allow Lanturn to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, slower Choice Scarf users like Aurorus and Alolan Sandslash, and key threats like Carracosta after a Shell Smash boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early-game, Lanturn should prioritize generating momentum by pivoting out on Pokemon that it forces out, like Jellicent and Regirock, and facilitating opportunities for wallbreakers to enter the field safely. Choice Scarf Lanturn's surprise factor may come in handy when checking threats like Carracosta and Grassium Z Simisear, which might be tempted to stay in on other Lanturn sets and attempt to take it out; it is therefore advisable to avoid using Hydro Pump early-game unless strictly necessary and perform double switches if a Volt Switch-immune Pokemon is expected to switch in. Despite its lack of defensive investment, Lanturn is still highly capable of switching into threats like Rotom-F, Swanna, and unboosted Simisear. However, such switches should be done sparingly if Lanturn is expected to be useful later in the game, as it tends to get worn down by entry hazards. Due to its middling power output, Lanturn should only attempt to wallbreak or perform cleaning duties late-game when defensive Pokemon like Mudsdale and Regirock are thoroughly weakened and in Hydro Pump's KO range.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Despite not being as optimal at providing speed control compared to faster Choice Scarf users like Rotom-F, Lanturn's unique defensive properties, as well as the difficulty of switching into it, make it an excellent glue Pokemon that can be used to patch up weaknesses to threats like Simisear and Carracosta. Defensive Pokemon like Jellicent, Mudsdale, and Regirock highly benefit from Lanturn's ability to deal with the aforementioned threats, as well as others like Oricorio-E and Swanna; In return, they help to mitigate Lanturn's poor matchup against faster Choice Scarf users like Primeape and Dodrio and setup sweepers like Swords Dance Silvally-Fairy. Grass-types like Victreebel, Leafeon, and Lurantis appreciate Lanturn dealing with threats like Oricorio-G and Rotom-F, and in return they ease the matchup against Mudsdale and opposing Lanturn. Strong wallbreakers like Absol, Stoutland, Drampa, and Simisear highly benefit from Lanturn's ease of generating switch-in opportunities; the former two are adept at pressuring specially defensive switch-ins like Eelektross and Cryogonal, and the latter two can threaten Grass-types like Victreebel and Ferroseed. Grass-type checks like Oricorio-G and Silvally-Poison ease Lanturn's need to predict correctly against threats like Victreebel, and they can both form a VoltTurn core alongside it. Lanturn also fits reasonably well on entry hazard stacking teams alongside hazard setters like Ferroseed and Qwilfish, spinblockers like Silvally-Ghost, and wallbreakers like Kangaskhan, where it can utilize its ability to force switches to wear down opposing Pokemon and make its task of late-game cleaning easier. Priority attackers like Skuntank, as well as the aforementioned Kangaskhan and Absol, can provide additional speed control to make up for Lanturn's middling Speed. Finally, Choice Scarf Lanturn's relative unpredictability from a team composition perspective can create opportunities for teammates that commonly run Choice Scarf sets, like Primeape and Dodrio, to enhance their own surprise factor with sets like Choice Band or Swords Dance. The former also forms an effective VoltTurn core with Lanturn, and both of them appreciate Lanturn pressuring threats like Jellicent and Carracosta.</p>"

  "Natu": {
    "overview": "<p>With a great ability in Magic Bounce, Natu carves itself an effective niche in the PU metagame. As the only Pokemon in the tier that has access to the ability, Natu is able to deflect entry hazards and other status moves such as Stealth Rock and Will-O-Wisp. Natu has a great utility movepool that complements its role as a defensive Magic Bounce user, including options such as U-turn, Reflect, and reliable recovery in Roost. Natu, however, has a rather poor defensive typing, and it is easily targeted by common Dark-, Ice-, Rock-, and Electric-types such as Spiritomb, Aurorus, and Eelektross. Natu cannot switch into all entry hazard setters, as some setters like Aggron can be a problem if they predict Natu switching into them; therefore, mind games are usually played to keep entry hazards away from the field consistently by keeping the opponent guessing if Natu is switching in or not. Aside from Reflect, Natu has very poor bulk even with its Eviolite intact and can be easily threatened by powerful Pokemon or Pokemon that deal super effective damage to it such as Lycanroc. Furthermore, due to its reliance on Eviolite, Knock Off is an extremely dangerous tool against Natu, as it sports a weakness to the move and losing Eviolite severely hinders its longevity. Despite Natu's typing, it makes for a terrible check to Fighting-types because Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Throh are able to take any of Natu's moves once and retaliate with Knock Off, while other Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan carry other threatening coverage moves such as Ice Punch. Natu's relative passivity means that setup sweepers can generally switch into it with ease, not fearing much aside from Thunder Wave, though Substitute users like Oricorio-G can avoid the move. Being reliant on Night Shade for damage also allows Normal-type wallbreakers like Kangaskhan and Zangoose to easily switch in.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Since Natu is a niche Pokemon in PU, it doesn't really have a lot of opportunities to use uncommon alternative options, and its main moves are usually too important to discard; however, Natu can run Toxic in the third moveslot as an alternative option to combat special walls that can switch into Psychic, but it can be generally used against any bulky Pokemon as well. However, crippling faster threats with Thunder Wave and being able to set up Reflect are much more important than dealing with special walls, as Natu's teammates can do that much more efficiently. Hidden Power Fighting can be used as a specific coverage move to check Pawniard on the switch as well as other Rock-, Dark-, and Steel-types, which leaves them more vulnerable to Natu's teammates; however, Natu's current moveset is much more consistent in complementing its role as a Magic Bounce user. Feather Dance is an alternative option to Reflect, sacrificing the ability to better deal with Regirock for doing better against Spiritomb by lowering its Attack to avoid taking much damage from Pursuit; however, Reflect is a better option because it can be used more for supporting teammates while also providing a way of dealing with Regirock, a very common entry hazard setter.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Absol and Alolan Persian are immune to Psychic and can take out or cripple Natu with Knock Off without any difficulty, although they dislike Thunder Wave. Dark-type Pursuit trappers such as Skuntank and Spiritomb are also threatening, as they can outspeed, trap, and KO Natu very easily. Spiritomb is especially threatening, since its ability Infiltrator allows it to deal maximum damage with Pursuit regardless of Reflect.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Alolan Raichu and Rotom-F outspeed Natu with ease and can take it out with their STAB attacks. Alolan Raichu can also resist Psychic, although it takes significant damage from U-turn if it is hit on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Although Natu can tank Regirock with the help of Reflect, more offensively oriented Rock-types such as Lycanroc and Kabutops can pick apart Natu very easily, although they might be crippled by Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Probopass and Aggron resist Psychic and usually don't mind Thunder Wave, which means they can force Natu out or use Rock-type coverage to take it out. Some Steel-types can also set up entry hazards once they've forced Natu out, which gives it difficulty switching back in unless it has a Defog or Rapid Spin user as a teammate.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Oricorio-G and Haunter can deal with Natu very easily, as they can set up on it or KO it with a Ghost-type STAB move. Oricorio-G can also use Natu as setup fodder with Substitute to block Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Attackers</strong>: Powerful attackers such as Drampa, Stoutland, and Swanna can take Natu out easily due to its mediocre bulk, although Swanna does not appreciate being paralyzed by Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off is a serious problem for Natu due to it removing Eviolite, which hinders Natu's bulk and functionality as a Magic Bounce user. Knock Off is notably a common coverage or utility move, which makes it all the more troublesome. Pokemon such as Gurdurr, Eelektross, and Zangoose can all remove Natu's Eviolite with Knock Off and KO it.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types such as Aurorus and Jynx can easily outspeed and OHKO Natu thanks to their powerful, super effective special attacks. Even if Natu hits them on the switch, it would not be able to deter them aside from using Thunder Wave, which they need to be careful with, but otherwise, they can switch in and OHKO Natu instantly if it doesn't switch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Magic Bounce": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Night Shade allows Natu to hit almost all Pokemon in the tier for adequate and consistent damage, which can wear foes down when Natu switches in to deflect entry hazards or status moves. Night Shade also acts as a reliable option against setup sweepers that utilize Substitute such as Gorebyss. Psychic can be used as an alternative option to hit Fighting- and Poison-types such as Gurdurr and Qwilfish super effectively, especially the latter, as Natu can block Qwilfish's Toxic Spikes. U-turn allows Natu to pivot, which creates momentum and enables Natu to escape threatening situations where it can send in a teammate to deal with the opposing check or counter. Reflect acts as a stalling option that Natu can use against more passive entry hazard setters such as Regirock and can be used in conjunction with Roost to reduce Rock-type damage effectively in order to stall and force out said Pokemon. Reflect also helps Natu take less damage from all Pursuit users bar Spiritomb, which bypasses it. Natu can use Thunder Wave as an alternative option to cripple opposing Pokemon, especially if they are faster and switch into Natu, as then Natu's teammates can take care of these Pokemon with less difficulty and allow Natu to perform its job more safely. In general, Roost acts as a useful recovery option that Natu can use to increase its longevity in situations such as switching into entry hazards to force a switch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Natu's Speed EVs allow it to outspeed most Rock-types such as Carracosta and Regirock, which lets it cripple them with Thunder Wave before they can attack or set up. The remaining EVs in Natuâ€™s HP and Defense in conjunction with an Eviolite and a Bold nature allow Natu to become significantly bulkier, which helps it avoid a 2HKO from Jolly Skuntank's Crunch if Natu has been hit by it once before setting up Reflect. 0 Attack IVs allow Natu to take minimal damage from Foul Play from the likes of Spiritomb and Sableye. Magic Bounce enables Natu to bounce back opposing entry hazards and other status moves like Toxic and Taunt and helps Natu's teammates do their jobs more efficiently.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Natu should generally switch into predicted entry hazards and other status moves to prevent them from being used and bounce them back to the opponent's team. Natu can also do this to a certain extent without even being present; the opponent will think twice about setting entry hazards or using status-inducing moves, as they will be unsure if Natu will switch in or not. However, one important thing to look for is when Natu is switching in to deflect entry hazards or status-inducing moves, as it needs to be extremely careful of being predicted to switch in. Natu does not want to get hit by a super effective coverage move such as Knock Off from Pokemon like Clefairy, which can deter it from switching in due to its poor bulk. Natu should use Thunder Wave to cripple faster switch-ins such as Articuno and Lycanroc early-game, making them more vulnerable to Natu's teammates. U-turn should generally be used to avoid threatening situations, such as using it on a Pursuit trapper, and also to create momentum by allowing a teammate to switch in. Natu can use Reflect in conjunction with Roost to stall out and take less damage from more passive entry hazard setters such as Regirock to force switches. Reflect can also be used to take less damage from Pursuit, unless it's from Spiritomb. If Natu is used on stall teams, it is able to be played more passively just to bounce entry hazards and pivot; however, if it is used on more offensive teams, it can be played aggressively by switching in more often to ensure entry hazards are off the field.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that don't appreciate entry hazards and other status moves such as Oricorio-G value Natu's ability to deflect them, set up Reflect, and cripple opposing Pokemon with Thunder Wave. This allows these Pokemon to set up or perform their roles more efficiently; for example, Oricorio-G can attack Skuntank with a Z-Move straight away under the protection of Reflect. A VoltTurn core can be formed with the likes of Eelektross to create more momentum and allow Natu and its other teammates to switch in more reliably. Dark-types such as Absol and Skuntank are very dangerous towards Natu, as they carry STAB Knock Off and Pursuit, respectively, and the latter can hinder Natu's bulk by trapping it. Checks to these Dark-types such as Silvally-Fairy and Gastrodon are a huge help; Silvally-Fairy not only does not mind Knock Off at all but can either remove hazards with Defog in case Natu was unable to keep them off the field or cripple switch-ins like Regirock with Toxic, making it easier for Natu to stall them out. Gastrodon can also spread Toxic. In return, both of these Pokemon appreciate Natu's ability to block status moves. Dark-type Pokemon such as Skuntank and Alolan Persian also make great teammates, since they are able to take care of threatening Ghost-types such as Oricorio-G and Haunter. Skuntank can also act as a backup Defogger in case Natu was unable to bounce entry hazards. Ground-types such as Golurk can take care of threatening Electric-types such as Alolan Raichu while also being able to set up entry hazards and spinblock, respectively. Although Natu can stall out more passive Rock-type entry hazard setters with Reflect, it cannot do the same with more offensive Rock-types like Lycanroc, which means Rock-type checks such as Primeape and Aggron are a great help, with the former also being able to check Dark-types and the latter being able to set up entry hazards to further help Natu, although using them stacks a weakness to one of Natu's best checks, Spiritomb. Special walls such as Audino and Type: Null can take care of powerful special attackers such as Aurorus and Drampa, which target Natu's weaker Special Defense. Natu pairs well with Pyukumuku on defensively inclined teams, as its ability Unaware allows it to deal with setup sweepers. It can also deal with Calm Mind Spiritomb by using Spite. In return, Pyukumuku appreciates Natu's ability to deflect Toxic and Taunt. Furthermore, Natu can assist stall teams by setting up Reflect to reduce physical damage and further annoy the opposing team. Lastly, Pokemon such as Clefairy and Mawile are appreciated, as they can check Spiritomb. It should be noted, though, that Mawile and other physical Fairy-types that check Spiritomb need to be wary of Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

  "Bellossom": {
    "overview": "<p>Bellossom's exclusive access to both Strength Sap and Quiver Dance provides it with a unique niche. The first of Bellossom's great niches as a sweeper lies in Strength Sap, which increases its longevity while making up for its lack of defensive investment, allowing Bellossom to force physical attackers such as Gurdurr and Stoutland to switch out after lowering their Attack. Quiver Dance allows Bellossom to avoid becoming overwhelmed by special attackers, outspeed and deal significant damage to neutral or super effective targets, and even sometimes sweep if Bellossom's checks and counters are removed or weakened. However, Bellossom has incredibly average stats before boosting, which can cause it to be overwhelmed by physical and special wallbreakers such as Alolan Raticate and Nasty Plot Jynx or outsped by the likes of Choice Scarf Dodrio and Slush Rush Alolan Sandslash, which all can OHKO or 2HKO Bellossom.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bellossom can run a multitude of sets such as specially offensive Quiver Dance with maximum Special Attack investment, which allows it to hit a decent bit harder and do more damage to Pokemon that resist its attacks such as Skuntank and Dodrio; however, it is generally not worth compromising Bellossom's bulk and ability to set up. Bellossom could use an offensive Chlorophyll set on sun teams, but this set is mostly outclassed by other Grass-types such as Victreebel. Sleep Powder is an interesting option for Bellossom to set up against Pokemon such as Choice Band Skuntank and non-Lum Berry Pinsir more easily by putting them to sleep and clicking Strength Sap multiple times where usually one drop isn't enough. However, Bellossom has trouble finding space for it on its moveset and it also runs the risk of the opponent getting a first-turn wake. Leech Seed can be run to force even more switches while further increasing Bellossom's longevity; however, Bellossom also has trouble finding a spot for it on its moveset without forgoing other vital coverage. Hidden Power Ground and Fighting are options that allow Bellossom to fit Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-types such as Combusken, Alolan Sandslash, and Skuntank super effectively, but it misses out on the ability to hit Dragon-types like Drampa and Altaria or forfeits good utility in Safeguard.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon</strong>: Oricorio-G and Oricorio-E can threaten Bellossom with their STAB Hurricane, usually OHKOing or doing massive damage to Bellossom, and they can take advantage of Bellossom's Quiver Dance, copying it with Dancer and being able to boost alongside it with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon such as Combusken prove to be huge issues for Bellossom due to their ability to easily switch in on any of Bellossom's moves, taking very little from even boosted Giga Drain and Moonblast, and easily OHKO or 2HKO Bellossom with STAB Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon</strong>: Opposing Grass-type Pokemon such as Jumpluff and Roselia can prove to be difficult for Bellossom to face due their resistance to Bellossom's Giga Drain and their ability to hit back with super effective secondary STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes</strong>: Toxic Spikes from the likes of Qwilfish and Roselia proves to be hazardous for Bellossom to encounter due to Toxic Spikes poisoning Bellossom before it has a chance to set up Safeguard, which can put Bellossom on a timer and eventually force it to switch and lose all of its boosts.</p> <p><strong>Hail</strong>: Hail Pokemon such Abomasnow and Alolan Sandslash can force Bellossom out due to the former resisting Giga Drain and threatening with Blizzard and the latter being able to outspeed Bellossom at +2 under Hail and threaten it with a super effective Icicle Crash or Subzero Slammer.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Throh, Type: Null, Clefairy, and Audino prove to be hard for Bellossom to break past, with Throh being able to easily phaze Bellossom with Circle Throw, Type: Null being able to Rest off any damage done to it and set up with Swords Dance, and Clefairy being able to badly poison Bellossom with Toxic if Safeguard is not up or set up Calm Mind alongside it to possibly beat it one-on-one depending on critical hits. Clefairy and Audino can even prove to be more difficult with Encore, due to them being able to lock Bellossom into a single move, allowing checks such as Skuntank to come in and force Bellossom out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Strength Sap allows Bellossom to not fall prey to strong physical attackers such as Hitmonchan by lowering their Attack by one stage while also recovering Bellossom's HP. Giga Drain recovers Bellossom's HP, which in tandem with Strength Sap increases Bellossom's longevity significantly. Moonblast gives Bellossom coverage for Dragon-types such as Altaria and Drampa. Alternatively, Safeguard grants Bellossom the ability to mainly avoid being put on a timer and forced out by Toxic damage or being slowed down by paralysis.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment allows Bellossom to take a multitude of attacks once it starts getting Special Defense boosts and Attack drops, such as Stoutland's Return. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Bellossom to outspeed Pokemon around the base 100 Speed mark such as non-Choice Scarf Swanna after a Quiver Dance, although it is worth noting that Bellossom needs two Quiver Dances set up to outspeed non-Choice Scarf Dodrio. Chlorophyll allows Bellossom to exploit opposing sun teams by being able to set up on the likes of Shiftry and outspeeding the rest of their team at +1 Speed in sun. Grassium Z enables Strength Sap to boost Bellossom's Defense by one stage, allowing it to tank hits from physical attackers without them just being able to switch and eliminate the Attack drop from Strength Sap. Grassium Z can also be used to turn Giga Drain into a 140-Base Power Bloom Doom, allowing Bellossom to even break through weakened specially defensive Pokemon such as Throh and Hitmonchan. Leftovers is an alternative to Grassium Z, being able to increase Bellossom's longevity on top of Strength Sap and Giga Drain, and is mostly used when your team already has a Z-Move user.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bellossom should be used as a bulky sweeper, utilizing Quiver Dance's Special Defense boosts, Strength Sap's Attack drops, and Z-Strength Sap's one-time Defense boost to tank hits from hard-hitting sweepers and some wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Aggron. Bellossom shouldn't attempt to switch in to start boosting on threats such as Lycanroc and Kangaskhan that it can effectively remove after being boosted, due to them being able to break through Bellossom before it boosts. Instead, it should switch in to start boosting on passive defensive walls that can't deal any significant damage to Bellossom such Audino. Bellossom should only begin boosting up with Quiver Dance and Z-Strength Sap after its checks and counters have all been eliminated or heavily weakened due to their ability to force Bellossom out in fear of a KO, which causes Bellossom to lose all of its boosts. Once this has been accomplished, Bellossom should immediately start setting up with Quiver Dance once it comes into play in preparation to sweep the opponent's remaining Pokemon. If needed, Bellossom can take on some of its checks such as specially defensive Pokemon like Munchlax and non-Calm Mind Clefairy without team help, utilizing Safeguard to prevent them from inducing status with Toxic and setting up Quiver Dances on them to break through them. Safeguard can also be used to prevent the team from being induced with status. Be careful of reducing the opposing Pokemon's Attack stat too much, since this can cause Strength Sap to recover minimal amounts of HP and force Bellossom to rely on Giga Drain for recovery.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bellossom's underwhelming offensive stats and bulk leave it extremely mediocre on more offensive playstyles, allowing it to fit only on balanced and bulky offensive teams. If forgoing Moonblast, Pokemon that can check Drampa such as Hitmonchan are well appreciated due to Bellossom's inability to deal significant damage to it because of its Sap Sipper ability. Hitmonchan can also spin away problematic hazards such as Toxic Spikes. Bellossom appreciates Pokemon such as Eelektross and Regirock that can handle opposing Flying- and Fire-type Pokemon due to their resistance to Giga Drain. Ice-types such as Abomasnow and Alolan Sandslash can be huge nuisances for Bellossom due to their hard-hitting STAB attacks in Blizzard and Icicle Crash, respectively, meaning Fire-, Steel-, and Fighting-type Pokemon that can check these Pokemon, such as Combusken, Alolan Sandslash, and Gurdurr, make for respectable teammates. However, Fire-type and other Steel-Type Pokemon like Combusken and Metang will have to watch out for Abomasnow and Alolan Sandslash's Earthquake. Even with Safeguard, Toxic Spikes proves to be a major issue for Bellossom, due to them putting it on a timer and hindering its longevity. Because of this, Bellossom appreciates Defog support from the likes of Swanna and Skuntank. Skuntank can even absorb Toxic Spikes with its Poison typing and appreciates Bellossom's ability to remove checks such as Regirock. Due to Strength Sap's ability to force physical sweepers and wallbreakers to switch, entry hazard support from the likes of defensive Qwilfish and Regirock is appreciated to punish those switches, weakening foes and allowing Bellossom to knock them out.</p>"

  "Jumpluff": {
    "overview": "<p>Jumpluff is a niche Pokemon in the PU tier due to its ability to provide utility support for its teammates. Swords Dance and Strength Sap can turn Jumpluff into an unexpected offensive threat, bolstered by its nice Speed tier. Jumpluff has several other great utility moves, and options such as Sleep Powder, Memento, and U-turn allow it to support its teammates fairly effectively. Jumpluff also sports a decent typing that gives it an immunity to Toxic Spikes and Spikes and resistances to Water, Fighting, and Grass, though a weakness to Stealth Rock can hamper Jumpluff's longevity. However, Jumpluff's typing also gives it other exploitable weaknesses, including a nasty 4x weakness to Ice and 2x weaknesses to Fire and Flying. On top of this, Jumpluff is quite frail and can't do much outside of its support role. Jumpluff also can't afford to hold an item such as Leftovers because it needs a boosted Acrobatics due to its abysmal Attack, which remains underwhelming even with a Swords Dance boost. Lastly, despite Jumpluff's good Speed stat, it's in a crowded Speed tier and contends with other base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Alolan Raichu and Dodrio.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set with Substitute, Strength Sap, and Leech Seed sounds appealing because it annoys common switch-ins like Aggron and grants unique setup opportunities, but it's incredibly passive and isn't worth using. Encore would allow Jumpluff to lock the foe into a non-damaging move and force a switch but fitting it over one of Jumpluff's moves is difficult.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Choice Scarf users such as Dodrio and Swanna can revenge kill Jumpluff due to its mediocre bulk. Pokemon such as Floatzel and Lycanroc naturally outspeed Jumpluff and can also score easy KOs with Ice Beam and Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Sleep-immune Pokemon</strong>:  Pokemon such as Tangela and Drampa can easily switch into a Sleep Powder because their typing or abilities grant them an immunity to sleep-inducing moves. However, they do have to be at a high amount of HP to threaten Jumpluff, as Acrobatics does a good chunk.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon</strong>: Steel-types such as Metang and Alolan Dugtrio check Jumpluff with ease due to their Flying resistance. In particular, Aggron can take any attack from Jumpluff, set up Stealth Rock, or force it out with Head Smash. While these Pokemon check Jumpluff, it is important to note that Jumpluff can pivot out with U-turn or use Memento and setup with a teammate against the latter.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon</strong>: STAB Ice-type moves coming from Alolan Sandslash and Choice Scarf Aurorus are efficient ways to deal with Jumpluff. Ice Shard from Abomasnow can also be very dangerous.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock strips 25% of Jumpluff's HP upon switching in and effectively neutralizes the switching Jumpluff can do, especially after using U-turn.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Strength Sap provides Jumpluff with a form of recovery that also lowers the opposing Pokemon's Attack by one stage, giving it the ability to more consistently check Gurdurr, remain healthy while attempting to sweep, and play around Sucker Punch users like Absol. Sleep Powder lets Jumpluff cripple switch-ins like Aggron, Oricorio-E, and Alolan Sandslash, which can give it an easier time setting up or recovering as well as potentially generate a free turn for a teammate. Acrobatics is the preferred STAB move due to its high power and better coverage compared to a Grass-type move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>By not holding an item, the Base Power of Acrobatics instantly doubles. Infiltrator allows Jumpluff to bypass the Substitutes of Pokemon like Haunter, Jynx, and Crabominable, which can be useful for preventing them from getting out of hand.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early- and mid-game is when Jumpluff should focus on crippling foes with Sleep Powder, sustaining itself with Strength Sap, and gradually wearing the opposing team down with Acrobatics. Jumpluff lacks the bulk necessary to switch into neutral attacks as well as reliably double switch, so it should primarily come in on Pokemon like Gurdurr or after a teammate has been KOed. Although Jumpluff can switch in on resisted attacks from Pokemon like Hitmonchan and Primeape, it should only do so if absolutely necessary, as they can easily take it out with their super effective or powerful neutral coverage moves. Waiting until physically bulky foes and Flying-resistant Pokemon like Alolan Sandslash and Oricorio-E have been either removed or heavily damaged is ideal, as this gives Jumpluff a greater chance of sweeping the opposing team. Jumpluff should also wait until faster foes like Lycanroc and Choice Scarf Rotom-F have been taken out, as they can quickly end its sweep. Certain Grass-types such as Lurantis as well as other Pokemon such as Primeape locked into Close Combat often make for perfect setup fodder. If necessary, predicting switches and using Sleep Powder as an opposing Pokemon like Skuntank comes in can ease setup. If possible, try to preserve Jumpluff against offensive teams, as it can potentially annoy them with Sleep Powder and its solid Speed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swords Dance Jumpluff fits best on bulky offensive teams looking for a setup sweeper that can use its great Speed, utility, and support options to annoy playstyles ranging from offense to balance while also keeping Gurdurr in check. Secondary Fighting-type checks like Silvally-Fairy, Qwilfish, and Jellicent can more reliably take on Pokemon like Primeape, Crabominable, and Combusken. Silvally-Fairy can support Jumpluff with Parting Shot and Defog support, while the latter two can pressure bulkier teams with their utility moves. Jumpluff appreciates having bulky Pokemon such as Regirock, Mudsdale, and Gurdurr to sponge priority moves and fall back on against revenge killers like Dodrio, Lycanroc, and Choice Scarf Primeape. Entry hazard removers such as Skuntank, Cryogonal, and Alolan Sandslash are important, as they make Jumpluff less reliant on Strength Sap and allow it to remain as healthy as possible whenever it switches in. Alolan Sandslash can also check Ice-types like Aurorus, dent Rock- and Steel-types with its coverage, and put bulky Pokemon like Sableye on a timer with Toxic. Powerful wallbreakers that also fit on bulky offense like Aurorus, Jellicent, and Stoutland not only allow Jumpluff to sweep more easily but also pick up the slack for it offensively when it can't find a chance to set up. These examples appreciate Jumpluff sponging Knock Off, serving as a soft Fighting-type check, and potentially giving them an easier time switching in with Sleep Powder.</p>"
      },
      "Fast Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn lets Jumpluff pivot out to other team members after it uses Sleep Powder and punish switches from the opponent. Acrobatics is Jumpluff's strongest STAB attack, hitting Fighting- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Crabominable, Hitmonchan, and Victreebel quite hard. Sleep Powder eases setup for Jumpluff's teammates and shuts down slower foes such as Mudsdale. Memento cripples the foe and provides a teammate such as Carracosta or Simisear with a setup opportunity. Seed Bomb can be used over Memento to hit bulky Water- and Ground-types such as Lanturn, Jellicent, Mudsdale, and Gastrodon for super effective damage, but Memento is almost always better because Jumpluff is very weak.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>No item is used to double Acrobatics's power, and Infiltrator allows Jumpluff to hit Pokemon that commonly run Substitute such as Haunter.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Jumpluff will generally come onto the field a few times and use Sleep Powder or pivot around the opposing team before it uses Memento. Jumpluff should use Sleep Powder to incapacitate slower foes like Eelektross or pivot out on its checks like Alolan Sandslash, with U-turn being opted before Memento. Be wary of using Sleep Powder if the opponent has Pokemon immune to it such as Drampa and Ferroseed, as it will ruin your momentum. Try switching Jumpluff in on resisted attacks from passive Pokemon such as Qwilfish and Gastrodon, since you can shut them down with Sleep Powder. If the opponent has a Grass-type or you predict an obvious switch to one of Jumpluff's checks like Aggron, use U-turn to keep up momentum. Once Jumpluff is low on health and has supported the team, you can sacrifice it by going for Memento to give free setup to a teammate like Dodrio or Carracosta.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Jumpluff will likely be doing a good bit of pivoting in and out throughout the match with U-turn, so entry hazard removal is beneficial to ensure it doesn't get worn down. Hitmonchan in particular is a good partner for Jumpluff because it can offensively check Ice-, Steel-, and Fire-types such as Abomasnow, Aggron, and Simisear for Jumpluff. Setup sweepers such as Jynx and Omastar are also good teammates because they appreciate the Memento support that Jumpluff provides making setup easier. Other Pokemon with Volt Switch or U-turn, pair well with Jumpluff; the likes of Eelektross and Silvally-Fairy complete good VoltTurn cores. Eelektross soft checks a lot of special attackers and provides Knock Off support along with ways to deal with Pokemon such as Lanturn and Regirock. Silvally-Fairy on the other hand offers Defog support and a secondary resistance to Fighting-types like Hitmonchan that Jumpluff can't consistently check. Lastly, Jumpluff struggles immensely with Ice-type Pokemon, so a teammate that can handle the likes of Aurorus and Abomasnow such as Assault Vest Crabominable or Combusken is appreciated.</p>"

One of Granbull's main selling points over other Fairy-types is its access to Earthquake, which discourages Poison- and Steel-types such as Qwilfish and Aggron from switching in. Granbull's access to utility moves such as Heal Bell and Thunder Wave also allows it to cure status for its team. Unfortunately Granbull suffers from a low Special Defense stat, leaving it vulnerable to most special wallbreakers, as well as a poor Speed stat which hinders its offensive capabilities. Granbull notably lacks reliable recovery and relies on Leftovers or Z-Heal Bell to heal. Because of this, Granbull's role as a defensive Fairy-type is contested by Clefairy and Silvally-Fairy, with the former having better special bulk as well as access to Soft-Boiled and Stealth Rock and the latter having access to superior utility options in Parting Shot and Defog, while also performing better in an offensive role.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Granbull can run maximum Defense EVs instead of maximum Attack along with an Impish nature in order to be as physically bulky as possible at the cost of damage output if a more supportive role is required. In terms of items, Rocky Helmet is an option that allows Granbull to punish physical attackers or pressure them into switching, but it sacrifices what little recovery Granbull has. Choice Band can also be used to complement Granbull's Attack stat and improve its wallbreaking ability, but it is outclassed by other wallbreakers such as Stoutland and removes Granbull's utility. Thunder Wave can be swapped for Toxic in order to wear down bulky walls and switch-ins, but Thunder Wave is often preferred, as it acts more immediately and leaves special sweepers open to revenge kills from teammates. Roar is another alternative to Thunder Wave if Granbull's team is weak to setup sweepers. If coverage is an issue, Granbull can swap Earthquake for Fire Punch to hit certain Steel-types such as Ferroseed and Alolan Sandslash harder; however, Earthquake is typically preferred for the additional damage against Poison-types like Qwilfish and Skuntank.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Specially offensive Poison-types such as Haunter and Victreebel are capable of switching in on and OHKOing Granbull without much worry.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: While Granbull isn't particularly bothered by some walls, it's threatened by those capable of outlasting it and possibly hitting back with special attacks. This includes bulky Grass-types such as Bellossom and Tangela, which receive reliable recovery in the form of Strength Sap and Synthesis and can use Granbull as setup fodder in the case of the former, and Mudsdale, which is immune to Thunder Wave and can outdamage it with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Hard-hitters capable of outspeeding Granbull, such as Choice Specs Jellicent and Simisear, threaten it massively, as its low Special Defense leaves Granbull weak to invested special attacks.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Most Steel-types, such as Aggron and Alolan Sandslash, can switch into Play Rough fairly easily and threaten Granbull with their Steel-type STAB attacks. However, most Steel-types in the tier are OHKOed or 2HKOed by Earthquake, save for Ferroseed and the rare Bronzor. Ferroseed is especially notable, as it can shrug off damage with Leech Seed recovery and set down entry hazards in front of Granbull.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Granbull suffers badly from chip damage, entry hazards, and Leech Seed due to its lack of recovery, making Pokemon such as the aforementioned Qwilfish and Ferroseed extremely difficult for it to deal with.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Heal Bell provides Granbull with some nice utility, allowing it to remove any status ailments from its team, including itself. Thunder Wave provides additional utility and speed control, helping to cripple fast foes such as Scyther and Alolan Persian, as well as improving matchups against switch-ins such as Aggron and Alolan Sandslash. Play Rough gives Granbull offensive pressure and forces switches on Fighting- and Dark-type Pokemon such as Hitmonchan, Gurdurr, Alolan Raticate, and Absol. Earthquake allows Granbull to reliably dent Poison- and Steel-type foes that switch into it, such as Alolan Sandslash and Qwilfish. Super Fang is an alternative to Earthquake that is useful against bulky Pokemon that lack recovery such as Regirock or if Granbull is low on HP as a last stand.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers provides Granbull with residual recovery, which it otherwise lacks, but Z-Heal Bell is another viable choice that provides Granbull with a one-time-use full recovery that cannot be removed by Knock Off. Maximum Attack investment allows Granbull to 2HKO Gurdurr and OHKO Hitmonchan, as well as OHKO Aggron after Stealth Rock with Earthquake. The investment in Speed allows Granbull to outspeed uninvested base 50 Speed Pokemon such as Regirock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Granbull works best early-game as a switch-in to walls or bulky offensive Pokemon like Gurdurr, where it can get off a Heal Bell and possibly a Play Rough before the opponent switches out. If running Z-Heal Bell, it should ideally be used when Granbull is low on health and expecting the opponent to switch out to ensure maximum longevity. Earthquake should be used when expecting a Fairy resist like Aggron, Qwilfish or Alolan Sandslash to switch in, though it can not take out the latter without considerable damage. Thunder Wave can be a solid move to throw out against offense that relies on Pokemon such as Victreebel and Haunter to check Granbull, as paralysis cripples them heavily and makes them more susceptible to other Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Granbull tends to fit best on bulky offense and balance teams due to its high HP and Attack stats allowing it to deal damage as well as take hits. Its ability to both spread and remove status is also an asset to such teams and provides good role compression. Wallbreakers and cleaners such as Kangaskhan, Zangoose, and Absol appreciate Thunder Wave support due to their average Speed tiers, and both Zangoose and Absol, which are particularly frail, can switch out to Granbull to avoid being revenge killed by Gurdurr or Hitmonchan. Granbull appreciates the presence of bulky offensive Steel- and Ground-types such as Aggron and Mudsdale, which resist or are immune to Granbull's main weakness in Poison and can often switch in freely on Poison- or Steel-type attacks. Additionally, Aggron in turn benefits from Granbull's ability to force out Fighting-types such as Gurdurr, giving Aggron time to safely switch in. Granbull is capable of tanking a Knock Off for a threatened teammate such as Ferroseed or Golurk, particularly with Normalium Z. Entry hazard removers make brilliant partners for Granbull with their ability to mitigate its lack of recovery, and those with low Defense such as Skuntank and Hitmonchan appreciate Granbull's Intimidate ability giving them an opening to switch in. Furthermore, Hitmonchan threatens Steel-types for Granbull, and special Skuntank is able to eliminate some checks to Granbull such as Qwilfish. Alolan Sandslash also synergizes well with Granbull in this sense due to its Poison-type immunity and access to Rapid Spin. Finally, special wallbreakers such as Drampa make good teammates, as Granbull often baits in physical walls like Mudsdale and Tangela.</p>"

  "Qwilfish": {
    "overview": "<p>Qwilfish is one of the PU tier's top Spikes and Toxic Spikes setters thanks to its good physical bulk, solid defensive typing, and access to Intimidate, which lets it handle a good number of the tier's physical attackers such as Gurdurr and Skuntank. In addition, a solid Speed tier and access to Taunt make Qwilfish the premier Spikes user of the tier, separating it from other Spikers such as Ferroseed and Roselia, which are unable to touch opposing Taunt users such as Skuntank and Aggron. With a multitude of support moves to choose from, like Taunt, Thunder Wave, and Destiny Bond, Qwilfish is able to add a great amount of utility to teams and succeeds at performing different functions apart from setting entry hazards. Swords Dance also enables Qwilfish to function as a fast rain sweeper alongside its near-unresisted STAB combination and ability to remove Toxic Spikes. However, Qwilfish lacks recovery, which means it's susceptible to getting chipped throughout the course of a game from hazards and continually switching into the Pokemon it needs to check like Hitmonchan and Gurdurr. Qwilfish also has a really poor Special Defense stat and is at the mercy of special attackers like Alolan Raichu and Drampa, which easily force it out. In addition, Qwilfish's passiveness means these special attackers have an even easier time threatening it, since it cannot do anything in return to force them out. Furthermore, outside of rain, Qwilfish struggles to break through bulkier walls such as Gurdurr and Gastrodon and relies on Explosion in order to threaten these Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave lets Qwilfish cripple faster opponents without relying on a Scald burn, but is difficult to find space for. Running Protect on the utility set enables Qwilfish to scout against Choice Scarf users such as Kabutops and Aurorus, easing prediction, and can rack up residual damage alongside Toxic Spikes or Scald burns, but it is hard to find room for. Pain Split gives Qwilfish more reliable recovery than Black Sludge, especially if you have opted for Rocky Helmet, but Qwilfish's other utility moves like Destiny Bond tend to be more useful and are necessary to cripple certain threats. Maximum Defense investment instead of Speed on the utility set makes Qwilfish bulkier to better take on threats like Stoutland; however, Qwilfish loses out on Speed, which is quite important in order to use Taunt on certain Pokemon, and is left more vulnerable to Pokemon like Aurorus. Ice Beam and Icium Z can be used on Utility Qwilfish to double as a lure for certain Grass-types such as Victreebel and Torterra.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers such as Drampa, Alolan Raichu, and Oricorio-E easily threaten out Qwilfish with their strong attacks due to Qwilfish's low Special Defense stat and can use Qwilfish as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Faster Taunt users like Oricorio-G and Alolan Persian prevent Qwilfish from setting up entry hazards and stop Qwilfish from utilizing its status moves like Thunder Wave and Destiny Bond. Oricorio-G is then able to set up with Calm Mind, and Alolan Persian can pivot into something that checks Qwilfish with the use of Parting Shot.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removal</strong>: Hazard removers like Silvally-Fairy and Rotom-F shut down Qwilfish's attempts to set up Spikes or Toxic Spikes. Both possess Thunderbolt to check Qwilfish, but Silvally-Fairy has to scout for Poison Jab.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Rain sweeper Qwilfish struggles to break through bulkier Pokemon like Gurdurr and Gastrodon, which take Qwilfish's attacks quite well. Nevertheless, Explosion can catch these Pokemon off guard and deal a good amount of damage, making room for teammates such as Kabutops to take advantage.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald has the potential to burn opposing Pokemon, greatly crippling physical attackers such as Aggron and Primeape and preventing Dodrio from using Qwilfish as setup fodder. Waterfall is an alternative over Scald, having higher damage output and a flinch chance and pairing better with Poison Jab. Taunt is essential on Qwilfish to shut down slower Pokemon like Regirock, Jellicent, and Gurdurr, preventing them from setting up entry hazards, recovering, and setting up. Taunt also stops slower hazard removers like Skuntank and Articuno to keep Qwilfish's hazards on the field. Destiny Bond can make it difficult for slower Pokemon, such as Eelektross, to safely KO Qwilfish. Poison Jab gives Qwilfish a way to hit Water- and Grass-types that can otherwise give it trouble, such as Lanturn and Abomasnow, making it slightly more threatening offensively. Toxic Spikes give Qwilfish a bit more utility in certain matchups, but can be somewhat hit or miss if facing teams with non-grounded hazard control or Poison-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Timid is the preferred nature if running Scald, and Jolly is superior if running Waterfall. Intimidate in conjunction with maximum HP investment gives Qwilfish better opportunities to set up entry hazards and allows it to take on physical attackers like Hitmonchan and Scyther. Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers that utilize contact moves such as Hitmonchan and racks up damage against U-turn and Knock Off users like Scyther and Gurdurr. Alternatively, Black Sludge provides Qwilfish with the recovery it otherwise lacks and lets it better handle the chip damage it accumulates over the game.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Qwilfish can come in on more passive Pokemon like Clefairy and Gurdurr, prevent them from setting up with Taunt, and set up Spikes when a switch is expected. It is ideal to do this early-game to immediately apply pressure with entry hazards. Taunt can also be used against slower hazard removers like Altaria and Skuntank to stop them from removing hazards. Aside from setting up Spikes, Qwilfish is able to spread status with Thunder Wave to punish its switch-ins like Victreebel, Jellicent, and Cryogonal. Once Qwilfish has fulfilled it role of setting hazards, Destiny Bond should be used against slower foes that are able to KO it like Choice Specs Aurorus and Victreebel, eliminating a wallbreaker from your opponent's side. Qwilfish should rely on teammates that have good matchups against the aforementioned Pokemon. If Qwilfish has been weakened enough, it is recommended just to bring in it and set up Spikes, as any defensive utility is gone once its health has been depleted. Destiny Bond can also be used at this point.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spinblockers are essential to have with Qwilfish, as they prevent its Spikes and Toxic Spikes from being removed. Golurk is notable for also doubling as an entry hazard setter. Other common spinblockers are Jellicent, Silvally-Ghost, and Oricorio-G, and all of them are able to reliably deal with Primeape, which Qwilfish cannot handle well. Oricorio-G and Choice Specs Jellicent also benefit from the entry hazards Qwilfish provides, and defensive Jellicent can take advantage of Qwilfish's ability to spread status by utilizing Hex. Primeape also works well with Qwilfish, deterring the use of Defog due to its ability Defiant and benefiting from the damage that Spikes provide. It also appreciates Qwilfish being able to handle Gurdurr, and Qwilfish appreciates Primeape handling Cryogonal and Aurorus. Kangaskhan and Omastar are examples of wallbreakers and sweepers that appreciate Qwilfish's Spikes. In return, Qwilfish handles the Fighting-type Pokemon that bother them like Hitmonchan and Gurdurr. Specially bulky Pokemon like Hitmonchan handle special attackers like Aurorus and Eelektross. Hitmonchan also possesses hazard removal in Rapid Spin, making sure that the hazards Qwilfish has set up do not disappear and increasing Qwilfish's longevity by preventing additional damage. Eelektross is also a nice partner for Qwilfish, handling fast Electric- and Ground-type Pokemon like Alolan Raichu and Mudsdale. It can also pivot back out to Qwilfish if they switch out, and Qwilfish can continue to apply pressure by setting up hazards.</p>"

      "Rain Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Waterfall and Liquidation are Qwilfish's options for rain-boosted STAB moves; the former is preferred for its 20% chance to cause a flinch to the opposing Pokemon, but the latter is also an option for increased damage and a potential Defense drop. Explosion is Qwilfish's strongest move and can instantly break through any Pokemon that are not in range of its STAB attacks like Gastrodon. Explosion also offers momentum and allows one of Qwilfish's teammates to come in.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature is preferred over Jolly to maximize Qwilfish's wallbreaking power, especially when rain is active. Life Orb offers a consistent boost in damage but gives Qwilfish recoil damage after every attack. Waterium Z gives Qwilfish a one-time nuke, easily chunking opposing Pokemon under rain, especially at +2 Attack, without the recoil Life Orb possesses.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Qwilfish should be brought in ideally when rain is active on the field, as Swift Swim allows it to outspeed every unboosted Pokemon in the tier and rain boosts its damage output. While Qwilfish to able to switch into weaker attacks like Hitmonchan and Gurdurr's Drain Punch, its poor bulk limits opportunities to switch in against other Pokemon. Swords Dance should only be used against more passive Pokemon like Clefairy and Audino, which cannot damage Qwilfish reliably, or against threats Qwilfish forces out, such as Golurk. Explosion should only be used to knock out specific threats like Gastrodon or generate momentum by bringing in another teammate like Ludicolo. Using this move at the right time is a necessity, as Qwilfish is sacrificed. Qwilfish's status as one of the fastest Swift Swim Pokemon in the tier benefits rain teams, and bringing it in to revenge kill Choice Scarf users like Dodrio and Scyther, which are able to outspeed partners like Ludicolo, helps out the team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rain setters such as Volbeat and Liepard are required in order for this set to function properly. Liepard and Volbeat also offer U-turn support, and both have access to Prankster, which ensures rain can be safely set up. Other rain sweepers like Kabutops, Ludicolo, and Omastar work well with Qwilfish, since it is able to break opposing Pokemon to give them a better time cleaning as well. The latter two break through physical walls like Gurdurr, which Qwilfish has trouble dealing with, and Qwilfish handles Poliwrath and Tangela for Kabutops, which easily wall it. Pokemon that also deal with Choice Scarf Aurorus and Abomasnow are ideal, since they stop rain with their hail and outspeed Qwilfish. Choice Scarf Primeape is a good example, being able to threaten the two of them with Close Combat. In addition, Alolan Sandslash uses the hail Aurorus and Abomasnow sets up against them and checks them with Iron Head. Assault Vest Crabominable is also notable for its ability to threaten them with super effective STAB Fighting attacks and appreciates rain weakening Fire-type attacks.</p>"

  "Shuckle": {
    "overview": "<p>Shuckle's great bulk gives it a niche over other Sticky Web setters, which are all extremely frail. The rest of its movepool furthers this, with good support moves such as Encore, Knock Off, and Infestation. Shuckle's amazing base 230 defenses and tolerable Bug / Rock typing give it a good amount of longevity, allowing it to more easily set up entry hazards and not always serve simply as a suicide lead. It also lets Shuckle perform well on both hyper and bulky offensive teams. However, the rest of its stats are utterly atrocious, with absolutely no offensive presence, the lowest base Speed in the game, and a low HP stat that its defenses do not appreciate. Furthermore, it faces a good amount of competition from other Sticky Web setters, such as Smeargle and Leavanny. On top of their much higher Speed stats, Smeargle has a better support movepool with access to moves such as Spore and Taunt to give it an easier matchup against slower foes and Nuzzle to cripple faster foes. Leavanny provides an offensive presence that threatens entry hazard removers such as Skuntank and has support moves of its own such as Magic Coat, which helps against opposing leads and Taunt users. Despite this, Shuckle maintains its niche with its much better bulk, which allows it to set both hazards more reliably than Smeargle, and its access to Stealth Rock, unlike Leavanny, which allows it to also pressure bulkier teams that do not mind Sticky Web. Shuckle's bulk and access to Sturdy also allow it to hold a Mental Herb, although the item can only be used once. However, this makes it less reliant on predictions through moves such as Spore and Magic Coat to get up hazards against Taunt users like Alolan Persian.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Final Gambit can be used to more easily gain momentum, which is especially useful on hyper offensive teams. However, this is at the cost of KOing Shuckle while doing little damage to the foe due to Shuckle's low HP. A physically defensive spread can be run to better wall physical attackers, although Shuckle's natural physical bulk and typing already allow it to wall Pokemon such as Kangaskhan and Spiritomb. Rock Tomb is an alternate option for one of Shuckle's support moves, as it lowers the Speed of the opponent's lead as well as any Flying-types, which are immune to Sticky Web. However, Rock Tomb is much more situational compared to Shuckle's other support moves, especially because Flying-types can just switch out to reset their Speed and are already bothered by Shuckle's other support moves. Leftovers increases Shuckle's longevity, but without a Mental Herb, Shuckle is left much more vulnerable to Taunt and Encore. Rest is another way to accomplish this, but it can be easily taken advantage of by foes, forces Shuckle to lose out on a support move, and drains all momentum, which is counterproductive on an offensive team. However, Rest can be run on a dedicated trapping set that utilizes Infestation. On bulkier teams, Shuckle can utilize its high defenses and good support movepool to run a more defensive oriented set, replacing Sticky Web with another of its support moves. However, this is generally better accomplished by Pokemon like Regirock with its better defensive typing.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Due to the Mental Herb's single-use nature, Taunt restricts Shuckle to only setting one of its two entry hazards for the time being. It also disables Shuckle's ability to use many of its support moves, such as Encore and Toxic. Pokemon such as Qwilfish, Alolan Persian, and Sableye are all examples of Taunt users. After using Taunt, Qwilfish can also use Shuckle as fodder to set up Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: Pokemon with access to hazard removal like Skuntank, Swanna, Hitmonchan, and Silvally-Fairy can discard Shuckle's entry hazards, although they can be crippled by utility moves such as Encore and Infestation.</p> <p><strong>Z-Move Setup Sweepers</strong>: Pokemon such as Lycanroc, Alolan Raichu, Carracosta, and Omastar can essentially use Shuckle as setup fodder without much fear of Encore, as even if it switches out, their Z-Moves allow them to break through Encore for a single turn. These sweepers can be hard for the rest of the team to revenge kill for various reasons, such as their naturally high Speed, use of Substitute, and ability to boost their Speed with Shell Smash, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Pokemon that can 2HKO Shuckle such as Floatzel, Ludicolo, and Choice Band Torterra can limit it to setting up only one of its entry hazards. If Sturdy is broken, Choice Band Aggron can OHKO Shuckle. Aggron is also notable because it is immune to Toxic and its non-Choice Band variants run Taunt.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sticky Web Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sticky Web provides support for Shuckle's teammates, slowing down all of the opponent's grounded Pokemon, which can help against faster threats and allows the team to more efficiently overwhelm the opponent. Stealth Rock is another way for Shuckle to help out its teammates, weakening foes as they switch. This is especially useful against Flying-types like Swanna, which are immune to Sticky Web, and bulkier teams that do not mind the Speed decrease. Encore can lock Pokemon such as Mudsdale and Regirock into moves like Stealth Rock so that Shuckle can set up its entry hazards more easily. It also gives Shuckle a way to deal with foes that may try to set up on it such as Carracosta, but Shuckle should stay wary of Z-Move users like Alolan Raichu and Lycanroc, which can bypass Encore for a turn. Toxic gives Shuckle a way to deal a decent amount of damage over time and can be used to whittle down bulkier foes such as Spiritomb and Eelektross that can potentially give its teammates trouble. Knock Off is another way to weaken these bulkier threats, as well as Eviolite users like Clefairy and Ferroseed. It can also cripple Choice Scarf users like Primeape, as its Choice Scarf would otherwise cancel out Sticky Web's Speed decrease. Finally, Infestation traps Pokemon Shuckle can use as setup fodder such as Kangaskhan. It goes well with Encore, as it can trap Pokemon that are locked into a preferred move. It also deals some chip damage each turn, giving it a similar effect to Toxic, albeit less intense. Both Knock Off and Infestation are notably not stopped by Taunt.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum EVs in HP and Special Defense with a Calm nature allow Shuckle to better take special hits from Pokemon such as Aurorus so it can more reliably set up entry hazards. Mental Herb gives Shuckle one-time protection from Taunt and Encore users like Sableye, Alolan Persian, and lead Aurorus, which almost guarantees it will be able to set up at least one of its hazards. Sturdy further ensures this, allowing it to take at least one hit from powerful attackers that could otherwise OHKO Shuckle like Choice Band Aggron, as well as potential critical hits.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Shuckle is a dedicated lead, so it should be sent out first to get up its entry hazards as soon as possible. Against opposing balance and offense, its primary goal should be to set up Sticky Web before Stealth Rock, as its teammates will often benefit from the foes' Speed drops. However, if facing a more defensive team, Stealth Rock should be your priority, as bulky Pokemon care little about Sticky Web's Speed decrease. Shuckle can be used as an outright suicide lead if you do not fear the opponent's hazard removal. In this case, if it manages to set up both hazards, it should use its remaining turns to utilize its support moves like Toxic and Knock Off to cripple the opposing team as much as it can. On bulky offense teams, after setting up hazards, Shuckle can be withdrawn and saved for later to reset the hazards if need be, utilize its support moves, check certain threats, or simply be used as death fodder. A similar strategy can be used if Shuckle is matched up against a Pokemon such as Floatzel, as due to the predictability of leading Shuckle, the opponent may try to lead with a Pokemon that has a good matchup against it. Another option in such situations is to not lead with Shuckle but instead lead with a Pokemon that has a better matchup while saving Shuckle for a later opportunity to switch in and set up the hazards. If the opponent leads with a Pokemon that can potentially set up, like Calm Mind or Stealth Rock Clefairy or Shell Smash Carracosta, Encore is an option to go for first turn. Shuckle can use the locked foe as a chance to set up its hazards, or even disable them from switching with Infestation. This can also be used as an opportunity for Shuckle to switch into a more offensive teammate. However, be wary that the opponent may just switch out for a better matchup, making Encore fail altogether. Finally, Shuckle can help against Trick Room and weather teams, as it can utilize its low Speed to Encore the opposing lead into moves like Rain Dance and Stealth Rock, and even trap them with Infestation to waste turns. Weather teams also do not appreciate Sticky Web.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Shuckle should be run on Sticky Web-based offensive teams. Such teams generally include decently fast setup sweepers, such as Carracosta and Omastar, that can take advantage of the Sticky Web to more easily sweep with less fear of being outsped. Faster setup sweepers such as Oricorio-E, Dodrio, and Simisear and other faster Pokemon such as Floatzel similarly appreciate being able to more reliably outspeed foes, specifically Choice Scarf users like Primeape. Finally, slower wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Victreebel benefit from Sticky Web, as they can supply immediate power without having to fear being easily revenge killed. Primeape and Pawniard both run Defiant, which allows them to switch in against and take advantage of Defog users like Skuntank and Silvally-Fairy. They also often pressure the opponent into being more hesitant to use Defog altogether. Ghost-types like Oricorio-G and Jellicent can block the other form of entry hazard removal in Rapid Spin and can help against Defiant Primeape. Although they take a decent amount from Stealth Rock, Flying-types like Swanna and Oricorio-G are immune to Sticky Web, making them large threats to these teams. Therefore, Pokemon that can check them such as Cryogonal can come in handy.</p>"

  "Ursaring": {
    "overview": "<p>Monstrous Attack, access to Swords Dance, and a powerful ability in Guts make Ursaring a force to be reckoned with as a physical wallbreaker. This, combined with its fairly low Speed, makes it a near mandatory member for Trick Room teams as a wallbreaker. Its bulk is good enough so that it isn't too threatened by priority outside of Mach Punch. However, Ursaring's Speed and mediocre bulk mean that, outside of Trick Room, it's very vulnerable to faster attackers. It also faces competition from other physical Normal-types such as Kangaskhan and Stoutland, which fit on more common playstyles, while Ursaring is usually dedicated to only Trick Room. While it does have a large number of coverage moves, Ursaring finds itself very predictable because it generally chooses the same moves for any set.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Despite facing stiff competition from faster Normal-types like Stoutland and Kangaskhan, faster Guts variants with maximum Speed investment are nevertheless very effective at wallbreaking, and can utilize Protect to safely activate Guts against common leads like Eelektross and Primeape, making Ursaring a decent anti-lead. Quick Feet can be used with a Toxic Orb instead of a Flame Orb, but, even with the boost, Ursaring is outsped by Pokemon like Lycanroc and is easily revenge killed because of its bulk. This set is much weaker than other sets because of Ursaring's Jolly nature and loss of a Guts boost. Earthquake can be used as a coverage option over Close Combat to eliminate the Defense and Special Defense drops while still hitting most of the same Pokemon, but it lacks a lot of power in comparison to Close Combat. Play Rough is an option to hit Sableye and Spiritomb for super effective damage, but it is generally worse than Crunch because Crunch can hit a wider range of Ghost-types. Seed Bomb more immediately threatens Colbur Berry variants of Jellicent but is otherwise inferior to Crunch. A Bulk Up set with Rest and Sleep Talk is an alternative way to set up, and, while it doesn't provide as much offensive pressure as Swords Dance, the Defense boosts help its matchup against Foul Play users and other physical attackers. However, this is usually outclassed by Type: Null.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon</strong>: Fighting-types threaten Ursaring greatly with their super effective STAB attacks. Hitmonchan and Primeape easily outspeed and can KO Ursaring without Trick Room, although Hitmonchan needs a little chip damage to ensure it can OHKO Ursaring. Gurdurr can tank a Facade and 2HKO Ursaring, and a Mach Punch from Hitmonchan and Gurdurr can pick off a weakened Ursaring. However, all of these Pokemon lose to Ursaring if it already has set up a Swords Dance and is under Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Pokemon like Regirock and Mudsdale require Ursaring to set up a Swords Dance in order to OHKO them and can use the opportunity to set up Stealth Rock or get chip damage with Stone Edge or Earthquake. Regirock also has the option to run Sturdy, making Ursaring's job of KOing it even harder.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon</strong>: While not impenetrable, Ghost-types like Jellicent and Oricorio-G are capable of pivoting around Ursaringâ€™s attacks and can stall Trick Room turns. Black Glasses Spiritomb is able to take one hit from an unboosted Ursaring while 2HKOing it, and Aguav Berry variants can handle it in a similar manner.</p> <p><strong>Fake Out and Protect</strong>: This is more of a way to check the Trick Room playstyle that Ursaring often finds itself on, but stalling Trick Room turns helps minimize the damage Ursaring can do. Protect users like Regirock allow the player to scout what move Ursaring is going for, forcing the opponent to make a prediction on whether it will switch out or not, and Kangaskhan's Fake Out can do a sizable amount of damage to Ursaring.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Outside of Trick Room, Ursaring is extremely slow, leaving it easily revenge killed by anything faster with a strong STAB move or Fighting-type coverage.</p>",

      "Trick Room Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Facade is Ursaring's go-to STAB move unless there is a foe resistant or immune to Normal-type moves. With 140 Base Power, STAB, and a boost from Guts when Ursaring is burned, Facade can break through almost anything in the tier. Crunch is used to hit Ghost-types like Oricorio-G and Jellicent super effectively while also hitting Sableye and Spiritomb neutrally to prevent Ursaring from being completely walled by them. Close Combat hits Rock- and Steel-types that resist Facade like Regirock, Carracosta, and Aggron.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Brave nature is used to make Ursaring's low Speed more effective under Trick Room. Guts boosts Ursaring's Attack even higher when affected by status and helps it beat common physical walls in the tier like Tangela. A Flame Orb is used to ensure that Ursaring can have Guts activated and to prevent it from being affected by Toxic poison and paralysis, which are much more detrimental.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ursaring under Trick Room is a dedicated physical wallbreaker, as there aren't many good checks to it that can take its Facade after a boost. Even with a sky-high Attack stat, Ursaring can fail to harm defensive Ghost-types that run Foul Play like Spiritomb, so it should try to play around those. Ursaring should try to use Swords Dance when coming in on a weak foe like Clefairy, though it should be wary of the rare Knock Off. Because Ursaring is a very prediction-reliant Pokemon and Trick Room is a hyper offensive playstyle, Ursaring should take advantage of the limited turns as much as possible. As its main role is to be a wallbreaker, it should allow a late-game cleaner like Drampa to finish off the other parts of a team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Trick Room setters like Carbink are mandatory partners for Ursaring. Carbink sets up Stealth Rock, has Magic Coat to prevent opposing entry hazards from being set up, and uses Explosion to bring in Ursaring for free. As a hard-hitting wallbreaker, Ursaring appreciates the help of U-turn support to get in on something it can take advantage of or threaten. Wishiwashi is notable, as it can lure in special walls like Audino and Eelektross for Ursaring to take advantage of. Special wallbreakers like Drampa help Ursaring deal with physically defensive Pokemon, namely Regirock and Tangela, and have an easier time cleaning after Ursaring breaks a team. Pokemon with moves like Memento, Explosion, and Healing Wish such as Carbink, Audino, and Musharna all help Ursaring get in for free and many Pokemon have access to one of these moves along with Trick Room. Musharna also acts as a Fighting-type check that helps cover Ursaring's weakness to Mach Punch. Ursaring and Crabominable form a great physically offensive core with Trick Room, with Ursaring absorbing status and being fairly reliable at breaking through Psychic-types like Musharna and Crabominable in return taking care of Normal-resistant and -immune Pokemon like Regirock and Jellicent.</p>"

  "Smeargle": {
    "overview": "<p>Smeargle is a satisfactory lead Pokemon in the tier due to its access to almost all moves, including useful support moves such as Spore, Sticky Web, and Stealth Rock. The combination of Spore and Nuzzle makes Smeargle very difficult to check without either something being crippled or entry hazards being set. Smeargle's Speed tier is also decent, allowing it to outpace common Stealth Rock setters such as Aurorus and Golurk, although it still is slower than a large part of the metagame, including two other Sticky Web setters, Masquerain and Leavanny. Smeargle's pitiful offensive and defensive stats prevent it from performing any roles outside of a suicide lead. This, in turn, makes it only usable on hyper offensive playstyles, as it is not bulky enough for any other roles and is almost useless once its Focus Sash has been broken. Due to its reliance on status moves, Smeargle is very susceptible to Taunt from Pokemon like Floatzel and Skuntank and is completely shut down by them unless carrying Magic Coat. It also faces competition from Leavanny and Masquerain, which are faster and have actual offensive pressure. However, Smeargle has a much better support movepool, including access to Spore and Stealth Rock. Competition from Shuckle is also detrimental, as, even though Smeargle does have access to Spore and Magic Coat, Shuckle has fantastic defenses alongside Sturdy, meaning it can function on more defensive teams while also not fearing Taunt as much, thanks to Mental Herb.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Explosion, Memento, and Parting Shot are options in the last moveslot, although Nuzzle is generally more beneficial for Smeargle's team and Taunt can prevent opposing entry hazards, among other things. Explosion has the benefit of preventing entry hazard removal by foes like Hitmonchan and Adamant Skuntank, while Memento and Parting Shot weaken the foe and bring in a teammate relatively unscathed. Smeargle can run an offensive set with Belly Drum, although it requires an entire team dedicated to support it and is weak even at +6. Z-Geomancy and Geomancy + Power Herb are options for offensive sets that look good on paper but share similar difficulties with the aforementioned set. Destiny Bond gives Smeargle the opportunity to take down the opponent if they KO it, but Smeargle often prefers the utility its other moves offer. Spikes and Toxic Spikes give Smeargle another way of stacking hazards, but the loss of Taunt, Nuzzle, or Magic Coat makes Smeargle less effective as a suicide lead.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt is the most intimidating thing for Smeargle to face, as Pokemon like Lycanroc and Skuntank completely stop Smeargle in its tracks, unless it has access to Magic Coat and predicts correctly. They do have to be wary of Nuzzle crippling them, however.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Although Smeargle is often able to get off at least one entry hazard, faster Pokemon such as Cryogonal and Kabutops can put an immense amount of pressure on it with Rapid Spin. Both Choice Scarf Abomasnow and Aurorus only let Smeargle set one entry hazard thanks to hail damage + Blizzard KOing it. Fake Out Kangaskhan is also able to stop Smeargle from setting up.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types and Levitate Users</strong>: Although not a direct threat to Smeargle, Flying-types and Levitate users like Swanna and Rotom-F ignore the Speed drop caused by Sticky Web and are also capable of removing Sticky Web from the field with Defog.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sticky Web Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sticky Web is Smeargle's main utility, allowing its slower teammates to outpace usually faster grounded Pokemon. Stealth Rock can help break foes' Focus Sash and Sturdy as well as break them down for teammates to have an easier time cleaning. Spore allows Smeargle to put foes to sleep, ensuring that it can use one, if not both, of its entry hazards. Spore can also allow teammates to switch in freely and even set up. Nuzzle prevents Smeargle from being completely immobilized by Taunt and can paralyze both Pokemon immune to Spore, such as Sap Sipper Drampa and Grass-types, and faster foes like Floatzel. Taunt is another utility move that can prevent slower Pokemon, like Clefairy and Ferroseed, from using status moves, especially shutting down opposing entry hazard setters, although it forces Smeargle to Struggle if Taunted, since it would have no attacking moves. Magic Coat is an alternative fourth move that allows Smeargle to bounce back Taunt from users like Skuntank, which would otherwise completely shut it down bar fearing the paralysis from Nuzzle.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given HP investment helps Smeargle's overall bulk, although it's almost worthless due to its abysmal defensive stats, still being 2HKOed by almost every Pokemon in the tier. Focus Sash allows Smeargle to take any single hit and ensures it will be able to use one of its utility moves before fainting. Own Tempo is the best ability that Smeargle can run, since it prevents potential confusion, although it is not very useful in most situations.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to its lackluster offensive and defensive presence, Smeargle is used solely as a suicide lead, getting up entry hazards to support its teammates. Smeargle should almost always prioritize Sticky Web over Stealth Rock, as the former supports the hyper offensive teams that it's usually found on better. This is especially true against Choice Scarf users like Abomasnow and Aurorus, which outspeed Smeargle and knock it out with a combination of Blizzard and hail damage. In order to do this, Smeargle should use Spore on opposing Pokemon to get up as many hazards as it can and cripple the target. Alternatively, Nuzzle should be used against threatening Pokemon that are immune to Spore or can be revenge killed by a partner if slowed. Nuzzle can also be useful later in the game versus setup sweepers like Floatzel and Lycanroc, if Smeargle's Focus Sash is kept intact from earlier, preventing them from sweeping. Taunt users like Sableye and Skuntank should be looked out for, as they completely shut down and make Smeargle useless during the early game. This prompts either another lead to be used or a mind game to be played with Magic Coat against said Pokemon. Based on certain matchups, Sticky Web has no real use if the opposing team is slower than yours already, such as playing against Trick Room or stall teams, meaning that Stealth Rock or Taunt should be used instead.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Smeargle can only function as a suicide lead effectively, it is designed to support offensive teams. Slower, strong attackers like Jellicent, Abomasnow, and Stoutland all appreciate the Speed drop Sticky Web inflicts on grounded foes, allowing them to outspeed and deal with usually standard checks like Skuntank, Simisear, and Kangaskhan that would otherwise outspeed and either severely weaken or KO them. Defiant and Contrary users such as Primeape and Lurantis are almost essential on Sticky Web teams, as the ability to punish Defog with a +2 boost in Attack or a +1 boost in Evasion makes the opponent extremely cautious of trying to remove entry hazards, especially in the case of Choice Scarf Primeape, which can capitalize on its high Speed stat along with its Attack boost to dismantle other offensive teams with ease. The U-turn utility that Primeape offers is also invaluable, as hyper offensive teams rarely want to directly switch into a foe's attacks due to their frail structure, and it allows these types of teams to keep momentum. Spinblockers such as Oricorio-G and Jellicent prevent Rapid Spin users, such as Hitmonchan and Kabutops, from removing your hazards and pressure them with either powerful attacks or status. Both also support Sticky Web teams differently, with Oricorio-G being able to benefit from the Speed drop to sweep more easily with Calm Mind and Supersonic Skystrike, and with Jellicent taking advantage of the speed drop to bypass Pursuit users such as Skuntank and Stoutland while abusing the likes of Choice Scarf Primeape locked into Close Combat. Oricorio-G and Jellicent are also able to grab momentum no matter whether the opponent predicts incorrectly and goes for Rapid Spin or attacks and KOes them, as this allows another teammate to come in while hazards are left intact. Oricorio-G can also be used for its fantastic matchup against Trick Room teams, being capable of using Substitute and setting up on the most common lead setter, Carbink. Setup sweepers like Carracosta and Alolan Raichu are able to use the Speed reduction to get free setup turns and sweep without as much fear of being revenge killed by Choice Scarf users like Primeape. Torterra is able to focus on setting up Swords Dance over Agility in some matchups, as it doesn't have to worry too much about its middling Speed and being revenge killed by foes such as Choice Specs Aurorus, while Alolan Raichu can get free boosts against more balance-oriented teams. Spore support from Smeargle can also give the aforementioned  setup sweepers free turns.</p>"

  "Combusken": {
    "overview": "<p>Access to the fantastic ability Speed Boost gives Combusken a solid niche in PU, allowing it to reliably clean opposing teams late-game and, in combination with Swords Dance, break through Pokemon such as Carbink that serve as common checks to other offensive Fire-types like Simisear and Turtonator. Its Speed boosts also allow it to punish teams reliant on traditional revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Primeape and Alolan Sandslash to deal with other Fire-types like Simisear for sacrificing Pokemon to bring their revenge killer in safely. Combusken can run both physical and special sets that can break through each other's checks such as Gurdurr for the former and Lanturn for the latter. A near-unresisted STAB combination also makes it a reliable late-game cleaner, provided its main counter in Jellicent is removed. However, Combusken faces fierce competition as an offensive Fire-type from Simisear, as the latter's greater base Speed and Special Attack allow it to more immediately threaten opposing teams, and, importantly, its access to Grass Knot allows it to reliably break through one of Combusken's hardest counters in Jellicent. Furthermore, Combusken is held back by its low Speed, which leaves it outsped by common Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Dodrio even after two Speed boosts. This fact coupled with Combusken's poor bulk also forces it to often use Protect first against faster Pokemon that can cripple or OHKO it such as Alolan Sandslash and Aurorus, potentially offering free switches to checks such as Lanturn and Eelektross. It also limits Combusken's ability to switch into resisted attacks or aggressively double switch in, which leaves it with limited setup opportunities compared to bulkier setup sweepers such as Gurdurr and Carracosta that offer some defensive utility and leaves it more vulnerable to being revenge killed by priority users such as Hitmonchan, Lycanroc, and Gurdurr.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flamethrower can be run over Fire Blast for a more accurate Fire-type STAB attack to more reliably clean late-game and poison stall foes more easily thanks to its higher PP. The lower damage output can cause Combusken to struggle to claim KOs, however, such as the 2HKO on Silvally-Fairy after Stealth Rock. Hidden Power Ice is an option instead of Hidden Power Electric that allows Combusken to hit Altaria super effectively; however, this provides little coverage compared to Hidden Power Electric otherwise, not to mention specially defensive Altaria is not 2HKOed unless Stealth Rock is up. Furthermore, Altaria is a lot less common than Pokemon such as Qwilfish and Jellicent. Thunder Punch is an option on Swords Dance variants that allows Combusken to threaten Jellicent and Qwilfish without them being significantly weakened or removed first, but this prevents Combusken from running Protect, which will make it harder to accrue safe Speed boosts.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Certain Water-type Pokemon such as Jellicent and Qwilfish resist Combusken's STAB combination. Defensive Jellicent sets in particular are capable of walling all Combusken sets unless Toxic Spikes are present. Qwilfish can greatly threaten Swords Dance Combusken sets, but it must watch out for Hidden Power Electric from special attacking sets, which can 2HKO it. Gastrodon can also wall special Combusken sets and can check Swords Dance sets not running Fightinium Z. Assault Vest Lanturn can also be problematic for special sets, as Focus Blast is only a 4HKO, while Lanturn can OHKO Combusken in return with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Despite its ability, Combusken's low Speed enables Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Dodrio and Primeape to outspeed and revenge kill it even after two Speed boosts. Priority users such as Carracosta, Floatzel, and Hitmonchan are also capable of revenge killing Combusken, though Hitmonchan needs some chip damage from entry hazards or Combusken setting Substitutes.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Clefairy, Carbink, and Altaria are capable of walling Combusken's special attacking set, even with Toxic Spikes present provided Carbink has Rest, with the former two also using it as setup fodder.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hidden Power Electric allows Combusken to OHKO Swanna and 2HKO Qwilfish, which both resist its STAB moves. Substitute can be run instead to allow Combusken to punish switches and protect itself from Pokemon such as Dodrio and Carracosta that would otherwise revenge kill it, gain extra Speed boosts, and stall poisoned Pokemon. Protect allows Combusken to get a free Speed boost and scout Choice item Pokemon such as Primeape, Dodrio, and Aurorus.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Firium Z lets Combusken OHKO Oricorio-E with Inferno Overdrive after Stealth Rock damage; furthermore, Inferno Overdrive has a high chance to OHKO Skuntank and Alolan Raichu and hits targets such as Mudsdale and Musharna that would otherwise force Combusken out for as much damage as possible, KOing both after Fire Blast and Stealth Rock. Fightinium Z is an alternative that allows Combusken to OHKO Regirock and Drampa with All-Out Pummeling, do greater damage to Pokemon such as Lanturn, and bypass Focus Blast's poor accuracy once. Leftovers is an option that allows Combusken to set up more Substitutes while staying out of range of priority users such as Gurdurr and Lycanroc more easily; however, this should only be run on sets featuring Substitute, as three attacks sets benefit more from the extra damage Z-Crystals offer. Life Orb is an option on teams not using Toxic Spikes if another Pokemon is holding a Z-Crystal, helping to make up for Combusken's average damage output, such as offering it a high chance to OHKO Regirock with Focus Blast. The chip damage makes Combusken have a harder time staying out of range of priority attacks such as Lycanroc's Accelerock, however.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Combusken should avoid taking too much chip damage from entry hazards and status where possible and should mainly be brought in via safe switches and aggressive double switches so it can stay out of range of priority attacks such as Gurdurr's Mach Punch and Lycanroc's Accelerock to reliably clean late-game. Combusken can also be used early- to mid-game to immediately pressure teams and take advantage of switches to counters such as Jellicent with appropriate double switches. If running Substitute, Combusken can use it to punish switches it forces against Pokemon such as Ferroseed, Cryogonal, Tangela, Alolan Sandslash, and Victreebel, although it must be careful when doing this against the latter two, as they can outspeed and either cripple or KO Combusken if they predict it to use Substitute. Against more offensive teams, Substitute can help ease prediction and make Combusken harder to revenge kill while helping it outspeed Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Dodrio and Primeape that it needs multiple Speed boosts for. Combusken should, however, be wary of setting up too many Substitutes when counters such as Carbink and Altaria are present, especially when running a Z-Crystal instead of Leftovers, so it has enough HP to take priority attacks or keep setting up Substitutes later in the match. If a teammate is running Toxic Spikes, Combusken can very effectively poison stall with Substitute + Protect, as Speed Boost allows it to nearly always set up Substitutes first. In particular, this allows Combusken to pressure Jellicent a lot more, forcing it to take poison damage while attempting to force Combusken out with Taunt.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Combusken fits on bulky offense and balance teams that desire a late-game cleaner and on Toxic Spikes teams where it can also function as a poison staller. Pivots such as Lanturn, Eelektross, and Silvally-Fairy can help bring Combusken in on Pokemon that it can force out such as Victreebel, Cryogonal, and Regirock, offering it free opportunities to gain Speed boosts, set Substitutes, or break the enemy team. Lanturn and Eelektross in particular can help pressure Jellicent, and Lanturn can also help to spread poison onto Pokemon that annoy Combusken such as Jellicent, Eelektross, and opposing Lanturn and clear Combusken of status with Heal Bell. Pokemon that can help deal with Jellicent in particular are incredibly useful, especially when you're not running it alongside Toxic Spikes. Victreebel can consistently switch into and pressure defensive Jellicent while switching into and helping break other Pokemon such as Gurdurr and Mudsdale that can force Combusken out when at high HP, as well as help break through Carbink and Clefairy, which can otherwise wall Combusken. Pokemon such as Choice Band Stoutland and Absol are capable of Pursuit trapping Jellicent and can help pressure the special walls that Combusken dislikes, such as Lanturn, Eelektross, and Musharna. Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Aurorus, Taunt Oricorio-E, Golurk, and Swords Dance Silvally-Fairy can also help to break through specially defensive Pokemon such as Altaria, Carbink, and Clefairy that can consistently wall Combusken, as well as break holes in the enemy team for Combusken to reliably clean late-game.</p> <p>Toxic Spikes support from Pokemon such as Qwilfish and Roselia can help Combusken break through opposing teams via stalling through the combination of Substitute + Protect, allowing it to more easily beat Pokemon such as Assault Vest Lanturn that would otherwise give it a lot of trouble. Roselia is able to consistently pressure Jellicent alongside setting Toxic Spikes, which is helpful in matchups against grounded Poison-types such as Victreebel or against entry hazard removers that Roselia loses to such as Cryogonal, while Qwilfish is able to provide a switch-in to priority users such as Hitmonchan and Gurdurr that could revenge kill Combusken, as well as to Choice Scarf Dodrio, which can outspeed Combusken after multiple Speed boosts. Spinblockers such as Jellicent and Sableye are excellent partners, especially on Toxic Spikes teams, to help deal with Rapid Spin users such as Alolan Sandslash, although they have to be wary of Toxic. Sableye can also offer Knock Off support to aid Combusken in poison stalling foes, while both Pokemon can help check Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan and Primeape and offer Taunt support to pressure entry hazard setters and removers.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sky Uppercut is Combusken's strongest Fighting-type STAB option versus lighter Pokemon such as Lanturn and Carbink. Low Kick is an alternative that can do more damage versus heavier Pokemon such as Regirock while still retaining the ability to break through Lanturn and Carbink alongside Fightinium Z.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Firium Z allows Combusken to OHKO Mudsdale and Choice Specs Jellicent with +2 Inferno Overdrive after Stealth Rock damage, deal heavy damage to Gurdurr, and avoid recoil once against high-HP targets such as Musharna to stay out of range of priority attacks. Alternatively, Fightinium Z allows Combusken to OHKO Fire-type checks such as Lanturn and Carbink, the latter after Stealth Rock, with +2 All-Out Pummeling; however, it does less damage versus targets such as Gurdurr and Mudsdale than Inferno Overdrive. Eviolite is an alternative option if another Pokemon is using a Z-Crystal, allowing Combusken to more easily take priority moves such as Gurdurr or Hitmonchan's Mach Punch, take an Earthquake from offensive Alolan Sandslash to risk setting up against it more freely without being KOed on a misprediction, and set up against Victreebel more easily. The lower damage output is very noticeable, however, allowing bulky Pokemon such as Mudsdale to force it out much more easily.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to Combusken's low bulk and tendency to get worn down by entry hazards and Flare Blitz recoil, it should prioritize being brought in safely so it has enough HP to set up when necessary and stay out of range of priority moves from Pokemon such as Gurdurr. Because of this, Combusken should also wait to set up until answers such as defensive Jellicent have been crippled or removed, as it will be unlikely to get multiple setup opportunities; however, if Combusken is unlikely to be able to reliably set up or revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Dodrio are present, it can be used to immediately pressure the opposing team when forcing switches. Combusken should prioritize attempting to set up against Pokemon that cannot threaten it if possible, such as Cryogonal, Audino, and Choice Band Absol locked into Pursuit. However, it can also attempt to set up on Pokemon it can force to switch out, such as Victreebel and Alolan Sandslash, though they are faster and can cripple or KO Combusken if they end up staying in. Combusken can also make use of the fact that its two sets have different checks and counters, allowing it to potentially set up a Swords Dance on a switch-in to its special set, such as Carbink or Lanturn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pivots such as Eelektross, Rotom-F, Lanturn, and Primeape are able to provide Combusken with safe switches into Pokemon such as Audino, Cryogonal, and Victreebel to get free setup opportunities. In particular, Eelektross can help pressure Jellicent and Mudsdale, while Rotom-F can also offer Defog support and help pressure Jellicent, Carracosta, and Qwilfish. Silvally-Fairy is another option that can run a Swords Dance set to pressure physically defensive Pokemon such as Gurdurr and Mudsdale or provide Defog support. Regirock and Torterra are good choices for Stealth Rock setters to pair with Combusken, as the former provides a good switch-in to Choice Scarf Dodrio, which can outspeed and revenge kill Combusken easily, while the latter can help pressure Mudsdale and Jellicent. In return, Torterra greatly appreciates Combusken switching into and pressuring Cryogonal. Victreebel is a particularly good partner for Swords Dance Combusken, as it is able to switch into and pressure several Combusken checks such as Mudsdale, Jellicent, Lanturn, and Gurdurr. In return, Combusken can help pressure Cryogonal. Musharna can provide wallbreaking support with Future Sight to pressure switch-ins to Combusken such as Gurdurr and Jellicent. It can also allow Combusken a second opportunity to sweep and provide it with a free switch in to set up with Swords Dance thanks to Healing Wish. In return, Combusken can help pressure Dark-types such as Skuntank and Alolan Persian. Pursuit trappers such as Choice Band Absol, Skuntank, and Stoutland can remove one of Combusken's best answers in Jellicent. Absol and Stoutland can also wear down opposing teams for Combusken to clean more easily late-game, especially their shared switch-ins with Combusken such as Gurdurr and Mudsdale.</p>"

  "Ludicolo": {
    "overview": "<p>Ludicolo is a fearsome sweeper in the PU metagame by virtue of its access to Swift Swim, which allows it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame under rain. Furthermore, a decent Special Attack stat in tandem with a good STAB combination and nearly unresisted coverage allows it to adequately pressure offensive and defensive teams alike, and a fairly decent defensive typing and good special bulk allow it to tank some hits and find easy opportunities to set up on Pokemon like Floatzel and Lanturn. Unfortunately, Ludicolo is hindered by its poor Defense and Speed stats, as they can complicate setup and leave it susceptible to common threats in Skuntank, Primeape, and Scyther. It also suffers from the prevalence of Pokemon that can tank a hit in the rain and cripple or KO it in return, including Roselia and Assault Vest Hitmonchan. Lastly, Ludicolo's physical frailty can leave it prone to getting revenge killed by strong priority users, including Absol, Alolan Raticate, and especially Kangaskhan, which can stall out rain turns with Fake Out.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Surf is an option for consistent and reliable damage over the less accurate Hydro Pump, though the loss in power is quite notable. Scald sacrifices power for better accuracy than Hydro Pump and a chance to burn that Surf doesn't have. However, given that Ludicolo looks to power through most foes, this often isn't a good option. Ludicolo can use Z-Crystals like Grassium Z and Icium Z to lure in and remove specific threats, but this cuts into the power its other attacks would have with a Life Orb, which is notably more valuable. Waterium Z is also a nice option due to its insane power in the rain, though it often isn't preferred for similar reasons. A Substitute + Leech Seed set can be used due to Ludicolo's decent defensive typing, though its poor physical bulk makes this hard to pull off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Various specially bulky Pokemon are capable of tanking Ludicolo's attacks easily due to its only decent Special Attack. Examples include Roselia and Type: Null.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers</strong>: Due to Ludicolo's poor bulk overall, it is heavily pressured by strong offensive Pokemon that it fails to KO, including Assault Vest Hitmonchan.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority</strong>: Strong priority attacks from Spiritomb and Skuntank can heavily dent Ludicolo and even revenge kill it after it's been whittled down some. Kangaskhan's priority attacks are particularly troublesome, as with Fake Out, it can damage Ludicolo while burning rain turns.</p> <p><strong>Abomasnow and Aurorus</strong>: By virtue of Snow Warning, Abomasnow and Aurorus can disrupt Ludicolo's rain. Abomasnow can tank any hit while pressuring Ludicolo with powerful STAB attacks, while Choice Scarf Aurorus can outspeed and OHKO Ludicolo with Freeze-Dry.</p>",

      "Rain Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rain Dance is mandatory for doubling Ludicolo's Speed and beginning a sweep, and it also supports some of Ludicolo's other teammates on dedicated rain teams. Hydro Pump is a powerful STAB attack that hits obscenely hard in the rain, OHKOing or 2HKOing the majority of neutral targets. Giga Drain allows Ludicolo to recover its health and is also useful for hitting Water-types such as Gastrodon and Lanturn. Energy Ball is an option over Giga Drain for its greater power, notably damaging the likes of Primeape and Swanna more reliably. Ice Beam hits the Grass- and Dragon-types that otherwise wall Ludicolo, including Lurantis, Victreebel, and Drampa. Focus Blast is an option over Rain Dance in order to hit Pokemon like Type: Null and Cradily harder, but it is unreliable and makes Ludicolo reliant on teammates to set up rain.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full investment in both Special Attack and Speed maximizes Ludicolo's offensive presence. 29 IVs are invested in HP to minimize damage taken from Life Orb. A Modest nature is used to maximize Ludicolo's damage output, but Timid is also an option to outspeed faster Choice Scarf users such as Manectric and Scyther. Life Orb puts even more power behind Ludicolo's attacks, allowing it to secure KOs such as the 2HKO on Lanturn with Giga Drain.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ludicolo should look to set up against Pokemon that can't adequately damage it, like Lanturn and Choice-locked Floatzel, or against Pokemon that it forces out, like Regirock and Gastrodon. It is also important to note that when not on a full rain team Ludicolo should be preserved for the late-game and rarely used early on, as it has an easier time sweeping once checks and counters are weakened. It can, however, be used as a late-game breaker if need be. If Ludicolo is up against a slower foe that is within range of a KO and isn't likely to switch out, it should usually just use an attack to revenge kill the opposing Pokemon so as not to take any damage. Lastly, Ludicolo should look for the opposing team to be generally weakened to begin its sweep, as while its good coverage lets it cover most of the metagame on its own, its middling power can compromise its sweeping chances.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>On dedicated rain teams, rain setters like Liepard and Volbeat are important teammates for Ludicolo. Both of them also have access to U-turn, which allows them to safely bring Ludicolo into play. Other pivots, such as Alolan Raichu and Primeape, can also safely bring Ludicolo into battle. Slow pivots like Lanturn and Probopass are particularly useful for minimizing its chances of taking damage. Other Swift Swim users, such as Kabutops and Poliwrath, can fit onto rain teams with Ludicolo and appreciate its ability to break past their common checks, like Gastrodon. Entry hazard support from the likes of Golurk and Mudsdale can aid Ludicolo in punishing its switches and breaking past foes more easily in general. Powerful physical attackers like Stoutland, Gurdurr, and Zangoose adequately pressure the specially defensive Pokemon that Ludicolo struggles to break past, like Assault Vest Hitmonchan and Type: Null, while in return it can pressure the physically defensive Pokemon they're troubled with themselves, like Regirock.</p>"

  "Masquerain": {
    "overview": "<p>Masquerain sports rare access to both Sticky Web and Quiver Dance, which gives it much better offensive presence than other Sticky Web leads such as Smeargle. Masquerain's solid coverage also allows it to threaten opposing entry hazard setters such as Mudsdale, as well as Pokemon such as Hitmonchan which give other Sticky Web leads a hard time. However, Masquerain still faces a lot of competition from other Sticky Web setters such as Leavanny and Smeargle due to Leavanny's better Speed and access to valuable support options in Knock Off and Magic Coat and Smeargle's access to more support options such as Spikes, Spore, and Stealth Rock. As a result of Masquerain's only decent Speed and offensive presence, it is very susceptible to Taunt from Pokemon such as Skuntank, which isn't a problem for the faster Leavanny because it outspeeds Skuntank. Masquerain also has a difficult time against Defoggers or Rapid Spin users like Swanna and Cryogonal that can get rid of Sticky Web with little to no issue. Masquerain's poor bulk and defensive typing don't grant it many opportunities to switch in, meaning that it can only work efficiently as a lead.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A more offensive set centered around Quiver Dance and making use of Buginium Z or Waterium Z can let Masquerain break through specially defensive foes such as Eelektross and Cryogonal, but it can struggle to find setup opportunities due to its mediocre bulk and its Speed tier leaves it easily revenge killed by fast Choice Scarf users, such as Primeape and Dodrio, even at +1 Speed, limiting its late-game cleaning potential. Roost seems appealing, but Masquerain has trouble finding room for it on either set and much prefers the coverage, and it has trouble recovering lost HP on strong attackers such as Kangaskhan and Stoutland. Scald can be used over Hydro Pump as its chance to burn can come in handily against switch-ins such as Skuntank and Alolan Sandslash, but it is notably weaker and leaves Masquerain more vulnerable to Pokemon like Regirock. Ice Beam can be used to hit Pokemon such as Drampa and Oricorio-G harder, though it has limited use outside of this.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt and Encore</strong>: Masquerain is incapable of doing much of anything should it be Taunted by Sableye or Skuntank, and none of its moves are particularly desirable to be locked into by Encore from Pokemon like Audino. Oricorio-E and Oricorio-G are especially problematic for Masquerain to face, as besides crippling Masquerain with Taunt, they take little damage from most of its moves and can even copy Quiver Dance boosts due to their ability in Dancer.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removal</strong>: Common Defoggers such as Swanna, Cryogonal, and Altaria are annoying for Masquerain to deal with, as Masquerain cannot OHKO them depending on its coverage, and they don't have issues either KOing it or stalling it out with Toxic and then Defogging. Although the matchup is tougher for them, spinners such as Alolan Sandslash and Kabutops can be annoying for Masquerain to deal with as well, as they have the ability to threaten Masquerain with their super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Aurorus, Regirock, and Lycanroc can all KO Masquerain with their respective STAB attacks, even with an Attack drop from Intimidate. Lycanroc can even revenge kill Masquerain after a Quiver Dance with Accelerock, while Aurorus can OHKO Masquerain through its Focus Sash due to Snow Warning. It's worth noting that none of them appreciate taking a +1 Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Combusken and Simisear have no issues KOing Masquerain with Fire Blast, even if it has +1 Special Defense. Similarly to Rock-types, however, none of them want to take a +1 Hydro Pump.</p>",

      "Sticky Web Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sticky Web, the main reason to use Masquerain, decreases the Speed of all opposing Pokemon upon entry, which is good for supporting Masquerain's teammates. Bug Buzz is Masquerain's main and most powerful STAB move, and it hits Dark-, Grass-, and Psychic-types like Absol, Torterra, and Musharna for super effective damage. Hydro Pump gives Masquerain the ability to threaten not only common users of Stealth Rock such as Mudsdale and Regirock but also Pokemon like Simisear, while Air Slash gives it a secondary STAB option for hitting Fighting-types harder than any of its other moves. Finally, Quiver Dance slightly increases Masquerain's offensive presence and makes it less susceptible to Taunt.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in both Speed and Special Attack serves to maximize Masquerain's offensive presence. A Timid nature allows Masquerain to outspeed Pokemon such as neutral-natured Shiftry and Skuntank and gives it an easier time attempting to set up Sticky Web. Focus Sash always allows Masquerain to take one attack from full, which means that Masquerain will almost always successfully set Sticky Web at least once. Intimidate can help Masquerain set up Sticky Web or Quiver Dance against targets like Gurdurr later on should it need to switch out.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Leading with Masquerain is almost always ideal due to this giving it the best possible chance it can get to set Sticky Web up as soon as possible. Using Quiver Dance afterwards is smart, as this gives it a slightly better matchup against Defoggers, prevents it from becoming setup fodder, and makes it more likely that Sticky Web will remain up. If Masquerain cannot beat a certain Defogger like Swanna, preserving it until the Defogger is removed is ideal, as Masquerain's main priority is setting up Sticky Web and they will render its attempts pointless. This can be difficult, however, due to its poor bulk and 4x weakness to Stealth Rock. Masquerain has to play carefully around Taunt users such as Sableye, as they can prevent it from doing much of anything outside of firing off weak attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Masquerain only fits on dedicated Sticky Web teams, so slower setup sweepers and wallbreakers that can take advantage of their grounded checks being slowed down such as Carracosta, Turtonator, and Zangoose make for good partners. Spinblockers such as Golurk and Oricorio-G prevent the removal of Sticky Web via Rapid Spin. They both also have the advantage of pressuring Defoggers with their strong STAB attacks, and Golurk can even provide Stealth Rock support to weaken the Flying-types that aren't affected by Sticky Web. Haunter can be considered too, as it can prevent Defog with Taunt and possibly take out annoyances with Destiny Bond if need be; however, it is more frail than the two previously mentioned Ghost-types and has a harder time against Skuntank. Pawniard and Primeape make for great teammates due to them both being able to deter and punish the use of Defog because of their shared ability in Defiant. They both also check Skuntank, a major annoyance for Masquerain. Checks to Flying-types like Swanna are important, as they are immune to Sticky Web and can usually remove Sticky Web with ease. Alolan Raichu fits this role perfectly, and it appreciates Sticky Web giving it an easier time cleaning up opposing teams.</p>"

With Tectonic Rage, Ninjask is able to overpower foes such as Regirock and Aggron. These traits give Ninjask a decent amount of staying power against offensive and balanced builds. However, Ninjask's offensive presence only goes so far because its mediocre bulk, nasty 4x Stealth Rock weakness, and five common weaknesses to Fire-, Flying-, Ice-, Rock-, and Electric-type attacks mean it is revenge killed rather easily. Furthermore, Ninjask is often an inconsistent revenge killer due to its mediocre Attack stat, and it is left vulnerable to strong priority users such as Lycanroc, Kangaskhan, Abomasnow, and Absol. Ninjask's rather average Attack stat also means that it struggles to break Pokemon such as Mudsdale and Regirock, which are able to sponge Ninjask's unboosted attacks and deal good damage in return.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Band can be used with U-turn for maximum damage output and momentum, though Ninjask can't really take advantage of this effectively because of its 4x weakness to Stealth Rock.

Adamant can also be used for more damage output, but loses out on outspeeding foes such as Choice Scarf Kabutops, as well as the aforementioned Omastar and Alolan Sandslash. Speed Boost is the preferred ability, which allows Ninjask at +1 to outspeed fast Choice Scarf users such as Primeape. Groundium Z allows Ninjask to use Tectonic Rage to break through common checks like Aggron, but once again it should be used wisely.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When facing offensive teams, Ninjask should usually be utilized early-game or mid-game to revenge kill faster foes such as Alolan Raichu and Jynx. Make sure that Stealth Rock is off the field, as it really hampers Ninjask's longevity. If Ninjask is playing against bulkier teams, it should be used as a late-game sweeper because it functions a lot better once the opposing team is sufficiently weakened. Likewise, Ninjask should avoid setting up if bulky Pokemon such as Mudsdale and Regirock are not weakened, since it struggles to break through them even after a +2 Attack boost. Be aware that Tectonic Rage is required to secure OHKOs on bulky threats such as Aggron, so Ninjask should use its Z-Move cautiously, as wasting it will make breaking through bulkier teams harder. Lastly, Ninjask does not have the best bulk or typing to set up safely, but setting up on Fighting-types such as Gurdurr or Primeape locked into Close Combat is usually the best opportunity because they are forced out by Aerial Ace.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal is absolutely mandatory for Ninjask because it is 4x weak to Stealth Rock, so Pokemon such as Hitmonchan and Skuntank make for good partners. Hitmonchan is also able to check Pokemon like Abomasnow, which Ninjask struggles with otherwise. Ninjask appreciates entry hazard setters that are able to weaken opposing teams to the point it can break through grounded foes such as Regirock with Tectonic Rage more easily, making Pokemon with access to Spikes like Ferroseed and Qwilfish ideal partners. Offensively, Ninjask partners well with special attackers such as Aurorus and Drampa that can whittle down checks and counters like Eelektross. On the other hand, defensive Pokemon such as Regirock and Tangela can check strong priority users such as Kangaskhan and Lycanroc. Pursuit trappers like Skuntank and Absol are able to pressure bulkier Ghost-types like Sableye for Ninjask, letting it clean easier. Lastly, Pokemon with access to Volt Switch such as Eelektross can get Ninjask onto the field safely. Eelektross is especially good because it has a slow Volt Switch and is good at pressuring some of Ninjask's checks such as Mudsdale.</p>"

However, being stuck with only 1 HP nullifies any sort of defensive utility Shedinja could have for itself and makes it instantly fall to the ubiquitous users of entry hazards, Toxic and Will-O-Wisp, Leech Seed, and Snow Warning. Wonder Guard also does nothing against common attacking types such as Rock, Flying, and Dark, as well as Pursuit from the likes of Skuntank and Stoutland. All of this means Shedinja requires strenuous team support to function, which ultimately makes it a liability for most teams. Furthermore, Shedinja faces severe competition with Scyther as a setup sweeper, which has superior stats across the board, reliable recovery, and the ability to pivot with U-turn.</p>",
    "sets": {"Swords Dance": {"description": "<p>Shedinja can utilize its access to Swords Dance and STAB priority Shadow Sneak to attempt the role of a Swords Dance sweeper. Unfortunately, Shedinja's mediocre Attack stat and low-Base Power moves force it to accumulate multiple Swords Dance boosts to pose any serious threat offensively. Its overreliance on Shadow Sneak to hit most foes in tandem with its several exploitable weaknesses often forces Shedinja to switch out, further diminishing its already limited role as a Swords Dance user. The nature and IVs are chosen to minimize the bulk of Ditto transformed into Shedinja, since they have no effect on Shedinja's bulk.</p>"}},

Because of its bad stats, little movepool, and mediocre ability, Delcatty is simply outclassed by Normal-types like Kangaskhan.</p>"}},

  "Sableye": {
    "overview": "<p>Sableye is a well-rounded defensive Pokemon in the PU metagame thanks to its good typing, solid utility, and access to Prankster. Sableye's Ghost / Dark typing not only gives it good immunities to a lot of moves while leaving it only weak to Fairy but also makes it a capable spinblocker. Prankster gives Sableye's status moves priority, which is a nuisance for the majority of the tier, as priority Taunt and Will-O-Wisp can really mess with a lot of Pokemon that want to set up, heal, or simply attack. Access to priority Recover also makes Sableye a durable and consistent wall. Unfortunately, poor base stats make Sableye fairly vulnerable to strong wallbreakers. It also means Sableye is reliant on Will-O-Wisp to check a lot of physical threats, even with physical bulk investment. Additionally, status moves affected by Prankster have no effect on opposing Dark-type Pokemon, so they usually can switch into Sableye freely and pressure it out. Finally, Sableye is vulnerable to strong special attackers especially when uninvested, which means it does still require some support to function effectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sableye can run a Calm Mind set with Recover, Dark Pulse, and Will-O-Wisp or Taunt, making it a threatening sweeper. Sableye can run a specially defensive set, which can check certain special attackers like Lanturn, Swanna, Oricorio-G, and Alolan Raichu, although this set isn't so much about walling these kinds of threats as much as it's about being harder to take down both physically (because of Will-O-Wisp) and specially.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Sableye's special bulk is rather low, so powerful special attackers like Aurorus, Drampa, and Victreebel can 2HKO or even OHKO it with ease.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon like Combusken, Turtonator, and Simisear can often pivot into a predicted Will-O-Wisp and threaten Sableye out with powerful STAB attacks or threaten to set up on it, forcing Sableye to risk staying in to Taunt a potential setup move user.</p> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon</strong>: Dark-type Pokemon like Absol, Shiftry, and Skuntank can all switch in on any of Sableye's moves, since they are immune to Prankster, and therefore can threaten to set up on it or KO it with a powerful attack. Calm Mind variants of Spiritomb also use Sableye as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon</strong>: Clefairy and Shiinotic can come in relatively safely and consistently on Sableye thanks to their access to reliable recovery and can threaten it out with a STAB attack, although Clefairy must be wary of losing its Eviolite. Mr. Mime and Silvally-Fairy can threaten Sableye offensively, but the former doesn't usually like getting its item removed, while the latter usually doesn't appreciate a burn.</p>",

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Taunt prevents opposing Pokemon from setting up, healing, or using status moves such as Toxic on Sableye. Will-O-Wisp burns and cripples most physical attackers and discourages them from switching in. It also wears down Pokemon in general. Recover lets Sableye stay healthy throughout the match. Knock Off is a solid STAB move, and it gets rid of foes' items. Foul Play can be used as an alternative to help versus offensive Pokemon and Dark-types in general, which Knock Off would otherwise do little to. More importantly, it prevents Sableye from being set up on by Pokemon such as Lycanroc, Absol, and Carracosta. Night Shade sacrifices a way to hit Normal-types, but deals the most damage to Skuntank, Gurdurr, Clefairy, and Combusken. It also 2HKOes Rotom-F after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Prankster gives Sableye's status moves priority. Leftovers gives Sableye even more passive recovery each turn, which can also help its longevity. Rocky Helmet punishes contact moves, notably letting it beat physical Skuntank one-on-one and getting extra chip damage on Pokemon like Primeape, Kangaskhan, and Scyther. If running Foul Play or Night Shade, Bold is the preferred nature to minimize opposing Foul Play damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Sableye can be relied upon to deal with physical attackers like Pinsir, Golurk, and Primeape, as well as other Pokemon that do not threaten it very much. Sableye can also be used to block Rapid Spin against opponents like Hitmonchan, Alolan Sandslash, and Claydol, although all of these sometimes carry Toxic, so be wary. Use Taunt when the foe wants to set up, heal, or potentially inflict status, but be cautious of using Taunt if Sableye is in a vulnerable position to be KOed by the opposing Pokemon. Use Will-O-Wisp to burn and cripple opposing threats, but be careful of using it without thinking if the opponent has a Pokemon that is immune to it, because you risk losing momentum otherwise. Knock Off is a spammable move and therefore should be used often early-game if Sableye is healthy. Avoid staying in on strong special attackers or wallbreakers, as Sableye can get overwhelmed by them easily. Due to Dark types' immunity to moves affected by Prankster, be wary of Pokemon like Shiftry, Skuntank, and Alolan Raticate, as they can often switch in with no drawbacks outside of losing an item. Running Foul Play or Night Shade can mitigate those match-ups to varying degrees, however. Sableye gets worn down easily with burns and especially Toxic, so keeping it healthy and status free can increase its longevity and effectiveness.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Answers to special attackers like Aurorus and Lanturn are appreciated for Sableye, as they often don't mind a burn and can hit back hard. Reliable answers like Clefairy, Type: Null, and Audino are some of the best partners for Sableye when it comes to checking these threats. Sableye also requires answers to Fairy-types such as Clefairy and Silvally-Fairy, which can hit it super effectively. Pokemon like Metang can switch into and check most of them by threatening them out with a STAB move or crippling them with status. Answers to opposing Dark-types are very important because they often use Sableye as setup fodder. Hence, some good teammates would include the previously mentioned Fairy-types in Silvally-Fairy and Clefairy, as well as bulky Fighting-types, like Hitmonchan and Throh, which can switch into most Dark-types and threaten them out with a STAB move. Partners that can help Sableye check powerful Normal-types, especially those with Scrappy such as Stoutland and Kangaskhan, are helpful, as they can utilize a boosted Facade to break through Sableye. Regirock, Tangela, and Mawile do a good job of providing support by being able to switch into them. Sableye fits well on balanced teams with bulky teammates and on teams that need a Fighting-type immunity. Sableye can also fit on teams as a spinblocker, since it is able to beat most spinners like Hitmonchan, Alolan Sandslash, and Kabutops. Finally, Sableye can be worn down by hazards and especially does not like Toxic Spikes, so hazard control from Pokemon like Altaria, Skuntank, and Lurantis is appreciated. Sableye also appreciates cleric support, so Pokemon like Granbull and Audino are good partners.</p>"

  "Mawile": {
    "overview": "<p>Mawile is an overall average Pokemon that is able to serve as a wallbreaker or a physical wall. This versatility is thanks to its nice movepool, with decent offensive and utility moves such as Play Rough, Iron Head, and Stealth Rock, and two great abilities in Sheer Force and Intimidate. Furthermore, Mawile has a great offensive and defensive typing that offers good STAB coverage and a useful resistance to Stealth Rock and an immunity to Toxic Spikes. When serving as a wallbreaker, Mawile can break through many slower foes such as Drampa and Clefairy, and even certain faster ones such as Alolan Raichu thanks to Sucker Punch. As a physical wall, Mawile can take hits from many physical Normal-, Dark-, and Grass-types, including Stoutland and the physical variants of Skuntank, Spiritomb, and Shiftry, and either cripple them with Toxic or Knock Off or use the opportunity to set up Stealth Rock. Sadly, Mawile's stats are a large setback; though it has somewhat respectable Attack and Defense stats, Mawile is pretty slow and specially frail, making it relatively easy to KO for many offensive foes. These downsides furthermore leave it with a lot of competition in both of its potential roles, with other wallbreakers either offering a higher damage output and bulk, such as Aggron, or superior Speed, such as Skuntank and Stoutland, allowing them to threaten a larger number of Pokemon. Similarly, other physical walls such as Regirock and Metang can accomplish many of the same things Mawile can defensively, and even bring their own unique aspects in Regirockâ€™s higher natural bulk and Metangâ€™s access to Earthquake to punish switchins; both also have noticeably higher special bulk.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mawile can be used as a Swords Dance sweeper, but its opportunities to set up can be hard to find due to its frailness. Swords Dance furthermore forces Mawile to replace Fire Blast, which leaves Mawile susceptible to being walled by Steel-types. It can also take out Sucker Punch, but losing out on priority makes it even easier to revenge kill. Rock Slide is a coverage option that hits incoming Fire-types like Simisear, but can only be used on a predicted switch, and again at the loss of Fire Blast or Sucker Punch. Similarly, Thunder Punch can 2HKO Qwilfish and Jellicent, but is generally not worth giving up a move for as it does not hit much else. Mawile's defensive set can run Pain Split for a somewhat reliable form of recovery, but struggles to free a moveslot. With 176 Special Attack EVs, Mawile can serve as a decent lure for physical walls due to its great special movepool. This includes moves such as Grass Knot for Mudsdale and Focus Blast for Aggron and Probopass, but they are generally useless moves otherwise and only hinder Mawile due the loss in Attack EVs. Finally, Mawile can be used with minimum Speed on Trick Room teams as a decent mixed attacker, and although it is weak compared to other Trick Room attackers, it has the advantage of not having a weakness to any form of priority.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Combusken, Turtonator, and Simisear resist both of Mawile's STAB moves and easily OHKO with Fire Blast, but they don't appreciate switching into Play Rough. They are even KOed when Play Rough is combined with damage from Stealth Rock and Sucker Punch. Combusken outspeeds Mawile and resists Sucker Punch, but is OHKOed by Play Rough, and while Turtonator can take a Play Rough, it cannot switch into one. However, both OHKO Mawile with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to the offensive set's frailness and low Speed, Mawile is very easy to revenge kill, so it largely fears Pokemon that outspeed it. This includes Pokemon such as Jellicent and Simisear, with the defensive set being especially vulnerable due to a lack of Sucker Punch. Additionally, while the offensive set can use Sucker Punch to alleviate this weakness, Mawile has to be careful of Pokemon using status or priority moves to take advantage, such as Substitute Jynx and Aqua Jet Carracosta.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Mudsdale, and Torterra can take a hit from Mawile before easily OHKOing it with their respective STAB moves. Faster Ground-types such as Golurk and Alolan Dugtrio fear Sucker Punch, but can take one before similarly OHKOing Mawile, or just use it as an opportunity to set up Stealth Rock or a Substitute, respectively. However, none of these Pokemon, barring Alolan Dugtrio, are immune to Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Aggron, Probopass, and Bronzor take little from Mawile's attacks and are immune to Toxic; their biggest fear is Super Fang from defensive Mawile, but they can simply KO Mawile or use the move as an opportunity to set up Stealth Rock. However, certain Steel-types, namely Alolan Sandslash and Ferroseed, do not like having to take a Fire Blast from offensive Mawile. Ferroseed, Metang and Bronzor are also threatened by Knock Off, as they lose a substantial amount of bulk when they do not have an Eviolite.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls such as Jellicent and Qwilfish switch into Mawile's attacks with relative ease and can cripple it with Scald, Will-O-Wisp, and Taunt. Other defensive walls such as Tangela can also accomplish this, but fear Fire Blast from the offensive set. Qwilfish is also the only Pokemon of these that does not have to be careful of Toxic from the defensive set.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Play Rough serves as Mawileâ€™s main STAB move and hits Fighting-, Dragon-, and Dark-types such as Gurdurr, Drampa, and Spiritomb for super effective damage. Iron Head gives Mawile a secondary STAB move that hits some bulky foes such as Regirock and Clefairy super effectively and certain Fairy-resistant Pokemon like Victreebel neutrally. Sucker Punch somewhat makes up for Mawileâ€™s low Speed by allowing it to hit faster foes such as Alolan Raichu and Choice Specs Jellicent. Fire Blast hits Steel-types like Alolan Sandslash and Ferroseed super effectively, in addition to nailing Tangela.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sheer Force boosts Mawileâ€™s moves bar Sucker Punch and stacks with Life Orb while negating its recoil. This, combined with 252 EVs in Attack and a Naughty nature, allows Mawile to hit as hard as possible. A Naughty nature is preferred so that Fire Blast can still deal a decent amount of damage. 252 Speed EVs allow Mawile to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible, giving it more offensive presence. A Naive nature can be run to outspeed certain Pokemon such as Adamant Golurk and Aggron, but Mawile prefers extra power to allow it to wallbreak more easily.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to its decent Attack stat, Life Orb, and Sheer Force, Mawile is best utilized to break down bulkier Pokemon like Gurdurr and Ferroseed. Mawile should very rarely be switched in to take an attack, as even resisted moves such as Stoutlandâ€™s Return and Oricorio-Eâ€™s Hurricane still do a lot of damage. Exceptions are switching into attacks that it is immune to, such as Dragon- and Poison-type attacks, but even then, users of those moves often carry coverage that can dent Mawile. Your best bet is to predict or bait a switch into something like Regirock or Clefairy before doubling into Mawile. It can also switch into a potential Toxic from foes such as Audino or while the foe is recovering, such as Clefairy using Soft-Boiled. Alternate options are to bring it in through a slow pivot, such as Lanturn's Volt Switch, or after a teammate is KOed. Lanturn can also be used to lure in specially defensive walls like Ferroseed before using Volt Switch to bring in Mawile for a KO. When facing fast Pokemon, Mawile should usually go for Sucker Punch. However, be aware that certain Pokemon could use this as an opportunity to set up, such as Oricorio-G using Substitute or Calm Mind.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mawile can break down bulkier foes such as Regirock and Mudsdale, allowing late-game sweepers such as Lycanroc and Scyther to come in and clean up. Special attackers such as Aurorus and Drampa can help deal with physical walls that give Mawile trouble, while Mawile can help break down special walls. Special attackers also lure in said special walls, which Mawile can double in on. Slow pivots such as Eelektross and Lanturn can take a hit before getting Mawile onto the field safely, supplying decent chip damage in the process. Water- and Grass-types such as Jellicent, Ludicolo and Torterra can help with the Ground-types that threaten Mawile such as Golurk and Mudsdale, and Mawile can pressure the defensive Pokemon they struggle with in return, such as Ferroseed and Tangela. Hazard setters such as Qwilfish and Regirock can help weaken foes through residual damage, making them easier for Mawile to break through. While Mawile appreciates hazards, it's also prone to being worn down by Spikes itself and is unable to threaten Qwilfish, making Pokemon that can compensate for this weakness like Cryogonal and Rotom-F desirable.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock limits your opponent's ability to switch, as it deals a good amount of chip damage every time one of their Pokemon enters the field. Play Rough gives Mawile a reliable STAB move, most notably against Dark- and Fighting-types such as Spiritomb, Alolan Raticate, and Hitmonchan. Super Fang is Mawile's other form of offensive pressure, as it takes away half of the target's current health; this helps it break down bulkier foes that don't mind Play Rough such as Regirock, Mudsdale, and especially those with reliable recovery, such as Musharna. Super Fang also hits Poison- and Steel-types such as Roselia and Aggron, which resist Play Rough and are immune to Toxic. Toxic is used to whittle down bulkier foes and can be stacked with Super Fang. Knock Off is an option over Toxic that helps Mawile cripple Eviolite holders like Roselia and Ferroseed, as well as Choice item users like Camerupt and Stoutland.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in HP and Defense, along with an Impish nature, allow Mawile to best take physical attacks from Dark-, Grass-, and Normal-type attackers such as physical Skuntank, Leafeon, and Stoutland. Intimidate lets Mawile more easily switch in to take those physical attacks by lowering Attack stats. Leftovers gives Mawile constant recovery, making it harder to break through or wear down, and is Mawile's only form of recovery. Rocky Helmet is an alternate choice that whittles down contact move users such as Skuntank and Stoutland and is especially helpful against U-turn users such as Primeape and Liepard. Unfortunately, Rocky Helmet makes Mawile easier to wear down due to the lack of residual recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mawile is best used when switching in to take hits from Dark-types like physical Skuntank and Absol, Grass-types like physical Shiftry and Leafeon, and Normal-types like Stoutland and Alolan Raticate. Most of these Pokemon do very little to Mawile, so will often switch out on the next turn. Mawile can use this turn to set up Stealth Rock, use Toxic on the incoming foe, or make a double switch into a better matchup. However, be wary of coverage on physical attackers, such as mixed Skuntank's Fire Blast and Silvally-Fairy's Flamethrower, which will threaten to 2HKO Mawile. Mawile can also take advantage of Intimidate by activating it and pivoting into a teammate that appreciates it. However, be wary of Defiant users like Primeape, which just gains an Attack boost when hit by Intimidate. When the foe is at high health, Super Fang will often do more than Play Rough, especially against bulkier foes, so it is usually the better choice of attack. However, when the foe reaches lower health, Super Fang will be weaker, making Play Rough the better option. Mawile isn't the best switch-in to Fighting-types, especially wallbreakers such as Primeape and Gurdurr, due to its Steel typing. Mawile furthermore doesn't have a very good matchup against Psychic-types due to its terrible Special Defense stat allowing Pokemon such as Musharna to 2HKO it with Future Sight.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mawile can form a nice defensive core with specially defensive Pokemon such as Audino and Clefairy, as they can help with many special attackers that give Mawile trouble such as Jellicent and Lanturn, while Mawile can help with the physical attackers that break through them without trouble such as Stoutland and Alolan Raticate. Certain Water-types such as Jellicent and Lanturn can handle Fire-types such as Combusken and Simisear, while Mawile helps against Grass-types such as physical Shiftry and Leafeon. Water-types can also help with Steel-types such as Aggron and Probopass, as can Fighting- and Fire-types such as Gurdurr and Simisear. Similarly, checks to Ground-types such as Torterra and Eelektross can help against the likes of Mudsdale and Alolan Dugtrio. Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Oricorio-G, Alolan Raichu, and Haunter appreciate Mawile's ability to deal with Dark-types, which can allow them to more easily set up late-game. Due to Mawileâ€™s lack of reliable recovery, it appreciates teammates that can provide healing, such as the previously mentioned Audino with Wish and Musharna with Healing Wish, especially if Mawile's item of choice is Rocky Helmet.</p>"

  "Aggron": {
    "overview": "<p>Aggron solidifies itself as one of the best wallbreakers in PU thanks to its great offensive typing, decent Attack stat, and access to the coveted combination of Rock Head and Head Smash. Rock Head negating the recoil from Head Smash gives Aggron a spammable STAB move that, when coupled with Choice Band, can break through most physical walls in PU, such as Qwilfish and Regirock. Due to its weight, Aggron also boasts a high-Base Power Heavy Slam against most Pokemon, hitting Fighting-types like Gurdurr, which resist its primary STAB move. Aggron also has access to several coverage moves such as Aqua Tail, Earthquake, and Superpower that allow it to break through Pokemon that would normally wall it like Mudsdale and opposing Aggron. However, Aggron struggles against more offensive teams due to a middling Speed stat and an offensive typing that gives it 4x weaknesses to Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, both of which are common coverage options. Even though Aggron can use its Rock / Steel typing effectively offensively, it's a poor typing defensively; this, coupled with a low Special Defense stat, makes it difficult for Aggron to directly switch in or take attacks from faster foes, even against resisted special attacks. Along with being a wallbreaker, Aggron can also function as an offensive Stealth Rock setter, as it's one of the few setters with access to Taunt; however, even though Aggron is a decent offensive Stealth Rock setter, it faces stiff competition from Lycanroc and Golurk, both of which have other useful attributes, with Lycanroc being much faster and having priority and Golurk acting as a spinblocker and faring better versus Fighting-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Magnet Rise can be used to lure and wall Mudsdale, but will not be able to easily break through it without using an additional moveslot on Toxic. Solar Beam can be used as a fourth move on Offensive Stealth Rock Aggron in conjunction with Grassium Z and a Naughty or Naive nature to lure Mudsdale and Gastrodon. Aggron can use alternative items like Life Orb and Stone Plate, but both lack the power that Choice Band offers. Aggron's access to Rock Polish can allow it to function as a late-game sweeper; however, its 4x weakness to priority Mach Punch and mediocre Speed, even at +2, prevents it from sweeping effectively. Fire Punch targets Bronzor and Ferroseed, which resist Aggron's STAB combination, but is otherwise not worth it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Poliwrath can switch into Aggron freely and threaten it with its STAB moves. Offensive Water-types such as special Floatzel and Swanna cannot switch in but are able to revenge kill Aggron instead.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Mudsdale is not 2HKOed by Aggron's Choice Band Head Smash after Leftovers recovery, and it can OHKO Aggron in return with Earthquake. Physically defensive Gastrodon and Torterra can easily tank any attack from the Choice Band set and KO Aggron with Scald or Earthquake. Golurk can oustpeed Aggron and OHKO it with Earthquake; however, it must be wary of Aqua Tail.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: While Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan, Primeape, and Gurdurr cannot freely switch into a Choice Band Heavy Slam, all three OHKO Aggron with their STAB moves. Chople Berry variants of Stealth Rock Aggron can take a hit from the former two and deal massive damage in retaliation, however.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Aggron's exploitable weaknesses, relatively low Special Defense, and lack of reliable recovery make it susceptible to faster attackers. Victreebel, Absol, and Alolan Raichu can all outspeed and potentially OHKO Aggron.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Although the Choice Band set carries Earthquake or Superpower, Aggron can still struggle against Steel-types such as Metang. Opposing Aggron can switch into Head Smash and Heavy Slam and retaliate with its own coverage. Probopass traps Choice Band Aggron not locked into Earthquake or Superpower, along with trapping the offensive Stealth Rock set, and OHKOes it with Earth Power. Bronzor resists Aggron's STAB combination and can slowly whittle Aggron with Psywave, though it has to be wary of Taunt.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Head Smash is Aggron's most spammable move, capable of breaking physically defensive walls like Regirock and Tangela. Heavy Slam hits Fighting-types that resist Aggron's main STAB move for strong neutral damage, such as Gurdurr, and is also 100% accurate. Aqua Tail allows Aggron to do a good chunk to Mudsdale, who otherwise takes little from Aggron's STAB moves. Earthquake is primarily used for hitting Steel-types such as Metang, opposing Aggron, and Probopass super effectively and also providing neutral damage against foes like Poliwrath. It also grants a reliable hit on foes such as Qwilfish and Lanturn. Superpower hits Regirock, Alolan Sandslash, and neutral targets such as Gastrodon harder at the cost of Attack and Defense drops. It also misses out on Qwilfish. Toxic is an option for a fourth move that allows Aggron to cripple Torterra and physically defensive Gastrodon, who otherwise wall Aggron.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature offers a notable power boost and can still outspeed Pokemon like Roselia and Tangela, but a Jolly nature may be used to outspeed Modest Aurorus and Modest Omastar. Rock Head allows Aggron to use Head Smash without taking recoil damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Aggron is primarily used as an early-game wallbreaker to soften foes up for its teammates with its strong STAB Head Smash, breaking through defensive walls like Qwilfish and Regirock. Aggron should be brought in on weaker physical attackers, such as Skuntank and Scyther, or more passive Pokemon like Clefairy and Type: Null; alternatively, a teammate's slow U-turn or Volt Switch is also a reliable way for getting Aggron in without it taking unneeded damage. Against certain teams, Aggron should avoid spamming Head Smash, as bulky Rock-resistant Pokemon, such as Mudsdale and Poliwrath, can switch in freely against it and force it out. This also means that Aggron is forced into mind games when picking between STAB or coverage moves versus foes such as Metang and opposing Aggron, as the opponent could either stay in or switch to a Pokemon that resists the appropriate coverage move. Along with being careful against teams with bulky Pokemon that resist its STAB attacks, Aggron should also be wary of locking itself into a move, especially a weaker coverage move, as it can then be used as setup bait. Aggron should also not be played as a Normal- or Flying-resistant Pokemon, as it loses to coverage moves that foes like Kangaskhan and Dodrio commonly carry.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Aggron fits well on balance and bulky offense teams, which provide frequent switch safe switch-ins and appreciate the pressure Aggron puts on opposing walls. Aggron can 2HKO Tangela and Qwilfish, allowing physical sweepers such as Primeape and Lycanroc to clean late-game. Aggron is worn down quickly and has several common weaknesses; thus, it appreciates slow VoltTurn support to safely switch in. Eelektross can provide a slow Volt Switch and threatens Pokemon that commonly wall Aggron, such as physically defensive Gastrodon, with Giga Drain. Choice Specs Jellicent can help Aggron by pressuring Ground-types such as Mudsdale and Torterra with Hydro Pump and Ice Beam, while also providing an immunity to Fighting-type attacks, with Aggron in return pressuring specially defensive Pokemon such as Audino and Pursuit trappers such as Skuntank. Specially bulky Pokemon such as Roselia and Type: Null support Aggron by pivoting into strong special attackers like Ludicolo and Victreebel, with the former also providing Spikes support. Aggron complements both Roselia and Type: Null by breaking common checks such as defensive Alolan Sandslash and Qwilfish.</p>"

      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Head Smash allows Aggron to exert offensive pressure and potentially force a switch against more passive foes like Audino and Type: Null, giving Aggron a free turn to set up Stealth Rock. Heavy Slam provides Aggron with a way of hitting Fighting-types that resist its Rock-type STAB move. Taunt prevents slower Pokemon such as Regirock and Ferroseed from setting up entry hazards, although Toxic is an alternative which gives Aggron a way to cripple physically defensive Pokemon that otherwise wall it, such as Torterra.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Aggron can run a Jolly nature to outspeed Modest Aurorus and opposing Aggron; however, the decrease in damage compared to Adamant is noticeable. Rock Head means Aggron can use Head Smash without taking recoil damage. Shuca Berry helps Aggron fare better versus faster threats wielding Earthquake, such as Kangaskhan, while a Chople Berry allows Aggron to survive Fighting-type attacks from Primeape and Hitmonchan. Aggron can also make use of either Rockium Z or Steelium Z to power up Head Smash and Heavy Slam, respectively, as well as increase their reliability once. Lum Berry is another alternative to allow Aggron to set up Stealth Rock without fear of being burned by Pokemon such as Sableye.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Aggron often functions as a lead versus more offensive teams where its role will be limited to setting up Stealth Rock, as it has trouble doing much outside of that against them. Against more balance-oriented teams, Aggron can still find ample opportunity to wallbreak once it has set up Stealth Rock, and Taunt shuts down stall teams. Aggron can also freely switch into weaker physical attackers, such as Skuntank and Type: Null, and more passive Pokemon, such as Clefairy and Altaria, to either set up Stealth Rock or force them out with a combination of Taunt plus its STAB moves. Even though Aggron can use its extremely powerful Head Smash to break down teams, it shouldn't be prioritized over setting Stealth Rock; its primary focus is to set Stealth Rock early-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Oricorio-G and Haunter pair well with Aggron, as they offer immunities to Ground- and Fighting-type attacks and appreciate the offensive pressure Aggron offers, with both Oricorio-G and Haunter benefiting from its ability to wallbreak. Aggron also checks physical Skuntank, which immensely threatens both Oricorio-G and Haunter with a combination of Sucker Punch and Pursuit. Fighting-types like Gurdurr and Primeape appreciate Aggron wearing down Musharna and Qwilfish, enabling them to either sweep or clean late-game. Eelektross provides a slow Volt Switch on top of threatening Pokemon that commonly wall Aggron, such as Mudsdale and Poliwrath, with either Giga Drain or Thunderbolt. In return, Aggron breaks through specially defensive walls such as Roselia and Audino.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Manectric acts as a niche revenge killer for more offensively inclined teams by providing momentum with Volt Switch and being relatively fast. It has access to Lightning Rod, providing an Electric immunity for teammates, and Fire-type coverage to deal super effective damage to Grass-types that resist or are immune to Thunderbolt such as Abomasnow, Bellossom, and Torterra. Manectric also has access to the move Switcheroo, which can situationally incapacitate a wall or tank. Manectric faces competition from Alolan Raichu with its unique dual STAB combination and superior Speed stat, as well as most other revenge killers that have overall better utility, such as Primeape. Manectric is easily walled by common Pokemon such as Lanturn and Eelektross and overall too weak to be a major threat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Specs set opens up opportunities for Manectric to be a decent wallbreaker. However, it still suffers from being easily taken advantage of, without being able to outspeed key threats. It is still outclassed by Pokemon such as Alolan Raichu in this role. Flamethrower is 100% accurate and doesn't have any drawbacks, unlike Overheat. However, Flamethrower fails to KO Pokemon such as Rotom-F. Life Orb may sound appealing to make use of Manectric's near-perfect coverage, but it wears Manectric down quickly. Thunder packs a lot more punch than Thunderbolt and Volt Switch but is not reliable and usually not a good move to lock into. Thunder, however, is a decent option on a rain team. Toxic nails Lanturn and Mudsdale on the switch but generally isn't worth running on Choice item sets, as locking into a non-attacking move loses all momentum, and Hidden Power Grass hits them super effectively anyway. Hidden Power Ice hits Dragon-types such as Drampa and Silvally-Dragon that Manectric otherwise would have a hard time combating against, but it leaves Manectric susceptible to Lanturn.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Without Hidden Power Ice, Dragon-types easily beat Manectric one-on-one. Drampa and Silvally-Dragon resist all of Manectric's moves and can KO it with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Electric-immune Pokemon</strong>: Lightning Rod and Volt Absorb users such as Lanturn and opposing Manectric as well as Ground-type Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Mudsdale all take advantage of Manectric Choice-locking itself into one of its STAB moves, killing all momentum for the Manectric user. Lanturn is especially good at this, as it resists Overheat and is at best 5HKOed by Hidden Power Grass. Most other Electric-type switch-ins have to be careful playing around Overheat and Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Manectric has a hard time overcoming bulky Pokemon that invest in Special Defense, such as Clefairy, Audino, Roselia, Type: Null, and Assault Vest Hitmonchan. Assault Vest Eelektross is also notable for taking very little from anything Manectric can throw at it. Manectric can, however, cripple most of them for the remainder of the match by using Switcheroo to give them a Choice Scarf.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Manectric's frailty leaves it susceptible to priority from the likes of Hitmonchan and Skuntank once weakened.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch allows Manectric to pivot out against Pokemon it cannot adequately deal with, gaining momentum in the process. Overheat hits the Grass-types that resist Electric-type attacks such as Victreebel, Abomasnow, and Shiftry. Hidden Power Grass hits Gastrodon and Lanturn, which Manectric otherwise can't touch. Switcheroo can incapacitate walls such as Audino and Altaria, removing their usefulness for the remainder of the match.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf enables Manectric to outspeed the majority of the metagame, including +1 Jynx, Alolan Sandslash under hail, and +2 Carracosta. Lightning Rod allows Manectric to safely switch into predicted Electric-type attacks while simultaneously boosting its Special Attack by one stage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Manectric is typically the main way to check faster foes for a team, as it is one of the fastest Choice Scarf users in the tier. Keeping Manectric around until mid- or late-game is most optimal for maximum cleaning potential. Manectric is pretty frail, so its usually advised to not directly switch it in unless on a resisted attack, on an Electric-type attack, or you are predicting the opponent to switch. Sets utilizing Switcheroo should be cautious to not switch items too early, as switching away its Choice Scarf too early in the match can mean Manectric is no longer able to revenge kill Pokemon like Primeape and +2 Omastar. Try not to lock Manectric into Electric-type moves when the opponent still has Electric-immune Pokemon around. It is usually better to lock Manectric into a coverage move to prevent it from losing momentum. Manectric is a decent revenge killer, picking off weakened Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Primeape. Volt Switch should be used to pivot and gain momentum for your team while dealing chip damage at the same time.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Manectric appreciates having another VoltTurn partner, such as Primeape or Silvally-Fairy, to help chip away at the opponent's Pokemon so another teammate can clean up late-game. Water- and Flying-types like Carracosta, Swanna, and Oricorio-G appreciate the Electric-type immunity Manectric provides. In turn, Water-types deal super effective damage to the Ground-types Manectric is weak to, while Flying-types are immune to Ground-type attacks. Manectric appreciates teammates that set up Stealth Rock and Spikes, such as Aggron and Qwilfish. With support from entry hazards, Manectric has an easier time chipping away at the opponent's Pokemon, especially Pokemon like Lanturn and Hitmonchan, which it has a hard time wearing down. Grass-types like Lurantis and Ludicolo make for good partners for Manectric, as they can switch into Ground-types that trouble Manectric. This is especially important if Manectric makes a misprediction and is locked into an Electric-type move against an opposing Ground-type. Pursuit trappers such as Skuntank and Spiritomb assist Manectric in removing troublesome checks, most notably Lanturn. Wallbreakers like Drampa also assist with wearing down Manectric's checks by severely denting them.</p>"

  "Volbeat": {
    "overview": "<p>Volbeat is one of the tier's best weather setters due to Prankster, decent bulk, and key resistances to Ground and Fighting. Access to both Rain Dance and Sunny Day makes Volbeat a superb choice for hyper offensive rain and sun teams alike. Additionally, Volbeat has an array of utility support options like Defog, Thunder Wave, Encore and Roost, as well as U-turn for pivoting. However, Volbeat suffers from a weakness to Stealth Rock and being incredibly passive, meaning it can usually only get up sun or rain twice per game.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A more defensive set utilizing Defog and Roost can be used, but Volbeat is weak to the very entry hazards it's trying to remove and Defog doesn't work against opposing Dark-types due to Prankster. A specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD and a Sassy nature can be run but doesn't take advantage of Volbeat's key resistances to Fighting and Ground as well as a physically defensive spread does. Toxic can cripple a foe by slowly draining their health, but it doesn't help hyper offensive sun and rain teams to nearly the same extent as Thunder Wave does.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: While many Pokemon with super effective STAB moves like Carracosta and Swanna dislike being paralyzed by Thunder Wave, they can easily break through Volbeat's average-at-best defensive stats. Volbeat also has difficulty against strong wallbreakers like Drampa.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users such as Qwilfish, Lycanroc, and Skuntank can all limit Volbeat to use of only one status move before having to pivot. Faster Prankster Taunt users like Liepard can prevent Volbeat from doing anything at all.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes can chip away at Volbeat's health, possibly preventing it from setting up sun or rain more than one time per match. Toxic and other forms of residual damage also chip away at Volbeat's health throughout the duration of the match.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: Abomasnow and Aurorus can instantly remove Volbeat's weather with Snow Warning, making it almost impossible for Volbeat to effectively set up the rest of its team.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Weather Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sunny Day or Rain Dance assists teammates by setting up the chosen weather with +1 priority thanks to Prankster. U-turn gives Volbeat a slow pivoting move, potentially allowing a teammate to come in unscathed. Thunder Wave cripples the opposing Pokemon, lowering their Speed and potentially giving Volbeat momentum if they get fully paralyzed. Encore helps Volbeat gain momentum by locking the foe into a non-attacking move like Swords Dance or Defog, generating free turns.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Speed-lowering nature with 0 Speed IVs helps Volbeat underspeed Pokemon such as Lanturn so that a teammate can be pivoted in for free with U-turn. Prankster gives Volbeat's status moves +1 priority, allowing it to move before certain Taunt users like Qwilfish and Lycanroc and making it an extremely reliable weather setter. Heat Rock or Damp Rock extends the duration of the moves Sunny Day or Rain Dance from five turns to eight turns.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Volbeat is primarily used as a weather setter on hyper offensive weather teams and should only be brought in when the duration of sun or rain has ended or is about to end. Volbeat's main priority should be to set up sun or rain and U-turn out right after. Despite the investment into Volbeat's defensive stats, its bulk is still lackluster; thus, one should switch Volbeat in cautiously when the opponent is predicted to switch or go for a resisted hit, since hyper offensive teams rely heavily on their chosen weather being set up. Volbeat can also be brought in after a teammate has fainted, giving it a free setup turn. There are some Pokemon Volbeat just cannot underspeed, such as Drampa and Gurdurr; in these situations, it's best to stay and let Volbeat faint than to U-turn and let one of your hyper offensive sweepers take a massive hit. In the case of Gurdurr, you may be able to Encore it into a non-attacking move like Bulk Up, allowing you then to safely pivot into a teammate. Encore is able to generate free turns for teammates or force a switch while also keeping setup sweepers checked.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Volbeat should be used alongside a secondary weather setter, so Pokemon like Liepard are appreciated. For teams utilizing Volbeat's Sunny Day, Chlorophyll sweepers such as Victreebel, Sawsbuck, and Leafeon appreciate having their Speed doubled or their STAB moves boosted. Partners for Rain Dance Volbeat are usually Pokemon with the ability Swift Swim, such as Ludicolo, Kabutops, and Omastar.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Roselia's bulk and defensive typing allow it to solidly check dangerous special attackers such as Jellicent, Victreebel, and Omastar. Its access to Spikes and ability to absorb Toxic Spikes give it good utility, and Synthesis and Natural Cure provide it with greater longevity than other entry hazard setters and allow it to absorb status. Furthermore, Roselia's good STAB combination and decent Special Attack prevent it from being overly passive and allow it to pressure removers like Lurantis and Hitmonchan in one way or another. However, Roselia's defenses are easily exploited due to its low physical bulk and reliance on Eviolite, and its otherwise good defensive typing leaves it vulnerable to Flying-, Ice-, and Psychic-types. This is especially notable because it enables removers like Alolan Sandslash as well as Skuntank to switch in and exploit it. Roselia also faces competition from Qwilfish and Ferroseed as spikers, as the former is faster and has superior utility options, while the latter offers superior physical bulk and a more splashable defensive typing.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sleep Powder can be used to cripple switch-ins, but Roselia struggles to find room for the move and needs both of its STAB moves to refrain from becoming overly passive. Hidden Power Fire deals solid damage to Ferroseed and Alolan Sandslash but doesn't hit much else.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Roselia's low physical bulk leaves it easily pressured and forced out by physical attackers such as Aggron, Kangaskhan, Stoutland, and Lycanroc, but they can struggle to switch directly into it.</p> <p><strong>Loss of Eviolite</strong>: Roselia's bulk becomes rather lackluster if it loses its Eviolite from Knock Off, Switcheroo, or Trick, which prevents it from checking special attackers as reliably.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Oricorio-G resists Roselia's STAB combination and can easily set up on it, with bulky sets also being able to recover any lost health with Roost. While they can't switch in as easily as Oricorio-G, more offensive Flying-types like Dodrio and Swanna threaten Roselia and can similarly take advantage of it by setting up, regaining HP, or removing entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Alolan Sandslash completely walls Roselia, threatens to KO it with Icicle Crash, and removes any Spikes set with Rapid Spin, with offensive sets even using Roselia as setup fodder. Metang keeps Roselia firmly in check and 2HKOes it with Meteor Mash. Ferroseed can set up entry hazards for free and can chip Roselia with Gyro Ball, forcing it to heal while Roselia does little damage in return.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: In addition to Alolan Sandslash, Aurorus, Rotom-F and especially Cryogonal pose a huge threat to Roselia. While it doesn't enjoy switching directly into Giga Drain, Aurorus is able to diminish the amount of recovery Roselia gains from Synthesis thanks to Snow Warning and threatens to OHKO it with Blizzard. Rotom-F and Cryogonal are immune to Roselia's spikes and can threaten to KO it with strong STAB moves or Defog away Roselia's hazards. Rotom-F is also able to threaten Roselia with Trick, while Cryogonal can heal off any damage Roselia puts out with Recover.</p> <p><strong>Skuntank</strong>: Skuntank is one of Roselia's greatest annoyances, as Skuntank can easily remove its Spikes with Defog, prevent recovery or the use of Spikes with Taunt, and potentially Pursuit trap it.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Roselia struggles to deal much damage to specially bulky Pokemon like Throh, Type: Null, and Altaria. These Pokemon can easily disrupt Roselia by threatening to remove its Eviolite, pressuring it with strong attacks, and removing its hazards with ease, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types like Alolan Raichu and Jynx can KO Roselia with Psyshock as well as freely use Nasty Plot as it switches out, although can't switch into it too easily.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Synthesis allows Roselia to remain healthy and consistently check threats like Jellicent and Lanturn through the course of a game. Sludge Bomb and Giga Drain synergize well together, as they prevent foes with typing advantages such as Dodrio from freely switching into Roselia. Toxic Spikes, while not as consistently threatening due to the prominence of Victreebel, Qwilfish, and Skuntank, can potentially be used over Spikes to place greater pressure on defensive teams, more so if two layers are set.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The HP and Special Defense investment in tandem with Eviolite prevents Roselia from being OHKOed by +2 Omastar's Ice Beam. 24 Speed EVs allows Roselia to outspeed Modest Drampa and uninvested Lanturn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Roselia should primarily switch into threats it can check such as Omastar and Poliwrath, as it will force them out and give Roselia a free opportunity to set Spikes. Use Synthesis when Roselia starts losing noticeable amounts of HP so that it can consistently check threats, but take care to use the move as conservatively as possible due to its low PP. Teams with Aurorus or Abomasnow can exploit the use of Synthesis because of the hail these Pokemon set, so be careful about staying healthy when hail is active. Although Roselia can be used to check certain weaker or passive physical attackers like Regirock, its mediocre physical bulk can prevent it from reliably handling them, meaning that it should only be done if absolutely necessary. If the opposing team has an entry hazard remover that Roselia is incapable of threatening, such as Skuntank or Cryogonal, aim to wear them down, double switch whenever anticipating them to switch in, or set Spikes in hopes of forcing the use of removal. Scout for moves that may cripple Roselia like Knock Off and Trick before switching directly into Pokemon such as Sableye and Jellicent, as Roselia is nearly completely dependent on Eviolite for its bulk. Due to Natural Cure, Roselia should often be used to absorb status conditions like burns and paralysis for its team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Roselia fits best on bulky offensive and balanced teams looking for a Spikes setter that can also keep a number of threats to the playstyles in check. Jellicent is a fantastic teammate, as it reliably blocks Rapid Spin thanks to its Ghost typing and solid bulk, takes advantage of Spikes to annoy defensive teams with its utility moves, and handles checks to Roselia such as Combusken and Crabominable while Roselia absorbs Toxic and Toxic Spikes on top of taking on Lurantis, Bellossom, and Lanturn. Choice Specs Jellicent also has an easier time wallbreaking with Spikes support. Specially defensive Alolan Sandslash appreciates having Poliwrath checked, can pressure Pokemon like Aurorus and mono-attacking Oricorio-E, completes an entry hazard-stacking core with Roselia, and can use Rapid Spin to keep Roselia from being worn down by opposing hazards without compromising its own. Given that Roselia's bulk stems from its Eviolite, it should be paired with Knock Off absorbers like Poliwrath, Throh, and Alolan Persian. The former two especially appreciate Spikes support, as it allows them to more easily wear opposing teams down with Circle Throw. Flying checks such as Regirock, Eelektross, and Oricorio-E are useful partners, as Roselia tends to bait in Flying-types such as Dodrio, Oricorio-G, and Swanna. Because Roselia struggles to deal meaningful damage to Steel-types like Alolan Sandslash and Metang, checks to them such as Gurdurr and Mudsdale are good partners. The former can also serve as a solid check to a number of physical attackers. Pursuit trappers such as Skuntank and Stoutland make for good teammates, since they can heavily damage or remove Ghost-types that freely switch into Roselia, such as Oricorio-G and Haunter, in addition to frail Rapid Spin users like Cryogonal and choice-locked Kabutops. Choice Band Skuntank also very much appreciates Spikes support, and can take Psychic-type attacks directed at Roselia.</p>"

Furthermore, Wailord cannot function outside of stall and just wastes a teamslot on non-stall teams, where other Water-types in the tier, like Jellicent and Lanturn, are able to perform much better than Wailord.</p>"}},

  "Camerupt": {
    "overview": "<p>Camerupt is a niche wallbreaker that can make use of its great STAB combination, high Special Attack, and access to Eruption to power through bulky teams. Camerupt's typing also gives it a unique set of resistances and allows it to pivot into Pokemon like Eelektross and Ferroseed in order to apply offensive pressure. However, Camerupt's poor bulk and awful Speed limit its wallbreaking opportunities against offensive teams, leaving it easily revenge killed by Pokemon such as Stoutland and Primeape, and even weaker attackers like Cryogonal can pressure it. Furthermore, Camerupt faces immense competition from special wallbreakers like Aurorus and Victreebel, which offer more spammable attacks or greater Speed. Camerupt also contests with Simisear and Combusken as Fire-types due to their far better Speed tiers and access to setup moves, making them more effective against most playstyles, and Taunt variations of Simisear also possess a solid matchup against stall teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Camerupt could attempt to use a defensive Stealth Rock set with options like Lava Plume and Toxic, which lets it spread status and grants it a solid matchup against entry hazard setters and removers such as Regirock, Hitmonchan, and Alolan Sandslash. This set is generally outclassed by the likes of Regirock and Mudsdale, however, as they possess far better defenses, while Camerupt's bulk is average even with investment.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Lanturn, Jellicent, Kabutops, and Floatzel all OHKO Camerupt using their super effective STAB moves, though only Jellicent can safely switch into Earth Power. Swanna is notably immune to Earth Power and can shrug off damage with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Mudsdale, Golurk, and Alolan Dugtrio can't safely switch into any one move but can OHKO Camerupt with Earthquake. Mudsdale also has just enough bulk to survive a maximum power Eruption from full health.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers</strong>: Because of Camerupt's poor defense stats, many strong attackers like Stoutland, Aurorus, Victreebel, and Kangaskhan can power through it with ease.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Any form of damage weakens the power of Eruption and makes Camerupt easier to revenge kill because of its lacking defenses and recovery options. Notable examples include entry hazards and moves such as Ferroseed's Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Altaria</strong>: Despite being uncommon, Altaria completely walls Camerupt's main attacking options. While it should be cautious of the rare Hidden Power Ice, it's a rather difficult move for Camerupt to lock into, as it prefers using its powerful STAB moves to break through teams without relying heavily on prediction.</p>",

      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Overheat serves as a backup STAB move for when Camerupt lacks the health to utilize Eruption, OHKOing Pokemon like Mudsdale and Gurdurr with enough chip damage beforehand. Flamethrower is a safe STAB option that offers consistent damage output, while Earth Power covers for Pokemon resistant to Camerupt's Fire-type moves like Regirock, Jellicent, and Gastrodon. Hidden Power Ice is an option over Overheat to cover Altaria, which can otherwise switch into any of Camerupt's attacks with ease, but it has no other applicable use.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Modest nature boosts Cameruptâ€™s damage while still letting it outspeed defensive Pokemon such as Jellicent and Alolan Sandslash as well as uninvested base 50 Speed Pokemon like Regirock. Solid Rock reduces the power of Water- and Ground-type moves directed at Camerupt, allowing it to take less damage from moves like Qwilfish's Scald and Metang's Earthquake.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Camerupt should find any safe opportunity possible to enter the field and apply pressure to teams with its powerful moves; it can notably switch into Pokemon like Silvally-Fairy and Stealth Rock setters such as Regirock attempting to set up entry hazards. However, it should avoid directly switching into most Pokemon, as taking excessive damage weakens the power of Eruption and generally makes it easier to pick off due to its poor defenses. To circumvent this, try to find openings for Camerupt to switch in, whether through a pivot or an aggressive double switch where it can exploit Pokemon such as Alolan Sandslash and Metang. If the opponent lacks a sturdy Fire-resistant Pokemon, Camerupt is often free to spam Eruption for the most optimal damage output, 2HKOing the vast majority of the tier including dedicated special walls like Audino. However, if this isn't the case, Camerupt may be forced to predict Pokemon like Jellicent and Gastrodon to switch in and take a hit, where Earth Power can be used to 2HKO them on the switch. Be careful when using Overheat and Eruption against more offensive teams, as their power is drastically weakened upon use or taking enough damage, which can leave it vulnerable to setup sweepers like Oricorio-E and Lycanroc. Once Camerupt has fulfilled its role or has been significantly weakened, it's advised to sacrifice it, as its abysmal Speed and inability to take most attacks prevent it from being effective late into a match.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pivots such as Lanturn, Primeape, and Alolan Persian are notable for keeping Camerupt healthy when sending it in to maximize Eruption's damage output and drawing in Pokemon for it to exploit like Ferroseed, Sableye, and Gurdurr. Lanturn also deals with Water-types like Jellicent and Swanna, while Alolan Persian can utilize Z-Parting Shot to bring Camerupt back up to full health. Entry hazard control aids Camerupt significantly; Stealth Rock and Spikes setters such as Regirock and Ferroseed wear down teams and punish Water- and Rock-types attempting to repeatedly switch into Fire-type moves, while Pokemon like Cryogonal and Swanna can clear entry hazards so Camerupt stays as healthy as possible. The previously mentioned Lanturn, Regirock, and Cryogonal are also important partners for their ability to come in and take hits from wallbreakers that can overwhelm Camerupt like Rotom-F, Stoutland, and Aurorus. Setup sweepers and late-game cleaners like Alolan Sandslash, Dodrio, and Oricorio-G enjoy having roadblocks such as Regirock and Eelektross removed or chipped while appreciating Camerupt's ability to whittle at defensive teams. Teammates like Alolan Raichu, Victreebel, and Poliwrath are great answers to Pokemon that may try to take advantage of Camerupt being locked into a Fire-type attack such as Regirock and Omastar, and Pokemon such as Eelektross and Lycanroc act as immediate answers to Earth Power switch-ins like Swanna and Oricorio-E.</p>"

  "Cacturne": {
    "overview": "<p>Cacturne finds its niche in the PU metagame as a strong offensive Spikes setter. High base offensive stats allow Cacturne to wallbreak, and Water Absorb and Cacturne's ability to use Spikes are the main features that set it apart from Shiftry, which would mostly outclass it otherwise. Water Absorb notably allows Cacturne to come in on passive Water-type Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Lanturn without fearing Scald burns. Also, Cacturne's offensive typing allows it to threaten a lot of opposing Stealth Rock setters such as Regirock, Mudsdale, and Bronzor. However, its subpar defensive stats make Cacturne very vulnerable to any type of super effective hit or any strong attack in general. Cacturne also has an awful base 55 Speed tier, meaning it is outsped by a lot of offensive Pokemon like Aurorus and Abomasnow; this also means it is very reliant on Sucker Punch to hit faster threats. Its inability to hit Skuntank for a lot of damage can also hinder its ability to effectively wallbreak and set up Spikes.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Swords Dance set with Seed Bomb, Sucker Punch, and Superpower can be used, but Shiftry is better at this due to its higher base Speed and better STAB move in Knock Off. A Hasty nature can be used to always outspeed Pokemon such as Adamant Golurk as well as most Lanturn, Poliwrath, and Assault Vest Hitmonchan, but this comes at the cost of a significant drop in power that affects Cacturne's wallbreaking capabilities. Spiky Shield is an option if your team already has a Spikes or Toxic Spikes setter such as Ferroseed or Qwilfish, as in combination with other entry hazards, the chip damage from Spiky Shield can rack up pretty quickly and put foes in KO range of Sucker Punch. This also lets Cacturne scout for moves such as U-turn from Choice-locked Pokemon like Primeape. A full wallbreaking set with Focus Blast over Spikes can be used to hit Skuntank as well as Normal- and Steel-types for decent neutral or super effective damage, but Shiftry can also pull this off with a better base Speed and better STAB attacks such as Leaf Storm and Knock Off. Nasty Plot is an option to break through specially defensive walls like Clefairy, but this means that Cacturne would have no room to use Spikes and is again outclassed by Shiftry. A physically based set with Stomping Tantrum can be used to allow Cacturne to hit Skuntank for super effective damage, but it doesn't offer much utility outside of that.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Hitmonchan, Throh, and Assault Vest Crabominable are all examples of Fighting-type Pokemon that are able to take a hit from Cacturne and revenge kill it with their respective STAB moves. Primeape isn't able to comfortably switch into Cacturne, but is able to outspeed it and hit it with either Close Combat or U-turn, as it does not take a lot of damage from Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Clefairy is able to switch in on any of Cacturne's attacks and beat it one-on-one with Moonblast or just heal off any damage with Roost and Soft-Boiled. Silvally-Fairy does not enjoy taking an Energy Ball from Cacturne, but can pressure it out with Multi-Attack and Defog away any Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Pokemon that heavily invest in Special Defense such as Type: Null, Cryogonal, and Articuno can switch into any of Cacturne's attacks well enough and heal off the damage, while also being able to threaten Cacturne back due to Cacturne's poor defensive stats.</p> <p><strong>Skuntank</strong>: Skuntank resists both of Cacturne's STAB moves and threatens Cacturne back with super effective attacks like Poison Jab and Fire Blast. Skuntank is also able to Defog away Spikes that Cacturne may have got up, as it doesn't have to worry about being hit for too much damage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Due to Cacturne's low base Speed stat and subpar defensive stats, it can easily get revenge killed by faster Pokemon that don't take enough damage from Sucker Punch, such as Abomasnow, Absol, and Kangaskhan.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes allows Cacturne to pressure the opposing team with passive damage and helps Cacturne and its teammates break down defensive cores more easily. Sucker Punch gives Cacturne some form of priority against frailer attackers that outspeed it, as Cacturne's really low Speed leaves it easily outsped by Pokemon like Jynx and Alolan Sandslash. Energy Ball is Cacturne's secondary STAB move, which hits slightly harder than Dark Pulse and nabs OHKOs on Regirock and Aggron. Although weaker, Giga Drain can be used to let Cacturne recover some of the health that it loses to Life Orb recoil.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Mild nature is used to increase Cacturne's Special Attack and ensure that its Sucker Punch isn't weakened. Mild is also chosen over Rash, since it allows Cacturne to switch into special attackers such as Gastrodon more easily. A Life Orb is used to further increase the power of Cacturne's attacks; the recoil damage isn't too detrimental for it, since Cacturne doesn't like taking hits anyway. Water Absorb allows Cacturne to switch in on predicted Water-type attacks from Pokemon such as Lanturn and Jellicent, heal up by 25%, and proceed to attack the foe or set up Spikes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cacturne should be used for firing off powerful attacks against teams without reliable switch-ins or to break down opposing specially defensive Pokemon such as Assault Vest Hitmonchan. Cacturne should set up Spikes against teams that have reliable switch-ins to it such as Throh and Type: Null because the Spikes can pressure them the next time they switch in. Spikes are also useful for putting faster threats like Ludicolo and Alolan Dugtrio into KO range of Sucker Punch. Bringing Cacturne in on predicted Water-type moves from defensive Water-types like Jellicent and Gastrodon gives Cacturne a free switch due to its ability, Water Absorb. Double switching can also allow Cacturne to come in for free so it can avoid taking unnecessary damage. Use Dark Pulse if the opponent has good Grass-type switch-ins such as Sap Sipper Drampa and Abomasnow. On the other hand, use Energy Ball in situations where the opponent has good Dark-resistant Pokemon like Assault Vest Hitmonchan and Silvally-Fairy.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ghost-types such as Jellicent and Golurk make good partners, as they can switch in on Fighting-type attacks as well as U-turn from Primeape, while also blocking Rapid Spin, ensuring Cacturne's Spikes stay on the field. Pokemon that can pressure Ice-types such as Primeape and Alolan Sandslash work well with Cacturne, and also lure in bulky Water-types like Jellicent and Gastrodon that gives Cacturne breaking opportunities. Slow Volt Switch and U-turn support from Pokemon such as Eelektross and Lanturn are useful, allowing Cacturne to switch in for free. Pokemon that can switch into Skuntank like Gurdurr and Mudsdale are good partners because Skuntank resists both of Cacturne's STAB moves and can Defog away Spikes. Late-game cleaners such as Omastar appreciate Cacturne's Spikes support and its ability to break down specially defensive tanks. Assault Vest Hitmonchan is able to take on Fire- and Ice-types such as Simisear and Abomasnow, which threaten Cacturne, whilst also offering good utility in Rapid Spin to keep Cacturne healthy. Other Fire-type checks, most notably Lanturn, make for good partners, as Lanturn also provide a slow Volt Switch to give Cacturne wallbreaking opportunities without the need to take damage.</p>"

  "Altaria": {
    "overview": "<p>Altaria is a solid pick on bulkier builds as a defensive Defogger and check to powerful threats such as Eelektross, Swanna, and Simisear thanks to its good bulk, access to Roost, and Dragon / Flying typing. Altaria's also more durable than other entry hazard removers such as Silvally-Dragon, and its typing makes it immune to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web. Altaria also has Natural Cure, letting it act as a status sponge for its team and giving it an edge when facing other defensive Toxic users such as Regirock. However, Altaria is rather passive, inviting many wallbreakers such as Aggron and Stoutland in for free. Its overreliance on Toxic leaves it helpless against Pokemon such as Skuntank and Clefairy, and Taunt and Substitute users such as Oricorio-G and Alolan Sandslash can turn it into setup bait. Some teams may also prefer other hazard removers such as Hitmonchan and Skuntank due to their lesser passivity, ability to check faster foes with priority moves and Speed investment, and ability to check Pokemon such as Aurorus and Clefairy. Altaria's Stealth Rock weakness makes it easier to overwhelm when it's checking powerful wallbreakers such as Primeape and makes its job as a remover harder when it's switching into Stealth Rock. Altaria's 4x weakness to Ice leaves it helpless against many Ice-types such as Aurorus and Jynx, as well as foes that may carry Ice-type coverage such as Lanturn. Additionally, Altaria fares poorly against certain hazard setters such as Clefairy and Aggron due to either being unable to touch them or being threatened out by their attacks. However, despite its shortcomings, Altaria's defensive utility and access to Defog are great strengths for bulkier teams looking to include it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A more physically defensive spread can ease Altaria's matchup against certain physical attackers such as Regirock and Primeape, notably allowing it to better switch into, Toxic stall, and remove the hazards of the former. However, this causes special attackers such as Eelektross and Victreebel to pressure Altaria more. Heal Bell is an option on bulkier archetypes that allows Altaria to function as a cleric. Altaria has a hard time finding room for it, though, and Audino already accomplishes the role of a cleric on similar archetypes. Haze and Roar give Altaria the upper hand against certain setup sweepers such as Gurdurr, Bellossom, and Pinsir. The latter is also useful for racking up entry hazard damage and annoying Substitute users. However, even when unboosted, said foes can carry coverage moves to beat Altaria regardless, such as Moonblast and Stone Edge. Flamethrower prevents certain Steel-types such as Alolan Dugtrio and Alolan Sandslash from switching into Altaria for free. However, it is otherwise poor coverage against foes such as Qwilfish and Poliwrath, which can be dangerous if they are carrying Taunt or Substitute. Hidden Power Ground functions similarly but hits certain Steel-types such as Aggron and Probopass harder and hits Qwilfish super effectively. However, it's extraordinarily weak by itself and dropping Toxic lets in other dangerous threats for free. As a result, it is only passable on teams extremely weak to Aggron. Dragon Dance allows Altaria to sweep and wallbreak late-game; it can lure in its usual answers such as Aurorus, Aggron, and Clefairy and remove them with Earthquake and Iron Tail, and it can blast through unsuspecting foes with a Z-Move. Thanks to its multiple resistances and good bulk, it also has more opportunities to set up versus Pokemon such as Eelektross. Overall, though, such a set is quite weak and easy to revenge kill even after a boost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-types and Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Due to Altaria's 4x weakness to Ice, Pokemon such as Aurorus, Jynx, and Alolan Sandslash can all outspeed it and OHKO it with their respective Ice-type STAB moves, caring little for Toxic and Dragon Pulse. Aurorus and Alolan Sandslash can also run entry hazards, making Altaria's job as a Defogger quite difficult, as they threaten it out. Alolan Sandslash can notably use Altaria as setup fodder for Substitute and Swords Dance. Hitmonchan, Golurk, Ludicolo, and offensive Lanturn can threaten Altaria in a similar fashion with Ice Punch and Ice Beam. However, Altaria beats most of them if they are not carrying said coverage.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Aggron, Lycanroc, Carracosta, and Omastar can all threaten Altaria with their super effective STAB attacks or, in Omastar's case, Ice Beam. The latter three can all set up on Altaria as well, only being annoyed by Toxic or chip from Dragon Pulse. Regirock can overwhelm Altaria between Toxic and Stone Edge, easing its ability to set Stealth Rock against it and pressure it later on.</p> <p><strong>Clefairy</strong>: Thanks to Magic Guard and its Fairy typing, Clefairy walls Altaria completely. It can set up Stealth Rock on it Altaria repeatedly and forces it to switch out to heal off Clefairy's Toxic with Natural Cure. Altaria is also complete setup bait for Clefairy using Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Pokemon such as Stoutland, Swords Dance Victreebel, and Choice Band Skuntank all pressure Altaria on its weaker physically defensive side. All three care little about Toxic as well, as the former carries Facade and the latter two are immune.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Substitute</strong>: Due to Altaria's reliance on Toxic, Taunt users such as Sableye, Oricorio-G, and Qwilfish can shut it down almost completely, leaving it with only a weak Dragon Pulse. From there, they can set up stat boosts, set entry hazards, or wear it down with attacks. The former two even have recovery, making it impossible for Altaria to wear them down. Substitute users such as Alolan Dugtrio can also chip away at Altaria with Toxic or attacks or use it as setup bait, provided Altaria is not carrying coverage such as Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Spiritomb, Type: Null, and Munchlax all capitalize on Altaria's passiveness and use it as bait for setting up with Calm Mind, Swords Dance, or Curse. They can all shrug off Altaria's Toxic, too, thanks to Rest.</p>",

      "Defensive Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog lets Altaria support its team by removing entry hazards, and Altaria is a notably good user of the move thanks to its ability to switch into certain hazard setters such as Mudsdale. Toxic allows Altaria to chip away at bulkier foes such as Eelektross and Regirock without relying on its mediocre offensive stats. It also puts a timer on attackers and sweepers such as Carracosta. Dragon Pulse prevents Pokemon such as Qwilfish and Haunter from freely using Taunt and Substitute against Altaria while also helping to rack up chip damage overall. Roost keeps Altaria healthy, allowing it to remove hazards and check Pokemon such as Swanna more comfortably throughout the game.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>96 EVs are invested in Speed to outspeed Modest Jellicent, letting Altaria use Roost before taking an attack. Leftovers grants Altaria passive recovery during the match. Natural Cure relieves Altaria of status, mainly Toxic poison, upon switching out, which improves its matchup against opposing bulky Toxic users such as Regirock. It also helps Altaria check threats such as Lanturn lacking Ice Beam.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Altaria should generally be brought in against foes that it walls, such as Eelektross, and use the forced switch as an opportunity to Defog any entry hazards that are on your side of the field. If there are no hazards to remove or if they are of little concern, Altaria can instead focus on spreading Toxic poison throughout the opposing team to weaken them for late-game. Use Roost whenever Altaria's health begins to dwindle, as it otherwise may not be able to switch into Stealth Rock later in the game to use Defog. It will also have trouble checking threats such as Primeape and Haunter if it's not at full health. If the opponent has a Pokemon that Altaria invites in for free, such as Aggron or Aurorus, double switching is a smart play, as said Pokemon can wreak havoc once on the field. Thanks to Altaria's Natural Cure and good matchup against certain Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, and Thunder Wave users such as Regirock, Jellicent, and Qwilfish, Altaria can be used as a status sponge and pivot into said Pokemon for teammates.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to Altaria's passive nature, it usually belongs on bulkier builds such as balance, bulky offense, and stall due to its ability to check otherwise troublesome threats such as Simisear and Eelektross. Its passive nature also makes it undesirable on offensive or hyper offensive builds, which are often more momentum based. Pokemon susceptible to entry hazard chip damage such as Aurorus and Lanturn appreciate Altaria's Defog support increasing their longevity. The latter has decent defensive synergy with Altaria; Lanturn offers a check to Aurorus, while Altaria beats Eelektross and Grass-types such as Lurantis. Checks to Ice-types such as Jynx and Aurorus are greatly appreciated. Poliwrath and Lanturn can check Ice-types decently if they're wary of Freeze-Dry or secondary STAB attacks from Pokemon such as Abomasnow. They appreciate Altaria removing Spikes and Toxic Spikes in return; Poliwrath can also check Rock-types such as Aggron in exchange. Sturdier defensive answers to Ice-types also include Bronzor, Alolan Sandslash, and Assault Vest Crabominable, with the latter greatly appreciating Altaria's Defog due to its vulnerability to chip damage. Altaria's passiveness often invites many powerful physical attackers such as Aggron, Hitmonchan, and Alolan Sandslash in for little to no cost. Checks to such Pokemon are appreciated. Gurdurr does well at checking all three, as does Poliwrath. More defensive partners such as Sableye and Tangela accomplish a similar role and help whittle down the opposing team with status, Leech Seed, and Knock Off. In return, Altaria checks special attackers such as Swanna and removes Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Altaria likes a teammate to beat Clefairy, as it ignores Altaria's Toxic and Dragon Pulse and can repeatedly set Stealth Rock or set up with Calm Mind. Aggron and Alolan Sandslash beat it quite comfortably and appreciate Altaria's ability to check special attackers. Altaria synergizes well with typical stall picks such as Audino and Pyukumuku, as they appreciate its ability to remove hazards and check threats such as Kangaskhan and Aurorus. Natu or a secondary hazard remover such as Articuno or Skuntank can be used in addition to Altaria on such archetypes to give the team a better matchup against Spikes Qwilfish, which can otherwise annoy Altaria with Taunt.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Zangoose is a very powerful Normal-type wallbreaker. STAB Facade along with its other attacks hits extremely hard when combined with Toxic Orb and Toxic Boost. Zangoose also boasts excellent coverage options in Knock Off and Close Combat that allow it to hit Ghost-, Rock-, and Steel-types. Its middling Speed stat is somewhat nullified by Zangoose's access to Quick Attack, which lets it hit faster threats and take out weakened foes. This is especially useful for Zangoose's Belly Drum set, which can be a deadly sweeper. However, although it has great offensive capability, Zangoose is hindered a lot by its subpar defensive stats and Toxic damage, which ultimately means it can be easily revenge killed. Zangoose also faces competition from other Normal-types in the tier such as Kangaskhan and Dodrio, which, although not hitting as hard, can usually be more reliable, as they don't have Toxic damage wearing them down each turn.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Protect can be used to ensure the Toxic Orb activates, but this means Zangoose lose out on valuable coverage. Normalium Z can be used over Sitrus Berry on Belly Drum sets to turn Belly Drum into Z-Belly Drum, which restores all of Zangoose's lost HP before it uses Belly Drum. This also gives it the option to boost Quick Attack into Breakneck Blitz to have a stronger hit against foes like Tangela. If Zangoose can manage to safely use Belly Drum once, it can use Z-Belly Drum afterwards to completely regain its HP; however, this is far more situational and leaves Zangoose weaker than if it was holding a Sitrus Berry. A Choice Scarf set with Double Edge, Knock Off, Close Combat, and Final Gambit or Return is an option that improves Zangoose's Speed and changes its role to more of a revenge killer rather than a wallbreaker.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Gurdurr, defensive Poliwrath, and Throh can all take a Facade and knock out or phaze Zangoose with their super effective STAB moves. Hitmonchan and offensive Poliwrath threaten Zangoose with priority Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, while Primeape can naturally outspeed Zangoose, take a Quick Attack, and reply with a Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Sableye and other Ghost-types with a Colbur Berry like Jellicent and Golurk are immune to Zangoose's Facade, don't take enough damage from Knock Off, and are able to deal a lot of damage back with Scald or Earthquake. Offensive Ghost-types such as Oricorio-G and Haunter outspeed Zangoose and can hit it hard with their respective STAB moves, not having to worry about Quick Attack because they are immune to it.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Regirock and Carbink are able to take Facade really well and both can survive a Close Combat too. Offensive Rock-types like Lycanroc check Zangoose too, as they resist Quick Attack and threaten Zangoose with their respective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon that aren't that frail such as Oricorio-E and Alolan Persian are able to outspeed and revenge kill Zangoose without taking too much damage from Quick Attack.</p>",

      "Toxic Orb Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Facade is Zangoose's strongest move that can reach insane amounts of damage in conjunction with STAB and Toxic Boost. Knock Off allows Zangoose to hit Ghost-types such as Golurk and Jellicent that would otherwise switch in. Close Combat is used to get the super effective hit on Rock- and Steel-types such as Regirock, Probopass, and Aggron, which can stomach Zangoose's other attacks. Swords Dance is an option to boost Zangoose's Attack to tremendous levels, helping it muscle past Pokemon such as Sableye and turning it into a fearsome sweeper with Quick Attack. However, the lack of Close Combat coverage means that Zangoose finds it a lot harder to break past Normal-resistant Pokemon like Regirock, Alolan Sandslash, and Carracosta. Quick Attack is good for cleaning up weakened Pokemon, which is also a good way to activate Zangoose's Toxic Orb in the process.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Toxic Orb is necessary to activate Zangoose's Toxic Boost ability and power up its Facade. An Adamant nature makes Zangoose slightly better at wallbreaking, while a Jolly nature is an option to outspeed base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Shiftry as well as outpacing Pinsir and Adamant Kangaskhan.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Zangoose should be used as a wallbreaker, breaking down the opposing team's defensive core so that a partner can clean up later on. Free switches from a slow U-turn or Volt Switch are vital for Zangoose to function well because it does not like taking hits and it needs its Toxic Orb to activate so that it can deal the maximum amount of damage. Bringing Zangoose in against a very low HP Pokemon and knocking them out with an attack is another good way to activate Toxic Orb. Make sure to be wary of double switches from your opponent's Ghost-, Rock- and Steel-types, as those can rack up Toxic damage and limits the number of turns Zangoose can stay in. If you are using Swords Dance, setting up can be quite hard due to Zangoose's terrible bulk. Try to set up on predicted switches, Protects aiming to stall out Zangoose's Toxic damage, Choice-locked Ghost-types, or very passive Pokemon like Clefairy.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primeape is a good partner, not only because of its access to U-turn, but also because Zangoose breaks down physical walls such as Mudsdale and Musharna really well, allowing Primeape to use Close Combat freely. Fire-types like Combusken and Simisear are great partners, as they can take on Sableye, which gives Zangoose issues. Pokemon that resist Fighting such as Jellicent can stop Pokemon like Gurdurr and Primeape that try to revenge kill Zangoose. Healing Wish support from Pokemon like Mr. Mime is appreciated, as Zangoose is often worn down a lot by its Toxic Orb. Entry hazard removal can be crucial, since Zangoose has limited health already and hates to be worn down more by Stealth Rock and Spikes. Some options include Hitmonchan and Swanna, as they can threaten defensive answers to Zangoose like Regirock.</p>"
      },
      "Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Belly Drum maximizes Zangoose's Attack, which immediately turns it into an offensive threat and dangerous late-game cleaner at the cost of 50% of its HP. Quick Attack makes up for Zangoose's merely decent Speed tier and becomes fairly powerful after it uses Belly Drum, allowing it to KO certain offensive checks such as Primeape and making it quite difficult to revenge kill without a faster Ghost-type. Knock Off provides Zangoose with coverage for Ghost-types such as Spiritomb, Jellicent, and Golurk, which are immune to Quick Attack. Close Combat rounds out Zangoose's coverage, giving it the ability to heavily damage Rock- and Steel-types that resist Quick Attack such as Regirock, Aggron, and Alolan Sandslash. Return could be considered over Close Combat in order to give Zangoose a more reliable, powerful STAB option that OHKOes the likes of Mudsdale at +6, though opting for it over Close Combat means that Zangoose cannot bypass Rock- and Steel-types. Furthermore, Return isn't really necessary, since Zangoose is already powerful enough to OHKO most threats with Quick Attack or Close Combat at +6.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Jolly nature is ideal in order to outspeed Skuntank and Pinsir, allowing Zangoose to Quick Attack the former before a potential Sucker Punch. 4 EVs are placed in HP to ensure that Sitrus Berry will activate after Zangoose uses Belly Drum. Sitrus Berry restores 25% of Zangoose's HP, which leaves it at 75% after it uses Belly Drum. Immunity renders Zangoose immune to poison, meaning that it can freely switch in on Toxic Spikes and cannot be put on a timer with Toxic.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Since Zangoose is a late-game cleaner, it should refrain from attempting to set up until after very physically bulky Pokemon like Mudsdale and faster Ghost-types such as Haunter and Oricorio-G have been either weakened or removed, as it is unlikely that it will get a second chance to attempt to do so. However, despite excelling as a late-game cleaner that can shred offensive teams, Belly Drum Zangoose is also capable of wallbreaking against balance teams. Zangoose's meager defenses and lack of resistances or immunities barring Ghost prevent it from reliably switching in on even weaker attacks, meaning that it should only be brought in following the use of Memento, through the use of U-turn or Volt Switch, or after a teammate is KOed. Zangoose should be cautious of switching in while entry hazards are up, as they further shorten its longevity and limit its ability to safely use Belly Drum and switching in on Toxic Spikes reveals Zangoose's set. Zangoose should mainly set up against slower Pokemon that it forces out like Aurorus.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Belly Drum Zangoose fits on offensive teams, primarily Sticky Web teams, as they are more than capable of providing the support that Zangoose needs in order to do its job well. Sticky Web support from Pokemon such as Smeargle and Shuckle slows foes down, which can give Zangoose an easier time sweeping and leave it less reliant on Quick Attack against faster foes. Furthermore, the former can use Spore to help Zangoose create setup opportunities as well as Nuzzle to keep faster foes like Primeape in check, while the latter can provide useful Knock Off support or wear down Pokemon with Toxic. Zangoose appreciates being paired with Pursuit trappers such as Skuntank and Spiritomb, since they can remove faster Ghost-types that easily revenge kill Zangoose like Haunter and Oricorio-G. The former can also provide entry hazard removal, while the latter can cripple physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp, which can potentially ease setup. Memento support from the likes of Alolan Dugtrio, Jumpluff, and the two previously mentioned Pursuit trappers is very much appreciated due to Zangoose's frailty giving it a difficult time freely setting up. Jumpluff can additionally put foes to sleep with Sleep Powder, which can make cleaning for Zangoose easier. Dual screens support from Electrode augments Zangoose's bulk, which is useful for giving it an easier time with both setting up and stomaching attacks subsequent to using Belly Drum. Electrode is also capable of generating momentum with Explosion or Volt Switch. As a late-game cleaner, Zangoose appreciates being paired with strong wallbreakers like Aurorus that can pave the way for Zangoose to finish teams off by either heavily damaging or removing physically bulky Pokemon like Tangela. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Ferroseed and Qwilfish is appreciated, as the chip damage can be useful for guaranteeing certain KOs such as on Skuntank with +6 Quick Attack. Entry hazards being up also prevents Sturdy users like Regirock and Golem from taking one hit and KOing Zangoose in return. Entry hazard removers like Swanna, Kabutops, and Rotom-F can prove useful for limiting the damage that Zangoose has to take prior to using Belly Drum, which gives it an easier time setting up and subsequently cleaning. Swanna is also capable of checking Fighting-types, specifically Gurdurr, for Zangoose as well as threatening physically bulky Pokemon like Alolan Persian and Sableye with Supersonic Skystrike.</p>"

In reality though, it struggles much more than one would think due to lacking bulk, an average Speed tier, and a reliance on Sucker Punch without STAB to hit faster threats, leaving it open to offensive pressure from the likes of Stoutland and Pinsir. It also receives some competition from fellow Poison-types in Skuntank, Haunter, and Victreebel, as they have additional utility such as Defog, Destiny Bond, and Strength Sap, respectively, and they all sport better Speed tiers and a secondary typing.</p>",

    "overview": "<p>Lunatone's only niche is to attempt to sweep using Rock Polish to outspeed most Pokemon in the tier, but unfortunately, Lunatone faces major competition from Omastar as a setup sweeper due to Omastar dealing much more damage than Lunatone. Lunatone's typing hinders it greatly, as it is weak to common typings such as Dark, Water, and Bug and is susceptible to priority such as Sucker Punch from Pokemon like Skuntank. Furthermore, Lunatone is quite slow before a Rock Polish, and common offensive Pokemon in the tier such as Primeape, Kabutops, and Floatzel are able to outspeed it and take it out with ease, and poor physical bulk and a bad defensive typing limit its ability to actually set up. Lunatone finds itself lacking the power to hit bulkier opposing Pokemon such as Eelektross and Jellicent, and these Pokemon are able to whittle it down with their STAB moves.</p>",
    "sets": {"Offensive": {"description": "<p>Lunatone has to rely on Rock Polish to have a better chance of beating faster offensive threats and proceeds to try and hit as hard as it can.

If you're looking for an offensive setup sweeper, Omastar is preferred over Lunatone because of its far better attacking power and easier time setting up.</p>"}},

  "Whiscash": {
    "overview": "<p>With access to Dragon Dance, a fairly rare move for Pokemon in PU, and a typing that allows it to resist types that are fairly common in PU, Whiscash may seem like a good choice for a setup sweeper. However, in reality, it has horrible offensive and defensive stats that make it extremely difficult to do damage and seem like a threat.

Instead, one could go with a more consistent Shell Smash sweeper such as Carracosta or Omastar. Carracosta and Omastar are better sweepers not only because they have good coverage and can beat Pokemon that would normally check them, but also because of their better offensive and defensive stats. These two Shell Smash users also have better bulk and are much harder to revenge kill than Whiscash, resulting in them being much better choices for sweepers.</p>"}},

  "Claydol": {
    "overview": "<p>Claydol has somewhat of a niche in its access to both Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock. While it's not the only viable Pokemon to get both of these moves, it has other advantages such as its typing; Ground / Psychic is a reasonable defensive typing that allows Claydol to serve as a switch-in to Rock- and Ground-types such as Lycanroc and Alolan Dugtrio, while also giving Claydol a means to defeat traditional Psychic-resists such as Skuntank and Metang. It also gives Claydol a notable niche in being both resistant to Stealth Rock and immune to all other entry hazards thanks to Levitate. Finally, its typing also gives Claydol a good offensive matchup against various hazard setters and removers such as Aggron and Hitmonchan. However, while it does have great defensive stats, its HP is extremely underwhelming, preventing Claydol from being able to take a large number of hits, especially with its lack of recovery. Its offensive presence is very mediocre, preventing it from picking up many OHKOs such as Earth Power on Skuntank and leaving it as setup fodder for Pokemon such as Jynx and Calm Mind Oricorio-E. While its typing is good in various ways, it gives Claydol a bad matchup against spinblockers such as Jellicent and Oricorio-G, as well as against common offensive Pokemon such as Torterra and Ludicolo. Alolan Sandslash is rightfully the more popular pick for a Pokemon with both Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock. This is because of its better defensive typing that allows it to check more offensive threats such as Aurorus and Oricorio-G. Furthermore, even if they don't have access to Rapid Spin, Pokemon such as Mudsdale and Regirock largely outclass Claydol as a Stealth Rock user with their better bulk. The same can be said of Rapid Spin users such as Hitmonchan and Kabutops who provide a vastly stronger offensive presence.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Leftovers gives Claydol better longevity but leaves it with a much worse matchup against Dark-types and Pursuit trappers like Skuntank and gives it a harder time switching into Pokemon such as Gurdurr. Wiki Berry serves as a one-time recovery for Claydol, but it has the same problem as Leftovers. Groundium Z can allow Claydol to OHKO Skuntank, KO Regirock after an Earth Power, and avoid the increased damage from Knock Off, but overall, Claydol isn't worth using a Z-Move slot on. Psyshock can be run over Psychic in order to pick up 2HKOs on Pokemon such as Roselia and Hitmonchan, but Gurdurr is a much more prevalent target, making Psychic better. Similarly, Earthquake does additional damage to specially defensive targets such as Lanturn and Jynx, but has limited use and is overall inferior to Earth Power. An offensive set can be run to pick up OHKOs on Pokemon such as Skuntank but struggles due to Claydol's mediocre offensive stats.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Oricorio-G, Silvally-Ghost, and Jellicent can all switch in to block Rapid Spin, have little fear from Claydol's other attacks bar Toxic, and can 2HKO Claydol with their super effective STAB attacks. Others such as Haunter can potentially switch in but risk being OHKOed by Claydol's Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attackers</strong>: Various Pokemon such as Ludicolo, Rotom-F, and Abomasnow all OHKO Claydol with their super effective STAB moves with little to no prior damage. All of the previously mentioned Pokemon notably also resist or are immune to Claydol's Earth Power. Even with Claydol's Colbur Berry still intact, Dark-types such as Alolan Raticate and Absol beat it one-on-one. Pokemon such as Aurorus OHKO Claydol but take a decent amount of damage in the process.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers such as Type: Null and Spiritomb can set up freely on Claydol while resting off Toxic damage. Others such as Torterra, Leafeon and Pinsir can also give Claydol a hard time if it isn't running Toxic.</p>",

      "Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Claydol's main role is to remove entry hazards, so Rapid Spin is crucial. It can also run Stealth Rock, but if another teammate is already running it, Toxic should be used to cripple bulky Pokemon that take little from Claydol otherwise such as Cryogonal and Articuno. Psychic is run in order to 2HKO Gurdurr, while Earth Power 2HKOes Skuntank.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Colbur Berry allows Claydol to avoid the 2HKO from Skuntank's Crunch or Dark Pulse while also reducing damage from coverage moves such as Gurdurr's Knock Off. The Speed EVs allow Claydol to outspeed Jellicent, Aggron, and Modest Aurorus.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Claydol should switch in to take resisted hits from Pokemon such as Hitmonchan and Lycanroc, but it has to watch out for being worn down. Furthermore, some Pokemon that Claydol can check have other moves that do a lot to it or cripple it, such as Aggron's Heavy Slam, Primeape's U-Turn, and Mudsdale's Toxic. However, if it does manage to come in, Claydol often forces the foe out and can use this as an opportunity to set up Stealth Rock or remove entry hazards. If there are hazards on your side of the field, Claydol can lure in spinblockers such as Jellicent and cripple them with Toxic instead. If Claydol isn't running Toxic, it can still lure the spinblocker but instead double switch to a Pursuit trapper or a strong breaker such as Drampa that can take advantage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Ferroseed, Qwilfish, and Roselia can stack Spikes on top of Claydol's Stealth Rock, with the former two also being able to wear down Pokemon such as Skuntank and the latter providing a solid switch-in to Jellicent. Conversely, Pokemon that fear being worn down by entry hazards such as Aurorus and Choice Specs Jellicent appreciate Claydol's ability to remove them. Flying-types such as Dodrio and Scyther also enjoy Stealth Rock being off the field and can serve as checks to Grass-types such as Victreebel, Lurantis, and Ludicolo. However, these same Grass-types also make for good teammates, as they can help against Water-types such as Omastar and Jellicent. Pursuit users such as Stoutland and Spiritomb can trap and deal great damage to Ghost-types such as Oricorio-G and Silvally-Ghost, which greatly limits their spinblocking capabilities. Ghost-types can also spinblock for Claydol, while Primeape can ward off Defog users with Defiant. All of these Pokemon, as well as other offensive threats such as Kangaskhan and Lycanroc, also benefit from Claydol's hazards and Toxic wearing down the opposing team.</p>"

  "Cradily": {
    "overview": "<p>Cradily is a fairly niche defensive Stealth Rock setter that manages to set itself apart with unique resistances and immunities. Its good bulk and access to reliable recovery allow it to consistently set up Stealth Rock multiple times in a match while checking strong threats such as Jellicent. Cradily's unique type combination and access to Storm Drain give it useful immunities and resistances to Water, Normal, and Electric, allowing it to check Pokemon such as Jellicent, Kangaskhan, and Eelektross. However, Cradily is highly susceptible to common Ice- and Fighting-types such as Aurorus and Throh. Additionally, many Water- and Normal-types pack Ice- or Fighting-type coverage, meaning Cradily is not a reliable counter to Pokemon such as Omastar and Stoutland. Base 81 offenses make Cradily unable to do much damage against anything that resists its STAB moves, forcing it to rely on badly poisoning them with Toxic. It is terribly slow and thus usually forced to take two hits when switching in, limiting its ability to switch into strong hits and set up Stealth Rock. Being passive can also invite setup sweepers that are not worried about Toxic such as Gurdurr and Oricorio-G. All of these flaws mean that Cradily faces severe competition from other Stealth Rock setters such as Regirock and Torterra.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Earthquake is an option to hit Skuntank and Alolan Sandslash harder, but Cradily barely has room to run two STAB attacks to begin with. A Curse or Swords Dance set can be used with Seed Bomb and Rock Slide, but it is hard to sweep with, as Cradily is slow and weak even when boosted. Rocky Helmet can be run over Leftovers to provide chip damage against contact moves, but the lack of passive recovery makes it harder to set up Stealth Rock and makes Cradily more reliant on Recover to keep itself healthy. Mirror Coat can be used to get surprise KOs against foes such as Drampa, but it's not very consistent and Cradily is already starved for moveslots. Ancient Power makes better use of Storm Drain than Rock Slide but can allow Calm Mind Oricorio-E and Oricorio-G to set up on Cradily.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Hitmonchan, Primeape, and Gurdurr can all OHKO or 2HKO Cradily with their super effective STAB attacks. Hitmonchan can also remove Stealth Rock set by Cradily, while Gurdurr does not mind switching into Toxic thanks to its Guts ability.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Metang, Ferroseed and Alolan Sandslash can freely switch in on Cradily and set up entry hazards or remove Cradilyâ€™s Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Cradily is extremely susceptible to chip damage, and Toxic poison prevents it from reliably countering any of the threats it could normally switch into, as they are free to spam attacks until the Toxic damage increases to lethal levels. In particular, Toxic Spikes from Pokemon such as Qwilfish and Roselia, the latter which can easily switch into Cradily, can severely cripple its effectiveness.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: If Cradily lacks Rock Slide, Ice-types such as Aurorus, Abomasnow, and Articuno can freely switch in and threaten it with super effective Ice-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers that are not crippled by Toxic such as Calm Mind Clefairy and Safeguard Bellossom fear nothing from Cradily and can break through it once enough boosts have been accumulated.</p>",

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Toxic is Cradily's main way of dealing damage and pressuring certain setup sweepers such as Ludicolo. Rock Slide is the preferred STAB move, as it allows Cradily to pressure common threats such as Oricorio-G and Swanna. Giga Drain is an option to beat Water-types such as Carracosta and Gastrodon while providing additional recovery. Whichever move is chosen, Cradily finds itself incapable of doing significant damage to certain key threats, so running both Rock Slide and Giga Drain in lieu of Toxic is an option, albeit one which leaves Cradily far more susceptible to setup sweepers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Calm nature should be used over a Careful nature when running Giga Drain over Rock Slide. Leftovers gives Cradily some passive recovery, allowing it to rely less on Recover. Storm Drain allows Cradily to better switch into Water-type Pokemon like Ludicolo.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Find opportunities to bring in Cradily early-game to set up Stealth Rock, ideally as quickly as possible. Use Recover to keep Cradily as healthy as possible so it can switch into Pokemon such as Eelektross and Swanna and set up Stealth Rock multiple times in a match. Certain stronger attackers that Cradily could normally counter such as Ludicolo are capable of 2HKOing it with only slight prior chip damage. Bring Cradily into Water-type Pokemon like Jellicent, Lanturn, and Carracosta and force them out with the threat of Giga Drain or Toxic. Use these forced switches as opportunities to set up Stealth Rock or use Recover if Cradily is not healthy. Avoid using Cradily's STAB move early in the match to make the opponent wary of switching in Pokemon like Abomasnow and Oricorio-E that can switch into Cradily depending on its STAB move. Make use of Cradily's immunity to Water to ease prediction against opposing Water-type Pokemon like Carracosta and Ludicolo, as they are less likely to use Water-type moves as long as Cradily is healthy. Cradily should avoid Toxic at all costs from Pokemon such as Ferroseed, which can cripple it very badly, and super effective coverage moves from Pokemon it can otherwise counter. Scouting for lures such as Z-Focus Punch Kangaskhan will drastically increase Cradily's survivability.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cradily is best fit on bulkier teams, so it should be paired with other defensive Pokemon. Cradily appreciates Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon gone, as they are immune to Toxic and resist Giga Drain. Musharna is able to threaten Poison-types with Psychic, and Gurdurr takes on Steel-types while having Guts to absorb status. Cradily is vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes. Defog users such as Skuntank and Swanna make for good partners, with Skuntank in particular being able to absorb Toxic Spikes. Fighting-type checks such as Oricorio-G and Qwilfish are very valuable partners for Cradily. Cleric support from Pokemon such as Lanturn and Articuno can be used to remove status from Cradily and its team. Fire-type Pokemon like Combusken and Simisear appreciate Storm Drain support from Cradily. Meanwhile, Cradily benefits Rock-, Ground-, Fire-, and Flying-types by countering many Water- and Electric-types. It can also be a good partner for physically frail Pokemon such as Cryogonal, as it can discourage Normal-type wallbreakers like Stoutland from freely spamming their STAB moves.</p>"

Its horrendous typing gives it few useful resistances and weaknesses to common types like Water and Rock, which also makes it weak to Stealth Rock on top of being vulnerable to every other entry hazard. This, combined with its very low Speed stat, makes it hard for Armaldo to remove entry hazards as consistently as other spinners, as it'll often be taking a lot of damage in the process. It also can't remove entry hazards against common setters like Aggron and Regirock.

  "Kecleon": {
    "overview": "<p>Due to its high special bulk and unique offensive attributes, Kecleon can make a good user of Assault Vest, able to check a majority of special attackers in the tier, including Alolan Raichu, Simisear, and Oricorio-G. Its Dark / Fighting coverage between Knock Off and Drain Punch can be tricky to switch into, especially with Protean giving Kecleon STAB for every move. Furthermore, Kecleon has useful priority in Shadow Sneak that can let it revenge kill threats like Jynx and Oricorio-G, and it also has access to Sucker Punch. Protean can make Kecleon difficult to play around because it can change its typing to resist or become immune to the opposing Pokemon's attacks, such as clicking Shadow Sneak in front of a Fighting-type. Unfortunately, poor physical bulk and awful Speed make Kecleon easily taken out by physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Absol. Additionally, Kecleon struggles greatly with status, and due to its only moderate Attack stat, it is easy to wall with bulkier Pokemon like Mudsdale and Gastrodon. While Kecleon may face competition with other Assault Vest tanks like Eelektross and Hitmonchan which offer better role compression, its unique priority and Protean coverage give it a niche.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fake Out can be run in the last slot to provide reliable dual priority, although it is fairly weak and does not hit Pokemon super effectively. Trick Room can be used with a Life Orb set as an individual sweeper or as part of dedicated Trick Room teams. Kecleon can also use a Life Orb set with Speed investment that can break more walls, but it sacrifices most of its special bulk and faces competition from faster or stronger attackers like Absol and Aggron. Iron Tail can be used to hit Fairy-types, although they are not too common and Clefairy already fears Knock Off. Kecleon has several special coverage options like Fire Blast to hit Tangela and Grass Knot to hit Gastrodon. However, they only hit very specific Pokemon and you have to sacrifice either a coverage move or priority move to run them. Kecleon can run a fully special set to take advantage of this coverage, but it is very weak. Return or Double-Edge can be used as a powerful neutral attack, but this doesn't help Kecleon break through any specific Pokemon, and Kecleon would usually prefer another move. Kecleon has the bulk and movepool to run a special wall set with Recover and maximum EV investment in HP and Special Defense, but it is vulnerable to status and outclassed by Clefairy and Audino. Kecleon can set Stealth Rock, although it usually prefers another move and it cannot run this move with Assault Vest.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Pokemon such as Mudsdale, Poliwrath, and Gastrodon can easily avoid a 2HKO from Kecleon's attacks and cripple it with status, and Gastrodon can also recover off the damage.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Kecleon has poor physical bulk and can be easily outsped and killed by Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Kabutops. Certain Fighting-types like Gurdurr and Hitmonchan threaten Kecleon as well, but they may find it difficult if Kecleon has already transformed into a Ghost-type.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Kecleon is easily crippled by burn from moves like Jellicent's Will-O-Wisp and Gastrodon's Scald, and Toxic from Pokemon like Regirock and Lanturn wears it down easily.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is Kecleon's strongest move in most situations and provides utility by removing items. Drain Punch recovers health and provides good coverage with Knock Off. Shadow Sneak is a reliable priority attack that lets Kecleon revenge kill Jynx and Alolan Raichu and annoy Fighting-types thanks to Protean. Sucker Punch is an additional priority option that is stronger than Shadow Sneak and is better for chip damage versus Pokemon such as Stoutland, although it's not reliable and can be played around with non-attacking moves. Alternatively, Power-Up Punch boosts Kecleon's Attack, allowing it to break bulkier Pokemon like Clefairy and giving it a chance to sweep unprepared teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>84 EVs in Speed are used to let Kecleon outspeed uninvested base 50 Speed Pokemon such as Audino. The remaining EVs are dumped into HP to increase Kecleon's overall bulk. Assault Vest helps Kecleon easily tank most special attacks. Protean is the best ability as it gives Kecleon STAB bonus for each move and also changes Kecleon's typing, which can often be used to its advantage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kecleon should function as a special tank and switch-in to special attackers such as Omastar and Oricorio-G throughout the game. Early-game, Kecleon should generally be used to annoy bulkier Pokemon with its Dark / Fighting coverage while tanking hits. Knock Off should be used the most to remove Pokemon's items on the switch, and Drain Punch can be used to recover small amounts of health and hit Fighting-weak Pokemon. Use Protean to your advantage, such as using Shadow Sneak in front of a Fighting-type or using Drain Punch to prevent Dark-types from being able to revenge kill Kecleon. You can even block Rapid Spin by using Shadow Sneak if necessary. Protean can easily become a disadvantage if you're not careful though, such as getting Pursuit trapped while transformed into a Ghost-type. If you're running Power-Up Punch, Kecleon should use it against weaker special attackers like Eelektross after its checks and counters have been eliminated or worn down, giving it a chance of sweeping teams. Be careful not to wear Kecleon down too much if it is needed to check special sweepers like Simisear later on in the game or revenge kill Pokemon with its priority.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Physical tanks like Jellicent and Qwilfish take physical attacks and resist Fighting whereas Kecleon takes special attacks for them. Mudsdale makes for a good entry hazard setter for teams with Kecleon, which is important because Kecleon appreciates the chip damage to pick foes off with its priority. Pokemon weak to Psychic-types and Ghost-types appreciate Kecleon's support, so Fighting-types like Gurdurr make good partners. Gurdurr is also able to absorb Will-O-Wisp for Kecleon and take on strong physical attackers like Kangaskhan that Kecleon hates. Kecleon helps take on other special attackers as well, such as Swanna, Simisear, and Oricorio-G. Balanced teams that have physical tanks but are lacking in terms of special bulk will appreciate Kecleon functioning as a check to almost any special attacker. Special wallbreakers like Simisear and Choice Specs Aurorus will help break the physical walls like Gastrodon that wall Kecleon. Status support is appreciated because of how Kecleon gives a free switch to common walls that use Will-O-Wisp or Toxic like Gastrodon and Jellicent. Heal Bell support from Pokemon like Clefairy can keep Kecleon healthy, and even simply Toxic-immune Pokemon like Alolan Sandslash and Skuntank can be helpful for this reason. Skuntank also provides hazard removal and removed Toxic Spikes, which helps Kecleon check special attackers over the course of the game without getting worn down too quickly.</p>"

Besides, it gets Pursuit trapped or revenge killed incredibly easily by threats like Skuntank. Even its immunity to sleep isn't unique enough to be a niche, as many Grass-types like Victreebel, Abomasnow, and Tangela are also immune to Spore and Sleep Powder anyway.

Tropius struggles against the latter especially due to its Grass / Flying typing, which gives it a Stealth Rock weakness which heavily reduces its longevity. Low Speed hinders Tropius as well and makes even harder to set up Substitute since offensive Pokemon like Lycanroc and Aurorus are able to outspeed it and force it out.</p>",

It is recommended to use Tangela as a defensive Grass-type because Tangela isn't as easily forced out as Tropius since Tangela's colossal physical bulk allows it to tank a number of hits compared to Tropius. Furthermore, Tangela is able to run Knock Off and Sleep Powder to cripple opposing Pokemon, providing significantly more defensive utility than Tropius.</p>"}},

It also has a solid ability in Levitate, making it a pivot into certain Pokemon such as Mudsdale. However, this all falls apart when one looks at Chimecho's stats and typing, which are pretty bad for the type of Pokemon it is supposed to be. There are plenty of Psychic-type in the tier which provide similar utility while still being vastly more competent choices, such as Musharna and Claydol.

  "Absol": {
    "overview": "<p>Absol has a fearsome Attack stat, which in conjunction with Knock Off and Choice Band makes it very hard to switch into. Its good coverage options in Superpower and Play Rough allow it to hit Steel-, Dark-, and Fighting-types like Aggron, Shiftry, Hitmonchan, and Gurdurr. It also has access to Swords Dance to further its wallbreaking potential and Sucker Punch, which makes it a very useful tool against offensive Pokemon and can often be used to sweep after a boost. However, Absol relies greatly on Sucker Punch to outspeed faster Pokemon because of its rather lacking base 75 Speed stat, which can be played around with passive moves like Substitute from Pokemon like Oricorio-G. It's also still easily revenge killed by Pokemon like Silvally-Fairy and Alolan Persian, which don't care about Sucker Punch. Due to its lackluster bulk, Absol can easily get KOed throughout the match in general. Finally, Absol sees heavy competition as a Dark-type for a team slot due to the presence of Alolan Raticate and Skuntank; the former has a lot more power behind its moves thanks to Hustle, while the latter provides a lot more utility and is a lot more easy to fit on a team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Pursuit can be used to force mind games against Pokemon like Haunter, Jynx, and Alolan Raichu, which may try to switch out fearing Sucker Punch or Knock Off; it's also useful to take a chunk out of certain Pokemon that cannot touch Absol like Sableye and Bronzor, which will want to switch out. A set utilizing a Choice Scarf can be used to naturally outspeed Pokemon like Alolan Raichu and Oricorio-G, but this will mean Absol has to give up its ability to pick off teams with Swords Dance and Sucker Punch. Lum Berry can be used to avoid a status ailment like a burn or paralysis, which otherwise cripples Absol's sweeping potential greatly, and it also lets Absol set up a Swords Dance more easily. Substitute can ease up prediction and avoid status ailments as well, but this will mean Absol has to give up a moveslot that is vital for its coverage and overall usefulness. Taunt and Magic Coat can also be useful but they are too situational to deserve a moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan, Primeape, and Gurdurr can all threaten Absol with their respective STAB moves; Gurdurr can switch into Play Rough once and threaten it with Mach Punch, while Hitmonchan and Primeape can revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types like Silvally-Fairy and Granbull can switch in on almost any move from Absol, but they have to be wary of the rare Iron Tail. Clefairy can also be used as a check, but it tends to struggle against Absol if it's boosted. Clefairy also has to watch out for Knock Off, since the loss of its Eviolite greatly cuts into its bulk.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status ailments like burn, paralysis, and poison from Pokemon like Jellicent, Regirock, and Audino can cut Absol's power, Speed, or longevity, crippling its ability to wallbreak and sweep, but these Pokemon have to be wary of Absol's Knock Off or coverage moves like Superpower, in Regirock's case.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Physically defensive Pokemon like Tangela, Mudsdale, and Regirock can check Absol, but they don't like having their items removed by Knock Off and, once weakened enough, can be KOed by a boosted Knock Off. Regirock also has to watch out for Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Because of Absol's lackluster bulk, it can easily get worn down and KOed by common priority moves like Aqua Jet and Fake Out from Pokemon like Floatzel and Kangaskhan, and especially Mach Punch from Hitmonchan and Gurdurr.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sucker Punch allows Absol to heavily damage or revenge kill Choice Scarf users such as Alolan Sandslash and Rotom-F, as well as naturally faster threats such as Alolan Raichu and Dodrio. Superpower is used to dent or KO Steel-, Dark-, and Rock-type Pokemon such as Ferroseed, Skuntank, and Carracosta. Alternatively, Play Rough can be used to hit expected Fighting- and Dark-type switch-ins such as Gurdurr and Alolan Persian hard. However, Absol is already able to 2HKO other Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan and Combusken without it, Gurdurr doesn't appreciate losing its item to Knock Off, and Absol often prefers being able to heavily damage walls such as Regirock and common Steel-types such as Alolan Sandslash. Pursuit grants Absol the ability to function as one of the most powerful trappers in the tier, allowing it deal great amounts of damage to diverse threats such as Eelektross, Oricorio-G, and Cryogonal as well as Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Haunter and Musharna. Iron Tail is an option that gives Absol a way of dealing with Fairy-types that normally wall it such as Silvally-Fairy and Clefairy, but these threats aren't nearly as common, and Absol often has a hard time fitting it into its moveset.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature can be utilized to outspeed Pokemon such as Victreebel, Ludicolo, and Adamant Stoutland, but Absol usually prefers to hit as hard as possible. Justified allows Absol to get a +1 Attack boost off of Dark-type attacks such as Knock Offs from Sableye and Alolan Persian.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set can be used early- to mid-game to remove items from physical walls such as Regirock, Tangela, and Gurdurr. Attempt to bring in Absol through slow pivots such as Eelektross and Lanturn, since its low defenses only allow it to switch in safely on passive Pokemon such as Sableye or expected Psychic-type moves from the likes of Musharna. Be wary of Colbur Berry from Pokemon such as Musharna and Jellicent, since the former is able to KO Absol with Dazzling Gleam, while the latter can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Absol's ability to force out switch-ins turns it into a threatening Pursuit trapper. When facing Psychic- or Ghost-types such as Spiritomb and Alolan Raichu or specially defensive Pokemon such as Lanturn and Cryogonal, you must attempt to predict if your opponent would want to switch them out or stay in and decide to Pursuit trap them or utilize another move as appropriate. Getting rid of specially defensive Pokemon allows special sweepers to potentially win late-game, while removing Ghost- and Psychic-types helps Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Throh. Utilize Superpower to hit expected Steel-, Dark-, and Rock-type switch-ins such as Alolan Sandslash, Alolan Persian, and Regirock for maximum damage. Play Rough can catch Fighting-types on the switch such as Gurdurr, effectively 2HKOing it even before its Eviolite has been removed. Both of these options should be utilized on predicted switch-ins and can be taken advantage of by the opponent, such as the drop in Attack and Defense after Superpower, so you should attempt to be careful of which move you're letting Absol be locked into. Furthermore, being locked into Sucker Punch can result in sweepers such as Alolan Raichu and Oricorio-G attempting to set up on Absol, so only resort to this move when the opposing Pokemon aren't given this opportunity or if you have another way of dealing with these threats. Though better suited for early- to mid-game, the amount of power packed in Sucker Punch can allow Choice Band Absol to function as a late-game cleaner; however, this requires great amounts of chip on Choice Scarf users such as Primeape, as well as the prior removal of Pokemon such as Gurdurr and Silvally-Fairy.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazards from the likes of Mudsdale and Qwilfish wear down answers to Absol such as Silvally-Fairy and Tangela. Both are also able to threaten or beat Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and certain Hitmonchan sets, which in return supports Absol. Other Fighting-type checks such as special Victreebel and Musharna are able to counter Gurdurr and Throh; in return, Absol is able to threaten specially defensive Pokemon such as Cryogonal and Eelektross. Musharna is also able to allow Absol to be more of a nuisance late-game with Healing Wish while also utilizing Future Sight to help Absol spam its STAB moves more freely, securing damage and forcing in Pokemon that won't appreciate its damage output. Slow pivots such as Eelektross and Lanturn are able to bring in Absol safely, which is highly necessary due to its fragility. Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Primeape appreciate Absol's ability to Pursuit trap Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Sableye and Musharna. Choice Scarf Primeape can even use U-turn on their expected switch-ins, allowing Absol to Pursuit trap them or remove their items with Knock Off. Entry hazard removers such as Alolan Sandslash value Choice Band Absol's ability to Pursuit trap common spinblockers such as Jellicent and Sableye. Defog users like Silvally-Fairy are able to check Fighting-types like Gurdurr for Absol as well as provide pivoting, while Absol is able to cripple Stealth Rock setters like Mudsdale and Regirock. Physical cleaners such as Carracosta and Lycanroc greatly benefit from Choice Band Absol removing Eviolite from physical walls such as Tangela, Regirock, and Gurdurr. Special sweepers like Omastar, Alolan Raichu, and Combusken appreciate Choice Band Absol's ability to Pursuit trap and remove items from specially defensive Pokemon such as Lanturn, Eelektross, and Cryogonal; Alolan Raichu also appreciates Absol getting rid of Ghost-types like Haunter, while Combusken appreciates its ability to deal with Psychic-types like Musharna.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sucker Punch lets Absol handle faster Pokemon like Dodrio, Simisear, and Floatzel, which can threaten Absol because of how frail and slow it is. Superpower allows Absol to hit Dark-types like Shiftry, Alolan Persian, and Alolan Raticate for super effective damage. It also hits Steel- and Rock-types like Aggron, Carracosta, and Regirock for greater damage than Knock Off or Sucker Punch. Play Rough hits the aforementioned Dark-types without having to deal with the Attack and Defense drops from Superpower while also hitting troublesome Fighting-types like Hitmonchan, Primeape, and Gurdurr for a good amount of damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature maximizes Absol's wallbreaking potential, while a Jolly nature allows Absol to Speed tie with positive-natured base 75 Speed Pokemon and outspeed neutral-natured base 85 Speed Pokemon like Pinsir. Justified gives Absol an Attack boost whenever it gets hit by a Dark-type move like Knock Off. Life Orb further enhances Absol's damage output at the cost of 1/10th of its HP every turn it attacks, while Darkinium Z gives Absol a one-time nuke with 140 Base Power and allows Absol to switch into Knock Off for a free boost more easily without the risk of losing its item.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Absol to punch holes early- to mid-game if this allows a teammate of Absol to clean up later, but Sucker Punch in conjunction with Swords Dance can be useful to pull off a late-game sweep if the opposing team has been weakened. Get Absol in on weaker attacks that it resists or attacks that it's immune to like Knock Off, Psyshock, and Psychic from Pokemon like Shiftry, Alolan Raticate, and Alolan Raichu to get a turn to set up or use Sucker Punch. VoltTurn is another way to get Absol in and prevent it from taking a hit, and switching into Knock Off is especially useful if Absol is carrying Darkinium Z, as Knock Off will not be boosted and Absol will receive an Attack boost from Justified. Absol can switch in on passive Pokemon like Sableye to threaten the opposing team with Knock Off or set up a Swords Dance to sweep or weaken the opposing team for its teammates. Try to force Pokemon like Musharna and Alolan Raichu out to set up a Swords Dance and sweep if its checks and counters are weakened, but be aware that Musharna can run Colbur Berry and that Alolan Raichu can play around Sucker Punch with Nasty Plot, making it very threatening if Absol runs out of Sucker Punch PP. Use Play Rough whenever you predict Fighting- or Dark-types like Gurdurr, Primeape, Hitmonchan, Alolan Persian, and Absol to switch in. However, Absol can't stay in on these Fighting-types because they can and most likely will threaten it with their respective STAB moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon like Qwilfish and Roselia can set up entry hazards to wear down many of Absol's common switch-ins like Hitmonchan, Silvally-Fairy, and Regirock while also sponging super effective attacks for Absol. Absol can also take advantage of Psychic-types that might want to switch in on Qwilfish. Pokemon like Primeape and Hitmonchan appreciate Absol's ability to take advantage of the Ghost- and Psychic-types they struggle with; the former can also bring in Absol via U-turn. Pokemon that can switch into Fighting-type attacks like Victreebel and Oricorio-E greatly benefit Absol; in return, Absol can take advantage of the specially defensive walls that can threaten them such as Audino. Absol likes to be brought in via slow VoltTurn so it doesn't have to take a hit; Pokemon like Lanturn, Eelektross, and Silvally-Fairy can fill this role. Clerics like Altaria, Lanturn, and Healing Wish Musharna can remove status ailments like burn and paralysis from Absol, which otherwise greatly cripple it. Pokemon such as Primeape and Gurdurr appreciate Absol's ability to weaken Mudsdale, Qwilfish, and Tangela.</p>"

Despite working best as a decent Ice-type check, it is weak to Stealth Rock and many offensive threats like Kabutops, Lycanroc, and Victreebel are able to deal a lot of damage to it.

  "Huntail": {
    "overview": "<p>Huntail faces too much competition from other Shell Smash users in PU to ever be worth considering; Omastar and Turtonator have access to stronger Special Attack stats and STAB moves, while Carracosta has better bulk with access to a reliable priority attack in Aqua Jet. Huntail only has one small niche in its access to Sucker Punch, which gives it a tool to outspeed would-be revenge killers like Choice Scarf Dodrio. On the downside, finding setup opportunities with Huntail is difficult because it has mediocre bulk and doesn't have access to Solid Rock. Additionally, being susceptible to all form of entry hazards means that Huntail has to be preserved for late-game, since it gets worn down easily, making setup opportunities even more difficult. Also, unfortunately, even after a +2 Speed boost from Shell Smash, Huntail is easily revenge killed by faster foes such as Choice Scarf Primeape and Rotom-F, which take a +2 Sucker Punch. Furthermore, despite having Ice Beam, Huntail struggles at breaking through certain Grass-type Pokemon like Ferroseed and Abomasnow. Huntail also has trouble getting past bulky Water-types, like Gastrodon, which can wall it and thus prevent a sweep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fire can be used to OHKO Ferroseed after a +2 Special Attack boost, while Hidden Power Grass can be used to OHKO Gastrodon after the boost; however, finding slots for both of these moves can be hard, and not running Ice Beam means Pokemon like Drampa become annoying to deal with. Waterium Z is a final alternative that can be used for the immediate boost in power, but White Herb is preferred so priority users can't revenge kill Huntail as easily.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Water-types such as Gastrodon and Poliwrath resist Huntail's STAB attacks. Gastrodon can wear Huntail down with Earth Power, while Lanturn can take +2 Sucker Punch and get off big damage with Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon</strong>: Grass-types such as Lurantis and Abomasnow are big threats to Huntail. Lurantis sports excellent bulk, resists Huntail's Water-type attacks, tanks Ice Beam even at +2, and threatens back with Grass-type attacks. Abomasnow is also able to tank +2 Ice Beam. Ferroseed is especially annoying for Huntail with a combination of Thunder Wave, Leech Seed, and Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf users</strong>: Due to Huntail's mediocre Speed stat, it is outsped even at +2 by common Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Kabutops, both of which can also take a boosted Sucker Punch when healthy.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority attacks, such as Hitmonchan's Mach Punch and Absol's Sucker Punch, are threatening to Huntail, as its mediocre bulk prevents it from tanking these attacks if it is low on health. Kangaskhan has a special mention because it has dual priority, though Huntail can potentially play around it with Shell Smash.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sucker Punch allows Huntail to pick off weakened Choice Scarf users, which is important because Huntail is very slow. Ice Beam helps Huntail break through Grass-types such as Tangela and Torterra.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Naughty nature is used to avoid lowering power when using Ice Beam and lets Huntail be as strong and fast as possible. White Herb allows Huntail to preserve its defenses after a Shell Smash, making it less susceptible to priority attackers such as Hitmonchan. Water Veil allows Huntail to ignore Will-o-Wisp from Pokemon like Sableye and Spiritomb.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ideally, Huntail should be saved for late-game when Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Ferroseed are weakened enough for it to effectively sweep through the rest of the team. Huntail finds very few setup opportunities, so be careful in choosing when to set up. Using Shell Smash will often cost Huntail most of its health, so try to remove any entry hazards such as Toxic Spikes before attempting to set up. Furthermore, Huntail should avoid setting up if Choice Scarf users such as Swanna and Primeape are at full HP because they are faster than Huntail after +2 and Huntail can't score OHKOs with Sucker Punch without prior damage; however, Huntail can be used to punch holes early-game against more offensively oriented teams if standard checks are not present.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Huntail appreciates Memento support from Pokemon such as Jumpluff and Skuntank to make it easier for Huntail to set up with Shell Smash. Jumpluff is also a good partner for Huntail because it chips away at bulky Grass-types such as Ferroseed with Acrobatics. Huntail pairs well with wallbreakers such as Kangaskhan and Absol that can punch holes through the opposing team and remove Huntail's defensive answers so it has an easier time sweeping. In return, Huntail is able to severely weaken the former's checks such as Regirock. Huntail is frail, so being brought safely into the match from Volt Switch users such as Eelektross is ideal. Eelektross is especially good because it can pressure Huntail's checks such as Ferroseed, Gastrodon, and Choice Scarf Electric-types that revenge kill Huntail. Additionally, Huntail hates all sort of entry hazards, so Pokemon like Skuntank and Cryogonal are appreciated. Skuntank, in particular, can absorb Toxic Spikes and opt to lure Huntail's checks with Fire Blast and take them out, making it easier for Huntail to set up.</p>"

  "Gorebyss": {
    "overview": "<p>With access to Shell Smash, Gorebyss is able to serve as a setup sweeper and wallbreaker. Its nice Special Attack, powerful STAB move in Hydro Pump, and average coverage options all help Gorebyss in performing its roles. However, its low Speed largely hinders Gorebyss, making it much easier for Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Dodrio to revenge kill it, even after a Shell Smash. If Gorebyss has taken enough damage, it can also be revenge killed by priority users such as Skuntank, Kangaskhan, and Hitmonchan. This leads to large competition from Carracosta, which has priority in Aqua Jet to make up for its low Speed, better bulk, Solid Rock, a secondary STAB move in Stone Edge, and the ability to run a mixed set, making it even harder to stop after it sets up a Shell Smash. However, its biggest competition comes from Omastar, which is stronger, faster, and bulkier than Gorebyss and has a useful secondary typing to boot. Between Omastar and Carracosta, there is practically no reason to use Gorebyss in the current meta.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Surf can be a more reliable STAB option over Hydro Pump due to its higher accuracy, but it can be simply too weak at times, and it makes it easier for specially defensive Pokemon to wall Gorebyss. Scald is another option with even less power than Surf but with a chance to burn foes. Life Orb allows Gorebyss to constantly deal out a little more damage as it sweeps, but it can wear Gorebyss down over time, and it can leave Gorebyss more vulnerable against walls, faster foes, and priority users, making it generally less reliable than the other item options. Signal Beam is a coverage option that hits Grass-types, including Abomasnow and Ludicolo, which are neutral to Ice Beam, as well as Psychic-types such as Jynx, but this coverage is already accomplished by Hidden Power Fire, and if ran over Ice Beam, it leaves Gorebyss walled by Dragon-types such as Drampa and Altaria. Finally, Psychic can be run alongside Hidden Power Fire for almost perfect neutral coverage, but this leaves Gorebyss struggling more against certain bulky Water-types such as Lanturn.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Primeape, Dodrio, Rotom-F, and Alolan Raichu can still outspeed and OHKO Gorebyss even after a Shell Smash or with some chip damage if Gorebyss is using White Herb.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Lanturn and Poliwrath can take a hit, even when Gorebyss is at +2, and take little from Hydro Vortex, and they KO Gorebyss with Volt Switch or force it out with Circle Throw, respectively. However, Gorebyss can 2HKO both with +2 Hidden Power Grass. Pyukumuku ignores the stat boosts of Shell Smash thanks to Unaware and can stall Gorebyss with Toxic, but it can be stopped by Substitute. If Gorebyss is not running Hidden Power Grass, Gastrodon can take a hit before retaliating with Toxic or dealing a good amount of damage with Earth Power, but it is 2HKOed by Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: If Gorebyss is not running Waterium Z, certain specially defensive Pokemon such as Eelektross, Type: Null, Audino, and Clefairy can take a hit before KOing Gorebyss with Volt Switch or Return, or crippling it with Toxic or Thunder Wave in order to stop its sweep. Audino and Clefairy can be played around with Substitute. However, even without Waterium Z, they do not appreciate taking a +2 Hydro Pump and can still be KOed in situations with previous damage. Substitute and Hidden Power Fire can give Ferroseed trouble, which can otherwise take a hit and whittle Gorebyss down with a combination of Leech Seed, Protect, and Gyro Ball and cripple it with a potential Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: If Gorebyss has taken a good amount of damage in the process of setting up and sweeping, priority users such as Skuntank, Kangaskhan, Hitmonchan, and Shiftry can come in to KO Gorebyss without having to fear being outsped. This is especially easy if Gorebyss is at -1 defenses.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Encore Users</strong>: Faster Taunt users such as Skuntank, Sableye, and Alolan Persian can stop Gorebyss from being able to set up a Shell Smash, and either switch into a better matchup, cripple it with Thunder Wave, Toxic, or Will-O-Wisp, or go for a KO. However, none of them appreciate taking Hydro Vortex. Both Liepard and Volbeat can lock Gorebyss into Shell Smash with Encore while not minding the Speed boost due to Prankster, although they must stay wary that Gorebyss can bypass this for one turn using its Z-Move.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam gives Gorebyss coverage against Grass- and Dragon-types such as Victreebel, Drampa, and Altaria, which resist Hydro Pump. Hidden Power Grass hits Water-types such as Gastrodon, and can 2HKO other bulky Water-types such as Lanturn and Poliwrath after a Shell Smash. However, if running a Timid nature, Gorebyss can often fail to 2HKO Lanturn. Hidden Power Fire is an alternate option that gives Gorebyss a way to hit Jynx as well as certain Grass-types that only take neutral damage from Ice Beam, such as Ferroseed and Abomasnow. Substitute is another choice for the last slot, which protects Gorebyss from status moves such as Thunder Wave and Toxic, giving it a better matchup against special walls such as Clefairy and Audino. If Gorebyss can maintain its Substitute, it can also grant a layer of protection against Choice Scarf users such as Primeape. It is also notable that, when using a White Herb, Gorebyss can use Substitute on Ferroseed and essentially use it as setup fodder, as Ferroseed fails to break Gorebyss's Substitute with Gyro Ball when Gorebyss is at neutral defenses, even with +2 Speed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Modest is the preferred nature, as it allows Gorebyss to do as much damage as possible and break through bulkier foes such as Lanturn and Audino more easily. Timid is an alternate option that allows Gorebyss to outspeed a few more Pokemon, most notably Choice Scarf Kabutops. However, this is much more situational overall, as Gorebyss prefers the additional damage output when attempting to sweep. Waterium Z gives Gorebyss an accurate, one-time nuke, which is specifically useful for taking on specially defensive Pokemon such as Clefairy and Audino. Alternatively, White Herb negates the lowered defenses from Shell Smash, which allows Gorebyss to better take hits from faster Pokemon and priority users such as Primeape and Skuntank when sweeping, making it more difficult to offensively stop once it sets up. However, be wary that the White Herb can be unintentionally activated through other means such as Intimidate. Although neither of Gorebyssâ€™s abilities benefit it in most occasions, Swift Swim gives it a better matchup against rain teams and allows it to function decently well on said rain teams.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As a sweeper, Gorebyss can come in late-game, after its potential threats have been taken care of or at least crippled so it can ideally set up and sweep, potentially closing out the match. These threats include Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Dodrio and bulkier Pokemon such as Lanturn and Clefairy, especially if Gorebyss is not running Waterium Z. When being used as a wallbreaker, Gorebyss should be used mid- to late-game, using its high Special Attack and the Shell Smash boosts to break down bulkier foes such as Regirock and Tangela so that a teammate can come in and have an easier time cleaning the match afterwards. Gorebyss should be brought onto the field through a slow pivot such as Eelektross's Volt Switch or a Memento user such as Alolan Dugtrio in order to maintain as much health as possible. Gorebyss should set up against Pokemon that can do little to it, such as Audino, as they are forced out and can be used as setup fodder. If a Pokemon is Choice locked into a resisted move, such as Choice Scarf Alolan Sandslash locked into Icicle Crash, Gorebyss can also use it to set up a Shell Smash. However, be wary that they can do a decent amount of damage, so Gorebyss should often only use it to set up one Shell Smash at most.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers such as Lycanroc, Alolan Raichu, and Drampa can break down the bulky Pokemon that give Gorebyss trouble, such as Type: Null and Ferroseed, and Gorebyss can clean up for them in return. Faster Pokemon such as Primeape and Dodrio appreciate Gorebyss's ability to serve as a wallbreaker, as it can help weaken Pokemon that can stop them, such as Musdale and Gurdurr, before they come in to clean. Entry hazard setters such as Regirock, Ferroseed, and Qwilfish can also help against bulky foes like Type: Null, as the residual damage can potentially whittle them down to the point where Gorebyss can KO them. Type: Null can also support Gorebyss with a slow U-turn, which can serve as a reliable way to get Gorebyss on the field. Musharna can support Gorebyss with Healing Wish, which can potentially give it a second chance to set up and sweep. Regirock and Ferroseed can also provide support in Thunder Wave, which can cripple Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Dodrio and allow Gorebyss to outspeed them after a Shell Smash. Choice Scarf users can also be crippled by Knock Off users, such as Gurdurr, Alolan Raticate, and Absol. Knock Off can furthermore be used as a way to cripple certain bulky Pokemon, such as Assault Vest holders like Eelektross and Eviolite holders like Clefairy. Eelektross is a good Knock Off user, slow pivot, and check to certain Choice Scarf users that can revenge kill Gorebyss, such as Haunter and Oricorio-G. Gorebyss does not like to be whittled down by entry hazards because it needs to stay as healthy as possible in order to sweep, so it appreciates Defog and Rapid Spin users such as Skuntank, Hitmonchan, and Lurantis to remove the hazards. Memento users such as Alolan Dugtrio and Skuntank can bring Gorebyss without it having to take any damage in the process. They also weaken the opposing Pokemon, making it more easy for Gorebyss to set up a Shell Smash on them. Dual screen users such as Electrode can also give Gorebyss an easier time setting up. Gorebyss can be used on rain teams, in which Rain Dance users such as Volbeat and Liepard and other rain sweepers such as Ludicolo and Kabutops are appreciated.</p>"

However, it is very reliant on its Eviolite to shore up its only average defenses. The rest of Metang's stats are mediocre, with its somewhat underwhelming Attack and low Speed leaving it with little offensive presence against foes it does not have coverage for. Metang's lack of recovery causes it to be worn down easily, which limits its ability to switch into multiple foes throughout the match. This is furthered by Metang's weakness to common coverage moves from various Pokemon it switches into such as Kangaskhan's Earthquake and Aurorus's Earth Power. Finally, Metang faces competition as a Stealth Rock setter from Pokemon like Regirock, Mudsdale, and Alolan Sandslash, which all have various unique attributes and don't depend on Eviolite for their bulk, allowing them to run other items like Leftovers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Metang generally lacks any free slots in its main set, so it struggles to find space for its few alternate moves. However, Zen Headbutt gives Metang a secondary STAB move, giving it a better way to hit Water-types such as Poliwrath and Floatzel. It can also pick up some other notable KOs, such as the guaranteed OHKO on Primeape and 2HKO on Hitmonchan. Pursuit can deal chip damage on foes that try to switch out against it, which is especially useful for Psychic-types like Jynx.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Gastrodon, Jellicent, Poliwrath, and Ludicolo can easily switch into either of Metang's attacks, with the former three also having sources of recovery and the latter being able to outright 2HKO it. Other Water-types like Omastar and Lanturn can deal a lot of damage or potentially burn Metang with Scald, but they are heavily damaged by Earthquake. Many of these Pokemon do not enjoy taking a Toxic either.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Mudsdale can take multiple hits from Metang and 2HKO it in return; Choice Band variants can even OHKO it. Other Ground-types like Torterra, Golurk, and Claydol all outspeed Metang and 2HKO it while being able to take a hit, with the latter also being able to remove Stealth Rock. Alolan Dugtrio can KO Metang after it has taken a solid amount of damage, but it is otherwise OHKOed by Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Eviolite Removal</strong>: Since Metang depends on its Eviolite to take hits, it fears Knock Off users like Gurdurr, Shiftry, and Alolan Raticate. Trick and Switcheroo users like Rotom-F, Jynx, and Floatzel greatly cripple Metang, as on top of removing its Eviolite, they lock it into a single move.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Various Pokemon carry super effective coverage moves that can either 2HKO or 3HKO Metang and can greatly wear it down. This includes moves like Aurorus's Earth Power, Aggron and Kangaskhan's Earthquake, non-Swords Dance Dodrio's Knock Off, and Silvally-Fairy's Flamethrower. Certain Pokemon can even greatly dent Metang with neutral coverage moves such as Stoutland's Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Physically defensive Pokemon like Gastrodon, Sableye, and Tangela can all switch into any of Metang's attacks, with all of them additionally having sources of recovery. Then, they can cripple and wear down Metang with utility moves like Will-O-Wisp, Leech Seed, and Knock Off.</p>",

      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake provides coverage against certain Pokemon that don't mind Meteor Mash like Qwilfish and Lanturn while also 2HKOing certain foes like Skuntank and Aggron. Toxic can cripple bulky foes like Jellicent, Torterra, and Mudsdale and prevent Metang from being complete setup fodder for Pokemon such as Scyther and Musharna. Bullet Punch is an alternate option that can help Metang make up for its low Speed stat and allows it to pick off weakened foes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>176 EVs in Attack with an Adamant nature give Metang some offensive presence, allowing it to OHKO Lycanroc with Meteor Mash, 2HKO Qwilfish with Earthquake, and OHKO Jynx with Bullet Punch after Stealth Rock. The defensive investment enables Metang to avoid the 2HKO from non-Black Glasses Jolly Skuntank's Crunch and the 3HKO from Regirock's Earthquake. Clear Body prevents foes from lowering Metang's stats, most notably blocking the Attack drop from Qwilfish's Intimidate, stops Parting Shot users like Silvally-Fairy and Silvally-Dragon from pivoting out, and completely prevents Victreebel and Bellossom from recovering with Strength Sap, which can limit the opponent's willingness to use said moves throughout the match.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Metang's main goal is to set up Stealth Rock, and its main opportunity to do so is when it switches into and forces out foes like Victreebel, Stoutland, and Aurorus. However, it has to watch out for coverage moves like Aurorus's Earth Power. Furthermore, stay wary of how easily Metang can be worn down, especially if you want to save it to take a boosted hit from a Pokemon such as Lycanroc or Dodrio. Clefairy and Dodrio can lure Metang in and catch it off guard with their potential Knock Off. If Stealth Rock is already up, Metang can use Toxic to cripple incoming walls like Jellicent and Mudsdale. Metang can utilize Bullet Punch to revenge kill foes, although even Pokemon that are very frail or weak to Steel such as Haunter and Lycanroc have to be weakened a decent amount beforehand.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Pokemon appreciate Metang's Stealth Rock helping to wear down their targets, which means wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Drampa and setup sweepers such as Lycanroc and Jynx are good partners. Water- and Grass-types such as Jellicent, Ludicolo, Lurantis, and Bellossom can serve as checks for opposing Water- and Ground-types, and Metang can deal with some of their threats like Abomasnow and wear other threats down with Stealth Rock. Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate such as Altaria and Eelektross can serve as switch-ins for Ground-types, with Metang serving as a check for threats like Aurorus and Stoutland in return. Knock Off absorbers like Silvally-Fairy and Alolan Persian can help ensure that Metang doesn't have its Eviolite removed. Both can also give it chances to come in with Parting Shot, which ideally allows it to set up Stealth Rock, and Alolan Persian can also provide a source of recovery in Z-Parting Shot. Audino can supply a form of recovery for Metang in Wish while forming a decent defensive core with it. Primeape can utilize Defiant to take advantage of Defog users, while Ghost-types like Oricorio-G and Haunter serve as spinblockers, covering both forms of entry hazard removal. Other hazard setters such as Qwilfish and Roselia can stack their Spikes and Toxic Spikes alongside Metang's Stealth Rock to further wear the opposing team down. That being said, Metang doesn't enjoy hazards itself, so hazard removers make for good teammates Rapid Spin users like Kabutops and Hitmonchan are preferable, as they can remove hazards without the cost of Metang's own Stealth Rock with Defog.</p>"

  "Regirock": {
    "overview": "<p>Regirock's immense physical bulk and useful resistances to Normal-, Flying-, and Poison-type attacks from common Pokemon such as Kangaskhan, Oricorio-E, and Skuntank allow it many opportunities to cripple foes with Toxic or support its teammates by setting up Stealth Rock. Furthermore, given its access to Sunny Day and a useful ability in Sturdy that allows it to set up the move consistently, Regirock is adept in providing support to weather-based sweepers that are dependent on Chlorophyll being activated, making it an essential component of Sunny Day-based teams. Regirock is not without fault, however: its low Speed stat and weakness to ubiquitous Water-, Ground-, Grass-, and Fighting-type coverage moves leave it easily checked by offensive Pokemon like Jellicent, Golurk, Victreebel, and Gurdurr. Additionally, its inherently passive nature as a defensive Stealth Rock setter means that it can be overly reliant on Toxic to deal significant damage to Pokemon that have a type advantage over Regirock like Gastrodon. Regirock's lack of reliable recovery and vulnerability to entry hazards are detrimental to its longevity, which can in turn disallow Regirock to switch into the Pokemon that it is meant to check.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Regirock can run Thunder Wave over Toxic to potentially generate free turns of Leftovers recovery and decrease the Speed of faster attackers like Victreebel, but doing so would leave Regirock without a means to damage its defensive answers like Mudsdale. A more offensive Stealth Rock set consisting of Rockium Z, Stone Edge, Drain Punch, and Ice Punch can pressure common switch-ins like defensive Jellicent while still functioning as a reliable answer to Pokemon like Oricorio-E and Cryogonal, but it still struggles against common threats like Mudsdale and the lack of Leftovers recovery makes it otherwise less reliable as a Stealth Rock setter. Sturdy can be run on Stealth Rock Regirock in order to avoid being OHKOed by Pokemon such as Crabominable, but so few Pokemon are capable of OHKOing Regirock that it is rarely worth using over Clear Body.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Pyukumuku only fears Toxic from Regirock and is able to outlast it thanks to its access to Recover. Offensively inclined Water-types like Poliwrath and Omastar can tank any hit from Regirock and retaliate with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types like Lurantis are able to take any attack that Regirock can dish out. Additionally, Lurantis is able to use Regirock as setup fodder to boost its Special Attack via Contrary Leaf Storm. Grass-type sweepers like Shiftry and Ludicolo are able to threaten Regirock and force it to switch out, which grants them the opportunity to boost their offensive capabilities.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types like Torterra and Mudsdale take very little damage from Regirock's attacks and is able to Earthquake Regirock in return. However, they must be wary of being crippled by Toxic when switching into Regirock directly.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Strong Fighting-types such as Gurdurr, Hitmonchan, and Primeape resist Regirock's STAB Rock-type moves, and the latter two are able to heal off any HP lost in the encounter via Drain Punch. Gurdurr in particular is able to capitalize on Regirock's attempts at spreading status by boosting its Attack via Guts.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Even with Regirock's Special Defense investment, strong specially offensive wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Drampa and Fightinium Z Alolan Raichu are able to break through its defenses with a boosted Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Faster Taunt Users</strong>: Sableye and defensive variants of Jellicent can prevent Regirock from setting up Stealth Rock or Sunny Day for its teammates or from using Toxic in Sableye's case. Furthermore, Sableye and Jellicent have enough Defense to switch into Regirock directly and burn it on the following turn with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Given Regirock's lack of reliable recovery, passive sources of damage like Toxic and entry hazards can limit its ability to pivot into attacks for its teammates.</p>",

      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stone Edge is a more powerful alternative to Rock Slide, but its accuracy and PP make it somewhat unreliable and it can be PP stalled by Pokemon such as Articuno. Drain Punch lets Regirock threaten Ice-types like Alolan Sandslash and Aurorus and Normal-types like Kangaskhan, and it gains notable recovery from the aforementioned targets as well as Primeape with lowered Defense. Earthquake is an alternative that deals more damage to targets like Aggron and Skuntank and can be used to threaten Qwilfish upon switch-in, but it notably worsens Regirock's hail matchup. Toxic is used to cripple Regirock's regular switch-ins and places a timer on setup sweepers that might attempt to take advantage of Regirock's passive nature. Toxic is also Regirock's most reliable means of dealing significant damage to bulky Ground-types like Mudsdale and other physically defensive Pokemon with recovery like Jellicent and Tangela. Protect can be used over Toxic to scout for Choice-locked Pokemon like Primeape and Stoutland and stall for extra Leftovers recovery.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Clear Body is Regirock's ability of choice, as it blocks Parting Shot from Silvally formes and Alolan Persian. A Chople Berry can be used to reduce the damage of super effective Fighting-type moves, such as Primeapeâ€™s Close Combat. Maximum HP investment and 180 EVs in Defense along with an Impish nature prevent Regirock from being 2HKOed by Adamant Aggron's Choice Band-boosted Head Smash and Primeapeâ€™s unboosted Close Combat from full. Additionally, Regirock has a high chance to survive Zangoose's Close Combat, even after tanking its high-powered Facade. Its remaining EVs are allocated toward its Special Defense, which helps Regirock check Pokemon such as Oricorio-E.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Regirock's massive Defense stat and Rock typing to pivot into resisted attacks from Pokemon like Kangaskhan and physically offensive Skuntank in order to set up Stealth Rock. If Stealth Rock is already on the field, Regirock can use this opportunity to attack or to weaken its switch-ins with Toxic. Even with Special Defense investment, Regirock can still be overrun by powerful wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Drampa so it is best to either use Protect to ease prediction against these Pokemon or switch out altogether. It is generally good practice with Regirock to switch out against incoming status moves, as effects like Toxic will severely reduce its longevity and consequently disallow Regirock to switch into the Pokemon that it was meant to check. Protect should be used when Regirock either has an opportunity to stall out foes afflicted with Toxic or is at risk of being KOed. However, be careful of using Protect too often, given its frequent use can supply Regirock's foes with free turns to set up and sweep or to lay entry hazards that would be detrimental to Regirock's longevity.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>In general, Regirock fits on balanced and bulky offensive teams and is effective in aiding sweepers and wallbreakers that function optimally with Stealth Rock support. For example, offensive partners that are able to pivot into and threaten Grass-types for Regirock by virtue of their typing or ability such as Drampa and Oricorio-G perform at their peak when Stealth Rock is up. Additionally, Drampa is able to use Regirock's weakness to Grass-type moves to gain momentum and fire off powerful attacks. Other Pokemon that resist Grass-type moves for Regirock, like Lurantis and Skuntank, remove entry hazards for it via Defog, which is crucial in preserving Regirock's longevity given its lack of reliable recovery. Skuntank in particular is effective in this capacity, as it absorbs Toxic Spikes for Regirock upon switching in. Checks to Ground-types share excellent synergy with Regirock; for example, Eelektross absorbs Ground-type moves via Levitate and checks Mudsdale and Simisear on Regirock's behalf. Given Regirock counters physically offensive Skuntank, Psychic-, Ghost-, and Grass-types that appreciate Skuntank's absence are ideal teammates.</p>"
      },
      "Sunny Day": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Regirock's main use is to set up Sunny Day. Explosion inflicts heavy damage on anything without a resistance to it while KOing Regirock in the process. Explosion's purpose is twofold: not only does Regirock KOing itself prevent Stealth Rock from being removed by slower users of Defog and Rapid Spin, but this also allows partners that take advantage of sun to enter battle safely. Regirock's Attack-invested STAB Stone Edge is effective for dealing with the Fire-, Bug-, Ice-, and Flying-types such as Simisear, Scyther, Jynx, and Oricorio-E that pose a threat to the Grass-types found on Sunny Day teams and can be utilized in matchups where it is better to preserve Regirock than to use Explosion.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sturdy guarantees that Regirock will be able to set up either Stealth Rock or Sunny Day. Heat Rock increases the number of turns that Sunny Day is active, thereby increasing the time sun sweepers are functioning at peak performance.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Given that Sturdy is key to successfully setting up with Stealth Rock and Sunny Day, Regirock should be brought out early-game before the opponent can deactivate the ability via entry hazards. Switch Regirock out of Pokemon like Sableye and Jellicent that can either burn it with Will-O-Wisp or prevent it from supporting its teammates via Taunt. The momentum Regirock's Explosion provides is conducive to bringing in frail Chlorophyll sweepers like Victreebel and Shiftry for free, and it is generally a more effective method than hard switching into resisted attacks for starting a sweep. Regirock should use Explosion on the turn immediately following Sunny Day in order to maximize the number of turns its teammates can operate with sun in play, unless Regirock should be kept alive to combat Normal- or Flying-types like Kangaskhan and Oricorio-E. Kangaskhan in particular is important for sun teams to beat, as it wastes turns of Sunny Day via Fake Out. It can be advantageous to prioritize Sunny Day's use over Stealth Rock or vice versa; it is best to determine first whether the opposing team is weaker to sun sweepers or Stealth Rock and act accordingly. Sunny Day also has some defensive utility in matchups against offensive Water-types, as it reduces the damage of Water-type moves for Regirock and its Fire-type teammates.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sunny Day Regirock is intended to complement Chlorophyll-reliant sweepers and Fire-types that can use Sunny Day to maximum effect; therefore, this variant of Regirock only fits on dedicated sun-based teams. Fire-types like Simisear are most threatening when played in sun, as Sunny Day boosts the power of their STAB moves significantly. Additionally, Sunny Day effectively negates Simisear's weakness to Water-type attacks and enables the use of a single-turn Solar Beam against bulky Rock-types that would otherwise counter them, such as Carbink. In return, Simisear checks Grass- and Steel-types for Regirock, such as Tangela and Metang. Powerful Grass-type sweepers like Shiftry, Exeggutor, Victreebel, Sawsbuck, and Leafeon all capitalize on Regirock's Sunny Day by doubling their Speed via Chlorophyll, and they become much more difficult to revenge kill as a result. Additionally, Regirock further bolsters their effectiveness by laying Stealth Rock, which limits the number of times that opposing Fire-, Bug-, and Flying-types can pivot into these sweepers' Grass-type attacks. Given that Regirock uses Explosion after setting Sunny Day early-game, mid- and late-game setters of Sunny Day are required to provide sun-based teams with continued support. Prankster Volbeat and Liepard fulfill this role by setting up Sunny Day with priority. Volbeat in particular shares excellent synergy with Regirock due to its ability to pivot into Grass-, Ground-, and Fighting-type moves from Pokemon such as Bellossom, Alolan Dugtrio, and Hitmonchan. Lastly, Sunny Day setters with access to self-KOing moves like Memento and Healing Wish are useful partners to Regirock. For example, Alolan Dugtrio equipped with Sunny Day and Memento eases the setup of sun-based sweepers like Victreebel and Turtonator. Furthermore, it can use its STAB moves to threaten Pokemon that are problematic to sun-based teams such as Snow Warning Aurorus and Abomasnow.</p>"

  "Regice": {
    "overview": "<p>Regice is a threatening sweeper due to its access to Rock Polish and good coverage moves, as well as the tier's somewhat limited supply of Ice-resistant Pokemon. Its amazing special bulk makes it a reasonably good offensive check to Pokemon like Oricorio-E and Rotom-F. Regice is also able to utilize All-Out Pummeling in order to break some of its traditional checks, such as Hitmonchan, with some chip damage. However, Regice has a crippling defensive typing and poor Defense, leaving it vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards and physical attackers. It also has a hard time setting up due to this. Regice's Special Attack stat is subpar, and it needs a decent amount of chip damage on most of the Pokemon in the tier in order to sweep. Finally, even at +2, Regice cannot outspeed many common Choice Scarf users like Primeape and Scyther due to its lackluster Speed, although the latter requires prior damage to OHKO it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Icium Z and Electrium Z are options to break through Gastrodon and Poliwrath, respectively, but Fightinium Z is typically better because Focus Blast is unreliable and All-Out Pummeling's targets are more common. Life Orb is an option if your team already has a Z-Move user, but then Regice cannot break through its checks as easily and, in conjunction with hazards, is worn down quickly. A tank set with maximum HP and Thunder Wave could be used to be a better check to special attackers like Oricorio-E but is passive and suffers due to Regice's bad defensive typing. Choice Specs has some merit and makes Regice a decent wallbreaker, but it faces much competition from Abomasnow for this role, as it lacks the amazing secondary Grass-type STAB moves that Abomasnow has.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: All-Out Pummeling is Regice's best move to hit Lanturn, and it doesn't even do 50%. In return, Lanturn can use Toxic to wear it down. Gastrodon, Musharna, and Assault Vest Hitmonchan can also easily take Regice on with their good special bulk and either their STAB moves or Toxic. Similarly, Audino also forces Regice to use its Z-Move, putting it at a disadvantage.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Regice is vulnerable to almost all forms of entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, and the presence of them can make it extremely difficult to set up.</p> <p><strong>Fire- and Fighting-types</strong>: Combusken, Hitmonchan, and Gurdurr can all deal heavy damage to Regice with their STAB moves after tanking an Ice Beam; the latter two can also revenge kill it with Mach Punch. Choice Scarf Primeape can outspeed and OHKO Regice even after a Rock Polish, and Simisear can also threaten Regice, but if it has used Rock Polish, it is OHKOed by Z-Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Choice Scarf users that outspeed Regice after a boost like Scyther and Primeape will always stop a sweep, but they cannot switch into it. Other Choice Scarf users such as Swanna need very significant damage to KO it because of Regice's amazing natural bulk. Pokemon that can OHKO Regice and outspeed it before it sets up, like Lycanroc, also make decent checks, but in the same way cannot switch in.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Regice's poor physical bulk means that most physical attackers can prevent it from setting up, even Pokemon that lack super effective moves like Absol and Kangaskhan. However, almost none of them can switch into Regice.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Focus Blast, when combined with Fightinium Z, gives Regice access to a 190-Base Power All-Out Pummeling. This allows it to OHKO Regirock and Mawile and have a more reliable move against Pokemon like Aurorus and Alolan Sandslash. Thunderbolt rounds out Regice's coverage by letting it hit Water-types, such as Jellicent and Poliwrath.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Fightinium Z gives Regice access to a more reliable Fighting-type move in All-Out Pummeling to hit typical checks like Audino. A Modest nature is used to increase Regice's sweeping potential by increasing its damage output. Timid is an option, however, to outspeed Adamant Aggron, Adamant Golurk, and defensive Poliwrath before a boost and Choice Scarf Kabutops after, but it is noticeably weaker. Finally, Clear Body prevents Regice from getting affected by Sticky Web and moves with a chance to drop its Special Attack like Moonblast, which is occasionally useful.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Wait until late-game before attempting to sweep with Regice, as it vital that some of its checks, such as Lanturn, are weakened. Also, make sure to remove faster Choice Scarf users, such as Scyther and Primeape. Try to set up on a special attacker, as Regice can take a hit from most of them. Remember that Regice's insane natural bulk can be used to keep sweepers like Nasty Plot Alolan Persian in check. Also, attempt to remove entry hazards before setting up with Regice, as it is weak to Stealth Rock and its chances of setting up are improved when it is at full health. Afterwards, use the Z-Move when faced with a check to Regice that would stop its sweep if it doesn't hit Focus Blast, such as Alolan Sandslash.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hazard control is almost mandatory when using Regice, as it is vulnerable to almost all forms of entry hazards and weak to Stealth Rock. Hitmonchan can check Rock-types like Lycanroc, while Kabutops and Swanna take on either Fire- or Fighting-types for Regice while also providing hazard removal. In order to wear down its checks and counters, Regice also appreciates hazard support. This makes Spikes setters like Qwilfish as well as Stealth Rock setters like Torterra and Regirock great partners. Toxic Spikes are especially helpful to wear down Pokemon like Lanturn and Musharna. Lanturn is the biggest common obstacle to a Regice sweep. While wearing it down with hazards helps, Pokemon that pressure Lanturn like Oricorio-G and Floatzel make good teammates. Similarly, Pokemon that pressure Assault Vest Hitmonchan like Simisear make very good partners. Pursuit users such as Skuntank trap and weaken the aforementioned Lanturn for Regice to sweep late-game. Finally, Swanna, Lanturn, Sableye, and Jellicent help Regice take on the plethora of popular Fire- and Fighting-types that check it.</p>"

  "Torterra": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its excellent typing, useful stats, and diverse movepool, Torterra is a highly versatile Pokemon that is able to run multiple sets successfully. Its access to multiple boosting moves in Rock Polish and Swords Dance, as well as powerful STAB moves in Wood Hammer and Earthquake, allows it to heavily pressure offensive and defensive teams alike. Meanwhile, it differentiates itself from other defensive Stealth Rock setters like Mudsdale and Regirock thanks to its access to reliable recovery, while its unique typing gives it a better matchup against common wallbreakers such as Eelektross. Its excellent coverage allows Torterra to be more immediately threatening than most defensive Pokemon, as it takes on numerous top-tier Pokemon from Jellicent to Regirock simply with its dual STAB combination. This gives Torterra the freedom to dip into its support movepool more freely and better utilize options such as Swords Dance and Stealth Rock. Torterra's excellent bulk allows it to tank numerous super effective coverage moves, such as Eelektross's Flamethrower and Lanturn's Ice Beam, as long as it has defensive investment. However, numerous weaknesses, including ones to very common Ice-, Fire-, Flying-, and Bug-type coverage moves, still leave Torterra prone to being chipped. Many Pokemon such as Primeape and Ferroseed can easily lure Torterra and take it out by finding space for Ice-type coverage or Toxic, which significantly cripples it. Torterra's mediocre Speed means that many strong wallbreakers such as Stoutland will still have a bit of an edge over it. Torterra also faces defensive competition from Mudsdale and Regirock, which are capable of walling certain threats that can break through Torterra such as Kangaskhan.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Seed Bomb is a far weaker alternative to Wood Hammer that makes Torterra fare far worse versus Mudsdale but does come without the drawback of recoil. A more physically defensive spread could be used to better take on physical wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Kangaskhan, but Torterra simply gains less from this avenue compared to its specially defensive spread, which enhances its survivability against more threats. It is also fairly outclassed by Mudsdale in that role. A Choice Band set is an extremely strong wallbreaker capable of OHKOing much of the tier, but it is beaten by most of the same Pokemon that beat Torterra's other sets and lacks the Speed of counterparts such as Stoutland. Crunch hits Bronzor but does little else for Torterra. It is optimal on Choice Band sets but otherwise an outclassed use of a moveslot. Toxic allows Torterra to lure and cripple a few Pokemon that otherwise give it difficulties, most notably Tangela, which it cannot threaten otherwise. Yache Berry can allow Torterra to take Ice attacks from Pokemon such as offensive Cryogonal, but Torterra can still be OHKOed by particularly strong attackers such as Choice Specs Aurorus. Torterra can set up a Substitute on some status-reliant Pokemon such as Mudsdale or Regirock, which allows it to set up a Swords Dance more effectively. Torterra can even run Substitute + Toxic to lure bulky Grass-types such as Tangela.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Due to Torterra's 4x weakness, Ice-type coverage can allow both Ice-types such as Cryogonal and non-Ice-types like Lanturn and Omastar to OHKO or 2HKO it. However, Stealth Rock Torterra can take many Ice-type coverage moves from full health and OHKO the user in response, although it will likely remain useless for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Torterra has no good way to break through bulky Grass-types such as Tangela, Lurantis, and Shiinotic. Even more offensive Grass-types such as Simisage and Leafeon can still adequately check Torterra, in particular making it more difficult for Rock Polish Torterra to sweep. They can also use Torterra as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Flying-Types</strong>: Torterra cannot hit Flying-types such as Oricorio-G and Altaria with an unresisted move unless it opts to run Stone Edge, allowing them to check Torterra fairly effectively. However, Wood Hammer still does decent damage to most Flying-types save Altaria, and it can at least force a Roost frequently.</p> <p><strong>Bronzor</strong>: Bronzor completely walls any Torterra variant lacking Swords Dance. While Swords Dance Torterra is capable of breaking through Bronzor, this usually comes at the cost of being crippled with Toxic and using its Z-Move.</p> <p><strong>Status and Residual Damage</strong>: Torterra is prone to being worn down by Toxic or burn, Spikes, and recoil from Wood Hammer, as well as repeated chip damage from Pokemon such as Primeape. Hail can also reduce Torterra's healing ability if it runs Synthesis. This chip damage cuts into Torterra's great bulk and can make it fairly easy to revenge kill even for weaker Choice Scarf users such as Skuntank.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wood Hammer is Torterra's strongest STAB move and can reach ludicrous levels of damage output in conjunction with Grassium Z and Overgrow, capable of KOing Oricorio-E after Stealth Rock. However, this can be situational, and it does cause heavy recoil to Torterra. Stone Edge threatens Flying-types that can otherwise easily check Torterra, OHKOing Dodrio and Articuno from full health as well as Oricorio-G after Stealth Rock damage. Alternatively, Swords Dance can allow Torterra to achieve OHKOs on Pokemon that might otherwise survive a hit from full HP and retaliate, such as Drampa, as well as allowing it to better break a few defensive checks such as Sableye and Bronzor. Synthesis is another option for Torterra's final moveslot, as it gives Torterra more defensive utility early-game and allows it to spam Wood Hammer more freely.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Speed allows Torterra to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame as well as slow Choice Scarf users like Aurorus and Alolan Sandslash after a Rock Polish boost. An Adamant nature allows Torterra to hit sufficient Speed levels while maximizing damage output. However, a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed various threats such as Golurk and Assault Vest Lanturn before a Rock Polish, as well as Choice Scarf Skuntank and Kabutops after a boost. Grassium Z allows Torterra to OHKO Pokemon like Mudsdale, Kangaskhan, Stoutland, and Jellicent from full health as well as Eelektross, Regirock, and Crabominable after Stealth Rock damage, while also avoiding recoil from Wood Hammer. Alternatively, Rockium Z can be used with Stone Edge to guarantee an OHKO on Oricorio-E and Oricorio-G without Torterra needing to be in Overgrow range, as well as avoiding accuracy issues when attempting to KO Pokemon such as Articuno and Altaria.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rock Polish Torterra is best used as a late-game sweeper, as it requires slight chip on many Pokemon to achieve KOs before boosting. Try to avoid needing to set up a Swords Dance, as the damage from taking an extra turn to set up can be significant when combined with entry hazards and Wood Hammer recoil. However, Swords Dance can also allow Torterra to function as an early-game wallbreaker, albeit at the cost of sacrificing its late-game utility if not paired with a Healing Wish user or Z-Parting Shot Alolan Persian. This secondary role may be more useful in some matchups, particularly when facing Choice Scarf users capable of outspeeding Torterra after a Rock Polish, such as Dodrio. Be careful about when to use Torterra's Z-Move, as it can gain significantly from breaking a check with Bloom Doom or Continental Crush when it isn't wasted. However, Wood Hammer's recoil can also be beneficial, as Torterra can use the recoil to strategically put itself into Overgrow range and boost the power of Bloom Doom to better break through Pokemon such as Lurantis. Be sure to scout for Ice-type coverage from Pokemon that might be looking to lure Torterra, such as Ice Beam Silvally-Water and Hidden Power Ice Eelektross.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removers such as Cryogonal can be vital, as Torterra does not want to take unnecessary damage from Spikes. Torterra also benefits a lot from entry hazards to chip the opposing team, although it pairs well with very few Stealth Rock users. Regirock and Alolan Sandslash are notable though for taking on most of the Flying-types that check Torterra. Due to its lack of recovery and tendency to get worn down by Wood Hammer recoil, Torterra highly appreciates VoltTurn partners such as Lanturn, Eelektross, Primeape, and Rotom-F that can bring it in safely against targets it can threaten like Clefairy. Lanturn in particular fits exceptionally well with Torterra, as it is able to switch in on Pokemon like Oricorio-E and Rotom-F that can revenge kill Torterra as well as heal it from status with Heal Bell. In return, Torterra can check threats that Lanturn struggles with like Eelektross and Mudsdale. Healing Wish users such as Musharna, as well as Z-Parting Shot Alolan Persian, can allow Torterra to come in multiple times and act as both a wallbreaker and a sweeper, significantly enhancing its threat level in many cases. Pursuit from teammates such as Choice Band Skuntank and Absol can help to take out a few of Torterra's checks and counters, such as Cryogonal and Bronzor. These Pokemon also form a strong wallbreaking core with Torterra, breaking down physically defensive Pokemon such as Lurantis. Strong special wallbreakers such as Drampa are also notable for being able to pressure Tangela, Torterra's biggest counter. Jellicent is another notable defensive partner, as it can check many Fire- and Ice-types that give Torterra problems, while Torterra puts pressure on Lanturn and Eelektross.</p>"
      },
      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake and Wood Hammer allow Torterra to hit most of the metagame, save Flying- and Grass-types, for at least neutral damage, and give it good damage output despite no investment.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The special defense investment and a Careful nature allows Torterra to survive two Flamethrowers from Eelektross after Stealth Rock, an uninvested Supersonic Skystrike from Oricorio-E before Stealth Rock, and a Freeze-Dry from a fully invested Cryogonal, as well as various other hits such as Assault Vest Lanturn's Ice Beam. The Defense investment avoids the OHKO from Choice Scarf Dodrio's Brave Bird from full health. Shell Armor is preferred over Overgrow, as Torterra would rather avoid critical hits than get situational damage boosts.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As with most Stealth Rock users, prioritize setting entry hazards early to get as much chip on the opposing team as possible. Due to its many weaknesses, Torterra is particularly prone to being taken advantage of by smart double switches into threats such as Simisear or Aurorus. Be careful to avoid getting predictable. Particularly attempt to minimize free switches from Abomasnow and Aurorus, as their hail can reduce Synthesis's healing ability even several turns later. Keep in mind that Wood Hammer recoil can put Torterra at problematically low health, and it may be better to recover with Synthesis rather than incurring extra chip damage. Avoid Toxic whenever possible, as it massively cuts into Torterra's longevity and effectiveness. Be careful using Synthesis too much, as while Torterra likes to stay healthy, Synthesis has only 8 PP and can be stalled out quite quickly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ice-type checks such as Alolan Sandslash, Clefairy, and Gurdurr are vital for defensive synergy. Flying- and Fire-type answers such as Eelektross, Regirock, and Jellicent are also important, as Torterra can be a magnet for particular type-advantaged wallbreakers. For its part, Torterra is a strong check to Eelektross, making it a good partner for Flying-types such as Swanna and Oricorio-G, as well as many of the aforementioned defensive partners. Torterra can stack entry hazards fairly well with Qwilfish, as they have a decent early-game defensive presence and can try to overwhelm the opposing team with Stealth Rock and Spikes. Clerics such as Altaria and Audino can keep Torterra Toxic free; however, most clerics do not pair especially well with Torterra outside of stall save for Lanturn and Musharna.</p>"

      "Bulky Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wood Hammer and Earthquake are a strong STAB combination that allows Torterra to hit most of the metagame extremely hard after a Swords Dance.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>96 Speed EVs allow Torterra to beat out uninvested Lanturn and maximum Speed Drampa. The rest are put into HP and Special Defense to make Torterra as bulky as possible and better check Pokemon such as Victreebel and Alolan Raichu. An alternate spread with 124 Speed EVs can be used to outpace specially defensive Alolan Sandslash, although it does cut into Torterra's bulk more heavily.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Torterra set finds most of its utility in early-game wallbreaking, although if the opponent has a hard counter such as Tangela, Torterra may need to perform more of a defensive role until its counter is removed. Carefully mixing it up between using Swords Dance and attacking is fairly important, as Torterra can often force mind games versus weakened foes between boosting to take them out next turn and predicting a switch to an offensive threat capable of revenge killing Torterra. Torterra should avoid status at all costs, as burn makes it fairly non-threatening while Toxic can severely limit its wallbreaking and defensive potential in conjunction with the many other sources of chip damage that plague Torterra. Most teams lacking a very hard counter will find it fairly difficult to switch into Torterra, meaning that in some matchups it won't be necessary to set up a Swords Dance at all. Be careful about using Earthquake too freely, as giving free switches to Pokemon with Levitate or Flying-types can result in a massive loss of momentum. Wood Hammer is far more spammable, as it does good damage even to many Pokemon that resist it such as Oricorio-E.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock users such as Metang can help chip away at Torterra's many Flying-type checks. Metang also can function as an Ice-type answer for Torterra. Other Pokemon that resist Ice are also beneficial, with Cryogonal being notable as an interesting offensive partner as well, as it can check Tangela and Sableye and wear down Bronzor in conjunction with Torterra. Many sweepers and cleaners such as Silvally-Fairy, Lycanroc, and Dodrio benefit significantly from Torterra's wallbreaking support and ability to pressure defensive behemoths like Regirock and Mudsdale. Primeape is a notable offensive partner, as Torterra is a solid check to many of Primeape's answers such as Musharna and Jellicent. Simisear is another good wallbreaker to use with Torterra, as it can use bulky Grass-types that counter Torterra, such as Tangela and Lurantis, as setup fodder. As Tangela is a major defensive problem for Torterra, luring it and crippling it with Toxic or Knock Off from Pokemon such as Primeape and Alolan Persian can be extremely valuable. Pursuit users such as Absol can also help trap checks to Torterra like Cryogonal and Bronzor.</p>"

  "Bibarel": {
    "overview": "<p>Bibarel finds a small niche in PU as a sweeper thanks to its ability Simple, which, in conjunction with Swords Dance, allows Bibarel's Attack to reach high levels and lets Bibarel break past opposing Pokemon easily. Bibarel's unique STAB combination allows it to hit the majority of the tier for neutral damage, so when it is able to boost its Attack, it will almost always heavily damage opposing Pokemon. Unfortunately, Bibarel has very poor defensive stats, lackluster Speed, and mediocre Attack, making it quite slow and weak without a Swords Dance boost. It faces strong competition from many offensive Water-types in the tier such as Floatzel and Kabutops due to them being more reliable sweepers with higher Attack and Speed stats than Bibarel. Bibarel also faces strong competition as a Normal-type wallbreaker with Kangaskhan and Stoutland, which also possess higher Attack and Speed stats. Furthermore, Bibarel struggles with bulky Grass-types like Tangela and Leafeon, which can reliably switch into it and threaten it back with strong super effective attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Normalium Z or Waterium Z along with Swords Dance allows Bibarel to have one very strong attack to deal with any opposing Pokemon. A Jolly nature can be used instead of Adamant, allowing Bibarel to outspeed Pokemon like Adamant Absol, but this overall just makes it weaker than it already is, especially before setting up. Quick Attack is an alternative priority option over Aqua Jet that is able to hit faster offensive Pokemon such as Abomasnow and Jynx that can take a boosted Aqua Jet. However, opting for Quick Attack prevents Bibarel from being able to dispatch faster Ghost-types like Haunter and Oricorio-G with its priority move. Double-Edge can be used over Return for a higher damage output, but Bibarel is worn down even more quickly by using it due to the combined recoil from Double-Edge and Life Orb. The additional recoil is especially noticeable if Bibarel OHKOes a Pokemon with Double-Edge. Curse + Rest Bibarel is a set that allows Bibarel to boost its Attack and Defense by two stages at a time; by using this set with a Chesto Berry and an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD, Bibarel can assume the role of a bulky attacker, but it is easily checked by Pokemon like Tangela. Furthermore, it becomes more passive without Attack investment, and faster Pokemon like Oricorio-E can easily set up against it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Jellicent</strong>: Water Absorb variants of Jellicent render Bibarel completely useless. Cursed Body variants can also easily switch into unboosted Bibarel and proceed to cripple it with Will-O-Wisp, although they struggle to check it if it's already boosted.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types like Tangela can easily take attacks from a set-up Bibarel and threaten it with their super effective Grass-type moves. Furthermore, faster Grass-types like Ludicolo and Leafeon resist Aqua Jet and can threaten Bibarel.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: Due to its low Speed, Bibarel is outsped by many Pokemon that threaten to OHKO it such as Primeape, Alolan Raichu, Haunter, and Swanna.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Primeape and Life Orb Hitmonchan outspeed Bibarel and OHKO with their super effective Fighting-type moves. Gurdurr is also a major threat to Bibarel, as Gurdurr is able to take it on before it sets up a Swords Dance and can also pick it off with Mach Punch.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Bibarel does not appreciate Sucker Punch from the likes of Absol and Skuntank, but it can play around Sucker Punch with Swords Dance and use its own priority in either Aqua Jet or Quick Attack. Bibarel is also weak to Mach Punch from Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Hitmonchan.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Aqua Jet allows Bibarel to pick off weakened foes and chip faster opposing Pokemon such as Dodrio and Primeape before it goes down. It also allows Bibarel to chip at faster Ghost-types like Haunter and OHKO them at +4.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature and maximum Speed EVs allow Bibarel to outspeed Pokemon such as Adamant Alolan Sandslash and Modest Ludicolo if hail and rain are not active, respectively. Life Orb is the preferred item on Bibarel to maximize its damage output, allowing it to act as a stronger wallbreaker and sweeper, especially after a boost from Swords Dance. Simple is the best ability to use on Bibarel because Swords Dance's effect is doubled, which allows it to become a threatening wallbreaker and sweeper after one boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bibarel can set up against passive Pokemon that cannot deal much damage to it, such as Clefairy, and Pokemon it might force out, such as Aurorus and Golurk. Bibarel's best opportunity to be brought in is against weakened foes to revenge kill them with Aqua Jet. Bibarel only functions as a late-game sweeper, so it is not ideal to bring in Bibarel to set up until bulky Grass-types and faster Water-resistant Pokemon like Tangela and Jellicent have been defeated. Bibarel should not be brought in on strong attacks due to its low defenses, as even attacks from walls such as Type: Null 2HKO Bibarel. Bibarel should try to set up Swords Dance on Choice-locked Pokemon like Choice Scarf Haunter locked into Shadow Ball, and Choice Scarf Alolan Sandslash locked into Iron Head. Bibarel appreciates being brought in with U-turn or on a free switch where it doesn't take any damage whatsoever.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Possessing a check to Fighting-types is imperative to make sure that Bibarel can carry out its job as smoothly as possible. Musharna is a solid option, able to use Healing Wish to keep Bibarel healthy at any point of the game, and as well as Future Sight to heavily damage opposing teams. Golurk is also a great teammate for Bibarel, as it is immune to Fighting and Electric, which are two of Bibarel's weaknesses. Golurk is also able to set up Stealth Rock to provide chip damage so Bibarel has an easier time wallbreaking after a Swords Dance. Furthermore, Bibarel is weak to Grass, so having some Grass-resistant Pokemon such as Skuntank and Cryogonal really helps Bibarel. Entry hazard removal is also very useful to improve Bibarel's survivability. Specially Offensive Skuntank is a solid teammate that removes entry hazards and checks the Grass-types that resist Bibarel's Waterfall such as Tangela and Victreebel. Slow users of Volt Switch and U-turn, such as Eelektross, ensure that Bibarel can enter the field safely. Memento and Parting Shot support from Pokemon such as Skuntank, Alolan Persian, and Silvally-Fairy ensure that Bibarel can enter safely, somewhat mitigating its poor defensive stats. Dual screens support from Pokemon like Electrode helps bolster Bibarel's lacking defenses so that it takes less damage from neutral attacks that are otherwise able to 2HKO it. Sticky Web support from the likes of Smeargle and Masquerain helps to counteract Bibarel's middling Speed by allowing it to outspeed faster threats, making it a better sweeper. Bibarel appreciates the help of special wallbreakers like Simisear and Aurorus to break past bulky Grass-type Pokemon such as Tangela that give Bibarel trouble. Bibarel, in return, is able to break past specially defensive Pokemon like Clefairy and Type: Null for them.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Rampardos fills a tiny niche in the PU metagame due to its monstrous Attack stat that complements its ability Sheer Force. Head Smash's overwhelming power combined with coverage moves such as Zen Headbutt gives Rampardos the minuscule niche of a Choice Scarf user. However, Rampardos faces massive competition from Lycanroc, which is naturally fast, has priority, and can utilize Swords Dance if it gains the opportunity. Rampardos also has competition against Aggron as a wallbreaker due to its ability able to spam Head Smash with zero drawbacks. While a Choice Scarf is able to patch up Rampardos's middling Speed, it still fails to outspeed faster threats like Lycanroc, Alolan Persian, Floatzel, and other Choice Scarf users like Primeape and Kabutops. Furthermore, Rampardos's primary attack, Head Smash, racks up recoil damage fairly easily, which further hinders its longevity. Rampardos is also rather susceptible to priority moves like Mach Punch and Aqua Jet, which aren't too uncommon to come across in PU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rampardos can utilize Life Orb to further strengthen Head Smash and prevent it from being locked into a move, but this set is usually outclassed by Choice Band Aggron, whose Defense and ability Rock Head allow it multiple opportunities to switch in throughout the game while not being affected by Head Smash recoil. Rampardos can also use Rock Polish as another way to fix up its Speed, but its paper-thin defenses give it very minimal opportunities to set up and Rampardos can still get revenge killed by common priority moves and Choice Scarf users.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Defensive Ground-types such as Mudsdale, Gastrodon, and Torterra all resist Rampardos's Head Smash and Rock Slide and deal hefty damage back with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types like Gurdurr and Poliwrath do have to be more wary of Zen Headbutt, but they still resist Rampardos's STAB moves and brutalize it. Gurdurr and Hitmonchan gets the added benefit of Mach Punch to take out Rampardos with super effective priority.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Rampardos's poor base Speed prevents it from outspeeding Pokemon like Lycanroc, Alolan Persian, and Floatzel, and it also gets outsped by almost every other viable Choice Scarf user in the tier such as Kabutops and Primeape.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Aggron and Ferroseed need to watch out for Superpower, but they all resist Head Smash and Rock Slide and deal super effective damage to Rampardos too.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Slide is used on this set as a much safer and accurate attack if you do not want to take the recoil damage from Head Smash. However, this move can be unreliable in some situations, as it fails to 2HKO Lurantis. Superpower is Rampardos's main move to hit Steel-types like Aggron and Alolan Dugtrio, but Pursuit can also work if you would like to trap Alolan Raichu and Oricorio-G at the expense of lacking the coverage to handle Steel-types. Finally, Zen Headbutt is necessary coverage on Rampardos to give it some sort of counterplay against Gurdurr and Poliwrath, which would otherwise wall Rampardos.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Choice Scarf along with a Jolly nature places Rampardos at a decent Speed tier that allows it to outpace Pokemon that are around base 110 Speed like Dodrio and Alolan Raichu.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to how frail Rampardos is, you should find opportunities to give it free switches through slow pivots or aggressively coming in through double switches. You will have to occasionally predict perfectly in order to land super effective damage on the opponent's Pokemon. Having to guess between Zen Headbutt and Superpower is a situation that could possibly occur, and guessing wrong will result in you giving your opponent free turns. There is a fine difference between whether Head Smash or Rock Slide should be used in specific scenarios. If Rampardos accumulates too much Head Smash recoil, it puts itself into the range of getting KOed by priority moves like Mach Punch from Hitmonchan. Rampardos is also capable of performing the role of a late-game cleaner, as it will often want its checks removed or at least chipped and faster Pokemon eliminated so it can fire off Head Smash far more with fewer drawbacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rampardos often likes the use of pivots in order to get it in more easily so it can score KOs or deal hefty chip damage. Alolan Persian can soften up any incoming blows with Parting Shot before sending Rampardos in. Rampardos often finds itself completely hopeless against Fighting-types if they get in safely, so Ghost-types like Jellicent and Oricorio-G works well as a secondary measure. This also makes Qwilfish a strong Fighting-type check for Rampardos that can also set up Spikes to weaken its checks in order to provide an opportunity to sweep late-game. Alolan Raticate and Swords Dance Abomasnow both capitalize on the speed that Rampardos offers, as it can weaken their checks to open up a sweep. Water- and Grass-types like Floatzel and Victreebel that can seriously pressure or remove Ground-types and most of the other answers to Rampardos allow it to thrive late-game. Rampardos can use Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Primeape or Ground-types like Mudsdale and Gastrodon to deal with Steel-types that can usually switch into Rampardos.</p>"

Its typing also gives it an advantage against common defensive backbones on offensive teams such as Mudsdale and Regirock.

A physical or special set utilizing Choice Scarf might seem attractive due to Floatzel's Speed tier, allowing it to effectively outspeed the entire metagame; however, it is hard to justify using over other Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Dodrio due to their superior power and coverage; additionally, Primeape can generate momentum with U-turn. Choice Specs can be used over Life Orb on the specially offensive set; however, Floatzel's damage output is not great enough to justify being locked into any of its moves, and Choice Specs also prevents it from utilizing Taunt. Floatzel can run additional moves on its Choice Band set such as Crunch for handling Jellicent, Return for dealing neutral damage to Lanturn and Poliwrath, and Low Kick for threatening Stoutland; however, it struggles to fit them over priority in Aqua Jet, the ability to Pursuit trap, or utility in Switcheroo.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Due to its lackluster coverage options, Floatzel struggles against bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Poliwrath, which can wall it thanks to their access to recovery, as well as Lanturn, which can come in on Floatzel's attacks and proceed to take it out with Volt Switch. However, none of them appreciate Switcheroo replacing their items with Choice Band, the former two greatly dislike Taunt, and the latter can't switch in repeatedly, as it doesn't like getting chipped by Liquidation. Gastrodon can effectively wall most Floatzel sets, although it has to watch out for Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Primeape, Dodrio, and Rotom-F can easily KO Floatzel from full health with their STAB moves, while others like Swanna and Kabutops can take it out after minimal chip damage. Kangaskhan is also able to revenge kill Floatzel after some chip damage thanks to its dual priority moves. None of them can switch in freely on Floatzel, however, as they take a large chunk of damage from its STAB and coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Tangela, Victreebel, Ludicolo, Abomasnow, and Lurantis can all take advantage of Choice Band variants being locked into Water-type moves and proceed to set up or deal damage to forced switch-ins. However, none but Ludicolo can switch in reliably on specially offensive Floatzel due to its threatening coverage options, while the latter four also fear Ice Punch from the Choice Band set.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Due to its lack of recovery options, Floatzel gets worn down very easily by entry hazards, status, and Life Orb recoil. Coupled with its poor bulk, this makes it easier to revenge kill even with weak priority moves such as Mach Punch from Gurdurr and Accelerock from Lycanroc.</p>",

      "Specially Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam hits Grass-types such as Victreebel, Torterra, and Tangela as well as Flying-types like Oricorio-E, Oricorio-G, and Dodrio. Focus Blast threatens Steel-types like Alolan Sandslash and Ferroseed, Normal-types such as Stoutland and Drampa, and Ice-types like Abomasnow and Rotom-F. Taunt provides Floatzel with a way of shutting down entry hazard setters such as Ferroseed, Qwilfish, and Metang as well as specially defensive Pokemon like Audino that might try to use Wish or spread status. Hidden Power Grass can be used to reliably check threats that are 4x weak to Grass such as Gastrodon, which otherwise walls Floatzel, as well as Carracosta and Kabutops.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Swift Swim allows Floatzel to revenge kill opposing Swift Swim users such as Kabutops under rain.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Floatzel should preferably be kept healthy until mid- or late-game when it can utilize its high Speed to function as a cleaner. It can also function as a lead against Spikes setters such as Qwilfish as well as Stealth Rock setters such as Mudsdale, Regirock, and Torterra, although it has to look out for potential pivot leads that can threaten it like Eelektross and Primeape. Floatzel should preferably be brought onto the field by pivots, as it cannot afford to switch in directly on offensive Pokemon due to its poor bulk, which, when coupled with Life Orb recoil, can lead to Floatzel getting worn down quickly. Due to the number of switches it can force from the opponent, Floatzel should be played aggressively by using the appropriate coverage move on a predicted switch or by performing double switches out of its counters like Jellicent. Additionally, Floatzel can function as a decent revenge killer due to its ability to check a myriad of wallbreakers like Victreebel, Simisear, and Aurorus. Taunt should be used liberally to shut down Pokemon that don't pose an immediate danger to Floatzel, including hazard setters such as Qwilfish and Ferroseed, Defoggers such as Altaria and non-Freeze-Dry Cryogonal, and defensive walls like Audino.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>VoltTurn users such as Eelektross, Lanturn, and Primeape can create many opportunities for Floatzel to be brought in safely against Pokemon such as Regirock, Mudsdale, and Drampa while chipping away at their switch-ins to make Floatzel's cleaning task easier. Eelektross has a notably good matchup against Water-types that can wall Floatzel like Lanturn and Jellicent, while Lanturn can heal Floatzel from status ailments with Heal Bell. Floatzel greatly appreciates Spikes support from teammates like Ferroseed and Roselia, as the chip damage allows it to reliably KO threats that can otherwise check it from full health like Victreebel, Stoutland, Drampa, and Alolan Raichu. Furthermore, Floatzel can prevent Pokemon like Swanna and Silvally-Fairy from using Defog with Taunt. Since it heavily dislikes getting chipped by entry hazards, Floatzel highly appreciates entry hazard removers like Alolan Sandslash, Hitmonchan, and Cryogonal that fit well on entry hazard stacking teams as well as Silvally-Fairy, which can generate momentum for Floatzel with Parting Shot. It also pairs well with other wallbreakers and cleaners that benefit from entry hazard stacking like Stoutland, Dodrio, and Oricorio-E, as they alleviate the pressure of checking Pokemon like Alolan Sandslash, Victreebel, and Gurdurr from one another. Regirock and Mudsdale are Stealth Rock setters that work very well with Floatzel, as they provide it with a necessary defensive backbone to handle threats such as Dodrio and Primeape. Regirock can also threaten special walls like Articuno and Cryogonal that Floatzel struggles against. Alolan Persian can support Floatzel by checking Pokemon such as Kangaskhan and Alolan Raichu and give it another chance at wallbreaking by healing it with Darkinium Z-boosted Parting Shot.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Punch deals with threats such as Victreebel and Drampa, which otherwise wall Floatzel, as well as Oricorio-E and Oricorio-G. Pursuit lets Floatzel revenge kill threats that it forces out like Alolan Raichu, Jynx, and Haunter. Aqua Jet allows Floatzel to revenge kill weakened, faster threats like Choice Scarf Dodrio and Primeape as well as priority users like Lycanroc, Skuntank, and Hitmonchan. Alternatively, Switcheroo can be used to cripple some of Floatzel's common switch-ins, including Lanturn, Jellicent, Tangela, and Ferroseed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Water Veil is the ability of choice, since it prevents Floatzel from getting burned. This greatly improves its matchup against common stall Pokemon such as Sableye, which are unable to cripple it with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Floatzel is best preserved until mid- or late-game when it can work effectively as a cleaner once most of its targets have been chipped thanks to its great Speed and access to priority. It is also effective at revenge killing, as it can utilize its Speed to Pursuit trap or threaten a wide array of offensive Pokemon like Victreebel and Lycanroc with coverage moves. It is recommended to try and take out as many switch-ins to Floatzel such as Tangela and physically bulky variants of Lanturn as possible before it switches in, as being Choice-locked into a poor move can leave it easily taken advantage of. Due to its poor bulk, Floatzel appreciates being brought in safely by pivots whenever possible. Floatzel should also utilize aggressive double switches to get in against Pokemon it can threaten heavy damage against or Pursuit trap, such as Oricorio-G and Cryogonal. Switcheroo can be used to cripple some of Floatzel's counters such as Lanturn and Gastrodon as well as stall Pokemon like Sableye and Audino. However, it should only be used as a last resort, as losing Choice Band makes Floatzel notably weaker and less reliable as a late-game cleaner and wallbreaker; it also has to watch out for being locked into Switcheroo against Z-Move users.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Floatzel fits well on entry hazard stacking teams, as chip damage from Spikes set by partners such as Roselia and Ferroseed can help wear down targets like Stoutland, Drampa, and Aggron that would otherwise be able to check Floatzel from full health. Additionally, Stealth Rock support from setters like Mudsdale and Regirock helps it take out targets like Oricorio-E, Articuno, and Cryogonal after chip damage, and these Pokemon can also switch into threats like Dodrio and Primeape. Due to its lackluster bulk, Floatzel appreciates VoltTurn users like Eelektross, Lanturn, Rotom-F, and Primeape that can bring it in safely against targets such as Regirock, Mudsdale, and Oricorio-E. Rotom-F can notably support Floatzel with entry hazard removal as well as by pressuring Water-types like Jellicent and checking shared targets like Victreebel and Oricorio-E. Cryogonal can provide Floatzel with a solid specially defensive backbone and switch in on Pokemon like Aurorus and specially offensive Victreebel that might try to take advantage of Floatzel being Choice-locked into an unfavorable move. It can also check Water-types like Lanturn and Jellicent and provide reliable entry hazard removal. In return, Floatzel can take out fast Pokemon that Cryogonal struggles with such as Lycanroc, Simisear, and Alolan Dugtrio. Oricorio-G stands out as an excellent offensive partner to Floatzel due to its ability to reliably switch into threats like Victreebel and Gurdurr, check Poliwrath, and function as a spinblocker on entry hazard stacking teams. In return, Floatzel checks threats like Aurorus, Lycanroc, and Cryogonal, all of which it can also trap with Pursuit. Floatzel also pairs well with other wallbreakers such as Victreebel and Grassium Z Simisear, as they can threaten targets that Floatzel struggles to break through like Regirock, Lanturn, and Tangela. They appreciate Floatzel being able to check offensive threats like Aurorus, Oricorio-E, and non-Choice Scarf Dodrio as well as defensive Pokemon like Altaria in return.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Cherrim is an atrocious Sunny Day sweeper, as it possesses a terrible movepool and mediocre stats bar its average Speed tier, but that does not save it by far. It is easily walled even if it manages to get boosted up, leaving it outclassed by other physical Sunny Day sweepers such as Leafeon, Shiftry, and Sawsbuck. However, it is even more outclassed by Bellossom and Victreebel if running a special set, which is what forces it to go physical with its one mediocre niche being Flower Gift. This notably leaves Cherrim walled by virtually most of the tier.</p>",

  "Gastrodon": {
    "overview": "<p>Gastrodon is a very reliable defensive Pokemon thanks to its amazing typing, ability, and access to reliable recovery. This allows it to check common threats such as Lycanroc, Aggron, and Choice Specs Jellicent and block Volt Switch from the likes of Lanturn. However, its typing also leaves it weak to rather common Grass-types such as Roselia and Victreebel and Grass-type coverage moves from the likes of Eelektross. It also suffers from being passive and lets threats such as Drampa and Lurantis in almost for free, as they only fear a potential Toxic. Furthermore, Gastrodon is extremely prone to getting worn down via Toxic, forcing it to use Recover more often. Finally, Gastrodon suffers from competition from other Ground-types such as Mudsdale and Torterra, which are bulkier and have access to Stealth Rock, and Jellicent, which has much more stallbreaking utility.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gastrodon can use Yawn to cripple switch-ins and force them out or, if they stay in, cripple them with sleep. It works especially well with Spikes support, as it allows Gastrodon to rack up damage more easily. However, Toxic is more consistent, as Yawn can be avoided by switching out and negated by Sleep Clause. Gastrodon can make use of its interesting offensive typing and movepool to use an offensive set with a Life Orb or Choice Specs to lure in would-be switch-ins such as Drampa and Lurantis. However, this gives up Gastrodon's main attribute in its defensive utility. Gastrodon can use a fully specially defensive set to better check special attackers such as Simisear and even check Hidden Power Grass Lanturn. However, running a specially defensive set means that Gastrodon can't check Lycanroc and Aggron as reliably and leaves it vulnerable to other physical threats such as Primeape and Dodrio, which can 2HKO it. Curse is an option, as it allows Gastrodon to beat threats such as Stoutland once boosted and act as a wincon, while Counter allows Gastrodon to punish Pokemon like Stoutland, Dodrio, and Absol for attacking it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Abomasnow and Victreebel can come in on Gastrodon and easily take care of it. However, the former has to be wary of Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Gastrodon is extremely susceptible to Toxic, as it forces Gastrodon to use Recover more often than it'd like to and greatly hinders its longevity and capacity to check what it's supposed to check.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Pokemon running super effective coverage such as Simisear, Cryogonal, and Floatzel can deal with Gastrodon. However, none of them can freely switch into Gastrodon.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: While Gastrodon has good bulk, strong attackers like Stoutland and Drampa can get past it with ease. The former can come in on a predicted Scald or Toxic to boost Facade's power, while the latter's typing and good bulk allow it to come in on everything Gastrodon could use, only fearing a potential Toxic. Additionally, while they can't come in directly, Aurorus and Absol heavily threaten Gastrodon.</p> <p><strong>Status Absorbers</strong>: Gastrodon's overreliance on status leaves it weak to status absorbers such as Stoutland and Gurdurr, with the latter even using Gastrodon as setup fodder. Other Pokemon like Calm Mind Spiritomb and Clefairy aren't bothered by Gastrodon's Toxic and use it as setup fodder.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald can cripple physical attackers such as Torterra and Kangaskhan with a burn and discourages them from coming in while dissuading setup sweepers such as Dodrio and Absol from using Gastrodon as setup fodder. Toxic is Gastrodon's best way of crippling switch-ins such as Bellossom, Oricorio-E, and Drampa. Finally, Earthquake is used over Earth Power, as it hits Alolan Raichu, Lanturn, and Jynx harder than Earth Power.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Storm Drain allows Gastrodon to check Water-types like Jellicent and non-Hidden Power Grass Omastar. A Sassy nature is preferred over an Careful or Calm nature, as it doesn't weaken Scald or Earthquake. The EV investment in Special Defense allows Gastrodon to avoid the 2HKO from +2 Modest Omastar's Ice Beam after Stealth Rock and Leftovers recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gastrodon should be used as a check to Rock-, Water-, Electric-, and Poison-types like Lycanroc, Jellicent, non-Hidden Power Grass Lanturn, and Skuntank. It can then force them out and use Toxic on the switch-in, attack, or heal if low on health. Due to its Ground typing, it can be used to stop Volt Switch. However, it dislikes being hit by coverage moves that users of Volt Switch commonly use, such as Hidden Power Grass from Lanturn or Giga Drain from Eelektross. Due to its lack of offensive presence, it should mainly spread status with Scald and Toxic to cripple switch-ins like Eelektross when the foe can't cripple or hurt Gastrodon. However, it should be wary of status absorbers such as Clefairy and Stoutland. Since Gastrodon should stay healthy to check what it's supposed to, use Recover when Gastrodon is low on health. Recover should primarily be used on a predicted or forced switch to avoid giving up as much momentum. Gastrodon should be kept away from status, especially Toxic; while crippling threats such as Mudsdale and Poliwrath with Toxic seems wise, they often can cripple Gastrodon in return. Finally, while Gastrodon has great bulk, it shouldn't be switched in on hard hitters such as Stoutland, Choice Band Dodrio, and Drampa.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gastrodon fits well on balance and stall teams due to its typing and ability, letting it check dangerous threats for such builds such as Lycanroc and Choice Specs Jellicent. Since Gastrodon is weak to Grass-types, Pokemon that can deal with them such as Oricorio-E and Victreebel are necessary. The former can punish Quiver Dance Bellossom, while the latter can come in on a predicted Toxic from the likes of Mudsdale and Regirock. Skuntank is a solid option, as it can absorb Toxic Spikes, come in on a predicted Toxic, and remove entry hazards from the field for Gastrodon. Due to Gastrodon's susceptibility to Toxic Spikes, entry hazard removers make for good partners. Alolan Sandslash is a very solid partner, as it can switch into a predicted Toxic and Grass-type attacks and is immune to Toxic Spikes. Lurantis is another solid option, as it can also switch into Grass-type attacks. Status absorbers and clerics work well alongside Gastrodon due to its susceptibility to Toxic. Audino is a nice partner thanks to its access to Heal Bell, and Gastrodon can check the Rock-types Audino lets in for free. Stoutland can take Toxic for Gastrodon and appreciates Gastrodon's ability to check Rock-types. Pokemon that can deal with strong wallbreakers, such as Aurorus and Stoutland, that Gastrodon can't check work well alongside it. Therefore, Pokemon like Clefairy, which can check the former, and Metang, which can take on the latter, make for nice partners. In return, Gastrodon checks Poison-, Rock-, and Steel-types for Clefairy, while Gastrodon checks Fire-types for Metang. Articuno is another good partner, as it can even heal Gastrodon from status with Heal Bell while being able to check Grass-types and most special attackers. In return, Gastrodon checks Rock- and Steel-types.</p>"

  "Drifblim": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its ability Unburden, Drifblim is able to fill a tiny niche in the PU metagame as a sweeper able to outspeed common Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Kabutops. This is further bolstered by its access to Calm Mind, turning it into a threatening Pokemon thanks to its Speed and offensive capabilities. Its access to STAB Shadow Ball in conjunction with Hidden Power Fighting gives Drifblim unresisted coverage against the tier. Another aspect that makes Drifblim a threatening sweeper is its unorthodox way of setting up, which can be difficult to deal with when using an offensive team due to their lack of specially defensive Pokemon or faster Choice Scarf users. Despite these attributes, its weakness to common threats such as Lycanroc and Skuntank, which carry priority moves in the form of Accelerock and Sucker Punch, as well as an exploitable Speed prior to consuming its Sitrus Berry makes Drifblim susceptible to various threats such as Haunter, Oricorio-G, and Alolan Raichu. Another aspect that heavily reduces Drifblim's viability is its proneness to being walled by specially defensive Pokemon such as Lanturn, Eelektross, and Cryogonal as well as physical walls such as Regirock and Mudsdale. Drifblim is simply not able to break through these Pokemon unless it has managed to boost up its only decent Special Attack, it has weakened them enough, or the player has managed to remove those threats entirely beforehand. Drifblim also suffers from stiff competition from Ghost-types such as Haunter and Golurk as well as Flying-types such as Dodrio and Oricorio-E, all of which offer more immediate power, greater sweeping potential, or simply better utility.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set consisting of Acrobatics, Substitute, Will-O-Wisp, and Hex with maximum Attack and a Naughty nature allows Drifblim to function as more of a support Pokemon able to spread status while still being able to function as a sweeper late-game. However, despite the ability to threaten physical attackers better with Will-O-Wisp, this set is unable to get past a number of threats such as Aurorus, Regirock, Alolan Sandslash, and Aggron and still has a hard time getting past Skuntank and Lycanroc. Hidden Power Ground can be used to damage Skuntank on the switch but leaves Drifblim more vulnerable to Pokemon it can no longer hit 4x super effectively such as Alolan Sandslash.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Priority moves such as Accelerock and Ice Shard from Lycanroc and Abomasnow are able to effectively stop Drifblim after or prior to setup, but these foes can't switch in safely, since Drifblim is able to 2HKO both of them after Stealth Rock damage. Skuntank takes little damage from Drifblim's moves and is able to threaten it via Sucker Punch or even Crunch and Pursuit, though the player can attempt to outplay the Sucker Punch with Substitute. Absol can be put into the same situation, but it is naturally 2HKOed by Hidden Power Fighting, and Drifblim is able to circumvent Sucker Punch with Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Eelektross and Assault Vest Lanturn are able to switch in on an unboosted Drifblim and threaten it with their respective STAB moves. Pokemon such as Rotom-F and Alolan Raichu can't switch in on Drifblim safely but are able to revenge kill it prior to the activation of Unburden or acquisition of multiple Calm Mind boosts.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Audino, Cryogonal, Regirock, and Mudsdale are able to take hits from unboosted Drifblim and threaten it thanks to their natural bulk and moves, stopping it from setting up or sweeping if they haven't taken considerable amounts of damage prior. Audino and Cryogonal are even able to recover the damage Drifblim inflicts, making its breaking process even harder.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute should be used as a way of activating Drifblim's Sitrus Berry, and subsequently Unburden, in front of slower threats such as Tangela or Choice-locked Pokemon such as Primeape. This also grants it the possibility of outplaying Sucker Punch users such as Skuntank, as well as making it harder to revenge kill by the aforementioned threats and faster Choice Scarf users like Dodrio if running a Modest nature. Calm Mind grants Drifblim a way of boosting its Special Attack and Special Defense, which can be utilized in conjunction with Substitute so Pokemon such as Gastrodon and even bulky pivot Lanturn are unable to break its Substitute in one hit after a couple of boosts. Hidden Power Fighting allows Drifblim to hit Steel-, Rock-, and Ice-type Pokemon such as Alolan Sandslash, Aggron, and Aurorus for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Modest nature maximizes Drifblim's offensive capabilities while still leaving it with great Speed before Unburden is activated. Prior to Unburden, Drifblim is able to outspeed common threats such as Hitmonchan, Victreebel, and Jellicent, granting it multiple opportunities to set up a Substitute. After Unburden has been activated, Drifblim can outspeed common Choice Scarf users like Primeape, Kabutops, and Skuntank. A Timid nature can be used to outspeed Choice Scarf users such as Dodrio and Scyther. A Sitrus Berry is utilized so Drifblim can activate Unburden as early as possible in order to prevent being revenge killed by Pokemon such as Lycanroc or Eelektross when behind a Substitute.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Drifblim should be utilized mid- or late-game after Pokemon such as Regirock, Eelektross, and Skuntank and faster Choice Scarf users such as Dodrio have been removed from the field or worn down. In the case of Choice Scarf Dodrio, Drifblim should be behind a Substitute to avoid being revenge killed unless Drifblim is running a Timid nature. Bring in Drifblim in front of slower or weaker Pokemon such as Tangela, Gurdurr, and Aggron so it can set up with Substitute, thus activating its Sitrus Berry and Unburden.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard setters such as Mudsdale and Regirock are able to function as useful partners for Drifblim thanks to their ability to wear down Pokemon with Stealth Rock and spread status onto the opposing team. They're also able to counter Pokemon that Drifblim struggles to deal with such as Lycanroc and Skuntank; a healthy Mudsdale is even able to use Toxic on Pokemon such as Eelektross, which can help Drifblim set up late-game. Spikes setters like Qwilfish and Ferroseed are able to maximize chip damage with their hazards for Drifblim to sweep in the end game. Qwilfish is able to chip down physical threats with its Rocky Helmet and has the ability to set up Toxic Spikes, which pairs particularly well with Substitute from Drifblim, while Ferroseed is able to force out switch-ins thanks to its incredible defensive typing as well as punish physical attackers with Iron Barbs. Kangaskhan is a great partner that's able to chip down teams thanks to its combination of Fake Out + Sucker Punch and beat Pokemon like Clefairy and Golurk. Kangaskhan also benefits from Spikes, which further supports it in wearing down threats for Drifblim to sweep. Pivots such as Eelektross and Lanturn are able to pressure physical walls such as Regirock and Mudsdale thanks to their coverage options, as well as functioning as reliable ways of bringing in Drifblim safely. Spinners such as Cryogonal, Hitmonchan, and Alolan Sandslash are able to remove hazards on your side while also being able to take hits from Ice-types that might bother Drifblim such as Aurorus and Rotom-F. They're also able to spread status onto the opponent's team through Toxic, which Drifblim can take advantage of with Substitute.</p>"

However, this set is outclassed by Normal-types like Stoutland and Dodrio which both are far stronger; the former is a fast breaker and the latter has a superior ability to limit its number of possible switch-ins.

Purugly also suffers from pitiful bulk, leaving it susceptible to faster threats like Alolan Persian and priority users like Gurdurr. It sadly fails to dent bulkier Pokemon such as Jellicent and Alolan Sandslash due to its underwhelming firepower.

  "Skuntank": {
    "overview": "<p>Skuntank stands out as one of the most versatile Pokemon in PU, being able to serve as a revenge killer and Pursuit trapper while also possessing strong utility options such as Defog and Taunt; these traits, alongside having multiple viable sets, make it very easy to fit onto most teams. Skuntank's fantastic typing makes it one of the best Pursuit trappers and most reliable checks to various Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Bronzor, non-Barrier Musharna, and Jellicent while its ability to run multiple viable sets makes it difficult to predict at Team Preview and allows it to easily fit a team's needs; Choice Band sets can trade some reliability due to Choice locking for more reliably Pursuit trapping Jellicent and Metang and revenge killing Pokemon such as Simisear and Stoutland at higher HP, while Choice Scarf sets can instead let Skuntank more reliably check faster Pokemon such as Oricorio-G, Oricorio-E, and Simisear. Furthermore, Skuntank can choose to run specially attacking sets that help threaten switch-ins such as Mudsdale and Ferroseed more effectively and break through walls such as Torterra and Audino with moves like Acid Spray and Taunt. Skuntank's ability Aftermath also allows it to support its teammates by trading itself to chip physical attackers that use contact moves such as Primeape, Stoutland, Crabominable, and Dodrio, especially if holding a Rocky Helmet, letting it provide valuable support and momentum even when it is no longer useful. Skuntank is, however, held back by its overall average stats, facing competition from generally stronger Pursuit trappers such as Stoutland and Absol and struggling to switch repeatedly into Pokemon it checks such as Haunter and Musharna. Furthermore, its average attacking stats make it unreliable at revenge killing higher HP targets and cause it to struggle greatly against common physical walls such as Mudsdale, Regirock, and Gurdurr. It also faces competition as a revenge killer from Kangaskhan due to the latter's double priority, stronger STAB move in Double-Edge, and better coverage in Earthquake. Skuntank is also held back as a Defogger by its poor matchup versus common Stealth Rock setters such as Mudsdale, Regirock, and Torterra and its lack of reliable recovery, meaning it can struggle to support teams that are particularly vulnerable to Stealth Rock compared to other options such as Rotom-F, Swanna, and Lurantis that have better matchups versus the aforementioned setters and reliable recovery for the latter two.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Darkinium Z is an option on physical Skuntank that allows it to use a powerful Dark-type STAB attack versus Pokemon that could otherwise set up on it, such as Calm Mind Musharna, and gives it a single-use nuke for threats such as Aurorus and Stoutland. This comes at the cost of a teammate being able to use a Z-Move, however, and is hard to justify over more useful items such as Rocky Helmet and Black Sludge. Skuntank can also opt to run Memento with Darkinium Z, letting it fully heal a teammate when it is no longer useful in a match and provide free setup opportunities. Iapapa Berry is also an option on Skuntank to provide more longevity, but the healing provided by Black Sludge is more consistent due to the chance that Skuntank will not be able to activate its Iapapa Berry. Crunch is an option on physical Skuntank over Defog or Taunt to allow it to more directly threaten Pokemon such as Metang and Musharna but comes at the cost of a utility move or the ability to revenge kill faster Pokemon such as Dodrio and Simisear. Skuntank can also opt to run Taunt and Toxic together on its physical set, allowing it to spread poison for teammates such as Substitute + Protect Combusken and Calm Mind Musharna while preventing Pokemon such as Lanturn and Audino from using Heal Bell; however, this comes at the cost of one of Skuntank's attacking moves. Skuntank can choose to run a set with both Substitute and Toxic, allowing it to punish Pokemon such as Jellicent and Victreebel for switching out or using Strength Sap and allowing it to wear down Pokemon such as Mudsdale and Regirock with Toxic poison. This, however, comes at the cost of preventing Skuntank from running a utility move such as Taunt or Defog and one of its attacking moves. Fire Blast is an option on Choice Scarf Skuntank that allows it to threaten Alolan Sandslash and Ferroseed, although Skuntank cannot outspeed offensive Alolan Sandslash sets in hail, and Fire Blast is heavily prediction reliant and very weak against targets not 4x weak to Fire. Explosion is another option on Choice Scarf Skuntank that allows it to generate momentum and either heavily chip defensive Pokemon such as Mudsdale for a setup sweeper or remove an offensive threat such as Oricorio-E or Rotom-F in the process. Memento's ability to offer easier setup opportunities for sweepers such as Omastar is, however, generally more useful late-game.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Mudsdale and Torterra are capable of consistently switching into Skuntank's attacks due to their good bulk, can OHKO Skuntank in return with Earthquake, and can both consistently set up Stealth Rock versus teams where Skuntank is running Defog. They must, however, both watch out versus special Skuntank, which can KO them if they switch in on Acid Spray. More niche Ground-type options such as Gastrodon and Golurk can also threaten Skuntank, although Golurk cannot switch into Skuntank.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Physically defensive Pokemon such as Regirock, Gurdurr, and Ferroseed are capable of consistently switching into and walling physical Skuntank sets, using it as a free opportunity to set entry hazards or, in Gurdurr's case, set up with Bulk Up, although Ferroseed must watch out for Taunt. Conversely, specially defensive Pokemon such as Cryogonal, offensive Articuno, and Assault Vest Eelektross are capable of checking specially offensive Skuntank sets, although the latter two must watch out for Skuntank's Z-Move KOing them after switching into Acid Spray, and Cryogonal must watch out for Fire Blast after Acid Spray.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Skuntank's average Speed stat, it is outsped and revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Swanna, Simisear, and Rotom-F due to Sucker Punch's inability to KO them without considerable chip damage and the risk of Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-F. Skuntank also suffers from being slower than Pokemon such as Oricorio-G and Alolan Raichu that it must rely on Sucker Punch to deal with, allowing them to potentially outplay this with moves such as Roost and Substitute, which is an especially noticeable issue for Choice Band variants. While Choice Scarf sets are capable of outspeeding such Pokemon, as well as other Pokemon it can attempt to revenge kill such as Silvally-Fairy, they also suffer from being slower than common Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Dodrio as well as Alolan Sandslash under hail.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Due to Skuntank's mediocre damage output, setup sweepers such as Carracosta, Turtonator, and Gurdurr can take advantage of it for free setup opportunities, although they must watch out for sets running Taunt. Furthermore, Skuntank's reliance on Sucker Punch to revenge kill faster threats can allow Substitute users such as Alolan Raichu and Jynx to outplay it and potentially use it for free setup opportunities. Additionally, Choice item sets can be scouted with such moves and taken advantage by Pokemon such as Oricorio-E, Oricorio-G, and Torterra for free setup if Skuntank locks into, or is already locked into, Sucker Punch or Pursuit. Many of these Pokemon, however, must watch out for Choice Scarf sets running Punishment, which can revenge kill them after they set up.</p>",

      "Physically Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Pursuit allows Skuntank to trap Dark-weak Pokemon such as Haunter and Bronzor, as well as Cryogonal and weakened Jellicent. Sucker Punch allows Skuntank to revenge kill faster threats such as Alolan Raichu, as well as Dodrio and Ludicolo after chip damage. If another Pokemon on Skuntank's team has Defog or Rapid Spin, Taunt can be used to prevent Pokemon such as Regirock and Ferroseed from setting up Stealth Rock and foes such as Victreebel and non-Scald Jellicent from freely healing against or statusing it. Toxic is an option to help Skuntank punish switch-ins such as Regirock, Mudsdale, and Torterra, but it lacks the utility and team support that Defog and Taunt otherwise provide.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Aftermath allows Skuntank to punish Pokemon such as Primeape and Dodrio for KOing it with a contact move and can be used in conjunction with Sucker Punch to more reliably revenge kill such Pokemon by increasing the potential damage. Rocky Helmet allows Skuntank to punish contact moves such as Kangaskhan's Fake Out and Primeape's U-turn, and it pairs well with Aftermath by removing a considerable amount of HP from such Pokemon when Skuntank is KOed. Black Sludge is an alternative that offers Skuntank a passive form of recovery, letting it more reliably use Defog and Pursuit trap targets. Black Glasses is another alternative that increases the power of Skuntank's Pursuit and Sucker Punch, allowing it to revenge kill Pokemon such as Simisear from higher HP and pressure Bronzor and Musharna more.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Skuntank can make use of Sucker Punch to revenge kill weakened, faster threats such as Ludicolo under rain, Dodrio, and Simisear or try to Pursuit trap them when they switch out under the threat of Sucker Punch. Skuntank should watch out when using Sucker Punch against Oricorio-G, Simisear, and Alolan Raichu, however, if it is not yet known whether they are running Substitute. In matchups where Skuntank is necessary to Pursuit trap Pokemon such as Haunter and Future Sight Musharna, it should try to preserve its HP as much as possible to ensure it has enough HP to survive a hit from such Pokemon if they stay in. If Skuntank's running Rocky Helmet and low on HP or no longer useful in a match, it can be brought in on physical attackers such as Dodrio, Stoutland, Gurdurr, and Crabominable to deal a considerable amount of recoil to the foe through the combination of Aftermath and Rocky Helmet damage and offer a safe switch in to a teammate, although Skuntank should only attempt this versus Gurdurr if the former is at very low HP due to Drain Punch. If running Defog, since Skuntank does not have a good matchup versus common Stealth Rock setters such as Mudsdale, Regirock, and Torterra, it should primarily attempt to remove entry hazards on Pokemon that it can force out or is not threatened by such as Musharna, Clefairy, Sableye, and Cryogonal. If running Taunt, Skuntank can more readily Pursuit trap targets such as Victreebel and Jellicent for its teammates by preventing Victreebel from staying in and using Strength Sap and stopping Jellicent from using Recover or Will-O-Wisp; however, Skuntank will need to be brought in safely if it does not want to risk being burned, and it must watch out for Scald variants of Jellicent.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Water- and Grass-types such as Jellicent and Victreebel can help threaten Mudsdale and Regirock, which can both set Stealth Rock against and wall Skuntank. Victreebel can also help deal with Gurdurr and appreciates Skuntank Pursuit trapping Cryogonal and Musharna. Torterra can also help threaten Mudsdale and Regirock while being able to provide Stealth Rock support or a potential wincon with Rock Polish, and it also appreciates Skuntank Pursuit trapping the aforementioned targets. Teammates such as Regirock and Cryogonal can help check Oricorio-E and Oricorio-G, with Regirock also helping to check Kangaskhan and providing Stealth Rock support and Cryogonal helping Skuntank check Victreebel and Jellicent while allowing it to run Taunt or Toxic instead of Defog. Fighting-type Pokemon such as Primeape and Gurdurr appreciate Skuntank being able to Pursuit trap Future Sight Musharna and, if running Taunt, Victreebel. In return, they are able to pressure Regirock and Alolan Sandslash, while Primeape can provide Skuntank with free opportunities to Pursuit trap targets such as Jellicent through U-turn. Pokemon walled by Bronzor, such as Aurorus, Alolan Sandslash, Musharna, and Kangaskhan, appreciate Skuntank's Pursuit trapping. Aurorus can also help pressure Mudsdale and appreciates Skuntank's support in removing or preventing Stealth Rock from setters such as Bronzor and Regirock, while Musharna can offer Future Sight support to help pressure switch-ins such as Mudsdale and Regirock and check Gurdurr.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Pursuit allows Skuntank to trap Dark-weak Pokemon such as Musharna, Bronzor, Jellicent, and Haunter and weakened, slower Pokemon such as Stoutland, Victreebel, and Lanturn. Crunch offers Skuntank a reliable Dark-type STAB move, 2HKOing physically defensive sets of both Pokemon, although Skuntank should watch out for Earthquake from Metang.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band provides Skuntank with greatly increased damage potential on its moves, allowing it to be a more potent Pursuit trapper and revenge killer. It also allows Skuntank to 2HKO Calm Mind Musharna with Crunch and OHKO Abomasnow with Poison Jab. Maximum Speed with a Jolly nature is preferred to allow Skuntank to outspeed Adamant Kangaskhan and Jolly Absol, notably letting Skuntank revenge kill the latter after Stealth Rock damage. An Adamant nature can be run instead for better damage output, allowing Skuntank to better punish switch-ins such as Mudsdale and more reliably Pursuit trap Pokemon such as Jellicent and Metang while guaranteeing that Skuntank can OHKO Silvally-Fairy with Poison Jab.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Thanks to the increased damage output provided by Choice Band and threat of Choice Band-boosted Crunch, Skuntank is able to more reliably Pursuit trap threats such as Metang, Jellicent, and Victreebel that it would struggle with otherwise. Skuntank should, however, avoid directly switching into the former two and only switch into the latter's STAB moves, as it can be heavily punished by Metang's Earthquake, Jellicent's Will-O-Wisp, and Victreebel's Strength Sap. In general, Choice Band Skuntank should be very careful about locking into specific moves, especially when Pokemon that can punish them are still present. For instance, locking into Sucker Punch allows Pokemon such as Oricorio-G, Omastar, and Musharna to set up for free and is especially dangerous if Substitute users such as Combusken and Alolan Raichu are present. Locking into Pursuit can also offer Pokemon such as Carracosta and Oricorio-E free setup opportunities while giving powerful wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Drampa free turns. While not as dangerous as the previous two, locking into Poison Jab can instead offer free turns to Steel-types such as Aggron, Alolan Sandslash, and Ferroseed, the latter of which can take advantage of any move Skuntank locks into.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Physically defensive Pokemon such as Mudsdale, Regirock, and Gurdurr are capable of consistently walling Choice Band Skuntank. Teammates such as Victreebel, Jellicent, and Simisear can help break these Pokemon; in return, Victreebel appreciates Skuntank Pursuit trapping Cryogonal, Musharna, and Oricorio-G, while Choice Specs Simisear appreciates Jellicent being Pursuit trapped. Pivots such as Lanturn and Eelektross are able to bring Skuntank in on Pokemon such as Victreebel, Cryogonal, and Musharna that it can Pursuit trap. Eelektross can also help pressure Mudsdale and Regirock, while Assault Vest Lanturn can help check Omastar and non-Grassium Z Simisear, which can set up on Skuntank locked into Pursuit or Sucker Punch. Teammates such as Regirock and Cryogonal can check Pokemon such as Oricorio-E and Oricorio-G that may attempt to set up on Skuntank after locking into an unfavorable move. Lycanroc is a more offensive option that can also help revenge kill these Pokemon as well as Turtonator and Simisear that attempt to set up on Skuntank, although it will need some chip damage on Turtonator. Musharna pairs excellently with Choice Band Skuntank, as Skuntank is able to Pursuit trap problematic Pokemon such as Bronzor, Haunter, and Metang, while Musharna can provide Future Sight support to help punish switch-ins to Skuntank such as Mudsdale, Gurdurr, and Regirock and help check Gurdurr. Teammates such as Alolan Sandslash and Primeape appreciate Skuntank's ability to Pursuit trap Jellicent, enabling Alolan Sandslash to more easily remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin or break through the opposing team with Swords Dance. Primeape in particular invites Jellicent in and can use U-turn against it, bringing Skuntank in safely without risk of being burned. Teammates such as Aurorus, Swords Dance Silvally-Fairy, and Kangaskhan appreciate Skuntank Pursuit trapping Bronzor and Metang, enabling the former two to break enemy teams more easily. Silvally-Fairy in particular is able to bring Skuntank in on these Pokemon through U-turn.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Punishment is an alternative option to Defog that allows Skuntank to more easily beat setup sweepers such as Oricorio-E, Musharna, Turtonator, and Simisear. Memento is another option that allows Skuntank to sacrifice itself to offer a setup opportunity to one of its teammates late-game while providing free momentum; however, it is not as reliable when Regirock or Carbink are present due to Clear Body blocking the stat drops. Toxic can instead be run to cripple switch-ins such as Mudsdale and Regirock but is more situational, especially in matchups against Pokemon such as Qwilfish, and can be dangerous to lock into if predicted.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>While a Jolly nature is usually preferred for outspeeding +2 Omastar, an Adamant nature can instead be run to allow Skuntank to do more damage, notably guaranteeing that Skuntank KOes offensive Oricorio-G from full HP and bulky Oricorio-G after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Skuntank should be careful about what move it locks itself into, as locking into Pursuit could provide free opportunities for wallbreakers such as Drampa, Aurorus, and Crabominable or setup sweepers such as Carracosta and Oricorio-E; therefore, you should carefully consider this when using Pursuit. Locking into Defog is a very risky, last-resort option that leaves Skuntank wide open, and it should only be done when absolutely necessary. Thanks to the increased Speed from its Choice Scarf, Skuntank can be used to Pursuit trap faster, Dark-weak Pokemon such as Alolan Raichu and Jynx that could otherwise KO Skuntank or put it to sleep first, as well as weakened, fast threats such as Simisear, Lycanroc, Oricorio-E, and Swanna. Skuntank should be wary about attempting this versus the latter two Pokemon if it has not yet revealed that it is a Choice Scarf set, as they may attempt to heal with Roost predicting a Sucker Punch. If running Punishment, Skuntank can aim to use it versus Pokemon such as Carracosta, Calm Mind Oricorio-E, and Nasty Plot Simisear if they are already worn down; however, Skuntank should be careful not to reveal that it is a Choice Scarf variant or that it is running Punishment if attempting to do this to prevent the opponent swapping out and using Skuntank for free turns due to Punishment's low natural Base power.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pivots such as Silvally-Fairy, Lanturn, and Rotom-F can help Skuntank perform its roles more reliably despite its average defensive stats. Swords Dance Silvally-Fairy can help to put pressure on the physically defensive Pokemon Skuntank struggles with such as Mudsdale and Gurdurr while being able to pivot Skuntank in on Bronzor with U-turn so that it can be Pursuit trapped, allowing Silvally-Fairy to more reliably clean late-game. Lanturn can instead offer Heal Bell support, allowing Skuntank to attempt to Pursuit trap Jellicent with less fear of being burned, and if Skuntank is running Punishment, Lanturn can pivot into Calm Mind Oricorio-E and safely bring Skuntank in against it with Volt Switch. Rotom-F can help break Mudsdale and Torterra and offer Defog support so Skuntank can run a different move such as Punishment or Memento. Gurdurr is able to switch into Skuntank fairly safely and use it as setup fodder, so reliable checks such as Oricorio-E and Oricorio-G are helpful teammates. While it can't deal with Gurdurr well, Jellicent is another option that can effectively handle Choice Scarf Primeape and isn't weak to Stealth Rock, which is especially useful due to Choice Scarf Primeape outspeeding Skuntank. In return, these Pokemon appreciate Skuntank Pursuit trapping Cryogonal and, in non-Taunt Oricorio-E's case, Bronzor. Teammates such as Ludicolo and Abomasnow can help pressure Torterra, Mudsdale, and Regirock, helping create situations where Skuntank can potentially clean up late-game. Ludicolo can also offer an additional late-game sweeper and appreciates Memento support if Skuntank is running it, while Abomasnow appreciates Skuntank Pursuit trapping Bronzor and can bluff a Choice Scarf set to help Skuntank surprise foes such as Oricorio-G. Fighting-types such as Gurdurr, Primeape, and Combusken appreciate Skuntank's support in Pursuit trapping Pokemon such as Musharna and Alolan Raichu. Gurdurr can in return help check Regirock and Mudsdale and appreciates Skuntank's support against Oricorio-E and Oricorio-G, while Combusken can help patch up Skuntank's below-average Speed for a Choice Scarf user with Speed Boost and help break Pokemon such as Regirock and Torterra with a special attacking set. Alternatively, Swords Dance Combusken sets appreciate Memento support from Skuntank to more reliably set up late-game. Setup sweepers such as Carracosta, Omastar, and Rock Polish Torterra can help break through problematic Pokemon such as Mudsdale and Regirock, with Torterra in particular highly appreciating Skuntank Pursuit trapping Bronzor. All three can also take advantage of Memento support to set up more easily and become harder to revenge kill.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Acid Spray allows Skuntank to pressure usual switch-ins to other Skuntank sets such as Mudsdale, Torterra, Qwilfish, and Gurdurr, putting the former two into range of Skuntank's Z-Move. Sludge Bomb is an alternative that lets Skuntank more immediately threaten Silvally-Fairy and Gurdurr and attempt to poison switch-ins such as Regirock that Acid Spray cannot affect due to Clear Body. Taunt allows Skuntank to prevent entry hazard setters such as Regirock and Carbink, which otherwise wall it, from setting up Stealth Rock and, in conjunction with Acid Spray, allows Skuntank to break through Audino. Fire Blast is an alternative that lets Skuntank OHKO Ferroseed and Alolan Sandslash. It also allows Skuntank to do more damage to Torterra without using its Z-Move and lets it offensively check Victreebel.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Darkinium Z provides Skuntank with a powerful nuke that it can take advantage of in combination with Acid Spray to KO Pokemon such as Mudsdale and Torterra. Black Sludge is an alternative if another member of Skuntank's team has a Z-Crystal, providing it with a passive form of recovery and allowing it to use Defog more reliably. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Skuntank to outspeed Adamant Kangaskhan and Jolly Absol; however, a Modest nature can be run for higher damage output, allowing Skuntank to do more chip damage to Pokemon such as Gurdurr and Regirock on the switch in.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Skuntank can aim to use Acid Spray early- and mid-game on switches it forces versus Pokemon such as Victreebel and Jellicent to punish switch-ins such as Mudsdale, Gurdurr, and Eelektross. If Regirock or Carbink is present, however, Skuntank should only ever do this once they have been crippled or removed due to Clear Body preventing Special Defense drops and should instead either use Taunt on the switch or double switch to a Pokemon that can pressure them. Skuntank should be careful about when it uses its Z-Move, as this is usually a very obvious move after Skuntank has used Acid Spray versus a Pokemon such as Mudsdale, and it may be useless if the opponent switches out. If another Pokemon such as Cryogonal or Lanturn is present that may attempt to switch into the Z-Move, Skuntank should ideally wait until they are removed or in range of the Z-Move and focus more on using Dark Pulse when predicting Mudsdale to switch in. Skuntank should prioritize using Defog on switches it forces versus Pokemon such as Jellicent, Musharna, and Bronzor. If Skuntank is running Taunt, it can more freely use Defog while Regirock is still healthy and use Taunt on it after it switches into Skuntank, although it must watch out for Regirock running Earthquake. Skuntank should, however, prioritize attacking Mudsdale if expecting it to come in because Skuntank can't prevent it from setting Stealth Rock back up. If running Taunt, Skuntank can aim to use it when predicting a Pokemon such as Regirock or Carbink to switch in, preventing them setting up Stealth Rock. Skuntank can also aim to use it versus sweepers such as Turtonator, Omastar, and Carracosta that attempt to set up on Skuntank. If running Fire Blast, be careful not to reveal that Skuntank is running a special set early in the match if teammates that appreciate Ferroseed and Alolan Sandslash being removed are present, as the opponent will likely anticipate that you are running Fire Blast after this.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Lycanroc and Stoutland appreciate Skuntank weakening Mudsdale and Gurdurr, allowing them to more easily break the enemy team. Lycanroc in particular can help check problematic special walls such as Articuno and Cryogonal as well as Calm Mind Oricorio-E, which can set up on Skuntank, while Skuntank benefits from Stoutland wearing down a shared check in Regirock, allowing it to more easily keep entry hazards off the field. Pokemon such as Golurk, Victreebel, and Eelektross that can pressure Regirock and Carbink make for good teammates; Golurk can set Stealth Rock; Victreebel can pressure Gurdurr and Mudsdale so that Skuntank can save its Z-Move as well as help wear down Eelektross and check Assault Vest Hitmonchan; and Eelektross can check Cryogonal with Drain Punch, wear down Mudsdale so that Skuntank can save its Z-Move, and bring Skuntank in on Pokemon such as Musharna and Audino that it can help break. Teammates such as Regirock and Metang can help to consistently check Silvally-Fairy, making up for Skuntank's inability to reliably pressure it when running Acid Spray. They can also help pressure special walls such as Articuno and Cryogonal and offer Stealth Rock support; in return, they appreciate Skuntank pressuring Jellicent, Victreebel, and Sableye. Oricorio-E and Oricorio-G can help check Gurdurr and appreciate Skuntank being able to remove specially defensive Alolan Sandslash with Fire Blast. Taunt Skuntank sets can instead help pressure Audino and appreciate their help dealing with Victreebel. Skuntank also enjoys Oricorio-E being able to poison its checks such as Regirock, Lanturn, and Eelektross with Toxic. Fighting-types such as Primeape and Gurdurr appreciate Skuntank taking on Jellicent, Musharna, and Victreebel. Primeape and Skuntank can wear down down shared checks such as Mudsdale and Gurdurr, while Primeape and Gurdurr can help pressure Regirock and Carbink and specially defensive Pokemon such as Lanturn and Eelektross. If Skuntank is running Fire Blast, Pokemon such as Kangaskhan, Aurorus, and Musharna enjoy its ability to lure in and KO Ferroseed and Alolan Sandslash, especially specially defensive variants of the latter. In return, Aurorus is able to help pressure Mudsdale, Regirock, and Torterra, Kangaskhan can help pressure Pokemon such as Cryogonal and Calm Mind Oricorio-E, and Musharna can provide Future Sight support to help chip switch-ins to Skuntank such as Regirock and Carbink and provide an answer to specially defensive Pokemon that Skuntank struggles with such as Assault Vest Hitmonchan and Eelektross.</p>"

  "Bronzor": {
    "overview": "<p>Bronzor is an incredibly passive Pokemon that must rely on the combination of Psywave and Toxic to chip down opposing Pokemon. This often leaves it as setup fodder for Pokemon like Ferroseed and RestTalk Spiritomb that don't mind Toxic; additionally, when asleep, Bronzor can be exploited by setup sweepers like Nasty Plot Alolan Raichu and Shell Smash Omastar. Bronzor is also heavily reliant on its Eviolite to serve as an effective defensive switch-in, meaning if it loses its Eviolite to Knock Off from Tangela or Trick from Rotom-F, it struggles to keep up defensively. Furthermore, because it must hold an Eviolite to actually check what it wants to, Bronzor cannot hold an item such as Leftovers or a pinch Berry to provide it with passive recovery and must depend on the unreliable Rest. Bronzor's passivity generally restricts it to slower, bulkier teams, where it can truly showcase its benefits; its Steel/Psychic typing, access to Levitate, and excellent bulk allows Bronzor to switch into a range of strong wallbreakers, including but not limited to Aurorus, Victreebel, Torterra, and Lycanroc. Bronzor also has a notable type advantage against most other Stealth Rock users in the tier, giving it the upper hand in matchups against its competition in Metang, Mudsdale and Regirock. For these reasons, Bronzor is a solid option for a Stealth Rock user, albeit a fairly niche one due to the extensive support it requires to function effectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bronzor can forgo Stealth Rock if a teammate already has it and use Sleep Talk, letting it become less passive while asleep. Reflect can also be used over Stealth Rock and helps prevent Bronzor from being Pursuit trapped.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Skuntank is affected by neither Toxic nor Psywave, can switch directly into Bronzor to clear its Stealth Rock, and threatens to 3HKO Bronzor with either Crunch or Dark Pulse. Spiritomb can switch into Bronzor's Psywave, set up Calm Mind, and use Rest to clear status from Toxic and restore its health. Dark-type wallbreakers like Alolan Raticate, Absol, and Shiftry can threaten to set up against Bronzor and OHKO it with strong STAB attacks or remove its Eviolite with Knock Off, although they do not appreciate being badly poisoned by Toxic. Additionally, Skuntank, Spiritomb, Alolan Raticate and Absol are all capable of Pursuit trapping Bronzor.</p> <p><strong>Loss of Eviolite</strong>: Knock Off users like Ferroseed, Alolan Sandslash, and Dodrio can cripple Bronzor for the rest of the battle by removing its Eviolite. Trick users, notably Rotom-F, can also threaten to remove Bronzor's Eviolite and severely compromise its defenses.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Haunter is immune to Toxic and threatens heavy damage with Shadow Ball. Defensive variants of Jellicent can threaten to shut Bronzor down with Taunt, while Choice Specs Jellicent 2HKOes it with Shadow Ball. Oricorio-G can pressure Bronzor to switch out and set up Substitute or Calm Mind, but it risks being crippled by Toxic if it directly switches into Bronzor before it can use Taunt. Sableye can Taunt Bronzor and prevent it from doing anything to Sableye.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Although none of them enjoy being badly poisoned, Pokemon like Omastar, Carracosta, and Alolan Raichu can use Bronzor as setup fodder and then heavily pressure it with strong STAB attacks or Z-Moves. Additionally, Alolan Raichu can use Substitute to bypass Toxic, further worsening this matchup.</p>",

Rest gives Bronzor a source of consistent recovery and removes status inflicted upon it by Pokemon such as Lanturn and Poliwrath, although it forces Bronzor to be asleep.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs and 88 Special Defense EVs in conjunction with a Calm nature allows Bronzor to avoid being OHKOed by Drampa's Fire Blast while still maintaining enough defense to take a +4 Splintered Stormshards from Lycanroc. Levitate provides Bronzor with an immunity to Ground, assisting it in checking Ground-types like Alolan Dugtrio and Mudsdale.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bronzor can gain good opportunities to set up Stealth Rock by switching into Pokemon it checks like Aurorus and setting Stealth Rock as they switch out. If Stealth Rock is already up, Bronzor should look to use these free turns to spread additional damage via Toxic or Psywave, punishing set up sweepers and strong breakers like Simisear and Choice Specs Jellicent looking to take advantage of Bronzor's passive nature. Pursuit trappers like Absol and Skuntank can make quick work of Bronzor; if the opposing team has one, it is often best to double switch into a check like Gurdurr or Mudsdale instead of sacrificing Bronzor. Although Bronzor is capable of checking Pokemon such as Dodrio and Alolan Sandslash, scouting these Pokemon for super effective coverage options is crucial in order to keep Bronzor healthy enough to later keep the likes of Torterra in check. Be careful of switching Bronzor into Pokemon that can carry Trick or Knock Off like Rotom-F, Tangela, and Ferroseed, as Bronzor needs its Eviolite to check prominent Rock- and Normal-type wallbreakers like Lycanroc and Stoutland. While Rest is great for clearing status like burn and paralysis from Bronzor as well as healing it back to full, it comes with the drawback of putting Bronzor asleep. Because of this, don't rely heavily on Rest as the main means of restoring Bronzor's health, as an asleep Bronzor can be easily exploited by setup sweepers like Kangaskhan and Ludicolo.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bronzor fits best on defensive and stall builds that can cover its deficiencies via the defensive and utility capabilities of its teammates. Audino is a great partner for Bronzor, as it can use Wish to keep Bronzor at a good percentage of health and carries Heal Bell to remove status like burn and sleep from Bronzor. Other clerics like Altaria and Articuno pair well with Bronzor, as Altaria can switch into Knock Off from Pokemon like Gurdurr for Bronzor, while Articuno helps check special attackers Bronzor struggles with like Oricorio-G and Choice Specs Jellicent. Bronzor is weak to Dark-types, so Fighting-types like Gurdurr and Primeape that can threaten Pokemon like Skuntank, Alolan Persian and Absol are useful. Gurdurr in particular is also able to assist Bronzor by serving as a secondary check to physical attackers like Aggron, Kangaskhan and Stoutland, preventing Bronzor from being as easily worn down. In return, Bronzor offers a consistent switchin to the Poison- and Psychic-types like Victreebel and Musharna that Gurdurr and Primeape struggle with, while also whittling away at physical walls like Mudsdale and Tangela. While Skuntank may be Bronzor's toughest opponent, it also makes for a decent partner; Access to Pursuit gives Skuntank means to trap the Ghost-types that haunt Bronzor, namely Haunter and Choice Specs Jellicent, while Skuntank benefits from Bronzor's immunity to Ground-type moves. Qwilfish can form an entry hazard stacking core with Bronzor, utilising Spikes and potentially also Toxic Spikes to further chip away at grounded foes. Bulky Water-types like Jellicent, Poliwrath, and Lanturn appreciate Bronzor's ability to check Grass-types like Victreebel and Torterra and Freeze Dry users like Cryogonal, and offer a resistance to Fire-types like Combusken and Simisear in return. If Bronzor is being used on a stall team, other common staples like Pyukumuku, Mudsdale, and Qwilfish work well alongside Bronzor. Pyukumuku walls setup sweepers like Gurdurr, Alolan Sandslash, and Rest Musharna that may try to use Bronzor as setup fodder, while Rocky Helmet variants of Mudsdale and Qwilfish can sponge Knock Off.</p>"

  "Spiritomb": {
    "overview": "<p>Spiritomb's good defensive typing, which gives it three useful immunities to Fighting, Psychic, and Normal, decent bulk, and access to a fairly solid support movepool with moves like Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, and Calm Mind give it great defensive presence. Spiritomb is also capable of providing useful offensive support to teams threatened by Pokemon like Haunter and Oricorio-G due to its access to a fairly strong Pursuit and Sucker Punch, giving its Pursuit Trapper set a good mix of attributes. Spiritomb is also capable of acting as a bulky setup sweeper on bulkier teams because of its access to Calm Mind. However, Spiritomb's solid mixed bulk is offset by its low HP, and its lack of reliable recovery in tandem with its vulnerability to entry hazards only makes wearing it down easier, which can hurt its longevity in longer matches. Calm Mind Spiritomb is forced to rely on Rest for recovery, which can be taken advantage of by strong attackers like Stoutland. Spiritomb's low Speed also tends to leave it more reliant on Sucker Punch than it would like to be, which can be capitalized on by setup sweepers such as Omastar.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Psychic variants of Spiritomb can opt to run 96 EVs in Speed in order to offset its speed-reducing nature, outpace Gurdurr, and threaten it before it gets to use Knock Off. A Choice Band set with Trick instead of Will-O-Wisp can be used to make Spiritomb stronger while also giving it the ability to cripple both defensive threats and setup sweepers, but being locked into Sucker Punch is far from ideal because it gives bulkier setup sweepers like Gurdurr free setup opportunities. Life Orb can also be used to increase Spiritomb's damage output, but the recoil damage coupled with its lack of reliable recovery isn't very appealing. Pain Split gives Spiritomb a form of recovery that doesn't temporarily incapacitate it, allowing it to take advantage of its low HP stat against Pokemon with high HP stats such as Audino and Lanturn. Shadow Sneak can be used as a secondary and more reliable form of priority for teams that are weaker to Jynx; however, it is much weaker than Sucker Punch and isn't as useful as its other moves. Substitute and Protect can be used over Rest and Sleep Talk on Calm Mind Spiritomb as another way to effectively stall the opponent's PP with Pressure, but Spiritomb's low Speed puts it at risk of getting crippled with Toxic before it can put up a Substitute. Snarl can be used over Dark Pulse on Calm Mind Spiritomb, since it can bypass Substitute and gives Spiritomb an easier time against strong special attackers like Aurorus, though Dark Pulse is usually more reliable due to its higher Base Power and accuracy. Rocky Helmet can be used to punish weaker, neutral attacks such as U-turn from Primeape and Thunder Punch from Hitmonchan, though it leaves Spiritomb weaker and without any form of recovery. Memento is an interesting support option that can be used on more offensive teams to ease setup for teammates such as Belly Drum Zangoose.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Clefairy, Granbull, Mawile, and Silvally-Fairy can all switch into Spiritomb's STAB attacks fairly easily and threaten it with their respective super effective STAB attacks. In particular, Clefairy is very annoying for Spiritomb to deal with, since Clefairy doesn't take much from any attack either Spiritomb variant can use, boasts reliable recovery in Soft-Boiled, and can even potentially set up with Calm Mind alongside Spiritomb. None of them aside from Clefairy appreciate switching into Will-O-Wisp, however.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Because of Spiritomb's merely average offenses, it often struggles with bulkier Pokemon. Physically bulky Pokemon such as Regirock and Tangela are annoying for the Pursuit trapping variant to bypass, while Calm Mind Spiritomb struggles with breaking through special walls like Munchlax and Encore variants of Audino without a few boosts.</p> <p><strong>Stronger Attackers</strong>: Strong wallbreakers such as Aggron, Aurorus, and Stoutland are capable of muscling past Spiritomb even with its good mixed bulk. However, Aurorus lacking Frost Breath faces issues with breaking Calm Mind Spiritomb if it has obtained enough Special Defense boosts from Calm Mind, while Aggron doesn't like switching in on Will-O-Wisp from Pursuit trapping variants.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Absol, Alolan Raticate, Shiftry, and special Skuntank can exploit Calm Mind variants, either by setting up Swords Dance against it and breaking through it, or by eventually overpowering it after a few Acid Spray drops, respectively. Special Skuntank can also easily switch into physical sets without the fear of Will-O-Wisp.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Pursuit Trapper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Pursuit allows Spiritomb to trap and severely weaken mainly Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Haunter and Alolan Raichu as well as pivots such as Eelektross and Primeape as they switch out. Sucker Punch is Spiritomb's strongest form of priority, threatening to pick off frailer Pokemon such as Dodrio after a bit of chip damage. Sucker Punch and Pursuit pair well with one another due to Ghost- and Psychic-types' tendency to switch out in an attempt to avoid the former, causing them to get trapped and heavily weakened by the latter instead. Foul Play is a more reliable STAB attack that threatens foes that attempt to take advantage of Spiritomb's reliance on Sucker Punch like Lycanroc. Psychic can instead be used to lure in and deal decent damage to Gurdurr and Victreebel, which would otherwise give Spiritomb issues due to the former not minding being burned and the latter stalling out Spiritomb with Strength Sap. Finally, Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers like Kangaskhan as well as Spiritomb's checks like Alolan Persian. Taunt is an alternative that can be used over Will-O-Wisp to shut down defensive Pokemon such as Audino and Sableye, which can prove useful if Spiritomb's team has an unfavorable matchup against stall.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The investment in HP and Attack maximizes Spiritomb's mixed bulk and offensive presence. An Adamant nature is used to further augment Spiritomb's Attack; however, if Spiritomb is using Psychic, a Brave nature should be used instead to preserve its Special Attack. Figy Berry is the preferred item, since it mitigates Spiritomb's lack of recovery by restoring 50% of its HP after it takes enough damage. Black Glasses is an alternative that increases the power of Spiritomb's Dark-type attacks. Infiltrator allows Spiritomb to bypass the Substitutes of Pokemon such as Alolan Dugtrio, Jynx, and Oricorio-G, which prevents them from attempting to play around its attacks as they would with other users of Sucker Punch such as Absol and Skuntank.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Spiritomb should mainly act as a revenge killer due to the combination of Sucker Punch and Pursuit allowing it to create mind games with and pick off weakened foes. Due to how setup sweepers can take advantage of Spiritomb's reliance on Sucker Punch, it should be wary of using it against them. Spiritomb should mainly switch into STAB moves from Pokemon such as Musharna and Primeape, since it is immune to them. Pursuit should be used whenever Spiritomb anticipates a foe to switch out, as it is fairly strong and can wear them down faster than they would like. Pursuit can also be useful for putting foes in range of Sucker Punch. Exercise caution when using Will-O-Wisp if the opponent has a Fire-type, as they can absorb it and force Spiritomb out with their strong STAB attacks. If Spiritomb isn't running Foul Play, it doesn't have any reliably strong attacks, meaning that it will have to be a bit more careful against foes such as Carracosta, since they can potentially play around Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spiritomb's weakness to Fairy means that checks to Fairy-types such as Aggron, Alolan Dugtrio, and Victreebel make for good partners. In return, these Pokemon appreciate Spiritomb checking Fighting- and Psychic-types. Entry hazard setters such as Clefairy, Qwilfish, Ferroseed, and Roselia appreciate Spiritomb's Ghost typing allowing it to spinblock. In return, the entry hazards wear down Spiritomb's switch-ins and bring frailer Pokemon into range of Sucker Punch. Due to Spiritomb's lack of recovery outside of Figy Berry, entry hazard removal from the likes of Hitmonchan and Swanna is appreciated, since they can prevent entry hazards from wearing Spiritomb down faster. Hitmonchan also appreciates Spiritomb trapping and removing Ghost-types like Haunter and Oricorio-G, since this makes using Rapid Spin easier. Fighting- and Normal-type Pokemon such as Gurdurr, Primeape, and Zangoose appreciate Spiritomb both trapping and removing Ghost- and Psychic-types and potentially luring in opposing Gurdurr, since this allows them to more freely spam their respective STAB attacks. In return, they can take on bulkier Steel-types such as Aggron and Probopass. Special wallbreakers such as Aurorus and Drampa can break a lot of the physically bulky Pokemon that have little problems switching in on Spiritomb's attacks like Tangela, with neither of them minding Will-O-Wisp.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind increases Spiritomb's Special Attack and Special Defense, gradually making it more and more of a threatening sweeper. Dark Pulse is Spiritomb's only attack, having useful neutral coverage and becoming rather strong after enough boosts from Calm Mind. Rest gives Spiritomb a form of recovery that also rids it of status conditions and allows it to absorb status while asleep. Sleep Talk allows Spiritomb to use one of its moves while asleep, preventing it from being completely helpless.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The investment in HP and Defense in conjunction with a Bold nature serves to maximize Spiritomb's physical bulk, making it annoying to take down due to Calm Mind increasing its Special Defense. Leftovers gives Spiritomb a form of passive recovery, lessening the need to use Rest. Alternatively, Darkinium Z can be used to reduce the damage Spiritomb takes from Knock Off and prevent it from being crippled by Trick and Switcheroo while also turning Dark Pulse into Black Hole Eclipse, which is fairly strong even unboosted and can prove useful for heavily damaging specially bulky Pokemon like Altaria on top of Dark-resistant foes like Skuntank. Pressure allows Spiritomb to serve as annoyance to Pokemon that are reliant on attacks with low PP such as Aurorus as well as opposing bulky setup sweepers like Type: Null.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Spiritomb should mainly attempt to set up with Calm Mind late-game, as by this point, a lot of the stronger wallbreakers and Fairy-types that would otherwise prevent Spiritomb from setting up will either have been removed or weakened enough to be KOed. Use Rest once Spiritomb begins to take noticeable damage, as this prevents it from being worn down too fast and gets rid of any status that may be plaguing it beforehand while also letting it act as an emergency status absorber in case nothing else wants to switch in on status moves like Toxic. Spiritomb should aim to pivot into Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan and Throh and take advantage of how little they are capable of doing to it by either setting up or using Rest if necessary. Although not very common, Spiritomb should be wary of potential users of Switcheroo and Trick such as Rotom-F if it isn't using Darkinium Z since it can render it completely useless. Darkinium Z variants should preserve their Z-Move until they need to break through special walls that they otherwise cannot bypass, such as Munchlax and Type: Null.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Calm Mind Spiritomb fits on balance and stall teams in need of a bulky late-game sweeper that can also check Fighting-, Psychic-, and Normal-types, though it does have a place on bulky offensive teams as well. Audino makes for a premier partner due to its ability to provide Wish + Heal Bell support to keep Spiritomb healthy without forcing it to use Rest, switch into many of the stronger special attackers that threaten Spiritomb out prior to it using Calm Mind, and bait in Fighting-types for Spiritomb to take advantage of. Heal Bell also wakes Spiritomb up, which prevents it from having to burn sleep turns. In a similar vein, other special walls such as Carbink and Clefairy are good partners, with both providing entry hazard support and checking threatening special wallbreakers prior to Spiritomb setting up. Pokemon that can check Fairy-types such as Aggron, Simisear, and Roselia make for good teammates, since they are a relatively hard stop to Spiritomb and can render Spiritomb's attempts at setting up pointless. Entry hazards can prove useful for wearing down Dark-resistant foes such as Silvally-Fairy, so setters of entry hazards such as Qwilfish, Carbink, and Clefairy are good partners. Qwilfish also has the ability to switch into and cripple Clefairy with Taunt and weaken it with Sludge Bomb, while Carbink can check Scrappy users such as Kangaskhan and Stoutland.</p>"

Swanna has reliable recovery and offers more offensive pressure with its secondary typing, while Silvally-Water has higher stats all around while still being able to serve as a defensive wall and pivot. Bar its decent Speed tier, Lumineon possesses mediocre stats that give it trouble switching into moves and dealing any offensive damage. Its lack of reliable recovery furthers this, as well as its susceptibility to all entry hazards and weakness to Toxic from hazard setters like Regirock and Alolan Sandslash, which leads to Lumineon struggling as a Defogger. Jellicent is also a far better defensive Water-type by virtue of its superior bulk, access to recovery, and a useful secondary typing.</p>",

  "Abomasnow": {
    "overview": "<p>Abomasnow is a decent wallbreaker with a great offensive typing, a good movepool, and decent offensive stats. It also has a great ability in Snow Warning, which allows it to spam Blizzard without a fear of missing, constantly wears down foes, limits certain healing moves such as Musharna's Moonlight, and puts a stop to rain and sun teams. These attributes let Abomasnow perform a wide variety of roles, most notably as a mixed wallbreaker, a Choice Scarf user, and a Swords Dance sweeper. However, one of Abomasnow's major setbacks is in its Speed. This, combined with its terrible defensive typing, allows many Pokemon to KO it relatively easily. Abomasnow is also easily worn down by Stealth Rock and potential recoil from Life Orb and Wood Hammer. Furthermore, it faces a lot of competition from other wallbreakers, particularly Aurorus which is slightly stronger and has better defensive typing. However, Abomasnow's niche comes from its near-unresisted combination of STAB moves and coverage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Soundproof allows Abomasnow to switch in on Hyper Voice from Pokemon such as Drampa and Aurorus. However, without an accurate Blizzard, Abomasnow has a much more difficult time breaking through walls such as Sableye. Choice Specs can provide more damage output as a wallbreaker, but Abomasnow prefers the ability to switch between coverage moves and does not appreciate having to be completely special. This set is also outclassed by Aurorus. Grass Whistle can put the opposing Pokemon to sleep, allowing Abomasnow to break through them while they do nothing in return, but it is rather unreliable due to its low accuracy and forces Abomasnow to lose out on coverage. A combination of Substitute and Leech Seed can allow Abomasnow to stall out opposing Pokemon with the chip damage of Leech Seed and Hail, but Abomasnow usually lacks the bulk to use it successfully. Growth boosts both Abomasnowâ€™s Attack and Special Attack, but it is generally outclassed by Swords Dance as a setup option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Simisear and Combusken outspeed Abomasnow and OHKO it with Fire Blast. Both of them have to watch out for Earthquake, however.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Primeape and Life Orb Hitmonchan can outspeed Abomasnow and OHKO it with their STAB attacks. However, non-Choice Scarf variants of Primeape are outsped by Choice Scarf Abomasnow. Slower Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Assault Vest Hitmonchan can take a hit before KOing in return, or they can take Abomasnow out with Mach Punch if it has taken enough damage already.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially Defensive Pokemon such as Clefairy, Type: Null, and Audino can switch in on non-Swords Dance Abomasnow and use it to set up Stealth Rock or Swords Dance, or they can whittle it down with Toxic. Mixed Wallbreaker Abomasnow can 2HKO Audino with Focus Blast, however.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Certain Steel-types such as Alolan Dugtrio and Alolan Sandslash can outspeed Abomasnow and OHKO it with Iron Head, although Alolan Dugtrio does not want to take a +2 Ice Shard. Alolan Sandslash can also take advantage of Abomasnow's hail, even after Abomasnow is KOed. Bronzor is notable, as it resists all of Abomasnowâ€™s attacks except Focus Blast and can take advantage of Abomasnow to set up Stealth Rock, heal off any damage with Rest, or whittle Abomasnow down with Toxic and Psywave. Some bulky Steel-types like Aggron can deal with Abomasnow's Choice Scarf set if it is locked into a resisted move, but otherwise they have to watch out for super effective coverage moves. Finally, Metang can take a hit before OHKOing Abomasnow with Meteor Mash or possibly 2HKOing it with Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Throughout the game, Abomasnow can be worn down by various forms of chip damage such as entry hazards, Toxic poison, and recoil from Life Orb or Wood Hammer. This makes Abomasnow much easier to revenge kill, especially when combined with its mediocre Speed and defenses.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Blizzard serves as Abomasnow's main STAB attack, and its high Base Power allows Abomasnow to hit bulky Pokemon such as Tangela. It also does not have to worry about missing thanks to Snow Warning. Giga Drain is another STAB move that supplies coverage against Water-types and some other Ice-resistant Pokemon, such as Carracosta, Lanturn, Qwilfish, and Aurorus. It also gives Abomasnow a form of recovery that pairs well with Life Orb. Wood Hammer is an alternative Grass-type STAB move that can hit certain specially defensive threats such as Clefairy and Eelektross, but it causes Abomasnow to take significant recoil damage. Earthquake gives Abomasnow a way to hit Fire- and Steel-types such as Simisear and Alolan Sandslash on the switch in. Focus Blast is an alternate coverage option over Earthquake that still hits Steel-types and also hits certain Pokemon that are neutral to Earthquake like Type: Null and Munchlax, though at the cost of lower accuracy. Ice Shard allows Abomasnow to threaten faster foes and KO frailer or weakened Pokemon, such as Oricorio-G, boosted Torterra, and Dodrio.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in Special Attack and Speed and a Life Orb let Abomasnow hit as strong and fast as possible. A Hasty nature allows it to outspeed Pokemon such as Timid Aurorus and Modest Ludicolo. Abomasnow can also run a Mild nature in order to hit harder at the cost of being outsped by the aforementioned threats. In both cases, a Defense-lowering nature is used over a Special Defense-lowering one so Abomasnow can more easily check certain special Water- and Grass-types, such as non-Hidden Power Fire Lanturn and Bellossom, without weakening its physical attacks. Snow Warning increases the accuracy of Blizzard, whittles down foes, and restricts the recovery of Pokemon like Musharna to ease Abomasnow's attempts to break through them.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Abomasnow should be used to break slower and bulkier foes such as Drampa, Gastrodon, and Sableye. This should be done early- to mid-game so that late-game sweepers and cleaners can have an easier time fulfilling their roles. Be wary that many of these bulkier Pokemon will switch out immediately when Abomasnow is brought in, so be prepared to double switch or use Earthquake or Focus Blast in order to KO a predicted Fire- or Steel-type switch-in. Abomasnow can also wear them down over time, as they take a decent amount from Blizzard and hail's chip damage. Abomasnow should not switch directly into attacks, as it needs to stay as healthy as possible in order to effectively wallbreak. It can be brought in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch user, such as Type: Null or Lanturn, or after a teammate has been KOed. Abomasnow can also make use of aggressive double switches to come in safely. Ice Shard should be used to revenge kill weakened faster foes such as Scyther and Dodrio. Abomasnow can take advantage of Giga Drain to regain health lost from Life Orb recoil, entry hazards, or any other forms of damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fast Pokemon such as Floatzel and setup sweepers such as Alolan Raichu, Carracosta, and Lycanroc appreciate Abomasnow's ability to break down bulkier foes such as Regirock and Eelektross so that they can more easily clean late-game. Fire-type checks such as Silvally-Dragon and Lanturn can help against Pokemon such as Simisear that can give Abomasnow trouble. Fighting-types such as Primeape and Hitmonchan can also give Abomasnow issues, so Pokemon such as Jellicent, Oricorio-G, and Silvally-Fairy can come in handy. Slow pivots such as Eelektross and Lanturn can take hits in order to bring Abomasnow in safely. Stealth Rock and other entry hazards work well with hail to whittle down foes such as Regirock and Lanturn, making them easier for Abomasnow to break through. Good examples of hazard setters include Mudsdale and Qwilfish. Conversely, Abomasnow dislikes having to take damage from entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, so hazard removers such as Skuntank and Hitmonchan can keep Abomasnow healthy. Finally, Abomasnow can form a decent core with Alolan Sandslash, which takes advantage of Snow Warning thanks to Slush Rush, can remove entry hazards for Abomasnow using Rapid Spin, and breaks through certain special walls such as Clefairy. In return, Abomasnow can break through certain physical walls like Jellicent.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Blizzard is Abomasnow's strongest STAB option, and it hits Pokemon such as Dodrio and Oricorio-E super effectively. Giga Drain is Abomasnow's Grass-type STAB attack that gives it a form of recovery and hits some Pokemon that resist Blizzard such as Jellicent, Kabutops, and Aurorus. Focus Blast gives Abomasnow coverage for Steel-types like Alolan Sandslash that would otherwise wall Abomasnow. Earthquake hits Fire-types such as Simisear and Combusken and can hit Steel-types like Aggron more reliably than Focus Blast. It also allows Abomasnow to 2HKO physically frail Pokemon such as Jynx. Energy Ball can be run over Giga Drain for slightly more power, but Abomasnow prefers the ability to regain health.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in Special Attack and Speed maximize Abomasnow's offensive presence. A Choice Scarf, when combined with a Naive nature, allows Abomasnow to outspeed everything under base 115 Speed, such as Oricorio-E, and it also lets Abomasnow outspeed some boosted Pokemon such as +2 Carracosta. Snow Warning, on top of giving Blizzard perfect accuracy, can be used to stop opposing weathers, which lets Abomasnow revenge kill weather sweepers such as Kabutops and Shiftry. A Naive nature is used so that Abomasnow does not weaken Earthquake and takes decreased damage from priority attacks such as Lycanroc's Accelerock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>With a Choice Scarf, Abomasnow can serve as a decently fast wallbreaker; it is especially effective against hyper offensive teams, as they often struggle to have a reliable switch-in for Abomasnow's attacks. It does well against weather-based teams, as it can be brought in on a free switch or on a predicted move like Swords Dance on Pokemon such as Kabutops and Leafeon. By negating the weather, Abomasnow is able to outspeed them and pick up the KO. Its Speed also allows Abomasnow to serve as an overall decent revenge killer and cleaner. On top of being brought in after a teammate is KOed, it can also be brought in with the help of a slow pivot such as Eelektross or Lanturn. These methods are used to bring Abomasnow in because it is rather frail and needs to stay healthy to perform its role optimally. Your opponent can struggle to predict Abomasnow's item from Team Preview, so it can take advantage of this to lure in otherwise faster threats such as Simisear that would generally stay in against it or come in to revenge kill it. However, be wary that without an item that boosts its power, Abomasnow's damage output can be somewhat underwhelming at times, and it often requires foes to be weakened before it can KO them. Also be aware that once Abomasnow's Choice Scarf has been revealed, it becomes much easier for the opponent to play around.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Setup sweepers such as Oricorio-G and Alolan Raticate appreciate Abomasnow's ability to lure in and take out faster threats such as Dodrio. In return, these setup sweepers can weaken the opposing team before Abomasnow comes in to clean. Wallbreakers like Simisear are also good partners for this reason. Alolan Raticate can also support Abomasnow by using Knock Off on faster Choice Scarf users like Skuntank and Alolan Sandslash. Entry hazard setters such as Mudsdale and Golurk can help whittle down the opposing team, making it even easier for Abomasnow to clean. Eelektross is another good partner that can support Abomasnow with Knock Off and bring it in safely with a slow Volt Switch. While Abomasnow can serve as a decent revenge killer and cleaner, it is not the best way to keep faster foes in check, so teams may want a second Choice Scarf user to more reliably fulfill that role, such as Primeape. Due to its weakness to Stealth Rock and other hazards, Abomasnow appreciates having a form of hazard removal on its team, such as Skuntank or Silvally-Fairy.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Abomasnow's Attack stat, allowing it to more easily break through certain walls such as Clefairy and Eelektross. Wood Hammer serves as Abomasnow's main Grass-type STAB attack, hitting Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types such as Carracosta, Regirock, and Mudsdale, although using it comes at the cost of taking a good amount of recoil. Bloom Doom coming from Wood Hammer more easily breaks through bulky foes such as Gurdurr and Type: Null, and it also ignores the recoil of Wood Hammer. Seed Bomb is an alternate option over Wood Hammer when running a Life Orb because it does not deal additional recoil damage. Ice Shard is Abomasnow's best way to make up for its lackluster Speed; it hits Pokemon such as Dodrio and Oricorio-G and can be decently powerful when combined with a Swords Dance boost. Earthquake hits Steel-types such as Aggron and Probopass, which can otherwise take any attack except +2 Bloom Doom. It can also be used to hit faster Fire- and Steel-types such as Simisear and Alolan Sandslash on the switch. Blizzard is an alternative option that can serve as a decently powerful Ice-type STAB attack; in particular, it hits physically bulky Pokemon like Tangela and Lurantis that would otherwise wall Abomasnow. However, this leaves it much more vulnerable to Fire- and Steel-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in Attack and Speed allow Abomasnow to more easily sweep and break through walls. A Jolly or Hasty nature enables Abomasnow to outspeed Pokemon such as Timid Aurorus and Jolly Golurk. While a Jolly nature is run when using Earthquake, a Hasty nature is used alongside Blizzard to maximize its power. An Adamant or Lonely nature can be run to further raise Abomasnowâ€™s Attack, but this leaves it unable to outspeed the aforementioned Aurorus and Golurk. Grassium Z with Wood Hammer lets Abomasnow use a 190-Base Power Bloom Doom, which lacks the recoil of Wood Hammer and can break past walls like Type: Null. If the team has another Z-Move user, Abomasnow can instead run a Life Orb to boost its overall power. It is run along with Seed Bomb, as Wood Hammer's recoil would otherwise stack with the Life Orb's.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Abomasnow should take advantage of the Attack boost from Swords Dance to break through bulkier Pokemon such as Clefairy and Musharna so a teammate can come in to clean up. Through a combination of Swords Dance and Ice Shard, Abomasnow can also serve as a decent late-game cleaner, and it can also be used as a setup sweeper, ideally after threats such as Primeape and Stoutland have been KOed or at least put in range of Ice Shard. Abomasnow should set up against bulkier Pokemon that can do little to it, such as Claydol and Audino, although it should stay wary of moves such as Encore and Toxic. Abomasnow can also take advantage of its overall unpredictability to lure in certain Pokemon that can give its other sets trouble such as Clefairy and Type: Null, and it can scare away Pokemon that can deal with the Swords Dance set, such as Tangela. If running Blizzard, Abomasnow can further attempt to bluff its mixed wallbreaker set. Even without a Swords Dance boost, Abomasnow can still put a dent in the opponent's team due to the high Base Power of Wood Hammer and Blizzard, and it can serve as a decent revenge killer with Ice Shard. Abomasnow should be brought onto the field with the help of a slow pivot such as Eelektross or Lanturn, after a teammate has been KOed, or against a predicted non-damaging move such as Clefairy's Stealth Rock or Soft-Boiled.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fast Pokemon such as Alolan Persian appreciate Abomasnow's ability to weaken specially defensive walls that give them trouble such as Gastrodon and Audino, while they in return can help clean up weakened Pokemon and break down physical walls that can potentially stop Abomasnow from sweeping, such as Tangela and Sableye. Thunder Wave users such as Regirock and Clefairy can help cripple faster threats such as Primeape and Floatzel, allowing Abomasnow to outspeed them, but be aware that Abomasnow needs to run a positive Speed nature to outspeed a paralyzed Choice Scarf Primeape. Regirock and Clefairy can also help wear the opponent's team down with Stealth Rock and can serve as soft checks for Fire-types. Probopass stacks a weakness to Fighting-type attacks, but it can serve as a slow pivot and can trap Steel-types that give Abomasnow trouble, such as Alolan Sandslash. Due to Abomasnow's weakness to entry hazards, Pokemon that can provide hazard removal such as Skuntank and Silvally-Water are also appreciated.</p>"

  "Electivire": {
    "overview": "<p>Electivire is a mixed wallbreaker with great coverage options and a Speed tier that permits it to outspeed and revenge kill common slower wallbreakers like Omastar, Oricorio-G, and Aurorus. Since there are so many different possibilities in terms of sets and coverage moves, Electivire can be unpredictable, though many of its options aren't usually as viable. Despite its offensive prowess, its frailty and middling Speed make it susceptible to faster attackers such as Lycanroc, Choice Scarf users like Primeape and Dodrio, and priority moves such as Kangaskhan's Fake Out and Skuntank's Sucker Punch. Regardless of its impressive Attack, it struggles to break through physical walls, thus forcing it to rely on its weaker Special Attack in some cases. Since its Special Attack is nothing to write home about, it relies on super effective moves specifically designed to break its checks, thus failing to handle those neutral to its attacks such as Clefairy and defensive Spiritomb. It also faces harsh competition from fellow Electric-types, the most noteworthy being Eelektross, which totally eclipses Electivire besides having much lower Speed and lacking niche coverage moves like Earthquake. Other superior Electric-types include Rotom-F, which can break down Ground-types like Mudsdale with Blizzard and cripple other defensive switch-ins with Trick, and Alolan Raichu, which can break past specially defensive switch-ins like Clefairy with Psyshock, and can outpace base 95s that Electivire runs the risk of having to Speed tie with such as Primeape and Jynx.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Expert Belt is plausible due to Electivire's impressive coverage, giving it the ability to bluff a Choice item without causing any recoil, which can improve Electivire's longevity. In spite of this, it misses out on a lot of power for its neutral attacks that could make or break the KO, failing to 2HKO Hitmonchan with Earthquake as noted earlier. Choice Band turns Electivire into a dangerous physical wallbreaker, enabling it to break through certain walls such as Regirock and Musharna, but it sacrifices the ability to switch between moves, undermining its role and overall value. Moreover, Electivire is reliant on special coverage to hit Ferroseed and Tangela, and it isn't appealing to lock Electivire into any of its moves, as they either have sufficient Pokemon resistant to immune to them or are relatively weak. Choice Scarf Electivire can be a good offensive pivot with Volt Switch, but it compromises power and, once again, the ability to switch between coverage moves. It is also largely overshadowed by Rotom-F, which has much stronger BoltBeam coverage and access to Trick to cripple its counters. Fightinium Z with Focus Blast can KO Regirock after a little prior damage, but this sacrifices Electivire's overall power and is mediocre due to its one-time use. Similarly, Fightinium Z with Cross Chop can be used to lure specially defensive Audino, guaranteeing the OHKO after Stealth Rock damage with 40 Attack EVs and having an 80% chance to do so without investment. This also allows Electivire to break down Eelektross and Type: Null easier. Alas, it is very situational and surrenders the overall power boost from Life Orb. Z-Electric Terrain can boost Electivire's Speed by 1.5x and strengthen its Electric-type moves, but again it loses a valuable coverage move and requires a turn to set up, which is challenging due to Electivire's middling bulk. Wild Charge can 2HKO Clefairy but is otherwise an inconsistent STAB option that compounds recoil considerably if combined with Life Orb. Hidden Power Grass can 2HKO Ground-types like Golurk and Gastrodon but fails to do enough damage to others like Mudsdale and is otherwise a second-rate coverage move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Electivire is troubled by specially defensive walls neutral to its attacks such as Eelektross, Clefairy, Musharna, and Hitmonchan. Eelektross, thanks to its ability Levitate, is immune to Earthquake and can comfortably take Electivire's coverage moves, threatening to respond with Knock Off. Clefairy and Musharna will only get 3HKOed by any of Electivire's moves and can provide clerical support, set up with Calm Mind, or stall it out with their respective healing moves. However, Electivire can 2HKO Hitmonchan with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Torterra, Golurk, and Mudsdale are particularly threatening, as they can take any one move and will OHKO back with STAB Earthquake. In addition, Alolan Dugtrio can outspeed and OHKO with Earthquake but can only come in on a predicted Electric-type attack or free turn.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Lycanroc, Simisear, Floatzel, and Choice Scarf users such as Primeape can comfortably net the OHKO or 2HKO with their STAB attacks due to Electivire's subpar defenses. However, they must be wary of Electivire's strong attacks in return.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Because Electivire has a relatively low Defense stat, it is susceptible to STAB priority moves including Kangaskhan's Fake Out, Hitmonchan's Mach Punch, and Skuntank's Sucker Punch.</p>",

      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch allows Electivire to serve as an offensive pivot, switching out of bulkier foes such as Gurdurr and gaining momentum on the Pokemon it checks. Thunderbolt does noticeably more damage but fails to generate any sort of momentum. Flamethrower hits Grass-types like Tangela and Victreebel that resist Electivire's STAB move for super effective damage. Earthquake hits specially defensive tanks that would otherwise counter the set such as Lanturn and Probopass, 2HKOing the former and OHKOing the latter. It can OHKO Skuntank and 2HKO Hitmonchan with Earthquake after Stealth Rock, giving Electivire a slight niche over its nemesis Eelektross. Focus Blast will hit Normal-type tanks such as Audino and Type: Null for super effective damage, yet it is highly unreliable because of its bad accuracy. Alternatively, Ice Punch goes well with Electivire's STAB move, creating a variation of BoltBeam coverage that can hit the entire tier at least neutrally. It threatens offensive Ground-types like Golurk and can OHKO Altaria and offensive Torterra.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Naive nature is preferred over Hasty, as a Naive nature makes Electivire less vulnerable to priority moves like Mach Punch and Sucker Punch, and it doesn't decrease either of its attacking stats, permitting it to hit as hard as possible. Life Orb gives it a much-needed power boost to achieve certain KOs while still allowing it to switch between moves. With a Life Orb, Electivire can 2HKO Hitmonchan with Earthquake, OHKO Victreebel with Flamethrower, OHKO Aurorus with Earthquake, and 2HKO Audino with Focus Blast after Stealth Rock. Motor Drive makes Electivire immune to and enables it to benefit from Electric-type moves, giving it a +1 Speed boost and turning it into a much more imposing wallbreaker that can efficiently KO faster Pokemon like Floatzel. Vital Spirit is another viable option, as it prevents Electivire from being afflicted by sleep-inducing moves such as Jynx's Lovely Kiss and Tangela's Sleep Powder.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Electivire should primarily be used as a revenge killer and wallbreaker. It can quickly dispose of slower threats such as Skuntank and Aurorus after a bit of prior damage while using super effective moves to get past bulkier Pokemon like Lanturn. Given its tendency to be worn down easily by Life Orb recoil and entry hazard damage, Electivire should be used rather sparingly. Try to bring it in freely after a teammate has fainted or on a free switch-in from U-turn or Volt Switch, as its lackluster overall bulk inhibits its ability to switch into neutral attacks. Electivire can be an effective offensive pivot if it is running Volt Switch, as it can pivot out of unfavorable matchups against tanks like Musharna. Since Electivire has varied super effective coverage, it can often force the opponent to switch, which is an ideal opportunity to create offensive momentum. When brought into a Pokemon that it checks, try to predict by going for the appropriate coverage move that could possibly OHKO or 2HKO the switch-in. For instance, if the opponent plans to bring in Golurk to absorb an Electric-type attack, go for Ice Punch instead to put into KO range. If running Motor Drive, anticipate and come in on Volt Switch from pivots such as Lanturn and Eelektross, disrupting the momentum and simultaneously boosting Electivire's Speed. In contrast, Vital Spirit can be utilized to protect a fellow team member from a Sleep Powder from Tangela and Lovely Kiss from Jynx.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because of its ample coverage choices, Electivire compresses its role and fits well on teams that require a wallbreaker to pressure the slower Pokemon that Electivire punishes, such as Lanturn &amp; Oricorio-G. Stealth Rock greatly helps Electivire to net the OHKO on Pokemon that would normally be able to tank at least one hit. For example, after Stealth Rock damage, Electivire can guarantee the KO on Victreebel with Flamethrower and on Skuntank and Aurorus with Earthquake. Common setters include Torterra, Mudsdale, and Regirock, all of which enjoy Electivire's capacity to check offensive threats like Victreebel. Grass-types make great partners because of exceptional type synergy. Ludicolo and Lurantis can set up on or threaten the Ground-types that check Electivire including Torterra and Mudsdale. In return, Electivire can stomach a Supersonic Skystrike from Oricorio-G or Swanna and terrorize them with an Electric-type STAB move. Electivire appreciates the destructive potential of common physical wallbreakers like Kangaskhan and Stoutland. Strong physical attackers can deal with most special walls but are especially good at eliminating Electivire's counter and greatest enemy: Eelektross, as well as Clefairy since both can effectively wall Electivire. Other wallbreakers that benefit from Electivire's role as a pivot include Zangoose, Absol, and Oricorio-G, all of which can manage its counters. They in turn value Electivire's support to wear down bulkier Pokemon like Aggron and Lanturn. Entry hazard removal is necessary to preserve Electivire's health. Rapid Spin support is optimal, as it does not remove the user's hazards that Electivire so desperately needs to net KOs. On the other hand, since there are many more viable Defoggers in the tier such as Silvally-Fairy, Swanna, and Skuntank, Defog is a solid alternative. Electivire can create a VoltTurn core with Pokemon such as Scyther and Primeape to further pressure the opponent's team.</p>"

  "Probopass": {
    "overview": "<p>Access to Magnet Pull gives Probopass a slight niche in PU, as thanks to this ability, it can remove several bulky Steel-types from the match, such as Aggron, Metang, and Alolan Sandslash. 4x resistances to Normal and Flying are quite useful, as they allow Probopass to, for example, switch in on a Choice Band Stoutland locked into Return and an Oricorio-E's Hurricane. Probopass has a surprisingly customizable movepool, with very useful utility and coverage options such as Taunt to cripple slower walls, Earth Power for Steel-types, and Volt Switch for pivoting working very well with it. Defensively speaking, though, its 4x weaknesses to Fighting and Ground severely hamper its viability, as both types are very common in the metagame in the forms of Pokemon such as Golurk, Torterra, and Gurdurr. It also can be hit very hard by coverage moves of these types used by Pokemon that Probopass otherwise would check, such as Kangaskhan, Stoutland, and Aurorus. Probopass has no reliable recovery, making it prone to getting worn down fast against opposing teams. Even when fully invested, Probopass is often embarrassingly weak against a lot of neutral targets. However, its biggest issue is simply that trapping Steel-types is not an especially valuable niche in PU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic is an option to catch Gastrodon on the switch, which otherwise completely stops Probopass in its tracks. It can be used to cripple Pokemon such as Musharna as well, which is particularly useful because Synchronize cannot affect Probopass. However, Probopass's four-moveslot syndrome means that Toxic has a hard time being fit, as Probopass's moves are all very important to its success. A more defensive set with Sturdy is usable, but for the most part it's outclassed by Regirock, which has better offensive presence and a better typing. It also lacks Probopass's main niche as a trapper. Pain Split gives Probopass a form, albeit an unreliable one, of recovery. It fits more on bulkier sets, but such sets are less practical in general and as mentioned before Pain Split is a very unreliable way of recovery that can easily be played around.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Air Balloon can somewhat help Probopass's poor matchup against Ground-types, but Leftovers variants are easily KOed by strong Earthquakes from Pokemon such as Golurk, Mudsdale, and Torterra. In addition, it needs the right coverage move to deal a decent amount of damage to these Pokemon, which is somewhat hampered by Probopass's four-moveslot syndrome.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Probopass's 4x weakness to Fighting coupled with a lack of firepower against them leads to it being countered by the likes of Primeape, Gurdurr, and Hitmonchan, which can revenge kill it, set up on it, or easily remove its entry hazards, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Lanturn, Ludicolo, Jellicent, and Gastrodon can easily switch into Probopass and hit back with Scald or similar moves. Lanturn and Gastrodon are also immune to Volt Switch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flash Cannon is Probopass's STAB move of choice, allowing it to hit Pokemon such as Aurorus and Clefairy for super effective damage. Hidden Power Fire is used to target Steel-type Pokemon that Probopass traps, most notably Alolan Sandslash, but also others such as Ferroseed. Taunt allows Probopass to cripple slower, more passive Pokemon such as Type: Null and Musharna. Earth Power can alternatively be used in the last slot to hit Alolan Raichu and opposing Probopass super effectively. Volt Switch is an option that allows Probopass to pivot around a lot of its common checks. This is particularly useful when combined with Probopass's low base Speed. Power Gem is an alternative STAB move that targets Flying-types such as Oricorio-E and Fire-types such as Simisear, although it can't hit Rock-types such as Regirock super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>84 Speed EVs allow Probopass to outspeed uninvested base 50s and under such as Regirock. Magnet Pull is Probopass's main niche in the tier and as such is chosen for this set. It allows Probopass to trap Steel-types for the player's team, mainly the likes of Alolan Sandslash, Ferroseed, and Metang. Air Balloon allows Probopass to trap Choice Scarf Alolan Sandslash far more reliably, as well as slightly deterring Earthquake users such as Pinsir and walling Mudsdale without Rock Slide. However, Leftovers are a valid alternative if using Probopass in a more defensive capacity where longevity is preferred.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Probopass's main niche is trapping Steel-type Pokemon. Because of this, it's rather easy for the opponent to predict the switching of Probopass into their Steel-type and immediately switch out. Thus, finding the right opportunity to switch Probopass into other Steel-types is crucial to its success in a match. This can be done by either double switching or pivoting Probopass in using either Volt Switch or U-turn. Be cautious when playing against Pokemon known for having Ground or Fighting-type coverage, such as Earthquake Kangaskhan and Jump Kick Dodrio. Due to the threat of such coverage, it shouldn't be treated as a Normal- or Flying-type check for the team. Probopass is quite weak and one-dimensional, so after it successfully removes opposing Steel-types from the match and sets up Stealth Rock, it can often become dead weight or even setup fodder for Pokemon such as Ludicolo. It is highly recommended to avoid recklessly switching Probopass in. Volt Switch variants should pivot on checks, would-be or otherwise, to Probopass like defensive Carracosta and Gurdurr. They also should be wary of using the move when the opponent has a Ground-type still active. Use Taunt to shut down setup or recovery from Pokemon such as Calm Mind Oricorio-E and Type: Null.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that struggle with Steel-types will appreciate Probopass's ability to take them on reliably. These include Type: Null, Clefairy, and physically offensive variants of Skuntank. Probopass offers very handy resistances to both Flying and Psychic, and there are many Pokemon in PU vulnerable to either of these types. Examples of these include Qwilfish for more defensive builds and Primeape and Pinsir for more offensive ones. Volt Switch variants can be paired with powerful wallbreakers that are hard to get in such as Crabominable and Drampa due to the fact that Probopass's Volt Switch is slow and therefore very reliable in getting the aforementioned Pokemon in. Volt Switch variants also like being paired with other Volt Switch users such as Eelektross and Lanturn or U-turn users such as Primeape to form VoltTurn cores. Eelektross in particular also helps against the Water-types Probopass struggles with. Even without Volt Switch on Probopass, these Pokemon can also get Probopass in on opposing Steel-types more easily, due to the fact that they are checked by common Steel-types in PU such as Metang. A Fighting-type switch-in is useful, as Probopass hates taking on such Pokemon. Examples of this include Oricorio-E, Qwilfish, and Victreebel. Likewise, Pokemon that resist or are immune to Ground such as Tangela, Haunter, and Abomasnow help dodge moves like Earthquake. Probopass can also remove Pokemon such as Alolan Sandslash that these Pokemon don't do too well against. Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Hitmonchan can also be good partners for Probopass due to their ability to reliably beat a lot of specially defensive walls that Probopass has trouble with, mainly Audino and Type: Null. Water-type checks such as Victreebel and Shiftry can help due to Probopass struggling with Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Lanturn.</p>"

  "Dusknoir": {
    "overview": "<p>Dusknoir is a niche spinblocker with its main attribute being its high defensive stats allowing it to switch in and spinblock with less fear of being greatly weakened. However, this niche is limited by Dusknoir's poor HP stat and lack of reliable recovery. Dusknoir's movepool is also lacking, with a lack of physical Ghost-type moves leaving it heavy reliant on Earthquake to output damage. This, alongside Dusknoir's only average Attack stat, makes it somewhat passive even when holding a Choice Band. Golurk and Spiritomb both outclass Dusknoir offensively due to their secondary typings; Golurk has a powerful STAB Earthquake and Spiritomb has access to a STAB Sucker Punch and Pursuit, with their aforementioned typings also providing more defensive utility due to the additional resistances and immunities that come with them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Life Orb can be run over Choice Band so Dusknoir can switch between moves, but Dusknoir can't afford the recoil Life Orb comes with, and it misses the additional power from Choice Band. Sucker Punch is a slightly stronger alternative to Shadow Sneak, but it isn't a very good move to be locked into, especially against Pokemon like Lovely Kiss Jynx and Substitute Alolan Raichu, since it can give them free setup opportunities. It also notably can't be used alongside Frisk. Pursuit can trap foes that try to switch out on Dusknoir, specifically Pokemon like Kabutops locked into Rapid Spin. However, Dusknoir struggles to find space for it between its coverage moves. Dusknoir can run Shadow Punch to give it a slightly stronger STAB move, but this is weaker than Earthquake even after the STAB bonus and Dusknoir's coverage and utility options are preferable. A bulky set with Power-Up Punch can take advantage of Dusknoir's solid bulk in order to slowly set up, but Dusknoir prefers the immediate power. Furthermore, this set is outclassed by Power-Up Punch Kangaskhan, which has better Speed and offensive typing.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: If they can switch in safely, Dark-types like Skuntank, Shiftry, Alolan Raticate, and Absol can take advantage of Dusknoir, by trapping it with Pursuit or taking the opportunity to set up a Swords Dance as Dusknoir is forced out, without much fear of being revenge killed later on by Shadow Sneak. However, all of these Pokemon take heavy damage from Dusknoir's coverage moves, with Skuntank and Shiftry in particular fearing Earthquake and Ice Punch respectively. Sableye can switch into any of Dusknoir's attacks and cripple it with Will-O-Wisp, before recovering any lost HP. Alolan Persian is also notable as its Z-Crystal makes it immune to Trick and can easily use Dusknoir to gain momentum with Parting Shot or set up with Nasty Plot.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Pokemon like Tangela, Ferroseed, and Gurdurr can all switch into Dusknoir's attacks with ease, although they are greatly crippled by Trick. However, if they do manage to come in, they can cripple Dusknoir with Leech Seed, Toxic, or Knock Off. Gurdurr can also use Dusknoir as setup fodder for Bulk Up and Ferroseed can set up Stealth Rock or Spikes. Others like Regirock and Mudsdale can also switch into most attacks and use Dusknoir to set up Stealth Rock but take a respectable amount of damage from Dusknoir's coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types</strong>: Stoutland and Kangaskhan are immune to Shadow Sneak and do not mind Trick, so they can often switch in and hit Dusknoir with their Normal-type STAB moves thanks to Scrappy. Other Normal-types like Zangoose, Ursaring, and Dodrio may not be able to hit Dusknoir with their Normal-type STAB moves but have coverage or a secondary typing that allows them to hit it. They can also use Dusknoir as setup fodder while not having to worry about being revenge killed because of their immunity to Shadow Sneak. However, the first two are easily worn down and the latter is OHKOed by Ice Punch.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Dusknoir's lack of recovery, low Speed and limited set of resistances gives it an unfortunate vulnerability to many wallbreakers in the tier. Aggron and Drampa can both finish off Dusknoir from full health, though others like Aurorus and Victreebel require Dusknoir to be chipped into range beforehand. However, none of these Pokemon can reliably switch directly into Dusknoir due to its strong coverage options, and both Aurorus and Drampa are crippled by Trick.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake, despite not being a STAB move, is Dusknoir's strongest move. It is notably its best way to hit Skuntank and two of the most common Rapid Spin users in Alolan Sandslash and Kabutops. Shadow Sneak attempts to make up for Dusknoir's low Speed in order to pick up KOs on weakened or frail Pokemon such as Haunter and Jynx. Ice Punch hits Flying-types like Oricorio-E and Dodrio and Grass-types like Torterra and Victreebel. Trick lets Dusknoir cripple defensive Pokemon that would otherwise wall it such as Tangela and Ferroseed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>44 Speed EVs allow Dusknoir to outspeed uninvested base 50 Speed Pokemon like Regirock and Audino, notably allowing it to get off Trick on them before they can move.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dusknoir's main goal throughout the game is to switch into Rapid Spin users like Kabutops and Alolan Sandslash to keep hazards on the field. It can also switch into other moves it resists or is immune to such as Roselia's Sludge Bomb and Primeape's Close Combat. However, Dusknoir has to watch out for coverage like Kabutops's Knock Off and support moves like Alolan Sandslash's Toxic. Dusknoir also serves as a wallbreaker, although it's somewhat unreliable due to its passiveness at times. Because it is locked into a single move, using Dusknoir requires a lot of predicting switches. Especially watch out for Pokemon like Skuntank, which can Pursuit trap Dusknoir if you get the prediction wrong. Otherwise, Dusknoir can use Shadow Sneak to serve as a revenge killer to pick off foes like Jynx and Alolan Raichu or Trick to cripple a foe late-game when it is at low health.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Dusknoir's main role is being a spinblocker, it should be on a team with entry hazard setters like Qwilfish, Roselia, Regirock, and Mudsdale. Said hazards also help weaken foes down for Dusknoir. Setup sweepers such as Lycanroc and Absol also appreciate the hazards being kept on the field, and both benefit from Dusknoir's immunity to Fighting and ability to weaken bulky Pokemon for them. Absol can also use Knock Off to remove items like Tangela's Eviolite without Dusknoir having to give away its Choice Band with Trick. Primeape can also fit into this playstyle by deterring Defog users such as Skuntank and Cryogonal from removing hazards from the field thanks to its Defiant ability. Primeape and other Fighting-types like Gurdurr and Hitmonchan are also good teammates because they can help against Dark- and Normal-types like Alolan Raticate and Stoutland, which threaten Dusknoir. Hitmonchan can also remove hazards for Dusknoir, which prevents it from being as easily worn down.</p>"

  "Rotom-Frost": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom-F is a solid offensive threat by virtue of its decent stats, diverse utility movepool, and potent STAB combination that targets the majority of the tier neutrally or super effectively. Most notably, Rotom-F makes for an effective user of Defog, as it bears a fantastic matchup against common entry hazard setters such as Mudsdale and Qwilfish. Rotom-F's Speed tier is also of value, as it puts it above prominent Pokemon such as Stoutland and Skuntank, making it highly threatening against bulky offense teams without proper switch-ins. Rotom-F can also run a decent Choice Scarf set that can revenge kill a multitude of Pokemon while still utilizing its good selection of utility moves. Unfortunately, the Pokemon that do outspeed Rotom-F, such as Lycanroc, Primeape, and Simisear, are all considerable threats, as they possess super effective STAB moves against it. Additionally, while Levitate grants Rotom-F an immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, a weakness to Stealth Rock combined with its low HP and inconsistent forms of recovery harms its viability as a Defog user, limiting what it can come in on if Stealth Rock is up. Lastly, though Rotom-F can pivot out of most unfavorable matchups with Volt Switch, it struggles to break past most specially bulky Pokemon such as Type: Null, Clefairy, and Audino. Lanturn notably serves as a complete stop to Rotom-F due to its resistance to Blizzard and ability to punish Volt Switch with Volt Absorb.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Electrium Z is a viable alternative to Icium Z that turns Thunderbolt into Gigavolt Havoc, breaking through Pokemon like Aurorus and Alolan Sandslash with much more ease. Substitute can be used in conjunction with Pain Split to avoid status and pressure bulkier teams, as it allows Rotom-F to safely recover health off of the likes of Audino and Lanturn, but having to give up Defog takes away Rotom-F's major niche. Hidden Power Fighting targets Aurorus and Alolan Sandslash similarly to Electrium Z, but it has very few targets otherwise. Toxic cripples switch-ins such as Audino and Lanturn by putting them on a timer, but it provides little other use and is difficult to fit into sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Dedicated special walls like Audino, Lanturn, and Type: Null take pitiful amounts of damage from Rotom-F's attacks, though they must be cautious of Trick from the Choice Scarf set. Lanturn in particular acts as a hard counter to Rotom-F, since it possesses a resistance to Blizzard and an immunity to its Electric-type moves. Assault Vest Hitmonchan and Eelektross can't take repeated hits, and the former must be cautious of Will-O-Wisp, but they can soak up any one hit from full health and retaliate with Drain Punch and Flamethrower, respectively. Hitmonchan can remove entry hazards, while Eelektross can use Volt Switch to generate momentum in the event that Rotom-F is forced out. Calm Mind Clefairy can also use Rotom-F as setup fodder, though it doesn't like taking Subzero Slammer damage beforehand.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Rotom-F sets lacking Choice Scarf fail to outpace the likes of Primeape, Lycanroc, and Simisear, which can all obliterate it with their super effective STAB moves. The latter two can potentially use their respective setup moves if they manage to force Rotom-F out.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Due to Rotom-F's inconsistent forms of recovery, low HP, and weakness to Stealth Rock, it's prone to getting worn down when attempting to remove Stealth Rock with Defog.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt works as an alternative Electric-type STAB move that doesn't force Rotom-F to switch out and has increased damage output against the likes of Jellicent and Articuno. Will-O-Wisp cripples switch-ins to Rotom-F such as Assault Vest Crabominable and Hitmonchan by causing residual damage and severely weakening their attacks. Pain Split compensates for Rotom-F's lack of reliable recovery by healing off damage against switch-ins with high HP stats like Audino and Lanturn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Icium Z converts Blizzard into Subzero Slammer, dealing high damage to targets like Stoutland and Gurdurr while boasting perfect accuracy. Alternatively, Iapapa Berry acts as one-time health recovery outside of Pain Split when at low health and can be activated through Stealth Rock and residual damage. Note that sets using Iapapa Berry should run the 4 remaining EVs in HP to activate the item after three rounds of Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-F finds ample opportunities to revenge kill Pokemon like Jellicent and Oricorio-G or remove entry hazards throughout most of a match. Rotom-F can pivot into moves like Mudsdale's Earthquake, as well as into weaker entry hazard setters such as Qwilfish, in order to fire off a powerful attack or remove entry hazards upon a forced switch. Avoid reckless switching if Stealth Rock is on the field, as Rotom-F can easily by worn down by it despite its role as a Defogger. However, Iapapa Berry variants of Rotom-F can periodically switch into Stealth Rock in order to activate their item and heal themselves. Volt Switch should be used generously to pivot out of Pokemon that check Rotom-F like Audino and Clefairy, dealing a slight amount of damage and providing momentum, which gives Rotom-F's team the upper hand. Rotom-F's utility moves can be used effectively against Pokemon that may attempt to pivot into it; Assault Vest Crabominable and Hitmonchan are greatly crippled by Will-O-Wisp, whereas Rotom-F can gain health off of Pokemon like Lanturn and Audino through Pain Split. Icium Z is best utilized to severely weaken or even OHKO bulkier Pokemon that Blizzard misses out on, like Eelektross and Stoutland. It's also helpful in situations where Blizzard's poor accuracy can potentially jeopardize Rotom-F's ability to take out foes such as Golurk and Drampa.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom-F can form an excellent offensive core with physical wallbreakers and setup sweepers such as Stoutland, Choice Band Skuntank, and Lycanroc, as it highly appreciates their ability to break past Clefairy and Audino and can dispatch the likes of Mudsdale and Tangela in return. Stoutland and Skuntank are notably able to chip Lanturn with Pursuit. Gurdurr can also remove the items of Pokemon like Clefairy and Lanturn with Knock Off while being a reliable switch-in to threats to Rotom-F such as Lycanroc and Hitmonchan. Pokemon like Primeape and Scyther can be paired with Rotom-F to create a VoltTurn core, increasing the amount of momentum its team has, and they can be brought in more often due to Rotom-F's ability to remove entry hazards. Rotom-F can also break down Jellicent and Oricorio-E to support these Pokemon. Other Pokemon like Alolan Persian and Type: Null similarly operate as pivots, but they can more safely bring Rotom-F into play due to the former's stat reductions and the latter's low Speed. Alolan Persian's Z-Parting Shot can also bring Rotom-F up to full health, while Type: Null can lure in Pokemon for Rotom-F to take advantage of such as Carracosta and Oricorio-G. Although somewhat counterintuitive with Defog, entry hazard setters such as Qwilfish and Omastar are capable of wearing down bulky switch-ins to Rotom-F like Audino and Lanturn while putting Pokemon like Stoutland and Abomasnow in range of Subzero Slammer. Secondary entry hazard removers such as Hitmonchan and Kabutops appreciate Rotom-F's ability to break down Pokemon like Jellicent and Tangela while compensating for its inability to use Defog in the face of threats like Simisear and Lycanroc.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick is able to cripple specially defensive Pokemon such as Audino, Lanturn, and Type: Null that might switch in on Rotom-F when it doesn't require the added Speed provided by the item. Defog can let Rotom-F remove entry hazards in an emergency, though the option isn't very reliable, since Rotom-F is weak to Stealth Rock and would rather not be locked in a status move most of the time.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf allows Rotom-F to outspeed Pokemon like Oricorio-E, non-Choice Scarf Dodrio, and Silvally-Fairy, granting it its ability to check a big portion of the tier and function as a reliable revenge killer. A Timid nature allows Rotom-F to outspeed +2 Modest Omastar as well as other Choice Scarf users like Skuntank and Kabutops.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-F should try to function as a revenge killer and check to many Pokemon such as Oricorio-G, Kabutops, and Alolan Persian thanks to its unresisted coverage and formidable Speed. If the opposing team lacks a solid counter such as Lanturn or Audino, this set can be utilized early-game to soften up foes for a late-game cleaner. Rotom-F is even able to break through some less bulky specially defensive Pokemon such as Eelektross thanks to its high Special Attack and BoltBeam coverage. Since Rotom-F is able to threaten Ground-types such as Mudsdale and Golurk, predict well on when to use Blizzard and when to use Volt Switch; once you successfully predict a Ground-type switch-in by using Blizzard or those Pokemon have been removed by other teammates, Rotom-F will be able to use its Electric-type STAB moves freely. Bluffing a non-Choice Scarf set can turn Rotom-F into an even more threatening revenge killer late-game if the opposing team doesn't have a faster Choice Scarf user like Primeape or a priority user such as Gurdurr. Utilizing Trick whâ€‹en Rotom-F doesn't reâ€‹quire the added Speed is a valuable way of crippling expected switch-ins such as Lanturn, Assault Vest Crabominable, and Cryogonal.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting-type answers such as Oricorio-E, Victreebel, and Tangela are able to check or counter Pokemon such as Gurdurr and Choice Scarf Primeape, effectively threatening some of the most common revenge killers for Choice Scarf Rotom-F. In return, Rotom-F cripples their checks like Cryogonal and Lanturn with Trick. Other pivots such as Alolan Persian, Eelektross, and Primeape can form a VoltTurn core with Rotom-F to help maintain momentum and bring in offensive threats. Pokemon such as Stoutland, Lycanroc, and Kangaskhan are able to threaten slower special walls such as Audino and Lanturn, even being able to Pursuit trap them in the case of Stoutland. In return, Rotom-F is able to threaten physical walls such as Mudsdale and Tangela, as well as being able to bring these Pokemon in safely through Volt Switch. Entry hazard setters like Mudsdale and Qwilfish are able to support Rotom-F by effectively wearing dowâ€‹n Pokemon such as Eelektross and Crabominable with Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic. They're also able to counter or threaten Choice Scarf Primeape, while Rotom-F checks Pokemon such as Victreebel and Jellicent. Due to its Stealth Rock weakness, more reliable hazard removes such as Skuntank, Alolan Sandslash, and Silvally-Fairy are valuable partners for Rotom-F. Skuntank and Alolan Sandslash appreciate Rotom-F's ability to check Ground-types, while Silvally-Fairy is also able to create a VoltTurn core with Parting Shot and check Fighting-types such as Primeape and Gurdurr.â€‹</p>"

  "Rotom-Fan": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom-S has a niche because of its good defensive Electric / Flying typing, which gives it the ability to check common threats such as Oricorio-G, Gurdurr, Scyther, and Swanna. Its movepool, which includes moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Defog, gives it some more utility as a defensive Pokemon. Although it's one of the few relevant hazard removers that are immune to both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, its weakness to Stealth Rock and lack of reliable recovery hinder its ability to switch in, which interferes with its role as a Defogger. In addition, it's pressured by common hazard setters like Regirock and Focus Sash Omastar. Weaknesses to prevalent Rock- and Ice-type moves further undermine its ability to check standard Fighting-types like Primeape and Hitmonchan. Furthermore, Oricorio-E is another notable adversary; despite Oricorio-E's slightly lower bulk, Taunt is its main selling point over Rotom-S, permitting Oricorio-E to shut down defensive hazard setters such as Mudsdale â€“ something Rotom-S cannot do. On the offensive side, it is likewise overshadowed by Oricorio-E due to the latter's access to Hurricane, Roost, Taunt, Calm Mind, as well as Defog. As an offensive pivot, it is outclassed by Eelektross and Rotom-F, which have more coverage options that can be used to threaten counters. As a result of its numerous flaws, Rotom-S is often considered to be an unconventional Electric-type pick in general, but it finds a small place in the tier with its typing and defensive capability. It also faces competition from Lanturn, as Lanturn has an immunity to Electric-type moves and a resistance to Ice-type moves, greater special bulk, and access to Heal Bell. It should be kept in mind that having both Will-O-Wisp and Defog on the same moveset is Rotom-S's only niche over the previously mentioned Pokemon and is, for the most part, the only reason to use it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An alternate EV spread of 248 HP / 192 Def / 68 SpD permits Rotom-S to avoid the 2HKO from Primeape's Stone Edge and Hitmonchan's Ice Punch after Leftovers recovery. Rest + Chesto Berry is a possible recovery option, but it can only effectively be used once, subsequently forfeiting its item slot; since Rotom-S does not have the room for Sleep Talk, it is not suggested either, since a sleeping Rotom-S cannot serve its primary role of being a Defogger. Rocky Helmet is another option for an item but it is generally inferior to Leftovers or Iapapa Berry, which supplement Rotom-S's recovery. It can get a little chip damage on physical attackers like Kangaskhan but eliminates its recovery altogether unless Pain Split is used. Specially defensive Rotom-S can be used, but is largely outshined by Lanturn in this role. Choice Scarf is a possible but unrecommended set that is overshadowed by other Electric-types such as Rotom-F, which has a better STAB combination. An offensive Defog set can be utilized, but it is outclassed by Oricorio-E, which can use a much stronger Flying-type STAB move in Hurricane, has reliable recovery in Roost, and has higher Speed. Swanna is another Fighting-type check and Defogger that overshadows Rotom-S in speed and offensive prowess. Substitute + Pain Split is yet another option Rotom-S can run. Toxic and Thunder Wave can be run too, as they enable Rotom-S to cripple its checks. However, Substitute, Toxic, and/or Thunder Wave are usually less useful and would mean that Rotom-S would have to replace a much more valuable utility move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Lanturn is Rotom-S's greatest downfall. It not only prevents Rotom-S from pivoting, but it actually heals itself through Volt Absorb and takes advantage of Rotom-S's inability to deal significant damage to it. In general, offensive Electric-types take of advantage Rotom-S; examples include Rotom-F, Alolan Raichu, and Eelektross. The most Rotom-S can do is pivot against them as they come in.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Walls such as Clefairy and Audino can comfortably take all of Rotom-S's attacks and retaliate with Toxic or provide clerical support for their team. Clefairy can also spam Stealth Rock or set up with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Powerful Ice-type wallbreakers such as Abomasnow, Cryogonal, and Aurorus will obliterate all Rotom-S sets. On the other hand, Rotom-S can threaten the former with STAB Air Slash.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Regirock can use Toxic on Rotom-S and proceed to set up Stealth Rock in spite of Rotom-S's numerous attempts to remove them, stalling Rotom-S until it succumbs to poison. Faster Rock-types like Lycanroc and Kabutops will either OHKO or easily 2HKO Rotom-S.</p>",

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch is the preferred STAB Electric-type attack, as it enables Rotom-S to generate momentum for the team. Will-O-Wisp can be used to burn common physical attackers such as Golurk and Primeape, reducing the damage of their moves and neutralizing them. It can also be used to pressure Rotom-S's checks such as Mudsdale. Defog allows Rotom-S to remove any hazards. Thus, it expands Rotom-S's role as a defensive pivot. Though unreliable, Pain Split can heal Rotom-S while damaging the foe simultaneously. Because of Rotom-S's naturally low HP stat, this move can be fairly good. It can be used offensively as well, severely denting its counters and possibly even putting them in knockout range.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>48 Speed EVs allow Rotom-S to outspeed Jolly Aggron and maximum invested neutral-natured base 60s such as Abomasnow and Pawniard. Iapapa Berry gives Rotom-S a one-time heal of 50% of its maximum health, which will activate after Rotom-S switches into Stealth Rock three times. Alternatively, Leftovers is a passive form of recovery that lets Rotom-S avoid the 2HKO from Primeape's Stone Edge and Hitmonchan's Ice Punch but is otherwise negligible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-S should be brought in early-game, as it can cripple common entry hazard setters such as Regirock with Will-O-Wisp as well as clear any entry hazards with Defog. Its tendency to be worn down easily throughout the match signifies the need to remove entry hazards as soon as possible so it is healthy enough to check Gurdurr, Primeape, and Scyther. Later in the match, Rotom-S should be brought in on slower Pokemon such as Audino or on resisted Grass-, Fighting-, or Flying-type moves to eliminate any remaining entry hazards. This may include, but is not limited to, Choice-locked Primeape's Close Combat and Swanna's Hurricane. Being immune to the Toxic Spikes, Rotom-S should be brought in directly on Qwilfish to quickly remove the aforementioned hazard before a teammate can be afflicted by poison. Although it has a great Defense stat, Rotom-S's appalling HP stat prevents it from taking more powerful physical hits such as Stoutland's Return and Zangoose's Facade. Therefore, be sure to switch it in only on weak to moderate physical attacks. Since Electric-types like Alolan Raichu tend to wall Rotom-S's attacking moves, predict this by going for a status move or pivot out, unless the foe has Lightning Rod or Volt Absorb. After it inevitably gets worn down from repeated attacks, Rotom-S should go for Pain Split, as it will recover a lot of health, especially against Pokemon with high HP stats such as Skuntank and Audino. When facing faster Taunt users such as Qwilfish or Defiant users such as Primeape, instead of going for Defog, predict and respond with a STAB move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>In general, Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan are valuable teammates to Rotom-S because of their good type synergy with it. While Rotom-S can easily take a Supersonic Skystrike from Oricorio-G, Gurdurr and Primeape can deal with the common Ice-types that are the bane of Rotom-S's existence, with Primeape being able to form a solid VoltTurn core with Rotom-S. Other pivots like Silvally-Fairy can coincide with Rotom-S to gain momentum for the team. They also help with breaking specially defensive walls such as Lanturn. Clefairy and other specially defensive walls can take on the strong special attackers that would otherwise beat Rotom-S, like Drampa. Wish support from clerics such as Audino helps with Rotom's lackluster recovery. In return, Rotom-S can check the Fighting-types that threaten Audino, such as Hitmonchan, Primeape, and Gurdurr. Pokemon such as Aurorus, Jynx, and Omastar that can tear apart Rotom-S's checks and counters appreciate the removal of entry hazards and benefit greatly from Rotom-S's Defog. As such, Rotom-S would fit better on more balanced or offensive teams that value Defog support but can moreover harness its pivotal capabilities.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Servine's main niche is being a bulky Defog user that can take on most Stealth Rock users due to its Grass typing. Access to Contrary and Leaf Storm also allows it to boost its Special Attack while using a strong STAB move, and access to reliable recovery in Synthesis helps Servine stay around longer. A decent Speed tier also lets Servine outspeed base 80 Speed Pokemon like Stoutland and Shiftry. Servine's bulk is decent, but a mediocre defensive typing isn't anything to write home about, and as it relies on Eviolite, it is very susceptible to Knock Off and should be wary of Pokemon that commonly use it. A low Special Attack stat means that Servine won't be doing much damage until it gets a boost, meaning that bulky Pokemon like Assault Vest Hitmonchan and Cryogonal can take it on. Servine also lacks special coverage moves, leaving offensive sets limited to a Grass-type STAB attack and Hidden Power and forcing it to choose which Pokemon it wants to beat. Leaf Storm's low PP also limits how much Servine can break through a team. Furthermore, Servine faces competition as a Defog user from Pokemon like Skuntank and Shiftry, which have either a better typing or better utility. Its main competition is Lurantis, which can hit physically with Superpower, is stronger, bulkier, and can afford to run different items, meaning Servine's only real niche over Lurantis is its Speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Glare can be used as a form of Speed control, though Servine has a hard time justifying it over the utility of Defog and Synthesis, and choosing a support move over Hidden Power Ice leaves it walled or more threatened by many Pokemon. Aromatherapy can be used for team support but suffers the same problems as Glare in that it's hard to choose a move to give up. Hidden Power Fire can be used to immediately beat Ferroseed and Alolan Sandslash and pressure other Steel-types, though it leaves Servine more open to Dragon-types like Drampa. Alternatively, Hidden Power Rock can be used to hit both Flying- and Fire-types like Oricorio-E and Simisear super effectively, though doing so leaves Servine unable to hit Grass- and Dragon-types super effectively. Knock Off is an option to cripple Pokemon that may otherwise be a nuisance to Servine or its teammates such as Clefairy and Gurdurr. Taunt makes it even easier for Servine to beat most entry hazard setters, as it can prevent them from setting hazards up at all, but is again hard to fit. A SubSeed set can be used, though it is unable to touch Pokemon like Drampa that avoid Leech Seed, and is generally outclassed by Jumpluff. A specially defensive set with Mirror Coat can be used to take a hit from strong special attackers and surprise Pokemon like Haunter and Drampa but is situational at best.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types in general are a problem for Servine, as they check it and can normally beat it one-on-one. In particular, Simisear outspeeds Servine and is able to heavily damage or OHKO it with Fire Blast, and Turtonator can use it to easily set up.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Abomasnow, in addition to beating Servine with Blizzard, also sets up hail, which limits how much Servine can recover with Synthesis. Aurorus acts similarly but can only reliably beat Servine if it is at full HP and Servine doesn't have any boosts. Jynx is able to outspeed Servine and OHKO it with Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types like Oricorio-G and Dodrio give Servine a very tough time. Oricorio-G can safely come in almost always, and while Dodrio can't directly switch into Servine without taking a notable amount of damage, it is able to reliably OHKO Servine or use Swords Dance as Servine switches out.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon Resistant to or Immune to Grass</strong>: Skuntank and Haunter resist Leaf Storm and easily threaten Servine. Pokemon with Sap Sipper like Drampa and Bouffalant come in freely on Servine and leave it unable to damage them too much.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Pokemon like Stoutland and Alolan Raticate easily threaten Servine due to its mediocre bulk, though Servine does outspeed them and can beat them if it already has Contrary boosts.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm is Servine's strongest STAB move and raises its Special Attack by two stages when used thanks to Contrary. Defog allows Servine to function as a form of entry hazard control by removing Stealth Rock and Spikes from the field. Synthesis is a reliable form of recovery that lets Servine stick around longer to use Defog more or get offensive presence with Leaf Storm. Hidden Power Ice allows Servine to hit several Pokemon that resist or are immune to Leaf Storm such as Drampa, Altaria, and most Grass- and Flying-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite boosts Servine's bulk, allowing it to take hits better. Maximum HP EVs are used to increase its overall bulk to allow it to Defog throughout a game. Contrary is Servine's best ability, allowing it to spam Leaf Storm without drawbacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Servine should be brought in on defensively oriented Pokemon like Clefairy, Ferroseed, and Gastrodon and Defog away entry hazards that the former two can set up. It also can switch into and beat other common Stealth Rock setters like Regirock and Mudsdale, with its Grass-typing allowing it to check them. Servine can switch into some offensively oriented Pokemon, though only ones it has a type advantage against, as its bulk isn't too great. Servine is generally used more in a support role and shouldn't be solely relied on for an offensive sweep, though it can do this in a pinch. Servine should try and keep its HP as high as possible with Synthesis so it has more opportunities to come in and take care of hazards. Contrary also allows Servine to be a Defog and Sticky Web deterrent, as the boosts they give to Servine's evasion and Speed can be annoying for opposing teams. However, Servine is heavily pressured by many common offensive Pokemon like Skuntank, meaning that it may have to switch out immediately after clearing hazards with Defog.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that take large amounts of damage from Stealth Rock like Articuno and Oricorio-G appreciate Servine's role as a hazard remover. Lanturn is able to take advantage of Servine's ability to check Pokemon like Gastrodon and opposing Lanturn while taking care of Flying- and Fire-types like Oricorio-G, Swanna, and Simisear for Servine. As Servine's Grass-typing gives it many weaknesses, it should partner with Pokemon that can safely take strong hits from these types. Regirock can take Fire-, Flying-, and Poison-type attacks fairly well and appreciates Servine's ability to beat most bulky Water-types, while Metang can take Ice-type attacks from Aurorus and is supported by Servine's Ground-type resistance. Strong wallbreakers like Stoutland can wear down a team to a point where Servine can clean up late-game if a team's faster threats are removed. On the other hand, Servine's bulk also means that it struggles with strong breakers itself, so Pokemon that can take on breakers like Drampa and Stoutland also help Servine. Clefairy and the aforementioned Regirock are examples of good options here.</p>"

Stoutland and Kangaskhan also have Scrappy to hit opposing Ghost-type Pokemon with their Normal-type moves.

  "Stoutland": {
    "overview": "<p>Stoutland stands out as an amazing wallbreaker thanks to an excellent base 110 Attack and access to Scrappy, which allows Stoutland to more easily spam Return. Its decent bulk allows it to switch in on Pokemon such as defensive Jellicent and Roselia, which also allows it to take a hit from faster foes. Although it has a decent Speed for a wallbreaker, it's still not too hard to revenge kill or be outright outsped. It also has trouble with Fighting-, Steel-, and Rock-types and gets a lot of competition from other Normal-types such as Kangaskhan and Dodrio; however, Stoutland stands out from them due to its large damage output without fear of Double-Edge or Brave Bird recoil.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Crunch can be run over Pursuit in order to hit certain targets that can otherwise switch in on Return or Superpower, such as Bronzor and Metang, but they aren't very common, so it's a very situational move overall. Silk Scarf can be used if you wish to not be locked into a single move, and it also lures Pokemon in if the opponent thinks Stoutland is holding a Choice Band, but the lack of damage output for a wallbreaker is not worth it. Toxic can be used on lured walls such as Regirock and Carracosta, but Stoutland prefers the offensive pressure of its standard moveset, and Toxic is highly exploitable when Choice-locked. Stoutland run Sand Rush to be used as a sweeper on a Sand team, but Sand teams are overall very mediocre with the relevance of Hail and the only setter being Hippopotas.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Faster Fighting-types like Primeape can come in and easily OHKO Stoutland with Close Combat, while slower and bulkier Pokemon like Gurdurr can take a hit and KO in return with a combination of Drain Punch and Mach Punch.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Pokemon like Aggron and Bronzor take little damage from Return and can cripple Stoutland with Toxic, set up hazards, or just deal damage. Aggron despises switching into Superpower, while Bronzor must stay wary of Crunch or Pursuit if it tries to switch out. Defensive Mawile is notable, as it doesn't take super effective damage from any of Stoutland's attacks and has Intimidate to make Stoutland do even less damage.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Omastar, Regirock, and Carracosta can all switch in on Stoutland's Return with ease and set up Stealth Rock, use Stoutland as setup fodder, or just dish out some damage. Omastar can also potentially set up on Stoutland if it locks into any move besides Superpower. However, they lack reliable recovery, so they can be somewhat easily whittled down and do not like switching in on a Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Tangela can switch in on any of Stoutland's attacks with relative ease, heal itself back up, and cripple Stoutland with Sleep Powder or Knock Off. Mudsdale can switch in while healthy and dent Stoutland with Earthquake, but lacks reliable recovery and can be worn down over time.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Stoutland is not too difficult for Pokemon such as Dodrio and Kangaskhan to outspeed and revenge kill if it has taken a lot of damage beforehand. Furthermore, a good number of revenge killers such as Simisear and Jynx can carry super effective coverage in Focus Blast.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Superpower hits the majority of Pokemon that resist Return for super effective damage, such as Omastar, Regirock, and Aggron. Pursuit deals double damage to Pokemon that switch out, threatening Pokemon such as Musharna and Cryogonal. Facade enables Stoutland to deal massive damage even after being burned, also making the opponent think twice before using a status-inflicting move. It also allows it to better deal with Pokemon such as Jellicent and Sableye.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Scrappy allows Stoutland to hit Ghost-types that would otherwise freely switch in on its Return or Superpower. An Adamant nature maximizes Stoutland's damage, but a Jolly nature can be run to outspeed a few key threats, in particular Timid Victreebel, Adamant Kangaskhan, and Jolly Absol.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Since Stoutland is holding a Choice Band, it will be locked into using a single move unless it switches out, so be wary of that. You are mainly going to be spamming Return, as not only is it STAB-boosted, but it also neutrally hits a large amount of the tier. Stoutland does best as a wallbreaker when dealing with specially bulky walls such as Clefairy and Audino, and although physically bulky Pokemon such as Regirock and Gurdurr can give it trouble, it can usually wear them down over the match.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting-type checks like Jellicent and Silvally-Fairy can deal with Fighting-types such as Primeape and Gurdurr. Water-, Ground-, and Grass-types such as Lanturn, Mudsdale, and Victreebel can help against bulky Rock-type Pokemon like Regirock. Fire-types like Simisear can serve as answers to certain Pokemon that can switch in on Stoutland's moves, such as Tangela and defensive Mawile. Late-game sweepers such as Jynx, Nasty Plot Alolan Persian, and Alolan Raichu appreciate Stoutland's ability to break through walls that would otherwise prevent their sweep. Due to being locked into a single move, Stoutland will be switching in and out a lot, and many entry hazard setters also serve as switch-ins to Stoutland, so hazard removers such as Skuntank and Hitmonchan can be good.</p>"

  "Liepard": {
    "overview": "<p>Liepard is somewhat versatile and unpredictable thanks to its plethora of viable sets such as Choice Band, Nasty Plot, and weather support. As a result of these sets' offensive nature, Liepard fits mostly on offensively based teams that appreciate its good Speed tier and prowess. Liepard has access to Prankster, as well as useful offensive tools such as Pursuit, Sucker Punch, and Knock Off, allowing it to cripple teams. Despite these positives, Liepard has a notable flaw in the fact that its offensive stats are low even when boosted, so it struggles to break past bulky foes such as Mudsdale. Additionally, Liepard has mediocre bulk and is weak to common Fighting- and Fairy-type attacks. Without the proper coverage, it can struggle to retaliate against foes that use these moves. Lastly, Liepard is a prediction-reliant Pokemon, and being Choice-locked into Sucker Punch can be costly because it can give the opponent free turns to set up.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Life Orb set can be used over Choice Band if Liepard doesn't want to be Choice-locked, but it appreciates the extra power behind its coverage moves. Trick cripples bulky walls that try to switch in on Liepard such as Regirock and Audino. Taunt similarly enables Liepard to cripple passive Pokemon like Audino. Fairium Z can also be used as a tool to hit Fighting-types harder and lets Liepard switch into weaker Knock Offs easier. A bulkier EV spread for Weather sets can be used to slightly increase Liepard's longevity, but Liepard has inherently mediocre bulk, so it often isn't worth it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Hitmonchan can hit Liepard with super effective priority attacks, but have to be wary of Play Rough.</p> <p><strong>Faster and Stronger Pokemon</strong>: Due to Liepard's mediocre defensive stats, any Pokemon that is faster, stronger, and isn't weak to Sucker Punch can check it. Some examples of such threats include Lycanroc and Choice Scarf Primeape.</p> <p><strong>Weather Setters</strong>: Weather setters such as Abomasnow and Aurorus are able to disrupt Liepard's weather set by replacing the weather that Liepard sets for its teammates.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is Liepard's strongest STAB attack and has the utility of removing the foe's item. Pursuit is used to trap Pokemon such as Haunter and Choice Specs Jellicent. Play Rough gives solid coverage versus Fighting- and Dark-types such as Gurdurr, Poliwrath, and Sableye, which would otherwise wall Liepard. U-turn allows Liepard to pivot out on checks like Silvally-Fairy, which gives its team momentum. Sucker Punch is a powerful priority attack against Pokemon that can outspeed Liepard. Lastly, Copycat allows Liepard to revenge kill faster Pokemon such as Dodrio and Choice Scarf Primeape, but only if used with Prankster.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment with a Choice Band allows Liepard to be as powerful as possible. Maximum Speed investment with Jolly nature ensures that Liepard outspeeds base 105 Speed Pokemon such as Cryogonal. Black Glasses over Choice Band can work, since Liepard spams Knock Off most of the time. Prankster is to be used to give Copycat priority, but if running another move instead, Limber is preferred.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Band turns Liepard into a prediction-reliant Pokemon. Liepard should use Knock Off to remove foes' items early-game. However, be careful when using Dark-type moves against Psychic- and Ghost-types like Musharna and Jellicent because they sometimes carry Colbur Berry to weaken them; in Musharna's case, its potential Z-Crystal reduces Knock Off damage and its Z-Move can OHKO Liepard back. Bringing Liepard in on predicted Psychic-type attacks from Jynx or choice-locked Ghost-type attacks from Oricorio-G and Haunter is ideal for Pursuit trapping. Be wary when locking Liepard into Sucker Punch because setup sweepers like Carracosta can take advantage of it. Liepard should pivot out on its hard counters with U-turn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hitmonchan and Kabutops can clear entry hazards with Rapid Spin, while Liepard in return can Pursuit trap Ghost-type Pokemon such as Haunter for them. Entry hazard setters such as Mudsdale, Ferroseed, and Qwilfish are also good partners, as the residual damage they provide can weaken Liepard's switch-ins into range of Knock Off and synergizes well with U-turn. Qwilfish is especially notable because it covers Liepard's weakness to Fighting-, Bug-, and Fairy-type attacks. Pokemon with access to Volt Switch, such as Eelektross and Alolan Raichu, pair well with Liepard because they form VoltTurn cores.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dark Pulse is Liepard's strongest special STAB attack and has a chance to make the foe flinch. Encore is perfect for Liepard, since it gives Liepard a chance to set up freely once a foe is locked into a non-threatening move. Copycat allows Liepard to use Dark Pulse as a form of priority due to Prankster and beat faster foes such as Dodrio and Jynx.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Black Glasses is used to boost the power of Liepard's Dark Pulse. Alternatively, Leftovers gives Liepard passive recovery at the cost of significant power loss on a Pokemon that's already fairly weak.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Liepard should aim to lock foes into setup moves or harmless status moves using Encore. Liepard can then proceed to use Nasty Plot after locking a foe with Encore or against a Pokemon Liepard can threaten out. Copycat should be used after using Dark Pulse once, as it will allow Liepard to gain priority on its Dark Pulses. Due to this set being a mono-attacker, it should be preserved until late-game, when its checks are worn down or eliminated from the battle.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Silvally-Fairy and Musharna make good partners because they can remove Fighting-types and Liepard appreciates Healing Wish support from the latter. Pokemon that can switch into Fighting-, Bug- and Fairy-type attacks, such as Qwilfish also pair well with Liepard. Qwilfish can also set Toxic Spikes, which will hinder Liepard's checks further. Liepard appreciates residual damage on its foes due to its lack of power, so entry hazard users such as Qwilfish and Regirock work well with it. Alolan Raichu and Jynx make good partners for Liepard since they can threaten Fighting-types and can wear down Pokemon such as Skuntank and Eelektross that can take hits from Liepard otherwise.</p>"
      },
      "Weather": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is Liepard's best STAB attack and is helpful for removing items from Pokemon such as Assault Vest Hitmonchan and Crabominable, which both disrupt rain. Rain Dance summons rain for 8 turns with Damp Rock, while Sunny Day summons sun for 8 turns with Heat Rock. Encore can be used by Liepard to lock its foes into non-threatening moves, then take advantage of them by bringing in weather sweepers and attackers with U-turn. Thunder Wave is another option that can be used to slow down faster foes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Damp Rock and Heat Rock give 8 turns of weather to a team. Prankster gives priority to Sunny Day and Rain Dance, ensuring Liepard can set the weather quickly. Maximum Speed with a Jolly nature ensures that Liepard is faster than every other Prankster user. Maximum Attack investment gives Liepard some offensive presence and power behind a Knock Off.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Once Liepard sets the weather, it should exit battle as soon as possible in order to let its team take advantage of as many weather turns as possible. Liepard is less ideal as a lead for weather teams; Liepard should be preserved because it has great utility in setting up weather with priority, so your best bet is to send it in whenever the weather is needed or is about to expire. Liepard isn't bulky at all, so it will find most switch-ins once a teammate is KO'd or against certain passive Pokemon. Liepard's Dark typing allows it to be immune to Prankster moves such as Sableye's Will-O-Wisp, giving Liepard more openings to come in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Liepard should be paired with weather sweepers such as Kabutops and Ludicolo on rain teams or Victreebel and Leafeon on sun teams. Electric-types such as Alolan Raichu can be used on rain teams to take advantage of Thunder's perfect accuracy in the rain. Stealth Rock users, most notably Golem and Regirock, should be used for sun teams because they provide good role compression. Pokemon like Simisear should be paired with Sunny Day Liepard because they take advantage of their Fire-type attacks being boosted by the sun.</p>"

  "Simisage": {
    "overview": "<p>Simisage's main appeal is its diverse movepool that provides it with great coverage, allowing it to hit almost everything in the tier for super effective damage and helping it threaten typical Grass-type checks like Oricorio-G, Articuno, and Altaria. Simisage is a nuisance to switch into once it's able to get onto the field, as it has very few consistent defensive checks, and its solid Speed tier can also make it an immediately threatening Pokemon against offensive teams. Unfortunately, while Simisage is fast, it's hugely susceptible to Pokemon that outspeed it like Dodrio and Choice Scarf users like Skuntank, Primeape, and Abomasnow due to its poor bulk and exploitable typing. Given these attributes in addition to Life Orb recoil, Simisage can't risk switching in and relies on pivots in order for it to safely come in and deal damage. Simisage also faces competition from Abomasnow, a mixed attacker that offers utility with hail and has access to priority and a second STAB typing. It also competes with Victreebel and Ludicolo, two Grass-types that offer superior longevity while hitting harder.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Simisage can use Nasty Plot to become a devastating wallbreaker, but this role tends to be performed better by Simisear, since it bears a far more potent offensive typing and coverage options that better suit a specially offensive set. Choice Scarf can turn Simisage into a more dedicated revenge killer, notably letting it outspeed other Choice Scarf users like Primeape and Jynx, but using the item over Life Orb makes Simisage weaker and far more reliant on prediction to break teams effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority Attackers</strong>: While Simisage sits in a solid Speed tier, it fails to outspeed Pokemon such as Dodrio, Alolan Raichu, and Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Aurorus. Priority users such as Kangaskhan, Gurdurr, Abomasnow, and Hitmonchan can pick off a weakened Simisage, and Kangaskhan and Abomasnow are notable for having Fake Out and a super effective priority move, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Victreebel and Bellossom have to watch out for Gunk Shot, but they can annoy Simisage with Strength Sap and take the rest of its attacks decently well. Defensive Torterra and Tangela are also sturdy defensive answers against Simisage, but the latter could risk losing its Eviolite to end up being 2HKOed by Gunk Shot and Leaf Storm.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Metang, Bronzor, and Mawile are hard checks to Simisage due to their neutrality to Fighting-type moves, though Metang and Bronzor dislike Knock Off and Mawile takes heavy damage from Leaf Storm. Choice Scarf Alolan Sandslash can notably switch into a couple of Simisage's coverage moves, and it can then outspeed and OHKO it.</p>",

Rock Slide handles Oricorio-E, Articuno, and Altaria, which otherwise wall Simisage. Gunk Shot allows Simisage to threaten Clefairy as well as target Pokemon like Silvally-Fairy and Victreebel. Knock Off is an alternative, as it can cripple item-reliant Pokemon like Tangela and Metang.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Naive nature is preferred so that Simisage doesn't give up its Speed while still maintaining the best offensive presence possible. Overgrow powers up Leaf Storm when Simisage is at low health, allowing it to take advantage of its vulnerability to chip damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Simisage should enter the field through pivoting moves and double switches in order to maximize its poor longevity. Simisage is most effective early-game, since it struggles to last throughout the game, and its immediate wallbreaking potential can support the rest of its team as early as possible. It can notably threaten entry hazard setters like Regirock, Mudsdale, and Qwilfish. Simisage is also a solid revenge killer thanks to its remarkable Speed and coverage, so use it to pick off foes such as Swanna and Jynx lacking Choice Scarf. Prediction is important to maximize Simisage's offensive potential; however, Leaf Storm and Knock Off are solid moves to spam early on for the former's high power and the latter's ability to cripple nearly every switch-in to Simisage. Make sure Pokemon such as Oricorio-E and Victreebel are weakened before attempting to beat them one-on-one, as they can otherwise survive Simisage's coverage options and retaliate.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard setters such as Regirock, Mudsdale, and Qwilfish aid Simisage in wallbreaking and can bring Pokemon like Oricorio-E and Silvally-Fairy down to KO range of its coverage moves. These Pokemon are also good switch-ins to some of Simisage's revenge killers like Dodrio and Scyther. Pivots like Eelektross, Lanturn, and Primeape are effective ways to allow Simisage to enter play. Eelektross and Lanturn are slow pivots that can weaken Flying-types, while Primeape lures in Pokemon such as Mudsdale for Simisage to take advantage of. Primeape and other late-game cleaners such as Alolan Persian and Dodrio can perform their roles more effectively with Simisage's ability to remove some of their checks, including Silvally-Fairy and Regirock. Because of Simisage's susceptibility to chip damage, Pokemon like Cryogonal and Alolan Sandslash can make for solid teammates as entry hazard removers, and both of these examples check Ice-types that can revenge kill Simisage like Choice Scarf Aurorus and Rotom-F.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Simisear is a decent sweeper that differentiates itself with its rare access to Fire-type STAB moves and decent coverage, along with Nasty Plot and a solid Speed tier. It can utilize various Z-Moves to break through would-be checks such as Lanturn and Audino, which makes it more threatening and unpredictable. However, Simisear's paltry defenses and weakness to Stealth Rock leave it open to Choice Scarf users like Primeape, Aurorus, and Swanna, along with certain forms of priority like Kabutops's Aqua Jet and Skuntank's Sucker Punch. Its meager bulk also makes it more difficult to set up a Nasty Plot, which is necessary to patch up Simisear's low damage output so that it can threaten defensive switch-ins more easily. Combusken and Turtonator are other options that give Simisear competition as Fire-type breakers, with Combusken being capable of cleaning with Speed Boost, Turtonator being able to more easily set up with its bulk, and both wielding an additional STAB type.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Simisear can hold alternative items when running Nasty Plot and if the team has another Z-Move user, but the nuke Z-Moves grant is usually preferred. Life Orb is an option, as it still gives Simisear a notable increase in power, even unboosted, but it wears Simisear down faster along with entry hazards and priority. Salac Berry alongside Gluttony and Substitute can give Simisear the ability to clean or even sweep a game with the Speed boost as well as give it an option to work around Sucker Punch. However, this set remains vulnerable to priority and gives up a coverage move for Substitute, which is needed to reliably activate Salac Berry. An all-out attacking set with a spread of 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with a Naive nature and a moveset consisting of Fire Blast, Grass Knot, Superpower, and Knock Off can forego Nasty Plot setup in in favor of more coverage, with the biggest catch being Superpower, which is efficient at defeating Normal-types such as Audino, Drampa, and Stoutland while also hitting Lycanroc and Lanturn harder.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Despite Simisear's decent Speed tier, it is still prone to being revenge killed by Pokemon such as Lycanroc, Dodrio, Alolan Dugtrio, and most Choice Scarf users like Primeape and Kabutops, which are capable of outspeeding Simisear and knocking it out.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Certain specially defensive tanks or walls such as Hitmonchan, Lanturn, Type: Null, and Altaria can potentially wall Simisear if it lacks the proper Z-Crystal or coverage move.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Simisear holds a bothersome weakness to Stealth Rock, which chips it as it switches in and can put it in range of certain attacks such as Scyther's Aerial Ace more quickly. This makes it harder for Simisear to stick around or come into battle as well as limiting its setup opportunities.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Simisear's low bulk, Stealth Rock weakness, and lack of resistances leads to it being picked off by various priority attacks like Hitmonchan's Mach Punch and Kangaskhan's Fake Out without much issue.</p>",

Hidden Power Ice gives Simisear a reliable attack against Dragon-types such as Altaria and Silvally-Dragon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Firium Z powers up Fire Blast to enable Simisear to be more threatening without a boost and also gives it the ability to break down specially defensive walls or tanks such as Clefairy, Eelektross, and Hitmonchan. Grassium Z turns Grass Knot into a one-time powerful attack that lets Simisear OHKO Lanturn, Qwilfish, and defensive Poliwrath after a boost, which is something Grass Knot cannot accomplish on its own. However, Bloom Doom lacks Inferno Overdrive's raw power, so it leaves Simisear unable to break past the aforementioned specially defensive Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Utilize Simisear's solid Speed tier and coverage to threaten a Pokemon out such as Jynx or Oricorio-E, and attack or set up Nasty Plot. Only set up when Simisear can force a switch, as it can't afford to take a hit while setting up. Simisear is quite frail, especially considering its Stealth Rock weakness, so avoid switching it into any attacks, as most of them can either KO Simisear or weaken it to the point where it can't set up. Simisear can also throw out attacks before a boost to hit offensive checks such as Lycanroc or Floatzel that it lures in on the switch. Be conservative with its Z-Move, and don't make it obvious which one it's running, as the potential threat of either Z-Move allows Simisear to threaten out and break through more Pokemon. Simisear can wallbreak early- or mid-game to open up holes in the opposing team and possibly attempt to go for a sweep itself late-game once certain roadblocks such as Choice Scarf users have been dealt with by its teammates.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Simisear greatly appreciates pivots that can bring it in safely, so options like Lanturn and Eelektross pair nicely. Paralysis support from Thunder Wave users such as Qwilfish can cripple Pokemon that can usually revenge kill Simisear, such as Lycanroc and Dodrio, while Knock Off from Scyther and Dodrio can similarly slow down Choice Scarf users like Kabutops and Aurorus. Cleaners such as Kangaskhan, Pinsir, and Gurdurr can take advantage of bulkier walls like Mudsdale, Jellicent, and Musharna being broken down by Simisear. Pokemon like Poliwrath, Floatzel, and Mudsdale appreciate opposing Water-types being worn down, and in return they can check Lycanroc and Alolan Dugtrio. Simisear's weakness to Stealth Rock means that entry hazard removers like Skuntank and Alolan Sandslash make for good partners as well, with Simisear also being capable of breaking through certain Stealth Rock users they may struggle with, such as Regirock and Mudsdale.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Focus Blast is used to get past Normal-types like Audino and Type: Null and is also Simisear's best option against Lanturn, Pyukumuku, and Turtonator. Grass Knot targets Ground- and Water-types like Gastrodon and Jellicent. It also provides Simisear with a more reliable way of hitting Regirock. Overheat gives Simisear a powerful one-time nuke to get past Pokemon like Assault Vest Hitmonchan more easily. Flamethrower is an option for a more accurate but less powerful STAB move when the added power isn't needed or when Simisear is able to clean. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ice hits Altaria, which otherwise switches into Simisear without many issues, but it isn't very useful outside of that.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Blaze allows Simisear to 2HKO Audino with Fire Blast and makes its STAB moves considerably stronger when low on health. A Timid nature is chosen over a Modest nature to outspeed threats like Swanna, Oricorio-E, and non-Choice Scarf Primeape while allowing Simisear to better take advantage of Pokemon like Cryogonal.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to its mediocre bulk, Simisear should never be brought in directly but rather via U-turn or Volt Switch, to revenge kill, or on an aggressive double switch. If predicting a Pokemon like Regirock, Audino, or Jellicent to switch in, using the right coverage move makes it considerably easier for Simisear to spam its STAB moves later on. Be cautious of what you lock Simisear into and when to use Overheat; threats like Carracosta, Omastar, Oricorio-G, and Stoutland can take advantage of Simisear if it's locked into the wrong move or weakened due to Overheat's secondary effect. Therefore, if you don't have an answer to these threats, it shouldn't be locked into a move that could give them a setup opportunity. While this set's main goal is to act as a powerful wallbreaker early- to mid-game, its good Speed tier also allows it to revenge kill threats like Victreebel, Rotom-F, and Stoutland or clean the opponent's team late-game. If it's possible for Simisear to clean, it is very important to keep it healthy as to not put it in range of priority moves such as Skuntank's Sucker Punch and Gurdurr's Mach Punch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Simisear greatly appreciates U-turn and Volt Switch support from the likes of Primeape, Scyther, Eelektross, and Lanturn. Primeape and Swords Dance Scyther appreciate Simisear dealing with walls like Musharna and Regirock; in exchange, they deal with special walls like Type: Null. Eelektross and Lanturn are capable of pivoting into Pokemon that force a Choice-locked Simisear out, like Jellicent. Lanturn also brings in Ferroseed and Clefairy for Simisear to take advantage of. Entry hazards leave Simisear extremely vulnerable to being revenge killed by Pokemon like Alolan Raichu and Absol. Due to this, entry hazard removers such as Swanna and Lurantis are greatly appreciated. Swanna and Simisear can weaken shared answers like Lanturn for each other, while Lurantis deals with Audino, Carbink, and the aforementioned Lanturn and appreciates Simisear's ability to deal with Articuno. While Simisear does hit hard, it often misses out on potential OHKOs and 2HKOs. Therefore, entry hazard setters like Torterra, Ferroseed, Qwilfish, and Regirock make for amazing partners. All of them can switch into threats that force Simisear out like Lycanroc, Hitmonchan, and Kangaskhan, and Torterra also deals with Carbink and most special walls and appreciates Simisear getting rid of Tangela. Pokemon that can deal with threats like Lycanroc and Choice Scarf Primeape, such as Tangela and Mudsdale, are also very appreciated. Tangela can put Pokemon to sleep for Simisear to take advantage of, while Mudsdale can set Stealth Rock to ease Simisear's job. Finally, Stoutland and other physical wallbreakers such as Choice Band Absol are amazing partners, as they deal with special walls such as Lanturn and can trap them, making it way easier for Simisear to use its STAB moves. In return, Simisear deals with physical walls like Tangela.</p>"

  "Simipour": {
    "overview": "<p>Simipour carves itself a niche in PU by being a fast Water-type with immediate offensive pressure thanks to its high Speed, good Special Attack, ability to boost with Nasty Plot, and unresisted coverage in one moveset. However, Simipour is very frail, so it rarely gets the opportunity to set up. Additionally, Simipour may have a good Speed tier, but it is still prone to being revenge killed by faster threats such as Scyther, Lycanroc, and Alolan Raichu. Simipour faces stiff competition as a Nasty Plot sweeper from the likes of Alolan Raichu, Jynx, and Simisear. Alolan Raichu is faster, while Jynx's Substitute and Lovely Kiss give it more opportunities to set up. Simisear virtually does the same thing that Simipour does except it has a better matchup against Grass-types such as Victreebel, Bellossom, and Roselia, while the entire tier has a difficult time switching directly into it. However, Simipour is not weak to Stealth Rock and has a much easier time setting up against Pokemon like Regirock, Aggron, and Mudsdale on forced switches. Simipour also has to compete with its fellow Water-types such as Jellicent, Omastar, and Floatzel. Jellicent is immediately stronger, is bulkier, has access to Trick, has dual STAB, and can spinblock; Omastar is a better late-game sweeper with Shell Smash and can set up entry hazards; Floatzel is faster, has Aqua Jet, and can bluff a physical set.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Simipour can run Focus Blast with Fightinium Z on the main set to potentially lure in and dispatch of Pokemon such as Type: Null, Audino, and Abomasnow on the switch. Icium Z can also be used instead of Waterium Z to reliably deal with Grass-types such as Bellossom, Ludicolo, and Roselia. However, Waterium Z covers a much wider range of targets for neutral damage and bypasses Hydro Pump's low accuracy. Simipour can also run a mixed set with a Naive nature, Life Orb, a spread of 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe, and Hydro Pump / Ice Beam / Superpower / Knock Off so that it can potentially cripple defensive checks such as Clefairy and Type: Null with Knock Off. However, its Nasty Plot set is more efficient at wallbreaking and doesn't get worn down more quickly by Life Orb. A set utilizing Salac Berry, Gluttony, and Substitute can potentially work seeing as Substitute gives Simipour a safety net to set up Nasty Plot by letting it work around Sucker Punch and can potentially outspeed faster threats with Salac Berry activating. However, this set not only requires Simipour to give up a coverage move for Substitute and Waterium Z, but it also gives Simipour only one chance to sweep and is very hard to pull off successfully. Simipour can also run a Choice Specs or Choice Scarf set to grant it immediate power or Speed, but its Nasty Plot set is better at wallbreaking, and Simipour lacks a useful pivoting move like U-turn to make full use of Choice Scarf.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Simipour's Speed isn't bad by any means, but it is still prone to being outsped and revenge killed by Pokemon such as Dodrio, Lycanroc, Alolan Dugtrio, and especially Alolan Raichu thanks to Simipour's low bulk. Choice Scarf users such as Primeape, Swanna, and Kabutops also can threaten Simipour out of the battle.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: While it does resist Aqua Jet from Kabutops and Floatzel, Simipour still has to be cautious of other priority moves stopping its sweep because of its poor defenses, such as Sucker Punch from Skuntank, Kangaskhan, and Spiritomb, and Fake Out from Kangaskhan.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Certain defensive Pokemon such as Clefairy, Hitmonchan, and Type: Null can stomach a hit from any of Simipour's moves, heal the damage done, and potentially threaten it out of the match. However, Simipour can severely dent these Pokemon if it still has its Z-Move.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam is Simipour's best coverage move to nail Grass- and Dragon-types such as Bellossom and Altaria. Grass Knot gives Simipour an option to hit its fellow Water-types such as Jellicent and Gastrodon for a large amount of damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Waterium Z lets Simipour use Hydro Vortex, which can dent specially defensive Pokemon such as Clefairy, Articuno, and Eelektross at +2 while not having Hydro Pump's shaky accuracy.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Simipour can potentially wallbreak early- to mid-game to soften up its potential checks for itself and its team. Afterwards, if Simipour is still around and faster Pokemon have been removed from the battle, it can set up and sweep late-game. Because of its poor bulk, try to get Simipour into battle either with the help of a slow pivot such as Lanturn or Eelektross or after one of its teammates has been knocked out, as both of these options are safe and don't require Simipour to take a hit. Before setting up, make sure that any Pokemon that can potentially outspeed and revenge kill Simipour is properly taken care of. Simipour can safely set up with Nasty Plot by threatening out a slower, more passive Pokemon such as Regirock or Gastrodon with its powerful moves. Try to conserve Simipour's Z-Move for its intended target, ideally a specially defensive Pokemon such as Clefairy, Eelektross, or Assault Vest Hitmonchan. Hydro Vortex can also threaten Skuntank and Rotom-F in one-on-one situations where it cannot set up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Simipour loves the support of pivots. Fast ones such as Primeape, Scyther, and Swanna can threaten out foes such as Skuntank and Alolan Raichu for Simipour thanks to their power, while slow ones like Eelektross, Type: Null, and Lanturn can take a hit for Simipour and safely bring it into battle. Simipour can also dent Pokemon like Gastrodon and Regirock for these teammates as well. Alolan Persian can also be beneficial, as Parting Shot gives Simipour better opportunities to set up and sweep, and it can check fast offensive threats such as Dodrio and Alolan Raichu for Simipour. Whether it's from Knock Off users such as Eelektross, Shiftry, and Gurdurr to threaten Choice Scarf users, or Thunder Wave support from Clefairy, Simipour appreciates the speed control these Pokemon provide. Clefairy can also provide Stealth Rock to make Simipour's sweep easier. Knock Off users also help Simipour's sweep by removing items from bulkier Pokemon such as Type: Null, Eelektross, and Hitmonchan. Physical wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Kangaskhan can help Simipour break specially defensive Pokemon or even KO them like Type: Null, Eelektross, and Clefairy. In return, Simipour can help these Pokemon by getting rid of physically defensive Pokemon such as Regirock, Aggron, and Mudsdale. Entry hazard setters such as Regirock and Mudsdale make Simipour's time sweeping much easier. Simipour also appreciates partners such as Skuntank, Dodrio, and Oricorio-G that can help keep Grass-type Pokemon in check.</p>"

  "Musharna": {
    "overview": "<p>Musharna serves as one of the most reliable answers in PU to Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and non-Toxic Hitmonchan thanks to its typing, great bulk, and access to reliable recovery in Moonlight while also being a decent answer to Victreebel and Eelektross. Musharna is also the only viable user of Future Sight in PU, offering massive levels of wallbreaking support to its teammates by setting up situations where the opponent is unable to switch to their checks to Musharna's teammates without taking a huge amount of damage. Healing Wish also allows Musharna to greatly support its teammates by restoring a sweeper / wincon later in the match, allowing them to play more aggressively early-game, while also pairing well with Future Sight by potentially offering a teammate a free switch in to take advantage of it. Musharna can also viably run Calm Mind sets in order to serve as a late-game sweeper itself while still providing a strong answer to Fighting-types during the earlier stages of a match. Musharna can also forgo its defensive utility to act as a dangerous setup sweeper with a Calm Mind + Barrier set, allowing it to set up on strong physical attackers such as Stoutland, make itself harder to revenge kill, and prevent itself from being Toxic stalled via Rest. This set can also utilize Stored Power to act as a dangerous stallbreaker by breaking through Pyukumuku and more immediately threaten more offensive teams. Musharna is, however, held back by its low Speed, which usually forces it to take a hit before it is able to heal itself or attack, and the low PP of Moonlight, which limits the number of times it can switch in per battle, especially when entry hazards are present. Also, while Musharna's bulk is good, it falls short against targets such as Stoutland and Aggron. Musharna's typing gives it an unfortunate weakness to Dark-types such as Absol and Skuntank, which are capable of Pursuit trapping it and completely walling Stored Power versions of its Barrier set.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Musharna can run an offensive Trick Room set with Psychic, Dazzling Gleam and Moonlight while holding Psychium Z. This lets Musharna act as a solid wincon that can reliably set up late-game due to its good bulk while still allowing it to check threats such as Victreebel and Hitmonchan early- and mid-game due to its reliable recovery in Moonlight. An alternative EV spread of 128 HP / 192 SpA / 96 SpD / 92 Spe can be run on the Future Sight set if using a Colbur Berry, allowing Musharna to survive +2 Black Hole Eclipse from Alolan Persian, but this prevents Musharna from OHKOing Alolan Persian and lowers the chance to OHKO Absol with Dazzling Gleam. Psychic can be run over Future Sight to more immediately threaten Pokemon such as Victreebel and Qwilfish, but it lacks the breaking power that Future Sight offers when combined with other attacks. Hidden Power Fire can be run instead of Healing Wish on the Future Sight set to help break past Ferroseed and Alolan Sandslash, but the utility offered by Healing Wish is more valuable in general. Psyshock can be run on the Calm Mind set instead of Psychic, allowing Musharna to beat other Calm Mind users such as Clefairy and Oricorio-G while doing more damage to specially defensive Pokemon such as Audino. It does considerably less damage to Pokemon such as Mudsdale and Regirock, however, letting them Toxic stall Musharna more freely. Heal Bell can also be run on the Calm Mind set instead of Psychic, allowing Musharna to beat Pokemon that would otherwise beat it by Toxic stalling it, such as Audino and Metang, and allowing it to freely set up on Pokemon such as Mudsdale and Regirock. This, however, greatly reduces Musharna's offensive presence, making it unable to threaten Pokemon attempting to swap in such as Stoutland as much. Heal Bell can also be run with Normalium Z to allow Musharna to fully heal itself once while removing status at the same time and to more reliably heal itself under the effects of hail.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Absol and Skuntank are able to Pursuit trap all Musharna variants and threaten it with powerful Choice Band-boosted Dark-type moves. Alolan Persian and Swords Dance variants of Absol are also able to freely set up on Stored Power variants of Musharna's Barrier set, which cannot touch Dark-types, and Dazzling Gleam variants that are asleep, while also being able to survive an unboosted attack from Musharna's Calm Mind set if necessary and OHKO it at +2 after Stealth Rock damage at even if Musharna is holding a Colbur Berry. Skuntank in particular is very threatening to all Musharna sets, as it does not take super effective damage from Dazzling Gleam. Absol and Alolan Persian must watch out for Dazzling Gleam from the Future Sight set, however, especially if Musharna is running Colbur Berry, as the move is capable of OHKOing both after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-type Pokemon such as Oricorio-G and Choice Specs Jellicent are able to greatly pressure Musharna with their super effective STAB moves. Oricorio-G in particular is able to use Taunt on Musharna and set up on it with Calm Mind. Taunt variants of Jellicent are also capable of shutting down Musharna's Calm Mind sets, while Choice Specs Jellicent is capable of 2HKOing Musharna even after a Calm Mind boost. Haunter is also capable of revenge killing Musharna, but it struggles to come in directly due to its frailty and Psychic weakness. Furthermore, none of these Pokemon are capable of switching into the Future Sight set freely.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users such as Oricorio-E and Qwilfish are able to pressure Musharna by preventing it from recovering its HP or setting up with Calm Mind. Qwilfish has to be wary of Psychic-type STAB moves, however, although it can use Destiny Bond to force Musharna to KO itself if Musharna is already under the effects of Taunt, while Oricorio-E has to watch out for Shattered Psyche and must be mindful of using Toxic against Musharna due to Synchronize.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Bronzor and Audino are capable of walling non-Stored Power variants of Musharna, Toxic stalling it without fear of Synchronize due to their Steel typing or access to Heal Bell and Regenerator. Audino must, however, watch out for the combination of Future Sight and Shattered Psyche, which will KO it after Stealth Rock damage and has a respectable chance to KO it from full health. Also, due to the passivity of these Pokemon, Musharna's teammates can take advantage of Future Sight; either the move can force them out and potentially KO one of their teammates, or they are forced to stay in to absorb the Future Sight hit while taking considerable damage or using Protect in Audino's case, potentially offering a free setup opportunity to Musharna's teammates.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Due to Musharna potentially needing to switch into Pokemon such as Gurdurr and Hitmonchan multiple times throughout a match and the low PP of Moonlight, Musharna is especially vulnerable to residual damage from entry hazards and status, forcing it to regularly heal instead of attacking, and limiting its longevity. This is especially noticeable on the Future Sight set, which needs to regularly switch in and out to fully take advantage of Future Sight. Musharna also heavily suffers from the effects of hail, which reduces the amount of health recovered from Moonlight.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Future Sight": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Future Sight helps to overwhelm defensive checks to Musharna's teammates by combining with other attacks two turns later and generate momentum by forcing in Pokemon that resist it. Dazzling Gleam allows Musharna to hit Dark-type Pokemon such as Skuntank, Absol, and Alolan Persian, OHKOing the latter two, preventing them from easily Pursuit trapping Musharna or using it as setup bait. Healing Wish allows Musharna to sacrifice itself to fully restore a teammate and cure it of status, offering it another chance to sweep or break through the opposing team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>128 HP EVs allow Musharna to avoid a 2HKO from Gurdurr's Knock Off after damage from Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes, while 92 Speed EVs allow Musharna to outspeed Gurdurr. Maximum Special Attack ensures that Musharna hits as hard as possible, letting it OHKO Gurdurr with Future Sight and 2HKO Gurdurr with Dazzling Gleam. Psychium Z turns Future Sight into a powerful Shattered Psyche once per match, allowing Musharna to immediately threaten Pokemon such as Mudsdale, Eelektross, Lanturn, and Victreebel, as well as OHKOing Pokemon such as Carracosta and Omastar, preventing them from using Musharna as setup bait and swapping out before Future Sight hits them. It also allows Musharna to beat Audino, which would otherwise wall it, with Shattered Psyche followed by Future Sight. Colbur Berry is an alternative option if another Pokemon is holding a Z-Crystal, allowing Musharna to stay in against Alolan Persian and Choice Band Absol and remove them with Dazzling Gleam and offering a one-time damage reduction when switching out against Pursuit users such as Absol and Skuntank. Synchronize is the ability of choice, allowing Musharna to punish Pokemon such as Oricorio-E, Mudsdale, and Regirock for using Toxic against it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Musharna should aim to use Future Sight to help break down the opposing team by combining it with other attacks to overwhelm their Pokemon, due to it allowing two attacks to hit in a single turn. This can also help Musharna's team gain momentum from the opponent swapping to Psychic switch-ins such as Ferroseed and Skuntank in order to absorb the Future Sight hit. Due to its Psychic typing and decent physical bulk, Musharna acts as a strong Fighting-type check and should be brought in on Pokemon such as Hitmonchan and Gurdurr. It can also punish Primeape for locking into a move other than U-turn, but swapping Musharna into Primeape directly is risky due to said U-turn. As a Psychic-type, Musharna is weak to Pursuit trapping from Dark-type Pokemon such as Absol and Skuntank. If predicting the opponent to swap to Absol, it is often wiser to use Dazzling Gleam, as it will OHKO Absol; however, it is advisable to double switch if expecting Skuntank instead, as Dazzling Gleam does not 2HKO it. If Musharna is running a Colbur Berry, however, it can afford to stay in and can also beat Alolan Persian one-on-one. Musharna should prioritize staying healthy and conserving Moonlight PP in matchups where it is needed to check Pokemon such as Gurdurr due to it easily being worn down by chip damage from entry hazards and status.</p> <p>If running Psychium Z, Musharna should prioritize using Shattered Psyche against targets that would otherwise use it as setup bait such as Oricorio-E and Oricorio-G, as the move is capable of KOing them after Stealth Rock damage even if they have used Calm Mind. Other setup sweepers such as Carracosta and Turtonator are capable of using Shell Smash against Musharna, attacking once, and then either switching out before Future Sight hits or claiming a second KO and fainting, which Shattered Psyche can prevent. In matchups lacking these sort of Pokemon, or if Musharna's teammates adequately deal with them, Musharna can instead aim to use Shattered Psyche to remove Pokemon that might be problematic for its team such as Victreebel and Mudsdale. Musharna should avoid using Healing Wish until it is necessary in order to win the match by fully restoring a wincon such as Kangaskhan or Gurdurr. Healing Wish is particularly valuable when used directly after Future Sight, as it offers the recipient Pokemon a free switch in on the turn that Future Sight hits, granting valuable momentum for Musharna's team. If Musharna is no longer necessary, has run out of Moonlight PP, or cannot find opportunities to heal itself anymore, it can be brought in against status users such as Mudsdale and Regirock on a predicted use of Toxic to cripple them via Synchronize.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Musharna fits mainly on bulky offense teams, where it acts as a strong Fighting-type check and can help its teammates break through the opposing team thanks to Future Sight. Entry hazards have great synergy with Future Sight, punishing the enemy for switching in Psychic-resistant Pokemon such as Metang and Skuntank on the turn that Future Sight hits. Stealth Rock users such as Mudsdale and Regirock fit nicely, helping to deal with Skuntank, which is one of Musharna's best checks, although Mudsdale must watch out for Acid Spray variants. They also help to deal with strong physical attackers that can overwhelm Musharna such as Choice Band Dodrio and Stoutland. Spikes setters such as Qwilfish and Ferroseed appreciate Musharna's ability to switch in on Psychic- and Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon such as Claydol and Gurdurr. Musharna can also act as a Knock Off sponge for Ferroseed, which does not appreciate losing its Eviolite.</p> <p>Kangaskhan pairs well with Future Sight Musharna, as Fake Out allows it to make opposing Pokemon flinch on the turn Future Sight hits. Future Sight also helps to punish common switch-ins to Kangaskhan such as Mudsdale, which is KOed by the combination of Double-Edge and Future Sight after one layer of Spikes; Regirock, which is 2HKOed by Earthquake after taking damage from Future Sight; and Gurdurr. Kangaskhan also greatly appreciates Musharna's Healing Wish due to the recoil damage from Double-Edge. Fighting-types such as Primeape, Hitmonchan, and Gurdurr punish Dark-types such as Absol and Skuntank for swapping in to absorb the Future Sight hit. In return, Future Sight helps them break past physically bulky Pokemon such as Mudsdale and Tangela, Poison-types such as Qwilfish and Victreebel, and Flying-types such as Oricorio-E and Oricorio-G. Hitmonchan can also provide entry hazard removal via Rapid Spin, while Gurdurr greatly appreciates the Healing Wish support provided by Musharna, giving it a second chance to sweep. Physical Skuntank sets can Pursuit trap consistent Future Sight switch-ins such as Bronzor and Metang, Ghost-types that can threaten Musharna such as Haunter, offensive Jellicent, and Oricorio-G, opposing Musharna with Calm Mind that may attempt to set up against Musharna, and threats that try to avoid getting hit by Future Sight. Skuntank also appreciates Future Sight hitting its switch-ins such as Regirock and Mudsdale and Musharna's ability to pivot into Fighting-types such as Gurdurr. Cryogonal and Alolan Sandslash can also offer Rapid Spin support to Musharna's team and appreciate Musharna being able to swap into Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Hitmonchan. In return, Cryogonal can help beat Oricorio-E and Oricorio-G, which can freely set up on Musharna with Calm Mind if Musharna isn't running or has expended Psychium Z.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind allows Musharna to take advantage of its great bulk and good matchup versus Pokemon such as Gurdurr, Victreebel, and Cryogonal to set up and break through opposing teams. Dazzling Gleam allows Musharna to hit Dark-types such as Skuntank and Absol, which would otherwise wall and Pursuit trap it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Defense and HP investment with a Bold nature allows Musharna to take on physical attackers as well as possible, avoiding a 2HKO from Kangaskhan's Double-Edge and an OHKO from +2 Lycanroc's Splintered Stormshards. Fairium Z allows Musharna to use a more powerful Twinkle Tackle capable of OHKOing Absol, Sableye, and Alolan Persian without chip damage or Calm Mind boosts. It also allows Musharna to take less damage from Knock Off from Pokemon such as Gurdurr, prevents Pokemon such as Rotom-F from using Trick to cripple it with a Choice Scarf, and allows Musharna to deal with Skuntank better, having a chance to OHKO Skuntank at +1 after Stealth Rock damage. A Colbur Berry can be run instead if another Pokemon is using a Z-Crystal to allow +1 Musharna to survive +2 Black Hole Eclipse from Alolan Persian and Choice Band-boosted Knock Off from Absol while giving Musharna a one-time buffer against Pursuit users such as Absol and Skuntank. Synchronize allows Musharna to punish Pokemon such as Mudsdale and Claydol for using Toxic against it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Calm Mind Musharna will often struggle early-game to break teams featuring Pokemon such as Bronzor, Metang, and Clefairy, due to their ability to Toxic stall Musharna without repercussions from Synchronize; Clefairy can also use Calm Mind itself to PP stall Musharna. Early- and mid-game, Musharna should instead be used to check Pokemon such as Gurdurr and Hitmonchan for its teammates if necessary; however, it should be wary of switching in too often due to the low PP of Moonlight, especially when entry hazards are present. Musharna should avoid setting up on Pokemon that carry Toxic such as Mudsdale and Regirock if possible, as it will need multiple turns to break through such Pokemon due to its low initial power. However, Synchronize will poison them back, which Musharna's teammates can potentially take advantage of. Furthermore, if Musharna's team features a cleric, Musharna can more freely do this. Musharna should also avoid trying to set up in hail due to the reduced healing from Moonlight. Musharna should instead prioritize setting up on targets such as Cryogonal, non-Toxic Hitmonchan, and Primeape that have already locked into a move due to their low damage output versus Musharna. If defensive checks to Musharna such as Metang and Toxic Audino or offensive checks such as Stoutland are still present, however, it is wiser for Musharna to either double switch, heal itself with Moonlight, or directly attack on the switch.</p> <p>If Musharna is running Fairium Z, it should prioritize using Twinkle Tackle against Pokemon such as Absol and Skuntank, as these Pokemon can otherwise Pursuit trap Musharna or cripple it with Choice Band-boosted Dark-type moves. The Z-Move allows Musharna to OHKO Absol without a Calm Mind boost and have a decent chance to OHKO Skuntank after one Calm Mind boost. If Musharna is instead running a Colbur Berry, Musharna can use it as an opportunity to stay in against Absol, although against Skuntank, it is wiser to use the Berry to reduce the damage from potential Pursuit while switching out unless Skuntank has been significantly chipped, as +1 Dazzling Gleam only 3HKOes Skuntank.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Musharna fits mainly on balance teams that appreciate its ability to serve as a Fighting-type check, secondary answer to Pokemon such as Kangaskhan and Victreebel, and late-game wincon with Calm Mind. Entry hazard setters such as Regirock and Metang help check strong physical wallbreakers that Musharna can't deal with such as Dodrio and Stoutland, while Metang can also pressure Skuntank with Earthquake. Regirock can also help deal with Oricorio-E and Oricorio-G, which can use Calm Mind against Musharna and beat it if Musharna has spent some PP on its attacking moves earlier in the match. In return, Musharna is able to switch into and counter Gurdurr. Alolan Sandslash is able to provide entry hazard removal and help against hail teams, which Calm Mind Musharna struggles against due to its passivity and low Speed, its reduced healing from Moonlight during hail, and its inability to hit opposing Alolan Sandslash hard. In return, Musharna provides Alolan Sandslash with a strong Fighting-type answer, patching up the latter's weakness to Pokemon such as Gurdurr and Hitmonchan.</p> <p>Clerics make good partners for Musharna, as being poisoned can severely limit its effectiveness by putting it on a timer, and cleric support can allow it to potentially make use of Synchronize against multiple Pokemon in a single battle. Lurantis can help break through Pokemon such as Audino and Metang, which can Toxic stall Musharna while taking very little from any of Musharna's attacks. In return, Musharna helps Lurantis deal with Victreebel and Articuno. Lurantis can also provide entry hazard removal with Defog if the role compression is necessary. Lanturn is another option for a Heal Bell user that can help beat non-Taunt Oricorio-E and Oricorio-G while providing momentum for its team with Volt Switch, helping to bring Musharna in on Pokemon such as Hitmonchan. In return, Musharna can help deal with Pokemon such as Gurdurr, Kangaskhan, and Victreebel.</p> <p>Pokemon such as Gurdurr and Jellicent can help break through Steel-types such as Metang, Ferroseed, and Alolan Sandslash. In return, Musharna is able to check Victreebel and help break Sableye for Gurdurr. Strong wallbreakers such as Stoutland help break the opposing team and Musharna walls such as Audino early-game so that Musharna can act as a late-game wincon. In return, Musharna is able to swap into Pokemon that may attempt to revenge kill Stoutland such as Primeape and Kangaskhan, although it must watch out for U-turn from Primeape. Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Combusken can help to break the bulky Steel-types that Musharna struggles to break through like Ferroseed, Metang, and Bronzor. Gurdurr, in particular, can remove Eviolite from these Pokemon and hit the latter two super effectively with Knock Off while taking advantage of status such as Toxic poison due to Guts.</p>"

      "Calm Mind + Barrier": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dazzling Gleam offers Musharna a reliable attack that no Pokemon are immune to and OHKOes threatening Dark-types such as Absol and Alolan Persian after a Calm Mind boost. Stored Power is an option over Dazzling Gleam that allows Musharna to capitalize on its stat boosts to hit much harder and break through Pyukumuku and Calm Mind Clefairy, allowing it to serve as an effective stallbreaker against teams lacking Sableye. The move, however, leaves Musharna unable to harm Dark-type Pokemon such as Absol and Skuntank, which can Pursuit trap it or set up on it with Swords Dance.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers offers Musharna a form of passive recovery, making it harder to wear down, allowing it easier setup opportunities, and making it need to use Rest less often. Synchronize is Musharna's ability of choice, allowing it to punish Pokemon that attempt to use Toxic on it such as Regirock and Mudsdale.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Musharna is capable of setting up with Barrier against strong physical attackers such as Choice Band Stoutland and Dodrio and subsequently walling them. However, as Musharna will usually be forced to use Rest after doing this, it is better to try setting up on weaker Pokemon such as Hitmonchan or Pokemon such as Primeape and Stoutland Choice-locked into non-super effective moves in order to preserve HP. This is especially wise when strong special attackers such as Choice Specs Drampa and Aurorus are still present, as they will force Musharna out if it has not already used Calm Mind. Musharna should avoid attempting to set up on Pokemon capable of inflicting it with passive damage from Leech Seed, such as Ferroseed and Tangela, as this will make it harder for Musharna to set up and force it to use Rest more often than it would like. Musharna should also be wary of setting up on Knock Off users such as Gurdurr if the passive recovery from Leftovers will be necessary for it to set up further.</p> <p>As Musharna's only form of recovery is Rest, it should avoid taking unnecessary chip damage to make sure it can set up later in the match. Rest allows Musharna to break through bulkier teams reliant on Toxic stalling it with Pokemon such as Metang and Clefairy; however, you should be wary of the momentum loss created when it uses Rest, especially if it does not already have a significant number of boosts, as it will offer free turns for Pokemon such as Omastar and Zangoose to set up, break through it, and greatly threaten the rest of Musharna's team. Taunt users such as Oricorio-E, Jellicent, and Oricorio-G are capable of preventing Musharna from setting up or healing itself, and after they use Taunt, they can Toxic stall it, hit it with super effective coverage, or switch to a teammate that can break Musharna once it can't boost its defenses anymore. If Musharna has already boosted multiple times, however, it can greatly threaten them with Stored Power; therefore, it is vital that Musharna not reveal its set too early to prevent these Pokemon from immediately switching in to use Taunt on it. If Musharna is running Stored Power, it should avoid setting up when Dark-type Pokemon are present to prevent them from Pursuit trapping or setting up on it. If Musharna is running Dazzling Gleam instead, it should still be wary of Dark-type Pokemon, as it needs a Calm Mind boost to OHKO Pokemon such as Absol and Alolan Persian, while Choice Band Absol is capable of OHKOing Musharna with Knock Off if it hasn't used Barrier, and Alolan Persian is capable of OHKOing Musharna with +2 Black Hole Eclipse after it has used Calm Mind once. Musharna should therefore avoid setting up until these Pokemon have fainted or are in KO range of Dazzling Gleam, if possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Barrier Musharna fits on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate a solid late-game wincon with a strong matchup against offensive and defensive teams alike, due to its ability to quickly boost its defenses while being able to utilize Rest to prevent itself from being Toxic stalled. Teammates that can punish Pursuit trappers and other Dark-types are essential for Musharna, especially if it is running Stored Power. Bulkier setup sweepers such as Carracosta, Gurdurr, and Torterra can punish Pokemon such as Choice Band Absol and Skuntank for locking into Pursuit as well as set up on physical Defog Skuntank sets. If Musharna is running Dazzling Gleam, teammates that can deal with opposing Calm Mind users such as Oricorio-E, Oricorio-G, and Clefairy are essential, as these Calm Mind users wall it. Regirock is capable of beating the former two and setting Stealth Rock for Musharna's team, while offensive support Alolan Sandslash can beat Clefairy and Taunt versions of Oricorio-E and Oricorio-G, the latter two of which can beat Stored Power Musharna as well, and offer Rapid Spin support and assistance against hail teams. Strong physical wallbreakers such as Stoutland are capable of considerably weakening the opposing team so that Musharna has an easier time sweeping late-game.</p> <p>If Musharna is running Dazzling Gleam, other teammates that can break stall teams are helpful, as it will be unable to break through Pokemon such as Pyukumuku, Audino, and Articuno. Taunt Oricorio-E provides a Fighting-type check, which is a role Musharna can't perform well due to its lack of Moonlight, and can break through Pyukumuku. Substitute + Toxic Kangaskhan is another good option for a stallbreaker that can beat Audino, Articuno, and Carbink, although it cannot break through Pyukumuku due to Rest. Special setup sweepers such as Alolan Raichu and Turtonator can set up with Nasty Plot and Shell Smash faster than Musharna can with Calm Mind, allowing them to break through it; strong revenge killing options such as Choice Scarf Primeape and Dodrio therefore make for valuable teammates, preventing these Pokemon from sweeping the rest of Musharna's team after using it as setup fodder. Primeape can also bring Musharna in via U-turn on Pokemon such as Mudsdale, giving it opportunities to set up. Due to Musharna being shut down by Taunt users such as Qwilfish and Jellicent, Pokemon that can beat them such as Freeze-Dry Cryogonal also make for valuable partners, although Cryogonal must watch out for physical variants of Qwilfish. Cryogonal can also offer Defog or Rapid Spin support, allowing Musharna to set up more easily, while being able to beat Calm Mind variants of Oricorio-G and Oricorio-E that also annoy Musharna if running Frost Breath. Clerics such as Lanturn can allow Musharna to use Rest for emergency recovery more freely. Lanturn can also help Musharna against Oricorio-G and non-Taunt versions of Oricorio-E while being able to pivot Musharna in on Pokemon such as Clefairy and Audino.</p>"

  "Unfezant": {
    "overview": "<p>Unfezant may seem good on paper, boasting a solid Attack stat, decent Speed, and Super Luck, but that's where the positives end. Unfezant's lack of a good movepool makes it outclassed terribly by other Flying- and Normal-types like Dodrio and Kangaskhan, since they actually get access to strong STAB moves whereas Unfezant is stuck with worse options, especially 60-Base Power Flying moves like Pluck and Aerial Ace. Unfezant's Speed tier is good, but it is still outsped by common Choice Scarf users and offensive Pokemon such as Primeape and Lycanroc, which can easily dispose of it. Finally, Unfezant is often forced to run a support set that relies on the 60% Hypnosis due to its limited movepool. It's very unreliable in the metagame because of this and has no reason to be used over good offensive Flying-types such as Dodrio and Oricorio-G that possess a better matchup against bulky Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon like Regirock and Aggron.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tailwind Support": {
        "description": "<p>This set attempts to use Tailwind to outspeed opposing Pokemon and remove them from the battle, using Unfezant's niche of getting critical hits with Super Luck. Using Hypnosis and Tailwind allows Unfezant's teammates to get in safely and proceed to sweep. However, there isn't much going for this set because it relies too much on being able to land Hypnosis and gives setup opportunities to the plethora of good sweepers in the tier, like Lycanroc. As a support Pokemon, there is no reason to use Unfezant over Alolan Persian, which has access to Parting Shot, has a greater Speed tier, and gives a lot of defensive utility. Having a Stealth Rock weakness also hinders Unfezant's role as a support Pokemon, so without entry hazard removal, Unfezant has a very hard time pivoting with U-turn and setting up Tailwind multiple times over the game. This Pokemon takes up a teamslot that could be used by Dodrio, which is faster and has access to Swords Dance to break past its checks.</p>"

  "Zebstrika": {
    "overview": "<p>Zebstrika's only niche among Electric-types is its amazing Speed tier, which allows it to outspeed almost all of the unboosted metagame, including threats like Floatzel and Alolan Persian, and serve as a revenge killer and late-game cleaner. Sadly, Zebstrikaâ€™s Special Attack is very underwhelming even with a Life Orb, and it often can be easily countered by common threats such as Lanturn and Mudsdale, which also stop its Volt Switch. Due in part to its mediocre bulk, Zebstrika can be easily chipped through priority, hazards, and its own Life Orb recoil, making it fear Choice Scarf and priority users. Despite access to decent abilities such as Lightning Rod and Sap Sipper, its subpar bulk renders it unable to switch into offensive Grass- and Electric-types like Victreebel and Alolan Raichu. Lastly, it still gets competition from other Electric-types that can provide more offensive pressure. Alolan Raichu is stronger and sports a much better movepool, and Rotom-F can cripple its counters with Trick. All of these factors combined make Zebstrika an extremely poor choice in the PU metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs can be used to further increase Zebstrikaâ€™s power, but Zebstrika often depends on switching between its coverage moves, so it does not appreciate being locked into one move. Magnet boosts Zebstrikaâ€™s Electric-type attacks without inflicting chip damage, but it leaves the rest of Zebstrika's moves much weaker. Breakneck Blitz coming from Hyper Beam nukes many Ground-types that Zebstrika has trouble with, but, again, Zebstrika's other attacks are noticeably weaker without the Life Orb boost. Me First can be used to allow Zebstrika to use moves before the opponent can such as Drampaâ€™s Draco Meteor, but it is extremely situational and otherwise useless. Toxic allows Zebstrika to lure and cripple walls such as Mudsdale and non-Heal Bell Lanturn, but it leaves Zebstrika with much less offensive pressure in its coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Zebstrika is easily walled by many specially defensive Pokemon such as Eelektross, Audino, and Clefairy, all of which can whittle it down in return. Lanturn is especially good at this due to having an Electric immunity, taking little from Zebstrikaâ€™s Hidden Power Grass, and providing offensive pressure.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Golurk and Mudsdale are immune to Zebstrikaâ€™s STAB attacks and can OHKO it in return with their STAB Ground-type moves. However, certain Ground-types such as Gastrodon and Torterra fear switching in on Zebstrikaâ€™s coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that outspeed Zebstrika such as Choice Scarf Primeape can easily revenge kill it due to its mediocre bulk. Similarly, priority users such as Skuntank, Gurdurr, and Kangaskhan can also threaten Zebstrika.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Throughout the game, Zebstrika can be easily whittled down, making it much easier to revenge kill. Sources of chip damage include Life Orb recoil, entry hazards such as Mudsdaleâ€™s Stealth Rock, Qwilfish's Spikes and Stealth Rock, and status conditions such as burns from Sableye and Toxic poison from Regirock.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Overheat hits Grass-types such as Victreebel, Lurantis, and Abomasnow. Hidden Power Grass allows Zebstrika to chip Lanturn and Ground-types that can switch in on its Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, such as Mudsdale. Hidden Power Ice is another option that supplies coverage for most Ground-types and also hits Dragon-types such as Drampa, but it loses out on 2HKOing certain Ground-types such as Gastrodon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sap Sipper is the preferred ability, as it makes Zebstrika immune to Tangela and Ferroseedâ€™s Leech Seed and Victreebel's Strength Sap. Lightning Rod can be used if the team has no other way of stopping Volt Switch users like Choice Scarf Rotom-F, however it can't reliably switch into the former as it risks getting OHKOed by Blizzard after Stealth Rock damage, and it fails to threaten bulky Electric-types like Eelektross and Lanturn even after a Special Attack boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Zebstrika is most effective when brought in against a weakened foe to finish it off, and it can also be used as a late-game cleaner thanks to its high Speed. The best way to bring Zebstrika onto the field is with a slow pivot or after a teammate has been KOed, since it usually doesn't want to be brought out to take a hit due to its noticeable frailty. However, Zebstrika can be brought into Grass- or Electric-type Pokemon depending on its ability. This includes Pokemon such as Lurantis if Zebstrika is using Sap Sipper and Pokemon such as Oricorio-E and Lanturn if Zebstrika is using Lightning Rod. Volt Switch can be used to gain momentum and avoid mind games. It can also be used to simply get Zebstrika off the field to bring in a wallbreaker or setup sweeper safely. However, if Volt Switch seems to be the obvious play, be wary of opposing Pokemon that are immune to Volt Switch. If the opponent has one of these Pokemon, it is best to just switch out or use one of Zebstrika's coverage moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Zebstrika works well on offensive teams lacking fast Pokemon. It appreciates wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Kangaskhan that weaken foes such as Drampa and Silvally-Dragon and put them in range for Zebstrika to revenge kill them. They also take out the specially defensive Pokemon that otherwise wall Zebstrika, such as Clefairy and Audino. Water-types such as Floatzel and Poliwrath can check the Ground-types that often give Zebstrika trouble, such as Golurk. In return, Zebstrika serves as a Grass-type switch-in thanks to its Sap Sipper ability. Grass-types such as Victreebel and Lurantis and Ice-types such as Jynx can also deal with Ground-types. Furthermore, Grass-types have a good matchup against Lanturn, and Ice-types can handle Dragon-types. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Qwilfish and Regirock is useful for wearing opposing Pokemon down before Zebstrika comes in to KO. Slow pivots such as Eelektross are able to take a hit before getting Zebstrika onto the field without having to sacrifice a teammate, and they also form a VoltTurn core. Hazard removal from Pokemon such as Skuntank and Hitmonchan allows Zebstrika to more frequently switch in and out without having to worry about taking the extra chip damage. Swanna is another great option due to being able to Defog and check Ground-types while Lightning Rod Zebstrika checks Electric-types for Swanna.</p>"

  "Swoobat": {
    "overview": "<p>Swoobat has two unique niches in its ability Simple and its blistering high Speed stat. With the capability to boost quickly, Swoobat's Special Attack skyrockets to absurd levels even after just one Calm Mind. Swoobat doesn't mind taking chip damage as much as other Pokemon, since it will be purposefully reducing its own health with Substitute, although the inability to use Substitute at low HP can be annoying. Not everything is that simple, however, as these niches come at the cost of being very predictable. Due to its extreme frailty, Swoobat will generally be KOed in one hit. It needs immense team support, like dual screens or Memento, to function properly. Swoobat's frailty also means that it is vulnerable to priority attacks such as Skuntank's Sucker Punch. Furthermore, Swoobat's dual typing overlaps weaknesses with several top-tier threats such as Torterra, Aurorus, and Jellicent. This, combined with its frailty and need for team support, makes it somewhat difficult to add while teambuilding. Swoobat is also over-reliant on setting up with Calm Mind, as otherwise it's left with a 20-Base Power Stored Power.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Roost sustains Swoobat's longevity, but it needs Calm Mind to make use of Simple, needs Substitute to activate Salac Berry reliably, and cannot function well with a mono-attacking set. Heat Wave can be used over Air Slash to hit opposing Steel-types, but Aggron is not even 2HKOed after Stealth Rock and Choice Scarf Alolan Sandslash outspeeds and OHKOes Swoobat prior to a Salac Berry boost. A Grassy or Electric Seed can be used to boost Swoobat's Defense stat, but it requires an overwhelming level of team support and lacks the Speed necessary to deal with opposing Choice Scarf users. Good teammates for Swoobat utilizing these items include Alolan Raichu and Jumpluff. A Kee Berry can boost Swoobat's Defense stat by two stages as well but requires Swoobat to be able to take a physical hit first. Signal Beam can be used over Air Slash to hit opposing Psychic-types such as Musharna while hitting Dark-types for super effective damage and still hitting Shiftry super effectively, but its lack of STAB makes it damage less than Air Slash against Skuntank and Spiritomb. Air Slash is also able to beat most Psychic-types one-on-one, as Swoobat can use Calm Mind to out-boost Musharna and Claydol is unable to threaten it back. Giga Drain restores Swoobat's health while dealing super effective damage to Rock-types such as Regirock, Carracosta, and Omastar but doesn't do much outside of that. Swoobat has a plethora of support options such as Tailwind, Defog, Knock Off, Super Fang, Trick, Taunt, Reflect, Light Screen, and U-turn, but they all detract from Swoobat's primary niche of its ability Simple, and its poor bulk prevents it from pulling off defensive sets. Swoobat also has another rare ability in Unaware, although it cannot make any use of it due to pitiful defensive stats.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Swoobat is vulnerable to almost all forms of priority if it isn't behind a Substitute due to its poor defensive stats and typing. Swoobat is threatened by Sucker Punch, Fake Out, and Accelerock from Pokemon such as Skuntank, Kangaskhan, and Lycanroc, since it is weak to these moves or will be guaranteed to flinch. Furthermore, Swoobat can't play around Spiritomb's Sucker Punch with Substitute due to Infiltrator.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Prior to the activation of its Salac Berry, Choice Scarf users, such as Primeape, Kabutops, and Alolan Sandslash, and Pokemon at the base 115 Speed tier, such as Alolan Persian and Floatzel, are able to outspeed Swoobat and take it out with their strong super effective moves.</p> <p><strong>Sound-based Moves</strong>: Certain moves such as Drampa's Hyper Voice and Aurorus's Refrigerate-boosted Hyper Voice can all bypass Swoobat's Substitute and eliminate it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute shields Swoobat from status, allows it to more safely set up with Calm Mind, and lets it lower its own health to increase the likelihood that the Salac Berry will activate. Stored Power after a boost can turn into an enormously strong 100-, 180-, or even 260-Base Power STAB move. Without a boost, however, Swoobat is left with an unreliable 20-Base Power attacking move. Psychic is more consistent in damage output, over four times stronger before a boost, and just slightly weaker after one Calm Mind. Air Slash is a STAB attack that hits Dark-types for neutral damage while also beating Musharna as Swoobat out-boosts it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Simple doubles Swoobat's stat changes, essentially raising two stages for every Calm Mind. Swoobat's Salac Berry Speed boost also is under the effect of Simple and allows Swoobat to outpace all Choice Scarf users after it activates. Unlike many other Rock-weak Pokemon, Swoobat needs 4 HP EVs to activate its Salac Berry after Stealth Rock damage and two uses of Substitute. However, using 4 HP EVs only allows Swoobat to use Substitute four times and not five, which can potentially limit setup opportunities.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swoobat should never be directly switched into an oncoming attack; rather, it should be brought in safely with a slow pivot such as Eelektross or Type: Null, or after a Pokemon from your own side has fainted. Swoobat can also be used to revenge kill Pokemon such as Leafeon, which it takes advantage of by setting up on the forced switch. Calm Mind should be used in the face of weaker special attackers such as Lurantis and Combusken. Contrarily, Substitute should be used in the face of passive Pokemon such as Clefairy, Audino, and Altaria or when you predict a switch. Make use of Memento and dual screens wisely by correctly determining when to use Calm Mind or Substitute to better the chances of a sweep. Swoobat has the best chance to sweep late-game, since it can have issues setting up more than once and prefers that checks and counters such as Skuntank, Spiritomb, and revenge killers such as Kangaskhan and Lycanroc be removed before setting up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Despite its 4x resistance to Fighting-type attacks, Swoobat is not a sufficient Fighting-type answer, so Pokemon such as Oricorio-E and Silvally-Fairy that can check Fighting-types; especially Choice Scarf Primeape; but also do not overlap type weaknesses make good partners. Electrode can set up Reflect and Light Screen for Swoobat, which increases the likelihood of it setting up with Calm Mind and sweeping. However, Electrode and Swoobat do not work outside of dedicated dual screens teams and consequently are quite predictable in what they are trying to accomplish. Memento users such as Skuntank and Alolan Dugtrio can also assist Swoobat by lowering the foe's Attack and Special Attack by two stages each. Memento can also be powered up by Darkinium Z on Skuntank, allowing Swoobat the chance to set up a second time if needed. Swoobat is extremely frail, so slow pivots such as Lanturn, Type: Null, and Silvally-Fairy make good partners. Swoobat appreciates being paired with strong wallbreakers, such as Aggron, Absol, and Drampa, that can help pave its way towards a sweep to break defensive backbones like the combination of Spiritomb, Qwilfish, and Clefairy. Entry hazards such as Spikes and Stealth Rock from Mudsdale and Qwilfish support Swoobat by chipping away at the opposing Pokemon's health as it switches in, making it easier for Swoobat to nab the KO.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Audino can serve as a Wish passer, a special wall, or even a cleric and does very well on stall, especially with its high HP, good defenses, decent defensive typing, and access to Regenerator. Regenerator allows Audino to Wish pass, pivot, and switch into special attacks more effectively all while maintaining high HP. However, Audino can be very passive and a momentum drain at times with its low offenses, so it doesn't fit too well on offensive teams. It is also easily worn down once afflicted with status conditions or Taunt, crippled by Trick and Switcheroo, and easily used as setup fodder, depending on the set. Finally it faces competition from Clefairy as a special wall, which can set Stealth Rock but cannot Wish pass as effectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave can be used to cripple faster foes, such as Oricorio-G, and setup Pokemon, such as Dodrio. Double-Edge can supply Audino with a somewhat strong STAB attack to deal decent damage and place offensive pressure despite Audino's low Attack. However, this allows Ghost-types such as Oricorio-G to easily deal with Audino while making it much easier for Choice item and Eviolite users to switch in without the fear of losing their item. Audino can also serve as a Trick Room setter on Trick Room teams with a combination of Trick Room and Healing Wish.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers such as Alolan Raticate, Absol, and Aggron can easily break through Audino. However, certain physical attackers such as Stoutland and Primeape that can break through it have to watch out for Knock Off or Thunder Wave, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Primeape and Hitmonchan and even Fighting-type coverage such as Focus Blast on Jynx and Dynamic Punch on Golurk can 2HKO or OHKO Audino. Furthermore, Gurdurr can use Audino as fodder to set up with Bulk Up if Audino lacks Encore.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users such as Skuntank and Qwilfish leave Audino helpless, forcing it to use the rather weak Knock Off. Oricorio-E also carries Taunt as well as Roost, allowing it to use Audino as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: If Audino lacks Heal Bell, it can be easily crippled by Toxic users such as Alolan Persian and Altaria and by Toxic Spikes from Qwilfish. In addition, even if it carries Heal Bell, Audino can be stalled out of Heal Bell with Toxic due to its low PP without being able to do much in return.</p> <p><strong>Trick / Switcheroo</strong>: While Audino can check most special Pokemon, some such as Floatzel and Rotom-F can greatly cripple Audino by Tricking their Choice items to it.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Without Encore, Audino can struggle against setup sweepers such as Simisear, Carracosta, and Roost Oricorio-G, and it can even be used as setup fodder.

Knock Off allows Audino to cripple threats that depend on their items, such as Eviolite users like Clefairy, Tangela, and Type: Null and Choice item users such as Aurorus and Aggron. Like Wish, Heal Bell lets Audino provide support for both its teammates and itself, though it does so by healing status conditions. Toxic is used to deal with bulkier foes, such as Lanturn and Musharna, while preventing Audino from being too passive. Encore can be used to lock Pokemon into moves, stopping potential setup sweepers and allowing teammates to switch in more easily.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The constant recovery from Leftovers makes Audino harder to break down. Regenerator makes it easier for Audino to switch in and out, allowing it to more easily check foes while also making Wish passing more effective by restoring both the incoming Pokemon's and Audino's health on the same turn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Audino is best used against special attackers, which it can also set up Wish against. If you predict that a faster Pokemon will set up on Audino, try to use Encore on them the first turn they try to set up, or put them on a timer with Toxic. When facing a Choice item user such as Jellicent or Floatzel, be wary of Trick and Switcheroo. Audino can use Knock Off on incoming physical attackers such as Gurdurr and Stoutland as they switch in to cripple them. Audino makes a great pivot and can be switched in to scout Choice-locked Pokemon like Drampa and Choice Specs Jellicent or stack up chip damage on Life Orb or statused Pokemon before switching back out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Audino works especially well on stall and bulkier teams, being able to serve as a Wish passer, a special wall, and either a cleric or Toxic inducer, depending on what the team needs. That being said, it does not do very well on more offensively oriented teams, as it is often a large momentum drain due to its lack of offensive pressure, which isn't an issue on stall teams. Qwilfish goes excellently with Audino due to its ability to check many physical attackers and Fighting-types and set Spikes and Toxic Spikes; in return, Audino can Wish pass to it and take incoming special attacks for it while racking up the residual damage caused by Toxic Spikes with Protect. Other good defensive partners include Sableye, Tangela, and Spiritomb, which can also deal with Fighting-types, along with Gurdurr and Bronzor, which help deal with certain physical Pokemon such as Kangaskhan and Lycanroc. Defensive Pokemon lacking reliable recovery such as Regirock and Spiritomb appreciate Wish as a nice alternative way to restore health outside of Leftovers, and they also appreciate Heal Bell. Secondary special walls such as Clefairy can help against special attackers that Audino has a harder time with, such as Choice Specs Drampa, along with supplying Heal Bell if Audino doesn't run it. Due to its constant switching, Audino likes having hazards removed, so it works well with Pokemon such as Articuno, Altaria, Skuntank, and Silvally-Fairy. Grounded Poison-types, including the aforementioned Skuntank, also come in handy to remove Toxic Spikes upon switching in so that Audino can come in without being poisoned. Since Audino lacking Encore struggles against setup sweepers, Ditto, Pyukumuku, and priority users such as Skuntank make good teammates.</p>"

  "Gurdurr": {
    "overview": "<p>Gurdurr has just the right tools to succeed as both a Bulk Up sweeper and a defensive check to a large portion of the PU metagame. Gurdurr has great bulk that is further boosted by Eviolite, allowing it to act as a very effective blanket check to physical attackers like Stoutland and Aggron. It has a small but very useful movepool, including recovery in Drain Punch, priority in Mach Punch, and utility in Knock Off. Also, Gurdurr's ability Guts allows it to take advantage of a plethora of defensive Pokemon in the tier that can only meaningfully damage it with status. However, Gurdurr's special bulk is subpar, so it can be easily taken advantage of by common special attackers like Oricorio-E. Additionally, its only form of recovery, Drain Punch, is very unreliable, so it can be worn down throughout the match. Finally, because Gurdurr is reliant on Mach Punch to deal with faster Pokemon, they can easily exploit Gurdurr, especially if they are resistant or immune to Mach Punch like Victreebel and Oricorio-G.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gurdurr does not have too many other options that are worth running. Toxic is an option to cripple common switch-ins such as Oricorio-E and Silvally-Fairy. Stone Edge could be used to hit Flying-types like Swanna on the switch. A spread with 84 Speed EVs could be used to outspeed base 50 Speed Pokemon like Eelektross, but the drop in bulk makes Gurdurr less reliable. Ice Punch could be run over Knock Off or Mach Punch to lure in Victreebel and Oricorio-E; if running maximum Attack investment, it can notably 2HKO Victreebel upon switching in with the combination of Ice Punch and Mach Punch.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Musharna</strong>: Musharna can survive a Knock Off and 2HKO Gurdurr with its STAB attack; Colbur Berry and Z-Move variants of this Pokemon don't even particularly care about Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Oricorio-E and Swanna can easily switch into any of Gurdurr's attacks and threaten it with their STAB attacks. Swords Dance Scyther can set up on Gurdurr and KO it, but it does not appreciate losing its Eviolite.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Walls</strong>: Physically defensive walls such as Jellicent, Sableye, and Tangela are able to switch into Gurdurr lacking Toxic and proceed to stall it out.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Victreebel is notable for being able to switch into all of Gurdurr's attacks, save for the rare Ice Punch, and proceed to take it out with Leaf Storm or reliably wall it with Strength Sap. Other strong special attackers such as Drampa and Ludicolo threaten to OHKO or 2HKO Gurdurr, but most of them cannot switch into it.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Silvally-Fairy doesn't take much damage from Gurdurr's moves and can retaliate with Multi-Attack, but non-Swords Dance variants struggle to beat Gurdurr after a few Bulk Up boosts. Clefairy can chip away at Gurdurr if it is carrying Moonblast, but it does not appreciate losing its Eviolite.</p>",

      "Bulky Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Drain Punch is Gurdurr's main STAB move, which also provides it with an extremely useful form of recovery. Mach Punch makes up for Gurdurr's low Speed by allowing it to revenge kill faster Pokemon or clean late-game after checks to it have been weakened and it has used Bulk Up. Knock Off is a very helpful utility move that allows Gurdurr to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types like Golurk and Claydol on the switch as well as get rid of important items like Tangela's Eviolite. Finally, Bulk Up allows Gurdurr to beat many physical attackers one-on-one or clean late-game in conjunction with Mach Punch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Guts is the preferred ability because it allows Gurdurr to take advantage of Pokemon like Alolan Sandslash and Regirock, which can only damage it meaningfully by using status moves like Toxic. 212 Defense EVs are used in order to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Stoutland's Return after Stealth Rock. The rest of the EVs are funneled into HP and Attack, which along with an Adamant nature, give Gurdurr amazing physical bulk while still retaining an offensive presence. Eviolite further boosts Gurdurr's already decent bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gurdurr is an effective Bulk Up sweeper late-game, but should not bother setting up too early as it has many common checks which need to be weakened. Switch into Pokemon that Gurdurr checks, such as Skuntank and Lycanroc, in order to threaten them with Drain Punch or set up with Bulk Up. If you predict a switch into a Pokemon that walls Gurdurr like Jellicent, use Knock Off because removing Colbur Berry or Leftovers can help teammates wear them down more easily. Use Mach Punch to pick off weakened threats like Jynx and Dodrio, even after they've used their respective boosting move. Alternatively, after using Bulk Up, Mach Punch can be used to clean late-game once Gurdurr's checks, like Psychic- and Poison-types, have been weakened. Finally, although Gurdurr resists Dark-type moves, try not to switch into Knock Off, as Gurdurr's item is vital for it to act as a check to physical attackers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gurdurr fits best on offensive or balanced teams that can make use of its ability to be a blanket check to the tier's physical attackers. It struggles to take on both Poison- and Fairy-types, so Pokemon that give it a better matchup against them, such as Golurk and Haunter, make for decent partners. In return, Gurdurr can switch into the powerful physical moves that threaten these offensive Pokemon and threaten even faster Pokemon with Mach Punch. Gurdurr also is taken on easily by Oricorio-E, one of the most common Pokemon in the tier, so a switch-in to Flying-type STAB moves like Regirock and Lanturn is necessary. Pursuit trappers, such as Spiritomb or Skuntank, can also help to remove Psychic- and Ghost-types which give Gurdurr a hard time. Because Gurdurr's special bulk is subpar, Pokemon that have better special bulk such as the aformentioned Lanturn make for pretty good partners; Gurdurr can even take physical hits for them. In particular, Eelektross makes for a useful partner as it can whittle away at bulkier teams and take on Flying-types for Gurdurr.</p>"

  "Throh": {
    "overview": "<p>Throh's unique combination of Mold Breaker, Storm Throw, and great bulk gives it a niche, allowing it to bypass would-be checks like Tangela and Pyukumuku, edge out opposing setup sweepers such as Gurdurr and Calm Mind Spiritomb, and serve as a blanket check to Pokemon such as Hitmonchan, Lycanroc, and Alolan Persian. Throh also stands out from its main competitor in Gurdurr with its greater Speed, better special bulk, and ability to viably run Leftovers, which grants it passive recovery and many setup opportunities that Gurdurr lacks with the use of Substitute. However, Throh's overall poor Speed and lack of recovery options outside of Leftovers can make it easy to wear down prior to setup, especially by status if it can't use Substitute in time. The abundance of Fighting-type checks such as Oricorio-E, Victreebel, and Silvally-Fairy also serve as hindrances to Throh and can prevent it from successfully setting up if they're healthy enough to pivot in and threaten it. Finally, even with Throh's upsides, it faces competition with Gurdurr for a team slot due to the latter's higher physical bulk, access to Mach Punch for fast-paced teams, and better utilization of Guts to take advantage of status, though Throh's previously mentioned qualities and far greater matchup against balance and stall teams give it a reason to be used.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Guts allows Throh to punish faster users of status moves such as Jellicent and Sableye, but forgoing Mold Breaker takes away Throh's ability to threaten Pyukumuku, making it much harder for Throh to break a handful of stall teams, which is a solid reason to consider using it over Gurdurr. Toxic cripples answers to Throh like Oricorio-E, Sableye, and Silvally-Fairy, though it struggles to find room to run it. A RestTalk set with Circle Throw gives Throh a form of recovery and a way to rack up entry hazard damage. Offensive Throh sets like Choice Band can utilize its decent Attack and large movepool, but Throh lacks a powerful and spammable STAB move and is usually outclassed by more consistent wallbreakers such as Stoutland, Aggron, and Dodrio, all of which possess greater power or Speed. Other offensive Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan and Primeape are also preferred for their far better Speed tiers and the latter's ability to pivot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Pokemon like Oricorio-E, Swanna, and Scyther can pivot into Throh relatively easily and threaten it with their super effective moves, though Scyther doesn't appreciate Knock Off. Dodrio and Oricorio-G also threaten it but can struggle to switch in directly.</p> <p><strong>Fairy- and Psychic-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Silvally-Fairy, Alolan Raichu, and Musharna resist Storm Throw, and Silvally-Fairy is able to switch into even a boosted Knock Off. Silvally-Fairy and Alolan Raichu can also use Throh as a setup opportunity if forced out.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage and Status</strong>: Throh can struggle to set up if it switches into multiple entry hazards or takes chip damage trying to check Pokemon such as Lycanroc throughout a game. Faster users of status moves such as Sableye, Jellicent, and Qwilfish can cripple Throh before it can use Substitute, affecting its longevity and ability to threaten bulkier teams. All three of the above Pokemon can also use Taunt to prevent Throh from using Bulk Up or Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Various Wallbreakers</strong>: Even with Throh's solid defenses, strong attackers like Choice Band Aggron and Choice Specs Aurorus can easily 2HKO it, though neither can safely switch in or beat it if it's behind a Substitute. Victreebel is especially noteworthy, as it can wall Throh with Strength Sap and wear it down with repeated attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Storm Throw is Throh's most consistent form of damage output and can be used to ignore Defense boosts from Pokemon like Gurdurr and Mudsdale. Knock Off offers utility in removing items like Gurdurr's Eviolite, and it also targets Pokemon resistant or immune to Storm Throw such as Alolan Raichu and Oricorio-G. Substitute provides Throh with a shield from status moves, makes it harder to revenge kill, and allows it to utilize Bulk Up and its solid natural defenses to prevent weaker Pokemon such as Tangela and Skuntank lacking Choice Band from breaking it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>124 Speed EVs allow Throh to outpace uninvested Pokemon with base 60 Speed and slower such as Tangela, Regirock, and Audino. The given defensive EVs and an Impish nature prevent weaker Pokemon like Tangela, Ferroseed, and defensive Alolan Sandslash from breaking Throh's Substitute. Mold Breaker enables Throh to beat Pyukumuku, a staple on stall teams.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Throh is best used late-game when defensive checks like Silvally-Fairy and Victreebel as well as wallbreakers such as Dodrio are weakened or out of the picture. Utilize Throh's incredible matchup against bulkier teams to take advantage of Pokemon like Regirock, Gastrodon, Tangela, and Calm Mind Spiritomb, but find a way to switch it in through a pivot or a predicted attack, as the former three can carry Toxic and cripple Throh. Feel free to use Substitute against such Pokemon if the opposing team does not have an immediate switch-in, as they usually lack the proper tools to break it and allow Throh to set up. If Throh can't successfully set up yet, Knock Off is a great move to spam early-game to remove items from checks like Oricorio-E and Sableye, as well as scout for potential Z-Move users. Make use of another teammate to eliminate or severely weaken such checks to ensure that Throh can perform its role later in a match. Keeping Throh healthy and away from status moves is important if its setup abilities are needed so that it can have safer opportunities to use Bulk Up or Substitute, so exercise caution when using it to soft check Pokemon such as Cryogonal or sending it out with entry hazards on the field.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Poison-types like Qwilfish, Roselia, and Skuntank are great partners for Throh, since they can switch into Toxic and absorb Toxic Spikes, and Choice Band Skuntank is an excellent Pursuit trapper that deals with many of Throh's checks like Sableye and Musharna. Toxic Spikes from Qwilfish and Roselia as well as Destiny Bond from Qwilfish can cripple and eliminate several checks to Throh, and Throh can use Substitute to continually inflict residual damage alongside Toxic Spikes. Entry hazard setters in general like Regirock and Alolan Sandslash aid Throh in breaking through teams, and both serve as answers to some of Throh's checks like Oricorio-E. Offensive teammates such as Lycanroc, Rotom-F, and Absol are also nice partners for Throh as powerful attackers that can target the Flying- and Psychic-type that pose a significant threat to it. All of these Pokemon also appreciate Throh's ability to soft check the likes of Hitmonchan and Alolan Persian. Throh appreciates teammates that can support its longevity, so Aromatherapy or Heal Bell users like Lurantis and Lanturn are useful for removing status ailments that can cripple Throh, while Z-Parting Shot Alolan Persian and Healing Wish Musharna can bring it back up to full health. Pivots such as Silvally-Fairy, Lanturn, and Alolan Persian are excellent ways to bring Throh into play without forcing it to take excessive damage or a potential status move. Parting Shot from Silvally-Fairy and Alolan Persian can even make it easier for Throh to set up, but U-turn Silvally-Fairy is also a viable option as a unique way to lure Regirock for Throh to take advantage of.</p>"

  "Leavanny": {
    "overview": "<p>Due its decent Speed stat, offensive presence, and useful support moves, Leavanny stands its ground as an acceptable Sticky Web user in PU. Leavanny's decent Attack stat, good STAB moves, and Bug / Grass typing give it a good matchup against common Stealth Rock users in PU such as Torterra, Regirock, and Mudsdale, and access to Knock Off lets Leavanny cripple Pokemon holding items like Eviolite and Leftovers. Leavanny also gets Magic Coat, which lets it bounce back entry hazards and status moves such as Taunt and Encore against foes like Sableye and Liepard. However, Leavanny's bad defensive typing, Stealth Rock weakness, and average bulk make it very easy to wear down, which means it can't keep up Sticky Web reliably during the match. Leavanny's typing also makes it weak to common Defoggers such as Skuntank and Swanna. Finally, Leavanny faces heavy competition from superior Sticky Web setters in Shuckle, who offers far better bulk and access to additional utility in Stealth Rock and Encore, and Smeargle, who similarly has access to utility such as Spore, Stealth Rock and Nuzzle that makes it more desirable on the majority of Sticky Web teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Chlorophyll and Overcoat could be used over Swarm; Chlorophyll provides a better matchup against sun teams and Overcoat protects Leavanny from being KOed from Aurorus or Abomasnow's hail after it has been knocked down to its Focus Sash. However, sun teams aren't common and weather damage doesn't really stop Leavanny from setting Sticky Web. A Swords Dance set could be used due to Leavanny's decent Speed and Attack stats, but this is done better by other Grass-types in the tier such as Leafeon with its better stats and Shiftry with its better offensive typing and priority. A mixed set with Electroweb / Leaf Storm / Knock Off or Magic Coat / Sticky Web could be used too; Electroweb hampers leads such as Lycanroc with the Speed drop and prevents Swanna from using Defog. Leaf Storm hits physical walls such as Mudsdale harder than Leaf Blade, and Knock Off and Magic Coat are used in the same way as the main set. However, mixed Leavanny struggles with Skuntank and Assault Vest Hitmonchan.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Pokemon with a fast Taunt like Lycanroc and Sableye can prevent Leavanny from setting Sticky Web; however, all Taunt users need to be wary of the possibility of Magic Coat.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removal</strong>: Pokemon that can remove Leavanny's Sticky Web from the field after it faints such as Skuntank and Hitmonchan render Leavanny's attempts useless.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types like Articuno and Oricorio-E are immune to Sticky Web, take nothing from Leavanny's attacks, and threaten it with super effective moves or use Leavanny as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Combusken and Simisear resist Leavanny's STAB moves and KO it with their super effective STAB moves if Leavanny's Focus Sash has been broken.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sticky Web": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sticky Web is the only reason for using Leavanny, lowering opposing grounded Pokemon's Speed by one stage. Knock Off removes items such as Leftovers and Eviolite from opposing Pokemon like Ferroseed, which cripples them for the rest of the battle. Magic Coat could also be used to bounce entry hazards such as Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes from Pokemon like Ferroseed, Roselia, and Qwilfish and Taunt from Pokemon like Lycanroc and Sableye.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Focus Sash is the preferred item because Leavanny is used as a suicide lead and it guarantees Sticky Web to go up at least once in the match while also activating Leavanny's ability Swarm. Swarm is the preferred ability due to its ability to boost the power of X-Scissor after the Focus Sash is consumed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Leavanny should be used as a lead to set up Sticky Web early on. However, if the opponent has an entry hazard remover such as Swanna or Skuntank that can't be pressured enough, you can keep Leavanny around to set Sticky Web later. Leavanny's main priority is to set Sticky Web, but in some cases it can be used offensively. If Leavanny has already set up Sticky Web and is facing a Stealth Rock or Spikes user that cannot be removed like Alolan Sandslash or Ferroseed, spamming Magic Coat to at least get the hazards on your opponent's side of the field too before being KOed is a good idea.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Leavanny should be used on hyper offensive teams that can exploit Sticky Web. Good partners for Leavanny are the Pokemon that take most advantage of Sticky Web such as Zangoose and Haunter. Offensive Pokemon that can spinblock also make good partners for Leavanny, as they can simultaneously keep Sticky Web on the field and benefit from the Speed drops. Oricorio-G is a particularly good spinblocker because it also pressures Skuntank with its Supersonic Skystrike. Golurk is another notable spinblocker, since it also provides Stealth Rock and acts as a solid Primeape check, which can be a pain to deal with on Sticky Web teams due to its ability Defiant. Conversely, Pokemon that can punish Defog with Defiant or Contrary like Primeape, Pawniard and Servine are also great partners for Leavanny. Electric-types such as Eelektross and Lanturn help deal with Flying-type Pokemon like Articuno and Swanna, which are immune to Sticky Web.</p>"

  "Basculin": {
    "overview": "<p>Basculin's access to Adaptability and good Speed tier give it a slight niche as a physical Water-type that can more easily break through more physical walls like Mudsdale and Metang and revenge kill targets with Aqua Jet than other physical Water-types. However, Basculin's wallbreaking capabilities are limited due to its poor movepool causing it to struggle against teams with more defined Water-type answers and its only decent Attack stat preventing it from reliably sweeping and making its coverage less powerful. Because its base Attack stat is not the greatest, its coverage moves don't deal the best damage, and Basculin is overreliant on Adaptability. Along with susceptibility to all entry hazards, Basculin's poor bulk is not doing it any favors and makes it vulnerable to being knocked out by priority moves such as Sucker Punch and Mach Punch. While Basculin's Speed is good, it sits at that uncertain point where it is fast but not fast enough to outspeed everything that it wants to, such as Lycanroc and Dodrio. It also faces competition from its Water-type brethren such as Floatzel and Carracosta, which offers more immediate power and access to Shell Smash, respectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Zen Headbutt allows Basculin to hit Pokemon such as Poliwrath and Qwilfish for additional damage; however, it's not recommended because it isn't particularly strong, requiring three hits to take out Qwilfish after Intimidate, and Basculin can rarely afford to take the chip damage Qwilfish inflicts through Rocky Helmet and Scald. Running Zen Headbutt also means that Basculin loses out on Superpower or Crunch, which means it can no longer hit Ferroseed, Jellicent, or Jynx. A Choice Band set is a double-edged sword in that it boosts Basculin's Attack but is prediction reliant and leaves Basculin locked into one move, potentially allowing the opponent to switch to a threat such as Gurdurr, Ludicolo, or Scyther and set up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Fellow Water-type Pokemon such as Poliwrath, Jellicent, Qwilfish, and Silvally-Water give Basculin a hard time and don't give it much room for error, since the former two have Water Absorb and the latter three often run bulky sets. Qwilfish is also able to set up entry hazards, and Silvally-Water chips Basculin down with Surf or can take it out in one hit with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Due to Basculin's mediocre Attack stat and poor bulk, it struggles to break through physically bulky Pokemon such as Gurdurr, Tangela, and Spiritomb without prior damage. Basculin does chip them easily, and the number of times they can switch in decreases over time.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: While Basculin has nice Speed, it gets outsped and OHKOed by common faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Primeape, Alolan Persian, Alolan Raichu, and Dodrio. Aqua Jet can pick off these Pokemon if they're weak enough, though.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Due to Basculin's poor bulk, it can be picked off by priority move users such as Gurdurr, Absol, Spiritomb, and Kangaskhan. It is also forced into mind games with the aforementioned Sucker Punch users.</p>",

      "All-out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Waterfall has a chance to make the opposing Pokemon flinch, while running Liquidation is another option for slightly more power. Aqua Jet allows Basculin to revenge kill faster Pokemon that are weakened such as Choice Scarf Primeape. Ice Beam deals with Grass- and Dragon-types such as Tangela, Torterra, and Altaria that would otherwise check Basculin. Superpower hits Water-resistant threats such as Ferroseed, Abomasnow, and Drampa the hardest, while Crunch covers Jellicent and Jynx.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Waterium Z gives Basculin a one-time nuke against Pokemon like Regirock and Type: Null, whereas Life Orb is more consistent in dealing damage to the opposing team for the course of the entire battle. The recoil can end up being Basculin's enemy over time, however. Adaptability boosts Basculin's Water-type STAB moves even further to the point where they heavily wear down the opposing team. A Naive nature enhances Basculin's Speed without hindering the power of its Ice Beam, allowing it to outrun threats such as Oricorio-E and Silvally-Fairy.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Basculin functions primarily as a physical wallbreaker by slowly breaking down physically bulky Pokemon over time. Due to its poor bulk, Basculin should never be switched into any attacking move unless it absolutely has to, in order to preserve its longevity. Basculin does have to be aware of Pokemon with Water-type immunities such as Poliwrath, Gastrodon, and Jellicent as well as Pokemon that resist Water, which include Ludicolo, Lanturn, and Silvally-Water. However, with its coverage moves, Basculin can function as a lure for some Water-type answers such as Jellicent and Ferroseed, opening the door for teammates like Lycanroc to take them out after they've been weakened. Basculin should almost always be using Liquidation or Aqua Jet and not reveal coverage until absolutely necessary, since both Water-type moves are boosted by Adaptability. Basculin should use its Adaptability-boosted Aqua Jet to revenge kill threats that are faster than it such as Dodrio, Choice Scarf Primeape, and Alolan Dugtrio.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Grass- and Electric-types such as Lurantis and Lanturn threaten Basculin, so Pokemon such as Oricorio-G and Mudsdale are helpful to come in and check these Pokemon. Basculin dislikes priority users such as Kangaskhan and Lycanroc, so physical walls such as Regirock and Tangela are ideal teammates that can come in to take their priority moves and force them out. Similarly, Basculin loses to most Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Scyther, so pair it with a physical wall like the ones mentioned above so that they can keep these revenge killers in check. Basculin does not appreciate taking damage from entry hazards because they wear it down over the course of the battle, so a hazard remover such as Hitmonchan or Skuntank can remove them and open doors for Basculin's teammates. Skuntank also resists Grass-type moves from Pokemon such as Tangela that hurt Basculin and can also Pursuit trap Choice Specs Jellicent. Teammates that appreciate Rock- or Ground-types such as Aggron and Mudsdale being removed work well with Basculin; these teammates include physical Skuntank and Scyther. Entry hazard setters such as Torterra, Regirock, and Roselia make great teammates, as Basculin can force switches to wear down the opposing team with the hazards. Although Basculin does possess coverage moves to hurt Water-type Pokemon such as Poliwrath and Jellicent, having faster or powerful Pokemon such as Alolan Raichu and Eelektross to cover them will help it, while the aforementioned entry hazard users can indirectly chip Basculin's counters in range of its coverage options.</p>"

  "Maractus": {
    "overview": "<p>Even with access to Spikes, Maractus struggles to find a niche over other Grass-types with Spikes like Roselia and Ferroseed. Both have much greater defensive presences thanks to their secondary typings. Even when used as a lead, Maractus's stats bar its Special Attack are mediocre, most notably its Speed, which means it often can only set up one layer of Spikes before being KOed. Furthermore, Pokemon with Taunt like Qwilfish and Alolan Persian can prevent Maractus from setting up Spikes at all, or they can be removed later in the game by the abundance of entry hazard removers like Skuntank, many of which beat Maractus in a matchup, which essentially negates its one goal.</p>",

Its one niche over other Grass-types and common leads is in Endeavor, which works well alongside Sucker Punch and Focus Sash. However, due to Maractus's low Speed, it is difficult to pull off while also managing to set up Spikes, so it rarely works out. Because of this and various other reasons, you're much better off using other Grass-type Spikes setters like Ferroseed and Roselia.</p>"}},

  "Crustle": {
    "overview": "<p>Crustle is a usable suicide lead on hyper offense teams thanks to its ability to set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes, a feature lacking in most other lead Pokemon. Additionally, Crustle packs nifty moves in Knock Off and Rock Blast, which are very effective against entry hazard setters and removers like Mudsdale, Ferroseed, and Cryogonal. Crustle has two useful abilities that solidify its role as an entry hazard setter, with Sturdy letting it survive at least one attack and Weak Armor letting it take advantage of physical attackers by receiving a Speed boost when hit, allowing Crustle to outspeed most of them and set up another hazard the following turn. However, Crustle's selection of coverage moves is rather lacking, often making it setup fodder to bulkier Pokemon such as Carracosta and Alolan Sandslash. Crustle is also very slow and generally passive, which makes it vulnerable to Taunt users such as Alolan Persian and Lycanroc. Special attackers in particular are a pain for it, as Crustle has mediocre Special Defense, and special attacks do not activate Weak Armor. Crustle faces immense competition as a hazard setter from Pokemon such as Aurorus, Aggron, and especially Omastar which can apply offensive pressure alongside setting up Stealth Rock, and Omastar boasts higher Speed and offensive power. Lastly, Crustle is quite one-dimensional and predictable, as it's outclassed in other roles like a Shell Smash sweeper and a fully defensive wall by Pokemon like Carracosta and Regirock, respectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Crustle can make use of Shell Smash, but such a set is outclassed by Carracosta and Turtonator, as the former boasts a larger mixed movepool and priority, while the latter is much harder to wall with its near-unresisted dual STAB coverage. Crustle will also find itself susceptible to Choice Scarf revenge killers and priority, as it's weak to moves such as Aqua Jet and Accelerock. Counter is a nasty surprise for powerful physical attackers that can bring Crustle down to low health, but this is often really hard to pull off successfully. Moreover, Crustle would usually rather be setting up entry hazards or attacking with its utility moves. Earthquake targets Pokemon like Aggron and Alolan Dugtrio, although the utility brought from Knock Off and Rock STAB moves are generally more useful. Block is an interesting choice that allows Crustle to trap passive Pokemon and set up multiple layers of Spikes. Red Card is an option that forces a one-time switch on the opposing Pokemon when Crustle is attacked, giving Crustle another opportunity to set up hazards or get a favorable matchup. Crustle can act as a more defensive lead with a bulkier spread and Toxic to wear down opposing defensive leads such as Regirock and Carbink. However, this is usually outclassed by Regirock and Mudsdale, as Crustle lacks a decent defensive ability and has a weakness to Stealth Rock.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Crustle has a mediocre Special Defense stat that leaves it vulnerable to faster special attackers such as Oricorio-E and Alolan Persian, which makes it difficult to set up any more than one entry hazard. To make matters worse, several special attackers, in general, annoy Crustle to varying degrees. Lanturn's Scald can potentially burn Crustle and mitigate its Sturdy or Focus Sash. Abomasnow and Aurorus's hail chip damage also bypass this, KOing Crustle at the end of the turn if it is low enough. While it must fear Knock Off, Haunter can use Trick to swap Crustle's item for a Choice item, which impairs its ability to set up hazards and makes it incredibly vulnerable to setup Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Fast Taunt Users</strong>: Faster Taunt users like Sableye and Lycanroc generally limit Crustle to only being able to set up one hazard or none at all. Certain Taunt users such as Sableye can also burn it with Will-O-Wisp. The Mental Herb set alleviates this issue somewhat, but versus the aforementioned faster Taunt users, Crustle can only set up one hazard before it's left vulnerable.</p> <p><strong>Hazard Removers</strong>: Users of Rapid Spin and Defog such as Hitmonchan and Swanna can remove all of Crustle's hazards in one turn, thereby making its efforts worthless. Because of Crustle's hasty nature of stacking hazards, it's often impossible to get up hazards again in the likelihood that Crustle is KOed.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Entry Hazard Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes is another entry hazard that damages grounded Pokemon, can be stacked, and whittles at and pressure teams in tandem with Stealth Rock. Knock Off removes items such as Eviolite and Leftovers from Pokemon like Gurdurr and Audino, which, in conjunction with hazards, assists the rest of the team in wearing down opposing Pokemon to secure KOs. STAB Rock Blast pressures entry hazard removers like Cryogonal and Swanna, but Stone Edge can be used instead for a more consistently powerful STAB move, but it lacks the ability to break through Sturdy and Focus Sash Pokemon and can be PP stalled by Pokemon such as Substitute Articuno.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The items and abilities are tailored to however Crustle wants to get up entry hazards. Focus Sash with Weak Armor allows Crustle to usually get up at least two hazards versus physical attackers like Pinsir and Golurk by being able to outspeed them the following turn thanks to the speed boost Weak Armor provides. The Defense drop is also helpful for having Crustle get KOed quickly and being able to pivot in another Pokemon. Mental Herb with Sturdy gives Crustle an easier time setting up hazards, as Mental Herb nullifies one instance of Taunt and Encore, giving Crustle the ability to set up at least two hazards versus slower Taunt users such as Probopass.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Crustle should be used as a suicide lead, as its mission is to get up as many entry hazards as possible. However, if one runs the Focus Sash variant of Crustle and the opposing team reveals or has an obvious Taunt user, it's often safe to not lead Crustle until said Taunt user is off the field or eliminated; Stealth Rock leads such as Lycanroc and Aggron will often carry Taunt. Also, be cautious of Crustle's weakness to Stealth Rock, which can limit the number of times it can switch in if Stealth Rock is on the field. Stealth Rock is usually the most important hazard to set up first, since it hits Pokemon of all types, but it's still important to evaluate whether Stealth Rock or Spikes is more valuable to set up first in the event that Crustle can only set up one form of hazards. For instance, a team with a few Fire- and Flying-types will not appreciate taking Stealth Rock damage. However, versus grounded offensive teams and bulky Fighting- and Ground-types, Spikes is generally more useful. The Focus Sash + Weak Armor set must be cautious of faster Taunt users such as Skuntank and Alolan Persian, as Crustle cannot get up hazards versus them. Likewise, the Mental Herb + Sturdy set has to watch out for attackers that can 2HKO it such as Leafeon and Kabutops, which limit the number of hazards it can successfully set up. In some instances, getting up every single hazard may not be necessary. It might be better to break Focus Sash or Sturdy from leads like Lycanroc and Golem so they can be revenge killed the following turn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Crustle is best used on hyper offense for its ability to chip away at and break down teams with its entry hazards. Thus, setup sweepers and wallbreakers that enjoy Crustle's hazards are ideal teammates, including Alolan Raichu, Stoutland, Simisear, and Leafeon. Ghost-type Pokemon that block Rapid Spin such as Oricorio-G and Haunter are useful for keeping Crustle's hazards up on the field. Oricorio-G is a notable example, as it threatens to OHKO Hitmonchan with Supersonic Skystrike. Crustle will often be KOed after hazards are set up, so deterrents of Defog such as Primeape and Pawniard are good to switch into after Crustle goes down, and these Pokemon also like having entry hazards up to secure KOs. While not mandatory on more offense-oriented teams, users of Rapid Spin like Hitmonchan, Cryogonal, and Alolan Sandslash keep Crustle's hazards on the field while removing the opponent's. Fast Taunt users such as Floatzel and Alolan Persian prevent the opposing team from using Defog.</p>"

  "Carracosta": {
    "overview": "<p>Carracosta finds its place in the PU metagame as a potent setup sweeper and wallbreaker thanks to its access to Shell Smash, a STAB priority move, respectable offensive presence, and a great physically defensive presence. Its typing, physical bulk, and ability Solid Rock grant Carracosta multiple setup opportunities in front of Normal- and Flying-types in the tier, and its good attacking stats allows it to run a mixed set able to break through a big portion of the tier. Its access to Aqua Jet gives it a niche over its main competition as a Shell Smash user in the tier, Omastar, since it allows Carracosta to break through common Choice Scarf users in the tier such as Primeape and Dodrio as well as naturally faster Pokemon, meaning that it's harder to revenge kill than its competition. Despite this, a low Special Defense stat and a terrible Speed stat mean that Carracosta is often forced out by many common special attackers such as Victreebel, Alolan Raichu, and Ludicolo if it hasn't managed to set up. This problem is further accentuated by its 4x weakness to Grass and weakness to common types such as Electric and Fighting from the likes of Abomasnow, Eelektross, and Gurdurr. Carracosta also struggles to break through physical walls such as Tangela and Ferroseed if it lacks the coverage move to hit them for maximum damage. Furthermove, Carracosta still suffers competition from Shell Smash Omastar, which outclasses it in power and Speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Grass can allow Carracosta to better threaten Gastrodon and Poliwrath, but tends to be inferior to the coverage of Superpower. A physically defensive set with Stealth Rock / Scald / Rock Slide / Toxic can be utilized but is often outclassed by the likes of Regirock, which has a better defensive typing and stats, and Omastar, which has a better offensive presence as well as the option of Spikes. A set with Shell Smash / Stone Edge / Aqua Jet / Stealth Rock can be utilized for role compression, as well as giving Carracosta more utility while also bluffing the regular Shell Smash set, allowing it to set Stealth Rock early- to mid-game and secure more potential setup opportunities due to your opponent not expecting Shell Smash. On the downside, giving up a coverage move for Stealth Rock often stops Carracosta from breaking through certain threats. Sturdy can be utilized to allow Carracosta to setup more reliably but is negated after it has taken hazard damage and makes Carracosta even more vulnerable to priority moves such as Mach Punch while giving up the defensive utility of Solid Rock.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Tangela and Torterra are easily able to take on any Carracosta sets lacking Ice Beam. Ferroseed is able to counter Carracosta after a Shell Smash unless it's running Superpower. Other Grass-types such as Victreebel, Ludicolo, and Abomasnow are able to beat Carracosta prior to setup but can lose after a Shell Smash. Choice Scarf Abomasnow can check Carracosta even after setup.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Gastrodon is able to take all of Carracosta's STAB moves and threaten it back with Toxic, but struggles to handle Carracosta after Shell Smash due to All-Out Pummeling taking it out in one shot and a potential Hidden Power Grass doing the same. Defensive Jellicent is able to stop Carracosta from setting up with Taunt due to its higher Speed and can beat it one-on-one, while threatening any set that doesn't carry Rockium Z with Will-O-Wisp even after it has used Shell Smash. Physically defensive Poliwrath is able to live any hit from Carracosta even after Shell Smash and can phaze Carracosta out with Circle Throw.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Gurdurr is able to take on Carracosta, as it takes a boosted Hydro Pump from full and is able to recover its health via Drain Punch, which is even more troublesome for non-White Herb sets. Other Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan and Choice Scarf Primeape are able to check Carracosta, the latter being able to outspeed it after a Shell Smash, though neither appreciate being hit by a boosted attack and cannot OHKO Carracosta from full health. Life Orb Carracosta even has a chance to OHKO Primeape with +2 Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Strong wallbreakers such as Rotom-F, Choice Specs Aurorus, and Alolan Raichu are all able to OHKO Carracosta with their respective coverage moves, though they aren't able to beat it after a Shell Smash.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Priority moves from the aforementioned Gurdurr and Hitmonchan as well as Sucker Punch from the likes of Skuntank and Kangaskhan are able to damage Carracosta despite its Speed boosts, though the latter can only revenge kill it after it has taken a significant amount of damage. Carracosta can also find ways to play around Sucker Punch via Aqua Jet and Shell Smash.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Aqua Jet grants Carracosta a STAB priority move that allows it to OHKO or heavily damage a great number of faster Pokemon after a Shell Smash boost such as Alolan Raichu, Choice Scarf Primeape, Aurorus, and Dodrio. Hydro Pump allows Carracosta to threaten physically defensive Pokemon that might not fear Stone Edge or Aqua Jet such as a healthy Mudsdale, Regirock, and Gurdurr. Superpower in conjunction with Fightinium Z gives Carracosta another reliable way of dealing large amounts of damage to both Pokemon in addition to Regirock and Ferroseed, at the cost of using the item slot. Ice Beam allows Carracosta to break through Tangela and reliably OHKO Torterra.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Rockium Z provides Carracosta with a powerful STAB Z-Move that's able to OHKO even physically defensive Pokemon such as Qwilfish after a Shell Smash and avoids the risk of Stone Edge potentially missing. Life Orb is an option that allows Carracosta to deal as much consistent damage as possible, notably granting a high chance of OHKOing Choice Scarf Primeape from full health after Stealth Rock damage, as well as OHKOing Alolan Raichu and dealing greater amounts of damage to Gurdurr and Tangela with Hydro Pump. White Herb enables Carracosta to maintain its defenses after a Shell Smash, making it harder to revenge kill for priority move users such as Hitmonchan and Choice Scarf users such as Primeape from full health. Solid Rock grants Carracosta additional setup opportunities and leaves it less vulnerable to moves such as Mach Punch. A Naughty nature maximizes Carracosta's Attack while sacrificing its already low Special Defense, allowing it to still be able to utilize both physical and special moves effectively and granting it multiple setup opportunities on many physically oriented Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If you're trying to sweep with Carracosta, you should attempt to wear down the opposing team as much as possible for it to clean late-game. This can be done by removing physical walls such as Tangela as well as Pokemon such as Gurdurr and Gastrodon if Carracosta is lacking the right move to deal damage to them. Bring in Carracosta in on Normal- and Flying-types such as Kangaskhan and Choice-locked Dodrio or weak physical attackers such as defensive Alolan Sandslash and Regirock, allowing it to set up Shell Smash with little to no risk, though Carracosta must be wary of Toxic from the last two. You should attempt to weaken Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Rotom-F so they're in range of +2 Aqua Jet. Carracosta can also attempt to set up Shell Smash early in a match with the intention of wearing down a team or getting rid of a potential threat, offering support to its teammates by removing their checks or counters, though this can cause the loss of a potential late-game wincon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Tangela, Ludicolo, and Victreebel are able to threaten bulky Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types that Carracosta might not be able to break through without prior damage, such as Gastrodon, Regirock, and Mudsdale. Entry hazard setters such as Ferroseed, Torterra, and Qwilfish are able to support Carracosta by wearing down opposing teams with Stealth Rock and Spikes and thus putting revenge killers in range of its boosted Aqua Jet. Strong special wallbreakers such as Alolan Raichu, Simisear, and Abomasnow are able to wear down and beat physical walls such as Tangela as well as other physically oriented Pokemon like Regirock and Gurdurr, which might be an issue for Carracosta if it's lacking Hydro Pump. Similarly, the aforementioned Tangela as well as Sableye and Oricorio-E are able to beat Fighting-types such as Gurdurr, Hitmonchan, and Primeape. Wallbreakers like Stoutland as well as Knock Off users like Gurdurr are able to cripple bulky physical walls such as Tangela by removing their Eviolite. Hazard removal from the likes of Skuntank, Alolan Sandslash, and Cryogonal is greatly appreciated for keeping Carracosta as healthy as possible. Skuntank also is able to absorb Toxic Spikes, while the other two are able to maintain hazards on the opposing side thanks to Rapid Spin. Their ability to check various Grass-type Pokemon in the tier such as Victreebel is also a great asset that further increases their synergy with Carracosta.</p>"

Swanna's higher-than-average Speed tier lets it outspeed important threats such as Skuntank and Oricorio-E, and as a Choice Scarf user it is capable of outspeeding key threats such as Choice Scarf Primeape and +1 Jynx. Because Swanna is so effective at forcing switches, it can use the free turns generated to provide Defog support for its teammates, giving it further utility. Unfortunately, neither Swanna's offenses nor its defenses are particularly impressive. Its offenses are made up for by its high-powered STAB attacks, but Hurricane's accuracy and Brave Bird's recoil are both disappointing. Its defenses are made even worse by a weakness to Stealth Rock, leaving it unable to consistently wall many stronger threats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Waterium Z in conjunction with Rain Dance could be used, which allows Swanna to act as a cleaner, but this set is rather outclassed by Ludicolo. Choice Band lets Swanna function as a formidable wallbreaker and revenge killer, and it notably lets it pressure one of its best counters in Lanturn, as it can use Brave Bird to 2HKO Assault Vest variants. Z-Mirror Move allows Swanna to function as a physical wallbreaker, but it can only boost once, and Aqua Jet is often too weak to compensate for Swanna's somewhat mediocre Speed. Liquidation can be run over Scald on a physically based Choice Scarf set. While it does significantly more damage to Eelektross, it does very little to Regirock and Aggron. Toxic lets it surprise Pokemon like Musharna lacking Heal Bell, but it is hard to give up Roost or Defog. Hidden Power Grass can be used on Choice Scarf Swanna in order to reliably revenge kill Carracosta, but it is otherwise worthless.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Assault Vest Lanturn and Eelektross can switch into Swanna consistently and gain momentum for the opposing team with Volt Switch. Alolan Raichu, Rotom-F, and Oricorio-E cannot switch in reliably but are all capable of OHKOing Swanna with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Clefairy, Type: Null, and Audino aren't 2HKOed by any of Swanna's moves, and they can retaliate with their STAB moves, cripple it with status, or set up with Swords Dance. Many of them even have recovery, which allows them to ignore even the small bit of damage that Swanna's moves do to them. Cryogonal can offensively check most Swanna variants, but it has to watch out for Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Swanna's poor bulk leaves it easily revenge killed by faster foes such as Lycanroc and Dodrio if Swanna is not carrying a Choice Scarf. Choice Scarf Dodrio is also notable for being able to revenge kill even Choice Scarf Swanna.</p>",

      "Offensive Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog is one of the main reasons to use Swanna, allowing it to support its teammates by removing entry hazards. Since Stealth Rock damage, Life Orb recoil, and repeatedly switching into attacks can wear Swanna down throughout the match, Roost is run to help with this issue by granting Swanna reliable recovery, as well as allowing it to check Fighting-types more consistently.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Flyinium Z lets Swanna OHKO Pokemon such as Assault Vest Hitmonchan and avoid Hurricane's accuracy issues. Life Orb is an option to consistently boost Swanna's damage output, but this comes at the cost of significant recoil that stacks up quickly in conjunction with Stealth Rock damage. None of Swanna's abilities are particularly useful, but Hydration is helpful in fringe situations against rain teams.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swanna can switch into many passive foes and Pokemon with a type disadvantage, such as Qwilfish and Gurdurr, and use the opportunity to remove entry hazards. However, Swanna ought to prioritize wallbreaking in many matchups, as it can easily wear down most of its checks. However, if the opponent has a Pokemon such as Lanturn, Clefairy, or Type: Null that Swanna will be unable to break through, double switching to a physical attacker that can better handle them is often an effective strategy. Utilize Roost in order to better check Pokemon like Gurdurr throughout the match, but do not bother with it if Swanna does not need to stay healthy for longer matches. Be careful of using Defog against teams with Primeape, especially if Swanna or your other Fighting-type checks are weakened, as giving Primeape a Defiant boost can be deadly. Swanna's Z-Move does not have to be meticulously preserved; it can be a useful tool for nabbing KOs in certain situations but can be used whenever the opportunity presents itself.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swanna can provide entry hazard removal, so Pokemon that do not appreciate Stealth Rock or Spikes such as Simisear and Type: Null pair well with it. Swanna is a decent offensive check to Fighting-types like Gurdurr, Hitmonchan and Primeape, so Pokemon that appreciate this like Absol and Jynx make for decent partners. Physical wallbreakers like Primeape, Stoutland, and Aggron are good partners because they pressure the specially defensive Pokemon that wall Swanna, such as Eelektross and Clefairy. Despite Swanna being a decent check to Fighting-types, it should not be your main check unless your team is very offensive, as it gets worn down very quickly. Therefore, Jellicent and Clefairy make for good teammates because they take some of the pressure off of Swanna. Finally, Electric-types like Eelektross give Swanna a lot of trouble because they can use Volt Switch to gain momentum while easily KOing it, so Pokemon immune to Electric-type moves like Lanturn and Torterra make great partners.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird allows Swanna to pressure more specially bulky foes, such as Cryogonal and Jynx, and it is a more reliable attack than Hurricane due to its better accuracy. Defog is used for emergency entry hazard removal.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment is preferred to boost Hurricane and Scald's damage output as much as possible. A Naive nature is used to avoid decreasing Brave Bird's power, and reducing Swanna's Special Defense is preferred over its Defense to better check Fighting-types. Maximum Attack investment can be run to gear Swanna more towards using Brave Bird rather than Hurricane, but it is somewhat unnecessary to do so, since Brave Bird already nets KOs on many important specially bulky threats. However, this can help mitigate Hurricane's accuracy issues.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Swanna is mostly used as a revenge killer, and it should be brought in to force out or KO slower threats such as Jynx and Oricorio-G. The set has some surprise factor, so concealing Swanna's set through double switching and not using Brave Bird too early can lead to a surprise KO later on. Defog should only be used in emergency situations, as it forces Swanna to switch out after use and makes Swanna setup fodder. Swanna can often be used as a late-game cleaner, but be aware that Hurricane is an unreliable move. Use Brave Bird when possible, as it is a much safer option despite its recoil. However, Hurricane is necessary for KOing certain physically bulky Pokemon such as Gurdurr.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swanna acts as a reliable revenge killer for mostly balanced and offensive teams. Pokemon that are often setup fodder, such as Clefairy, appreciate its ability to handle sweepers such as Jynx. Secondary entry hazard removers such as Lurantis can be useful, as Choice Scarf Swanna can be worn down quickly by Stealth Rock. Electric-immune Pokemon such as Lanturn are very useful for covering Swanna's biggest weakness. Similarly, checks to Rock-types such as Hitmonchan can be worthwhile, especially since Lycanroc is one of the few sweepers that Swanna has no hope of revenge killing. Hitmonchan can also function as a secondary entry hazard remover. Pursuit trappers such as Skuntank and Spiritomb can help to chip away at Eelektross, Lanturn, and Cryogonal.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Access to Chlorophyll and a boosting move in Swords Dance allows Sawsbuck to become a formidable sweeper under sun, outspeeding every unboosted threat in the PU metagame, including Choice Scarf users like Primeape even with an Adamant nature. One of Sawsbuck's main perks over other sun-based sweepers is its access to Jump Kick, which enables it to easily whistle past Steel-types such as Aggron and Alolan Sandslash, threats that the likes of Leafeon otherwise struggle to deal with. STAB Double-Edge, boosted by Swords Dance and Normalium Z, also allows Sawsbuck to break through physically defensive walls like Tangela. Unfortunately, despite Sawsbuck's solid Speed, it's still dependent on sun being active to function, as Choice Scarf users such as Jynx and Primeape outspeed it otherwise and OHKO it. Sawsbuck's defensive typing also gives it six weaknesses to common types including Fighting, Flying, and Ice, making it easy to revenge kill should sun not be up. Users of Mach Punch such as Hitmonchan and Gurdurr are especially threatening, as they always hit Sawsbuck first with a super effective move and punch through its mediocre defenses. Furthermore, setup is mandatory in order for Sawsbuck to power through foes, and finding time to set up is difficult given its several aforementioned weaknesses. The prevalence of bulky Calm Mind Oricorio-G is a major roadblock for Sawsbuck, as it possesses a resistance or immunity to all of its attacks. Lastly, Sawsbuck competes with Leafeon and other Chlorophyll users such as Shiftry for a teamslot, as these Pokemon possess their own useful traits such as high physical bulk and STAB priority in Sucker Punch, respectively.</p>",

However, this move has limited use outside of this and is therefore hard to justify fitting into a moveslot. In a similar manner, Toxic cripples Tangela by putting it on a permanent timer, but this offers little utility elsewhere. Sawsbuck can function independently from sun teams and utilize its other ability, Serene Grace. This ability, alongside the move Headbutt, can be used to cause an opposing Pokemon to flinch 60% of the time, which can be utilized with Thunder Wave to minimize the chances of a foe being able to attack. However, faster Pokemon such as Scyther, Swanna, and Choice Scarf Primeape are quite common and can revenge kill Sawsbuck provided they're not paralyzed. A Jolly nature allows Sawsbuck to outspeed Pokemon like Skuntank outside of sun, but the drawback in power is considerable. Return is an alternative STAB move to Double-Edge that doesn't deal recoil damage, but it is not recommended for similar reasons to running a Jolly nature, as Sawsbuck forfeits a lot of its attacking power. Most notably, Sawsbuck will fail to OHKO Tangela with a Swords Dance-boosted Breakneck Blitz.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Lack of Sun</strong>: Without sun being active, Sawsbuck's merely decent Speed is exposed, letting threats such as Jynx, Simisear, and Swanna outspeed and OHKO it. Opposing weather setters such as Abomasnow and Aurorus can freely shift weather by switching in and can even outspeed Sawsbuck if holding a Choice Scarf, but they must be careful about taking an unwanted Jump Kick. Other weather sweepers such as Alolan Sandslash and Ludicolo can take advantage of either hail or rain being active and can use their STAB or coverage moves to exploit Sawsbuck's common weaknesses and poor defenses.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Moves such as Kangaskhan's Fake Out and Spiritomb's Sucker Punch hit Sawsbuck first. Fake Out notably burns a turn of sun, while Spiritomb can also threaten Sawsbuck with Will-O-Wisp. Additionally, Abomasnow's Ice Shard and Hitmonchan's Mach Punch are super effective and severely dent Sawsbuck.</p> <p><strong>Oricorio-G</strong>: Oricorio-G is able to take a hit from Sawsbuck and OHKO it back with Supersonic Skystrike due to its immunities and resistances to its moves. Bulky variants of Calm Mind Oricorio-G are even able to switch into Sawsbuck after a Swords Dance boost. Oricorio-G lacking Flyinium Z are forced to risk a coinflip with Hurricane due to sun, however.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Without any boosts or a lack of a Z-Crystal, Sawsbuck struggles to break through Pokemon like Tangela and Ferroseed, which threaten to do serious damage to it in return. Sableye gets a special mention, as it's immune to Double-Edge and Jump Kick and can cripple Sawsbuck with a priority Will-O-Wisp before it is able to use Horn Leech.</p>",

      "Sun Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance gives Sawsbuck the functionality of a wallbreaker and setup sweeper. Double-Edge is a powerful STAB move capable of breaking through physically bulky Pokemon like Musharna and Tangela with Normalium Z and Swords Dance boosts. Horn Leech is Sawsbuck's Grass-type STAB move that hits Rock-, Water-, and Ground-types such as Regirock, Omastar, and Golurk while also recovering 50% of damage dealt. Jump Kick fills in the last slot for its ability to target Steel-types such as Alolan Sandslash and Ferroseed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature increases Sawsbuck's offensive presence, and as it's already able to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame in sunny weather, a Jolly nature isn't necessary. Chlorophyll is important for Sawsbuck to function, doubling its Speed when under sun. Normalium Z gives Sawsbuck a one-time powerful attack, which lets it break through walls like Gurdurr and lacks Double-Edge's recoil. Life Orb is a viable option over Normalium Z for well-rounded damage output and the ability to run a Z-Move on another teammate, but the recoil caused by both this item and Double-Edge reduces Sawsbuck's longevity and can force it to use Horn Leech on crucial turns to avoid being KOed by recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Sawsbuck serves as both a wallbreaker and late-game sweeper. It can utilize Swords Dance and Normalium Z to punch holes through walls for other teammates, while at the same time it can put its impeccable Speed tier to use to clean up late-game. Since Sawsbuck's frailty and common weaknesses prevent it from reliably switching directly into attacks, bring it in safely through means of momentum from Pokemon like Volbeat, as it preserves Sawsbuck's limited longevity. Feel free to set up on Pokemon such as Audino, Altaria, and Clefairy lacking Thunder Wave, as due to their passive nature and poor matchup, Sawsbuck threatens to break through them. Sawsbuck can additionally pressure Pokemon like Lanturn and Silvally-Water, as while they sometimes carry Ice Beam, the prospect of Sawsbuck's Horn Leech is often enough to force a switch. An opponent may try using Protect with Pokemon like Audino and Regirock or otherwise try switching out in order to stall out sun turns, which makes for another opportunity to utilize Swords Dance. Save Sawsbuck's Z-Move for dire situations, as it's an important tool for breaking through walls as well as preventing Double-Edge's recoil. Sawsbuck will fail to break through Pokemon like Gurdurr and Type: Null if they're healthy and Sawsbuck can no longer use its Z-Crystal. Using Breakneck Blitz can also help Sawsbuck win over matchups against powerful offensive threats such as Drampa, which can otherwise survive an unboosted Double-Edge or Jump Kick if kept relatively healthy.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Having sun up is key for Sawsbuck to function, so setters such as Regirock and Volbeat are important for granting it a Chlorophyll boost; Regirock can provide additional support through Stealth Rock, while Volbeat can comfortably switch into priority moves such as Mach Punch. Liepard can also provide support through Thunder Wave, and can pivot with U-turn to bring Sawsbuck in safely. Wallbreakers such as Victreebel and Simisear are valued on sun teams, as they can weaken physically bulky Pokemon such as Gurdurr and Tangela. Victreebel can additionally absorb Toxic Spikes by switching in. These Pokemon appreciate Sawsbuck being able to power through specially bulky Pokemon such as Muk and Probopass. Other sun sweepers like Shiftry and Exeggutor appreciate Sawsbuck's ability to remove Steel-types with Jump Kick, as well as its ability to check miscellaneous threats to sun teams such as Drampa and Munchlax.</p>"

  "Jellicent": {
    "overview": "<p>Jellicent is a great Pokemon in PU with an excellent defensive typing, helpful stats, and access to good utility moves such as Recover and Will-O-Wisp that allows it to stay healthy throughout the match and cripple Pokemon. Thanks to its bulk, it can also check prevalent foes such as Primeape and Alolan Sandslash. Additionally, Jellicent can run potent offensive sets like Choice Specs and Trick Room thanks to its powerful Water Spout and good dual STAB coverage, allowing it to become a threatening wallbreaker or late-game sweeper. Jellicent's useful Ghost typing also gives it a niche on hazard stacking teams, giving it a strong matchup against spinners like Hitmonchan and Alolan Sandslash, though both can cripple it with Toxic. Despite these attributes, Jellicent is very prone to residual damage, meaning that it can be worn down quite easily. Jellicent is also passive when used defensively, allowing offensive threats such as special Victreebel and Oricorio-E in for essentially no risk, while Choice Specs Jellicent is heavily reliant on prediction and can be exploited by threats like Jynx, Lurantis, and Dodrio easily once locked into an attack. Finally, Jellicent is also easily Pursuit trapped by Pokemon such as Stoutland and Skuntank.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A specially defensive set can also be run to take on special attackers like Eelektross and Simisear more easily, but this means that Jellicent will have trouble against physical attackers such as Kangaskhan.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Victreebel and Lurantis can switch into defensive Jellicent with little to no risk and threaten it out. However, some of them do not like Toxic or Will-O-Wisp and cannot handle attacks from the Choice Specs set.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Lanturn and Eelektross can take hits from defensive Jellicent pretty easily and threaten it out with Volt Switch. However, Eelektross cannot take a Water Spout very well from Choice Specs Jellicent. Offensive Electric-types such as Alolan Raichu and Manectric also force it out and threaten to set up with Nasty Plot in the former's case.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Trappers</strong>: Pursuit trappers like Stoutland and Skuntank easily can threaten Choice Specs Jellicent out and KO it with Pursuit. However, neither can switch into Jellicent and both dislike taking a Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Faster Taunt Users</strong>: Faster Taunt users such as Alolan Persian and Oricorio-E can shut down defensive Jellicent by not allowing it to recover health or cripple Pokemon with status moves. Oricorio-E can even use it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Jellicent is vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards and also dislikes getting poisoned. This makes it difficult to check Pokemon it normally would like Gurdurr and weakens the power of Water Spout to the point where Hydro Pump is the most reliable attack on the Choice Specs set.</p>",

      "Defensive Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Hex is Jellicent's best STAB attack, turning into a 130 Base Power attack in conjunction with Will-O-Wisp or Toxic while dealing neutral damage against a majority of the tier. Scald is an option over Hex that can be more useful against Pokemon like Mudsdale, Stoutland, and Kangaskhan, but the power difference is not very notable against the Pokemon it hits harder, and Hex generally will be dishing out more damage. Taunt is used to stop setup sweepers such as Carracosta as well as to prevent other walls such as Clefairy and Gastrodon from recovering health or crippling Jellicent with Toxic. Will-O-Wisp is used to cripple physical attackers like Skuntank and Hitmonchan. Toxic can be used over Will-O-Wisp to cripple opposing walls like Eelektross and Cryogonal.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Colbur Berry's damage reduction allows Jellicent to retaliate and cripple Dark-type Pokemon like Skuntank with Will-O-Wisp, as well as granting it a better matchup against Pokemon with Dark-type coverage like Gurdurr. Alternatively, Rindo Berry significantly improves Jellicent's matchup against Simisear, which commonly runs Grassium Z. Leftovers is an option over either Berry, giving Jellicent passive recovery and making it less easily worn down by chip damage. Leftovers also gives Jellicent a bit more breathing room to use its other moves instead of Recover when it's low on HP. The Speed EVs allow Jellicent to outspeed maximum Speed Carracosta and cripple it with Taunt before it can use Shell Smash. Cursed Body generally is more useful than Water Absorb, allowing Jellicent to disable the moves of Choice-locked Pokemon like Stoutland and Pokemon such as Gurdurr and Kangaskhan, which only have one move to break Jellicent.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is more defensive, which allows the player to more liberally switch Jellicent into Pokemon that it walls like Primeape. Thanks to its Ghost typing, Jellicent should be used as a spinblocker against spinners like Alolan Sandslash and Hitmonchan, although it must be wary of Toxic from the former and Thunder Punch from the latter. Even if Jellicent is in a position where spinners can wear it down or cripple it, Jellicent should be played aggressively to stop the opposing team from removing entry hazards. It is essential to keep Jellicent as healthy as possible and avoid being crippled by Toxic, as this puts Jellicent on a timer and hinders its longevity. Be wary when playing against status absorbers such as Gurdurr and Stoutland; you don't want to burn them with Scald or Will-O-Wisp or badly poison them with Toxic, as being statused increases their power greatly. When Colbur Berry is equipped, Jellicent should use Will-O-Wisp against Dark-type Pokemon like Skuntank and Alolan Raticate.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As a defensive utility Pokemon and spinblocker, Jellicent fits well on many hazard stacking teams. As such, entry hazard users such as Ferroseed and Roselia work wonderfully with it. These two also have the added benefit of absorbing Toxic and, in the latter's case, Toxic Spikes for Jellicent and being solid Electric- and Grass-type switch-ins. In the same regard, Stealth Rock users also share defensive synergy with Jellicent. Stealth Rock users such as Regirock, Mudsdale, Alolan Sandslash, and Ferroseed make for good partners. Regirock, Mudsdale, and Ferroseed can take on Normal-types like Kangaskhan, while Alolan Sandslash can check Grass-type Pokemon like Abomasnow. In return, Jellicent can counter Fighting-type Pokemon such as Primeape, Hitmonchan, and Gurdurr. Entry hazard removal is very important, since Jellicent is worn down easily by all forms of entry hazards. Thus, spinners like Hitmonchan and Alolan Sandslash make for good partners. If Jellicent is not on a hazard stacking team, then Defog users such as Cryogonal, Lurantis, and Skuntank work just as well. Cryogonal also checks special attackers like Aurorus and Rotom-F, Lurantis can check Grass-type Pokemon and act as a cleric with Aromatherapy, and Skuntank can Pursuit trap troublesome Pokemon like Haunter and Alolan Raichu. Offensive Pokemon like Simisear and Lycanroc that are weak to Water-type Pokemon like Floatzel also appreciate Jellicent's defensive utility. Simisear also checks Grass-type Pokemon like Victreebel and Roselia, while Lycanroc can break Pokemon like Eelektross. Finally, Pokemon like Mudsdale and Eelektross can also help Jellicent against Electric-type Pokemon like Lanturn, while Pokemon like Oricorio-E take on Grass-types such as Victreebel, Lurantis, and Simisage.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Taunt": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Water Spout is an incredibly strong attack when Jellicent has an opportunity to come in on Pokemon like Mudsdale and Regirock, able to KO both at full power and KOing Pokemon like Oricorio-E after Stealth Rock. Shadow Ball lets Jellicent pressure Pokemon like Musharna and opposing Jellicent. Taunt is a fantastic tool that lets Jellicent break through defensive Pokemon like Ferroseed, Clefairy, and Audino, stopping the former two from setting up entry hazards against it, while checking Pokemon like Mudsdale and Regirock more reliably, preventing a crippling Toxic or a Stealth Rock on a predicted Recover. Hydro Pump with a Colbur Berry is an option if Jellicent's team already has a Z-Move user, providing a powerful move that isn't reliant on HP. It is, however, noticeably weaker versus targets like Eelektross and less accurate. Further, Waterium Z mitigates the downside of Water Spout getting weaker with lower HP.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Waterium Z lets Jellicent bypass the HP requirements for a powerful Water Spout, once, with a 200 BP Hydro Vortex. This nuke can also be used more generally to snag important KOs, such as always KOing Assault Vest Eelektross after a Water Spout, or potentially KOing Choice Specs Drampa after a Water Spout and Stealth Rock. Colbur Berry with Hydro Pump is an option alongside a different Z-Move user, stopping Dark-types like Skuntank and Absol from threatening Jellicent as easily. However, the big drop in power sacrifices the 2HKO on, for example, Eelektross after Stealth Rock. Cursed Body with Recover lets Jellicent fish for disables against Pokemon like Freeze-Dry Cryogonal and Earthquake Mudsdale, but Water Absorb's Water immunity helps against Pokemon like opposing Jellicent, giving a more comfortable entry against a slower Jellicent. It may also refill HP for Water Spout. However, opposing Jellicent can predict its entry and nail it with a boosted Hex or Shadow Ball.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Offensive Taunt Jellicent is a deadly wallbreaker that can provide a lot of defensive utility, checking Pokemon like Primeape and Alolan Sandslash. Jellicent should, however, be careful about taking unecessary chip damage and status when trying to switch into Pokemon like Mudsdale, especially if it has already used Hydro Vortex. Toxic especially hinders its longevity and Water Spout's power. Taunt + Recover makes Jellicent a solid stallbreaker, but Jellicent it must be careful about wasting its 8 Water Spout PP against special walls like Audino. Whether Jellicent should preserve its Z-Move for later in the match, when heavy chip damage may weaken Water Spout, or use it more proactively tends to depend on the specific situation. Choice Specs Drampa is one scary threat often worth removing with Hydro Vortex, once it is below 50% HP, since it semi-consistently switches into Recover and Shadow Ball, proceeding to bother Jellicent's teammates. Walls like specially defensive Torterra are other targets, since they can prevent Jellicent from making meaningful progress otherwise. If there's no particularly great Hydro Vortex target, it's very useful to save it so Pokemon like Rotom-F and Stoutland can't freely switch in later, once Jellicent has too low HP to reliably threaten them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Z-Move Jellicent fits on bulky offense and balance teams that want Jellicent's defensive utility against Pokemon like Alolan Sandslash and Primeape, but also appreciate it doubling up as a powerful wallbreaker. Pokemon that can check Drampa are essential with Jellicent. Carbink can defensively check Drampa and other Jellicent checks like Oricorio-E and Cryogonal, as well as providing Stealth Rock to help wear down said checks. Silvally-Fairy can offensively check Drampa while discouraging it to click Draco Meteor, and it can bring Jellicent in on Mudsdale and Regriock with U-turn for wallbreaking opportunities. Primeape can similarly check Drampa offensively and bring Jellicent into Mudsdale and opposing bulky Jellicent. Oricorio-E and Oricorio-G checks are helpful, such as Lanturn and Regirock. Lanturn can also help check Rotom-F and opposing Lanturn while providing Heal Bell support; this is helpful, as Jellicent is likely to take Toxic eventually when switching into Mudsdale and especially Regirock. Regirock as a teammate can instead check special walls like Cryogonal and offer Stealth Rock support. Jellicent appreciates entry hazard removers like Cryogonal, Alolan Sandslash, and Silvally-Fairy to keep its Water Spouts as powerful as possible. These Pokemon can assist in checking the likes of Drampa, Victreebel, and Oricorio-E for Jellicent. Late-game cleaners like Calm Mind or Trick Room Musharna and Calm Mind Oricorio-E appreciate Jellicent breaking through special walls, like Audino. They can also help check Victreebel for Jellicent, while Oricorio-E can also check Torterra.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam lets Jellicent pressure Dragon-types like Drampa and Altaria that would otherwise easily wall it and eases its task of cleaning late-game, netting considerable damage on targets such as Torterra, Victreebel, and Oricorio-E. Alternatively, Recover allows Jellicent to play a more active role early- to mid-game, letting it function as a solid switch-in to foes like Gurdurr and Alolan Sandslash throughout the match, making it harder to revenge kill, and allowing it to consistently set up Trick Room later in the game.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Quiet nature along with 0 Speed IVs allows Jellicent to outspeed almost the entire metagame when Trick Room is active. Ghostium Z turns Shadow Ball into Never-Ending Nightmare, which lets Jellicent take out a large portion of the metagame, including bulky Psychic-types such as Musharna and Bronzor and prevalent Water-type checks such as Victreebel, Lurantis, and Abomasnow, after slight chip damage. Alternatively, Waterium Z lets Jellicent bypass Hydro Pump's imperfect accuracy and deal considerably more damage to targets such as Gurdurr, Eelektross, and Stoutland.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Jellicent performs best late-game, when it can utilize its good coverage and ability to outspeed the majority of the metagame under Trick Room to function as a cleaner. However, it can also attempt to wallbreak early-game by threatening Stealth Rock setters such as Regirock and Mudsdale, foes its typing allows it to switch into like Primeape, and targets that may switch in expecting defensive Jellicent such as Drampa and Victreebel. If Jellicent is running Recover, it can also be used early- to mid-game as a solid switch-in to foes such as Alolan Sandslash and Gurdurr and utilize forced switches to regain health. It can also perform double switches to get the upper hand on expected switch-ins like Cryogonal and Lanturn. Otherwise, Jellicent should ideally be preserved until late-game and attempt to set up Trick Room once priority users that threaten it such as Skuntank, Absol, and Kangaskhan have fainted and specially defensive foes like Cryogonal, Lanturn, and Articuno have been KOed or severely weakened. Jellicent should ideally attempt to set up Trick Room against foes that can't weaken it with coverage or cripple it with Taunt, such as Mudsdale, Alolan Sandslash, and Combusken, as well as against Choice item users locked into unfavorable moves, such as Primeape, Aurorus, and Drampa.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Jellicent partners well with other slow Pokemon that can benefit from Trick Room turns, such as Gurdurr, Musharna, and Drampa. Gurdurr is an excellent offensive partner, as it is able to switch into Jellicent's checks such as Kangaskhan, Cryogonal, and Alolan Persian. In return, Jellicent is able to break through foes that Gurdurr struggles with such as Mudsdale, Claydol, and Qwilfish. Musharna can support Jellicent by increasing its wallbreaking potential with Future Sight, notably letting Jellicent break through special walls such as Articuno and Lanturn, as well as Dragon-types like Drampa and Altaria in case it isn't running Ice Beam, and giving variants that lack Recover additional opportunities to wallbreak with Healing Wish. In return, Jellicent can break through Steel-types that Musharna struggles with such as Alolan Sandslash and Metang. Drampa has a notably good matchup against Grass-types such as Victreebel that can check Jellicent when Trick Room is not active and is able to apply pressure to specially defensive foes like Lanturn and Eelektross. In return, it highly appreciates Jellicent being able to check Silvally-Fairy as well as Fighting- and Ice-types like Gurdurr and Alolan Sandslash. Eelektross provides Jellicent with momentum via a slow Volt Switch, appreciates Trick Room turns to pick off weakened foes, and assists it in pressuring opposing Water- and Grass-types such as Lanturn and Lurantis. Jellicent fits well on entry hazard-stacking teams, acting as a solid late-game cleaner that benefits from Stealth Rock and Spikes support, as well as a decent spinblocker due to its good matchup against common spinners such as Alolan Sandslash, Claydol, and non-Thunder Punch Hitmonchan. The chip damage from entry hazards guarantees its ability to OHKO foes such as Victreebel, Oricorio-E, and Rotom-F and pressure switch-ins such as Cryogonal and Articuno. Regirock, in addition to providing Stealth Rock support, is notably able to counter Cryogonal as well as deal with Skuntank, Absol, Kangaskhan, and Calm Mind Oricorio-E, and it appreciates Jellicent threatening Fighting-types like Gurdurr as well as Ground-types like Mudsdale. Torterra can assist Jellicent by pressuring Eelektross as well as Water-types like Lanturn and Gastrodon. Ferroseed has great defensive synergy with Jellicent, as it can handle physical attackers that Jellicent struggles with such as Kangaskhan and Skuntank and scout Choice-locked foes such as Drampa for potential coverage. In return, Jellicent can check Fire- and Fighting-types that threaten Ferroseed like Combusken and Primeape. Cryogonal is an ideal spinner to pair with Jellicent, as it can take on threats like Victreebel, Oricorio-G, and Lanturn that are capable of checking Jellicent outside of Trick Room, and in return, it appreciates Jellicent handling Regirock, Metang, and Choice Scarf variants of Alolan Sandslash. Kangaskhan and Jellicent assist each other by pressuring common targets and easing either Pokemon's job of late-game cleaning. Kangaskhan notably has a good matchup against foes that Jellicent relies on Trick Room to beat, like Victreebel and Stoutland, and Jellicent can clear roadblocks for Kangaskhan such as Mudsdale and Gurdurr. Primeape, aside from providing momentum with U-turn and bringing Jellicent in against targets like Mudsdale and Musharna, can revenge kill checks to Jellicent such as Kangaskhan, Absol, and Alolan Raichu. Pursuit users such as Skuntank and Stoutland can greatly assist Jellicent by Pursuit trapping foes that threaten it outside of Trick Room such as Oricorio-G, Alolan Raichu, and Haunter, as well as by alleviating pressure on it to check Musharna. Both teammates appreciate Jellicent's ability to deal with physical walls such as Mudsdale and Regirock as well as Fighting-types like Primeape and Gurdurr.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>With maximum health and Water Spout, Jellicent can break through dedicated special walls such as Audino and Clefairy, and Water Spout's accuracy makes it easy to spam early-game when Jellicent is likely at full health. Shadow Ball is Jellicent's best Ghost-type STAB attack and hits Pokemon that are immune or resistant to Water Spout such as Jynx, Gastrodon, and Lanturn. Hydro Pump is a good alternative Water-type attack once Water Spout is weakened. Ice Beam is a good coverage attack that hits Grass- and Dragon-types like Lurantis and Drampa harder than Jellicent's other attacks. Trick is an option over Ice Beam due to its ability to cripple walls that switch into Jellicent such as Articuno and bulky pivot Lanturn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment ensures that Jellicent outspeeds Jolly Aggron and can revenge kill everything slower. Water Absorb is useful for regaining HP so Water Spout is powerful again.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Jellicent is best used as an early- and mid-game wallbreaker due to its high damage output when at full health. Thus, try to keep Jellicent as healthy as possible throughout the match, preferably getting it in play through a slow pivot or well-played double switch. Water Spout is easily the most spammable move in Jellicent's arsenal, so use it when Jellicent is healthy and use Hydro Pump when Jellicent is weakened unless you cannot afford the accuracy drop in the given scenario. Jellicent should use Shadow Ball when predicting Water-immune Pokemon like Gastrodon and Jynx to switch in. If running Trick, make sure your opponent feels comfortable switching into Jellicent with their special wall first, or else you may mispredict and lose Jellicent's Choice Specs with no gain. Lastly, be wary of Pursuit users like Skuntank and Stoutland.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard setters such as Regirock, Roselia, and Alolan Sandslash pair well with Jellicent and bolster its offensive prowess. For example, Jellicent is able to 2HKO Ferroseed after Spikes damage. Entry hazard removal is mandatory to keep Jellicent as healthy as possible. Pokemon like Alolan Sandslash, Skuntank, and Silvally-Fairy can be useful additions for this role. The former two have the added utility of switching into Grass-types, while the last can be a designated Fighting-type check, since Jellicent doesn't function as one with its offensive set. Silvally-Fairy can also bring in Jellicent safely with Parting Shot or U-turn. Physical attackers such as Stoutland, Aggron, and Gurdurr pair well, as they can break through counters like Roselia, Lanturn, and Articuno. In return, Jellicent can break through the physical walls that threaten them, such as Regirock and Mudsdale. Additionally, Pokemon like Mudsdale, Eelektross, Roselia, Skuntank, and Oricorio-E that can switch into Electric- and Grass-type Pokemon make for good teammates. Lastly, Pokemon like Omastar, Gurdurr, Alolan Persian, and Carracosta that can take advantage of Skuntank after it uses Pursuit and Choice-locked Stoutland are very useful. Alolan Persian also provides Z-Parting Shot support, which essentially gives a second life to Jellicent.</p>"

  "Ferroseed": {
    "overview": "<p>Ferroseed's typing, bulk, and ability to use Eviolite make it a solid entry hazard setter and a very reliable check to threats such as Kangaskhan, physical Skuntank, and Omastar. These attributes also give it a good matchup against common entry hazard removers like Alolan Sandslash and Cryogonal lacking Hidden Power Fire, as well as a clear niche over other entry hazard setters like Qwilfish, in addition to its ability to set both Spikes and Stealth Rock unlike other defensive Steel- and Grass-types like Metang and Tangela. Although Ferroseed has a low Attack stat, it can make up for it with Gyro Ball hitting frailer threats fairly hard due to its low Speed, which means that it can't be used as setup fodder by threats like Dodrio. However, while Ferroseed's typing is great, it leaves it open to threats like Gurdurr and Simisear, which can set up on it. It also finds itself unable to switch into threats like Eelektross, Victreebel, Silvally-Fairy, and Stoutland, which often run Fire and Fighting coverage to hit Steel-types, and it's also somewhat passive, which leaves it susceptible to Taunt users like Oricorio-E and Jellicent. Ferroseed faces competition from Tangela, which deals with threats like Stoutland and Kangaskhan better and has Regenerator, and other entry hazard setters like Qwilfish and Roselia, which are faster, have better utility, and, in the case of the latter, are less passive. Lastly, Ferroseed's lack of reliable recovery leaves it susceptible to repeated attacks and entry hazards, although this can be slightly alleviated by Leech Seed. It's also overly reliant on its Eviolite, which makes it extremely susceptible to Knock Off.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic is a strong option for Ferroseed, as it has no other way to threaten Torterra, Oricorio-E, and other Pokemon that take very little damage from its Gyro Ball. However, Ferroseed loses out on utility from not running Protect, such as the ability to scout foes like Primeape. Ferroseed can make use of Thunder Wave to lower the foe's Speed and cripple faster threats that try to take advantage of it. It can also make use of Knock Off to cripple Pokemon reliant on their item like Gurdurr and Drampa. However, this makes Ferroseed even more passive and makes it harder for it to deal with Lycanroc. Bullet Seed is an option to deal with Carracosta and Omastar more reliably, but it also makes Ferroseed extremely passive and leaves it unable to threaten Drampa.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Simisear, Combusken, and Turtonator all greatly threaten Ferroseed with their STAB and can even use it as setup fodder. However, they can get chipped down decently fast between entry hazards and Gyro Ball if they try to switch in directly.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Gurdurr, Hitmonchan, and Throh can all get past Ferroseed without much difficulty, and Hitmonchan can even remove the entry hazards Ferroseed sets, while Gurdurr and Throh can use it as setup fodder. They all dislike Leech Seed and, in Hitmonchan's case, Gyro Ball, although Throh can avoid Leech Seed with Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Pokemon such as Victreebel, Stoutland, Drampa, and Eelektross can all get past Ferroseed easily, and Calm Mind Drampa can even use it as setup fodder. Outside of Eelektross and Drampa, though, none of them really appreciate switching into it, and Ferroseed can also scout for what move Choice Specs Drampa and Stoutland lock themselves into.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Oricorio-E, Qwilfish, and Sableye can all cripple Ferroseed with Taunt, which makes it unreliable at doing its job. Moreover, Oricorio-E can use Ferroseed as setup fodder; Qwilfish can set up entry hazards on it; and Sableye can remove its Eviolite with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage and Knock Off</strong>: Due to its lack of reliable recovery, Ferroseed can easily find itself overwhelmed by entry hazards and repeated attacks. In a similar manner, Knock Off from the likes of Absol, Kabutops, and Dodrio leaves Ferroseed unable to perform its job effectively.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leech Seed allows Ferroseed to weaken foes like Gurdurr and Simisear, which might attempt to take advantage of it, and provides decent healing due to Ferroseed's low HP stat. Gyro Ball takes advantage of Ferroseed's abysmal Speed to hit fast and frail threats like Dodrio, Lycanroc, and boosted Omastar decently hard. Protect allows Ferroseed to scout Choice-locked Pokemon like Primeape and Drampa, take Z-Moves from Pokemon like Alolan Persian and Alolan Raichu more comfortably, and get more Leech Seed recovery. Running both Spikes and Stealth Rock can be considered, although Ferroseed can't do its job as reliably without Protect, and this can also leave it overwhelmed, as it's forced to perform more tasks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Special Defense and HP investment alongside Eviolite allows Ferroseed to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Scarf Aurorus's Blizzard after Stealth Rock and hail damage. The leftover EVs go into Defense to allow Ferroseed to take hits such as Kangaskhan's Double-Edge and Lycanroc's Fire Fang more comfortably. A Relaxed nature is preferred over Impish to slightly boost Gyro Ball's power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ferroseed should aim to switch into threats like Kangaskhan and Aggron and proceed to set Spikes or Stealth Rock, as these threats find themselves forced out. It can also use Leech Seed to cripple the incoming Pokemon and recover some health. Against threats that commonly run Choice items, such as Drampa, Stoutland, and Primeape, Ferroseed should use Protect to scout what they're locking themselves into. This allows you to react accordingly and either switch out to a threat that deals with the Choice-locked foe, keep Ferroseed in to set Spikes or Stealth Rock up, or even use Leech Seed to recover health or Gyro Ball to weaken the foe. However, Pokemon such as Gurdurr and Oricorio-E can take advantage of that by setting up. Against frail and fast threats, such as Lycanroc, Dodrio, and Haunter, prioritize using Gyro Ball over setting entry hazards up or using Leech Seed, as they all take a good amount of damage. Ferroseed may need to be careful about preserving its health if it's needed to check a late-game sweeper such as Omastar or Alolan Sandslash. In these cases, prioritize chipping down foes and healing Ferroseed with Leech Seed over setting entry hazards.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ferroseed appreciates spinblockers, so Jellicent and Oricorio-G make for good partners. They also deal with Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Primeape for Ferroseed and appreciate the entry hazards it sets. In exchange, Ferroseed deals with Kangaskhan and Lycanroc. Due to its weakness to Fire-types such as Simisear and Fire-type coverage from threats like Victreebel, Pokemon that resist Fire like Lanturn and Altaria make for decent teammates, although Defog Altaria can conflict with a Spikes-setting Ferroseed. They can also cure Ferroseed from status with Heal Bell. Fighting-type switch-ins such as Oricorio-E, Musharna, and Swanna are all heavily appreciated by Ferroseed, and Oricorio-E can even keep Ferroseed's entry hazards up with Taunt. In return, Ferroseed switches into troublesome Rock-types for Oricorio-E and Swanna. Ferroseed forms a solid entry hazard setting core with Regirock, which also switches into Oricorio-E and Oricorio-G for Ferroseed and lifts some pressure off Ferroseed to check Normal-types. In exchange, Ferroseed can check Ground-types like Golurk and Mudsdale and pivot into a predicted Toxic. Pokemon such as Stoutland, Eelektross, Articuno, and Dodrio appreciate the entry hazards Ferroseed sets, as they allow them to either wallbreak or sweep more easily. Finally, due to Ferroseed's lack of reliable recovery, it can easily find itself overwhelmed by opposing entry hazards. Due to this, entry hazard removers like Hitmonchan and Cryogonal make for good partners. Hitmonchan appreciates the entry hazards Ferroseed sets, potentially allowing it to clean late-game with Mach Punch, while Cryogonal switches into Victreebel and Aurorus and appreciates Ferroseed's ability to switch into Pokemon like Lycanroc.</p>"

  "Eelektross": {
    "overview": "<p>Eelektross is one of the best pivots in PU and fits into almost any team, having a useful defensive presence and using its wide array of moves in order to be an amazing wallbreaker. These moves consist of both coverage that can hit many Pokemon super effectively and support moves that can cripple Pokemon that don't mind the coverage. Its ability, Levitate, makes Eelektross immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, giving it an easier time switching in and defensively checking Flying-, Ground-, and Steel-types as well as certain special attackers such as Swanna, Mudsdale, Alolan Sandslash, and Lanturn. However, despite being able to check so many Pokemon, Eelektross is prone to being worn down by Toxic, Leech Seed, and simply switching into attacks too much. Pokemon that run the former two include Mudsdale, Ferroseed, and Tangela, all of which Eelektross attempts to take advantage of. While Eelektross does blanket check many special attackers, physical Pokemon like Stoutland and Aggron give it a lot of trouble. Furthermore, it is very slow, meaning it will often have to take a hit before striking back. Pokemon such as Lanturn have similarly good coverage and resistances while still serving as a slow pivot, giving Eelektross competition. Lanturn also has its own advantages such as a better typing and a higher Speed and Special Defense stat, but it has less of an offensive presence.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Eelektross can opt to run a physically oriented Assault Vest set of Drain Punch / U-Turn / Knock Off / Giga Drain. Investing in physical attack gives it greater recovery with Drain Punch and the ability to better threaten certain Fighting-weak Pokemon such as Audino and Drampa. Thunder Punch can give the set greater damage output, although it generally has less utility than other options. U-turn has no immunities, unlike Volt Switch, meaning Eelektross can gain momentum even against Pokemon like Lanturn, Torterra and Mudsdale. However, Volt Switch is still preferred on special sets due to its higher damage output. Superpower is an alternative to Drain Punch on special sets, as it hits the same targets harder but without the recovery and lowers stats. Thunderbolt can also be used in the last slot for a stronger STAB move, but the paralysis chance from Discharge is more preferable. A Substitute + Coil set turns Eelektross into a setup sweeper with a surprise factor when facing Pokemon like Mudsdale and Ferroseed, but it often relies on that surprise factor and Eelektross prefers immediate power and coverage. Leftovers can be run instead of Assault Vest for a passive form of recovery, but Eelektross loses a notable amount of bulk in the process.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Physical Pokemon like Stoutland, Kangaskhan, and Primeape can greatly weaken Eelektross due to its lack of physical bulk. Other physical attackers like Lycanroc and Dodrio can revenge kill a weakened Eelektross, but if it survives, they get KOed instead with little to no chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Eelektross is prone to being worn down throughout the match due to its lack of reliable recovery, although this is slightly redeemed by Giga Drain. Pokemon it tries to switch in on such as Ludicolo and Swanna can wear it down easily with their attacks. Swanna can also burn Eelektross with Scald, which wears it down even quicker. Eelektross can also be worn down by moves like Toxic and Leech Seed from Pokemon such as Mudsdale, Alolan Dugtrio, Ferroseed, and Tangela. It can also be worn down through indirect means such as Stealth Rock and hail.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Type: Null and Audino can use Eelektross as setup fodder or weaken it with Knock Off or Toxic. However, both have to watch out for its support moves, with Knock Off bothering them both and Acid Spray weakening the latter.</p> <p><strong>Drampa</strong>: Bar Drain Punch, Drampa takes little from all of Eelektross's moves. In return, its Choice Specs set can hit decently hard, while its Calm Mind set uses Eelektross as setup fodder. The most Eelektross can do in return is Knock Off.</p>",

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch serves as a decent STAB move while also making Eelektross a pivot, allowing it to switch out of unfavorable matchups while gaining momentum. Giga Drain serves as coverage for Ground- and certain Water-types such as Mudsdale, Gastrodon, and Lanturn. Flamethrower is the other go-to option for coverage, hitting Steel-, Grass-, and Ice-types such as Alolan Sandslash, Ferroseed, and Abomasnow. Knock Off weakens Pokemon dependent on their items like Eviolite users such as Type: Null. Acid Spray is an alternative option that allows Eelektross to more easily handle Pokemon like Oricorio-E and Gurdurr one-on-one. Drain Punch hits several targets such as Drampa, Aurorus, and Cryogonal while recovering health in the process. Finally, Discharge can be used in the last slot for the chance to paralyze the foe while being a slightly more powerful STAB option.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Since Eelektross is run as an all-out attacker, it is able to hold Assault Vest to allow it to take hits from special attackers better. A Quiet nature is run alongside Knock Off or Drain Punch so that Eelektross gets the Special Attack boost while not lowering its Attack, as well as having a slower Volt Switch than opposing Eelektross. If not running physical moves, Modest should be run instead. If running Discharge, Eelektross can opt for 19 Speed IVs and a Quiet nature to outspeed Offensive Trick Room Jellicent while Trick Room is active.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Eelektross will be using Volt Switch a lot in order to gain momentum. If you fear the opponent might switch into a Pokemon that is immune to or resists Volt Switch such as Golurk or Ferroseed, you can instead go for a coverage move or Knock Off in order to cripple them. Eelektross should be switched in to take special attacks from Pokemon like Oricorio-G and Swanna. However, it should not be your go-to switch-in for stronger special attackers like Abomasnow and Haunter, even if it can beat them one-on-one. This is because Eelektross's longevity is what allows it to switch in against weaker attacks throughout the match. Even when switching into said weaker attacks, stay wary of how easily Eelektross can be worn down. The same can be said about switching into bulky Pokemon like Mudsdale and Ferroseed, as they can further wear down Eelektross with Toxic and Leech Seed. Due to this, Eelektross is better as an early-game check for foes, but it can't always continue this later in the game. While Eelektross can switch in against various special attackers, stay away from physical attackers, as they can easily break through it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Eelektross is very easy to fit on teams. Other Pokemon with access to pivot moves such as Primeape, Alolan Persian, and Silvally-Fairy all make for good teammates. This is because they are able to build momentum alongside Eelektross. Additionally, Primeape deals with Type: Null, while Eelektross deals with Mudsdale and Flying-types like Swanna in return. Alolan Persian can restore Eelektross's health with Z-Parting Shot. It also has the perk of being physically bulky, which goes well with Eelektross's special bulk. The same can be said about other physically defensive Pokemon such as Gurdurr, Regirock, and Qwilfish. The latter two also supply entry hazard support for Eelektross, which helps put Pokemon like Victreebel in KO range and pairs well with Volt Switch. On the contrary, while Eelektross is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, Stealth Rock does its toll, so entry hazard removers like Skuntank and Hitmonchan come in handy. Since Eelektross is a special wallbreaker, physical wallbreakers like Stoutland and Kangaskhan can more easily bypass specially defensive Pokemon like Audino and Calm Mind Drampa. In exchange, Eelektross beats physical wallbreakers like Mudsdale. Stoutland can also take advantage of Toxic and Will-O-Wisp in order to boost the power of its Facade. Pokemon like Victreebel can absorb moves like Toxic and Leech Seed for Eelektross.</p>"

  "Beheeyem": {
    "overview": "<p>Beheeyem is a powerful wallbreaker thanks to its huge base Special Attack stat that is further augmented by Analytic boosting the power of Beheeyem's attacks when it moves last. Due to its access to both Trick Room and Nasty Plot, Beheeyem can effectively function versus offensive and defensive teams alike. This is furthered by Beheeyem's incredibly low Speed stat of 40, which allows it to outspeed virtually the entire tier under Trick Room and take full advantage of Analytic when outside of Trick Room. However, only passable bulk in addition to its terrible Speed stat mean that Beheeyem finds few opportunities to set up and is easily forced out by many offensive threats. This is further exacerbated by a poor defensive typing in Psychic, which bestows few useful resistances outside of Fighting. Psychic also isn't a great offensive typing to have in a tier rife with powerful Dark-types such as Skuntank and Absol and their STAB Sucker Punch. Compounding these issues, Beheeyem struggles to make room for Recover, leaving it easily worn down throughout the match and vulnerable to priority. Beheeyem also faces heavy competition from Alolan Raichu and Musharna outside of Trick Room, with Alolan Raichu having a much better Speed tier to make better use of Nasty Plot, a powerful secondary STAB move, and a more diverse movepool, while Musharna has much better bulk and makes for a more potent slow setup sweeper. Lastly, Beheeyem faces competition as a dedicated Trick Room special sweeper from Pokemon with better offensive and defensive typings such as Wishiwashi and Drampa, who hit harder and have better bulk, though neither have access to Trick Room themselves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunderbolt is a decently powerful coverage move that hits many Psychic-resistant Pokemon for neutral damage, but it often does not hit hard enough to justify its usage over other coverage moves that can hit checks super effectively. A bulky Nasty Plot set with maximum HP and Defense investment and a Colbur Berry can function as an effective wallbreaker; while certainly devastating against slower, bulkier teams, it struggles to find opportunities to set up against offense and is easily revenge killed. Choice Specs turns Beheeyem into an immediately devastating breaker, but this set suffers from an abysmal offense matchup while being easy to revenge kill, especially with Dark-types such as Spiritomb and Skuntank exploiting Beheeyem's STAB attack and trapping with Pursuit in turn. Leftovers can also be run over Colbur Berry or Psychium Z in order to offset chip damage and function better against more defensive teams, but fares more poorly against other archetypes where Dark-type attacks are of more concern.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Skuntank and Shiftry are immune to Psychic-type moves and force Beheeyem into mind games while they are still present on the opposing team and potentially waste Trick Room turns in the process. Spiritomb and Skuntank's typing in particular allows them to switch into Beheeyem's STAB and coverage moves while trapping Beheeyem with Pursuit or picking it off with Sucker Punch. Spiritomb particularly stands out for being able to take a +2 Analytic-boosted Signal Beam, but it should be noted that the other Dark-types in the tier that take neutral damage from Bug-type moves such as Sableye and Skuntank aren't bulky enough to stomach an +2 Analytic-boosted Signal Beam.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-type Pokemon such as Probopass and Aggron resist Beheeyem's STAB move and only really fear +2 Shattered Psyche or Hidden Power Ground. Bronzor deserves a special mention for being immune to Hidden Power Ground and 4x resisting Beheeyem's STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: The second Trick Room turns are over, Beheeyem is phenomenally easy to revenge kill due to its abysmal Speed stat, with Pokemon such as Skuntank, Jellicent, Oricorio-G, and Aggron all dealing very heavy damage to it or outright OHKOing it. It should be noted, however, that a select few Pokemon have even worse Speed than Beheeyem, such as minimum Speed Drampa and Wishiwashi, and can outspeed and KO it while under Trick Room, but they are uncommon outside of opposing Trick Room teams.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Powerful priority moves from Pokemon such as Alolan Raticate, Kangaskhan, Spiritomb, Shiftry, and Skuntank can revenge kill Beheeyem with little to no chip damage even while Trick Room is up. Kangaskhan in particular can waste a turn with Fake Out and KO Beheeyem with Sucker Punch after some chip damage. If running Colbur Berry, however, Beheeyem can effectively take a hit and eliminate all of these Pokemon sans Kangaskhan and Shadow Sneak Spiritomb.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room allows Beheeyem to take advantage of its terrible Speed stat and attempt to sweep. Under Trick Room, it outspeeds virtually the entire tier. Psychic is Beheeyem's STAB attack of choice, dealing heavy damage to anything that doesn't resist it and outright OHKOing many frailer offensive Pokemon. Psyshock is an alternative option that deals significantly more damage to specially defensive Pokemon such as Clefairy and Eelektross at the cost of not OHKOing offensive Pokemon such as Pinsir after Stealth Rock damage when unboosted, which can potentially OHKO it in return. Psyshock also slightly weakens the power of Shattered Psyche, which means it has no chance to OHKO Type: Null after Stealth Rock damage even at +2, while Shattered Psyche from Psychic does. Nasty Plot boosts Beheeyem's Special Attack to absurd levels, allowing it to break specially defensive walls such as Audino with ease, especially if running Psyshock. Signal Beam allows Beheeyem to hit the Dark- and Psychic-types such as Musharna and Absol that would be able to stomach a Psychic. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ground hits Skuntank and Steel-types such as Aggron and Probopass. It should be noted, however, that Skuntank already falls to an Analytic-boosted +2 Signal Beam; nonetheless, Hidden Power Ground is a much more threatening option against it when unboosted.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment and a Quiet nature maximize Beheeyem's offensive presence while minimizing Speed, which allows Beheeyem to outspeed as much as possible under Trick Room, while maximum HP investment increases Beheeyem's mixed bulk and makes setting up slightly easier as a result. Psychium Z powers up Psychic or Psyshock into Shattered Psyche, which is incredibly powerful at +2, having a chance to KO some bulky Psychic resistant foes such as Alolan Sandslash and Probopass with an Analytic boost or some prior chip damage and otherwise handily OHKOing virtually anything that doesn't resist. Psychium Z also weakens Knock Off due to Beheeyem's item being unable to be removed, which is useful for revenge killing certain Pokemon such as +1 Gurdurr. Colbur Berry is an alternative option that allows Beheeyem easier setup against Dark-types and acts as a one-time insurance against Pursuit trapping or Sucker Punch. It also lures Skuntank, allowing Beheeyem to take a Dark-type move and then retaliate with either Hidden Power Ground or Signal Beam, the former of which will always OHKO at +2, while the latter which deals heavy damage at +2 and can OHKO with some chip. Analytic punishes switching, dealing heavier damage than usual to potential switch-ins.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Going for a Trick Room sweep while Beheeyem's counters are still healthy is a waste of time. While Beheeyem can punch holes in the opponent's team early-game, its HP should be conserved to maximize the chance of using Trick Room and sweeping unless it is paired with a Healing Wish user such as Audino or Musharna; in this case, it can be used as a de-facto wallbreaker until it is required to sweep. Due to this, focus on wearing down and KOing Pokemon such as Spiritomb and Skuntank in order to facilitate a sweep. Later in the game when these checks and counters are weakened or eliminated, going for the sweep with Trick Room is the way to go. Emphasize on eliminating Dark-types, as they prevent Beheeyem from spamming its STAB Psychic and waste valuable Trick Room turns in the process. The choice of whether to use Nasty Plot or Trick Room first depends on the situation. Nasty Plot, if used before Trick Room, gives Beheeyem one more turn to attack under Trick Room. However, using Trick Room first gives Beheeyem more flexibility in choosing whether to attack or boost, which is more advantageous against more offensive teams where a Nasty Plot boost may not be required to sweep. Bring Beheeyem in with a slow pivot or after a teammate has been sacrificed, as it needs as much HP as possible to pull off the two-turn setup of Trick Room and Nasty Plot. Beheeyem can take advantage of passive Pokemon such as defensive Hitmonchan, Audino, and Clefairy and set up on them, as it is not immediately threatened by any of their offensive options. It should be wary of Toxic from these Pokemon, however, as the residual poison damage can easily cut the sweep short. Lastly, make sure to save the Z-Move for Beheeyem's checks or counters, as Beheeyem hits plenty hard enough at +2 to KO neutral targets.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>If running a dedicated Trick Room team, Trick Room setters such as Carbink and Audino are important teammates, as they can set Trick Room for Beheeyem, which allows it to set up or threaten the opposing team without wasting a turn and precious HP on setting Trick Room, with Carbink's Stealth Rock chipping targets such as Gurdurr into guaranteed OHKO range and Audino's Healing Wish granting Beheeyem a safe switch-in and another chance to set up after being worn down. However, Beheeyem can still function as a self-sufficient offensive Trick Room sweeper on more traditional builds. Having another slow, powerful Pokemon to take advantage of Trick Room, such as Crabominable or Wishiwashi, is nice to have in the situation that Beheeyem is forced out with Trick Room still active. Crabominable in particular breaks through most of Beheeyem's counters while Beheeyem does the same for it in turn, with Crabominable easily taking out Dark- and Steel-types such as Skuntank and Aggron, and Beheeyem steamrolling Poison- and Psychic-types such as Qwilfish, Victreebel, and Musharna if it has Signal Beam. Skuntank and Spiritomb trap Psychic- and Ghost-types that would otherwise annoy Beheeyem and ease the need to run Signal Beam, opening Beheeyem up to running Hidden Power Ground. Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Primeape handle the Dark-types that Beheeyem would enjoy having removed before a sweep while also beating down Steel-types such as Aggron and Probopass. Gurdurr also uses the Dark-types that Beheeyem lures in as setup fodder. Beheeyem supports them in turn by beating down checks and counters such as Musharna and Clefairy. Entry hazards from Pokemon such as Qwilfish, Regirock, and Carbink are very useful in order help put checks into KO range for Beheeyem. Silvally-Fairy checks Dark-types, provides Defog support, and helps bring Beheeyem in more safely with Parting Shot.</p>"

  "Cryogonal": {
    "overview": "<p>Cryogonal stands out from other Rapid Spin users thanks to its combination of an excellent Speed tier, good offensive typing, and decent utility, which lends it a better matchup against common spinblockers such as Jellicent, Golurk, and Oricorio-G. It is also notable for being the fastest entry hazard remover in the metagame as well as being the only spinner with access to reliable recovery, which improves its chances of removing hazards repeatedly. Cryogonal's Speed and good offensive typing give it a notable offensive presence, and it even performs well as a specially defensive wall that can check prevalent special attackers such as Victreebel and Aurorus. However, Cryogonal's low Defense stat and poor defensive typing make it vulnerable to the majority of physical attacks, including Pursuit, as well as Stealth Rock. As a spinner, it faces competition from Alolan Sandslash and Hitmonchan, whose superior Defense stats, better defensive typing, and lack of weakness to Stealth Rock grant them more opportunities to switch in. It also faces competition from Articuno as a specially defensive wall and offensive threat due to its part Flying typing, access to Heal Bell, and better offensive moveset.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cryogonal can utilize additional utility moves such as Knock Off, which cripples Assault Vest users like Eelektross and Eviolite users like Bronzor as they switch in, as well as Protect, which can be used to scout against Choice-locked Pursuit users such as Dodrio and Stoutland as well as to protect itself from Z-Move users such as Alolan Persian. However, Cryogonal struggles to fit either over important coverage or generally more useful utility in Toxic. Offensive variants can use Water Pulse or Hidden Power Ground to check Simisear in a pinch at the expense of Hidden Power Fire's superior coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Gurdurr, Hitmonchan, and Primeape pose a serious threat to Cryogonal. The former two take very little damage from any of Cryogonal's attacks and can use it to replenish their health with Drain Punch, while the latter, which often runs Choice Scarf, can outspeed and KO Cryogonal easily or gain momentum with U-turn. Gurdurr can even benefit from getting hit with Toxic, as it activates its Guts ability.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types like Regirock and Lycanroc can easily check Cryogonal, as Regirock dislikes Toxic but takes very little damage from any of Cryogonal's attacks, Lycanroc naturally outspeeds it and can easily set up Swords Dance on forced switches, and both can OHKO Cryogonal with Stone Edge. Carracosta, Kabutops, and Aggron are other Rock-types that can take out Cryogonal, although the former two have to watch out for Freeze-Dry while the latter fears Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Simisear takes little damage from any of Cryogonal's moves, allowing it to set up Nasty Plot in its face and take it out with Fire Blast. Combusken can also take advantage of Cryogonal's lack of super effective coverage. Both dislike getting hit by Toxic, however.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferroseed is notable for being able to threaten Cryogonal with an OHKO from Gyro Ball, as well as for walling any variant that chooses not to run Hidden Power Fire. Alolan Dugtrio, as well as Alolan Sandslash under hail, can outspeed Cryogonal and take it out with Iron Head. None of them appreciates being hit by Hidden Power Fire while switching in, however, while Alolan Dugtrio also takes a big dent from Cryogonal's Ice-type moves. Bronzor is a near-perfect counter to Cryogonal, although Metronome Hidden Power Fire sets can give it some trouble.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Even when it isn't necessarily at a type matchup disadvantage, Cryogonal can't stay in on offensive threats such as Stoutland and Dodrio, which can easily OHKO it with their STAB attacks if Cryogonal has taken Stealth Rock damage. Power-Up Punch Kangaskhan can use Cryogonal as setup fodder, and Pursuit trappers such as Skuntank can take more than half of Cryogonal's HP if it switches out.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic damage severely limits Cryogonal's ability to remove entry hazards repeatedly and function as a wall. The majority of offensively oriented teams that feature Cryogonal lack a cleric to bring it back to good health.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog can be used over Rapid Spin on non-entry hazard stacking teams, as it gives Cryogonal more opportunities to remove entry hazards. Freeze-Dry takes precedence over Frost Breath as Cryogonal's STAB move of choice, as it allows Cryogonal to deal with Water-types like Jellicent, Lanturn, and Ludicolo while retaining enough power to pressure Calm Mind variants of Oricorio-E and Oricorio-G. Hidden Power Fire lets Cryogonal threaten Ferroseed, which otherwise walls it, as well as Alolan Sandslash and Rotom-F. Hidden Power Fighting is an option that lets Cryogonal deal better damage to Aurorus and Aggron while still hitting Alolan Sandslash, but it leaves Cryogonal walled by Ferroseed and Bronzor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Icium Z lets Cryogonal OHKO Oricorio-E and Oricorio-G after a Calm Mind boost, as well as take out targets like Mudsdale, Lurantis, and Absol from full health and Skuntank and Stoutland after slight chip damage. If the team already has a Z-Move user, Metronome can be used to further increase Cryogonal's cleaning potential, given that very few Pokemon can take a boosted Freeze-Dry comfortably, as well as its ability to pressure Pokemon that might attempt to switch in and wall it, such as Musharna and Bronzor. Alternatively, Icicle Plate's consistent power boost to Freeze-Dry can be used to check targets like Lanturn and Jellicent more reliably.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cryogonal works well early-game, when it can utilize its good offensive prowess to threaten entry hazard setters such as Torterra, Mudsdale, and Qwilfish and find entry hazard removal opportunities against foes that it forces out such as Jellicent and Oricorio-G. Cryogonal's special bulk is respectable even when uninvested, allowing it to switch into threats like Oricorio-E, Jellicent, and Lanturn and giving it more opportunities to wallbreak. However, pivoting into these threats shouldn't be its main purpose, and it also shouldn't be brought in against stronger special attackers like Drampa or foes with physical coverage moves that can lure it in and KO it, such as Victreebel and Abomasnow. Cryogonal can also attempt to conceal the fact that it's offensive and preserve its Z-Move to take out Pursuit trappers such as Skuntank, Absol, and Stoutland that usually force it out. It should do so when its health is full, however, as the lack of Leftovers recovery can give away the set. Icium Z can similarly be used to take out or heavily damage predicted switch-ins that would normally counter Cryogonal, such as Gurdurr, Eelektross, and Regirock. Metronome's surprise factor can be utilized against foes that normally wall Cryogonal such as Bronzor, which will likely attempt to set up Stealth Rock once it sees Hidden Power Fire's low initial damage output.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard setters such as Qwilfish, Ferroseed, Mudsdale, and Regirock assist Cryogonal by pressuring Pokemon that it struggles with such as Kangaskhan and Lycanroc, with Qwilfish also being able to switch into Gurdurr and Regirock alleviating Cryogonal's pressure of checking Oricorio-E. In return, all of them appreciate Cryogonal dealing with Jellicent and Lanturn and revenge killing Torterra, Lurantis, and Victreebel. Kangaskhan and Combusken can offensively check Simisear, weaken Eelektross and Metang, and pressure mutual targets like Victreebel and Alolan Sandslash. Both appreciate Cryogonal supporting them with entry hazard removal and eliminating targets that they struggle to break through, such as Mudsdale, Jellicent, Lanturn, and Altaria. Jellicent and Victreebel can provide Cryogonal with a solid defensive backbone, as they are able to handle Fighting-types like Gurdurr and Primeape as well as cripple Rock-types that Cryogonal struggles to break through such as Regirock and Carbink. Jellicent is also capable of switching into Combusken and Alolan Sandslash and can even function as a spinblocker on entry hazard stacking teams. In return, Cryogonal can check Oricorio-E and Oricorio-G for them. Lanturn and Primeape can create opportunities for Cryogonal to wallbreak or remove entry hazards by bringing it in on Pokemon like Jellicent, Mudsdale, and Eelektross, with the former also checking Fire-types like Combusken and non-Grassium Z Simisear and curing Cryogonal of status with Heal Bell and the latter revenge killing Absol and Alolan Raichu. Swords Dance Silvally-Fairy is also notable for being able to pressure Musharna, Gurdurr, and Hitmonchan and benefiting from entry hazard removal provided by Cryogonal. Skuntank greatly assists Cryogonal by threatening and Pursuit trapping bulky Psychic-types such as Musharna, Metang, and Bronzor and weakening other targets such as Stoutland, Silvally-Fairy, and opposing Cryogonal.</p>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog may be used in place of Rapid Spin as an unblockable means of entry hazard removal if keeping your own hazards up is of lesser concern. Frost Breath is Cryogonal's STAB move of choice, as the guaranteed critical hits help it break through Calm Mind and Quiver Dance users such as Oricorio-E, Oricorio-G, and Bellossom as well as other targets that are weak to Ice like Victreebel and Golurk. Freeze-Dry is an alternative STAB move that sacrifices power and setup pressure to OHKO Water-types like Swanna and Ludicolo and pressure others like Qwilfish, Jellicent, and Lanturn. Hidden Power Fire allows Cryogonal to 2HKO Ferroseed, as it takes virtually nothing from Cryogonal's other attacks, as well as Alolan Sandslash. Hidden Power Fighting can be used to target Aurorus and Aggron while still hitting Alolan Sandslash but misses out on Ferroseed. Toxic can be used over Hidden Power to cripple switch-ins such as Eelektross as well as walls like Regirock and Jellicent.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>200 Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Cryogonal to remove entry hazards quickly, often before it takes any hit, and outspeed Swanna, Oricorio-E, and Oricorio-G. 8 Special Attack investment guarantees Cryogonal can 2HKO specially defensive Alolan Sandslash with Hidden Power Fire after Stealth Rock. The remainder of EVs are invested into HP and Special Defense to further improve Cryogonal's special bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cryogonal should preferably target Pokemon that don't threaten it with physical attacks or Toxic, such as Aurorus and Oricorio-E, so it can remove entry hazards safely. Its high Special Defense can be utilized to counter special attackers that don't pose a threat to it, such as Victreebel and Oricorio-G, as well as hazard setters like Qwilfish and Omastar. Although Cryogonal's offensive prowess isn't great without investment in Special Attack, its nearly unresisted Ice + Fire or Fighting coverage can be a nuisance for many teams and thus should be used to chip predicted switch-ins. Toxic should be used against setters such as Regirock, which can otherwise easily set Stealth Rock repeatedly against Cryogonal.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cryogonal fits well on entry hazard stacking teams that appreciate its fast Rapid Spin, thus making it a natural partner to Spikes and Toxic Spikes setters such as Qwilfish, Ferroseed, and Roselia as well as spinblockers such as Golurk and Jellicent. Thanks to its excellent special bulk, it can act as a backbone for specially frail team members like Dodrio, Victreebel, and Haunter. Due to its physical frailty, and in particular its weakness to common Fighting-type Pokemon, Fighting-type checks like Tangela, Oricorio-E, and Mudsdale as well as Normal-type checks like Gurdurr and Regirock make good partners. Gurdurr in particular stands out as an excellent partner to Cryogonal, checking most Fighting- and Rock-types that threaten Cryogonal and absorbing incoming Toxic from walls, while in return Cryogonal can deal with Gurdurr's biggest threats in the form of Victreebel and Oricorio-E. Lanturn is also a great option, as aside from checking many similar targets, Cryogonal can check Ground-types like Mudsdale that threaten Lanturn, while in return Lanturn can check Fire-types and cure Cryogonal of any status condition with Heal Bell. Lastly, stallbreakers like Kangaskhan and Stoutland can greatly help non-Toxic Cryogonal against stall while also greatly benefitting from hazard stacking thanks to the multitude of switches they can force from the opposing team.</p>"

  "Stunfisk": {
    "overview": "<p>A decent and unique defensive typing along with fairly good stats allows Stunfisk to act as a check to several offensive threats like Skuntank, Dodrio, Lycanroc, Aggron, and Scyther. Access to Stealth Rock allows Stunfisk to also provide entry hazard support, slowly chipping away at the opposing team. Static is also a good ability for a defensive Pokemon, spreading paralysis to further help out teammates. However, lack of reliable recovery is unhelpful for a defensive Pokemon like Stunfisk and leaves it open to being worn down quickly by status and chip damage. Its typing, while being great for checking many physical threats, unfortunately leaves Stunfisk weak to predominately specially based types like Ice, Grass, and Water from Pokemon such as Jellicent and Aurorus as well as giving it a weakness to Earthquake and other Ground-type attacks including those from the likes of Mudsdale and Kangaskhan. Stunfisk also faces heavy competition from other Stealth Rock setters, mainly Mudsdale, which can check most of the same Pokemon and has better overall utility.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Scald can be used to spread burns instead of paralysis, though it lacks the ability to wear down threats as much as Toxic and doesn't cripple special attackers as much as paralysis. An offensive set with Sludge Wave and Scald can be used with Choice Specs as a lure, but other than surprise factor, it is greatly outclassed by other special attackers. Rocky Helmet can be used to further punish physical attackers, but the passive recovery of Leftovers is hard to pass up on, as it is Stunfisk's only form of recovery outside of Rest.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Jellicent, Aurorus, and Omastar can all threaten Stunfisk with their STAB attacks, though Stunfisk threatens them all with paralysis if they switch in.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Pokemon like Torterra and Mudsdale are immune to Stunfisk's Discharge and can easily threaten it with strong Earthquakes.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Victreebel and Lurantis, while annoyed by paralysis, aren't threatened by either of Stunfisk's STAB moves and can either threaten it or use the opportunity to set up or Defog, respectively. Roselia also doesn't mind Stunfisk and can set up Spikes on it, damage it with Giga Drain, and utilize Natural Cure to get rid of paralysis. The aforementioned Torterra is especially notable, as it not only is able to set up on Stunfisk but can also avoid paralysis thanks to its immunity to Discharge and access to Earthquake to bypass Static.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Drampa and Gurdurr can set up on Stunfisk if not running Toxic and proceed to start a sweep.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Spikes, Stealth Rock, and general chip damage from switching into attacks can limit Stunfisk's survivability during a game and can eventually leave it threatened by Pokemon that it is supposed to check.</p>",

      "Defensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Discharge is used to hit Flying-type foes like Oricorio-G and Swanna that may be tempted to either set up or remove Stealth Rock right away with Defog. It also helps spread paralysis if the foe doesn't make contact. Earth Power is useful for beating many of the Pokemon that Stunfisk checks like Skuntank and Lycanroc as well as opposing Stealth Rock setters like Regirock and Aggron. Toxic helps wear down bulkier Pokemon like Mudsdale and Assault Vest Lanturn, and Pokemon like Eelektross and Rotom-F that resist or are immune to Stunfisk's STAB attacks. Protect is an option to scout Choice-locked foes like Choice Specs Jellicent and Choice Scarf Abomasnow and better assess what to switch in while also healing more with Leftovers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers gives Stunfisk passive recovery and allows it to stay in and check more foes. Static is Stunfisk's most viable ability, having a chance to paralyze Pokemon that make contact. A physically defensive spread works best with Stunfisk's typing, as many of the types that it resists are primarily physically based such as Flying and Rock, while most types that it's weak to are primarily specially based like Ice and Water.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Stunfisk is best switched in on attackers that can't do much damage to it and are threatened by paralysis like Scyther. It can then use this pressure to set up Stealth Rock. It is used as a physical sponge with its decent resistances and should be kept healthy so it can check Pokemon like Dodrio. Stunfisk should avoid switching into status, especially Toxic, that can wear it down. Stunfisk should usually use Discharge, as paralysis can be detrimental to almost anything in the metagame by slowing it down. Protect should be used to scout the opponent's moves and can also be used to stall out field effects like rain and Trick Room. Toxic should be used when the opponent has Pokemon that don't mind being paralyzed. Assault Vest Crabominable and Audino are much more threatened by poison.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Specially defensive Pokemon that can tank attacks from Jellicent and Aurorus help Stunfisk remain able to check physical threats. Lanturn, Articuno, and specially defensive Alolan Sandslash are all good examples of this and appreciate Stunfisk's ability to check physical Pokemon like Primeape. Clerics like Lanturn, Altaria, and Audino help Stunfisk stay healthy via Heal Bell, with Audino in particular providing great Wish support. Strong attackers like Choice Specs Jellicent and Stoutland appreciate Stunfisk's ability to slow down faster threats. Scyther in particular appreciates the Rock-type resistance and Electric-type immunity that Stunfisk provides, while Stunfisk appreciates a good Grass-type check. Roselia is a great partner for Stunfisk, checking Water- and Grass-types like Jellicent while also providing Spikes support to form an entry hazard stacking core. In return, Stunfisk also checks physical attackers like Skuntank that threaten Roselia.</p>"

  "Golurk": {
    "overview": "<p>Golurk carves a niche in the PU tier due to its solid offensive typing, stellar Attack stat, great coverage options bolstered by Iron Fist, and immunity to moves like Rapid Spin and Volt Switch. Golurk's typing also allows it to block Fighting- and Electric-type attacks from common threats such as Primeape and Alolan Raichu. These attributes allow Golurk to pressure common entry hazard setters and removers such as Aggron, Regirock, Skuntank, and Hitmonchan, making it an effective user of Stealth Rock. Despite its offensive prowess, Golurk struggles to break through bulky walls such as Gurdurr and Tangela. Golurk's mediocre Speed stat also leaves it outsped by common threats such as Victreebel and Rotom-F. Additionally, being weak to common types such as Ice, Grass, and Water makes revenge killing and forcing out Golurk much easier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Band can be used to make Golurk a wallbreaker; however, Golurk prefers not to be Choice-locked because being locked into Earthquake gives free setup opportunities to Pokemon like Oricorio-E. Passho Berry and Yache Berry are alternatives to Colbur Berry that can be used in conjunction with Stone Edge to safely exchange with Pokemon like Swanna and Articuno in order to preserve Stealth Rock. Lum Berry is another option that gives Golurk a temporary shield from Toxic and Will-O-Wisp. However, Golurk typically prefers Colbur Berry to take on Dark-types like Absol and Skuntank. A Rock Polish set can patch up Golurk's mediocre Speed in order to make it more of a threatening sweeper, but finding setup opportunities is difficult and it faces heavy competition from Torterra. Lastly, Dynamic Punch can be used with No Guard because it's a spammable coverage attack that disrupts foes, but Golurk's other coverage moves are made considerably weaker without Iron Fist.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Eelektross, Oricorio-G, and Haunter can switch into Golurk's Earthquake. Swanna, Haunter, and Oricorio-G threaten to OHKO Golurk with slight chip damage, while Eelektross can 2HKO it with Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Floatzel, Ludicolo and Swanna pressure Golurk with their respective STAB attacks. Floatzel can usually set up freely with Bulk Up, while Swanna removes entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Lurantis can freely switch in against Golurk's STAB attacks and pressure it with Leaf Storm or clear its entry hazards away with Defog. Shiftry is faster and can threaten Golurk out with its dual STAB moves, remove entry hazards, or set up Swords Dance. Abomasnow can also outspeed Adamant Golurk, force it out with its STAB moves, set up freely with Swords Dance, or pick off a weakened Jolly Golurk with Ice Shard, but none of the aforementioned Pokemon want to switch into an Ice Punch. Tangela is also notable, as even Ice Punch does a pitiful amount of damage to it, and it's able to retaliate with Giga Drain or Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Aurorus, Rotom-F, and Jynx all obliterate Golurk with their respective Ice-type STAB moves. Rotom-F's immunity to Earthquake and resistance to Ice Punch also means it can often directly switch in.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Golurk's poor Speed and merely okay defenses leave it easily overwhelmed by powerful attackers like Stoutland and Dodrio.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Punch allows Golurk to hit Grass- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Torterra, Oricorio-E, and Scyther. Drain Punch is an alternative over Shadow Punch that is boosted by Iron Fist and provides a method of recovery, especially against bulky targets like Audino.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature gives Golurk extra power, while a Jolly nature allows it to outspeed threats such as Modest Aurorus and Jolly Aggron. Colbur Berry is used to endure Dark-type attacks, allowing Golurk to pressure Defog users like Skuntank. Lastly, Iron Fist is the preferred ability over No Guard because it makes Ice Punch, Drain Punch, and Shadow Punch a bit stronger.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Generally, unless you predict the opponent to switch into Pokemon that are immune or resistant to Ground, Golurk should spam its STAB Earthquake or set up Stealth Rock. An effective way for Golurk to set up Stealth Rock is on passive Pokemon such as Clefairy and Regirock. Additionally, be sure to take advantage of Golurk's capabilities of spinblocking by bringing it in on predicted Rapid Spins from Pokemon such as Hitmonchan. Golurk can additionally use its resistances to Rock- and Poison-type moves to switch into Pokemon like unboosted Lycanroc and Choice-locked Skuntank; however, Golurk's only passable bulk and limited recovery options means that it should switch into such Pokemon sparingly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Golurk fits on offensive teams because it's a Stealth Rock user that can still apply immediate offensive pressure itself. Fighting-type Pokemon such as Primeape and Hitmonchan also make good partners because they deal with Dark-types such as Absol and Alolan Persian. Primeape provides momentum with U-turn, while Assault Vest Hitmonchan checks special attackers such as Aurorus; in return, Golurk can check Psychic-type Pokemon like Claydol and Musharna for the latter. Lanturn pairs well with Golurk because it can check special attackers such as Rotom-F, Floatzel and Swanna while being able to provide Heal Bell and Volt Switch support. Lastly, wallbreakers such as Simisear and Alolan Raichu make for good teammates because they pressure bulky walls like Tangela and Gurdurr while also appreciating the Stealth Rock support Golurk provides.</p>"

  "Pawniard": {
    "overview": "<p>Pawniard has a unique typing that allows it to hit almost the entire metagame for neutral damage and serve as a switch-in to a decent number of Pokemon such as physical Skuntank and Sableye. Defiant allows Pawniard to take advantage of Defog and other stat-lowering moves, which furthers its ability to switch into physical Skuntank and other Defog users, though it struggles against many other common Defog users such as Swanna and Silvally-Fairy, which can 2HKO it if they can predict a switch. It also has a good movepool, with access to Knock Off, priority in the form of Sucker Punch, and Swords Dance, which gives it a form of setup. These moves allow Pawniard to serve as a decent wallbreaker and sweeper. However, Pawniard's stats can be overall very underwhelming, including its Attack, which often requires a Swords Dance boost to break through many foes. Its bulk is mediocre even with Eviolite, and especially without, leaving it struggling to switch into even resisted hits from foes such as Oricorio-G and Haunter too many times. Finally, Pawniardâ€™s low Speed often hinders it when sweeping, although its access to Sucker Punch can somewhat make up for that. Fighting-types give Pawniard a lot of trouble and can put a stop to its sweep with relative ease, with many having higher Speed or access to Mach Punch. Bulky Ground-types also concern Pawniard, as they can take hits before OHKOing in return. It also receives a good amount of competition from other Swords Dance users such as Alolan Raticate and Absol due to their higher Attack and Speed stats. Nonetheless, Pawniard maintains its niche with its great ability in Defiant and a unique typing with some nice coverage and resistances.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Pawniard can hold a Life Orb for more damage output but prefers Eviolite due to its lackluster natural defenses, and without it, setting up and sweeping is immensely more difficult. Pursuit can help trap Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Oricorio-G and Jynx and leads to mind games when combined with Sucker Punch. Low Kick can hit Steel-types such as Aggron and Probopass for super effective damage but has little usage outside of that, so it is overall very situational. Stealth Rock can be run over Swords Dance if your team needs the support, but it leads to Pawniard struggling much more to wallbreak and sweep. Substitute makes Pawniard immune to status conditions, allowing it to use physical Spiritomb as setup fodder, and also makes it more difficult to revenge kill. Taunt is another option for stopping Will-O-Wisp and can also be used to disable certain other moves such as Type: Null's Rest and Swords Dance. However, both Substitute and Taunt take up a moveslot that can be better utilized. Finally, Magnet Rise is a very situational option that gives Pawniard a much better matchup against Pokemon such as Probopass and Torterra.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types and Fighting Coverage</strong>: Fighting-types such as Primeape, Hitmonchan, and Gurdurr can OHKO Pawniard with their respective STAB moves. The former also outspeeds Pawniard, while the latter two have Mach Punch, and they all resist Sucker Punch. Pokemon such as Stoutland and Cryogonal can also carry Fighting-type coverage, although Cryogonal has to play more carefully around Sucker Punch due to its lacking Defense.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types such as Gastrodon, Mudsdale, and Torterra can take any hit from Pawniard and OHKO it in return. Alolan Dugtrio can bait out Sucker Punch and set up a Substitute to safely pick up the KO, but it cannot take +2 Sucker Punch otherwise. Colbur Berry Claydol can take +2 Sucker Punch and OHKO Pawniard with Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Faster Will-O-Wisp users such as Haunter and Gourgeist-S can heavily cripple Pawniard without the fear of Sucker Punch. However, neither appreciates taking +2 Knock Off, even from a burned Pawniard, which still OHKOes Haunter. Bulkier Will-O-Wisp users such as Colbur Berry Gourgeist-XL can safely take a hit before crippling Pawniard.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: If they can take +2 Sucker Punch, faster Pokemon such as special Skuntank and Timid Aurorus can come in against Pawniard and OHKO it. However, all fear having taken too much prior damage and Timid Aurorus must stay wary of Jolly Pawniard. Certain other Pokemon such as Silvally-Fairy and Alolan Persian can serve as revenge killers but require a good amount of prior damage on Pawniard to KO it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Aggron and Probopass can take a hit from Pawniard and OHKO with Earthquake and Earth Power, although they take a good amount of damage from Knock Off in the process. Alolan Sandslash outspeeds Pawniard and can OHKO it with Earthquake if holding a Life Orb.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off serves as Pawniardâ€™s main STAB move and can also be used to cripple Pokemon by removing items such as Ferroseed's Eviolite and Gastrodon's Leftovers. Sucker Punch provides priority, which allows Pawniard to hit faster foes such as Swanna and Alolan Raichu and more easily sweep through weakened teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature is an alternative option to an Adamant nature that enables Pawniard to outspeed certain Pokemon such as Timid Aurorus and Jolly Golurk. However, this is at the cost of the preferred power. Defiant is Pawniard's only good ability, as it lets Pawniard take advantage of Defog users such as physical Skuntank and other stat-lowering moves such as Alolan Persianâ€™s Parting Shot. Eviolite gives Pawniard some bulk that allows it to more easily switch in and potentially set up on Pokemon like Choice Scarf Shiftry.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pawniard serves as an average wallbreaker that can defeat walls such as Type: Null and Sableye, which allows teammates to more easily clean up after it. Pawniard often scares out many of these walls, as they can do little in return, which it can use as an opportunity to set up a Swords Dance. This can also be accomplished against Pokemon it resists moves from. Pawniard can also utilize Swords Dance along with Sucker Punch to serve as a late-game sweeper. In this instance, it prefers to have its threats such as Primeape and Gurdurr taken out beforehand, as they can stop it from sweeping. However, Pawniard can lure these foes in early-game and take advantage of Knock Off to remove their items and cripple them. Pawniard should be switched in against a predicted move such as Skuntank's Defog or Silvally-Ghost's Parting Shot in order to activate Defiant. This leads to opponents having to decide between the risk of activating Pawniard's Defiant or leaving the entry hazards. However, be wary that the opponent may instead go for an attack or switch into a better matchup in attempt to take out Pawniard. This can be accomplished by opponents relatively easily, too, due to Pawniard's low defenses. It is because of this that Pawniard often prefers to be brought onto the field without having to take a hit, ideally after a teammate has been KOed or through a slow pivot such as Lanturn's Volt Switch. If you're using Sucker Punch, the opponent may take advantage of it to set up a Substitute, so watch out for Substitute users such as Alolan Dugtrio. Finally, if Pawniard shows little threat to the opposing team, it can be used to take out a specific foe such as Oricorio-G or Sableye before being sacrificed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Special wallbreakers such as Aurorus and Drampa can help break down physically bulky Pokemon such as Tangela, while Pawniard can help against specially bulky Pokemon such as Clefairy and Audino. Both can also take Will-O-Wisps for Pawniard. Faster Pokemon such as Lycanroc and Floatzel also benefit from Pawniard's wallbreaking, as it allows them to more easily come in and clean up the match. They can also help against faster threats for Pawniard such as Simisear. Fighting-types can stop Pawniard in its tracks with relative ease, so Fighting checks such as Swanna, Oricorio-G, and Silvally-Fairy are vital. Swanna can also help against Ground-types, as can other Ground checks such as Eelektross and Gastrodon. Hazard setters such as Regirock, Golurk, Smeargle, and Shuckle also benefit from Pawniardâ€™s Defiant. Furthermore, Stealth Rock allows Pawniard to OHKO Pokemon such as Simisear with +2 Sucker Punch, while Sticky Web can help against faster threats such as Stoutland. Furthermore, Ghost-types can form a core with Pawniard that punishes both forms of hazard removal.</p>"

  "Bouffalant": {
    "overview": "<p>Bouffalant carves a small niche in PU thanks to its solid bulk, high base Attack, and access to Sap Sipper, giving it opportunities to set up on Pokemon like Clefairy, break down balance teams, and blanket check Grass-type Pokemon like Tangela and Victreebel. However, Bouffalant faces heavy competition from other Normal-type wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Kangaskhan, which are stronger, are faster, and can threaten the Ghost-types Bouffalant struggles against. Dodrio and Alolan Raticate also serve as better offensive Swords Dance users, while Type: Null and Drampa have better bulk and access to reliable recovery. Additionally, Bouffalant tends to be complete setup bait for Ghost-types like Oricorio-G and Haunter and struggles against prevalent Ghost-types like Sableye and Jellicent. Furthermore, Bouffalant lacks reliable recovery, meaning it can be worn down quickly between entry hazards and losing HP from setting up Substitute. Its low Speed also means that it will have to take a hit before firing off an attack or setting up a Substitute. Lastly, Bouffalant's Normal typing leaves it with almost no resistances other than an immunity to Grass thanks to Sap Sipper and leaves it weak to common Fighting-types and strong physical attackers that carry super effective coverage moves like Gurdurr, Primeape, Absol, and Aggron.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An Assault Vest set with Pursuit is an option for allowing Bouffalant to check and Pursuit trap special attackers like Oricorio-G, Haunter, and Jynx, but this set comes with a notable lack of power and faces competition from Stoutland and Kangaskhan. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 156 Atk / 100 Spe can be run to give Bouffalant more immediate power, but it prefers 156 EVs in Special Defense to check special attackers better. While unorthodox, Cotton Guard boosts Bouffalant's Defense, allowing it to set up more easily on physical attackers such as Kangaskhan and Kabutops and act as a bulky wincon, but it has trouble fitting this into its moveset. Toxic can be run to cripple Ghost-type switch-ins such as Sableye and Oricorio-G, but it still misses out on Haunter, and Bouffalant has trouble dropping a move for it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Bouffalant is walled and forced out by Ghost-types such as Sableye, Haunter, and Oricorio-G due to its lack of strong coverage moves. Sableye can cripple it with Taunt and Will-O-Wisp, while Oricorio-G and Haunter can set up either Calm Mind or Substitute freely.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-type Pokemon such as Primeape, Hitmonchan, and Gurdurr all threaten to OHKO Bouffalant. Primeape can gain momentum against it via U-turn, Hitmonchan can remove entry hazards via Rapid Spin on a forced switch, and Gurdurr can take advantage of it with Bulk Up, although the former two cannot switch into a Return.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Physical attackers such as Aggron and Absol muscle through Bouffalant and force it out with their powerful STAB attacks with ease, though they risk heavy damage if Bouffalant is behind a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Without a reliable form of recovery, Bouffalant is prone to getting worn by Toxic from Pokemon like Alolan Sandslash. Bouffalant can also struggle to switch in and set up Substitute if entry hazards are on the field.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute allows Bouffalant to set up Swords Dance on more passive Pokemon and avoid status moves that would cripple it such as Will-O-Wisp and Toxic. Earthquake hits Pokemon that are immune to or resist Bouffalant's Return, such as Jellicent, Regirock, and Aggron.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP and 156 Special Defense EVs prevent Pokemon like defensive Jellicent and Roselia from breaking Bouffalant's Substitute and allow it to take +2 Tectonic Rage from Timid Omastar after Stealth Rock. The remaining 100 Speed EVs allow Bouffalant to outspeed uninvested Lanturn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bouffalant should be kept healthy to check Pokemon like Victreebel and aim to set up early- to mid-game. Don't set up Swords Dance or Substitute if you need Bouffalant healthy to take on Pokemon like Victreebel. Bouffalant should be brought in safely if possible with a double switch or via VoltTurn because it often takes damage before it can set up or attack on its own due to its low Speed. Thanks to Sap Sipper, Bouffalant can switch in safely on Grass-type attacks from the likes of Victreebel and Tangela to gain an Attack boost and force them out. Bouffalant can also use its good special bulk to pivot on weaker special attackers like Lanturn and Oricorio-E, though it should be wary of switching into Scald from Lanturn, as it can be crippled with a burn. Bouffalant has an easier time at setting up on passive Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Clefairy, and Roselia and Choice-locked Pokemon such as Jellicent locked into Shadow Ball. On forced switches, Bouffalant can also set up either Swords Dance or Substitute. Without access to reliable recovery, Bouffalant can be chipped very easily and therefore should be wary of switching into too many attacks. Bouffalant should also avoid being statused, as it needs to be healthy in order to set up and pivot into special attackers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bouffalant fits well on balanced and bulky offensive teams thanks to its ability to check Pokemon like Victreebel and break down defensive teams that rely on passive bulky foes like Regirock and Metang as Normal-type checks. Bouffalant appreciates entry hazard support to break through its checks more easily. Entry hazard setters such as Mudsdale, Qwilfish, and Regirock pair well with Bouffalant, and the former two serve as Fighting-type checks to Pokemon like Primeape, Hitmonchan, and Gurdurr. Qwilfish and Regirock can also cripple foes with Thunder Wave and Toxic for Bouffalant. In return, Bouffalant can check special attackers like Eelektross for the aforementioned Pokemon. Pokemon such as Mudsdale and Regirock are helpful, as they can handle powerful wallbreakers such as Aggron and Stoutland, while also setting up Stealth Rock and luring foes and crippling them with Toxic, chipping away at Pokemon such as Sableye and Oricorio-G that Bouffalant struggles against. Pokemon that can remove entry hazards such as Skuntank and Alolan Sandslash are good partners, since Bouffalant gets worn down quickly between entry hazards and Substitute damage. Skuntank can also absorb Toxic Spikes and Pursuit trap Ghost-type Pokemon such as Haunter and Oricorio-G for Bouffalant. Pokemon such as Lycanroc and Oricorio-E appreciate Bouffalant's ability to weaken bulky Pokemon like Regirock and have an easier time at sweeping and wallbreaking late-game. Lastly, U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Primeape and Lanturn are also good partners for Bouffalant because they can bring it onto the field safely and allow it to set up more freely. Lanturn can also remove status for Bouffalant if it gets crippled by Will-O-Wisp or Toxic in the match, and can lure in passive Pokemon like Clefairy for Bouffalant.</p>"

Furthermore, thanks to its low defenses, Heatmor is unable to take hits well whatsoever and finds itself facing competition from Combusken, which can utilize Eviolite, has a secondary Fighting typing, and has Speed Boost and Swords Dance, making it a more reliable Fire-type wallbreaker.</p>",

Its Speed isn't helping it either, as most of these strong attackers like Stoutland are able to outspeed Heatmor and KO it as well. Heatmor is not recommended over Pokemon like Combusken and Simisear because they are more powerful and they can do a better job than Heatmor overall.</p>"}},

However, for Furfrou to also not be overly passive and be solely outclassed by Alolan Persian, it must invest into its Attack stat to try to mesh the two roles together. Furfrou unfortunately succeeds at neither. Furfrou also doesn't have that great of an offensive nor a support movepool, acting as the final nail in the coffin.</p>",
    "sets": {"Offensive Pivot": {"description": "<p>Furfrou's best attempt is to force out a weakened physical attacker, induce status upon whatever Pokemon is switching in, and then pivot out into a teammate. While this overlapping of roles as an offensive pivot is somewhat unique to Furfrou, the wallbreaking and setup sweeping potential of other Normal-types such as Stoutland, Drampa, Zangoose, and Dodrio is far greater than Furfrou trying to slowly whittle its foes down over time. Furfrou's niche also isn't very useful and therefore is difficult to build a team around.</p>"}},

  "Meowstic": {
    "overview": "<p>Meowstic-M is able to distinguish itself in the PU metagame due to its access to Prankster and a vast supportive movepool including Reflect, Light Screen, Yawn, and Thunder Wave, which makes it a solid user of dual screens. Meowstic-M also sports solid bulk, meaning that, in tandem with priority status moves, Meowstic-M can comfortably set up screens throughout the battle and cripple faster threats such as Dodrio as needed. This makes Meowstic-M a great partner for setup sweepers like Zangoose that exploit the defensive boost Reflect and Light Screen provide. On the downside, Meowstic-M lacks an offensive presence, which means that it's incredibly passive and can be used as setup fodder by certain Dark-type Pokemon such as Absol and Alolan Raticate, which are immune to Prankster moves. Unfortunately, since Skuntank is so prevalent, Meowstic-M has to be wary of Skuntank's immunity to Prankster and access to Defog, Pursuit, and Taunt. Meowstic-M is also almost entirely outclassed by Electrode, which has access to Taunt and can use it to deny the use of Defog from Pokemon like Skuntank and Silvally-Fairy.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic is a viable alternative that can be used to cripple bulky Psychic-types such as Musharna that don't mind a Thunder Wave or Yawn; however, Toxic is hard to fit on its moveset because Thunder Wave and Yawn are too valuable. A set with Signal Beam can be used to hit Dark-types such as Shiftry, but it isn't worth it because Meowstic-M is passive and it doesn't do much damage anyway, especially to its primary threats in Spiritomb and Skuntank which are not weak to it. A set with Magic Coat can also be run to reflect entry hazards, but it's hard to fit on Meowstic-M's moveset because its other attacks are so valuable. While unorthodox, a Calm Mind set can be used with Barrier to further boost Meowstic-M's defensive stats; however, such a set is outclassed by Clefairy, which is immune to status and has access to reliable recovery.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Skuntank, Absol, and Alolan Raticate are immune to Meowstic-M's STAB Psychic-type moves, can threaten it with Pursuit or a strong STAB-boosted Dark-type move in Crunch or Knock Off, or remove screens from the field in Skuntank's case. It is also important to note that they are immune to Prankster Thunder Wave and Yawn. Sableye is also another counter that has an immunity to Prankster moves and the ability to cripple Meowstic-M with Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Defog</strong>: Pokemon such as Lurantis and Swanna can remove screens with Defog. Lurantis can also heal off status with Aromatherapy and can boost its stats with little resistance.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users</strong>: Substitute users, which do not mind Thunder Wave or Yawn, such as Oricorio-G and Alolan Dugtrio, can use Meowstic as setup bait.</p>",

      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Reflect reduces damage from physical attacks such as Kangaskhan. Light Screen reduces damage from special attackers such as Rotom-F, Eelektross, and Abomasnow. These give sweepers like Zangoose and Carracosta easier setup opportunities. Yawn is used generally for forcing switches because it cripples Pokemon that stay in, which provide opportunities for setting up screens. Thunder Wave is useful for crippling faster foes such as Lycanroc.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Prankster is the preferred ability because it gives all of Meowstic-M's non-damaging moves priority, allowing it to set up Reflect and Light Screen and cripple faster threats like Oricorio-G and Dodrio reliably. Light Clay increases the duration of Light Screen and Reflect from five turns to eight, which can provide additional support for setup sweepers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Meowstic-M is best used as a lead early-game in order for its teammates to take as little damage as possible as they set up late-game. After setting up Reflect and Light Screen, a teammate such as Omastar should be switched onto the field to take advantage of screen turns. If only one screen can be set up, consider if the opponent has dangerous physical or special attackers, and which threats your team is more suited to take on, and set up accordingly. It's important to note that switching out Meowstic after it has set up screens preserves it and gives it an opportunity to set them back up later in the game. Thunder Wave should be used to cripple faster foes such as Dodrio and Lycanroc. Yawn should be used to generate momentum so you can get your setup sweepers and wallbreakers in safely. Lastly, since Meowstic-M lacks a way to hit Dark-types it's very susceptible to Pursuit users like Skuntank and Spiritomb, so make sure you double switch into a more suitable matchup if you predict a switch-in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Setup sweepers such as Alolan Raichu, Zangoose, and Jynx enjoy the screen support provided by Meowstic-M, as the boosted defenses make setting up easier. Meowstic-M also pairs well with bulky wallbreakers such as Gurdurr and Aggron, because they are difficult to break once screens are up. Pokemon like Carracosta and Omastar are also effective partners because they can set up with ease and are difficult to revenge kill when screens are up. Fighting-type Pokemon such as Primeape, Gurdurr, and Hitmonchan are also ideal. Primeape is able to punish Defog thanks to Defiant, Gurdurr is great for checking Dark-types like Skuntank and Alolan Raticate, and Hitmonchan is able to provide entry hazard removal and deal with Dark-type Pokemon such as Absol and Shiftry for Meowstic-M thanks to its priority Mach Punch.</p>"

Furthermore, better Defog switch-ins are Primeape and even Pawniard, as they have an easier time sweeping with their respective Choice Scarf set and access to Sucker Punch.

  "Aurorus": {
    "overview": "<p>Aurorus solidifies itself as one of PU's most threatening wallbreakers due to its good offensive typing, fairly high Special Attack, and access to high-powered STAB moves in Blizzard and Refrigerate-boosted Hyper Voice. Both of Aurorus's abilities are brilliant offensively, with Snow Warning giving it a perfectly accurate Blizzard and supplying chip damage on foes and Refrigerate making Normal-type moves into STAB Ice-type attacks and making them stronger. Its access to Freeze-Dry allows it to threaten Water-types that resist Blizzard and Earth Power gives it a way to pressure Steel-types, thus giving it perfect coverage. Aurorus is also capable of pulling off a Choice Scarf set to outspeed and KO some of its offensive checks that attempt to revenge kill it like Victreebel. Aurorus can also function as a lead for offensive teams, taking advantage of its typing allowing it to threaten most forms of entry hazard removal, Snow Warning helping Aurorus against Focus Sash and Sturdy users, and its access to decent support options like Encore and Stealth Rock. Snow Warning allows Aurorus to serve as a decent stop to weather teams, since the hail replaces the weather they had set up upon switching in. Unfortunately, Aurorus's solid bulk is offset by its bad defensive typing, which burdens it with a weakness to both Stealth Rock and common attack typings in Fighting, Grass, Ground, Steel, and Water, though it does leave Aurorus resistant to Normal. Furthermore, Aurorus is prone to being forced out by common offensive Pokemon such as Lycanroc because of its low Speed, forcing it to commonly employ a hit-and-run strategy.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Modest nature on the Choice Scarf set sounds useful for increasing Aurorus's damage output, but it then loses the ability to outspeed Pokemon in the base 110 Speed tier. Frost Breath can also be used over Hidden Power Rock on Choice Specs Aurorus to strike users of Calm Mind such as Clefairy, Musharna, and Spiritomb with a critical hit, ignoring any potential Special Defense boosts they may have obtained. It has very little use outside of this, however. Ancient Power may sound decent over Hidden Power Rock, since it offers a chance to increase all of Aurorus's stats, but it has less PP than Hidden Power Rock, making it easier for Articuno to stall out. Hidden Power Fighting can be used on the Choice Specs set instead of Earth Power, notably allowing for an OHKO on Alolan Sandslash and Aurorus, but this prevents you from threatening Metang and forces you to use Ancient Power instead of Hidden Power Rock. A Choice Band set of Return, Facade, Earthquake, and Zen Headbutt may surprise many of Aurorus's normal switch-ins, but the Choice Specs set has more initial firepower and is more adept at breaking because of this. Rock Polish can be used to turn Aurorus into more of a sweeper; however, it's still outsped by Choice Scarf users such as Primeape at +2, running Rock Polish prevents it from using Choice Specs, and its susceptibility to Mach Punch and Aqua Jet hampers the viability of such a set. Other items that don't lock Aurorus into one move such as Never-Melt Ice and Life Orb can be used, but Never-Melt Ice only increases the power of its Ice-type moves and leaves Aurorus's other moves noticeably weaker, and the recoil taken from Life Orb isn't appreciated, especially when coupled with its vulnerability to both Stealth Rock and common priority. Shuca Berry can be used on the lead set to allow Aurorus to have an easier time stomaching Ground-type attacks from Pokemon like Kangaskhan, though Focus Sash tends to be more consistent.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-type Attacks</strong>: While none of them appreciate switching in on a Choice Specs Blizzard or Hyper Voice, Fighting-types such as Gurdurr, Hitmonchan, Primeape, and Throh all threaten Aurorus out due to its 4x weakness to their STAB moves. Gurdurr and Hitmonchan can both deal heavy damage to Aurorus with Mach Punch, as well, with Gurdurr only needing a little bit of chip damage to OHKO. Fighting-type coverage from Pokemon such as Stoutland threatens Aurorus, too.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Aurorus's low Speed, poor defensive typing, and only decent bulk leave it easily pressured and revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Floatzel and Victreebel. Most of them do have to watch out for a potential Choice Scarf set, however.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Various specially bulky Pokemon such as Articuno, Clefairy, Munchlax, and Type: Null are capable of taking even Blizzard from Aurorus and PP stalling it out of the move. Munchlax's ability in Thick Fat only makes taking it out even more difficult. Encore locking these Pokemon into one of their support moves can be annoying for them, however. Assault Vest Crabominable is capable of countering Aurorus if it isn't running Flash Cannon, and Choice Specs-boosted Flash Cannon only has a chance to 2HKO if Aurorus is Modest and Stealth Rock is up.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Alolan Sandslash, Aggron, Metang and Probopass can all take advantage of Aurorus being Choice-locked into Blizzard, Hyper Voice, or Freeze-Dry and threaten Aurorus with their respective 4x super effective STAB moves, with Alolan Sandslash and Aggron also being able to outspeed Aurorus. Metang can even utilize Bullet Punch to pick Aurorus off after it takes a bit of damage beforehand. While they don't appreciate switching in on Earth Power, or Blizzard in the case of Aggron, their presence can force Aurorus to predict them to switch in, which can in turn backfire on Aurorus.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Blizzard is Aurorus's strongest attack and becomes rather spammable due to Snow Warning perfecting its otherwise low accuracy. If Aurorus is using Refrigerate over Snow Warning, Hyper Voice should be used. Although it's slightly less powerful than Blizzard and doesn't offer hail to further wear down checks, it does comes with the advantage of hitting Pokemon such as Oricorio-G through their Substitutes and doesn't chip away at any of Aurorus's teammates. Freeze-Dry allows Aurorus to hit Ice-resistant Water-types such as Jellicent, Lanturn, and Poliwrath for super effective damage. Earth Power gives Aurorus coverage for Ice-resistant Pokemon such as Aggron, opposing Aurorus, and Alolan Sandslash. Hidden Power Rock targets Articuno, which would otherwise stall Aurorus out of Blizzards and put it on a timer with Toxic. Flash Cannon can be used over Hidden Power Rock to dent Assault Vest Crabominable, potentially 2HKOing after Stealth Rock damage if Aurorus is Modest. Flash Cannon also threatens to cleanly OHKO opposing Aurorus and 2HKO Cryogonal and specially defensive Articuno.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Modest nature maximizes Aurorus' damage, but a Timid nature can be used instead to outspeed Pokemon like Hitmonchan, Lanturn, and Jolly Aggron as well as Omastar in exchange for some of its power. Choice Specs amplifies Aurorus's wallbreaking capabilities, making its attacks harder to switch into. Snow Warning should be used if Blizzard is chosen over Hyper Voice, as this increases Blizzard's accuracy and chips away at Aurorus's switch-ins. Refrigerate is an alternative that turns Hyper Voice into a strong Ice-type attack and doesn't come with the drawback of wearing down Aurorus's team and crippling teammates that rely on weather-dependent recovery such as Roselia.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is geared towards wallbreaking, and while it can do so at almost any point, it is best when used to punch holes in teams early-game. While Aurorus's bulk is good, it shouldn't recklessly switch in on attacks it doesn't resist, especially if Stealth Rock is on its side of the field. Aurorus should mainly get in after one of its teammates is KOed, through the use of Volt Switch or U-turn, or on double switches. However, it can switch in on weaker, resisted attacks from the likes of Skuntank and Oricorio-E or on the predicted use of recovery moves against foes like Sableye. Once in, Aurorus should mainly use its strongest Ice-type move, as it will deal a heavy amount of damage to most foes. While both moves are rather spammable, if Aurorus predicts an Ice-resistant foe to switch in, it should use the appropriate coverage move to deal with them. This allows it to more reliably spam Blizzard or Hyper Voice late-game. Aurorus is capable of beating certain offensive threats in a one-on-one situation such as Silvally-Dragon and Swanna; however, doing so often requires Aurorus to take a fair amount of damage first and leaves it unable to break as effectively, so be cognizant of such a trade.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan and Primeape pair well with Aurorus due to their collective ability to break Steel-types and weaken the specially defensive Pokemon that Aurorus finds itself struggling with. Hitmonchan can offer Aurorus much-appreciated entry hazard control, while Primeape can get Aurorus safely in versus Pokemon like Mudsdale with U-turn. Checks to Fighting-types are also important because of Aurorus's 4x weakness to their STAB attacks, so Pokemon such as Jellicent, Qwilfish and Silvally-Fairy make for good partners, with Silvally-Fairy in particular providing Aurorus with safe switches thanks to Parting Shot and hazard control in Defog. On that note, Aurorus's weakness to Stealth Rock makes entry hazard removal support from Pokemon like Swanna very desirable. Swanna is also capable of checking Fire- and Fighting-types for Aurorus, while Aurorus weakens the specially defensive Pokemon that Swanna tends to bait in such as Eelektross. In addition to hazard removal, entry hazard support is also appreciated due to it further weakening Aurorus's checks, so Pokemon such as Clefairy, the aforementioned Qwilfish, and Omastar make good partners. Late-game special sweepers such as Combusken and Omastar appreciate Aurorus punching holes in teams so that they have an easier time finishing them off. Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Scyther and Thunder Wave users such as Clefairy can help keep Aurorus's offensive checks in check, giving it an easier time with breaking. Primeape and Scyther can both use U-turn to pivot into Aurorus, which is appreciated due to this giving it an easier time switching in. Other pivots such as Eelektross and Lanturn are good at getting Aurorus in safely against foes, and those two can both further support Aurorus by wearing down switch-ins with Knock Off and Toxic, respectively. If Aurorus is running Snow Warning, Alolan Sandslash makes for a perfect partner due to Slush Rush doubling its Speed under hail. Alolan Sandslash can break through Pokemon like Audino and Clefairy for Aurorus, which both pose as annoyances due to their high special bulk and can also clean late-game.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Blizzard is the strongest attack in Aurorus's arsenal, and it becomes rather spammable due to Snow Warning increasing its low accuracy. Freeze-Dry gives Aurorus coverage for Ice-resistant Water-types, allowing to take advantage of builds that rely on Water-types to check Ice-types. Earth Power gives Aurorus coverage for Fire- and Steel-types such as Simisear and Metang. Stone Edge is Aurorus's best move to target Articuno and Cryogonal.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature in tandem with a Choice Scarf allows Aurorus to outspeed Pokemon in the base 110 Speed tier and below such as Alolan Dugtrio and Scyther. Snow Warning increases Blizzard's accuracy, thus making it reliable. Snow Warning also disrupts weather teams, since it removes the weather they set up, and helps chip away at Aurorus's switchins.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Despite lacking a power-boosting item, Choice Scarf Aurorus still functions as a wallbreaker that excels more against offense due to its heightened Speed allowing it to outpace typical offensive checks, and it can also function as a late-game cleaner due to its decent Speed and solid Special Attack. Keep in mind that once Aurorus's set has been revealed, it is much easier to deal with due to its attacks not being as strong as usual, so refrain from making it obvious that Aurorus is using a Choice Scarf unless it is necessary to KO a foe. Aurorus can act as an emergency check to weather teams due to Snow Warning and its ability to outspeed Chlorophyll and Swift Swim users under hail, so after a teammate has been KOed, bring Aurorus in to deal with them. Aurorus should refrain from switching in if Stealth Rock is on its side of the field due to the chip damage shortening its longevity. Similarly, Aurorus should also refrain from switching in on stronger, neutral attacks due to its bulk being only average and this leaving it more susceptible to priority. Keep in mind Stone Edge is quite weak and should only be used to catch Cryogonal and Articuno switching in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since this set struggles heavily with specially defensive Pokemon, Aurorus appreciates physical wallbreakers such as Mudsdale and Stoutland tearing through most of them. In return, Aurorus can weaken their defensive checks like Qwilfish and remove some of their offensive checks like Oricorio-E. Aurorus appreciates checks to Fighting-types, since they threaten it with 4x super effective STAB attacks, so Pokemon such as Golurk and Oricorio-E are good teammates. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Skuntank is appreciated, since Aurorus's weakness to Stealth Rock can prove quite troublesome when it attempts to switch in on more passive Pokemon. Entry hazard support is also nice due to Aurorus's inability to KO certain offensive checks without a bit of chip damage, so Pokemon such as Metang and Clefairy make for good partners. Despite using a Choice Scarf, Aurorus is not the best way of keeping faster Pokemon in check due to its low Speed, so additional Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and priority moves from Pokemon such as Hitmonchan and Skuntank are appreciated.</p>"
      },
      "Stealth Rock Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Blizzard is Aurorus's strongest attack, and it is not hindered by its low accuracy thanks to Snow Warning. Encore dissuades the use of entry hazards, setup moves, and recovery, allowing Aurorus to either set up Stealth Rock or use Blizzard with fewer issues. Rock Tomb prevents Ice-types such as Articuno from freely switching in on Aurorus. It also lowers the Speed of foes, which helps Aurorus outspeed opposing leads and set up Stealth Rock more easily while also supporting slower teammates. Earth Power is another option for the last slot, which allows Aurorus to remove Aggron and damage Alolan Sandslash on the switch. Freeze-Dry provides useful coverage alongside Blizzard, but is somewhat unnecessary coverage for the set as it doesn't need to be able to significantly damage Water-types like Poliwrath or Lanturn in most cases.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Focus Sash allows Aurorus to always take one hit from full health, meaning that it will almost always set up Stealth Rock or use Blizzard. Snow Warning is chosen to perfect the accuracy of Blizzard, to break opposing Focus Sash and Sturdy, and to chip away at defensive Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Aurorus should almost always be the lead for teams, as its main priority should be to set up Stealth Rock as soon as possible. After doing so, Aurorus should mainly use Blizzard to punish incoming entry hazard removers or Encore to disrupt them as they remove Stealth Rock. Aurorus doesn't need to be preserved like other users of Stealth Rock, since it is a lead, so don't feel too pressured to keep it around. However, if it is paired with Alolan Sandslash, it may prove useful not to let it get KOed immediately after setting Stealth Rock due to the hail support Aurorus offers. If running Encore, use it on the predicted use of entry hazards, setup moves, or recovery moves, as this can create chances for Aurorus to set up Stealth Rock or use Blizzard, as well as setup opportunities for Aurorus's teammates. If using Rock Tomb, use it on faster foes such as Simisear so that Aurorus has a better chance of either setting up Stealth Rock or using Blizzard.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set functions best on offensive teams that can take advantage of the entry hazards and hail racking up damage on opposing teams. The more offensive the team, the less likely it is that Stealth Rock can be removed. Due to Slush Rush doubling its Speed under hail, Alolan Sandslash appreciates having Aurorus as a partner, as this gives it an easier time breaking through and sweeping teams. Setup sweepers such as Alolan Persian, Omastar, and Oricorio-E appreciate their defensive switch-ins being worn down by a combination of Stealth Rock and hail damage as well as Aurorus's ability to potentially create setup opportunities for them with Encore. Spinblockers such as Jellicent, Oricorio-G, and Sableye prevent the removal of Stealth Rock via Rapid Spin and also pressure common users of Defog such as Silvally-Fairy and Skuntank. Due to Defiant allowing it to deter and punish the use of Defog in an attempt to remove Stealth Rock, Primeape can make for a good partner. Spikes setters like Roselia and Qwilfish pair well with Aurorus, as they apply further pressure to teams by increasing the residual damage they're forced to take when switching.</p>"

Alolan Raichu is a far more consistent boosting sweeper thanks to its superior offensive stats alongside access to Nasty Plot and moves such as Focus Blast and STAB Psyshock, whereas other Electric-types such as Rotom-F and Eelektross also boast far better coverage options.</p>",

  "Carbink": {
    "overview": "<p>Carbink is one of the best Trick Room setters in the tier thanks to its access to Sturdy, which give it great odds at setting Trick Room successfully. It is also one of PU's niche special walls thanks to its amazing defensive typing and stats, which allow it to check threatening offensive Pokemon such as Drampa, Oricorio-G, and Simisear. Furthermore, these traits almost guarantee that Carbink will set up Stealth Rock in a match. On the downside, Carbink's abysmal Speed leaves it as an open target for Taunt users like Jellicent. Despite Carbink's amazing defenses, its low HP stat, along with its weakness to common attacking types like Water, Ground, and Grass means that it struggles to take hits from powerful attackers such as Omastar and Victreebel, which both 2HKO Carbink with ease, and while Steel-type coverage moves may not be as common, Steel-types like Alolan Sandslash and Aggron can easily exploit Carbink's 4x weakness. Unfortunately, Carbink faces competition from other bulky Stealth Rock users such as Regirock and Torterra, which have a combination of better offensive presence, better stats, and better support movepools. Despite these weaknesses, Carbink still holds a niche as one of the best Trick Room setters, and its ability to switch into Drampa is unrivaled.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A weather lead set sounds appealing because Carbink has access to Sturdy, but it's outclassed by Regirock. A physically defensive set can be used too, but there is really no reason to ever use that over Regirock. A Calm Mind RestTalk set can be run on Carbink; however, Carbink needs several boosts to become threatening due to its mediocre offensive stats, and this set is setup fodder for threatening sweepers such as Bellossom and Carracosta. Stone Edge can be used over Rock Slide on its specially defensive set for its extra power, but means Pokemon like Articuno can PP stall it. Z-Psych Up can be used to heal Carbink to 100% HP as well as potentially copy stat boosts, and unlike Rest, it does not amplify how passive Carbink is by forcing it to sleep or its teammates to provide cleric support. However, Rest is still a better option given it alleviates harmful status afflictions, like Toxic, that prevent Carbink from checking what it needs to. Sleep Talk can be used together with Rest and Carbink's STAB moves on teams that are using a different Pokemon to set Stealth Rock.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt and Encore</strong>: If Carbink's specially defensive set is hit by Taunt, it will be unable to do much, and the foe can subsequently use it as setup bait. Some common Taunt users include Qwilfish and Skuntank. Carbink also has to be wary of Encore users such as Liepard and Volbeat that will lock it into Stealth Rock or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Golurk and Torterra can switch in relatively freely against Carbink and either force it out with the threat of Earthquake or set up Stealth Rock, though Toxic can pressure them.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Alolan Dugtrio, Aggron, and Metang can all come in on a predicted Moonblast and threaten Carbink with their respective STAB moves; Alolan Dugtrio and Aggron OHKO Carbink with Iron Head and Heavy Slam. Metang counters Carbink's specially defensive set and sets up Stealth Rock freely.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Gastrodon and Lanturn take hardly any damage from Moonblast. Gastrodon can wear Carbink down with Scald, although it must be wary of switching into Toxic, and Lanturn is even more terrifying for Carbink because it can wear Carbink down with Scald and use Heal Bell to get rid of a potential Toxic.</p>",

      "Trick Room Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room allows slower teammates such as Crabominable to move before faster Pokemon such as Floatzel and Primeape. Stealth Rock is a solid way of weakening foes upon switching in, making it easier for teammates such as Wishiwashi to break through the opposing team. Stealth Rock also breaks potential Sturdy and Focus Sash from Pokemon such as Golem and Leavanny, which greatly helps Trick Room teams, since they rely on limited turns and cannot afford to waste them dealing with a Pokemon with Focus Sash or Sturdy. Explosion allows Carbink to prevent Defog and Rapid Spin while giving teammates the opportunity to come in safely afterward. Magic Coat bounces back certain non-damaging moves such as Lovely Kiss and Taunt, which would otherwise prevent Carbink from fulfilling its job, as well as entry hazards such as Toxic Spikes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Minimal Speed investment allows Carbink to move before the opposing Pokemon under Trick Room and set up Stealth Rock. Sturdy alongside Mental Herb makes it almost impossible for a foe to stop Carbink from setting up Trick Room and helps setting up both Stealth Rock and Trick Room effectively.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Carbink functions best as a suicide lead on Trick Room teams. Since the opponent will usually lead with a check to Carbink, it should always set up Trick Room before using Stealth Rock. Carbink should then use Explosion to preserve Trick Room turns and get a teammate like Marowak in for free. However, if you play against a Pokemon with access to Encore such as Liepard, Carbink should set up Trick Room and hard switch so it doesn't waste a turn of Trick Room. Carbink should also use Magic Coat to reflect incoming entry hazards like Regirock's Stealth Rock and status moves that would prevent Carbink from setting up Trick Room or Stealth Rock successfully like Qwilfish's Taunt.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Carbink works great on Trick Room teams, as it can almost always set up Trick Room; thus, slow wallbreakers such as Crabominable, Marowak, Wishiwashi, and Guts Ursaring are ideal because they can wallbreak comfortably without being outsped by faster Pokemon such as Primeape and Jynx. Since Carbink ends up being sacrificed after using Explosion, other Trick Room setters such as Beheeyem, Musharna, and Audino are appreciated so you can get up Trick Room again later on in the match. While not mandatory, fast cleaners such as Floatzel and Choice Scarf Primeape are recommended for when Trick Room has expired because they have better chances to clean late-game once the aforementioned wallbreakers have removed their checks. Strong priority users like Kecleon that can overcome the archetype's low Speed stat during times Trick Room is no longer active are great for Trick Room teams, too.</p>"
      },
      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>STAB Moonblast allows Carbink to deal super effective damage to Drampa. Moonblast also ensures that Carbink isn't Taunt bait or setup fodder for Sableye. Alternatively, Rock Slide is Carbink's most reliable Rock-type move and hits Flying-, Fire-, Bug-, and Ice-types harder than Moonblast. For example, it 2HKOes the Fire-types that Carbink beats like Simisear without any Attack investment. Furthermore, Rock Slide prevents Oricorio-G from setting up on Carbink with Substitute and Calm Mind and breaks Jynx's Substitute reliably, which Moonblast is unable to do, while also preventing Articuno from PP stalling with Substitute. Toxic allows Carbink to cripple switch-ins such as Lanturn, Lurantis, and the plethora of offensive Pokemon that can take advantage of it. Rest is Carbink's only recovery option and allows Carbink to reliably check foes such as Drampa throughout the match. Protect can be used over Rest for an extra turn of Leftovers recovery, scouting against Choice-locked Pokemon, and reducing the damage of incoming Z-Moves. Additionally, using Protect in tandem with Toxic enables Carbink to stall out its foes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment with a Calm or Careful nature ensures that Carbink can take on special wallbreakers such as Simisear and Drampa. A Careful nature should be used with Rock Slide to maximize its damage. Leftovers maximizes longevity by granting Carbink passive recovery and pairs well with Protect if running it. Clear Body enables Carbink to block Parting Shot and avoid stat drops from moves such as Drampa's Focus Blast. Sturdy also has usefulness in almost guaranteeing Carbink Stealth Rock by surviving a strong hit, but few attacks are capable of OHKOing Carbink to begin with.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Carbink should set up Stealth Rock and blanket check powerful special attackers throughout the match, using Toxic against setup sweepers in order to cut their sweep short. If Stealth Rock has already been set, Carbink can use the switches it forces by virtue of its typing and defenses to whittle down its foes with Toxic or its STAB moves. Carbink should mostly be used to counter special attackers such as Drampa and Musharna, but Carbink can also check physical attackers such as Kangaskhan and Dodrio because of its high Defense and resistances. Carbink should be wary of Taunt users, as it's slow, and Taunt prevents it from using Toxic and Stealth Rock. Lastly, when Carbink is low on health make sure to use Rest so it can consistently check special attackers like Drampa and Simisear. Carbink should use Protect to scout Choice-locked Pokemon like Jellicent and wear down checks in tandem with Toxic.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Carbink almost exclusively fits on stall teams due to its ability to check many of the tier's prominent special wallbreakers; thus, pairing Carbink with bulky Pokemon such as Bronzor, Sableye, Altaria, and Tangela is ideal, as they all appreciate a bulky special wall that can check Drampa. Additionally, clerics such as Audino and Lanturn can help remove any status conditions such as sleep on Carbink with Heal Bell. Carbink is susceptible to entry hazards, so Defoggers like Skuntank and Altaria are recommended. Skuntank, in particular, is great at absorbing Toxic Spikes, which can be a hinderance for stall teams. Lastly, Ground- and Steel-type checks such as Gastrodon make for good teammates because Carbink has no way to threaten the former other than with Toxic and is often helpless against the latter.</p>"

Z-Trick-or-Treat also gives it a considerable amount of bulk and increased Attack, though it's still quite lackluster compared to that of other setup sweepers. Even though Gourgeist struggles as a defensive pivot, it's still able to wall foes like Primeape due to its Ghost / Grass typing. While Gourgeist has quite a shallow physical movepool, with its lack of a strong Ghost-type STAB move other than Phantom Force meaning it has to put up with the charge turn, it just about gets by with attacks like Return, Seed Bomb, Shadow Sneak, and Rock Slide.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gourgeist can run Jolly over Adamant, allowing it to outspeed threats such as Choice Scarf Alolan Sandslash and Choice Scarf Kabutops; however, it really needs all the extra Attack it can get from an Adamant nature. Fire Blast with a Naughty Nature is a niche option, able to hit Pokemon like Shiftry and Alolan Sandslash, but it doesn't offer much besides that. Explosion is a potential move in the last slot, allowing for a powerful nuke. A defensive set is possible but is noticeably worse in comparison to Tangelap due to its lesser bulk and lack of Regenerator, meaning things like Hitmonchan, which Tangela counters, can 2HKO it after Stealth Rock chip damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Walls</strong>: Gourgeist, even at +1, struggles to break bulky walls like Tangela and Audino, both of which have ways of crippling it with Audino is also being able to recover versus it.</p> <p><strong>Grass-Resistant Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Drampa and Oricorio-E are all able to reliably check Gourgeist, even when it is boosted. Drampa is the most notable, as Sap Sipper makes it immune to Gourgeist's STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Rotom-F and Jynx are able to revenge kill Gourgeist, though Jynx needs prior chip damage and must be wary of Shadow Sneak variants.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Shiftry, Skuntank, and Absol are all able to easily check Gourgeist with their STAB Dark-type moves, with Skuntank being able to wall most variants as well. They struggle versus Gourgeist if it's boosted, however, and have to rely on Sucker Punch to take it out.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Poison from Toxic Spikes, paralysis, and burn greatly limit Gourgeist's ability to sweep and put it on a timer due to it not having any reliable recovery on this set or any way to remove status.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Z-Trick-or-Treat boosts all of Gourgeist's stats apart from HP while also adding Ghost typing to the foe. Phantom Force is the preferred Ghost-type STAB move, but the fact that it takes a turn to charge means that it is easily exploited by foes, especially Normal-types. Shadow Sneak is an alternative, albeit weaker STAB move that doesn't require a turn to charge and gives Gourgeist priority against fast Choice Scarf users like Jynx. Alternatively, Return allows Gourgeist to hit Pokemon like Skuntank harder and gives it almost perfect neutral coverage. Rock Slide is an option to hit Fire-types, like Turtonator and Simisear.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Ghostium Z is 100% required for this set to function, as without it Gourgeist isn't able to use Z-Trick-or-Treat. Running 160 Speed EVs ensures it outspeeds all of the unboosted tier apart from Electrode and Ninjask, both of which can do little to Gourgeist. Frisk is not a very useful ability when used on this Gourgeist set, as it will not be pivoting in to try and wall something, but it's the best ability Gourgeist has access to due to it already being immune to most sleep-inducing moves. Frisk still has some utility in being able to scout the foe's item.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gourgeist should only really be used late-game, when your opponent's team is weakened and ready to be swept, as using it early-game would generally put you at a significant disadvantage versus anything that's not offense. It should attempt to set up on something that's ineffective against it, like Primeape, and shouldn't try to boost against special attackers. Gourgeist appreciates being pivoted in by slow U-turn or Volt Switch users so that it doesn't receive any damage before being able to boost. Even though at +1 Gourgeist outspeeds almost all of the metagame, it is still slower than almost every Choice Scarf user, so it should only use its Z-Move once these faster threats like Choice Scarf Dodrio are dealt with. The same goes for physically bulky Pokemon like Gurdurr and Tangela, which should be either KOed or sufficiently weakened.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gourgeist, even at +1 Attack, is often still very weak, so it appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Regirock and Qwilfish to help deal chip damage on the opponent's Pokemon. Slow Volt Switch and U-turn from teammates like Lanturn and Type: Null helps Gourgeist get in for free. Lanturn additionally has great defensive synergy with Gourgeist, as it resists both Fire and Flying and offers Heal Bell support. Toxic Spikes absorbers like Skuntank greatly help during the match, as Toxic Spikes cripple Gourgeist and limit its sweeping potential. Skuntank can also trap foes with Pursuit and remove all hazards with Defog. Powerful wallbreakers like Aurorus and Zangoose are able to weaken the opponent's team enough for Gourgeist to potentially sweep later on.</p>"

Additionally, it should be careful when using Will-O-Wisp on Stoutland and Kangaskhan because they may carry Facade. When Gourgeist-XL is in safely, feel free to use Leech Seed to passively damage its foes. Make sure you scout for sets when switching Gourgeist-XL in on Water-types like Floatzel and Carracosta because they can carry Ice Beam. Gourgeist-XL is easiest to bring in on Fighting- and Ground-types such as Primeape and non-Toxic Mudsdale because it walls them with ease. Gourgeist-XL should be used to spinblock due to its Ghost typing, so bring it in on spinners like Hitmonchan. Lastly, use Synthesis when Gourgeist-XL is low on health, and be wary when switching in Gourgeist-XL on Pokemon such as Lanturn because it can carry Toxic.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to Gourgeist-XL's great physical bulk and lack of offensive presence, it's usually used on bulkier teams. Skuntank makes a good partner because it is able to absorb Toxic Spikes, remove entry hazards, and Pursuit trap Psychic- and Ghost-types for Gourgeist-XL, while Gourgeist-XL takes on Fighting- and Ground-types such as Gurdurr and Mudsdale for it. Regirock checks Flying-types such as Dodrio and Oricorio-G, in addition to Skuntank. Pokemon like Gurdurr and Silvally-Fairy that are able to take on other Dark-types also pair well with Gourgeist-XL. Lastly, specially defensive Pokemon like Cryogonal and Lanturn are of great help to Gourgeist-XL; Cryogonal can use its immense special bulk to take on powerful breakers like Drampa, while Gourgeist-XL in return protects Cryogonal from Fighting-type attacks. Similarly, Lanturn uses its array of resistances to take Fire-, Ice-, and Flying-type attacks for Gourgeist-XL, while also ridding Gourgeist-XL of crippling status with the use of Heal Bell. In return, Gourgeist-XL is able to take on Fighting-, Grass-, and Ground-types such as Primeape, Leafeon, and Torterra that Lanturn struggles against.</p>"

  "Toucannon": {
    "overview": "<p>Toucannon is the strongest Flying-type in PU and sports extremely strong coverage. Boomburst and Brave Bird make Toucannon a tough Pokemon to switch into due to their high Base Power, and coverage moves such as Bullet Seed and Overheat allow Toucannon to pressure common Flying-type checks, such as Regirock, extremely well. However, Toucannon's lack of Speed and bulk also makes it very underwhelming against offensive teams and makes it hard to get off an attack at all. Toucannon is also prone to being revenge killed easily and worn down by Life Orb, Stealth Rock, and Brave Bird recoil. Most importantly though, Toucannon is extremely inferior to Dodrio, which is much faster, nearly as strong, and able to effectively run Swords Dance and Choice Scarf sets.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While being its most unique and viable set, Toucannon's mixed set can be altered or changed to suit a different role on a team or for more surprise factors. One slight change that can be made is using an alternative fourth move on Toucannon by changing Bullet Seed to Flash Cannon, since it serves a similar purpose in hitting Rock-types. Its ability can then also be changed to Sheer Force, as it better complements Flash Cannon and allows Toucannon to replace Overheat with Heat Wave, which comes with the benefit of not dropping Special Attack but is weaker overall. With Sheer Force, Flash Cannon is capable of 2HKOing physically defensive Sableye and reliably 2HKOes Regirock. Rock Blast can also be used in the fourth slot because it gives a different coverage option against Flying-types like Oricorio-G. Both are generally outclassed by Bullet Seed, however, while Rock Blast is outclassed by even Flash Cannon. Tailwind can be added on to a set to give Toucannon a better chance of threatening more Pokemon as well as provide a nice support option for the rest of the team. The downside is sacrificing coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-type Pokemon like Regirock and Probopass can take a Boomburst quite easily, stomach a Bullet Seed, and threaten Toucannon with Rock-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Toucannon's Speed and typing leave it prone to being easily revenge killed by Pokemon like Lycanroc, Alolan Dugtrio, and Floatzel. However, these Pokemon will find it almost impossible to safely switch in on Toucannon.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types assure that Toucannon is not always free to spam Boomburst, as they can potentially switch into it. Common threats are Oricorio-G, Spiritomb, and Silvally-Ghost. While these Pokemon are not completely safe from Toucannon's other coverage, the fact that they are immune to Toucannon's strongest move can make them harder to deal with.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types reliably check Toucannon by revenge killing it and resisting Toucannon's second STAB move Brave Bird. Common threats include Eelektross and Oricorio-E.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Boomburst is Toucannon's strongest move and is easily spammable because of its huge Base Power. Boomburst also benefits from being a special move, as it hits physical walls such as Musharna and Mudsdale, which can potentially switch in on Toucannon otherwise. Brave Bird is Toucannon's strongest Flying-type STAB move and hits anything Boomburst doesn't hit harder, which includes Pokemon with high Special Defense stats such as Audino and Ghost-types like Oricorio-G and Sableye. Brave Bird also rounds out Toucannon's role as a mixed wallbreaker by letting it inflict physical damage. Bullet Seed is a good coverage move on Toucannon thanks to its ability Skill Link turning it into a 125-Base Power Grass-type move. This helps with specific Pokemon that are weak to Grass like Lanturn, Carracosta, and especially Regirock, which are either OHKOed or 2HKOed on the switch. Overheat is for covering Steel-types such as Ferroseed, which would otherwise wall Toucannon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment maximizes Toucannon's Special Attack stat, making Boomburst easily spammable and letting Overheat hit hard. Patching up its Special Attack also makes Toucannon a better mixed attacker by allowing it to hit both physically and specially defensive Pokemon equally hard. Toucannon does not run Attack investment because its massive base 120 Attack stat is enough to KO or dent bulky specially defensive Pokemon like Clefairy and Lanturn without investment. Life Orb is the preferred item because running a mixed set requires immediate power and the ability to switch between moves, which Choice items prevent, so it isn't as easily forced out by Pokemon switching in. Rash is the optimal nature because Toucannon's Speed is still enough to outspeed maximum invested base 50 Speed Pokemon like Aggron without sacrificing power. Naive can also be used to outspeed Pokemon such as Jolly Golurk and Ursaring while Speed tying with Pokemon such as Abomasnow and Pawniard. Since Toucannon is so slow, a positive-Speed nature is not required to accomplish much, usually. Skill Link is the most useful ability Toucannon has, as it helps to boost Bullet Seed, turning it into a 125-Base Power coverage move.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Toucannon is a mixed wallbreaker, which gives it the ability to adapt and deal with different Pokemon that may come in on it. This makes it hard to switch into, but prediction plays a big role in using it effectively, because it can be worn down quickly thanks to Life Orb recoil and its Stealth Rock weakness. Leading with Toucannon can be advantageous against some entry hazard leads like Ferroseed, as it can put immediate pressure on the opponent to possibly sacrifice something to Toucannon. Another job Toucannon has is to weaken bulkier Pokemon, since very few Pokemon resist its coverage. After Toucannon has weakened the opponent's team, a hard hitter or setup sweeper it is paired with can finish off the game. To achieve this goal, it is important to set Toucannon up with favorable matchups by double switching or via pivot switches; otherwise, Toucannon will not be able get off attacks due to its frailty and low Speed. Do not feel too pressured to preserve Toucannon because it loses its usefulness late-game, when opposing players' slower Pokemon are more likely to be gone.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Toucannon works well with fast, strong hitters that can take advantage of its wallbreaking abilities. This includes Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Primeape, which appreciate Toucannon getting rid of Pokemon like Ferroseed and Mudsdale. Primeape is particularly good because of its pivoting capabilities with U-turn and benefits from Toucannon's potential to severely weaken an opposing team giving it a good chance at sweeping late-game. Other pivoting Pokemon such as Lanturn and Alolan Persian can also keep momentum and produce favorable matchups for Toucannon. Lanturn's slow pivoting moves especially make it easier for Toucannon to safely come in. In the case you want to preserve Toucannon, Pokemon like Lanturn, Eelektross, and Regirock can be used as all-around good blanket checks to Pokemon coming in to revenge kill Toucannon, such as Alolan Raichu, while at the same time contributing entry hazards to make Toucannon's job a bit easier against bulkier Pokemon such as Type: Null and Musharna by limiting switches. Toucannon naturally appreciates a Pokemon to remove hazards, such as Skuntank, because of how fast and easy it is to wear down with repeated switches into Stealth Rock on top of recoil from Life Orb and Brave Bird. On top of hazard removal, Skuntank also provides Pursuit support, which can free Toucannon of the worry of Ghost-type switch-ins to Boomburst, making it more spammable.</p>"

Unfortunately, using Oricorio-F means giving up using Oricorio-E or Oricorio-G, which have significantly better defensive typing that notably don't cause them to take 50% of their HP from Stealth Rock. It also lacks much in the way of coverage against its checks such as Regirock, and is easily revenge killed by Pokemon such as Lycanroc and Dodrio thanks to its low bulk. This low bulk combined with Oricorio-F's typing also makes it hard to set up with. Even in terms of offensive Fire-types, Simisear, Combusken, and Turtonator are better options because they have better coverage overall and can still set up like Oricorio-F can.</p>",

  "Oricorio-Pom-Pom": {
    "overview": "<p>Oricorio-E is a premier threat in PU thanks to its good defensive typing, decent bulk, and access to Roost, which make it a solid and consistent answer to Pokemon such as Gurdurr, Scyther, Ferroseed, and Hitmonchan. It has a good utility movepool, with options such as Taunt to beat walls like Lanturn and Audino that try to cripple it with Toxic and Calm Mind to greatly threaten teams lacking a consistent answer and have an incredible matchup against bulky teams. This is further enhanced by its good Speed, which allows it to outspeed common Pokemon, such as Stoutland, Skuntank, Qwilfish, and Kangaskhan. Oricorio-E is also fairly unpredictable, as its sets have different counterplay for the most part, and the Calm Mind set is able to pick its checks thanks to its decent movepool; if using Hidden Power Fighting, it can beat Alolan Sandslash and pressure Rock-types like Aggron, while Taunt allows it to beat walls like Lanturn and Clefairy. However, it suffers from only decent bulk and a weakness to Stealth Rock, which hamper its ability to check what it's supposed to check. This also means that it's often forced to use Roost, which can result in a huge momentum loss. Oricorio-E doesn't hit particularly hard unless it has boosted several times, which means that it often finds itself walled by very common foes like Regirock, Alolan Sandslash, and Lanturn depending on what it's using. In a similar vein, while it's decently fast, it's outsped by dangerous and common threats like Lycanroc, Choice Scarf Aurorus, Cryogonal, Simisear, and Jynx, which can all deal with it or force it out and even set up while it's forced to switch out in the case of Lycanroc, Simisear, and Jynx. Lastly, it's susceptible to status ailments, especially poison, as they greatly hinder its defensive prowess.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Oricorio-E can use a more offensive Calm Mind set thanks to its decent coverage, although this set suffers from competition from Oricorio-G due to its inferior offensive typing and inability to check threats like Gurdurr as well. Oricorio-E can also successfully use a Choice Scarf set due to its ability to outspeed dangerous threats like Omastar and Carracosta and access to U-turn, and it has a nice surprise factor. However, locking Oricorio-E into the wrong move can be costly, as it can be taken advantage of by Pokemon like Lycanroc and Ferroseed. Choice Specs makes Oricorio-E a rather threatening wallbreaker due to its good coverage, Hurricane's Base Power, and its Speed and immediate power, although it can struggle to break past bulky titans like Lanturn and Regirock. Moreover, Hurricane is a rather unreliable move, and Choice Specs Oricorio-E suffers from the same issue as the Choice Scarf set, as it's easily exploitable. The Calm Mind set is also better, as, over time, it's a way scarier wallbreaker and can check threats better. Lum Berry is an option if a teammate is already using a Z-Move, as it allows Oricorio-E to switch in more recklessly against Toxic users like Lanturn and Audino. U-turn is an option on either set over Hidden Power Fighting or Taunt to pivot out of an unfavorable matchup, but this means that Oricorio-E can't stallbreak or pressure the opponent as effectively. Defog takes advantage of Oricorio-E's typing, ability to force out threats, and access to Taunt to remove entry hazards against the likes of Qwilfish, Ferroseed, and Mudsdale and prevent them from setting them again. However, it struggles to beat Regirock, which can make it unreliable. It also means that Oricorio-E is giving up on Calm Mind or the ability to stallbreak, which makes it significantly easier to deal with.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Altaria and Lanturn can reliably switch into and cripple non-Taunt Oricorio-E with Toxic, putting it on a timer. Cryogonal can reliably deal with any Oricorio-E set thanks to its Ice typing and access to reliable recovery, although sets lacking Frost Breath do struggle to beat Oricorio-E if it has many boosts under its belt.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Regirock can reliably switch into anything Oricorio-E can throw at it and take it out with Stone Edge, cripple it with Toxic, or set Stealth Rock, which means that Oricorio-E will take chip damage every time it comes in. While they can't switch in, threats like Lycanroc, Aggron, and Kabutops pose a huge threat to Oricorio-E, although Aggron always has to be cautious of Hidden Power Fighting, as it's slower.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: Faster offensive threats like Simisear and Dodrio can pressure and revenge kill Oricorio-E, although they can't switch in safely and can't deal with a boosted or healthy Oricorio-E.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types like Choice Scarf Aurorus and Rotom-F can deal heavy damage to Oricorio-E or simply take it out. Alolan Sandslash under hail is extremely dangerous for Oricorio-E, although if hail isn't up, it will fold to Hidden Power Fighting while the former two can't deal with an Oricorio-E with many boosts under its belt.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Oricorio-E's average bulk makes it extremely susceptible to Stealth Rock and Toxic from the likes of Gastrodon and even Gurdurr if it catches it on the switch, which can often force it to use Roost a lot more than it'd like to while also giving it a hard time doing its job successfully, although Taunt can negate the latter.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hidden Power Fighting hits Alolan Sandslash, Aurorus, and Aggron harder than anything else, which can otherwise take advantage of Oricorio-E or even switch into it in the case of Alolan Sandslash. Taunt is an option that allows Oricorio-E to act as a stallbreaker, prevents Pokemon such as Clefairy and Audino from crippling it with Toxic, gives Oricorio-E more chances to set up, and shuts down entry hazards setters and removers like Mudsdale, Ferroseed, Qwilfish, and Skuntank. Finally, Revelation Dance is an alternative option for a weaker but more reliable STAB attack that also allows Oricorio-E to pressure Articuno and Regirock more easily.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Dancer, albeit situational, allows Oricorio-E to punish moves such as Bellossom's Quiver Dance and Oricorio-G's Revelation Dance. Flyinium Z, when used alongside Hurricane, allows Oricorio-E to muscle past bulky titans like Audino, Mudsdale, Altaria, and even Pokemon that resist it like Lanturn. It also allows Oricorio-E to deal with frailer offensive threats, like Rotom-F and Skuntank, and ignore Hurricane's poor accuracy. Rocky Helmet is an alternative to Flyinium Z if you already have a Z-Move user on your team to chip down threats like Gurdurr, Primeape, Scyther, and Kangaskhan, which often use moves like Knock Off, U-turn, and Fake Out.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Oricorio-E should take advantage of the Pokemon it checks and forces out to set up with Calm Mind, attack, or heal itself with Roost if it's weakened, which can also be used to reduce damage taken from Electric-type attacks from the likes of Lanturn and Eelektross. In order to prevent a momentum loss, it should wear down its checks such as Regirock and Alolan Sandslash before trying to set up with Calm Mind, although the latter struggles against Hidden Power Fighting variants. However, if the opponent only has checks unable to switch into Oricorio-E, such as Aggron, setting up with Calm Mind allows it to pressure the opposing team more easily. It's important to keep Oricorio-E away from status ailments, as they greatly cripple Oricorio-E and hinder its ability to check threats like Oricorio-G and clean with Calm Mind. Oricorio-E should be played differently depending on its last moveslot. Hidden Power Fighting hits Alolan Sandslash, Aurorus, and Aggron, which means that it can pressure them and even set up if they're the opponent's only check. However, if running Taunt, Oricorio-E can use defensive behemoths that could otherwise cripple it or set up alongside it like Altaria, Lanturn, and Clefairy as setup fodder.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Oricorio-E greatly appreciates entry hazard removal, as it can be overwhelmed by threats like Gurdurr or forced to use Roost and lose momentum if Stealth Rock is present. Therefore, Rapid Spin and Defog users such as Alolan Sandslash, which checks Ice-types, and Skuntank, which chips Regirock, are heavily recommended. Lurantis is another good partner, as it can also pressure Regirock for Oricorio-E. Pokemon that appreciate Oricorio-E's ability to check threats like Gurdurr, Hitmonchan, Bellossom, and Oricorio-G work well alongside it. An example of this is Regirock, which can set Stealth Rock for Oricorio-E, cripple opposing Regirock with Toxic, and chip Alolan Sandslash. Oricorio-E also appreciates partners such as Substitute + Toxic Kangaskhan and Stoutland, which soften up walls like Regirock, Eelektross, and Lanturn for Oricorio-E; Stoutland can even Pursuit trap the latter two. Entry hazard setters like Aggron, Ferroseed, and Qwilfish make for decent partners to ease Oricorio-E's job; Qwilfish can also act as a secondary Fighting-type check, which reduces pressure on Oricorio-E. Oricorio-E often finds itself forced out by faster Rock-types like Lycanroc and Choice Scarf Kabutops. Due to this, it appreciates having a partner able to deal with them, such as Gurdurr, Mudsdale, and Tangela. In a similar vein, it also struggles against faster Ice-types such as Jynx and Choice Scarf Aurorus, which means that Pokemon able to switch into them such as Cryogonal and Lanturn or even Pokemon able to check them, like Choice Scarf Dodrio and Primeape, make for good partners.</p>"

This set is rather uncommon compared to boosting ones, and their answers differ. Due to this, it's a good idea to not reveal Oricorio-E's set too early in the game. It can cripple unexpecting switch-ins, such as Regirock, Eelektross, and Audino, making it easier for a teammate to break through them. Status from Pokemon like Altaria, Audino, and Gastrodon should be avoided, especially Toxic, as Oricorio-E struggles to stallbreak or check threats as effectively when crippled.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon like Omastar, Simisear, and Dodrio appreciate Oricorio-E wearing down and beating defensive behemoths such as Lanturn, Audino, and Regirock. Lycanroc is another solid partner, as it appreciates Oricorio-E's ability to weaken Mudsdale and check Fighting- and Ground-types like Gurdurr and Gastrodon. In exchange, Lycanroc is able to set Stealth Rock and can pressure threats like Cryogonal, which gives Oricorio-E a hard time. Entry hazard removal lets Oricorio-E check what it's supposed to check more easily, so Pokemon like Skuntank and Alolan Sandslash work well with it. The former appreciates Oricorio-E wearing down Regirock for it, and they both can check Grass-types like Bellossom, taking pressure off Oricorio-E. They also both appreciate Oricorio-E dealing with Ground- and Fighting-types like non-Rock Slide Mudsdale and Gurdurr. Entry hazards ease Oricorio-E's job, as they help it chip down walls like Mudsdale and Gastrodon faster while also easing its matchup against threats like Regirock, which otherwise walls it with little to no difficulty. Therefore, setters like Qwilfish and Golurk work well alongside it. These also appreciate Oricorio-E's ability to use Taunt on Defog users like Skuntank, and they also act as secondary Fighting-type checks.</p>"

Its typing also allows it to force out threats like Gurdurr and Victreebel and spinblock, which is greatly appreciated on team relying on stacking entry hazards. It can also make good use of Taunt to turn Pokemon like Audino, Altaria, and Clefairy into setup fodder, and it finds plenty of opportunities to use Substitute, which notably prevents it from getting revenge killed and allows it to dodge Sucker Punch from the likes of Skuntank and Absol and avoid status. Oricorio-G's bulky set takes advantage of its good defensive typing, bulk, and access to Roost and Taunt to switch into and use Pokemon like Gurdurr, Qwilfish, Hitmonchan, and Victreebel as setup fodder. However, it can struggle to wallbreak efficiently and needs multiple boosts to do so due to its average Special Attack. This means that walls like Regirock, Lanturn, and Articuno can easily take it on before it boosts. A weakness to Stealth Rock makes it extremely easy to wear down and forces it to use Roost a lot more than it'd like to, which can result in a loss of momentum and cut down on the number of times it can use Substitute. Oricorio-G is also susceptible to super effective coverage from threats it checks, such as Gurdurr's Knock Off and Hitmonchan's Thunder Punch and Stone Edge. It also struggles against faster Pokemon, like Lycanroc and Dodrio, which can KO it or even trap it with Pursuit in the latter's case. Its Ghost typing also leaves it vulnerable to Sucker Punch from the likes of Skuntank and especially Spiritomb, which bypasses Substitute with Infiltrator. Lastly, Oricorio-G receives major competition from Oricorio-E, as it's an overall better Pokemon thanks to its better defensive typing, which allows it to pivot into threats like Gurdurr and Hitmonchan more easily and leaves it forced out by fewer threats.</p>",

Oricorio-G can also successfully use a Choice Scarf set due to its good Speed tier, which enables it to outspeed dangerous threats like Simisear and Carracosta, and access to U-turn, and it has a nice surprise factor. However, it can easily be taken advantage of with threats like Kangaskhan and Lycanroc depending on what it locks itself into, and it faces competition from other Choice Scarf users that are faster and hit harder, such as Dodrio and Primeape. Defog is an option to take advantage of Oricorio-G's ability to force out threats, its typing, and Taunt to remove entry hazards against the likes of Qwilfish and Mudsdale and prevent them from setting them again. However, it struggles to beat Regirock and Alolan Sandslash, two common setters, which can make it unreliable. It also means that Oricorio-G is giving up on Calm Mind, which makes it significantly easier to deal with, and it gives up on what it can do best.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Regirock is capable of switching into any Oricorio-G set and threatening it with Rock Slide and Stone Edge. It can also set Stealth Rock or use Toxic on the switch-in as Oricorio-G is forced out. Other Rock-types like Lycanroc and Aggron can't switch in directly but can pressure Oricorio-G rather easily, although they fail to revenge kill it if it's behind a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types like Alolan Sandslash, Rotom-F, and Aurorus can easily get rid of Oricorio-G with their STAB moves, although, depending on the set, they have to be wary of Hidden Power Fighting and even boosted Revelation Dance, especially if Oricorio-G is behind a Substitute. Cryogonal tanks everything Oricorio-G can throw at it, Recover any damage it takes, force it out, or cripple it with Toxic, and Frost Breath variants always beat Oricorio-G.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Lanturn, Eelektross, and Alolan Raichu can all pressure Oricorio-G rather easily, although they fail to do so if it has many boosts under its belt. Oricorio-E is another example, as it even has Dancer to copy Oricorio-G's Revelation Dance. However, Lanturn is setup fodder for bulky Oricorio-G after a certain number of boosts and Alolan Raichu fails to revenge kill Oricorio-G if it's behind a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types like Skuntank, Absol, and Alolan Raticate can all take out Oricorio-G with their STAB moves, and the former two can even revenge kill it with Sucker Punch, although Oricorio-G can play around it with Substitute. Alolan Persian outspeeds Oricorio-G and threatens it with Dark Pulse, although it can struggle to break through Oricorio-G if it has boosted several times, and none of these Pokemon can safely switch into it.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Pokemon like Stoutland, Dodrio, and Simisear can pressure Oricorio-G rather easily, although they can't switch in, and the former is slower than it, which means that it can still get KOed by a boosted attack. Simisear also can't break through a boosted Oricorio-G.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status, especially Toxic, greatly cripples Oricorio-G and gives it a way harder time checking threats like Gurdurr and Victreebel and stallbreaking. However, it can shut down status move users like Gastrodon, Mudsdale, Jellicent, and Audino with Taunt or Substitute and use them as setup fodder.</p>",

      "Bulky Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Roost allows Oricorio-G to consistently check threats like Gurdurr and Victreebel and stallbreak. It also allows Oricorio-G to negate Stealth Rock damage. Taunt allows Oricorio-G to beat threats it wouldn't be able to beat otherwise, such as Audino, Articuno, and Lanturn, as it prevents them from using recovery moves and crippling Oricorio-G with Toxic.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature alongside the Speed investment allows Oricorio-G to outspeed Qwilfish and anything slower, like Stoutland, and the leftover EVs are put into HP and Defense. Flyinium Z, when used alongside Hurricane, allows Oricorio-G to break through threats like Skuntank and Audino with a boosted Supersonic Skystrike as well as ignore Hurricane's poor accuracy. Alternatively, Rocky Helmet chips down physical attacking threats like Kangaskhan but especially U-turn and Knock Off users like Primeape and Gurdurr. Leftovers can also be used, as the passive recovery means it isn't forced to use Roost as often. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 168 Def / 88 Spe along with a Timid nature allows Oricorio-G to outspeed Adamant Skuntank while giving it more bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Oricorio-G should be used as a switch-in to Pokemon like Victreebel, Gurdurr, and Lurantis and set up on them. This set can also use defensive behemoths like Clefairy, Audino, and Altaria as setup fodder thanks to Taunt. Oricorio-G should use Pokemon it forces out to either set up or attack; against teams with frail switch-ins and checks like Carracosta, it should set up with Calm Mind to pressure the opponent, while against teams with a sturdy switch-in like Regirock, it should aim to wear it down beforehand. It's extremely important to keep Oricorio-G healthy so it can consistently check the threats it's supposed to check, so it should use Roost against threats it forces out or that can't hit it, like Gurdurr and Bellossom. It can also use Roost to take neutral damage from Electric-type attacks from the likes of Lanturn and Eelektross. Lastly, status, especially Toxic from the likes of Gastrodon, Mudsdale, and Audino, should be avoided, as it greatly hinders Oricorio-G and gives it a hard time successfully stallbreaking or checking the threats it's supposed to check.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Oricorio-G greatly appreciates entry hazards from the likes of Regirock and Qwilfish, as they weaken its switch-ins and checks like Lanturn and Lycanroc. Regirock can use Toxic on opposing Regirock and appreciates Oricorio-G's ability to check Fighting-types and spinblock, while Qwilfish appreciates Oricorio-G checking Ground-types and spinblocking. Mudsdale is another good partner, as it can check Rock- and Electric-types like Aggron and Alolan Raichu for Oricorio-G. Oricorio-G also appreciates entry hazards removal, as Stealth Rock greatly hinders its ability to check threats like Victreebel and stallbreak. Hitmonchan and Skuntank are good partners due to this, and the former can also check Dark-types like Alolan Persian, while Skuntank appreciates Oricorio-G's ability to check Fighting- and Ground-types. Pokemon like Stoutland, which weakens bulky titans like Regirock and Eelektross and benefits from Oricorio-G's ability to check Fighting-types like Gurdurr, make for good partners. Stoutland can also Pursuit trap Pokemon such as Lanturn and the aforementioned Eelektross. Oricorio-G works well around Pokemon such as Aurorus, Lycanroc, and Alolan Persian that appreciate the likes of Audino, Lanturn, and Mudsdale weakened or KOed. Lycanroc can pressure threats like Skuntank, while Aurorus weakens Alolan Sandslash and Cryogonal. Alolan Persian brings Oricorio-G on the field safely and benefits from Oricorio-G checking Fighting-types like Gurdurr and Hitmonchan. Fighting-types like Gurdurr, Poliwrath, and Primeape enjoy Oricorio-G's ability to check Pokemon like Victreebel. In exchange, they check Dark-, Ice-, and Rock-types like Alolan Raticate, Alolan Sandslash, and Lycanroc. Lastly, Pokemon like Drampa, Lanturn, and Gastrodon can switch into Electric-types like Eelektross, Alolan Raichu, and Rotom-F for Oricorio-G, and the latter two appreciate its ability to check Grass-types as well as Fighting-types for the former.</p>"

      "Offensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Revelation Dance is a secondary STAB move that hits Lanturn, Rotom-F, and Regirock neutrally, potentially allowing Oricorio-G to get past them once they're weakened. Roost provides Oricorio-G with more longevity, mitigating its Stealth Rock weakness and allowing it to better switch into threats such as Victreebel. Substitute makes the set function much more aggressively, dodging Sucker Punch from the likes of Skuntank and Absol and making Oricorio-G more difficult to revenge kill.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Flyinium Z in conjunction with Hurricane gives Oricorio-G a strong nuke to break through defensive behemoths like Audino and Articuno. It also ignores Hurricane's poor accuracy. Alternatively, Leftovers gives Oricorio-G a little more longevity and partly negates the damage taken while making a Substitute.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Oricorio-G should be used to wallbreak early- to mid-game against teams that lack a strong defensive switch-in like Regirock, but it can also be used as a sweeper against slower teams that don't. It should use Calm Mind when it forces out threats such as Ferroseed, Tangela, and Gurdurr. It can also set up on Pokemon that can't threaten it if it's running Substitute, such as Mudsdale, Audino, and Altaria. The first thing Oricorio-G should do when facing offensive teams with no defensive switch-in is to use Substitute, as it allows Oricorio-G to avoid getting revenge killed by faster threats like Dodrio and Alolan Persian. While this set is more offensive, Oricorio-G can make use of its decent defensive typing to pivot into threats like Primeape and Victreebel, although it doesn't appreciate switching into their attacks if it isn't running Roost and has to be wary of Primeape's Stone Edge. Since it can only be used once, the Z-Move should be used very carefully to break through extremely bulky walls like Type: Null and Articuno. Oricorio-G can switch into a predicted Rapid Spin from users like Hitmonchan and Choice Scarf Kabutops, although it should be careful, as they can both hit it with a super effective move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Oricorio-G fits very well on teams based around stacking entry hazards, as it can spinblock thanks to its Ghost typing. It also greatly appreciates entry hazards weakening bulky titans like Regirock and Lanturn. Qwilfish is an amazing partner due to this, as it can also deal with Rapid Spin users Oricorio-G can't deal with, such as Alolan Sandslash, and acts as a secondary check to Fighting-types. Pokemon like Regirock and Mudsdale also work well with it, as they check Rock-types like Lycanroc. Conversely, due to Oricorio-G's weakness to Stealth Rock, Pokemon that can remove entry hazards are greatly appreciated. Hitmonchan is a good example, as it can also deal with threats that force Oricorio-G out such as Alolan Persian and Lycanroc, while Oricorio-G takes advantage of threats Hitmonchan invites, like Musharna, in return. Skuntank and Cryogonal are other good examples, as the former can weaken Regirock, while the latter acts as a switch-in to Ice-types like Aurorus. Pokemon like Carracosta, Omastar, and Dodrio that appreciate Oricorio-G's ability to weaken walls such as Lanturn, Gastrodon, and Regirock make for good partners as well.</p>"

  "Wishiwashi": {
    "overview": "<p>Wishiwashi has the highest Special Attack stat in the tier, allowing it to 2HKO most Pokemon with its Choice Specs-boosted moves. Given its low Speed stat, great offensive capabilities, and the fact that it functions optimally with HP investment to avoid deactivating its School form, it works best with Trick Room support. While it has a shallow movepool, it has enough coverage to make it difficult to wall with standard Water-resistant Pokemon, as Hidden Power Grass 2HKOes Jellicent and non-Assault Vest Lanturn, U-turn OHKOes Jynx, and Ice Beam provides coverage against Pokemon like Drampa that are able to switch into a Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump. Its vulnerability to entry hazards coupled with its lack of reliable recovery options outside of Rest and Leftovers leaves it liable to being worn down to the point its ability Schooling is deactivated, which in turn causes Wishiwashi to become extremely passive. Even with full HP investment and high defenses, it is unable to take many neutral hits before it's forced out of School forme. Outside of Trick Room, Wishiwashi is very easy to KO or deactivate Schooling, as it's slow, forcing it to take a hit before attacking. Its weakness to common typings in Grass and Electric causes it to lose to Pokemon like Alolan Raichu when Trick Room is not active. While it is effective on its own right as a Trick Room sweeper, it is outclassed by Drampa and Beheeyem due to their superior coverage and ability to setup Trick Room, respectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Surf is an option over Hydro Pump, as it has more PP and does not miss, which can be beneficial because missing an attack can easily cause Wishiwashi to be taken out of School forme. However, the loss of power allows Pokemon such as Gurdurr and Kangaskhan to avoid an OHKO. 252 Speed EVs and a Modest nature can be used to work outside of Trick Room to outspeed uninvested base 60s, but Wishiwashi needs a great deal of support like Sticky Web, paralysis, or Tailwind to outspeed faster Pokemon, and the Speed investment causes a noticeable loss of bulk. Earthquake is an option over U-turn to guarantee a 2HKO on Lanturn, but it's already very likely 2HKOed by Hidden Power Grass after Stealth Rock damage, and losing U-turn prevents Wishiwashi from pivoting. It also allows Ground-immune Pokemon like Eelektross to revenge kill Wishiwashi for free, and it's only usable against specific Pokemon like Lanturn, as it's not boosted by Choice Specs and is coming off of an uninvested Attack stat. Aguav Berry heals 50% of Wishiwashi's health when it reaches 25% health, allowing it to avoid being taken out of School forme once, but this greatly reduces its damage output. Assault Vest increases Wishiwashi's special bulk and allows it to change moves but greatly reduces its damage output. Rest + Sleep Talk or Rest + Chesto Berry lets Wishiwashi recover its HP back to full but requires it to give up offensive coverage for it and wastes valuable Trick Room turns. Endeavor allows Wishiwashi to do great damage even outside of its School forme, but it cannot afford to give up a moveslot for the move. A physically based set can be used to make use of Wishiwashi's high Attack stat, but its physical movepool is lacking, as Waterfall is significantly weaker than Hydro Pump, and it has very limited physical coverage moves, being limited to Earthquake, Iron Tail, U-turn, and Return, making it much easier to wall. Life Orb is an option over Choice Specs to allow Wishiwashi to hit as hard as possible without being locked into moves, but the recoil from Life Orb makes Wishiwashi even easier to wear down to deactivate Schooling.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-immune Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Jellicent, Poliwrath, and Jynx are immune to Water-type moves, and they can easily capitalize on this by pivoting into Wishiwashi's Choice-locked Hydro Pump and setting up or inflicting status on it or its teammates afterwards. Additionally, until they have been KOed, their presence prevents Wishiwashi from safely wallbreaking with Hydro Pump and can force it into using its weaker coverage options.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon</strong>: Grass-types like Abomasnow and Ludicolo are threatening for Wishiwashi. Abomasnow survives an Ice Beam and can use Giga Drain to recover enough health to take another one while being almost guaranteed to deactivate Schooling. Ludicolo is 2HKOed by Ice Beam and U-turn but avoids a 2HKO from Hydro Pump and can use Giga Drain to restore the lost health and likely deactivate Schooling.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Wishiwashi is very slow and struggles to do much when Trick Room isn't active. Without Trick Room, faster Pokemon with a type advantage over Wishiwashi like Victreebel and Alolan Raichu can outspeed it and OHKO it with their STAB moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>A STAB-boosted Hydro Pump with Choice Specs coming from a massive Special Attack stat allows Wishiwashi to 2HKO even Water-resistant Pokemon like Drampa and Abomasnow. Ice Beam is used for hitting Dragon- and Grass-types that can take a Hydro Pump such as Altaria and Ludicolo. Hidden Power Grass hits Pokemon that resist both Hydro Pump and Ice Beam such as Jellicent, Poliwrath, and Lanturn. U-turn is used in the final slot to preserve momentum on predicted switches and to ease prediction against opposing teams with Water-immune Pokemon like Poliwrath. It will also OHKO Jynx on the switch, which is able to freely switch into Wishiwashi's other moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Quiet nature makes Wishiwashi as fast as possible under Trick Room. 1 Speed IV is required for Hidden Power Grass. Choice Specs is the preferred item, as it allows Wishiwashi to hit incredibly hard with Hydro Pump.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to bring Wishiwashi in safely while Trick Room is active with moves such as U-turn, Healing Wish, and Explosion to prevent Wishiwashi from being taken below 25% HP, deactivating Schooling. Use Wishiwashi early-game to break down the opposing team to enable another teammate such as Crabominable to sweep. Hydro Pump should be used most of the time for its incredible Base Power, and it should only be using its other moves on Pokemon that avoid the 2HKO from Hydro Pump, like Ludicolo. Be wary of using Hydro Pump if the opponent has Pokemon with Water immunities, such as Jellicent and Jynx, as they can take advantage of Wishiwashi being locked into Hydro Pump. Against these Pokemon, it's a good idea to use U-turn to scout the opponent's reaction and preserve momentum, as Trick Room is a hyper offensive playstyle and cannot afford to lose momentum. If Wishiwashi is about to reach 25% health and transform out of School forme, it is better to sacrifice it so it doesn't become setup fodder for the opposing team unless Wishiwashi has access to Healing Wish from Pokemon such as Audino. Schooling only activates at the end of the turn, so even if Wishiwashi is brought below 25% health, it is still able to act in its School forme for that turn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wishiwashi requires Trick Room active to function but is unable set it up itself, so it needs support to do so. Pokemon such as Carbink have access to both Stealth Rock and Trick Room and can use Explosion to safely bring Wishiwashi in during Trick Room turns. Musharna and Audino also have access to both Trick Room and Healing Wish. Other Trick Room attackers such as Crabominable appreciate Wishiwashi's wallbreaking ability for a late-game sweep. Crabominable helps Wishiwashi by breaking down special walls like Type: Null, which can wall Wishiwashi. Ursaring beats Lanturn and Type: Null, which can be problematic for Wishiwashi, while absorbing status and being able to clean up teams weakened by Wishiwashi with Facade.</p>"

  "Mudsdale": {
    "overview": "<p>Mudsdale is a great defensive Stealth Rock setter, using its solid bulk, Stamina, and Ground typing to keep massive threats such as Aggron, Lycanroc, Kangaskhan, Scyther, and Stoutland in check. Because of Mudsdale's high Attack and powerful STAB Earthquake, it has decent offensive presence and is far less passive than other defensive Stealth Rock setters like Regirock and Clefairy are. Mudsdale's usable coverage options and previously mentioned high Attack also allow it to function as a decent wallbreaker with Choice Band. However, Mudsdale suffers from a low Speed of 35, meaning that it will likely take damage before it can use an attack. Its excellent Ground typing also comes with weaknesses to common types such as Water, Grass, and Ice. Mudsdale lacks recovery outside of Rest and recovery items in Leftovers and Figy Berry, meaning that despite its good bulk and ability, it is prone to getting worn down by repeated attacks, status, and entry hazards. Finally, with an overall shallow movepool, Mudsdale is also fairly predictable and is considered a mediocre wallbreaker despite its high Attack, as all of its moves can easily be played around.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An Assault Vest set can be run with a similar spread to the Choice Band set as a bulkier option; however, the power difference is noticeable. Mudsdale's low Speed warrants a mention for its use on a dedicated Trick Room team, though it requires support to break through certain walls and is outclassed by Marowak.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water- and Grass-types</strong>: Pokemon like offensive Lanturn, Jellicent, Abomasnow, and Ludicolo all can do massive damage to Mudsdale before it can attack, though none like switching into Toxic or offensive moves from the Choice Band set. Defensively, Tangela walls the Choice Band set and can hit back hard, but also needs to watch out for Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Strong Ice-types like Rotom-F and Abomasnow are able to threaten Mudsdale with their STAB moves, but only Rotom-F is able to switch into the Choice Band set if Mudsdale locks itself into Earthquake or Heavy Slam.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Because Stamina only affects Defense, special attackers in general can easily wear Mudsdale down, with Drampa and Omastar in particular being able to threaten to OHKO Mudsdale.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Toxic whittles foes down, which is especially useful against bulkier or Ground-immune Pokemon such as Tangela, Eelektross and Torterra. Rock Slide hits Ground-resistant Pokemon like Cryogonal, Oricorio-E, Haunter, and Abomasnow. Protect allows Toxic damage to stack, provides a turn of Leftovers recovery, wastes weather and Trick Room turns, and scouts moves of Choice item users like Aurorus. Roar forces the foe out, which helps wear down the opposing team when combined with hazards. It can also be used to remove stat boosts from setup Pokemon like Gurdurr and Type: Null as well as force out standard switch-ins like Poliwrath and Haunter.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP and 172 Defense EVs along with an Impish nature allow Mudsdale to take physical hits such as a Choice Band Return from Stoutland and Choice Scarf Kabutops's Liquidation after Stealth Rock, and then take another after a Stamina boost. The rest of the EVs are placed into Special Defense to better take special attacks from Pokemon such as Oricorio-E. Specifically it helps Mudsdale avoid the 2HKO from Eelektross's Giga Drain after Stealth Rock. Stamina furthers this by boosting Mudsdale's Defense every time it takes a hit. Figy Berry can be used as a single-use form of recovery that can restore a substantial amount of health after Mudsdale gets worn down or potentially allow Mudsdale to avoid a 2HKO, notably helping it beat Stoutland. Leftovers gives Mudsdale a residual form of recovery, making it harder to wear down over time. Rocky Helmet supplies another form of residual damage on top of Stealth Rock and Toxic that can chip physical attackers like Kangaskhan and is especially useful for U-turn users like Scyther and Primeape while Yache Berry lets Mudsdale lure Ice-types like Aurorus and Subzero Slammer Alolan Sandslash, but both Rocky Helmet and Yache Berry leave Mudsdale with no form of recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mudsdale should be used throughout the game to switch into physical attacks from Pokemon like Scyther, Skuntank, and Aggron. However, it has to watch out for status-inflicting moves like Alolan Dugtrio's Toxic, and other utility moves such as Gurdurr's Knock Off. Mudsdale can switch into weaker moves such as Kangaskhan's Fake Out and Hitmonchan's Rapid Spin to receive a relatively free Defense boost from Stamina and supply chip damage if running Rocky Helmet. It can also absorb Volt Switch from Pokemon such as Eelektross, stopping them from switching, but still has to watch out for coverage and utility moves. Stay wary of how easily Mudsdale can be worn down if constantly switching in to take hits, especially if layers of Spikes or Toxic Spikes are on the field. When brought in against Pokemon that are threatened by it, Mudsdale will often force a switch. You can use this as an opportunity to set up Stealth Rock, allowing it to start chipping the opposing team. If Stealth Rock is already up, you can use Toxic on predicted switch-ins like Tangela and Eelektross, double switch to an ideal matchup to gain momentum, or use Roar for chip damage. However, it is notable that while Roar may put you in an ideal matchup, it can also favor the opponent by bringing in a threat to Mudsdale such as Victreebel or Jellicent instead. While Rock Slide may usually be your best option against Flying-types such as Oricorio-G and Swanna, they will often use Roost if at low health, losing their Rock weakness in the process. They also lose their Ground immunity, however, which you can use to create mind games or even potentially KO them with Earthquake. Protect can be used throughout the match to get Leftovers recovery, wear foes down with Toxic, waste turns of weather and Trick Room, and scout Choice item users such as Drampa, but the opponent can predict Protect and use the turn to get a free switch. Setup sweepers like Omastar and Alolan Sandslash can also use Protect or a predicted switch as a chance to set up, so an option is to instead use Roar or go for the KO, although at the risk of them instead simply attacking.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Water-types such as Lanturn, Jellicent, and Poliwrath can help against Ice- and Water-types like Aurorus and Floatzel, with Lanturn also supporting Mudsdale with Heal Bell and providing momentum with Volt Switch. In return, Mudsdale can absorb Electric attacks for Jellicent and Poliwrath. Flying-types like Oricorio-G and Articuno can soak up Grass-type hits from the likes of Torterra and Victreebel for Mudsdale, and appreciate Mudsdale tanking Rock- and Electric-type attacks in return. Oricorio-G can also act as a spinblocker for Mudsdale, and appreciates Mudsdale's ability to lure and poison Eelektross, giving Oricorio-G an opportunity to set up.</p> <p>Grass-types such as Lurantis, Ludicolo, and Victreebel can help with Water- and opposing Grass-types like Carracosta and Tangela, while Mudsdale can check Poison- and Steel-types like Skuntank and Metang. Mudsdale works well on entry hazard stacking teams due to its combination of Stealth Rock and Roar, making Spikes setters such as Qwilfish and Ferroseed good teammates. Qwilfish in particular can use Taunt to block Defog from the likes of Altaria and Silvally-Fairy, pressure other Taunt users like Jellicent and setup sweepers like Gurdurr, and can carry various other utility options such as Toxic Spikes and Will-O-Wisp. In return, Mudsdale can serve as a check to some of their threats like special Skuntank and Hitmonchan. Furthermore, setup sweepers like Omastar and Simisear and wallbreakers such as Aggron and Aurorus appreciate that these hazards, or just Mudsdale's Stealth Rock, can weaken foes to KO range. Due to how often Mudsdale switches in throughout the match, hazard removers like Rotom-F and Cryogonal are vital. Rotom-F can check Water- and Grass- types like Jellicent and Torterra that pressure Mudsdale, and Cryogonal can check check special attackers like Victreebel and Aurorus while appreciating Mudsdale's resistance to Rock. Other specially defensive Pokemon like Eelektross can also help with these special attackers and benefit from Mudsdale's good matchup against physical threats like Stoutland and Primeape, forming a solid defensive core.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Heavy Slam is able to do a huge amount of damage to Pokemon that may feel safe switching into an Earthquake like Abomasnow. Rock Slide is used to hit other Flying-types such as Swanna and the Oricorio formes. Close Combat offers a better way to hit Levitate users that resist Heavy Slam, namely Eelektross and Bronzor. Toxic can be used to punish foes that could normally safely switch into Mudsdale like Tangela and wear them down for later, though being locked into Toxic can leave Mudsdale exploited by setup sweepers like Bellossom and Oricorio-G if they also carry Safeguard or Substitute.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band increases Mudsdale's Attack to allow it to become one of the most powerful physical attackers in the tier and serve as a decent wallbreaker. An Adamant nature maximizes Mudsdale's Attack stat and still allows it to outspeed Pokemon like Audino, Eelektross, and Regirock while also outspeeding neutral natured Carracosta and OHKOing it with Earthquake before Carracosta can attack Mudsdale back. Stamina is Mudsdale's preferred ability, allowing it to check weaker physical attackers by raising its Defense after being hit.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mudsdale is best used as an early-game wallbreaker to do heavy damage to bulkier Pokemon so that the rest of its team can clean late-game. It functions as a stop to Volt Switch with its Ground typing but has to be cautious of super effective coverage that many Electric-types carry. Its Stamina ability can also be used to help it take on physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Hitmonchan fairly well. If Mudsdale is used in the later portion of a game, it will want to come in on something fairly weak and just try to get off as much damage as possible. It should be wary of locking itself into a move if a Pokemon with a resistance or an immunity to that move is still on the opposing team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Like most offensive Pokemon, Mudsdale appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Qwilfish, Regirock, and Ferroseed to help wear down its checks. Dedicated Water- and Grass-type checks are also good partners to help take on those attacks aimed at Mudsdale. Powerful Fire-types like Combusken and Simisear function well with Mudsdale, as they can help break Grass-types like Tangela, while Mudsdale checks Rock- and Ground-type attacks aimed at them. The best kind of partners for Mudsdale in general are faster Pokemon that appreciate having specially defensive walls broken through. Alolan Persian, Alolan Raichu, and Simisear are all options for this. Setup sweepers like Swords Dance Silvally formes and Turtonator also appreciate Mudsdale's ability to break through their checks like Regirock and Lanturn, respectively. Having hazard control can help Mudsdale survive longer. Swanna is an option for this, as it also handles Qwilfish.</p>"

  "Lurantis": {
    "overview": "<p>Lurantis is a good utility choice for teams with its decent defensive typing, good support options, access to the ability Contrary and most importantly access to Defog. A pure Grass typing, decent mixed defenses and Aromatherapy allows Lurantis to consistently switch into the majority of the hazard setters in the tier, including the most popular choices in Regirock, Mudsdale and Torterra, and clear their entry hazards. A pure Grass-typing also allows Lurantis to switch into Ground- and Water-type attacks from the likes of Alolan Dugtrio and Floatzel without much trouble, sponging attacks for teammates. On top of all of that, Lurantis is not as passive as most other Defog users, as it is capable of boosting its stats with Leaf Storm and Superpower through Contrary. However, Lurantis faces strong competition from other hazard removers with more utility, such as Skuntank, who is immune to Psychic-type moves and absorbs Toxic Spikes, or Hitmonchan, who boasts a superior Speed stat and can check special attackers like Cryogonal and Simisear. Lurantis also struggles with weaknesses to common attacking types, such as Fire and Flying from threats like Simisear and Oricorio-G, as well as reliance on low-PP moves like Leaf Storm and Aromatherapy.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Physically based defensive Lurantis is an option to utilize its higher Attack stat and boasts powerful options like Superpower and Knock Off; however, due to the low power of STAB Leaf Blade and the Contrary Special Attack boosts of Leaf Storm, specially oriented Lurantis actually outputs more damage faster even with Superpower factored in. Specially defensive Lurantis is also an option to better take potential Water- and Electric-type hits from threats such as Lanturn, but physically defensive Lurantis is preferred due to the overall benefit of being able to freely switch in on the many powerful Ground-types in the tier such as Golurk. Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit Oricorio-E and Victreebel, but it's generally a suboptimal option and leaves Lurantis walled by Alolan Sandslash. A set with Rest and Sleep Talk is also a possibility for slowly bolstering Lurantis's stats, but forces Lurantis into using one attack or foregoing Defog. Giga Drain is also an option, giving Lurantis a second STAB attack with more PP and healing utility, but is not recommended over Toxic, Superpower or Aromatherapy, all of which are more useful in more situations. A Relaxed nature is also an option to not lower the damage of Superpower, but doing so means that Lurantis no longer outspeeds threats such as Throh.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type threats such as Simisear resist Lurantis's Leaf Storm and can force it out with a super effective STAB attack of their own, though they fear Superpower or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Oricorio-E resist Grass and can force Lurantis out with super effective Flying-type attacks or in some cases even set up directly in front of it.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Skuntank and Victreebel resist Leaf Storm and are immune to Toxic and can force out Lurantis with super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes</strong>: Toxic Spikes are a good way to cripple Lurantis, as Lurantis rarely finds time to not only Defog away the Toxic Spikes but also cure its own status with Aromatherapy before being forced out. Qwilfish can even Taunt Lurantis, preventing it from taking either action, and Roselia can threaten to 2HKO it with Sludge Bomb and set up both Spikes and Toxic Spikes in its face.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Lurantis has decent defenses but is not particularly bulky. As a result, even neutral attacks from a strong attacker such as Choice Band Stoutland can overwhelm Lurantis. Strong special attacks from the likes of Drampa and Aurorus can even threaten an OHKO with Draco Meteor and Blizzard respectively, hitting on Lurantis's weaker special side.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog is the main reason to use Lurantis, and it removes entry hazards from the entire field. Leaf Storm combined with Contrary gives Lurantis a strong STAB option that also increases Special Attack to keep Lurantis from being passive. Superpower is the preferred option in the third slot, as it can increase Lurantis's Defense and provides excellent coverage to hit common Grass-resistant Pokemon such as Alolan Sandslash and Ferroseed. Alternatively, Toxic can also be used to get reliable chip damage on most switch-ins like Eelektross. The last move is typically Aromatherapy, as Lurantis is taking negligable damage from the hazard setters it intends to switch into, such as Qwilfish and Metang, and Aromatherapy allows it to cure itself of status, easing switches into these same hazard setters. Alternatively, Synthesis can be used to allow Lurantis to switch into less passive physical attackers like Choice Scarf Kabutops, but Aromatherapy is generally preferred as Lurantis will often find itself being worn down by Toxic otherwise.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers is chosen as the item, giving Lurantis a steady stream of healing that allows it to switch into weaker or resisted attacks, such as Regirock's Rock Slide or Mudsdale's Earthquake, without being forced to recover. Contrary should always be the ability, as the snowball effect Lurantis generates with Leaf Storm and Superpower is one of the stronger benefits of using Lurantis.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Send Lurantis directly into hazard setters like Ferroseed and Torterra and use the free turns Lurantis generates as they switch out to Defog away entry hazards or cure itself of status with Aromatherapy. If the opponent is using a hazard setter that Lurantis can not switch into, such as Aggron or Roselia, try to conserve Lurantis and find an opportunity to bring it in against more passive Pokemon, such as Tangela, or against Pokemon it can immediately threaten, like defensive Jellicent or Poliwrath. It is important to remember that, even with Leaf Storm, Lurantis is not a wallbreaker or sweeper. The boosted Special Attack very rarely results in a sweep and instead finds a primary purpose in warding away less bulky attackers that may want to try and set up or other threats that may try to take advantage of Lurantis's perceived passivity such as Gurdurr. Lurantis is forced out by many threats in the tier, so making use of the turn that Lurantis is out by predicting threats to switch in and using the appropriate move is key to Lurantis's success.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teammates that patch Lurantis's weaknesses are always a good option, so teammates such as Lanturn for helping with the Fire and Flying weaknesses or Metang to cover the Poison weakness work well. Lurantis generally lets in common Grass-type switch-ins, such as Victreebel and Oricorio-E, so teammates that can take advantage of these switch-ins, such as Drampa and Rotom-F, are beneficial. Lurantis is a fairly reliable hazard removal option, and as such, Pokemon that appreciate having hazards removed like Jynx and Oricorio-G appreciate Lurantis's presence. Lurantis also acts as a reliable Ground- and Water-resistant Pokemon, so Fire-types such as Combusken and Simisear are excellent choices, as are Rock-types like Lycanroc and Aggron, with Lycanroc in particular having strong synergy with Lurantis, pressuring the Fire-, Ice-, Flying- and Bug-types that Lurantis struggles with. Volt Switch and U-turn users like Eelektross, Lanturn and Primeape work well with Lurantis, with Lanturn and Primeape notably luring in and pivoting on defensive Pokemon like Ferroseed and Mudsdale that Lurantis can abuse. Lurantis will also occasionally get rid of your own hazards, so having a reliable Stealth Rock setter like Regirock or Mudsdale is ideal.</p>"

  "Shiinotic": {
    "overview": "<p>Shiinotic carries a small niche in the PU tier as a strong wallbreaker with access to a spammable, strong STAB move in Moonblast along with a secondary STAB move in Giga Drain and coverage in Hidden Power Fire. This, combined with a solid Grass / Fairy typing, lets it check Water- and Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan and Water-types such as Jellicent. However, a low Speed stat plus mediocre HP and Defense stats means that Shiinotic is prone to being overwhelmed by faster threats such as Stoutland and Skuntank. This, combined with the fact that Shiinotic has an average Special Attack stat, means that it struggles to break past special walls such as Audino and Clefairy. Shiinotic also faces competition from other Grass-type wallbreakers such as Victreebel, which boast higher Special Attack and are faster.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A physically defensive spread with moves such as Leech Seed and Strength Sap can be used to better check physical attackers such as Gurdurr, but such a role is done better by Tangela thanks to its superior bulk, Regenerator, and access to utility moves such as Knock Off. Energy Ball is a stronger Grass STAB option, but the added power isn't worth giving up the recovery Giga Drain can provide.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Because of Shiinotic's low Speed, Pokemon such as Aurorus, Scyther, and Simisear can force it out with their super effective STAB attacks or set up in the case of the latter two, although none of these Pokemon can safely switch in.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Alolan Sandslash, Aggron, Metang, and Probopass all resist Moonblast and can force Shiinotic out with their super effective moves or proceed to set up Stealth Rock as Shiinotic switches out, but Alolan Sandslash has to be wary of switching in on a predicted Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Roselia resists both of Shiinotic's STAB moves and can easily take Hidden Power Fire and proceed to knock it out with Sludge Bomb, set up a layer of Spikes, or heal off any damage with Synthesis. Skuntank can't switch in on Moonblast but can outspeed and OHKO it with Poison Jab or Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Audino and Type: Null can take Moonblast with ease and heal off the damage with Wish and Rest, respectively. The former can also remove Shiinotic's Choice Specs with Knock Off, making its attacks significantly weaker.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Moonblast is Shiinotic's most spammable move, doing a great deal of damage to Fighting-, Dragon-, and Dark-types such as Gurdurr, Drampa, and Alolan Persian. Giga Drain is Shiinotic's Grass-type STAB move, hitting Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types such as Mudsdale, Regirock, and Lanturn while also providing Shiinotic with semi-reliable recovery. Hidden Power Fire hits Steel-types such as Alolan Sandslash and Metang, which resist Shiinotic's dual STAB moves and would otherwise wall it. Spore cripples switch-ins to Shiinotic such as Audino with sleep, allowing teammates to take advantage and set up.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>164 Speed EVs allow Shiinotic to outspeed uninvested base 50 Speed Pokemon such as Audino and Regirock. Effect Spore lets Shiinotic punish physical attackers like Hitmonchan with a 30% chance to inflict either paralysis, poison, or sleep when a foe makes contact.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Shiinotic in on weaker attacks such as Scald from Pokemon like Gastrodon or against Pokemon that can't do much to Shiinotic such as Hitmonchan, Regirock, and Mudsdale. Because of the nature of this set, it's best used as an early-game wallbreaker that spams Moonblast, as it has few drawbacks. Be mindful of what move Shiinotic locks itself into. Locking itself into Giga Drain means that Flying-types such as Dodrio and Oricorio-E can set up on it, whereas locking itself into Hidden Power Fire allows Rock- and Fire-types such as Lycanroc and Simisear to set up as well. You can freely click Spore if you predict a Pokemon such as Audino to come in to take a hit to put it to sleep, but be careful of opposing Grass-types such as Abomasnow and Sap Sipper Drampa, as they are immune to Spore; however, they cannot directly switch in otherwise.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set works better on balance and offensive teams looking for a hard-hitting wallbreaker as well as a Water- and Fighting-type check. U-turn, Volt Switch, and Parting Shot support from Pokemon such as Lanturn, Scyther, and Alolan Persian pairs well with Shiinotic, allowing it to come in safely. These Pokemon also appreciate Shiinotic's ability to handle Rock-, Ground-, and Fighting-types in return. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Regirock, Ferroseed, and Qwilfish make for solid partners for Shiinotic, wearing down its switch-ins and aiding in getting specific KOs. Examples include OHKOing specially defensive variants of Alolan Sandslash with Hidden Power Fire after Stealth Rock and guaranteeing the OHKO on Skuntank with Moonblast after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. Qwilfish can also use Thunder Wave to make up for Shiinotic's low Speed. Regirock appreciates Shiinotic checking Water- and Ground-types for it, while Shiinotic appreciates Regirock checking Flying- and Fire-types such as Dodrio and Simisear. Setup sweepers such as Dodrio and Lycanroc appreciate Shiinotic weakening Rock- and Ground-types for them. The former can check Pokemon such as Scyther, whereas the latter can check Flying-types such as Oricorio-E and Dodrio while weakening Steel-types such as Alolan Sandslash and Metang with Drill Run. These Pokemon also appreciate a free turn of setup if Shiinotic is running Spore. Physical wallbreakers such as Stoutland can break down special walls that Shiinotic struggles to break past such as Type: Null.</p>"

  "Pyukumuku": {
    "overview": "<p>Pyukumuku is the only viable Pokemon in PU to hold the Unaware ability, and stands its ground as a particularly useful pick for stall teams by using this niche to easily handle a variety of threatening setup sweepers that would ordinarily present a tough challenge for the archetype, including but not limited to Simisear, Omastar, and Alolan Sandslash. In addition to Unaware, access to Block and Recover allows Pyukumuku to distinguish itself from other bulky Water-types like Jellicent and Lanturn by threatening to immediately remove defensive Pokemon like Altaria and Regirock with Spite or Toxic, while its competition can only force them out at best. However, Pyukumuku has no offensive presence whatsoever, and is reliant on residual damage to take out its foes. As a result, Pyukumuku and its benefits are restricted to stall teams, as other archetypes are unable to offer suitable support to cover Pyukumuku's passive nature and weakness to various strong breakers. Pyukumuku is also unable to take on any Taunt users and struggles to defeat Pokemon behind a Substitute, especially when not running Spite. As a result, other bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Poliwrath are far superior outside of stall builds, using unique utility options in Will-O-Wisp, Scald and Circle Throw to whittle down the same offensive threats that Pyukumuku is unable to touch.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Soak can be used to make Poison- and Steel-types vulnerable to Toxic, which prevents Pyukumuku from being utterly walled by them. However, it's simply not worth the trouble, as every Poison- or Steel-type can either break Pyukumuku regardless or get PP stalled by it. Counter allows Pyukumuku to remove stronger physical attackers like Stoutland and Aggron after taking a hit, which prevents them from exerting pressure on the rest of its team. However, it simply doesn't fit alongside Pyukumuku's main niche of trapping opposing Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt and Substitute Users</strong>: Because Pyukumuku lacks any attacking moves, Taunt and Substitute users like Oricorio-E, Oricorio-G and Crabominable can render Pyukumuku completely useless and force it out. The former two examples are able to turn Pyukumuku into setup fodder after using either Taunt or Substitute, while Crabominable can maintain its health with Drain Punch and do massive damage to Pyukumuku and its teammates with its powerful attacks. However, Z-Toxic bypasses Taunt, and can cripple said Taunt users unexpectedly.</p> <p><strong>Grass- and Electric-types</strong>: Grass- and Electric-types like Victreebel, Bellossom, Oricorio-E, Alolan Raichu, and Rotom-F have no trouble setting up on Pyukumuku or simply KOing it with their super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Toxic-immune Pokemon</strong>: Pyukumuku has no way to damage Pokemon that are immune to Toxic. This includes Steel-types such as Aggron, Poison-types such as Skuntank, and Magic Guard Clefairy. However, Pyukumuku can PP stall some Toxic-immune Pokemon regardless of its inability to damage them, especially if it opts to run Spite.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: While Pyukumuku's bulk is solid, stronger wallbreakers like Stoutland, Aggron, and Aurorus are capable of overwhelming it, especially in tandem with entry hazards.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Unaware Trapper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Block allows Pyukumuku to trap opposing Pokemon and either PP stall them with Spite and Rest or wear them down with Toxic. Toxic is Pyukumuku's only way to deal damage, but Spite allows it to trap Pokemon that can ignore Toxic damage, including opposing Rest users, Steel- and Poison-types, and Clefairy. While Rest may seem redundant alongside Recover, it allows Pyukumuku to trap and remove Toxic users such as Mudsdale and more effectively preserve PP while stalling other Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Unaware ignores stat changes, which prevents setup sweepers like Gurdurr, Omastar, and Combusken from capitalizing on Pyukumuku's passivity. Ghostium Z or Poisonium Z can be used depending on whether Pyukumuku opts for Spite or Toxic. The former allows Pyukumuku to fully recover any lost HP in a pinch, while the latter increases its Defense by one stage and enables it to more reliably stomach hits from physical threats. Z-Toxic can also be used to poison Taunt users such as Oricorio-E. Both options also make it immune to Trick and Switcheroo, which can be problematic for stall, though this is at the cost of losing out on Leftovers, which provides passive recovery, lessening the frequency at which Recover and Rest need to be used.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Block can sometimes come as a surprise to opponents and shouldn't be revealed until Pyukumuku is able to trap and KO an opposing Pokemon. Similarly, Z-Toxic has excellent surprise value in being able to status Taunt users that aren't expecting it and should be preserved until the time is right. Refrain from switching Pyukumuku in while entry hazards are up, as they can limit its ability to reliably check setup sweepers like Dodrio and physically offensive threats like Kangaskhan. Recover should be used frequently, as Pokemon such as Kangaskhan only need Pyukumuku slightly weakened to be able to 2HKO it. Pyukumuku is extremely passive, and as such can be easily exploited by setup sweepers capable of breaking through it such as Alolan Raichu and Shiftry. Be very careful to avoid opponents capitalizing on its nonexistent offenses.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pyukumuku can only reliably fit on stall teams in need of a switch-in to setup sweepers, as its sheer passivity would cost any other team too much momentum. Specially defensive Pokemon are great partners to have and complete a solid defensive core alongside Pyukumuku, as they are each capable of handling one another's checks. Audino is a notable example, being a staple on stall and providing useful cleric support to reduce the number of times that Pyukumuku has to use Recover and Rest. Grass- and Electric-types like Victreebel, Oricorio-E, and Alolan Raichu are capable of easily exploiting Pyukumuku, especially if it lacks Toxic. Therefore, checks like Articuno, Regirock, and Claydol are essential to have. Entry hazard removers such as Skuntank and the aforementioned Claydol and Articuno are important teammates to have as well, since Pyukumuku can be chipped by Spikes easily. Pyukumuku should not be a stall team's only physical wall, as strong Choice Band wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Aggron will break through it; a second wall such as Mudsdale or Regirock is vital.</p>"

  "Type: Null": {
    "overview": "<p>Type: Null is one of the bulkiest Pokemon in PU, blanket checking special attackers such as Alolan Raichu, Swanna, and Jynx. It also has usable physical bulk that not only can be boosted further by Iron Defense but also allows it to check weaker physical attackers like Skuntank, Floatzel, and Alolan Dugtrio. Although Type: Null's base Speed sits on the lower end of the spectrum, its access to U-turn lets it use said Speed to act as a slow and bulky pivot that creates many opportunities for teammates to be safely brought into the field. Alternatively, Swords Dance makes Type: Null a potent late-game sweeper that uses its defenses to set up with ease, with Battle Armor also coming into play by preventing critical hits, enhancing its sweeping opportunities. Type: Null's nature as a sturdy RestTalk user also makes it very reliable as a status absorber for its team. Unfortunately, Type: Null's reliance on its STAB attacks makes it dependent on Pursuit support to remove Ghost-types, and its Fighting weakness leaves it checked by powerful Pokemon like Gurdurr and Primeape. Furthermore, Eviolite is integral for checking stronger special attackers like Choice Specs Drampa and Aurorus, making Type: Null susceptible to Knock Off and Trick. Type: Null is often on the defensive when it needs to heal, allowing users of Taunt to easily stop it when it tries to use Rest. While it can beat certain Rock- and Steel-types due to them eventually being overpowered by boosted Return and outlasted by Type: Null's recovery, notable exceptions include Lycanroc, Omastar, Carracosta, and Aggron, which can all either use it as setup fodder or break through it firsthand. It can also face competition as a late-game sweeper with Calm Mind Spiritomb, which has a better defensive typing. Regardless, Type: Null is a nice bulky team player with decent role compression for a wide range of playstyles.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic is a solid catch-all tool for punishing bulky Pokemon and can pressure many Ghost- and Rock-type switch-ins. This does let Gurdurr activate Guts as it switches in, unfortunately, and Toxic also invites in Pokemon like Aggron and Qwilfish, which can handle both Toxic and Return. Punishment can pressure Ghost-type setup sweepers like bulky Calm Mind Oricorio-G and Calm Mind Spiritomb after some Calm Mind boosts but is a very inconsistent option otherwise. Hidden Power Ground with a Sassy nature has a chance to OHKO Aggron after Stealth Rock, hits Alolan Sandslash and Probopass hard, and punishes Omastar that tries to use Type: Null as setup fodder but forgoes pivoting or the ability to set up. Pursuit can be reliable for trapping frail Ghost- and Psychic-types like Haunter and Jynx, but it pales in comparison to U-turn with utility otherwise, and Type: Null still loses to Oricorio-G and Spiritomb.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Type: Null is walled by Ghost-types such as Sableye, Oricorio-G, and Jellicent due to its lack of a strong attack against them, rendering it completely forced out. Furthermore, many of them can disable Type: Null's form of recovery with Taunt, while other options like Haunter can cripple Type: Null entirely with Trick, although Life Orb variants will eventually KO themselves in a one-on-one scenario without Pain Split. Spiritomb and Oricorio-G can also use Type: Null as setup fodder with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Primeape, Hitmonchan, and Crabominable heavily punish Type: Null with their damage output thanks to their super effective STAB moves, although they won't appreciate constantly switching in on Return, nor will they have the adequate means of breaking past Iron Defense boosts. Pokemon like Gurdurr and Throh are much bulkier and can also pressure Type: Null by removing its Eviolite with Knock Off, using it as setup fodder with Bulk Up, or removing boosts with Circle Throw in Throh's case.</p> <p><strong>Rock- and Steel-types</strong>: While Rock- and Steel-types that resist Return can still be beaten given most lack the recovery needed to combat Swords Dance variants, the ones with offensive presence can usually overpower Type: Null in its setup process, whether it be breakers like Aggron and Choice Specs Aurorus or setup sweepers like Lycanroc, Alolan Sandslash, and Omastar. Barring Omastar and Aurorus, these Pokemon may experience problems breaking past Iron Defense variants, however. Regirock is notable for actively walling pivot variants all game and safely setting up Stealth Rock against them, but it loses to Swords Dance sets.</p> <p><strong>Loss of Eviolite</strong>: Without its Eviolite, Type: Null cannot use its bulk to reliably check stronger special attackers and is particularly vulnerable to being pressured by Pokemon it tries to check like Clefairy and Eelektross with Knock Off. Trick and Switcheroo Choice users such as Rotom-F and Floatzel are problematic for that same reason while also locking Type: Null into a move it uses.</p>",

      "Bulky Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn is strong tool for gaining momentum, pivoting out against faster Pokemon or unfavorable switch-ins like Regirock and Aggron. Rest is Type: Null's main form of recovery and can also cure all status ailments at the cost of falling asleep for a few turns. Sleep Talk lets Type: Null act while it is asleep, potentially letting it pivot out of Pokemon that try to take advantage of its status, allowing it to not be as passive.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite further increases Type: Null's defenses, allowing it to do its job defensively. 8 Defense EVs make for an even number that gives it two extra points thanks to the Eviolite boost. Battle Armor is great for making Type: Null more reliable as a wall, preventing critical hits from attackers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Type: Null should pivot into strong special attackers and users of status-inducing moves like Jynx, Lanturn, Swanna, and Altaria. Beyond that, generating momentum is Type: Null's other key role; U-turn is safe to use on predicted switches to avoid unfavorable matchups against either bulky Pokemon like Regirock and Qwilfish or Fighting-types that comfortably take Return like Gurdurr. From there, it should use that opportunity to get in wallbreakers or Pokemon that can threaten them out. In other cases, Return can be nice for consistent damage when not a lot of Pokemon that resist it are left. Using Rest when Type: Null is weakened is important to keep it healthy to check special attackers, force switches, and pivot around as much as it can. When asleep, finding opportunities to burn sleep turns is recommended, which can be done against the large number of Pokemon that Type: Null is not significantly damaged by. It is often able to safely use Sleep Talk without being too passive, as it can sometimes pivot out with U-turn. Lastly, Type: Null should be wary of foes with Knock Off or Trick and should play around users Taunt sparingly, as they can punish attempts to use Rest.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Type: Null's ability to blanket check special attackers and reliably pivot around allows it to support offensive and defensive teams alike. Wallbreakers such as Absol, Omastar, and Aurorus that appreciate safe switches are solid options, as they can take advantage of Ghost-types like Oricorio-G and Spiritomb. Fighting-type checks are top priority, which include Pokemon like Qwilfish and Scyther; Qwilfish can set up Spikes to chip down said Fighting-types, and Scyther appreciates Type: Null's ability to absorb status and can form a strong pivoting core alongside it. Pursuit trappers such as Skuntank and Spiritomb can help remove problematic Ghost-types especially the likes of Haunter and Oricorio-G. Other strong checks to Oricorio-G include Alolan Sandslash, Oricorio-E, and Lycanroc, which all appreciate Type: Null bringing them in safely with U-turn to apply offensive pressure on their own. Type: Null pairs well with other pivoting cores that can include Primeape, Lanturn, and Eelektross, all of which can use their own offensive typing, utility, and strong attacking moves to force switches. Physically defensive Pokemon like Tangela, Regirock, and Gurdurr form good defensive cores with Type: Null, as they can cushion hits from physical breakers like Aggron and Stoutland better. Entry hazard removers like Skuntank, Swanna, Rotom-F are solid, since Type: Null is a pivot that is vulnerable to Spikes and every other hazard. They can also threaten Qwilfish, which Type: Null often invites in for free, as well as support Type: Null in other ways, including Skuntank's Pursuit support, Swanna's STAB combination and special attacking prowess that lets it pressure Rock- and Fighting-types like Regirock, Aggron, and Hitmonchan, and Rotom-F's pivoting with its own Volt Switch. Pokemon that switch into Knock Off easily alleviate pressure for Type: Null; options include Rocky Helmet Oricorio-E, Silvally-Fairy, and Skuntank, which all pressure common Knock Off users like Gurdurr and Absol. Silvally-Fairy is also immune to Trick and Switcheroo, which can be useful for pivoting in certain instances.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rest gives Type: Null a recovery option at the cost of making it asleep for a few turns, restoring all health and curing status. Sleep Talk lets Type: Null use its moves while it's asleep to make it less passive, which can be great for accumulating Swords Dance boosts or firing off powerful Returns. Iron Defense increases Type: Null's Defense, allowing it to outlast physical attackers such as Hitmonchan and Aggron that can otherwise break through it. Using Iron Defense does, however, come with the drawback of being more passive and enabling Pokemon to take advantage of Type: Null due to forgoing Sleep Talk.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>8 Defense EVs make Type: Null's Defense an even number, which gives it additional Defense thanks to Eviolite. Eviolite helps to maximize Type: Null's bulk, giving it more durability and making its defensive role easier. Battle Armor complements Type: Null's defensive presence by preventing critical hits from attackers. This is especially good for this set, as Type: Null will be able to take advantage of its Iron Defense boosts much more safely.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Type: Null should prioritize on its defensive role of blanket checking special attackers like Jynx, Simisear, and Silvally-Dragon. Given Type: Null's ability to absorb status, pivoting into potential status-inducing moves from Pokemon like Jynx and Alolan Dugtrio early-game can alleviate pressure for teammates. Swords Dance can be used in many situations, whether it's to beat passive Pokemon like Clefairy and Altaria, take advantage of forced switches from special attackers, or attempt a late-game sweep. One must avoid attempting to sweep if Ghost-types are present, however. Luring in Ghost types via double switching and then Pursuit trapping them with partners like Skuntank can net a key advantage that can pave the way for a sweep. Capitalize on Fighting-type switch-ins by gradually weakening them down with repeated use of Return. Using Rest when Type: Null is low on health is always important to maintain opportunities to sweep and to check special attackers. It helps whenever possible to scout for Knock Off on Pokemon Type: Null is supposed to check, like Clefairy, as having its item removed drastically reduces its durability. Iron Defense can be great for outlasting checks like Hitmonchan and Aggron as well taking on the likes of Stoutland better, but be wary about giving up free turns, as sets without Sleep Talk are more prone to having their helplessness taken advantage of.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Checks to Fighting-types are important to have, especially checks to Gurdurr and Throh, since unlike most others they can overcome Iron Defense variants of Type: Null with their attacks and boosting moves. Bulky Oricorio-G and Jellicent are among the most reliable Fighting-type answers in general, and they can also also pressure other Pokemon like Qwilfish. Pursuit trappers, most notably Spiritomb and Skuntank, are extremely useful in removing Ghost-type Pokemon that would otherwise impede Type: Null's sweep. Flying checks that can account for Oricorio-G, such as Eelektross and Oricorio-E, are great to have for checking this high-profile threat to Type: Null. Pokemon that can deal with Type: Null's Normal-resistant checks include Mudsdale, Poliwrath, and Regirock, which can check Pokemon like Aggron, Lycanroc, and Omastar to varying degrees. Entry hazard control is ideal to alleviate the issue with chip damage that comes from Type: Null's lack of reliable recovery, with options like Lurantis, Skuntank, and Silvally-Water all sharing good synergy; Skuntank absorbs Toxic Spikes and traps Ghost-types, Lurantis beats Gurdurr and threatens Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon, and Silvally-Water also threatens Rock- and Steel-types, beats Qwilfish, and can pivot with Parting Shot. Physically defensive Pokemon like Tangela and Sableye are good Pokemon to fall back on when in need of cushions or checks to strong physical attackers. Knock Off sponges to preserve Type: Null's Eviolite such as Absol, Silvally-Fairy, and Poliwrath are good partners; Absol heavily punishes bulky Ghost-types like Sableye and Calm Mind Spiritomb, Silvally-Fairy is adept at checking Fighting-types and is immune to Trick and Switcheroo, and Poliwrath is potent at checking Aggron and threatening other Rock- and Steel-types. Swords Dance Type: Null can also really appreciate Toxic Spikes, since it helps wear down grounded Ghost types like Sableye and non-Rest Spiritomb throughout the match. Roselia and Qwilfish are prime setters and serve as decent Fighting-type checks.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Silvally-Dragon holds the niche of being an effective offensive Defogger that can pivot, using its respectable Speed to unleash powerful STAB Draco Meteors and gain momentum with Parting Shot when necessary. These attributes also help Silvally-Dragon differentiate itself from other Dragon-types in the tier such as Drampa and Turtonator. While these Pokemon also have secondary typings that add some useful resistances, they tack on extra weaknesses, which can be exploited in their matchup against Pokemon such as Hitmonchan and Torterra. However, Silvally-Dragon also lacks firepower because its ability and item are fixed, thus it is checked by a multitude of Pokemon such as Clefairy, Hitmonchan, and Probopass. Silvally-Dragon is also easy to whittle down over the course of the match, facing competition from other offensive entry hazard removers such as Swanna, Skuntank, and Alolan Sandslash. Furthermore, Silvally-Dragon's main attacking move, Draco Meteor, lowers its Special Attack by two stages with each use, allowing bulky Pokemon such as Calm Mind Oricorio-E to come in on a -2 Silvally-Dragon and start setting up. This also means that Silvally-Dragon can't stay in and threaten the opposing team for multiple turns.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flash Cannon beats certain Fairy-types such as Carbink and Mr. Mime while also nailing Aurorus; however, it requires hitting Silvally-Fairy on the switch safely while not breaking through Clefairy, and Silvally-Dragon doesn't typically have room for it. A physical set utilizing Swords Dance, Multi-Attack, Iron Head, and Flame Charge rounds out Silvally-Dragon's coverage perfectly. However, this set isn't as effective, since it doesn't have room for a pivoting move to gain momentum with, and PU, in general, has fewer specially defensive walls. A physical set does, however, lure and defeat Clefairy, one of Silvally-Dragon's greatest switch-ins. Although it isn't blocked by Clear Body or Soundproof users such as Regirock, Carbink, and Mr. Mime, U-turn doesn't have nearly the same pivoting potential as Parting Shot and is extremely weak uninvested. Grass Pledge notably hits Gastrodon, Lanturn, and Carbink but does little else otherwise. Similarly, Toxic cripples Gastrodon, Lanturn, and Eelektross, but Silvally-Dragon finds it difficult to find an open moveslot for it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Clefairy, Carbink, and Silvally-Fairy are all immune to Draco Meteor and take little to nothing from Flamethrower. Carbink and Mr. Mime are even able to prevent Parting Shot with their respective Clear Body and Soundproof abilities. Clefairy and Carbink are able to use Silvally-Dragon as setup bait with either Calm Mind or Stealth Rock or both in Clefairy's case.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive walls such as Audino, Cryogonal, and Jellicent all prove difficult for Silvally-Dragon to muscle through and beat it one-on-one. Type: Null and Munchlax can even use Silvally-Dragon as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Alolan Sandslash under hail and Choice Scarf Aurorus, Jynx, and Abomasnow are all able to outspeed Silvally-Dragon and OHKO it with their strong Ice-type STAB moves; however, they cannot reliably switch into its attacks.

      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is  Silvally-Dragon's strongest and only special STAB move, always 2HKOing Spiritomb after Stealth Rock at the cost of bringing itself to -4 Special Attack. Flamethrower hits certain Steel-types such as Alolan Sandslash, Metang, Ferroseed and Alolan Dugtrio super effectively and rounds off Silvally-Dragon's coverage by hitting every Pokemon in the tier neutrally with the exception of Carbink. Defog removes entry hazards, easing pressure off of the entire team and Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock such as Simisear and Pinsir. Parting Shot grabs momentum by lowering the Attack and Special Attack of Pokemon such as Hitmonchan and Type: Null whenever Silvally-Dragon is in an unfavorable matchup, allowing it to pivot into a teammate better equipped to handle specially defensive threats. Parting Shot also makes a good hit-and-run tactic, especially since Draco Meteor lowers Silvally-Dragon's Special Attack with each use.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>RKS System is the mandatory ability for Silvally-Dragon, allowing the customization of its typing via its Dragon Memory.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because of its lack of recovery, Silvally-Dragon should only try to switch into resisted hits from the likes of Shiftry and Eelektross. Certain Steel-types such as Aggron still take nearly 50% from Draco Meteor, so if the opponent doesn't have a Fairy-type, using Draco Meteor may prove a safer play than trying to predict the Steel-type coming in and going for Flamethrower. When the opponent has a bulkier Steel-type such as Mawile, Probopass, Metang, or Bronzor, Flamethrower becomes the safer play. If the opposing Pokemon is at low health, using Flamethrower is more advantageous, as Draco Meteor is slightly inaccurate and lowers Silvally-Dragon's Special Attack by two stages, thus easing pressure off of the incoming switch-in. Defog should be used to clear the field of entry hazards when the opponent is switching or using a resisted attack. Mispredicting and not being able to successfully use Defog may be the deciding factor for winning the game, especially if your wincon, such as Z-Me First Pinsir, is weak to entry hazards. If Silvally-Dragon has an unfavorable matchup and hazards are cleared, use Parting Shot to pivot out and let a teammate better handle the foe.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to its lack of reliable recovery, building an offensive core with Silvally-Dragon is easier than building a defensive one. As a result, pairing Silvally-Dragon with a Healing Wish user such as Musharna promotes its longevity and ability to keep entry hazards off the field throughout the match. Offensive Pokemon that appreciate the removal of entry hazards such as Oricorio-G, Simisear, Pinsir, and Jynx all make for great partners with Silvally-Dragon, as it aids their wallbreaking or sweeping potential. Teammates such as Aggron and Gurdurr form a solid offensive core and can come in through Parting Shot on specially defensive wincons such as Clefairy and Type: Null. Pokemon that take advantage of Silvally-Dragon lowering the foe's Attack and Special Attack with Parting Shot such as Alolan Raichu and Stoutland also make for good partners, allowing them to switch in more easily against a softer incoming blow. Silvally-Dragon can create a VoltTurn core with Pokemon such as Eelektross and Primeape. Pokemon that can deal with Fairy-types such as Alolan Dugtrio, Aggron, Skuntank, and Victreebel pair well with Silvally-Dragon.</p>"

Additionally, it is fast enough to outspeed every relevant Fighting- and Dark-type, bar Primeape, which it Speed ties with, and Alolan Persian and Liepard, both of which can't deal very much damage to it. Silvally-Fairy also has access to Defog, making it a useful hazard remover on teams which want to keep offensive momentum. However, it lacks a useful ability and is forced to hold a Fairy Memory to be a Fairy-type, making it pretty weak. Silvally-Fairy faces competition as a Fighting-type answer from Pokemon such as Jellicent, as it lacks reliable recovery and can be broken down easily, but Silvally-Fairy carves a niche out with its Speed, access to Swords Dance, and ability to check Dark-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A 248 HP / 124 Def / 136 Spe EV spread with a Jolly nature can be used for a more solid answer to Dark- and Fighting-types such as Shiftry and Hitmonchan. This set can run moves such as Roar in order to take on setup sweepers more comfortably. However, without full Speed investment, Silvally-Fairy loses the ability to take on threats such as Primeape, which can U-turn, and Kangaskhan and Zangoose, which can hit it very hard. Silvally-Fairy could run Thunder Wave in order to support teammates by reducing opposing Pokemon's Speed as appropriate. Rest is an option for recovery, although it takes away a moveslot and requires that one of Silvally-Fairy's teammates be able to heal its status or another moveslot be used for Sleep Talk. In both cases, Silvally-Fairy is easy to take advantage of until it is able to wake up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-type Pokemon such as Haunter and Skuntank are able to take on Silvally-Fairy relatively well, as they can both 2HKO it with their respective STAB moves and are immune to Toxic. Additionally, Skuntank can OHKO it when wielding a Choice Band, although it can be 2HKOed by Multi-Attack.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Since Silvally-Fairy lacks reliable recovery and pivots constantly, it can get chipped pretty easily by a combination of entry hazards, status, and switching into opposing Pokemon's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Faster Steel-types such as Alolan Sandslash under hail and Alolan Dugtrio can threaten Silvally-Fairy with their super effective STAB attacks, although neither is capable of OHKOing Silvally-Fairy and both have to be wary of Flamethrower. Aggron can take any hit from Silvally-Fairy and OHKO it with Heavy Slam.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flamethrower allows Silvally-Fairy to 2HKO Ferroseed and defensive Alolan Sandslash, whereas Thunderbolt prevents Silvally-Fairy from being completely walled by Qwilfish and also threatens to hit Pokemon such as Swanna and Oricorio-G super effectively. Parting Shot allows Silvally-Fairy to pivot into a teammate while lowering the attack stats of the Pokemon it hits. U-turn is an alternative that allows Silvally-Fairy to pivot out on Clear Body users such as Regirock and Metang. Defog allows Silvally-Fairy to remove entry hazards to support its team, while Toxic gives Silvally-Fairy a way to damage walls such as Regirock and Mudsdale.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>40 Defense EVs allow Silvally-Fairy to take a Fake Out and Double-Edge from Kangaskhan from full HP, with the rest of the EVs dumped into Attack to allow Silvally-Fairy to 2HKO Skuntank after Stealth Rock. Silvally-Fairy should always run a Jolly nature, as it should not compromise its bulk and fails to OHKO Alolan Sandslash, Ferroseed or Qwilfish even without a Special Attack reducing nature.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Silvally-Fairy should pivot into its teammates using Parting Shot, especially if you can anticipate an opponent's switch. Silvally-Fairy can switch in fairly comfortably against almost every Fighting- and Dark-type, but beware of coverage such as Gunk Shot on Primeape and Leaf Storm on Shiftry, among others. Silvally-Fairy has no reliable recovery and can get worn down very quickly, especially if it keeps pivoting, so don't switch it in unless you are sure it will take little damage. If running Defog, prioritize entry hazard removal as early as possible as Silvally-Fairy is highly prone to being worn down through chip damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that are threatened by Fighting- or Dark-types, such as Stoutland and Kangaskhan appreciate Silvally-Fairy's ability to take them on. Wallbreakers that appreciate Silvally-Fairy's pivoting through Parting Shot, such as Drampa and Crabominable are good partners. When running Thunderbolt, answers to Steel-types such as Primeape and Combusken also work very well with Silvally-Fairy as it is walled by them. This includes Pokemon such as Hitmonchan and Gurdurr. Similarly, a teammate that can pressure Qwilfish is a necessity when using Flamethrower. Musharna is able to act as a more reliable secondary check to Gurdurr while offering Healing Wish support, which helps compensate for Silvally-Fairy's lack of reliable recovery. Additionally, clerics such as Lanturn and Lurantis work effectively to keep Silvally-Fairy free of status, which would otherwise cripple it. For similar reasons, entry hazard removers such as the aforementioned Lurantis, Skuntank, and Kabutops are important to prevent Silvally-Fairy from taking too much residual damage from hazards, especially because it is constantly pivoting. Due to its ability to pivot, Silvally-Fairy mixes well with other Pokemon with VoltTurn coverage such as Eelektross and Lanturn. Wallbreakers with above-average bulk such as Kangaskhan and Jellicent pair well, as they do not mind switching into -1 attacks from opponents following a Parting Shot. Pokemon weak to entry hazards such as Aurorus appreciate the Defog support provided by Silvally-Fairy, but may also want a secondary entry hazard remover as Silvally-Fairy is not as effective at removing entry hazards over longer games.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flame Charge allows Silvally-Fairy to hit Steel-types such as Alolan Sandslash and Ferroseed while simultaneously boosting its Speed, enabling it to Speed tie with Primeape at +1 and outspeed slower Choice Scarf users such as Abomasnow. U-turn allows Silvally-Fairy to pivot out of a bad matchup, like against Tangela or Metang, without wasting its boosts.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment along with a Jolly nature is required in order to outspeed some potential threats to Silvally-Fairy's sweep such as Skuntank and Rotom-F as well as Speed tie with Primeape at +1.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>A combination of a good defensive typing, solid natural bulk, and U-turn allow Silvally-Fairy to be brought in at several times throughout a match and pressure many common threats, particularly Fighting-types such as Gurdurr, which are forced to switch out in its presence. This can provide Silvally-Fairy with an opportunity to set up. However, a lack of reliable recovery means it is hindered by entry hazards, particularly Spikes; when these are up, Silvally-Fairy is best reserved for late-game, when potential threats such as Qwilfish and Simisear have been weakened and Silvally-Fairy can begin a sweep. Although Flame Charge should primarily be treated as a boosting move, its attack status allows it to bypass Taunt. Consequently, when facing a Taunt user that may try to prevent Silvally-Fairy from setting up, Flame Charge should be prioritized over Swords Dance. Additionally, if facing a Choice Scarf user that may immediately outspeed and threaten Silvally-Fairy, such as Primeape with Gunk Shot, Flame Charge should be prioritized in order to at least Speed tie. When facing a Rocky Helmet user such as Qwilfish or Mawile, Silvally-Fairy should switch normally instead of using U-turn, as it will most likely take more damage than it deals, even at +2. Finally, be mindful when switching into status users, as while it may be tempting to secure an early KO against them, Silvally-Fairy may get burned or paralyzed in the process, hindering its late-game sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ground-types such as Mudsdale make effective partners with their ability to blanket check much of the tier's Poison- and Steel-types that pose a threat to Silvally-Fairy's sweep, such as Aggron and the aforementioned Metang. Spikes setters such as Qwilfish and Ferroseed help to chip away at many of Silvally-Fairy's most common checks, particularly those that lack reliable recovery, such as Metang and Qwilfish. In contrast, Silvally-Fairy benefits greatly from entry hazard removal, as it also lacks reliable recovery. Ferroseed and Alolan Sandslash can be ideal for the roles of Spikes setter and hazard remover, respectively, as they simultaneously bait in Fighting-types, providing Silvally-Fairy with an easy switch-in, however it's important to note that they do not have synergy with each other. Normal-type wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Kangaskhan appreciate the pressure on opposing Fighting-types when paired with Silvally-Fairy and can threaten walls such as Mudsdale that Silvally-Fairy may struggle to take down. Eelektross's extensive coverage is effective in offensively pressuring several obstacles to Silvally-Fairy's sweep, particularly those that lack special bulk, such as Tangela, Mudsdale, Qwilfish, and Metang. Additionally, Silvally-Fairy appreciates Eelektross being a slow pivot in order to avoid chip damage, and Dragon-types such as Drampa and Altaria that would usually wall Eelektross are threatened by Silvally-Fairy. Victreebel makes for a good offensive partner with its STAB coverage that threatens many of Silvally-Fairy's checks, such as Qwilfish and Tangela, and its altogether high damage output that can carve a path for Silvally-Fairy's late-game sweep. A Fire-type answer such as Lanturn could be highly useful, as many of Silvally-Fairy's aforementioned team options are threatened by Fire-type attacks, and Silvally-Fairy is also threatened by the likes of Simisear. Lastly, Hitmonchan can provide good support for Silvally-Fairy, as it is capable of removing hazards while pressuring some of Silvally-Fairy's checks with Toxic, such as Tangela and Mudsdale, and others, such as Qwilfish and Jellicent, with Thunder Punch.</p>"

However, Silvally-Ghost struggles from not excelling in one particular area compared to other Ghost-types and Defog users. It lacks the longevity of Oricorio-G, the strength of Jellicent, or the defensive typing of Silvally-Water. It also is extremely susceptible to chip damage due to how frequently it switches in and its complete lack of even passive recovery, making it an entry hazard remover without much staying power, and its typing just doesn't stick out in a metagame with far better Ghost-types and Fighting checks, meaning that it can only fit on very specific, momentum-based teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave can let Silvally-Ghost lure and neuter setup sweepers such as Alolan Sandslash if they attempt to exploit its lack of offensive pressure, although the lack of Toxic makes certain Pokemon such as Lanturn much more difficult to deal with. Explosion can allow Silvally-Ghost to prevent the use of Defog, which is useful because it can do little to stop Lurantis and Skuntank from removing entry hazards otherwise.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Silvally-Ghost fails to threaten Dark-types such as Skuntank, Alolan Raticate, and Alolan Persian. Pawniard, while rare, completely counters Silvally-Ghost and discourages the use of both Parting Shot and Defog due to Defiant. Although predicted switch-ins can be met with Parting Shot, all can easily tank a few Shadow Balls and either chip Silvally-Ghost with Pursuit or use their utility options like Defog and Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Due to its lack of recovery, Silvally-Ghost can be very easily worn down by entry hazards, status, and various attacks from Pokemon it switches into such as Hitmonchan's Thunder Punch.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Although Silvally-Ghost has very few weaknesses, its bulk is fairly mediocre and it lacks recovery. An effective way to break it down is spamming strong, neutral attacks such as Scyther's Aerial Ace.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Stoutland, Zangoose, and Type: Null are immune to Shadow Ball and don't especially mind Toxic. Although Silvally-Ghost can simply Parting Shot away from them, it does provide Stoutland and Zangoose the chance to fire off some strong attacks and Type: Null to pivot out with its slower U-turn.</p>",

This allows Silvally-Ghost to run Toxic to cripple Pokemon that are not easily chipped by Shadow Ball such as Assault Vest Lanturn. However, Thunderbolt can be run to hit Dodrio, which is immune to Shadow Ball and can attack before Parting Shot.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Although Silvally-Ghost prefers to maximize its offensive stats, 40 EVs can be moved from Special Attack to HP to avoid the OHKO from Dodrio's Flyinium Z-boosted Brave Bird.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Defog is Silvally-Ghost's main priority when it is on the field. Don't worry about giving free turns, as it will be able to freely use Parting Shot afterwards in most cases. Do not forget that Parting Shot can be blocked by Clear Body users such as Regirock. Due to Silvally-Ghost's extreme lack of longevity, do not feel the need to remove entry hazards every single time they are set up. Silvally-Ghost must choose when it switches in extremely carefully, as its time is more limited than most other Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Silvally-Ghost should almost never be seen without corresponding U-turn or Volt Switch users that can keep up momentum. Physical wallbreakers such as Stoutland and sweepers such as Lycanroc enjoy being switched in after Silvally-Ghost uses Parting Shot, especially since it can bait in specially bulky but physically frail Pokemon. Blanket checks such as Mudsdale and Clefairy are also advisable, as Silvally-Ghost invites in plenty of strong attackers including Kangaskhan and Aurorus. Silvally-Ghost is an effective spinblocker, so it can be run next to Qwilfish and Roselia and provide opportunities to switch in while keeping their Spikes up.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Silvally-Poison carves a small niche on defensive teams thanks to its role compression, well-rounded stats, and solid defensive typing that lets it check prominent Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan and Grass-types such as Victreebel. Also, it serves as a good teammate on semistall and stall teams given its defensive typing and rather decent bulk. At base 95, its Speed tier is good, allowing it to outspeed and check Victreebel, which is often hard to switch into. In particular, Silvally-Poison can fulfill the role of a Defogger while also being able to generate momentum with Parting Shot, allowing it to adequately support its team. Given its Poison-typing, it can absorb the Toxic Spikes should they be on the field which is nice for bulky teams. However, it does find itself in a tier where it is usually outclassed by other Poison-types such as Skuntank, Qwilfish, and Victreebel. Skuntank has more versatility with physical and special Defog sets that can be used in tandem with a Z-Move. Victreebel is able to break down walls and can keep itself healthy with Strength Sap, while Qwilfish can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes and can fit on a wider array of builds. Silvally-Poison also gets walled by common Pokemon such as Mudsdale and Regirock, both of which can keep up Stealth Rock against it. It also does not have any reliable recovery, which makes it tough to stick around for a whole battle, especially given that fact that it's a hazard remover. It does not function very well outside of stall, balance, or bulky offense given that its roles are extremely limited compared to other Poison-types such as Skuntank, which is more versatile with its many sets.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunderbolt is an option over Flamethrower for coverage. It hits Qwilfish hard while also doing damage to Jellicent and Oricorio-G but loses out on hitting Victreebel and Steel-types like Ferroseed. Ice Beam is an option to hit Mudsdale for respectable damage while still nailing Victreebel, but it leaves Silvally-Poison without a way to deal damage to Steel-types. Finally, Air Slash is an option to run over Flamethrower, letting Silvally-Poison hit Gurdurr for super effective special damage, since Gurdurr is normally physically bulky.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Mudsdale, Claydol, and Golurk have the ability to wall Silvally-Poison, since neither of its moves hits them effectively and it gets checked by all of them. Silvally-Poison also has a hard time using Defog against Stealth Rock Mudsdale and Golurk.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Given Silvally-Poison's two attacks, it can't really do much to Aurorus, while setup sweepers like Omastar and Lycanroc can threaten it out with their strong Ground-type coverage. Aggron is especially notable here, as it does not have to risk being badly poisoned by Poison Fang.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Physically bulky Pokemon such as Bronzor, Regirock, and Jellicent either wall Silvally-Poison's moves completely, prevent a Parting Shot, or even recover HP just to make life difficult for it.

Poison Fang lets Silvally-Poison cripple switch-ins like Regirock and Mudsdale, as well as hit Pokemon like Jellicent and Sableye even through Taunt. Multi-Attack has more immediate power for targets such as Ludicolo and Clefairy, but lacks the poison chance that is more useful against defensive switch-ins. Flamethrower helps Silvally-Poison check Victreebel while also hitting Steel-types like Alolan Sandslash and Ferroseed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>148 Speed allows Silvally-Poison to Speed creep Victreebel.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Silvally-Poison is used more as a sponge to absorb hits for an extended period of time. It can come in on Fighting- and Grass-types such as Hitmonchan, Victreebel, and Ferroseed and either get a free hit in, pivot out with Parting Shot to a teammate to gain the upper hand on the opposing Pokemon, or remove entry hazards. Since Silvally-Poison can remove entry hazards and is affected by both Spikes and Stealth Rock, it's best to use Defog whenever possible. However, if the opponent has a Stealth Rock user like Mudsdale or Regirock that does not take much damage from Silvally-Poison's attacks, it is often better to hit them with Poison Fang instead. Outside of these situations, Parting Shot should be used almost every time Silvally-Poison is in play given that its attacks don't do much damage to neutral targets. Pokemon that Parting Shot works well against include Jellicent, Gurdurr, and Gastrodon. Since Toxic Spikes can cripple Silvally-Poison's team, removing them comes easy when they're on the field. It should also not be switched in recklessly due to a lack of reliable recovery.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Silvally-Poison fits best on stall teams given its defensive typing and role compression. It can also work on balanced and bulky offensive teams. Stall partners for Silvally-Poison include Bronzor, Articuno, and Wish Audino. Since Fighting-type moves could potentially be a problem for all three of these Pokemon, Silvally-Poison can eat them up and fight back. Audino's Wish passing helps Silvally-Poison too, since it lacks reliable recovery. Bronzor has a 4x resistance to Psychic-type moves and it is immune to Ground-type moves, which both hit Silvally-Poison for super-effective damage. Since it's an important part of stall, Articuno is a good teammate that beats foes such as Mudsdale lacking Rock Slide; it also appreciates Stealth Rock removal before switching in and is immune to Ground-type moves. Ground-types such as Mudsdale, Gastrodon, and Golurk are also an issue for Silvally-Poison, so a Water-, Grass-, or Ice-type such as Poliwrath, Victreebel, or Abomasnow can help Silvally-Poison deal with those particular threats. Pokemon that appreciate Toxic Spikes removed from the field, such as Sableye and Tangela, work well with Silvally-Poison.</p>"

With access to Parting Shot, Silvally-Water is also able to generate momentum better than almost any other entry hazard remover in the metagame. On the downside, Silvally-Water's overall effectiveness is limited by its weaknesses to other common types in Grass and Electric as well as its lack of reliable recovery, meaning it can be worn down quickly and struggle to consistently check Pokemon. Furthermore, Silvally-Water faces competition as a hazard remover from Cryogonal and Altaria, which are immune to Spikes and have reliable recovery.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Silvally-Water can run alternate defensive EV spreads such as 252 HP / 152 Def / 104 Spe, which allows it to outpace Pokemon like Ludicolo, Victreebel, Jolly Alolan Sandslash, and both Assault Vest and Life Orb variants of Hitmonchan; however, Silvally-Water still beats Alolan Sandslash and loses to Hitmonchan regardless of its EV spread. An EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD forgoes all attempts at making use of Silvally-Water's base 95 Speed but lets it better act as a defensive check to Pokemon such as Absol and makes it a more durable entry hazard remover. Silvally-Water can also run an EV spread of 252 HP / 84 Def / 176 Spe, which allows it to use Parting Shot before Qwilfish can use Taunt. Toxic is an option over Thunderbolt or Ice Beam that can cripple specially defensive Pokemon and certain walls such as Hitmonchan and Pyukumuku, but those moves are key attributes to Silvally-Water that allow it to nail Pokemon like Qwilfish and Altaria. An offensive set with maximum Special Attack and Speed investment alongside a Timid nature and Grass Pledge can be used to hit bulky Pokemon like Gastrodon, but it is outclassed by Water-types that have a better offensive presence such as Lanturn and Floatzel. While unorthodox, a physically offensive set with Multi-Attack can be utilized to catch specially defensive Pokemon such as Clefairy off guard; however, considering that most Pokemon that are weak to Water are physically defensive, this can backfire very easily, and Silvally-Water doesn't have the best physical movepool anyway. Silvally-Water can also try a sweeping set with Swords Dance or a mixed set with Work Up, but these methods of trying to give Silvally-Water more offensive presence go against its main niche of role compression and are futile in comparison to other Water-types such as Carracosta, Omastar, and Floatzel, which are just better offensive Water-types and have better coverage options. This also gives Silvally-Water a worse matchup against Defoggers such as Altaria.

Because Silvally-Water lacks reliable recovery, one should determine at Team Preview what Pokemon Silvally-Water can and cannot switch into as well as what Pokemon it can reliably use Defog against. Silvally-Water should also be wary of its health and watch out for status moves like Toxic. When low on health, it should be played more aggressively, using Defog as a last-ditch effort to remove entry hazards and constantly pivoting out with Parting Shot on Pokemon that it can force out such as Aggron; however, using Parting Shot and Defog can be costly against Defiant users like Primeape.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Silvally-Water is best used on bulky offensive and balanced teams thanks to its ability to remove entry hazards for teammates such as Aurorus and Oricorio-G. Scyther in particular is an excellent offensive partner because it forms a pivoting core with Silvally-Water and appreciates the removal of entry hazards. Pokemon such as Hitmonchan and Type: Null that can switch into Electric- and Grass-type Pokemon are ideal partners, as they ease some pressure off of Silvally-Water. Type: Null also forms a pivoting core with Silvally-Water. Grass-types such as Bellossom and Lurantis can patch up team weaknesses to Electric-types such as Lanturn. Bellossom also appreciates Silvally-Water's Parting Shot support, as it makes setting up with Quiver Dance easier. Pokemon that appreciate entry hazards such as Spikes and Toxic Spikes being off the field like Crabominable and Regirock are also good teammates. In return, Crabominable is able to blanket check a plethora of special attackers, including Aurorus, Haunter, Rotom-F, and Cryogonal, while Regirock can check physical attackers like Kangaskhan. Audino is a great partner on bulky teams, as it's able to compensate for Silvally-Water's lack of reliable recovery. Audino is also a solid defensive backbone that can check Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon like Ludicolo and Lanturn for Silvally-Water. In return, Silvally-Water is able to check Pokemon such as Alolan Sandslash and remove entry hazards that mitigate the HP regained with Audino's Regenerator.</p>"

  "Komala": {
    "overview": "<p>Komala has a unique niche with its ability Comatose preventing it from being afflicted with status, allowing it to pivot into status moves with ease as well as giving it an immunity to Toxic Spikes. Access to Rapid Spin and the pivoting move U-turn is Komala's main niche as a Normal-type and is generally the only reason you would use it over Stoutland, Kangaskhan, and Zangoose, which have much better offensive presence, or Audino, which has much better bulk. With a base Attack stat of 115 and a wide range of coverage moves, Komala can hit most of the tier fairly hard. However, even with Komala's immunity to status moves, many Pokemon that carry them like Spiritomb and Gastrodon can beat it one-on-one. Komala also has a hard time beating spinblockers, as its main way of hitting Ghost-types is Sucker Punch which can easily be played around, giving the opponent opportunity to set up or get free switches. Its low physical bulk also leaves it vulnerable to strong physical attackers. Komala suffers from four-moveslot syndrome on almost any kind of set, having to pick and choose what Pokemon it wants to handle. It can run Play Rough to hit Spiritomb, Wood Hammer to hit Gastrodon, and a number of other coverage moves to hit its checks harder, but not all on one set. Komala also faces extreme competition from Cryogonal and Assault Vest Hitmonchan, both of which check many dangerous special attackers such as Aurorus far better than Komala.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Wood Hammer is an option to OHKO Gastrodon and deal super effective damage to physical walls like Mudsdale. Darkinium Z can be used in conjunction with Sucker Punch to help deal with bulkier Ghost-types and Musharna, though many of them carry a Colbur Berry. Shadow Claw or Knock Off can be used as a way to hit Ghost-types without them having to attack, which actually lets Komala take on Oricorio-G, but this requires Komala to take a hit first, unlike Sucker Punch. Play Rough allows Komala to hit Sableye and Spiritomb for super effective damage but has little use outside of that. Superpower is an option to hit Rock- and Steel-types harder than Earthquake, but the stat drops it causes make it less spammable than the aforementioned. An offensive Choice Band set can be used with a coverage move over Rapid Spin, but the team support of Rapid Spin is hard to pass up, and such a set is outclassed by other Normal-types like Stoutland or Dodrio for their better Speed. A Choice Band set with Sleep Talk and Last Resort can be used for an extremely powerful STAB move that can be used immediately, though this fails to take advantage of Komala's good coverage and is walled by Ghost-types, while Rock-, and Steel-types don't take a lot from it. A Swords Dance or Bulk Up set can be used, since Komala isn't crippled by burns or worn down by Toxic, though these sets sometimes struggle to pick and choose coverage, are generally slow compared to many other setup options, and also lose out on Rapid Spin. A specially defensive set with Wish is an option, though Komala's low HP makes it outclassed by Audino, and it has a huge four-moveslot syndrome due to having to choose between Protect and a coverage move so its only attack isn't Rapid Spin.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types prevent Komala's Rapid Spin and are difficult for it to get past. Sableye and Spiritomb wall Komala, and Substitute Oricorio-G can easily play around Sucker Punches and proceed to set up with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types are fairly common in PU and have super effective STAB attacks against Komala. Hitmonchan and Primeape are faster than Komala and can OHKO it with a Fighting-type move and Gurdurr can easily take two Returns before using Drain Punch.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Komala's lackluster bulk means that it can't take hits well from strong attackers like Stoutland, Absol, and Zangoose which also outspeed Komala, though Zangoose takes quite a bit from Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Rock- and Steel-types</strong>: A set lacking Earthquake struggles to do anything against threats that resist Normal like Regirock and Carracosta except pivot out with U-turn, and even with Earthquake, Komala won't be doing too much damage to them. Steel-types like Ferroseed and Alolan Sandslash also give Komala a hard time, with the former walling it completely and the latter beating any set lacking Earthquake.</p>",

      "Bulky Spinner": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn provides momentum and lets Komala pivot away from unfavorable foes like Mudsdale and Spiritomb. Sucker Punch is used as a form of priority and a way to hurt Pokemon like Jynx and Haunter before they can do too much damage to Komala. Earthquake is an alternative coverage option that helps do more damage to Rock- and Steel-types like Aggron, Aurorus, and Alolan Sandslash, which resist Komala's Return.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The provided EVs give Komala enough Speed to get the jump on maximum Speed Modest Drampa while retaining bulk and power. An Assault Vest is used to increase Komala's decent special bulk to allow it to take hits from Pokemon like Cryogonal and Haunter. Comatose gives Komala an immunity to status, allowing it to switch into Will-O-Wisp and Toxic Spikes while being able to Rapid Spin away the latter at little cost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Komala should be used as a team's method of entry hazard control, being able to Rapid Spin easily if the opponent doesn't have a Ghost-type. It should be brought in on weak special attackers like Gastrodon and specially defensive Lanturn so it can take a hit and use Rapid Spin or scout the opponent's response with U-turn. It can also be brought in on obvious status moves from the likes of Sableye and even Jynx, as Komala is unaffected by those and can gain momentum for the team, though it should be wary of Foul Play or Knock Off from Sableye and Psyshock from Jynx. If the opponent has a Ghost-type, Komala should be prepared to use U-turn to not lose momentum on an attempt to block the Rapid Spin. Without recovery, Komala can be chipped very easily and therefore should be wary of taking too many attacks and being worn down by the hazards that it tries to remove.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Komala pairs well with anything weak to Stealth Rock, mainly Fire- and Flying-types like Simisear and Swanna. Simisear is able to deal with defensive Ghost-types like Spiritomb and Sableye, while Swanna can offensively check Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan and Primeape. Komala appreciates a solid Fighting-type check like Musharna or Spiritomb, while both appreciate Komala's ability to get rid of Toxic Spikes so they aren't worn down by them. It also appreciates Pursuit trappers like Skuntank and Absol to get rid of Ghost-types like Oricorio-G and Silvally-Ghost that would otherwise block Rapid Spin. In addition, Komala fits well on Spikes-stacking teams that prefer spinners over Defoggers, making Ferroseed a good partner. Komala's immunity to status also makes it a good pair for Pokemon that fear Will-O-Wisps from Spiritomb and Thunder Waves from Qwilfish. Primeape, Carracosta, and Lycanroc can all take advantage of this and also appreciate Komala's slow U-turn. In return, these Pokemon can break walls like Regirock that Komala fails to do much to. Strong but frail breakers like Absol and Combusken appreciate Komala's ability to pivot as well. Komala also can take advantage of Healing Wish support from the aforementioned Musharna as well as Clefairy, since it gets worn down fairly easily, so it can have other opportunities to use Rapid Spin late-game.</p>"

  "Turtonator": {
    "overview": "<p>Turtonator finds its place in the PU metagame as a threatening Shell Smash sweeper. Offensively, its Fire / Dragon typing boasts unresisted coverage against everything in the tier. It is free to run a Z-Move such as Devastating Drake that allows it to beat blanket checks like Hitmonchan after a Shell Smash. Good physical bulk lets it set up against weaker physical attackers such as Shiftry. Turtonator's main flaw is its low Speed, meaning it can easily be outsped and revenge killed after Stealth Rock damage by common Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Alolan Sandslash even after a Shell Smash. Its typing can often hinder it as well, as it is weak to Stealth Rock and lacks notable resistances outside of Grass, Fire, and Electric. Turtonator is generally only seen on niche hyper offense teams, because other Fire- or Dragon-types such as Combusken and Drampa are able to inflict immediate damage or have better defensive utility.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Firium Z powers up Fire Blast into a 185-Base Power Inferno Overdrive, which can help against Fairy-types such as Clefairy. A set utilizing Grassium Z with Solar Beam can be used to help out against Pyukumuku, which can take a Devastating Drake and recover off the damage due to its Unaware ability ignoring Turtonator's stat boosts, but is generally not worth using over Dragonium Z, since it hits nothing else relevant. Substitute over Draco Meteor is an option, especially on teams with dual screens support, as it can get up a Substitute against more passive Pokemon or on a predicted status move. However, without Draco Meteor, Turtonator loses out on a lot of power. Earthquake deals a lot of damage to Lanturn and does a notable amount against Carbink, which otherwise completely walls Turtonator. It should only be used in conjunction with White Herb, as Lanturn is knocked out by a +2 Devastating Drake anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to Turtonator's low Speed, Pokemon such as Primeape, Dodrio, and Kabutops that run Choice Scarf sets are able to outspeed and knock out Turtonator after a Shell Smash. Also, priority users such as Lycanroc and Absol are able to pick off Turtonator if it has taken some prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Clefairy is immune to Turtonator's Dragon-type attacks, and can take a +2 Fire Blast while crippling Turtonator with Thunder Wave. Pokemon such as Type: Null and Munchlax are bulky enough to survive even a +2 Devastating Drake and Rest off the damage, meaning they can win one-on-one in most circumstances.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Some Water-types, such as Pyukumuku and Assault Vest Lanturn, are able to survive a +2 Draco Meteor and deal a lot of damage in return, or in Pyukumuku's case, win in a one-on-one situation with Toxic and Recover, since its Unaware ability ignores Turtonator's stat boosts.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such Choice Specs Jellicent and Aurorus are able to outspeed Turtonator before a Shell Smash boost and knock it out after Stealth Rock damage due to Turtonator's low special bulk.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Turtonator's primary appeal is Shell Smash, which allows it to sweep weakened teams after it has set it up and the opposing team's revenge killers are dealt with or break down specially defensive walls. Draco Meteor is used in conjunction with Dragonium Z to get the most power out of the Z-Move and to secure KOs on Pokemon that are out of range of Dragon Pulse. Dragon Pulse is Turtonator's most spammable move, since there is no accuracy drawback, and unlike Draco Meteor, it doesn't drop Turtonator's Special Attack by two stages.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Dragonium Z turns Draco Meteor into a 195-Base Power Dragon-type move that can break past a lot of specially defensive Pokemon after a Shell Smash, such as Lanturn and Assault Vest Hitmonchan. White Herb can be used so that Turtonator is harder to revenge kill after a Shell Smash, as it nullifies the first Defense drops.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Finding opportunities to set up Shell Smash against Fire-, Steel-, and Electric-type attacks, such as Choice-locked Aggron's Heavy Slam or Eelektrossâ€™s Volt Switch, is vital, as Turtonator needs the boosts to effectively sweep. Another good way to set up is to find Turtonator in a one-on-one situation against weaker physical attackers such as Skuntank, as Turtonator's good physical bulk can allow it to use Shell Smash without taking too much damage. Devastating Drake should be used carefully, as opponents can pivot out into a Steel- or Fairy-type predicting the Z-Move, leaving another Pokemon out of range from Turtonator's other attacks. Turtonator acts more like a wallbreaker in most circumstances due to its great damage output but subpar Speed stat, even after a +2 boost. Devastating Drake should only be used to get necessary KOs, as Draco Meteor drops Turtonator's Special Attack by two stages. Make sure to not switch Turtonator in while Stealth Rock is up, as this can hinder Turtonator's ability to take hits and set up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Reflect and Light Screen from Pokemon such as Electrode give Turtonator increased bulk to let it set up Shell Smash much more easily. Memento from users like Alolan Dugtrio and Skuntank also gives Turtonator better opportunities to set up well, since Memento drops the foe's Attack and Special Attack stats by two stages. Qwilfish and Ferroseed can set up Spikes, putting the opponent's Pokemon in range of Dragon Pulse late-game. In return, Turtonator 4x resists Electric and Fire for Qwilfish and Ferroseed, respectively. Other Rock-resistant Pokemon such as Gurdurr and Torterra also make for good partners, as they can easily take on Pokemon such as Lycanroc, which can prevent Turtonator from sweeping by possibly revenge killing it with priority Accelerock. Entry hazard control from Pokemon like Skuntank, Hitmonchan, and Swanna is essential, since Turtonator is weak to Stealth Rock and needs to preserve its health to set up well. Skuntank is especially notable, as it can absorb Toxic Spikes, which limits the number of turns that Turtonator has on the field. Pokemon that can capitalize on Turtonator's ability to KO specially defensive Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Oricorio-G and Floatzel work well. Sticky Web support from Shuckle allows Turtonator to outspeed Choice Scarf users like Primeape and Jynx after Shell Smash, which would be able to revenge kill Turtonator and stop the sweep.</p>"

  "Drampa": {
    "overview": "<p>Drampa's monstrous base 135 Special Attack, access to high-Base Power STAB moves, solid offensive typing, and excellent Special movepool cement its role as one of the most devastating wallbreakers in the PU metagame, with almost no safe switch-ins. Thanks to its typing and access to Sap Sipper, Drampa functions as a solid pivot into Grass-type moves from Pokemon such as Victreebel and Tangela, and it can use its somewhat decent bulk to switch into passive Pokemon like Regirock, Ferroseed, and Qwilfish without taking much damage. Despite Drampa's exceptional offensive prowess, it is plagued with being one of the slowest Pokemon in the tier, and its typing gives it notable weaknesses to Ice-, Fairy-, and the common Fighting-type Pokemon. This, more often than not, leaves Drampa vulnerable to Pokemon such as Hitmonchan, Jynx, and Silvally-Fairy picking it off once they've been sent in.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Life Orb or Dragonium Z can allow Drampa to repeatedly take advantage of Berserk and switch moves, but it prefers to be able to nuke right off the bat and the immunity Sap Sipper provides is still preferred. Assault Vest can help Drampa check weather teams effectively thanks to its typing, but the lack of a boosting item limits its wallbreaking potential and this set is hampered by a lack of recovery.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Assault Vest Hitmonchan is the only Fighting-type that can directly switch into Drampa, as it can take one STAB attack at full health and threaten Drampa with its powerful Drain Punch. In addition, Hitmonchan, as well as Primeape in particular, can always OHKO Drampa.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Although many of them don't take a Choice Specs-boosted Hyper Voice very well, they're all immune to Drampa's strongest STAB attack. Silvally-Fairy can take a Hyper Voice at full HP and has a strong chance of OHKOing back with Multi-Attack after Stealth Rock damage. Clefairy can easily tank any hit besides Hyper Voice, and it can pressure Drampa with its STAB and utility moves. Soundproof Mr. Mime is immune to both of Drampa's STAB moves, can survive Fire Blast, and can OHKO Drampa with All-Out Pummeling or set up on it if it's locked into its other moves. Carbink is only threatened by the occasional Energy Ball.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Because Drampa is so slow, keeping up offensive pressure with faster hitters such as Aggron, Aurorus, Primeape, and Jynx can prevent it from getting many opportunities to do its job. Pokemon with super effective coverage like Ludicolo and Alolan Raichu can pick it off after prior damage. Making correct predictions such as switching in on a Choice-locked move with a Pokemon that can take the move well can also help put Drampa in a bad position, and racking up hazards can hinder its durability.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is Drampa's most powerful move, capable of achieving OHKOs on bulky Pokemon such as Musharna and Regirock after Stealth Rock. Hyper Voice offers a secondary STAB move that allows Drampa to hit Fairy-types hard, with the potential of OHKOing Silvally-Fairy after Stealth Rock. It's also the move with the least drawback, as long as there are no Ghost-type Pokemon on the field. Fire Blast is Drampa's best option for hitting Steel-types like Ferroseed, Metang and Alolan Sandslash, but Flamethrower can be used for better accuracy while still maintaining coverage against these Pokemon and other bulky Steel-types. Focus Blast allows Drampa to ensure a 2HKO against Type: Null and Munchlax, as well as a very strong chance of OHKOing Audino after Stealth Rock. Energy Ball provides Drampa with a strong neutral coverage move versus teams with both Jellicent and a Fairy-type, easing the need to predict correctly. It also 2HKOs Carbink, an otherwise safe switch-in.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread gives Drampa enough Speed to outspeed uninvested base 50 Speed Pokemon such as Regirock, Sableye, and Audino. The remainder HP EVs let Drampa take hits better, allowing it to always survive Life Orb-boosted Focus Blast from special Floatzel at full HP. Sap Sipper allows Drampa to more easily pivot into Grass-type moves, protecting it from utility options like Sleep Powder and Leech Seed from the likes of Tangela and Ferroseed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Drampa should look for opportunities to come in early- and mid-game to punch holes against the opposing team, as it paves the way for teammates to clean up later in the battle. Against defensive teams, Drampa is very capable of pressuring the likes of Grass-type Pokemon like Tangela and other passive Pokemon such as Lanturn, Regirock, and Sableye, as they usually canâ€™t do much in return. Against more offensively oriented teams, it's best to try to use Drampa as a pivot against Pokemon that canâ€™t touch it much like non-Drain Punch Eelektross and Jellicent and use that opportunity to nab a KO against the opponent's team. Unless a Pokemon is immune to Drampa's STAB moves, you're generally safe to fire them off against these types of teams, as even resisted hits will deal a significant amount of damage. While Drampa can be sent out on weaker neutral attacks and resisted hits, avoid sending it out against strong neutral attacks or super effective coverage, as that makes it much easier to wear down. After using Draco Meteor, Drampa still has enough power to take out Pokemon like Carracosta that try to take advantage of the Special Attack drops, but it should be switched out against bulkier Pokemon that can set up, like Torterra and Throh.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Part of making the most out of Drampa involves providing as many opportunities for it to grab a free switch as possible. Momentum support from the likes of Eelektross, Lanturn, Alolan Persian, Silvally-Fairy, and Primeape is appreciated, as many either provide a slow VoltTurn or tend to lure in bulky Pokemon for Drampa to take advantage of. Lanturn invites in lots of Grass-types, while Alolan Persian, Silvally-Fairy, and Primeape tend to lure physically defensive Pokemon such as Qwilfish and Gurdurr. Stealth Rock support is crucial in securing certain OHKOs on Pokemon like Musharna and Audino, and as such Stealth Rock users like Torterra and Mudsdale are beneficial, with Mudsdale in particular checking Fighting-types for Drampa. Lastly, late-game sweepers and cleaners such as Alolan Persian, Z-Lovely Kiss Jynx, Omastar, Lycanroc, and Choice Scarf Primeape all benefit from the massive holes that Drampa punches into teams, easing their win conditions.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind makes Drampa a powerful threat to bulky teams late-game and helps it against Pokemon that would normally beat it like Ludicolo. Roost lets Drampa stay healthy throughout the match, letting it switch into threatening Pokemon like Eelektross reliably, as well as allowing it to set up Calm Mind multiple times throughout the game. Flamethrower is used to hit bulky Steel-types like Alolan Sandslash and Ferroseed as well as Ice- and Grass-types like Abomasnow and Cryogonal. Hyper Voice is the stronger STAB attack and is an option over Flamethrower, for its good neutral coverage; however, this leaves Drampa walled by Steel-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Drampa needs 116 Speed EVs to outspeed uninvested base 50 Speed Pokemon such as Regirock and Eelektross. 140 HP EVs allow Drampa to take strong attacks like Oricorio-E's unboosted Supersonic Skystrike and Simisear's unboosted Focus Blast. Berserk makes Drampa more threatening upon it taking a strong attack rather than having to use Calm Mind and synergizes well with Roost, but it means Drampa loses an important immunity.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Drampa should aim to set up Calm Mind mid- to late-game once faster Pokemon like Aurorus and Stoutland that can revenge kill it have been removed. It should also be noted that Pokemon like Cryogonal and Calm Mind Clefairy need to be severely weakened before Drampa can set up. Drampa can also come in against passive Pokemon like Ferroseed and force switches against Pokemon like Lanturn, which are great opportunities for it to set up Calm Mind. After setting up, Drampa is absurdly strong, so use its immense power to blow holes into the opposing team. Make sure not to boost more than necessary because the more Drampa boosts, the more likely it is to be struck by a critical hit. Pivoting Drampa in and out on attackers it checks like Jellicent, Haunter, and Eelektross while dealing damage to checks and counters as they come in with Dragon Pulse is usually ideal; however, be wary that these Pokemon sometimes carry super effective coverage attacks like Ice Beam, Dazzling Gleam, and Drain Punch. Don't set up Calm Mind if you need Drampa healthy to take on these aforementioned threats. If Drampa intends to pivot into these Pokemon and gets worn down in the process, don't be afraid to use Roost. Drampa can also pivot into Grass-types such as Ludicolo and Victreebel thanks to Sap Sipper and the Water-type resistance, but it should be wary of Ice Beam and Sludge Bomb. Being poisoned is extremely crippling for Drampa, leaving it unable to sweep effectively, so be wary of Toxic or Toxic Spikes. Drampa should also avoid switching into Pokemon that it checks if entry hazards are still on the field, as it might not have the necessary bulk to pivot onto the field later.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Drampa fits well on balance and bulky offensive teams that appreciate a setup sweeper that can punish and exploit bulky foes like Regirock and Ferroseed, as well as teams looking for checks to Pokemon like Eelektross. Entry hazard setters such as Mudsdale and Qwilfish serve as checks to Fighting-type Pokemon like Primeape and Gurdurr and help wear down Drampa's checks over time with entry hazards. Qwilfish can also cripple faster Pokemon like Lycanroc with Thunder Wave and absorb Toxic Spikes, while Mudsdale can handle powerful wallbreakers such as Aggron and Stoutland that pressure Drampa. While they can't handle Fighting-types, other Stealth Rock users like Metang and Regirock can offer valuable resistances, with Metang taking strong Ice-type attacks from the like of Aurorus for Drampa, while Regirock provides a more reliable check to Normal-types like Kangaskhan. Oricorio-E makes for a good teammate, being able to threaten or cripple most of Drampa's checks like Gurdurr and Cryogonal with Hurricane and Toxic. It also provides a switch-in to Hitmonchan. In return, Oricorio-E appreciates Drampa's ability to break down Pokemon like Regirock, which can make it sweep more easily. Pokemon that can remove entry hazards such as Skuntank and Alolan Sandslash are good teammates; Skuntank can also Pursuit trap bulky Pokemon like Cryogonal, while Alolan Sandslash can handle Pokemon like Clefairy. Lastly, pivots such as Lanturn and Eelektross are ideal teammates for Drampa because they bring it onto the field safely, allowing it to set up more freely, and chip away at Pokemon that give Drampa trouble like Hitmonchan, Clefairy, and Cryogonal. Lanturn can also remove status with Heal Bell for Drampa if it gets crippled by Toxic.</p>"
