  "Serperior": {
    "overview": "<p>As the sixth fastest Pokemon in VGC 2011 with access to Safeguard, dual screens, and other useful moves, Serperior would seem to have a niche in the VGC 2011 metagame. However, Prankster users make Serperior's superb Speed almost useless, and with no impressive attacking stats to fall back on to make good use of its Speed, Serperior often finds itself a dead weight once it's finished setting up or is Taunted. Overall, Serperior isn’t too threatening or helpful, but still does a great job of setting up screens and has just enough other options to get by.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Swords Dance or Coil set could work, but Serperior's physical movepool is very lacking, with nothing of note outside of Leaf Blade, Dragon Tail, and Return. Serperior can set up Sunny Day and gets Growth, but again, it doesn't have much to work with. A SubSeed set could work but Whimsicott probably does it better, and SubSeed isn't as effective in doubles as it is in singles to begin with. Double Team is not banned in VGC, and Serperior is arguably one of the fastest and bulkiest users. After a few Double Teams, the Calm Mind set becomes hard to stop.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Whimsicott is annoying with Encore, and the other two Prankster users can carry Taunt, which seriously impedes Serperior from doing anything useful, but must watch for Serperior carrying Mental Herb. Most Flying-types carry Acrobatics with a Flying Gem, and can kill Serperior without Reflect up. Other good checks include Chandelure, Darmanitan, and any other Pokemon that resists Serperior's attacks and can get through its bulk. Putting aside the threat of Serperior's Taunt and Safeguard, Amoonguss's bulk and typing make it hard for Serperior to do anything noteworthy to the giant mushroom. Bouffalant and Sawsbuck are hard counters with their Sap Sipper ability, raising their Attack stats each time they're hit by a Grass-type attack, while shrugging off anything else Serperior throws at them. Sawsbuck should be a bit wary of Hidden Power, though.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its fantastic Speed, Serperior sets up screens before most Pokemon can attack, making it a great dual screen user. After setting up screens, Serperior can proceed to use Glare or Taunt on your opponent's Pokemon, making them more vulnerable to attacks. Alternatively, it can set up Safeguard, which is a great move to protect your team from Amoonguss and other status abusers. To show how helpful screens are, assuming both Archeops and Tornadus run max Attack, a neutral nature, and Reflect is up, Tornadus will never KO Serperior with Flying Gem boosted Acrobatics without a critical hit, while Archeops only has a 7% chance to KO Serperior. Leaf Blade is a great move with its high critical hit rate, and has the added bonus of hitting Jellicent on its softer physical side for super effective damage. Leaf Storm, used twice, will outdamage Leaf Blade, and Serperior may not be attacking that often anyway.</p> <p>Mental Herb gives you at least one turn of setup, lifting the effects of Taunt and Encore, while Light Clay will make Serperior's screens last longer. An alternative EV spread of 100 HP / 156 Atk / 252 Spe can be used if Serperior's offensive abilities with the recommended spread are too unusable. 156 EVs in Special Attack guarantees a KO on Terrakion with Leaf Storm and most Pokemon weak to it. The EVs in Attack will also make for a stronger Leaf Blade, making Serperior less of an offensive slouch. 100 EVs in HP will still guarantee surviving a neutral nature Tornadus's Acrobatics with Reflect up, but you have a much higher chance of being KOed by Archeops.</p> <p>Although generally not as good as the moves above, Gastro Acid and Dragon Tail can work well in certain situations. Gastro Acid, while being a situational move, is a lot of fun to use on Conkeldurr who abuse Flame Orb plus Guts. Some other uses include hitting Eelektross and Musharna, who often depend on their abilities to protect themselves from their partner's spread attacks. Although otherwise useless, Dragon Tail can be used to stop Trick Room.</p> <p>Giga Drain is an option over the aforementioned attacks for restoring Serperior's health. However, it is only recommended if using the second spread, because with only 4 EVs in Special Attack, Serperior can't even guarantee a reliable 2HKO on Terrakion, so the HP recovered will hardly be worth Leaf Blade's higher critical hit rate and power.</p> <p>Most sweepers will benefit from dual screens, making them much harder to take down. Because Serperior is able to hit Jellicent and Terrakion for super effective damage, partners such as Terrakion or Hydreigon, who would normally have trouble with those two, work well and help to cover Serperior's Fire weakness. Thundurus is also a great partner, being able to outspeed Archeops and KO both Archeops and enemy Tornadus with Thunderbolt. Sweepers that possess some bulk such as Hydreigon and Eelektross become even more menacing when behind screens.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>With good defenses and Speed, Serperior is a noteworthy candidate for Calm Mind, needing little help from its teammates to set up. After a Calm Mind or two, Serperior's offensive abilities improve significantly, and enable it to bring down most Pokemon with Giga Drain and Hidden Power. Unlike Lilligant, Virizion, and Volcarona, Serperior initially outspeeds crucial threats such as Tornadus and Terrakion and doesn't have a crippling 4x weakness to Flying- or Rock-type moves. Hidden Power helps make up for Serperior's poor coverage, hitting its would-be counters for super effective damage. Rest plus Chesto Berry is one instant recovery, while Life Orb gives Serperior more power but reduces its survivability.</p> <p>Hidden Power Ice generally gives the best coverage, hitting Flying-types, such as Tornadus, and Dragon-types for super effective damage, but Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Steel-types. Rock is mainly for Volcarona, who is 4x weak to it, and while it does get coverage against Flying-types for super effective damage, Ice is generally the better choice. Taunt is usually not used, but it has some potential use against Amoonguss and Trick Room users, should they not carry Mental Herb. After a Calm Mind, Serperior's Special Attack will only be as high as a neutral natured Jellicent's, so getting off more than one Calm Mind should be your goal, and is safer when Serperior has Rest and Chesto Berry.</p> <p>Although Serperior's defenses are above average, the Calm Mind set is still vulnerable to attacks, and with two Pokemon attacking at once, Serperior will likely be forced to use Rest sooner, rather than later. Thundurus checks most Flying-types, doing huge damage with its STAB Thunderbolt. A Rage Powder user draws attention away from Serperior, giving it more time to stat up.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Emboar is a fantastic Trick Room Pokemon, and with its sky-high Attack and low Speed, it can sweep through teams with ease. Its weakness to Water is a severe hindrance, as a Water Spout from Jellicent or a Surf from Hydreigon will easily take it out, but despite this, Emboar is a great pick for any Trick Room team, and has great staying power with its high HP.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Brick Break can be used if you don't like Hammer Arm's 90% accuracy, but the power drop is usually not worth the slight accuracy increase. If the recoil from Flare Blitz turns you away, Heat Crash has no recoil, though its damage varies on the target's weight, only making it as powerful as Flare Blitz in the case of very light-weight Pokemon such as Amoonguss. This variable damage output makes Flare Blitz the decidedly more attractive option. Head Smash is an option instead of Rock Slide for an immense power increase but the at the cost of much lower accuracy and recoil. Furthermore, Head Smash only hits one opponent. A specially oriented set could be viable, utilizing Emboar's wide special movepool, but Emboar's middling Special Attack makes this a decidedly unattractive option.</p> <p>If the slow, bulky, hard-hitting Pokemon of Trick Room is not your style, Emboar could be used on a team with Tailwind support, attempting to quickly attack and KO the opposition before they get a chance to move. When utilizing a faster set, Superpower should be used over Hammer Arm so as not to lower Emboar's Speed. Concern over Superpower's Attack and Defense drop should be dismissed, as Emboar is likely not living long enough for the drops to matter.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Jellicent is a hard counter for Emboar without Wild Charge, as Emboar can't touch Jellicent and is easily defeated with either Water Spout or Surf in return. Even with Wild Charge, Emboar struggles to 2HKO Jellicent. Hydreigon can outspeed and OHKO Emboar with Surf if Trick Room is not up.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Flare Blitz is Emboar's main STAB attack, dealing lots of damage at the cost of 1/3 recoil damage. Hammer Arm is Emboar's other STAB move, and comes with the added boon of lowering Emboar's Speed by one stage, which is very useful under Trick Room. Rock Slide is used for coverage and hits Thundurus and Tornadus, who can otherwise OHKO Emboar with their STAB Flying-type attacks, for super effective damage. Rock Slide also covers Chandelure, who resists both of Emboar's STABs. In the last slot, Protect is used to allow Emboar to stay alive long enough for its partner to KO an opposing threat or get Trick Room set up. Wild Charge can be used to hit Jellicent, but Protect is usually the superior option.</p> <p>Emboar dies quickly, despite its bulk, due to its common weaknesses and Flare Blitz recoil, and while Life Orb compounds the problem, it grants a very welcome offensive boost to enhance Emboar's destructive performance during its limited time.</p> <p>Emboar needs Trick Room support to really do anything, otherwise it can be easily outsped and OHKOed. Common Trick Room users like Jellicent, Reuniclus, and Musharna are helpful. Anything that can handle Jellicent is a welcome partner, as Jellicent stops Emboar cold. Musharna is excellent with Emboar, as it can use Helping Hand to give Emboar even more power.</p>"

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Unfortunately, Samurott lacks good moves outside of its great primary choices. If the Life Orb recoil becomes too much of a burden for you, then a Sitrus Berry can be a good item replacement to add to Samurott's bulk. A Wacan Berry is also useful for allowing Samurott to survive a Thunderbolt from Thundurus, one of Samurott’s greatest counters.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Thundurus is as close to a 100% Samurott counter as possible, able to outspeed and KO it if Samurott is not holding a Wacan Berry. Virizion also thoroughly beats Samurott, outspeeding it and dealing a huge amount of damage with STAB Leaf Blade.</p>",

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Samurott has a relatively low Special Attack stat of 108, which is outclassed by several other Pokemon in VGC 2011. However, Samurott’s bulk and great movepool allow it to have its own niche. First off, Samurott has a huge amount of options for a STAB attack. Surf is good for hitting both opponents, but it also deals damage to your partner unless they have a way of dodging it, such as Water Absorb or Telepathy. Hydro Pump has a considerable amount of power, dealing large amounts of damage to common threats, but its low accuracy may make it undesirable. For that reason, Scald is a suitable replacement. While it sports a measly 80 Base Power, its reliable accuracy and chance to burn make it a great addition to Samurott's moveset. The choice between Ice Beam and Blizzard is one of reliability versus spread damage. The third attacking move depends on what threatens your team more. If other Water-types are a threat, than Grass Knot should be chosen, but if Fighting-types are more threatening to your team, then you should choose Air Slash. Detect is for general utility, and Life Orb allows Samurott to hit as hard as possible, as does a Modest nature.</p> <p>This set is meant to be rearranged depending on what your team needs. If used on a Trick Room team, then a Quiet nature is preferable, while if used on any other team, Modest is the nature of choice. Aqua Jet can be used to finish off weak opponents; if you choose to use the move, then a Mild nature is advised.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Samurott has access to a great physical movepool consisting of Water- and Bug-type moves, which get perfect coverage in VGC 2011 outside of Jellicent and the rarely seen Swanna. Swords Dance boosts Samurott’s Attack to obscene levels and can be set up during a predicted Protect. The choice of STAB is once again difficult, each move having an advantage over the others. Aqua Jet is probably the best choice if Samurott is not in Trick Room, as Samurott can bypass its low Speed to hit several prominent threats hard. Waterfall and Aqua Tail are the other two options, one boasting accuracy and the chance of flinching, and the other having a higher Base Power. The choice of Bug-type move is simply one of power versus accuracy, and is dependent on what the team needs to accomplish. Detect is for easing prediction.</p> <p>If Samurott is unable to find time to set up, then Swords Dance can be replaced with another STAB move. Dragon Tail can be used in order to mess up Trick Room teams, but it lacks use besides that and can be easily drawn towards an opposing Amoonguss. Night Slash is another option that can be used over Swords Dance, covering Jellicent, who walls this set otherwise.</p>"

  "Stoutland": {

Unfortunately, Stoutland is weak to the very common Fighting-type attacks, which hampers its ability to abuse Intimidate. Overall, Stoutland's Intimidate is incredibly useful, and it can make a good complement to almost any team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Stoutland has access to Ice Fang and Wild Charge, giving it super effective coverage on a multitude of targets. A Normal Gem-boosted Return OHKOes the genies, and as such is a viable choice for an item. Retaliate can be used as a STAB move, doubling in power if Stoutland switches in after a teammate is KOed, but it has a measly 70 Base Power otherwise, making Return the superior choice. Stoutland has access to Roar, which can stop Trick Room from being set up, but Rage Powder users such as Amoonguss and Imprison users such as Chandelure do a much better job of stopping Trick Room. Yawn allows Stoutland to force an opponent to switch or become incapacitated, but Pokemon such as Amoonguss with Spore do that much more reliably. Stoutland has access to both Rain Dance and Sunny Day, allowing it to support a weather team, but Pokemon such as Whimsicott and the genies can set up weather much more reliably due to Prankster. Sand Rush doubles Stoutland's Speed in a sandstorm, which can allow it to outpace and damage many of the Pokemon that would otherwise threaten it, but its mediocre offenses and movepool makes Excadrill a far better abuser of Sand Rush. Using Sand Rush also means Stoutland loses Intimidate, is perhaps Stoutland's main niche over other, more competent Pokemon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Stoutland is weak to Fighting-type moves, and while Intimidate allows it to dampen their effects, it often finds itself unable to avoid a KO. Conkeldurr, Scrafty, and Terrakion can all do severe damage to Stoutland while not taking much damage in return, although a Chople Berry helps Stoutland to deal with some of these Pokemon. Stoutland's low Speed makes it susceptible to many faster attackers such as Haxorus and Archeops, but if Tailwind is up, Intimidate's ability to cripple an opponent's offensive presence and Stoutland's decent Attack stat will allow it to take out many opposing offensive Pokemon. Stoutland is unable to do significant damage to bulkier Pokemon due to its middling offenses, so most opposing Trick Room or Tailwind users can easily set up in its face, and many opposing support Pokemon such as Musharna or Amoonguss can easily take any of its attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Stoutland's ability Intimidate allows it to cripple opposing physical attackers, which means it can support its partner while dealing damage. Return is Stoutland's STAB move of choice, doing good damage to most offensive Pokemon, while Crunch hits Ghost-types such as Chandelure and Jellicent for super effective damage. Helping Hand lets Stoutland increase the power of a teammate's attack, which allows it to bypass its middling offenses when paired with a hard hitter such as Chandelure or Haxorus. Protect gives Stoutland the ability to avoid damage for a turn. The EVs and nature help Stoutland hit as hard as possible while retaining good bulk, and a Chople Berry allows Stoutland to withstand any Fighting-type attack and hit hard with Return.</p> <p>Thunder Wave is used so Stoutland can take a hit and slow down its opponent, which works well in conjunction with Intimidate to support an attacking partner. This helps immensely against Tailwind teams, removing their Speed boost. Fire Fang is an option over Crunch, attaining super effective coverage against Steel-types, but Stoutland will then lose out to the common Ghost-types, making it the inferior choice. A Life Orb allows Stoutland to hit much harder, nabbing 2HKOs on most opposing Pokemon, but Stoutland's weakness to common Fighting-type attacks means that it requires significant support to function without a Chople Berry. A Jolly nature with 252 Speed EVs is feasible, as Stoutland is then able to outrun Adamant Krookodile and opposing Modest Chandelure, but detracts greatly from its bulk and power.</p> <p>Stoutland's weakness to Fighting-type attacks and low Speed makes Tornadus an excellent partner, as it can eliminate opposing Fighting-types with its powerful Acrobatics while being able to set up Tailwind. This is extremely beneficial for Stoutland, as it gives a much needed boost to its Speed, meaning that it will be able to do much more damage. Chandelure also makes an excellent partner, benefiting from Intimidate due to its many weaknesses (most of which are to common physical attacks), and taking advantage of Stoutland's Helping Hand to boost the power of its Heat Wave to incredible levels. Archeops can take out any Fighting-type with its STAB Acrobatics, and can take advantage of Stoutland's Intimidate to cushion attacks against it, helping it to avoid being put into the range of Defeatist activation. Stoutland's Helping Hand can also boost the power of Archeops's Rock Slide, making it quite powerful. Amoonguss can easily take any Fighting-type attack and put an opponent to sleep with Spore, and any Psychic-type will also make a good teammate for Stoutland, eliminating most Fighting-types, as well as opposing Amoonguss, which easily weathers its assaults and uses Spore.</p>"

Brick Break is in a similar boat to Energy Ball, hitting for a fixed BP unlike Low Kick. Low Kick will mainly be utilized for Hydreigon whose weight makes Low Kick's Base Power 100, outdamaging Brick Break. Simisage receives Nasty Plot and Work Up, which one might want to utilize on a special or mixed set, respectively, but Simisage's frailty along with the fast-paced metagame of VGC 2011 makes these options a gimmick at best. Low Sweep gives Simisage a way to support its team, lowering foes' Speed and dealing a decent amount of damage. If you want a higher critical hit rate, Shadow Claw has about the same coverage as Crunch, albeit at a lower Base Power, 70 to Crunch's 80.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Simisage lacking Rock Slide are hard-countered by both Chandelure and Tornadus, and even with Rock Slide it will be hard-pressed to defeat them. Thundurus as well can wall Simisage, as many carry a Charti Berry, turning Rock Slide into a 3HKO and hitting back hard with either Hidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Flying.

Seed Bomb gives Simisage a powerful STAB move that lands a super effective hit on such threats as Samurott, Jellicent, and Terrakion, while serving as Simisage's main attacking move. With Crunch, Simisage can deal a heavy blow to Psychic-type threats such as Musharna, while maintaining coverage on Jellicent should the foe choose to switch. The third move is dependent on what one's team has the most trouble with. Rock Slide hits Tornadus hard, which otherwise walls Simisage and hits back hard with super effective STAB Acrobatics. If one's team has problems with Hydreigon, Low Kick deals a great amount of damage, allowing Simisage's partner to finish it off. Whimsicott and Amoonguss can give Simisage fits, which might be remedied by pairing Acrobatics with a Flying Gem to threaten them, as well as other Grass-types. Protect gives Simisage a chance to scout, in addition to letting Simisage stay alive for an additional turn, possibly allowing its partner to eliminate a threat.</p> <p>Simisage's weakness to two very common moves in VGC 2011, Acrobatics and Heat Wave, means a Focus Sash should be used to help Simisage stay alive and continue to hit the opposing team. However, if a teammate of Simisage's is already holding a Focus Sash, a Life Orb allows Simisage to become a little green kamikaze monkey, dishing out as much damage as possible before succumbing to its wounds. An Adamant nature allows Simisage to 2HKO Tornadus with Rock Slide, which is why Tailwind support is so important to Simisage's welfare. A Jolly nature is acceptable to allow Simisage to outspeed Hydreigon, but with Tailwind support this can be remedied. Simisage's defenses are so pitiful that any EVs are better off in its Attack and Speed stats, and the EV spread reflects this notion.</p> <p>As mentioned throughout, Tailwind support is very important to Simisage, and this should be taken into account when considering possible teammates. Whimsicott sets up Tailwind very reliably, and can Charm physical attackers that would like to hit Simisage with super effective Flying-type attacks. However, this leaves the two open to Chandelure's super effective STAB Heat Wave, which wrecks Grass-types.

If the drop in stats is unattractive, Grass Knot can be used instead to deal somewhat more consistent damage. Hidden Power Ice is Simisage's main path of attack against Flying-type foes, as well as Dragon-types like Haxorus. Focus Blast hits Hydreigon harder than Hidden Power Ice, though it has a nasty 70% accuracy rate.

Simipour faces strong competition from other Water-types, mainly Samurott, who sports higher offensive and defensive stats. Simipour's movepool is decent, and includes good coverage moves, but the only trait that clearly distinguishes it from other Water-types is its Speed. Unfortunately, though, this isn't enough for Simipour to warrant use over some other Water-types. In terms of usable sets, Simipour can run a physical, special, or even a mixed set, but it cannot provide any support with moves such as Taunt, as its frailty means it won't last very long in a VGC match. All in all, Simipour is quite mediocre and should only be used over more prominent Water-types such as Samurott and Carracosta if you really require its higher Speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Water Gem can be used over Focus Sash to boost Simipour's STAB move by 50%, but if the opposing Pokemon are faster and considerably strong, Simipour will get KOed before it even gets a chance to attack. Similarly, a Life Orb can be used for extra power, but it reduces Simipour's survivability. Fling + King's Rock can flinch a slower Pokemon once in a game if you're willing to give up Focus Sash.</p> <p>The Acrobatics + Flying Gem combination is a powerful option over Crunch and Focus Sash on the physical set, but Focus Sash is an essential item most of the time. Rock Slide can be used to hit Flying-types and also has a useful flinch chance, while Brick Break is an option over Low Kick for a more reliable Fighting-type move. Blizzard can be used over Ice Beam on the special set to hit both opponents, but it only has a 49% chance of hitting both opponents. Nasty Plot is another special alternative for immediate power, but with such low defenses, Simipour won't be able to properly use it. In terms of support, Taunt is a decent option as it can be used to prevent the opponent from setting up Trick Room. It is also useful against Amoonguss, but Simipour will get heavily damaged by Giga Drain. As Simipour has decent Attack and Special Attack, a mixed set can be used to catch opponents off-guard.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Due to its low defenses, Simipour isn't hard to counter at all. Amoonguss is an exceptional counter as it can both cripple it with Spore and KO it with Giga Drain. Virizion can take anything bar Ice Beam and OHKO Simipour with its STAB move. Thundurus can take on Simipour with ease, as it can survive an unboosted Ice Beam and OHKO Simipour with Thunderbolt. Jellicent becomes a Simipour counter if Simipour isn't carrying Grass Knot or Crunch. If Jellicent is running Cursed Body, it has a decent chance of disabling either Grass Knot or Crunch. Priority completely destroys Simipour as it can break Simipour's Focus Sash on turn one and KO it on turn two. Common users of priority include Bisharp and Zoroark. In general, any Pokemon with decent offenses and access to a super effective move can destroy Simipour, as its defenses are very low.</p>",

Simipour does have access to a slightly stronger STAB, Aqua Tail, but the inaccuracy can prove to be fatal at times, so Waterfall is largely better. Crunch provides coverage against Ghost-types, mainly Jellicent, who is immune to Simipour's other moves thanks to its typing and Water Absorb. Low Kick hits Dark- and Steel-types, such as Hydreigon and Ferrothorn for super effective damage, while Protect is always useful in the VGC metagame as it allows Simipour to avoid being flinched with Fake Out and scout opponent's movesets.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Simipour's Attack and Speed, allowing it to be as strong and fast as possible. One shouldn't even bother investing EVs in Simipour's bulk, as its 75 / 63 / 63 defenses are horrendous. The choice of nature comes down to which Pokemon your team is threatened by the most. Jolly is probably the best choice, as it allows Simipour to outspeed positive natured Hydreigon and Landorus and 2HKO the former with Low Kick and the latter with Waterfall. An Adamant nature, however, grants Simipour the ability to 2HKO standard Jellicent with Crunch. If you plan on using Simipour on a team with Tailwind support, Adamant should be used over Jolly. Focus Sash allows Simipour to survive one hit from full health and guarantees it a chance to hit back.</p> <p>In terms of team support, Tailwind support from the likes of Tornadus and Whimsicott is appreciated as it will allow Simipour to outspeed a vast majority of Pokemon in the tier, and also allows Simipour to run an Adamant nature. Amoonguss is also a decent teammate as Rage Powder allows it to take any Electric- and Grass-type attack aimed at Simipour. In addition, Amoonguss can put opposing threats to sleep while Simipour shields itself with Protect. Lastly, paralysis support from the likes of Thundurus can be useful as it can allow Simipour to outspeed faster Pokemon it otherwise cannot.</p>"

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Scald is the primary option for a STAB move as it has a nifty chance to burn the opponent, which can potentially cripple physical attackers. Surf is the primary alternative to Scald; it is a little more powerful than Scald, but it doesn't have a secondary effect. Furthermore, Surf hits all Pokemon on the field, so it should only be used when the ally Pokemon is immune to Water-type attacks. The second alternative is Hydro Pump, which is more powerful than Surf, but less accurate. Ice Beam destroys Dragon-types, such as Haxorus and Hydreigon, and also hits the Grass-types that resist Simipour's STAB. Grass Knot provides coverage against Water-types, such as Jellicent, that resist both Ice Beam and Simipour's STAB. Protect allows Simipour to avoid taking damage from Fake Out, and can also be used to scout out opponents' moves.</p> <p>Simipour's EV investment in this set is quite straight forward: maximum Special Attack and maximum Speed. As Simipour is very frail, investing in bulk wouldn't be very wise. A Timid nature allows Simipour to outspeed Adamant Landorus and Timid Hydreigon, which it can OHKO and 2HKO respectively with Ice Beam. On the other hand, a Modest nature gives Simipour more power, which allows it to nab the 2HKO on Jellicent with Grass Knot. A Focus Sash lets Simipour survive one non multi-hit move, letting it hit an opponent at least once before it is KOed.</p> <p>Pokemon that benefit from being hit by Water-type moves, such as Water Absorb Jellicent, can work well with Simipour that carry Surf. Amoonguss can provide support with Spore and Stun Spore, and can also take hits directed at Simipour with the help of Rage Powder. Tailwind support from the likes of Whimsicott and Tornadus, is essential, as it allows Simipour to outspeed almost every non-boosted Pokemon in the metagame. Rain Dance support won't hurt either, as a rain-boosted STAB move from Simipour will dent anything that doesn't resist it.</p>"

Overall, Gigalith is a dangerous offensive threat who can tear through entire teams if given the chance to do so.</p>",

Of the three, Gigalith works the best in Trick Room. Rock Slide and Earthquake get good coverage, and coming off 135 base Attack, will hurt anything that doesn't resist it. Boosted by the Normal Gem, Explosion does an incredible amount of damage. Gigalith may well be the only Pokemon who can use Explosion effectively after its drop in Base Power in BW, simply due to how high its Attack is. Because of its ability, Gigalith should almost always be able to use Explosion before it goes down. Protect should be used when Trick Room is being set up, and to scout the opponent's strategy.</p> <p>Using Protect is not ideal when facing Whimsicott and its priority Encore. When concerned with Whimsicott, Rock Blast may be a viable alternative. It can land a KO through a Focus Sash, and still has enough power along with STAB to be a threat. Rock Blast also defeats the annoying Prankster Substitute users trying to stall out Trick Room. A Brave nature with 0 Speed IVs is used to be as slow as possible in Trick Room.</p> <p>When looking for a teammate, it is best to consider a Trick Room user who can take the spread attacks that Gigalith is weak to. Musharna is the best choice, as Telepathy makes it immune to Earthquake and Explosion. Musharna can also provide support with dual screens and Helping Hand. Jellicent can set up Trick Room, and also has immunities to Water- and Normal-type attacks.</p>"

Rock Slide is the primary STAB option here, to damage both of the opponent's Pokemon and demolish the multitude of Flying-types in the VGC. Earthquake has great coverage along with Rock Slide, dealing heavy damage to Steel-types and other Pokemon that resist Rock-type attacks. Choice Band Explosion is the best choice to use when faced against a Trick Room team, as long as the other Pokemon are not Ghost-types. Rock Blast is Gigalith's secondary STAB option, allowing it to check common users of Focus Sash, Substitute, and Charti Berry. Shutting down such Pokemon in one turn is a huge benefit.</p> <p>Even with Gigalith's poor typing and rock-bottom Speed, the damage dealt by it is usually enough to ruin the opponent's strategy. Sturdy ensures survival from the unlucky critical hit or Water Spout. Minimum Speed is applied here to make sure Gigalith moves faster in Trick Room, but an Adamant nature with 31 Speed IVs may be used, as Gigalith cannot use Protect on a Choice Band set.

Seismitoad has the potential to run a physically based mixed set with Brick Break / Rock Slide / Earthquake / Hydro Pump, but the special set hits more Pokemon and is usually the better attacker in general.

Unfortunately, Leavanny's typing will also prove to be its downfall most of the time, giving it weaknesses to common Rock-, Fire-, and Flying-type attacks. Leavanny also becomes nearly useless without sun support, as its average base 92 Speed leaves it outsped by common threats such as the genies and Hydreigon, not to mention the multitude of Choice Scarf users such as Chandelure.

X-Scissor is Leavanny's secondary STAB move, hitting Psychic- and Dark-types such as Reuniclus and Hydreigon for massive damage. It also makes Leavanny a fine check to Trick Room teams reliant on Psychic-types to set up the field effect. There are two options for the third moveslot.

The choice between an Adamant and a Jolly nature depend on whether you appreciate a power boost or the ability to outspeed Jolly Lilligant under the sun, respectively. Life Orb and Focus Sash are both viable options for an item. While the former jacks up the power of Leavanny's attacks, the latter allows it to survive an attack at full health while its teammate sets up the sun. However, note that Focus Sash will be useless if both opponents attack Leavanny. It goes without saying that Leavanny needs team support for it to function properly. Whimsicott makes a fantastic partner, as it can set up Sunny Day with priority thanks to Prankster.

Megahorn becomes insanely powerful after a Swords Dance and activation of Swarm. It will be the best move option against bulky Pokemon such as Musharna. Poison Jab or X-Scissor can work if accuracy is preferred over the raw power of Megahorn. Protect is listed to survive additional turns and scout the opponent's strategy.

Fake Tears allows Hydreigon to spam Draco Meteor all day. Tickle is incredibly helpful against common physical attackers such as Conkeldurr and bulkier Pokemon like Amoonguss.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Pokemon that can OHKO Whimsicott make for the best counters possible.

Chandelure's Overheat OHKOes Whimsicott as well, so predicting which item Whimsicott is holding determines how quickly you can KO it.

One major benefit of Taunt is that it stops Tornadus from using Tailwind and Amoonguss from using Spore.</p> <p>Anything with middling Speed and high Attack or Special Attack is a good teammate for Whimsicott.

Encore allows Whimsicott to use Substitute, Cotton Guard, and Toxic repeatedly against Pokemon who use any non-damaging attack or Fake Out. After one Cotton Guard, Archeops' Acrobatics only 3HKOes Whimsicott. With two Cotton Guards under its belt, Whimsicott's Substitutes will almost never break from physical attacks.</p> <p>Double Team is another option to use in the 3rd or 4th moveslot. Less HP EVs are used to make sure that Leech Seed will heal back a larger percentage of Whimsicott's HP. The less HP EVs Whimsicott uses, the more times it can use Substitute. Leftovers increases HP recovery. In conjunction with Leech Seed, Leftovers also makes Whimsicott very difficult to take down. If you are concerned about Taunt from an opponent's Pokemon, consider using Mental Herb.</p> <p>Subseed is a stalling strategy. When looking for teammates, keep in mind that defensively oriented Pokemon will work the best. Common methods for stall teams abuse moves like Swagger and Double Team. This set can't touch Amoonguss at all, so having a teammate that can is a must. Archeops, Tornadus, and Chandelure can quickly dispose of the mushroom with their strong STAB attacks.

Dark Gem can power up Crunch in order to do massive damage to common Trick Room users, but this job is generally better performed by Golurk.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Hydreigon completely shuts down Krookodile, as it resists both of its STAB attacks. Krookodile can't do much to Amoonguss, one of the biggest threats in VGC 2011. Even Rock Slide cannot take down Mandibuzz, who can easily stall out Krookodile with Toxic and Roost. Conkeldurr can 2HKO Krookodile with its STAB Fighting-type attacks. Another check to Krookodile is Escavalier, who takes negligible damage from all of Krookodile's moves and KOes it in return with a STAB Megahorn.</p>",

      "Intimidate": {
        "description": "<p>Krookodile has two of the best STAB attacks in VGC. Earthquake smacks around all Pokemon on the field, and the STAB boost compensates for the power drop of spread attacks. Crunch hits the myriad of Ghost- and Psychic-types for super effective damage. Rock Slide KOes Flying-type Pokemon, and offers good coverage along with Krookodile's other moves. Low Sweep is rather situational, but it does help against Hydreigon and Virizion.</p> <p>Using a 92 HP / 252 Atk / 164 EV spread outpaces neutral natured 252 Speed Chandelure. Running maximum Speed on Krookodile only outspeeds neutral natured 252 Speed Excadrill, and ties with Leavanny. Both of these Pokemon are rarely seen outside of weather, so running maximum Speed on Krookodile is wasteful.</p> <p>Flying-type Pokemon are the best teammates for Krookodile. Special mention goes to Thundurus, who can form a potent combo with Krookodile, as each Pokemon is immune to the other's STAB attack. Thundurus can also cripple support Pokemon with Taunt. Virizion resists both of Krookodile's STAB attacks, and can hit back with a super effective STAB attack of its own. Bisharp receives an Attack boost from Intimidate, but is outsped and KOed by Earthquake. Choice Scarf Jellicent is another fantastic check to Krookodile, as Water Spout will easily OHKO Krookodile when Jellicent is at full health.</p>"

  "Gothitelle": {
    "overview": "<p>Gothitelle is a fairly decent Pokemon; however it lacks many of the important traits it needs to compete with many of the other Psychic-types in the VGC 2011 metagame. Despite this, it provides a bit of originality and can offer some surprise factor.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Gothitelle can also run an excellent support set. With access to both Reflect and Light Screen, Gothitelle, equipped with Light Clay, can set up screens that give your team the ability to tank hits. It also gets Rain Dance, which it can set up to help teammates who can take advantage of it. Gothitelle also has access to Thunder Wave and Toxic, which can harm opponents greatly throughout the match.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Gothitelle's main counters are nearly anything that can resist both Psychic and Shadow Ball. Notable ones are Scrafty, Krookodile, and Hydreigon. Without proper support, Gothitelle will be totally walled by these powerful Pokemon. Its checks are bulkier Ghost-types as well as others who can shrug off Psychic and Shadow Ball. Jellicent, Tornadus, Thundurus, Landorus, and many of the commonly seen offensive Pokemon can bother Gothitelle. It also does not resist the very common move Heat Wave, Water Spout, Surf, Rock Slide, and Earthquake that are all around the VGC metagame.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Gothitelle's best use in VGC is as a Trick Room starter. With fairly decent stats, Gothitelle takes many hits and dishes back some pain. Outside of Trick Room, however, Gothitelle can really fall short, so it's important to try and get it up quickly. Its bulkiness is what makes it somewhat useful, as this allows for it to take even super effective hits with ease and set up.</p> <p>Gothitelle has decent enough coverage in order to make it a worthwhile try on any aspiring Trick Room team. With STAB Psychic, many of the common Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Conkeldurr fear it. Shadow Ball allows for coverage against Ghost-types who may threaten Gothitelle in certain situations. Protect is a golden move in VGC, allowing Gothitelle to not only scout its opponent's item with Frisk, but also take advantage of seeing one of its moves.</p> <p>Gothitelle tends to be outclassed by both Reuniclus and Musharna. Reuniclus boasts a higher Special Attack and HP stats, as well as lower speed, making it a better candidate to set up and sweep. Musharna also is bulkier than Gothitelle, and has a higher Special Attack stat, which also makes it a stronger Trick Room starter. However, Gothitelle has more special bulk than both of them, allowing it to tank hits. It is also much less used, which can catch opponents off guard. Overall, Gothitelle doesn't have much to use to damage the opponent, which can leave it in a bad position in the game. More often than not, Gothitelle can be dead weight, but if supported right it can be a great set up Pokemon.</p>"

  "Chandelure": {
    "overview": "<p>Chandelure is one of the most powerful and versatile Pokemon in VGC 2011. With monstrous Special Attack, excellent typing, powerful dual STAB attacks, access to Trick Room, and good Speed and defenses, Chandelure is a threat to any team. While it is weak to moves such as Rock Slide and Earthquake, and is outsped by many common Pokemon, it can overcome these obstacles with proper support. Overall, Chandelure is an absolute powerhouse, and can be a huge asset to any team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Flash Fire can feasibly be run over Flame Body on the Choice Scarf set, but it only really helps against opposing Chandelure, as Fire-type attacks are quite uncommon in VGC 2011. Flash Fire gives Chandelure a boost should the opposing Chandelure use Heat Wave, but it's far more likely that the opposing Chandelure will just use Shadow Ball, making Flash Fire almost useless. Either Fire Gem or Ghost Gem can help Chandelure against a specific threat. A Fire Gem-boosted Heat Wave OHKOes Amoonguss, so Chandelure doesn't have to use the single-targeting Fire Blast, and a Ghost Gem-boosted Shadow Ball OHKOes nearly every Ghost- and Psychic-type in the metagame, making Chandelure especially potent against opposing Trick Room teams. Taunt is an option to stop opposing setup, but with Chandelure's Speed, it'll only be able to stop Trick Room, and Imprison does that very effectively already without being blocked by Mental Herb.</p> <p>Will-O-Wisp may seem like a good idea to cripple Pokemon that might threaten Chandelure, but when Chandelure has so much attacking power at its disposal, it's much more effective to just attack and KO the opponent than attempting to cripple them. Fire Blast can be run over Overheat on any of the sets to avoid the Special Attack drop, but its lower accuracy and inability to guarantee an OHKO on the genies and Amoonguss generally makes it the inferior choice. Chandelure can run Flame Charge to increase its Speed without having to resort to using a Choice Scarf, but Trick Room does that very effectively already, and Tailwind is a far more effective way to increase Speed. Chandelure can use Choice Specs to make its attacks incredibly powerful, but loses the ability to set up Trick Room, and must be used in Tailwind or Trick Room due to its low Speed. Chandelure can become a powerful Tailwind abuser with its middling Speed and huge Special Attack, and can form the core of a strategy involving both Tailwind and Trick Room.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Users of Rock Slide and Earthquake, such as Terrakion and Landorus, threaten to quickly remove Chandelure from the match. However, they need to be careful, as Fake Out users such as Scrafty can immobilize them for a turn and allow Chandelure to set up Trick Room, outspeeding and hitting them hard the next turn. While Chandelure's incredible attacking prowess makes it much less prone to Taunt than other Trick Room users, an untimely Taunt can stop Chandelure from setting up Trick Room, leaving it susceptible to faster attackers which can take advantage of its many weaknesses. Hydreigon resists both of Chandelure's STAB moves, only fearing a super effective Hidden Power, and can OHKO in return with its STAB Dark Pulse. Sucker Punch users, such as Bisharp, Druddigon, and Heatmor, can threaten to KO Chandelure before it moves, even if Trick Room is up, although they must be wary of a Rage Powder user, which can redirect and neutralize any Sucker Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Chandelure makes for a fantastic Trick Room user, with its middling Speed allowing it to set up Trick Room against faster teams and outspeed and attack other Trick Room teams with its powerful dual STAB attacks. Heat Wave and Shadow Ball are Chandelure's dual STAB options, attaining almost perfect coverage and allowing it to hit all other Trick Room users for super effective damage, making it a formidable weapon against both faster teams and opposing Trick Room teams. Protect allows Chandelure to avoid taking damage from its many weaknesses for a turn, giving its partner a turn to eliminate any Pokemon that may be threatening it.</p> <p>The EVs and nature allow Chandelure to hit as hard as possible while retaining some decent bulk, letting it take most neutral hits and outspeed most Trick Room Pokemon. Focus Sash allows Chandelure to always survive an attack, letting it bypass some of its weaknesses and always set up Trick Room or fire off a powerful attack. Flash Fire makes opposing Chandelure very wary of using Heat Wave, which can help a partner weak to Fire-type attacks.</p> <p>Overheat is an option over Heat Wave purely because it allows Chandelure to beat Amoonguss, OHKOing most sets and making Chandelure a much more effective check to Trick Room teams. However, the Special Attack drop after using it, along with the lack of spread damage, usually makes it the inferior option. Chandelure can run Imprison over Protect to completely stop Trick Room from being set up while Chandelure is alive. The opposing team can just attack Chandelure while it uses Imprison, so it's not a foolproof strategy. If Imprison is used, Chandelure should run maximum Speed with a Timid nature, allowing it to outpace almost all other Chandelure and shut them down with Imprison right off the bat. A Timid nature also allows Chandelure to outspeed Adamant Krookodile, and severely damage it with Heat Wave or Overheat.</p> <p>A Quiet nature with 0 Speed IVs allows Chandelure to outspeed more Pokemon with Trick Room in effect, but reduces Chandelure's ability to check other Trick Room teams with its relatively high Speed stat. While Chandelure can outspeed many Pokemon that would normally outspeed it in Trick Room with a Quiet nature, a Modest nature allows Chandelure to take advantage of its relatively high Speed to provide an excellent check to other Trick Room teams, outspeeding and doing severe damage to most Trick Room users with its STAB Shadow Ball.</p> <p>Chandelure makes for an excellent lead for faster Trick Room teams, able to set up Trick Room against speedier teams and hit other Trick Room users hard with STAB Shadow Ball. Pokemon such as Scrafty, Samurott, and Emboar pair well with Chandelure due to their middling Speed, allowing them to hit hard against opposing Trick Room teams and faster teams. Conkeldurr also makes a great partner, helping to KO both Terrakion and Hydreigon with its STAB Fighting-type moves. Chandelure has weaknesses to Rock Slide and Earthquake, so a Water- or Fighting-type partner, such as Samurott or Scrafty, can also take advantage of Trick Room and hit most Rock Slide and Earthquake users very hard with their super effective STAB attacks. Chandelure is also weak to Sucker Punch and Aqua Jet, so Amoonguss can prove very useful, redirecting those moves to itself using Rage Powder, and taking advantage of Trick Room to outspeed and use Spore on the opponent.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Chandelure is an excellent check to many faster teams, doing severe damage to many frailer Pokemon with its powerful dual STAB. Overheat gives Chandelure a strong STAB move that deals excellent damage to most offensive Pokemon, always OHKOing the genies and Amoonguss. Shadow Ball forms the second half of Chandelure's dual STAB, and allows it to do excellent damage to most Trick Room users. Heat Wave allows Chandelure to do some powerful spread damage, hitting anything that doesn't resist it quite hard. Hidden Power Ice allows Chandelure to deal with Dragon-types such as Hydreigon much more easily. The EVs and nature allow Chandelure to hit as hard as possible but still outspeed the entire metagame, as well as many Pokemon under Tailwind, with a Choice Scarf attached.</p> <p>A Timid nature can be used to outspeed other Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Adamant Krookodile and opposing Modest Chandelure, but the loss in power is noticeable, and the increase in Speed is largely unnecessary. Alternately, a spread of 100 HP / 252 SpA / 156 Spe can be used with a Modest nature, which still outspeeds the genies while giving Chandelure more bulk. With it, though, Chandelure loses to other Choice Scarf Pokemon, and doesn't have the ability to outspeed as many Pokemon under Tailwind as it does with 252 Speed EVs. Psychic does more damage to Terrakion than any other move Chandelure can carry, doing over 80% to 4 HP Terrakion.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Chandelure has the ability to take out many faster Pokemon with its huge Special Attack, so slower Pokemon can take advantage of Choice Scarf Chandelure as a partner. Scrafty has weaknesses to many common attacks and is quite slow, but Chandelure's Overheat OHKOes the genies, and a combination of Fake Out and Hidden Power Ice OHKOes Archeops, allowing Scrafty to attack much more effectively.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Volcarona is a potent special sweeper, with a Special Attack stat nearly matching that of Chandelure. It is also the only Pokemon other than Amoonguss with Rage Powder, giving it a unique combination of sheer power and team support. Volcarona is not a Pokemon that should be overlooked. It is, however, plagued by a horrific defensive typing, with a 4x weakness to Rock Slide, and weaknesses to Surf, Water Spout, and Acrobatics as well. The only positive for its defensive typing is a resistance to Fighting-type moves, but most Fighting-type Pokemon carry Rock Slide anyway.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sunny Day and Quiver Dance can be used if you utilize a Wide Guard partner to protect yourself from Rock Slide. Flamethrower is an option if you want a powerful Fire-type single target move that won't drop your Special Attack. Fiery Dance's 80 Base Power is lower than Flamethrower's 95, but Fiery Dance will give you a +1 Special Attack boost half of the time. Finally, Fire Blast is a fourth option for Volcarona's Fire-type STAB. It is much more powerful than Flamethrower, but still doesn't reach many of the OHKOs that Overheat gets, and its accuracy is shaky. SolarBeam is an option if you are using Volcarona in sun, mainly to hit Jellicent. Hidden Power Rock can be used to hit Chandelure and other Fire-types.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Rock Slide hits Volcarona hard, but that can be played around by using Wide Guard. Water Spout Jellicent is also a threat to Volcarona, though Wide Guard can once again protect the moth. Volcarona's Flying-type weakness can be targeted by Acrobatics users such as Tornadus and Archeops. Chandelure is immune to whatever Fire-type attack Volcarona has, and resists Bug Buzz, meanwhile 2HKOing Volcarona with Shadow Ball.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Heat Wave hits both opponents hard, but will rarely OHKO either of them. Overheat, on the other hand, scores quite a few OHKOs, including Amoonguss, 4 HP Tornadus and Thundurus a majority of the time, and many others. If you plan to focus more on supporting with Rage Powder while using Volcarona, Overheat is probably the better option because the Special Attack drop will be less significant. Bug Buzz is your second STAB attack and it OHKOes the slower Hydreigon, while hitting Reuniclus and Musharna hard, too. Protect gives your partner time to kill threats to Volcarona such as the numerous Rock Slide users in the metagame. It is also needed to waste a turn of Fake Out while preserving your Focus Sash. Because Mienshao and Liepard are faster than Volcarona, it must Protect first turn to dodge Fake Out, which will occur before Rage Powder. Focus Sash is used because Volcarona has trouble with the frequency of Water-, Flying- and Rock-type moves.</p> <p>Volcarona needs 248 EVs in Speed and a Timid nature to outspeed Hydreigon and OHKO it with Bug Buzz. The last four are run just to Speed tie with opposing Volcarona. Volcarona is frail on the physical side, but can take special hits reasonably well thanks to its base 105 Special Defense stat. Its weaknesses and the heavy use of Rock Slide make Focus Sash clearly the best item. Life Orb or Charti Berry seem like good options, but Life Orb doesn't grant any notable OHKOs or 2HKOs, and Charti Berry often won't prevent Volcarona from being OHKOed by Rock Slide anyway due to its lackluster Defense.</p> <p>Volcarona is a strong stand-alone Pokemon but still enjoys and supports any kind of setup. The most noteworthy is Sunny Day, as it powers up Volcarona's already strong Fire-type moves. Tailwind is another good choice for support for Volcarona, allowing it to get the jump on the many Pokemon faster than it. Volcarona can even work in some kind of Trick Room team, despite having base 100 Speed, due to Rage Powder and Volcarona's ability to still undercut many common Pokemon. On a Trick Room team, an alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD should be used, along with a Quiet nature. A partner using Wide Guard remedies Volcarona's quadruple Rock Slide weakness and Water Spout weakness and so provides turns for Volcarona to attack. Inner Focus Mienshao stands out as one of the best partners to Volcarona with Fake Out and Wide Guard support.</p>"

However, access to boosting moves in Swords Dance and Shell Smash allows Crustle to boost its Attack to obscene levels, and with the right support, Crustle can rip apart unprepared teams. Crustle also receives a great ability in Sturdy, which acts as a built-in Focus Sash. This allows Crustle to almost always get off its boosting move, and proceed to wreck opposing teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Earthquake complements Rock Slide well coverage-wise, although an immune partner should be used to avoid hurting Crustle's team. If you would rather hit one Pokemon instead of two, Stone Edge could be used instead, but hitting two Pokemon is such a great utility that Rock Slide should almost always be used. Crustle receives Curse, although it takes time to set up, and more than one turn dedicated to set up is not wise in VGC. Night Slash hits Ghost-types such as Cofagrigus and Golurk for super effective damage, though it is not usually worth a slot over one of Crustle's other moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Mienshao is a great counter to Crustle, utilizing Fake Out to neutralize Sturdy and resisting both of Crustle's STABs. Conkeldurr and Golurk are good counters to Crustle, resisting both of its STABs. Amoonguss checks Crustle, putting it to sleep with Spore while, without a boost, Crustle struggles to do much damage to it.

        "description": "<p>With base 45 Speed, Crustle is perfect for Trick Room. Sturdy allows Crustle to use Swords Dance once, and if Trick Room is set up, Crustle can outspeed and heavily damage most of the metagame. Rock Slide is Crustle's main STAB move and, in addition to hitting both opponents, it has a flinch chance. With a Swords Dance boost and Rock Gem, Rock Slide does a great deal of damage to most Pokemon. Rock Blast, however, OHKOes Chandelure through Focus Sash, something that should be considered. It also KOes Thundurus through Substitute in two hits, so it is not nearly as risky as one might think. X-Scissor is Crustle's other STAB move, hitting Pokemon that resist Rock Slide such as Krookodile for super effective damage. X-Scissor is also useful when facing opposing Trick Room teams, denting Psychic-types such as Musharna and Reuniclus. Protect allows Crustle's partner time to set up Trick Room, and also shields Crustle from a threatening Pokemon, giving Crustle's teammate time to eliminate the Pokemon. Swords Dance doubles Crustle's normally average base 95 Attack, allowing it to dish out powerful Rock Slides.</p> <p>A Rock Gem gives Crustle a one-time powerful Rock Slide, which can help if Crustle has been unable to Swords Dance. A Lum Berry could be used instead, though, if you fear Amoonguss. A Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs makes Crustle as slow as possible, so in Trick Room, Crustle can move before most other Pokemon. The EVs are invested in Attack and HP to give Crustle as much power and bulk as it can get, while the Brave nature boosts Crustle's Attack even higher.</p> <p>This set relies on Trick Room being set up, so naturally, Trick Room users make great teammates. Musharna can reliably set up Trick Room, and boosts Crustle's attacks further with Helping Hand. Jellicent can set up Trick Room and finishes off Pokemon that Rock Slide does not KO with its powerful Water Spout. Cofagrigus can Will-O-Wisp physical attackers that threaten Crustle such as Mienshao, whom Crustle has a hard time dealing with. Cofagrigus also fills the role of bulky Trick Room user, that Crustle loves to have as a teammate.</p>"

A White Herb, however, allows Crustle to keep the boosts and restores its defenses, making Shell Smash into one of the best moves in the game. After a Shell Smash, Crustle reaches 212 Speed, which outspeeds all Pokemon lacking Choice Scarf in the metagame. Rock Slide is used again for STAB, though if you want the ability to OHKO Chandelure and Thundurus through a Focus Sash and Substitute, respectively, Rock Blast should be used. Crustle's second STAB move comes in the form of X-Scissor, hitting Pokemon that resist Rock Slide such as Scrafty. Protect is a great utility move in VGC, letting Crustle stall out Trick Room or give time for Crustle's ally to KO a threat.</p> <p>With a White Herb, Crustle can ignore the stat reduction of Shell Smash, and proceed to sweep without lowered defenses. A Lum Berry, however, lets Crustle take on Amoonguss and KO it with support from its teammates. A Jolly nature and 252 Speed EVs are used to outspeed every Pokemon in VGC after a Shell Smash, though Adamant gives Crustle more power at the expense of some Speed.</p> <p>Amoonguss is a detriment to Crustle, so a Pokemon that can take care of it such as Tornadus is greatly appreciated. Tornadus also takes care of Fighting-types such as Mienshao and Conkeldurr, that laugh at Crustle's STAB moves and hit it hard with Drain Punch. Ironically, Amoonguss is a great partner for Crustle, as it can Spore Pokemon that may otherwise give Crustle trouble, and draw off attacks aimed at Crustle with Rage Powder.</p>"

Hidden Power Dark is useful for attacking opposing Ghost-types such as Chandelure, and also does a large amount of damage to Jellicent, which neuters its Water Spout.

A Focus Sash allows Beartic to survive any attack and retaliate, so it's worth consideration. Ice Punch is a more reliable option over Icicle Crash, but the power drop is noticeable. Brick Break can work over Superpower to avoid the stat drop, but its low Base Power makes it an inferior choice in most situations. While Hail is certainly an option to support a hail team and abuse Blizzard, Beartic's multitude of weaknesses due to its Ice typing and its low Speed makes it ineffective in this role, as opposed to a bulky Water-type such as Jellicent or Samurott. Beartic can utilize Taunt to stop Trick Room from being set up or stop Amoonguss, but Roar stops Trick Room far more reliably, and Beartic does huge damage to Amoonguss anyway with its super effective STAB Icicle Crash. Encore is available to lock opposing Pokemon into a support move, which can occasionally prove useful, but a Prankster user such as Whimsicott is far more effective in this role due to its priority on the move.</p> <p>Beartic has access to Yawn, which can incapacitate an opponent or at least force them to switch out, but it's easy to avoid, and doesn't gel well with Beartic's numerous weaknesses, making it generally useless. Beartic can also run Icy Wind, slowing down and damaging faster opponents and allowing slower teammates to outspeed and take them down, but its low Base Power means that it's only really useful for the Speed drop, and using Tailwind or Trick Room support achieves the same effect much more reliably anyway. Ice Gem is an option to allow Beartic to OHKO most Amoonguss with Icicle Crash, but it only works for a single turn, so Life Orb is generally more effective to allow Beartic to do consistent damage with Icicle Crash. Beartic's base 70 Special Attack means that it can feasibly use its STAB Blizzard to attain some useful spread coverage, but its low accuracy, coming off of Beartic's lower attacking stat, means that it is only really useful in hail, where other Ice-types such as Cryogonal or Vanilluxe, with their higher Special Attack, will be far more effective at abusing Blizzard.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Terrakion, Scrafty, and Conkeldurr can do severe damage to or OHKO Beartic with their STAB Fighting-type moves, while Beartic can at best 2HKO them in return with Icicle Crash. Almost any Fire-type can severely damage or KO Beartic with its STAB Fire-type moves.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Beartic's Icicle Crash has excellent super effective coverage in VGC 2011, OHKOing or doing severe damage to the genie trio, Hydreigon, Whimsicott, and many other common Pokemon. Shadow Claw allows Beartic to hit Chandelure and Jellicent, two common Pokemon that resist Icicle Crash, for super effective damage, and attains good neutral coverage with Icicle Crash, only missing out on opposing Steel-types. Superpower hits Steel-types such as Bisharp and Ferrothorn for super effective damage, and also secures an OHKO on Terrakion. Protect allows Beartic to stall out Trick Room or opposing Tailwind and sidestep its many weaknesses by allowing its partner a turn to eliminate a threatening member of the opposing team.</p> <p>The EVs and nature allow Beartic to hit as hard as possible, and allow it to reach 90 Speed, outspeeding everything up to the genies under Tailwind, while also retaining its nice bulk. A Charti Berry allows Beartic to easily take a Rock Slide and retaliate with a powerful Icicle Crash, OHKOing most common Rock Slide users.</p> <p>Roar allows Beartic to shut down opposing Trick Room leads, stopping it from being set up regardless of whether they carry Mental Herb, and also revealing another member of the opponent's team. A Life Orb allows Beartic to hit much harder, achieving vital OHKOs on Hydreigon and Druddigon. But the recoil damage, when coupled with Beartic's myriad weaknesses, means it will die a lot more quickly, making it a much less effective lead. Beartic can be quite effective on a Tailwind team, as its access to Roar allows it to reliably stop Trick Room from being set up. Tornadus and Sigilyph specifically can benefit from Beartic, as its STAB Icicle Crash OHKOes almost all users of Rock Slide, a move that hits both Tornadus and Sigilyph for super effective damage. The two Flying-types can then set up Tailwind to help Beartic outspeed and wreck opponents, and then can also do severe damage to Conkeldurr and Terrakion, the two Rock Slide users that Beartic cannot easily KO. Roar will not stop Whimsicott from using Trick Room due to its ability Prankster, so pairing Beartic with a Taunt user such as Tornadus is a good idea. Beartic also has trouble with Fire-types, such as Chandelure and Darmanitan. A Rock Slide or Earthquake user such as Archeops or Landorus can KO them before they have a chance to threaten Beartic.</p> <p>Beartic can also work well on a Trick Room team, outspeeding quite a bit in Trick Room with its low Speed, and hitting hard with its STAB Icicle Crash. If used in Trick Room, Beartic does not require Roar, and should use an EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def with a Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs, which allows it to hit as hard as possible, and outspeed as much as it can in Trick Room.</p>"

  "Cryogonal": {
    "overview": "<p>Cryogonal has usable Speed and Special Attack, and a brilliant STAB typing in Ice. It also has an excellent Special Defense stat, capable of surviving Chandelure's super effective Heat Wave, allowing it to serve as a reasonably bulky special attacker. However, its absolutely terrible Defense stat and numerous weaknesses due to its Ice typing means it will hardly ever survive a physical hit, although its ability, Levitate, allows it to avoid Earthquake. Cryogonal's STAB Ice Beam or Blizzard does severe damage to many of the common Pokemon in VGC 2011, but its movepool is relatively barren otherwise. While Cryogonal may not be the best choice for many teams, its ability to fire off a fast and powerful Ice Beam can prove deadly, and gives it a definite niche over its fellow Ice-type, Vanilluxe.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Cryogonal can run Icy Wind, slowing down and damaging faster opponents and allowing slower teammates to outspeed and take them down, but its low Base Power means that it's only really useful for the Speed drop, and having Tailwind or Trick Room up can much more reliably and effectively allow slower teammates to outspeed the opponent. A Charti Berry allows Cryogonal to almost always survive a Terrakion's Rock Slide, provided it does not hold a boosting item, but means that Cryogonal will easily lose to the multitude of Fighting-type moves and is generally an inferior option. Cryogonal can equip an Ice Jewel to do severe damage to or OHKO most Amoonguss sets with Ice Beam, but it leaves it open to a multitude of physical attacks such as Rock Slide that it just can't take with its base 30 Defense. Light Screen can be used in conjunction with Reflect to make Cryogonal extremely hard to take down with special attacks, and also makes it a usable dual screen user, but its terribly low Defense stat and inability to outspeed Terrakion and the genies means that a faster, physically bulkier dual screen user such as Serperior is usually a better choice for the job. Recover allows Cryogonal to abuse its excellent special bulk and throw around a few more Ice Beams before dying. However, its atrocious physical frailty means that any sort of defensive moveset will prove ineffective.</p> <p>Hail is an option to allow Cryogonal and its teammates to abuse a 100% accurate Blizzard, which is quite deadly in VGC 2011, but as with other support moves, Cryogonal's terrible physical bulk and middling Speed, coupled with its inability to deal with the genies and Terrakion, means that Cryogonal will likely die before it is able to abuse Blizzard, or even before it is able to set up hail. A bulky Water-type, such as Jellicent or Samurott. is generally superior for setting up Hail due to their greater bulk and lack of the weaknesses that plague Ice-types. Other types of Hidden Power are also viable options; although Hidden Power Dark hits the two most common Pokemon that resist Ice Beam, Jellicent and Chandelure, for super effective damage, Hidden Power Electric retains the super effective hit on Jellicent, and also hits other Water-types such as Samurott hard, attaining a pseudo-BoltBeam coverage. Hidden Power Water still hits Chandelure hard, but also hits other Fire-types, such as Emboar, Darmanitan, and Volcarona, for super effective damage. Hidden Power Fire hits Steel-types as well as opposing Ice-types for super effective damage, so it's also a reasonable choice. Explosion may seem like a good idea to get some good spread damage, but Cryogonal's terrible Attack stat and the move's nerf from last generation means that it will do absolutely pitiful damage, maxing out at 80.1% damage on opposing Cryogonal, the most physically frail Pokemon in the tier.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>A Rock Slide from Terrakion or Conkeldurr easily brings Cryogonal down to its Focus Sash, while Conkeldurr's Mach Punch will often KO it quite quickly. While 2HKOed by Hidden Power Dark, Chandelure can still do huge damage with its super effective STAB Heat Wave, and can set up Trick Room to outspeed Cryogonal. 252/0 Jellicent takes a maximum of 36.7% from a super effective Hidden Power, and resists Ice Beam, allowing it to easily take any of Cryogonal's attacks. Most Fighting-types are a complete pain for Cryogonal, easily OHKOing it with their STAB Fighting-type moves. Cryogonal is also useless against Darmanitan without Hidden Power Water, unable to 2HKO it, while Darmanitan easily OHKOes with Flare Blitz or Fire Punch. Steel-types leave Cryogonal completely helpless, resisting its main STAB and easily OHKOing back with their STAB moves. However, they must watch out for Hidden Power Fire, which severely damages most Steel-types.</p> <p>Most Trick Room users can completely stop Cryogonal, as Trick Room uses its relatively good Speed against it, and leaves it open to crushing physical assaults that will almost always leave it KOed; additionally, Cryogonal cannot deal much damage to any common Trick Room user, allowing them to set up freely. Almost all priority users will bring Cryogonal a swift death due to its atrocious Defense stat, and Fake Out users can break its Focus Sash while preventing it from moving unless Cryogonal uses Protect. Many Tailwind teams can leave Cryogonal in the dust as well, bypassing its Speed and hitting it on its weak Defense stat. If Cryogonal's partner has Tailwind, though, Cryogonal's excellent super effective coverage with Ice Beam and good Speed will make it difficult for many Tailwind teams to stop. Choice Scarf users can completely destroy Cryogonal, outspeeding it before it can attack and likely KOing it due to Cryogonal's terrible Defense stat. However, if its partner can get Tailwind up, Cryogonal's good Speed stat allows it to bypass most Choice Scarf users.</p>",

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Cryogonal's Ice Beam has excellent coverage, and can OHKO or do severe damage to the genie trio, Hydreigon, Whimsicott, and a multitude of other common Pokemon. Hidden Power Dark allows Cryogonal to do decent damage to Jellicent and Chandelure, two common Pokemon that resist Ice Beam, while its huge Special Defense stat allows it to take any of their attacks in return. Protect is a staple move in doubles play, and is especially useful on Cryogonal due to its atrocious physical bulk, giving its partner a turn to eliminate physical attackers that may threaten it. Ice Shard provides a priority attack, breaking Focus Sashes and Tornadus's and Thundurus's Substitutes, and it also allows Cryogonal to get a last hit off before going down.</p> <p>The given EVs and nature allow Cryogonal to outspeed Jolly Landorus, always break Tornadus's and Thundurus's Substitutes with Ice Shard, and hit as hard as possible off of base 95 Special Attack. Focus Sash allows Cryogonal to always survive a hit despite its terrible Defense, and guarantees it will fire off at least one Ice Beam. If Ice Shard is not being used, an alternate EV spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with a Timid nature should be used to allow Cryogonal to Speed tie with Mienshao.</p> <p>Blizzard is an option over Ice Beam, hitting about as hard against both opponents, but its terrible accuracy means that it's going to miss more often than not: in fact, there is only a 49% chance that Blizzard will hit both opponents. Unless used on a dedicated hail team to boost Blizzard's accuracy to 100%, Ice Beam is the superior choice. Reflect helps Cryogonal patch up its horrible Defense stat and support the team as it does so, but Ice Shard's ability to break Focus Sashes is generally more useful, as Cryogonal will often be killed before it is able to set up Reflect thanks to its merely good Speed stat and horrible Defense. Cryogonal's good Speed and STAB Ice Beam make it an ideal partner for anything that struggles with Dragon-types or the genies, or just needs something that can take a few special hits and retaliate.</p> <p>Archeops makes a good partner for Cryogonal, OHKOing most Rock Slide users with a Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics. A special attacking Tornadus can also work well, OHKOing Terrakion with Grass Knot and Conkeldurr with Air Slash, while also setting up Tailwind to allow Cryogonal to outspeed and KO the genie trio with Ice Beam. Wide Guard users are also helpful, as they block Rock Slide while Cryogonal attacks with Ice Beam. Chandelure causes quite a few problems for Cryogonal, resisting Cryogonal's STAB and hitting back with its STAB Fire-type moves. Terrakion's Rock Slide can do severe damage or OHKO Chandelure if Chandelure is not holding a Focus Sash, while Hydreigon resists both of Chandelure's STAB moves and OHKOes with Dark Pulse. Jellicent can cause problems as well due to with its resistance to Ice Beam and good special bulk. Hydreigon can again prove quite useful as a partner, easily 2HKOing Jellicent with Dark Pulse, while Chandelure can outspeed and 2HKO Jellicent with Shadow Ball, or even OHKO with a Ghost Gem attached.</p> <p>Due to its atrocious Defense stat, Cryogonal is very weak to priority, especially Fake Out. While a Fast Guard user such as Archeops or Terrakion can mitigate this somewhat, it is in no way a foolproof solution, especially because the Fast Guard user is vulnerable to normal attacks as they use Fast Guard. A Rage Powder user can redirect priority attacks; Amoonguss in particular can easily take any Mach Punch or Quick Attack thrown at it, while Sucker Punch fails against it. In addition, Amoonguss can use Spore on an opponent while Cryogonal uses Protect, incapacitating the opponent and removing a threat to Cryogonal in a single move. A Pokemon that simply hits really hard, such as Archeops, Conkeldurr, or Terrakion, can also help, KOing most priority users with their sheer strength.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Liepard is the fastest user of Fake Out in VGC; however, a bad typing and dismal defenses keep it from being a top tier threat. STAB Sucker Punch and various support moves make Liepard usable, but it is rather predictable on the whole, and outclassed by other common VGC Pokemon. Snatch is Liepard's best weapon against common Tailwind teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Charm is a handy move that neuters Haxorus, Scrafty, Conkeldurr, and many other slower physical attackers. Taunt is a fantastic move that stops Amoonguss cold and prevents Trick Room from being set up, which are two of Liepard's biggest problems. Thunder Wave can cripple Thundurus, Hydreigon, and similar fast threats. Liepard has access to Torment, Thief, and Covet, adding to its unpredictable nature. These moves, however, face sheer competition for a moveslot. Liepard may also be used to set up Sunny Day or Rain Dance, but this job is better left to Whimsicott and Thundurus, respectively.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Terrakion is Liepard's nemesis. Outspeeding it by a few points, carrying a super effective Close Combat, and grabbing an Attack boost from Liepard's prime attack makes Terrakion Liepard's greatest threat. Hydreigon is a decent check to Liepard. None of Hydreigon's common moves can be Snatched and it also resists Sucker Punch, so Hydreigon is free to attack as it likes. Krookodile is very similar to Hydreigon in this regard. Liepard has no way of dealing heavy damage to Bisharp and Mienshao, who can easily KO Liepard with a STAB move. Slower, hard hitting Pokemon such as Gigalith or Conkeldurr can shrug off a Sucker Punch and smack Liepard around with a STAB move of choice.</p>",

      "Fake Out Support": {
        "description": "<p>Liepard is the fastest user of Fake Out in VGC. Unfortunately, this isn't much of a advantage for it, as Mienshao has Inner Focus, and is therefore unaffected by Liepard's Fake Out. STAB Sucker Punch is the second move on the set, and it does massive damage to Chandelure, Jellicent, and has a chance to 2HKO Thundurus and Tornadus. Snatch is Liepard's selling point. It steals the effects of common support moves such as Tailwind and Wide Guard as they are used, while it prevents set up in front of Liepard. Protect can be useful as it helps Liepard when it is confronted by one of the abundant Fighting-types; however, Encore helps Liepard take advantage of Pokemon that attempt to use Protect against a predicted Fake Out. Liepard is best used when common Tailwind Pokemon are seen in the Team Preview. Fake Out followed by Snatch will disrupt Whimsicott's and Tornadus's strategy; however, one must be aware that Snatch does not steal Whimsicott's Encore.</p> <p>Limber is used over Unburden for a few reasons. Limber prevents paralysis from Discharge or Prankster Thunder Wave, as well as the small chance of paralysis from Effect Spore Amoonguss. Unburden can be relatively useful for Liepard, as when equipped with a Dark Gem, Sucker Punch gets a great power boost, while Liepard itself will gain a good boost to its Speed. However, Liepard is then prone to an OHKO from almost any physical attacker in VGC 11, as it has to forsake its Focus Sash. A Jolly nature is used to outspeed Mienshao, allowing Liepard to Encore an opponent's move before being hit by Drain Punch or Hi Jump Kick.</p> <p>Liepard is a Pokemon capable of disrupting the opponent's strategy. As such, another Pokemon that can take advantage of the disruption is necessary. Pokemon capable of dealing heavy damage while functioning well in a Snatched Tailwind are the best teammates for Liepard. Terrakion, Chandelure, and Hydreigon are great choices for this role. Because of Liepard's mediocre defenses, any Pokemon with a high Attack stat that is not weak to Sucker Punch can handle Liepard. The best Pokemon for the job is Bisharp, as its abilities can render both Fake Out and Charm useless, while it also resists Liepard's main attack.</p>"

Although it is outclassed offensively by Reuniclus, Musharna makes better use of its defensive stats and has access to a superior ability for double battles.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Musharna has an array of moves at its disposal. In terms of damaging moves, Shadow Ball can be used to hit Reuniclus, Chandelure, and Jellicent harder. Hidden Power Fighting is an option, granting coverage on Scrafty and Hydreigon. Unfortunately, it will not OHKO these Pokemon. Imprison can completely stop Trick Room from going up and stop other Pokemon from using Protect. It can also prevent other Musharna and Reuniclus from using Psychic on Musharna's teammate. This makes the Terrakion and Musharna combo that much more potent. Magic Coat is a fantastic move that bounces back Taunt, Encore, and Spore. Safeguard can completely shut down Amoonguss. Hypnosis is viable to stop powerful Pokemon such as Scrafty from OHKOing Musharna. A more physically defensive set may fit your team better, so a spread utilizing a Relaxed nature with an EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD is viable. This spread takes Rock Slide from Terrakion and Crunch from Krookodile much better. On the other hand, a base 107 Special Attack stat is difficult to ignore, so an offensive set may be utilized. Using a Modest nature and 12 Speed EVs lets Musharna outspeed neutral-natured Amoonguss.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Strong Pokemon who carry physically based super effective attacks pose an instant threat to Musharna. Scrafty is the best counter, as it has Crunch and functions well in Trick Room. Krookodile can deal massive damage to Musharna with a Dark Gem boosted Crunch and also has an immunity to Psychic-type attacks. Golurk has a chance to OHKO Musharna with a Ghost Gem, Iron Fist-boosted Shadow Punch. Hydreigon is immune to Psychic-type attacks and hits back hard with a STAB Dark Pulse. Taunt prevents Musharna without Mental Herb from using support moves.</p>",

Psychic is a powerful STAB move coming off of a base 107 Special Attack, capable of dealing high damage to common Pokemon such as Conkeldurr and Mienshao. Helping Hand works especially well with Musharna's ability, Telepathy. Being able to simultaneously boost a partner's Surf, Earthquake, or Explosion while maintaining immunity from these attacks is what sets Musharna apart from every other Trick Room user. Musharna has a couple of noteworthy move options in the last slot. Light Screen is a fantastic support move for both Pokemon and further increases Musharna's already impressive bulk. Moonlight works well in VGC 2011 due to the lack of instant weather.</p> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense EVs help Musharna take a Shadow Ball from Chandelure, Reuniclus, or Jellicent, a Bug Buzz from Volcarona, or a Dark Pulse from Hydreigon, and live to set up Trick Room. A Sassy nature also allows Musharna to better handle common neutral spread moves, such as Water Spout, Discharge, and Heat Wave. No Speed IVs are applied in order to be as fast as possible in Trick Room. Musharna can fit very well on an offensive team thanks to its phenomenal support moves. Helping Hand has priority and boosts a teammate's Attack and Special Attack for one turn. Musharna can also reverse Trick Room for Tailwind-based teams.</p> <p>Pokemon that can take advantage of Telepathy and function well in Trick Room are the best teammates for Musharna. A good example of this is Gigalith, who can easily use Earthquake or Explosion without forcing Musharna to Protect or take damage. On the other hand, Terrakion and Landorus also make phenomenal partners. Musharna handles Pokemon that trouble Landorus and Terrakion, such as Amoonguss. In return, both can hit opposing Pokemon that threaten Musharna for super effective damage, such as Bisharp and Chandelure.</p>"

Its ability, Lightning Rod, raises its modest Special Attack stat to an acceptable level after the first boost, making it a powerful attacker and supporter. However, its terrible defenses often hold it back; even powerful neutral attacks are usually enough to take it down. Furthermore, without a Lightning Rod boost, even Zebstrika's super effective attacks will often fail to KO the opposition, greatly impeding his clout. While it has subpar stats bar Speed, after a Lightning Rod boost, Zebstrika can still easily stampede through teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>For such a fast Pokemon, it's a shame Zebstrika didn't get more support moves. Light Screen and Thunder Wave are probably its best options. Zebstrika is one of the best users of Me First, being able to OHKO unsuspecting Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Terrakion with their own STAB moves. However, Me First becomes easy to play around once your opponent sees it. Quick Attack can be used to pick off weakened Pokemon and gives you one last attack before being picked off by other priority users. Although it has higher Attack than Special Attack, a physical set is not nearly as effective due to Zebstrika's poor physical movepool and Lightning Rod's ability to boost Zebstrika's Special Attack. Wild Charge, however, is more powerful than Thunderbolt initially, and can OHKO Jellicent. Motor Drive is almost always inferior to Lightning Rod; even if you were to use a physical set, Zebstrika is usually the second fastest Pokemon on the field when used in combination with Thundurus. Lightning Rod is more useful since it protects your teammates from Electric-type attacks regardless.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Trick Room in general is a good counter to Zebstrika due to Zebstrika and Thundurus being unable to KO common Trick Room starters. With its pitiful defenses, Zebstrika won't be taking many, if any, hits without Focus Sash after Trick Room is set up. Due to Zebstrika's mediocre Special Attack, most bulky Pokemon can take a hit and cause serious damage with a strong neutral attack. Seismitoad takes little damage from Hidden Power Ice and can OHKO with Earthquake. Besides Overheat, Amoonguss can sponge any of Zebstrika's hits pretty well.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Thundurus's Partner": {
        "description": "<p>Zebstrika makes a great partner alongside Pokemon weak to Electric-type attacks because of its ability, Lightning Rod, which draws all Electric attacks towards Zebstrika and raises its Special Attack. Discharge users such as Thundurus also make wonderful partners due to their ability to boost Zebstrika while damaging the opponent. Overheat OHKOes most Steel-types. When holding a Life Orb, the combined damage of Thundurus's Electric Gem-boosted Discharge and Zebstrika's Lightning Rod boosted Overheat will OHKO standard Amoonguss roughly 98% of the time. Life Orb is the preferred item, guaranteeing an OHKO on non-Yache Berry Landorus and Tornadus with Hidden Power Ice and Thunderbolt, respectively. Because of how frail Zebstrika and Thundurus are, a random Choice Scarf user can put the hurt on both of them; leading off with this combo may not be the best idea, however. Bringing in the duo later can be a much safer option, so as to not lose Zebstrika or Thundurus on the first turn to Choice Scarf users.</p> <p>It's important to note that Lightning Rod will redirect even your own Electric-type attacks towards Zebstrika. The only exception to this is Discharge, which will hit all Pokemon on the field, Zebstrika included. Though Life Orb is usually the preferred item, Focus Sash remains an option because Zebstrika's paper-thin defenses rarely allow it to take even two neutral hits.</p> <p>This set is meant to be used with a max Speed Thundurus. With 204 Speed EVs, Zebstrika will be one point slower than Thundurus, allowing it to attack after getting the Special Attack boost from Lightning Rod. An alternative spread with 252 Speed EVs allows it to outspeed everything with Choice Scarf slower than Jellicent and Whimsicott. Only Accelgor is faster without a Choice Scarf. Unfortunately, this will make you faster than Thundurus, meaning Zebstrika's first attack will only be coming off of a base 80 Special Attack, unless Zebstrika is successfully switched into an Electric-type move or paired with a Choice Scarf Thundurus, which can be an effective partner. Zebstrika partners up well with other Choice Scarf users such as Jellicent and Terrakion, as well. It absorbs any Thunder Waves directed at them and gains a Lightning Rod boost in the process, meaning not even Prankster Thundurus can shut them down.</p>"

However, its Normal typing allows it to serve as an effective Trick Room user that is able to remain useful against Chandelure, a feat few other Trick Room users can boast. Although Audino's weakness to Fighting-type attacks along with its mediocre stats may make it seem useless at first glance, its bevy of support options makes it a useful Trick Room supporter.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Audino has access to Simple Beam, which in conjunction with a bulky setup sweeper can form a gimmicky but viable strategy. For example, a Scrafty or Conkeldurr with Bulk Up can quickly become an unstoppable force with Simple. Archeops also makes a good partner, with Simple Beam nullifying its ability Defeatist. However, Audino is vulnerable to Taunt and powerful attacks when it sets up, so it's rather unreliable. Return is an option for an attacking move so that Audino isn't complete Taunt bait, but it's so weak that it's hardly worth using. Healing Wish can allow Audino to bypass its tendency to become a sitting duck after setting up Trick Room, and also helps a teammate that's taken some previous damage, but it does KO Audino, making it generally a poor strategy. Audino has access to Sunny Day and Rain Dance, which can allow it to support a weather-based team as well as a Trick Room team. An additional advantage to using Audino for a weather team is its ability to set up even when it faces Imprison Chandelure, unlike a Trick Room supporter. While Whimsicott is far more effective at abusing Encore, it is still a viable option on Audino, allowing it to lock an opponent into a move such as Taunt, or in Chandelure's case, Imprison, which can prove game-breaking.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Any Fighting-type can do severe damage to Audino with its STAB attacks, and most can even OHKO Audino unless it uses a Chople Berry. Most Taunt users can completely incapacitate Audino unless it holds a Mental Herb. Chandelure with Imprison can stop Audino from setting up Trick Room, but it will then have to take a Helping Hand-boosted hit from Audino's teammate.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Trick Room allows Audino to support a team based around it. Audino is one of the few users of Heal Pulse in the tier, and it pairs well with Trick Room, allowing it to increase the survivability of a bulky attacker such as Reuniclus or keep Gigalith's Sturdy intact. Helping Hand makes up for Audino's lacking offensive stats by boosting the power of its partner's move, making it an excellent partner for Pokemon such as Conkeldurr with powerful spread attacks. Protect allows Audino to bypass its weaknesses for a turn and give its teammates a chance to eliminate Pokemon such as Conkeldurr that can harm Audino. Since Taunt shuts down Audino completely, Mental Herb is the best choice for an item, allowing Audino to continue supporting its partner even after getting Taunted once. The EVs and nature prevent Chandelure from 2HKOing Audino with Heat Wave, which means Chandelure can't easily shut it down, unlike other Trick Room users such as Musharna and Reuniclus. Healer allows Audino to act as a pseudo-cleric, healing its partners of status. This is all the more useful when considering the fact that Pokemon such as Amoonguss, which spread status around as much as possible, are commonly used in VGC 2011.</p> <p>Safeguard can be used to stop Amoonguss from putting Audino's teammates to sleep, but means Audino automatically loses to Fighting-types unless it holds a Chople Berry. A Chople Berry allows Audino to take any Fighting-type attack and continue to support its teammate, but makes it completely vulnerable to Taunt. A more physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Relaxed nature has an 86.5% chance to survive a Conkeldurr's Guts-boosted Drain Punch, allowing Audino to forgo a Chople Berry, but it does mean Audino is 2HKOed by Chandelure's Heat Wave, somewhat removing Audino's already tenuous niche. Teammates that can take advantage of Audino's Heal Pulse and Helping Hand include most slower Pokemon with spread attacks. For this reason, Conkeldurr makes a great partner, hitting hard with Helping Hand-boosted Rock Slide, while easily taking out Terrakion, a Pokemon with which Audino has significant trouble. Carracosta is also useful, as it can take out Terrakion with its STAB Waterfall and hit hard with Rock Slide, while taking advantage of Heal Pulse to maintain Sturdy. Audino has many problems with Fighting-types due to its weakness to their STAB attacks, so having a slow Psychic-type to attack them in Trick Room can help it tremendously. Reuniclus fills this role very well, taking advantage of Heal Pulse to maintain its good bulk, having the ability to OHKO almost every Fighting-type with its STAB Psychic, and doing huge damage to Amoonguss, which normally renders Audino useless with Spore.</p>"

Conkeldurr can work both in and out of Trick Room, making it a good choice for teams that don't want to be totally dependent on Trick Room. Blessed with a strong priority attack in Mach Punch, Conkeldurr becomes a reliable candidate for any VGC 2011 team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Fling can be used to burn an opponent's Pokemon. However, if the opponent uses Protect on that turn, you will have effectively wasted a moveslot. Facade can deal a hefty chunk of damage to a variety of Pokemon; however, relying on Normal / Fighting coverage leaves you helpless against Ghost-types. Sitrus Berry can be used to prolong Conkeldurr's lifespan, should you find the constant burn damage undesirable. However, unless Conkeldurr gets Guts activated in some way, it will suffer from a noticeable power drop. Coba Berry can be used to survive Acrobatics from Tornadus, Eelektross, and Archeops.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Bulky Psychic-types like Reuniclus and Musharna cause trouble for Conkeldurr, easily taking most of its attacks and KOing it in return with STAB Psychic. Amoonguss can also pose a threat to Conkeldurr, as it completely avoids being 2HKOed by the standard sets, though it can be troubled by Earthquake and must be wary of Facade. Tornadus can outspeed Conkeldurr and KO it with STAB Acrobatics or Hurricane.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This set is designed to function either in or out of Trick Room. Conkeldurr already has a huge base 140 Attack stat. However, with a Guts boost, Conkeldurr becomes a massively powerful physical attacker capable of OHKOing a large number of Pokemon. Detect allows Conkeldurr to shelter itself from threats while its status Orb activates and gives it the Guts boost. Wide Guard can be used in place of Detect, providing valuable protection for teammates weak against common spread attacks. Unfortunately, the specificity of its protection does limit its usefulness, particularly for Conkeldurr itself. Mach Punch gives Conkeldurr priority, and with a Guts boost, can finish off weakened Pokemon or KO extremely frail ones. The choice between Drain Punch and Hammer Arm is a choice between healing and power. There are three options for the last attacking move. Rock Slide gives you the ability to hit both opponents, Payback is very effective against faster Psychic- and Ghost-type enemies that lack a weakness to Rock-type attacks, while Earthquake hits all grounded Pokemon on the field. An Adamant nature lets Conkeldurr outspeed a few threats outside of Trick Room, and is recommended if not running Trick Room, while Brave allows Conkeldurr to be one of the fastest Pokemon in the metagame when using Trick Room.</p> <p>Conkeldurr should always run maximum Attack in order to deal as much damage as possible. An Attack boosting nature is also required, as there is no other stat that is worth investing completely in. A more specially defensive EV spread can also be used, in order to give Conkeldurr even defensive prowess. 152 HP / 252 Atk / 104 SpD effectively gives Conkeldurr as much bulk as possible while minimizing the burn damage from burn due to the Flame Orb. Superpower can replace Drain Punch or Hammer Arm to provide an obscene amount of power the first time it's used, but since it lowers Conkeldurr's Attack and Defense significantly, its usefulness is very limited. Earthquake can be used if Conkeldurr's partner doesn't care about damage from it (generally, when it is immune to or resists Ground-type attacks), and can hit both of the opponent's Pokemon with a strong attack that has perfect accuracy. An important thing to note is that the combination of Drain Punch, Mach Punch, and Wide Guard is illegal with Conkeldurr, and either Drain Punch or Wide Guard must be replaced with Hammer Arm or Detect, respectively.</p> <p>If running Earthquake, Conkeldurr appreciates a partner that is immune to it. Thundurus makes a great partner, as it can also threaten Tornadus, which is a major threat to Conkeldurr. When not using Earthquake, Chandelure makes an excellent partner, killing bulky Psychic-types and physically defensive Pokemon that Conkeldurr has trouble with. Conkeldurr is an excellent choice to use with Trick Room support, being \"faster\" than most of the metagame under Trick Room. Reuniclus thus makes a great partner, providing Trick Room and breaking through most physically defensive Pokemon. It also defeats bulky Psychic-types if it runs Shadow Ball.</p>"

Unfortunately, Throh is often passed over in favor of Conkeldurr as a Fighting-type Trick Room sweeper due to Conkeldurr's much higher Attack and access to Mach Punch. However, Throh's greater bulk makes him a very viable option, and gives him a definite niche alongside Conkeldurr.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Throh can use an Endure + Reversal set, allowing him to hit incredibly hard, but such a set is very weak to priority, and due to the ubiquity of Psychic-types, it's generally a bad idea. Circle Throw allows Throh to stop opposing Trick Room setup, and also remove troublesome Pokemon such as Whimsicott from the field, but its low Base Power and negative priority generally make it a bad choice. Low Sweep allows Throh to cut an opponent's Speed, reducing Throh's reliance on Trick Room to function, but its low Base Power proves underwhelming at best. Payback may seem like a good idea with Throh's low Speed, but most Psychic-types are either slower than Throh or can OHKO him outright, so Facade is usually a far better choice. Inner Focus, Throh's other ability, allows him to avoid flinching, but is inferior to Guts and has very situational usage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Almost any Psychic-type can take all of Throh's attacks and deal severe damage or OHKO with Psychic. Tornadus and Archeops can outspeed Throh and OHKO him with Acrobatics, but if Trick Room is up, Throh can outspeed them and do huge damage with Rock Slide.

Facade gives Throh a powerful attack which outdamages a neutral Storm Throw, hits Psychic-types for excellent damage, and 2HKOes most Amoonguss. Protect allows Throh to bypass his checks for a turn and give his partner a chance to eliminate Pokemon such as Reuniclus which give him trouble. The EVs, IVs, and nature allow Throh to hit as hard as possible, retain suitable bulk, and reach the lowest possible Speed all at the same time.</p> <p>Earthquake gives Throh another spread attack, allowing him to hit Psychic-types for good damage, but provides redundant coverage with Storm Throw, making it inferior to Facade in most situations.

Dark-types such as Krookodile and Hydreigon along with Ghost-types such as Chandelure also happen to pair well with Throh, hitting opposing Psychic-types hard with their STAB attacks.

Terrakion boasts better stats and a Rock-type STAB. Really, Sawk’s only saving grace is his access to Sturdy and Inner Focus, both of great abilities, but not nearly enough to push him to the same level as the other two. However, unlike Mienshao, Sawk has access to one of the best STAB moves in the game, Close Combat, and arguably does better in teams running both Tailwind and Trick Room than the other two. All in all, Sawk can still be very dangerous when played right.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sawk doesn’t have much else to do besides attacking. Sawk is practically built to use Counter then sweep with Reversal, given that he has a built-in Focus Sash. Sawk also learns both Sunny Day and Rain Dance and with Inner Focus can set up without worrying about Fake Out; if you need a Fighting-type on your team he makes a decent choice. Sawk also gets Fling, allowing him to Fling a King's Rock at a Ghost-type setting up Trick Room; thanks to Inner Focus, Sawk won't be stopped by Fake Out. Bulk Up is Sawk's best stat-boosting move, but in this regard he is largely outclassed by Scrafty.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Bulky Psychic-types and Golurk are the best counters, as the best Sawk can do is Payback or Earthquake. Ghost-types deal with Sawk well if he is locked into Close Combat, and if he is locked into any other move he can be dealt with accordingly. Haxorus can get past Sturdy with Mold Breaker but must be wary of faster Sawk—those with a Jolly nature or a Choice Scarf. Anything faster such as Tornadus or Archeops can kill Inner Focus sets. Once Sturdy is used, Conkeldurr or anything with priority can revenge kill him.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Sawk is a pretty straightforward but formidable physical attacker. Close Combat and Rock Slide both give good coverage. Stone Edge is usable over Rock Slide, having more Base Power and hitting through Wide Guard. Thanks to Sawk’s middling Speed, he works great in teams running both Tailwind and Trick Room. When Tailwind is up, he will almost always outspeed the opposing team, but if they set up Tailwind too, set up Trick Room and Sawk will probably have the Speed advantage even when the opposing team's Tailwind runs out. Combined with Sturdy's guarantee of surviving one hit, Sawk can be very menacing. While Sawk is not the fastest user, Taunt is generally a helpful move. Quick Guard and Protect both have their uses, and either one is a good choice depending on your team. Payback hits Psychic- and Ghost-types harder than any other move Sawk has. Although somewhat redundant due to his Fighting-type STAB, Earthquake is a strong spread attack good for damaging both of your opponent's Pokemon.</p> <p>The EV spread assumes you run an Adamant nature and lets Sawk outrun the fastest Pokemon he can, Timid Samurott. If using Jolly, an alternate EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe should be run, allowing Sawk to outspeed Adamant Krookodile and Haxorus, and Speed tie with Modest Hydreigon. Focus Sash can be used when using Inner Focus due to Sawk’s feeble defenses. If Amoonguss is using a Mental Herb, it can negate Taunt the first time it is used, and put Sawk to sleep. For this reason, running Lum Berry is also an option. Fighting Gem is for raw power on the first hit.</p> <p>As mentioned above, Sawk fits well into teams running both Tailwind and Trick Room due to his middling speed. Fast Guard makes him a good partner for something trying to set up without being stopped by Fake Out such as a Trick Room user. It is recommended that you pack something fast that can cover Sawk's weaknesses to Psychic- and Flying-type attacks such as Thunderous or Krookodile. A Wide Guard user is always welcome as with field attacks, your opponent won’t have to double attack Sawk to break Sturdy. Fast Guard or Anger Powder users can also help protect a Sturdy Sawk from a revenge kill.</p>"

Payback is Sawk's best option against bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types, especially those which resist Rock Slide such as Golurk. Reversal is also an option; after Sawk is brought down to between 1 and 13 HP, you can switch out and when you come back in, you have the option to use a Fighting-type move which will outdamage Payback against Psychic-types.</p> <p>Jolly with 44 HP / 252 Atk / 212 Spe and a Choice Scarf is enough to outspeed Accelgor and allows some extra bulk.

Although it's a pure Grass-type in a tier with many common Flying-types, it can do surprisingly well with Sunny Day support, even with its below average defenses. Keeping it alive is the biggest problem, though, as Lilligant can't take many hits. A decent base 90 Speed, high base 110 Special Attack, and access to Chlorophyll are Lilligant's strong points, so you'll find that with the right support, Lilligant can be a deadly foe.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Another possibility for Lilligant's STAB move would be Giga Drain. Although it has less power, the restored HP can really help Lilligant survive longer. Hidden Power Rock can allow 4 Speed EVs to be invested in HP instead. Hidden Power Ice can also be used over Hidden Power Rock; It still hits Flying-type Pokemon hard, and scores super effective damage on Hydreigon, but Lilligant will then be helpless against Chandelure. Teeter Dance also deserves a mention, being able to confuse all Pokemon on the field. A partner with either Protect or Wide Guard is needed if Teeter Dance is going to be used, however, to keep Lilligant's partner from being confused too. With 100% accuracy and a 50% chance of the foe hurting itself in confusion, Teeter Dance could be considered more viable than Sleep Powder. Confusion from Teeter Dance either forces a switch or the opponent has to risk a 50% chance of hurting itself, which can ruin unprepared teams.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>With Lilligant's below average defenses, most Fire- and Flying-type moves can OHKO it. The extremely common genies and Chandelure are definite threats that can easily take out Lilligant before it deals any damage. Amoonguss walls Lilligant, has access to Spore, and even with a Quiver Dance, Lilligant can only 3HKO physically defensive Amoonguss with Hidden Power Rock. Virizion can counter Lilligant lacking Hidden Power Ice, and even after a Quiver Dance, Lilligant can manage only a 2HKO on Virizion. Without Hidden Power Ice, Lilligant is also walled by Hydreigon, but a +1 Hidden Power Ice has a 92.3% chance to OHKO 4/0 Hydreigon.

Leaf Storm and SolarBeam are the strongest STAB choices for Lilligant, and in the sun, SolarBeam does not require a charge turn. SolarBeam is usually preferred as Leaf Storm will lower Lilligant's Special Attack two stages, but if Sunny Day support is unavailable, Leaf Storm becomes the primary option. Hidden Power Rock hits the Flying-type Pokemon that resist Lilligant's STAB attacks, and also nails Chandelure for super effective damage. Sleep Powder allows Lilligant to support its team by putting opponents to sleep, and, in the sun, Lilligant can outspeed nearly every Pokemon and put it to sleep before it can attack.</p> <p>The choice between Protect or Quiver Dance is one between security and power. Protect is usually preferred to allow Lilligant to shield itself from blows that could KO it while its teammates take out the threat; many of the common Pokemon in VGC 2011 can OHKO Lilligant. Additionally, with Lilligant's weaknesses, it will have few opportunities to set up a Quiver Dance. However, Quiver Dance allows Lilligant to set up after Sleep Powder. After a Quiver Dance, Lilligant can OHKO Pokemon that normally counter it, such as Tornadus, Thundurus, and Chandelure, with Hidden Power Rock.</p> <p>A Modest nature is preferred when the sun is up, because with Chlorophyll activated, Lilligant is already outspeeding most Pokemon. Life Orb adds to the damage Lilligant can deal, and thus is the item of choice here. However, if you don't like the idea of Lilligant being OHKOed before it can attack, Focus Sash is a viable item in place of Life Orb. With the sun up and 252 Speed EVs, the only Pokemon that can outspeed Lilligant are fellow Chlorophyll abusers Sawsbuck and Leavanny, which allows Lilligant to run a Modest nature with close to no drawbacks.</p> <p>Fire-types or Wide Guard users are the best partners for Lilligant. Chandelure is common, so Heat Wave is definitely a threat. With a partner using Wide Guard and good prediction, Lilligant can avoid being OHKOed by Heat Wave, and hit back hard with a super effective Hidden Power Rock. A Fire-type partner discourages Chandelure and Volcarona from using Heat Wave. Whimsicott is the fastest user of Sunny Day in VGC 2011, so it is definitely a good teammate for Lilligant. If Teeter Dance is being used, a partner with the Prankster ability can use Substitute to prevent becoming confused.</p>"

However, its defenses are poor, and after factoring in the recoil from Flare Blitz, it often finds itself dying far too quickly. Overall, though, with the right support, Darmanitan can be an absolute wrecking ball, smashing holes in many teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Belly Drum may seem enticing, allowing Darmanitan to completely wreck anything in its path, but the 50% HP lost, along with Darmanitan's frailty, means that it will almost definitely die while using it. Roar allows Darmanitan to stop Trick Room from being set up, but with Darmanitan's frailty and Roar's negative priority, it will almost definitely die if the Trick Room user decides to attack instead, and is generally a poor option when Darmanitan has so much attacking power at its disposal. Focus Sash is an alternative option for Darmanitan due to its frailty, allowing it to always survive a hit and retaliate. However, Fire Punch must be used over Flare Blitz if Focus Sash is being used, because the recoil damage will kill Darmanitan. Taunt is an option to stop Trick Room from being set up, but Darmanitan hits so hard with Flare Blitz that it's almost always an inferior choice to outright attacking, especially with the ubiquity of Mental Herb. Flame Charge does not provide the Speed boost due to Sheer Force, and as such is useless on Darmanitan. Darmanitan's Dream World ability Zen Mode is completely useless and should not be used.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>In the limited sense of the word, Darmanitan cannot be said to have any counters, because its Life Orb-boosted Flare Blitz 2HKOs everything in the metagame. However, almost any Pokemon that outspeeds Darmanitan can do severe damage to or even KO it due to its frailty and the recoil from Flare Blitz. Landorus, Tornadus, Archeops, Durant, and Terrakion can outspeed Darmanitan and OHKO or do severe damage to it before it moves. If Tailwind is up or Darmanitan has a Choice Scarf, however, Darmanitan will be able to outspeed these Pokemon and KO them with the appropriate move. Most Dragon- and Water-types can cause problems for Darmanitan, as they resist Flare Blitz and are not hit for super effective damage by its other moves, but even so, the incredible power of Darmanitan's Flare Blitz allows it to take them out if they cannot OHKO it in return.</p>",

With Darmanitan's relatively high Speed stat, it even outspeeds most opposing Choice Scarf users such as Chandelure and Vanilluxe. A Sheer Force-boosted Flare Blitz is outrageously powerful, OHKOing every offensive Pokemon that doesn't resist the move, and doing severe damage to almost everything else. Earthquake complements Flare Blitz by hitting the Rock- and Water-types that resist it for good damage, and allows Darmanitan to provide some powerful spread coverage in conjunction with Rock Slide, hitting everything in the metagame for at least neutral damage. Superpower allows Darmanitan to take out Pokemon such as Terrakion and Hydreigon which resist Flare Blitz, OHKOing any set not holding a Chople Berry or Focus Sash. The EVs and nature allow Darmanitan to hit as hard as possible, and to outspeed almost everything on the field.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is also an option, allowing Darmanitan to outspeed Adamant Scarf Haxorus and Adamant Scarf Terrakion, but is generally not necessary. An alternative EV spread of 220 HP / 252 Atk / 36 Spe is a viable option, as it increases Darmanitan's bulk and reduces the amount of recoil it takes from Flare Blitz, while still allowing it to outspeed the genies. However, in that case, Darmanitan won't be able to outspeed the entire metagame or check Tailwind teams as easily. A spread of 76 Def / 252 Atk / 180 Spe is also an option, allowing Darmanitan to always survive an Adamant Choice Scarf Terrakion's Rock Slide and OHKO back with Superpower. Choice Scarf Darmanitan's incredible power and excellent Speed with the boost from Choice Scarf makes it a good partner to anything struggling with the genies, and especially helps Focus Sash users with its ability to quickly remove an opponent from the match. It also easily takes out Amoonguss that lack Focus Sash or Occa Berry, making it helpful against many Trick Room teams. Its ability to remove many common users of Earthquake or Rock Slide makes it much easier for Flying- and Fire-types to function, so Chandelure and Tornadus can also benefit from Choice Scarf Darmanitan as a partner. Choice Scarf Darmanitan can check opposing Tailwind teams because of its high speed, OHKOing almost everything they commonly carry.</p>"

Sheer Force negates Life Orb recoil on moves it boosts, so Darmanitan only really has to worry about the recoil from using Flare Blitz. A Life Orb-boosted Flare Blitz is stupidly powerful; it always OHKOes 252 HP Musharna, and does severe damage to almost everything else, making Darmanitan an extremely potent offensive force. Earthquake hits the Rock- and Water-types that resist Flare Blitz for good damage, and provides powerful spread support with good coverage in conjunction with Rock Slide. Protect allows Darmanitan to avoid taking damage from its many weaknesses, and give its partner a turn to take out Pokemon that might threaten it. The EVs and nature allow Darmanitan to hit as hard as possible, and to retain its spot on the Speed tier, outspeeding Pokemon such as Krookodile and Chandelure.</p> <p>Fire Punch is a second STAB option, allowing Darmanitan to still OHKO many offensive Pokemon while avoiding the recoil from Flare Blitz. However, there is a noticeable difference in power. A Jolly nature does dampen Darmanitan's attacking power, but allows it to outspeed Adamant Haxorus, Modest Hydreigon, and Adamant Landorus, all of which it can OHKO or do severe damage to with a Life Orb-boosted Flare Blitz. Life Orb Darmanitan can OHKO almost anything remotely offensive, and as such makes a great member of a Tailwind team, with its ability to constantly keep up the offensive pressure on the opposing team. Its ability to OHKO or do severe damage to Trick Room users means that it makes an excellent partner for Tornadus, which has no way of stopping Trick Room from being set up outside of the unreliable Taunt. A partner to set up Tailwind can help Darmanitan outspeed and KO many of the Pokemon that trouble it, so Whimsicott, Tornadus, and Braviary make good partners, although the latter two are also weak to Rock Slide. A Fake Out user can also be useful, allowing Darmanitan to eliminate Pokemon that trouble it without being KOed. Darmanitan has some trouble with Dragon- and Water-types, as they resist Flare Blitz, so a Thundurus with Hidden Power Ice can make a very useful partner, hitting both for super effective damage.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Scrafty is one of the select few Pokemon in VGC 2011 with access to Fake Out. This gives it a niche as the slowest Fake Out user, making it a useful Pokemon for Trick Room teams. An array of attacking options that are complemented by fantastic unresisted dual STAB make Scrafty a considerable threat with great coverage. Its middling Speed stat allows it to function well both within and outside of Trick Room conditions.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Zen Headbutt is a viable option as it 2HKOes 252/0 Amoonguss 85.14% of the time, and 2HKOes 252/0 Guts Conkeldurr, factoring in burn damage. Scrafty can run a Bulk Up set to take advantage of its good defenses and Drain Punch, however, it is outclassed by Conkeldurr in this aspect, as the latter has the same defenses, a stronger Drain Punch in order to recover more HP, and is generally more threatening than Scrafty.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Conkeldurr is an absolute nightmare for Scrafty as it can use Protect to activate its status Orb, then destroy Scrafty with a Fighting-type attack. Conkeldurr also outspeeds Scrafty in Trick Room and has priority Mach Punch to use outside of Trick Room, making it an absolute terror no matter which way you twist the dimensions. Fighting-types with Inner Focus are a huge problem to Scrafty. The most common of these, Mienshao, also has a faster Fake Out than Scrafty, and will therefore pose a huge headache to it. Sawk and Throh also possess the Inner Focus ability and can threaten Scrafty with their STAB Fighting-type attacks. Archeops, Braviary, and Tornadus can OHKO Scrafty with Acrobatics and will easily outspeed it if Trick Room is not up. Volcarona and Galvantula are on the same boat but with Bug Buzz instead.</p>",

      "Fake Out": {
        "description": "<p>Scrafty is one of only three Fake Out users available in VGC 2011, and as the slowest user of the move, it is most suited for a role in Trick Room teams. Fake Out will incapacitate an opponent for the first turn of the match, making it easier for your partner to twist the dimensions. Drain Punch is the first of Scrafty's offensive options that provides unresisted coverage alongside its coverage moves. Drain Punch also allows Scrafty to recover health and survive longer with its good bulk. Crunch is the second move in its offensive arsenal and an all-round safe option that complements Drain Punch and works off of Scrafty's secondary STAB. The final moveslot will depend on the rest of your team's need. Detect is always useful in Doubles; Ice Punch provides Scrafty with even better coverage, and gives it a reliable way to hit all three genies and other threats, such as Druddigon and Amoonguss, super effectively; Rock Slide can be useful in Trick Room if you enjoy abusing its 30% flinch rate and will still hit two of the genies super effectively, and also leave a huge dent in Volcarona.</p> <p>The choice of item is dependent on your playstyle. Chople Berry will give Scrafty some protection against Conkeldurr's Mach Punch, whereas Life Orb will provide you with some handy KOs on Pokemon, such as Chandelure and Jellicent, who can be EVed to survive Scrafty's Crunch without Life Orb. While Shed Skin can be a useful ability to save Scrafty from status, Moxie is generally the superior option as Scrafty has an uncanny ability to stick around for many turns, and therefore is happy to make use of the Attack boosts it is capable of getting with its great coverage.</p> <p>Within Trick Room, Scrafty can make use of Fling + Iron Ball. Iron Ball reduces Scrafty's Speed to 28 with 0 Speed IV, which will outspeed popular Trick Room Pokemon, such as Conkeldurr, Amoonguss, and Musharna, when Trick Room is in effect. It's also worth noting that Fling will OHKO 252/0 Jellicent. You may want to consider running Zen Headbutt in the third slot to hit Conkeldurr and Amoonguss super effectively. It also comes with a useful 20% flinch chance.</p> <p>Scrafty also functions well outside of Trick Room, although you may want to invest in some Speed EVs in order to outpace some common threats outside of Trick Room. With an Adamant nature and 20 Speed EVs, Scrafty can outspeed neutral natured Jellicent with no investment in Speed EV. 60 EVs will allow Scrafty to outspeed neutral-natured Chandelure with no Speed EV investment. If you would like to use Scrafty on a Tailwind team, 116 Speed EVs allows Scrafty to outspeed all non-boosted Pokemon but Accelgor when Tailwind is in effect. Focus Sash can be used to save Scrafty from powerful Acrobatics and Bug Buzzes from the likes of Tornadus and Volcarona, respectively.</p> <p>Scrafty fears Fighting types, especially Conkeldurr who manages to outspeed Scrafty even in Trick Room. Having a Fighting-type resist to switch in or a Pokemon that can KO Conkeldurr is helpful, such as Musharna, who can deal a heavy hit with STAB Psychic as well as set up Trick Room. Scrafty also fears Flying-type attacks from Pokemon such as Tornadus and Archeops. A Pokemon that can take care of these, such as Eelektross is a great teammate. Scrafty's role is usually to support a set-up Pokemon, and then hammer away once it has achieved that role. Trick Room users, in general, are happy to receive this support.</p>"

  "Sigilyph": {
    "overview": "<p>While this flying totem pole might not initially strike fear into your heart, Sigilyph's reasonable bulk and good Speed stat, along with access to Tailwind and Magic Guard, make it an excellent Tailwind attacker. Its powerful Psychic-type STAB gives it super effective coverage against the abundant Fighting-types, while its typing allows it to take any Fighting-type attack with ease. That typing also hurts it, though, since it gives Sigilyph weaknesses to many common attacks such as Rock Slide and Shadow Ball, and while Sigilyph's good bulk allows it to take a hit, its somewhat low Speed makes it susceptible to many faster attackers such as Archeops and Terrakion. Overall, Sigilyph is a great Tailwind user and abuser, and makes a useful addition to almost any team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sigilyph's good defenses, excellent Psychic typing, and Magic Guard makes it an ideal initiator of a Skill Swap chain. If it is able to transfer, for example, Thundurus's Prankster to Amoonguss, your opponents are in for a world of hurt. Magic Guard is also an excellent ability to Skill Swap to another Pokemon, making Sigilyph ideal for the role. However, the strategy is ruined if any Pokemon in the chain is KOed, and as such is not very reliable. Sigilyph has access to Reflect and Light Screen, and with its relatively high Speed and good defenses, it can make for a useful dual screen user. However, Sigilyph's ability to burn opponents with Psycho Shift makes Reflect generally useless, and Sigilyph is much more effective setting up Tailwind than setting up dual screens. Thunder Wave may seem useful for lowering an opponent's Speed, but Tailwind does that far more effectively, making Thunder Wave useless. Sigilyph has access to Trick Room, but with its relatively high Speed stat for a Trick Room team, it's easily outclassed by slower Trick Room users such as Musharna or Reuniclus.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Thundurus can do severe damage to Sigilyph with its STAB Thunderbolt, but a specially defensive EV spread allows Sigilyph to take a Thunderbolt and set up Tailwind. Many Rock Slide users can do significant damage to Sigilyph, but must watch out for the odd Psycho Shift, which will neuter their offensive capabilities, and Roost, which allows Sigilyph to take a slower Rock Slide with ease while recovering health. Taunt users such as Thundurus, Tornadus, and Whimsicott can stop Sigilyph from using Tailwind, but must watch out for Mental Herb.</p> <p>Dark-types such as Scrafty and Krookodile can deal severe damage with their STAB Crunch, but must watch out for Psycho Shift, which neuters their offensive capabilities by inflicting burn. A special attacking Hydreigon doesn't care about a burn, and can deal significant damage with its STAB Dark Pulse, but it must watch out for a Life Orb-boosted Ice Beam, which will do severe damage. Ice-types such as Vanilluxe can do huge damage with their super effective STAB attacks, but Sigilyph's good defenses allow it to take most Ice Beams and set up Tailwind with a defensive set, and Roost will allow it to remove its weakness while recovering health.</p>",

      "Tailwind Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Sigilyph's access to both Tailwind and Magic Guard, along with a usable Special Attack stat, make it an effective Tailwind attacker. Psychic is its STAB move of choice, attaining key OHKOs on every Fighting-type Pokemon and hitting Amoonguss for huge damage. Ice Beam adds to Sigilyph's coverage, OHKOing the genies and most of the many Pokemon weak to Ice-type attacks. Tailwind allows Sigilyph to support its team and boost its own Speed. Shadow Ball deals decent damage to most Ghost- and Psychic-types, making Sigilyph much more effective against opposing Trick Room teams.</p> <p>Air Slash hits various Pokemon for more damage than Ice Beam, including Virizion, Zoroark, Scrafty, and Whimsicott, and provides better neutral coverage than Ice Beam. However, Ice Beam still hits the genies, Haxorus, Hydreigon, and Krookodile harder, and due to their high usage, it's usually the better option. As Sigilyph has various weaknesses, Protect can be useful, allowing a teammate to take out a Pokemon such as Thundurus that may threaten Sigilyph. However, it does make Sigilyph far less effective against opposing Trick Room teams, meaning it is an inferior option.</p> <p>Magic Guard removes Life Orb recoil, allowing Sigilyph to hit hard without compromising its good bulk. The EVs and nature allow Sigilyph to always OHKO 4 HP genies with Ice Beam while maintaining great physical durability; it can even take an Archeops's Flying Gem Acrobatics and have a 67.3% chance to survive. An alternative EV spread of 28 HP / 252 SpA / 228 Spe is a viable option, allowing Sigilyph to outspeed Timid Chandelure and Adamant Krookodile outside of Tailwind, but the reduced bulk in comparison to the first spread is quite noticeable, and makes Sigilyph far more susceptible to Rock Slide than a bulkier spread.</p> <p>Most Pokemon that enjoy a Tailwind boost will appreciate Sigilyph as a partner. Additionally, its ability to OHKO Terrakion and other Fighting-types with its STAB Psychic makes it a good partner for Pokemon such as your own Terrakion or Scrafty, which can then proceed to attack with their common checks removed. Sigilyph's ability to OHKO Tornadus with Ice Beam and set up Tailwind is especially useful for Pokemon such as Conkeldurr or Amoonguss which Tornadus commonly checks.</p> <p>This set requires a good deal of support to work well. Although it has excellent physical bulk, allowing it to tank many hits, Sigilyph is often KOed by super effective special attacks such as Thundurus's Thunderbolt and Chandelure's Shadow Ball. For this reason, a Fake Out user such as Scrafty or Mienshao can help tremendously, immobilizing these checks while Sigilyph sets up Tailwind, allowing it to do good damage the next turn. A powerful Choice Scarf user such as Chandelure or Darmanitan can also be helpful, OHKOing Pokemon that threaten Sigilyph, such as Thundurus, before they can attack.</p>"

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Nasty Plot could be utilized on a more offensive set with Grass Knot and Psychic, but Cofagrigus is more of a support Pokemon than an attacker, and its base 95 Special Attack and shallow movepool makes this option very underwhelming. Rest and Toxic could be used in combination with a Chesto Berry to bring some stall capabilities, but in the fast-paced metagame that is VGC 2011, this is not recommended. Imprison is a viable option, which paired alongside with Trick Room and Shadow Ball, could shut down opposing Chandelure and Jellicent. Disable could be useful to stop Cofagrigus from being 2HKOed, but in the fast-paced metagame that VGC is, it is usually a waste of a moveslot.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Without Hidden Power Fighting, Bisharp and Scrafty completely wall Cofagrigus. The only thing they have to watch out for is Cofagrigus's ability, Mummy, which will eliminate their precious abilities. Hydreigon has no need worry about Mummy, as it utilizes non-contact moves, and Cofagrigus cannot touch Hydreigon either. A bulky Jellicent can take a Shadow Ball or two, and hit back hard with a Shadow Ball that likely has 252 Special Attack EVs behind it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to set up Trick Room, and is very effective at this role. With Cofagrigus's low Speed, Trick Room is perfect for it. Shadow Ball provides Cofagrigus with a solid STAB move, in addition to hitting common Pokemon such as Jellicent and Chandelure for super effective damage. Will-O-Wisp neuters threats such as Scrafty and Bisharp, who threaten Cofagrigus with Dark-type moves. The last move is mainly filler, with Protect being used to allow your partner to KO a threat, or stall out an opposing team's Tailwind. Calm Mind boosts Cofagrigus's Special Defense and Special Attack to increasingly high levels, which, when coupled with its high Defense, will make it hard to KO. Hidden Power Fighting mitigates Cofagrigus's vulnerability to Dark-type enemies, including Scrafty, Hydreigon, and the 4x weak Bisharp.</p> <p>Mental Herb allows Cofagrigus to set up Trick Room with impunity, since most Pokemon cannot OHKO it, even when double targeted by both enemies. If you have Fake Out support, however, a Sitrus Berry would be best to increase Cofagrigus's longevity. Sassy and max Special Defense EVs are used to reinforce Cofagrigus's weaker Special Defense, leaving physical defense to be covered by Cofagrigus's impressive base 145 Defense. However, if using Calm Mind, some EVs should be diverted from Special Defense to Defense, as Calm Mind can be relied on to enhance Cofagrigus's Special Defense. Kasib and Colbur Berry are options to prevent Cofagrigus from getting OHKOed by Ghost- or Dark-type attacks.</p> <p>Anything that can ease Cofagrigus's job of setting up Trick Room is greatly appreciated. Good examples of such support include Scrafty's Fake Out and Amoonguss's Rage Powder. One of the few things that could (potentially) KO Cofagrigus is a Heat Wave / Water Spout combo from Chandelure and Jellicent, respectively. In addition to its role of providing Fake Out support, Scrafty can beat the aforementioned attack combo by OHKOing Chandelure or severely weakening Jellicent and its Water Spout with Crunch.</p>"

Its ability Sturdy is also incredibly useful, giving it the equivalent of a free Focus Sash, which is extremely helpful. However, its weakness to Fighting-type attacks, low Special Defense, and poor Speed means it has to rely upon Trick Room or Shell Smash to function well. Overall, its excellent dual STAB makes it a strong choice for almost any team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Aqua Tail can be used over Waterfall on any set, but its lower accuracy, loss of the flinch chance, and inability to gain any important KOs makes it an inferior option. Earthquake might seem useful, but it has no coverage not already provided by Waterfall and Rock Slide. Curse allows Carracosta to outspeed everything under Trick Room and also hit hard, while boosting its Defense, but the boost is generally too slow to be useful, and Carracosta is generally far better off just attacking. Rain Dance might seem useful to boost the power of Carracosta's Water-type attacks, but its many weaknesses and terrible Special Defense make Carracosta far more effective just attacking than setting up rain. Tornadus or Thundurus generally accomplish this much more effectively thanks to their ability Prankster giving them priority on the move. Stone Edge is an option over Rock Slide, allowing Carracosta to hit much harder and guarantee an OHKO on the genies, but its shaky accuracy and lack of spread damage makes Rock Slide the better choice in almost all situations.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Ferrothorn is the greatest counter to Carracosta, easily taking any attack and OHKOing in return with its STAB Power Whip. By extension, any Grass-type Pokemon poses a threat to Carracosta, as it is unable to OHKO any of them with an unboosted Rock Slide, while it easily dies to any Grass-type attack. However, Sturdy allows Carracosta to always survive an attack, and if it gets up a Shell Smash, it can do serious damage with its powerful Rock Slide. Whimsicott deserves special mention for completely destroying any Shell Smash sets by locking them into Shell Smash with its priority Encore. Thundurus and Landorus can easily eliminate it with Discharge and Earthquake in concert, but if Carracosta has Wide Guard, it can stop them and allow its partner to set up Trick Room, where it can do huge damage with its powerful dual STAB attacks. Priority users such as Bisharp, Terrakion, Archeops, and Basculin can eliminate Carracosta if it's down to 1 HP due to Sturdy, but must be wary of a Water Gem-boosted Aqua Jet, which will do major damage to or KO many of them.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<p>Carracosta makes a unique attacker in VGC play thanks to its exclusive access to Shell Smash and Sturdy, which gives it almost guaranteed setup and makes it an incredibly powerful attacker. Shell Smash forms the basis of this set, doubling Carracosta's Speed and boosting its Attack to incredible levels. Waterfall and Rock Slide are powerful STAB attacks which gain excellent coverage together, doing huge damage after a boost. Protect allows Carracosta to bypass its many weaknesses, and lets its partner take out a Pokemon which can threaten it, as well as keep its Sturdy intact in the face of an opposing Fake Out. The EVs and nature allow Carracosta to outspeed everything up to maximum Speed Whimsicott after a Shell Smash, and hit as hard as possible after a boost. Rock Gem makes Carracosta's boosted Rock Slide hit ridiculously hard after a boost, doing huge damage to anything that doesn't resist it.</p> <p>Aqua Jet with the boost from Water Gem OHKOes both Terrakion and Archeops after a Shell Smash, stopping them from using Quick Attack to finish off Carracosta before it can attack. However, it leaves Carracosta open to being double targeted before it can use Shell Smash, as well as being hit by first-turn Fake Outs. Because Shell Smash boosts both Attack and Special Attack, a special or mixed set is also feasible, although Carracosta's Special Attack is significantly lower than its Attack. If such a set is used, Carracosta should use a Naive nature and move some EVs to Special Attack, or use a Timid nature with 252 Special Attack EVs if it's using all special attacks. Some of the special attacks Carracosta can use on such a set are Surf, Ice Beam, Hydro Pump, Scald, Blizzard, Focus Blast, and Hidden Power. An additional perk of a special set is its ability to use Ice Beam, which means it's not as helpless against Amoonguss as a purely physical attacker.</p> <p>Although somewhat unreliable, a strategy using a Simple Beam partner such as Audino or Beheeyem can make Carracosta nearly unstoppable. If it gets Simple and then uses Shell Smash, it will be at +4 Attack, Special Attack, and Speed, making it an incredibly powerful offensive force. However, Carracosta will also have -2 in both defenses, making it easy to KO if Sturdy has already activated. It cannot be stressed enough how useful Fake Out support is for Carracosta. While Sturdy allows Carracosta to take a single hit, it can easily be double targeted or even Taunted to stop it from setting up Shell Smash and hitting the opposing team. For this reason, Mienshao and Scrafty make excellent partners for Carracosta, allowing it to set up Shell Smash with ease thanks to Sturdy and proceed to outspeed and KO the opposing team. Fake Out also stops opposing Tailwind users such as Tornadus from setting up Tailwind the first turn, as a combination of Fake Out and Rock Slide KOes Tornadus, allowing Carracosta to use Shell Smash without fear of being outsped.</p> <p>Carracosta has weaknesses to Grass-, Fighting-, Electric-, and Ground-type attacks, and although Sturdy helps to mitigate this somewhat, it is unable to prevent Carracosta from being double targeted. For this reason, a partner which can take hits for Carracosta or remove some of its checks can prove incredibly useful. Amoonguss stands out as the most durable, able to easily take almost any hit and use Spore while Carracosta uses Protect, allowing it to use Shell Smash without fear of being double targeted. However, enemy Amoonguss also pose a huge problem to Carracosta, easily taking any hit and using Spore in return, or OHKOing with Giga Drain. For this reason, a partner such as Archeops or Tornadus can prove useful, OHKOing Amoonguss with Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics, although a Coba Berry on Amoonguss will stop that. Choice Scarf Chandelure also makes an excellent partner, OHKOing many Pokemon that may threaten Carracosta with Overheat, and also OHKOing Amoonguss that do not hold an Occa Berry. Since Trick Room teams completely shut Carracosta down, negating its Speed boosts and hitting it hard before it can attack, Chandelure with Imprison can make an excellent partner, making it very difficult for the opponent to set up Trick Room, while Carracosta hits them hard with its boosted attacks.</p>"

        "description": "<p>While a Shell Smash set attempts to remedy Carracosta's poor Speed by boosting it, this set uses it to its advantage, outspeeding many threats with Trick Room in effect. Waterfall and Rock Slide again form Carracosta's powerful dual STAB attack combination, attaining excellent coverage and doing good damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Aqua Jet gives Carracosta a priority attack which outspeeds every other priority user under Trick Room, and allows it to work well outside of Trick Room, doing good damage to Terrakion and Landorus, and activating Archeops's Defeatist ability, making it much less of a threat. Wide Guard allows Carracosta to support a partner using Trick Room, stopping the powerful spread attacks that plague Trick Room teams.</p> <p>Protect is an option over Wide Guard, allowing Carracosta to stop itself from being KOed while its partner sets up Trick Room, but Carracosta's ability Sturdy, along with Wide Guard's general utility, makes Wide Guard generally the better option. A Water Gem boosts the power of Waterfall and Aqua Jet, allowing Carracosta to take out many weakened Pokemon, or just hit once very hard. While Carracosta's Attack is much higher than its Special Attack, a special attacking set is also feasible due to its large special movepool. Carracosta can use Surf in concert with Jellicent to form a pseudo-SazaJelly combination, but it can also use Ice Beam, or a more powerful STAB option in Hydro Pump.</p> <p>Since this set will ideally be used in Trick Room conditions, it doesn't have the same reliance on Sturdy as a Shell Smash set, since there is no need to set up. However, Carracosta's terrible Special Defense and multitude of weaknesses makes support absolutely necessary in order to succeed. Amoonguss makes an excellent partner, benefiting from Trick Room and also using Spore to incapacitate a threat to Carracosta. However, opposing Amoonguss also prove to be a thorn in Carracosta's side, outspeeding it in Trick Room and using Spore, or just OHKOing with Giga Drain. For this reason, Chandelure is a good partner, with the ability to set up Trick Room for Carracosta and also OHKO Amoonguss with Overheat or a Fire Gem-boosted Heat Wave. Reuniclus also makes a great partner, setting up Trick Room and forming a potent offensive combination with Carracosta, while also OHKOing most Amoonguss with a Life Orb-boosted Psychic. Although unorthodox, a Vanilluxe with Ice Gem can also prove to be a great partner in Trick Room, OHKOing most Amoonguss with an Ice Gem-boosted Ice Beam and also attaining excellent super effective coverage with its STAB Ice Beam. Beartic can work similarly.</p>"

Taunt is an option to shut down bulky Pokemon like Musharna, but Prankster Pokemon are far better at this.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Anything that can avoid being OHKOed by Archeops and can hit back with a super effective move is as good as a counter can get. Bulky Trick Room users such as Jellicent can set up Trick Room and hit back the next turn. Choice Scarf users with a super effective move, such as Vanilluxe, can outspeed and KO Archeops.

After Flight Jewel has been used up, Acrobatics's Base Power doubles. This ancient bird boasts the second strongest unboosted Rock Slide in the tier, Gigalith just edging it out with an Attack-boosting nature. Earthquake gets much better coverage than Quick Attack does, and provides a secondary spread attack. On the other hand, Quick Attack finishes off Focus Sash users and lets Archeops get off an extra attack against faster foes before going down. Fast Guard protects both of your Pokemon from Fake Out and Mach Punch, and is a decent option when leading with Archeops. However, Protect gives Archeops a guaranteed turn of survival, and is generally the preferred choice.</p> <p>An Adamant nature could be used, but it gains no additional KOs of great significance.

Audino can use Simple Beam on Archeops, nullifying Defeatist. Offensive teammates should be tailored to finish off whatever Archeops cannot. Conkeldurr is a solid choice here, resisting Rock Slide and having priority in the form of Mach Punch. Conkeldurr is also free to use Earthquake thanks to Archeops's Flying typing.</p>"

However, Zoroark still has the potential to be a devastating factor in any VGC match, and should not be overlooked when considering a possible teammate.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Grass Knot hits Water-types such as Samurott and Seismitoad hard, but Hidden Power Ice has better overall coverage. Extrasensory could be used for Fighting-types, but Hidden Power Ice hits more Pokemon and Extrasensory won't OHKO most Fighting-types anyway. Night Slash could be used on the Counter set if you don't like Sucker Punch, but the priority from the latter is usually too good to pass up. Taunt is always useful in VGC, but it's often better utilized by a Pokemon with Prankster, such as Tornadus or Thundurus. Furthermore, the Pokemon you would be using Taunt against are Trick Room users, which are weak to Dark, so you are usually better off just attacking. Aerial Ace is also an option on the Counter set, dealing with Fighting-types to an extent. Focus Blast can hit Dark-types such as Hydreigon hard, but the 70% accuracy is very unattractive. A Choice Scarf set could be utilized to come in late-game and clean up the remaining Pokemon, but with Zoroark's paper defenses, this doesn't always work.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Ironically, the main check to Zoroark is not a Pokemon itself. Team Preview allows Zoroark's opponent to plan for it, possibly leading to Zoroark being OHKOed. Otherwise, Fighting-types can hit it very hard, and outside of Extrasensory, Aerial Ace, or Counter, Zoroark can't damage Fighting-types. Bug-types such as Escavalier also give Zoroark trouble.</p>",

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set is able to heavily damage almost all Trick Room users, and even some of its sweepers. Dark Pulse hits most common Trick Room users for super effective damage. Night Daze has more power than Dark Pulse, but lower accuracy. Night Daze also has the downside of immediately giving away Zoroark's disguise, making Dark Pulse the better choice in most situations. Flamethrower deals heavy damage to Amoonguss and Whimsicott. Hidden Power Ice OHKOes Landorus lacking Yache Berry and 2HKOes Hydreigon, who resists the rest of Zoroark's moves. Protect is always useful in VGC, allowing your partner to set up Tailwind or to stall out an opponent's Trick Room. Sucker Punch is useful for attacking while Trick Room is up and picking off weakened Pokemon, but Protect is generally the superior option for longevity.</p> <p>If you are running Sucker Punch, Naive is the best nature so as not to drop Zoroark's Attack. However, if running Protect, Timid is optimal to avoid dropping Zoroark's already low defenses. Focus Sash lets Zoroark live an extra turn, because with its frail defenses, it won't last long. Still, one cannot deny the value of Life Orb's significant power boost. Zoroark is a fast and frail attacker, so it needs all the Speed and power it can get. Dark Gem gives Zoroark a one-time, very strong Dark Pulse, possibly allowing it to OHKO some of the less bulky Trick Room setters such as Chandelure, Reuniclus, and Jellicent.</p> <p>Musharna partners well with Zoroark to give it a Helping Hand boost, and, given the right Illusion, can make the opponent think you are running a Trick Room team. Tailwind greatly supports Zoroark, making Tornadus and Whimsicott good allies. Tornadus has the added benefit of taking out Fighting-types that threaten Zoroark with Acrobatics.</p> <p>This set is best when Zoroark disguises itself as Chandelure or Jellicent, so you won't be getting hit with Fake Out or Fighting-type moves. Masquerading as Conkeldurr is viable to make opposing Reuniclus try and hit you with Psychic. One must remember that thanks to Team Preview, Zoroark will not always be a surprise. However, this can be used to one's advantage. Having Zoroark at the front of the party and a Pokemon such as Chandelure in the back may discourage the opponent from using a Pokemon that could beat Chandelure. Instead, they may bring their Fighting-type, allowing you to lead with Chandelure and take out the threat to Zoroark.</p>"
      },
      "Counter": {
        "description": "<p>While its effectiveness has been reduced by Team Preview, this set is still viable. When Zoroark is hit by a physical attack, it survives using the Focus Sash and doles out twice the damage with Counter! If you think you're getting hit with a special attack, then Sucker Punch can take out the threat. Low Sweep can lower the foe's Speed, while also allowing Zoroark to support its team. Flamethrower can be used if you have problems with Amoonguss. Protect helps stall and allow time for threats to be taken out.</p> <p>Focus Sash is needed so Zoroark can survive strong physical attacks, and Hasty lowers Defense to maximize the damage from Counter. Furthermore, the 0 Defense IV also increases the amount of damage Zoroark takes, and thus, the amount of damage Counter deals. The EV spread maximizes Attack and Speed, with the rest dumped into HP. This set works best when disguised as Terrakion or Scrafty, or any Pokemon weak to Fighting or Bug, as most Fighting-type moves tend to come from the physical side. Disguising it as Amoonguss is an alternative to attract Acrobatics, as well as Heat Waves from Pokemon such as Chandelure.</p>"

  "Reuniclus": {
    "overview": "<p>Reuniclus's excellent bulk, low Speed, Magic Guard ability, and Psychic typing let it serve as a very effective Trick Room set-up Pokemon. Its excellent Special Attack, in conjunction with recoil free use of Life Orb, allow it to deal major damage to many common VGC 2011 Pokemon while retaining decent bulk. Reuniclus has a special niche in the metagame in that it can not only reliably set up Trick Room, but also abuse it well with its high Special Attack, enabling it to be a reliable pivot with very few weaknesses.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Reuniclus has access to Snatch, which can allow it to steal Imprison from Chandelure, Tailwind from Whimsicott, and so on, but it's generally not very reliable. If Reuniclus is attacked during the turn it attempts to Snatch a move when it would normally use Trick Room, it's probably going to be defeated without successfully setting up Trick Room. Reuniclus has access to both Reflect and Light Screen, but with its low Speed, it will be far less effective at setting them up compared to the likes of Sigilyph, and Reuniclus will do far more good attacking than setting up dual screens. With Magic Guard nullifying damage from sandstorm and hail, Reuniclus can run a set utilizing Trick Room, Focus Sash, and Endeavor at a low level, using a FEAR strategy. However, this strategy is ruined should Reuniclus suffer multiple hits (notably from multi-target attacks), and its pre-evolution Duosion typically performs this role better, due to its lower HP. Recover is an option to recover health while a teammate attacks, and also to avoid Sucker Punch, but Reuniclus really doesn't have the defenses to successfully utilize it in VGC.</p> <p>Reuniclus can effectively use Trick and Flame Orb in conjunction with Magic Guard to attain an immunity to status, as well as the ability to burn the opponent. Reuniclus does learn Imprison as well, and while vastly overshadowed by Chandelure due to Reuniclus's much lower Speed, it can still be useful. With Psychic and Shadow Ball on a moveset with Imprison, Reuniclus can completely shut down a plethora of Pokemon that commonly set up Trick Room.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Pokemon with Sucker Punch, such as Bisharp, Zoroark, and Druddigon can threaten Reuniclus immensely with the ability to remove it from the match before it even attacks, although at full health, Reuniclus can take most Sucker Punches without being KOed. A Fighting-type Pokemon is recommended to combat this; under Trick Room, Conkeldurr's Mach Punch outspeeds the aforementioned Pokemon using Sucker Punch, and OHKOes both users of STAB Sucker Punch. Even though this set's EVs allow it to survive a few super effective attacks, Reuniclus is severely damaged by Volcarona's Bug Buzz, Hydreigon's Dark Pulse, and Chandelure's Shadow Ball, although it can OHKO the latter two with Focus Blast and Shadow Ball respectively, assuming neither hold a resist Berry.</p> <p>If Reuniclus is unable to set up Trick Room, it will find itself unable to attack effectively due to its poor Speed stat. Therefore, a Pokemon that can remove or disable common users of Taunt or Imprison is very useful. Whimsicott can outspeed and Taunt every other Taunt user, while a Fake Out user such as Mienshao or Scrafty can halt opposing attempts to stop Reuniclus from setting up Trick Room. Encore is also able to neuter Reuniclus; if Whimsicott is on the field as Reuniclus uses Trick Room, it can use Encore the next turn to undo Trick Room and prevent Reuniclus from attacking. Switching out can remedy this, but this gives your opponent a free turn as you switch out. Mental Herb is an option to stop Taunt and Encore, but Reuniclus loses a lot of power when using it. Generally it is not recommended.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Trick Room is the basis of this set, allowing Reuniclus to outspeed almost everything on the field. Coming from a base 125 Special Attack, Psychic is Reuniclus's STAB attack, and with a Life Orb boost, will do major damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Shadow Ball and Focus Blast complement its coverage, letting it hit everything for at least neutral damage while nabbing key KOs on many common Pokemon, such as Chandelure and Hydreigon.</p> <p>The EVs maximize Reuniclus's Special Attack, allowing it to become an offensive force, while preserving its decent bulk. Additionally, with this investment, Reuniclus can survive Timid Volcarona's Bug Buzz, Modest Chople Berry Hydreigon's Dark Pulse, and Quiet Chandelure's Shadow Ball, as well as a +4 Terrakion's Rock Slide, making it an excellent check to the vaunted Beat Up Whimsicott-Terrakion combination. Lastly, the EVs allow Reuniclus to survive Landorus's Earthquake and Thundurus's Discharge, so that it can set up Trick Room on the turn they attack and hit them hard on the next.</p> <p>Psyshock can work over Psychic, allowing Reuniclus to hit hard on the physical side as well. This helps against Jellicent and Volcarona, doing much more damage than Shadow Ball or Psychic would. Psychic is generally the better choice, though, as it hits harder overall. Protect is always useful in VGC play, and considering the shaky accuracy of Focus Blast, may be more useful if Reuniclus is paired with a Fighting-type, such as Conkeldurr or Scrafty, which can hit hard with its STAB attacks.</p> <p>Conkeldurr makes an excellent teammate with its massive Attack stat; with Mach Punch, it can take out the Sucker Punch users which tend to trouble Reuniclus, and its powerful multi-target hitting Rock Slide can OHKO Chandelure and Volcarona, both of whom can easily take out Reuniclus. Mienshao makes another good partner, as it can Taunt Chandelure to stop it from using Imprison, which would prevent Trick Room from being set up, while its Fake Out can give Reuniclus a free turn to set up Trick Room. Mienshao also packs powerful Fighting-type moves to easily OHKO the Dark-types that can give Reuniclus trouble. Any user of a spread attack will help Reuniclus considerably; although it hits hard, it doesn't have super effective coverage on some common VGC 2011 Pokemon, and a user of Rock Slide, Heat Wave, or Blizzard can help to complete KOs against Pokemon such as the genie trio.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Although Swanna is cursed with mediocre offensive and defensive stats, it can support its team in several ways. Swanna is great at setting up hail, rain, and Tailwind thanks to its good Speed, making it a useful asset to a variety of teammates. Moves that can inflict status are preferred, which makes it easier for Swanna to turn situations around in its favor. All in all, Swanna should not be underestimated at supporting its team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>4 Attack EVs, a Jolly nature, and physical moves could be used instead, but the many status affliction possibilities from the special set would be missed. Though Brave Bird has better accuracy than Hurricane, the recoil damage hinders Swanna's usefulness. If a physical set is being used, Dive would be the only possible Water-type STAB. Protect could be used over Ice Beam if Swanna's partners already have it covered or if a physical Swanna is being used. Protect can definitely come in handy in tough situations; if Swanna is meant to survive for multiple turns, it should definitely be considered. The only point of a physical Swanna would be for Pokemon with low Defense, which isn't common. The special set would definitely be more useful. Surf can be used over Scald, as it can restore health to a Water Absorb partner. Swanna's movepool isn't very good, and other Pokemon such as Samurott can set up Hail more consistently without a 4x weakness to Electric-type moves or 2x weakness to Rock Slide. If Swanna is being used, the rest of the team is usually built around it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Swanna is KOed by several common types, so it can usually only set up. Even if it lives past the first turn, Swanna can't do much else. Swanna's typing isn't very useful in a metagame with Pokemon such as Thundurus being common. Terrakion, Thundurus, and Eelektross with STAB Rock Slides and Thunderbolts easily KO a Swanna that isn't holding a Focus Sash. Taunt, commonly carried by Tornadus and Whimsicott, prevents Swanna from setting up. Fake Out users can break Swanna's Focus Sash. Due to their inability to OHKO anything, Swanna are usually considered inferior to other choices, though Swanna does have the ability to take a hit from quite a few of the common VGC 2011 Pokemon, ultimately deciding Swanna's life on Speed.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Field Support": {
        "description": "<p>Other than supporting its team, Swanna can't do much else, so Tailwind, Hail, or Rain Dance should be used accordingly. Tailwind is the dominant choice, supporting all of Swanna's teammates. Scald is the preferred STAB Water-type move that Swanna can choose from, because of Scald's ability to burn. With Hurricane, Swanna can 2HKO Amoonguss and OHKO Jolly Virizion; the possibility of confusing the opponent supports Swanna's teammates too. Air Slash is the better choice if Rain Dance is not used; without the boosted accuracy, Hurricane isn't reliable. Air Slash's ability to flinch can also be useful in tough situations. Ice Beam is for coverage, hitting most common Pokemon in VGC 2011 for super effective damage. Ice Beam doesn't OHKO anything of significance, but it can take down quite a few things that were damaged beforehand, Swanna can really only finish off what its partner leaves. Although these moves don't have much coverage, and are walled by Pokemon such as Jellicent, Swanna can be threatening when it has good synergy with its teammates. Big Pecks is chosen over Keen Eye as Swanna's defenses already suffer enough, and some Pokemon take advantage of stat lowering moves. Timid is preferred to allow Swanna to be able to set up as soon as possible since it's not going to be attacking much.</p> <p>Many Pokemon outclass Swanna and have the ability to set up more consistently. There will rarely be a chance to do much other than set up with Swanna, so a bulkier Pokemon may be preferred. The EVs mentioned allow Swanna to take quite a few common attacks. With this EV Spread, Swanna survives anything Amoonguss throws at it and handles a few non-STAB Rock Slides. Swanna also has the ability to take anything Chandelure, Jellicent, or Tornadus decide to dish out. The ever common Fighting-types, Conkeldurr and Scrafty, can only 2HKO Swanna with Rock Slide without any boosts, while Swanna deals serious damage in return.</p> <p>Unless hail is being set up, Focus Sash is usually the best choice of item to use on Swanna, as most teams have something that can OHKO it, while Lum Berry helps with Amoonguss, which is extremely common in VGC 2011. Relying on secondary effects is Swanna's biggest offensive tactic because it needs two super effective hits for it to take out anything. Note that other Pokemon can do this better, such as Thunder Wave Thundurus and Whimsicott because of their priority from Prankster.</p> <p>Pokemon with Rage Powder and Fake Out are excellent choices to pair with Swanna, as they give Swanna a chance to set up. Amoonguss can handle anything that is super effective against Swanna, so it's definitely the preferred one of the two Rage Powder users in VGC 2011. A Fake Out user can flinch a Taunt user aiming to ruin Swanna's ability to set up. Any partner benefits from Swanna's Tailwind. Jellicent, Vanilluxe, and other Blizzard users prefer Swanna's ability to set up Hail. With Rain Dance, Seismitoad, the only usable Swift Swim Sweeper in VGC 2011, should be considered as well as several of the other Water-type Pokemon. Earthquake users are also viable partners for Swanna thanks to its immunity to Ground-type moves. It's also important to draw attention away from Swanna so it can help. Haxorus is a great distraction because of its sky-high Attack stat. To make sure Swanna does not die, switch it in on predicted Earthquakes.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Sawsbuck is a decent offensive threat that can become very successful when used with a combination of Sunny Day and Tailwind. It lives up to its reputation as one of the best Chlorophyll users in the metagame which, combined with base 100 Attack, makes Sawsbuck a solid choice for any Sunny Day or Tailwind VGC team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Protect can be replaced with Swords Dance to raise Sawsbuck's Attack. Although Jump Kick or Megahorn is preferred on Sawsbuck, remember that Wild Charge is an option to easily OHKO Tornadus and Archeops. Nature Power becomes Earthquake in Wi-Fi battles, giving Sawsbuck an option to easily 2HKO Chandelure. If Item Clause is an issue, you can switch out Life Orb for a Focus Sash or vice versa, as they are both good items.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Chandelure is probably the best counter to Sawsbuck. It can easily OHKO Sawsbuck with Heat Wave and is immune to Jump Kick and Return, while also resisting Horn Leech and Megahorn. Conkeldurr is another great counter, as it can OHKO Sawsbuck with a priority Mach Punch once Guts activates. Opposing Tornadus can easily set up Tailwind, which makes its teammates faster than Sawsbuck; it can also OHKO Sawsbuck with Acrobatics.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sunny Day Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Sawsbuck is a potent threat under the sun. When Chlorophyll is activated, this deer has a Speed of 294 with Adamant and a whopping 332 Speed with Jolly, allowing Sawsbuck to outspeed every unboosted Pokemon in the metagame. Horn Leech is a good STAB move that can hit popular VGC Pokemon hard while regaining health; for instance, it OHKOes Terrakion and 2HKOes maximum HP Jellicent. Return is a great secondary STAB as it dents common Pokemon that resist Horn Leech, such as Tornadus, Thundurus, Whimsicott, and maximum HP Amoonguss. Double-Edge is stronger, but Return is preferred as it OHKOes Thundurus and Tornadus, two major threats to Sawsbuck, without the recoil damage of Double-Edge.</p> <p>There are two good moves worth considering for the third moveslot. Jump Kick OHKOes Bisharp and Zoroark and 2HKOes Vanilluxe; however, it only 3HKOes Chople Berry Scrafty and damages Sawsbuck if the attack misses or the opposing Pokemon uses Protect. Megahorn 2HKOes Musharna and OHKOes Hydreigon; the latter is a huge threat to any sun teams due to its resistances to Fire-, Grass-, and Ghost-type moves. Protect is a very useful move to have in the VGC metagame, as it provides Sawsbuck with a guarantee of safety while its partner sets up Sunny Day or Tailwind. This can save Sawsbuck from faster threats and priority moves, such as Conkeldurr's Mach Punch, an attack that can OHKO with a Guts boost or 2HKO without one. It is also very useful for scouting out opposing moves, giving you time to react accordingly.</p> <p>This set is essential for sun teams, and will work better when used in conjunction with Tailwind support. Sawsbuck's best partner in this case would be Whimsicott. With Prankster, Whimsicott can set up Sunny Day quickly for Sawsbuck to sweep and also has access to Tailwind and Helping Hand. Tailwind can give Sawsbuck the advantage against other Tailwind-boosted Pokemon, while Helping Hand increases the base power of Sawsbuck's moves by 50%. Sawsbuck also works very well with other sun sweepers such as Chandelure, Lilligant, and Darmanitan. However, Chandelure and Conkeldurr counter Sawsbuck. To combat Chandelure, Hydreigon and Terrakion are good partners due to Hydreigon's access to Dark-type moves and Terrakion's Rock Slide. As for Conkeldurr, Tornadus and Amoonguss would make excellent teammates, able to defeat it with Acrobatics or the latter's Giga Drain, respectively.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Sawsbuck has access to Sap Sipper, which increases Sawsbuck's Attack when hit by a Grass-type move. With this in mind, Sawsbuck can switch into and effectively hard counter Amoonguss, one of the most popular and effective VGC Pokemon. Horn Leech is a good STAB move that keeps Sawsbuck's health full. Return is a good secondary STAB move, 2HKOing Thundurus, Tornadus, and Whimsicott, while 3HKOing Amoonguss. Jump Kick can OHKO Bisharp and Zoroark, 2HKO Hydreigon, and 3HKO Chople Berry Scrafty. Nature Power turns into Earthquake when used in Wi-Fi battles, which can 2HKO Chandelure, one of Sawsbuck's biggest threats. Protect is always a good to have to scout for priority moves; Fake Out can break Sawsbuck's Focus Sash while Conkeldurr's Guts boosted Mach Punch gets a clean OHKO. Protect also allows Sawsbuck's teammate to set up Tailwind, and lets it scout an opponent's moves. Sawsbuck shines with a Focus Sash, especially with Horn Leech to keep its health full.</p> <p>This set is very useful on Tailwind teams, as it can use the Speed boost to achieve the same effect as Chlorophyll. Whimsicott and Tornadus are the best Tailwind users, thanks to Prankster. Sawsbuck pairs up well with Tornadus, who can OHKO Conkeldurr with Flying Gem Acrobatics. A Sap Sipper Sawsbuck is also a very good teammate for Jellicent. With Tailwind support, Jellicent can outspeed and take out Chandelure with a Shadow Ball or Water Spout, while Sawsbuck takes care of Amoonguss that often threatens Jellicent. Hydreigon is another good partner; Levitate makes it immune to Nature Power, allowing Sawsbuck to take out Chandelure without harming its teammate. Bouffalant might seem like a better option than Sawsbuck in this role due to its higher defenses; however, Sawsbuck is much faster and has access to Grass-type STAB moves, making it the superior choice.</p>"

Unfortunately, a shallow movepool and a weakness to common Fire-type attacks really limits Escavalier. Despite these shortcomings, Escavalier is a good anti-Trick Room Pokemon, because its STAB Megahorn hits several common Trick Room users for super effective damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>If you find Megahorn's imperfect accuracy to be an issue, X-Scissor can be used as an alternative. However, that to get the same KOs that Megahorn gets you need a Bug Gem or Expert Belt. Quick Guard lets Escavalier support the rest of its team by shielding them from priority moves such as Mach Punch. Reversal could be used alongside a Focus Sash to take a super effective move and KO back. Swords Dance is also viable, allowing Escavalier to sweep in Trick Room, but in the fast-paced VGC 2011 metagame, this usually results in Escavalier being KOed. Iron Defense boosts Escavalier's already high Defense, but it is not recommended for the same reason as Swords Dance. Faint Attack lets Escavalier hit Ghost-types, but unfortunately, it is illegal with Megahorn, forcing you to use X-Scissor. This makes Pursuit the better choice. Focus Sash can be used to survive critical hits and extremely powerful Fire-type attacks such as Chandelure's Overheat. Speaking of critical hits, Shell Armor is an alternative to Swarm if you are deathly afraid of them.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Volcarona takes all of Escavalier's attacks with ease and incinerates it with Heat Wave, though Escavalier will survive if it carries an Occa Berry. If Escavalier lacks Pursuit, Chandelure and Jellicent can take it down with their STAB moves while absorbing all of its attacks with ease, and can do severe damage even if it does carry Pursuit.

Megahorn also OHKOes Hydreigon, who threatens Escavalier with Flamethrower or Fire Blast. STAB Iron Head OHKOes Terrakion, while Double-Edge is Escavalier's best option against the Fire-types who resist its STAB moves. However, Pursuit can be used instead of Double-Edge, as it 3HKOes Chandelure and Jellicent. Thus, in Trick Room, Escavalier can outspeed and weaken these foes, allowing its partner to finish them off. Pursuit also has the added advantage of being perfectly legal with Megahorn which, unlike Faint Attack, allows Escavalier to forgo the much weaker X-Scissor. Protect allows Escavalier to escape unharmed for a turn while its partner KOes a potential threat to Escavalier. Swarm is the best choice for an ability, as it boosts the power of Megahorn to monstrous levels when Escavalier is low on health, allowing it to launch one last powerful blow before going down.</p> <p>An Occa Berry allows Escavalier to survive Chandelure's super effective Heat Wave, and to give its partner a chance to KO the Heat Wave user.

Mental Herb can protect Foongus from priority Taunt, but the loss of Eviolite really hurts Foongus's bulk.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Conkeldurr is immune to Foongus's Spore thanks to the Flame Orb it generally holds, but Mach Punch and Drain Punch can easily be pulled from their intended target with Rage Powder. Safeguard protects the opponent's Pokemon from Spore. Pokemon holding Lum Berry can shrug off a Spore and fire back an attack. Prankster Taunts can prevent Foongus from using Spore, Rage Powder, or Protect; and Prankster Substitutes can block Foongus's Spore before he can use it.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This set is meant to be used with Trick Room in play, alongside an effective attacker. After Foongus enters the field, he can render almost any opposing Pokemon useless with Spore. Your attacker can knock out one of your opponent's Pokemon while Foongus puts the other one to sleep to prevent your opponent from attacking. Foongus is slower than Musharna, Gigalith, Escavalier, Ferrothorn, and doesn't have to Speed tie with Reuniclus, Cofagrigus, and opposing Amoonguss. Most importantly, this allows Foongus to put Musharna and Reuniclus to sleep before they can hit him with Psychic, and also cripples Amoonguss before he puts any of your Pokemon to sleep. This provides Foongus with a small advantage over Amoonguss while still being able to assist a sweep in Trick Room. Protect can be used to scout for the opponent's moves and Rage Powder can be used to draw moves away from your teammate, possibly saving them and wasting your opponent's turn. For example, if you have a Reuniclus beside your Foongus, you can draw Bisharp's Sucker Punch away from Reuniclus, while taking no damage. Giga Drain allows Foongus to not be complete Taunt bait, and can hit Jellicent and Terrakion for decent damage. Here are some calculations against Jellicent and Terrakion.</p> <ul> <li>Giga Drain vs. 252/4 Jellicent 24% - 30%</li> <li>Giga Drain vs. 4/0 Jellicent 28% - 35%</li> <li>Giga Drain vs. 4/0 Terrakion 35% - 40%</li> </ul> <p>The EV spread maximizes his defenses to make the most use of Eviolite. The best Trick Room partners for Foongus are Reuniclus and Jellicent. Both possess the offensive presence needed to attack sleeping foes, and Jellicent enjoys Foongus taking Grass- and Electric-type attacks with Rage Powder. As previously stated, Amoonguss is necessary to justify the use of Foongus on your team in the first place. Gigalith is a another great partner in Trick Room, as Foongus can draw away Grass- and Fighting-type moves that Gigalith hates while taking almost no damage. This allows Gigalith to score many OHKOs with Rock Slide, while Foongus can put whichever of your opponent's Pokemon Gigalith can't OHKO to sleep.</p>"

  "Amoonguss": {
    "overview": "<p>Amoonguss's excellent bulk and typing allows it to take both physical and special hits, and a key resistance to common Fighting-type attacks helps it immensely. Its access to Spore and Rage Powder allows it to fit into any team, and especially helps Trick Room teams to set up. However, many common Pokemon, such as Tornadus, Reuniclus, and Chandelure, can easily OHKO it, and its low Speed stat means it can't do much to stop this. Overall, though, its tremendous bulk and access to Spore makes Amoonguss an excellent choice for almost any team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Amoonguss can be used at levels lower than 50, in order to outspeed more Pokemon in Trick Room with only a minor decrease in bulk. For example, at level 49, Amoonguss Speed ties with Musharna, and outspeeds opposing Reuniclus and Amoonguss in Trick Room, allowing it to become a more effective check to opposing Trick Room teams. Amoonguss has access to Synthesis, which increases its survivability even more, but it suffers from four moveslot syndrome already, and is still OHKOed by strong super effective attacks or when double-targeted. Its low Speed also means it won't be able to recover health very easily. Amoonguss has access to both Rain Dance and Sunny Day, allowing it to support a rain- or sun-based team, but it has very low Speed, making it generally inferior to Pokemon such as Whimsicott and Volcarona, who can set the weather up with priority or substantial offensive presence. Substitute can work well with Amoonguss's excellent defenses, but it has lacks the offensive stats to take advantage of it, and is generally much more effective just using Spore to incapacitate the opponent. Sludge Bomb is an alternate attacking move that has higher Base Power than Giga Drain, but does not recover health, nor does it allow Amoonguss to take out Terrakion even with Safeguard up, and as such is usually an inferior choice.</p> <p>Amoonguss can be used well in Tailwind teams simply because of its access to Spore, allowing it to incapacitate the bulkier Pokemon that plague Tailwind teams. Although utilizing a Timid nature and 252 Speed EVs causes Amoonguss to lose a lot of bulk, it can outspeed all Pokemon up to Thundurus and Tornadus when Tailwind is up. Amoonguss can also run a whole host of other items to confound its usual counters. While Mental Herb and Coba Berry halt the most standard counters, an Occa Berry stops Chandelure's Fire Blast or Overheat from OHKOing, and a Yache Berry can allow it to survive a Vanilluxe's Ice Beam, giving it an extra turn to use Rage Powder or Spore an opponent. Focus Sash allows Amoonguss to survive an attack of any type, but means it will die after using Rage Powder, and is generally an inferior choice. While it doesn't stop these attacks, a Sitrus Berry greatly increases Amoonguss's survivability and allows it to tank neutral assaults much more easily, making it yet another viable choice.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Tornadus and Archeops can both do great damage to Amoonguss with a Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics, and can KO with help from a partner, giving it no chance to support the team at all. A partner such as Terrakion utilizing super effective attacks or a Trick Room user such as Reuniclus can help tremendously, KOing the aforementioned threats with Rock Slide or setting up Trick Room as Amoonguss uses Protect. A Fire Gem-boosted Heat Wave from Chandelure also OHKOes Amoonguss, as does an unboosted Fire Blast or Overheat. Chandelure has many weaknesses, though, and with its base 80 Speed, it's not too difficult to take out; a Terrakion's Rock Slide or Landorus's Earthquake will KO it if it's not holding Focus Sash, and a bulky Trick Room user such as Musharna can set up Trick Room as Amoonguss uses Protect. Musharna, Reuniclus, and Beheeyem are Pokemon which commonly set up Trick Room, and they can all OHKO or 2HKO Amoonguss with Psychic. Escavalier can help to rectify this, outspeeding the above threats under Trick Room and KOing with X-Scissor or Megahorn. Chandelure can also help if Trick Room is not up yet, 2HKOing both with Shadow Ball, or OHKOing with a Ghost Gem-boosted Shadow Ball.</p> <p>Any Taunt user can stop Amoonguss in its tracks if it doesn't have Mental Herb. Thundurus and Tornadus with Substitute are often used to stall out turns of Trick Room, and can completely obstruct any of Amoonguss's assaults if it does not possess Hidden Power Ice. A Rock Slide user such as Conkeldurr can break their Substitutes, while Gigalith can outspeed Amoonguss in Trick Room and break the Substitute with Rock Slide, allowing Amoonguss to put them to sleep with Spore. Pokemon such as Terrakion and Virizion can use Safeguard to stop Amoonguss from using Spore.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Spore, in conjunction with Amoonguss's excellent bulk, will almost always incapacitate an opponent the first turn unless they specifically prepare for it. Rage Powder allows Amoonguss to help its team set up field effects such as Tailwind or Trick Room, and with its bulk, it can easily take moves that could OHKO frailer Pokemon. It also attracts Beat Up, so the vaunted Beat Up Whimsicott-Terrakion combination utterly fails against Amoonguss. Giga Drain 2HKOes Terrakion, and does good damage to Water-types such as Jellicent or Samurott while healing back HP. It also helps break Focus Sashes. Protect allows Amoonguss to stall the opponent, and gives its partner time to take out whatever may be threatening it. The EVs give it excellent special bulk, allowing it to take Reuniclus's Life Orb Psychic and take much less damage from Chandelure's Heat Wave.</p> <p>Hidden Power Ice can work well over Protect; although Amoonguss loses the ability to survive a move that would otherwise OHKO it, it lets Amoonguss hit the genies and Dragon-types for a good amount of damage, which can help immensely if Amoonguss is the last Pokemon on the field. Mental Herb is a viable choice over Coba Berry; although Amoonguss loses the ability to take a Flying Jewel-boosted Acrobatics from Tornadus or Archeops, two of its common counters, a Mental Herb allows it to bypass Taunt and Encore for a turn.</p> <p>A Sassy nature can be used as well, but Amoonguss doesn't outspeed other Pokemon with base 30 Speed, such as Musharna and Reuniclus, and it will thus be unable to use Spore on them before they use Psychic to severely damage or KO Amoonguss. A Sassy nature also does not allow Amoonguss to outspeed opposing Amoonguss and Spore them if Trick Room is not up. However, if Trick Room is up, a Sassy nature will allow Amoonguss to Speed tie with these Pokemon and possibly use Spore on them, incapacitating them before they can take it out. As a lead, Amoonguss tends to do better with a Bold nature. However, if Amoonguss isn't being used as a lead, it generally has greater success with a Sassy nature and 0 Speed IVs.</p> <p>A Lum Berry is another viable item; if Amoonguss faces another Amoonguss in a Trick Room mirror match, a Lum Berry will allow Amoonguss to always take the opposing Spore, Spore back, and remain awake and able to support its team. Trick Room teams can utilize Amoonguss very effectively, as Rage Powder can almost always guarantee that Trick Room will be set up, while Amoonguss can use Trick Room to abuse its low Speed and spam Spore. For this reason, Reuniclus is an excellent partner for Amoonguss due to with its ability to set up Trick Room and 2HKO the entire metagame with Trick Room in effect. Amoonguss can also work well on faster teams, and its access to Rage Powder allows it to sponge an attack aimed at its partner, giving Pokemon with many weaknesses, such as Terrakion and Hydreigon, a turn to take out many of their common checks.</p> <p>Taunt users can completely wreck Amoonguss if it does not have a Mental Herb, so a Rock Slide user can help to take out Thundurus and Tornadus, the most common users of Taunt, while an Ice Beam or Blizzard user such as Cryogonal or Vanilluxe can hurt the genies as well as Whimsicott. Safeguard users such as Terrakion, Virizion, and Cobalion can stop Amoonguss from using Spore, and remove much of its utility. A Taunt user, particularly Tornadus or Whimsicott, or a Pokemon such as Archeops that can OHKO them before they use Safeguard can allow Amoonguss to bypass this and put the opponent to sleep.</p>"

However, it has weaknesses to common Dark- and Ghost-type attacks, so Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Chandelure threaten to deal serious damage. With the correct support, however, Jellicent can sweep in whatever capacity that is needed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hydro Pump could be used in place of Water Spout, but its shaky accuracy makes Water Spout, and Scald as well, better alternatives. Wacan Berry is an option on the Trick Room set, allowing Jellicent to take Thundurus's Electric Gem-boosted Thunderbolt and set up Trick Room. Taunt could be used on the Tailwind set to stop Trick Room from being set up. However, a faster Pokemon usually does this job much better. Will-O-Wisp keeps Bisharp from OHKOing Jellicent with STAB Sucker Punch. A Mental Herb could be used to block Taunt from common Prankster Pokemon such as Whimsicott, allowing Jellicent to set up Trick Room, but Jellicent is often better when setting up Trick Room late-game, when Pokemon with Prankster have often been knocked out.</p> <p>The choice of ability depends on the rest of your team. Water Absorb is best if you are utilizing Hydreigon for the \"SazaJelly\" combo, or any other Pokemon with Surf. However, Cursed Body is usually better to disable super effective moves that threaten Jellicent and shut down that Pokemon the rest of the match.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Bisharp can stop Jellicent with STAB Sucker Punch, forcing Jellicent to Protect or switch out to avoid being KOed. Thundurus outspeeds and 2HKOes Jellicent unless Tailwind or Trick Room (on each set, respectively) is in effect, in which case Jellicent can 2HKO Thundurus with Ice Beam. Scrafty can deal significant damage with STAB Crunch and weaken Jellicent's Water Spout, which is Jellicent's only offense against it. Hydreigon resists both of Jellicent's STAB attacks, and threatens Jellicent with STAB Dark Pulse.</p>",

Water Spout deals a lot of damage off the bat, especially with a Water Gem. Scald can be used, however, if the weakening of Water Spout's Base Power after taking a hit is an issue. Trick Room is there to reset Trick Room if it has gone down, or not been set up at all. Shadow Ball is for STAB and hitting opposing Ghost-types such as Chandelure, who otherwise threaten it, for super effective damage. Ice Beam hits Dragon-types and the genies, though Protect can be used for stalling out Tailwind or letting Jellicent's partner take out a dangerous Pokemon.</p> <p>Water Gem gives Water Spout a one-turn boost, but Sitrus Berry lets Jellicent stay alive longer and maintain Water Spout's high Base Power. The EVs maximize HP and Special Attack for bulk and increased attacking power. 0 Speed IVs lets Jellicent be as slow as possible in Trick Room. Still, Jellicent is a tad too fast for Trick Room, so Pokemon such as Musharna will move before Jellicent in Trick Room, possibly weakening its Water Spout with a super effective Shadow Ball.</p>"

Jellicent also benefits from Rain Dance, so Thundurus or Tornadus are good partners too. Fake Out support is greatly beneficial to Jellicent, allowing it to use STAB Water Spouts with full Base Power.

Ice Beam hits Dragon-types and genies, and while Blizzard hits both, it has shaky accuracy, and is thus not recommended. Scald is used in case Jellicent takes damage so that it won't be stuck with a weakened Water Spout as its only STAB attack. On the other hand, Energy Ball hits opposing Water-types, such as Seismitoad, for super effective damage.</p> <p>Timid is the recommended nature, because with Modest Jellicent misses out on outspeeding Timid Thundurus.

Waterfall gives Alomomola a reasonably powerful STAB attack that ensures it's not useless under the effects of Taunt, while also making it an excellent check to most Rock- or Ground-type attackers such as Terrakion and Excadrill.

Discharge is the preferred option, but only if a teammate who isn't affected by the move, such as Landorus or Zebstrika, is present. Thunderbolt is preferred for a Trick Room team, because Discharge's paralysis rate helps out the other team.</p> <p>Musharna and other bulky Pokemon take negligible damage from Eelektross's attacks, so a powerful physical attacker is the best partner to this set. Landorus has a high base Speed, immunity to Discharge, and access to a STAB Earthquake that Eelektross is not affected by, making it a top-notch teammate. Golurk and Krookodile also fit perfectly with Eelektross. Golurk creates a slower version of the common double genie combo, while Krookodile provides Intimidate. Bisharp is another decent partner to Eelektross, as long as Eelektross does not run Discharge. Zebstrika can make decent use of the Special Attack boost Discharge gives it, but Thundurus generally does a better job.</p>"

  "Beheeyem": {
    "overview": "<p>Beheeyem is largely outclassed in its limited roles by the likes of Reuniclus and Musharna, but there are a few traits, such as a higher Special Attack stat (than Musharna) and access to Ally Switch, that let Beheeyem stand out. Since Beheeyem possesses a base Speed of 40, it can abuse Trick Room very well. Beheeyem is also a strong choice on any team that is in need of a Pokemon that can set up Trick Room. Other than having a typing that resists common Fighting-type attacks, Beheeyem is very poor defensively; 75 / 75 / 95 defenses mean that Beheeyem's survivability will be quite low. Beheeyem has access to Imprison and Trick Room, both of which can be used in different situations. For example, Imprison can be used to prevent the opponent from setting up Trick Room. All in all, Beheeyem can be an annoying Pokemon to face if played correctly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Disable can be used to prevent an opponent from using its most effective move against Beheeyem. Though it may sound strange, Rock Slide is a viable option as Beheeyem possesses an unusually high base 75 Attack for a Psychic-type. Rock Slide allows Beheeyem to hit Chandelure, Tornadus, and Volcarona for super effective damage. By investing just 20 EVs in Attack, Beheeyem is able to 2HKO Charti Berry Volcarona. Nasty Plot can be used to boost Beheeyem's Special Attack to high levels, allowing it to hit opposing Pokemon very hard. Beheeyem also gets Recover, which is a nice option to have as it greatly increases Beheeyem's survivability. Hidden Power Fighting provides coverage against Dark- and Steel-types, such as Scrafty and Ferrothorn. Synchronize can be used over Telepathy, but when running Trick Room, paralyzing the opponent hurts you more than it hurts them. Simple Beam is a gimmicky option that can either be used on an ally with a boosting move (so that the boost obtained gets doubled), or it can be used on an opposing Pokemon to change their ability into Simple.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Scrafty is a big threat to Beheeyem as it is immune to Psychic, resists Shadow Ball, and works well in Trick Room. Scrafty can also threaten Beheeyem with a STAB, super effective Crunch. Volcarona can take a hit from Beheeyem and fire off a super effective Bug Buzz which will easily 2HKO Beheeyem. If Beheeyem isn't carrying Mental Herb, Taunt users are good counters to it, as Beheeyem's primary objective is to set up Trick Room. Ferrothorn easily walls Beheeyem as it resists Psychic, Shadow Ball, and Thunderbolt. Ferrothorn can also do good amount of damage to Beheeyem with a STAB Power Whip. Escavalier can take anything Beheeyem throws at it with ease and can tear apart Beheeyem with a powerful Megahorn. Hydreigon can OHKO Beheeyem with a Dark Gem-boosted Dark Pulse, while Beheeyem can hardly touch Hydreigon.</p>",

      "Trick Room Support": {
        "description": "<p>Beheeyem's stat distribution makes it ideal for setting up Trick Room as it is bulky enough to take one hit and a base 40 Speed stat allows it to function well in Trick Room. Psychic is Beheeyem's strongest option for a STAB move, and it hits common Fighting-types such as Terrakion for super effective damage. Ally Switch is what makes Beheeyem unique; it is an amazing defensive move that allows Beheeyem to take hits directed at its teammate and vice versa. It should be noted that Ally Switch gets +1 priority. Shadow Ball is the first alternative to Ally Switch; it hits opposing Psychic-types that would otherwise wall Beheeyem, such as Reuniclus and Musharna, for super effective damage. Thunderbolt, the second alternative, hits Flying- and Water-types such as Tornadus and Jellicent hard. By utilizing Team Preview, one can decide whether or not to set up Trick Room. For example, if the opponent's Pokemon are faster than yours, you should set up Trick Room, and if the opponent's Pokemon are slower than yours, then you shouldn't. Protect shields Beheeyem from Fake Out and can also be used for scouting purposes, such as to check if the opponent's Pokemon are carrying Taunt or not. Imprison is mainly to prevent slower teams from setting up Trick Room.</p> <p>The reason why a Modest nature is used over a Quiet one is to ensure that Beheeyem is able to outspeed Trick Room users, such as Musharna, and successfully use Imprison to prevent them from setting up Trick Room. If the opponent isn't running a Trick Room team, a Modest nature still allows Beheeyem to be faster than the opposing Pokemon in Trick Room. 252 HP and 108 SpD EVs allow Beheeyem to survive a Shadow Ball from a Modest Chandelure, set up Trick Room, and hit back with either Shadow Ball or Psychic. The remaining 148 EVs are placed in Beheeyem's Special Attack to give it as much power as possible. Sitrus Berry recovers a decent amount of Beheeyem's health when it's low, thus, increasing Beheeyem's survivability. Mental Herb is useful against Taunt users as it prevents Taunt from affecting Beheeyem, but only once. Lum Berry prevents Amoonguss from putting Beheeyem to sleep, thus allowing it to set up Trick Room. Unfortunately, standard Amoonguss can survive a Psychic from Beheeyem. Telepathy is great ability to have in the VGC metagame as it prevents Beheeyem from taking damage from multi-target moves, such as Earthquake and Surf, from its teammates.</p> <p>Scrafty has great synergy with Beheeyem; with Ally Switch, Beheeyem can take Fighting-type hits aimed at Scrafty, and Scrafty can take Ghost-, Dark-, and most Bug-type attacks aimed at Beheeyem. Fortunately, a Scrafty with a Brave nature works considerably well under Trick Room. A Quiet Chandelure with Protect is also a good teammate to have as it can quickly dispose of opposing Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon that threaten Beheeyem. In general, Pokemon that work well in Trick Room largely benefit from the Trick Room support that Beheeyem can provide.</p>"

The axe-face dragon learns many noteworthy spread moves in addition to powerful STAB moves. Haxorus's powerful attacks are backed by a great ability in Mold Breaker. This ability is all the more fantastic in VGC, as it allows Haxorus to hit Pokemon with the Levitate ability with Earthquake.</p>",

Golurk has a lot of bulk and resists Rock Slide. Defensive Scrafty can take anything Haxorus throws at it bar Swords Dance or Choice Band Outrage, and hit back with a super effective Ice Punch. Although rare, Choice Scarf Vanilluxe does a lot of damage with its STAB Ice-type attacks.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This is Haxorus's most effective set thanks to its flawless coverage and monstrous Attack. Protect stops Fake Out and scouts the opponent's strategy. Dragon Claw is a solid STAB choice, especially due to the rarity of Steel-types in VGC. Rock Slide provides good coverage and breaks Focus Sashes while ignoring Rage Powder. Haxorus is just fast enough to benefit from Rock Slide's flinch rate. Bisharp and other Steel-types resist Rock Slide and Dragon Claw, but take tremendous damage from Earthquake.</p> <p>Haban Berry prevents Haxorus from being OHKOed by Hydreigon's Dragon Pulse and enemy Haxorus's attacks. These are the only common moves that can OHKO Haxorus, so Haban Berry is an extremely effective item. However, Life Orb could be used to hit bulkier foes much harder. Haxorus will appreciate Life Orb when facing Amoonguss, Conkeldurr, and Musharna. However, lacking Haban Berry leaves Haxorus completely at the mercy of enemy Hydreigon. An Adamant nature and a bulkier EV spread allows Haxorus to be more effective against bulky Trick Room teams. When utilizing the bulky Adamant set, Taunt is a decent option to stop Musharna and Jellicent in their tracks.</p> <p>Tornadus makes an excellent partner. It is immune to Haxorus's Earthquake and can set up Tailwind easily. Tornadus also takes out Amoonguss in one hit, a feat that Dragon Claw cannot accomplish.</p>"

      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>The premise of this set is to grab one boost and attack. Haxorus sits at base 97 Speed, which is below the genies, Hydreigon, and many notable Pokemon. A single Dragon Dance allows Haxorus to outpace these major threats and boost its already monstrous attack to astronomical levels. This combination of enhanced power and speed, combined with excellent coverage and passable bulk, makes Haxorus a very threatening sweeper. Earthquake is the best choice for a spread attack, and hits the few Steel-types that resist Dragon Claw and Rock Slide. Rock Slide is Haxorus's most powerful attack against the genies, Volcarona, and Archeops.</p> <p>Life Orb increases Haxorus's damage output and compensates for Rock Slide's and Earthquake's reduced power when hitting both opponents. A Jolly nature with maximum Speed EVs is necessary in case Haxorus is unable to set up Dragon Dance.The EVs can be modified to allow Haxorus to survive specific attacks from threats, such as Hydreigon's Dragon Pulse. Haban Berry can also prolong Haxorus's time on the field; Haban Berry Haxorus can set up Dragon Dance in the face of Druddigon's Dragon Claw or Hydreigon's Dragon Pulse and KO back with a boosted Dragon Claw of its own. This single turn of protection is extremely valuable when one is looking to set up and sweep.</p> <p>Haxorus also learns Swords Dance, and could potentially use it instead of Dragon Dance in an attempt to smash through the metagame with brute strength. Haxorus's Swords Dance-boosted attacks will OHKO almost every Pokemon in VGC. Unfortunately, Haxorus's unboosted Speed and defensive stats are decidedly mediocre, giving it very little staying power.</p> <p>Without Tailwind support, abusing Swords Dance will be extremely difficult. Amoonguss or Volcarona can help Haxorus by using Rage Powder, allowing Haxorus to have a free turn to set up.</p>"
      },
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>With a Choice Scarf equipped, Haxorus outspeeds every unboosted Pokemon in VGC. This strategy forgoes a turn of set up at the cost of being locked into one move. Choice Scarf allows Haxorus to outspeed and KO many of its checks, such as the genies, Hydreigon, Vanilluxe, and Terrakion. Choice Band is also viable, and helps Haxorus to muscle through basically every Pokemon. Rock Slide can 2HKO the genies and occasionally nabs valuable flinches. Earthquake is not a move one should use recklessly, as its effectiveness requires one to consider the presence of Flying-types on both teams. However, the ability to hit Levitate users with Earthquake still makes Mold Breaker the preferred ability.</p> <p>Keep in mind that Mold Breaker negates your own partner's Levitate or Telepathy. The last move should only be used in specific situations. Outrage should be used when all other moves have no chance of KOing the opponent's Pokemon. Essentially, it should only be used when Dragon Claw is simply too weak. Dual Chop is very valuable against weak Focus Sash and Substitute users. If neither of these moves appeal, X-Scissor hits Musharna and Whimsicott for more damage while maintaining solid coverage. An alternate EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature should be used for the Choice Band set, to compensate for the absence of Choice Scarf.</p> <p>Haxorus loves having a Flying-type teammate, especially because Ice-types are not as common in VGC 2011. Tailwind helps out Haxorus immensely, especially when using Swords Dance. Tornadus is an excellent partner, as it is immune to Earthquake and can quickly set up Tailwind.</p>"

Mienshao can be severely hurt by Pokemon that are faster than it, such as Tornadus and Archeops, which can both take out Mienshao with Acrobatics. If the opponent is able to set up Trick Room or Tailwind, Mienshao might face problems due to its poor bulk, but will still be able to support its team with Wide Guard.

After using Fake Out, Mienshao has decent coverage with Rock Slide and a Fighting-type STAB move, either Drain Punch or High Jump Kick. Wide Guard allows Mienshao to be more of a support Pokemon, as it can cover both of the user's Pokemon at the same time, although this only works with multi-target moves.

Protect can be used over Wide Guard; although Protect is generally a more reliable move, it does not offer the same high reward that Wide Guard does. VGC 2011 has a large number of Protect users, and Mienshao can use Feint to bypass Protect and deal serious damage. Considering the fact that this is a doubles metagame, with correct prediction, both of the user's Pokemon can attack a Protect user thanks to Mienshao's Feint, making it a useful move to have in its arsenal. Tailwind users are good teammates to Mienshao, as they increase its already high Speed, and make it easier for it to deal damage by allowing it to outspeed several Pokemon.

Glare is an interesting option to catch the enemy off guard, but is best not used while utilizing Trick Room. Also, if you are not using an attack with a secondary effect, be sure to use Rough Skin, as there is no reason to miss out on free passive damage if you are not making use of Sheer Force's power boost.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Druddigon has no real counter as it 2HKOes every Pokemon in VGC 2011, but its low Speed and over-reliance on Sucker Punch to deal with faster foes can be taken advantage of by fast, powerful Pokemon or good prediction.

With the Sheer Force boost, Crunch is more powerful than Sucker Punch, and while in Trick Room, Druddigon won't have to worry about being outsped as much. However, Sucker Punch is still nice to fall back on if things don't go as planned. Rock Slide is a great move as it hits both opponents and is boosted by Sheer Force.

  "Bouffalant": {
    "overview": "<p>Bouffalant has great bulk, a high Attack stat, and an incredibly powerful STAB move in Head Charge, which can be further augmented with its ability Reckless, along with several excellent coverage moves. However, Bouffalant is quite slow, and as such requires Trick Room or Tailwind support to work effectively, or it will just end up being outsped and KOed. Its Normal typing also leaves it weak to the many Fighting-types of VGC 2011, including Conkeldurr, Scrafty, and Terrakion. Overall, though, its bulk and the huge power of its STAB Head Charge make it an excellent choice for any Trick Room or Tailwind team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Normal Gem is a good option for an item, allowing Bouffalant to OHKO almost anything with Head Charge, but its single use, the fact that Life Orb hits harder over two turns, and the loss of power on its other moves generally makes Life Orb the better option. Payback is an option to hit the Ghost-types that resist Bouffalant's main STAB for super effective damage, but its low Base Power means that it won't hit too hard, even on opponents it hits for super effective damage, and Bouffalant has good enough coverage with the moves already listed. Megahorn allows Bouffalant to hit Hydreigon and many Psychic-types harder than Head Charge if using Sap Sipper, but its low accuracy and inability to hit any of the Pokemon that resist Head Charge for super effective damage makes it generally an inferior choice. A Sitrus Berry allows Bouffalant to extend its bulk even further and stay around a bit longer; although it loses the valuable Life Orb boost, it is able to abuse its good bulk and possibly stay in an extra turn to deal some more damage, and offset the recoil caused by Head Charge.</p> <p>Thrash or Giga Impact may seem like powerful STAB options, but a Reckless Head Charge outdamages Thrash and is very near to Giga Impact in power, so they're both quite unnecessary, even without considering their crippling side effects. Even with Sap Sipper, though, Giga Impact's recharge turn after use allows Bouffalant to be easily KOed, or worse, allows the opponent to set up or take down Trick Room or Tailwind, completely destroying any advantage gained by a KO. Swords Dance is certainly a usable move with Bouffalant's great defenses, and allows it to OHKO almost anything, but Bouffalant's weakness to Fighting-types and reliance upon Trick Room or Tailwind to attack effectively means that it is better off simply attacking rather than wasting turns of Trick Room or Tailwind by setting up. Taunt allows Bouffalant to stop Trick Room from being set up on a Tailwind team, but with Mental Herb easily stopping it, it will be useless most of the time.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Bouffalant is almost always stopped cold by most Fighting-types, taking huge damage from their STAB moves and being unable to OHKO most of them in return. Many Rock- and Steel-types can easily take any of Bouffalant's attacks outside of Earthquake, which can damage Bouffalant's partner. Chandelure and Cofagrigus are immune to Head Charge and take little from Bouffalant's other attacks. Jellicent easily walls Bouffalant if it doesn't carry Wild Charge. Amoonguss can easily put a stop to Bouffalant, taking any attack and putting it to sleep with Spore, but must be very wary of Sap Sipper, which allows Bouffalant to increase its Attack after being hit by Spore.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Bouffalant's STAB Head Charge does huge damage to most Pokemon, and with Reckless, its power is increased to an incredible level, scoring a large number of OHKOs with a Life Orb attached. Earthquake allows Bouffalant to hit the Rock- and Steel-types that resist Head Charge for super effective damage, while Wild Charge gets a boost from Reckless and allows Bouffalant to hit Tornadus and Jellicent for super effective damage. Protect gives Bouffalant's partner a turn to set up Trick Room or Tailwind, allowing it to bypass many of the Fighting-types that give it trouble. A Brave nature along with 252 HP EVs allow Bouffalant to hit as hard as possible while still retaining its decent bulk, even taking an unboosted Conkeldurr's Drain Punch, and to outspeed everything up to Scrafty under Trick Room.</p> <p>Rock Slide is a viable option over Earthquake; although Bouffalant loses the ability to hit Rock- and Steel-types for super effective damage, Rock Slide does hit the genies and Chandelure for super effective damage, and does not hit Bouffalant's partner. An EV spread of 140 HP / 252 Atk / 116 Spe with an Adamant nature should be used if Bouffalant is being used in Tailwind, to allow it to outspeed the genies under Tailwind, and still give it good bulk. Sap Sipper can also be a useful ability, due to the popularity of Amoonguss. Although Bouffalant loses the ability to abuse Reckless Head Charge, with Sap Sipper it can take a Spore aimed at it to increase its Attack by 1 stage, and OHKO most Amoonguss in return with a Life Orb Head Charge. A Chople Berry allows Bouffalant a turn to take out the many Fighting-types that can stop it in its tracks. If using Bouffalant in Tailwind, Tornadus is an excellent partner, KOing or doing severe damage to Fighting-types with Acrobatics, and setting up Tailwind to allow Bouffalant to sweep. A Psychic-type partner such as Musharna or Reuniclus is similarly useful for Trick Room teams, setting up Trick Room and KOing most Fighting-types with their STAB Psychic.</p> <p>Bouffalant fails to do significant damage to most Rock- and Steel-types. As such, a Fighting-type such as Conkeldurr or Scrafty can help tremendously, doing severe damage with their STAB Fighting-type moves, and working well in either Trick Room or Tailwind. Ghost-types are also a problem, as they are immune to Head Charge, so Chandelure makes an excellent partner, doing massive damage with its powerful STAB Shadow Ball while also being able to set up Trick Room for Bouffalant. Chandelure's STAB Fire-type moves also allow it to KO the Steel-types that would otherwise wall Bouffalant.</p>"

  "Braviary": {
    "overview": "<p>Braviary's excellent Attack stat, access to STAB Brave Bird, and Sheer Force ability, along with access to Whirlwind, gives him a niche in VGC 2011 as a powerful attacker that can also support the team. His respectable bulk and decent Speed allow him to pose a threat to many common Pokemon, while his STAB Brave Bird allows him to OHKO most Amoonguss and do huge damage to almost anything. Braviary's relatively low Speed means that he is easily outsped and KOed by many common Pokemon, but he can still pose a serious threat with the right support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Braviary has access to Tailwind, but is generally a poor user of it because of his subpar Speed and bulk. Mandibuzz, Tornadus, and Whimsicott are all better users of Tailwind due to their ability to set it up with priority or with vastly greater bulk. A Charti Berry can help Braviary take less damage from Rock Slide, but the extra power Life Orb provides is necessary for Braviary to do significant damage. Thrash is a very powerful STAB move, but hits a random opponent and as such is very unreliable when looking to deal damage to a specific Pokemon. Sky Drop is banned due to a gamebreaking glitch. Hone Claws, Work Up, and Bulk Up are options to boost Braviary's Attack, but with his weakness to Rock Slide and use in Tailwind teams, he's much more effective attacking straight off. Shadow Claw allows Braviary to deal good damage to many common Trick Room users, but a neutral Brave Bird outdamages a super effective Shadow Claw, making it useless. Rain Dance or Sunny Day can allow Braviary to support a weather team, but Whimsicott and Thundurus outclass it in this role due to their ability, Prankster, which allows them to set up the weather with priority. Keen Eye is an option in the unlikely case your opponent decides to lower accuracy, but is generally inferior to Sheer Force unless Braviary does not run a move boosted by Sheer Force.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Thundurus OHKOes Braviary with Thunderbolt before he can do anything, but if Braviary is under Tailwind, he will outspeed and KO Thundurus with Rock Slide. Many Rock Slide users outspeed Braviary and can do severe damage to him, but must watch out for Tailwind, which will allow Braviary to outspeed and smash them with Superpower. Opposing Amoonguss with a Coba Berry can easily take a Brave Bird and use Spore on Braviary to put him to sleep.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Brave Bird is an excellent STAB move, doing huge amounts of damage to a large number of common Pokemon, and allows Braviary to provide an excellent check to Amoonguss that lack a Coba Berry, easily OHKOing it. Rock Slide gives Braviary a way to hit Thundurus and Archeops for good damage, OHKOing both of them with boosts from Life Orb and Sheer Force. Superpower hits everything that resists Brave Bird and Rock Slide for huge amounts of damage, KOing or doing severe damage to most Rock- and Steel-types. The EVs grant the best overall bulk, allowing Braviary to almost always survive a Life Orb Terrakion's Rock Slide or Thundurus's Discharge, while allowing him to hit as hard as possible. Life Orb gives Braviary a boost to his attacks, while Sheer Force boosts the power of Rock Slide, making it an extremely powerful attack.</p> <p>Whirlwind allows Braviary to prevent Trick Room from being set up, even against opponents with Mental Herb, but the loss of Protect really hurts Braviary, with his relatively low Speed and weaknesses to Rock Slide and Discharge. A Flying Gem is a viable option over Life Orb, as it allows Braviary to get off a very powerful Brave Bird while avoiding recoil damage from Life Orb; however, the decrease in power after using the Flying Gem generally makes Life Orb the better item. A Jolly nature with an EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe is also an option, allowing Braviary to outspeed faster opponents, such as Krookodile and Excadrill, that do not use a boosting nature, but this significantly reduces his bulk and power. Braviary makes an excellent attacker for Tailwind teams thanks to his powerful STAB Brave Bird and his ability to stop Trick Room teams from setting up with Whirlwind. To this end, teammates such as Conkeldurr and Krookodile are recommended when not running Superpower to deal damage to the Rock- and Steel-types that resist Brave Bird and when running it to avoid having to deal with the Attack drop as often. Tornadus might find Braviary an especially useful partner, as his Rock Slide OHKOes Thundurus, a Pokemon with which Tornadus has significant trouble. Thundurus easily OHKOes Braviary with Thunderbolt before he can make a move under normal conditions, so a Tailwind user such as Tornadus or Whimsicott is useful Braviary to prevent this, as with Tailwind up, Braviary can outspeed and OHKO Thundurus with Rock Slide. A fast Amoonguss can also help, using Rage Powder to divert the Thunderbolt and taking advantage of Tailwind to outspeed and use Spore on the opposing team. Many Rock Slide users can outspeed and OHKO Braviary, so Thundurus with Grass Knot and Hidden Power Ice makes a good partner, KOing most Rock Slide users before they can attack.</p>"

  "Heatmor": {
    "overview": "<p>Heatmor is an interesting Pokemon, with a niche in both Trick Room and Tailwind teams. His base 105 Special Attack and 97 Attack stats make him a decent choice if you're looking to be original. Although he is largely outclassed by Chandelure, Heatmor has access to both physically and specially based moves and thus, Heatmor can serve as a great surprise factor against unprepared teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>If you're looking for someone worth some while on a sun team, Heatmor receives both Sunny Day and SolarBeam. Although there are much better members for sun teams, sometimes a Pokemon like Heatmor fits nicely. Another thing worth a mention is an all out Physical set. With its mainly physical movepool, Heatmor opens up some other options. Another thing to consider on the current set might be Focus Blast over Hidden Power Ice, but its 70% accuracy is a deterrent in the fast paced VGC metagame. Focus Sash might be something else to consider, if you're worried about getting KOed by the common Water Spout or Earthquake.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Most Pokemon that outspeed Heatmor can either check or counter it. Some of the common counters are Terrakion and Gigalith, and for the most part, any Rock-type. Samurott, Alomomola, and Darmanitan also take small amounts of damage from Heatmor's attacks and hit back harder. Common checks are also bulkier Jellicent and Hydreigon variants. For the most part, most commonly seen Pokemon in VGC 2011 will be able to beat Heatmor with very little issue.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>The best way to use Heatmor is to bring it in on the fairly common Heat Wave to receive a nice boost. It has decent enough stats to run a mixed set. Dark Gem Sucker Punch gives it the edge on the prevalent Ghost-types. Although it rarely packs the needed punch to KO many common threats, it certainly serves as a nice Pokemon to punch holes in the opposition for an easier time.</p> <p>Heat Wave allows for a powerful STAB move. Switching into a common Fire-type move from Chandelure gives a powerful boost that allows Heatmor to start shooting off its own boosted Heat Waves. It requires a bit of prediction and timing, but if executed correctly, Heatmor can become a big threat to unprepared teams. Should you choose to run Fire Gem, Heatmor can do massive damage to Pokemon that resist its moves. Heatmor's Heat Wave boosted with Fire Gem significantly damages the common Amoonguss to the point where it can be taken down by even a resisted move, making it useful for taking it down. Sucker Punch provides coverage against common Ghost-types, such as Chandelure, Jellicent, and Golurk. It often falls short in comparison to other methods of countering them, but it provides priority for an easy revenge kill. Hidden Power Ice allows for coverage against common dragons such as Hydreigon and Haxorus, who resist its Heat Wave. Protect is a key move to have in VGC, as it allows Heatmor to effectively scout for some of its opponent's moves and gain momentum in the battle.</p> <p>Although this set looks good on paper, in practice Heatmor often falls short. It has enough bulk to survive Archeops' STAB Rock Slide, but it cannot do serious damage back. Under Trick Room or Tailwind however, Heatmor is given a better chance to shine. Its Speed is nothing to write home about on its own, so if you're considering running Trick Room, Heatmor might be an interesting choice. With a Speed IV of 0 and a Quiet Nature, Heatmor reaches only 63 Speed, which makes it a strong candidate for Trick Room. When facing opposing Trick Room, Sucker Punch provides a good way to dent common Ghost- and Psychic-types in the metagame. On the other hand, it is also in an in-between stage, where it can benefit from Tailwind as well. With the set listed, Heatmor is able to outspeed many of its common counters, which allows it to be somewhat more useful. However, it still doesn't fit as strong a role as many of the other Pokemon available. Its weaknesses to the common Rock Slide, Earthquake, Surf, and Water Spout are also massive drawbacks of using Heatmor.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With base 109 Attack and Speed and a fabulous STAB in Bug, Durant has the potential to be a real force in the VGC 2011 metagame. Unfortunately, while Durant's typing is a blessing for its offensive prowess, it is a liability for its defensive capabilities. Bug / Steel leaves Durant 4x weak to Fire-type moves, which means Chandelure can OHKO it with ease. Despite this, when used properly, Durant can be a viable member of any VGC team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Durant can attempt to support its team with Thunder Wave, providing paralysis support to slow down the opposing team; however, a Pokemon with Prankster, such as Thundurus, is more suited for this job, as it gets +1 priority on Thunder Wave. Stone Edge has a higher Base Power than Rock Slide, but with its infamous 80% accuracy and inability to hit more than one foe, it is generally inferior to Rock Slide. However, Stone Edge does give Durant the ability to OHKO Tornadus and Thundurus. A set revolving around Substitute and Hone Claws could be viable, allowing Durant to get to +1 Attack and Accuracy, which along with Hustle would prove for some powerful attacks; however, it is very hard to successfully boost in the VGC 2011 metagame, so this is generally discouraged. Durant could hold a Choice Band to power up its attacks even further, but Hustle allows you to have an Attack boost and still change moves, in addition to holding another item, such as a Focus Sash.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Chandelure and Volcarona OHKO Durant with their powerful STAB Heat Wave, though Volcarona must use a Charti Berry or Focus Sash to avoid being OHKOed itself. Strong special-based moves such as Jellicent's Water Gem Water Spout take advantage of Durant's abysmal base 48 Special Defense, easily OHKOing it. With Cofagrigus's massive Defense, it can easily take a STAB Iron Head and respond with Will-O-Wisp, neutering Durant.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Iron Head gives Durant a reliable STAB attack and also has a 30% flinch rate. Durant's base 109 Speed allows it to make good use of the flinch chance, as it just outspeeds the musketeer trio of Terrakion, Virizion, and Cobalion. Rock Slide allows Durant to 2HKO Chandelure, while X-Scissor dents bulky Psychic-type Trick Room users, such as Reuniclus and Musharna, while also OHKOing some offensive Pokemon that are weak to Bug-type attacks such as Hydreigon. Protect allows Durant to shield itself from damage for a turn, possibly allowing Durant's partner to eliminate a threat. Crunch is also a good option, however, to deal heavy damage to Jellicent that try to get off a powerful Water Spout, in addition to hitting Cofagrigus, one of the few Trick Room users not covered by the rest of this set.</p> <p>With 58 / 112 / 48 defenses, Durant needs a Focus Sash to prevent most special attacks from OHKOing it, although Durant can use a Life Orb instead for an extra power boost. With a Life Orb and Hustle, Durant is able to OHKO 252/0 Reuniclus and has a chance to OHKO max Defense Musharna. A Jolly nature allows Durant to outpace Terrakion and hit it with a STAB super effective Iron Head, which is one of the main reasons for using Durant. Swarm boosts Durant's Bug-type moves whenever its health drops below 33%, which, in conjunction with a Focus Sash, allows for a very powerful final X-Scissor. On the other hand, Hustle allows Durant to always OHKO Terrakion with Iron Head and gives Durant more power overall; unfortunately, this comes with a loss of accuracy on all of Durant's moves. With Durant's poor defenses, there is no point in investing in bulk, allowing EVs to be fully invested in Attack and Speed.</p> <p>Wide Guard users such as Mienshao and Conkeldurr are great teammates for Durant, as they allow it to outspeed and 2HKO Chandelure without getting destroyed by Heat Wave. Wide Guard also helps Durant damage Choice Scarf Jellicent, which would otherwise dent Durant and its teammates. Pairing Durant with Terrakion creates a lethal Iron Head / Rock Slide combo, increasing the chance of flinch while dealing a lot of damage.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With a Choice Scarf, Durant is able to function as an effective counter for other Choice Scarf Pokemon, as well as outspeed Tornadus and Thundurus, which otherwise hit Durant hard with their STAB moves. Crunch smacks Jellicent, making it unable to unleash a full-power Water Spout and crippling it for the remainder of the match. Rock Slide hits Tornadus and Thundurus hard, in addition to having a high flinch rate. X-Scissor OHKOes Hydreigon and gives Durant a strong STAB move, while Iron Head is Durant's only way to hit Terrakion and can cause a flinch too. With a Choice Scarf, Durant is already outspeeding most of the metagame, so an Adamant nature is used.</p> <p>Hustle gives all of Durant's moves the equivalent of a Choice Band boost at the cost of 20% accuracy. If the lower accuracy is a problem for you, Swarm is a decent replacement, although Durant will not often take an attack and live with under 33% health. With Durant's terrible defenses, you should simply invest all you can into Attack and Speed. You can use a Jolly nature if you fear Choice Scarf Terrakion, but the drop in power is so significant that this is rarely a good idea.</p> <p>Wide Guard support is greatly appreciated, as it allows Durant to eliminate Chandelure, Jellicent, and Terrakion, respectively, in two turns. Musharna can provide Durant with Helping Hand support, allowing Durant to OHKO Jellicent and Chandelure with Crunch, and Terrakion with Iron Head.</p>"

Defensively, it isn't too much of a slouch either, with 92 / 90 / 90 defenses, allowing it to take powerful attacks without Focus Sash. Unfortunately, its Speed leaves a lot to be desired, as it leaves Hydreigon outsped by a large portion of the metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>In terms of other notable coverage attacks, Hydreigon doesn't really have anything else of note, but it does have several other support options at its disposal, namely Thunder Wave, Dragon Tail, and Reflect. Dragon Tail is mainly useful for stopping Trick Room. Hydreigon has a competent base Attack stat that could be used to run a mixed set, but there really aren't enough Pokemon with lopsided defenses to warrant the overall drop in power. One advantage of a mixed set, however, is the ability to run Draco Meteor without worrying about the Special Attack drop since Hydreigon will be able to fall back on its physical attacks.</p> <p>As far as items are concerned, there are a lot of noteworthy alternatives. Hydreigon can use Dragon Jewel to have a one time boost to its Dragon-type move of choice, but if Hydreigon attacks even twice, the boost from Life Orb will have been more beneficial. Life Orb's ability to boost the power of all of Hydreigon's formidable attacks is also important to consider. If you really want to assure Hydreigon can take a hit, Focus Sash is certainly an option, but usually, Hydreigon's bulk will be sufficient. Finally, if you want to run Draco Meteor without worrying about the Special Attack drop, Hydreigon can run White Herb to negate Draco Meteor's effect the first time.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Defensively, very few Pokemon can truly counter Hydreigon because of its great coverage and sheer power, especially since almost all of the most bulky Pokemon are weak to Dark-type attacks. However, Hydreigon's middling Speed and Dark typing leaves it vulnerable to being defeated outright by many faster enemies. Volcarona outspeeds Hydreigon and can OHKO with Bug Buzz. Among Fighting-types, Terrakion, Virizion, Cobalion, and Mienshao can outspeed Hydreigon and OHKO it. Conkeldurr can deal serious damage to Hydreigon with Mach Punch, or OHKO it with Hammer Arm, without incurring too much damage to itself. The last Fighting-type worth mentioning is Scrafty, which can easily 2HKO with Drain Punch, while not being 2HKOed itself with the healing from Drain Punch factored in.</p>",

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Dragon Pulse gives Hydreigon a solid STAB attack that only a few Pokemon resist, all of which are hit for super effective damage by Hydreigon's Fire-type move of choice. If you aren't concerned about Hydreigon's capability to maintain a continued long-term offensive, Draco Meteor is also an option for a much more powerful initial hit. Dark Pulse is there for a secondary STAB attack. While it provides no extra neutral coverage, it does allow Hydreigon to hit Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Reuniclus, Beheeyem, Cofagrigus, and Musharna much harder. Dark Pulse also comes with a 20% chance to flinch the opponent, which can be game changing in some situations like potentially stopping Trick Room set up. The choice between Flamethrower or Fire Blast is the classic dilemma of accuracy versus power, and depends on your personal preference. It's worth noting, however, that Fire Blast assures a 2HKO on Amoonguss even when using a Timid nature, while Flamethrower never 2HKOes if it invests enough EVs in Special Defense and HP. Whichever Fire-type attack Hydreigon has, it will help it with the few Steel-types present in 2011 play, and scores super effective hits on the numerous Grass- and Bug-type Pokemon.</p> <p>The choice of the final move really comes down to what type of team Hydreigon is playing in. If you really want to try and stop set up, Hydreigon can run Taunt and attempt to keep Trick Room, Tailwind, or rain from being set up, but it won't have any effect on the Prankster Tailwinds coming from Whimsicott and Tornadus. Remember, however, that Mental Herb now cures Taunt, and so Taunt is not a completely reliable way to stop Pokemon from setting up. If you are pairing Hydreigon with a Water Absorb user such as Jellicent, Surf can be a very valuable attack for extra coverage against sand teams. It is also useful as a spread attack that can finish off a weakened enemy while still dealing damage to its partner. It also allows Hydreigon to heal your Jellicent, possibly powering up its Water Spout. Finally, if your team doesn't fit either description above, Protect can be run as as consistently useful move.</p> <p>The choice of item really boils down to how afraid of Conkeldurr you are. Keep in mind, however, that even Guts-boosted Mach Punch from Conkeldurr with an Attack-boosting nature and 252 Atk Evs does a maximum of 94% to Hydreigon without Chople Berry, and Hammer Arm from the same Conkeldurr will OHKO Hydreigon through Chople Berry 87% of the time, even with no prior damage. These decisive outcomes puts the usefulness of Chople Berry in question.</p> <p>Hydreigon makes a good partner for Jellicent, forming the famed \"SazaJelly\" combo. They complement each other well offensively, and have great synergy, considering Hydreigon's ability to give Jellicent back 25% of its health each turn with Surf. Jellicent is also a deterrent to Trick Room by being slow and bulky, while also being able to set up Trick Room if the opposing team tries to use Sand Rush, Tailwind, or Swift Swim to gain the Speed advantage over Hydreigon.</p> <p>Hydreigon actually works very well as a lead on Trick Room teams, however, firing off powerful hits before Trick Room goes up. Because of Hydreigon's middling Speed, it can outpace opposing Trick Room teams with ease, and deal heavy damage to the Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon which set up Trick Room, while also undercutting most frail offensive Pokemon even if they haven't boosted their Speed with a field effect. The ability to deal with both fast teams and dedicated Trick Room teams gives Hydreigon terrific synergy with Jellicent. Finally, Hydreigon also has the obvious immunity to Ground-type attacks, making it a viable partner for an Earthquake user other than Haxorus, whose ability Mold Breaker would allow Earthquake to hit Hydreigon.</p>"

With an EV spread of 68 HP / 188 Def / 252 Spe and a Jolly Nature, Cobalion always lives Terrakion's Close Combat or Conkeldurr's Drain Punch, and can KO Terrakion back with Close Combat, or set up Reflect or use Thunder Wave. However, a more potent option is a Choice Band set. With strong attacks boosted by the Choice Band and good coverage, Cobalion can hit like a truck. However, this leaves it more open to some of the resisters of its dual STAB moves, most notably bulky Ghost-types. With help in eliminating these and proper use of Team Preview, however, Choice Band Cobalion can work excellently. There is also a special side to its attacks, which features Focus Blast and Flash Cannon, as well as Calm Mind. These moves can provide another option to beat more defensively based Pokemon. Chople or Occa Berry are also viable options, as they allow Cobalion to live many of the prevalent Fighting and Fire-type attacks. Swords Dance can also be used for a nice Attack boost, if you find the time to set it up.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Cobalion's typing unfortunately proves to be something of a double-edged sword. With Steel and Fighting-type STABs, Cobalion gains great coverage on the majority of the VGC 2011 metagame. However, it also leaves him weak to many of the prevalent moves as well. Landorus and Jellicent are notable counters, as both resist its most powerful moves and can dish back damage. Hydreigon is a notable check, being able to KO with Flamethrower, and live a Close Combat launched by Cobalion. Amoonguss is also a very notable counter, leaving Cobalion open to becoming Spore bait. Overall, if played correctly, Cobalion can be a very strong Pokemon, but it is hard to dispatch some of its common counters without sacrifice.</p>",

In the fast-paced metagame of VGC 2011, where every move counts, it may not always be in your best interest to run it. However, if you're feeling bold, Cobalion is a nice high risk, high reward Pokemon.</p> <p>Cobalion has a fairly decent movepool that beats a lot of VGC Pokemon. Stone Edge makes both Thundurus and Tornadus worry, but its accuracy can be a pain at times. Close Combat is for those who like power, and is the preferred move because hitting hard is important in VGC. However, Sacred Sword is a totally viable option, and it gets a nice boost from Fighting Gem. Iron Head provides another STAB move, and it gives coverage against Pokemon who resist Rock- and Fighting-type moves.</p> <p>Cobalion's bulk is helpful for taking many of the attacks that come its way in the doubles environment. Although it isn't the strongest Pokemon out there, if played right it can be extremely deadly. With a Fighting Gem boost, Cobalion does tons of damage to even those who resist it. Close Combat with a Fighting Gem boost is insanely powerful. However, the drops in Defense and Special Defense can be a major drawback. If you're one of those players who doesn't like to switch around very much, it may be in your best interest to run Sacred Sword. You miss out on a lot of the sheer power, but in return, Cobalion stays around to take a few more hits.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is preferred, as it brings Cobalion up to 176 Speed, enough to outspeed Timid Hydreigon. However, an Adamant nature allows Cobalion to hit harder and gain KOs it would lose out on with a Jolly nature. With a Jolly nature and Fighting Gem, Cobalion outspeeds and OHKOs non-Chople Berry Hydreigon and other frail Pokemon. Another important thing to note is that if you're looking for someone to handle Bisharp on your team, Cobalion is your Pokemon. With its high defenses, Cobalion shrugs off Bisharp's strongest STAB attacks, and can beat it back with its powerful STAB Fighting moves.</p>"

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sacred Sword is an option here if the drop to Terrakion's defenses each time it uses Close Combat is worrisome. Sacred Sword also ignores defensive boosts, so Pokemon setting up with Bulk Up will take the full force of the blow. Generally, Close Combat is preferred because of its much superior power. Stone Edge could always be used over Rock Slide, but it misses more frequently and only hits one foe. If Conkeldurr is specifically a major concern Chople Berry can be used. X-Scissor is an option to deal super effective damage to Psychic-types such as Reuniclus, but it won't usually OHKO, and Terrakion will get OHKOed by Psychic in return. Safeguard could be useful when Terrakion is a lead, keeping Amoonguss and its 100% accurate Spore at bay. Helping Hand, while somewhat of a novelty on Terrakion, lets Terrakion boost its partner's attack.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Jellicent stops Terrakion in its tracks, as, without a boost, Terrakion is unable to hurt it significantly with Rock Slide. Golurk resists both of Terrakion's STAB attacks, and can hit back hard with STAB Earthquake. Strong Fighting-type Pokemon such as Conkeldurr and Chople Berry Scrafty can take a hit and KO back. Anything with Earthquake that can outspeed Terrakion can usually take it down. If Trick Room is in effect, Musharna or Reuniclus can outspeed Terrakion and OHKO with STAB Psychic. Terrakion can't hurt Amoonguss, while Amoonguss can take a Rock Slide, put Terrakion to sleep with Spore, and then follow up with Giga Drain.</p>",

Close Combat and Rock Slide are Terrakion's dual STAB attacks, which are only resisted by Golurk in VGC 2011. Quick Attack finishes off weakened foes. Protect can be used to stall out Trick Room or avoid taking an attack while Terrakion's partner attacks and KOes a threat. Quick Guard stops priority attacks such as Fake Out and Mach Punch, which can help Terrakion stay alive and allow a partner to set up Tailwind or boost Terrakion's attack with Beat Up. Safeguard blocks Spore from one of the most common Pokemon in the metagame, Amoonguss.</p> <p>Focus Sash is generally the preferred item to help Terrakion avoid getting OHKOed by one of Terrakion's many weaknesses, but Life Orb provides the power to muscle through the opponent. The choice of nature is one between power and Speed, but an Adamant nature should only be used if you have Tailwind support to compensate for the lower Speed. The EV spread is fairly straightforward, focusing on getting as much power and Speed as possible, while 4 Defense EVs allow Terrakion to always survive Tornadus's Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics.</p> <p>Anything that can set up Tailwind is a boon to Terrakion, making Pokemon such as Whimsicott and Tornadus good teammates. Whimsicott can also be used with a Choice Scarf for a Beat Up combo, raising Terrakion's Attack up to four stages in one turn and making it deadly in an instant. Hydreigon, Landorus, and Thundurus are also good candidates to partner with Terrakion, allowing it to unleash powerful Earthquakes without the fear of hurting its partner. Musharna is good for taking down other Fighting-types and removing Trick Room if it gets set up. Musharna can also boost Terrakion's moves with Helping Hand.</p>"

On many teams, Terrakion would need a Choice Scarf, as it has no other way of boosting its Speed (outside of Rock Polish, but that's generally not recommended in VGC). An Adamant nature should be used with Choice Scarf. However, if you have Tailwind support, a Choice Band and an Adamant nature are appropriate. A Jolly nature should only be used if you are concerned about Speed tying with other Terrakion.

A bulkier spread of 252 HP / 76 Def / 180 Spe (72 Def / 184 Spe if using Hidden Power Rock) with a Careful or Calm nature increases Virizion's lifespan while outspeeding Modest Hydreigon. Dual Screens could work quite well with this more defensively oriented set. Sacred Sword has less Base Power, but it hits through the Defense boosts of (albeit rare) Bulk Up Pokemon. This is a much better option for a defensive set, as it does not lower Virizion's defenses, a severe drawback to using Close Combat.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Archeops OHKOes Virizion with Acrobatics.

These two moves are the strongest of Virizion's STAB options, and the Fighting Gem powers up Close Combat to compensate for Virizion's middling base 90 Attack. Close Combat and Leaf Blade do not have the best coverage, but they hit certain threats hard enough. For example, Jellicent's Water Spout does next to nothing after it takes a hit from Leaf Blade. Light Screen helps out against the numerous special attackers in VGC, and increases Virizion's ability to handle Discharge, Surf, and Water Spout. Safeguard stops Amoonguss cold, a great asset when considering Amoonguss's resistances to Virizion's STAB attacks.</p> <p>Stone Edge can replace either attacking move, but has imperfect accuracy and only hits one target. It does get better coverage, though. Fighting Gem works well against Scrafty, Conkeldurr, Hydreigon, and other bulky Pokemon. Without the boost from the Fighting Gem, these Pokemon might not be KOed. However, Lum Berry should be held if Virizion does not have Safeguard. Another option here is Fast Guard, which can stop Sucker Punch, Fake Out, and Mach Punch. Its a valuable move, considering that many of Virizion's ideal partners are hit for super effective damage by these priority moves. Helping Hand is another viable move, since Virizion can survive long enough to boost a teammate's move a few times.</p> <p>Hydreigon is an excellent choice for a partner, as it resists Heat Wave and threatens most of Virizion's checks. Jellicent also does this job, but more on the defensive side. Any Pokemon that can finish off or weaken bulkier Pokemon also works well. Frail Pokemon can make good use of Light Screen in order to survive an extra turn.</p>"

Grass Knot hits Jellicent hard, and generally anything that resists Focus Blast. Chandelure, Thundurus, Tornadus, and many other threats that resist Virizion's STAB attacks are hit hard by Hidden Power Rock.

Bulkier Jellicent and Chandelure may not be OHKOed all of the time, especially when using a Timid nature without a Life Orb. Hidden Power Ice may be used over Hidden Power Rock. Using Hidden Power Ice, Virizion would be able to have a 31 IV in Speed. Hidden Power Ice also hits many of the same targets as Hidden Power Rock does.

Taunt stops other Tornadus from setting up Tailwind, and can shut down Whimsicott and Pokemon that set up Trick Room. Protect stalls out Trick Room and protects Tornadus while its partner takes out a threat. Substitute can be used, however, to stall out Trick Room for more than one turn since it can be used consecutively. Hammer Arm hits Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon for super effective damage, and if Trick Room goes up, it can bring down Tornadus's Speed, and make it \"faster\".</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Tornadus's Attack and Speed to hit as hard as possible.

Mienshao also provides Wide Guard support, stopping Pokemon such as Terrakion from hitting Tornadus with Rock Slide. Haxorus benefits immensely from Tailwind, allowing it to outspeed threats such as Hydreigon and utilize its base 147 Attack stat to tear through the opponent.

Substitute can keep Tornadus alive longer so it can keep firing off STAB Hurricanes, but Protect can be useful if it gets double-targeted. Because Seismitoad is the only Swift Swim Pokemon in VGC 2011, Rain Dance teams can struggle to outspeed and utilize their powerful Water-type attacks. Tailwind can be used to remedy this problem, though you will be unable to stop opposing Whimsicott from setting up their own Tailwind.</p> <p>Damp Rock keeps Rain Dance up for 8 turns, but is not absolutely necessary, as VGC battles often last 5 turns or less. If you choose not to run Damp Rock, Focus Sash allows Tornadus to stay alive an additional turn and get off one more Hurricane. If Focus Sash is used, however, Substitute should not be used because the Focus Sash will be negated by the use of Substitute. The EV spread allows Tornadus to hit as hard and as fast as it can. The choice of nature is one between power and speed. If Tornadus uses a Modest nature, it runs the risk of being outsped by opposing Tornadus and getting Taunted.</p> <p>Thundurus partners well with this set, as it can fire off a 100% accurate STAB Thunder under rain. Fake Out support, though not needed, is helpful in setting up rain. Amoonguss would make a good partner, as it can use Rage Powder to let Tornadus set up Rain Dance, use Substitute, and start using Hurricane in complete safety.

Hidden Power Ice hits Ground-types such as Landorus, but Hidden Power Flying gives Thundurus another STAB, and Electric / Flying is resisted by only a handful of Pokemon in VGC 2011.

However, it will also damage Landorus’s partner if they aren’t immune to it. Rock Slide is another great choice for Landorus, as it covers the Flying-types who are immune to Earthquake, as well as having spread damage and a chance to flinch. Explosion may have been nerfed in the 5th generation, but when used in conjunction with Normal Gem and Landorus’s high Attack stat, it can still be a powerful field clearing move.

The choice between Yache Berry and Life Orb is one of safety vs. power, and the choice is heavily dependent on what kind of team Landorus is used on. Focus Blast can be run in the third slot in order to deal with Scrafty, who commonly carry Ice Punch, as well as Hydreigon, but its unreliable accuracy makes it undesirable.</p>"}
