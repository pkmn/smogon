  "Charizard": {
    "overview": "<p>Even in previous generations, Charizard was known as a very threatening Pokemon. Charizard is very versatile with balanced offenses, a large movepool, and great Speed, which all allow it to run a vast variety of sets. For that reason, Charizard is mostly seen on offensive teams, including but not limited to sun teams where its Fire-type attacks are much more powerful. Its 4x weakness to Stealth Rock can hinder its ability to sweep, but it can also work to Charizard's advantage, bringing it into Blaze range quickly. With such great power and versatility, it's safe to say that Charizard is the strongest Fire-type Pokemon in NU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>One of Charizard's most interesting alternative options is Belly Drum. It's a great way to maximize Charizard's power, but it leaves Charizard vulnerable to being revenge killed, and it doesn't have many opportunities to set it up safely. Charizard could also be self dependent with setting up Sunny Day instead of relying on a partner, but it wouldn't want to waste a precious moveslot for it. Dragon Dance is an excellent way to boost its Speed and Attack, but since Acrobatics—one of Charizard's best physical moves—is illegal with Dragon Dance, Swords Dance is the preferred option. Flame Charge is another way to boost Charizard's Speed, but it is a weak STAB option.</p> <p>Heat Wave is a combination of good power and accuracy; however, it is not that much stronger than Flamethrower and has 10% less accuracy than it, making Flamethrower the superior STAB choice of the two. Hone Claws can help with accuracy problems as well as boosting Charizard's Attack; however, most of Charizard's inaccurate moves are special attacks, and Hone Claws boosts physical attacks, making it unnecessary. Toxic and Will-O-Wisp can allow Charizard to support its team, but it doesn't have the moveslots to fit them in. Finally, Charizard has some subpar attacking options, such as Shadow Claw, Rock Slide, and Brick Break, to consider in terms of additional coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>It is difficult to outright counter Charizard due to the variety of sets it can run and its great coverage. Utilizing Stealth Rock is one of the most effective ways to weaken Charizard, so Pokemon who can successfully lay Stealth Rock on the field, such as Regirock and Golem, are good ways to weaken it. In fact, Rock-types in general are your best bet against Charizard, specifically ones who can take a Hidden Power Grass or Focus Blast. Carracosta, Regirock, and Golem are all great in dealing with Charizard. Carracosta can switch easily in Charizard's dual STABs and threaten it with Aqua Jet or potentially set up a Shell Smash. Regirock can tank any hit from Charizard and it back with either Rock Slide or Stone Edge. Golem can switch into Charizard's dual STABs, but struggles against non-Choice sets that can take a Sucker Punch and OHKO back with either Hidden Power Grass or Focus Blast. Due to their naturally good Defense, all three of them are capable of taking on Swords Dance variants of Charizard without having much to fear.</p> <p>There are many Pokemon that can only defeat a specific variant of Charizard. Mantine, Flareon, Zweilous, and Dragonair can easily take on any specially offensive set Charizard has with their respective properties, but they all can be easily defeated by the Swords Dance set. Choice Scarf Pokemon have a chance of outspeeding and KOing Charizard, granted it doesn't hold a Choice Scarf itself; Rotom-S and Primeape are examples of such. While it can't take many of Charizard's attacks, Floatzel can outspeed Charizard and attack it with its Water-type moves. In contrast, Samurott cannot outspeed Charizard, but it can tank a hit and OHKO with its Water-type attacks or even go for the priority Aqua Jet. Specially defensive Wartortle can tank any of Charizard's sets bar Swords Dance and use Scald against it. Alomomola can be used as a good pivot against Charizard, taking any hit and switching out to the appropriate Pokemon while recovering HP with Regenerator. If Alomomola happens to switch into a Swords Dance or Choice variant, it can take the opportunity to cripple Charizard with Toxic or set up a Wish as well.</p> <p>There are also other ways to make it easier to defeat Charizard. Using a rain team against it is an excellent way to weaken its Fire-type moves, and Swift Swim users, such as Ludicolo, Gorebyss, and Armaldo, can then outspeed and KO Charizard with their boosted Water-type attacks. Inflicting status on Charizard is another good way to cripple it; Miltank can outspeed and paralyze a non-Choice Scarf Charizard while Alomomola, who struggles against the specially offensive sets, can take on the Swords Dance set to land a Toxic. Using Liepard to inflict parafusion on Charizard can be risky, but it's highly effective. Finally, it's especially annoying for Charizard to go against priority users due to its Stealth Rock weakness. Kangaskhan is a good example of such, as it can check it with Fake Out and Sucker Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>This set truly displays Charizard's raw power, wallbreaking through teams quite easily. Even specially defensive Pokemon, such as Lickilicky and Regice, take severe damage from Charizard's attacks. Fire Blast is Charizard's main STAB move, as it has enough power to defeat specially defensive behemoths such as Probopass. Air Slash is Charizard's secondary STAB, and it hits Pokemon immune to Fire-type attacks, specifically Flash Fire Flareon and Rapidash. Hidden Power Grass offers good coverage against the Water- and Rock-types that resist its Fire STAB. Lastly, Flamethrower cleans up weakened teams well, especially if accuracy is a dire need over power.</p> <p>Blaze is superior to Solar Power on this set, as sun isn't truly needed to power up Charizard. Overheat is a very powerful alternative Fire-type move, but its Special Attack drop is undesirable, and it doesn't have much of a larger damage output than Fire Blast. Focus Blast can be used for additional coverage, but because of this set's sheer power, it is no longer needed, as all of Charizard's attacks can defeat its main threats without the aid of Focus Blast.</p> <p>Rapid Spin support is always going to be useful with Charizard, especially when it wants to be on the field for as long as possible to inflict massive damage to the adversary. Wartortle is one of the best spinners to use with Charizard due to its ability to tank Water- and Rock-type attacks well. Mold Breaker Sawk can stop Stealth Rock from being set up through offensive pressure for Charizard. While Charizard has enough strength to not rely on sun support, having it would be great to further boost Charizard's Fire-type attacks; Volbeat and Regirock are good partners for that role. Finally, Charizard's main objective is to weaken the opposition for its allies, so teammates that can sweep up the weakened team are good to have. Sawsbuck and Exeggutor are options for that role if sun support is offered, and Dragonair and Klang work well with Charizard outside of the sun, as they can cover the other's threats well.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Charizard already rests at a great Speed tier, but when it's holding a Choice Scarf, it transforms into an excellent revenge killer. It's a great choice when a player is in need of a Pokemon that can clean up weakened teams. Charizard doesn't need to rely on sun support for this set, as it can function solely without it. Fire Blast and Flamethrower are both Fire-type move options; the former is mostly for revenge killing threats while the latter is for cleaning up the weakened adversary. Focus Blast is a great coverage move to KO Pokemon Charizard cannot dent with its other moves, such as Regirock, Golem, Probopass, and Lickilicky. The final moveslot is a filler option based on what threat you wish to cover. Air Slash allows Charizard to check Modest Ludicolo in the rain, as it hits Ludicolo harder than Fire Blast. On the other hand, Hidden Power Grass allows Charizard to dent Seismitoad.</p> <p>Choice Scarf allows Charizard to outspeed the majority of the tier. With Blaze, Charizard can use Stealth Rock to its advantage; after switching into Stealth Rock twice, Charizard can activate Blaze, which powers up its Fire-type moves. Tailwind can be used in the final moveslot to give its teammates extra Speed if Charizard isn't capable of finishing off the opposing team. Solar Power and Solar Beam can also be used if Charizard were to be used on a sun team.</p> <p>While Rapid Spin support isn't necessary, Charizard will be switching in and out often due to being locked into a move, so having spinners would be useful. Once again, Wartortle is the best choice of spinner for Charizard. Offensive pressure could be used as well if you'd rather avoid using a spinner; Pokemon such as Mold Breaker Sawk and Samurott are good options in that department. Charizard also appreciates having a partner or two that could heal it from status conditions or recover its lost HP with Wish. Alomomola, Lickilicky, and Miltank, who can all use their formidable bulk to take attacks Charizard cannot take, are great partners for that role. Because Charizard would usually be used on offensive teams, having partners who could weaken the opposition beforehand, such as Samurott and Eelektross, are recommended. Finally, entry hazard support can come in handy for Charizard, as it can score many more OHKOs with entry hazards on the field. One example would be Regice, as it can be OHKOed with Fire Blast after Stealth Rock damage. Garbodor and Carracosta are good choices for entry hazard setters.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>While Charizard is usually seen ravaging opponents with its Special Attack, Swords Dance allows Charizard to take full advantage of its Attack stat. Swords Dance is the center point of the set, as it raises Charizard's attacks to astounishing heights. After a Swords Dance, Charizard has the power to 2HKO Alomomola and OHKO Lickilicky, Regice, and Tangela with its STAB Acrobatics, which has increased power on the first hit thanks to the Flying Gem boost and still a high 110 BP after it is consumed. Earthquake provides great coverage alongside Acrobatics, and Roost allows Charizard to heal itself whenever it seizes the opportunity.</p> <p>Blaze is Charizard's only viable ability, as Charizard has no need to rely on sun support with this set. A Fire-type move such as Flare Blitz or Fire Punch is optional in the final moveslot if you crave another STAB. However, it doesn't offer much besides hitting Eelektross harder, as Acrobatics and Earthquake already wields near-perfect coverage together. Thunder Punch is a good option to dish out more damage to Water-type Pokemon, but Acrobatics already does a large amount to most of them, bar Carracosta.</p> <p>Rapid Spin support is always helpful for Charizard to grant it more switch in opportunities, so a spinner such as Wartortle is a great partner. Mold Breaker Sawk can also stop Stealth Rock from being up through offensive pressure. Regirock can easily defeat Charizard, even when it has a Swords Dance boost. Gurdurr and Samurott are examples of Pokemon that can KO Regirock so Charizard can continue sweeping the opposing team. Status conditions can cripple it, so Heal Bell support from Pokemon such as Lickilicky and Misdreavus are recommended. Entry hazard support helps weaken the opponent to make it easier for Charizard to sweep, so entry hazard setters, such as Carracosta and Garbodor, are great partners.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Charizard's high Special Attack and Speed allow it to function as an exceptional sweeper. Its strong STAB moves and good coverage are highlighted in this set. Charizard is a great addition to many teams that struggle against physical walls such as Tangela and Weezing. Fire Blast is one of Charizard's powerful STAB moves, and it guarantees an OHKO against Eviolite Roselia and Braviary. Air Slash is its secondary STAB option; while Fire- and Flying-type moves overlap in type coverage, Air Slash is great against Fire-immune Pokemon and Water-types. Hidden Power Grass offers even more coverage to Water- and Rock-type Pokemon. It specifically hits Seismitoad hard, OHKOing all common variants of it. However, Substitute can be used to avoid status conditions that would otherwise cripple Charizard. Roost is the final move of the set; it enables Charizard to heal itself if it switches into Stealth Rock, as well as allowing it to maintain longevity on the field.</p> <p>Life Orb gives additional power to Charizard's attacks. Blaze is the best choice of ability for this set, as Charizard can OHKO a 176 HP / 0 SpD Golurk with Fire Blast when it is activated. However, if Charizard is used on a sun team, Solar Power can replace Blaze to strengthen its attacks. Solar Beam could also be used in such a scenario, replacing Hidden Power Grass. Leftovers can be used in lieu of Life Orb for consistent healing. Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast if accuracy is preferred over power. Finally, Focus Blast can be used in the third moveslot to hit Normal- and Rock-types harder, but it's an unreliable choice due to its lackluster accuracy. Tailwind can also considered over Roost, making priority the only way to outspeed Charizard.</p> <p>Rapid Spin support is recommended, as Charizard would be easy to defeat if it comes in with Stealth Rock on the field. Wartortle is a prime spinner for Charizard, as it can also help against Regirock. Mold Breaker Sawk is a great partner for Charizard as well, as it can stop Stealth Rock from being set up through offensive pressure. Another option that isn't required is running Sunny Day support for Charizard, as it appreciates a Fire-type attack boost; Volbeat and Regirock are good choices for this. If Sunny Day support is used, sun sweepers, such as Sawsbuck, Exeggutor, and Rapidash, are recommended as Charizard's partners. Even with Charizard's immense strength, having entry hazards on the field can turn several 2HKOs into OHKOs. Kangaskhan and Miltank (without Thick Fat) are two examples of Pokemon that could be OHKOed by Charizard after being weakened by Stealth Rock and Spikes. Regirock and Garbodor are great partners in laying these entry hazards.</p> <p>As for more specific partners, Roselia and Tangela are great to use alongside Charizard, as they can handle Water- and Rock-type Pokemon it has difficulty against, specifically Alomomola, Samurott, and Carracosta. Mantine in particular can take anything Charizard can throw at it and retaliate back with its Water-type attacks. Electric-types, such as Rotom-S, are good allies that can get rid of Mantine. If Substitute isn't used in the third moveslot, Charizard is prone to status conditions, especially paralysis. Misdreavus and Miltank, both of which can weaken the adversary with status moves of their own, can heal Charizard of status with Heal Bell.</p>"

  "Wartortle": {
    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written around the time that BW was considered the main generation. The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW NU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>Wartortle has access to the rare Rapid Spin and is arguably the best user of the move in NU, as Foresight allows it to spin even against Ghost-types. It has decent bulk allowing it to tank a few hits and is extremely useful on stall teams that need a spinner. However, Wartortle hardly finds use on offensive teams, as it slows the team down. Plus, offensive teams rarely see the need for a spinner. Furthermore, Wartortle's lack of recovery leaves it prone to being worn down and vulnerable to Toxic, meaning some team support is needed to allow it to shine.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Refresh can be used to heal Wartortle of Toxic status, but generally it is better to throw in cleric support. Mirror Coat and Counter can be used to surprise attackers if you can live a hit, although this is rather prediction-heavy. Additionally because Wartortle has much greater defenses with Eviolite than it does HP, the damage output from these moves will often be low. Surf is an option to use over Scald if you do not want Scald's burn chance to interfere with Toxic but want to keep the ability to hit the likes of Golem and Golurk hard. Rest can be used as it is Wartortle's only form of recovery, but Wartortle will be complete setup fodder while it tries to wake up. Rain Dance can be used if Wartortle is acting as a spinner for a rain team, but keep in mind that Wartortle can neither utilize Damp Rock due to its need for an Eviolite nor use Rain Dish with Foresight. Ice Beam allows Wartortle to break the Substitutes of Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary, which Seismic Toss fails to do, but it is generally too weak and Haze deals with this threat already. An offensive spinner set can be used with a set of Hydro Pump, Rapid Spin, Ice Beam, and either Toxic or Hidden Power Grass, but this is usually done better by Torkoal. Besides, Foresight and Rapid Spin should really be the reason to use Wartortle anyway, and it cannot beat Ghost-types as reliably without Foresight.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As Rapid Spin is Wartortle's main use, preventing it from spinning is one way of countering it. Misdreavus can use Taunt to prevent it from using Foresight, and offensive variants can subsequently obliterate it with Thunderbolt or set up Nasty Plot on it. However, Misdreavus can't prevent a Rapid Spin if it is hit by Foresight on the switch. Shedinja is a niche Pokemon, but it can avoid getting spun on even after Foresight thanks to Wonder Guard.</p> <p>Once that is out of the way, it isn't difficult to counter Wartortle due to its pitiful offensive stats. If lacking Haze, Wartortle has trouble beating most Pokemon with a setup move, especially if they have Substitute. Klang can set up on Wartortle lacking Haze and is immune to Toxic. Braviary can set up Substitute and Bulk Up, and its Substitutes cannot even be broken by Seismic Toss. Taunt users can also beat Wartortle thanks to its weak offenses. Serperior can Taunt Wartortle and start to set up Calm Mind. Mandibuzz shakes off any damage with Roost and can Taunt Wartortle and cripple it with Toxic. Most special attackers, especially those with a super effective move, can beat Wartortle. For example, Roselia can threaten it out with Giga Drain while setting up entry hazards, and Roselia can heal itself if it gets burnt by switching out thanks to Natural Cure. LumRest Exeggutor doesn't mind status, can tank Wartortle's attacks with ease, and can hit it with Giga Drain. Rotom-S and Rotom-F can destroy Wartortle with Thunderbolt or cripple it by using Trick to take away its Eviolite.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<p>The almost unique combination of Foresight and Rapid Spin gives Wartortle the title of most reliable spinner in the tier. Scald is Wartortle's STAB move and gives it a chance to burn and cripple opposing physical attackers. With Scald, Wartortle can also beat entry hazard setters, such as Regirock and Golem, as well as spinning their entry hazards away. Toxic is used to cripple defensive threats, such as Musharna and Tangela. It also annoys and wears down offensive threats, such as Charizard and Ludicolo, on the switch. Meanwhile, Haze is another option to prevent Wartortle from being set up on.</p> <p>The Defense EVs on the set reach a jump point and allow Wartortle to take hits well from physical attackers, especially Golurk. The Special Defense EVs help it avoid a 2HKO from Life Orb Charizard's Hidden Power Grass. However, the EV spread is very flexible, and a specially defensive variant is equally viable if the team needs it. Wartortle is very vulnerable to being worn down, so teammates that can heal it or cure it from status are appreciated. Lickilicky and Audino are good teammates, as they can provide Wish support as well as cleric support, helping Wartortle regain HP and rid it of status and allowing it to shine on a stall team. Roselia can take Grass- and Electric-type moves for Wartortle, remove Toxic Spikes for it, and possibly provide cleric support with Aromatherapy. It can also provide Spikes and Toxic Spikes support, which stall teams need to have. On the set, Yawn can be used in place of Toxic and Haze to force switches, but it often clashes with Scald's burn chance. Seismic Toss is a good option to use as Wartortle's attacking move, as it can help break Substitutes and deal more damage. It also allows you to use Toxic more frequently, as there is no burn chance to interfere with it. While Torrent brings almost no benefit, it should be used because Rain Dish is illegal with Foresight, which is the primary reason to use Wartortle over Torkoal. Teammates that enjoy an entry hazard-free field appreciate the support that Wartortle provides. Charizard is a good example of this, as its 4x weakness to Stealth Rock is alleviated with Wartortle's support. They also share decent type synergy with one another.</p>"

  "Butterfree": {
    "overview": "<p>Butterfree's main claim to fame is its access to Quiver Dance, a claim shared by several other Bug-types. However, what sets Butterfree apart from the rest are its access to Sleep Powder and its two abilities: Tinted Lens and Compoundeyes. Tinted Lens allows Butterfree to power up resisted moves on sweeping sets and thus to reduce the need for coverage moves, while Compoundeyes makes Butterfree's support options more accurate. Of course, Sleep Powder is the move which truly makes Butterfree viable, as it prevents most would-be counters from safely switching in and creates valuable setup opportunities that Butterfree would otherwise not have due to its poor bulk. Unfortunately, Butterfree is still plagued by its poor typing and defenses. While Butterfree might be versatile, the prevalence of Stealth Rock significantly cuts down on its longevity and effectiveness in the NU metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rain Dance in conjunction with Damp Rock or Sunny Day in conjunction with Heat Rock are viable combinations that can be used on the support set, as Butterfree is able to set up weather reliably with the help of Sleep Powder, and it can provide a free switch for a weather sweeper by using U-turn. Hidden Power Ground and Hidden Power Rock are possible options, as the former threatens Bastiodon and Probopass, while the latter deals with Charizard. Giga Drain and Psychic are attacking options that can be used on the Quiver Dance set, with the former hitting Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types, and the latter threatening Garbodor and Fighting-types. Neither of these moves provides notable coverage otherwise, however, and Tinted Lens reduces the need for such coverage. Whirlwind might seem enticing in order to shuffle your opponent's team, but Butterfree generally has better things to do and it doesn't help Butterfree in any significant way.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>It is difficult to counter Butterfree as Sleep Powder can cripple practically any counter and turn it into a setup opportunity, while U-turn allows it to escape from any threat. The single most reliable way of crippling it is Stealth Rock, as it drastically detracts from Butterfree's ability to sweep or disrupt its opponents consistently. However, Sleep Powder prevents many common Stealth Rock users from setting it up. As for countering Butterfree directly, Sleep Talk users such as Regice or Munchlax are some of the best counters, as they don't mind absorbing status and can easily shrug off even boosted attacks due to their excellent Special Defense. In return, they can immediately threaten Butterfree with their respective STAB moves, or even phaze it out with Whirlwind in Munchlax's case. Pokemon that are immune to sleep thanks to their abilities, such as Vital Spirit Electabuzz and Primeape and Sap Sipper Miltank, can take advantage of Butterfree's mediocre initial power and proceed to dispatch it.</p> <p>If you do not have an actual way of stopping Butterfree from putting a Pokemon to sleep, sacrificing a Pokemon to Sleep Powder is a viable option; once Sleep Clause is active, Butterfree is much easier to deal with as it isn't particularly fast or powerful. Even after a Quiver Dance boost, many bulky Pokemon can still tank a hit and wear Butterfree down considerably if they are not weak to its STAB move. Bastiodon is a solid counter to Butterfree, as it can tank the Quiver Dance set very well, does not care about paralysis, and can either Roar away its Quiver Dance boosts or bounce back Sleep Powder with Magic Coat. Most specially defensive Pokemon, such as Camerupt, Lickilicky, Audino, Altaria, and Probopass, can easily wall Butterfree and phaze it out or outright beat it. Fast Substitute users, particularly Articuno, Drifblim, and Charizard, can use Butterfree as setup fodder, especially the dual powder set. Butterfree is not particularly difficult to revenge kill; most Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Rotom-S, Charizard, and Braviary can easily outspeed and pick it off. As Butterfree is quite frail on the physical side and only resists Mach Punch, most priority users can also revenge kill it as long as it is not behind a Substitute. Pokemon that use Rock Blast, such as Golem, Piloswine, and Garbodor, are effective at dealing with Butterfree, as they can bypass Substitute and can generally hit it for massive damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<p>With Quiver Dance, Butterfree functions as a capable setup sweeper, while being able to incapacitate a slew of slower Pokemon with Sleep Powder when necessary. Sleep Powder is one of this set's most important qualities, and is the move that allows this set to function. Butterfree has the ability to force out a myriad of defensive Pokemon, such as Musharna, Tangela, and Alomomola, as well as Choice-locked Fighting and Ground-types, such as Sawk and Golurk, respectively, which allows Butterfree to use Sleep Powder on your opponent's initial switch-in and gain setup opportunities. Alternatively, sometimes it is better to save Sleep Powder for your opponent's main counter to Butterfree and set up to begin with instead. Bug Buzz is the only attacking move that Butterfree needs on this set, as Tinted Lens doubles the power of resisted moves. Substitute allows Butterfree to avoid both status from Pokemon such as Musharna and Mandibuzz and revenge killing from Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Primeape.</p> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Butterfree to outspeed Swellow after a Quiver Dance Boost and tie with positive-natured Ludicolo in the rain after two boosts. However, if outspeeding those threats isn't a big deal, using a Modest nature gives Butterfree more power and still allows it to outspeed maximum Speed Serperior after a boost. Even though it might seem attractive on a Pokemon that can boost its Special Defense, a defensive EV spread is better left to Pokemon with actual defenses. Leftovers is usually the preferred item as it makes up for the HP lost creating Substitutes and switching into Stealth Rock, but if you want a boosting item, then Bug Gem is the best option as it allows Butterfree to gain some important KOs, such as against Charizard after Stealth Rock damage without any boosts. Alternatively, Insect Plate and Life Orb are suitable replacements. Insect Plate gives a consistent 20% boost in power to Bug Buzz without recoil, while Life Orb allows Butterfree to OHKO Pokemon such as Choice Band Sawk and Braviary after a boost and Stealth Rock damage. Roost is a possible choice over Substitute that allows Butterfree to heal off damage taken from Stealth Rock or from weak attacks, such as Giga Drain from Roselia and Foul Play from Mandibuzz.</p> <p>Stealth Rock support is extremely helpful, as it allows Butterfree to cleanly OHKO Primeape after a Quiver Dance boost with no boosting item, while getting the OHKO on Choice Band Sawk and Braviary with a boost and a Bug Gem. In general, many of Butterfree's checks tend to be weak to Stealth Rock, such as Regice, Charizard, and Rotom-S. Golem is a good partner for Butterfree, as are most Rock- and Ground-types, since it only shares Butterfree's weakness to Ice-type attacks, and it resists every other one of Butterfree's weaknesses; in exchange, Butterfree 4x resists Fighting- and Grass-type moves, and is immune to Ground-type moves. Other good options for the same role include Golurk, Piloswine, and Seismitoad. Probopass is also worth mentioning, as it can trap opposing Steel-types that wall Butterfree, and can gain momentum with a slow Volt Switch. Butterfree also appreciates Rapid Spin support; Wartortle is the best of the bunch in NU, as it resists Ice-type moves and has the combination of Foresight and Rapid Spin to ensure hazards leave your side of the field. Butterfree has trouble breaking through dedicated special walls such as Regice, Audino, and Lickilicky. Choice Band Sawk (and to a lesser extent, Gurdurr and Primeape) is a good partner, as it can KO all of those Pokemon with ease. It also functions as a good anti-lead, as it can OHKO most Stealth Rock setters through Sturdy due to Mold Breaker.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Powder": {
        "description": "<p>Butterfree's plethora of status moves allow it to support its own team, and make it capable of crippling a good portion of the opposing team. Compoundeyes increases the accuracy of its moves, improving the accuracy of Butterfree's status moves to 97.5%. Sleep Powder is the main move, temporarily removing an opposing Pokemon from battle. This allows it to stop most hazard setters, or to neutralize a problematic Pokemon for your team. Stun Spore is an auxiliary move that can allow Butterfree to paralyze a switch-in after Sleep Clause is in effect. It's also a nice alternative for hitting Primeape on the switch, as well as being usable when Sleep Clause is in effect. Stun Spore is also a very effective move to use when you are unwilling to waste Sleep Powder on a Pokemon that doesn't significantly threaten your team. U-turn is an integral move as it helps ease prediction after one of your opponent's Pokemon has been put to sleep by allowing Butterfree to get a teammate in for free regardless of what your opponent does. Tailwind is mostly filler, but doubling your team's Speed can be useful if Butterfree is too low on health to support the team any further.</p> <p>The EV spread allows Butterfree to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible and inflict status upon them before they can move. A spread with maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature and Bug Buzz instead of Tailwind can be worth considering to prevent Butterfree from being forced out by Sap Sipper Pokemon. This set doesn't mind Stealth Rock on its side nearly as much, as it is meant to simply inflict as much status as possible and then bring in a teammate safely. Thanks to Butterfree's ability to cripple a significant portion of teams, Pokemon that can take advantage of free turns or being able to outspeed more Pokemon, such as various wallbreakers or setup sweepers, are good teammates. Sawk, Fraxure, Carracosta, and Marowak are good examples of such Pokemon. Pokemon that can beat Sap Sipper users are also good teammates, with Gurdurr being a very effective option. Toxic is a viable option to use over Tailwind, as it allows Butterfree to cripple defensive Pokemon that don't particularly mind being paralyzed after Sleep Clause is in effect.</p>"

  "Beedrill": {
    "overview": "<p>To be blunt, Beedrill is a terrible Pokemon. It has bad stats and a bad movepool, and is entirely outclassed in whatever role it plays by other Poison-types such as Garbodor. The best thing it can do for a team is disrupt the opponent as much as it can, as it will never shine brighter than its competition in an offensive or defensive role. Beedrill is often a waste of a teamslot and should really only be used on joke teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic is an option for Beedrill to actually do damage to opponents without resorting to Endeavor. Knock Off is a decent option to remove opponents' items and disrupt them a little bit. Baton Pass allows Beedrill to pass several boosts to its teammates, and it even has boosting moves such as Swords Dance and Agility. However, such sets are entirely outclassed by Ninjask, which isn't even great at the job to begin with. Beedrill can also provide Sunny Day support, but is outclassed by Volbeat in this role. Beedrill can attempt to attack with X-Scissor, but it is usually better off trying to disrupt the opponent in its short lifespan. Pursuit can be used, but it will deal pitiful damage considering that nothing would feel threatened by Beedrill enough to switch out of it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Almost anything can counter Beedrill, but here is a list of those that stand out. Grounded Poison-types absorb Toxic Spikes and waste Beedrill's time. Skuntank in particular is a great option, as it can absorb Toxic Spikes, Taunt Beedrill, and Pursuit it for major damage. Pokemon with Taunt can easily beat Beedrill by preventing the use of its support moves. Misdreavus is immune to Endeavor and can Taunt Beedrill or burn it with Will-O-Wisp. Priority moves can defeat Beedrill once its Focus Sash has been activated and prevent the use of Endeavor. Kangaskhan can use a combination of Fake Out and Double-Edge to prevent Beedrill from doing anything at all. Multi-hit moves can bypass Beedrill's Focus Sash. Piloswine and Golem are examples of Pokemon that can use these to defeat Beedrill. The presence of Stealth Rock and Spikes also prevents Beedrill from using its Focus Sash effectively. Finally, all Pokemon that can outspeed Beedrill and are reasonably powerful can defeat it, although they must be wary of Endeavor.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Toxic Spikes is an annoying move that forces the opponent to take residual damage if the opponent does not have grounded Poison-types. Endeavor provides Beedrill's tiny niche over its competition. With a Focus Sash equipped and terrible defenses, Beedrill will often be knocked down to 1 HP, allowing it to damage the opponent as much as possible before going down. Occasionally, this can reap amusing results with residual damage from Toxic Spikes. U-turn allows Beedrill to escape if it is somehow still alive, and lets it gain momentum and bring in a teammate safely. Finally, Tailwind allows Beedrill to boost its teammates' Speed before it dies.</p> <p>Focus Sash is essential so that Beedrill can get off at least one support move before it gets knocked out. Endure + Custap Berry can be used with Endeavor, allowing Beedrill to take down opponents even with its Focus Sash broken. However, this is likely to fail against priority and requires a good amount of prediction. Substitute can be used with Endeavor in a similar vein, but this fails against faster opponents and prevents Beedrill from setting up. Roost is an option to get back to full health so that Focus Sash can be activated, but using it is often a waste of a turn due to Beedrill's frailty. Beedrill appreciates teammates that provide a way to prevent entry hazards so that its Focus Sash can remain intact. Mold Breaker Sawk and Taunt Serperior are good options for this. Ground-types, such as Golem, are also great teammates to get rid of grounded Poison-types that annoy Beedrill by removing its Toxic Spikes. Slow but powerful teammates, such as Ursaring, Marowak, and Samurott are also good options to take advantage of the Tailwind support that Beedrill provides. Finally, Beedrill also appreciates teammates that can actually take hits when Beedrill escapes with U-turn.</p>"

  "Pidgeot": {
    "overview": "<p>As impressive as it looks, Pidgeot is terribly outclassed by most other physical Normal / Flying type Pokemon in the tier. Its mediocre bulk and offenses do little to help it differentiate itself, and while it does have a moderately good Speed stat, it misses out on important base 95 Speed tier threats such as Sawsbuck. Its combination of Brave Bird, U-turn, and Quick Attack makes it a decent enough Choice Band user, but it is nothing special.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf can also be used, but most other Normal / Flying type Pokemon utilize it better with their higher power. Pidgeot has a usable special movepool, and a set with Hurricane, Heat Wave, Hidden Power Ground, and a filler move is feasible. Unfortunately, such a set isn't ideal as Pidgeot's Special Attack is mediocre at best. Tailwind is a decent support move, but Pidgeot is outclassed by Prankster Murkrow in this role. FeatherDance is also usable, but Murkrow again outclasses Pidgeot in supporting the team in this way. Whirlwind is an option, but Pidgeot's mediocre bulk doesn't allow it to withstand many attacks. Work Up is the best boosting move Pidgeot has but fails to improve its average power enough to be worth the time spent setting up. Pidgeot can set up Rain Dance and even make use of it with Hurricane, but Swanna is more effective in this role due to its STAB Surf and better Speed and power.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>While walling Pidgeot isn't difficult, it must be noted that most of the time Pidgeot will be using U-turn to scout for its counters. Steel-types, such as Probopass and Klang, wall Pidgeot and can easily set up on it. Rock-types also wall Pidgeot as long as they do not have a secondary typing which removes their resistance to Flying. Pidgeot has average power even with a Choice Band, so physically defensive Pokemon, such as Alomomola and Musharna, can easily tank any of its moves and retaliate with their STAB moves or cripple Pidgeot with status. Piloswine is a great check, as it can take any single hit from Pidgeot and threaten it with Icicle Spear and Ice Shard. Bulky Electric-type Pokemon, such as Ampharos and Eelektross, can switch in on any move but Return and threaten Pidgeot with their STAB moves. Most faster Pokemon can revenge kill Pidgeot easily due to its mediocre bulk and Stealth Rock weakness.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Sadly, Pidgeot's power is so mediocre that it needs a Choice Band set to actually leave a notable mark on the opposing team. Brave Bird is Pidgeot's strongest STAB move and helps it differentiate itself from Fearow. Return provides a reliable secondary STAB move and doesn't cause Pidgeot to take recoil. U-turn allows Pidgeot to scout the opposing team, escape any incoming counters, and differentiate itself from Dodrio. Quick Attack is the final move on this set, as it is a useful priority move to pick off frail or weakened Pokemon and is a move that Braviary doesn't have.</p> <p>Jolly is necessary for Pidgeot to outspeed positive-natured base 90 Speed threats such as Zangoose and Kangaskhan. Life Orb can be used with Hidden Power Grass to threaten Golem and Seismitoad, but Pidgeot would usually prefer to U-turn out instead. Pursuit can be used in the last slot to catch Gardevoir on the switch, but Kadabra and Haunter—the most notable other targets it hits—outspeed Pidgeot, are powerful enough to take it out, and likely won't switch out. Stealth Rock support from Pokemon such as Golem and Seismitoad is necessary to allow Pidgeot to have a good chance of OHKOing Choice Scarf Rotom-A and offensive Armaldo with Return and Brave Bird, respectively. As this set switches out often, Pokemon that can deter Stealth Rock from being set up, such as Choice Band Sawk and Taunt Samurott, are very useful teammates. In fact, any Fighting- and Water-type Pokemon make good teammates as they can deal with the Rock- and Steel-types that wall Pidgeot. Ground-type Pokemon, such as Golurk and Piloswine, are helpful to prevent Electric-type Pokemon from gaining momentum against Pidgeot with Volt Switch.</p>"

  "Pikachu": {
    "overview": "<p>With its signature item, Light Ball, Pikachu might seem like an incredibly dominating threat with offensive stats rivaling some Ubers; however, there are far too many things holding Pikachu back from being effective. Pikachu's main downfall should be fairly obvious: its bulk is absolutely pathetic--even lower than the likes of Haunter or Kadabra. While Pikachu can mitigate its frailty somewhat with Substitute, Encore, and its ability, Lightning Rod, its second downfall isn't as easy to overlook. The very Light Ball that makes Pikachu viable is also what makes it so limited; as Pikachu needs its Light Ball to not be complete dead weight, it is unable to use any other item, including Life Orb and all Choice items. Thus, Pikachu will not hit as hard as you might think it would: traditional powerhouses greatly depend on the boosts these items provide, while Pikachu has to do without. Successfully using Pikachu will require massive amounts of team support and top-level prediction.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Static is an inferior ability to Lightning Rod, but it might have to be used in order to give Pikachu access to moves that are incompatible with its Dream World ability, such as Focus Punch. Volt Switch is a fantastic move for scouting, but it's generally better used by Choice users, such as Rotom-S and Raichu. Pikachu can try a Nasty Plot set, but it doesn't have the bulk to make good use of it, leaving it prone to being revenge killed by nearly any Choice Scarf user. Knock Off is a great move, especially with all of the Eviolite Pokemon that are popular in NU, but Pikachu generally doesn't have room for it. An Agility set can work, but Pikachu's power isn't as amazing as it might first seem, and Pikachu risks being OHKOed or statused by anything it can't immediately OHKO. A physical set with Volt Tackle, Pikachu's most powerful attack, sounds decent on paper, but Pikachu isn't going to last long, as it will quickly whittle itself down with an awful base 35 HP stat. Other options for a physical set include Brick Break, Fake Out, and Extreme Speed, but note that Extreme Speed isn't legal with Lightning Rod.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Pikachu is afraid of anything faster than it with a powerful STAB attack, such as Primeape, Serperior, and Tauros, as they will easily OHKO it because of its terrible bulk. Every common Choice Scarf user in the tier can also outspeed and OHKO Pikachu if it's not behind a Substitute. Priority users, particularly Gurdurr and Linoone, can really hurt Pikachu if it isn't behind a Substitute. Sucker Punch is also a threat, but it's not usually a reliable way to pick off Pikachu, as most tend to hide behind Substitutes or Encores. Due to its massive Special Defense, Probopass doesn't really care about an unboosted Pikachu's attacks, except for the rare Hidden Power Ground, and it can OHKO Pikachu with Earth Power. Camerupt is in a similar situation, but both Pokemon must be wary of being Encored into the likes of Stealth Rock or Thunder Wave. Seismitoad also completely walls any Pikachu that is not running Grass Knot.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute": {
        "description": "<p>Pikachu's absolutely pathetic defenses make a Substitute set its best option. Thanks to its good speed, immunity to Electric-type attacks (including Thunder Wave), and access to Encore, Pikachu can find some opportunities to set up a free Substitute. Substitute helps ease prediction for Pikachu and allows it to dodge priority attacks while it hits the opposing Pokemon. However, keep in mind that even with Encore setting up a Substitute is not easy due to basically everything being able to cripple it in some way. Thunderbolt is Pikachu's main STAB move, while Hidden Power Ice provides it with BoltBeam coverage, allowing it to get around Grass- and Dragon-types that would normally wall it. Encore is chosen in the final slot to give Pikachu an easier time setting up Substitutes; by Encoring an Electric-type attack or a support move, such as Eelektross's Thunderbolt or Regirock's Stealth Rock, Pikachu can set up for free and begin hitting the opponent with powerful attacks. However, Pikachu can forgo the use of Encore for a Substitute + 3 attacks set, using Grass Knot to OHKO Seismitoad and 2HKO specially defensive Regirock. Grass Knot also hits Camerupt harder than any other move on this set.</p> <p>Hidden Power Ground can be used over Hidden Power Ice to beat Camerupt, Probopass, and Bastiodon. However, without Hidden Power Ice, Pikachu will be completely walled by Grass-types. Focus Punch is another option over Encore or Grass Knot to deal with specially defensive Normal-types and Probopass, but because it's illegal with Lightning Rod, Pikachu will have to use the inferior Static. This set requires massive support; don't expect Pikachu to be sweeping teams on its own anytime soon. Pikachu greatly appreciates paralysis support from defensive Pokemon such as Musharna and Lickilicky; while base 90 speed is fast for NU, it's still not enough to reliably deal with all of NU's offensive threats. In addition, something to lure in Electric type attacks--for example, Mantine or Braviary--can be effective if you really want to utilize Lightning Rod to give Pikachu free switches, but it's not reliable against experienced players, especially with the existence of Team Preview.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Raichu will never achieve stardom in NU, but it is still a decent special sweeper with an intriguing niche. It sits at a great Speed tier that allows it to outspeed non-Choice Scarf Haunter and Sawsbuck and tie with Charizard. Encore combined with Nasty Plot means it can force switches, disrupt the opposition, and sweep. Its ability Lightning Rod allows it to nab Special Attack boosts, and Raichu can use that in conjunction with Encore to potentially lock the opposing Pokemon into an Electric-type attack, giving it a further boost, as well as even more opportunities to set up. However, keep in mind that it will be walled depending on its moves and that it is easily revenge killed, so don't expect it to sweep teams consistently.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs and Choice Scarf seem to be good options thanks to Raichu's decent Special Attack and great Speed. However, Choice Scarf loses out on Nasty Plot and Life Orb, thus missing out on a great deal of power, while Choice Specs is largely outclassed by the Encore and Nasty Plot combination. Raichu has an interesting supporting movepool, but due to its frailty, it cannot afford to run Knock Off, Toxic, or Thunder Wave. Volt Switch can be used to good effect in conjunction with Encore, but Raichu would rather use the opportunity to set up and sweep. While ExtremeSpeed and Volt Tackle are two exciting options that you might want to run, they are illegal with each other and specially attacking Raichu is generally better due to access to Nasty Plot and the ability to utilize Lightning Rod. Hidden Power Grass can hit lighter threats for more damage than Grass Knot, but it's generally not worth the loss of power on the heavier threats. Lastly, as tempting as Surf may seem, it is illegal in BW2.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As mentioned before, specially defensive Grass-types, such as Vileplume, Exeggutor, and Roselia, can switch in and either attack or set up hazards. Special walls, such as Bastiodon, Audino, Munchlax, Regice, Lickilicky, and Probopass, can wall Raichu, but must be wary of the rare Focus Blast. Ground-types are generally a safe bet in taking down Raichu, but they must watch out for Grass Knot. Interestingly, Gardevoir can Trace Raichu's Lightning Rod ability and gain an Electric immunity, making it a solid check. Finally, physical Choice Scarf users or Pokemon with physical priority, such as Primeape, are able to outspeed Raichu and promptly take it down.</p>",

      "Encore + Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>What separates this set from those of other users of Nasty Plot, such as Shiftry and Simipour, is Encore. If used on a non-damaging move, Encore gives the opponent a choice: stay in, and be forced to repeat the same move,or switch. In either situation, Raichu is able to set up a Nasty Plot. At +2 and factoring in STAB, Thunderbolt will severely maim anything that does not either resist it or have absurdly high Special Defense. In the last slot, Grass Knot is used to hurt NU's many Ground-types, such as Golurk and Piloswine.</p> <p>In the fourth slot, Hidden Power Ice is a lesser option to hit Grass- and Dragon-types for super effective damage, but it's awfully weak even after a Nasty Plot boost, provides little additional coverage, and many of NU's Ground-types do not take super effective damage from it, notably Seismitoad and Piloswine. Focus Blast can be used to hit many of the bulky Normal-type Pokemon, such as Lickilicky and Audino, but using it means Raichu is totally helpless against Golurk, the most popular Pokemon in the tier, making it an inferior option. A physically offensive Fighting-type such as Choice Band Sawk is a decent partner, as its STAB Close Combat can eliminate the special walls of NU (most are weak to Fighting-type moves). Water-types such as Samurott and Seismitoad are also good partners as the former can lure in Electric-type attacks for Raichu while the latter can set up Stealth Rock for it, and both of them can break through Ground-types easily. Another good partner for Raichu is Charizard; it easily handles the Grass-types that wall Raichu with its STAB moves, as well as being immune to Ground-type moves, while Raichu can gain a Lightning Rod boost from Electric-type attacks aimed at Charizard.</p>"

  "Wigglytuff": {
    "overview": "<p>Wigglytuff is horribly outclassed by Lickilicky and Audino, both of which have much better bulk and abilities. Despite having a larger HP stat, allowing it to pass larger Wishes, Wigglytuff's poor bulk means it often has to keep the Wishes to heal itself, given that it can be 2HKOed by many powerful special attackers; hence, Lickilicky and Audino tend to get the job done more effectively. Wigglytuff's low offensive stats also make it setup fodder and Taunt bait. Its only niche is its ability to set up Stealth Rock while providing Wish support at the same time, but, otherwise, it fails to provide the sort of sustained team support that Lickilicky or Audino are able to.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Wigglytuff has access to dual screens, but it is outclassed in this role by Audino and Gardevoir, both of which have better bulk, the latter also having access to moves such as Memento and Healing Wish. Perish Song is a nice win condition for stall teams and prevents opponents from setting up on Wigglytuff, but it has trouble fitting it into any moveset. Disable is a decent option to mess with Choice item attackers, but Wigglytuff's four moveslot-syndrome, low Speed, and poor bulk hold this strategy back. Wigglytuff has a large offensive movepool of special attacks, including Focus Blast, Ice Beam, Fire Blast, and Shadow Ball, but Wigglytuff's low offensive stats mean an offensive set is simply ineffective. Finally, Wigglytuff can surprise physical attackers with Counter and a Focus Sash, but this strategy is gimmicky at best and is ruined by entry hazards.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fighting-types are the best counters to Wigglytuff as they almost always OHKO it. Scraggy and Gurdurr are notable for their ability to heal back any lost HP with Drain Punch. Ghost-types, such as Nasty Plot Misdreavus, Drifblim, and SubDisable Haunter, can set up on Wigglytuff without worry. Klang also sets up on Wigglytuff, as Double-Edge does pitiful damage to it. Pokemon with Taunt, such as Calm Mind Serperior and Mandibuzz, defeat Wigglytuff as it has no effective way to fight back. Bulky setup sweepers such as Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary and Substitute + Swords Dance Lickilicky set up all over Wigglytuff. Toxic Spikes also ruin Wigglytuff's day by limiting its longevity; Roselia and Garbodor are able to set them up. Wigglytuff is also beaten by most other walls since it doesn't usually run Toxic. For instance, Regirock and Tangela wall it completely and can wear it down while restoring HP with Drain Punch and Leech Seed, respectively. Encore and Trick are also good ways to cripple Wigglytuff by locking it into a useless support move, and can be used by the likes of Kadabra and Gardevoir, respectively, but neither of them like taking a Double-Edge. Finally, most powerful moves will overwhelm Wigglytuff, especially on the physical side, because in reality Wigglytuff is not bulky at all.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Wigglytuff's access to Stealth Rock sets it apart from other Wish users; without it, there would be no reason to use Wigglytuff at all. In addition, Wigglytuff can support its teammates by passing one of the biggest Wishes in NU, courtesy of its high HP stat. Protect allows Wigglytuff to scout its opponents' moves and receive its own Wishes safely. Note that this move may need to be used often because of Wigglytuff's poor bulk, so that it may receive its own Wishes and simultaneously avoid a hit that would KO it. However, be aware that Protect grants opponents free turns, which can easily be taken advantage of with free switches or setup opportunities, so caution must be exercised when using this move. Double-Edge prevents Wigglytuff from being Taunt bait and can break through Substitutes. Wigglytuff's high HP stat also means that the recoil damage does not matter too much to it.</p> <p>Heal Bell is a nice support move to rid Wigglytuff and its teammates of status, but there is hardly any room to fit it in. Seismic Toss can be used over Double-Edge for consistent damage against Rock- and Steel-types, but it is illegal with Frisk, and one must then use the extremely situational and often useless Cute Charm. Magic Coat is a decent option to bounce back Taunt, status moves, and entry hazards, but like Heal Bell, it is hard to fit into the moveset. Similarly, Thunder Wave and Toxic are decent moves to cripple fast threats and stall out opposing walls, respectively, which would be great if only there were a little more room on the set. Alomomola is a great teammate that can take physical hits while forming a double Wish combo with Wigglytuff. Misdreavus can take most physical attacks, provide cleric support for Wigglytuff, and appreciates Wish support from Wigglytuff. Mandibuzz can defeat Ghost-types such as Golurk and Misdreavus that threaten to defeat or set up on Wigglytuff, while phazing out greedy opponents that try and set up on Wigglytuff. Wigglytuff absolutely despises Toxic Spikes they limit its longevity; grounded Poison-types, particularly Garbodor, are good teammates in order to absorb them. Garbodor can also take most Fighting-type attacks aimed at Wigglytuff, enjoys Wish support, and can set up Toxic Spikes of its own to aid in Wigglytuff's stalling. Finally, teammates that appreciate Wish support are good options. These include Gurdurr, Skuntank, and Choice Band Braviary.</p>"

With its well-rounded bulk and useful typing, it can check some of NU's most powerful sweepers, such as Samurott, Primeape, Serperior, and Eelektross. Unfortunately, Vileplume's typing also inflicts it with painful weaknesses to common Flying-, Psychic-, and Ice-type attacks. It also faces stiff competition as an offensive and defensive Pokemon from the likes of Victreebel and Roselia, respectively. While it's not always going to be the star of the show, Vileplume's unique attributes make it a solid contender on any balanced or stall team in need of a little flower power.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Leech Seed is generally an excellent support move; however, Vileplume only has access to it through an event and has to sacrifice Effect Spore to use it. A physical sweeping set consisting of Drain Punch, Seed Bomb, Return, and Swords Dance can work, but it is outclassed by Cacturne; moreover, Vileplume is too slow to pull it off consistently. Toxic and Stun Spore are both plausible options; however, using them is unadvised for a few reasons: Sleep Powder is usually the superior status move, Effect Spore can already inflict poison and paralysis, and Vileplume just doesn't have any moveslots to spare. Vileplume can put its hula skills to the test with Teeter Dance or Petal Dance, but as mentioned previously, Vileplume is strapped for moveslots as it is, so these options are generally not recommended. Finally, Vileplume can attempt to use a Chlorophyll set to sweep, but it is outclassed by almost every other Chlorophyll user in NU.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Hypno is quite possibly the best counter to Vileplume, as it is immune to Sleep Powder and its gargantuan Special Defense allows it to survive even Life Orb-boosted attacks; Hypno can then obliterate Vileplume with Psychic. Sleep Powder can make Vileplume a little tricky to counter; however, after Sleep Clause has been activated, it's much easier to manage. Articuno, Golbat, Mandibuzz, Regice, and Weezing all make solid counters, as all five take very little from any of Vileplume's attacks and can decimate it with their STAB moves. Opposing Poison-types, such as Roselia and Skuntank, make for solid checks. Roselia and Skuntank can beat defensive Vileplume, although offensive variants can threaten Roselia with repeated Sludge Bombs and Skuntank with Hidden Power Ground. Speaking of Hidden Power Ground, if Vileplume lacks the move, Steel- and Poison-types such as Bastiodon, Mawile, Metang, Scolipede, and Garbodor can all deal with it.</p> <p>Magmar is one of the better offensive checks to Vileplume, given its resistance to Giga Drain and immunity to Sleep Powder, although it won't enjoy taking a Life Orb-boosted Sludge Bomb or Hidden Power Ground. Jynx and Charizard can take any attack (provided Stealth Rock is not up) and OHKO with their high-powered STABs. Musharna can OHKO Vileplume with Psychic and tank at least one attack, making it a good check. Use care when switching it in however, as it will be outsped and 2HKOed if it switches into a Vileplume that has entry hazard support. Finally, powerful Flying-, Ice-, and Fire-types such as Braviary, Rotom-S, Rotom-F, and Camerupt can all take on Vileplume, though they all share the same fate as the previous offensive threats if they switch into the wrong move.</p>",

Moonlight is a given, as it allows Vileplume to heal itself throughout the course of the match and works great in ensuring that it outlives what it checks and counters. Aromatherapy is geared towards more stall-orientated teams; waking a teammate that has previously used Rest and removing the dreaded poison, but it can be just as effective on offensive teams by ridding fast sweepers such as Kangaskhan of paralysis and removing crippling burns on physical attackers. Sleep Powder is an excellent status move, as it allows Vileplume to often cripple a potential threat for the remainder of the match. Giga Drain is Vileplume's best defensive STAB, inflicting respectable amounts of damage on threats such as Samurott while simultaneously regaining health. Sludge Bomb deals with most Pokemon resistant or immune to Vileplume's Grass-type STAB, including Tangela, Sap Sipper Sawsbuck, and Charizard.</p> <p>Most of the EVs go into Defense so that Vileplume can reliably take advantage of its Fighting-type resistance to beat Sawk and Primeape. The 44 Special Defense EVs allow Vileplume to take random Ice Beams more effectively. For example, Vileplume will always survive Life Orb Gorebyss's Ice Beam, even after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Grumpig is one of Vileplume's best defensive partners, given its ability to tank Fire-, Psychic-, and Ice-type attacks, which lets it walk all over Jynx and Torkoal. It also appreciates status affliction relief that Vileplume can provide with Aromatherapy. Piloswine also works as an effective partner, as it can set up Stealth Rock and sponge any Ice-type moves. In return, Vileplume can take Grass-, Fighting-, and Water-type moves aimed at it. Another Ground-type that pairs well with Vileplume is Camerupt. Camerupt can roast troublesome Steel- and Ice-types, while Vileplume can sap the life out of opposing Water-types. Alomomola also works as a fine partner by tanking physical Fire- and Flying-type attacks, while Vileplume can return the favor by sponging physical Electric-, Fighting-, and Grass-type attacks. Finally, Regirock and Regice can beat Pokemon that trouble Vileplume; Regirock can take on Swellow, Braviary, and Charizard, while Regice has no difficulty inflicting pain on Rotom-S, Haunter, and Golbat.</p> <p>Vileplume can also work just as effectively on more balanced teams. Here, offensive partners such as Sawk work well for their ability to demolish opposing Ice- and Steel-types that trouble Vileplume. Skuntank also makes a good partner, given its ability to Pursuit trap pesky Psychic-types. Vileplume can even aid Skuntank with Aromatherapy support or act as a shock absorber for Fighting- and Ground-type attacks. Carracosta and Seismitoad also appreciate Vileplume's ability to tank Grass-type attacks aimed at them. Another Water-type that's fond of Vileplume's presence is Samurott; they cover each other's weaknesses well and, as a result, can appropriately deal with each other's checks and counters.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>An offensive set might seem odd given Vileplume's low base Speed; however, it has a few key features over its competitors: great bulk, access to a reliable recovery move, Sleep Powder, and a surprisingly high Special Attack. Sleep Powder is one Vileplume's main perks, as it allows it to cripple any Pokemon resistant to its attacks, such as Golbat, Weezing, and Skuntank. Giga Drain forms an exceptional combination with Life Orb given its capability to nullify recoil damage and keep the offensive momentum going. Sludge Bomb is Vileplume's most powerful Poison-type STAB and can serve as a battering ram when dealing with Grass-type resists such as Roselia, Sawsbuck, and Charizard. With Moonlight, Vileplume can act more as a defensive tank, not being worn out by either Life Orb recoil or entry hazard damage.</p> <p>The EV spread is designed to outspeed minimum Speed Tangela and other uninvested base 60s. The EVs maximize Special Attack while the remainder is put into HP so that Vileplume can function as a bulky attacker of sorts. Vileplume has one other option it could use: Hidden Power Ground. With Hidden Power Ground, Vileplume can maim Skuntank and Metang on the switch, two Pokemon that wall it otherwise.</p> <p>Vileplume's appreciation for Stealth Rock support couldn't be any more pronounced. With the pointed stones up, Vileplume has the capability to OHKO Jynx, Swellow, and Charizard on the switch with Sludge Bomb. Not only that, but with Stealth Rock jabbing away at its opponent, it can OHKO offensive Regirock with Giga Drain and Skuntank with Hidden Power Ground. Supportive variations of Carracosta and Seismitoad both make excellent partners to set up Stealth Rock and generally have good synergy with Vileplume. While Skuntank is normally considered a nemesis, it can form a superb partnership with Vileplume, as its Pursuit trapping utility can come in handy when dealing with Psychic-types such as Hypno, Gardevoir, and Musharna. In exchange, Vileplume can destroy opposing Ground-types that trouble Skuntank. Finally, Spikes support from the likes of Scolipede isn't quite necessary, but Vileplume can pose an even bigger offensive threat with it, as it can then OHKO defensive Regirock and Ludicolo with Giga Drain and Sludge Bomb, respectively.</p>"

  "Victreebel": {
    "overview": "<p>Victreebel is one of the most dangerous sun sweepers in the tier thanks to its ability, Chlorophyll, and its fantastic offensive capabilities. Its access to powerful STAB moves such as Solar Beam and Sludge Bomb alongside great coverage moves such as Weather Ball makes it a devastating force under the sun. Unfortunately, its absolute reliance on the sun is also its greatest downfall; reliance on moves such as Solar Beam and Weather Ball means it simply cannot function outside its element, and its sweep can be cut short should the sun turns run out. In general, Victreebel struggles to carve itself a niche outside of dedicated sun teams, as its frailty and mediocre Speed outside of sun often prevent it from being effective. Victreebel can be a terrifying force when supported properly, but keep in mind that it won't always find a spot on your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Swords Dance set might seem plausible at first, surprising special walls and using Sleep Powder to set up, but Shiftry better performs this role due to its access to Nature Power and STAB Sucker Punch. Victreebel can also use Sunny Day to become a self-supporting sweeper, but Rain Dance Ludicolo is a better Pokemon for this role as it has a much easier time setting up with its better bulk and can use rain-boosted Hydro Pumps to clean up. Giga Drain can provide a more reliable Grass-type STAB move and HP recovery, but SolarBeam and Leaf Storm are superior as the power is more important and Victreebel is too frail to make good use of the recovery. Power Whip can be used on either set, but doesn't hit anything harder than Victreebel's other moves would. Stun Spore can spread paralysis, but Victreebel is too frail for this to be worth using.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>It is difficult to truly counter Victreebel, especially under sun. Dragon-types such as Dragonair, Altaria, and Zweilous are by far the best counters to Victreebel, as they do not fear Sleep Powder and can either set up on it or phaze it out. Bulky Poison-types such as Garbodor and Muk make for solid responses, as they can tank any one hit and retaliate back with their respective STAB moves. Roselia can even absorb Sleep Powder thanks to Natural Cure, though Weather Ball easily 2HKOes it. Probopass can also tank a hit or two from Victreebel, though it cannot do much back in return.</p> <p>Without the sun, however, Victreebel becomes much easier to handle, as it is relatively slow and quite frail. Faster Pokemon that can take a Sucker Punch, such as Charizard and Braviary, can easily check it. Sawk and Primeape resist Sucker Punch and can retaliate with Ice Punch—with proper prediction, Primeape can even switch in on Sleep Powder thanks to Vital Spirit. Priority users such as Kangaskhan and Skuntank make for great checks, easily picking off a weakened Victreebel. Audino and Lickilicky can take hits from it rather well, though they must watch out for boosted SolarBeams and Sleep Powder.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sun Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Say hello to one of the deadliest sun sweepers in NU. Under the sun, Victreebel becomes a force to be reckoned with—with doubled Speed and high-powered moves coming off of a base 100 Special Attack, Victreebel can clean up weakened teams with ease. Do note, however, that Victreebel absolutely requires support from teammates to set up sun for it to function. Solar Beam is Victreebel's most powerful drawback-free STAB attack, barreling through anything that does not resist it. Weather Ball is an interesting and unique coverage move Victreebel has access to; it attains excellent coverage with Solar Beam, while also receiving a boost from sun. Sludge Bomb rounds out this set's coverage, providing a strong attack to use against Dragon-types and Charizard while also giving Victreebel a strong STAB move to use if sun is not up. The last slot is generally reserved for Growth; while Victreebel is usually strong enough to sweep without it, if it does manage to set up, it will become almost impossible to wall. Due to Victreebel's frailty, however, it often does not find the opportunity to do this and must resort to offensive pressure. On the other hand, Sleep Powder can also be used as a way to cripple a check, setting Victreebel up to hit the next switch-in hard.</p> <p>It cannot be stressed enough that partners for Victreebel must be able to set up sun for it—Pokemon such as Golem, Regirock, and Probopass can do this while also setting up Stealth Rock and can deal with bulky Poison-types that Victreebel struggles against. Probopass in particular makes for a good partner, as it can utilize Volt Switch to bring in Victreebel safely. Prankster users such as Volbeat and Liepard are also fine choices to set up sun as they can disrupt opposing teams and support Victreebel with Encore and U-turn. Liepard can also threaten Psychic-types, most importantly Trace Gardevoir, with STAB Sucker Punch. Jumpluff is another interesting partner to consider; not only can it set up sun thanks to its high Speed, but it can utilize support moves such as Sleep Powder and Memento, both of which give Victreebel setup opportunities with Growth. Other sun sweepers such as Charizard are also useful to take advantage of the weather.</p>"
      },
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>A mixed attacking set is Victreebel's most effective set when it is used outside of a dedicated sun team. Victreebel can punch holes in many teams, thanks to the sheer power of its moves and Sleep Powder. Sleep Powder is the main move of the set, allowing it to cripple an opposing Pokemon and hit the next switch-in hard; it is also what distinguishes Victreebel from Shiftry, who would otherwise be a superior choice. Leaf Storm is Victreebel's most powerful STAB move, and is chosen over Giga Drain due to its immense and immediate power. Sludge Bomb provides great coverage, hitting most Pokemon that resist Leaf Storm hard while also providing a more reliable STAB move. Sucker Punch can catch many threats that attempt to revenge kill Victreebel off guard, somewhat mitigating Victreebel's low Speed.</p> <p>Hidden Power Fire can be considered because of its ability to hit Metang hard, but it doesn't really cover anything else. Encore can potentially be useful to support teammates and disrupt the opposing team, but Sleep Powder generally accomplishes this already. Victreebel appreciates free switch-ins due to its frailty, making slow pivots such as Probopass, Eelektross, and Musharna useful teammates. Probopass can also set up Stealth Rock, allowing Victreebel to secure the 2HKO against standard Mandibuzz with Sludge Bomb and 2HKO Musharna with Leaf Storm (factoring in the Special Attack drop). Ground-types are also good teammates to set up Stealth Rock, as aside from this role they are also able to deal with bulky Poison-types such as Muk that can give Victreebel problems. Fighting-types such as Sawk and Gurdurr can handle special walls for Victreebel, making them solid partners. Water-types such as Samurott and Carracosta are also good options, being able to deal with Steel-types such as Metang and lure in walls such as Alomomola and Tangela for Victreebel to take advantage of.</p>"

  "Golem": {
    "overview": "<p>NU is a tier packed full of potential Stealth Rock users, many of whom share one of Golem's typings. However, there are many different reasons to choose Golem for a slot on your team. The best reason to choose Golem for your team is its dual Ground / Rock typing, which no other common Pokemon in NU shares. This allows it to take Flying-type moves with ease while also being immune to Electric-type attacks. It also gives Golem an additional STAB move to utilize, which Pokemon like Gigalith would love to have. Additionally, Golem is one of only a few Pokemon in the tier that is nearly guaranteed to set up Stealth Rock thanks to Sturdy, allowing Golem to live any one hit from full HP unless the opposing Pokemon has Mold Breaker. With these things in mind, Golem is usually better suited for more offensively oriented teams. Finally, while Golem may have exploitable Grass-, Water-, and Ground-type weaknesses and a low Special Defense stat, it is still a great Stealth Rock user that gets its job done well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There are not many other options for Golem. One thing that it can fit into its Custap set is Sunny Day over Explosion. With this change, Golem is able to set up both Stealth Rock and Sunny Day in order to support its team. This is a solid option for sun teams, as Golem will likely use Sunny Day right before it dies, providing a free switch into a threatening sun sweeper. You can also choose to run Stone Edge for more power or Rock Slide for greater accuracy, though you lose out on being able to break Substitutes and Focus Sashes. Normal Gem can be used alongside Explosion to deal massive amounts of damage, though this is less reliable than Custap Berry. For this same reason, Lum Berry and Leftovers are generally poor choices on the Custap set. Custap Golem can also utilize Endure to ensure that Choice Band Mold Breaker Sawk can't prevent it from setting Stealth Rock, but in order to run it, you would have to forfeit one of Golem's great coverage options, making it an inferior option. Autotomize might seem like a good option to outspeed and defeat common checks to Golem, but between its common weaknesses making it difficult to set up and its Speed leaving it vulnerable to being revenge killed by common Choice Scarf users, Golem is generally better off filling a supporting role. A Choice Band could be used, but Golem is not best suited for this role; because many other common Stealth Rock users share a similar typing, you are just compounding weaknesses for your opponent to exploit. Sturdy is also great for a Stealth Rock lead role, and by running a Choice Band set, you aren't utilizing Golem to its fullest potential.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Golem's weaknesses are common, and it also has a poor Special Defense status that can be used against it. For these reasons, it has many checks and counters. Some Taunt users, such as Misdreavus and Serperior, can both prevent Stealth Rock from being set and defeat Golem one-on-one. Misdreavus is faster than both of Golem's sets, has access to Will-O-Wisp, and is immune to both Explosion and Earthquake. Serperior can use Taunt and hit Golem hard with Giga Drain. Mold Breaker Sawk can also prevent Stealth Rock from being placed by ignoring Sturdy and knocking out Golem in one hit. Golem struggles to beat bulky Water- and Grass-types, such as Samurott, Ludicolo, and Torterra, which can all manage to take a hit while bringing Golem down to 1 HP. Piloswine can also beat Golem thanks to STAB Ice Shard and Earthquake, both of which Golem is weak to. Alomomola cannot prevent Golem from setting up Stealth Rock, but otherwise, it will always beat Golem not carrying Toxic thanks to its great HP, high Defense and access to Wish. Finally, while Golem may seem like a solid answer to Braviary, it needs to be wary against it due to Bulk Up. Golem relies on hitting a high number of times with Rock Blast in order to break through Substitutes and hit for solid damage; otherwise, Braviary can set up to +6 Attack and Defense with Bulk Up while Golem struggles to break Substitute. Golem also risks being hit with a Superpower if it switches into Braviary.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<p>With a great STAB combination coupled with a good attack and defense, Golem can be an effective tank. One of the main benefits of Golem using this set over a more offensive set is that it stays around for quite a while, allowing it to reliably check Flying-types in the tier, such as Swellow. Stealth Rock is a quintessential move for any team to keep many dangerous threats in check, and Golem has many opportunities to set up the move due to its typing. Rock Blast is preferred for the Rock STAB, hitting through Substitute users such as Braviary. Earthquake is Golem's other STAB move, and it, along with Rock Blast, obtains almost perfect coverage in NU. For the final moveslot, there are two options: Sucker Punch and Toxic. The choice between the two is entirely up to what your team needs more. Sucker Punch takes on a more offensive role, allowing Golem to beat faster, frailer foes such as Haunter, but Toxic is great for crippling walls and decreasing their vitality.</p> <p>56 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Shell Smash Torkoal before it has gotten off the boost and defeat it before it gets the chance to use Rapid Spin. Lum Berry can be used in lieu of Leftovers to cure one infliction of status, giving Golem the opportunity to come in on a predicted Toxic later in the match. It also helps it to beat Liepard and to guarantee Stealth Rock is placed against opposing Golurk with Dynamic Punch. Rocky Helmet is another option for an item, as it punishes both Rapid Spin users for removing your Stealth Rock and Swellow and Braviary that try to regain switch initiative with U-turn. Protect may be chosen over Sucker Punch or Toxic for the last slot. While it may have less utility than either of these moves, there are situations where Protect can come in handy. First, it allows Golem to scout against common Choiced Pokemon such as Primeape and Sawk. It also grants Golem a turn of Leftovers recovery after switching in to Stealth Rock, allowing it to refresh the effects of Sturdy.</p> <p>Good teammates for this set are rather similar to the Custap Berry set: Pokemon that like the presence of Stealth Rock on the field in order to help net certain KOs love the utility this set offers. Since this Golem set often sticks around longer in the battle, it can also take hits from Flying and Normal-types that other teammates may not appreciate. This makes frailer offensive threats, such as Swellow, great choices for partners. Golem also appreciates a partner who can sponge the special hits that it would rather avoid. Mantine fits this role well since it complements Golem's typing well, resists Fighting-type attacks, and takes most special Grass and Ice-type attacks with ease. It also has Water Absorb, which means it benefits from switching into Water-type attacks targeted at Golem.</p>"
      },
      "Custap Lead": {
        "description": "<p>This set is designed to get up entry hazards at the beginning of the battle. With Sturdy at its disposal, Golem is guaranteed to set up Stealth Rock against most opposing leads. Another way this set benefits from the presence of Sturdy is through Custap Berry and Explosion. Thanks to Sturdy and a lack of EVs in Defense or Special Defense, Golem will often be knocked down to Custap range very early on in the battle. Custap Berry gives the user +1 priority on the next selected move when the holder is at 25% or less HP. This, in combination with Explosion, makes Golem a potent threat and allows for a safe switch into another Pokemon once it has completed the task of setting up Stealth Rock. Some may argue that Gigalith does this job better due to its higher Attack stat, but Golem also has Ground-type STAB to its advantage--something that Gigalith cannot claim. This makes Earthquake a mandatory move on the set. Rock Blast is chosen over Stone Edge or Rock Slide to allow Golem to hit through common Substitute users such as Braviary, Haunter, and Ninjask, as well as breaking Focus Sashes on Pokemon like Scolipede.</p> <p>The given set runs maximum Speed EVs because the loss in bulk is not important for a suicide lead. There are also still a few options that you can use over the moves listed in this set. Toxic is a nice move to take on the bulkier Pokemon against which Golem may otherwise struggle, chipping away at walls such as Alomomola and Tangela. You may also want to run Sucker Punch over Explosion to catch some Pokemon such as Haunter off guard after Custap Berry has been used. This set runs best on offensive teams that require a specific Pokemon being weakened or taken out, as both Explosion and Stealth Rock will deal a great amount of damage to opposing leads and switch-ins. Anything that appreciates the presence of Stealth Rock to assure a KO makes a good partner to this Golem set. Some examples include Sawsbuck, Ludicolo, and Seismitoad. Scolipede makes a decent partner to Golem as well, as it can set up Spikes alongside Golem's Stealth Rock while Golem can take the Fire-, Rock-, and Flying-type attacks aimed at Scolipede. Finally, Misdreavus can be partnered alongside Golem to take on Sawk and block Rapid Spin.</p>"

  "Mr. Mime": {
    "overview": "<p>With mostly average stats across the board and a horrible defensive typing that gives it a Pursuit weakness, Mr. Mime is a very mediocre Pokemon in the NU metagame. Even though its Special Defense is respectable, most of the time it is outclassed by its competitors; Musharna performs a support role better, while Gardevoir and Kadabra perform an offensive role better. However, its access to Baton Pass and support options such as Nasty Plot and Encore let it carve itself a niche as a Baton Passer. However, keep in mind that for any other purpose you are generally better off using one of the other Psychic-types in the tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A dual screens set along with Encore and Baton Pass can be used to provide utility and preserve momentum. Taunt can prevent status and stop the opponent from using Mr. Mime as setup bait, but both the moves in the third slot of the set can do either, and more besides. Mr. Mime can use its hidden ability, Technician, with moves such as Magical Leaf, Icy Wind, and 60 Base Power Hidden Powers, but as previously mentioned, is typically wasted as an offensive threat. A Choice item can be used in conjunction with Trick, but this deviates from Mr. Mime's niche. Signal Beam, Shadow Ball, Thunderbolt, and Focus Blast are good coverage moves which Mr. Mime can utilize, but it is hard-pressed for moveslots as it is. Confuse Ray, Thunder Wave, and Trick Room are support moves that Mr. Mime can use, but it cannot utilize these moves very efficiently compared to other Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Taunt is a great stop to anything Mr. Mime can do if it hasn't already used Nasty Plot. However, if it is at +2 and Taunted, it can still hit the opponent hard with Psychic. As far as Pokemon go, Mandibuzz is a full stop to Mr. Mime, as it can Taunt it, hit it with Foul Play or Brave Bird, and Whirlwind it out to render its boosts useless. Liepard can come in on any move, use Encore on Mr. Mime, and then can Pursuit trap it. Even though Skuntank can Taunt it and trap it with Pursuit, Mr. Mime is faster and can Baton Pass out; however, none of the typical recipients of its boosts like taking a STAB Sucker Punch at all. Metang can easily take even boosted Psychics and can hit it hard with STAB Meteor Mash. Tauros and Swellow can easily hit Mr. Mime hard with their powerful STAB moves; however, keep in mind that if Mr. Mime is behind a Substitute, it can do considerable damage to them on the counter-attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>With a choice of two great abilities along with Baton Pass and a range of boosting moves, Mr. Mime is quite the Baton Passer. Baton Pass is a necessary and obvious move on this set, and Mr. Mime can use it to pass boosts to a teammate, as well as being able to dry-pass to maintain momentum and escape Pursuit from Skuntank, one of the premier users of Pursuit and Taunt in the tier. Keep in mind, however, that Mr. Mime will not be able to escape from pivot Liepard due to priority Encore, letting it trap Mr. Mime with Pursuit if you predict wrongly. Nasty Plot is the boosting option of choice as it allows Mr. Mime to grant an immediate +2 Special Attack boost to something that can make better use of it. Substitute is preferred to avoid status and provide an essentially free switch in for a teammate if Mr. Mime Baton Passes with the Substitute intact. Encore can be used instead to provide setup opportunities for Mr. Mime. In the last slot, Psychic is necessary to prevent Mr. Mime from becoming Taunt bait, as well as to giving Mr. Mime the option to utilize the Nasty Plot boosts itself.</p> <p>The given EV spread means that Mr. Mime's Substitutes cannot be broken by support Lickilicky's Dragon Tail or defensive Probopass's Power Gem, letting it set up on these Pokemon with ease. Filter is the ability of choice, as it lets Mr. Mime take super effective moves such as U-turns and Shadow Balls more effectively, the latter being especially important as Mr. Mime can 2HKO defensive Misdreavus with +2 Psychic, while Misdreavus cannot 2HKO back. Soundproof can be used instead to let Mr. Mime ignore Roar and Perish Song, both of which are irritating for a Baton Passer, but it's rather unreliable in terms of effectiveness; while it can indeed set up on some users of these moves, such as Camerupt, Bastiodon, and Eelektross, it also loses to other Pokemon such as Misdeavus, Mandibuzz, and Zweilous. Calm Mind is a fine alternative to Nasty Plot in order to let Mr. Mime set up against special attackers more easily, but Mr. Mime prefers the immediate boost from Nasty Plot most of the time, and is outclassed by Musharna in this role. While Leftovers is typically the best item in order to offset Substitute damage, Salac Berry can be used in conjunction with Substitute to boost Mr. Mime's Speed in a pinch and either Baton Pass to a teammate or sweep on its own. On a similar note, Lum Berry can be used in conjunction with Encore to shrug off status that would otherwise cripple Mr. Mime.</p> <p>Pokemon that can utilize said Nasty Plot boosts to sweep, such as Charizard and Kadabra, make for great partners. Fighting-type Pokemon also make for good partners, being able to defeat most of the Dark-types that give Mr. Mime trouble. Pokemon such as Ludicolo and Seismitoad can be a threatening force under rain, and even more so after being Baton Passed a Nasty Plot boost, making them excellent partners too. As Mr. Mime can Baton Pass Special Attack boosts to it, Victreebel does not need to waste a slot for Growth, and can afford to run more coverage. It is also a threatening sweeper under harsh sunlight.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Even with its legendary stats and good STAB combination, Articuno struggles to make an impact with its poor offensive stats. Lacking good offensive options outside of its STAB moves, Articuno cannot shine as a fully offensive Pokemon. Defensively, Articuno has to deal with weaknesses to common types, such as Fire- and Electric-types, and a quadruple weakness to Stealth Rock. Due to its overall good stats, Articuno's best sets combine offense and defense. A combination of decent Speed, reliable recovery, and Pressure allows Articuno to stall out some Pokemon this frosty bird cannot defeat offensively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A specially defensive set using Roar and Heal Bell is decent, but Regice simply outclasses Articuno as a defensive Ice-type due to Articuno's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock. A Choice Specs set utilizing U-turn can work, but its power still isn't impressive and it can only switch in twice if Stealth Rock is on your field. Icy Wind can slow down faster opponents when they switch in, and Frost Breath can break through Calm Mind users such as Musharna; however, neither option provides much benefit outside of those situations. Articuno can act as a late-game sweeper by using Agility, but it lacks the power to truly sweep teams. Tailwind is an interesting support option, but Articuno doesn't last long enough to warrant a moveslot. Articuno can set up Rain Dance and make use of it with Hurricane, but it can't set up reliably due to its Stealth Rock weakness. Haze can stop an opponent from boosting its stats, but Roar is generally the more efficient option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Steel-types such as Metang and Probopass wall Articuno unless it carries Hidden Power Ground. Bastiodon is notable, as it carries Roar and Stealth Rock, allowing it to continuously force Articuno out and make it take Stealth Rock damage upon switching back in. Speaking of Stealth Rock, it is the most effective way of keeping Articuno in check, as it strips away half of Articuno's HP, making it harder to use even with access to Roost. Rock Blast users, such as Garbodor and Armaldo, can break through Articuno even if it is behind a Substitute, but the users take a lot of damage from the offensive set in the process. Duosion can set up on the defensive set, but it takes a lot of punishment from the offensive set. A faster physical attacker, such as Tauros or Swellow, or a Fire- or Electric-type can revenge kill Articuno if it doesn't have a Substitute up.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>Ice Beam is Articuno's most reliable STAB move, providing great super effective coverage. Hurricane is less accurate, but is Articuno's most powerful offensive option and allows it to power through bulky Pokemon such as Alomomola. Roost is useful in order to help Articuno maintain high HP, make use of its great bulk, and mitigate Stealth Rock damage and Life Orb recoil. Substitute is the preferred option for the last slot in order to provide a buffer against status and attacks, and continual use takes advantage of Pressure's ability to PP stall the opponent out of low PP moves such as Stone Edge and Close Combat. However, Hidden Power Ground is also viable if you need Articuno to be able to hit Steel-types reliably.</p> <p>Leftovers is this set's main item as it allows Articuno to switch into Stealth Rock twice and survive, and it also enables Articuno to make five Substitutes without having to use Roost. Life Orb is also a viable item to enhance Articuno's offensive power, but this set already has decent strength, and the recoil costs it the ability to switch into Stealth Rock as often. Pressure is the only legal ability, which is fine because it is necessary for this set to function at its best. Combined with Roost and Substitute, Articuno can easily stall out moves such as Stone Edge and Close Combat, often removing a Pokemon's only option to hit it hard. Timid is the preferred nature as it allows Articuno to outspeed threats such as Adamant Kangaskhan, Adamant Sawk, and Jolly/Timid Drifblim. Modest is still a usable nature if you wish to 2HKO standard Alomomola with Hurricane, though failing to outspeed these threats can be costly. Pokemon that can prevent Stealth Rock from being set up are very useful to reduce the number of times Articuno has to Roost; it should be noted that this set is less threatened by Stealth Rock than others, as its main goal is to attack things in general. Sawk and Samurott are good teammates to deter common Stealth Rock users from setting up. Ground-type teammates are highly valued as they can threaten Steel-, Electric-, and Fire-types that threaten Articuno; options such as Golurk, Golem, and Seismitoad can also provide Stealth Rock for your team. Seismitoad is notable because it can also use Rain Dance to sweep, which works perfectly with Articuno by improving Hurricane's accuracy. Toxic Spikes support, from teammates such as Roselia and Garbodor, is very useful because it allows Articuno to stall out defensive Pokemon it normally would not be able to, such as Lickilicky and Audino.</p>"

        "description": "<p>This set focuses more on Articuno's bulk to stall out the opponent's team. Substitute is necessary in order to prevent status from crippling Articuno and to stall out low PP moves such as Stone Edge and Close Combat. Roost is crucial, as it keeps Articuno's HP high enough to continuously make Substitutes and also mitigates Stealth Rock damage. Toxic is the preferred option if your team does not provide Toxic Spikes support, as it allows Articuno to stall out a majority of defensive Pokemon more effectively. It is also a great option even if your team has a Toxic Spikes user, as it guarantees that you can poison your opponents' teams even if they have a grounded Poison-type. Protect is the preferred option if your team can set up Toxic Spikes, as it provides another PP stalling method and a way to scout Choiced Pokemon. Ice Beam provides a reliable STAB move and prevents Articuno from losing to Taunt users.</p> <p>Leftovers is the only viable item because it allows Articuno to create up to five Substitutes at full HP. Timid is the only choice for a nature because this set needs to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible in order to set up a Substitute before they attack. The HP EVs hit a Leftovers number and, alongside the Special Defense EVs, allow Articuno's Substitute to survive a Sludge Bomb from specially defensive Roselia and a Waterfall from standard Alomomola. Toxic Spikes support, from Pokemon such as Roselia and Garbodor, is pivotal for this set so that Articuno does not need to Toxic the opposing Pokemon itself. Articuno prefers to maintain as much HP as possible, so having teammates to prevent or remove Stealth Rock is important. Sawk and Samurott can help prevent Stealth Rock from being set up, while Rapid Spin users such as Wartortle and Torkoal are options for removing them entirely. As this set has trouble dealing with Regice, Golem is a very useful teammate to threaten it in addition to Fire- and Electric-types.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written around the time that BW was considered the main generation. The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW NU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>Meganium is your basic bread-and-butter Grass-type Pokemon with nothing too out of the ordinary. A fairly balanced stat spread and decent support movepool make it a versatile Pokemon that can be catered to fit your team's needs. Unlike the many other Grass-types that Meganium faces stiff competition from, such as Torterra and Vileplume, its base 80 Speed and overall bulk make it a fast, decent check against a number of threats, such as Ludicolo, Golurk, and Exeggutor. Despite these qualities, however, Meganium's mono-Grass typing leaves it with weaknesses to types commonly seen within the metagame, specifically Fire-, Ice-, and Bug-types, and vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards. Furthermore, Meganium is easily threatened by many of NU's top threats, such as Braviary and Charizard, which can make it struggle to consistently support its team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A dedicated dual screens set with Light Clay can be used, but it's outclassed by Serperior due to its higher Speed and Taunt. A RestTalk set is an option, but it's unreliable, and Synthesis and Aromatherapy work well enough for recovery and removing status ailments, respectively. A SubSeed set can be used, but Meganium would need to sacrifice a lot of its bulk in exchange for Speed to make it worthwhile. Counter is an interesting choice to surprise unsuspecting physical attackers. Sunny Day support with Solar Beam and Hidden Power Fire is also a possibility. In terms of offensive options, Body Slam can be used for the 30% chance of paralyzing an opponent, and Petal Dance is a stronger Grass-type attack; however, it's not recommended on defensive sets due to its effect. Meganium has access to Swords Dance and can use moves such as Seed Bomb, Earthquake, and Return, but it's more or less outclassed by Sawsbuck and Cacturne as a physical attacker. Finally, a Choice Specs set could be used, but Meganium doesn't pack the offensive presence to make this viable and thus prefers to stay defensive.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Strong Pokemon with powerful super effective attacks generally work well to deal with Meganium, as it has many common weaknesses. Charizard, Braviary, Swellow, and Haunter are some examples of Pokemon that completely crush it. The majority of Substitute-using Pokemon, including Misdreavus and Braviary, can set up against Meganium as it struggles to break their bulwark in one hit with Giga Drain or Dragon Tail. Sap Sipper Pokemon, such as Sawsbuck and Miltank, can absorb Leech Seed and Giga Drain and proceed to set up against Meganium. Mantine and Regice can tank Meganium's hits with impunity, thanks to their high Special Defense, and can hit back with their super effective STAB Air Slash and Ice Beam, respectively. Audino, Lickilicky, and Probopass also work well with their high Special Defense and can PP stall Meganium out of Aromatherapy by constantly crippling it with status. Finally, Vileplume is immune to Leech Seed and the potential Toxic and can hit Meganium hard with its STAB Sludge Bomb.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>With its respectable bulk and Speed, Meganium makes a great addition to a team in need of cleric and phazing support. Aromatherapy is its primary support move, curing its team and itself of harmful status effects. Synthesis is used to replenish Meganium's HP and ensure longevity, but Leech Seed can be used if you prefer passive healing and the ability to potentially heal a teammate should Meganium switch out. Giga Drain is Meganium's STAB move of choice, hitting for reasonable damage and restoring some of its health simultaneously. Finally, Dragon Tail separates Meganium from its fellow Grass-types and turns it into an efficient phazer.</p> <p>A physically defensive EV spread and nature can be used if you prefer Meganium to take on the likes of Tauros, Kangaskhan, and Primeape better. You can also opt to use a Speed reducing nature rather than an Attack reducing nature if you want Meganium to hit harder with Dragon Tail, but note that this leaves it outpaced by many notable threats, such as Garbodor and defensive Seismitoad. Light Screen or Reflect can also be run depending on your needs. Lastly, Toxic is a decent option to cripple troublesome walls, and Hidden Power Fire is a decent secondary attacking move to hit Grass-, Steel-, and Ice-types hard.</p> <p>Meganium works really well on defensive teams because of its ability to fill a cleric and phazing role in one teamslot, which separates it from Roselia as a defensive Grass-type. Entry hazard supporters are also strongly encouraged to rack up additional damage when using Dragon Tail. Garbodor is a great option for Spikes and Toxic Spikes support; it appreciates Aromatherapy in case of paralysis or burn status as well as Meganium's ability to resist incoming Ground-type attacks. Torkoal and Alomomola can also be used to form a potent Fire / Water / Grass core, as they both synergize very well with Meganium and each other's typing. Additionally, they both appreciate cleric support and Torkoal can assist the team with Stealth Rock as well.</p>"

  "Togetic": {
    "overview": "<p>Togetic has access to two moves that give it a niche in NU: Nasty Plot and Baton Pass. While Pokemon like Volbeat, Mr. Mime, and Musharna give Togetic fierce competition as a Baton Passer of Special Attack boosts, there are a few reasons to use Togetic over them. Unlike Volbeat, Togetic has a slow Baton Pass that allows it to bring in its teammates safely, without them taking damage. Togetic is also quite specially bulky, so it can take repeated hits while recovering them off with Roost. Other Baton Pass users have trouble dealing with their recipient's counters, but Togetic can deal with them relatively easily thanks to its large movepool. Togetic's typing isn't great, as it gives weaknesses to common types such as Ice and Rock. The weakness to Rock also makes it fairly easy to 2HKO after the damage from Stealth Rock. Togetic relies on Eviolite for its bulk, so it is easy to wear down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Togetic has a very large movepool that it can make use of. Coverage moves include Shadow Ball, Grass Knot, and Signal Beam, each of which takes care of a specific group of threats. Togetic can choose not to use Nasty Plot and Baton Pass if it's not needed for your team, and use its wide range of support moves instead, such as Encore, Heal Bell, Magic Coat, Toxic, and Thunder Wave. It also gets Yawn, Wish, and Tailwind to act as a very useful support Pokemon. The combination of Yawn and Baton Pass can be used to gain momentum very easily, as the opponent will likely switch out after the use of Yawn, so you can Baton Pass for the switch advantage and easy momentum. Togetic has access to Light Screen and Reflect for a dual screens set, but running Light Clay over Eviolite takes away from its bulk too significantly, and not using Light Clay means it is outclassed by other dual screen users. You can choose to simply run a specially defensive walling set, with Tri Attack, Roost, and two support moves. Togetic can utilize the combination of Serene Grace and moves such as AncientPower, Silver Wind, and Ominous Wind to get +1 in every stat, but this tactic is unreliable and the moves themselves are very weak, so it's generally not worth using. Hustle can be used on a physical set, but Togetic is rather weak physically, so is better off supporting or attacking on the special side.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Phazers such as Bastiodon can stop Togetic from passing Nasty Plot boosts. Misdreavus with Perish Song can put Togetic on a timer, and force it to directly switch instead of using Baton Pass. Taunt users such as Misdreavus, Mandibuzz, and Serperior can shut down Togetic, stopping it from using any non-attacking moves. Mandibuzz commonly runs Taunt, Whirlwind, or both, so it is a big problem. It also doesn't take much even from a boosted Tri Attack or Fire Blast. Misdreavus can use both Taunt and Perish Song, as well as being immune to Tri Attack and bulky enough to take any coverage move Togetic may carry. Electric- and Rock-types, such as Eelektross, Golem, Carracosta, and Electabuzz, can deal with Togetic effectively thanks to their strong super effective STAB moves. Piloswine can take any attack, and use Ice Shard to prevent a Baton Pass or phaze with Roar. Piloswine can also do a lot of damage to Togetic with its strong Ice STAB moves. Strong physical attackers such as Sawk and Zangoose can easily beat Togetic through its mediocre physical defense.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>Nasty Plot boosts Togetic's mediocre Special Attack and can potentially be passed on to a teammate to give them an opportunity to sweep or do some big damage to the opposing team. Baton Pass lets Togetic pass Nasty Plot boosts, as well as giving your team some momentum and allowing Togetic to act as a useful pivot. Roost recovers health to increase Togetic's longevity, and also helps alleviate the lack of passive recovery from Leftovers. Hyper Voice is the most reliable STAB option, as Tri Attack is illegal with Nasty Plot. However, it leaves Togetic completely walled by Ghost-types. Fire Blast is a strong alternative, and while it is not STAB, it lets Togetic hit Ghost-types and Pokemon weak to Fire such as Metang and Exeggutor. It can also help in removing the Baton Pass recipient's counter.</p> <p>248 HP is used to leave Togetic with some health after switching into Stealth Rock 4 times. Specially defensive Togetic is the optimal spread, as it allows Togetic to check many special attackers, including Serperior, Charizard, and Samurott. A physically defensive spread using 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD can be run, using a Bold nature. This makes Togetic a good check against Pokemon like Primeape. Steel-types such as Metang and Probopass act as good partners, as they resist Ice and Rock, while Togetic is immune to Ground. Any special attacker that appreciates a Nasty Plot boost is a good partner. Examples include Charizard, Samurott, and Serperior. Serperior works particularly well as it has a fast Taunt to disable opposing Taunt users that would otherwise stop Togetic from setting up and passing boosts. Seismitoad works very well with Togetic as it is immune to Electric-type attacks and also deals with Rock-types very well. Togetic resists Grass-type moves and can set up Nasty Plots in the Grass-types that force Seismitoad out. Seismitoad can also receive Nasty Plot boosts to open up a potential sweep. Electric-types also appreciate Nasty Plot boosts, while resisting Electric-type attacks often aimed at Togetic and beating Mandibuzz, which is annoying to Togetic.</p>"

  "Ampharos": {
    "overview": "<p>Ampharos is adorable, but sadly this doesn't necessarily make it popular in battle. It is overshadowed pretty badly by Eelektross, who is notable for its mixed attacking prowess and Levitate, as well as several other NU Electric-types, who are faster. Despite the fierce competition, Ampharos actually has a lot of things that these Pokemon don't. For one, it has the highest Special Attack of all NU Electric-types, and can really pack some good power with its Electric-type attacks. It has a lower Speed stat but greater bulk than much of its competition as well, allowing it to take hits that many other Electric-types would otherwise crumble to, and it is not weak to Stealth Rock like Rotom-F and Rotom-S, who are similarly bulky and powerful. While Ampharos has a somewhat shallow movepool, it does have the rare Heal Bell, which further takes advantage of its unusually good bulk. Unfortunately, its lack of reliable recovery means that Ampharos's decent bulk cannot be fully taken advantage of. Ampharos is an oddball amongst its Electric brethren, but it can still be effective.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Agility is an interesting option to allow Ampharos to outrun foes while maintaining its superior bulk over other Electric-types, but it usually doesn't have enough power to sweep foes, and almost every relevant Choice Scarf user still outspeeds it even after a boost. Zap Plate boosts Ampharos's Electric-type moves without reducing its HP and undermining its bulk, but its coverage moves become noticeably weaker. Magnet Rise can be used to dodge Ground-type moves and Cotton Guard can be used to boost Ampharos's Defense, but Ampharos doesn't really have any moveslots to spare for either of them without leaving it wide open to other threats. Rain Dance + Thunder can be used, but faster Electric-types such as Rotom-S do this better. Ampharos also has Power Gem, but it strikes nothing bar Shedinja harder than its main options. Thunder Wave or Cotton Spore can slow down opponents, but Thunder Wave clashes with Toxic, and Ampharos has Agility if it really needs to outspeed threats. Ampharos has an interesting physical movepool consisting of Wild Charge, Fire Punch, Bulldoze, Brick Break, and Outrage, but Luxray and Eelektross use physical moves more effectively. Body Slam can be used for an alternative way to spread paralysis, but it still can't touch Golurk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ground-types pose a huge threat to Ampharos and can destroy it with their STAB moves; Golurk is noteworthy for being immune to Ampharos's STAB moves and Focus Blast, Golem has Sturdy, Seismitoad only fears Hidden Power Grass, Piloswine takes a pittance from Electric- and Ice-type coverage, and Camerupt isn't weak to anything Ampharos commonly carries. Grass-types make for excellent switch-ins as they do not take too much damage from anything short of a Choice Specs Hidden Power Ice; Roselia, Vileplume, and Calm Mind Serperior can get the upper hand easily. Specially bulky Pokemon such as Lickilicky, Audino, Munchlax, Regice, and Eviolite Dragonair can tank Ampharos's hits, but must be wary of Focus Blast, or Hidden Power Ice in Dragonair's case. Ampharos fears Ground-type moves, but note that it can survive most attacks not backed by STAB, such as Sawsbuck's Nature Power or Kangaskhan's Earthquake.</p> <p>Its low Speed and lack of reliable recovery make Ampharos easier to check than counter, though note that a healthy Ampharos can survive most powerful attacks, so revenge killing is not easy. Taunt from the likes of Serperior, Skuntank and Misdreavus stunts most defensive Ampharos sets, though other users such as Samurott and Mandibuzz obviously need to watch their step. While Heal Bell allows Ampharos to cleanse itself of status, its meager 8 PP means that repeated use of status can still work on Ampharos provided the status user can withstand Ampharos's assaults. Powerful attacks usually 2HKO Ampharos, so keeping up the offensive pressure on Ampharos can lessen the damage it does to your team and the support it offers to its teammates.</p>",

      "Tank": {
        "description": "<p>This set attempts to utilize Ampharos's unique traits, namely its bulk, power, and access to Heal Bell, to their fullest. Its decent bulk lets it take some hits, while its power allows it to easily retaliate. Packing the strongest Thunderbolt in NU, Ampharos is easily capable of dealing massive damage to anything that doesn't resist its powerful Electric-type attacks. To hit the Ground-types that are immune to Ampharos's STAB moves, both Hidden Power Ice and Hidden Power Grass are viable options for Ampharos to use in the second slot; the former has greater neutral coverage alongside Thunderbolt and can take on Torterra, while the latter can be used specifically for Seismitoad, a much more common threat. Volt Switch allows Ampharos to keep momentum by taking advantage of the opponent's switches, and still hits hard thanks to Ampharos's high Special Attack despite being mainly a support move. For the last slot, Ampharos can choose either offensive coverage or a support option. Focus Blast hits Normal- and Rock-types such as Lickilicky and Bastiodon and nails Pokemon that can take both Ice- and Electric-type attacks such as Piloswine and Rotom-F, making Ampharos difficult to wall. Alternatively, Heal Bell is Ampharos's biggest niche as an Electric-type, giving it the ability to heal status effects from itself and its teammates, making its whole team harder to wear down with status.</p> <p>Life Orb gives Ampharos extra power to its attacks, while Leftovers grants Ampharos more survivability. Ampharos still faces stiff competition with Eelektross in terms of wallbreaking, but does trade mixed attacking prowess for slightly more power and Speed as well as the ability to take status attacks if Heal Bell is used. Signal Beam can be used over Focus Blast or Heal Bell, preferably alongside Hidden Power Grass to net the best overall coverage, but misses out on Grass / Poison-types. The Speed EVs allow Ampharos to outspeed uninvested base 65 Pokemon such as Alomomola so that it can take them down without hassle. Alternatively, an EV spread of 132 HP / 252 SpA / 124 Spe outpaces minimum Speed base 70s such as Mantine, but they aren't quite common enough to justify the loss in bulk. A Timid nature with maximum Speed can outspeed threats such as Mandibuzz, Misdreavus, Gorebyss, and Jolly Carracosta, but loses out on both power and bulk, two of Ampharos's greatest advantages.</p> <p>Choice Specs can be used to allow Ampharos to hit like a nuke without taking recoil, but Choice-locked Electric-type attacks are easily taken advantage of and Ampharos will not be able to make use of Heal Bell as effectively. Ampharos's partners should be able to take advantage of its capacity to punch holes into the opponent's team; fellow special attackers such as Charizard and Kadabra appreciate Ampharos's ability to weaken bulky Pokemon such as Probopass and Musharna for them, while physical attackers such as Primeape, Swellow and Golurk like having Alomomola, Metang, and Mandibuzz out of the way. Primeape even boasts U-turn, which allows it to maintain momentum and form a VoltTurn core with Ampharos's Volt Switch.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Ampharos's decent bulk allows it to take a more defensive route, letting it utilize a specially defensive set to serve as a strong check to special attackers such as Charizard and Eelektross. Thunderbolt is the main STAB move, and can deal solid damage even with no investment in Special Attack. Heal Bell wards off status from itself and its teammates, increasing its survivability. Toxic wears down bulky opponents that would otherwise sponge Ampharos's attacks easily, most notably Ground-types. For the last slot, Volt Switch allows Ampharos to maintain momentum to prevent the opponent from taking advantage of its uninvested attacks, whereas Focus Blast is a strong neutral option against Ground-types and the Electric-types that Ampharos walls.</p> <p>Even with Focus Blast, Ground-types remain huge problems for Ampharos, especially Golurk. Thus, Grass-type or Flying-type partners are recommended; Ampharos resists the Flying- and Electric-type attacks aimed at them, while they are capable of switching into Ground-type attacks with little trouble. Tangela and Mandibuzz are decent options to consider. Regirock can be a viable partner in case Charizard becomes too much to handle, while the shared Ground-type weakness can be covered with the aforementioned Grass- and Flying-type partners and / or Alomomola. Speaking of which, Alomomola makes a great partner by taking physical hits and providing Wish support to make up for Ampharos's lack of reliable recovery, while Ampharos takes on Electric-types and provides Heal Bell support for Alomomola. Discharge could be used to spread paralysis, but might clash with Toxic against targets which you'd prefer to poison. If Discharge is used, Toxic may be replaced with Hidden Power Ice to nail Grass-types and Golurk, but without investment it won't do much.</p>"

Access to dual screens, good bulk, and a slow Volt Switch make Ampharos excel at creating optimal setup conditions for most sweepers, especially offensive setup sweepers on hyper offensive teams. Light Clay is the item of choice to extend the duration of the screens, lengthening the amount of time your sweepers can take hits while setting up. Heal Bell lets Ampharos further support its teammates, in case status prevents the possibility of a sweep on an important sweeper.</p> <p>Ampharos faces competition from faster dual screen users, such as Serperior and Gardevoir, both of whom can get the appropriate screen up before taking damage and have access to Taunt, while Ampharos might struggle to get both screens up and Volt Switch away. Ampharos does boast the benefit of a slow Volt Switch, however, taking the hit for its teammate and then bringing it in for free, something Serperior and Gardevoir cannot do. A specially defensive spread may be used, but this set prefers well rounded bulk as the dual screens will do the heavy lifting in terms of taking hits. If you don't like Heal Bell, Safeguard can go in the last slot as a final act to set the stage, protecting the setup sweepers from status. Hidden Power Ice allows Ampharos to fight back against Ground-types, but this set isn't really meant for that purpose. Setup sweepers that can set up on Ground-types or Grass-types, such as Serperior, Sawsbuck, Drifblim, and Misdreavus, are excellent partners. The support Ampharos provides isn't limited to these recipients though, as Ampharos practically lays the red carpet for setup sweepers. Swoobat, Linoone, Samurott, Carracosta are all examples of possible teammates that would definitely appreciate the extra bulk.</p>"

Bellossom has the base stats for a decent special wall, but it has little reason to be used over Roselia or Vileplume. Bellossom has the small niche of being able to wall Ground- and Psychic-types, as well as Ludicolo and Samurott, but you are generally better off using one of the other two.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Much like Bellossom's performance in battle, its other options are quite limited. Petal Dance is an option for greater attacking power, but locking itself into a move is too risky to be of great use. Leech Seed is an option to support the team, but Bellossom has trouble fitting it into a set. A Teeter Dance and Stun Spore combination creates an annoying paraflinch situation, but that strategy is luck-based and unreliable. Bellossom could take advantage of the sun with Chlorophyll, Solar Beam, and Hidden Power Fire, but it is outclassed as a setter by Volbeat, Custap Berry Golem, and Liepard and as a sweeper by Victreebel, Sawsbuck, and Charizard. Lastly, a Swords Dance set with Sleep Powder, Seed Bomb, and Drain Punch is doable, but the damage output is underwhelming and Bellossom can easily be revenge killed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Pokemon with Sap Sipper are the greatest checks to Bellossom because they can use their boost to easily sweep Bellossom's team. Strong physical attackers such as Sawk can easily plow through Bellossom as well. Pokemon with Guts, such as Swellow and Ursaring, can switch in on a status attack if their Orbs have been activated and hurt Bellossom. Serperior can use Taunt or Substitute and takes very little from all of Bellossom's attacks. RestTalk Regice is good counter to this set as well as it can handle all of the attacks and fire back with Ice Beam. Clerics such as Audino and Lickilicky remove the status Bellossom spreads throughout the team and can sponge off all of its attacks. In general, faster Pokemon that resist Giga Drain can switch in and threaten Bellossom with their STAB moves; these include Swellow, Charizard, and Braviary. Lastly, Steel-types resist both of Bellossom's attacks, so they can easily move around Bellossom.</p>",

However, Synthesis is a reliable recovery option that can be used over Hidden Power Rock if Bellossom's longevity is important.</p> <p>Sweepers such as Shell Smash Carracosta and Shift Gear Klang are great partners for Bellossom because they synergize well with it and can easily set up on a sleeping or paralyzed foe.

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aromatherapy turns Jumpluff into a fast cleric for its team, but not only does Aromatherapy have problems fitting into a moveslot, but there are also better clerics out there, such as Lickilicky, to take Jumpluff's place. Synthesis can be used over Leech Seed and Giga Drain for instant recovery, and it works even better in sun, where it heals 66% of Jumpluff's HP. Amnesia and Cotton Guard are alternative moves to increase Jumpluff's defenses, but even after a boost, Jumpluff is still quite frail. Reflect offers even more support, but because Jumpluff lacks Light Screen, it isn't worth taking a moveslot. Stun Spore can be used in place of Sleep Powder to reduce the Speed of faster opponents, but because it isn't the most reliable way to cripple opponents, Sleep Powder is usually the superior option. Finally, an all-out specially attacking set in the sun can be utilized, but Jumpluff's Special Attack is rather poor, and it doesn't have a way to boost it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky Pokemon in general, such as Lickilicky and Misdreavus, can typically beat Jumpluff. Electric-types resist Jumpluff's main STAB move and can hit it hard with Hidden Power Ice or an Electric-type attack. In particular, Rotom-S resists both of Jumpluff's STABs. Piloswine puts fear into Jumpluff's heart with its priority Ice Shard, which decimates it. Jumpluff can be easily revenge killed by faster threats, such as Swellow and Choice Scarf users, including Rotom-S and Jynx. Pokemon with the ability Vital Spirit, most notably Primeape and Electabuzz, can switch into Jumpluff much more easily, as they do not fear Sleep Powder. However, it's a risky move for some of them, as Jumpluff can seize the opportunity and, for example, OHKO Primeape with Acrobatics if it is running the Swords Dance set.</p> <p>There are also a variety of Pokemon that can check Jumpluff well. Steel-types, such as Probopass, Bastiodon, and Metang, resist Acrobatics and take Seed Bomb rather well, thus checking the Swords Dance set fairly easily. They can be crippled with ease by Jumpluff's other sets, however. Sawsbuck and Miltank with Sap Sipper can check Jumpluff quite well, but Sawsbuck must be wary of Acrobatics from the Swords Dance set. Other Grass-types, such as Serperior and Tangela, take little damage from Jumpluff bar Acrobatics and are immune to Leech Seed, but they must be wary of Sleep Powder. Taunt can shut down all of Jumpluff's sets, but be aware that Jumpluff can retaliate back if it is running the Swords Dance set. Without Sleep Powder (or when Sleep Clause is activated), Jumpluff is more easy to handle because, even at +2 Attack, it is fairly weak. With the exception of the Swords Dance set, Jumpluff prefers to support its teammates, so you should focus on not letting its partners come in safely, as it is nearly impossible to prevent Jumpluff from doing its job.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>This set is by far Jumpluff's best offensive set. Even without the help of Chlorophyll, Jumpluff can outspeed the majority of the tier, and its decent coverage lets it hit most of NU for at least neutral damage. Acrobatics is Jumpluff's strongest Flying-type STAB move, and its power is increased further when the Flying Gem is used. Seed Bomb is a Grass-type STAB move that hits hard against Rock-types that resist Flying-type attacks. Swords Dance boosts Jumpluff's Attack to acceptable levels and is the center point of the set. Finally, Sleep Powder and Encore both allow Jumpluff to set up more easily but in different ways; specifically, Sleep Powder allows Jumpluff to set up while the opponent is immobilized by sleep, while Encore can force switches, gaining momentum and allowing Jumpluff to set up.</p> <p>The listed EV spread ensures that Jumpluff can Speed tie with Tauros and other max Speed Jumpluff. Substitute can be used in the final moveslot to allow Jumpluff to avoid status conditions and set up safely. Sunny Day support can benefit Jumpluff, as it is able to outspeed the entire unboosted tier with Chlorophyll. Volbeat and Liepard, both of which can also offer U-turn support to Jumpluff, are great sun inducers. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Garbodor, Regirock, and Scolipede is vital for allowing Jumpluff to secure extra KOs, such as an OHKO on Tangela after Spikes and Stealth Rock damage. Gurdurr is a great partner for Jumpluff, as it likes the support Jumpluff offers to help it set up with Bulk Up, and it threatens Sap Sipper users and Steel-types, two types of Pokemon that trouble Jumpluff, with Mach Punch and Drain Punch. Hard hitting Ground- and Fighting-types, such as Sawk and Seismitoad, can weaken Steel-types, specifically Metang and Bastiodon, both of which threaten Jumpluff. Finally, Alomomola makes a solid partner, as it is able to take priority and wall threats that Jumpluff can't defeat even with Swords Dance, such as Piloswine and Kangaskhan.</p>"
      },
      "Support Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>With this set, Jumpluff is more than capable of crippling opponents with its status moves, then switching into a sweeper with U-turn. With Jumpluff's high Speed stat, it can serve as a quick pivot with U-turn to bring a teammate in after the foe is crippled. Encore allows Jumpluff to lock slower Pokemon into a move that won't harm its team and can force switches. Sleep Powder puts potential switch-ins to sleep, giving Jumpluff the chance to bring in a potent sweeper. Finally, Leech Seed gives Jumpluff and its teammates a source of recovery and wears down the checks and counters to its teammates.</p> <p>248 HP EVs allow Jumpluff to switch into Stealth Rock four times at full HP, and the rest of the spread focuses on making Jumpluff as fast as possible. Protect is a viable option that allows Jumpluff to collect additional HP from Leech Seed, but it cannot find a place in the moveset without sacrificing something more useful overall. Toxic can be used to wear down the opponents more quickly and cripple them further, but it has trouble fitting into the moveset as well. Substitute is an option to attempt a SubSeed set, but the strategy in itself is mediocre. Giga Drain, while being rather weak, could replace Leech Seed to prevent Jumpluff from being Taunt bait, but the majority of Taunt users are slower than Jumpluff and are therefore not that big of a threat.</p> <p>Because Jumpluff can cripple the opponent for its teammates, good partners are sweepers who appreciate that. Charizard in particular does well against opposing Grass-types and Jynx. Entry hazard support is great to have with Jumpluff, as it usually forces a lot of switches. Entry hazard setters, such as Scolipede, Garbodor, and Metang, are good options. Gothorita is also a good partner, as the momentum Jumpluff gains can be used to its advantage, allowing it to trap and KO foes Jumpluff cripples before they can switch out. Gurdurr is a great partner, as it can set up Bulk Up very efficiently thanks to Jumpluff, and it threatens Sap Sipper users and Steel-type Pokemon with its Fighting-type STAB. Because U-turn lets Jumpluff bring in a teammate on a crippled opponent, Pokemon that like having a free setup turn, such as Zangoose, Gorebyss, Ursaring, and Samurott, really appreciate the support Jumpluff offers.</p>"

      "Sunny Day": {
        "description": "<p>Jumpluff can fit into sun teams nicely with its ability, Chlorophyll, making it a great candidate for a sun inducer. Sunny Day allows Jumpluff to set up sun and provide support for sun sweepers, such as Exeggutor and Charizard. Sleep Powder can put foes to sleep and potentially allow sun users to sweep the adversary. Encore is also used to allow Jumpluff's partners to have less trouble setting up and lock walls into a less desirable move. Memento sacrifices Jumpluff to weaken the opponent, allowing the following partner to come in for free and set up more easily.</p> <p>Heat Rock increases the duration of Sunny Day, and as such, should be the only item used on this set. The given EV spread allows Jumpluff to switch into Stealth Rock four times at full HP and gives it as much Speed as possible. When Jumpluff is in the sun, Chlorophyll allows it to outspeed the entire unboosted tier. Leaf Guard could be used if status is really hindering Jumpluff's capabilities, but in most cases, Chlorophyll is the superior option. U-turn is an alternative over Memento, allowing Jumpluff to set up sun multiple times over the course of a match.</p> <p>Sun sweepers, such as Exeggutor, Charizard, Victreebel, and Rapidash, are great partners for Jumpluff, as they can take advantage of the sun it offers to capitalize on their respective abilities. Other sun inducers, such as Regirock and Volbeat, should be used along with Jumpluff so that it doesn't have all the weight on its shoulders and to have a reliable backup. Prankster Liepard is a big threat to this set, as it can Taunt Jumpluff before Jumpluff can cripple it. Pokemon that can deal with this threat, such as Sawk and Gurdurr, are great partners. Gurdurr in particular is an excellent partner for Jumpluff, as it can deal with Sap Sipper users and Steel-types, two types of Pokemon Jumpluff despises.</p>"

  "Granbull": {
    "overview": "<p>Granbull is an outclassed Pokemon if it decides to go fully offensive or fully defensive. It's the combination of its usable bulk with Intimidate, high Attack, and fairly unique support movepool that separate it from other Normal-types in NU. Its base 120 Attack can leave dents in anything that does not resist its moves, and its support moves can give more offensive teams much needed cleric support without giving up too much momentum. Even with Intimidate though, Granbull's lack of resistances, poor Special Defense, and low Speed make it difficult for it to keep up with both attackers and walls alike.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Granbull has quite a large movepool, but most of its options are not very reliable or can't be used effectively with its stats. Granbull has Double-Edge to hit harder than Return, but it really doesn't appreciate the recoil considering it has no reliable recovery. Super Fang wears down walls that Granbull struggles with, but Granbull is often too slow to properly use it. A Choice Band set is also viable but is generally outclassed by Zangoose, which sports the same coverage as Granbull but is much faster and hits harder with its Normal-type STAB. Granbull also has access to Quick Feet to increase its Speed when statused, but Ursaring, which also has Quick Feet, has both better Attack and Speed than Granbull as well as access to Swords Dance. Although Trick Room is generally a poor strategy in NU, Granbull can work very well on Trick Room teams because of its low Speed, its monstrous Attack, and the support it brings to help Trick Room teams function. With access to Bulk Up and Work Up, Granbull can boost its stats to further increase its offensive presence, but it's too slow to use either effectively. Both also either replace a coverage move or replace a support move, which Granbull does not really want to give up. Finally, like most Normal-types, Granbull has many special attacking options, but base 60 Special Attack is not really usable even if boosted by Work Up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Granbull is not very hard to counter due to its exploitable typing, low Special Defense, and lack of reliable recovery. Fighting-types in general check Granbull. Choice Band Sawk can OHKO with Close Combat even after Intimidate, and Gurdurr can take Granbull's attacks, gain a Guts boost if it switches in on Thunder Wave or Toxic, and recover its health with Drain Punch. If Granbull is using Close Combat, any Ghost-type will be immune to its attacks and only have to watch out for Thunder Wave or Toxic. Misdreavus is the best option to wall Close Combat Granbull as it can shrug off status with Heal Bell. If using Crunch, Rock-and Steel-types, such as Probopass and Bastiodon, are free to set up Stealth Rock as they take almost nothing from Granbull's attacks. Alomomola can wear Granbull down with Scald or Waterfall then heal with Wish, only having to worry about Toxic because it takes almost nothing from Granbull's attacks otherwise. Tangela and Vileplume work similarly to Alomomola and can also put Granbull to sleep with Sleep Powder, while Vileplume can also shrug off status with Aromatherapy. Granbull's most exploitable weakness is its Special Defense; any decently powered STAB special attack can knock out Granbull pretty easily.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Support": {
        "description": "<p>This set is Granbull's only set that isn't entirely outclassed by something else in the tier. Return is Granbull's main attacking move, as anything that doesn't resist it will be taking a lot of damage. Next, there is a choice to be made for coverage between Close Combat and Crunch. Close Combat hits the Rock- and Steel-types that would resist Return but leaves Granbull walled by Ghost-types. Crunch hits Ghost-types super effectively, most notably, Golurk but it leaves Granbull walled by Rock- and Steel-types. Heal Bell is the move that gives Granbull its niche as an offensive supporter by healing itself and its team of status. The last slot should be either Thunder Wave or Toxic. Thunder Wave helps alleviate Granbull's speed problem while also slowing down faster threats for the rest of Granbull's team, while Toxic should always be used with Close Combat so Granbull isn't completely walled by Ghost-types, specifically Golurk, which is immune to both Close Combat and Thunder Wave.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is chosen to maximize Granbull's attacking power, though an Impish nature can be used if more physical bulk is desired. All three offensive moves can be used on this set along with one of the support moves, but this option is mostly outclassed by other Normal-types such as Miltank. Body Slam can be used over Return for its paralysis chance, but Granbull will miss the extra power, not to mention the fact that Body Slam is illegal with Close Combat. Even with Intimidate, Granbull is still afraid of Fighting-type attacks, so Misdreavus and Musharna make excellent defensive partners to shore up this weakness with the former being able to burn foes with Will-O-Wisp and the latter being able to set up with Calm Mind. Offensively, anything that can get rid of the Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types that wall Granbull make a good partner as well. The best offensive partner for Granbull would be Golurk. Golurk can switch in on Fighting-type attacks that threaten Granbull and take out all the Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types that Granbull cannot hit hard with its STAB attacks. It also benefits from Thunder Wave slowing down faster threats or Toxic wearing down walls. Skuntank can't touch Rock- and Steel-types, but it can Pursuit trap the Ghost-types that Granbull struggles with. Many Pokemon appreciate Granbull's Heal Bell support and its ability to lure in and Toxic physical walls as well as its ability to paralyze faster Pokemon.</p>"

  "Combusken": {
    "overview": "<p>Combusken is a unique threat, one of the only viable Pokemon with Speed Boost in NU with a powerful STAB combination. These factors combined make Combusken a fantastic late-game cleaner to finish off the opponent's weakened team. It can also set up with Swords Dance while forcing out an opponent and immediately become threatening despite its weak offenses. However, Combusken isn't very bulky, making it rather weak to priority, and opposing priority users have to be removed before Combusken can even attempt to sweep. Similarly, it isn't very strong, making it hard to beat bulkier opponents, and it needs to run a Speed increasing nature in order to outrun the most common Choice Scarf users at +2.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bulk Up can be used to boost Combusken's defenses, but Combusken is still pretty frail after a boost, making Swords Dance the superior option most of the time. Hone Claws can be used to give Combusken an accuracy boost, but the inaccurate moves in its arsenal are specially based, and Combusken's offensive stats are too weak to go down the mixed route. Baton Pass can be used to pass Swords Dance boosts to Combusken's teammates, but Baton Pass's illegality with Speed Boost makes Ninjask a better option for this role. Thunder Punch can be used to defeat Frillish, Pelipper, and Mantine, while Rock Slide can be used to hit Lampent, but these moves do not provide much coverage outside of these specific checks. Shadow Claw is an option to hit Frillish and Lampent hard, but similarly, it is useless apart from these uncommon threats. Vacuum Wave can be used as a priority move, but Combusken rarely needs it because it already has Speed Boost, it is very weak, and the move is illegal with Speed Boost. Endure and Reversal sound like a fun gimmick, but the combination doesn't solve Combusken's issue with priority moves, and they are illegal with Speed Boost. Finally, Will-O-Wisp and Feather Dance can compose a gimmicky support set, but Combusken has better things to be doing with such a great ability, and other physical walls such as Misdreavus would perform this role this better.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Frillish and Lampent completely wall Combusken with their resistances or immunities both of its STAB moves. Meanwhile, Frillish threatens Combusken back with Scald or Night Shade, while Lampent simply sets up against it. Mantine and Pelipper also easily tank hits from both sets and can hit it back hard and heal the damage they take with either Rest or Roost. Weezing, Alomomola, and Garbodor wall the Swords Dance sets with ease, and Alomomola can even retaliate with a strong Waterfall. Bulky variants of Altaria and specially defensive Ludicolo easily defeat the special attacking set. Dragonair can also tank hits from the special set while setting up against and eventually beating Combusken. Grumpig, Musharna, Gothorita, and Hypno are bulky Psychic-types that easily tank moves from both sets and hit back extremely hard with Psychic. Priority users, such as Carracosta and Swords Dance Samurott, can easily pick off Combusken no matter how many Speed boosts it has. Fast Choice Scarf users, such as Charizard and Tauros, can outspeed Combusken even at +2 and OHKO back with a super effective move, but these Pokemon have to be wary of switching into it. However, Charizard can still switch in freely because it resists Combusken's STAB moves and can OHKO it with Air Slash.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>With this set, Combusken can come in on something it forces out and set up a Swords Dance, giving it a huge boost in Attack and making it difficult to stop in combination with Speed Boost. With Eviolite giving it usable bulk, Combusken can set up more easily in a pinch against Pokemon it can't force out. Protect is extremely useful to gather additional Speed boosts, and it also protects it from Fake Out from Pokemon such as Kangaskhan. Flare Blitz is the preferred Fire-type STAB move, as it packs the most power despite the recoil damage. Sky Uppercut is used as a secondary STAB move, hitting Pokemon that resist Fire, such as Rock- and Water-types.</p> <p>A Jolly nature on this set is required to outspeed base 95 Speed Pokemon at +1, including Primeape and Sawsbuck. This allows Combusken to revenge kill these threats with Protect and its STAB moves. Eviolite is the item of choice for this set because it gives Combusken some bulk to allow it to set up and is useful to take weak or resisted priority moves such as Sucker Punch. Life Orb is another option for additional power, but the recoil when combined with Flare Blitz can be cut a sweep short. Fire Punch can be used over Flare Blitz if the recoil doesn't appeal to you, but this is not recommended due to its low Base Power. Brick Break can be used over Sky Uppercut for slightly greater accuracy, but it is also weak in comparison. Substitute is an option over Protect, allowing Combusken to avoid status moves, but the recoil with Flare Blitz adds up quickly and it does not reliably shield Combusken from Fake Out. Combusken appreciates entry hazards to nab a few additional KOs; for example, Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes is needed to OHKO Tangela with +2 Flare Blitz. Teammates that can provide these entry hazards include Garbodor and Golurk. Combusken also appreciates having teammates that grant it setup opportunities. Liepard and Muk can use Encore and Memento, respectively, to allow Combusken to have an easier time setting up a Swords Dance. Gothorita is an excellent teammate, as it can trap and remove walls such as Weezing and Alomomola to clear the path for Combusken. Pokemon that can set up dual screens are also good teammates to shield Combusken from priority and give it time to set up; even with an Eviolite equipped, Combusken is still frail. Examples of dual screens users include Gardevoir, Serperior, Ampharos, and Solrock. Finally, Combusken has trouble with bulky Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Frillish. Teammates that can eliminate them, such as Skuntank, are good partners.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Rather than setting up with Swords Dance, this set's powerful moves allow Combusken to hit hard right off the bat. Protect is crucial to run on Combusken, as it allows Combusken to boost its Speed for free and scout for the opponent's moves while shielding from Fake Out. Fire Blast is Combusken's main STAB move, and its power makes up for its only decent offensive stats. Focus Blast is the secondary STAB and hits Rock- and Water-types, along with Miltank and Munchlax, which both resist Fire Blast thanks to Thick Fat. Substitute is the preferred move in the fourth moveslot, and Combusken can find setup opportunities against the likes of Tangela and Roselia. Substitute allows Combusken to avoid status moves and protect it from revenge killers before it has gathered enough boosts. It also acts as a safety net in case Combusken misses with its inaccurate STAB moves.</p> <p>A Life Orb and Modest nature are used on Combusken because it is moderately weak otherwise. To give an example, without the Life Orb, Combusken cannot even secure the OHKO on Choice Scarf Primeape after Stealth Rock damage. However, it should be noted that Combusken is even frailer without an Eviolite and takes huge damage even from resisted priority moves such as Sucker Punch, and its powerful moves have moderately low accuracy. Flamethrower and Hidden Power Fighting can be used over Fire Blast and Focus Blast for additional accuracy, but they are pretty weak and therefore should seldom ever be considered. A Timid nature can also be considered to allow Combusken to outspeed base 95 Speed Pokemon after a Speed boost. Hidden Power Grass can be used over Substitute to defeat Alomomola and Seismitoad without having to resort to the inaccurate Focus Blast. Skuntank is a good partner, as it gets rid of Lampent, Frillish, and other Ghost-types that trouble Combusken. It can also defeat Psychic-types, such as Grumpig and Musharna, that threaten Combusken. Entry hazard support is very helpful in order to help Combusken nab a few extra KOs. For example, Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes enables Combusken to OHKO Audino with Focus Blast. Golurk deserves a special mention for beating opposing Psychic-types and laying the entry hazards that Combusken needs.</p>"

  "Beautifly": {
    "overview": "<p>While Quiver Dance gives Beautifly a chance to act as a sweeper, its awful typing, which gives it a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, horrible bulk, and subpar Speed make it difficult to use. Even with Quiver Dance, Beautifly has difficulty standing out from other Pokemon of the same type such as Butterfree, which has access to Sleep Powder and Tinted Lens, and Masquerain, which has Intimidate and Baton Pass. Beautifly has access to a situational ability in Swarm, but even while taking Swarm into consideration, Beautifly is still overshadowed by other Quiver Dance users.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Despite its barren movepool, Beautifly has few other options it can attempt to use. Support options such as Whirlwind, Morning Sun, and Safeguard are available, but they are gimmicky and are difficult to use effectively with Beautifly's mediocre bulk. Hidden Power Flying can be used for STAB thanks to its good neutral coverage alongside Bug Buzz while also hitting Fighting-types harder than Psychic. Shadow Ball can hit Ghost-types, but it won't do much to most of them anyway. Giga Drain can be used for slight recovery and coverage on Seismitoad and Golurk, but doesn't do much else. Substitute can help Beautifly set up and protect itself from status, but this will decrease Beautifly's lifespan significantly if using a Life Orb, forcing it to give up much-needed power by using Leftovers. Lastly, Safeguard can protect Beautifly and its teammates from status, but Beautifly should be focusing on boosting against foes that can't do much to it anyways.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Beautifly loses 50% of its health on the switch if Stealth Rock is up, which heavily impedes its sweeping capabilities. Very specially bulky Pokemon also work wonders in keeping Beautifly in check; specially defensive Altaria, for example, can wall Beautifly even after it sets up. Mandibuzz, Regice, and Lickilicky are slightly shakier checks, as after Stealth Rock damage and one layer of Spikes, they can be 2HKOed even with Leftovers. However, they can scare it out with by threatening paralysis or just by phazing it. Priority from the likes of Carracosta, Samurott, and Skuntank will stop Beautifly in its tracks. Common Choice Scarf Pokemon, including Braviary, Sawk, and Primeape, can destroy Beautifly with super effective attacks and outspeed it even after a boost. Choice Scarf Charizard gets a special mention because it resists two of the three moves Beautifly most commonly carries and can retaliate with a STAB Fire Blast. All in all, Beautifly is not a difficult Pokemon to defeat, and most teams fare well enough against it.</p>",

      "Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Functioning as a late-game sweeper, Beautifly has the ability to clean up weakened teams with its great boosting move. Quiver Dance is a given, as Beautifly needs both the Speed and the Special Attack boost to clean up, and the Special Defense boost will help it set up against weaker special attackers, such as Alomomola carrying Scald, as well as Wartortle. After one Quiver Dance with a Timid nature, Beautifly outspeeds Zebstrika, Serperior, and Tauros. Bug Buzz is the main STAB move of choice, with good neutral coverage and a chance to lower the opponent's Special Defense. Hidden Power Ground hits the Steel-, Rock-, Poison-, and Fire-types that resist Bug Buzz. The last slot is given to Psychic, a reasonably powerful attack that hits levitating Poison-types, such as Weezing, and Fighting-types for super effective damage.</p> <p>As Beautifly is 4x weak to Stealth Rock, hazard control is essential for its survival. Good choices for partners are Torkoal and Wartortle, which can both provide a free switch-in for Beautifly with Yawn. Sawk can also be used to break through most Stealth Rock leads. Natu, on the other hand, can be used to reflect hazards, though compounding weaknesses means that it will be crucial to carry Pokemon that resist Rock-, Electric-, and Ice-type attacks. A slow U-turn, Volt Switch, or Baton Pass will also help bring Beautifly in unscathed. Ampharos, Eelektross, Probopass, and Musharna work well in this case. Beautifly hates very specially bulky Pokemon, such as Audino, Lickilicky, and Mandibuzz, so Choice Band Sawk and Primeape are good partners to take out Lickilicky with Close Combat and Mandibuzz with repeated Ice Punches. Entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field are necessary to make up for Beautifly's lack of sheer power. For example, at +1, Lickilicky and Audino are both cleanly 2HKOed after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. Partners such as Garbodor and Golurk are good choices for this. Beautifly needs a Life Orb to have a chance to 2HKO Lickilicky and Audino after Stealth Rock and a Quiver Dance. However, if you can keep Stealth Rock off the field, Focus Sash is an option to guarantee a Quiver Dance boost against more offensively-oriented teams.</p>"

In addition, it can also run unorthodox options such as Will-O-Wisp to cripple its would-be answers such as Mandibuzz or Skuntank. Do keep in mind, however, that Gardevoir is incredibly frail, and thus despite its versatility and usefulness, it cannot check the ever prominent Fighting-types as well as bulkier Psychic-types such as Duosion and Musharna.

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gardevoir can possibly run defensive sets have some potential thanks to Gardevoir's access to Will-O-Wisp and Wish, but other Pokemon, such as Musharna, Lickilicky, and Audino, have better mixed bulk. Lickilicky and Audino also have better defensive typing. A defensive Calm Mind set would also be run better by Musharna, further limiting Gardevoir's other set options. However, Gardevoir does have some some other move options that it can utilize well. Magic Coat can be used to reflect status moves, Taunt, and entry hazard moves back to the opposing side. Pain Split and Wish can also be used on any of Gardevoir's sets, though offensive sets typically prefer a move with better overall utility. Rain Dance and Sunny Day can be nice options to use on weather-based teams, especially on the dual screens set. Gardevoir sometimes struggles to find room for them, but if it can, both weather-inducing moves are very helpful. Charge Beam might sound like a cool option, but Calm Mind is typically better thanks to its consistency and the added Special Defense boost. Icy Wind can be a nice choice to slow down faster opponents on the switch, but normally only slower Pokemon like to switch into Gardevoir anyways. Shadow Ball is also a decent option in terms of coverage, but the coverage against Psychic- and Dark-types that Signal Beam provides is usually better. Finally, Gardevoir has access to three status-inducing moves, Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, and Thunder Wave, which can all help it support its team if you can find room for any of them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Destiny Bond and Memento both make Gardevoir fairly difficult to defeat without major trouble, but it can definitely still be done. Dark-types, especially Skuntank, Mandibuzz, and Scraggy, are all reliable checks for Gardevoir, as it struggles to muscle past the three of them. Meanwhile, Skuntank and Mandibuzz can both Taunt Gardevoir to prevent it from using Destiny Bond or setting up Calm Mind or dual screens, while Scraggy can take a hit and set up alongside it. Special walls and tanks, such as Lickilicky, Audino, Mantine, and Regice, can all take a hit and either hit Gardevoir back with a coverage move or use Toxic against it. Metang can also take a hit from Gardevoir and hit it back with a strong Meteor Mash, while the dual screens set cannot use Memento against it because of Clear Body. Finally, if you are unable to wall Gardevoir well, it's still pretty easy to revenge kill it because of its average base 80 Speed. Almost any Choice Scarf user, especially Primeape, who can U-turn against it in case it wants to switch, can revenge kill Gardevoir fairly easily. Priority users also tend to make quick work of Gardevoir. Kangaskhan is able to beat it with Fake Out and Sucker Punch, while more defensive priority users, such as Metang and Piloswine, can both take a hit and pick off a weakened Gardevoir.</p>",

      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Gardevoir's most effective set is a simple offensive one that allows it to utilize its great Special Attack and good support moves. Psychic is first on the set, as it is Gardevoir's most powerful STAB move. Signal Beam grants it coverage against Dark-types and opposing Psychic-types with a slight chance of confusing any checks or counters that might switch in. Focus Blast gives Gardevoir a more powerful coverage move to use against Dark-types, particularly Skuntank and Mandibuzz, which are both hit neutrally by Signal Beam, while also offering coverage against Steel-types and the bulky Normal-types that commonly switch into it. Finally, Destiny Bond is a great move for Gardevoir to use in order to eliminate any Pokemon that might be threatening for your team. It also gives Gardevoir a reliable way to beat its main check, Skuntank, to open up a sweep for another Psychic-type later on.</p> <p>A Timid nature is used on this set in order to outspeed common base 80 and 85 Speed Pokemon that often run a positive attacking nature, such as Sawk and Braviary, as well as Swift Swim Ludicolo in the rain thanks to Trace. Life Orb is used for the necessary added power, as Gardevoir's poor physical defense and susceptibility to hazards make it fairly easy to wear down anyway. A few other moves work well on this set in place of Destiny Bond, such as Calm Mind, Healing Wish, and Memento, and can be adjusted according to your team's needs. Finally, Thunderbolt can be used over Signal Beam in order to hit Mandibuzz for super effective damage on the switch, but the lack of super effective coverage against opposing Psychic-types can be costly.</p> <p>Gardevoir functions best on Psychic-spam teams where it can take out opposing Dark-types with Destiny Bond in order to allow another Psychic-type to come in later on and sweep. For this reason, Calm Mind Musharna makes a really good partner for it. Additionally, as they share many of the same checks and counters, Life Orb Destiny Bond Haunter forms a cool offensive core with Gardevoir, as you can sacrifice one to eliminate the checks of the other. Gardevoir also appreciates the help of a Fighting-type, such as Sawk or Gurdurr, to take on opposing Dark-types so that it doesn't have to use Destiny Bond to beat them. Spikes and Stealth Rock support are also greatly appreciated for Gardevoir to net the 2HKO on special walls such as Altaria, Lickilicky, and Hypno. As such, Regirock and Garbodor are great partners to set up these hazards. Regirock can also support its team by taking on Normal-type attacks, while Garbodor can serve as a way of defeating Dark-types with its great bulk and Rocky Helmet.</p>"
      },
      "SubCM": {
        "description": "<p>With a Calm Mind set, Gardevoir can use its good special bulk and Speed to set up against weaker special attackers such as Tangela or Probopass. Once Gardevoir has attained a boost or two, its great Special Attack can break through many of the tier's bulkiest walls, while its high Special Defense stat can help it set up even further. Substitute helps Gardevoir by blocking status moves and preventing it from being revenge killed. Psychic is Gardevoir's best STAB move, while its last slot is primarily for coverage. Signal Beam should be the first choice, as it gives Gardevoir coverage against Psychic-types and Dark-types. It also gives Gardevoir a fighting chance to beat Musharna in Calm Mind wars. However, Thunderbolt can be used in the last slot as a way for Gardevoir to defeat Mandibuzz and bulky Water-types with greater ease.</p> <p>An offensive EV spread is used on this set to give Gardevoir some immediate power and to make it less reliant on setting up in order to deal decent damage. A more defensive spread is an option, but even with defensive investment, Gardevoir still isn't able to take physical hits very well. Leftovers is used to compensate for the HP lost when using Substitute.</p> <p>This particular set struggles to beat many Dark-types in the tier. If Gardevoir uses Signal Beam, it loses coverage against Mandibuzz, while if it uses Thunderbolt, it loses coverage against Shiftry, Zweilous, and Cacturne. On top of this, regardless of its choice of coverage move, Gardevoir struggles against Skuntank. Sawk and Gurdurr both make great partners, as they both have a great matchup against all of the aforementioned Dark-types. Bug- and Ghost-types often cause problems for Gardevoir as well. Weezing and Klang make great choices to take these on, as Weezing can cripple physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp, while Klang can become another bulky sweeper in case Gardevoir is taken out. Finally, Gardevoir is very capable of taking out opposing walls and Fighting-types, a quality that offensive Normal-types greatly appreciate. For this reason, Tauros, Kangaskhan, and Zangoose work very well alongside Gardevoir.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>With a dual screens set, Gardevoir is able to aid its teammates in setting up and thus works best on hyper offense teams. Gardevoir's combination of good Speed and access to the rare Memento distinguishes it from other dual screens users in NU. Reflect and Light Screen are used to double Gardevoir's teammates' defenses in order to help them set up and sweep opposing teams. Memento gives a free switch to a sweeper and further helps partners in setting up through lowering the opponent's Attack and Special Attack by two stages. The last slot is far less important, but both moves listed can be helpful depending on what you would prefer. Taunt can be used to keep opponents from setting up, Taunting Gardevoir, and phazing the partner you bring in after using Memento. Psychic is also great to help keep Gardevoir from being Taunted by faster users of the move and to break Substitutes of faster foes trying to dodge Memento.</p> <p>Because of Gardevoir's relative frailty, it might seem like a good idea to invest in defenses alongside HP; however, setting up dual screens before the opponent can attack makes up for a lack of investment. A fast Memento is also important to keep opponents from picking off Gardevoir before it can use the move. For these reasons, it is best to fully invest in Speed and HP. If using Psychic, a spread of max Special Attack and Speed can be used instead, but it is typically passed over in favor of extra bulk. Light Clay should be the only item used on this set, as the few extra turns that dual screens are up can make all the difference later in the game. Gardevoir can use a couple of other support moves on this set depending on what you prefer to cover. Healing Wish can be used over Memento to give an offensive partner a second chance to sweep, while Safeguard can be used in the last slot in order to keep offensive partners from being hit with a status move, though losing a turn of Reflect and Light Screen might be unappealing.</p> <p>Frail sweepers make the best partners for Gardevoir, as without them, the dual screens it sets wouldn't be nearly as useful. Specifically, Belly Drum Linoone, Swords Dance Samurott, and Shell Smash Carracosta and Gorebyss make great partners because of their ability to set up quickly and take full advantage of the dual screens. Hazards are also nice, as Taunt, Memento, and most frail sweepers tend to cause many switches. Offensive teams with Gardevoir appreciate Garbodor for its ability to set Spikes and Golem for its near-guaranteed use of Stealth Rock thanks to Sturdy.</p>"

  "Exploud": {
    "overview": "<p>Exploud has only one role in the NU metagame, and that is being a specially based wallbreaker. Scrappy allows Exploud to break through the Ghost-types that trouble most Normal-type attackers without missing a beat. With a decent offensive movepool rich with coverage options and above average attacking stats, it would seem like it excels at this role. Sadly, while it has the right moves to threaten many defensive Pokemon, its offenses are just shy of being powerful in comparison to the average offensive threat. Exploud's low Speed and mediocre defenses are another sour note, as it cannot stand against the power of offensive teams. Together, these factors usually make Exploud a liability in NU's fast-paced metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Exploud has a decent movepool that contains interesting options such as Shadow Ball, Extrasensory, and Icy Wind, but the moves already listed are usually the best options. Taunt can be useful to allow Exploud to act as an anti-lead and also disrupt stall teams though. Expert Belt can be used to boost Exploud's moves without causing recoil, but Life Orb's boost is generally superior because Exploud doesn't take attacks very well and Expert Belt doesn't boost its STAB. Choice Specs can also be used, but Exploud is very weak for a Choice Specs attacker and appreciates being able to change moves. Soundproof is somewhat helpful on Baton Pass chains, as the ability gives Exploud a helpful immunity to Roar and Perish Song.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Specially defensive Altaria is a decent counter if Exploud lacks Ice Beam, as it isn't 2HKOed by any other move. Fighting-types such as Sawk and Primeape easily OHKO Exploud, though most can't safely switch in. Gurdurr is a notable exception, as it can take any hit thanks to its good bulk and recover with Drain Punch. While it has excellent neutral coverage against most of the tier, Exploud is not that powerful, so many Pokemon can simply take a hit and retaliate back hard. As Exploud is relatively slow and frail, most offensive Pokemon can easily outspeed and take it out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<p>Exploud's above average attacking stats make it a viable wallbreaker. Hyper Voice provides Exploud with STAB and works well in conjunction with Scrappy to deter Ghost-types from switching in. Surf hits the Rock-types that resist Hyper Voice, while Fire Blast targets Steel-types. Low Kick takes advantage of Exploud's usable Attack and hits several of the special walls that take Exploud's other moves easily, most notably Lickilicky and Regice.</p> <p>The power boost provided by Life Orb makes it the only viable item. With Life Orb, Exploud can 2HKO Lickilicky after Stealth Rock damage with Low Kick. The Speed EVs allow Exploud to outspeed Modest Ludicolo. Unfortunately, it is unable to outspeed Timid Ludicolo or any other mildly fast attacker, making it vulnerable to offensive teams. Hammer Arm is a very viable option over Low Kick because it can inflict more damage upon Audino and Zweilous, but the Speed drop means that Exploud will still lose to Miltank. Ice Beam can hit Altaria hard, but it doesn't have much use otherwise. Entry hazard setters are very useful for Exploud to make up for its average power. Golurk and Seismitoad are good teammates to set up Stealth Rock, which allows Exploud to gain KOs on Misdreavus, Lickilicky, and Torkoal. Garbodor and Roselia are good Spikes users, giving Exploud the opportunity to score KOs on several Pokemon, including Golurk, Bastiodon, and Alomomola. Pokemon that enjoy the removal of physical walls are good teammates for Exploud, with Kangaskhan, Golurk, and Samurott being good examples. Fighting-types, such as Sawk and Primeape, are notable for appreciating Exploud's ability to beat Misdreavus and Weezing. Teammates that can handle opposing Fighting-types, such as Musharna and Misdreavus, are very beneficial. Misdreavus is especially helpful because it can also act as a spinblocker to prevent the entry hazards Exploud benefits from being easily removed.</p>"

  "Mawile": {
    "overview": "<p>Mawile suffers from having mediocre stats and a bad offensive typing. However, Mawile has decent offensive power courtesy of Sheer Force and possible Swords Dance boosts. It is also a very important member of Baton Pass teams due to its good defensive typing, access to Intimidate, and useful stat boosting moves. While its uses are very specific, being one of the few pure Steel-types in NU gives Mawile a decent niche in supporting its team. These niches limit Mawile to certain teams, but the different roles it plays make it stand out among its Steel-type brethren.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A support set utilizing Stealth Rock, Pain Split, Seismic Toss, and Taunt is viable, but it is pretty mediocre compared to support sets that other Steel-types can run as Mawile has unimpressive bulk. Ice Punch is a usable move as it can 2HKO Tangela after a boost, but Iron Head also accomplishes this with Stealth Rock damage. A bulky Swords Dance set with maximum physical bulk and Intimidate, using Substitute, Iron Head, and Sucker Punch, combines Mawile's offensive and defensive capabilities into a single set, but Mawile is pitifully weak without any Swords Dance boosts. Knock Off can cripple Pokemon that rely on Eviolite or Choice items, but Mawile is already strapped for moveslots as it is. Rock Slide hits most Fire-types hard, as well as Bug- and Flying-types, but most of them take a lot of damage from Mawile's other moves already. Body Slam can be used on a defensive set as it provides paralysis support to Mawile's team, but it is very weak. With Intimidate buffering Mawile's physical bulk, it can feasibly set up Rain Dance or Sunny Day, but other Pokemon such as Volbeat can set up weather more reliably. A SubPunch set can be used, but Mawile is really too weak for this set to be very threatening. Mawile has an assortment of special moves, with Fire Blast and Grass Knot being the most notable for OHKOing Tangela and hitting defensive variants of Seismitoad, respectively. However, using special moves means Mawile cannot use its physical moves effectively due to the lack of investment, so it can no longer beat many Pokemon outside of these specific targets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fighting-types such as Sawk and Gurdurr threaten to OHKO Mawile with their STAB moves, while Mawile cannot threaten them even with Sucker Punch due to their resistance to it. Gurdurr even has Mach Punch to threaten the Baton Pass set even if it has received Speed boosts. Throh counters the Baton Pass set through use of Circle Throw, though it is only a check to the Swords Dance set. Seismitoad resists Mawile's STAB moves, is immune to Thunder Punch, and can threaten with its STAB Ground-type moves. Samurott can also check Mawile due to its resistance to Iron Head, but it cannot safely switch in due to ThunderPunch. Braviary threatens all of Mawile's sets with Superpower, and Defiant even gives it a boost from Intimidate, but it cannot safely switch in against the offensive set. Due to Mawile's weakness to common moves such as Earthquake and Close Combat, as well as its low special bulk, most powerful offensive Pokemon that can tank a Sucker Punch can revenge kill Mawile, especially special attackers such as Ludicolo and Charizard. Misdreavus cannot switch in against the offensive set, but it can threaten to Will-O-Wisp it and Taunt the Baton Pass set. Countering the Baton Pass set is difficult as it can pass to teammates that deal with many normal counters and it is usually paired with other dedicated Baton Pass users that can grant it Speed and defensive boosts. Priority Encore users, such as Liepard and Volbeat, can stop Mawile in its tracks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>This set makes use of Sheer Force-boosted attacks to make Mawile a decent offensive threat. Mawile has opportunities to set up Swords Dance against defensive Pokemon such as Metang, Alomomola, and Garbodor. Iron Head provides Mawile with a powerful STAB move, and Sheer Force gives it decent power even without a Swords Dance boost. Sucker Punch isn't boosted by Sheer Force, but the priority is very important as Mawile is rather slow. Thunder Punch has the power to 2HKO Alomomola after a Swords Dance boost, preventing it from walling Mawile. However, Substitute is a very viable alternative in order to block status moves from Pokemon such as Misdreavus and Tangela which would otherwise cripple Mawile. Substitute also allows Mawile to set up a Swords Dance safely.</p> <p>Jolly is necessary to outspeed Adamant Rampardos and Zweilous as well as standard Misdreavus. Life Orb is the best item for this set as Sheer Force negates the recoil when Mawile uses any of its attacks except for Sucker Punch. Crunch is a viable offensive move as it is boosted by Sheer Force and doesn't fail against status moves, making it a more reliable option against Misdreavus. Taunt works similarly to Substitute in preventing most status moves, but it doesn't let Mawile set up on weak attacks. Fire Fang provides coverage against the Steel-type Pokemon that can wall Mawile, but it generally prefers the help of its teammates to deal with these threats. Stealth Rock support from teammates such as Seismitoad and Golem is necessary to allow Mawile to 2HKO Tangela with a boosted Iron Head. As Fighting-type Pokemon such as Sawk and Gurdurr threaten Mawile and resist Sucker Punch, Pokemon that can handle them such as Misdreavus, Musharna, and Garbodor are good options for teammates. Water-types, such as Seismitoad and Samurott, are also good teammates as they can handle Torkoal and other Fire-types well.</p>"

      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>Mawile's Steel typing gives it an immunity to Clear Smog and Toxic Spikes, making it a very important member of dedicated Baton Pass teams. Iron Defense is the most useful boost that Mawile can pass on such teams to enhance their overall survivability, and it also takes advantage of Mawile's excellent set of resistances. Of course, Swords Dance is a better option on any other team, as defensive boosts generally don't make too much of an impact on their own. Substitute allows Mawile to block status moves, and after a few Iron Defense boosts, its Substitutes are difficult to break with physical attacks. The best thing about Substitute is that it can also be Baton Passed to Mawile's teammates, so it is not limited to only supporting physically offensive teammates. Taunt is important in order to prevent Mawile from being Taunted itself and also prevents moves such as Toxic Spikes, Roar, Perish Song, and Encore from disrupting Baton Pass chains.</p> <p>The Speed EVs and Jolly nature are necessary to allow Mawile to outspeed Adamant Torterra and standard Misdreavus and Baton Pass before they cripple it. Leftovers is Mawile's only form of recovery, and works well with Iron Defense and Intimidate to allow Mawile to create multiple sturdy Substitutes against resisted physical attacks. Iron Head can be used over Taunt to prevent Mawile from losing immediately against priority Encore users such as Volbeat and Liepard. It is also the better move to use alongside Swords Dance if Mawile is a standalone Baton Pass user, as it can take advantage of the boosts Mawile sets up. A fully physically defensive spread with an Impish nature can make the most of Mawile's defensive typing, but it usually wants the Speed to outpace certain threats such as Torterra so that it can Baton Pass away. Mental Herb is a viable item to deal with an otherwise crippling Taunt or Encore, but it only works once.</p> <p>A dedicated Baton Pass team is the best home for this set, as the focus of such teams are to accumulate multiple Speed and defensive boosts. Ninjask is particularly important as a teammate as it reliably accumulates Speed boosts to pass to Mawile, allowing Mawile to move first most of the time. Mr. Mime is also an important teammate as it brings Soundproof to the table, which prevents Roar and certain users of Perish Song from ruining the Baton Pass chain. Gorebyss is also a very useful teammate as it can pass Amnesia boosts and appreciates the Iron Defense boosts Mawile passes to allow it to handle opposing Ground-types. Great Baton Pass recipients are also very important to actually make use of the boosts that Mawile and its teammates accumulate. Stored Power Musharna, Suction Cups Cradily and Octillery, and Marowak are all viable recipients that appreciate increased Speed and defenses. Outside of a dedicated Baton Pass team, other teammates include Pokemon that appreciate the specific boosts that Mawile passes. Physically frail Pokemon, such as Muk and Gardevoir, appreciate Iron Defense boosts, while physical attackers, such as Kangaskhan and Golurk, appreciate Swords Dance boosts.</p>"

Any support set or a more dedicated Baton Pass set is better left to Minun.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Piloswine is a good immediate answer to Plusle, and it's strong enough to threaten most of the Pokemon that Plusle would generally want to Baton Pass to as well. There's actually a small amount of Pokemon that won't mind taking a +2 Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Ice, but most that resist Thunderbolt still make a good answer, particularly Grass-types like Roselia. Revenge killing is the best way to both eliminate Plusle and any potential threat it could Baton Pass to. Choice Scarf Primeape, Zebstrika, Tauros, and Scolipede are all decent answers.

While Plusle is pretty fast for NU, it has some serious trouble with Choice Scarf users, predominantly Primeape, since it can't withstand any of its attacks and won't be able to pass on its Nasty Plot boost.

You need to do everything in your power to prevent that Baton Pass from happening (remember that Pursuit does not work on Baton Pass, so don't have that as your solution). Failing that, you need to smite whatever Minun is going to Baton Pass to.

While it has great special bulk, which allows it to take several special attacks, as well as a wide movepool that makes it unpredictable, its ability in Color Change makes it extremely easy to play around, letting opponents hit it for super effective damage when they normally couldn't. The fact that its STAB is constantly changing also means that it has to rely on Foul Play to deal consistent damage. Therefore, Kecleon really only works as a bulky Pokemon, and not a good one at that.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Kecleon can support the team with various field effects, such as weather and Trick Room. It can also carry a Choice item along with Trick to cripple opposing walls, but due to Kecleon's lack of power and low Speed, this isn't recommended. Sucker Punch is a powerful priority move to pick off weakened foes and somewhat mitigates Kecleon's low Speed. Shadow Sneak can also be used, but it is much weaker. Disable is a decent surprise move and often comes in handy by Disabling Ghost- and Dragon-type moves and preventing the opponent from taking advantage of Color Change. However, Kecleon's low Speed means prediction is required. Aqua Tail can be used to defeat opposing Stealth Rock users such as Camerupt and Golem. Knock Off is an option to cripple certain opposing Pokemon by taking away their items. Kecleon can be used as an offensive Pokemon and has access to boosting moves such as Nasty Plot and Hone Claws. However, Kecleon is weak and outclassed by many other offensive Pokemon. Counter can be used to surprise physical attackers in tandem with a Focus Sash. Kecleon also has a wide range of special attacks at its disposal, but its horrible Special Attack stat means it can't make use of this.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Almost any Pokemon that has more than one move and isn't wielding a Choice item can easily take advantage of Color Change by first attacking with a coverage move to change Kecleon's type and following up with a move that is super effective. Before Kecleon changes its typing, Fighting-type attackers, such as Sawk and Gurdurr, can obliterate it easily, although Sawk does not enjoy switching into Thunder Wave. Unless Kecleon is carrying Magic Coat, it is shut down entirely by Taunt, especially from a Pokemon that does not mind Foul Play. For example, Mandibuzz and Skuntank can easily stop Kecleon this way. Mandibuzz can then proceed to Toxic stall it to death, and Skuntank can play around Color Change with two different STAB moves. Most Poison- and Steel-types can defeat Kecleon as they are immune to Toxic, and Ground-types are immune to Thunder Wave. A good example of a counter would be Probopass, which is immune to Toxic, takes little damage from Foul Play, and can play around Color Change using Power Gem and Earth Power. Finally, almost every physical STAB move can at least come close to KOing Kecleon if it doesn't resist the hit because it is very frail physically.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Kecleon can make use of its above average special bulk to set up Stealth Rock in front of special attackers. Color Change also allows it to wall several Pokemon such as special Samurott lacking Taunt and Choice Scarf Jynx. Recover allows Kecleon to keep itself healthy against the onslaught of special attackers. Foul Play is used as Kecleon's attacking option, as its Attack stat is subpar and it rarely receives a STAB boost on any move due to Color Change. Foul Play also deals heavy damage to Golurk. Kecleon can also be a decent status spreader, with Toxic crippling walls and Thunder Wave crippling fast opposing attackers; both can potentially pave the way for a teammate's sweep. It should be noted that it is very easy for opponents to take advantage of Color Change to expose Kecleon to super effective attacks. For instance, Charizard can use a combination of Hidden Power Grass and Fire Blast to easily KO Kecleon. As such, Kecleon should always be used with caution.</p> <p>Magic Coat is a decent move on Kecleon, allowing it to bounce status moves, entry hazards, and Taunt back at the opponent. Return can be used over Foul Play, but it is usually weak due to Kecleon's ever-changing typing. Because Kecleon can slow down faster foes with paralysis, teammates that appreciate the opponent's team getting slowed down are decent. Sawk, Ursaring, and Samurott are good examples. Physically defensive Pokemon are also great partners as they cover up Kecleon's weaker defensive stat. Musharna is a great example as it can provide cleric support, as well as taking the Fighting-type hits that threaten Kecleon before Color Change activates. Dark-type Pursuit trappers are also nice teammates to have because they deter opponents from bringing in Pokemon such as Heal Bell Synchronize Musharna that can beat Kecleon. Skuntank and Sneasel are good examples.</p>"

  "Regirock": {
    "overview": "<p>Regirock sits in a decent place within the NU metagame, boasting the most physical bulk and checking many of NU's top-tier physical threats, such as Swellow, Kangaskhan, and Braviary, with its mono-Rock typing. Furthermore, it is equipped with a great Attack stat, making it an effective, hard-hitting tank. Along with its access to a variety of support options, Regirock is undeniably a tough threat to take down without strong super effective STAB attacks. However, Regirock does come with evident flaws, most notably its lack of reliable recovery. This makes it vulnerable to wear and tear, eventually succumbing to the damage it's meant to be taking. On top of that, the same Rock typing that makes Regirock a great answer to the sweepers mentioned above leaves it with weaknesses to common Water-, Grass-, Ground-, and Fighting-type attacks. Due to this, many powerful attackers, such as Samurott, Exeggutor, Golurk, and Sawk, can greatly hinder Regirock's performance.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Regirock is equipped with an enormous movepool, but unfortunately it is flooded with underwhelming options. A RestTalk set can be used to compensate for Regirock's lack of recovery and, when paired with Curse, can be a decent mono-attacker with Rock Slide; however, Regirock's common weaknesses can make this difficult to execute. It's also possible to utilize a Chesto Berry with Rest to prevent being setup fodder from sleeping. A specially defensive EV spread is an effective alternative if you wish Regirock to check special attackers, such as Eelektross, Zebstrika, and Haunter, better. Regirock also has access to a variety of special attacks, such as Earth Power, Focus Blast, Charge Beam, Thunderbolt, and more, but its pitiful Special Attack makes them unusable. The elemental punches are available for use and hit certain Pokemon that can be an issue, such as Fire Punch for Bronzor and Metang, Thunder Punch for Alomomola, and Ice Punch for Tangela, but these punches are typically not strong enough to make running them worthwhile and Stone Edge hits just as hard normally as they do super effectively. Hammer Arm and Superpower can be used for a stronger Fighting-type attack, but Drain Punch is a lot more beneficial, as it hits decently enough and replenishes some of Regirock's HP. Earthquake is also an alternative to Drain Punch to have the EdgeQuake combination, but Drain Punch already hits almost everything that Earthquake would be used for and has better overall coverage. Explosion can be used to surprise an unsuspecting opponent and can work on a Custap Berry set; however, Golem and Gigalith run it better and if you do choose to use it, you sacrifice your Normal- and Flying-type check. Due to Regirock's great bulk, it can be a reliable Sunny Day or Gravity supporter. Lastly, Regirock can execute a Swagger + Psych Up tactic, but this is generally not worth it given how unreliable it is.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Golurk is the number one Regirock counter. It's immune to Drain Punch and Thunder Wave, and packs a resistance to Regirock's STAB attacks, allowing it to freely switch in and pulverize Regirock with a STAB Earthquake, Dynamic Punch, or even Drain Punch of its own. Toxic is all that Golurk needs to watch out for.</p> <p>Anything with enough Defense generally works well against Regirock, being able to sponge its attacks and set up on it. Garbodor can spill layers of Toxic Spikes or Spikes, Alomomola can Toxic stall it, Tangela can sap it with Giga Drain, and Golem can smash it with its STAB Earthquake, among others; however, they must be cautious of Regirock carrying status. Regirock's also susceptible to burn and poison status, and without any form of reliable recovery, the residual damage will often overwhelm it.</p> <p>Strong attackers that carry STAB super effective moves can break through Regirock's defenses. These include Sawk, Primeape, Seismitoad, Gorebyss, and Exeggutor. Furthermore, a number of Pokemon can set up against it, such as Bulk Up Gurdurr and Throh, who both don't mind status thanks to their Guts ability; Substitute + Nasty Plot Misdreavus, who can block status ailments and is bulky enough to take hits; and Swords Dance Samurott, who's also not significantly hampered by status.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This is Regirock's best set in the current metagame. With its excellent defensive capabilities and viable offensive presence, Regirock makes a great Stealth Rock user and status spreader for any kind of team. Stone Edge hits very hard off of Regirock's high Attack stat, 2HKOing many non-physically defensive Pokemon at the least. However, if power isn't an issue, Rock Slide is still a great alternative given its higher PP and accuracy. Drain Punch provides fantastic coverage alongside Regirock's Rock-type attack of choice, smacking the likes of Bastiodon, Probopass, and Lickilicky hard. It also provides beneficial recovery, something Regirock lacks a reliable source of. The last slot is dedicated to Regirock's status move of choice. Toxic is great for crippling Pokemon Regirock has a hard time getting by, such as Golurk, Alomomola, and Tangela, while Thunder Wave works great for hampering Regirock's prominent switch-ins, such as Sawk and Primeape, accommodates for its middling Speed, and pairs excellently with Rock Slide's flinch chance.</p> <p>In the last slot, Curse is a decent alternative if you prefer Regirock to combat boosting sweepers better, most notably Bulk Up Braviary, and is generally useful to improve Regirock's damage output and Defense stat. However, note that this leaves Regirock completely walled by the omnipresent Golurk. Rocky Helmet is a reasonable alternative to Leftovers if you prefer to punish physical attackers, such as Miltank and Swellow, even further. In terms of the EV spread, it focuses on helping Regirock tank hits and dish attacks out hard, as well as outpacing max Speed Torkoal. An Impish nature is preferred to help with the physical threats that Regirock is meant to check better, as an Adamant nature generally doesn't help Regirock score any notable kills.</p> <p>Given that Regirock lacks any sort of reliable recovery, Wish support is greatly appreciated. Lickilicky and Audino are great in this department, as they help deal with the special onslaughts Regirock often comes across and can provide Heal Bell support in the event that Regirock is crippled with status. It's also recommended to use Pokemon that capitalize on Regirock's weaknesses. Exeggutor is a great option, as it resists Regirock's common Fighting-, Water-, Grass-, and Ground-type weaknesses, and Regirock can assist with its Fire- and Flying-type weaknesses. Ludicolo is also a great choice to look into, resisting Regirock's Ground- and Water-type weaknesses, and reasonably deals with Golurk, Regirock's main nemesis. Golurk itself is also an excellent partner, being immune to Regirock's Fighting-type weakness. It should be noted that Choice Band Golurk and specially defensive Ludicolo make a very effective balanced core with Regirock.</p>"

  "Regice": {
    "overview": "<p>Regice's main objective hasn't changed throughout the generations; it mainly functions as a special wall because of its enormous base 200 Special Defense, standing high above the competition. However, it must usually rely on the RestTalk strategy for recovery, which can hinder its defensive capabilities. Regice is also well-known for its BoltBeam combination, which gives it nearly perfect coverage. Regice can also play the role of a setup sweeper, with Rock Polish raising its Speed to astonishing heights. Despite its horrible defensive typing and Stealth Rock weakness, Regice can perform well in whatever role it has been assigned.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Specs set can be used to further enhance Regice's offensive presence. However, Regice would be switching quite often when locked into an attack, and considering that its vulnerable to all three forms of entry hazards, it wouldn't be successful. Charge Beam is also a good way to raise Regice's Special Attack in hopes of Regice achieving the role of a wallbreaker. However, Regice is a slow Pokemon, and it is difficult to find moveslot for Charge Beam. Psych Up and Frost Breath are plausible options to beat Calm Mind sweepers. Icy Wind is viable as well, having similar effects as Thunder Wave but acting as a STAB move. Curse is great way to compensate for Regice's saddening Defense, but Regice's Attack isn't something worth enhancing, and its physically offensive movepool is quite disappointing.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Regice doesn't have a reliable source of recovery, so slowly wearing it down with entry hazards is your best bet. Piloswine, Regirock, and other entry hazard leads can get Stealth Rock on the field and even attack Regice with their powerful STAB moves. Physical attackers, such as Sawk, Gurdurr, Kangaskhan, and the Rock-types mentioned earlier, are prime examples of Pokemon that can aim for Regice's weaker Defense; however, these Pokemon are crippled by Thunder Wave, which makes Regice harder to defeat. Specially defensive Camerupt can take anything Regice throws at it, set up Stealth Rock, and Roar it away. Throh can take Regice's attacks well, use Circle Throw, and isn't crippled by Thunder Wave because of Guts. Bulky Pokemon that can heal themselves of paralysis, such as Lickilicky, Flareon, and Miltank, can avoid being crippled and attack Regice. The best way of defeating Regice is to target its Defense using physical attackers and Pokemon that can both take a hit and brush off Thunder Wave; Regice can easily be weakened at that point.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Tank": {
        "description": "<p>Regice's amazing special bulk and acceptable base 100 Special Attack are combined to form an offensive tank set. It doesn't exactly fit the role of a support Pokemon, but with its near-perfect coverage and a recovery option in Rest, it makes for a great balanced Pokemon. Rest is Regice's only recovery move, healing it in a pinch. Sleep Talk provides the second half of the RestTalk strategy, which allows Regice to check threats it needs to while maintaining its longevity. One notable issue with RestTalk is that it is much easier to switch into, and must rely on the luck of Sleep Talk to inflict damage. The final two moveslots give Regice the famous BoltBeam combination, which hits almost every Pokemon for neutral damage.</p> <p>Leftovers is the ideal item for this set for extended longevity. However, a Chesto Berry can be used to wake up Regice from Rest. What makes Chesto Berry a situational choice is that it only wakes Regice from sleep once; after the Chesto Berry has been eaten and Rest is used a second time, Regice is forced to rely on Sleep Talk in order to avoid becoming setup fodder. 248 HP EVs are so that Regice can come in four times with Stealth Rock on the field. 252 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature maximizes Regice's damage output when using its special attacks. An EV spread focusing on Special Defense can be used to allow Regice to tank special hits much easier, but with its huge base 200 Special Defense, it's rarely needed. Toxic can be used in this set, as it's great at crippling bulky Pokemon that Regice has difficulties getting past, such as Piloswine and Eelektross. Thunder Wave can also be used to cripple faster Pokemon that Regice walls such as Ludicolo, Samurott, and Haunter, as well support the team by giving slower Pokemon such as Choice Band Sawk and Braviary the ability to outspeed Pokemon they normally would not. Focus Blast can be used instead of Rest—forgoing Sleep Talk and Chesto Berry as well—to hit Pokemon such as Lickilicky and Probopass harder; however, it's not recommended, as Rest's recovery allows Regice to last longer in the match.</p> <p>Entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, can easily wear Regice down. Because of this, Rapid Spin support is appreciated. Wartortle is a great spinner, as it has good defensive synergy with Regice. If you want Regice to wake up from Rest sooner, Heal Bell support is recommended; Lickilicky, Flareon, and Musharna are great options in this department, as they all have great bulk to tank hits alongside Regice; the first two can even offer Wish support when Rest's sleep effect is unwanted. Because foes usually opt to target Regice's Defense, physically defensive Pokemon such as Alomomola and Tangela are great partners. The former can offer Wish and the latter offers Leech Seed; Regice appreciates all the recovery it can get. Samurott and Seismitoad have good synergy with Regice, as they deal with each others weaknesses quite well. Sawk and Gurdurr can punch through either set easily; Misdreavus and Garbodor are great partners to handle not only them, but other Fighting-types as well.</p>"
      },
      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<p>Regice's Speed is the only thing holding it back from performing a sweep against other teams; Rock Polish fixes that. With access to Rock Polish, great overall bulk, and a decent Special Attack, Regice stands as a bulky sweeper that can inflict damage and take a hit in the process. Regice has perfect coverage with its three attacking moves, allowing it to hit every Pokemon in NU for neutral damage. It works best as a late-game sweeper, as it doesn't quite have the offensive presence to KO bulky Pokemon early- or mid-game. Rock Polish is what makes the magic happen in this set; at +2, Regice can outspeed positive-natured base 125 Pokemon or below, such as Swellow and Floatzel, which is mind-blowing. Regice wields a BoltBeam combination in this set as well; Ice Beam is Regice's STAB, and when paired with Thunderbolt, it gives Regice a nearly perfect coverage. Focus Blast is the final coverage move, as it hits Pokemon such as Probopass, Rotom-F, and Piloswine for more damage.</p> <p>Regice has 252 EVs in Special Attack, a Life Orb, and a Modest nature to give it as much offensive potential as possible. 32 HP EVs give Regice 309 HP, meaning it'll take 30 damage from Life Orb recoil instead of 31. The Speed EVs allow it to outrun Swellow at +2. Leftovers can be used over Life Orb for consistent healing, but the lack of power makes Regice less effective as a sweeper. There aren't any viable alternative move selections for this set.</p> <p>Entry hazard users are appreciated alongside Regice with this set; because Regice is a late-game sweeper, having Pokemon weakened will benefit it, as some Pokemon, specifically Samurott and Sawk, can only be KOed with entry hazard damage. Roselia, while sharing a Fire-type weakness with Regice, can take the physical Fighting-type attacks that Regice can't stand and lay down Spikes. Golurk can check Fighting-types for Regice and set up Stealth Rock. Rapid Spin support is recommended, as Regice is revenge killed more easily after taking residual damage. Wartortle is a good option, as it can take the Fire-type attacks aimed at Regice while having good defensive synergy. U-turn or Volt Switch support is appreciated, as it gets Regice on the field safely. Pokemon such as Swellow, Braviary, and Eelektross are good options, as the former two can deal with bulky Pokemon Regice can't beat, such as Musharna, while the latter has Coil to raise its Defense, making it good backup against physically offensive Pokemon Regice has issues with. If Regice gets paralyzed, its chances of sweeping are ruined. Heal Bell support from Pokemon such as Flareon, Lickilicky, and Miltank is appreciated; Flareon and Lickilicky can also offer Wish support. Ironically, opposing Regice with Thunder Wave can paralyze Regice, rendering Rock Polish useless. Fighting-types such as Gurdurr can demolish opposing Regice.</p>"

Add to that its access to two powerful STAB moves in Wood Hammer and Earthquake, and a unique typing that resists the popular EdgeQuake combination, and you've got one of the best Choice Band users in NU on your hands. With its good natural bulk Torterra can also easily set up Stealth Rock, as it has good match-ups against most Stealth Rock setters, or set up a Rock Polish, which gives it the ability to sweep late in the game. Torterra's STABs are resisted by some common types in NU, such as Grass-, Bug-, and Flying-types, so it often has trouble dealing with switch-ins. Sadly, its unique typing doesn't help against Water-types, which Torterra has difficulty countering, especially as it also can't always survive their common Ice-type coverage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There are a lot of great moves in Torterra's movepool, but other Grass-types might end up outclassing it. For example, Torterra could use a dual screens set with Light Clay, but Serperior is better at this as it's faster than Torterra and has access to Taunt. Torterra could also run a SubSeed set, but this is better used by Jumpluff and Serperior. Torterra is too slow and those two have better support movepools, including options such as Encore and Taunt. Special moves such as Giga Drain, Earth Power, and Leaf Storm could also be used, but Torterra's higher Attack stat is way more useful. Seed Bomb could be an option over Wood Hammer on any set, but Torterra needs the power of Wood Hammer to turn 3HKOs into 2HKOs. Swords Dance allows Torterra to punch big holes in opposing teams in the early-game, even scoring an OHKO on Musharna. Finally, Curse could be used, but Torterra is so slow it's easy to revenge kill with common Ice-type coverage or simply a strong super effective move from a faster opponent.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Torterra's best counters are Tangela and Weezing, as they can easily take a hit from it and force it out with Sleep Powder or Will-O-Wisp. They also commonly run coverage moves that are able to hit Torterra for super effective damage, such as Hidden Power Ice and Flamethrower.</p> <p>Flying-types, such as Rotom-S, Swellow, and Braviary, can easily come in on an Earthquake and finish Torterra off, but keep in mind Torterra can use Stone Edge or Rock Polish on the switch, making it dangerous. Any Pokemon able to outspeed or take a hit from Torterra and hit it for super effective damage can easily kill it; examples include Charizard and Piloswine, who can also easily finish Torterra off with a Fire Blast or priority Ice Shard, respectively. U-turn users are also hard for Torterra to deal with, as they can easily wear it down until they can KO it with their strongest move. Strong special attackers such as Exeggutor and Samurott can also outspeed or take a hit from Torterra and finish it off. Also, if Charizard is using a Choice Scarf, it can outspeed boosted Torterra and OHKO with Fire Blast. Finally, Torterra can kill itself from recoil quite quickly, so smart switching will make Torterra much weaker.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Choice Band is Torterra's best set, letting it hit hard from turn one and OHKO or 2HKO a lot of defensive Pokemon, such as Musharna and Alomomola. Torterra's strong STAB moves in Wood Hammer and Earthquake are the key to the set, hitting any Pokemon hard that tries to switch in on it. Stone Edge is useful, as it gives Torterra the chance to hit incoming Flying-types, such as Mandibuzz and Altaria, which love to switch in on it. Bullet Seed is in the fourth moveslot because it allows Torterra to not only KO threats through Sturdy, but also break Substitutes and have a Grass STAB move without recoil. Toxic can also be used in the last moveslot to catch incoming Tangela and Mandibuzz.</p> <p>The EV spread gives Torterra the ability to outspeed base 45 Speed Pokemon with maximum investment, such as Golem. Choice Band is used over Life Orb, as Choice Band gives Torterra more power behind its moves without losing as much health to recoil. A bulkier spread of 180 HP / 252 Atk / 76 Spe can be used, as it lets Torterra outspeed base 65 Speed Pokemon with minimum investment, such as Alomomola.</p> <p>Superpower can be used in the last moveslot to hit incoming Sap Sipper users, such as Sawsbuck and Miltank, but keep in mind Earthquake can still 2HKO both of them. Stealth Rock can also be used to bluff a defensive set and surprise your opponent later with a strong Choice Band-boosted move.</p> <p>If Torterra is running Bullet Seed, it'll pair well with Charizard because Bullet Seed will OHKO through Sturdy and Focus Sash so that common hazards setters won't be able to set up, and Charizard is easily able to OHKO or 2HKO most of Torterra's counter and checks. Torterra also pairs well with other Flying-types, such as Braviary and Swellow, who love to see Rock- and Steel-types and Alomomola off the field. Additionally, Torterra pairs greatly with Shell Smash Carracosta. Torterra can take out bulky Water-types such as Seismitoad, who Carracosta struggles to beat, and Carracosta can switch in and set up on Fire-, Flying-, and Ice-type attacks that Torterra attracts. Regirock is a great partner for Torterra, as it can beat a lot of the Flying-types that annoy Torterra and set up Stealth Rock to ease its job.

Even though Torterra will have less power behind its moves, outspeeding these threats is way more important. If you really want to use Adamant, an EV spread of 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe lets Torterra outspeed Swellow at +2.</p> <p>Swords Dance can be used over Stone Edge, giving Torterra the ability to break through stall.

With said Speed tier, it's able to outspeed and heavily damage many threats in the metagame like Rotom-S, Charizard, and Haunter. It can run a Calm Mind + Substitute set to become a more formidable sweeper. Hidden Power Rock and Ground round out Serperior's coverage quite nicely, hitting Flying- and Poison-types, respectively. Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit Dragon- and Grass-types; however, thet are fairly uncommon and typically not worth the moveslot. Despite all this, Serperior usually needs at least a single Calm Mind to be an effective sweeper due to its subpar Special Attack stat. While it is naturally fast, there are many faster threats that offensively pressure it like Choice Scarf Rotom-F, Swellow, and Floatzel. There's also a multitude of special walls like Miltank, Roselia, and Zweilous to boot that simply laugh at Serperior's attempts to take them down.</p>",

Hidden Power Ice can be used to check the niche Dragon- and Grass-types that can otherwise give Serperior trouble. Knock Off can be used to remove Eviolite and Leftovers from common checks, annoying even hard stops such as Miltank. Substitute paired with Leech Seed can be used in favor of Hidden Power to chip down all of Poison-, Fire-, and Flying-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: If Serperior is carrying Hidden Power Rock, Garbodor and Skuntank are just a couple of threats that don't fear it much due to the small amount of damage Hidden Power Rock does. Weezing can take on Serperior comfortably regardless of the Hidden Power.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Should Serperior be running Hidden Power Ground, foes like Charizard, Braviary, Mandibuzz, and Rotom-S can all comfortably switch into it without fear.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Regice, Roselia, Miltank, and Zweilous get tickled at best from any of Serperior's attacks while also being able to pressure it offensively.</p>",

      "Calm Mind Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Serperior can use Substitute or Taunt to take advantage of passive Pokemon that it checks like Seismitoad and Alomomola. Substitute in particular makes Serperior tougher to revenge kill and allows it to safely fall into Overgrow range. A Calm Mind boost alongside Life Orb will let Serperior's Giga Drain net OHKOs on threats like Samurott, Golurk, and Regirock, as well as neutral Pokemon like Eelektross and Kangaskhan if boosted by Overgrow. Giga Drain often offsets Life Orb recoil and can allow Serperior to use Substitute multiple times. Hidden Power Rock nails Charizard, Braviary, and Rotom-S for super effective damage, while Hidden Power Ground does the same to Poison-types like Garbodor and Skuntank.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Serperior fits best on balance and bulky offense teams that benefit from an offensive Water-resistand Pokemon. While it is fast, Choice Scarf Pokemon like Primeape, Rotom-S, and Haunter all threaten Serperior with their respective STAB moves and can take an unboosted attack from it. Defensive answers to these threats like Weezing, Camerupt, and Mandibuzz, respectively, are appreciated. Naturally faster threats like Swellow and Floatzel can force Serperior out as well. Physically defensive Pokemon such as Regirock and Alomomola take on Swellow very easily, and the latter can also comfortably switch into Floatzel. Serperior's partners can largely dictate what Hidden Power it runs, as with Hidden Power Rock, having teammates such as Golem, Piloswine, and Seismitoad to dent Poison-types can help Serperior manage without the super effective coverage. If Serperior opts for Hidden Power Ground to snipe Poison-types and stray targets like Camerupt, then Flying-types such as Charizard, Braviary, and Mandibuzz can switch into its Giga Drain very easily, making Electric- and Rock-types like Eelektross and Regirock solid partners. Special walls such as Roselia and Zweilous can almost always take on Serperior but must be wary of the rare Hidden Power Ice, which also hits Flying-types like Mandibuzz. Sap Sipper Miltank is the definition of a hard wall for Serperior, pressuring it even if it's behind a Substitute or Miltank is Taunted. Physical wallbreakers like Sawk and Braviary break through these special walls.</p>"

  "Samurott": {
    "overview": "<p>NU is a tier packed with Water-types that you might consider for a spot on your team, but none of them share the combination of power and unpredictability that Samurott has. With great mixed attacking stats, Samurott can run physical, special, and mixed sets to great effect. Samurott also has great bulk for an offensive Pokemon, allowing it to take a few hits while dishing out many in return. Perhaps the only real drawback to Samurott is its middling Speed stat, but even this is patched up by its access to priority and the ability to outspeed most of the common walls that it can beat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While these sets are certainly Samurott's easiest ways to succeed in the tier, there are some other options that it can use. A set with Substitute and Salac Berry can sweep opponent's teams through boosting its Speed and taking advantage of Torrent; however, with the tier as offensive as it is, Samurott won't get many opportunities to set up. A Choice Scarf set is an interesting option to consider, but Samurott loses out on a way of boosting its offensive capabilities and is often too slow to utilize the item. Return can be used on the Swords Dance set, but Megahorn's greater power and super effective coverage against Tangela and Musharna make it the preferred option. Superpower can also be used on either set, but its Attack and Defense drops are undesirable, especially as Samurott functions well enough without it. Knock Off is an interesting option for Samurott, but because the move's targets are usually bulky walls and Samurott can defeat many of them, it is often better off without it. X-Scissor can be used over Megahorn if you prefer accuracy over power, though the loss of power is too detrimental. Finally, Samurott can use Toxic to help it beat opposing walls, but Samurott already has other means of accomplishing this.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The first thing to do when trying to check an opposing Samurott is figure out which set it is running. This alone is what makes Samurott so difficult to handle; even if you use Protect to scout out what move it's going to use, you always run the risk of it using Swords Dance. Despite this, bulky Water-types handle either set decently well. Mantine is a good check, as it either resists or is immune to every move on the Swords Dance set, and the special set typically prefers to use Hidden Power Grass. Alomomola and Shelgon both handle the Swords Dance set well; the former can Toxic Samurott and then stall it out with Wish and Protect, while the latter can take a hit and Roar away its boosts. Bulky Vileplume also handles the Swords Dance set fairly well, surviving even a +2 Megahorn then striking back with Giga Drain. Regice, Lapras, and Articuno all fare well against the special set, but they do struggle a bit because of their Stealth Rock weakness. Lickilicky and Audino can switch into any hit from the special set and then stall out Life Orb recoil while they use Wish and Protect. You can try to wall Samurott's moves, but the better way to defeat it is through revenge killing it. Serperior and Ludicolo both excel in revenge killing it, thanks to taking either no damage or minimal damage from Water-type attacks, but both of them must be wary of switching into a Megahorn if they are unable to KO. In general, faster Water-types, such as Simipour and Floatzel, do well in revenge killing either set, as they can outspeed it and typically avoid being KOed by Aqua Jet.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>With this set, Samurott plays the role of a boosting sweeper, taking advantage of its good bulk to set up. This set compensates for its lack of Speed with its great Attack stat, its boosting move, and access to priority. Swords Dance is the reason for a physical set; after a single boost, Samurott hits a threatening 656 Attack, meaning that even some of the bulkiest walls in the tier struggle to tank its attacks. Razor Shell is a reliable physical STAB for Samurott to utilize with a 50% chance of lowering the foe's Defense, though Waterfall is a viable alternative with 5 more Base Power and accuracy and a chance to flinch the opponent. One of the main reasons to use Razor Shell is that Waterfall's flinch chance is less exploitable with a low Speed stat. Aqua Jet is used on the set for a strong STAB priority attack, which allows Samurott to beat many of the faster Pokemon that could otherwise revenge kill it with ease. Finally, Megahorn is used on this set as Samurott's strongest coverage move, and it allows Samurott to hit Tangela and Musharna, two of the tier's most common physical walls, for super effective damage.</p> <p>The given EVs on this set serve a few different purposes. To begin with, maximum investment is used in Attack to allow Samurott to muscle past many of the tier's common physical walls. 56 Speed EVs are used to allow Samurott to outspeed fully invested base 45 Speed Pokemon, such as Marowak, Golem, and Armaldo, as well as minimum Speed Garbodor. Finally, the rest of the EVs are used in HP, as they allow Samurott a chance to survive a Close Combat from Adamant Choice Band Sawk as well as a Life Orb Horn Leech from Sawsbuck. An alternate EV spread of 64 HP / 252 Atk / 192 Spe can be used should you be more interested in outspeeding other Pokemon, such as Timid Gorebyss before a Shell Smash. As this set is very susceptible to all forms of status, Lum Berry is a fantastic option for an item. Most notably, it keeps Samurott from being stopped by an untimely Will-O-Wisp from Misdreavus. Mystic Water is another viable option that boosts the power of Samurott's choice in STAB, as well as its Aqua Jet, without the drawback of Life Orb recoil. Finally, thanks to its ability, Torrent, Samurott receives an additional boost to its Water-type attacks when it is brought down to one-third or less of its max HP, only adding onto how deadly this set can be for opponents to face.</p> <p>Despite how powerful this set is, Samurott cannot defeat the whole tier on its own. Grass-types, such as Simisage, Serperior, and Vileplume, pair well with this set, as they can defeat Alomomola, a Pokemon that has the ability to Toxic stall this set. Because Mantine and Frillish wall this set completely, Electric-types, such as Eelektross and Rotom-A, can be used alongside Samurott in order to defeat them. Vileplume is difficult to break, making strong Flying- and Fire-types, such as Braviary and Charizard, good partners as well. Wish and Heal Bell support from Lickilicky and Audino, while not entirely necessary, is also appreciated, as they can restore Samurott if it has been crippled mid-sweep, giving it another chance to attempt to sweep again later in the match. Lickilicky and Audino also take on many of the tier's Grass- and Electric-types, as most of them use special attacks.</p>"
      },
      "All-out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Samurott's great Special Attack stat and access to great support moves to let it serve as a powerful wallbreaker. As this set defeats most of the checks and counters to the Swords Dance set, it also serves as a great lure; one poor switch from the opponent can leave them without a physical wall for the remainder of the match. Hydro Pump is used on this set as Samurott's most powerful STAB move. Ice Beam has great coverage alongside Hydro Pump, hitting Grass-types, as well as the occasional Dragon-type, for super effective damage. Hidden Power Grass is used in the third slot for reliable coverage against Water-types. The last slot depends on what your team would prefer. Megahorn KOes Ludicolo after Stealth Rock damage. Taunt, however, can be used to allow Samurott to function as an anti-lead and a means of keeping entry hazards off your side of the field. It also helps Samurott take down bulky walls that rely on hitting it with a status-inducing move in order to help defeat it.</p> <p>A Modest nature is used instead of Timid on this set, as the only Pokemon that a Timid nature allows Samurott to outspeed is the rare Fraxure. It does, however, also allow Samurott to Speed tie with Timid Ludicolo and Victreebel, so should you prefer to get the jump on these Pokemon, a Timid nature is still viable. Life Orb is chosen for the item on this set to help increase Samurott's immediate power, as it has no move that allows it to boost its Special Attack. Life Orb also comes with the added bonus of bringing Samurott into Torrent range. Should the accuracy of Hydro Pump be off-putting, Surf is a viable alternative in the first moveslot. Hidden Power Electric can also be used instead of Hidden Power Grass to let Samurott hit Mantine for super effective damage, but Hidden Power Grass hits Seismitoad, a much more common threat. Superpower can be used to hit Regice, Lickilicky, and Ludicolo for solid damage. While Aqua Jet isn't very powerful with a Modest nature, it can still be used in the last slot to help it pick off severely weakened foes. Dragon Tail is another interesting potential choice for Samurott, as Samurott is good at forcing switches. With Dragon Tail, Samurott can rack up entry hazard damage against its checks and counters. Finally, Encore can be used in the last slot, as it is one of the best support moves in the game, but Samurott's Speed doesn't allow it to utilize the move as well as other Pokemon in the tier.</p> <p>As this set is very good at breaking down physical walls, attackers that can clean up weakened teams, such as Swellow and Choice Scarf Sawk, work well with this set. Without Megahorn, this set still struggles to defeat Ludicolo and Serperior, so priority users, such as Kangaskhan and Skuntank, are appreciated as ways of taking them out. Special walls can still prove to be troublesome, even in spite of Samurott's power; strong Fighting-types, such as Sawk and Gurdurr, are great ways to defeat them, as most of the tier's common special walls--particularly Regice, Audino, and Lickilicky--are weak to Fighting-type attacks.</p>"

  "Stoutland": {
    "overview": "<p>Stoutland is one of the premier dog Pokemon in NeverUsed. Unfortunately, this doesn't mean it's a good choice for a competitive team. With access to both Scrappy and Intimidate, one might think that it is a great Pokemon that can fit onto almost any team. The issue is that, while these are great abilities, Stoutland is severely outclassed by many of the other offensive Normal-types within the tier; most anything it can do, another Pokemon can do better. Kangaskhan, for example, generally outclasses Stoutland as a Scrappy-wielding offensive Normal-type, thanks to its slightly higher Speed coupled with priority moves in Fake Out and Sucker Punch. In addition, both Tauros and Granbull have access to Intimidate, pushing Stoutland even further into obscurity. Tauros is a lot better offensively thanks to its much greater Speed stat, and while Granbull might have lesser bulk than Stoutland, it makes up for it with access to many more support options. Truly, Stoutland's greatest niche is in Sand Rush, but due to the lack of permanent sand in NU, Stoutland is one of few Pokemon that functions better in OU than in NU. In the end, Stoutland isn't a top tier NU Pokemon, and it only has a couple of niches over typical Normal-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Though Stoutland doesn't have much else going for it, there are a few additional options that could be explored. Manual sand alongside Sand Rush sounds like a great idea, and while Stoutland hits hard enough with a Choice Band to consider its use, it's the only Pokemon in NU that benefits from manually set sand. This means you have to dedicate a significant amount of your team just to support one Pokemon which is even worse when you consider that Choice Band Stoutland isn't very good to begin with. Overall, you're better off not using a Sand Rush set. The elemental fangs can be used for niche coverage, but due to their low Base Power, you are generally better off using the coverage moves listed. Pursuit is a decent option, allowing Stoutland to trap unassuming Ghost- and Psychic-types switching out trying to avoid an attack. A defensive set with Rest, Sleep Talk, and Roar could be used; however, Munchlax usually runs this set better due to its great special bulk. Wild Charge can be used to hit Alomomola and other bulky Water-types for super effective damage, but be forewarned that it still won't do a lot of damage to Alomomola, scoring only a 5HKO at best after Leftovers recovery. Work Up is Stoutland's best boosting move, but considering its poor Special Attack stat, special movepool, and below average Speed, Stoutland doesn't utilize the move very well. Finally, a parashuffler set with Roar and Thunder Wave is probably the best alternative to the set listed above thanks to Stoutland's good bulk with investment and its access to Intimidate.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Gurdurr is the best check to Stoutland as it can take a Return with relative ease and recover with a STAB, super effective Drain Punch. Musharna is also a great defensive check because it takes 3 to 4 hits for Stoutland to KO it with Crunch. Even Toxic does not reliably handle Musharna since it can use Heal Bell while punishing Stoutland for poisoning it thanks to Synchronize. Mainly, anything with decent bulk and a reliable form of recovery can handle Stoutland well. Sawk serves as a great offensive check since the Choice Band set can OHKO Stoutland even after the Attack drop from Intimidate. The only thing Sawk really has to worry about is switching into a Thunder Wave. Strong special attackers, such as Samurott and Exeggutor, don't mind the Attack drop and can hit it rather hard. Braviary loves for Stoutland to switch into it as Defiant powers it up instead of dropping its power with Intimidate. Finally, almost any physically defensive Pokemon--Tangela, Alomomola, Shelgon, and Metang, to name a few--handles Stoutland well.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This is the best set Stoutland can run in NU that isn't severely outclassed by other Normal-types. Unfortunately, this set still isn't very good. Return hits most Pokemon in NU for decent damage, but it's still not that strong. Stoutland would appreciate the boosted power of Double-Edge, but for some reason, our four-legged friend does not learn it. Crunch lets it hit Ghost-types, such as Drifblim, Golurk, and Haunter, while also providing super effective coverage against Psychic-types such as Gardevoir and Musharna. Superpower rounds out its coverage, hitting Rock- and Steel-types harder than any of its other moves. Unfortunately, many of the Pokemon you will want to hit with Superpower, such as Golem, Probopass, and Piloswine, are very bulky, so don't expect a very large damage output. The final slot typically depends upon the structure of your team. More offensive teams prefer Thunder Wave to help slow down opposing offensive threats, and Stoutland itself also enjoys the lowered Speed of its foes. More defensive teams, however, prefer Toxic as Speed is less important to them. Specifically, it can help to weaken physical walls such as Alomomola and Tangela, the likes of which Stoutland is completely unable to break.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is chosen for this set because Speed is unimportant to it. While Scrappy may seem like a good option, it compromises Stoutland's ability to take hits and will once again make Stoutland function as an inferior Kangaskhan. Spikes-stacking teams might prefer for Stoutland to run Roar over one of the status moves listed in order to rack up residual damage on the opponent's team. Stoutland can be used on a Normal spam team alongside such partners as Kangaskhan, Tauros, and Zangoose. It also pairs well with bulky Psychic-types such as Musharna that can take powerful Fighting-type attacks from the likes of Sawk and Gurdurr. Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Drifblim are also good ways to handle Sawk and Primeape. Because bulky Rock- and Ground-types give this set troubles, Stoutland enjoys offensive support from powerful special attackers such as Ludicolo, Mantine, and Samurott. Finally, sets without Toxic are hard walled by Alomomola, so it's a good idea to pair Stoutland with Grass-types such as Exeggutor and Roselia. Roselia in particular can set up Spikes to support the team and can also hit Tangela for great damage with a STAB Sludge Bomb.</p>"

  "Simisage": {
    "overview": "<p>Simisage sports a nice balance of Speed and power, allowing it to take the role of a fast hard-hitter. With good mixed attacking stats and high Speed, Simisage can swing past many common threats such as Charizard and Sawsbuck, and threaten them with its coverage moves. However, Simisage's Grass typing does it no favors defensively, burdening it with several weaknesses to common attacking types. It is also very frail, leaving it hard-pressed to find many switch-in opportunities. As a Grass-type, Simisage faces a lot of competition from Serperior, a faster and more reliable boosting sweeper. However, Simisage's versatility and ability to immediately threaten the opposing team are able to set it apart from its competition.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Simisage can use a mixed set utilizing Hone Claws alongside moves such as Seed Bomb, Focus Blast, and Acrobatics; however, Nasty Plot is a better boosting move. In a similar vein, Work Up can boost both of Simisage's offenses, but Nasty Plot is still superior. Leaf Storm is Simisage's strongest attack, and can be used alongside Choice Specs to make Simisage a powerful wallbreaker. However, the -2 Special Attack drop is undesirable, and Life Orb makes Simisage more versatile. Simisage hits a valuable Speed tier at base 101, making a Choice Scarf set seem plausible. Unfortunately, all of Simisage's moves are either too weak or terrible to be locked into. Taunt can make Simisage a decent anti-lead, but it is too frail to make good use of the move, and is outclassed by Serperior in this role. Leech Seed can sap away at the opponent's health, while Acrobatics can deal with opposing Grass-types; however, it has far better things to be doing and is too frail to use it efficiently. Bullet Seed can break Sturdy from the likes of Golem; unfortunately, it is illegal with Overgrow. Finally, Grasswhistle can potentially neuter a counter for the rest of the match, but is too inaccurate to be worth using.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Simisage is hard to directly counter due to its high Speed and vast array of coverage moves; checking it is a much simpler task. Bulky Poison-types such as Garbodor and Muk are the best answers, as they are not weak to any of Simisage's moves and can OHKO in return with their STABs. In a similar boat, Metang can comfortably tank anything Simisage throws at it and can dent it with Meteor Mash. Dragonair, although rare, can take Simisage's hits for days and set up with Dragon Dance. Faster Pokemon can also get the jump on Simisage; due to its general frailty, most neutral hits will leave a large dent, if not OHKO. Choice Scarf users such as Haunter, Primeape, and Charizard can also revenge kill it, though they sometimes have difficulty switching in. Swellow also dislikes switching in (even against Grass-type moves), but can crush Simisage with Brave Bird. Finally, priority is effective at revenge killing a weakened Simisage, examples being Kangaskhan's Fake Out and Sucker Punch combination and Gurdurr's Mach Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>All of Simisage's best qualities are displayed in this set: its great coverage, good mixed attacking stats, and high Speed. By virtue of this, Simisage can serve as an excellent cleaner, capable of punching holes in many teams. Simisage can set up a Substitute on many Pokemon it forces out, such as Alomomola and Seismitoad, and let its vast coverage do the rest. Substitute is an excellent move for Simisage in general, protecting it from status and revenge killers while also easing prediction. Giga Drain serves as Simisage's STAB move, and works very well in tandem with Substitute and its ability, Overgrow; Simisage can use Substitute to get down into Overgrow range, heal the damage off with a boosted Giga Drain, and rinse and repeat once bulky Pokemon that resist the move are removed. Superpower is an excellent coverage move that Simisage has access to; not only does it provide a strong hit on Steel-types, Skuntank, and Sap Sipper Pokemon such as Miltank and Sawsbuck, but it nails several special walls such as Lickilicky and Regice as well. Hidden Power Rock rounds off this set's coverage, notably hitting Fire-, Flying-, and Bug-types for super effective damage.</p> <p>Hidden Power Fire can be considered over Hidden Power Rock, providing a strong hit against bulky Grass-types and Metang while still hitting Bug-types super effectively. However, without Hidden Power Rock, Simisage misses out on Charizard, an arguably more important threat. Focus Blast can be used over Superpower with a Timid nature, but its miss chance is undesirable and Focus Blast does not gain any notable KOs. Simisage struggles against many bulky Grass-types such as Roselia and Vileplume, so partners that can deal with them are quite useful. Charizard is a prime example, hitting the aforementioned Grass-types with Fire Blast while also luring in Water-types such as Alomomola for Simisage to set up on. In return, Simisage can lure and KO special walls with Superpower. Finally, Simisage has a lot of difficulty switching in due to its frailty; a slow Volt Switch or Baton Pass from Eelektross, Probopass, or Musharna is quite useful to compensate for that.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Simisage can opt to go fully physically offensive in order to lure and KO many normal checks, and can serve as a decent wallbreaker due to its good Attack and wide array of coverage moves. Substitute shields Simisage from status and revenge killing, and can also help to ensure that Simisage gets safely into Overgrow range. Simisage's Grass-type STAB is a major selling point to this set, serving as a weapon against physically defensive titans such as Alomomola and Regirock. Acrobatics is an interesting coverage move that allows Simisage to lure and defeat Tangela, Vileplume, and Roselia, common checks to its other sets. It also has the added benefit of hitting Bug-types such as Pinsir for super effective damage. Low Kick is the preferred move in the last slot, providing coverage against Steel-types, Lickilicky, and Regice. Endeavor, on the other hand, is a more colorful option to be considered, being able to bring an opponent down to 1 HP after four uses of Substitute. Endeavor is a bit trickier to pull off, however, making Low Kick the superior option most of the time.</p> <p>8 HP EVs are used to allow Simisage to make four Substitutes from full health, while the rest maximizes Speed and power. Hone Claws can be used to allow Simisage to boost its Attack, but Simisage would prefer to straightaway attack than boost up, especially considering its limited lifespan. Rock Slide can hit Fire- and Flying-types while still covering Bug-types, but Acrobatics generally hits these Pokemon hard enough. Toxic Spikes support is incredibly useful in helping Simisage break down walls; because of this, Garbodor makes for a fine partner. Pokemon such as Swellow appreciate Simisage's ability to break down walls, and can efficiently clean up once said walls have either been weakened or removed. Simisage struggles quite a bit against bulky Poison-types such as Garbodor and Muk; Choice Scarf Gardevoir can threaten them out with Psychic, and appreciates Simisage's wallbreaking services as well. Piloswine can also take on most Poison-types with ease, and can set up Stealth Rock while sharing solid offensive and defensive synergy with Simisage. Finally, slow Volt Switch or Baton Pass support from Eelektross, Probopass, or Musharna is greatly appreciated to allow Simisage to enter the field safely.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>While Simisage does face a lot of competition from Serperior in the role of a boosting sweeper, its higher Special Attack and access to Nasty Plot set it apart. Simisage also boosts significantly faster than Serperior, meaning it can deal much more damage after a single boost. Unfortunately, Simisage's frailty can often make it difficult to obtain a boost, but it can still find setup opportunities against Pokemon it threatens out. Giga Drain serves as a reasonably strong STAB move, and is useful for healing off Life Orb recoil. Focus Blast attains coverage against Steel-types and Sap Sipper Pokemon, and is especially handy for crushing most special walls—after a Nasty Plot boost and Stealth Rock, even Lickilicky and Regice are OHKOed! On the other hand, Substitute can be used for more conservative boosting, allowing you to set up more freely against the likes of Alomomola and Seismitoad. It should be noted that Focus Blast works better with Life Orb, but Substitute works better with Salac Berry. Finally, the last slot is reserved for Hidden Power Rock, attaining coverage on Charizard, Braviary, and Mandibuzz.</p> <p>Gluttony is used on this set because Nasty Plot is illegal with Overgrow, despite the fact that it is only useful on variants running Salac Berry. Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Metang harder than any other move, but coverage against Charizard is too important to pass up. Simisage boasts incredible power if it manages to get a boost—the only problem is actually getting that boost, as Simisage's frailty often denies it many setup opportunities. Because of this, dual screens or Memento support is extremely useful to allow Simisage to set up; Gardevoir and Muk make great partners in this regard. Stealth Rock support is appreciated to allow Simisage to OHKO Regice and Mandibuzz after a boost with Focus Blast and Hidden Power Rock, respectively. Ground-types can set up Stealth Rock, lure in Water-types for Simisage, and can threaten bulky Poison-types and Metang with their STABs. Charizard is another good partner, being able to crush Grass / Poison-types such as Roselia and Vileplume, and also lure out bulky Water-types.</p>"

It is fast enough to outrun prominent threats such as Haunter, Charizard, and Sawsbuck and has the movepool to nail most of them hard. To top it off, it has good mixed attacking stats as well as Nasty Plot, the latter of which allows it to stand out amongst the other Fire-types of NU. However, Simisear has a couple of traits that do cramp up its style. It is frail and has many exploitable weaknesses to Water, Ground, and Rock, all of which are common. Even though it has a less severe Stealth Rock weakness than Charizard, it still faces stiff competition from the \"cliché dragon\" due to the ape's lesser power, bulk, and movepool, most notably having no healing move to offset any damage taken. Simisear does boast the advantage of playing around Stealth Rock better than the its fellow fast Fire-types, Charizard and Rapidash, so if you want a Fire-type that has an easier time hopping in and out of battle while laying the hurt, give Simisear a try.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choiced sets can be used since Simisear has less issues with Stealth Rock than Charizard and has the stats for the job, but that is pretty much the only advantage Choiced Simisear has over Choiced Charizard, the latter of which is stronger, has more coverage, and is immune to other hazards. Substitute + Endeavor can be used to lure and defeat bulky Pokemon that it could not otherwise, but Charizard's Swords Dance set pulls this concept off much better, and doesn't have to nearly sacrifice itself doing so. Simisear has an expansive physical movepool in Fire Punch, Crunch, and Acrobatics, but Crunch is the only notable one since it can nail specially bulky Psychic-types such as Grumpig, Hypno, and Gardevoir, while the rest are outclassed by its main options. Simisear can pull off a SunnyBeam set, but Solar Power Charizard exists alongside it, stealing the spotlight once again. Simisear has some disruptive options in Taunt, Will-O-Wisp, Amnesia, Yawn, Knock Off, and Covet, but is much too frail to make use of any of them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky Pokemon that resist Fire and aren't weak to its stronger attacks, namely Thick Fat Grumpig, Mantine, Altaria, Dragonair, Flareon, and Thick Fat Munchlax counter Simisear very well. Otherwise, Simisear can prove difficult to switch into, but is easy to revenge kill as its frailty is easily taken advantage of. Faster Pokemon such as Swellow, Tauros and Kadabra can usually dispatch Simisear quickly, but most of them cannot do so after Simisear consumes its Salac Berry. Even then, priority, most notably Aqua Jet from Carracosta or Samurott, easily dents Simisear, as well as Kangaskhan's Fake Out or Gurdurr's Mach Punch, but do note that Simisear resists Ice Shard and Bullet Punch whereas Sucker Punch can be countered with a Substitute. Almost any Choice Scarf Pokemon can put the pressure on Simisear since their attacks tend to do a lot of damage to it. Sometimes it can be as simple as surviving Simisear's attack, then retaliating for usually significant damage. For example, Gorebyss and Alomomola do not take too much from Grass Knot, can survive unboosted Hidden Power Grass, and hit back hard with Water STAB. Most Water-types, especially the heavier ones, make risky responses to Simisear, but otherwise can take a Grass Knot or Hidden Power Grass and KO back; Pokemon such as Regirock and Piloswine also fall into this category. Simisear despises status, especially paralysis, so bulky Pokemon such as Body Slam Lickilicky, Munchlax or Miltank, and Thunder Wave Musharna can stop Simisear.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Like its fellow simians, Simisear aims to nab a boost from Nasty Plot and Salac Berry and sweep. One of the only Fire-types that can use its STAB well enough for sweeping purposes, Simisear aims to raze down all in its path in one fell swoop. Nasty Plot is its boosting move of choice, a selling point Simisear has over Charizard, which has no Special Attack-boosting option. Substitute is used to force Simisear into Salac Berry range without taking too much damage, and has the benefit of dodging Sucker Punch and preventing priority from stopping Simisear in the midst of its sweep, provided the Substitute remains intact beforehand. Focus Blast gets rid of pesky bulky Normal-types such as Lickilicky, Audino, and Thick Fat Miltank while maintaining good coverage with Fire Blast in general, as few opponents resist both Fire and Fighting. Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast so that a miss won't cost the sweep, but is less capable of OHKOing most foes after the +2 boost.</p> <p>Having 4 HP EVs makes Simisear's max HP divisible by four, allowing it to activate Salac Berry with two uses of Substitute or one Substitute after Stealth Rock. Hidden Power Grass or Grass Knot can be used to get rid of Water-types, depending on whether Simisear wants reliable damage against all Water-types such as Gorebyss and Alomomola or slightly stronger hits on heavier Water-types such as Samurott and Seismitoad, but aren't too useful outside of that and Fire + Grass is resisted by Fire-types and Dragon-types. Simisear becomes crazy strong after the boosts, but its poor defensive typing and defenses means attaining them won't be easy. Partners should be able to provide Simisear the optimal setup and sweeping conditions. Gardevoir and Serperior provide dual screens support; Serperior manhandles bothersome Water-types and also tends to lure in weaker Pokemon such as Misdreavus and Metang (without Earthquake) that Simisear could set up on, while Gardevoir can use Memento to further weaken the opponent's attacks and allow Simisear to switch in for free. Stealth Rock support can help to secure important KOs, namely on Charizard, Samurott, and Mandibuzz, among others. Golem or Seismitoad not only set up Stealth Rock, but also lure in Grass-types for Simisear to set up on while covering up Simisear's weaknesses.</p> <p>Priority users can still stop Simisear's sweep; Gurdurr can deal with the majority of priority users (namely Kangaskhan and Skuntank) and can smash Lickilicky easily, while Seismitoad can absorb Aqua Jet from Samurott and Carracosta. Special walls are an issue since this Simisear isn't meant for wallbreaking; wallbreakers are recommended partners to help deal with them lest Simisear's sweep be shortened. Sawk is a prime wallbreaker and lures Misdreavus's Will-O-Wisp which Simisear can switch into, whereas Eelektross provides a slow Volt Switch, can switch in Ground-types, lures in Grass-types, and is a wallbreaker with Superpower all in one. Simisear does not safely set up on very much, so Pokemon that can lure in Fire-weak Pokemon and have switching moves make great partners: U-turn Primeape, Baton Pass Sawsbuck, and Volt Switch Eelektross are such examples.</p>"
      },
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Immediately powerful and threatening, there are few Pokemon slower than mixed Simisear that can comfortably switch into and take its attacks. This Simisear either punches holes into the opponent mid-game or cleans up late-game. STAB Fire Blast threatens a lot of Pokemon such as Sawsbuck, Tangela and Metang, and nets good coverage on the tier. Grass Knot trips up Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types, such as Seismitoad, Golurk, Golem, and Carracosta. Superpower nails the Rock / Steel types, Probopass and Bastiodon, as well as bulky Normal-types such as Lickilicky, Thick Fat Miltank and Thick Fat Munchlax, hard. Hidden Power Rock easily KOes Charizard and threatens Torkoal and Rapidash, while not leaving Simisear totally helpless against Altaria, Mantine, and Flareon.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes offensive potential, with the remaining not dropped into HP to be able to switch into Stealth Rock at most 4 times if unscathed. Focus Blast could be used over Superpower, but Grass Knot is more useful and accurate against the majority of Rock-types while Superpower hits specially defensive Pokemon harder. Rock Slide could possibly be used over Hidden Power Rock, but Rock Slide only hits specially defensive Altaria and Flareon harder; Rock Slide can also miss, whereas Hidden Power Rock can guarantee an OHKO on Charizard and not do piddly against Torkoal. There maybe times where Grass Knot would not be sufficient in covering the majority of Water-types. Pokemon such as Serperior or Leafeon can take advantage of said Water-types, while appreciating Simisear's hole punching capabilities to give themselves a chance to sweep. Electric-types can swiftly remove Water-types, Eelektross receiving a special mention due to its slow Volt Switch bringing Simisear in safely and make a solid wallbreaking core. Stealth Rock setters that can cover the majority of Simisear's weaknesses, such as Seismitoad (Water + Rock) or Torterra (Ground + Rock), make for excellent partners.</p>"

  "Simipour": {
    "overview": "<p>In a tier filled with offensive Water-types, Simipour might not seem like the best choice for your team. However, Simipour is able to separate itself from other Water-types thanks to its great Speed, diverse offensive movepool, good Special Attack, and access to Nasty Plot. With two great abilities in Gluttony and Torrent, Simipour can utilize Substitute better than most other Water-types in the tier to help it set up and sweep entire teams. Despite all of this, Simipour is also incredibly frail and can be taken out with even neutral attacks. Additionally, while Simipour's Speed is great, without a boost of its own, nearly any Choice Scarf user can revenge kill it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Simipour's movepool is pretty extensive, but it makes the best of it in the above sets. One other option is a physical set with Substitute, Endeavor, Acrobatics, and Waterfall, as Water and Flying have good neutral coverage. The set can use Substitute until it has been brought down to a low amount of HP and take out an opposing wall to open up a sweep for a partner. Simipour can also use a mixed set with Work Up or a physical set with Hone Claws, but both are typically inferior to Nasty Plot. However, a mixed set with Acrobatics can be used to lure and defeat many specially defensive Pokemon, including Ludicolo and Roselia, to open the field for itself and other partners. With its great Speed, Simipour can utilize Rain Dance well for rain teams, and it can even take advantage of the rain itself. Other physical moves, such as Crunch, Superpower, Ice Punch, Rock Slide, and Shadow Claw, all might be appealing, but their relatively low Base Power or nasty side effects make special sets generally superior. Finally, Icy Wind and Scald can be used for their appealing secondary effects, but as a more offensive Pokemon, Simipour is better off utilizing its high Base Power attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Mantine is one of the best defensive checks to Simipour, as it takes little damage from most of Simipour's attacks, thanks to its high Special Defense and good typing. However, it should be wary of the rare Hidden Power Electric. Ludicolo is another solid check, thanks to its great defensive typing, and it can set up Rain Dance against Simipour and take it out with Giga Drain. Specially defensive Ludicolo also walls every set. Roselia can take an Ice Beam and either retaliate with a super effective Giga Drain or set up Spikes against Simipour. Other special walls and tanks, such as Lickilicky, Munchlax, Audino, and Regice, all handle each of Simipour's sets fairly easily thanks to their great special bulk. Common Choice Scarf users, including Primeape, Rotom-A, and Tauros, can all revenge kill Simipour easily if it is not behind a Substitute. In general, faster Grass- and Electric-types, such as Electrode and Serperior, have few problems taking Simipour out, but they can both take massive damage from Choice Scarf variants. Finally, priority users, including Gurdurr, Skuntank, and Kangaskhan, can all take out Simipour easily, but Sucker Punch users need to watch out for Substitute.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Simipour is best played as an offensive wallbreaker and boosting attacker. With Nasty Plot, Simipour is able to break through even the bulkiest of specially defensive walls and tanks in the tier. This set also has fantastic coverage and is able to hit any relevant threat in the tier for at least neutral damage. Hydro Pump is Simipour's most powerful STAB option. Outside of this, Simipour runs Ice Beam for coverage against the Dragon- and Grass-type Pokemon that resist its STAB. Finally, Hidden Power Grass allows Simipour to hit other Water-types for solid damage.</p> <p>Because Torrent is illegal with Nasty Plot, Simipour uses Gluttony despite its lack of benefits for this set. Life Orb is the item of choice for Simipour, as it helps increase its offensive presence without requiring a boost in order to hit hard. Other moves might also find their way onto this set. Surf can be used over Hydro Pump as a weaker yet more accurate alternative. Focus Blast can also be used to hit specially bulky Ice- and Normal-type Pokemon, such as Regice, Audino, and Lickilicky, harder than the rest of its coverage moves. Grass Knot can be used over Hidden Power Grass, though its inconsistency is often unappealing. While Grass Knot hits Seismitoad and Samurott a bit harder than Hidden Power Grass, it doesn't do enough to make up for the decrease in damage against Alomomola and Gorebyss. Finally, Hidden Power Electric is another option over Hidden Power Grass to hit Mantine for a massive amount of damage. The choice in Hidden Power often boils down to whether you need to beat Mantine or Seismitoad.</p> <p>Simipour works very well alongside other fast offensive threats, such as Zebstrika, which appreciate the removal of opposing special walls. This way, if Simipour isn't able to sweep, a partner can often clean up later on. Gorebyss also forms a good offensive core with Simipour, as they share many of the same checks and counters. If one of the two is unable to sweep, odds are it will have gone down while heavily weakening the opponent's special wall and thus giving an opening for its partner. Because Simipour often struggles to defeat Mantine and specially defensive Ludicolo, it greatly appreciates working alongside Electric- and Grass-types that can take them out; Eelektross and Exeggutor can handle these Pokemon fairly easily, while Roselia can set up Spikes against them as well.</p>"
      },
      "AcroPour": {
        "description": "<p>This set serves as an extremely effective lure to Simipour's usual counters, KOing them to clear the way for one of Simipour's teammates to sweep. Hydro Pump is Simipour's most powerful STAB move, hitting harder than Acrobatics after the Flying Gem is used. Substitute shields Simipour from status moves, protects it from revenge killers, and lowers its own HP to activate Torrent or utilize a more powerful Endeavor. Acrobatics, with a Flying Gem, OHKOes Roselia and Ludicolo expecting to switch into a Water-type move. By luring and defeating these opponents, teammates that have trouble with them have a much easier time sweeping. Finally, Endeavor allows Simipour to bring down walls that attempt to wall it for an easy KO afterwards. Simipour can also bring down any troublesome threat to the team, as long as Simipour outspeeds it, with the combination of Substitute and Endeavor.</p> <p>Maximum Speed investment is required because it lets Simipour outspeed Charizard, Raichu, and Primeape, which is crucial. 156 Attack EVs are needed to always OHKO specially defensive variants of Roselia and Ludicolo with Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics, even without Stealth Rock support. The leftover EVs are placed into Special Attack to power up Hydro Pump. 0 HP EVs let Simipour create four Substitutes from full health. Simipour can use a fully physical set with Waterfall, but it doesn't hit as hard as Hydro Pump does and misses out on crucial KOs on Torkoal, Armaldo, and Golurk. Hydro Pump also allows Simipour to bluff a special attacking set, enhancing its ability to lure in the aforementioned threats. Similarly, Surf is also not an option to be considered as it too misses out on KOs against Torkoal and Golurk. Ice Beam or Hidden Power Grass can be used over either Acrobatics or Endeavor to grant Simipour additional coverage if either lure is not needed. If Acrobatics is omitted, an EV spread of 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with a Timid nature should be used. Low Kick is an interesting option to defeat Lickilicky and Regice without relying on Endeavor and wasting HP unnecessarily, but Endeavor already does this well enough in addition to bringing down other walls, such as Mantine. Teammates that share similar counters with Simipour are great teammates as they appreciate the lure removing a roadblock and enabling them to sweep. Ludicolo and Gorebyss are examples of exceptional teammates for this reason. Offensive teammates in general appreciate this set's ability to soften up walls and bulky opponents for an easier time sweeping. Simipour enjoys Toxic Spikes support as the residual damage can finish off opponents after being hit by Endeavor; Garbodor and Roselia are examples of Pokemon that can provide this support. They can also tank Grass-type attacks aimed at Simipour, while also absorbing Toxic Spikes so that Simipour isn't worked down too quickly. Finally, Ground-type Pokemon, such as Golem and Torterra, make good partners for their immunity to Electric-type moves and ability to set up Stealth Rock to help Simipour achieve extra KOs, such as against Haunter and Liepard. Notably, most of these Ground-types also attract Ludicolo and Mantine and lure them in to use Hydro Pump and Scald respectively, giving Simipour more opportunities to switch in on these moves and either OHKO or bring down with Substitute and Endeavor.</p>"
      },
      "SubSalac": {
        "description": "<p>With Substitute and a Salac Berry, Simipour is able to make great use of its ability, Gluttony, in order to help it sweep. After only two Substitutes, Simipour is brought to an HP range where it can consume its Salac Berry and hopefully clean the opposing team. Nasty Plot can be helpful in situations where Simipour can force its opponent out and procure a Special Attack boost. Hydro Pump is Simipour's main STAB move, and the extra Base Power is crucial for this set, as it does not sport solid coverage with its two offensive moves. Ice Beam finishes off the set, covering opposing Dragon- and Grass-type Pokemon that Simipour would otherwise struggle to defeat.</p> <p>As this set greatly requires its Salac Berry to activate in order to be totally successful, Simipour needs to use Gluttony in order to attain the Speed boost easily. Surf is a viable alternative to Hydro Pump thanks to its far better accuracy, but keep in mind that the lack of coverage on this set makes it difficult to pass up the addition power. Hidden Power Grass can also be used to cover the Water-types that resist both of Simipour's attacking moves, but is very weak otherwise and Ice Beam provides more coverage overall.</p> <p>As this set focuses on sweeping the opponent, entry hazards are really useful to help it wear down its checks and counters. Specifically, Stealth Rock is needed to attain the OHKO against Lickilicky with Hydro Pump and the 2HKO against Mantine with Ice Beam at +2. Camerupt pairs well with Simipour, as it can both set Stealth Rock and beat the Electric- and Grass-types that threaten it. Specially defensive walls and tanks often cause problems for Simipour, making strong Fighting-types, such as Gurdurr and Sawk, great options for partners to handle them. Defensively, Metang can handle Lapras relatively easily, while Charizard and Lum Berry Skuntank are both good offensive checks that can revenge kill it.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>A Choice Scarf allows Simipour to serve as a very effective revenge killer, outspeeding some of the most common Choice Scarf users, such as Charizard and Primeape, and taking them out with ease. Hydro Pump is the STAB move of choice for Simipour, as a lack of boosting move or item means it needs all the power it can get. Ice Beam covers the Dragon- and Grass-types that resist its STAB, while Hidden Power Grass patches up Simipour's coverage and hits opposing Water-types. Focus Blast gives Simipour a way of denting most special walls and tanks, such as Lickilicky, Audino, and Regice. However, Surf can be used to give Simipour a more reliable STAB move to clean up with toward the end of the game.</p> <p>Grass Knot can be used on the set to hit Mantine and Samurott harder than Hidden Power Grass, but its low Base Power against Gorebyss makes it less worthwhile, especially considering +2 Speed Gorebyss is still outsped by Choice Scarf Simipour. Hidden Power Electric can also be used over Hidden Power Grass to deal massive damage to Mantine and Pelipper, but Seismitoad is more common.</p> <p>As this set is primarily a revenge killer and late-game cleaner, it has troubles beating many of the bulkier walls in the tier. Sawk, Primeape, Gurdurr, and other Fighting-types make good partners to beat most of them with ease. Similarly, Mandibuzz and Golbat can both be used as more defensive checks to the same Pokemon, as the combination of Taunt, Toxic, and reliable recovery can be used to break almost every wall in NU. Faster Choice Scarf users, such as Zebstrika and Tauros, can be problematic for teams using Simipour as their only way to revenge kill Pokemon. Having a nice defensive core with Pokemon such as Golem and Piloswine is a great way to handle them, while more offensive teams can utilize Kangaskhan to revenge kill them with its priority attacks.</p>"

  "Unfezant": {
    "overview": "<p>Simply put, Unfezant is not a good Pokemon in NU, being outclassed by almost every other Normal / Flying type in the metagame. Its main problem is its terrible movepool, even in comparison to other birds; it has almost no offensive movepool whatsoever (not even a decent Flying STAB) and although it has a slightly better support movepool, it lacks the bulk to take advantage of this. It hardly has a niche at all, and there is overall little reason to use it over Braviary, Swellow, or even Dodrio most of the time.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Unfezant has a lot of healing moves, including Wish, Roost, and Morning Sun, but it is unlikely to be able to pull off the last two and it is outclassed as a Wish user due to its mediocre HP stat; its Stealth Rock weakness further limits any potential usage for pure support, something that Pokemon such as Audino do not have problems with. Toxic can be used to get past the many Pokemon that Unfezant doesn't have the coverage moves to defeat, but it doesn't have the space. Its decent offensive stats and U-turn might look appealing for a Choice Band or Choice Scarf set, but its only offensive moves with any competitive merit are Return, Quick Attack, Pluck, U-turn, and Steel Wing, which give awful coverage. Taunt, U-turn, and weather-inducing moves can make Unfezant a decent weather supporter, but there are better options out there to fill that role.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Lum Berry Golem is the best counter to Unfezant, as it doesn't care about Hypnosis and can bypass its Unfezant's Focus Sash with Rock Blast. Other than Golem, Unfezant struggles to break through any Pokemon with a Rock or Steel typing, including but not limited to Probopass, Regirock, and Metang. Electabuzz doesn't take Return very well, but it is faster and has Vital Spirit to negate Hypnosis. Ghost-types such as Haunter and Misdreavus can set up a Substitute or completely wall Unfezant, and Misdreavus even gets Taunt to render Unfezant useless. Due to Unfezant's lack of powerful attacks and reliance on a Normal STAB move, almost any Pokemon with good physical bulk will wall Unfezant rather easily, and due to its lackluster bulk, anything faster than it, especially those with special moves such as Charizard, can easily OHKO Unfezant if its Focus Sash is broken.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tailwind Support": {
        "description": "<p>The best Unfezant can do is support offensive teams with Tailwind to increase their Speed temporarily and help its teammates switch in safely to take advantage of Tailwind as much as possible. Hypnosis puts the opponent to sleep so Unfezant can set up Tailwind while still having time to U-turn into a teammate in order to have an optimal matchup. If the need arises Unfezant can attack using STAB Return, which hits somewhat hard due to Unfezant's good Attack and is the strongest viable move Unfezant has access to. While the premise of this set is simple, Unfezant is still rather unreliable at best, as it is reliant on the inaccurate Hypnosis and the foe being asleep for several turns. Even then, Tailwind is not the greatest strategy as it only lasts for four turns, one of which is most likely used switching Unfezant out.</p> <p>A Focus Sash is used so that Unfezant can survive a hit just in case Hypnosis misses or the opponent is faster. The good news for Unfezant is that it outspeeds Jolly Braviary by one point with an Adamant nature, so it can use Hypnosis on it before getting attacked. Jolly can be used to outspeed Pokemon such as Zangoose and Jolly Sawk that could otherwise defeat Unfezant rather quickly. However, it will usually outspeed all opponents after Tailwind, meaning that the Speed boost from Jolly isn't as important afterward. While maximum HP could be used rather than maximum Attack, Return actually can do a bit of damage and Unfezant still isn't that bulky even with maximum HP. Taunt is a decent alternative way to find a turn to try to set up Tailwind, but Hypnosis is ultimately better despite the imperfect accuracy, as it can incapacitate a Pokemon rather than just block its status moves. In regards to teammates, offensive Pokemon that have a decent Speed but aren't quite fast enough, such as Samurott, Exeggutor, Zangoose, and Sawk, appreciate the boost provided by Tailwind, enabling them to outspeed faster Pokemon that would normally threaten them, such as Charizard. As Unfezant is usually used as a lead and will rarely be useful or have any useful, lasting effects after the first few turns, its weaknesses do not need to be accounted for.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>In a tier filled with Rock-types, Gigalith struggles to stand out. Gigalith often finds itself as a Custap lead that sets up Stealth Rock and then finishes with an attack. Its sole Rock typing makes it outclassed offensively by Golem and defensively by Regirock. A stronger Rock Blast and Explosion might make it seem better than Golem, but Golem gets STAB on Earthquake and an Electric-type immunity, which makes it better overall. Gigalith's main selling point is Sturdy, which lets it almost always survive a hit and set up Stealth Rock. Also, great offensive presence and a powerful Explosion are good reasons to choose Gigalith if you need a suicide lead.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Superpower can be used for a more powerful way to break through Rock- and Steel-types, but the Attack drop really hinders Gigalith. Autotomize can raise Gigalith's pitiful Speed, but Gigalith is quite vulnerable to priority, limiting the effectiveness of doing this. Choice Band can be used as an instant way to raise Gigalith's power, but Gigalith relies on its coverage and switching moves too much for this to be worth it in general. Heavy Slam hits fellow Rock-types hard but has a horrible offensive typing. Although Gigalith's main goal is to deal damage early-game, Toxic can be a surprise to physical walls which take little damage from Gigalith's attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Choice Band Sawk can break through Sturdy with Mold Breaker and OHKO Gigalith with Close Combat, making it a good counter. Wartortle is the next best counter to Gigalith because can take Gigalith's attacks with ease and beats Gigalith one-on-one with Scald and Rapid Spin. Tangela can get around Gigalith by using Sleep Powder and 2HKOing it with Giga Drain. Misdreavus can shut down Gigalith by using Taunt in conjunction with Will-O-Wisp, rendering Gigalith harmless. Bulky Ground-types such as Torterra, which beats Gigalith but cannot prevent Stealth Rock being set up, and Golurk, which though it does not often run it, can get around Stealth Rock 50% of the time with Dynamic Punch are also decent answers to Gigalith. Marowak is a great answer to Gigalith because it can bypass Sturdy with Bonemerang. Alomomola can live any of Gigalith's attacks and heal off the damage with Wish or Regenerator.</p>",

Explosion is the main attack for Gigalith, letting it go out with a bang. Rock Blast breaks Substitute and Focus Sash, while also being a semi-reliable STAB move. Earthquake hits Rock-types and Steel-types that would otherwise freely switch in on Gigalith. Sturdy guarantees that Gigalith can almost always set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p>The EVs outspeed uninvested Carracosta. Custap Berry lets Gigalith move before everything in its priority bracket, but does not prevent it from being outsped by priority moves. As far as partners go, Golurk, Haunter, and Drifblim are great offensive spinblockers and appreciate Stealth Rock. Stone Edge can be used over Rock Blast for added power; however, Rock Blast is much more helpful because it breaks Substitute. Normal Gem can be used as a way to boost the power of Explosion, but Custap Berry is better because of the pseudo-Speed boost it grants. Leftovers can be used for passive recovery, but Gigalith is better off as a suicide lead. Lum Berry can also be used to avoid status, but Custap Berry is consistently useful. Gigalith fits in well on offensive teams, as offensive partners such as Ludicolo, Sawk, and Braviary enjoy Stealth Rock and Explosion, which weaken walls to the point that these Pokemon are be able to break through.</p>"

  "Seismitoad": {
    "overview": "<p>Seismitoad has several qualities that earn it a spot on many teams in NU. Its stats are very well-balanced, making it a threat to look out for both offensively and defensively. Its excellent bulk, Water / Ground typing, and incredibly useful ability in Water Absorb allow Seismitoad to serve as a capable defensive pivot. On the other hand, Seismitoad's access to powerful attacks, such as Hydro Pump and Earthquake, and Swift Swim ability ensure its capability as a sweeper and offensive tank as well. Its access to Stealth Rock only adds to its viability, as it functions incredibly well as a Stealth Rock setter thanks to its ability to threaten out a large majority of the tier and set it up. Unfortunately, Seismitoad's lack of reliable recovery severely hinders its ability to check multiple threats on a team; in other words, it's worn down quite easily, especially with the offensive nature of the metagame. While its typing might bless it with various resistances and immunities, it also burdens Seismitoad with a crippling 4x weakness to Grass that opponents can easily use to their advantage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Seismitoad does have a rather shallow movepool (even lacking moves such as Waterfall and Ice Beam), and most of its options have already been covered. RestTalk is Seismitoad's only form of recovery, but RestTalk is far too unreliable to work and often ends up doing more harm than good due to forcing Seismitoad to give up two valuable moveslots. Focus Blast can be used on the offensive sets to provide coverage against Normal-types, such as Lickilicky and Audino. Unfortunately, they are both bulky enough that they can take Focus Blast and heal it off, so it doesn't help much at all. Seismitoad's physical movepool is relatively expansive, with access to moves such as Earthquake, Drain Punch, Ice Punch, and Rock Slide, so a fully physical set sounds decent at first. The lack of a Water-type STAB is rather disappointing, though. Likewise, a mixed set using moves such as Hydro Pump, Earthquake, Sludge Bomb, and Drain Punch sounds plausible, but it doesn't end up accomplishing anything Seismitoad's other sets can't already do.</p> <p>A special mention goes to a set carrying both Substitute and Toxic, allowing Seismitoad to systematically break down walls such as Alomomola. It does, however, detract from Seismitoad's sweeping potential quite a bit. It's still a perfectly viable set, though; it just doesn't differentiate itself enough to warrant its own set. Another interesting choice is the combination of Substitute and Endeavor, allowing Seismitoad to lure in and defeat many of its counters; this is somewhat difficult to pull off, however, and detracts from Seismitoad's utility. Poison Touch might sound interesting on physical sets, but in reality it is just straight-up outclassed by Seismitoad's other two abilities. Rindo Berry is an interesting item, particularly on the more defensive sets; it allows Seismitoad to survive one Grass-type move and proceed to do what it likes. However, this does not make up for a lack of Leftovers, and it only works once. Finally, Choice Specs is usable, but it is inferior to other offensive sets, as they boast far more utility.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As it stands, Grass-types are the best clear-cut answers to Seismitoad; not only do they resist its STAB combination, but they can OHKO in return with their STABs. A Grass / Poison-type, such as Vileplume, fares even better against Seismitoad—not only is it not weak to Sludge Bomb, but it is immune to Toxic as well, leaving Seismitoad with near no hope of emerging victorious. As Seismitoad is not overly powerful, special walls generally fare well against it. Lickilicky and Altaria are two prime example of this, thanks to their ability to take Seismitoad's attacks with ease and heal off Toxic with Heal Bell. Mantine is basically a complete stop to any Seismitoad; it is immune to both its STABs, can heal off Toxic thanks to Rest, and can whittle away at Seismitoad's health with Air Slash. Regice is another great counter to Seismitoad, not fearing Toxic thanks to Rest and taking it down with a few Ice Beams. Finally, residual damage—in addition to simply pounding away at it with powerful attacks—is effective at wearing down Seismitoad, as its lack of reliable recovery can easily be used against it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its excellent typing, useful ability, and good bulk, Seismitoad is extremely effective with a physically based defensive set. It matches up excellently against the most common users of Stealth Rock in the tier: Golem, Piloswine, Golurk, Regirock, and Armaldo, all of which are weak to its STAB moves and are physical attackers. In addition, their special bulk is average at best, meaning that Seismitoad can dispose of them easily with Scald. To truly appreciate just how effective Seismitoad is at taking on these Pokemon, it's only 3HKOed by Golurk, has a 25% chance to be 4HKOed by Golem, is 4HKOed by Piloswine, and is only 5HKOed by Armaldo, while Regirock cannot even touch it. These are all Pokemon with high Attack stats, generally full offensive investment, and powerful Earthquakes. Being physically based also makes Seismitoad the best counter to one of the most threatening Pokemon in the tier: Shell Smash Carracosta. However, Seismitoad is not limited to taking resisted hits; both Choice Band Sawk and Braviary fail to OHKO it even after Stealth Rock and Spikes damage, while Seismitoad can deal a powerful blow to Sawk's reduced defenses or potentially burn them both with Scald.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is an obvious choice on a Pokemon that matches up so well against the other Pokemon that set it up and outspeeds all of them even with a Relaxed nature. Major threats such as Braviary, Charizard, and Mandibuzz hate having to lose so much of their HP when they switch in, and Seismitoad is extremely reliable at ensuring this happens. Scald is the obligatory STAB move of choice on a defensive Water-type Pokemon such as Seismitoad, and the relatively high chance to burn the opponent makes Seismitoad even more of a full stop to physical attackers. Earth Power is used in the third slot to hit Pokemon such as Garbodor hard.  The last slot is fairly variable. Toxic is the recommended choice, as bulky Grass-types, such as Serperior and Ludicolo, love to switch into Seismitoad but absolutely despise being badly poisoned. It's also an excellent way to wear down other bulky Water-types, such as Alomomola. Knock Off is a more colorful option that can be used to scout potential sets based on the opponent's item and is very handy for crippling the many Eviolite users that reside in the tier.</p> <p>Protect is another possible move to use in the last slot. It enables Seismitoad to regain more HP from Leftovers and again allows you to scout effectively and react accordingly. More specifically, it allows Seismitoad to check for any random Hidden Power Grasses or Grass Knots from the likes of Samurott and opposing Seismitoad. It's especially lethal if Seismitoad is paired with a Toxic Spikes user, as the extra turns to whittle the opponent's HP can be crucial.</p> <p>The EVs on this set are fairly specific. Defense is maximized so that Seismitoad can take on the threats it's supposed to counter with maximum efficiency, while 200 HP EVs hit a Leftovers number. The 56 EVs in Special Defense ensure that Seismitoad is never OHKOed by Hidden Power Grass from Life Orb Zebstrika and Electrode. It even has a good chance to avoid the OHKO after Stealth Rock damage and can proceed to OHKO both of them in return with Earth Power. A specially defensive EV spread is viable and helps Seismitoad better check the likes of Electric-types. but it loses the ability to beat opposing Stealth Rock leads as well as Shell Smash Carracosta. Some Speed EVs are also an option, with 24 coupled with either a Bold nature allowing Seismitoad to outspeed maximum Speed Golem, but this detracts from Seismitoad's bulk.</p> <p>Ideal teammates for Seismitoad will be able to switch into the Grass-type attacks targeted at it with little to no risk. Sap Sipper Pokemon, such as Miltank and Sawsbuck, can gain a boost to their Attack for free and then do as they please. Roselia has excellent defensive synergy with Seismitoad, as it takes next to nothing from Grass-type attacks and can strike back at their users with its STAB Sludge Bomb. It also handles special threats akin to how Seismitoad takes care of physical ones and has the ability to set up additional entry hazards. Metang is another solid choice for a teammate, with the two covering each other's weaknesses nicely and Metang's access to Stealth Rock freeing Seismitoad to use another move in lieu of it. Flying-types are also good partners, as they can switch in on Grass-types easily and immediately threaten them with their STAB moves. Articuno, Braviary, and Charizard are notable examples, as Articuno has the sheer bulk and STAB combination to beat practically any Grass-type, Braviary can use them as setup fodder, and Charizard sports a quadruple resistance to Grass, while Seismitoad also covers all of Charizard's weaknesses perfectly. Other than that, it's really Seismitoad who supports the team and not the other way around.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes a more offensive approach to setting up Stealth Rock in order to take advantage of its excellent offensive typing, while still matching up brilliantly against opposing Stealth Rock leads. With the combination of its two STABs, Seismitoad is capable of taking down nearly every Stealth Rock lead in the tier barring the rare Torterra and Cradily, effectively turning it into a powerful anti-lead. While it certainly can't stomach Earthquakes as well as more defensive sets can, it really doesn't need to, as its higher offensive presence allows it to take down opposing leads in one or two hits.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is a staple on this set, as Seismitoad is such a reliable setter of it and can then follow up with a powerful attack. While Seismitoad does somewhat lack power, Hydro Pump's high Base Power more than makes up for this, making quick work of common leads such as Golurk, Golem, Piloswine, Armaldo, and Regirock. Earth Power is Seismitoad's chosen Ground STAB, notably hitting Steel-types such as Metang, Probopass, and Bastiodon, none of which can do much in return. Finally, the last moveslot is generally reserved for Toxic, deterring bulky walls and Grass-types from switching in, as the chip damage can go a long way in ensuring one doesn't get swept by the likes of Ludicolo and Serperior. Grass Knot, on the other hand, is a viable coverage move that adds to Seismitoad's ability as an anti-lead; while it doesn't appear to provide much in coverage, it punishes opposing Seismitoad, which in itself makes it viable. Aside from that, though, Toxic is the more useful choice.</p> <p>The given EV spread allows Seismitoad to outspeed maximum Speed Golem, maximizes power, and puts the rest into bulk to give it a bit more longevity. Maximum Speed investment can be used, but as Seismitoad's main goal is to take down opposing Stealth Rock leads, it isn't necessary. Leftovers further capitalizes on Seismitoad's good natural bulk, allowing it to take random hits with less pressure. To players who are less conservative and more focused on OHKOing certain leads, Expert Belt is an interesting item choice to consider; this makes Seismitoad capable of OHKOing standard Piloswine with Hydro Pump. This especially comes in handy when using Grass Knot, allowing Seismitoad to OHKO opposing bulky Seismitoad. On that note, Life Orb is an even more offensive approach that powers up all of Seismitoad's attacks; this, however, does not bring any notable KOs along with it, and it detracts from Seismitoad's tanking abilities.</p> <p>The fourth moveslot can also vary somewhat from Toxic and Grass Knot, with some honorable mentions including Hidden Power Ice and Sludge Bomb. Hidden Power Ice is most notable for hitting Torterra and Cradily, the two Stealth Rock leads Seismitoad is not capable of beating otherwise, for super effective damage. While it does improve Seismitoad's coverage quite a bit, neither of these Pokemon are common enough to warrant its use, and it still fails to 2HKO Cradily anyway. Sludge Bomb also provides decent coverage, most notably against Ludicolo. However, this does not help Seismitoad achieve any KOs against opposing leads, and it shouldn't be staying in on Ludicolo anyway.</p> <p>Seismitoad can set up Stealth Rock, prevent the opponent from setting up their own Stealth Rock, and easily dispose of its common setters. Because of this, any Pokemon that can take advantage of all of this is a quality partner. Braviary and Charizard are some of the best examples of this, all handily appreciating Seismitoad's services and in return easily dealing with Grass-types, foes which Seismitoad quickly falls to. This set finds its home mainly on offensive teams that enjoy the Stealth Rock support it provides without losing momentum. Seismitoad does not outstall the opponent through sheer bulk like defensive sets do; it uses its natural bulk to tank one or two hits and its greater power to make KOing them easier.</p>"
      },
      "Swift Swim": {
        "description": "<p>This is the most offensive approach to Seismitoad you can take and is its best shot at sweeping. While it might have inferior offensive stats and a narrower offensive movepool than other Swift Swim sweepers such as Gorebyss and Ludicolo, Seismitoad has two qualities that set it apart from its competition: an immunity to Electric and access to Stealth Rock. This can be key for many dedicated rain teams, who would often otherwise lack both. While there are often better choices for standalone rain sweepers, Seismitoad plays the role of both a supporter and a sweeper, and it pulls it off well.</p> <p>Rain Dance is the obvious focus of the set; doubling Seismitoad's Speed and significantly increasing its power is mandatory to begin its sweep. Also, because Seismitoad often finds itself paired up with other rain sweepers, they can often pick up each other's slack should one of them be taken down. Hydro Pump is the obvious Water STAB, hitting extremely hard when factoring in rain and the Life Orb boost. Earth Power is used to hit Garbodor &amp; other Ground-weak Pokemon hard, though Earthquake is stronger against Roselia. Finally, Stealth Rock is an extremely useful move in the last slot, allowing Seismitoad to support its team and still be able to reliably sweep in the rain. As many rain teams often lack a Stealth Rock setter, it's also a massive selling point in that regard. That said, if your team does already have a Stealth Rock setter, Sludge Bomb provides great coverage alongside Seismitoad's STABs, notably hitting Grass-types for super effective damage.</p> <p>With maximum Speed investment, Seismitoad can outspeed everything up to +1 base 100 Speed Pokemon in the rain, and the rest of the EVs emphasize on power. A Modest nature is used to maximize Seismitoad's offensive power, though if Earthquake is used a Mild nature &amp; 4 Attack EVs are recommended to secure a 2HKO on Roselia with Earthquake.</p> <p>Surf continues the never-ending debate of power vs. accuracy; in this case, however, the power of Hydro Pump has priority as Seismitoad is not the strongest attacker around. Finally, if Life Orb's recoil doesn't appeal to you, Damp Rock and Leftovers are viable alternatives. Both have unique traits surrounding them, with the former extending rain turns and the latter increasing longevity. The power boost from Life Orb is far more important, though, and as this set plays a bit more recklessly than others, Life Orb recoil is often negligible.</p> <p>As stated before, this Seismitoad works best on dedicated rain teams thanks to its access to both Stealth Rock and Rain Dance, and its partners should reflect that. Articuno is a great way to deal with problematic Grass-types easily and also benefits from rain with a 100% accurate Hurricane &amp; patching up its Fire weakness. Roselia and Vileplume also pair up with Seismitoad well; not only do they 4x resist Grass and can retaliate back with STAB Sludge Bomb, but they also enjoy the rain thanks to having their Fire weakness removed. Finally, Ludicolo is an excellent partner for this set, as it absolutely loves having both rain and Stealth Rock already set up when it enters the field and in general shares great offensive synergy with Seismitoad.</p>"

  "Leavanny": {
    "overview": "<p>Leavanny's typing is very uncommon, with its dual STABs hitting the premier walls of NU, such as Musharna, Tangela, and Alomomola, for super effective damage. It has a nice Attack stat with some fun moves to play with. Unfortunately, its Speed falls just short of the 95 Speed tier, being outsped by Haunter. Leavanny also has an unfortunate weakness to Stealth Rock, stripping away 25% of its health every time it switches in. Leavanny's bulk isn't the best and leaves much to be desired. Its typing is a dual-edged sword; while it provides great resistances to common Fighting-, Grass-, Water-, Ground-, and Electric-types, it also provides unfortunate weaknesses to Fire, Flying, Ice, and Rock. Despite all these flaws, Leavanny can provide substantial team support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sunny Day is an option to take advantage of Chlorophyll, but then it has to give up a moveslot and will just be a lot weaker to Fire-type moves. Leavanny also has access to dual screens, but Serperior outclasses it as it has access to Taunt, better Speed and bulk, and a lack of a Stealth Rock weakness. Calm Mind is an option if you opt for a special or Baton Pass set, but Musharna outclasses it in every way. Giga Drain is a recovery option, but it is very weak and Synthesis is more reliable. A Mind Reader and Grass Whistle combo looks good on paper, but is very gimmicky, difficult to set up, and Leavanny is better off attacking or supporting its team with Heal Bell. Leavanny can opt for a full attacking set, but it isn't very useful and is easily worn down. Shadow Claw is one of Leavanny's few other physical moves worth considering, as it hits Misdreavus and Drifblim for nice damage. Return is another option to knock out Charizard after Stealth Rock. Finally, a special set could work as it has access to many special moves such as Air Slash, Bug Buzz, Energy Ball, and Leaf Storm, but it has a very low Special Attack, so they will not be doing much.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Poison-types, such as Garbodor and Golbat, take absolutely nothing from any of Leavanny's moves, even if they are boosted. Fire-types literally incinerate it to pieces and take nothing from either of its STABs. Flying-types put a halt to Leavanny, especially Mandibuzz and Braviary. Leavanny is hard walled by Steel-types, as it has no moves to effectively hit them at all. Any Pokemon that has base 93 Speed or above ruins its day and can easily kill it off, as it is very frail, leaving it open to being revenge killed. Taunt makes it so it cannot heal or remove status, making it much less useful. Leavanny's Stealth Rock weakness is also a burden, as it loses 25% of its HP just for switching, however Synthesis somewhat makes up for this.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<p>This set capitalizes on Leavanny's typing and movepool, using its most useful moves in its arsenal as well as possible. It is mandatory for Leavanny to have STAB moves, as that is one of the few reasons to use it at all. Leavanny is usually attacking straight away since it does not want to waste turns when checks and counters are still in play—which is very often the case. Synthesis heals off any entry hazard damage taken, while also mitigating the damage done by Life Orb. Synthesis is also particularly useful, as it becomes a shield from Sucker Punch, which Leavanny can survive from any Pokemon in the tier at full health. Heal Bell is great for team support and also removes any status that gives Leavanny trouble. Synthesis, in conjunction with Heal Bell, allows Leavanny to beat various walls such as Alomomola and Wartortle, among various other Pokemon.</p> <p>Jolly is crucial to outspeed base 90 Speed tier Pokemon, such as Zangoose, who is OHKOed after Stealth Rock. Life Orb is required for maximum damage output, scoring the OHKO on Golurk, Zangoose, and Ludicolo, while achieving the 2HKO on Alomomola and Musharna. Swords Dance can help muscle past walls such as Musharna and Alomomola before they can heal, but Leavanny is easily revenge killed and it won't be staying around long enough anyway. Swarm is Leavanny's other ability, but is as situational as Chlorophyll, which is more effective in general. Magic Coat is an option to bounce back entry hazards and status, but Heal Bell keeps status away and is not as difficult to predict; however, Magic Coat Leavanny is a solid check to Prankster users such as Riolu and Liepard. Carracosta is a great teammate as Leavanny and Carracosta cover each others weaknesses almost perfectly, and Carracosta can also set up Stealth Rock for Leavanny. Leavanny appreciates a teammate that can absorb Toxic Spikes, such as Skuntank, which can also Pursuit trap Misdreavus and Haunter, both of which give Leavanny trouble. Torkoal is an option as a spinner to start forming a Fire / Water / Grass core and take on all the Fire- and Bug-type attacks aimed at Leavanny. RestTalk Regice is a great partner as it can stop rain teams and Articuno and Vileplume, Pokemon Leavanny struggles with, while Leavanny can remove its sleep status with Heal Bell. Eelektross makes for a good partner to muscle through Mandibuzz, as well as other Flying-types that Leavanny cannot beat. Another partner that works well is Misdreavus, as it can spinblock and Taunt any Stealth Rock leads.</p>"

  "Lampent": {
    "overview": "<p>Lampent struggles to find much use, but it has a specific niche. Lampent can set and utilize Trick Room with an offensive set better than the majority of other Trick Room setters. It has a good offensive typing and coverage, alongside several useful resistances that let it set up Trick Room despite its relatively poor bulk. It also has access to two good abilities in Flash Fire and Flame Body. Flash Fire powers up its own Fire-type moves whenever Lampent is hit by one, and Flame Body can be useful for getting a surprise burn on an opponent. However, Lampent's typing also gives it some common weaknesses, including weaknesses to Rock-, Dark-, and Water-type attacks, which opens it up to a lot of damage from several moves, notably Stealth Rock, Pursuit, and Sucker Punch. Charizard gives Lampent a lot of competition as an offensive Fire-type, and Misdreavus similarly gives it competition as a Ghost-type. Trick Room in general isn't a very good strategy, but it is the main thing that makes Lampent worth using.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lampent can hold an Eviolite to increase its bulk, but the power from Life Orb is really needed to achieve those vital KOs. Choice Specs is another item that lets Lampent hit really hard, but being locked into a single move and unable to use Trick Room isn't worth the significant power increase. A Calm Mind set can be used to decent effect. However, Lampent often finds itself lacking the bulk necessary to set up enough Calm Minds to be effective, and its lack of reliable recovery really hurts it. Will-O-Wisp can be used to get a more reliable burn than Flame Body, but the accuracy is still annoying, and Lampent isn't quite bulky enough to be running utility sets. It can run Substitute alongside either Calm Mind or Pain Split which can work to decent effect. Lampent rarely finds opportunities to set up enough, however, so it is better off without setup moves. It can utilize Taunt to shut down a wall, which can be very useful for dealing with some of Lampent's checks and counters. Haze can put a stop to a setup sweeper, but if they've set up too much they will probably OHKO anyway thanks to Lampent's mediocre bulk. Lampent has access to a few other coverage options including Psychic and Dark Pulse, but they don't provide much actual coverage that the three main attacking moves don't already cover.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Dark-types give Lampent quite a bit of trouble. Skuntank can use Sucker Punch to KO Lampent or predict a switch and go for Pursuit. Mandibuzz is bulky enough to take any hit it wants and simply Roost off the damage while also dealing a lot of damage with Foul Play. Water-types can OHKO Lampent with their STAB moves and are quite a problem, though Energy Ball can be used against them as long as Trick Room is up. Carracosta and Samurott are especially annoying as they have priority Aqua Jet to surpass the Trick Room. Specially defensive Pokemon take hardly any damage from Lampent's attacks and can easily stall out its Life Orb recoil damage. Examples include Audino, Lickilicky, and Probopass. Zweilous gets a special mention as it resists all of Lampent's moves and can easily phaze it out with Dragon Tail or Roar. Sucker Punch users such as Skuntank, Kangaskhan, and Golem can revenge kill Lampent before it can get off an attack. Residual damage, especially from Stealth Rock and Toxic, really stack up on Lampent thanks to its lack of reliable recovery and its already slightly crippling Life Orb recoil. Trick Room can easily be stalled out, which leaves Lampent open to being revenge killed by many Pokemon in the tier.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Lampent can use its solid amount of resistances and immunities to help itself set up Trick Room and proceed to hit fairly hard. Moreover, due to its low Speed, Lampent moves before a majority of Pokemon under Trick Room, and deals out lots of damage thanks to its relatively high Special Attack and good coverage. Fire Blast is the main STAB move and hurts almost everything that doesn't resist it, and even some Pokemon that do. Shadow Ball is the secondary STAB attack and provides good coverage as well as a more reliable move to use repeatedly because of Fire Blast's accuracy. Energy Ball is the coverage move of choice to hit bulky Water-types such as Seismitoad and Rock-types such as Golem and Regirock. Memento is a useful move to play around counters such as Skuntank, and also supports teammates by helping them set up on a weakened opponent.</p> <p>Life Orb is the item of choice, as it allows Lampent to achieve key KOs, such as the OHKO against Sawk and Charizard after Stealth Rock with Fire Blast and Shadow Ball, respectively. Flash Fire is useful for getting power boosts to Fire Blast when switching in on an opponent's Fire-type attack. It also lets Lampent set up on Choice Specs Charizard, which is an impressive feat. Flame Body is an alternate option that can punish priority users such as Aqua Jet Samurott, Sucker Punch Skuntank, and Sucker Punch Kangaskhan with a surprise burn. With the exception of Charizard, Fire-types are rare in NU, so Flame Body may be the better choice depending on how your team does against Charizard. Lampent appreciates slow pivots such as Baton Pass Musharna and Volt Switch Probopass as partners so that it can switch in safely without taking a hit. Eelektross is immune to the Ground-type attacks that target Lampent, has a slow Volt Switch, and also benefits from the Trick Room Lampent sets up. Choice Band Sawk and Taunt Samurott are useful partners to help prevent Stealth Rock from going up and also break down walls that trouble Lampent. Roselia has decent synergy with Lampent and can set up Spikes, which are very useful if Lampent wants to attempt a sweep.</p>"

  "Arbok": {
    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written around the time that BW was considered the main generation. The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW NU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>In a tier filled with Psychic- and Ground-type Pokemon, it is no wonder that Arbok has difficulty performing well. Arbok has subpar offensive stats, and it is rather frail, which means that just about any super effective attack—or even a strong neutral one—will OHKO it. However, it is a good setup sweeper thanks to its access to Coil, and while it isn't inherently bulky, it has a good defensive typing. Despite its Poison typing gives it weaknesses to two common offensive types, it also gives Arbok important resistances to Fighting-, Grass-, and Bug-type attacks, allowing it to set up on the likes of Roselia, Primeape, and more. Arbok also has two great abilities, Intimidate and Shed Skin, with the former allowing it to set up in against many physical attackers, and the latter letting it set up without any fear of status. On top of this, in a hazard-infested metagame, Pokemon that can absorb Toxic Spikes often have an easier time fitting onto teams. Overall, Arbok is a worthy candidate for a team, but it requires some support in order to succeed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Arbok can use a bulkier spread with Coil in order to set up on powerful attackers more easily. However, it requires both the Attack and Speed to sweep, which such a spread would lose out on. Arbok has a few other moves it can utilize. Out of these, Thunder Fang, Ice Fang, and Fire Fang seem like good options, but they do not provide much coverage and have very low Base Power. Rock Slide is in the same boat, as it has low Base Power and offers redundant coverage. Arbok also gains access to moves such as Rain Dance, Sunny Day, Dragon Tail, and Glare, but it is typically better off attacking. Pursuit might seem like a decent idea; however, as a Poison-type Pokemon, Arbok cannot really force Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon to switch out--Psychic-types can just stay in and knock it out. Disable is another option, but a lack of immunities to efficiently take advantage of it makes it a poor choice. Arbok can use a Choice Band set with Switcheroo to hit hard right off the bat, but while Poison STAB offers decent neutral coverage, it isn't very good to lock into, and Gunk Shot's poor accuracy means that a miss can lead to Arbok's demise. Similarly, it can also use Choice Scarf, but its base Speed is lackluster for a Choice Scarf user, and it is very weak without a boost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>While Arbok is powerful when it has set up, it is relatively frail and will not be able to set up easily, so offensive pressure is the single best way to deal with Arbok. However, this is not to say that counters do not exist. Bulky variants of Musharna can easily OHKO Arbok with Psychic, while Arbok cannot 2HKO it back even after a Coil boost. Ground-type Pokemon such as Golurk and Piloswine can easily stomach even boosted hits and OHKO Arbok. Seismitoad must watch out for Seed Bomb, but bulkier variants can even live a +1 Seed Bomb, making it a decent check, while variants without Seed Bomb are walled and forces out. Steel-type Pokemon such as Bastiodon, Probopass, and Metang can easily deal with variants lacking Earthquake, and Bastiodon can even phaze Arbok out as well. Klang gets a special mention, as it can set up alongside Arbok and eventually KO it, and Clear Body means that Intimidate can't lower its Attack. Misdreavus and Frillish also wall Intimidate variants and can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp, but Shed Skin variants can actually set up on them. Mandibuzz can check Arbok as well; although it is 2HKOed by a +1 Gunk Shot after Stealth Rock, it can phaze Arbok out with Whirlwind or attack it with a STAB Foul Play. Encore users, such as Primeape and Liepard, can come in on Arbok while it sets up and lock it into Coil, forcing it to switch out. Finally, revenge killing Arbok is a good way to deal with it. Sawsbuck is one of the better revenge killers to defeat Arbok, as it can dodge Sucker Punch with Nature Power and deal massive damage to it. Other faster Pokemon such as Haunter can set up a Substitute against Arbok in hopes of dodging a Sucker Punch and take it out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Coil": {
        "description": "<p>With access to Coil, a move that boosts Attack, Defense, and accuracy, as well as a high-powered STAB move, Arbok can become very threatening after a single boost. Arbok utilizes its good defensive typing and Coil to set up against a variety of offensive and defensive Pokemon, boosting its Attack while simultaneously making it harder to revenge kill. Gunk Shot is the main STAB move, and it works very well in conjunction with Coil, which brings its shaky 70% accuracy up to 91% after just one boost. Sucker Punch gives Arbok a way of defeating the faster Pokemon that try to revenge kill it. In the last slot, Earthquake can be used for coverage against Steel- and Rock-types, but Seed Bomb can be used instead in order to hit Ground-type Pokemon for super effective damage without losing coverage against Rock-types.</p> <p>Both of Arbok's abilities are good, and the one you use should depend upon the role you'd like Arbok to play. Intimidate is the preferred ability if you want Arbok to succeed against offensive teams, as it allows Arbok to come in against most Fighting-type Pokemon, including as Primeape, Gurdurr, and Sawk that are locked into Close Combat, and use them as to set up. Shed Skin, however, can be used to let Arbok function more as a stallbreaker, letting it set up multiple times against a variety of bulkier Pokemon thanks to how well it can shrug off a burn or paralysis. Aside from the moves listed above, Rest can be used in conjunction with Shed Skin, allowing Arbok to heal up and hopefully wake up early. However, it would force Arbok to choose between coverage and priority, meaning it would have a harder time against either defensive or offensive teams. Aqua Tail is a usable move in the fourth slot to hit Ground-types while still retaining coverage on Steel-types, but it doesn't hit Steel-types hard enough and would lose out on coverage against Seismitoad.</p> <p>While this set is fairly powerful, it struggles against bulky Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon. Liepard makes for an exceptional teammate, as it is able to Pursuit trap these Pokemon and can even Encore setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Musharna that would normally set up against Arbok. Arbok returns the favor by defeating the Fighting-types that plague Liepard. If Seed Bomb is used, Steel-type Pokemon such as Metang, Klang, and Bastiodon will be problematic—Klang can even set up alongside it. Therefore, Pokemon that can get rid of them, such as Golurk and Seismitoad, make for good partners. However, if Earthquake is chosen, Ground-types such as Piloswine and Golurk become an issue, making bulky Water-types, such as Ludicolo and Seismitoad, good partners to defeat them.</p>"

  "Farfetch’d": {
    "overview": "<p>Farfetch'd has terrible stats, a shallow movepool, and is completely outclassed by every other Normal / Flying type in the tier. Do not even bother trying Farfetch'd out, as it will disappoint you every time.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Baton Pass is a decent move to allow Farfetch'd to escape to a teammate, possibly with a Swords Dance boost, but it cannot be used with Leaf Blade, Quick Attack, or Defiant. Stick is an item to be considered so that Farfetch'd can possibly dish out multiple critical hits, but it is reliant on luck and lacks power without a critical hit. Revenge is an interesting option to hit Steel-types, but the negative priority means that Farfetch'd is likely to be KOed before it even gets to move. Agility patches up Farfetch'd's poor Speed, but without a boost from Swords Dance, it is extremely weak and it is too frail to be setting up both Swords Dance and Agility in the same match, making this move largely useless. Toxic is a decent option that allows Farfetch'd to cripple bulkier opponents, but Farfetch'd isn't going to last long enough to stall opponents out. Finally, a much easier and more effective alternative is to use another Normal / Flying type, such as Swellow or Braviary; at least they can get off one or two KOs per game.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Steel-types are resistant to every move Farfetch'd normally uses and easily KO it. Klang in particular can set up Shift Gear while Farfetch'd Swords Dances and OHKO with Gear Grind. Regirock shrugs off everything in Farfetch'd's arsenal and easily OHKOes with Stone Edge. Rotom-S is bulky enough to shrug off unboosted hits, doesn't take too much damage from a +2 Quick Attack, outspeeds, and OHKOes. Because Farfetch'd is so weak, anything reasonably bulky can easily take hits from it and KO it back. Similarly, due to Farfetch'd's poor bulk and Speed, anything that is faster than it that doesn't take too much damage from Quick Attack can easily defeat it by coming in on Swords Dance. In other words, Farfetch'd is countered by the majority of the metagame.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance \"Sweeper\"": {
        "description": "<p>This is the best set Farfetch'd can run, which admittedly isn't that impressive. Swords Dance patches up Farfetch'd's Attack stat, but yet might find a bit of trouble setting up due to its frailty. Brave Bird is Farfetch'd's main STAB move, and, unlike Return, can OHKO Ludicolo on the switch even when unboosted. Leaf Blade allows Farfetch'd to get past Rock-types, thus giving it a niche over other Normal- and Flying-types; it is extremely weak without a boost, though. For example, even with Stealth Rock support, an unboosted Leaf Blade cannot OHKO Carracosta and Golem. Finally, Quick Attack allows Farfetch'd to pick off weakened opponents and gets around its low Speed. However, Quick Attack is otherwise extremely weak and will fail to do anything of note against bulkier opponents.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is used because Farfetch'd needs all the power it can get. A Jolly nature allows Farfetch'd to outspeed Modest Ludicolo and Samurott, but Farfetch'd is extremely pathetic offensively without an Adamant nature. U-turn is an interesting move option, allowing Farfetch'd to flee from opponents and gain momentum for the team. Farfetch'd absolutely needs entry hazard support because its pathetic offenses mean it falls short on several KOs without it. For instance, Farfetch'd cannot OHKO Golem 100% of the time unless Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes is on the opponent's side of the field. Probopass is a decent teammate as it provides Stealth Rock support, provides a slow Volt Switch to bring in Farfetch'd safely, and traps and defeats Steel-type opponents for it. Roselia covers up on Farfetch'd's weakness to Electric-type moves and sets up Spikes to aid it. Rapid Spin support from Wartortle and Torkoal is beneficial to allow Farfetch'd to switch in more times and thus possibly survive weaker hits. Mold Breaker Sawk blasts through Steel-types and defeats opposing Stealth Rock leads that possess the Sturdy ability. Due to Farfetch'd's pitiful bulk, it appreciates support to allow itself to set up more easily. Dual screens and Encore support are useful to help it out. Ampharos is a good teammate, taking Electric-type attacks aimed at Farfetch'd, setting up dual screens, and utilizing a slow Volt Switch to bring it in safely.</p>"

  "Dodrio": {
    "overview": "<p>Dodrio's combination of great Attack and Speed, which allows it to outspeed and take out unboosted base 95 Speed Pokemon such as Haunter, makes it surprisingly effective in this metagame. It can even trap Haunter thanks to Pursuit, giving it some extra utility on a team. Its greatest drawback is the fact that it is helpless against Rock- and Steel-types, which are common Stealth Rock setters in the metagame. Speaking of Stealth Rock, taking 25% damage when switching in makes Dodrio frailer than it already is, as it gets worn down quickly alongside Brave Bird's recoil. Still, it provides a balance between power and Speed, which gives it a niche in comparison to Braviary.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thrash is also a viable STAB move as it has much more power behind it than Return. One must understand that being locked into the move is a problem however, as there are a few types that can easily switch into Thrash and set up, and the confusion provides only a small benefit when combined with Tangled Feet. You rarely want to keep Dodrio in after Thrash ends, as the evasion boost doesn't prevent it from hitting itself in confusion, which can be fatal due to its high Attack. A stallbreaker set is a viable option, using Taunt and Roost to break through some walls. Unfortunately, such a set is at best mediocre at accomplishing this job, with its low bulk making even weak attacks a problem. Baton Pass allows Dodrio to escape battle while maintaining momentum, but it is illegal with Brave Bird. Work Up is an option to increase Dodrio's offensive power, but Dodrio is generally too frail to set up and would prefer to simply attack. Substitute can work alongside Agility and Liechi Berry, but priority is quite common in the metagame. Feint Attack and Payback are options over Pursuit, but they lack its utility. Drill Peck is a viable option over Brave Bird if you don't like recoil, but the loss in power is very drastic. Double-Edge is a viable option over Return and Thrash, but it is illegal alongside Brave Bird. Steel Wing is Dodrio's only option to hit Rock-types, but it is rather weak and fails to defeat them before they defeat Dodrio. Acupressure can provide a random boost to one of Dodrio's stats, but it is so unreliable that it isn't worth the moveslot. Haze, Endeavor, and Torment are interesting support moves, but Dodrio cannot make use of them with its frailty and lack of resistances.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon, such as Regirock and Metang, are almost always perfect counters to Dodrio, and they can even set up Stealth Rock to limit the number of times it can switch in. Physically defensive Mandibuzz can tank repeated Brave Birds and respond with Foul Play. Alomomola can take a Brave Bird and retaliate with Toxic or its Water STAB in response; meanwhile, it can stall with Protect and pivot out to a Flying-type resistance. Weezing can take a couple of Brave Birds and respond with Will-O-Wisp or Sludge Bomb. Almost everything faster than Dodrio can revenge kill it. Faster Electric-types are notable choices because they can easily use Volt Switch to either OHKO Dodrio or gain momentum if it switches out. Because Dodrio is so frail, priority can inflict a huge amount of damage on it. It is important to note that Quick Attack variants can get around Sucker Punch users.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "KACAW (Choice Band)": {
        "description": "<p>Brave Bird is Dodrio's strongest and most reliable STAB move, with the recoil being a small price to pay as Dodrio is already quite frail. Return is the safest choice for a secondary STAB move, having no drawback and decent power. Pursuit makes use of Dodrio's great power and Speed, striking any Haunter without a Choice Scarf before they can move and taking them out whether they switch out or not. Quick Attack provides useful STAB priority to pick off weakened sweepers, and it still has some decent power behind it. Toxic is another viable option for the last slot to catch physical walls such as Alomomola and Misdreavus on the switch in, but being locked into it can be inconvenient.</p> <p>Early Bird is the preferred ability as it makes Dodrio a better check against Grass-types and Butterfree. Stealth Rock is very useful for Dodrio, as it guarantees that Dodrio can OHKO Bulk Up Braviary and offensive Armaldo and 2HKO 172 HP Eelektross with Brave Bird. Golem and Seismitoad are some great options for setting Stealth Rock as their Ground typing allows them to check most Electric-types and also prevents your opponent from safely using Volt Switch. Spikes is also very beneficial because two layers alongside Stealth Rock allows Dodrio to 2HKO standard Alomomola with Brave Bird. Garbodor and Roselia are good teammates to set up Spikes, and both can set up Toxic Spikes as an added bonus. As Dodrio takes a lot of damage from Brave Bird recoil and Stealth Rock, having ways to keep Stealth Rock off the field is very beneficial. Sawk and Samurott are great offensive options to prevent most Stealth Rock users from setting up, and they also threaten the Rock- and Steel-types that Dodrio cannot easily damage. Cleric support from Musharna or Misdreavus is very useful because Dodrio is utterly crippled by paralysis and burns.</p>"

  "Electrode": {
    "overview": "<p>When looking at Electrode, its base 140 Speed stat instantly jumps out; this makes Electrode the second fastest Pokemon in NU, only outsped by Ninjask. Its Special Attack is just good enough to complement its excellent Speed, allowing it to be an efficient revenge killer. This role is further enhanced by Electrode's good STAB, which lets it revenge kill important threats such as Swellow and Samurott. Unfortunately, Electrode is very frail, thus being open to Choice Scarf users and even uninvested attacks. It also has a shallow movepool, which limits its revenge killing potential. Because Electrode's Special Attack is still pretty mediocre overall, it fails to do much to common defensive Pokemon such as Lickilicky and Regice. Furthermore, Electrode has a lot of competition from the similarly built Electabuzz and Zebstrika, as the former has more power, while the latter has a much better movepool, and both are still fast enough to be effective revenge killers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Rain Dance set is an option, although it's outclassed by Prankster users such as Volbeat. Do note that Thunder should always be used over Thunderbolt if Electrode is being used on a rain team though. Electrode has a few more useful moves that you might be interested in: Magnet Rise allows it to evade Ground-type attacks for a couple of turns, although Electrode has trouble finding room for it, as well as opportunities to set it up. Electro Ball can replace Thunderbolt, as it deals more damage to slow Pokemon such as Lickilicky, but Electrode is generally much more effective against fast, frail threats than against slow, bulky ones, rendering Thunderbolt as the superior option overall. Explosion can be used to go out with a bang, but coming off of Electrode's pathetic Attack stat, it won't be doing much to anything with moderate bulk. Electrode can opt to run a fast supportive set utilizing Thunder Wave or Toxic, Taunt, Thunderbolt, and Hidden Power Ice or Grass, but its terrible bulk is a big deterrent. Charge Beam can be used as Electrode's only way to set up, but it is weak and unreliable, making straight damage with Thunderbolt the superior option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Electrode's bad bulk makes it easy to defeat; just use any Pokemon with moderate special bulk that isn't weak to its STAB. Paralyzing it will render it completely useless; Lickilicky can use Body Slam and Regice can use Thunder Wave. Both can also take hits from Electrode day and night; the latter just has to watch out for Taunt. Ground-types are immune to Electrode's STAB, and Camerupt doesn't take much from Hidden Power Grass either; they can all OHKO back with their Ground-type STABs. Dragon-types are also good answers as most of them resist almost every move Electrode commonly runs; they can then set up on it and sweep the rest of its team. Beware though, as Hidden Power Ice variants can hit them for a lot of damage. Grass-types such as Roselia and Vileplume are not afraid of anything Electrode can do and can retaliate back with their STAB attacks. They must be careful of Taunt however, as a well timed Taunt can prevent them from healing off the damage caused by Electrode. Bulky Electric-types such as Ampharos and Eelektross can easily take hits from Electrode, the former can also cripple it with paralysis and the latter can 2HKO with Flamethrower or Return, depending on the set it's running. Once again, basically anything with moderate bulk and above average offensive presence can take it out.</p>",

Thunderbolt is Electrode's primary STAB, as it is very powerful and reliable and maims Flying- and Water-types. Volt Switch is yet another Electric STAB, but it trades a bit of power for the ability to gain momentum and get Electrode out of tough situations, such as when facing an opponent that can OHKO. Hidden Power Grass is a good coverage move to hit Ground-types super effectively, OHKOing Seismitoad and 2HKOing Golurk and offensive Piloswine after Stealth Rock. Signal Beam hits Grass-, Psychic-, and Dark-types for super effective damage, allowing Electrode to revenge kill Exeggutor and Shiftry, among others, with ease. Taunt, however, is a viable alternative, as it stops the likes of specially defensive Ludicolo from setting up on Electrode and also prevents support Pokemon such as Lickilicky and Audino from Wish stalling it; Taunt is also one of the few things Electrode has over other Electric-types such as Electabuzz and Zebstrika. Beware though, as ditching Signal Beam will leave Electrode walled by the commonly seen Grass-types.</p> <p>The EV spread allows Electrode to outrun Jolly Swellow and Adamant Choice Scarf Braviary. A Modest nature can be used, but Electrode will then fail outspeed positive natured Swellow. Choice Specs can be used to provide a greater damage output, but this doesn't gain Electrode any specific KOs, and it would much rather have the freedom to switch moves, especially considering that its main STAB does nothing to common Ground-type Pokemon. Expert Belt can be used to bluff a Choice set and catch Ground-types off guard, but Electrode desperately needs the power Life Orb provides for its attacks at all times. Both of Electrode's abilities trigger when it is hit by a contact move.Aftermath is generally more useful as the residual damage it supplies can be just what is needed to deal with a key threat. However, Static can still come in handy as it paralyzes opponents, thus supporting the team. Hidden Power Ice can be used over Hidden Power Grass to hit Roselia and Dragon-types, but the threats that Hidden Power Grass hits are much more significant. Foul Play OHKOes Golurk and 2HKOes most Eelektross after Stealth Rock, but unlike Electrode's other attacks, it is quite situational.</p> <p>Electrode appreciates entry hazard support as this nets it some extra KOs, such as a 2HKO on Golurk; Roselia is a good choice as it appreciates Electrode's ability to remove Flying-types from play. Misdreavus is also a good teammate, as it is immune to Ground-type attacks and can Heal Bell away the paralysis that would otherwise render Electrode useless. Rotom-S and Electrode form a great core, as Electrode lures in Ground-types for Rotom-S to switch into and defeat with Hidden Power Grass. The two can then spam Volt Switch with little to no worries. Fighting-types such as Sawk and Primeape are excellent teammates, as they can take out Audino, Lickilicky, and Regice, Pokemon that give Electrode a lot of trouble.</p>"

  "Exeggutor": {
    "overview": "<p>With two great abilities in Chlorophyll and Harvest, a bountiful movepool, and a good stat spread, Exeggutor has established itself as a very capable offensive and defensive powerhouse. Due to these traits, Exeggutor is one of the most unpredictable and powerful Grass-types in NU. However, Exeggutor's sluggish Speed stat holds it back, as even with Chlorophyll doubling Exeggutor's Speed in the sun, it simply isn't fast enough to outpace some of the key Choice Scarf users: primarily Primeape and Charizard. Moreover, Exeggutor's low Special Defense and weakness to Bug-, Ice-, Dark-, and Flying-type moves make it an open target for many of NU's powerful attackers. Braviary, Charizard, and Skuntank all give Exeggutor varying degrees of trouble due to its shortcomings.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ice can be used on the Choice Specs set, as Exeggutor can hit Mandibuzz and Zweilous for a 2HKO after Stealth Rock. However, that is the extent to which Hidden Power Ice is useful, as other bulky Flying-types such as Braviary and Altaria are already hit hard with Psychic. A Swords Dance set or a mixed set can also work, but Exeggutor can sweep more easily with its special attacks rather than its physical attacks. However, Wood Hammer can be used in conjunction with a specially defensive spread so that Exeggutor can lure out Jynx and smash her to pieces. A dual screen set can also work given as Exeggutor has access to Sleep Powder and Explosion, but Exeggutor's low Speed tends to get in the way of such an option. Exeggutor can run a Choice Scarf set, which can catch many potential revenge killers or faster threats off guard despite being very gimmicky. Trick Room is another alternative, which can exploit teams that run fast and frail sweepers to deal with Exeggutor. Exeggutor also has the ability to slow down its opponents with Stun Spore, which can give a slow wallbreaker such as Eelektross plenty of opportunities to obliterate the opposing team; unfortunately, Exeggutor has difficulty finding room for it. Wish can be used for team support, but Exeggutor's HP stat simply isn't high enough to make the best use of this move. Pinch Berries such as Salac and Petaya can be used alongside Harvest, as can type-resist Berries such as Occa, but Lum and Sitrus remain Exeggutor's best options with Harvest due to status blocking and recovery, respectively. Lastly, Power Swap + Leaf Storm is another fun option; once Exeggutor uses Leaf Storm, it can pass the -2 Special Attack drops to its opponent. This not only allows Exeggutor to whip out another full power Leaf Storm but, by weakening the opponent, potentially enables it to survive a super effective special attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Any Pokemon with high-octane offenses, versatility, and access to a sleep-inducing move is essentially without counters. When dealing with Exeggutor, it is imperative that one flushes out Sleep Powder so Exeggutor loses its main way of dealing with Pokemon it has trouble with. Once Sleep Powder is out of the way, Mandibuzz can switch in safely, take nearly anything from Exeggutor, and easily Roost off the damage. However, Mandibuzz takes a lot of damage from Choice Specs boosted Hidden Power Ice, so a little caution must be taken. Specially defensive Zweilous is the next best counter because it can easily sponge Exeggutor's attacks; however, it will be stalled out by with a combination of Substitute and Leech Seed and might be 2HKOed by an uncommon yet existent Choice Specs Hidden Power Ice after Stealth Rock. Zweilous can also use Sleep Talk to take a Sleep Powder from Exeggutor, as RestTalk Zweilous is useful outside of this to tank hits and status.</p> <p>While Skuntank is easily 2HKOed by a Choice Specs Leaf Storm, it is the second most reliable response to Exeggutor, as it can easily retaliate with a powerful Crunch or Pursuit trap a fleeing Exeggutor. Additionally, Lum Berry variants will be able to switch in once on a Sleep Powder and revenge kill accordingly. Regice and Articuno are also great responses thanks to their fantastic defenses, though both of them are quite easy to wear down because of their crippling Stealth Rock weaknesses. With Stealth Rock up, Regice can still be 2HKOed by Leaf Storm and Articuno can be OHKOed by Psychic. Altaria and Lickilicky can also check Exeggutor, though they risk being outstalled with Leech Seed or torn apart by a powerful Psychic. Metang can also take on Exeggutor, though a Choice Specs Leaf Storm still does a sizable amount of damage. Sap Sipper Pokemon don't care about Exeggutor's Leaf Storm; because of its overall great defenses and access to reliable recovery, Miltank specifically is a decent response to Exeggutor, though just like Regice and Articuno, it can be 2HKOed by Choice Specs Psychic after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Fortunately, checking Exeggutor isn't as difficult. Choice Scarf Jynx in particular makes an excellent check as she can outspeed even Sunny Day variants and OHKO with Ice Beam. Charizard can easily switch into Exeggutor's Grass-type moves and OHKO with its powerful Fire-type STABs. Scolipede and Haunter have difficulty switching in, but they can also take Exeggutor down with a Megahorn or Sludge Bomb, respectively. Finally, a Sucker Punch from Kangaskhan, Cacturne, or Shiftry can take out Exeggutor, which is helpful especially if it's a Chlorophyll set. In general, faster Pokemon with strong special attacks are decent checks. Samurott, Shiftry, and Ludicolo all check Exeggutor rather well; Shiftry can switch into a Giga Drain or Psychic and retaliate with Dark Pulse, and Ludicolo and Samurott can use Ice Beam to pick off Exeggutor, and even physical Samurott works rather well against Exeggutor because it has access to Megahorn.</p>",

      "LumRest": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of all of Exeggutor's best qualities: Harvest, good bulk, and exceptional power. Lum Berry coupled with Harvest essentially makes Exeggutor impervious to status afflictions, as the combination allows Exeggutor to fully heal itself in one turn with Rest. Exeggutor's recovery and stats make it a good counter to many walls such as Alomomola, Tangela, and Seismitoad. Sleep Powder makes Exeggutor even more annoying to deal with by enabling it to cripple incoming Pokemon that can actually deal with its stalling ordeals, such as Mandibuzz. Giga Drain is the preferred STAB move because of its respectable power and ability to regain copious amounts of HP from the likes of Alomomola. Lastly, Psychic is a great secondary STAB option and hits many Grass-type resists.</p> <p>The EV spread listed above allows Exeggutor to survive Choice Band Sawk's Ice Punch, Life Orb Samurott's Ice Beam, Choice Scarf Primeape's U-turn, and also allows Exeggutor to outspeed the likes of Alomomola, effectively countering it. While Alomomola has no business staying in on Exeggutor, this prevents things such as last minute Wish passing as Exeggutor can Giga Drain before Alomomola gets a chance to do anything.</p> <p>Exeggutor works well with Pokemon that struggle to beat cores consisting of Alomomola or Seismitoad paired with Tangela or Roselia. For example, Carracosta, Golurk, Kangaskhan, and Samurott are all rather threatening sweepers that appreciate Exeggutor's ability to take down all variants of this core and can provide teams with an imminent sweeping force once the core is eliminated. Probopass is also an excellent choice to partner with Exeggutor because it can set up Stealth Rock and trap opposing Metang with Magnet Pull. Overall, Exeggutor's ability to apply offensive pressure to teams with bulky Water-types make it a great partner alongside any sweeper in need of some extra wallbreaking support.</p>"

Psychic gives Exeggutor a consistent, hard-hitting move that also heavily damages many Pokemon that can switch into Grass-type attacks, such as Roselia, Scolipede, Charizard, and Sap Sipper Sawsbuck and Miltank. Hidden Power Ground is used to target bulky Pokemon that resist both of Exeggutor's STAB moves, such as Metang. As for the last slot, Sleep Powder might seem odd on a Choice Specs set, but it gives Exeggutor more of an offensive presence as it guarantees that there will be no safe switch-ins to Exeggutor. When using Choice Specs Exeggutor, one must be wary that the Special Attack drop from Leaf Storm makes it setup fodder for many common threats such as Charizard and Scolipede; therefore, Giga Drain can also be considered as a reliable backup STAB move to Leaf Storm that can keep Exeggutor healthy over the course of a battle.</p> <p>The Speed EVs allow Exeggutor to outspeed max Speed Golem and either put it to sleep or OHKO it. However, max Speed with a Timid nature is also viable if one wishes to outspeed uninvested Misdreavus and other various Pokemon that try to Speed creep slower versions of Exeggutor. However, a Modest nature is generally preferred so Exeggutor can hit as hard as possible and break holes in an opponent's team.</p> <p>Choice Specs Exeggutor forces switches extremely well, so Stealth Rock support is highly recommended, especially as many common switch-ins to Leaf Storm—most notably Charizard, Braviary, and Scolipede—are weak to Stealth Rock. Regirock and Carracosta work well alongside Exeggutor as it resists Ground-, Water-, Grass-, and Fighting-type moves and they can provide Exeggutor with the entry hazards it needs to truly put pressure on the opponent. Probopass has access to Stealth Rock as well and also provides trapping capabilities and a slow Volt Switch to bring Exeggutor in safely. Offensive Seismitoad also pairs well with Exeggutor as the two cover each other's weaknesses quite well while maintaining offensive synergy. Choice Scarf Fighting-types such as Sawk and Primeape make good partners as well because they can sweep through teams easily after Exeggutor is done weakening the opponent's team with repeated hits. For the same reasons, faster threats such as Swellow benefit from Exeggutor's ability to weaken opposing threats, as they often lack the power needed to completely sweep an opponent's team.</p>"

      "SubSeed": {
        "description": "<p>SubSeed is Exeggutor's most annoying set and has the potential to stall out an opponent's team thanks to Harvest. Harvest makes this set possible, as it gives Exeggutor back its Sitrus Berry 50% of the time, allowing it to continually stall out its opponent. Substitute and Leech Seed help keep Exeggutor afloat while whittling down the opponent's health, and Psychic is Exeggutor's best STAB to deal with Grass-types immune to Leech Seed such as Sawsbuck and Roselia. Protect can be used to further stall for Leech Seed recovery and even scout for moves, while Sleep Powder gives Exeggutor a free turn to set up and incapacitates one of the few Pokemon that can deal with this set, Mandibuzz. If given the opportunity, Exeggutor has the potential to outstall Pokemon that would normally beat it, such as Jynx, Charizard, Scolipede, and Skuntank.</p> <p>The physically defensive spread is best used to capitalize on Exeggutor's great bulk and resistances, and the 84 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed uninvested base 65 Speed Pokemon such as Roselia and Alomomola. By investing in Defense, Exeggutor can take hits from Pokemon such as Sawk and Primeape especially well and begin to set up accordingly.</p> <p>Paralysis and Toxic Spikes support are very helpful when using SubSeed Exeggutor. Paralysis allows for Exeggutor to get a Leech Seed in easily, while Toxic Spikes support helps stack the damage accumulated by Leech Seed stalling. Scolipede and Garbodor are the best partners to help set Toxic Spikes up, and both also provide Toxic Spikes absorption to keep Exeggutor healthy. Liepard and Rotom-S are good choices to provide paralysis support and have decent synergy alongside Exeggutor. There are also defensive partners to Exeggutor such as Alomomola and Metang, which appreciate Exeggutor's ability to take on Electric- and Ground-type attacks respectively. Alomomola in particular can help take on Scolipede, which is a common response and threat to many teams packing Exeggutor. Lastly, Heal Bell support in the form of Audino or Lickilicky can help as a random Scald burn can greatly hinder Exeggutor's ability to stall effectively.</p>"

      "Sun Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>While Exeggutor has rather abysmal Speed, the combination of Sunny Day and Chlorophyll helps alleviate this problem and makes it a threatening sweeper in the sun. Sunny Day not only doubles Exeggutor's Speed, but also supports Fire-type Pokemon and attacks, thus making Exeggutor a team supporter as well as an established sweeper. Solar Beam is Exeggutor's main attack as it can be used constantly with no drawbacks in the sun, and Psychic nails Pokemon such as Braviary, Charizard, and Scolipede. Sleep Powder is generally preferred so Exeggutor can dodge Sucker Punch from Skuntank, Shiftry, and Kangaskhan, but Hidden Power Fire also has its uses in dealing with Steel-types such as Metang, as well as hitting Grass-types a bit harder when Sunny Day is up.</p> <p>A Modest nature is preferred to maximize Exeggutor's offenses, although it fails to ensure Exeggutor outspeeds Choice Scarf Braviary, Sawk, and Rotom-A to name a few. Thus, a Timid nature can be used to outspeed these threats, but most dedicated sun teams carry a faster sun sweeper anyway. On sun teams, Heat Rock is an option over Life Orb for teams that need Exeggutor to be more of a supporter than a sweeper. Giga Drain can also be used over Solar Beam as a more reliable Grass-type STAB when sun is not up. Nature Power can be used to deal with Metang and Skuntank, and also has the added benefit of causing Sucker Punch to fail. Substitute is another option to consider in order to make Exeggutor harder to revenge kill and protect it from priority.</p> <p>Stealth Rock support is rather important in snagging useful KOs on Pokemon such as Rotom-S with Psychic; Golem, Carracosta, Metang, and Probopass are all great users of Stealth Rock that also have good synergy with Exeggutor. Exeggutor can act as a stand-alone sweeper or can be a part of a dedicated sun team; if it is on a sun team, then Volbeat, Regirock, and Liepard are all great options to set up Sunny Day. Regirock in particular can both set up Stealth Rock and Sunny Day and lures in Pokemon that Exeggutor can switch into, such as Golem and Sawk. Other useful sun teammates include Charizard, which can get past Skuntank and Metang, and Shiftry, which can take out bulkier Psychic-types such as Gardevoir and Musharna more easily.</p>"

  "Noctowl": {
    "overview": "<p>Noctowl is a decent specially defensive Pokemon, but there isn't much of a reason to choose it over Mandibuzz. It has poor physical bulk—leaving it prone to getting forced out by many physical attackers—a poor defensive typing, and unlike Mandibuzz, a movepool that lacks useful tools such as Taunt and Foul Play. Noctowl's only niche is Insomnia, which, together with its great special bulk, allows it to wall most Grass-types with ease, but more often than not, this isn't enough to justify using it over Mandibuzz.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Despite being an awful Pokemon, Noctowl has access to some interesting support options such as Psych Up, Feather Dance, Psycho Shift, Hypnosis, and Thunder Wave. However, these are only useful in certain situations, and Noctowl can't really afford to ditch one of its standard moves for any of them. Noctowl can also go offensive with its Tinted Lens ability, Heat Wave, Hyper Voice, and Air Slash, but it isn't strong enough to break walls by itself and would need way too much support to work.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Rock-types such as Golem, Regirock, and Carracosta can all easily take a Night Shade and OHKO Noctowl with their STABs. Physical attackers in general are a pain for Noctowl as it has horrible physical bulk, which leaves it 2HKOed by pretty much any decently strong move. Electric-types such as Rotom-S, Eelektross, and Electabuzz can also easily KO Noctowl, only fearing Toxic. Ice-types such as Piloswine and Regice easily beat Noctowl too with their Ice-type STABs. Swellow, Zangoose, and Ursaring are immune to Noctowl's Night Shade, can use Toxic to their advantage to boost their power with Guts or Toxic Boost, and can easily OHKO Noctowl with Facade. Steel-types such as Metang, which is only 4HKOed by Night Shade and can retaliate back with either Meteor Mash or Toxic, can also easily take on Noctowl. Finally, Noctowl is easy to wear down with status as it puts Noctowl on a timer, limiting its survivability.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>This is the best set that Noctowl can pull off in NU. Roost is necessary for Noctowl to stick around as it will get worn down quite quickly by Stealth Rock. Whirlwind is important as well, as Noctowl would be setup fodder for multiple Pokemon without it. It also allows Noctowl to wear down the opponent's team when paired with entry hazards. Due to Noctowl's low Special Attack, Night Shade is generally the best way for Noctowl to deal damage as it only leaves Noctowl walled by Normal-types. Air Slash can also be useful as it gives Noctowl a way to hit Normal-types and lets it beat Grass-types more easily. However, keep in mind that Noctowl will then be walled by Steel-types. Finally, Toxic is there to let Noctowl cripple and wear down the opponent's Pokemon.</p> <p>Magic Coat can be used to prevent Noctowl from getting hit by Taunt or to prevent entry hazard setup, but Noctowl has problems fitting it in as it needs all four of its moves. Reflect is also an interesting option for Noctowl, as it would help it take on physical attacker better, but like Magic Coat, it is hard for Noctowl to find spaces for it.</p> <p>Because Noctowl's best way to beat a Pokemon is by wearing it down, Garbodor and physically defensive Roselia are great partners for it as they provides Spikes and Toxic Spikes to wear down the opponent's team even more and can take on physical attackers such as Sawk and Gurdurr for Noctowl thanks to their typing. Piloswine also pairs well with Noctowl, providing Stealth Rock, an immunity to Electric-type attacks, and a resistance to Ice-type attacks thanks to Thick Fat. Finally, Steel-types such as Metang and Klang are good partners for Noctowl as they can deal with the opponent's Rock-type Pokemon.</p>"

Ariados is horribly outclassed by Roselia and Garbodor which all have greater bulk, access to both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, and even greater offensive stats and movepools. It has Insomnia and Sucker Punch, which are things the other three don't, but unless those two tiny niches are absolutely vital to your team, Ariados's terrible stats and mediocre Attack just don't cut it in NU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ariados has few other viable options. Spider Web is a highly interesting move, but Ariados struggles to make use of it with its bad stats. It gets the always-irritating Swagger and Foul Play. Night Shade is intriguing for damaging Steel- and Poison-types but has little use beyond that. Agility can be used for a Baton Pass or an offensive set, but Ariados is outclassed severely in both jobs.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Most Poison-types, include Garbodor and Roselia, can absorb the Toxic Spikes and completely wall Ariados. The two of them can then proceed to set up Spikes for free as Ariados cannot touch them. In terms of rival entry hazard setters, Golem and Gigalith can use Rock Blast to OHKO Ariados through its Focus Sash. Golem can also outspeed Ariados with proper Speed investment so that it never gets a chance to set up. Kangaskhan can use Fake Out to break Ariados's Focus Sash, then KO with its powerful Normal-type STAB. Ariados is heavily reliant on its Focus Sash and is frail nonetheless, so two powerful hits from just about anything that is not resisted should do the job.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Toxic Spikes": {
        "description": "<p>Ariados's access to Toxic Spikes and priority attacks give it a small but usable niche as a lead. Toxic Spikes is what makes the set usable. Against teams without a Toxic Spikes absorber, the hazard can easily help win games. X-Scissor is Ariados's strongest attack, and Sucker Punch provides strong priority. Finally, Baton Pass is used to try to gain momentum against the opposition. However, Poison Jab can be used in the last slot in order to deal decent damage to opposing Fighting-types. In particular, Ariados can switch into Sawk and Primeape and proceed to 2HKO them when using Poison Jab.</p> <p>The EV spread is used to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Sawk's Close Combat after switching into Stealth Rock. 132 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature are used to outspeed Adamant max Speed Carracosta, though an Adamant nature can be used instead to outspeed up to base 55 Speed Pokemon with no investment. In terms of team support, Alomomola makes a decent partner as its HP is gigantic and it walls the problematic Kangaskhan. A Ghost-type such as Misdreavus should be used as well in order to block Rapid Spin and ensure the Toxic Spikes that Ariados sets stay on the opponent's side of the field throughout the battle. Mold Breaker Sawk can be used to OHKO common Stealth Rock leads, such as Golem, Piloswine, and Gigalith. As grounded Poison-types absorb Toxic Spikes upon their switch, offensive Ground- or Psychic-types are recommended as partners. Golurk in particular can spinblock and use its STAB Earthquake to damage the opposition.</p>"

  "Magcargo": {
    "overview": "<p>Magcargo is a Pokemon which has many crippling flaws that prevent it from shining in the limelight of the NU metagame. Due to its horrible typing, Magcargo not only has a Stealth Rock weakness, but it also sports 4x weaknesses to common Water and Ground-type moves, as well as a weakness to Fighting-type moves. To make matters worse, Magcargo has incredibly underwhelming Special Defense and HP, meaning that many powerful special attacks, such as Jynx's Focus Blast, will take it out after Stealth Rock. Despite these problems, Magcargo still makes a decent check to several important Pokemon in the NU metagame, including Swellow, Drifblim, and Charizard, thanks to its key resistances to Normal-, Flying-, and Fire-type attacks. Magcargo also has a unique support movepool, including options such as Memento, Will-O-Wisp, and Stealth Rock, as well as a reliable recovery move. However, these traits do not make Magcargo a good Pokemon and more often than not, other defensive Fire- and Rock-types, such as Torkoal and Regirock, will be better options for your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Magcargo can run an offensive Shell Smash set with Fire Blast, Earth Power, and Hidden Power Grass, but it is very difficult for Magcargo to set up due to its common weaknesses. If you do decide to run a Shell Smash set, then Memento is a fine option over Earth Power, as it allows easier setup for Pokemon like Zangoose. A dual screens set is also viable, but it suffers from the same problem as the Shell Smash set. Clear Smog can be used to eliminate stat boosts, but its low Base Power is a turnoff and Magcargo has a hard time fitting it into one of its moveslots. Overheat and Fire Blast can be used for their power, but Lava Plume is usually the better choice thanks to its higher PP and higher chance to burn. Finally, a Sunny Day set with Heat Rock can be used, but Magcargo merely compounds the weaknesses that sun teams already have.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Magcargo is not very hard to counter thanks to its low Special Attack and common weaknesses. Camerupt is Magcargo's best counter, as it can switch into anything Magcargo throws at it, barring Toxic, and annihilate it with Earthquake. Seismitoad is another good counter, as it can switch into most of Magcargo's moves and destroy it with either of its STAB attacks. Defensive variants fear status from Magcargo, however. Probopass and Torkoal only fear the rare Earth Power, and both of them can retaliate with their own Earth Power. Golurk and Carracosta can both outspeed and OHKO Magcargo with their STAB attacks. In general, any Pokemon faster than Magcargo with a super effective attack can be considered a check to it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>This set uses Magcargo's unique defensive typing to check various threats in the NU metagame, particularly Fire- and Normal-types such as Charizard and Swellow respectively. Because of this, Magcargo can find multiple opportunities to reliably set up Stealth Rock. In the second slot, Recover is to heal Magcargo from any damage it has taken. It should be noted that Magcargo's Stealth Rock weakness forces it to Recover against foes that it walls, slowing down the team's momentum. Lava Plume is a great STAB option thanks to its nifty 30% burn chance, which can cripple many common switch-ins, such as Golurk. However, despite its decent Base Power, most foes will take very little damage from it due to Magcargo's sub-par Special Attack. This forces Magcargo to use Toxic as its primary form of damage.</p> <p>The given EV spread allows Magcargo to tank weaker special attacks, such as Zebstrika's Thunderbolt, while still allowing it to survive relatively powerful physical attacks, such as Swellow's Facade. Hidden Power Rock or Hidden Power Grass can be used for STAB or to hit Water- and Rock-types, respectively. However, these moves have little utility outside of hitting specific targets. Will-O-Wisp can be used over Toxic to cripple physical attackers, but Lava Plume already has a decent chance to burn. Good partners for Magcargo include those who resist its weaknesses. Seismitoad is a good partner because it absorbs Magcargo's Water-type weakness and resists its Rock-type weaknesses. It can also use Stealth Rock and open up a moveslot for Magcargo. Misdreavus is another solid partner, as it's immune to both Fighting- and Ground-type moves and can heal Magcargo from status with Heal Bell.</p>"

  "Corsola": {
    "overview": "<p>With a good Water / Rock defensive typing, an awesome ability in Regenerator, and a wide movepool, Corsola might seem like a good Pokemon. However, due to its extremely lackluster stats across the board, Corsola is in fact terrible. The only place where Corsola can find even a small niche is in stall, as its access to Stealth Rock, reliable recovery, and many other good options can make it a useful Pokemon to have. One of the biggest niches it has on stall is being able to put a full stop to Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary with the combination of Power Gem and Toxic. However, even on stall teams it faces heavy competition from staple physical walls that can provide more support to their teams than Corsola, including a way of stopping Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary. Recover and Regenerator are the main factors that make Corsola worth using over its competition, with none of the other Pokemon that are capable of stopping Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary having reliable recovery. Corsola also beats many of the tier's staple Pokemon, including Normal- and Flying-types such as Kangaskhan and Swellow. However, it has many exploitable weaknesses that Pokemon such as Roselia can take advantage of.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With a wide movepool, Corsola has many moves to choose from, though the large majority of them are extremely lackluster. It can go offensive with Choice Specs and multiple special moves with decent power, or Choice Band with Head Smash, which deals a lot of damage to anything that doesn't resist it, even with Corsola's pitiful Attack stat. Rock Polish is another offensive option, but even at +2 Corsola is incredibly slow and has next to no offensive presence, so it won't be dealing much damage to anything without a boost to its offenses. Corsola can choose to set up with Curse, but it will take a while before it can deal any notable damage due to Corsola's low Attack.</p> <p>Magic Coat is an interesting option which can deflect back any status moves used by the opponent. With some good prediction, Corsola can prevent Stealth Rock going up on your side of the field, and put them up on your opponent's side at the same time. It's also useful in preventing poisons and burns, which would otherwise wear Corsola down quickly. Mirror Coat can be used to retaliate against special attackers by hitting them back twice as hard, which can be useful for a surprise KO on an unsuspecting Pokemon. Corsola could run a decent SubToxic set utilizing Recover. Substitute is useful for scouting on a switch, and after getting a Toxic off, Corsola regains all the health it lost from Substitute when it switches out thanks to Regenerator.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Any Grass-type carrying a STAB move will make easy work of Corsola, and Fighting-types are in the same position. They can easily outspeed and OHKO with almost any STAB move, and Corsola can't do anything back except Toxic, as Power Gem hardly does any damage at all (especially to the Fighting-types). Roselia is the perfect counter to Corsola; it can take any hit, isn't affected by Toxic, can OHKO with Giga Drain, and uses the free turns to set up Spikes. Ludicolo is in a similar vein, as it doesn't care about any of Corsola's moves except Toxic, and can set up Rain Dance in preparation for a sweep. Gurdurr is the Fighting-type most suited to taking Corsola on, as it doesn't care about any status from Toxic or Scald thanks to Guts, while Sawk and Primeape have to watch out for the burn from Scald as they switch in. Almost every Ground-type can outspeed and OHKO Corsola, though most can't switch in, as they are in danger of taking a decent amount of damage from Scald. Seismitoad is one of the exceptions to this, as it takes hardly any damage from Power Gem, is immune to Scald thanks to Water Absorb, and can deal massive damage with Earth Power or Earthquake. It does have to watch out for Toxic, however. Steel-types, Poison-types, and other Pokemon that don't care about Toxic will do well against Corsola by default, as Toxic is Corsola's primary way of damaging anything. There are exceptions however, as some Pokemon that don't care about Toxic, such as Swellow, have a poor matchup against Corsola.</p>",

      "World's Cutest Wall": {
        "description": "<p>Corsola can take quite a few physical hits without trouble, partly thanks to its good defensive typing and access to reliable recovery in Recover. This set doesn't just beat Braviary, but also checks a lot of other Normal- and Flying-types such as Swellow, Kangaskhan, and Tauros. Regenerator is also extremely useful, as it enables Corsola to stay alive for much longer and act as a decent pivot. Power Gem is the attacking move of choice as it prevents Braviary from setting up Substitutes against Corsola, breaking them 100% of the time with four Special Attack EVs. Toxic is an essential move for Corsola, as it is the main way of wearing down most Pokemon due to Corsola's lack of offensive presence and its low Base Power moves. Toxic is also vital in defeating Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary, as, alongside Power Gem breaking its Substitutes, Braviary will eventually go down. Stealth Rock is Corsola's move of choice if your team doesn't have a Pokemon with the move, but otherwise Scald is the best choice, as it provides some useful coverage to get decent damage off and a chance to burn on anything it hits.</p> <p>Good Pokemon to pair alongside Corsola include those that beat the numerous Fighting-, Ground-, and Grass-type Pokemon that reside in NU. Solid candidates for this role include Pokemon such as Musharna, Ludicolo, and Roselia. Musharna provides Heal Bell support, which can heal Corsola of annoying status conditions that reduce its longevity. Roselia can take on special attackers that trouble Corsola while setting up Spikes, which are useful for the stall teams that Corsola often finds its home on. Ludicolo does well against Ground-types, specially attacking Water-types, and Eelektross, all of which give Corsola trouble, while Corsola handles the Flying-types that beat Ludicolo.</p> <p>Either Rock Blast or Rock Slide can be used over Power Gem, as Rock Blast breaks through Substitutes and Rock Slide is more powerful. Power Gem is the preferred option though, as the other two moves aren't guaranteed to break Braviary's Substitutes due to the fact that it uses Bulk Up to boost its Defense, and Braviary has no way to boost its Special Defense. A more specially bulky spread can be run instead, but the main purpose of Corsola in the first place is to beat Normal- and Flying-type Pokemon, and a physically defensive spread is far better at accomplishing that.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With Mantine finally getting access to a useful Flying-type STAB move that isn't Hidden Power Flying, it has established a very solid niche for itself in the NU metagame. STAB-boosted Air Slash allows it to break through Grass-types such as Roselia and effectively dispatch Ludicolo, achievements not many other rain sweepers can boast. This position as one of the best Ludicolo counters also makes it a solid option to combat opposing rain teams. Two useful abilities allow it to compete in both offensive and defensive roles, with Swift Swim giving it the speed to take out many threats while Water Absorb allows it to wall and defeat rain sweepers and other Water-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mantine gets a few other interesting moves, but struggles to fit them onto a moveset. Mirror Coat and Haze would probably both get a lot of use if Mantine had reliable recovery outside of Rest to use them with. Protect is also a great move for scouting Choice Volt Switch users, but it can be hard to fit onto a moveset. Even Tailwind could be useful for supporting teammates without Swift Swim that still want the Speed boost, but it is hard to pull off and situational. While Mantine's movepool is large, lots of it is unfortunately useless due to its terrible base 40 Attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Mantine actually does a decent job beating itself, as defensive sets can take on most Rain Dance sets with ease, while forcing a stalemate against themselves. Dedicated special walls such as Lickilicky and Audino also wall the offensive sets. Storm Drain Cradily can pull off a similar trick and threaten Mantine with STAB Rock-type moves. A great way to beat Mantine is to exploit its vulnerability to Electric-types; Rotom-S, Rotom-F, Electabuzz, Ampharos, and almost all other Electric-types do a great job in this regard. Samurott and Gorebyss carrying Hidden Power Electric can also quickly dispatch of Mantine. Lapras is a fine alternative option to deal with Mantine, packing Water Absorb of its own to combat the Rain Dance set's boosted STAB Water-type moves, and being able to respond with Thunderbolt. Gardevoir makes a great check by tracing either Water Absorb or Swift Swim, then outspeeding and OHKOing Mantine with Thunderbolt.</p>",

      "MANtine (Rain Dance)": {
        "description": "<p>As one can imagine, the ability to beat the usual counters to rain sweepers makes Mantine a great sweeper itself as well as a fantastic choice for a dedicated rain team. Almost every bulky Grass-type will be broken down by STAB Air Slash, which means other Pokemon that benefit from rain can sweep later in the match. Even as a standalone sweeper, the coverage offered by STAB Water- and Flying-type moves is fantastic, although Mantine does face competition from the more powerful but slower (in rain) Swanna. A fantastic Special Defense stat and decent HP also mean Mantine often has an easier time setting up than other rain sweepers, but the unfortunate trade-off is that Mantine is slightly weaker. A weakness to Stealth Rock means that it can also be worn down and revenge killed with priority moves, particularly with Life Orb recoil also taking its toll. Hydro Pump should be used over Surf as Mantine has a relatively low Special Attack stat and it really appreciates the extra Base Power. Air Slash is essential to hit Ludicolo and Roselia, not to mention other troublesome Pokemon like Water Absorb Cacturne. Ice Beam will rarely be used, but it will do significantly more damage against Altaria and other Dragon-types, so it is still occasionally useful. Alternatively, Hidden Power Electric can be used to beat other Mantine, as well as allowing Mantine to easily check Gorebyss.</p> <p>The chosen EV spread allows Mantine to outrun Choice Scarf Rotom-S and Rotom-F while it's raining. There is no need to run any more Speed than this, as no significant Pokemon will be outsped and Modest is completely necessary due to Mantine's low Special Attack. Damp Rock is certainly an option for the item slot, increasing the turns of rain and thus turning Mantine into a more support-based rain Pokemon, rather than one focused on wallbreaking and sweeping. The power granted by Life Orb will certainly be missed, however, so bear that in mind if considering using Damp Rock.</p> <p>The natural place for this set is on a rain team, and as such, Ludicolo, Seismitoad, and Gorebyss all make fantastic partners as they can wear down each other's checks and counters, particularly opposing Ludicolo, Roselia, and other bulky Grass-types. It should be noted that it is not necessary to use all four on the same team, however. Dedicated special walls such as Lickilicky and Audino still wall Mantine, so powerful Fighting-types are great choices for teammates. Sawk in particular will dispose of them easily, as will Gurdurr. Alternatively, Golurk is immune to most things those walls can do, while sharing fantastic synergy with Mantine.</p>"

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Mantine already has an excessive amount of special bulk, so it can easily run a set focusing on patching up its physical bulk in order to take advantage of its interesting typing and check the likes of Golurk, Sawk, and Piloswine, while also being a great counter to Gurdurr. It remains a great answer to Ludicolo and other rain sweepers, particularly with Water Absorb. Unfortunately, the only recovery Mantine has is RestTalk, but it is just bulky enough to use it without ending up a sitting duck. This lack of recovery can still hurt, however, considering Mantine is weak to Stealth Rock, but it can still be used. Scald is a fantastic move for a defensive Pokemon and means that very few Pokemon are 100% safe switching into Mantine, always fearing that potentially game changing burn. Air Slash hits Roselia and Cacturne, and being able to beat both while also absorbing sleep is a massive boon for Mantine.</p> <p>Maximum Defense is used to allow Mantine to effectively beat Fighting- and Ground-types, while the odd HP number is used to minimize the damage taken from Stealth Rock. It is also viable to use a specially defensive spread, which lets Mantine take on pretty much every special attacker without an Electric-type move, but such a spread loses out on the ability to counter many of the threats mentioned earlier, such as Gurdurr, Piloswine, and Golurk. Water Absorb is fantastic for beating dedicated rain sweepers, and the extra recovery can really help, particularly if Stealth Rock is on the field. Toxic is always an option, but Mantine really doesn't want to give up Scald or Air Slash and appreciates the utility both Rest and Sleep Talk provide. Replacing Sleep Talk can leave it a sitting duck occasionally, while without Rest, Mantine becomes very easy to wear down.</p> <p>Despite having Rest and Sleep Talk, Mantine still greatly appreciates support from a Wish passer, and, perhaps even more, from a cleric. Heal Bell can wake Mantine up from sleep, meaning it can come in and do its job multiple times. Lickilicky in particular carries Wish and Heal Bell while taking on special attackers with ease, and it also appreciates Mantine's ability to beat Fighting-types. Mantine is very easy prey for Volt Switch users, as they can easily force Mantine out and grab momentum. Naturally, Ground-types are excellent partners, particularly Golem and Golurk. Both of these Pokemon can set up Stealth Rock while simultaneously putting pressure back on the opponent, as well as having excellent synergy with Mantine. Piloswine can make another fantastic partner.</p>"

  "Swellow": {
    "overview": "<p>Swellow has not changed much throughout the passing generations, as its true potential has always rested in its ability, Guts. When Guts is activated, Swellow can clean up weakened teams, and being one of the fastest Pokemon in NU makes it difficult for it to be outsped. However, Swellow is very easy to stop, as its lack of coverage and low bulk make it an easy target. Swellow's Stealth Rock weakness and its vulnerability to priority attacks also make it increasingly difficult to use; even though it packs a punch, a lot of Pokemon can tank Swellow and KO it in retaliation. Additionally, the combination of Toxic Orb's effect, Brave Bird, and its frailness allow it to be easily worn down. Also, Swellow has difficulty defeating many Rock- and Steel-types in the tier alone, so it often relies on team support to get past them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A SubRoost set is viable, as it is great at keeping Swellow alive, but it should only be used with a Flame Orb because the damage from a Toxic Orb would pile on increasingly over time, and you wouldn't be recovering HP in the long run. Swellow can utilize Scrappy and a Choice Band to hit Ghost-types, but Facade is weakened, forcing it to rely on Return, a weaker Normal-type STAB. A set with Endeavor is plausible, but it needs good prediction to be successful. Toxic can be used to hit physically bulky Pokemon that switch into Swellow. Finally, there are a few lesser attacking options, notably Steel Wing and Pursuit, but Swellow has trouble fitting them into a set. There are very few other options Swellow should take, and it shouldn't drift from its standard set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Stealth Rock is a great way to weaken Swellow, so Pokemon that can set it on the field successfully, such as Golem, Regirock, and Carracosta, are useful in defeating Swellow. Overall, any relatively strong Rock-type can take multiple hits from Swellow and KO it, making the majority of them good counters. Steel-types, specifically Klang, can tank Swellow's attacks and set up on it, making them good counters against Swellow as well. Metang also completely walls Swellow and can even hit it hard with its priority move, Bullet Punch. Bulky Pokemon that can take Swellow's attacks, stall it out, and retaliate back are good counters against it; Misdreavus, Golurk, Alomomola, Lickilicky, and Eelektross all fit in that category.</p> <p>Choice Scarf users are one of the best ways to KO Swellow; Primeape, Sawk, Braviary, Charizard, Rotom-S, and Zebstrika are all examples of Pokemon that can outspeed Swellow and aim towards its frail defenses. However, be aware that most of them cannot switch into any of Swellow's attacks. Choice Scarf Haunter gets a special mention; it's a good check to Swellow because it outspeeds it and can't be touched by Quick Attack. Priority, excluding Sucker Punch, can severely weaken Swellow, especially when the opposing Pokemon can take a hit. Floatzel and Samurott are examples of priority users that can KO Swellow. All in all, any strong Pokemon that can take a hit can KO Swellow, as is not bulky. Wearing it down is also a way to KO Swellow, as without recovery, Stealth Rock, Toxic Orb's poison, and Brave Bird will quickly weaken Swellow. In particular, Ghost-types force Swellow to use U-turn or Brave Bird, which would wear it down even further.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Guts": {
        "description": "<p>Swellow plays the role of a hit-and-run Pokemon. It works best as a mid-game sweeper because while Guts increases Swellow's strength, it doesn't quite have the raw power to OHKO everything in sight; preferably, enemies should be weakened beforehand. To avoid being weakened, Swellow can get a free switch in to activate Guts from a slow U-turn or Volt Switch, a predicted double switch, and/or when one of its teammates is KOed. Toxic Orb is then activated, though it puts Swellow on a timer and forces it to switch out often to avoid cumulative damage.</p> <p>Facade is Swellow's main STAB move; after Toxic Orb's effect and the STAB boost add up, it reaches an amazing Base Power of 210, OHKOing Tauros and Rotom-S. Brave Bird is also Swellow's STAB move, and while the recoil damage can be harmful, it allows Swellow to hit Ghost-type Pokemon such as Misdreavus, Haunter, and Golurk. U-turn allows Swellow to pivot into a counter of the opponent, maintaining momentum for the user. Because Swellow cannot stay in long, it will often use U-turn after every attack or two. Quick Attack is Swellow's final move; while it is usually looked down upon, it does a good job in revenge killing weakened threats, and having priority can be useful. It also allows Swellow to dodge Sucker Punch from virtually every user, as Swellow outspeeds all of them.</p> <p>A Jolly nature allows Swellow to outspeed Zebstrika and Tauros, which is why Adamant isn't recommended, as Speed is much more important than additional power in this situation. Roost can be used in the final moveslot to allow Swellow to last longer on the field, but it rarely finds an opportunity to use the move. Flame Orb should be used if this step is taken, as it works better for late-game cleaning when Swellow can stay in longer. However, as Swellow switches very often regardless of whether Roost is used, Toxic Orb is often superior to Flame Orb. This is because for the first two turns Swellow is in, it will take less damage from a Toxic Orb than a Flame Orb, and Swellow is often gone after a second turn. Protect is a great way to guarantee that Guts is activated, and it allows Swellow to scout the opponent's attacks, which is especially useful against Pokemon with a Choice item. However, Quick Attack is really important in getting past Sucker Punch, making Protect a less desirable option.</p> <p>Rapid Spin support is useful if Swellow wants to come in without fearing Stealth Rock, but isn't required. Torkoal is a good option as a spinner, as it can not only remove entry hazards for Swellow, but also lay Stealth Rock for it. Offensive pressure is also a good option to keep Stealth Rock users at bay; Mold Breaker Sawk is a good partner to consider, as it can handle Lickilicky and Steel- and Rock-types. Having entry hazard support is appreciated as well, as it allows Swellow to revenge kill weakened foes easier. Pokemon such as Golem and Carracosta are good entry hazard setters for Swellow. There are a few bulky Pokemon that should be removed before Swellow can revenge kill, notably Misdreavus, Golurk, Piloswine, and Alomomola. SubCM Serperior handles Alomomola and Golurk pretty well, while Samurott and Ludicolo can deal with Piloswine and Misdreavus. Additionally, all of the aforementioned partners can also deal with Rock-type Pokemon Swellow cannot get past.</p> <p>Steel-types such as Klang are also Pokemon Swellow has trouble defeating, so powerful Fire- and Fighting-types, such as Charizard and Gurdurr, can deal with them. While Wish support is not necessary, it allows Swellow to recover lost HP. Lickilicky and Alomomola are both good options for such a task. Electrode or Electric-types with a Choice Scarf also give Swellow trouble; Dragonair is a great counter to them, as it can tank their attacks and retaliate. Ground-types can also deal with them as well, and they have good synergy with Swellow. Eelektross is also good against them, and it can provide a slow Volt Switch to bring Swellow in safely. Having sweepers to use alongside Swellow is a great option, as Swellow cannot outright KO many bulky Pokemon in the tier. Finally, Gothorita can trap and set up on most physical walls that can stall out Swellow, so it's a great partner as well.</p>"

  "Pelipper": {
    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written around the time that BW was considered the main generation. The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW NU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>Although Pelipper's defenses may not be stellar, its Water / Flying typing is very useful in the NU metagame for checking Pokemon such as Scolipede, Ludicolo, Charizard, Samurott, and most Golurk variants. Its access to Roost gives it a niche to differentiate itself from Mantine, who has to rely on the ResTalk strategy to keep itself alive. However, a weakness to Stealth Rock hampers its survivability and makes it harder for Pelipper to wall what it needs to, and a 4x weakness to Electric-type attacks makes it a magnet for Volt Switch. Its combination of moves, however, can make it a difficult Pokemon to bring down without being inflicted by burn or being hit by Toxic.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Pelipper does not have many other options that are worth using. It can attempt to go fully offensive with a Rain Dance set consisting of Hydro Pump and Hurricane, but Mantine fulfills that role better because it has superior bulk and access to Swift Swim. It can also try a defensive Rain Dance set, with Rain Dance over Toxic, as dual recovery with Leftovers in rain, boosted Scald and 100% accurate Hurricane turn it into a decently powerful mixed wall that is hard to switch into. Pelipper can also go physically defensive, but it misses out on Ludicolo, which is important. It can also use Tailwind to support its team, or Knock Off to annoy Choice users and Eviolite Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Electric-types such as Eelektross, Rotom-S and Rotom-F, Zebstrika, and Electabuzz force out the pelican repeatedly, racking up Stealth Rock damage on it while freely using Volt Switch to gain momentum. Speaking of Stealth Rock, it is also very annoying, as even with Roost, Pelipper will be hard-pressed to find time to heal itself. Duosion can take everything that Pelipper throws against it. Regice and Lapras can switch into Pelipper and force it out with Thunderbolt, but without Rest the first one is susceptible to Toxic. Carracosta also threatens it with Stone Edge, but it can't switch in because of the risk of being burned by Scald. Pelipper is also faster than Jolly Carracosta.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Pelipper can run a solid defensive set thanks to Roost, its great resistances, and usable defenses. This set focuses on handling special attackers, as Pelipper can naturally handle many physical attackers thanks to Scald and good Defense. The first move on the set, Scald, is STAB and gives Pelipper a chance to burn its opponent. This is especially useful against physical attackers and Life Orb attackers, as the chip damage from the burn will considerably reduce their longevity. Roost heals in a pinch and is a must on this set, as it is one of the numerous things that sets Pelipper apart from Mantine. Toxic allows it to further counter Ludicolo and other Life Orb sweepers, as the damage will rack up fast. The fourth move is up for grabs: Hurricane is a strong secondary STAB that has perfect accuracy in rain—which will only really come into play against Ludicolo—and dents most Pokemon that think they can switch in safely into Scald, while U-turn gives you momentum and surprises Jynx who think they can switch into your Water-type STAB.</p> <p>Rain Dish is the best ability for this set, as it allows dual recovery with Leftovers in rain. It will mainly come into play against Ludicolo. Even outside of rain, Pelipper can check Ludicolo. The EVs are fairly self-explanatory: 248 HP allows it to switch into Stealth Rock four times, 216 Special Defense lets Pelipper take minimal damage from Ludicolo and special Samurott, and 44 Defense EVs allows it to take on Swords Dance Samurott better.</p> <p>Good partners to this set are Pokemon that can take Electric-type attacks, such as Zebstrika and Golurk. Metang is also a great partner, as Pelipper resists the Fire- and Ground-type moves that it is weak to, while Metang takes on with ease the Rock-type moves Pelipper is weak to. Pelipper also enjoys partners that can prevent Stealth Rock, such as Mold Breaker Sawk and Taunt Misdreavus.</p>"

  "Masquerain": {
    "overview": "<p>Differentiating itself from its fellow Bug-types with access to Quiver Dance, Masquerain cements its primary niche as the only user of the move with access to Baton Pass, which allows it to pass its boosts to a partner. Finding opportunities to set up can be a difficult task, largely due to Masquerain's crippling 4x weakness to Stealth Rock that is further compounded with a defensive typing that is surprisingly easy to take advantage of. It has access to a useful ability in Intimidate however, which with the help of Roost gives it the chance to set up against a variety of physical attackers and defensive Pokemon. Even when it manages to set up though, Masquerain by itself does not make for a good sweeper and relies on the partners it passes to in order to keep up the offensive momentum; using it to its utmost potential requires team support in the form of Pokemon that can take advantage of the boosts that it provides.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>On paper, Masquerain has the capability to take a more offensive approach with Quiver Dance and attempt a combination of sweeping and Baton Passing. Such a set would be along the lines of Quiver Dance / Bug Buzz / Air Slash / Baton Pass with Life Orb to somewhat separate itself from Butterfree. Even then though, it isn't as fast or powerful as Butterfree and doesn't have the ability to put a counter to sleep, making it somewhat inferior in this role. Coverage moves like Hydro Pump and Giga Drain can work, as the former can get some nice hits on Pokemon that otherwise don't take much from Masquerain's STAB attacks such as Bastiodon and Flareon and the latter can score super effective hits against Rock-, Ground-, and Water-types such as Golem, Seismitoad, and Alomomola while regaining some health. Toxic and Stun Spore could be nice to cripple walls that Masquerain can set up on even further. This could also be beneficial for crippling Taunt Misdreavus as they normally expect to stop Masquerain from setting up without any consequences. Scald seems like a somewhat effective option because of its ability to inflict burns, something especially helpful in gaining setup opportunities, but it is rather weak. Masquerain can make use of both Rain Dance and Sunny Day, being able to fire off rain-boosted Hydro Pumps with the former, make use of Solar Beam with the latter, and provide momentum for teams based around either with U-turn and Baton Pass. However, Masquerain is quite slow and doesn't benefit from the common members of the weather teams all that much. Tailwind seems like a potentially useful support move, but Masquerain is often eclipsed by other users and can already pass Speed boosts with Quiver Dance.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The best way to counter Masquerain is to prevent it from getting a successful pass off. This part can often be tricky, as there are few Pokemon that can outspeed it after a Quiver Dance boost. One important way of making its job difficult is through the use of Stealth Rock, as chipping away 50% of its health makes it much more difficult for Masquerain to get around its checks and counters, set up, and avoid getting picked off. The single best and most reliable way of shutting it down is through the use of phazers, particularly the ones that aren't weak to its STAB and don't mind taking a boosted hit in response. Pokemon such as Bastiodon, Camerupt, Munchlax, and Lickilicky can take boosted hits with ease and ruin its strategy with Roar or Dragon Tail, though the latter has to beware of Substitute. Taunt from the likes of Skuntank and Misdreavus can also temporarily stop it from doing its job.</p> <p>On a more offensive approach, Swellow is initially a very strong response towards stopping Masquerain. Swellow can not only come in on anything Masquerain can do but also outspeed it even after a Quiver Dance boost and OHKO with Facade or Brave Bird. Charizard can also safely come in on Masquerain, outspeeds after a boost, and easily threaten it with Fire Blast. Making use of Choice Scarf users that can outspeed and OHKO Masquerain after a boost can also work wonders. Choice Scarf Braviary is an excellent answer to Masquerain as not only can it outspeed and OHKO with Brave Bird, but it can also discourage Masquerain from switching in on something that it can set up on due to the possibility of a timely double switch in an attempt to activate Defiant. Choice Scarf Primeape and Sawk are other good examples of such checks, as they can come in on anything safely other than Air Slash and proceed to OHKO Masquerain with Stone Edge. Answers also include Garbodor, which not only can deal a lot of damage with Rock Blast but can utilize Clear Smog to negate any boosts Masquerain or the receiver has and Toxic to cripple the receiver as it comes in. Golem and Piloswine are also able to threaten Masquerain with their respective multi-hit STAB moves, but they won't be able to stop it from Baton Passing out unless Masquerain is weakened enough to be picked off by Ice Shard in Piloswine's case.</p> <p>There are other measures that can be taken if you cannot prevent Masquerain from setting up and Baton Passing to a recipient. If necessary, you could try to predict what Masquerain will pass to and attempt to OHKO or status the recipient in some manner, but such a strategy isn't particularly reliable and should only be treated as a last resort.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "QuiverPass": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes a simple goal of setting up as many Quiver Dance boosts as possible so that a teammate can perform a sweep afterwards. The combination of Intimidate, Special Defense boosts from Quiver Dance, and a typing that grants Masquerain some useful resistances gives it the opportunity to set up on most defensive Pokemon; including Alomomola, Tangela, Seismitoad, Misdreavus, and Miltank, as well as on Choice-locked Fighting- and Ground-type Pokemon like Golurk and Sawk. It should be taken into account that it will often take a bit of prediction to find opportunities to pull off a successful pass with the general prevalence of Choice Scarf users. Once Masquerain has received enough boosts, then the most urgent thing to do is to pass to a recipient as soon as it can.</p> <p>Baton Pass serves an important role here, as not only does it pass Quiver Dance boosts but making timely use of it can work wonders towards easing prediction and gaining momentum when scouting common switch-ins such as Choice Scarf users or phazers. In terms of attacking, Bug Buzz is useful in the fact that it hits moderately hard after a number of boosts, while also serving as a tool towards bypassing some phazers such as Zweilous and Grumpig. Air Slash serves as a secondary option that can help Masquerain fend off Primeape, while also being able to nab an OHKO on Scolipede after a Quiver Dance boost. It should be taken into account that while attacking isn't particularly important for this set for the most part, running one of these moves does prevent Masquerain from being complete Taunt bait. Roost is one of Masquerain's most vital assets, as it helps increase its longevity mitigate its crippling weakness to Stealth Rock, potentially giving it more opportunities to set up later.</p> <p>The displayed EV spread is used to invest as much as possible into bulk while still maintaining the ability to outspeed positive-natured base 95 Pokemon such as Jynx, Primeape, Sawsbuck, and Haunter after a boost. Using 248 HP EVs instead of 252 is vital so that Masquerain has a Stealth Rock number and can switch in twice without fainting. If you care a bit more about outpacing as much as possible after a Quiver Dance boost, you can also forgo the standard option for an EV spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 Spe with a Timid nature, which allows Masquerain to gain the jump on everything up to positive-natured Swoobat after a boost. The bulk that Masquerain receives from the recommended Defense investment when factoring in Intimidate is very beneficial though, and many of the Pokemon this extra Speed helps with are declining in usage. As far as movepool options go, Substitute works as a good alternative to Bug Buzz and Air Slash as it can allow Masquerain to set up more reliably, give it protection from Dragon Tail Lickilicky and status, scout for Choice Scarf Pokemon, and provide its recipient with even more benefits once it's ready to Baton Pass out.</p> <p>One of the main reasons as to why Masquerain typically doesn't find much usage is because of how difficult it is to find a proper place for it on a team; it generally fits best on teams structured around a number of Pokemon that can both take advantage of Quiver Dance boosts and help it gain setup opportunities. Seismitoad is one of the best options for a teammate, as it not only possesses just the right offensive stats and Speed to be threatening after a boost or two but also synergizes well with Masquerain, being able to come in on a variety of Fire-, Rock-, and Electric-type Pokemon that threaten it. Other solid choices for teammates to pass boosts to include Ludicolo, Jynx, Electabuzz, and Haunter. Masquerain also benefits from Pokemon that are able to remove threats that force it out rather quickly, such as Golem and Piloswine, or can phaze it, such as Bastiodon, Lairon, and the like, as they otherwise ruin its strategy. Mold Breaker Sawk is an excellent addition for any team in need of a way to handle this category of threats and comes with the added benefit of being able to take on special walls that might hinder the sweeping potential of Masquerain's most powerful teammates. Special Samurott is a potent partner as well as it is capable of threatening a lot of Pokemon that set up Stealth Rock and can even prevent them from doing so with Taunt. Samurott also makes great use of Quiver Dance boosts and can break through a lot of defensive Pokemon with Taunt. Additionally, Air Balloon Probopass in particular has solid match-ups against most Stealth Rock users, while also providing a slow Volt Switch for Masquerain to come in safely and the ability to trap Steel-type phazers such as Bastiodon and Lairon. It also has nice synergy, being able to switch in on a variety of threats like Swellow and Choice Braviary while Masquerain can come in on Fighting- and Ground-type moves aimed at Probopass. As a more defensive option, Wartortle can support Masquerain by spinning away Stealth Rock and checking the Rock-type Pokemon that trouble it.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>To put it frankly, Delcatty is a terrible Pokemon, even in NU. Its stats are extremely underwhelming and its Normal typing does it no favors, as it gives it a lot of competition in the tier that it can't keep up with. However, Delcatty has an expansive movepool and a decent ability in Wonder Skin, giving it an extremely small niche in the tier as a Baton Pass user. Before using Delcatty on your team, you should always \"paws\" and consider something else in its place, as there is almost certainly something that can perform its role better for your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>As stated previously, Delcatty has an expansive movepool that most Pokemon would kill for. However, it is outclassed at anything else it tries to do. A set using Normalize and Thunder Wave allows Delcatty to paralyze Ground-types, but it leaves it helpless against Ghost-types, including Golurk, the most common Ground-type. Delcatty could make use of Fake Out and Sucker Punch as a makeshift revenge killer, but it is completely outclassed in this role by Kangaskhan, which has better Speed, bulk, and Attack. Delcatty has access to Wish and Heal Bell, but Audino and Lickilicky are both better users of these moves, as they have better bulk, offensive pressure, and Regenerator in Audino's case. Delcatty can possibly run a Calm Mind set without Baton Pass, as it has an expansive special movepool, but its measly Special Attack makes it an inferior choice to the likes of Musharna and Serperior.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Delcatty has the offensive presence of a newly born kitten and is probably even easier to defeat. Any Fighting-type move or any relatively strong STAB move will easily dispose of Delcatty. Delcatty can even be phazed out by attacking moves such as Dragon Tail and Circle Throw, meaning that specially defensive Throh and Zweilous are \"purrfect\" answers to Delcatty. Basically anything that can switch into Delcatty and OHKO or 2HKO it or its Baton Pass recipient are good options as checks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind + Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>This is the only set that Delcatty can use in NU without being completely outclassed. Baton Pass is the key move on this set, allowing Delcatty to support specially offensive teammates with Calm Mind boosts. Hyper Voice allows Delcatty to make use of those Calm Mind boosts if it is hit by Taunt or if passing is not an option. Substitute shields Delcatty from hits if it manages to force something out, and Substitute passing can often support a teammate's sweep just as well as passing Calm Mind, giving the recipient a free switch-in.</p> <p>The given EV spread allows Delcatty to outspeed max base 45 Speed Pokemon, such as Golem and Marowak, while making Delcatty as physically bulky as possible. Wonder Skin is the chosen ability, giving Delcatty a chance to set up in front of Taunt, phazing moves, and status moves. It is also the only reason to use Delcatty as a Calm Mind passer, as it is outclassed by most others in every other way. Good teammates to consider for Delcatty are those that appreciate the Calm Mind boosts while being able to switch into moves aimed at Delcatty. Charizard, Musharna, Exeggutor, and Haunter all appreciate the Special Attack boosts and can switch into the Fighting-type moves aimed at Delcatty with ease. Specially attacking Samurott is another good option to receive these boosts, and has the bulk to take most of the Fighting-type moves aimed at Delcatty. Pursuit trappers such as Skuntank are greatly appreciated by Delcatty, as trapping Ghost-types allows Delcatty to stand a chance if it is your last Pokemon. It should be pointed out that Delcatty is completely outclassed by Mr. Mime and Musharna on full Baton Pass teams, and therefore should not be considered for a spot on said teams. Delcatty really only belongs on joke teams, to be quite frank.</p>"

  "Volbeat": {
    "overview": "<p>Volbeat's most common role is to set up weather, which he achieves relatively easily thanks to his access to Prankster. He can also provide safe switch-ins for his teammates with Encore and U-turn. Additionally, he is notable for being the only Pokemon in the game, aside from Smeargle, that is able to Baton Pass Tail Glow boosts, which is his main claim to fame. Prankster gives these strategies priority, meaning that Volbeat will usually succeed in his goal. However, his mediocre bulk and Stealth Rock weakness limit Volbeat's chances to support the team multiple times. The fact that Volbeat cannot actually use his own Tail Glow boosts very well means that a player would have to cater their team around him, so make sure your team can use every bit of support this cute bug provides.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Volbeat doesn't have many effective options other than the ones listed, with an offensive Baton Pass set utilizing Tail Glow, Baton Pass, Bug Buzz, and Thunderbolt being the most notable one. However, such a set relies on Volbeat's average Speed while lacking enough bulk to take even resisted attacks well. Moonlight can be used with Sunny Day to recover a larger amount of HP, but Volbeat still prefers spending his turns supporting his teammates rather than trying to extend his own longevity. Light Screen can patch up Volbeat's low Special Defense, but without Reflect, he cannot fully support his teammates in this way. A priority Trick is usable with Choice Band or Iron Ball to hinder the opposing team and enhance U-turn (by boosting U-turn's power or increasing the chance that Volbeat will go last), but Encore and Thunder Wave are reusable and far more reliable. Psych Up can steal boosts from an opposing Pokemon for Volbeat to Baton Pass, but it is generally unreliable to depend on your opponent to have a certain moveset. Mental Herb can be a useful item to ignore Taunt once, but that is generally not worth sacrificing a weather rock or Leftovers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Volbeat isn't difficult to counter as he isn't very threatening on his own. Murkrow is Volbeat's best counter, as it has higher base Speed, Prankster Taunt, and a super effective Brave Bird to take Volbeat out. Liepard is also a great counter if Volbeat lacks Bug Buzz, as it can hit him with a status move that cripples his ability to set up. Rock Blast users, such as Golem and Gigalith, can take Volbeat out pretty easily, as they can break through his Substitutes. Taunt users, such as Samurott and Misdreavus, can make Volbeat useless if he lacks Bug Buzz, and even with that move, he isn't that threatening offensively. Encore users can lock Volbeat into a move as he will generally go first thanks to Prankster. Roar and Whirlwind users can phaze away his boosts, as well as phazing his recipients on the switch. Haze can make Volbeat's Baton Pass sets useless as well by removing Tail Glow boosts. Preying on Volbeat's defensive typing and low bulk is an effective way to prevent him from setting up more than once. Pokemon such as Swellow, Zangoose, Raichu, and Seismitoad aren't affected by Thunder Wave thanks to their abilities or typing and aren't that hindered by Encore as well; the former two need to have their status orb already activated in this situation. Choice Band Golurk is a notable Pokemon that Volbeat cannot touch at all, as it is immune to Thunder Wave and is already locked into a move. Stealth Rock and other entry hazards are a reliable way to limit how often Volbeat can switch in, usually restricting him to setting up only once. It is important to note that it is often better not to directly counter Volbeat, but to target at his incoming teammates who benefit from his support, as he isn't that threatening on his own.</p>",

      "Weather Supporter": {
        "description": "<p>Volbeat's role with this set is to support his teammates with weather moves. Rain Dance and Sunny Day are given priority due to Prankster and are almost guaranteed to be set up if Volbeat can safely enter the field. U-turn is usually the best move to use after setting up your selected weather in order to provide a safe switch-in for your sweepers while wasting as few turns of weather as possible. Volbeat doesn't invest in Speed, so he will usually move last, letting him safely bring in a teammate by taking the opponent's attack. Encore is used to create openings for Volbeat to either set up or safely switch in a teammate. Thunder Wave is not quite as useful, but it is excellent for hindering Pokemon holding a Choice item who don't care about Encore; it's also effective against Pokemon who have a high base Speed and don't set up. Encore and Thunder Wave are generally the most effective when they are used before Volbeat sets up weather in order to prevent the loss of too many weather turns.</p> <p>Volbeat has useful resistances to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, which are usually physically based. The EVs and nature take full advantage of that by maximizing his physical bulk. On a side note, you can reduce Volbeat's Speed IVs to 0 and use a Relaxed nature to get a slow U-turn on as many Pokemon as possible. Volbeat has a few other move selections that he can use on this set. One of these is Roost, but since Volbeat is still pretty frail and will usually take over 50% damage from powerful neutral attacks, he is generally better off focusing on supporting his team rather than healing himself. Baton Pass is an option over U-turn because of its priority, but Volbeat generally prefers being able to give his teammates a safe switch-in opportunity. Substitute and Tail Glow can also be used over Encore and Thunder Wave. While the power boost to your sweepers is amazing if this is successful, Volbeat generally won't be lasting long enough to accomplish all of this, so these options are best used on their own set.</p> <p>Weather sweepers are necessary teammates for Volbeat in order to actually make use of the weather he provides. With Rain Dance, Swift Swim sweepers, such as Ludicolo, Floatzel, Gorebyss, and Seismitoad, are excellent teammates. With Sunny Day, Chlorophyll sweepers, such as Exeggutor, Victreebel, Shiftry, and Sawsbuck, are all good options. Other Pokemon to utilize the weather are also useful, with Dry Skin Jynx, Hurricane Swanna, and Electric-types carrying Thunder all being good options for rain teams and Solar Power Charizard and other Fire-types, specifically Rapidash, being excellent options for sun teams. A Rapid Spin user to remove entry hazards is appreciated, as Toxic Spikes reduces rain team's lifespan while Stealth Rock does the same to sun teams. It is notable that sun teams tend to carry at least one Pokemon with a Grass / Poison typing, namely Victreebel, so they are less likely to be affected by Toxic Spikes. Swift Swim Armaldo is a good Rapid Spin user for rain teams as it receives a useful Speed boost in the rain; likewise, Shell Smash Torkoal is a good Rapid Spin user for sun teams, as its Fire-type moves are enhanced in the sun. If using a spinner feels like it is limiting your offensive pressure, having a Poison-type Pokemon, such as Scolipede, can help to remove Toxic Spikes for rain teams, while Mold Breaker Sawk can stop most Stealth Rock users before they can set up. Other bulky Pokemon that can help set up weather and ease pressure off Volbeat are helpful teammates. Rotom-S and Electrode are good rain inducers, and Regirock and Gardevoir are good sun inducers.</p>"
      },
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>Volbeat is the only Pokemon in NU that is able to Baton Pass Tail Glow, and this set is the best way he can accomplish this. Tail Glow provides an amazing +3 boost to Special Attack, which Baton Pass then gives to a teammate. Substitute is another option to use alongside Baton Pass, providing its recipient with a shield against attacks as well as status conditions. Encore is the best move for the last slot, locking the opposing Pokemon into an ineffective move to guarantee at least a single turn to safely set up. However, Thunder Wave is a viable option in order to cripple opposing sweepers, and it still provides a small chance of providing free setup turns thanks to paralysis.</p> <p>The EVs and nature take full advantage of Volbeat's useful Fighting- and Ground-type resistances by maximizing his physical bulk. Speed is not necessary because all of his moves have priority thanks to Prankster. Leftovers is the best item for this set because it guarantees that Volbeat can create five Substitutes if he hasn't taken any prior damage. Bug Buzz is a viable option over Substitute in order to enable Volbeat to take advantage of his own Tail Glow boosts and to not be entirely crippled by Taunt. However, even after a boost, his power is unimpressive with an uninvested base 47 Special Attack stat. He is also extremely slow without any Speed investment and will not likely be able to hit the opponent before being taken out first. Roost can also be used to enhance Volbeat's longevity, but it uses up a valuable turn which could be spent setting up or passing boosts.</p> <p>The best teammates for this set would be ones that can take advantage of the Tail Glow boost Volbeat provides. Water-type recipients, such as Samurott and Swanna, are notable because they can take Fire-type attacks that are aimed at Volbeat and retaliate back with powered-up Water-type attacks. Electric-types such as Eelektross and Electabuzz are also good recipients because they can take the Flying-type attacks that would destroy Volbeat. Otherwise, fast special attackers in general, such as Kadabra, Serperior, and Swoobat, are good recipients, especially if Volbeat isn't carrying Thunder Wave, as they can all sweep teams with a single boost. Note that Swoobat's Simple ability doesn't activate with boosts that are Baton Passed. Because entry hazards, notably Stealth Rock, limit how often Volbeat can set up, teammates such as Mold Breaker Sawk and defensive Torkoal are effective teammates to hinder their setup. Many players will assume that Volbeat can only support special attacking teammates, but many physical attackers, such as Golurk and Scolipede, appreciate Substitutes being sent their way.</p>"

  "Illumise": {
    "overview": "<p>Illumise looks at her brother, Volbeat, with jealousy as he refuses to pass on Tail Glow to her and hogs all the glory in everything they do. She is a decent weather support Pokemon with Prankster, as it grants her priority when using her weather moves. Encore, Thunder Wave, and Baton Pass are also notable moves that she can use to a great effect. A slow U-turn safely brings her teammates into the battlefield. However, few can overlook her mediocre bulk and Stealth Rock weakness, both which restricts the number of times she can set up. She also lacks anything worthwhile to Baton Pass, making Volbeat the better option with his ability to pass Tail Glow boosts. Illumise even has a weaker U-turn on the weather support set, letting Volbeat outshine her on an otherwise exact same set.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Like Roost, Moonlight is a viable option with Sunny Day in order to extend Illumise's longevity. However, Illumise will still lose over 50% of her health when hit with most decently powered neutral attacks, making the recovery turn less useful in retrospect. A Baton Pass set is viable, but Illumise has very few moves to pass because Growth is illegal with Baton Pass. Toxic has priority due to Prankster, but weather teams like to switch often, so it would have to Toxic the entire opposing team to truly have a significant effect. Charm is an option to weaken opponents before they can attack, but most attacks are still able to inflict significant damage that Illumise cannot usually recover from. Tailwind has priority and can support your team outside of weather, but Thunder Wave generally lasts longer and has more utility.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>While it isn't easy to stop Illumise from setting up, there are still some significant Pokemon that counter this lady firefly. Murkrow is Illumise's greatest nemesis due to its own priority Taunt, higher base Speed, and a super effective Brave Bird. Encore users are also a problem, as they can lock Illumise into a move and force it to waste valuable turns switching out. Liepard is also a significant counter because it can cripple Illumise with its disruptive moves. It can even set up the opposing weather and waste Illumise's work. Rock Blast users, such as Golem, are able to take out Illumise even if it has a Substitute up. Roar and Whirlwind users, such as Altaria and Mandibuzz, can force Illumise out into a possibly undesirable Pokemon or force an incoming weather sweeper out, preventing them from doing anything if Illumise used U-turn. Choice Band Golurk is another Pokemon that Illumise can't touch, as it isn't affected by Encore or Thunder Wave. If all else fails, simply wearing Illumise down can limit how often she sets up. Stealth Rock and other entry hazards limit her usefulness, and any relatively strong neutral or super effective attack can cripple Illumise permanently. Illumise isn't that threatening on her own; you are usually better off trying to handle the weather sweepers that usually follow after her.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Weather Supporter": {
        "description": "<p>Illumise's best role is to support her teammates as best as she can with her priority moves, courtesy of Prankster. Rain Dance and Sunny Day are given priority thanks to Prankster and are guaranteed to be set up if Illumise switches in safely. U-turn is usually the best move to use after setting up your selected weather to provide a safe switch-in for your sweepers while wasting as few turns of weather as possible. Encore forces quite a few switches, as locking your opponent into a support move or a resisted attack can give Illumise and her teammates a couple of turns to set up and possibly sweep. Thunder Wave is not quite as useful, but it is excellent for hindering a Pokemon holding a Choice item. It is also effective against naturally fast Pokemon that don't set up. Both Encore and Thunder Wave are best used before setting up weather in order to prevent the loss of too many weather turns, but they are helpful at any time if you use them correctly.</p> <p>Damp Rock and Heat Rock are the best choices for items, each with their respective weathers. The EVs are set to maximize Illumise's physical bulk, since Illumise's typing provides it with resistances to Fighting- and Ground-type moves, which are generally physically oriented. A Bold nature helps with her physical bulk, but Relaxed can do this while also lowering Speed. This is notable for anyone who wishes to have the slowest U-turn possible in order to guarantee that Illumise is the one that takes the opposing attack rather than a teammate. You might also choose to lower Illumise's Speed IVs to 0 with a Relaxed nature in order to be slower than most attackers. There are very few other move options that can be considered for this set, but Roost is the most notable one. Roost extends Illumise's longevity significantly, however her main goal is to support the team. A recovery move is simply distracting Illumise from her real goal: supporting her team.</p> <p>The best teammates for Illumise are weather sweepers that have their abilities activated under their respective weather. Ludicolo, Seismitoad, Floatzel, and Gorebyss are some excellent teammates with Rain Dance, while Exeggutor, Victreebel, Shiftry, and Sawsbuck are great options with Sunny Day. Other bulky weather inducers are highly recommended so that Illumise isn't bearing the burden of setting up weather alone. Rotom-S and Musharna are good rain inducers, Regirock and Gardevoir are good at setting up sun, and Liepard can set up either weather. Volbeat, ironically, makes an excellent partner to set up rain as well, becoming quite a difficult weather inducing duo to take down. Other Pokemon that can take advantage of weather are also good teammates. Jynx and Articuno appreciate rain, for Dry Skin and Hurricane respectively, while Solar Power Charizard and other Fire-types can take advantage of sun's boost to Fire-type moves. Something to remove entry hazards is very useful, as Toxic Spikes reduces a rain teams lifespan, and Stealth Rock does the same to sun teams. Swift Swim Armaldo is a good Rapid Spinner for rain teams, as it receives a useful Speed boost in the rain; likewise, Shell Smash Torkoal is a good Rapid Spin user for sun teams since its Fire-type moves are enhanced in the sun. If you feel like a Rapid Spin user is limiting your offensive pressure, having a Poison-type Pokemon such as Scolipede can help remove Toxic Spikes, while Mold Breaker Sawk can stop most Stealth Rock setters before they can set up.</p>"

  "Torkoal": {
    "overview": "<p>With very few viable Rapid Spin users in NU, Torkoal stands out from the rest with its balance of offensive and support roles. Boasting a fantastic base 140 Defense, Torkoal can effectively run a tank set, which makes it unique among the Fire-types in NU. It is also the best offensively-oriented Rapid Spin user in NU, as Shell Smash allows it to act as an offensive threat. However, Torkoal's lack of recovery—and the disadvantage of being outsped and KOed by many offensive Pokemon—can really limit its usefulness on the field. On top of this, Torkoal's typing makes it weak to the very same entry hazards it attempts to remove.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Torkoal has many alternative moves in its arsenal, but very few can be used effectively. Eruption is an option, as it is very powerful at full HP, but Torkoal is too slow to take advantage of the move. Overheat is also a powerful STAB move option, but Torkoal has to switch out to recover from the Special Attack drop, which loses momentum for its team. Heat Wave and Flamethrower are other STAB moves to consider if better accuracy or higher power is wanted, but they are notably weaker than Fire Blast and don't provide the good burn chance of Lava Plume. A Curse set with Gyro Ball, Stone Edge, and Earthquake is plausible, but Torkoal doesn't have a viable physical STAB move. Amnesia could be used to remedy Torkoal's low Special Defense, but Torkoal is still a bit frail in that area even after a boost. Sunny Day support is a great option, as Torkoal can offer Rapid Spin support to its teammates and use boosted Fire-type attacks in the sun, and Solar Beam would be a beneficial move to use. White Smoke could be used if stat drops are bothersome. However, stat-dropping moves aren't very common in NU. Finally, Clear Smog is a great way to deal with setup sweepers, but many of them will KO Torkoal before it can use the move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Targeting Torkoal's lower Special Defense is one of the easier ways to defeat it, so specially offensive Pokemon, such as Gardevoir, Gorebyss, and special Samurott, can dispose of it fairly quickly. Wearing Torkoal down with Toxic or Toxic Spikes is also an effective tactic, as it has no reliable recovery, so Pokemon such as Garbodor are good to use against Torkoal.</p> <p>There are also many Pokemon that can wall Torkoal with ease. Mantine in particular can tank any attack from any set and defeat Torkoal with its STAB moves. Altaria and Camerupt, while uncommon, can counter Torkoal very easily by tanking all of its attacks and retaliating. Specially defensive Dragonair can also tank Torkoal's attacks easily and set up against it. Most bulky Rock-types, such as Golem and Gigalith, can tank Torkoal's attacks and KO in return, but they must watch for a burn from Lava Plume or a boosted Earth Power or Hidden Power Grass. Depending on what move is in the final moveslot of the offensive set, either Frillish (if Earth Power is used) or Lampent (if Hidden Power Grass is used) can check Torkoal well. While Misdreavus can be OHKOed by Torkoal after a Shell Smash boost, it has Taunt to shut defensive Torkoal down and prevent Rapid Spin, only fearing a predicted Yawn. Torkoal can be offensively threatening if it sets up Shell Smash, while Yawn can make opponents battle with caution against the defensive set, but if you can prevent or avoid the two, Torkoal is easy to wear down and take out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes the defensive route in providing Rapid Spin support for the team and works well on both defensive and stall teams. Physical attackers have difficulty getting past Torkoal; Sawk and Swords Dance Samurott can only 2HKO it, and Kangaskhan only manages to 3HKO. Rapid Spin is the main reason to use this set, as it offers entry hazard relief to the team. Lava Plume is Torkoal's STAB move for this set, offering a 30% chance to burn the opponent. With Stealth Rock, Torkoal can support the team even further, laying entry hazards for its team to weaken the adversary. Finally, Yawn is a great way to force switches and put Ghost-type Pokemon in a bad position if used correctly.</p> <p>248 HP EVs allow Torkoal to switch into Stealth Rock four times at full HP. Because Torkoal lacks a reliable source of recovery, Leftovers is the recommended item in order for Torkoal to last longer in the match. As bulky as Torkoal is, critical hits can still break through its defenses; Shell Armor allows Torkoal to avoid these.</p> <p>An EV spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature could be used if you would rather strengthen Torkoal's Special Defense, but it is still easy to break through with special attacks regardless. A stronger Fire-type attack, most notably Flamethrower, could be used in place of Lava Plume, but the 30% burn chance Lava Plume offers often overshadows the increase in Base Power. Protect is an option in the final moveslot to scout the opponent and stall for burn damage from Lava Plume. Will-O-Wisp is also an option if you really want to guarantee Torkoal burns the opponent. Toxic can be considered to cripple Pokemon that don't mind getting burned, such as Musharna and Ludicolo. Hidden Power Grass is also an alternative to prevent Carracosta from using Torkoal as setup fodder on stall teams, but that's all it really offers. Finally, Rest is a great choice to give Torkoal a form of recovery, but it should only be used with a cleric or Chesto Berry to wake up Torkoal immediately.</p> <p>Torkoal has difficulties dealing with Ghost-types with this set, so good partners would be Pokemon that can take care of them. Skuntank in particular does well against these threats and can Pursuit trap them, giving Torkoal a chance to use Rapid Spin. If Torkoal is hit by Toxic, it is easily worn down and defeated. Clerics such as Misdreavus, Vileplume, Audino, and Lickilicky are great selections to prevent this from happening. Because Torkoal's mediocre Special Defense is usually targeted by opponents, partners that can tank special attacks work well with Torkoal; Lickilicky and Audino are examples of such. Water-types are also difficult for Torkoal to handle, so partners that can deal with them, such as Roselia, Regice, and Zweilous, are recommended. Torkoal lacks a reliable source of recovery, so Pokemon that can offer Wish support, such as Alomomola, are great to use alongside it.</p>"
      },
      "Smashkoal": {
        "description": "<p>Shell Smash allows Torkoal to nail every spinblocker in NU; it even gives Torkoal the opportunity to OHKO Misdreavus with Fire Blast after Stealth Rock damage. Because of Torkoal's ability to deal with spinblockers, it has many opportunities to use Rapid Spin to remove any entry hazards from its side. While its physical bulk is high, Torkoal still has difficulty setting up on Pokemon such as Choice Band Kangaskhan, Primeape, Sawk, and Tauros, so it needs to set up on either an offensively weak Pokemon or on a predicted switch. Shell Smash's stat drop can be troublesome, but White Herb fixes that, allowing Torkoal to take hits much more easily.</p> <p>Fire Blast is Torkoal's STAB move, and it can OHKO Eviolite Roselia and 2HKO Lickilicky and Mandibuzz after a Shell Smash. The final move of the set depends on what threat you want to cover. Hidden Power Grass allows Torkoal to OHKO Golurk and Carracosta, nearly OHKO Seismitoad, and 2HKO Alomomola after a Shell Smash. However, Earth Power allows Torkoal to deal with opposing Fire-types, such as Flareon and Rapidash.</p> <p>A Timid nature allows Torkoal to outspeed positive-natured base 85 Speed Pokemon and below after a Shell Smash, which includes Pinsir, Sawk, Braviary, Gardevoir, Adamant Kangaskhan, and Mandibuzz. On the other hand, a Modest nature offers more power to Torkoal. With Shell Armor, Torkoal avoids any dreaded critical hits that could unexpectedly KO it. Life Orb is an option if more power is preferred, but because Torkoal will be worn down even faster, it is not recommended.</p> <p>The main goal of the set is to use offensive force to find opportunities to use Rapid Spin, so not many partners are required. Pokemon that appreciate Rapid Spin support, such as Charizard, Rotom-S, and Swellow, are good partners to use alongside Torkoal. If Torkoal is hit by Toxic, it will be worn down much more quickly; clerics such as Audino and Lickilicky, which also offer Wish support, are good options to help prevent this.</p>"

  "Lunatone": {
    "overview": "<p>Lunatone has an interesting typing and a decent ability in Levitate but struggles to carve itself a notable niche in NU. It has low physical bulk, leaving it vulnerable to the Normal- and Flying-types that most other Rock-type Pokemon check with ease and also increasing its weakness to Pursuit trapping. It is mostly outclassed by the likes of Metang, Golem, and even Solrock, as they all beat a greater variety of threats. However, Lunatone distinguishes itself by being one of the best counters to most variants of Charizard, as it can take hits from them and hit back with a super effective STAB attack, while also having access to reliable recovery.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lunatone can run Trick Room, but it is unable to utilize it effectively and the move is used better by other Pokemon such as Musharna and Beheeyem. Lunatone can run a decent dual screens support set, but it is outclassed by Gardevoir and Solrock. Lunatone can try to become a boosting sweeper with Calm Mind, but its lack of physical bulk and vulnerability to status makes this a poor choice. Hypnosis is an option, but it has shaky accuracy and takes up a moveslot that can be used better. Ice Beam and Signal Beam can be considered to keep Grass-types away, but they provide no additional coverage. Similarly, Grass Knot can be used to hit Water-types, and Shadow Ball can hit Ghost-types, but they are useless otherwise and Lunatone's low Speed means it has to predict these Pokemon switching in anyway. Pain Split can be used for healing while wearing down the opponent, but it is completely inferior to the more reliable Moonlight. Cosmic Power can be used to boost both of Lunatone's defenses, but it does not make Lunatone any less passive than it already is. Finally, a full Baton Pass set can be used, with interesting boosts to pass such as Cosmic Power and Rock Polish, but it is outclassed by other Pokemon such as Ninjask and Musharna.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Lunatone is physically frail, meaning that most neutral physical hits can defeat or at least dent it. Lunatone's typing also means it has very exploitable weaknesses. Skuntank and Liepard are good counters, with the former being immune to Toxic and both being able to switch into most of Lunatone's moves. Skuntank can then proceed to Taunt, Sucker Punch, or Pursuit Lunatone, while Liepard can use either Pursuit, U-turn, Sucker Punch, or Encore to cripple it. Swords Dance Samurott, particularly variants with Lum Berry, can set up on Lunatone before OHKOing it with Aqua Jet to get around Rock Polish. If Lunatone is running Toxic over Psychic, Fighting-types are capable of destroying the utility set. Sawk and Primeape can hit Lunatone with a super effective Earthquake and U-turn respectively, while Throh sets up on Lunatone, getting an Attack boost from Guts if it is hit by Toxic. Steel-types wall Lunatone if it lacks Earth Power as it has no way to break through them. Bastiodon and Metang can switch into Lunatone, set up Stealth Rock, and get rid of any possible Rock Polish boosts by phazing it out with Roar in Bastiodon's case or KOing it with Meteor Mash in Metang's. Meanwhile, Klang can freely set up on Lunatone before OHKOing with Gear Grind. The best way to defeat Rock Polish Lunatone is to hit it before it sets up and passes its boosts to a teammate or attacks by itself.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<p>With this set, Lunatone makes for a decent utility Pokemon. Stealth Rock is obligatory team support and helps to wear down opponents. Moonlight provides reliable recovery, allowing Lunatone to stay healthy when checking Charizard. Hidden Power Rock is Lunatone's most useful attack, defeating Charizard, which cannot hurt Lunatone much. Toxic can be used to hit bulkier opponents and sweepers when Hidden Power Rock does insufficient damage. However, Psychic can be used instead to hit Pokemon that resist Hidden Power Rock, most notably Fighting-types.</p> <p>Earth Power can be used for pseudo-EdgeQuake coverage, but it is inferior to Lunatone's other options due to its low damage output. Magic Coat can be used to bounce back Taunt, status moves, and entry hazards. Metang is a solid partner that covers Lunatone's weakness to physical attacks. Metang is able to counter Flying-types for Lunatone and easily switch into opponents that try to hit Lunatone with a Grass-type move. Due to Lunatone's vulnerability to status, cleric support is appreciated. Hence, Audino, Miltank, and Lickilicky are decent choices for partners. Alomomola is a good teammate, as it is able to take physical hits for Lunatone, resists Water-type moves, and can beat several opponents like Samurott that Lunatone struggles with.</p>"

      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<p>Lunatone can take advantage of its resistances and immunity to Ground-type moves to set up Rock Polish. Lunatone is able to threaten Haunter and Charizard after a Rock Polish, and it can pass its boosts to a teammate once it's done. Rock Polish allows Lunatone to outspeed threats such as Choice Scarf Haunter, Choice Scarf Primeape, and Charizard. Psychic is Lunatone's best special STAB move. Hidden Power Rock is Lunatone's best secondary attack, enabling it to defeat Charizard. Baton Pass allows Lunatone to escape a potential counter and have its teammates continue its sweep for it; meanwhile, Earth Power gives Lunatone a legitimate chance to sweep by allowing it to cover Steel-types.</p> <p>The Speed EVs allow Lunatone to outspeed and OHKO +1 base 95 Speed Pokemon, including Choice Scarf Haunter and Choice Scarf Primeape, after a Rock Polish boost. A Modest nature with Life Orb is essential to give Lunatone all the power it can get, while a Timid nature does not let Lunatone outspeed anything very important. Moonlight is an option, but Lunatone is better off attacking every turn or using Baton Pass, and Moonlight is hard to fit into a moveslot. Fighting- or Ground-type teammates, such as Sawk and Golurk, are excellent; they really appreciate the Speed boost from Rock Polish and can demolish Steel-types that try to wall Lunatone. Magnet Pull Probopass is a good teammate as it can defeat Steel-types to clear the path for Lunatone. Regirock is another decent teammate, offering paralysis support to enable Lunatone to attack before boosting as well as giving entry hazard support. Encore or Memento support is appreciated, as they allow Lunatone more setup opportunities. Liepard and Muk are examples of Pokemon capable of providing this.</p>"

  "Solrock": {
    "overview": "<p>Solrock's mediocre base stats and common weaknesses leave it unable to shine in NU. It is mostly outclassed by fellow Rock-types Golem and Regirock, which are stronger and bulkier. However, some perks do give Solrock a niche; it is best used as a dual screens user on hyper offensive teams, being one of the few Pokemon that can set up screens and Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Solrock can be fit onto teams that want to take advantage of its typing and Levitate to check top threats including Charizard, Kangaskhan, and Tauros, in addition to useful moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Morning Sun.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Solrock can potentially run an offensive set with moves such as Zen Headbutt, Stone Edge, and Earthquake, but such a set is often done better by the likes of Golem and Rampardos. Similarly, while Solrock has a decent special movepool comprising Psychic, Earth Power, and Fire Blast, a horrendous Special Attack stat makes this unviable. Solrock can potentially run a full Baton Pass set with boosting moves such as Rock Polish and Cosmic Power. Other gimmicky but interesting options in Solrock's movepool include Sunny Day, Trick Room, and Gravity, although they are often better done by other Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ground-types do a good job at stopping Solrock as they resist every common move that it runs; Seismitoad gets a special mention because it does not fear burns from Will-O-Wisp as much and has a super effective Water-type STAB. Special attacking Samurott can do a huge chunk of damage to Solrock without fearing Will-O-Wisp, as do most other Water-types. Misdreavus is another good counter as it is immune to Explosion and has Taunt to shut down Solrock. Speaking of which, Pokemon with Taunt can do an admirable job at shutting down Solrock because it rarely invests EVs in Attack. Gurdurr, particularly Guts variants, can switch into Solrock and defeat it with Drain Punch. Exeggutor also does a good job at beating Solrock, especially LumRest variants that shrug off burns. RestTalk users can use Solrock as setup fodder; Klang is a perfect example because it resists every move Solrock commonly runs. As for checks, strong attackers such as Choice Band Sawk can OHKO Solrock, assuming it has not set up screens or used Will-O-Wisp.</p>",

With its decent Speed and access to these moves, Solrock can fit into hyper offensive teams by quickly setting up the necessary moves without losing momentum. At the same time, the frail setup sweepers on hyper offensive teams appreciate the insurance provided by dual screens to set up.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is an extremely useful entry hazard to wear down opponents for Solrock's teammates to sweep more easily. When playing with Solrock, it is better to use Stealth Rock early in the game and the screens during mid- to late-game. This is because Solrock does not have time to set up all three at once. It is also better to have the entry hazards up early to weaken the opponent's team from the start and then set up dual screens mid-game when the opponent's team is ready to be swept by a teammate. After Stealth Rock and dual screens are set up, Solrock can use Explosion to weaken opponents further and provide a free switch-in to a setup sweeper.</p> <p>Solrock can utilize Magic Coat to block Taunt, but it does not have a spare moveslot because the four moves listed give Solrock its niche. As teammates, powerful and frail setup sweepers appreciate the insurance provided by dual screens. Swords Dance Pinsir, Belly Drum Linoone, and Swords Dance Zangoose are excellent teammates for this reason. Because Solrock's support fits hyper offensive teams, offensive Pokemon that consistently pressure the opponent to weaken each other's checks and counters are good Pokemon for hyper offense.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Solrock's almost unique typing, ability, and access to Morning Sun and Will-O-Wisp allow it to function as a decent defensive Pokemon in NU. Despite the lack of defensive investment, Solrock can actually still check several Normal- and Flying-types, including Swellow and Kangaskhan, thanks to its Rock typing and Levitate. In addition, Solrock can check most Fire-types, most notably Charizard. Stealth Rock allows Solrock to support its teammates by wearing down opponents; it can set them up on the Normal- and Flying-types that it wall. Will-O-Wisp is a useful move to cripple physical attackers and wear down opponents. Morning Sun is a reliable recovery move that allows Solrock to continuously switch into opponents. These two moves set Solrock apart from other Rock-types. Finally, Rock Slide is Solrock's STAB move to defeat the likes of Charizard and Swellow.</p> <p>A specially defensive set is recommended as it allows Solrock to take any hit from Choice Specs Charizard at full health. Physically defensive spreads are generally done better by the physically bulkier Regirock, but they can be considered. Solrock can utilize Baton Pass to escape Pursuit trappers and bring teammates in safely, but because it is illegal with Morning Sun, that is not recommended. Magic Coat can be considered to deflect Taunt and entry hazards, but Solrock hardly has a spare moveslot and loses to most entry hazard users anyway. Roselia is a decent teammate for Solrock as they share decent defensive synergy and can both set up entry hazards to support the team.</p>"

The word on the street is that Hoenn scientists invented Castform in order to predict the weather. Maybe they should've just looked out their windows. Remember: \"Red sky at night, sailor's delight.\"</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>If it's not hit super effectively, it counters Castform. If it's bulky enough, it counters Castform.

It is said that Castform's molecules were found to be just like water, so presumably you could just stick it in a kettle and transform it into a nice cup of Earl Grey.

Start by using the weather move of your choice, and then once the skies have changed, it's time to pound away at the opponent with Weather Ball. Thunderbolt and Ice Beam are there to provide additional coverage, but you'll be so busy clicking Weather Ball you won't even realize these additional moves are there and that Castform got KOed 3 turns ago.</p> <p>Whether Castform the Weather Pokemon can weather the weather is dependent on whether the weather that it's weathering is the proper weather for it to weather. Whether the opponent can weather the weather is also subject to whether the weather that it's weathering is the right weather to weather. Whether Castform can weather the opponent is once again dictated by the weather and whether that weather is the favorable weather for weathering. But most importantly, you should know whether there will be weather to weather rather than what weather they will be weathering and whether they can weather that weather.</p> <p>Castform's overall low stats means that it'll struggle against many foes, so it'll appreciate support from entry hazards, dual screens, paralysis, and you returning it to its Poke Ball where it can take shelter for the rest of the battle. The items and EVs chosen ensure that Castform hits as hard as possible with Weather Ball, but odds are at the end of the day it's still going to be the equivalent of a wet paper towel fighting a mountain lion, even if it looks like Castform's got the balls to pull it off.

It has a huge support movepool, including Heal Bell, Wish, and Recover, which makes it seem like the ideal cleric, but it is horribly outclassed by Musharna and Lickilicky, both of which sport much better bulk. Chimecho's only niche is its access to Healing Wish, Yawn, and Taunt. These three moves allow Chimecho to effectively support its offensive teammates by giving them a second chance to sweep or clean up. However, Chimecho only fits on certain teams, and outside its access to Healing Wish, it is mostly outclassed as a supporter.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Chimecho has quite a few other options to choose from, but these \"options\" are usually better utilized by something else. Access to Wish, Recover, and Heal Bell allows Chimecho to become a cleric; however, both Musharna and Lickilicky perform this role much better. Chimecho can also set up Reflect and Light Screen, but both Gardevoir and Serperior outclass it in this role, as they are both much faster. Although Trick Room is generally a poor strategy in NU, Chimecho can set up Trick Room and use Healing Wish next turn, bringing in a Trick Room sweeper for free and giving it maximum turns under Trick Room. Chimecho also has a wide special movepool including Charge Beam, Energy Ball, and Shadow Ball, which it can use with Calm Mind, but generally Musharna and Duosion make better users of Calm Mind due to their superior bulk. Hypnosis is an option over Yawn for instant sleep, but its low accuracy makes it unreliable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Anything faster than Chimecho that carries Taunt shuts it down entirely. Both Serperior and Samurott can use Taunt against and set up on Chimecho or just attack it. Any Dark-type handles Chimecho pretty well, especially if it has access to Taunt. Skuntank can Taunt Chimecho then Pursuit trap it. Most strong STAB attacks can take out Chimecho with ease because of its poor bulk. Kangaskhan takes care of Chimecho with Fake Out and Double-Edge.

Yawn either forces the opponent out or puts it to sleep, giving Chimecho a chance to bring something in with Healing Wish. Psychic keeps Chimecho from being Taunt bait and can hurt quite a bit even uninvested. Taunt keeps opponents from setting up on Chimecho and also prevents entry hazards.</p> <p>Focus Sash helps ensure that Chimecho can use at least one Healing Wish or Yawn. Either Toxic or Thunder Wave can be used over Taunt, but Taunt generally has more utility than both of them. Chimecho's typing, speed, and ability along with Taunt help it take on most of the popular hazard setters in NU. Levitate gives Chimecho immunity to the common Ground-type attacks that Stealth Rock setters, such as Golem and Piloswine, tend to carry.

Anticipation is the most helpful ability because it warns Wormadam-S of any surprising coverage moves the opponent might carry. Iron Head is an option instead of Gyro Ball because it has more PP, but the lack of power is disappointing. Pokemon that resist Fire-type moves, such as Seismitoad, Camerupt, and Carracosta, make great defensive partners for Wormadam-S, and Camerupt can also phaze Pokemon trying to set up on it. Toxic Spikes support from Garbodor is very helpful to Wormadam-S as it aids in its stalling capabilities. Roselia can also set them up reliably, but stacking Fire-type weaknesses is not a safe idea.

Though Autotomize is the main reason to use Vanilluxe, a lack of reliable recovery and a horrid defensive typing make it hard for Vanilluxe to get a Speed boost. Thus, despite its respectable bulk, Vanilluxe needs support in order to succeed. Additionally, its coverage options are sprinkled with little more than Ice-type moves, meaning that it is often walled. Thus, while Vanilluxe can still be an effective sweeper, one must be careful to address its flaws with proper team support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>As previously stated, Vanilluxe has a bad movepool, but it does have a few other options. First off, while removing Hidden Power Ground leaves Vanilluxe helpless against Steel-types, Hidden Power Grass can be used to defeat some key threats, such as Carracosta and Seismitoad. Magic Coat is another reasonable option that can bounce back status and phazing moves, though Vanilluxe should focus more on offensive coverage. Similarly, Taunt could be used to help Vanilluxe beat bulky walls that would otherwise have their way with this set. The issue with Taunt is that it doesn't help Vanilluxe accomplish its job much better than the listed set does. Toxic is an interesting choice that would allow Vanilluxe to beat many of the common walls that would otherwise be able to switch in with impunity. Frost Breath could be used over Ice Beam in order to beat out Pokemon that try to set up Calm Mind, but it's only useful in very niche situations, whereas Ice Beam has greater power, perfect accuracy, and a chance to freeze the opponent. Lastly, a mixed set with Ice Shard and Explosion takes full advantage of Vanilluxe's good base 95 Attack. The main issue with this idea is that it forces Vanilluxe to either lose some Speed EVs or split EVs between Special Attack and Attack, lowering its overall power. In the end, you're typically better off running a special attacking set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>There are more checks and counters to Vanilluxe than there are flavors of Ben &amp; Jerry's. Most Fighting-type Pokemon can cleanly OHKO it, though few can switch in. Specially defensive walls and tanks, such as Audino, Mantine, Regice, and Munchlax, all take a pittance from Vanilluxe and can stay in to support their team or fight back. Thick Fat Miltank also deserves a mention, as it resists Ice-type moves and strikes back for good damage with Body Slam. Metang also causes this particular set problems, as it is only 4HKOed by a Modest Life Orb-boosted Hidden Power Ground, while it can strike back with a super effective Meteor Mash. Finally, priority users, such as Mach Punch Gurdurr and Bullet Punch Metang, ignore the Speed boost that Autotomize provides while hitting Vanilluxe for great damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Autotomize": {
        "description": "<p>The purpose of this set is to boost Vanilluxe's Speed with Autotomize and attempt a sweep. This set can handle a lot of offensive teams by KOing the opponent's frailer offensive Pokemon before they can secure a hit. While it may be difficult for Vanilluxe to find an opportunity to set up, if it is able to do so, it can truly wreak havoc for the opponent. Ice Beam is used on this set as Vanilluxe's best STAB. Hidden Power Ground provides the best super effective coverage alongside Ice Beam, hitting Steel- and Fire-type Pokemon harder than Ice Beam can, while Flash Cannon hits opposing Ice-types, such as Regice and Piloswine. Finally, though it doesn't benefit Vanilluxe in NU due to the lack of weather inducers, Ice Body is the ability of choice for this set, as Weak Armor is excessive with Autotomize, and it makes Vanilluxe much easier to take out.</p> <p>The Speed EVs on this set are used to beat +1 base 100 Speed Pokemon after Vanilluxe has secured its boost. The item choice is yours to make. Life Orb is generally the superior option, as without it, Vanilluxe is unable to 2HKO Piloswine after Stealth Rock damage. However, if you prefer to enjoy your ice cream at a slower pace, you can use Icicle Plate for a recoil-free 20% boost to Ice Beam. This option is reasonable as well, as more often than not, you'll just be using Ice Beam. Sawk, a Pokemon able to OHKO common special walls, such as Lickilicky, Munchlax, and Audino, is a great partner for this set. Choice Scarf Pokemon with base Speed over 100, such as Rapidash and Tauros, can both give the set troubles. Alomomola serves as a full stop to these Pokemon and can pass large Wishes back to Vanilluxe if things like Stealth Rock and Life Orb recoil wear it down too much. Seismitoad can switch into most Fire-, Steel-, and Rock-type moves aimed at Vanilluxe and set up the Stealth Rock that Vanilluxe needs to secure KOs against Piloswine. Similarly, Golurk is immune to Fighting-type attacks and boasts a resistance to Rock-type moves, while Vanilluxe can switch into Ice-type attacks aimed at it. Altaria plays a similar role: weak to Ice-type moves and resistant to Fire- and Fighting-type attacks. This type synergy makes these Pokemon fantastic partners for this set and can even give Vanilluxe opportunities to set up against Ice-type attacks from the opponent.</p>"

  "Beartic": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite being the strongest physical Ice-type in the tier, Beartic has trouble distinguishing itself from Piloswine. Beartic has good natural bulk, but Ice is a horrible defensive typing and gives it many weaknesses, including one to Stealth Rock. Outside of the rain, Beartic is too slow to sweep through teams. It also has trouble dealing enough damage to threaten dangerous Pokemon such as Ludicolo, Gurdurr, and Samurott. Beartic can post a threat to defensive teams that can't hit it as hard, but even then, it has to deal with common defensive threats such as Alomomola and Metang which it will often have trouble breaking. Make sure your team can make use of Beartic's ability to threaten defensive Pokemon and Grass-types before you give it a team slot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Avalanche is a viable option over Icicle Crash, as it is the stronger move when Beartic is attacked during the turn, but the negative priority means that Beartic will take damage from Pokemon that it normally outspeeds. Toxic can catch walls such as Alomomola on the switch, but Beartic normally doesn't have room for it. Focus Punch is an option for the Bulk Up set, but its Fighting-type attack is primarily used to hit the Steel-types that can prevent Beartic from keeping up a Substitute. Brick Break can also be used as an alternate Fighting-type move, but it is rather weak. Night Slash allows Beartic to damage Frillish, but it is too rare to be worth devoting a moveslot to handling it. Beartic has a few other setup moves, notably Hone Claws and Rain Dance; however, it is generally too frail to set up. Beartic has some usable special moves, such as Ice Beam and Surf, but it is better off using its physical moves. Beartic also has some interesting support options, most notably Yawn, Encore, and Roar, but it doesn't use them very well due to its poor defensive typing.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Metang counters Beartic completely, as it is neutral to its Fighting-type moves and threatens Beartic with Meteor Mash and Bullet Punch. Other Steel-types can generally take one Fighting-type move at full health and set up on Beartic. Fire-types, such as Torkoal and Simisear, can threaten Beartic, but Stone Edge is a problem for the frailer ones. Rock-types such as Regirock and Carracosta can take Beartic's Fighting-type moves at full health and threaten it back with their super effective STAB moves. Fighting-types can smash Beartic, but most cannot safely switch in. The two notably exceptions to this are Gurdurr and Throh, which both serve as full stops to most Beartic sets. Stealth Rock limits Beartic's decent bulk, allowing any Pokemon that can take a hit to strike back hard. As Beartic is quite slow outside of rain, anything faster than it can generally cripple it due to its lack of resistances.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>Beartic can make use of its decent bulk to set up with Bulk Up against defensive Pokemon such as Alomomola and Lickilicky. With this set, Beartic functions well on balanced teams that need a way of breaking through stall. Bulk Up improves Beartic's already good Attack stat and makes it harder for Pokemon such as Lickilicky to wear it down. Substitute works great in tandem with Bulk Up to block status and make it difficult for physically offensive walls to break through after a few boosts. Icicle Crash is Beartic's best STAB move and threatens Grass- and Flying-types such as Tangela and Mandibuzz. Low Kick has good neutral coverage alongside Icicle Crash, dealing with Steel-types and most Thick Fat Pokemon such as Munchlax. This set threatens stall teams, as most members cannot break Beartic's Substitute while any that do are threatened by its offensive moves.</p> <p>The given EVs allow Beartic to outspeed uninvested base 65 Speed Pokemon, such as Alomomola and Tangela, while maintaining as much offensive power as possible. Toxic Spikes work well with this set, as Beartic threatens most Poison-types and can continuously use Substitute to stall out offensive Pokemon that it can't immediately threaten. Garbodor and Roselia are good teammates to set up Toxic Spikes and absorb them from your side of the field. Bulky Fighting-types such as Gurdurr are threatening to Beartic, making Musharna and Misdreavus are good partners to handle them. Musharna can use a slow Baton Pass to switch in Beartic safely while Misdreavus can act as a spinblocker for your team; both can also use Heal Bell to remove status, which would otherwise cripple Beartic. Regirock and Golem are good options to handle the Fire-types that roast Beartic, most notably Charizard. They can also set up Stealth Rock, which allows Beartic to OHKO Charizard on the switch in with Icicle Crash. As this set can weaken walls such as Alomomola, Tangela, and Mandibuzz, sweepers that appreciate their removal are great teammates. Swords Dance Samurott, Calm Mind Serperior, and Kangaskhan are all good teammates to take advantage of the weakening or removal of walls.</p>"

      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set maximizes Beartic's initial power, threatens most Grass-types in the tier, and serves as Beartic's best set to use on rain teams. Icicle Crash is Beartic's most reliable STAB move and threatens many bulky Pokemon, including Mandibuzz and Tangela. Superpower provides good coverage with Icicle Crash and demolishes most Steel-types before they can retaliate. Stone Edge provides coverage against Fire-types, most notably Torkoal, that can take any other move on this set. Taunt is the preferred move for the last slot, as it allows Beartic to stop walls from inflicting status on it or recovering off the damage that Beartic inflicts. Aqua Jet is useful if your team needs priority, and it is the preferred option if your team provides rain support.</p> <p>The Speed EVs allow Beartic to outspeed uninvested base 75 Speed Pokemon, such as Garbodor and max Speed Golem. If Swift Swim is active, Beartic can outspeed Modest Electrode as well. The rest of the EVs help maximize Beartic's offensive power and minimize Life Orb recoil. Rock Slide is a viable option over Stone Edge, but the lower Base Power makes it harder to deal with Torkoal. Swords Dance is a viable option for the last slot, but Beartic is generally too frail and slow to set it up. This set is walled by Water-types, so Ludicolo and Exeggutor are good teammates to threaten them. Ludicolo can also provide rain support to allow Beartic to sweep more effectively. Fighting-types threaten Beartic as well, so Musharna is a good teammate to tank their moves and provide Beartic with Heal Bell and Thunder Wave support. Regirock can also provide Thunder Wave support to cripple Choice Scarf users and set up Stealth Rock to allow Beartic to OHKO Charizard on the switch in with Icicle Crash.</p>"

  "Weezing": {
    "overview": "<p>Just like many other Poison-types residing in the NU tier, Weezing has a relatively wide array of offensive and supportive moves. However, Weezing's movepool is not its only asset, as it also has a remarkable Defense stat, a great defensive typing, and an immunity to Spikes thanks to its ability in Levitate. With these factors considered, Weezing can counter the likes of Golurk, Primeape, Sawsbuck, and Sawk all at once—something not many Pokemon can boast about. While its Special Attack might not be stellar, it is enough to hit many Pokemon in the tier for some solid damage. Unfortunately, Weezing faces stiff competition from Misdreavus, which practically runs the same support moves Weezing uses but has an added bonus of immunities to Normal- and Fighting-type attacks. Its HP is not as large as Alomomola and Lickilicky, and it also has a mediocre Special Defense stat that can be preyed upon. Its Speed, while decent for a wall, falls just short of outspeeding key threats such as Roselia and Alomomola. Other physical walls also have other ways of being useful, such as Alomomola and Tangela, which can pass a Wish or put something to sleep, respectively, making it harder for Weezing to stand out from its competition.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Weezing is versatile, but that does not mean it can run a set as effective as the one listed above. An offensive set consisting of Sludge Bomb, Fire Blast, Thunderbolt, and a filler move is usable, but it doesn't focus on Weezing's main stat: Defense. Weezing has literally no viable physical moves, making its base 90 Attack stat just for show. Memento is possible to aid Pokemon such as Belly Drum Linoone and Shell Smash Carracosta, but there are other Pokemon in the tier who utilize that role more effectively. Weezing can summon both Rain Dance and Sunny Day, but it doesn't benefit from those moves and is generally outclassed by other weather setters such as Volbeat and Gardevoir. A set with Destiny Bond, Endure or Fire Blast, Will-O-Wisp, and Sludge Bomb holding a Custap Berry is a fun, gimmicky concept and could be useful in some situations. Rocky Helmet is a useful item that Weezing can use, which allows it to cut down HP of an opponent using a contact move, but the loss of passive recovery can degrade its lifespan. Sludge Wave is slightly stronger than Sludge Bomb, but Weezing enjoys the higher poison chance than the power most of the time.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky Psychic-types, such as Musharna and Duosion, take little damage from Weezing's attacks, don't mind Taunt too much, and can use Psychic for the kill. Gardevoir can also outspeed and OHKO with Psychic. Fire-types, such as Charizard, Simisear, and Camerupt, can proceed to come in on a Fire-type move and roast Weezing with their STAB attacks; however, the first two get hit hard with Sludge Bomb, so you should be cautious. Generally, strong special attackers, such as Life Orb Haunter and Eelektross, can dispatch of Weezing in two hits with their STAB moves. A fast Taunt from Misdreavus or Samurott can also prevent Weezing from doing much. Regice can take even a Flamethrower and retaliate back with Ice Beam.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>This is Weezing's trademark set; it prevents physical attackers such as Golurk and Sawk from steamrolling through your team easily. Will-O-Wisp is a necessity for Weezing to incapacitate physical attackers and prevent them from harming it and its fellow teammates. Sludge Bomb is a moderately strong STAB attack that hits many relevant Pokemon such as Swellow and Kangaskhan hard. Flamethrower roasts the Bug- and Steel-types that Weezing wouldn't normally be able to touch, hitting Pokemon like Metang for solid damage. Pain Split is also a possible choice for the third slot, increasing the survivability of Weezing as well as dwindling the opposing Pokemon's health if the circumstances are right. Haze sets the opponent's boosted stats back to 0, which is useful against Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary and Nasty Plot Misdreavus. Taunt can also prevent slower setup sweepers from setting up at all, but it is less reliable, as Weezing is outsped by numerous Pokemon; however, it can stop Pokemon such as Piloswine and Regirock from setting up Stealth Rock as well as prevent Wishes from Lickilicky and Audino, so it is still a solid option for the last slot.</p> <p>Black Sludge is used over Leftovers to punish Trick users and make them want to Trick their Black Sludge away, wasting valuable turns and giving Weezing time to either cripple or hurt them. Fire Blast can be used to secure a 3HKO on Metang, but those KOs don't matter too much since burning them is already crippling them enough. Toxic is usually not recommended, as Weezing's main job is burning opponents, and there are much better candidates to do that job. Clear Smog can also be used in the last slot, but it is generally inferior to Haze, which can pass through Substitute. For teammates, Lickilicky and Audino can sponge most special hits and can pass big Wishes to Weezing. Metang and Skuntank can come in on any Psychic-type Pokemon including Gardevoir (when something is already put to sleep) and Musharna, walling or Pursuit trapping them, respectively. Weezing can support Ludicolo and Tauros by beating Golurk for them. Musharna can handle Mold Breaker Sawk, making it a good partner on stall and balanced teams.</p>"

  "Leafeon": {
    "overview": "<p>Whether as a defensive or offensive Pokemon, Leafeon ends up being outclassed in most roles by its fellow Grass-types. With a mediocre movepool, poor special bulk, and weaknesses to common types such as Fire and Flying, it has trouble fitting on most teams. Leafeon does have a niche as a bulky support Pokemon that has decent offensive presence, making a Baton Pass set its most effective set. It also reaches an important Speed benchmark, allowing Leafeon to Speed tie with unboosted Primeape and Sawsbuck. Despite competing with, and being walled by, its fellow Grass-types, Leafeon works wells as an offensive support Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>The most notable alternatives make use of Leafeon's good utility moves in Wish, Heal Bell, and Roar. Unfortunately, there are usually better Pokemon for these roles on stall teams, while balanced teams have little need for these moves. Yawn is a usable move that can act as a phazing move, but Leafeon rarely has room for it. Bullet Seed is an alternative STAB move that can hit Golem through Sturdy and possibly break frail Substitutes, but its utility is limited otherwise. X-Scissor hits opposing Grass-types super effectively; the problem is that some common Grass-types have secondary types that resist Bug-type moves, such as Roselia and Jumpluff, while others, such as Tangela, are too bulky for Leafeon to beat. Leafeon can set up Sunny Day well due to its decent physical bulk, but it lacks coverage compared to other Chlorophyll sweepers such as Sawsbuck and Victreebel. Toxic can cripple physical walls such as Misdreavus, but Leafeon would rather Baton Pass or manually switch out instead. Curse is an alternative boosting move, but wastes one of Leafeon's best traits in its good Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Being a Baton Pass user, Leafeon is difficult to counter as it can simply escape battle while supporting its incoming teammate. Weezing is the perfect counter to Leafeon, as it can easily take any move Leafeon uses, threaten Leafeon with its Poison-type STAB moves, and remove any accumulated boosts with Haze. Golbat and Mandibuzz are also good counters to Leafeon, and they have Taunt and/or Whirlwind to stop Leafeon from reliably supporting its team. Misdreavus can tank a boosted Leaf Blade and either retaliate with Foul Play or Taunt Leafeon. Faster Taunt users can prevent Leafeon from setting up or using Baton Pass, and a few can easily take Leaf Blades from it. Roar and Whirlwind users, notably Bastiodon and Grumpig, can phaze Leafeon out; Leaf Blade wears them down quickly however. Haze users such as Wartortle can neutralize Swords Dance boosts, but cannot remove Substitute. Encore users, including Liepard and Volbeat, can lock Leafeon into one of its setup moves and give their teammates a free turn.</p> <p>There are many Pokemon that can wall Leafeon, though they usually cannot prevent Leafeon from Baton Passing to its teammate. Most Poison-types such as Garbodor and Muk can wall Leafeon's attacks and threaten it with their STAB moves. Fire- and Flying-types such as Charizard, Rapidash, and Braviary can tank a couple of hits from Leafeon and threaten it out; many can also outspeed Leafeon and can possibly prevent it from using Baton Pass. Bug-types such as Pinsir can tank any hit from Leafeon, set up on it, and threaten it with their STAB moves. All three of these types do not appreciate the rare Roar, as they are vulnerable to Stealth Rock. Steel-types, such as Klang and Metang, wall Leafeon and can use it to set up safely. Dragon-types, such as Fraxure and Altaria, also wall Leafeon and can threaten it out, set up against it, or possibly Taunt it in Fraxure's case. Sap Sipper Pokemon, most notably Miltank and Sawsbuck, receive an Attack boost from Leafeon's STAB moves, can set up on it, and threaten Leafeon and its teammates with their STAB Normal-type moves. Bulky Grass-types have little trouble tanking Leafeon's attacks, but they rarely can do much damage to Leafeon in return. If all else fails, Leafeon without a Substitute can be revenge killed before it can use Baton Pass, especially if the Pokemon is specially offensive, such as Choice Scarf Charizard, Kadabra, or Tauros.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>This set makes the most of Leafeon's decent physical bulk to set up on common defensive threats such as Seismitoad and Alomomola. Swords Dance is a potent move for this set, as it either enhances Leafeon's decent offensive power or allows a teammate to sweep more effectively. Substitute protects Leafeon from status as well as buffering Leafeon from weak attacks. Baton Pass allows Leafeon to give a teammate either a powerful boost or a shield against an attack. Even without having either a Swords Dance boost or a Substitute, Leafeon can use Baton Pass to scout your opponent's team and maintain your team's momentum. Leaf Blade rounds out this set by giving Leafeon a powerful STAB move that allows it to make use of Swords Dance boosts if you choose not to Baton Pass immediately.</p> <p>The HP EVs allow Leafeon to maintain a Substitute against weak attacks from defensive Pokemon such as Alomomola, Seismitoad, and Lickilicky. The Speed EVs are maximized so that Leafeon outspeeds common threats such as Sawk, Zangoose, and Gardevoir and either Baton Pass out or hit them hard with Leaf Blade, while the remaining EVs are placed in Attack to improve its damage output. Jolly is the preferred nature as it allows Leafeon to Speed tie with Sawsbuck and Primeape that lack a Choice Scarf and Baton Pass out. Leftovers is this set's only form of recovery, and is necessary because it allows Leafeon to make as many as five Substitutes at full health. Synthesis is a viable move over Substitute, as it helps to keep Leafeon's HP high enough to Baton Pass multiple times, but Leafeon does prefer protection from status more. Return can be used over Baton Pass to provide decent neutral coverage with Leaf Blade, but Leafeon is usually better off Baton Passing its boosts to a teammate rather than trying to sweep on its own due to its lack of STAB on Return. This set will have trouble with opposing Grass- and Poison-types, so a Fire-type, such as Charizard, is a good teammate to handle them. Water-type teammates, such as Carracosta or Samurott, help deal with opposing Fire-types; these particular teammates also appreciate the Swords Dance boosts Leafeon can send their way. Other Pokemon that can make use of Swords Dance boosts are excellent teammates to maximize the team's synergy, especially so when these Pokemon threaten Leafeon's counters, such as Kangaskhan, Sawk, and Primeape, which can wear down opposing Ghost- and Steel-types.</p>"

The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW NU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>Glaceon has a very high Special Attack, which makes it a powerful wallbreaker that can even 2HKO dedicated special walls such as Audino and Lickilicky. Its Ice typing also gives it good coverage in NU, hitting a good portion of the tier for high amounts of damage. Glaceon also has usable bulk, so it is capable of taking hits decently. Glaceon also has enough Speed to outpace some of the slower Pokemon in the tier. However, Glaceon's typing, while great offensively, is poor defensively, giving it numerous exploitable weaknesses and few resistances. Its movepool is also very small, giving it very limited coverage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Glaceon has a relatively small movepool, and there isn't much it can use aside from what is listed above. Barrier is an option that allows Glaceon to increase its bulk and Baton Pass more effectively. Unfortunately, Barrier is a very situational move at best. Wish can be used to give Glaceon some form of recovery, but despite Glaceon's bulk, its defensive typing is not very good. In addition, due to Glaceon's low HP, its Wishes are not very large. A Choice Scarf is an option to allow Glaceon to patch up its low Speed and be a decent revenge killer.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Glaceon does not have many counters due to its raw power, but it has plenty of checks thanks to its low Speed and poor defensive typing. That said, Munchlax and Regice are the best counters to Glaceon available, as their great special bulk and Ice resistance means they take little from Ice Beam and can cripple it with paralysis. Fighting-types such as Sawk and Gurdurr are able to make quick work out of Glaceon. Fire-types such as Charizard and Rapidash can also check Glaceon well, but cannot switch in safely. Carracosta can switch into a resisted Ice Beam and OHKO with Stone Edge.</p>",

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs allows Glaceon to serve as a powerful wallbreaker, being able to deal heavy damage to many Pokemon in the tier. Ice Beam serves as strong and reliable STAB, able to 2HKO Audino and Lickilicky after Stealth Rock damage. Hidden Power Ground hits Steel-types such as Probopass as well as some Fire-types such as Rapidash. Signal Beam hits Musharna hard and serves as a filler in general. The last moveslot makes full use of Glaceon's relatively poor movepool. Baton Pass allows Glaceon to switch out of its counters and resort to a teammate, while Frost Breath allows it to bypass Calm Mind Musharna.</p> <p>A Modest nature is chosen to attain all of the power needed. A Timid Nature is a viable alternative if one wants Glaceon to outspeed neutral nature Ludicolo, but the extra power provided by Modest is preferable. Ice Body is Glaceon's only legal ability, despite the lack of hail. Wish could be used over Baton Pass or Frost Breath to pass HP to a teammate, but the other two moves have more overall utility; Glaceon's HP is also rather low. Hidden Power Fighting is a usable alternative as it 2HKOes Piloswine and does heavy damage to Regice; the ability to hit Metang with Hidden Power Ground is often more desirable, however. Shadow Ball is also a usable alternative over Signal Beam as it hits Misdreavus as well as the lesser seen Frillish and Shedinja, but Signal Beam is often more useful as there are no Pokemon immune to it.</p> <p>Sawk is an excellent teammate for Glaceon, as it handles Steel-types and Regice while also removing Stealth Rock users. Musharna also makes a great teammate, being able to handle Fighting-types as well as Baton Pass Calm Mind boosts to allow Glaceon to hit even harder. A Water-type such as Samurott or Carracosta can handle Fire-types which threaten Glaceon, such as Charizard. Finally, sweepers that appreciate Glaceon's wallbreaking prowess, such as Ludicolo, Choice Scarf Primeape, and Charizard, make good teammates.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With its good attacking stats, Shiftry is an incredibly effective mixed attacker that can punch holes in teams with its various coverage moves, such as Leaf Storm, Nature Power, and Dark Pulse. Shiftry's access to priority in Sucker Punch means despite its average Speed, it can still hold its own against faster offensive teams. Sucker Punch also makes Shiftry a dangerous Swords Dance user, as nothing faster than Shiftry likes taking a boosted Sucker Punch. However, having a 4x weakness to U-turn and being frail in general means it can be checkmated rather easily by Pokemon such as Primeape and Braviary, while having difficulty switching into an attack or boosting with Swords Dance. Its typing is both a blessing and a curse; it's very useful for checking dangerous Pokemon such as Swords Dance Samurott and Exeggutor, but it also leaves Shiftry easily walled by common threats such as Mandibuzz and Bulk Up Braviary.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shiftry can use a Sunny Day set with Chlorophyll and Solar Beam to attempt to sweep teams, but setting up Sunny Day can be difficult. Additionally, if not done, Shiftry cannot use its Grass STAB reliably. Tailwind gives the same Speed boost as Sunny Day and also supports its teammates; however, using Tailwind gives up a moveslot that Shiftry could be using for something more important. Leaf Storm can be used along with Power Swap, but Shiftry has neither the moveslots nor the bulk to be attempting such a set. Substitute can be used, as Shiftry tends to force many switches, but like most of its other options, it cannot afford to give up any moveslots.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Shiftry can be hard to counter directly, but it is easy to check due to its frailty and poor defensive typing. Mandibuzz and specially defensive Zweilous wall Shiftry regardless of the set and can both phaze Shiftry out if it tries setting up. Bulk Up Braviary walls the mixed attacker set and fares decently against the Swords Dance variants. Both Klang and Regice do very well against mixed Shiftry, but a boosted attack from Swords Dance variants can easily cripple them. Specially defensive Ludicolo can take two Leaf Storms—even after Stealth Rock—and heal itself with Synthesis to wear Shiftry down with Life Orb recoil. However, against Swords Dance variants, Ludicolo becomes prey, as Shiftry can easily set up on it and only fears a burn from Scald. Fighting-types such as Primeape, Sawk, and Gurdurr destroy Shiftry, and Primeape in particular also uses U-turn, which can give it the advantage even if Shiftry switches out.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This set is very dangerous and versatile because it has a move for almost every situation. Leaf Storm is Shiftry's strongest attack and hits extremely hard, even against Pokemon that resist it, such as Braviary and Garbodor. Sucker Punch allows Shiftry to pick off faster threats such as Charizard, Scolipede, and Jynx, as well as weakened Pokemon. Dark Pulse is Shiftry's secondary special STAB attack and does good damage to Pokemon that resist Grass such as Scolipede, Exeggutor, Charizard, and Tangela. Nature Power rounds out Shiftry's coverage by hitting Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon, such as Skuntank, Roselia, Metang, and Probopass.</p> <p>176 Speed EVs allow Shiftry to outspeed Modest Ludicolo and Samurott while 88 Attack EVs let Shiftry OHKO Charizard with Sucker Punch after Stealth Rock and 2HKO Roselia with Nature Power after Stealth Rock. Max Speed and a Mild nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Sawk and Speed tie with other base 80 Speed Pokemon, but Shiftry has to sacrifice Attack EVs and loses out on a lot of power. Early Bird is a somewhat situational ability, but it allows Shiftry to check Choice Scarf Jynx more easily, as it's not afraid of being put to sleep if it predicts wrong with Sucker Punch. It also makes Shiftry a very good offensive check to Exeggutor as it doesn't fear its STABs or Sleep Powder very much. Explosion is an interesting move that allows Shiftry to damage specially defensive walls such as Roselia, Regice, and Mandibuzz so that a partner such as Samurott or Haunter can break through them more easily. Giga Drain is a good option, as it means Shiftry won't have to deal with Leaf Storm's Special Attack drops when picking off Pokemon such as Samurott or Golem, and it allows Shiftry to heal off Life Orb recoil. The main problem with Giga Drain is that Shiftry has to give up a move to use it, and it can't really afford to lose any of its attacks. Nasty Plot can be used over Nature Power and alongside Giga Drain so that Shiftry can make the most out of its special attacks if it finds a chance to set up. Entry hazard support is appreciated, as Shiftry gets some key KOs with it; it 2HKOes Roselia with Nature Power after Stealth Rock, OHKOes Charizard with Sucker Punch after Stealth Rock, 2HKOes Metang with Nature Power after one layer of Spikes, and OHKOes Ludicolo with Leaf Storm after Stealth Rock. Golurk in particular is a good partner, as it can get up Stealth Rock and take on the Fighting-type Pokemon that threaten Shiftry. Garbodor can also take on Fighting-type Pokemon and can set up Spikes, while Shiftry takes down the Ground-types that give Garbodor trouble.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Shiftry's access to Sucker Punch makes it an incredibly dangerous Swords Dance sweeper, as most faster opponents are incapable of taking a boosted hit. That being said, due to Shiftry's bad defensive typing and mediocre 90 / 60 / 60 defenses, it can have some difficulty setting up. However, it can use some of its resistances and the fear that its mixed attacker set gives off to set up against Pokemon such as Musharna, Alomomola, and Exeggutor. Sucker Punch is extremely powerful once boosted, even capable of OHKOing Primeape after Stealth Rock damage and OHKOing the majority of offensive Pokemon. Seed Bomb is Shiftry's secondary STAB and allows Shiftry to break through common physical walls, such as Regirock and Alomomola, without any trouble. Nature Power rounds out the coverage, hitting Steel-type Pokemon such as Metang and Klang, OHKOing both after a boost.</p> <p>A Jolly nature can be used so that Shiftry can outspeed Adamant Sawk and Speed tie with other base 80 Speed Pokemon, but Shiftry misses out on the power and is generally using Sucker Punch anyway. Muk, Garbodor, and Scolipede are good teammates for Shiftry, as they can all deal with the Fighting-types that give Shiftry trouble. They can also capable of beating Tangela, Substitute variants of Serperior, and supporting it in other ways: Garbodor and Scolipede can both set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes to cripple Tangela and Serperior, while Muk walls both of them while spreading Poison to Tangela via Poison Jab and Poison Touch. Memento Muk in particular works very well with Shiftry, as Memento can give Shiftry the free opportunity to set up a Swords Dance and sweep.</p>"

  "Raticate": {
    "overview": "<p>Raticate suffers from many horrendous flaws, which is why it gets the shaft in favor of other Normal-types such as Zangoose. Due to its mediocre bulk, Raticate is often hard-pressed to find a chance to switch in. While Raticate has an amazing ability in Guts, it is outclassed by nearly every Guts-using Pokemon in the tier, most of whom are either faster, more powerful, or bulkier than Raticate. To make matters worse, Raticate has a barren physical movepool, making it relatively easy to wall.</p> <p>Despite these flaws, Raticate still has several traits that make it worth using in the NU metagame. Its base 97 Speed is a blessing, as it allows Raticate to outpace common Pokemon such as Sawsbuck and Haunter. Raticate is the only Guts user which has access to Sucker Punch, allowing it to revenge kill Pokemon such as Kadabra, Choice Scarf Haunter, and Choice Scarf Gardevoir. Raticate also has access to both U-turn and Swords Dance, allowing it to function as either a scout or a sweeper. Although Raticate is largely outclassed by Zangoose and Swellow, its higher Speed and lack of a Stealth Rock weakness set it apart from these respective Guts users.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Raticate can use its alternate ability, Hustle, with a Choice Scarf to become a fast and powerful revenge killer. Unfortunately, Raticate is a rather unreliable revenge killer due to the accuracy-lowering effects of Hustle. Hone Claws can be used in tandem with Hustle to mitigate the accuracy issues, but at this point, you're better off using the Guts set with Swords Dance. Raticate can use Super Fang to halve the opponent's HP, but this is an extremely risky tactic, as nearly any move from the foe will OHKO Raticate. Finally, Raticate has an excellent special movepool, with moves such as Shadow Ball, Charge Beam, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Blizzard, but its mediocre Special Attack makes these moves all but useless.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky Rock-types such as Regirock and Golem make excellent counters to Raticate, as apart from the rare Reversal they fear absolutely nothing and can OHKO with Stone Edge. Metang is a great counter, as it can withstand a Swords Dance boosted-Facade and OHKO in return with Meteor Mash. Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Golurk can bypass Sucker Punch with a non-damaging move and stall Raticate out due to its status Orb, but they lose if Raticate is carrying Crunch. Alomomola and Tangela can stall out Raticate if it lacks Swords Dance. Common Pokemon that are able to withstand a Sucker Punch, such as Choice Scarf Primeape and Gurdurr, can easily revenge kill Raticate due to its low defenses. Preventing Raticate from switching in and getting a Guts boost by applying constant offensive pressure is a great way to stop it, as it is extremely weak without the Guts boost. However, this method will fail if Raticate is carrying Protect. Finally, if you lack defensive answers to Raticate, then it is best to capitalize on the fact that Raticate is usually put on a timer due to its status Orb, so packing entry hazards and priority users is a good way to keep it in check.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Guts": {
        "description": "<p>Raticate's decent Attack and unique Speed make it a formidable Guts user. As with several other Guts users, Facade is Raticate's most powerful STAB move, with its whopping 210 Base Power allowing Raticate to break through walls such as Alomomola and Tangela after a Swords Dance boost. Sucker Punch is Raticate's main draw over other Guts users, as it allows Raticate to bypass Choice Scarf users that other Guts users have trouble with. U-turn is used to maintain momentum against counters such as Probopass. Pursuit is the preferred option in the final slot, as it allows Raticate to checkmate Pokemon such as Haunter. However, Swords Dance is an also option, as it is Raticate's only way of boosting its Attack and allows it to clean up against weakened teams. However, Raticate is extremely frail, meaning that it can only set up a Swords Dance if it forces a switch or takes advantage of foes using Protect, such as Alomomola and Lickilicky.</p> <p>The choice between Flame Orb and Toxic Orb depends on the user. If you would like Raticate to act as a wallbreaker and stay in for longer, then Flame Orb is the better item, as it does not deal as much residual damage over time. However, if you prefer Raticate to act as a scout, switching in and out of the battle with U-turn, then Toxic Orb is the item of choice, as it deals less residual damage than Flame Orb in this situation. Crunch is a very usable option over Sucker Punch, as it allows Raticate to hit much of its Ghost-type prey reliably. However, its lack of priority makes it an inferior option overall. Reversal is an option, being Raticate's best way to hit Rock- and Steel-types. However, its unreliable damage output makes it an inferior option to the moves listed above. Taunt is an option on this set, as it cripples common walls such as Roselia and Probopass, but Raticate is too frail to use it effectively. Raticate can use Protect over either U-turn or Pursuit and Swords Dance to guarantee Guts activation, but it has little use outside of that.</p> <p>While not needed, dual screens support from Pokemon such as Gardevoir and Serperior can be useful, as it mitigates Raticate's pitiful bulk. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Golem, Roselia, and Garbodor is also recommended to increase Raticate's sweeping potential. For example, Pokemon such as Metang and Alomomola are 2HKOed by Facade after Stealth Rock and two layers of Spikes. These hazard setters also have good synergy with Raticate. Garbodor and Roselia offer resistances to Raticate's Fighting-type weakness, and Golem is able to defeat Rock- and Steel-types such as Probopass. Choice Band Sawk is another good partner to remove Rock- and Steel-types from the match.</p>"

  "Fearow": {
    "overview": "<p>In a tier with a flock of excellent Normal / Flying Pokemon, Fearow struggles to not be outclassed, especially by Braviary. Fearow's most notable niche is its to outspeed potent threats such as Haunter and Sawsbuck without a Choice Scarf and ability to hurt Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon with Drill Run. However, Braviary simply has more power and a stronger move to break through such Pokemon. Being both frail and weak to Stealth Rock also means that Fearow is easily worn down throughout the course of a match. Most unfortunate is the fact that Fearow lacks Brave Bird and has to rely on the considerably weaker Drill Peck for its Flying-type STAB move, making most of its avian competition better options overall.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf is a usable item, but Fearow has very mediocre power without any boosts. Double-Edge is a stronger STAB move, but Fearow doesn't appreciate the extra recoil. It also doesn't gain too many notable KOs, and being illegal with Sniper makes it barely worth a moveslot. Fearow can support its team with Agility and Baton Pass, but it is mediocre in this role and can't even use Baton Pass with Sniper. Tailwind can also support Fearow's team, but it doesn't last long enough to make it worth a moveslot most of the time.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Physically defensive Pokemon, such as Alomomola and Mandibuzz, easily tank any of Fearow's moves and can severely damage it due to its poor bulk. Regirock is also an excellent counter as it doesn't take too much even from Drill Run and can retaliate with its STAB moves or cripple Fearow with Thunder Wave. In fact, most Rock- and Steel-types can easily tank at least one Drill Run and retaliate unless they are 4x weak to it. Anything faster than Fearow, most notably Electric-type Pokemon such as Electabuzz, can easily revenge kill it due to its low defenses. The same poor bulk also means that any Pokemon that can take a hit from Fearow can inflict massive damage on it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>As Fearow already has decent Speed, this set focuses on powering up Fearow's average Attack to make up for the average Base Power of all its moves. Return is Fearow's most reliable STAB move, and Drill Peck provides useful coverage against Ghost- and Fighting-types. Drill Run is what differentiates Fearow from most other Normal / Flying types, as it allows Fearow to damage most Rock- and Steel-types significantly. The last move is for utility purposes, with U-turn being the more useful option to allow Fearow to scout the opposing team and escape its counters. Pursuit is more situational, but it takes advantage of Fearow's Speed to defeat Haunter whether it stays in or switches out.</p> <p>Choice Band maximizes Fearow's average power and works better with U-turn so that Fearow doesn't get worn down too much from recoil and Stealth Rock damage. However, Life Orb makes use of Fearow's overall coverage and utility, as even a Choice Band doesn't completely make up for the average Base Power of its attacks. Life Orb is not the best item to pair with U-turn simply because the recoil prevents Fearow from switching in up to five times with Stealth Rock up as its EV spread allows. Roost can be utilized with Life Orb to mitigate all the residual damage Fearow takes, but it will rarely have an opportunity to use it due to its poor bulk. Stealth Rock support from Pokemon such as Golem and Metang is required to allow Fearow to OHKO Haunter with a Choice Band Pursuit even if it do not switch out. As Fearow is quickly worn down by Stealth Rock itself, offensive pressure from Pokemon such as Choice Band Sawk and Taunt Samurott is helpful in order to prevent the opponent from setting them up easily. Teammates that are immune to Electric-type moves, such as Seismitoad and Lightningrod Zebstrika, are good partners as they prevent Fearow and its team from being taken advantage of by Volt Switch users.</p>"

  "Golbat": {
    "overview": "<p>Golbat has a lot of great qualities that make it a unique defensive threat in NU. First off, it has great bulk with Eviolite and awesome Speed for a defensive Pokemon, something few other defensive Pokemon in the tier can claim. Golbat also has a fantastic defensive typing, granting it a 4x resistance to both Fighting- and Bug-type attacks, as well as immunities to Ground-type attacks and the common Toxic. On top of that, Roost gives Golbat a form of reliable recovery to compensate for its lack of Leftovers. Unfortunately, Golbat's weaknesses to common Psychic- and Electric-type attacks are rather exploitable, and a weakness to Stealth Rock further hampers its ability to switch into attacks repeatedly. It also faces competition from Mandibuzz, as while their bulk may be comparable, Mandibuzz's immunity to Psychic-type attacks sometimes outshines Golbat's immunity to Toxic and resistance to Fighting-type attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Golbat's movepool is filled with good support moves, many of which can be useful depending on what support your team needs. Haze is a good option to eliminate stat boosts the opponent might have gained if the negative priority of Whirlwind is off-putting. Tailwind is another interesting option that can give Golbat a fast Taunt and help some slower offensive Pokemon take on the opponent's team. As sleep is such a crippling status, Hypnosis might seem like a good idea, but its unreliable accuracy generally makes it not worthwhile. Additionally, it is illegal with Brave Bird, and even if the accuracy is not a huge concern, missing out on Golbat's greatest offensive option is. Pursuit could be used as well, but its main targets--Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon--will usually stay in against Golbat, making U-turn a superior option in most cases. You might also be considering a specially defensive set, as Golbat's Special Defense is slightly higher than its Defense. However, Golbat's weaknesses to common Psychic-, Electric-, and Ice-type attacks, all of which are typically specially based, make this set inferior. Finally, a Nasty Plot set could be viable, especially since Golbat has great special coverage with moves such as Sludge Bomb, Air Slash, Giga Drain, and Heat Wave, but due to Golbat's low Special Attack, such a set would rely on getting multiple boosts before it could really hit hard.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Trying to take on Golbat can be difficult, especially if it is running Super Fang. Plenty of Pokemon can beat it, but few would want to take half of their health or a Toxic in order to do so. Still, while Golbat might be a very sturdy physical wall, it can be taken down by exploiting its weaknesses. Psychic-types take on Golbat very well, as it cannot use Roost to negate this weakness before they attack. In particular, Jynx has both Psychic- and Ice-type STABs to hit Golbat for super effective damage, and Duosion doesn't mind taking a Toxic thanks to Magic Guard. Musharna can also take on Golbat well, as it can hit it hard with Psychic and use Moonlight and Heal Bell to recover from whatever Golbat uses against it. Faster Electric-type Pokemon also handle Golbat fairly well. Rotom-A and Raichu can both hit it hard with their Electric-type STABs, and Electrode can even outspeed Golbat and Taunt it before it gets the chance to use Roost or Toxic. SubRoost Articuno can avoid Toxic from Golbat and hit it hard with Ice Beam, while Choice Specs Glaceon can muscle past it with repeated powerful Ice Beams. Piloswine can use its Ice-type STAB or Earthquake against Golbat, depending on whether you predict it will Roost. Similarly, Golem can beat Golbat with a combination of Rock Blast on the turns it does not Roost and Earthquake on the turns it does. Finally, Haunter is immune to both Super Fang and Toxic, and it can even use Substitute and Disable to force Golbat out once it has used Brave Bird. Even if your team packs none of these ways of handling Golbat, its Stealth Rock weakness and lack of passive recovery hamper it tremendously, so keeping up offensive pressure and never giving it a chance to Roost are other ways of dealing with it in a pinch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Golbat is best played as a fast physical wall and stallbreaker. When used in this role, Golbat matches up well against offensive and defensive teams alike, as it is able to wall many offensive threats and Taunt defensive ones. As such, Taunt is the most important move on the set. Without it, Golbat can be used as setup fodder by a variety of threats that do not fear anything else on the set. Roost is used for reliable recovery, which helps sustain Golbat throughout the match and gives it the ability to switch into offensive threats multiple times. Toxic is used as a way to wear down and beat many bulky walls, and it comes with the added benefit of crippling many setup sweepers before they use Substitute. However, Super Fang is still a viable alternative that can deal massive damage to defensive Pokemon, softening them up for a teammate to sweep later on. Finally, Brave Bird is used as a reliable STAB move to keep Golbat from being Taunt bait itself and helps it handle Fighting-type reliably.</p> <p>The Speed EVs for this set are used to outspeed Timid Gorebyss before a Shell Smash so that Golbat can Taunt it or use Toxic to prevent a sweep. Inner Focus is the chosen ability, as it helps Golbat against certain Pokemon, such as Fake Out Kangaskhan, and Infiltrator is generally useless for a defensive Pokemon. There are also many other moves that Golbat could use effectively depending on your team's needs; Knock Off, U-turn, and Whirlwind are all great examples.</p> <p>As a weakness to Stealth Rock is often such a bother for a defensive Pokemon, Golbat really appreciates team support to handle it. A Rapid Spin user can be paired with Golbat for this purpose if you have room for it. Wartortle is the most reliable defensive Rapid Spin user; it can use Foresight and Rapid Spin against Ghost-types, can take on Ice-type attacks well, and has a good matchup against Rock-type Pokemon. Seismitoad and Metang also synergize well with Golbat. Seismitoad can take on Rock- and Electric-type attacks aimed at Golbat, while Metang can do the same for Ice-, Rock-, and Psychic-type attacks. Meanwhile, Golbat can take on Grass-type attacks for Seismitoad and Ground-type attacks for Metang. Skuntank also pairs well with Golbat, as it can remove the Psychic-type Pokemon that threaten Golbat without compounding weaknesses thanks to their immunities. Finally, Golbat can form a good defensive core with both Audino and Lickilicky, as each can provide Heal Bell support to handle bothersome burns for Golbat while it can take on the Fighting-type Pokemon that threaten them.</p>"

  "Parasect": {
    "overview": "<p>Parasect is sadly just okay in the NU tier. It's slow, not too bulky, and its typing leaves it vulnerable to many common attacking types. However, being a Bug / Grass Pokemon with Dry Skin, Parasect does have the ability to switch into some common threats, such as Golurk and bulky Water-types. The main reason Parasect should ever be used, though, is its access to Spore, one of the greatest support moves available. With it, Parasect can potentially support its team to victory.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute could work on Parasect, as it could form a Spore and SubSeed combination, but its lack of Speed and its frailty negate all of Substitute's advantages. Parasect's frailty, lack of Speed, lack of power, and unfortunate typing also stop it from attempting a Choice Band, Swords Dance, or Agility set, as it is too easily knocked out. Parasect's choice of coverage moves is also quite limited, as it is restrained to Aerial Ace, Shadow Claw, Brick Break, Bullet Seed, and Knock Off. One set that could work on Parasect is a dual screen set, as Spore and Leech Seed could give it many opportunities to set up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Sap Sipper Miltank and Insomnia Magmar are two perfect counters to Parasect, as they are immune to Spore and can threaten it out. While Spore limits the number of rock-solid answers to Parasect, once one Pokemon is put to sleep, many Pokemon can switch in and severely hurt or KO Parasect, such as Regice and Charizard. Also, Grass-types who don't mind X-Scissor, such as Tangela and Vileplume, can switch in after a Pokemon is put to sleep and stop Parasect's Leech Seed shenanigans. Flying- and Fire-types easily annihilate it, and most Pokemon with a Lum Berry or Substitute can walk all over Parasect.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Parasect's main job is to put an enemy Pokemon to sleep with Spore. That way, a partner sweeper has an easier time setting up. Leech Seed helps because it grants Parasect and its teammates healing opportunities. Seed Bomb hits the Pokemon Parasect can switch in on, such as Golurk, Choice Band Sawk, Support Seismitoad, and Alomomola, quite hard. X-Scissor can catch the Sap Sipper Pokemon that try to switch into Spore, such as Sawsbuck, as well as Grass-type Pokemon switching in on a predicted Leech Seed. However, Protect can also be used in that spot to scout for Pokemon with Choice items and all of the super effective attacks that Parasect attracts.</p> <p>Good examples of partners for Parasect that can set up on sleeping foes are Shell Smash Carracosta and Shift Gear Klang, both of which synergize well with Parasect. Charizard also deserves a mention as an offensive partner, as Parasect can switch in on the Water-types that Charizard brings in. Fighting-types such as Choice Band Sawk can partner with it as well, eliminating Rock-types that can hurt it. Defensively, Rock- and Steel-types, such as Regirock and Metang, are the best partners, as they can handle all of Parasect's weaknesses. To additionally support these partners, Aromatherapy is an option on Parasect, as most clerics, such as Audino and Lickilicky, have a Fighting-type weakness while Parasect does not, so it might fit on a team better.</p>"

  "Persian": {
    "overview": "<p>Persian is one of the many cats of NU, but access to Fake Out, U-turn, and amazing Speed makes it a decent scout and gives Persian its niche. While Liepard generally outclasses Persian as a scout due to Prankster, Persian has Technician to boost the power of its weaker moves such as Fake Out and Bite. However, other than its high Speed, Persian's stats are mediocre, and its moves still lack power even after a Technician boost. Generally, Persian is decent at best and struggles to carve much of a niche for itself outside of scouting.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Persian has a few other options, but it lacks the stats to effectively pull off much outside of its scout set. With a set of Nasty Plot / Swift / Water Pulse / Petal Dance or Thunderbolt, Persian can make a decent special sweeper, but it won't find many opportunities to set up due to its frailty. Aerial Ace can be used over Bite for coverage against Fighting-types such as Sawk and Primeape, but leaves Persian struggling against Ghost-types. Seed Bomb can also be used over Bite as it hits Rock-types that normally resist Persian's moves hard while still dealing decent damage to Golurk. Knock Off can be used over Taunt or Bite to cripple Choice item and Eviolite users. Covet, which is boosted by Technician, can be used in combination with Switcheroo and a Normal Gem to steal an item from a foe and cripple something else with the stolen item, but is much less reliable than the scout set. Feint can be used as another STAB priority move over Bite / Taunt as it packs +2 priority, but it's much weaker, offers no additional coverage, and mostly unnecessary considering Persian's high Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>If Persian lacks Bite, any Ghost-type walls it entirely, only having to be careful with U-turn bringing in a check or counter. Even if Persian does have Bite, Misdreavus is only 3HKOed by it and can threaten Persian with a burn from Will-O-Wisp if it decides to stay in. Considering Persian is so frail, priority of any sort usually spells doom for it, especially from Gurdurr, which takes almost nothing from Fake Out and Return and can OHKO after Stealth Rock with Mach Punch. Steel-types such as Probopass, Bastiodon, and Metang take almost nothing from any of Persian's attacks and can set up Stealth Rock on sets that lack Taunt. Pretty much any physically defensive wall can take on Persian, only fearing Taunt. Kangaskhan can threaten Persian with Fake Out as long as it comes in after Persian. On sets lacking Taunt, Carracosta can set up Shell Smash and proceed to threaten Persian's team.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Scout": {
        "description": "<p>This set aims to scout your opponent's team while maintaining offensive momentum. Fake Out always causes a flinch and packs decent power when boosted by Technician. U-turn keeps up momentum by bringing in an appropriate check or counter to whatever is out on the field. Taunt prevents the target from using non-attacking moves, which shuts down walls such as Alomomola and also prevents entry hazards, a great plus because of Persian's tendency to switch. Bite can be used instead of Taunt as it allows Persian to hurt Ghost-types, packing decent power with Technician and a good chance to cause a flinch. Keep in mind, however, that pairing Persian with a Ghost-type check handles most Ghost-types well enough, meaning that Bite is often unnecessary. Return is used as a strong STAB attack that can finish off any weakened opponents.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is used to allow Persian to outspeed max Speed Scolipede and Serperior. A Life Orb is used to further improve Persian's damage output, but a Silk Scarf can be used instead to avoid stacking recoil with entry hazard damage. Hypnosis can be used over Taunt or Bite to put foes to sleep, but with only 60% accuracy, it's not a very reliable move.</p> <p>This set fits on more offensive teams by giving them Taunt support and scouting for items and movesets with Fake Out and U-turn. Defensively, anything that can switch in on strong attacks aimed at Persian after it U-turns makes for a great partners. Pivot Musharna can sponge most physical attacks aimed at Persian, namely Fighting-type attacks, and then either set up with Calm Mind or Baton Pass out to something else if it causes a switch. Choice Scarf Braviary and Sawk appreciate Persian's Fake Out support to handle threats that they can't outspeed. Pretty much any offensive Pokemon enjoys the favorable match-ups Persian can set up with U-turn, especially anything that resists or is immune to Fighting-type attacks, such as Golurk or Scolipede.</p>"

  "Golduck": {
    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written around the time that BW was considered the main generation. The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW NU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>Golduck is a textbook case of a good Pokemon that is simply outclassed in most ways by other similar Pokemon; in this case, Samurott and several other Water-types. Golduck has all-around usable stats, a relatively wide movepool, and a couple of decent abilities to complement them. Its main claim to fame is its ability to use Calm Mind effectively thanks to its decent Speed and bulk, something rare among Water-types in NU. Cloud Nine is the ability that makes Golduck unique among Water-types, as it makes Golduck both a check to opposing weather sweepers and one of the only offensive Water-types that isn't hindered if used on a sun team. All this being said, it is difficult to ignore the fact that Golduck's power and Speed are only average when compared to many other Water-types in NU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Psyshock is a good option, as it allows Golduck to hit Mantine, Roselia, and other specially bulky Pokemon hard, but the difference in power is rarely relevant if it isn't hitting the opponent super effectively. Golduck can use both Choice Specs and Choice Scarf sets decently well with its wide range of offensive options and decent power and Speed, but Simipour is a stronger and faster option for the most part unless you are facing a weather team. Focus Blast and Hidden Power Grass are moves to supplement the coverage of Choice item sets alongside Hydro Pump and Ice Beam, but they aren't that useful on its other sets. An all-out attacking Life Orb set is perfectly viable, but it lacks power in comparison to other similar Pokemon such as Samurott and Simipour. A Life Orb 3 attacks set with either Calm Mind or Encore is also viable, but Simipour and Gorebyss can boost their Special Attack faster in the former's case, and Golduck doesn't have quite enough Speed to use the latter as effectively as it would need to. Hone Claws and physical attacks from Golduck's decent physical movepool are a possibility, but there are far better physical Water-types such as Samurott, Floatzel, and Carracosta. Golduck can easily make use of its Swift Swim ability, but its power and coverage are average in comparison with other Swift Swim sweepers such as Ludicolo, Gorebyss, Seismitoad, and even Mantine. Golduck can make use of a Substitute and Disable set, but Golduck simply lacks the resistances and immunities needed to really get the most out of it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Toxic Spikes cripples Golduck and prevents it from boosting many times, and Golduck can't avoid them by setting up a Substitute. Status in general cripples Golduck immensely, but it needs to hit Golduck before it can set up a Substitute. Regice can wall Golduck unless it boosts up to +6 and can threaten Golduck with Thunderbolt. Defensive Mantine can wall Golduck unless it runs Ice Beam, but Mantine can't do much back and is easily set up on. While very few other Pokemon can safely counter Golduck, many Pokemon can check it easily as long as Golduck hasn't received too many boosts and isn't behind a Substitute. Jynx is a good offensive check to variants not carrying Signal Beam, as it is immune to Surf and won't take much from Ice Beam. If Golduck is not behind a Substitute, offensive Grass- and Electric-types can threaten Golduck, especially on the physical side. Just about all neutral physical attacks can break Golduck's Substitute, which can help prevent it from setting up too many Calm Minds. Finally, Shedinja walls Golduck to no end.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Golduck's usable bulk and Speed to give it a niche among the bounty of Water-types in the tier. Calm Mind is the main move of this set, as it not only improves Golduck's mediocre Special Attack but also provides the special bulk needed to withstand even some super effective moves long enough to retaliate. Substitute is also an important move to give Golduck a defense against the status conditions that cripple it, and it creates a buffer against attacks. It is notable that this combination also allows Golduck to use Calm Mind multiple times against common defensive opponents that cannot break its Substitute with a single attack, such as Alomomola and Metang. Surf is the most reliable STAB move Golduck has in terms of power, accuracy, and PP. Signal Beam is the preferred coverage move, as it hits Ludicolo the hardest out of all of Golduck's moves and also is able to damage other Water-types. Ice Beam is also viable, as it hits most Grass-types much harder and still does a decent amount of damage to Ludicolo and Mantine, but it forces Golduck to become reliant on boosted Surfs to hurt most other Water-types.</p> <p>The Speed EVs allow Golduck to outspeed everything up to neutral base 70 Speed Pokemon, such as Ludicolo and Samurott, and set up Calm Mind before they can attack. The remaining EVs are tailored to defeat Modest Ludicolo if it tries to switch in on Golduck as it uses Calm Mind, as they allow Golduck to then outspeed, set up another Calm Mind, take only 42.28% maximum damage from Giga Drain, and at worst 2HKO with Signal Beam before Ludicolo can do the same. A more offensive EV spread with max Special Attack and Speed is viable, but you lose out on the ability to take super effective moves from Samurott and Regice. Leftovers is the only choice in item because it continually provides Golduck with HP in order to continue making Substitutes, which is more important than an item that enhances Golduck's offensive power. Cloud Nine is the preferred ability because it disables every form of weather and allows Golduck to function normally against sun teams; in comparison, Swift Swim is only useful against opposing rain teams and does not remove the boosts the rain provides to the opposing team. Encore is a decent option to use instead of Substitute, but having a defense against status is generally more useful than locking your opponent into a move. Scald is also a possible option to use instead of Surf, as the difference in power is less notable with the more boosts Golduck receives, and the burn chance is greatly appreciated against opponents that Golduck cannot safely set up Calm Minds against. Still, Golduck prefers its opponents to be Toxic poisoned, and the burn chance clashes with this.</p> <p>Toxic Spikes support from Pokemon such as Scolipede and Roselia is very useful in order to allow Golduck to wear down many of its checks and counters, including Regice, Grumpig, fast physically offensive Grass-types such as Leafeon, and Electric-types such as Electabuzz. Most of the setters can also remove opposing Toxic Spikes from your field, which greatly hinder Golduck's sweeping capabilities otherwise. Scolipede also provides an offensive check to most Grass- and Psychic-types, while Roselia and other Grass-types can handle the Water-types that resist Golduck's Water STAB. Fire-types, such as Charizard and Flareon, are good teammates as well, as they can threaten Grass-types that Golduck has trouble against and appreciate its ability to set up on many Water- and Rock-types. Flareon also provides Wish support, as does Audino, which partially makes up for Golduck's lack of recovery outside of Leftovers. A reliable switch-in to Electric-type attacks is also invaluable to Golduck, making Ground-types such as Seismitoad, Golem, and Piloswine great options for teammates. Other possible teammates include Normal- and Flying-types, such as Swellow and Kangaskhan, which are useful to lure out physically defensive Pokemon such as Alomomola and Metang for Golduck to set up on.</p>"

  "Primeape": {
    "overview": "<p>Meet Primeape, a Pokemon which was late to arrive to the NU tier, yet has still already begun to leave an impact on the tier. While it may not have quite the same power that Sawk has or the same bulk that Gurdurr has, Primeape still stands out against its competition. There are many reasons for this, but the most notable one is its Speed. Primeape is the fastest Fighting-type Pokemon in NU with base 95 Speed, a solid Speed for NU. Additionally, with access to U-turn and a resistance to Stealth Rock, Primeape is one of the best VoltTurn users available. It can also utilize a few support moves, such as Encore and Taunt. One of the only areas where Primeape struggles to perform is facing Ghost-types. Misdreavus is a prime example of a bulky Ghost-type Pokemon that Primeape prefers to avoid. Its bulk is also lacking; this makes it fear priority moves and faster Choice Scarf users.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Primeape has loads of other options available to it, but many of them are only useful in very niche situations. One thing that can be run on either set is Toxic, as it provides a way to handle bulky physical walls that Primeape would be otherwise unable to break. U-turn is usually Primeape's way of doing this, but Toxic is a more proactive solution. Earthquake can also be used over another coverage move to hit Poison-types, such as Garbodor, but its coverage is otherwise fairly redundant. Primeape also has a solid special movepool with moves such as Overheat and Thunderbolt which can hit physical walls on their weaker Special Defense, but this is not a very viable strategy, as it uses Primeape's poor base 60 Special Attack. Final Gambit could be used, but it's a waste of potential. Primeape could be scouting or hitting hard with Close Combat instead of sacrificing itself, and with Primeape's low base 65 HP, it can't even take out the most common switch-ins. A set with Substitute and Focus Punch also shows potential, though it relies quite a bit on Encore in order to succeed, and the set is still walled by the same Pokemon that wall the above sets. Primeape can also attempt to run a set with Endure and Reversal while holding a Salac Berry. However, this set would require some major support to succeed, but once Ghost-types and priority users are eliminated, its power is immense. A set that does allow Primeape to beat some of its typical checks and counters is one that utilizes Substitute and Endeavor. Due to Primeape's fantastic Speed, this set can work really well, but Primeape misses out on either coverage or the ability to scout. Finally, either set can run Rain Dance or Sunny Day on niche support for weather based teams. Doing so often sacrifices Primeape, allowing a free switch into a weather sweeper.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Perhaps the greatest thing about Primeape is that a fast U-turn significantly hinders the ability to counter it. One way to punish Primeape for constantly using U-turn to switch in and out is through the use of Spikes. Another great way of doing this is with Rocky Helmet Garbodor, as it takes minimal damage from U-turn and inflicts major damage to Primeape throughout the course of the battle with both Rocky Helmet and Aftermath. Aside from its constant switching, Alomomola and Tangela both take minimal damage from all of Primeape's attacks and can recover health back with Regenerator. Because Primeape is not the strongest Pokemon, even Regirock can take a Close Combat in a pinch. Bulky Ghost-types, such as Golurk and Misdreavus, also give it troubles. Golurk's biggest fear is Ice Punch, and while it may not want to switch in, it can take one and retaliate with a powerful STAB Earthquake. Meanwhile, Misdreavus serves as a full counter to it; even Punishment is a 4HKO at best, and Misdreavus can just burn Primeape. Finally, faster Choice Scarf wielders and those that use priority moves can strike Primeape and knock it out before it gets the chance to attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Primeape's most popular set in NU is its Choice Scarf set, and it is undoubtedly its best one. Primeape's largest selling point is its Speed stat which is showcased in this set. With a Choice Scarf equipped, Primeape hits an impressive 475 Speed, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted tier. Primeape is also one of the fastest Choice Scarf users in NU. The only common Choice Scarf users with which it ties in Speed is Haunter, and some of the only ones to beat it include Charizard, Tauros, and Zebstrika. Close Combat is chosen for the most powerful and reliable STAB in Primeape's movepool. U-turn is one of Primeape's greatest tools, allowing it to force switches to help weaken foes and scout out what the opponent wants to do without risking being KOed. Finally, Primeape rounds out its coverage with Ice Punch and Stone Edge. Stone Edge hits the Flying- and Bug-types that resist Close Combat, while Ice Punch is a more reliable option against Flying-types due to its perfect accuracy.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is used on this set for multiple purposes, though the main reason to is to outspeed slower Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Sawk, Pinsir, and Rotom-A, who would otherwise outspeed it with an Adamant nature. It also allows Primeape to Speed tie with other Primeape and Haunter. Vital Spirit is the best ability for the set, even though most of the Pokemon in the tier that would try to use a sleep-inducing move against it can either knock it out or completely wall it. Despite this, Anger Point relies on getting hit by a critical hit, which is an unreliable tactic, especially since Primeape is so frail. Defiant is a great ability in tiers where Intimidate users are more common, but the ability is rare in NU, making this ability practically useless. You may also want to use Punishment on this set, but it is pitifully weak, even after opposing Pokemon have a gathered some stat boosts.</p> <p>Since Primeape is able to force switches while it is scouting, it appreciates support from Pokemon who can set up entry hazards. For this reason, Garbodor is a great partner because it can reliably set up Spikes. When using either of these Pokemon alongside Primeape, be wary of the compounded Psychic-type weakness. Metang also gets a mention as a Stealth Rock user, but it's also a fantastic partner for taking the Psychic- and Flying-type attacks targeted at Primeape. Since Primeape struggles to defeat Ghost-type Pokemon, Skuntank's support is greatly appreciated, as it is able to trap Ghost-types with Pursuit. Finally, other VoltTurn Pokemon are great partners, as they allow your team to keep up initiative and force switches.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>When equipped with a Choice Band, Primeape can make up for its middling power while still fully utilizing its great Speed. Primeape can also separate itself from Sawk with its access to U-turn, which allows Primeape to switch out against the Ghost- and Psychic-types that can wall it and bring in a partner to Pursuit trap them. Close Combat is used for a high Base Power STAB move that Primeape can spam late in the game. U-turn is used to scout the opponent's team before Primeape can mindlessly spam Close Combat, while also allowing it to switch out of its checks and counters and wear them down throughout the match. Finally, Ice Punch and Stone Edge are both used for coverage moves. The former hits Flying- and Grass-type Pokemon, such as Altaria, Tangela, and Vileplume, that either resist Primeape's STAB or take little from it. The latter can also hit Flying-type Pokemon and gives Primeape coverage against Bug-types.</p> <p>Vital Spirit is used so Primeape can switch into Sleep Powder from Grass-types, then use U-turn to either deal good damage to them or scout out a potential switch. Primeape can also use Earthquake for coverage against Poison-types or Punishment to deal good damage against opposing setup sweepers, but these moves are typically less useful than Ice Punch and Stone Edge.</p> <p>Primeape loves having Pursuit support to take out the Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon that wall it, making Skuntank and Sneasel ideal partners. Even with a Choice Band, Primeape lacks the power of heavy hitters such as Sawk. With this in mind, powerful wallbreakers are very useful to give Primeape an easier time later on in the match. Charizard, Eelektross, and Samurott are great to fill this role. Another way to help Primeape throughout the match is to set up hazards against the opponent. Hazards are so greatly appreciated because of Primeape's ability to force switches with U-turn and wear down its checks and counters. Garbodor is an excellent Spikes setter and Metang can cover Primeape's Psychic- and Flying-type weaknesses and use Stealth Rock. Finally, other users of U-turn and Volt Switch are great partners for Primeape, as they can keep up offensive momentum throughout the match. Swellow, Probopass, and Zebstrika are the best examples of this.</p>"
      },
      "Encore": {
        "description": "<p>This set has many purposes, but one of the main reasons to use it is for its ability to bluff a Choice Scarf. Since the vast majority of Primeape sets are going to be running a Choice item, this set is able to lure in Pokemon that think they would be safe, only to be hit with an untimely Close Combat. Aside from this, Encore is easily one of the greatest support moves in the game, locking the opposing Pokemon into its last used move for three turns. Using Encore, you can lock Pokemon into set-up moves, Stealth Rock, Substitute, and more, basically giving you a chance to ruin the opponent's initiative and bring it back to your side. This makes U-turn a great choice on this set, since oftentimes your opponent will want to switch after being locked into a move. Finally, Punishment and Ice Punch are both great moves on this set. Ice Punch is more consistently reliable, but with Encore, slower Pokemon can be locked into boosting moves and subsequently hit for great damage with Punishment.</p> <p>The choice in items is up to you. Both items are effective since they both bluff a Choice Scarf, but generally, Fist Plate is better than Expert Belt, as a neutral Close Combat hits harder than a super effective Ice Punch. It is important to note that this set is best played by bluffing a Choice item as long as possible, and you should only reveal that you are not locked into a move at the most optimal time. The surprise factor is one of the reasons why this set can be so successful.</p> <p>Jolly is once again the preferred nature for this set because base 95 Speed is still fantastic. The added power is less noticeable than the added Speed. Vital Spirit is also still its best ability for the same reasons found in the Choice Scarf set, although this set runs Defiant better than the Scarf set due to the liberty to switch up moves. Even so, Vital Spirit is still the better option. A set with Taunt over Encore could be interesting as well, but it would primarily be used to prevent entry hazards from being placed, a job that Sawk does better due to its slightly superior bulk, greater power, and Mold Breaker. Even more so than the Scarf set, this set loves entry hazards on the opponent's side. Encore forces a lot of switches, so Spikes and Stealth Rock support is strongly recommended. Because of its frailty, Primeape hates priority, so you should pack something to take priority moves, such as Fake Out, Mach Punch, Quick Attack, and Aqua Jet. Lastly, Ghost-types are still just as big of a problem for this Fighting-type as they are most, so support from Skuntank to remove Ghost-types is once again recommended.</p>"

  "Kadabra": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Kadabra is an NFE, it is one of the strongest special attackers in the tier. However, unlike most other heavy hitting special attackers, Kadabra is also one of the faster Pokemon in the tier, outspeeding threats such as Sawsbuck and Charizard. In addition, it has the amazing ability Magic Guard, meaning that it cannot be worn down by Life Orb damage or get stalled out by status. Despite this, Kadabra's main flaw is apparent; while it has a good offensive potential, its defenses are some of the game's worst, and it will almost never survive a physical attack, even if it resists the move. However, if you can work around its frailty, Kadabra can be a useful asset to your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Kadabra has a boosting move in Calm Mind, which makes it hit quite a bit harder, but because Kadabra is so frail, it is pretty hard to set up. Hidden Power Fighting and Shadow Ball can be used over Hidden Power Ground and Signal Beam as they provide similar coverage, but in exchange for hitting things like Shedinja, Swoobat, and Scraggy harder; however, Kadabra struggles quite a bit against Skuntank, which is far more common, usually necessitating the need for Hidden Power Ground. Psyshock can be used over Psychic to hit special walls harder, but generally Kadabra appreciates the extra power Psychic has. Charge Beam is similar to Calm Mind, but it allows Kadabra to boost and attack at the same time. Recover can heal Kadabra, but while it is usually a good move, Kadabra will usually take over 50% damage from any attack anyway. Hidden Power Ice wrecks Torterra and Altaria, but outside of that it has little utility. Finally, Trick can pull off some interesting strategies, such as tricking a Flame Orb for a pseudo Will-O-Wisp, or cripple a wall with a Choice Scarf.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Kadabra may look simple to counter at first, but when its Focus Sash is intact, it can be a bit hard to defeat it as it can always take a hit and retaliate in this case. Regice stands out as a counter, as it can take hits from Kadabra all day and 2HKO it with Ice Beam. Lickilicky is only 3HKOed by a Life Orb-boosted Psychic, Kadabra's most powerful option against it, and Lickilicky can 2HKO it at worst. Mandibuzz is 4HKOed at best by Kadabra's Life Orb Signal Beam and can take it out with Foul Play and Roost away the majority of the damage it takes. Piloswine can take two Psychics, and its access to Icicle Spear and Ice Shard makes Kadabra struggle against it. While uncommon, Scraggy takes very little damage from any of Kadabra's moves, and can set up against it. Skuntank needs to watch out Hidden Power Ground, which 2HKOes it, but Skuntank can OHKO Kadabra with Sucker Punch before it can attack or catch it with Pursuit if it switches out. Altaria and Regirock have good special bulk to take hits and can 2HKO Kadabra with their own STAB moves. Golem can use Rock Blast to break through Kadabra's Focus Sash like Piloswine or can Sucker Punch it, but it gets 2HKOed by Psychic. Cacturne can also OHKO with Sucker Punch and switch into Psychic, but if Kadabra's Focus Sash is intact, it will be unable to take a Signal Beam. It doesn't have to be Sucker Punch to OHKO it once the Focus Sash is broken, as Zangoose can OHKO it with Quick Attack with the Toxic Boost boost almost all the time, and a Choice Scarf Pokemon like Braviary will have an easy time OHKOing it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Kadabra's best and only viable set comes in the form of a somewhat straightforward special attacker, with the goal of outspeeding opponents and hitting them hard. Thanks to Magic Guard, it cannot be worn down by poison, burn, Leech Seed, Life Orb recoil, or entry hazards, giving it a huge advantage over its competition. It also is faster than almost any special attacker in the tier, making it one of the few Pokemon in the tier with a combination of power and Speed. Psychic is the main STAB, and it does a hefty amount of damage to the common Fighting- and Poison-types that inhabit the tier. Signal Beam has good coverage with Psychic-type moves, hitting opposing Psychic- and Dark-type Pokemon for super effective damage. Hidden Power Ground hits Steel-type Pokemon such as Bastiodon hard, and Skuntank is also 2HKOed by it. These three moves have near provide perfect coverage in the NU tier hitting everything other than Shedinja, which is very uncommon.</p> <p>The last move depends on the item choice. Encore is useful on Kadabra for many reasons. If it can Encore a Sucker Punch (a common move Kadabra gets targeted by), it can get out for free and enable one of your Pokemon to set up. Encore is also useful because Kadabra is so fast it can make a Pokemon continually use a set-up move (provided it doesn't have priority) or a status move. You should use Encore if you have a Focus Sash. However, despite the fact that nearly any move will break Kadabra's Substitute, even Alomomola's Scald, it protects Kadabra from getting OHKOed by everything that touches it, and it can be set up when an opponent flees from Kadabra's Psychic STAB. This should be used with a Life Orb, because a Substitute prevents Kadabra from being at full HP, making Focus Sash useless.</p> <p>A Focus Sash is preferred because Magic Guard means that entry hazards cannot break Kadabra's Focus Sash, and Kadabra will usually need the item's effect to survive any hit, considering how easy it is to OHKO. A Focus Sash also makes Kadabra a decent last-ditch revenge killer, because it cannot be KOed no matter how many boosts the opponent has. However, a Life Orb is also a good option for Kadabra, as Magic Guard means that it won't take damage from the item, giving it essentially a free boost. It is also not very powerful without a Life Orb, meaning frail Pokemon such as Zangoose can take a hit and then OHKO it. Also, if you are considering using Kadabra as a Fighting-type resist, note that Kadabra's frailty means that this is not a good idea. In fact, Gurdurr can KO it with a combination of Drain Punch and Mach Punch.</p> <p>Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Sawk are good partners for a number of reasons. Dark-types are generally dangerous for Kadabra, as the most common ones, Skuntank and Cacturne, can KO Kadabra with Sucker Punch before it can move or Pursuit it if it tries to switch out if it has taken prior damage or predicts incorrectly. Fighting-types resist these very dangerous Pokemon's STABs and can hit them hard in return. Fighting-types also can destroy special walls like Regice and Lickilicky, both of which Kadabra has no chance of getting past. While Kadabra is fast, there are still a few Pokemon that have a higher base Speed, such as Swellow, Electrode, Zebstrika, Ninjask, and Swoobat. Because most of these Pokemon are Electric-types or are weak to Rock-type moves, Golem is a good teammate, as its typing allows it to OHKO them with its STABs. As Kadabra is very hard to switch in, slow users of U-turn or Volt Switch, such as Ampharos, can be useful to allow Kadabra to switch in without having to take a hit.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>While not a top-tier Pokemon, access to Rapid Spin, Toxic Spikes, and reasonable bulk gives Tentacool a niche in NU. Stall teams really enjoy its typing and Special Defense because Tentacool counters Ludicolo and Charizard, two Pokemon that can easily wreck stall teams. In addition, Tentacool's vast movepool has many viable options to choose from. However, lack of reliable recovery and a pitiful Defense stat really hinder its performance in battle. Its bad offenses also make it easy setup fodder to most Pokemon and its need for extensive team support is a hindrance.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Protect can be used for scouting and racking up Toxic damage, but Tentacool has trouble fitting it into a moveslot. Giga Drain and Ice Beam are good coverage moves, but they too cannot easily be used by Tentacool. Other moves that Tentacool has access to but simply cannot wield effectively are Mirror Coat, Haze, Barrier, and Confuse Ray. Lastly, Tentacool can use RestTalk for recovery, but it cannot make the other two moveslots effective alone.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Most physical attackers can easily break through Tentacool; even Sawk's resisted Close Combat is near a KO. Tentacool stands no chance against a STAB Earthquake. Taunt users, such as Mandibuzz and Misdreavus, prevent Tentacool from supporting its team with Toxic Spikes. Misdreavus also spinblocks, and Tentacool fails to get past most other Ghost-types as well. Substitute in general is a great counter to Tentacool, as it cannot break though most Substitutes. Grounded Poison-types are also great for removing Toxic Spikes, which really dampers Tentacool's team's walling abilities. Electric-types scare Tentacool out and can gain momentum for their team with Volt Switch.</p>",
    "sets": {

        "description": "<p>Rapid Spin is a move in short supply that Tenacool can wield. Stall teams are prone to entry hazards, so their removal benefits the team greatly. Toxic Spikes is outstanding as well, severely crippling any opposing team without a Rapid Spin user or grounded Poison-type. Scald is a good STAB move that also has the opportunity to burn physical attackers switching in to hurt Tentacool. However, Sludge Bomb can be used instead as a stronger STAB attack, and it allows Tentacool to take care of Ludicolo faster. Toxic is the last move to allow Tentacool to severely cripple Pokemon with Levitate or a Flying typing and is more reliable if the opposing team has a grounded Poison-type.</p> <p>The 80 Defense EVs are there primarily so Tentacool can survive defensive Seismitoad's Earthquake. Knock Off is a cool option for Tentacool as it can remove items from the opposing team's wallbreakers and remove Leftovers from walls trying to beat Tentacool's team. Mandibuzz is a great defensive partner for Tentacool as it can take on most of the physical attackers trying to beat Tentacool and is immune to two of Tentacool's weaknesses. Misdreavus also works well as a physical wall because it can spinblock. Many Pokemon easily set up on Tentacool, so phazers such as Bastiodon are good at forcing them out and Wish + Protect users such as Audino are helpful at Toxic stalling them out. Audino also passes Wishes to Tentacool, which is mandatory to keep it alive.</p>"

  "Rapidash": {
    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written around the time that BW was considered the main generation. The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW NU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>As the fastest Fire-type in the Neverused tier, Rapidash has its advantages. It has a strong STAB in Flare Blitz, though its power is average otherwise. Rapidash also has a decent movepool, including a reliable recovery move to mitigate recoil and entry hazard damage. Unfortunately, Rapidash is frail and doesn't find much opportunity to use non-attacking moves. Without a way to notably enhance its average attack power, it struggles to differentiate itself from its Fire-type brethren.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A mixed Sunny Day set with Solar Beam allows Rapidash to break through a few of its normal counters, but Rapidash is too frail to set up and attack. Hypnosis can cripple a counter, but the terrible accuracy makes it unreliable. Hidden Power Ice can hit Altaria extremely hard, but it isn't worth a moveslot otherwise. Will-O-Wisp can cripple physical attackers such as Regirock, but Rapidash is already lacking moveslots and prefers to attack most of the time. Likewise, Toxic can cripple Alomomola and other defensive Pokemon on the switch, but Rapidash has trouble finding room for it. Substitute is an option to block status and make Rapidash harder to revenge kill, but it doesn't want to cut into its HP any more than it does already. Rapidash can run a special attacking set with Sunny Day, Fire Blast, Solar Beam, and Hidden Power, but Charizard and Simisear are more powerful options. Choice Scarf Rapidash can be used due to its high Speed, but it lacks power. Flame Charge and Agility are the only boosting moves Rapidash has, but they do not improve its average power and there are better options to Baton Pass such boosts. Quick Attack provides priority, but is extremely weak. Finally, Rapidash can use its Flame Body ability to try and burn opponents, but it is far too frail and prefers the possible power boost from Flash Fire more.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Dragon-types such as Altaria and Dragonair wall Rapidash unless it carries Return or Hidden Power Ice. Rapidash is walled by Alomomola and physically defensive Seismitoad unless it carries Hidden Power Grass or Solar Beam. Regirock and Piloswine can check Rapidash as they can take any move from it and retaliate with their super effective STAB moves. Specially defensive Regirock can even counter the rare mixed Rapidash, as it avoids the 2HKO from Solar Beam. Gardevoir can Trace Flash Fire and tank a Wild Charge, then retaliate with Psychic. Bulkier Water-types that can tank a Wild Charge or Solar Beam, such as Samurott and Wartortle, can check Rapidash. Rapidash is frail, so anything faster with a decently powered neutral move can easily inflict a lot of damage to it, if not OHKO it completely. Swellow, Tauros, and many Choice Scarf users, such as Haunter or Primeape, can all revenge kill Rapidash. Priority from Kangaskhan and Basculin can keep Rapidash in check; be aware that Rapidash can play around Sucker Punch with Morning Sun and Baton Pass.</p>",

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set makes maximum use of Rapidash's higher Attack stat, focusing on hitting the opponent's team as hard as possible. Flare Blitz is Rapidash's most powerful STAB move and is the move that will typically be used the most. Wild Charge provides coverage against opposing Water-types as well as Charizard. Low Kick allows Rapidash to significantly damage most opposing Rock-types. Morning Sun is preferred if Rapidash is wielding a Life Orb, as it helps mitigate recoil and entry hazard damage; it can also be useful for allowing Rapidash to work around Sucker Punch users. Baton Pass is preferred when Rapidash is holding a Choice Band, as it allows it to scout the opposing switch-in or escape from a check or counter.</p> <p>Jolly is the best nature, as Rapidash prefers to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible, and it is necessary to allow Rapidash to Speed tie with threats such as Kadabra. Life Orb gives Rapidash a decent power boost while allowing it to switch moves, but as Rapidash is likely to use Flare Blitz most of the time, a Choice Band is also a good option to maximize its only average power. Hidden Power Grass is a viable option for the last move, as it allows Rapidash to hit 4x weak Pokemon such as Seismitoad and Golem harder than any of its other moves. Megahorn is a possible move to threaten Psychic-types without having to take recoil from Flare Blitz. Return is also a viable move to threaten opposing Dragon-types, but they are rare and the move doesn't help Rapidash much otherwise. Charcoal and Flame Plate are possible items to boost the power of Flare Blitz, but the lack of negative side effects does not make up for the noticeable decrease in power.</p> <p>Even with Low Kick, this set still has trouble with Rock-types. Grass-type teammates, such as Serperior and Exeggutor, can handle Rock-types, as well as Water-types, very well. Water-types, such as Gorebyss and Samurott, can also deal with Rock-types and help form a Fire / Water / Grass core. Wartortle is a notable Water-type as it can use Rapid Spin to remove the entry hazards that wear down Rapidash. Rapidash enjoys switching into Will-O-Wisps from the likes of Misdreavus and Weezing, so physical attacking teammates that lure them out are good teammates. Choice Band Sawk is a notable option, as it can also threaten most Stealth Rock users as well as Rock-types.</p>"

  "Dewgong": {
    "overview": "<p>Dewgong is overall a poor Pokemon due to its middling stats, which renders it unable to perform a given role effectively. A Water / Ice typing gives it many common weaknesses and its lack of recovery makes it unable to wall anything for extended periods of time. Additionally, Dewgong faces competition with Walrein and Lapras, as the former has Thick Fat and the latter has Perish Song. Dewgong's niche over those two Water / Ice type Pokemon is the fact that it has access to both. Being outclassed by Walrein by virtue of bulk and stalling capabilities, and having poor offensive stats overall, Dewgong struggles to find a spot on a good team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dewgong has access to great priority moves in Fake Out, Aqua Jet, and Ice Shard. However, their damage output is low and they rely on Dewgong's Attack stat, making them rather useless. Blizzard can be used for more power, but it is inaccurate and Dewgong is outclassed by Walrein as a user of it. Hydration + Rest seems like a good idea, but Dewgong is easily forced out due to its poor defensive typing and thus will rarely stay in to utilize the rain turns.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Entry hazards can easily wear down Dewgong due to its weakness to Stealth Rock and lack of reliable recovery. Furthermore, Dewgong is easily forced out, ensuring that it will take plenty of damage from entry hazards on each switch-in. Faster Grass-types such as Sawsbuck, Ludicolo, Victreebel, and Shiftry can easily OHKO Dewgong if they can switch in safely. Most Electric- and Fighting-types with decent offensive presence can easily OHKO Dewgong as well; some of these Pokemon include Electabuzz, Sawk, Ampharos, Gurdurr, and more. Additionally, Steel-types such as Metang can wall Dewgong to high heavens as they are immune to Toxic and take nothing from Dewgong's weak Surf. Finally, Taunt users, particularly Mandibuzz and Misdreavus, can temporarily halt Dewgong's usage of support moves and also cripple it with either Toxic or Will-O-Wisp, respectively.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Perish Song is Dewgong's only saving grace, as it lets Dewgong defeat common Pokemon that are not affected by Toxic, such as Duosion and Heal Bell Musharna. Toxic is an essential move which deals damage to the opponent every turn. Thick Fat grants Dewgong very useful type resistances to Fire and Ice, allowing it to take hits from powerful Fire-type attacks such as a Fire Blast from Choice Specs Charizard. However, Dewgong is hampered by its lack of reliable recovery, severely dampening its viability in the tier. Thankfully, Protect lets Dewgong gain extra Leftovers recovery, somewhat compensating for the lack of reliable recovery. It is also good for scouting and stalling out the opponent with Toxic. Ice Beam and Surf are obvious attacking moves that damage the opponent, with both getting a STAB boost. Ice Beam is is chosen as the main offensive move as it is able to hit most Poison-types hard, especially Grass / Poison Pokemon. Surf provides helpful coverage against Steel-types who are also immune to Toxic.</p> <p>Encore is a good move that can be used—it sets Dewgong apart from the rest—being able to lock the opponent into a move and provide free switch-in opportunities for teammates. Toxic Spikes support is recommended to start the stalling immediately when the opponent switches in, as opposed to having Dewgong leave itself vulnerable that turn when using Toxic. Roselia and Garbodor are great Toxic Spikes users that support Dewgong, as they both resist the Grass-type attacks that Dewgong dislikes and can also force those Grass-types out.</p> <p>Torterra is a great partner for Dewgong as it resists Rock-type moves, has access to Stealth Rock, can easily prevent Seismitoad or Golem from setting up Stealth Rock by using Bullet Seed, and is immune to Electric-type moves, thus having wonderful synergy with Dewgong. Meanwhile, Dewgong can easily handle the Ice-type attacks aimed at Torterra. Sawk is also a good partner for Dewgong as it can easily prevent Stealth Rock with Mold Breaker and beat Rock-type Pokemon for Dewgong. Rapid Spin support is vital for Dewgong to function. Torkoal is the best spinner to pair with Dewgong as it resists Grass-type moves, can spin away entry hazards and set up its own, and can beat Steel-types for Dewgong as well.</p>"

  "Muk": {
    "overview": "<p>Muk is pretty solid as far as Poison-types go, especially among the ones that can absorb Toxic Spikes. Its solid Attack and Special Defense as well as good movepool allow Muk to tango with some of the most powerful special attackers in the tier. It has a unique ability which causes its contact moves to be capable of inducing poison, which is not only great for inflicting chip damage on opponents, but it's also hilarious when your Ice Punch poisons someone. What separates Muk from other slow Poison-types is Shadow Sneak, which turns it into a good offensive check to frail threats such as Haunter. However, Muk is slow and easy to wall as its coverage moves aren't quite strong enough to get the job done against bulkier opponents, and common weaknesses in Ground and Psychic hold it back. However, Muk still holds its own well in the NU metagame, and anything that can poison you while smacking you at the same time shouldn't be taken lightly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sticky Hold is a decent option, but there aren't a lot of Trick users, much less those which can survive Muk's onslaught comfortably enough to even think about Tricking the Black Sludge onto something else; the extra poison chance is great against offensive teams. Destiny Bond is usable as it allows Muk to bring down an opponent it cannot otherwise beat, but Muk would much rather blow itself up than wait for the opponent to KO it and risk playing around Destiny Bond; it is also too slow to make use of it properly. Thunder Punch hits Alomomola harder than Poison Jab, but Poison Jab and poison damage does more damage over time and can't be passively healed off as easily, plus it's even more useless against Ground-types. Muk has some interesting special attacking options such as Giga Drain, Thunderbolt, and Flamethrower, but a low Special Attack stat makes them inferior, and even then Seviper and Weezing do this better. Dig's main purpose is to hit Poison-types, but giving them a free turn to do anything and switch out to a resist or Flying-type hardly makes this worthwhile.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Muk is a bit trickier to counter safely when you consider Poison Touch and its decent matchup against most Psychic-types. Fellow Poison-types such as Garbodor, Arbok, Weezing, Golbat, and even Skuntank can all take on Muk as it has no practical way of hurting them and Poison Touch is ineffective against them; they can proceed to beat down and / or set up all over Muk or, in Weezing's case, cripple Muk with Will-O-Wisp. Not even Curse can help Muk much against them, as they can either use Clear Smog, Taunt, or boost alongside Muk and outdamage it with Earthquake. Steel-types such as Metang, Probopass, and Bastiodon are in much the same boat due to their Poison immunity, though they have to confirm Muk's coverage move before getting comfortable. Ground-types like Seismitoad, Golurk, Torterra, and Piloswine all threaten with their STAB Ground-type attacks, though Golurk and Torterra have to watch out for Ice Punch. Rock-types such as Golem, Carracosta and Regirock do well too, taking little damage from most, if not all of Muk's attacks, though those that take longer to beat Muk are at a greater risk of Poison Touch poisoning them. Regirock and Metang aren't even affected by Memento due to Clear Body and also wall Muk, though Metang can be worn down with Fire Punch while Regirock can succumb to poison. Misdreavus takes little from Shadow Sneak and can burn Muk to cripple it, though it risks being poisoned by Poison Touch when attempting to do so. Musharna can tank non Choice Band-boosted hits and retaliate with its Psychic-type attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Touncher": {
        "description": "<p>Poison Jab is your main STAB and has a nice 30% chance to poison, while Poison Touch stacks another 30% chance. To put it into perspective, that's a 51% chance to add a free 12% damage over time effect with your main move, and 30% chance for its other attacks, which is pretty cool no matter how you look at it. Shadow Sneak is Muk's priority and despite being pretty weak, it is important to hit Haunter and Kadabra which otherwise harass or threaten Muk. Ice Punch has great coverage, hitting Ground-types such as Golurk and Flying-types such as Mandibuzz and Golbat for decent damage. On the other hand, Fire Punch nails Metang and Klang, the latter of which can use Muk to setup Shift Gear otherwise. The last move depends on what you want Muk to do: Memento helps a teammate to set up on the crippled opponent when Muk is running low on HP or has outlived its usefulness; Curse allows Muk to set up itself, using its good bulk and Toxic immunity to harass defensive teams and providing the power to break through.</p> <p>Brick Break is an option to hit Probopass and Bastiodon, as well as hit Normal-types harder. A specially defensive spread with Curse is viable, but the lack of immediate power hurts its potential. Haze is cool in the last slot to stop boosters, though Muk is a tad bit slow for that, and Memento can already function similarly. Muk works very well with Mandibuzz because it is immune to both of Muk's weaknesses and can defeat threats like Golurk, while Muk can attempt to tank attackers that would prove too much for Mandibuzz to handle, such as Ludicolo and Eelektross. Ground-types such as Golurk and Seismitoad can defeat Regirock and other Rock-types that threaten Muk, as well as hitting Poison-types that wall Muk; Golurk can also hurt bulkier Psychic-types and Ghost-types such as Musharna and Misdreavus. Sawk works well because it can take down Rock- and Steel-types that can potentially wall Muk, while Muk returns the favor by poisoning walls so that they are more susceptible to Sawk's attacks. A lot of offensive Pokemon, such as Carracosta and Kangaskhan, work well with Muk because the extra poison damage it inflicts on walls such as Piloswine and Misdreavus can be the difference getting a KO and 2HKO. On the other hand, defensive Pokemon, more specifically those with Wish such as Audino and Alomomola, can keep Muk healthy and extend its longevity, while they can take advantage of poison by stalling with Wish and Protect.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band gives Muk extra power, especially when you consider its Poison-type STAB can threaten two of the bulkiest physical walls in the tier: Tangela and Alomomola. Poison Jab is reliable STAB and has a ridiculous chance to inflict poison, but Gunk Shot can 2HKO Alomomola, especially if poison is taken into account, but at the cost of not having Poison Touch's benefit nor good accuracy. Shadow Sneak is for priority and can take out frail Psychic-types and Ghost-types such as Haunter. Ice Punch is for hitting Ground-types and bulky Flying-types, though Gunk Shot does more damage against the majority of Flying-types. Fire Punch is an option to hit Klang and Metang, especially the former which could otherwise use Muk as an easy setup opportunity. Finally, Explosion lets Muk go out with a bang when it is almost down, taking most opponents down with it.</p> <p>Brick Break can be used to hit Steel-types and Rock-types that are immune to or resist Muk's STAB, namely Bastiodon, Carracosta and Probopass, as well as hitting Piloswine for super effective damage, but otherwise Ice Punch is better to hit Ground-types, especially Golurk. Seismitoad and Golurk are good teammates to beat common Rock- and Ground-types. Charizard is a good teammate for Muk because it can beat Metang and other Steel-types and provides a safe switch-in to Ground-type attacks, while both Pokemon can weaken walls for each other. Psychic-types like Musharna and Gothorita make for decent teammates as they can take on the Poison-types that Muk cannot break, such as Garbodor and Arbok, and offer support. Physical attackers such as Tauros and Kangaskhan appreciate this set's ability to lure in and weaken Alomomola with powerful hits and poison.</p>"

  "Haunter": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite being an NFE, Haunter is a great offensive spinblocker with good offensive presence and Speed. This ties in well with its great movepool, making Haunter an unpredictable Pokemon to face. Specifically, Haunter's access to support moves such as Destiny Bond, Disable, Pain Split, Trick, and Will-O-Wisp is what makes it so threatening. While it is incredibly frail, Haunter has excellent immunities to Normal-, Fighting-, and Ground-type moves that give it opportunities to switch in safely. Unfortunately, that frailty is still Haunter's downfall, as it is terribly weak to Pursuit and common priority users. Haunter's Speed might hit a great benchmark, but there are many Pokemon that can still outspeed it; Haunter also hates risking a Speed tie because of its frailty.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Life Orb set utilizing Substitute and Pain Split is viable to allow Haunter to wear down bulkier Pokemon and heal itself in the process. A set with Substitute and Will-O-Wisp can also be used to catch physical threats such as Skuntank and Golem off guard, luring in and weakening some of its main counters. Hidden Power Fighting is a viable alternative to Hidden Power Ground, as it has perfect neutral coverage alongside Shadow Ball, but it fails to damage Skuntank and Metang as effectively. Protect is another method to scout for Pursuit users, but it doesn't provide enough utility to be worth a moveslot. Giga Drain is a possible coverage move that provides some recovery and can take down Seismitoad and Golem. Sludge Wave is slightly stronger than Sludge Bomb, but it doesn't gain any notable KOs and the lower poison chance makes it an inferior choice. Haunter can use Eviolite to enhance its poor bulk, but it is still frail and the item doesn't particularly help any of its sets. Choice Specs can enhance Haunter's power, but its STAB moves aren't great moves to be locked into without the Speed provided by Choice Scarf to make use of its utility moves. Hypnosis can be very helpful in removing one of Haunter's counters, but it is very unreliable and can only affect one Pokemon at a time.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Mandibuzz is one of the best counters to Haunter, only fearing Trick, Thunderbolt, and a possible poison from Sludge Bomb. It can then retaliate with Taunt, Whirlwind, or Foul Play, and Roost allows it to outlast Haunter most of the time. Golbat, similarly to Mandibuzz, only fears Trick and the rare Thunderbolt, and it can retaliate with Brave Bird, Taunt, or Whirlwind. If Haunter lacks Hidden Power Ground, most Steel-types can reliably wall Haunter even when they are Tricked a Choice Scarf. Munchlax walls Haunter but dislikes Trick. Skuntank is a decent check, as it threatens Haunter with its Dark-type moves, most notably Pursuit. However, many of Haunter's sets have a way to at least bother (if not cripple or defeat) Skuntank in the process. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Regice, Lickilicky, and Audino can wall Haunter, but they hate being Tricked. Specially defensive Regirock can take a couple of hits from Haunter and threaten it back with its STAB move, but it has trouble dealing with the SubDisable set, as Haunter isn't threatened by most of its other moves. Faster Pursuit users, such as Scolipede and Tauros, can trap and OHKO Haunter easily; Choice Scarf Tauros is notable because it can even outspeed and trap Choice Scarf Haunter. Pokemon with multi-hit moves, such as Piloswine and Golem, can threaten Haunter even with a Substitute up. Priority moves from threats such as Kangaskhan and Samurott can threaten Haunter despite its great Speed. Finally, any Choice Scarf user that is faster than Haunter can threaten it due to its poor bulk.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>With decent coverage and good Speed, Haunter makes for a very potent offensive Pokemon. Shadow Ball is a powerful STAB move and hits the common Psychic- and Ghost-types of the tier for super effective damage. Sludge Bomb is a slightly stronger STAB and has great neutral coverage alongside Shadow Ball. Its decent poison chance can also help Haunter wear down its counters, such as Lickilicky, Audino, and Regice, which gives them a harder time repeatedly switching in against it. Hidden Power Ground rounds out Haunter's coverage, hitting Steel-types and Skuntank hard. Destiny Bond is the final move on this set and is especially useful to lure in Skuntank so that Haunter's teammates have an easier time sweeping later on in the game.</p> <p>Thunderbolt is the most notable other option for the set, as it allows Haunter to OHKO Samurott, Mantine, and Choice Band Braviary and also 2HKO Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary and standard Golbat. Fighting-types such as Sawk and Primeape are very useful teammates, as they can demolish Steel-types, Regice, and Skuntank, all of which threaten Haunter. Seismitoad is also a decent partner for similar reasons, and it can take out Regirock and set up Stealth Rock as well. In return, Haunter can threaten the Grass-types that Seismitoad dislikes facing. Eelektross pairs well with Haunter because it can defeat Mandibuzz and most Ground-types with little trouble. As Haunter's Destiny Bond can allow it to lure and defeat Pokemon such as Skuntank, Psychic-types such as Jynx, Gardevoir, and Musharna are good partners to take advantage of this.</p>"
      },
      "SubDisable": {
        "description": "<p>Haunter has some excellent immunities and resistances to common attacking types, and many Pokemon only have one move that can effectively damage it; this set takes advantage of that fact. With its good Speed and high offensive presence, Haunter can easily force switches and set up a Substitute to act as a buffer against attacks and status. Even if the opponent breaks its Substitute, Haunter can simply Disable the move and possibly block the opponent's only means to hurt it. When Haunter has successfully Disabled a move and kept a Substitute intact, it is free to start inflicting damage upon the opposing team. Shadow Ball provides coverage against the Psychic- and Ghost-types that would otherwise threaten it. Sludge Bomb is a stronger STAB move that provides good neutral coverage alongside Shadow Ball; its poison chance is also very useful to wear down Pokemon that Haunter cannot defeat with brute force and allows it to stall out opposing Pokemon with Substitute.</p> <p>Because set forces many switches, entry hazard support is very beneficial to punish your opponent; Toxic Spikes are particularly useful against Pokemon that do have a second move to damage Haunter, as Haunter can stall them out with Substitute to the point where it can successfully KO them. Scolipede and Roselia are options for setting up both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, but their Poison typing clashes with Haunter's. Stealth Rock support from Rock- or Ground-types such as Golem and Seismitoad is very useful as it allows Haunter to OHKO Charizard with Sludge Bomb. Both Rock- and Ground-types can also assist Haunter in handling counters such as Mandibuzz and Skuntank, and Haunter can prevent opposing Rapid Spin users from removing entry hazards. Fighting-types, most notably Sawk and Gurdurr, can generally switch in against Dark-types and threaten not only them, but also specially bulky Pokemon such as Regice, Lickilicky, and Audino. This set particularly enjoys the removal of Steel-types, so Magnet Pull Probopass is a great teammate to handle them. As Haunter appreciates switching in safely, a slow Volt Switch from Eelektross can be quite valuable.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>With its important Speed benchmark, Haunter can act as a decent Choice Scarf user, as it is capable of revenge killing fast threats such as Swellow and boosted Gorebyss. Shadow Ball is Haunter's most important STAB move on this set, as it is the only move that provides decent super effective coverage. Sludge Bomb threatens slower Chlorophyll users such as Exeggutor in the sun, and it also provides decent neutral coverage. While Haunter's power is only decent, it has Trick and Destiny Bond to be more of a threat. Haunter's Speed makes Destiny Bond a great move against offensive Pokemon that it has trouble taking out in one hit, such as Samurott and Kangaskhan. Trick is extremely useful for crippling defensive Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Munchlax, as well as bulky setup sweepers such as Musharna.</p> <p>Thunderbolt is a viable third offensive move to make it easier for Haunter to revenge kill Pokemon such as Samurott and Braviary. As this set utilizes Choice Scarf, the removal of priority and Pursuit users is advised as Haunter is quite vulnerable to them. Fighting-types such as Sawk and Gurdurr handle most users of these moves well, most notably Skuntank and Kangaskhan. Wallbreakers such as Eelektross and Samurott are invaluable, as they can weaken Haunter's counters enough that it can power through them. Eelektross can also provide a slow Volt Switch to give Haunter a free switch-in. This set enjoys having opposing Steel-types removed, as Trick is its only way of crippling them, which makes Magnet Pull Probopass a great teammate. Stealth Rock support from Ground-types such as Piloswine and Seismitoad is helpful, as the damage allows Haunter to 2HKO even standard bulky Samurott with Sludge Bomb.</p>"

It is one of the better Jynx counters, being immune to Lovely Kiss, and does a similarly good job against other special attackers such as Charizard. However, it is extremely vulnerable to status and has unimpressive physical bulk. Its low HP stat also makes it a mediocre Wish passer, and its poor offensive stats leave it setup fodder against the likes of Misdreavus and Scraggy.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Magic Coat is a good option to reflect status moves and Taunt back at the opponent. An offensive Nasty Plot set can be used, but it is outclassed by more powerful Pokemon such as Beheeyem and Jynx. A Calm Mind set can be used, but it is held back by Hypno's poor physical bulk, vulnerability to status, and reliance on Wish and Protect for recovery, limiting its coverage. Hypno gets Baton Pass and is able to pass Nasty Plot and Calm Mind boosts, but it faces competition from Mr. Mime, which is faster and has Soundproof. Hypno can use Trick Room, but its poor offenses mean it cannot utilize it effectively, and it is again outclassed by Beheeyem. Hypnosis can be used, but it is inaccurate and takes up a moveslot that can be better spent on more beneficial status moves. Disable can be used to annoy Choice-locked Pokemon, but Hypno's low Speed holds this strategy back a little. Switcheroo can be used with a crippling item such as Choice Specs or Flame Orb, but this prevents Hypno from doing its job of walling effectively. Finally, Belly Drum is the ultimate gimmick and can be set up with relative ease due to Hypno's good special bulk and Wish, but once again, Hypno's low Speed holds it back.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Skuntank and Liepard are the best counters to Hypno as long as they avoid Thunder Wave, as they can Taunt and Encore Hypno respectively before Pursuit trapping it. Scraggy and Gurdurr can set up on Hypno that use Foul Play, while Nasty Plot Misdreavus and Pokemon with 101 HP Substitutes such as Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary can set up on variants that use Seismic Toss. Taunt users are able to shut down Hypno. Mandibuzz and Misdreavus do so effectively, with the former taking little damage from Foul Play and the latter being immune to Seismic Toss. Powerful physical attackers such as Pinsir and Scolipede can also defeat Hypno, but they must be wary of switching into Thunder Wave. If Hypno lacks Taunt, Pokemon such as Substitute + Shell Smash Gorebyss and Klang can set up on it. Toxic Spikes and Toxic are excellent ways to cripple Hypno. Scolipede is a good Pokemon to set up Toxic Spikes and can threaten to OHKO Hypno with Megahorn. Finally, powerful wallbreakers such as Ludicolo and Choice Band Sawk can still 2HKO Hypno with entry hazard support.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Hypno has good special bulk, allowing it to come in on special attackers and disrupt them. Wish is Hypno's recovery move, but should not be relied on to support its teammates due to Hypno's low HP stat. Protect allows Hypno to receive its own Wishes, scout for moves, and gain Leftovers recovery. Thunder Wave allows Hypno to cripple fast offensive threats such as Jynx and Primeape and support the team. On the other hand, Toxic lets Hypno wear down opposing walls such as Tangela. The last moveslot is reserved for an attacking move to prevent Hypno from being Taunt bait and setup fodder. Foul Play allows Hypno to hit Ghost-types and OHKO Choice Band Golurk but leaves it helpless against Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Scraggy. Meanwhile, Seismic Toss can deal with these threats but leaves Hypno vulnerable to Ghost-types such as Misdreavus as well as Pokemon with 101 HP Substitutes, such as Braviary.</p> <p>Taunt is a decent option to stop status and setup from slower Pokemon. Reflect is a good option to patch up Hypno's low physical bulk, but it is hard to fit into the moveset. Psychic allows Hypno to hit Scolipede harder, but it is generally much weaker than the listed attacking moves. Insomnia is the ability of choice, setting Hypno apart from other special walls by allowing it to switch in on Jynx, Vileplume, and offensive Roselia fearlessly and wall them. The EV spread allows Hypno to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Primeape's Close Combat, Life Orb Jynx's Ice Beam, and Life Orb Charizard's Fire Blast. Hypno despises status, so teammates that can remove Toxic Spikes are essential. Scolipede, Roselia, and Garbodor are able to absorb Toxic Spikes and can set up their own to aid in Hypno's stalling. In particular, Rocky Helmet Garbodor is a great option to switch into and punish Pokemon that love using U-turn on Hypno. Teammates that can provide cleric support, such as Miltank and Audino, are also appreciated. Finally, teammates that cover Hypno's weaknesses to Dark- and Bug-type moves are decent. Klang and Gurdurr are able to do so with ease.</p>"

  "Kingler": {
    "overview": "<p>While Kingler's extraordinary Attack stat might make you think it is one of the most fearsome Pokemon in NU, it certainly isn't. This is because it has many flaws that don't allow it to perform well in the current NU metagame. First of all, its bulk is awful, especially on the special side, and this makes it very hard for Kingler to switch in or set up. Furthermore, its Speed is not high enough, so many offensive Pokemon can easily check Kingler, making use of its bad bulk to outspeed and OHKO it. To make matters worse, while Sheer Force is a great ability, it is a waste on Kingler, as it doesn't learn Waterfall. Kingler also faces competion from Samurott, who has much better bulk and isn't as predictable as Kingler, and Carracosta, who has a much easier time setting up; these two have priority in Aqua Jet as well. Not all is bad news for Kingler, though, as its high Attack stat makes it hard to switch into, and its Speed, while not very good, is enough to outspeed many walls and some threats like Seismitoad or Ludicolo, letting Kingler severely damage them via a Choice Band or Swords Dance-boosted attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Using both Agility and Swords Dance make Kingler a very threatening sweeper, but it must set up first, which is a problem as it's very hard for Kingler to set up both moves due to its poor bulk. If it only sets Agility up it will lack the power to break through sturdy walls, and if it gets to use Swords Dance it will be outsped and KOed by faster offensive Pokemon. This strategy is not to be dismissed, however, as using both boosting moves at the same time is the way Kingler can be more devastating, but it is a really high risk, high reward strategy that is very difficult to execute. A set consisting of Agility and three attacks can be used as Kingler outspeeds many Pokemon, including Choice Scarf users, after an Agility boost, and can finish a game. A Choice Scarf can be used to patch Kingler's Speed, but it is still outsped by every common Choice Scarf user, and it doesn't pack as much power as the other sets. A Normal Gem can be used in conjunction with Double-Edge to get a really powerful move that OHKOes offensive Ludicolo after Stealth Rock damage, OHKOes Vileplume and has a great chance to OHKO physically defensive Seismitoad after a Swords Dance boost, and OHKOes Alomomola after two Swords Dance boosts; by using this gimmicky strategy, Kingler can lure one of its counters in and net a surprise KO on it, making this good for other offensive Water-types that like having these counters KOed or severely damaged.</p> <p>As for other moves, Superpower is an acceptable option to heavily damage Munchlax, Lickilicky, Miltank, and Klang; however, it doesn't offer much coverage, and these threats are already hit hard by Crabhammer. Knock Off is a decent support option to annoy an Alomomola, Tangela, or Frillish switch-in, and also kills Shedinja, but Toxic has, overall, more utility. Sheer Force is a good ability, but Kingler cannot exploit it (sadly, it doesn't learn Waterfall), as its only boosted move would be Rock Slide, which is not worth a slot and doesn't get any important KOs. Sheer Force-boosted Ice Beam 2HKOes Tangela, but otherwise it's a terrible option, as Kingler's Special Attack is really bad. Finally, Hone Claws can be used over Swords Dance as it improves Crabhammer's accuracy, but Kingler really appreciates the power Swords Dance provides.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Kingler is very difficult to directly counter due to its power, which makes switching in on a Crabhammer without being immune to it very difficult. The odd Frillish makes a great counter, as it is immune to both Crabhammer and Return, and resists X-Scissor. Frillish can burn Kingler with Will-o-Wisp, rendering it almost useless, or damage it with Night Shade, which breaks Kingler's Substitutes. It should be noted that Frillish is not a common sight in the current NU metagame. Most Grass-types have an easy time with Kingler; Vileplume and Tangela can easily take a hit and OHKO back with Giga Drain, regaining the health they may have lost, while Serperior and Leafeon can outspeed Kingler if it didn't get a boost and OHKO it with their STAB moves. Weezing and Misdreavus can burn Kingler if it hasn't set up, or 2HKO it with Sludge Bomb and Shadow Ball, respectively. Physically defensive Seismitoad is immune to Crabhammer and can hit Kingler hard with its STAB Earth Power. Alomomola can take Kingler's attacks and poison it, but it is setup fodder for the Substitute + Swords Dance set. Kingler hates status of all kinds, especially paralysis and burn. They make it much easier to handle.</p> <p>While Kingler is hard to counter, checking it is a different story. In general, Pokemon faster than Kingler can just outspeed and KO Kingler with little prior damage due to its poor bulk. Also, most Choice Scarf users, especially those that use special attacks such as Rotom-S and Rotom-F, can check Kingler as well, despite the fact that they cannot directly switch in on an attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>With this set, Kingler becomes a decent wallbreaker that can threaten an opposing Pokemon out, set up, and potentially sweep. Substitute plays a very important role in this set, as it lets Kingler set up against walls such as Alomomola and Metang as well as avoid status that could be very detrimental for it. It also prevents Kingler from being revenge killed by faster threats and Choice Scarf users. Crabhammer is Kingler's STAB move and the only viable one it can use, as it doesn't learn Waterfall. While it doesn't have perfect accuracy and is not boosted by Sheer Force, it is a very powerful move with a nice critical hit rate. For the last slot, both Return and X-Scissor are good options as both have nice coverage with Crabhammer. Return provides Kingler with a strong and reliable move against most foes that resist or are immune to Crabhammer, while X-Scissor, even though it is weaker, lets Kingler heavily damage Musharna and many Grass-types, especially after a Swords Dance boost.</p> <p>A Salac Berry gives Kingler a chance to sweep; Kingler can be really hard to stop at +2 Attack and +1 Speed. It can be activated by just using Substitute three times. On the other hand, a Lum Berry is also a good option, as it lets Kingler switch in on Pokemon like Alomomola without fearing status. Life Orb can also be used, as it gives Kingler a lot of power. Coupled with Stealth Rock damage and an Adamant nature, it allows Kingler to at least 2HKO almost every Pokemon in the tier, and get some important OHKOs on Pokemon like standard Mandibuzz, Misdreavus, and Musharna. However, Substitute + Life Orb damage reduce Kingler's lifespan considerably. Finally, Leftovers is also an option, as it lets Kingler set up more Substitutes, but this isn't really necessary. A Jolly nature is preferred as it allows Kingler to outspeed Swellow and Adamant Choice Scarf Braviary at +1 Speed, as well as Adamant Sawk, Adamant Braviary, and positive-natured Ludicolo and Samurott without boosts.</p> <p>Kingler appreciates having partners that can deal with Grass- and Electric-types, since these Pokemon can easily OHKO it. Camerupt makes a good partner for Kingler as it can beat Grass- and Electric-types with its STAB moves and can also set up Stealth Rock. Pivot Musharna and Probopass can take many moves from faster foes that threaten Kingler, spread paralysis, and ease Kingler's setup via a slow Baton Pass and Volt Switch, respectively. LumRest Exeggutor can beat most Grass-types in the tier with ease, not fearing status and taking little damage from their hits, making it an ideal partner. Finally, the removal of Toxic Spikes is very important for Kingler, as they can make Substitute pointless and make Kingler much more susceptible to being walled by more threats, such as Alomomola. Garbodor and Roselia can do this and set up their own entry hazards as well.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>A Choice Band gives Kingler immediate power, helping Kingler get past many walls and deal heavy damage without having to set up. Crabhammer is Kingler's strongest STAB move, and when boosted by Choice Band, it 2HKOes any Pokemon that doesn't resist it. It 2HKOes physically defensive Mandibuzz and Weezing with Stealth Rock support, and even Pokemon that resist the attack, such as Serperior, won't enjoy taking it. X-Scissor has good coverge with Crabhammer and allows Kingler to cleanly 2HKO Musharna. Double-Edge is a much more powerful move that also has good coverage with Crabhammer, and is Kingler's most reliable move against Water-, and Dragon-type Pokemon. Double-Edge is also Kingler's best bet against Grass / Poison types. It is a guaranteed 2HKO on physically defensive Seismitoad with just one layer of Spikes, and physically defensive Vileplume with Stealth Rock support, which is quite a feat considering the fact that Double-Edge isn't boosted by STAB. Finally, Toxic is the best option for the last slot, as Kingler doesn't need more coverage and Toxic greatly annoys common switch-ins such as Alomomola, Tangela, and Mandibuzz, putting them on a timer.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is used because this set is used to break walls, and Kingler appreciates all the power it can get. A Jolly nature can also be used to outspeed Adamant Sawk, Adamant Braviary, Ludicolo, and Samurott, but the loss of power will be noticeable. Return can be used if Double-Edge's recoil is annoying, as Kingler's low HP makes it unable to take a large amount of recoil damage. However, Kingler really appreciates the power of Double-Edge to beat threats such as Vileplume and Seismitoad. As for good partners for this set, Musharna is a great one. Musharna can provide Kingler with a slow Baton Pass and paralysis support, which Kingler really appreciates. Pairing Kingler with Samurott or Ludicolo is also a good idea as Kingler can weaken their counters, letting them finish off the game. Dragon-types such as Fraxure and Zweilous cover Kingler's weaknesses to Grass- and Electric-type attacks nicely. Fraxure can also make use of Kingler's ability to damage walls to set up and sweep. LumRest Exeggutor makes a great partner for Kingler, due to its ability to beat many Grass- and Water-type Pokemon. Roselia is also a very good partner for Kingler, being able to set up entry hazards, take Electric- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Kingler, and deal with Alomomola and Tangela.</p>"

  "Marowak": {
    "overview": "<p>Marowak is an offensive juggernaut, thanks to its signature item, Thick Club, which doubles its average Attack, increasing it to amazing levels. In combination with its signature move, Bonemerang, which hits twice, Marowak can prevent several common Stealth Rock users from setting up by bypassing their Sturdy ability. Its Ground typing is also an important attribute because it gives it an immunity to Electric-type moves and a resistance to Stealth Rock. Sadly, its weaknesses to common Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type moves and its low Speed hinder it. Marowak is also easily worn down due to its lack of recovery and mediocre special bulk. Additionally, it's only viable with its Thick Club, further limiting its options in the metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Marowak is a very potent threat on a Trick Room team with a Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs. Marowak is also able to use Swords Dance, but it is usually too slow to take advantage of it after setting up. Earthquake is a more accurate option over Bonemerang, but it lacks Bonemerang's ability to break through Sturdy, Focus Sash, and Substitute users, which is a major selling point. Thunder Punch and Fire Punch are options for extra coverage, but the additional damage output rarely makes a difference, as a super effective hit from them does the same amount as a neutral hit from Bonemerang. Toxic is a good option to hit walls such as Alomomola and Tangela on the switch, but Marowak generally prefers Toxic Spikes support instead. Knock Off is an option, but Marowak is meant to simply hit the opponent hard rather than messing with the opponent's item. Smack Down is an option for a Rock-type move to allow Marowak to hit Flying-type and Levitating Pokemon on the switch and then threaten them with Bonemerang. Rock Slide is a more accurate and reliable option for a Rock-type move, but the difference in power from Stone Edge is very noticeable. Marowak has several special attacks it can use with Lightningrod, but they deal pitiful damage because Thick Club does not boost Special Attack. However, a Marowak running a Naughty nature with 88 Special Attack EVs can 2HKO Torterra with Ice Beam. Finally, Sing and Perish Song are interesting support options, but Marowak is better off attacking most of the time.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Alomomola and Tangela are not fazed by anything Marowak throws at them, and they have super effective STAB moves to retaliate with. Seismitoad is a common Pokemon that can take anything Marowak uses and threaten it with powerful Water-type STAB moves. Torterra is also a great counter, as it can take any move Marowak has and then destroy it with Wood Hammer. Weezing is a good counter as it is only 3HKOed by Double-Edge after Stealth Rock damage, but it has a bit of trouble damaging Marowak in return if it has a Substitute up to block Will-O-Wisp. Exeggutor can take a hit from any single move Marowak has and then set up or retaliate back. Burn spreaders such as Misdreavus, Solrock, and Wartortle can cripple Marowak if it isn't behind a Substitute. Special attackers such as Samurott and Roselia cannot safely switch in, but they can easily threaten Marowak out due to its low special bulk and Speed. Piloswine is a Stealth Rock user that Marowak cannot OHKO, and it also threatens Marowak with its Ice-type moves. As Marowak is pretty slow, most faster Pokemon can revenge kill it unless it has a Substitute up. Trick and Knock Off can remove Marowak's Thick Club and render this orphan ineffectual.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>Marowak is unique in that it has access to Bonemerang, a powerful STAB attack that allows it to hit twice in one turn. This allows Marowak to break through Substitute, Focus Sash, and Sturdy users in a single turn, an invaluable attribute when facing opposing Stealth Rock users, as it can prevent many of them from setting up. Stone Edge rounds out Marowak's coverage, notably hitting the Flying-types that Bonemerang fails to hit. Double-Edge is a good option for hitting most opponents neutrally, which eases prediction on the player's part. With its typing and offensive presence, Marowak can force plenty of switches against Stealth Rock users and set up Stealth Rock for your team. The switches it forces against common Stealth Rock leads also give Marowak time to use Substitute, though it doesn't have many opportunities to set up outside of this. However, if your team already has a Stealth Rock user, then Substitute is a completely viable alternative move.</p> <p>The EVs and nature maximize Marowak's power, while allowing it to outspeed Modest Shell Smash Torkoal, survive a Close Combat from Jolly Choice Band Sawk, and OHKO both with Bonemerang. Thick Club is the only item Marowak should use, as it is what makes it viable in the first place. Marowak really enjoys Toxic Spikes support from Poison-types such as Scolipede and Roselia, as it allows Marowak to have an easier time against many of its defensive counters, such as Alomomola and Tangela. Poison-types also absorb Toxic Spikes for Marowak, and in return, Marowak can smash the Steel-types that tend to wall them. As Marowak is quite slow, paralysis support from Pokemon such as Musharna and Murkrow can really help give it the chance it needs to sweep teams; it is important to note that this clashes with Toxic Spikes support, so trying to use both simultaneously is not recommended. Charizard is a good offensive teammate because it appreciates Marowak's ability to help prevent Stealth Rock from being set up, and Marowak loves Charizard's ability to handle Weezing and the Grass- and Ice-types that Marowak fears. Flying- and Ice-types such as Braviary and Regice really appreciate Marowak's ability to scare away Rock- and Steel-types, and they can also scare away the Grass-types Marowak hates. Ninjask is a notable Flying-type teammate, as it can also pass useful Speed boosts to Marowak to allow it to sweep and Marowak can handle common Rock Blast users such as Golem. Grass-types such as Exeggutor and Shiftry pair well with Marowak as they resist common Water- and Grass-type moves and can handle Seismitoad, Alomomola, and other Water-types that puts a damper on it. Gothorita is a great partner for Marowak, as it can trap physical walls such as Tangela, Alomomola, and Weezing and remove them so that Marowak smash the opposing team unhindered.</p>"

  "Tangela": {
    "overview": "<p>Tangela is a good defensive Pokemon in NU, with Eviolite to bolster its already good defenses, a high Defense stat allowing it to wall most threats, and Regenerator to make up for its lack of Leftovers recovery. A decorated support movepool including Sleep Powder, Leech Seed, Knock Off, and Synthesis allows it to do more than just sit around and tank hits. Tangela also has good Special Attack and access to Sleep Powder, both of which keep it from becoming setup fodder and allow it to run a more offensive set; Sleep Powder also means that threats that would otherwise switch in for free, such as Mandibuzz, can be incapacitated, after which Tangela can switch to an appropriate teammate. However, Tangela's typing tends to hold it back a bit; having weaknesses to common Fire- and Flying-type attacks is a huge downfall and force it to rely on its bulk alone to take on a good number of attackers. Tangela's poor special bulk is a huge problem for it, meaning that most powerful special attackers can destroy it, severely limiting its walling potential. Meanwhile, its good movepool still misses out on some great support moves, such as Will-O-Wisp, Heal Bell, Taunt, and Baton Pass, making Misdreavus and Musharna better alternatives for many teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set utilizing Sunny Day + SolarBeam can be used, but is utterly outclassed by Exeggutor and Shiftry. A Life Orb can be used on the offensive set, but Tangela really needs the increased bulk from Eviolite. Physical sets and sets with Choice Specs can work but are gimmicky and shouldn't be used. Toxic can cripple switch-ins but Sleep Powder and Stun Spore are generally more useful. Protect eases prediction and helps Tangela scout for moves, but does nothing much for Tangela specifically. Leaf Storm in conjunction with Power Swap is a gimmicky strategy and should never be used.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Flying-types such as Mandibuzz, Rotom-S, and most variants of Braviary are great counters to Tangela and have enough bulk to take a Hidden Power Rock. While Charizard can threaten Tangela with its STABs, it is 4x weak to Stealth Rock, making it a shaky check. LumRest Exeggutor can switch in on Sleep Powder due to Lum Berry, resists Tangela's STAB, and can hit it hard with Psychic. Sap Sipper Pokemon such as Miltank and Sawsbuck can hard wall Tangela and set up on it. Poison-types such as Roselia and Garbodor can force Tangela out and set up Toxic Spikes on it. Lastly, Vital Spirit Magmar and RestTalk Flareon are rare counters but very effective due to not being affected by Sleep Powder.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Tangela's great physical bulk lets it take on a large number of physically oriented threats such as Kangaskhan and Torterra with ease. Giga Drain is easily Tangela's most important move and provides a strong, consistent STAB move and lets it regain lost health. Leech Seed is the primary option for the second slot and provides Tangela with a form of passive damage, which is especially important against bulkier foes. However, Synthesis is an option as it provides reliable recovery and lets Tangela check physical attackers more consistently while staying in. Sleep Powder lets Tangela incapacitate switch-ins that would otherwise force Tangela out, such as Mandibuzz and Braviary. Hidden Power Rock lets Tangela hit irritating Flying- and Fire-types such as Swellow, Braviary, and Charizard hard, but Stun Spore is a viable option as well and gives Tangela a secondary way to cripple opponents after Sleep Clause has been activated.</p> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Tangela's physical bulk while the Special Defense investment allows it to survive Life Orb Ludicolo's Ice Beam after Stealth Rock. More investment in Speed is viable to let Tangela outspeed Alomomola and Golurk, but the defensive investment is invaluable for it, making said Speed investment not worth it most of the time. Hidden Power Ice and Hidden Power Fire are viable options for a Hidden Power type, but Hidden Power Rock generally has better coverage overall. Knock Off lets Tangela be an annoyance to Pokemon that rely on their items to be effective (especially Eviolite users), but the given moves are usually more important. If dealing with Ludicolo isn't important for your team, a spread of 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD should be used. Partners that deal with Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary and Fire-types are appreciated, Regirock being a stellar example. Lickilicky is a great partner for Tangela as it can wall special threats that trouble Tangela, but keep in mind that this core is vulnerable to strong physically based Fire- and Flying-type attackers. Choice Band Golurk can deal with Fire-types and can do a number to the opponent's team with the paralysis support Tangela provides if it chooses to run Stun Spore. Water-types such as Samurott can deal with Fire-types such as Charizard, making them good partners as well.</p>"

Leaf Storm is Tangela's main STAB move and works wonderfully with Regenerator as it will be switching out often. Sleep Powder lets Tangela incapacitate switch-ins and deters its checks and counters from coming in for free against it. Hidden Power Rock hits many important targets such as Braviary and Charizard that would otherwise give this set hell. Giga Drain is the primary option in the fourth slot as it provides a consistent STAB move that doesn't require Tangela to switch out and provides a somewhat reliable form of recovery. Synthesis is a more consistent form of recovery but is generally an inferior option as reliable recovery is not a concern for this set.</p> <p>The given EVs let Tangela hit as hard as possible and outspeed Alomomola and Golurk.

  "Kangaskhan": {
    "overview": "<p>Kangaskhan is an example of a Pokemon that has several advantageous traits. Its stats are an indication of its great balance, as it has enough power to get past multiple foes and enough Speed to outpace the ever-dangerous Sawk and many other common threats in NU while having a great bulk that allows it to take a multitude of hits. While there are more powerful, faster Normal-types such as Tauros and Sawsbuck, Kangaskhan's access to Scrappy means that Ghost-types cannot wall its STAB, giving it near-perfect coverage with two moves and limiting the number of Pokemon that can switch into its STAB. Kangaskhan also has a very wide physical movepool that helps it cover many relevant threats in the metagame and gives it a bunch of priority options, including Sucker Punch and Fake Out, allowing it to finish off weakened foes and dangerous weather sweepers, a feat that no other Pokemon in the tier can accomplish as easily. Despite these multiple perks and its wide movepool, however, Kangaskhan has almost no way to get past physical walls such as Alomomola and Tangela outside of hitting them with Toxic, and it has no way to boost its decent Attack outside of the underwhelming Work Up. Despite these flaws, Kangaskhan can fill multiple roles effectively and is a good addition to any team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Kangaskhan has a wide movepool, but not much of it is usable. It has two useful moves in Body Slam and Wish, with the former's chance of paralyzing the foe adding utility and the latter healing 50% of Kangaskhan's or its partner's HP, which goes well with its high 105 base HP. However, both of these moves are illegal with Scrappy, which is the huge advantage Kangaskhan has over other Normal-types, and the role of a supporting Normal-type gets serious competition from the bulkier Lickilicky. Aqua Tail hits Golem harder than anything else Kangaskhan has and still hits other Rock-types hard, but its unreliable accuracy makes Earthquake the superior choice more often than not. Kangaskhan has other Fighting-type moves to consider such as Hammer Arm or Low Kick, but this is another case in which Earthquake generally hits Pokemon harder (though many Rock-types are hit at maximum power by Low Kick due to their heavy weight), and Drain Punch's recovery can be hard to pass up on. Ice Punch is useful for Torterra and certain other switch-ins, but that is virtually it. Crunch hits Solrock and Lunatone hard, but these two Pokemon are rare and are generally not worth using a moveslot for. Circle Throw is an interesting option for phazing, but the lack of STAB and Kangaskhan's access to many other Fighting moves usually makes this a mediocre choice. Finally, Early Bird isn't completely useless, as it can allow Kangaskhan to use Rest and wake up faster than usual, but this usually isn't worth losing Scrappy.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>With Scrappy disabling Ghost-types from walling it, Kangaskhan is a bit more difficult to counter than other Normal-types. However, Regirock stands out as the best counter, as its massive physical bulk makes it hard to wear down, and it can heal off almost all damage with Drain Punch or take the opportunity to set up Stealth Rock. From there, most Pokemon that have a good physical bulk work, as Kangaskhan has very few tricks to get past them. Gurdurr can take Kangaskhan's attacks and retaliate back with Drain Punch or pick off a weakened Kangaskhan with Mach Punch. Alomomola's massive physical bulk allows it to stall out Kangaskhan with Wish, Protect, and Toxic, and thanks to its massive HP, Double-Edge recoil is much greater. Tangela's physical bulk is also great, and it can use Leech Seed on Kangaskhan to heal its HP or just cripple it with Sleep Powder. Its Giga Drain also always does enough to break Kangaskhan's Substitute in case it cannot use Leech Seed. Cradily can easily counter Kangaskhan sets without Fighting-type attacks, taking Earthquakes very well and stalling it out with Toxic and Recover or chipping at it with Giga Drain. Metang is also a great check to Kangaskhan and can counter it completely if Kangaskhan uses Drain Punch over Earthquake. Metang can then hit it back with Meteor Mashes or cripple it with Toxic. Piloswine has great physical bulk as well, but it must watch out for Focus Punch, which can do quite a bit of damage. However, Piloswine's access to Icicle Spear means it usually comes out on top. Primeape can outspeed and OHKO all variants of Kangaskhan. However, it takes massive damage from Double-Edge and is rather vulnerable to Fake Out. When Kangaskhan is locked into a Normal-type move, Steel-types such as Probopass and Bastiodon and Rock-types such as Golem can take hits and hit back with their own STAB moves or cripple Kangaskhan with a status move. In general, hitting Kangaskhan with any status move makes it a lot easier to play around, as it either loses power with a burn or Speed with paralysis, and Toxic makes it get worn down much faster.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of many of Kangaskhan's traits—its Speed tier allows it to outpace many dangerous Pokemon, including Sawk, Pinsir, and Gardevoir, and it does an excellent job at checking sweepers due to a few priority options, powerful moves, above-average bulk, great coverage, and to top it off, a very useful ability that means, unlike other Normal-types, it cannot be easily stopped by Ghosts.</p> <p>Kangaskhan's Attack stat isn't monstrous on its own, but Double-Edge more than makes up for it with its excellent 120 Base Power, and in conjunction with a boosting item, it can do massive damage to the opposition. However, if one plans on utilizing Kangaskhan's bulk, or just simply doesn't appreciate the massive recoil damage, Return is a suitable replacement, though the loss in power can be noticeable. Earthquake hits Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon for super effective damage and gives Kangaskhan near-perfect neutral coverage. While Drain Punch is a much weaker alternative, it hits the same Pokemon as Earthquake and can recover recoil damage sustained from Double-Edge. Fake Out works well because it essentially gets a \"free hit\" on the opponent, as nothing is immune to it at all. Finally, Sucker Punch is another priority move Kangaskhan has access to, and a combination of it and Fake Out can stop a sweeper if it is somewhat low on health, which is a nice tool to have just in case a check for the said sweeper has gone down.</p> <p>An Adamant nature can be used on Kangaskhan to still outspeed neutral natured base 80 and 85 Speed Pokemon such as Braviary and Sawk, respectively, although Jolly is still preferred to be able to check Pokemon sitting around those Speed tiers regardless of their nature. A Silk Scarf is preferred as the main moves Kangaskhan will be using are its STAB options, and a Silk Scarf powers up both of them. It also doesn't detract from Kangaskhan's bulk, which is one of Kangaskhan's selling points. However, a Life Orb is still usable because it makes Sucker Punch stronger and helps Kangaskhan do more to Pokemon that resist Normal-type attacks with its other coverage move, though recoil damage can add up from repeated Fake Out and Double-Edge use. Leftovers is a usable alternative over both of these items because Kangaskhan is fairly bulky, but this comes at the cost of a great amount of power, as base 95 Attack is often not enough without a boosting item. Toxic is also usable here to get past physical walls such as Alomomola, which can otherwise wall Kangaskhan without problems, but giving up a moveslot can be difficult.</p> <p>Due to Kangaskhan's ability to hit a wide range of targets hard, Kangaskhan is rather easy to stick onto a team. However, two of the bulkiest physical walls in the tier, Alomomola and Tangela, aren't hit hard by anything Kangaskhan can throw at them. Due to this, Electabuzz and Zebstrika make good partners, as they can hurt Alomomola greatly with their Electric STAB moves, switch into Sleep Powder thanks to Vital Spirit and Sap Sipper, and hit Tangela hard with Hidden Power Ice and Overheat, respectively. Arbok makes a good partner as well, as its access to Intimidate allows it to set up on Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Choice item Sawk with ease. It can also set up on Alomomola and Tangela due to its immunity to Toxic and its Poison STAB threatening the latter. Exeggutor can similarly check these Pokemon due to its relatively high Defense, resistance to Fighting moves, and the ability to deal massive damage with the appropriate STAB move.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Though Kangaskhan may lack the raw Attack stat of Choice Band users such as Braviary, it makes up for it in many aspects. The first is its access to Scrappy, which ensures that nothing can switch into its main STAB without taking damage, giving it a significant advantage over other Normal-types which must be extremely careful about Ghost-types. Kangaskhan's base 90 Speed is also invaluable in a metagame filled with Gardevoir, Sawk, Braviary, and Pinsir, which all sit at either base 80 or 85 Speed. While Kangaskhan's Attack may not be quite as high as other Pokemon in the tier, it still hits rather hard due to its access to powerful moves, and is therefore still a huge threat.</p> <p>Sitting at 120 Base Power, Double-Edge hits very hard and is the main move Kangaskhan will be using. Earthquake hits Steel- and Rock-types for super effective damage, and a combination of it and Double-Edge covers almost every Pokemon in the tier. Aside from these two moves, however, Kangaskhan can also utilize Sucker Punch to catch faster foes as a revenge killer of sorts, but be wary of using it mindlessly, as being locked into it is dangerous due to the nature of the move. Finally, Return is preferred for the last slot, because although Kangaskhan already has Double-Edge, it still hits fairly hard and doesn't cause recoil.</p> <p>Though the focus of this set is power, a Jolly nature is preferred here so that Kangaskhan can outspeed the many Pokemon that are barely slower than it, such as Gardevoir, Pinsir, Articuno, and Rotom-A, and then inflict massive damage before they can hit back. Adamant can still be useful here, but it doesn't gain too many additional KOs and not being able to outspeed the other Pokemon can cause problems.</p> <p>Because the Choice Band forces Kangaskhan to be locked into a move, what it really wants is to spam Double-Edge without having to worry about a Pokemon that resists the move, so Rock- and Steel-types should be dealt with. Due to many Rock- and Steel types having lower Special Defenses, strong Water-type special attackers such as Samurott, Ludicolo, and Gorebyss are great partners. Despite the additional power Kangaskhan has with a Choice Band, Tangela and Alomomola can still wall this set, making Electabuzz and Zebstrika good partners, as they can hit Alomomola hard with their Electric STAB and sport an immunity to Sleep Powder thanks to their abilities. Exeggutor can check these two by OHKOing them with the appropriate move and also can take Fighting-type attacks from Gurdurr and Sawk while retaliating with a STAB Psychic. Any Psychic-type Pokemon, especially Musharna, makes a great partner as it prevents Fighting-types from setting up on or outright KOing Kangaskhan.</p>"
      },
      "SubPunch": {
        "description": "<p>At first glance, Kangaskhan looks like a generic SubPunch user, but thanks to Scrappy, Ghost-types cannot switch into Focus Punch without taking massive amounts of damage. Some Ghost-types such as Misdreavus may also be incapable of harming Kangaskhan if they opt to use only their Ghost-type moves, thanks to its immunity. Setting up a Substitute is usually not too difficult for Kangaskhan thanks to its wide coverage and the number of switches it can force. A Substitute also helps Kangaskhan avoid status which damages Kangaskhan's bulk or its offensive presence. Despite not getting a STAB boost, Focus Punch hits very hard and has the advantage of hitting Rock- and Steel-types, the only two resistors of Normal-type moves, for super effective damage. Sucker Punch hits faster foes for a lot of damage and is useful in conjunction with a Substitute because the foe will often be forced to attack in order to break it, making the move always succeed. Return is used as the STAB option, which after STAB actually is stronger than Focus Punch.</p> <p>The given EVs ensure Kangaskhan outspeeds Adamant Sawk, which would otherwise OHKO it. A spread of 212 HP / 252 Atk / 44 Spe gives Kangaskhan the ability to make 101 HP Substitutes, but its immunity to Night Shade and the rarity of Seismic Toss in the tier makes this less of an issue. A more offensive spread with 252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed positive-natured base 80s, 85s, and Rotom-A, but given that this set needs the power to get past Steel- and Rock-types, it generally isn't as good. Leftovers is used in order to help Kangaskhan create more Substitutes and in general makes Kangaskhan a bit harder to wear down. Toxic can be used, generally over Sucker Punch, to cripple a physical wall such as Alomomola, which would otherwise wall this set cold.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Pokemon with multi-hit moves, namely Golem and Piloswine, can't be dealt with reliably by Focus Punch and take very little damage from anything else Kangaskhan tries to throw at them. Samurott can hit both hard with its Water STAB, either on the physical or special side. Not having any boosting item or move, Kangaskhan struggles against physical walls such as Alomomola and Tangela, as well as bulkier Pokemon such as Gurdurr. Exeggutor can take on all three with ease, being able to OHKO them all with the appropriate move. Arbok can also set up on these Pokemon thanks to its immunity to Toxic and resistances to Grass and Fighting. Electabuzz and Zebstrika are good options for Tangela and Alomomola, thanks to their abilities granting them immunities to Sleep Powder.</p>"

  "Seadra": {
    "overview": "<p>Seadra is relatively unimpressive in Neverused, with rather average stats that prevent it from fulfilling a specific role on a team. Seadra has good Special Attack and fair Speed, but low Special Defense and no reliable recovery. Fortunately, it is a NFE Pokemon, which allows it to use Eviolite, raising its Defense to sky high levels. However, Seadra is still outclassed by Alomomola in terms of bulk due to the latter's access to recovery from Leftovers and Regenerator. In addition, it's also lacking in the offensive department when compared to behemoths like Samurott. Its poor Special Defense renders it extremely susceptible to the common Volt Switch as well. Hence, Seadra's only niche is taking advantage of its decent physical bulk and Disable to try to maintain a Substitute and fire off moderately powerful attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Protect and Disable set is a great alternative that doesn't force Seadra to lose 25% of its health every other turn. However, this set can leave Seadra vulnerable to status effects and surprise switches, so it's more difficult to utilize. A tank set might look good at first glance but Seadra is outclassed by Alomomola in this regard as the latter has access to recovery moves, Leftovers recovery, and Regenerator. Sniper can be used if you have a team that focuses on other status effects that Poison Point interferes with. A set that does not use Disable is not recommended, as Disable is one of Seadra's niche moves and sets it apart from other Water-types in the tier such as Simipour and Samurott. Clear Smog is a viable option to remove an opponent's stat boosts, but this job is better relegated to other teammates.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Water-types are the first and foremost checks to Seadra, as it only has the weak Hidden Power Grass to hurt them. Grass-types are also threats, with Ludicolo and Roselia worthy of mention as they can switch into Ice Beam as well. Regice and Lapras pack Electric-type attacks and counter Seadra as well. Although Electric-types hate switching into Scald, those that have Volt Switch can harass Seadra, as Volt Switch can break Seadra's Substitute and switch out the attacker, preventing them from being Disabled. Special walls and tanks can stomach Seadra's attacks, but they can't do much back if their offensive move is Disabled (though Pokemon that use Protect can force mind games). Taunt users can prevent Seadra from executing its niche by blocking Substitute and Disable, and proceed to take Seadra down. Good examples include Samurott and Frillish which can take any attack that Seadra dishes out. Phazers and Encorers are more effective in shutting Seadra down than Taunters are. Grumpig and Munchlax are the best answers to Seadra, though Mandibuzz can take a hit in a pinch, while Encore users are more prominent, with Liepard, Volbeat, and Kadabra all fast enough to lock Seadra into Disable or Substitute before it can attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "SubDisable": {
        "description": "<p>Disable is Seadra's main niche, and Seadra has the power and Speed to pull off a SubDisable set. Switch into a Pokemon that Seadra forces out, set up a Substitute, and use Disable to play around the opponent's next switch-in. Seadra is very bulky on the physical side, allowing it to take hits from physical attackers, disable their main STAB move, and force them to use a weaker move that does not threaten it. Walls and bulky opponents fall to Seadra once their main attack is disabled, as their other moves usually lack the firepower to break its Substitutes. Disable can also prevent the opponent's wall from stalling Seadra out with recovery moves, as it isn't the strongest Pokemon and will most likely fail to 2HKO most of them.</p> <p>Hydro Pump is a powerful STAB attack that can easily dent an opponent or force it out, but Scald is a more reliable option. Scald is able to cripple physical offensive opponents with burns so that they will have even more trouble breaking Substitutes. It is also useful for wearing down bulkier offensive Pokemon such as Samurott, Ludicolo, and Gardevoir. Finally, Ice Beam is great for coverage against Grass- and Dragon-types, and has a decent Base Power.</p> <p>Poison Point is the better overall ability to wear down walls and physical attackers through the potential poison damage. Signal Beam can be used in place of Ice Beam to deal more damage to Exeggutor and Ludicolo. However, Ice Beam is preferred thanks to its higher Base Power and ability to hit Dragon-types super effectively. Surf can be used as it is more powerful than Scald, and has superior accuracy compared to Hydro Pump. A Disable + 3 attacks set can be used if the user prefers a more offensive set. However, Substitute is preferred thanks to its ability to block stray hits, stop status effects, and ease prediction. Hidden Power Grass can be used for coverage if you opt for a more offensive route.</p> <p>Good teammates for Seadra are those that can set up entry hazards to inflict more residual damage onto opponents, taking advantage of its ability to force switches with Substitute and Disable. Seadra needs Toxic Spikes to break through most walls, as Seadra can fail to break through some opponents. Roselia and Garbodor are great Spikes and Toxic Spikes users to support Seadra. They resist the Grass-type attacks that Seadra dislikes, can force Grass-types out, and absorb Toxic Spikes, which can cripple Seadra. Ground-types such as Golem are immune to Electric-type attacks which threaten Seadra and can help set up Stealth Rock for the team. Meanwhile, Seadra can take the Water-type attacks aimed at them. Clerics such as Audino are also recommended as teammates, as Seadra absolutely hates any form of status due to its lack of reliable recovery and reliance on its Speed, bulk, and HP to make Substitutes.</p>"

  "Seaking": {
    "overview": "<p>Seaking is one of the several Pokemon introduced in RBY that never saw the light of the upper tiers, always finding its home in NU. The goldfish with a horn was deemed as one without competitive value. Even the Magikarp that you catch with Old Rod evolves into the great and mighty Gyarados. It seems like this poor old fish will never make a name for itself; and that's probably true. There's nothing much to say about its horrible stats. 'Horrible' might not even be enough to describe Seaking's stats. It has only one stat that breaks past the base 90 bench mark, and that is its base 92 Attack, which is rather average. To add insult to the injuries, it has an incredibly shallow movepool, probably because it stayed in its tiny little fish pond for too long. Seaking isn't a very apt name; it isn't even close to the true King of the Seas known as Kyogre. In fact, it's the opposite; it is the Slave of the Seas, outclassed by almost all of the Water-types that have appeared throughout the generations. Fortunately, the change of move mechanics in DPP gave Seaking some use. Its main STAB attack, Waterfall, became a physical attack, giving Seaking some utility in DPP UU. BW gave another gift to the lonely goldfish in Lightning Rod through Dream World. With that, Seaking gained an immunity to Electric-type moves, meaning that it has only one weakness left. That said, there isn't much of a reason to use Seaking, even in NU. But if you need an Electric immune Pokemon that can use Water-type attacks, Seaking is probably what you're looking for. That's a really small niche, probably smaller than Seaking's supposed memory space.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thanks to living in its tiny fish bowl and eating only fish food for too long, Seaking finds itself with not many other options to choose from. In times of peril, Seaking might want to jump out of its fish bowl or pond with Bounce, which hits Grass-types super effectively. However, since Seaking can already jab them with its sharp Megahorn or freeze them with a gust of Ice Beam, Seaking is usually better off not Bouncing out of its cozy home. If it feels cheeky, it can even coat its horn with toxic material, puncturing those weeds or Grass-types with Poison Jab. In all cases, Megahorn is the better option even though it does not have perfect accuracy, causing Seaking to occasionally launch itself into the glass bowl, shattering it into hundreds of pieces. If the goldfish is hungry for power, Choice Band can be used to bolster its physical attacks, allowing it to drown its foe with reasonably strong Waterfalls. To flee from faster foes, Seaking can use Agility to boost its miserable Speed. However, it's not as if Seaking is going anywhere outside the speed limit of its round fish bowl; it isn't incredibly fast after an Agility anyway. The poor old goldfish is just happy with what it has, and isn't too greedy with its other options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>While Lightning Rod means that you can no longer make sashimi out of Seaking with Electric-type attacks, the goldfish still has many checks that can turn it into a sushi. Grass-types can easily pack Seaking into a California roll. For example, Leafeon can chop it into many pieces with Leaf Blade, although it has to watch out for Ice Beam. Opposing Water-types can use Seaking as setup bait. Gorebyss and Carracosta have huge Defense stats to laugh at whatever moves Seaking bothers to use and can set up Shell Smash. Any reasonably strong attacker can easily down Seaking and make fish cake out of it due to its horrible defenses; Seaking can't even make good use of its single weakness. Almost any neutral attack can 2HKO it, and it doesn't have to be super effective either. Pretty much anything that isn't hit super effectively by Seaking is a great check to it. All that's important is to not forget that Seaking has Lightning Rod, letting it sponge any and all Electric-type attacks. Seaking is such an exploitable Pokemon in NU, and it's probably better for it to stay in its fish bowl than to come out of its Poke Ball.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>This is probably Seaking's best (and only) viable set. Holding a Life Orb is Seaking's only way to go on the offensive. Waterfall is Seaking's best STAB move, having the highest damage output of all Seaking's other choices. Megahorn is particularly useful, hitting the ever common Exeggutor 4x super effectively while also denting Hypno. Return is pretty much the next best move that Seaking has and provides decent neutral coverage. Other than these three, there aren't really other viable moves to consider for Seaking. Having no physical Ice-type attack, Seaking has to make use of Ice Beam for additional coverage, which is backed by an abysmal base 65 Special Attack. Ice Beam's sole purpose is to nail Altaria and Torterra. Lightning Rod grants Seaking an immunity to Electric and also boosts its Special Attack when it's hit by an Electric-type move. While its main benefit is to allow Seaking to switch into Electric-type attacks without fear, the boosted Special Attack is helpful to power up Ice Beam slightly.</p> <p>Maximum Attack EVs and a Lonely nature are used to make the most out of Seaking's best stat. 160 Speed EVs allow Seaking to outpace Adamant Torterra, blasting a freezing Ice Beam before the latter can retaliate with a Grass-type attack. The remaining EVs are dropped into Special Attack to give Ice Beam some extra power, especially when Seaking's base Special Attack is horrible enough. Life Orb is a compulsory item for Seaking, as it needs all the power it can get. Lightning Rod is the ability of choice to cut down Seaking's weaknesses to nothing but Grass. However, Swift Swim is a viable alternative if Seaking is used on rain teams and you aren't afraid of Electric-type attacks. If you feel that Waterfall is not powerful enough, Aqua Tail can be used for slightly more power in exchange for accuracy. Hydro Pump is a nice alternative to Return for another STAB move, as it also becomes more powerful if Lightning Rod activates, increasing Lightning Rod's utility. Seaking often finds itself walled by opposing Water-types as it lacks the brute strength to muscle its way through them. A Grass-type of your own is useful to get rid of bulky Water-types. Teammates such as Cacturne and Torterra can easily pulverize Water-types that Seaking often attracts. Furthermore, Cacturne can set up Spikes while Torterra can set up Stealth Rock. Grass-types, such as Leafeon, will also often trouble Seaking with their STAB attacks. Charizard is a great teammate as well, as it can roast those pesky Grass-types into crisps. Teammates that attract Electric-type attacks are also great to make full use of Seaking's Lightning Rod, such as the aforementioned Charizard. Swellow is another good example, as it can U-turn out from an expected Electric-type attack and switch into Seaking, who can take it with impunity.</p>"

  "Electabuzz": {
    "overview": "<p>Electabuzz faces a lot of competition from other fast Electric-types, such as Zebstrika and Electrode. Although both are faster, Electabuzz is more powerful, allowing it to hit harder while still gaining momentum with Volt Switch. Its superior coverage, most notably Focus Blast, gives Electabuzz an easier time against many of the Pokemon that threaten it. VoltTurn and offensive teams are where it feels at home. Unfortunately, Electabuzz is vulnerable to all entry hazards and has no reliable recovery, leaving it to be easily worn down. It also struggles to break through prominent special walls such as Lickilicky and Regice, while Ground-types can easily switch in on predicted Electric-type attacks. Despite its drawbacks, Electabuzz is great at gaining momentum and revenge killing.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Electabuzz has access to a few interesting coverage options that help deal with some troublesome Pokemon. One of the more prominent of the coverage moves is Signal Beam. This move hits all the threatening Psychic-types in the tier, such as Musharna and Gardevoir, for super effective damage, as well as most Grass-types that resist Electabuzz's STAB. Another option for a moveslot is Psychic. Psychic helps Electabuzz with Fighting-types like Sawk, Primeape, and Gurdurr while also dealing with Muk, which otherwise checks Electabuzz fairly efficiently. Charge Beam can be used in conjunction with Substitute for an interesting boosting set. Substitute in general is a useful move to use on Electabuzz, as using it on a switch eases prediction and enables Electabuzz to freely hit whatever your opponent brings. However, it means that Electabuzz will have to forfeit Volt Switch, one of the most useful moves for it to use. Focus Punch can also be used with Substitute as Electabuzz is the only Electric-type with access to the move in NU, but it doesn't hit very hard coming off of Electabuzz's middling Attack stat. A full-on physical set is an option that could be utilized with moves such as Wild Charge, Cross Chop, and Dual Chop, but again, Electabuzz's low base Attack stat leaves much to be desired. Life Orb might seem like a good choice for an item, as it boosts Electabuzz's power considerably, but Eviolite and Choice Scarf are generally more useful. Toxic can be useful to wear down opposing walls such as Electabuzz struggles to break through. Electabuzz can take special hits better by using Light Screen, which can also be used to raise the Special Defense of your teammates, giving them an easier time setting up, but this is a job best left to other Pokemon. Another cool support move is Thunder Wave, which opens up a potential sweep for a slower teammate. Rain Dance is a useful support move, but it has the disadvantage of losing Eviolite if it wants to use Damp Rock. Rain Dance also has the benefit of giving Electabuzz a 100% accurate Thunder.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Almost any decently powerful Ground-type move will do quite a bit to Electabuzz, if not OHKO it. Ground-types such as Piloswine or Golurk are immune to Electabuzz's STAB and can hit hard with Earthquake. These same Ground-type Pokemon prevent it from using Volt Switch and force the Electabuzz user to predict better. One of the best Electabuzz counters is Camerupt. It can take any hit Electabuzz has to offer and hit it back hard with its Ground-type STAB or set up Stealth Rock. Any specially bulky Pokemon, such as Roselia, Lickilicky, and Regice, will do well against Electabuzz. Gurdurr can tank any hit and retaliate with a Drain Punch, recovering most of the damage dealt. Mach Punch can also be used to finish off Electabuzz when it's at low health. Any strong STAB moves will do a good chunk of damage, as Electabuzz isn't particularly bulky, especially when it's holding Choice Scarf instead of Eviolite. For example, Sawk, Tauros, and Kangaskhan can do a lot of damage with their powerful STAB attacks. Paralyzing Electabuzz cripples it severely, hindering its great Speed. It isn't hard to wear Electabuzz down either due to its lack of recovery, so once its health is low enough, any decently strong priority move can finish it off with ease. Opposing pure Electric-types such as Eelektross and Ampharos can cause trouble for Electabuzz, as they can take any hit and hit back hard with Flamethrower or Focus Blast, respectively.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Eviolite": {
        "description": "<p>In a metagame with prominent Water- and Flying-types, Electabuzz is a great choice for a teamslot. With a solid base 105 Speed and decent bulk, Electabuzz can switch into attacks from Braviary, Samurott, or Alomomola, and proceed to outspeed and dent them with a Thunderbolt. Electabuzz does particularly well against SubBU Braviary. It is a great choice if you are looking to add a momentum grabber to your team, thanks to its nice stats and coverage moves. Eviolite makes Electabuzz rather bulky so it can take some hits while hitting back hard. Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice give Electabuzz great neutral coverage, which is only resisted in NU by Piloswine and Rotom-F. Focus Blast takes care of both Pokemon while dealing super effective damage to special walls and tanks such as Lickilicky and Regice.</p> <p>Hidden Power Grass is an option over Hidden Power Ice in order to deal more damage to Seismitoad and give Electabuzz a more reliable way to pick off a weakened Piloswine, but then it loses coverage against Roselia and Vileplume. In terms of teammates, Choice Band Sawk and Golurk are both fantastic partners to Electabuzz, as both knock down many of the special walls that give it trouble. Golurk is also useful in stopping the opposition from utilizing Volt Switches of their own. Another useful Pokemon to pair with Electabuzz is Musharna. Electabuzz is able to deal with Pokemon that give Musharna trouble, such as Skuntank and Mandibuzz, while Volt Switch gives Musharna momentum to set up. Musharna can also Baton Pass its Calm Mind boosts to Electabuzz, opening up the possibility for a sweep. Wish support is appreciated from Pokemon such as Alomomola, Audino, and Lickilicky because of Electabuzz's vulnerability to entry hazards and lack of recovery.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Giving Electabuzz a Choice Scarf enables it to outspeed the entire unboosted tier as well as most other Choice Scarf users. With a super fast Volt Switch, Electabuzz can gain momentum for your team very easily. Unfortunately, the lack of recovery and vulnerability to entry hazards is very prominent on this set due to the lack of bulk without Eviolite. Regardless, this set hits every Pokemon in the tier, bar Shedinja, for neutral damage and is excellent for revenge killing. Thunderbolt offers a more reliable STAB move for when Electabuzz wants to stay in and keep attacking, while Hidden Power Ice is used to cover almost every Pokemon that its STAB does not. Focus Blast patches up the few holes in Electabuzz's coverage, hitting Thick Fat Piloswine and Rotom-Frost for super effective damage, as well as nailing most special walls and tanks such as Lickilicky and Regice.</p> <p>Wallbreakers such as Sawk can easily deal with threatening defensive Pokemon such as Regice and Lickilicky. Pokemon that deal with Ground-types are useful to Electabuzz, as the removal of Ground-types allows Electabuzz to gain momentum more easily and eases prediction. Musharna is an excellent partner to take on many physical attackers and provide a slow Baton Pass to gain momentum. Wish support is highly appreciated because of Electabuzz's vulnerability to entry hazards and lack of recovery. It is especially helpful with this set, as Electabuzz will be doing a lot more switching. A Timid nature is recommended over Modest, as it ensures that Electabuzz outspeeds Choice Scarf Primeape and Charizard.</p>"

  "Magmar": {
    "overview": "<p>Magmar is not a very traditional choice for a Fire-type in NU, and it's not hard to see why. The existence of Charizard—a stronger, faster, and more versatile threat—makes it difficult for Magmar to succeed, and it struggles to set itself apart from its competition. Luckily, not all is lost for Magmar; it sports a fair amount of bulk thanks to Eviolite, allowing it to tank hits better than its Fire-type brethren. This combined with Magmar's useful ability, Vital Spirit, gives Magmar a niche as a counter to the various Grass-types of the tier, absorbing Sleep Powder thanks to Vital Spirit and threatening them with a Fire-type move. It is also one of the more notable checks to Jynx, capably tanking any hit aside from Life Orb-boosted Psychic or Psyshock and OHKOing in return. That being said, Magmar is still a poor choice on many teams for a reason: its decent bulk is severely hampered by its bad defensive typing and lack of reliable recovery (even Charizard gets Roost). All in all, Magmar is a solid performer in NU, but never dismiss your other options before using it, as they will likely perform far better than Magmar ever will.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Magmar has a relatively expansive movepool, but sadly, most of its other options are outclassed by something else. It can choose to go on a more offensive route with Life Orb or Choice Specs, but this is sorely outclassed by Charizard, which is both stronger, faster, and boasts an additional Flying-type STAB. In a similar vein, Choice Scarf is a poor item choice, as Magmar falls just short of the popular base 95 Speed of common Choice Scarf users and as a result is often an inferior option. It can opt to use its other ability, Flame Body, to make physical attackers think twice before attacking it, but Vital Spirit has more overall utility and Magmar already has Will-O-Wisp to burn physical attackers. Toxic can cripple walls, but it's generally not as useful as Will-O-Wisp in the long run. Psychic can be used, but it doesn't really add much to Magmar's coverage. Magmar has a solid physical movepool with gems such as Flare Blitz, Cross Chop, Thunder Punch, and Mach Punch while also having a satisfactory base 95 Attack to back it up; it even has Belly Drum to set up. While all this might sound appealing on paper, it's extremely difficult to pull off in practice, and Magmar suffers many move illegalities among these moves as well. Likewise, a mixed set also might sound decent on paper, but all it really ends up doing is splitting Magmar's offenses and hindering its bulk with a Defense-lowering nature. Flame Charge can boost Magmar's Speed, but Magmar isn't a suitable sweeper. Finally, Magmar can set up Sunny Day for itself and its teammates, but it's once again outclassed by Charizard, which can utilize Solar Power along with the sun.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Magmar isn't very difficult to counter, as it's not excessively strong and lacks reliable recovery. Bulky Water-types, such as Alomomola, Samurott, and Ludicolo, all can comfortably tank a Hidden Power Grass and threaten back with their STABs. Fire-types also have little to fear from Magmar; Charizard in particular resists all of Magmar's common moves, can Roost off the damage, and dent it with Air Slash. Ground- and Rock-types can easily crush Magmar with their STABs. Camerupt gets a special mention with its immunity to Will-O-Wisp and resistance to Flamethrower. Most special walls, such as Lickilicky and Audino, counter Magmar effectively, as they can tank even Focus Blast and Wish off the damage. Bulky Dragon-types such as Altaria, Dragonair, and Zweilous are also solid answers to Magmar, but Zweilous must watch out for Focus Blast. Residual damage severely limits Magmar's longevity—its weakness to all forms of entry hazards isn't doing it any favors, either. Finally, despite Magmar's good bulk, strong attacks such as Sawk's Close Combat and Braviary's Brave Bird can still pummel it to the ground.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Eviolite Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set is Magmar's best way to set itself apart from the likes of Charizard, as it takes advantage of its Eviolite-boosted bulk and Vital Spirit. Magmar is played as a bit of a bulky offensive supporter, providing a decent switch-in to Grass-types and Jynx and OHKOing in return with Flamethrower. Focus Blast is Magmar's primary coverage move, denting Rock-types such as Regirock and providing solid overall coverage. Hidden Power Grass is Magmar's best option against bulky Water-types such as Alomomola and Seismitoad; it is also notable for damaging the likes of Carracosta and Golem without Focus Blast's miss chance. Finally, Will-O-Wisp adds a bit to Magmar's supportive qualities, burning physical attackers and patching up Magmar's lackluster Defense. On the other hand, Substitute can be used to help ease prediction, but keep in mind that Magmar often wears itself down rather quickly between both Stealth Rock and Substitute damage.</p> <p>The given EV spread accomplishes a few things. Firstly, 60 Speed EVs are used to outspeed minimum Speed Miltank. 200 HP EVs give Magmar a total of 321 HP, letting it switch in to Stealth Rock four times without dying. Finally, the rest is put into Special Attack with a Modest nature to power up Magmar's attacks. This EV spread is fairly customizable; for example, an alternative spread of 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe coupled with a Timid nature maximizes Magmar's offensive potential, letting Magmar pose as a larger overall threat. However, this detracts from its bulk, which is its main selling point over Charizard. Likewise, a bulkier spread with investment in Special Defense allows Magmar to tank a fair few more hits; sadly, this does not work well with both Magmar's lack of recovery and poor defensive typing, and it loses power by doing so. Fire Blast and Lava Plume can be considered over Flamethrower as a Fire-type STAB, with the former boasting a higher Base Power and the latter having a higher chance to burn the opposition. However, Flamethrower is the most consistent out of the three. Finally, Hidden Power Ice and Rock are two potential options over Hidden Power Grass, as they both hit Altaria for super effective damage, and the latter also scores an OHKO on Charizard. However, hitting Water-types is far more important, making Hidden Power Grass the superior option most of the time.</p> <p>As Magmar lacks reliable recovery, Wish passers are highly recommended to help make up for that. Alomomola is unarguably the best candidate for this role, as it can pass massive Wishes to Magmar while also benefiting greatly from Magmar's ability to remove Grass-types from the field. In general, most Pokemon that dislike Grass-types enjoy Magmar's services; Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-types are just a few examples of Pokemon that appreciate Magmar's support, and they can also break down the Rock-types that Magmar struggles to beat.</p>"

  "Pinsir": {
    "overview": "<p>Pinsir's combination of a high Attack stat, great coverage, and incredible abilities for its role makes it a premier physical sweeper in NU. For these same reasons, Pinsir is very difficult to wall, especially when considering that some of the more common physical walls, such as Musharna and Tangela, are weak to its STAB. Thanks to its Defense, which is rather high for an offensive Pokemon, Pinsir is also able to set up against some of the most common Pokemon in the tier, including Golurk, Piloswine, and Choice Scarf Primeape. In addition, Pinsir is fairly fast, allowing it to outspeed most of the important walls in the tier. Unfortunately, its Speed can also be a major detriment; while base 85 Speed allows it to outpace common walls and tanks, it's not quite enough to beat many of the tier's premier offensive threats. Pinsir also faces stiff competition as a Bug-type physical sweeper from Scolipede, which has much greater Speed and comparable power thanks to its stronger STAB move. Ultimately however, Pinsir still sets itself apart with its access to priority and two great abilities that can help it beat certain Pokemon that Scolipede struggles to defeat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While the above sets are the best ways to use Pinsir, it does have some other options at its disposal. First off, a powerful Choice Band set can be used to hit hard off the bat, and it can be effective thanks to Mold Breaker ignoring abilities such as Levitate and Sturdy. A Swords Dance Salac Berry set can also be used; however, such a set would be completely useless without the Salac Berry boost and thus would be easy to revenge kill. A set with Endure and Reversal is a pretty flashy idea, but in practice, it's very unreliable, especially because such a set would struggle to beat any Ghost-type Pokemon in the tier. For this same reason, a set using Substitute and Focus Punch would be difficult to use successfully. Pinsir also has access to another boosting move, Bulk Up, but Swords Dance further enhances Pinsir's immediate offensive presence and is preferred because of how much easier it is to set up. A Stealth Rock set is another neat idea as Pinsir's ability to force switches provides free opportunities to set it up, but its lead matchup against most other Stealth Rock users is bleak. Finally, Pinsir has access to Knock Off, which can be used to cripple Eviolite users, such as Misdreavus and Piloswine. It might be difficult to find a slot to run it, but if you can, Knock Off can be a very effective move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>While Pinsir's great physical strength is unable to be ignored, some Pokemon are able to take it down and wall its attacks with relative ease. Ghost-type Pokemon, such as Misdreavus and Golurk, are typically the best ones for the job, as they resist Pinsir's STAB and are hit neutrally at best by its coverage moves. The former is able to burn Pinsir with Will-O-Wisp, crippling it for the rest of the match, while the latter can take any hit before a Swords Dance boost and threaten back with a powerful Shadow Punch. Even so, both must be wary of taking a +2 Earthquake from Mold Breaker variants, as it does a massive amount damage to Misdreavus and will KO Golurk after Stealth Rock. Alomomola can beat Choice Scarf Pinsir by stalling it out with Toxic, Wish, and Protect, though Swords Dance Pinsir can 2HKO Alomomola with +2 X-Scissor. Regirock, Armaldo, and Metang can all take a hit from Pinsir, while the first two can strike back with their super effective STAB, and Metang can take out a Pinsir that has taken some prior damage with Meteor Mash and Bullet Punch. Because Pinsir is fairly slow, the easiest way to take it out is by revenge killing it. Most of the faster Pokemon that can take a +2 Quick Attack can easily take out Pinsir's Swords Dance set; Haunter is immune to Quick Attack, while Rotom-A and Tauros can both survive one. The Choice Scarf set is more difficult to revenge kill, but most faster Choice Scarf users are able to handle it. Charizard, Primeape, and Rotom-S all outspeed it with a Choice Scarf and have super effective STABs to hit it with. Kangaskhan is able to revenge kill either set, taking care of the Choice Scarf set with the combination of Fake Out and Sucker Punch and the Swords Dance set with Double-Edge.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Pinsir's most effective set is that of a boosting sweeper, utilizing either of its great abilities and Swords Dance to help muscle past entire teams and even some of the tier's most dominant defensive threats. After a Swords Dance boost, Pinsir's power becomes massive, hitting a whopping 766 Attack. X-Scissor is Pinsir's best STAB, and it helps defeat a variety of common physical walls, such as Musharna and Tangela, which other sweepers in the tier struggle to take down. Earthquake takes out the Steel-, Fire-, and Poison-type Pokemon that resist Pinsir's STAB. Finally, Quick Attack is used to help defeat common Choice Scarf users, such as Jynx, Primeape, and Charizard, which would all be able to otherwise easily revenge kill Pinsir.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is used on this set, as the only important Pokemon that a Jolly nature allows Pinsir to outspeed are base 80 and 85 Speed Pokemon with a positive Speed nature, which are relatively rare. Life Orb is the best item for the set, as it allows Pinsir to attain OHKOs against certain Pokemon such as max HP Golurk and helps increase its immediate offensive presence. However, Lum Berry is a very viable alternative on Mold Breaker sets to lure in and defeat Misdreavus that try to use Will-O-Wisp to cripple Pinsir. The ability you use mainly depends on what you want Pinsir's role to be on your team. With Moxie, Pinsir makes a great cleaner, as once it has a Swords Dance and Moxie boost under its belt, very few Pokemon can withstand it. Slower Pokemon fall to its STAB and coverage move, while faster Pokemon are typically frail enough to take out with Quick Attack. However, with Mold Breaker, Pinsir can be used as a wallbreaker by utilizing Earthquake to take out Pokemon with Levitate, such as Misdreavus and Weezing, that wall Moxie Pinsir.</p> <p>Pinsir greatly appreciates Stealth Rock support to help it achieve an OHKO at +2 against Swellow and Charizard with Quick Attack and against Lickilicky with X-Scissor. Stealth Rock support is also useful in wearing down the Flying-types that Pinsir struggles to beat. Regirock makes a good partner for this reason and more, as it can not only set up Stealth Rock, but it can also tank Normal-, Flying-, and Fire-type attacks and spread paralysis to give Pinsir an easier time when attempting a sweep. Spikes support is also helpful to allow Pinsir to OHKO Piloswine and defensive Seismitoad; Garbodor can set up Spikes while Pinsir can defeat the Psychic-type Pokemon that threaten it. While Alomomola is unable to wall Pinsir completely, it can survive a hit at +2 and use Toxic against it, which when combined with Life Orb recoil, greatly hampers Pinsir's ability to sweep. Because of this, strong special attackers, such as Ludicolo and Eelektross, are good partners to help take it out. Finally, because Flying-type Pokemon wall this set, offensive Electric- and Ice-type Pokemon can be used to deal with them; Rotom-A and Jynx are good examples of Pokemon that fulfill this role.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>With a Choice Scarf and Moxie, Pinsir becomes a dangerous revenge killer and late-game cleaner. Basically, if this set can revenge kill one Pokemon, it can often heavily damage or sweep the rest thanks to its effective +1 boost to both Speed and Attack. X-Scissor is used on this set for STAB, and it does a great deal of damage to Psychic- and Grass-type sweepers, such as Musharna and Serperior. Close Combat does great damage to many of the Pokemon that don't mind taking an X-Scissor, such as Piloswine and Probopass. Stone Edge hits the Flying- and Bug-type Pokemon that don't mind taking a hit from the rest of the set. Finally, Earthquake patches up Pinsir's coverage, hitting Poison-type Pokemon for super effective damage.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is preferred on this set, as the only noteworthy Pokemon that a Jolly nature enables it to outspeed are +2 Modest Gorebyss and base 80 Speed Pokemon with a positive Speed nature wielding a Choice Scarf, which are generally rare. A Moxie set with Life Orb and four attacks is another viable option, as the easiest way to wall Pinsir is typically to switch into something that resists whatever move it locks itself into. Because this set is pretty easy to wall before it attains a Moxie boost, it tends to cause many switches, especially into the Flying- and Fire-types that resist its STAB. For this reason, Stealth Rock support is really helpful to aid Pinsir in wearing down its checks and counters. Offensive Stealth Rock users, such as Seismitoad and Golem, can be used in order to help keep up offensive momentum throughout the game and share good offensive synergy with Pinsir. Most physical walls in the tier also give this set troubles, so wallbreakers are great to help take care of them. Mixed Eelektross, Swords Dance Charizard, and Gothorita can all be used to help with this. Finally, Pinsir is quite vulnerable to faster Choice Scarf users that can revenge kill it, such as Primeape, Charizard, and Jynx; Kangaskhan makes a good partner, as it can defeat these Pokemon with priority attacks.</p>"

  "Tauros": {
    "overview": "<p>Tauros is a straightforward, dangerous physical attacker in NU, capable of threatening a wide variety of teams. The reason for this should be fairly obvious—it's one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, packs plenty of power, and has a good amount of coverage in its decent movepool. This is combined with an excellent ability in Sheer Force, which pushes its attacking prowess even further, and it has ways to work around Pokemon that other Normal-types would typically struggle with. Tauros's main flaw is that it usually struggles with prominent physical walls. It also has competition with Kangaskhan, who has Scrappy and several priority moves to work with.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Even though Tauros has a relatively generous movepool, most of it is unusable, and it lacks very many other options. Despite its terrible Special Attack, Sheer Force allows it to use Fire Blast and Thunder to 2HKO Tangela and Alomomola. However, these moves have limited use outside of this because they do not inflict a lot of damage against most targets, and Thunder in particular has horrid accuracy. Iron Head is boosted by Sheer Force and hits Rock-types harder than anything else Tauros has, but its coverage otherwise is fairly bad, making Earthquake the superior option most of the time. Earthquake also hits Steel-types such as Metang much harder than Iron Head. Tauros's only setup option is Work Up, but in the end, a +1 boost is rarely enough to take advantage of, especially for a Pokemon that rarely has space to run it. Wild Charge can OHKO Drifblim and deals a heavy blow on other Flying-types and doesn't have any chance of missing, but the recoil damage can be fairly annoying. Finally, Tauros can utilize a Choice Band with Intimidate to make a decent offensive pivot, but with Sheer Force canceling out Life Orb recoil on most moves, the main advantage of Choice Band is somewhat wasted. In fact, because of its reliance on Double-Edge, a Choice Band set often takes more recoil damage than a Life Orb set!</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Tauros has several ways to get around many Pokemon that would usually counter it, leaving few Pokemon that can reliably take on all variants. Any Misdreavus with Foul Play over Shadow Ball is the best way to take on Tauros, as it is immune to its STAB, can burn it with Will-O-Wisp, and has an attack that can break its Substitutes. It also has Heal Bell to take any surprise Toxics. Golurk is also immune to Normal-type attacks and isn't weak to anything Tauros has. It can hit back hard with Drain Punch and Earthquake. Although Gurdurr is 2HKOed by Zen Headbutt, it has Drain Punch to heal off the damage and get out of range of this, Mach Punch to finish Tauros off, and the bulk to switch into any other attack. Alomomola can wall Tauros almost completely and stall it out due to Wish, and it can usually break its Substitutes with Waterfall. Additionally, recoil from Double-Edge takes a large toll on Tauros due to Alomomola's high HP. It must be careful around Endeavor, although Regenerator and Wish help it regain lost HP. Tangela is in a similar boat in regards to walling, although its Giga Drain will always break Tauros's Substitutes.</p> <p>There exist more shaky checks to Tauros that need to be careful around coverage moves or Endeavor due to lack of reliable recovery. Regirock is a prime example of this despite being able to cripple Tauros with Thunder Wave and wear it down with Drain Punch while keeping itself healthy. It has a high enough Defense to sponge an Earthquake, but it still must be careful around Tauros. Defensive variants of Carracosta have Solid Rock to mitigate damage from Earthquake and can wear down Tauros over time. Weezing gets 2HKOed by Zen Headbutt, but it can wall Tauros otherwise and burn it with Will-O-Wisp. Finally, Tauros can be revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Swellow and Choice Scarf Primeape, although this is only if Tauros doesn't have a Choice Scarf of its own and isn't behind a Substitute.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<p>This is the set Tauros is best known for, offering impressive coverage that is augmented by its high Attack and Speed. Like any other Pokemon that utilizes Sheer Force, Tauros has the advantage of ignoring Life Orb recoil while still obtaining all the benefits of the item, meaning outpredicting it will not wear it down as quickly as other Pokemon. Rock Climb is the strongest STAB move Tauros gets that is affected by Sheer Force, and is thus used on this set. Although not boosted by the ability, Earthquake is essential for coverage against Steel- and Rock-types. Zen Headbutt gets a super effective hit on Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and is the only way Tauros can hit most of the Ghost-types in the tier, including Haunter, Misdreavus, and Drifblim. Zen Headbutt also gets the bonus of 2HKOing Weezing. Because the above three moves offer excellent coverage, Tauros has room to run Substitute. With a Substitute, it can ease prediction and protect itself from status, as well as defeat defensive variants of Misdreavus without Foul Play as it is immune to Misdreavus's Ghost STAB. Substitute also allows Tauros to avoid revenge killers and hit them hard before they are able to damage it.</p> <p>Tauros should always run maximum Speed and a Jolly nature in order to take advantage of its excellent Speed stat, as it outspeeds all but a handful of NU Pokemon. Because Rock Climb's imperfect accuracy can be fairly annoying at times, Return is a suitable replacement, although note that it is not only weaker, but also causes Tauros to take recoil damage from its Life Orb. Rock Slide could be used over Zen Headbutt to hit Drifblim harder and get a very strong hit on foes such as Braviary, but Zen Headbutt and Rock Climb already hit both targets very hard, respectively, and without Zen Headbutt, Tauros becomes much more vulnerable to Gurdurr, Weezing, and Throh.</p> <p>Despite the fact that it has Zen Headbutt, the most common Fighting-types in the tier are still threats to Tauros. This is because Gurdurr and Throh have the bulk to take a hit and retaliate, while Primeape, and to a lesser extent Sawk, often utilize Choice Scarf, allowing them to outspeed and OHKO Tauros with Close Combat. Bulky Psychic-types such as Musharna can wall and defeat a majority of the Fighting-types in the tier, while Ghost-types such as Misdreavus are immune to their STAB moves and can burn them, although note that a few of them have Guts as an ability. In an unlikely scenario in which Tauros gets afflicted by a status condition and has its offensive prowess severely cut, both of them also have Heal Bell. Many prominent physical walls, such as Alomomola and Tangela, have a relatively easy time dealing with Tauros as a result of it not having any way to cripple them. Sawsbuck and Electabuzz are capable of defeating both of them; Sawsbuck absorbs a majority of Tangela's attacks thanks to Sap Sipper and can hit Alomomola hard with Horn Leech, while Electabuzz's Electric STAB and Vital Spirit allow it to take on both walls as well. Finally, although Tauros has Earthquake, most Rock-types can take a hit or two thanks to their extremely high Defense stats and potentially defeat it. This makes Tangela a good partner, taking on Rock-type attacks with its high Defense and dispatching them with Giga Drain. Tangela also does well against Golurk, who is another Pokemon that threatens Tauros.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Although it might seem like a waste to give a Choice Scarf to a Pokemon as fast as Tauros, this excessive Speed is in large part why it makes such an effective Choice Scarf user. Because Tauros is so fast, it can afford to run an Adamant nature and still be capable of revenge killing weather sweepers. More importantly, however, even Adamant Tauros can outspeed almost all other prominent Choice Scarf users in the tier, most notably ones at base 95 Speed, such as Primeape and Haunter. Double-Edge is the strongest reliable STAB Tauros has, and it is the move it will be using in nearly every situation. Earthquake is primarily for hitting Rock- and Steel-types who can switch into Double-Edge, for a solid amount of damage. Stone Edge allows Tauros to OHKO Drifblim, and it is the best option it has against Misdreavus. The final move is used for specific situations. Pursuit practically checkmates Gardevoir, Haunter, and Kadabra to an extent, OHKOing them if they switch out and still dealing a substantial amount of damage even if they don't. Retaliate, on the other hand, is an interesting option that goes well with Tauros's role as a revenge killer—it usually finishes off the opponent in this case due to its high power. Note that neither move is particularly good to be locked into though, however, as both are fairly weak most of the time.</p> <p>Although Adamant is the preferred nature for this particular Tauros, a Jolly nature allows it to outspeed the few Pokemon that can possibly outspeed it otherwise, including Choice Scarf Charizard and Modest Choice Scarf Zebstrika, as well as Timid Victreebel and Ludicolo in their respective weathers. Intimidate is the only ability that Tauros can benefit from on this set and does offer it a few additional switch-ins. Return could be used in the last moveslot for an alternative STAB move, or even over Double-Edge, although the power drop is notable. Toxic is useful in the case of a predicted switch into a Pokemon that Tauros struggles against; Rock-types, Golurk, Misdreavus, Tangela, and Alomomola do not enjoy getting poisoned, but it is a rather bad move to get locked into and relies almost completely on prediction.</p> <p>Ghost-types are particularly dangerous against this set because Double-Edge is usually used more than other moves, and many also do not mind Tauros's other moves. Skuntank is a good partner as a result, as it can do a good job against them thanks to Pursuit and its arsenal of other Dark-type moves, although it must be careful around Golurk due to Earthquake. Steel- and Rock-types will also often get free switch-ins due to Tauros's reliance on Double-Edge, and they typically have Defense stats high enough to tank its attacks. Due to this, strong Fighting-types such as Sawk make good partners, as they can power through most of them with their STAB moves. Finally, Alomomola and Tangela can switch into anything Tauros has other than Toxic and wall it entirely, so Pokemon that can deal with both of these, such as Electabuzz, make good teammates.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Endeavor": {
        "description": "<p>Although this set might look somewhat gimmicky at first, it makes Tauros an excellent lure for Pokemon that would typically wall it with ease, opening up the way for other sweepers to have a much easier time. The goal of this set is to use Substitute as many times as possible, and then use Endeavor to bring the opponent down to very low HP, leaving it able to be finished off by just about any move and irreparably damaged if it lacks recovery. Among the Pokemon that this set can wear down immensely are Regirock, Carracosta, and Metang. To an extent, it can also wear down Pokemon such as Alomomola and Tangela as well, although they have recovery to compensate for the loss of HP. This set is still capable of doing damage to its foes outside of this strategy—Rock Climb alongside Sheer Force and a Life Orb is still strong enough to make it a hard-hitting physical attacker. Finally, Zen Headbutt is the best move Tauros has to hit Ghost-types, which are immune to Endeavor.</p> <p>8 HP EVs are used in order to allow Tauros to make four Substitutes while at full health, with the last one leaving it with 1 HP remaining. Sheer Force and a Life Orb is recommended so that Tauros does not depend too much on Endeavor to deal damage. Leftovers is a subpar option to restore HP lost using Substitute, allowing it to cripple a few extra foes, as this is somewhat counterproductive due to Endeavor. With Leftovers, be sure to use Intimidate and Return in order to maximize the damage output from Tauros's Normal STAB. Earthquake is also a decent option in order to hit Steel- and Rock-types hard; however, it will not come in handy too often because Endeavor already cripples them, and Earthquake forces Tauros to take recoil damage from Life Orb, unlike Zen Headbutt.</p> <p>As this variant of Tauros is made to work around its typical counters, not very many partners are needed for it to function at its best. However, this set still struggles with Ghost-types because they are immune to Endeavor, so Skuntank support can come in handy due to its STAB Pursuit and other Dark-type moves. If there are entry hazards on the field, Tauros might no longer be able to make Substitutes at a higher than intended health, and if Toxic Spikes is on the field, it is practically incapable of doing its job. For this reason, a Rapid Spin user might be worth using—Torkoal and Armaldo in particular enjoy the absence of Rock-types because both are weak to their STAB. Finally, physical attackers that struggle with breaking through walls make good partners, as they can take advantage of Tauros's ability to remove them. Kangaskhan is a good example of this, as it can do a lot more damage without the opponent's Rock-type being able to easily switch into its Normal STAB, and it can hit Ghost-types thanks to Scrappy, making up for Tauros's inability to cripple them. Pokemon that struggle against Alomomola and Tangela, such as Gurdurr, also make good partners, but beware that, due to Regenerator and their instant recovery, Tauros will need to be able to do enough damage to finish them off before they recover their HP.</p>"

  "Lapras": {
    "overview": "<p>Lapras has access to Thunderbolt and a wonderful ability in Water Absorb, which grants it an immunity to Water-type attacks, allowing it to function as a great check to the myriad of Water-types lurking in the Neverused tier. Offensively, Lapras faces competition for a slot on the team from other Water-types such as Samurott and Seismitoad. However, Lapras can play the role of an offensive tank, especially with its decent bulk and BoltBeam coverage. Finally, Lapras's Ice typing allows it to check some threatening Ice-types. Lapras is a fair Pokemon in the tier as it can perform multiple roles decently; however, it isn't an amazing one either as it cannot perform any of them exceptionally well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A specially defensive set can be used for Lapras to take on Gorebyss and special Samurott. A physically defensive set can allow it to beat Swords Dance Samurott and Ground-types more easily. However, Walrein is more adept at this role due to its greater bulk and access to Encore.</p> <p>Lapras has a fair base 85 Attack and access to Dragon Dance, so it can run a physically offensive set with Waterfall, Ice Shard, and Drill Run as its attacking moves. However, its base 60 Speed leaves much to be desired, and it can be outsped and KOed by multiple Choice Scarf users even after a boost or two. Lapras can utilize a physical Curse set to take advantage of its great bulk, but its multitude of weaknesses to common attacking types such as Fighting and Grass makes it unable to set up safely. Lapras has access to Heal Bell and can act as a cleric, but such a role is generally done better by bulkier teammates such as Musharna and Audino. A set with Hydration and Rest may look cool at first sight, but Lapras will rarely stay in to take advantage of rain, as it is easily forced out due to its poor defensive typing.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As Ice is a poor defensive typing, Lapras has multiple weaknesses that make it easy to force out. Lapras's weakness to Stealth Rock and vulnerability to Spikes leave it severely weakened after a few switch-ins. Fast Pokemon with super effective STAB moves can force it out if they switch in safely: prime examples include Ludicolo, Electabuzz, Sawk, and Primeape. As Lapras can easily be worn down by Substitute, entry hazard damage (especially Toxic Spikes and Stealth Rock), and offensive pressure, care should be taken to minimize the amount of residual damage it takes. In general, Lapras is too slow to check offensive teams, yet lacks the power to break stall teams. Both of these team archetypes are able to handle Lapras easily.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Access to Thunderbolt and a STAB Ice Beam is Lapras's niche. Water Absorb is a great ability, granting Lapras an immunity to Water-type moves and restoring 25% of its health when hit by one. Thus, there is a great incentive to switch Lapras into a predicted Water-type attack so it can check the opponent. Lapras's great bulk lets it take on powerful Water- and Ice-types with ease, especially Samurott. Hydro Pump is an obvious STAB option and helps take down Fire-, Rock-, and Ground-type opponents such as Golem, Probopass, Torkoal, and Charizard. Thunderbolt is a great move that smashes the Water-types that Lapras checks, including Samurott and Alomomola. Ice Beam is used for defeating Grass-types that threaten Lapras, such as Roselia and Vileplume, and potentially KO them before they have a chance to strike back. Substitute is used to ease prediction on the Leftovers set and can also block status moves. Lapras can set up with Substitute against Alomomola or when it forces a switch. Frost Breath should only be used with Choice Specs, as it allows Lapras to break through opponents with Special Defense boosts thanks to its 100% critical hit rate.</p> <p>The 44 Speed EVs allow Lapras to outspeed Roselia and Alomomola, while the rest of the EVs are put into its bulk. Some EVs are invested into Lapras's defenses rather than its HP, as this results in an overall bulkier spread. Having an HP stat indivisible by four reduces the damage Lapras takes from Stealth Rock. With the given EVs, Lapras can survive two Life Orb-boosted Hidden Power Grasses from Samurott after Leftovers recovery, a +2 Megahorn after Stealth Rock damage, and even a +2 Life Orb-boosted Hidden Power Grass from Gorebyss given that it is at full HP. This is useful as one of Lapras's roles is to check offensive Water-types.</p> <p>Roselia and Garbodor are great teammates for Lapras, as they can provide entry hazard support and soak up Toxic Spikes, which cripple Lapras. Garbodor is a fantastic check to Fighting-types that threaten Lapras, while Roselia can take on Electric-types and fast Grass-types such as Serperior and Simisage. Rapid Spin support is nice to have for Lapras. Torkoal is the best spinner to pair with Lapras as it resists Grass-type moves, can spin away entry hazards, and can set up its own entry hazards. Meanwhile, Lapras can reliably take down the Water- and Ground-types that try to force Torkoal out with Toxic and Ice Beam, respectively. Some Ground-types such as Golem make for great teammates, as they are immune to Electric-type moves and can take Rock-type attacks aimed at Lapras. Furthermore, they can set up Stealth Rock to support the team. In return, Lapras can take Water- and Ice-type attacks for them. Sawk and Torterra deserve special mentions as partners for Lapras, as both have a resistance to Rock-type attacks and have the ability to prevent opposing entry hazards from being set up thanks to Mold Breaker and Bullet Seed, respectively. Meanwhile, Lapras can handle the Ice-type attacks that Torterra hates.</p>"

  "Ditto": {
    "overview": "<p>Ditto has been doing the same thing since its inception: transforming into its opponent. With Imposter, Ditto is able to copy the opposing Pokemon and its stat boosts almost flawlessly without wasting a turn setting up, allowing it to revenge kill setup sweepers, such as Shell Smash Gorebyss, Fraxure, Sawsbuck, and Shell Smash Carracosta. With a Choice Scarf attached, Ditto is guaranteed to outspeed those same offensive threats. Unfortunately, Ditto cannot copy the HP stat of its opponent, making it frailer than its target in most situations, as Ditto's fully invested HP stat is only equivalent to an uninvested base 79 HP stat. As it must carry a Choice Scarf, Ditto will always be limited to one move. As a result, Ditto has difficulty beating most setup sweepers, including Bulk Up Gurdurr and Braviary; and Swords Dance Samurott; and Calm Mind Serperior and Musharna, making it an inferior revenge-killer, the one job it can actually do. This also makes it difficult for Ditto to pull its weight against defensively oriented teams, as its power is in the hands of the opponent and the opponent can often plow through it. While Ditto can work, it's far too situational to fit on most teams, as there are too many revenge killers in NU that can do its job more reliably.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf is the only viable item on Ditto, as it guarantees that Ditto can outspeed setup sweepers. No other item can possibly replace the utility that Choice Scarf provides.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ditto is such a quirky Pokemon that there really is nothing that \"counters\" it in the traditional sense. The best way to \"counter\" Ditto is to stop it from taking advantage of your team's entry hazard setter or setup sweeper, which can be troublesome at times. The best way for offensive teams to deal with Ditto is for their setup sweeper to run a Substitute, as Ditto will not be able to transform when its target is behind one. Without a Substitute, it is too risky to use offensively orientated boosting moves. For balanced or stall teams, it is difficult to stop Ditto from coming in and taking advantage of your entry hazard setter or Rapid Spin user; however, Ditto will often be switching in and out throughout the course of the match, so setting up Stealth Rock at the beginning will help wear it down. Something to keep in mind is that when Ditto transforms, you know what moves it carries, so intelligent maneuvering and a little guesswork will help you defeat it. Unburden Pokemon such as Drifblim also deal well with Ditto, as Ditto will be unable to outspeed them because it does not copy its opponents' boosts from the ability. The most efficient way to combat Ditto starts before the beginning of the match; so long as your team has proper defensive synergy, Ditto will only be a minor nuisance.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Doppelganger": {
        "description": "<p>Using a Choice Scarf, Ditto will be guaranteed to outspeed almost every offensive threat that it comes into contact with. The only reason Transform is there is because Ditto needs to have a move; otherwise, it is completely useless. Despite how it might seem, Ditto isn't just limited to being a revenge killer. Thanks to Imposter, when Ditto transforms, it is able to attain knowledge of the opponent's moveset. This information can prove to be invaluable when dealing with unpredictable Pokemon, such as Golurk, Eelektross, and Samurott. In some cases, Ditto can even use moves such as Rapid Spin, Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Aromatherapy to its advantage, thus supporting its teammates. Oftentimes, Ditto's frailty makes it difficult for it to switch into a setup sweeper and take advantage of its boost, so wise prediction is necessary on your part to get it in safely. Even if Ditto does get the chance, do keep in mind that setup sweepers are rather uncommon in NU; even most offensive teams generally limit themselves to one.</p> <p>There are two things Ditto does not copy from the opponent—HP and IVs. HP is maximized for this reason. When transforming into an opponent that possess Hidden Power, the above IVs give Ditto Hidden Power Grass, the most useful for defeating Water-types that often carry Hidden Power, such as Gorebyss and Samurott, though it does leave Ditto setup bait to Sap Sipper and Grass-type Pokemon. Ditto can also change the IVs to 3 Atk / 30 SpA / 3 Spe to attain Hidden Power Electric so that it can reliably revenge kill Mantine and Charizard; however, Ground-types such as Golem will be able to do whatever they please against Ditto if it gets locked into it.</p> <p>Ditto will often be switching in and out throughout the course of the match, so Poison-types such as Skuntank and Garbodor pair well with Ditto in absorbing Toxic Spikes. Ditto pairs well with offensively orientated teams for two reasons. First, Ditto will be able to switch easily into Pokemon who are immune to their own attacks, such as Zebstrika and Sawsbuck. Second, Ditto cannot transform when a Pokemon is behind a Substitute, so offensive teammates such as Primeape and Ludicolo can put enough pressure on the opposition to the point where they will not be able to set up a Substitute.</p>"

  "Flareon": {
    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written around the time that BW was considered the main generation. The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW NU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>Flareon isn't a very fortunate Pokemon in NU, and it's not difficult to see why. Firstly, Flareon is vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards, specifically Stealth Rock, which means it must think twice before switching. Its movepool is very scarce, so it's fairly easy to predict which set it is running. Finally, Flareon's Speed holds it back from performing a sweep. With all of this taken into account, there doesn't seem to be much of a reason to use Flareon.</p> <p>Flareon's excellent base 110 Special Defense is that reason, and when paired with Wish, it gives Flareon the opportunity to function as both a special wall and supporter. Flareon's fantastic Attack stat catches the eye as well. Finally, Flareon has access to Flame Charge, which raises its Speed and also allows it to function as a wallbreaker or sweeper. Honestly, however, Flareon is a mediocre Pokemon, and it requires a bit of team support to be successful.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Fang is an option for a stronger physical STAB move. While Iron Tail offers great coverage, Superpower does a similar job and also has perfect accuracy. Will-O-Wisp can deal with physical attackers, but it rarely finds a spot on Flareon's moveset. Choice items can be used on Flareon, but due to its subpar bulk and lackluster Speed, it's generally outclassed by other Choice Fire-types, such as Rapidash. Life Orb can raise Flareon's power while keeping its versatility, but the recoil damage isn't desirable. Substitute and Yawn are also viable, as it can function as a bulky Substitute user that can force switches. RestTalk is also an option for Guts Flareon, but it's not that good. Curse is an option if you wish to improve Flareon's Attack and Defense, but it's also outclassed. Finally, Flareon can work on sun teams, playing best as a weather inducer, rather than as a sweeper.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Stealth Rock is a great way to weaken Flareon. Golem can not only set up Stealth Rock, but also annihilate Flareon with Stone Edge or Earthquake. Seismitoad is a great counter to Flareon as well, as it can handle both of its standard sets without difficulty. Piloswine also fares well against Flareon. Alomomola can 2HKO Flareon with Waterfall and is only 3HKOed by a Guts-boosted Facade. Swift Swim Ludicolo and Shell Smash Gorebyss can cleanly OHKO Guts Flareon with their Water-type attacks.</p> <p>There are many Pokemon that can easily defeat Flareon but dislike the chance of being burned. For example, Golurk is a great counter to the Wish set, as it takes little from Flareon's Lava Plume and OHKOes it in return with Earthquake. However, if its burned, Golurk will be rendered useless. Physical attackers and Choice Band users, such as Samurott, Life Orb Braviary, Choice Band Sawk, and Kangaskhan, can easily handle Flareon because of its low Defense stat. However, they must also be wary of a burn from Lava Plume. Gurdurr, on the other hand, can wall Flareon's attacks and can even take advantage of any status Flareon inflicts on it.</p> <p>Flareon is pretty slow even with maximum Speed investment, so many Choice Scarf users can outspeed and KO it. Tauros can outspeed and KO +1 max Speed neutral-natured Flareon even without a Choice Scarf. On its own, Flareon is not that difficult to defeat, as many teams carry at least one of Flareon's counters.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wish": {
        "description": "<p>Despite its bad defensive typing, Flareon can still take advantage of its excellent Special Defense. This set supports Flareon's teammates as a Wish passer and acts as a special wall. Flareon can also wall Fire-types, namely Charizard, along with other special attackers, such as Kadabra, Choice Specs Ampharos, and Gardevoir.</p> <p>Wish is the staple of the set, healing Flareon's teammates whenever it can. Wish works well with Protect, as it usually guarantees that Flareon will heal itself while scouting the opponent and racking up Leftovers recovery. However, Flareon isn't all about supporting its teammates, as its decent base 95 Special Attack can be useful as well. Lava Plume is the optimal choice, as it can compensate for Flareon's pitiful Defense with its 30% burn chance. However, if more power is desired, Flamethrower is an alternative. The final moveslot is based on preference. Heal Bell makes Flareon a true team supporter, removing status conditions from both itself and its teammates. Roar turns Flareon into a decent phazer, which comes in handy against setup Pokemon, such as Calm Mind Serperior and Musharna. Finally, Toxic can be used against opposing walls, such as Alomomola, and works well with Protect. However, Toxic is not recommended with Lava Plume, as Lava Plume's good burn chance can intervene with Toxic.</p> <p>Leftovers increases Flareon's durability and works very well in conjunction with Protect, and a Calm nature maximizes Flareon's Special Defense. Flash Fire allows Flareon to absorb Fire-type attacks and is better than Guts for this particular set. Fire Blast can be used for more raw power, but the loss in accuracy can be undesirable, especially when it needs to land a hit. If preferred, Flareon can use physical attacks, such as Fire Fang or Flame Charge, in the third moveset, and a Careful nature should be used.</p> <p>Rapid Spin support is appreciated, as Flareon won't last long in the match if entry hazards are present. Wartortle is a good option, as it can take advantage of Flareon's Wish while providing good synergy with Flareon, taking any Water-, Rock-, and Ground-type attacks aimed at Flareon. Due to its low Defense stat, Flareon enjoys having physically defensive Pokemon as partners. Tangela and Alomomola are prime examples as such; the former has good synergy with Flareon and can use a Leech Seed for additional healing, while the latter also has access to Wish, forming a powerful supporting core with Flareon. This set is Taunt bait; Liepard and Misdreavus can stop Flareon cold before it can retaliate. Gurdurr is a great counter to Liepard with Drain Punch, while Skuntank (which only fears Will-O-Wisp) and Swellow can handle Misdreavus. With Heal Bell, Flareon can aid sweepers that dislike paralysis or burn, such as Braviary, Sawk, Gorebyss and Primeape. They also benefit from Wish; in return, they can deal with opposing special walls, bar Musharna. Lastly, Flash Fire can be useful to teammates that dislike Fire-type attacks, specifically Tangela, Exeggutor, and Roselia. In addition, Roselia and Tangela have good bulk with Eviolite and great synergy with Flareon.</p>"
      },
      "Guts": {
        "description": "<p>This set showcases Flareon's offensive potential. While its overall bulk isn't worth bragging about, Flareon's Special Defense is still useful, as it allows Flareon to absorb many special attacks. For example, Flareon is only 2HKOed by Choice Specs Gardevoir's Psychic. Flareon can reach up to 591 Attack with Guts activated, powering through the majority of the NU tier, including Kangaskhan, Eelektross, Armaldo, and Lickilicky. It works best as a mid-game or a late-game sweeper when the majority of the opposing team is weakened.</p> <p>Facade is the key to this set; once Guts is activated, Facade is very powerful, nearly OHKOing Ursaring. Superpower is a great coverage move, and can OHKO a 252 HP/4 Def Lickilicky, as well as dent many Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon, specifically Probopass and Carracosta. Flame Charge is Flareon's STAB move; it increases Flareon's Speed with every hit, which can turn Flareon into a fast sweeper if used correctly. With Guts activated, Flame Charge can OHKO Eviolite Roselia and 3HKO Tangela at full HP. Bite is the move of choice in the final moveslot, as it allows Flareon to fare well against Ghost-types, namely Misdreavus and Golurk. However, Protect can be useful to ensure that Guts is safely activated.</p> <p>Guts and Toxic Orb are both critical aspects of this set. 252 Speed EVs allow Flareon to outspeed max Speed Timid Liepard, Kadabra, and Rapidash after a Flame Charge boost. 252 Attack EVs are mandatory, giving Flareon the raw power it needs to plow through the NU tier. An Adamant nature maximizes Flareon's Attack, but Jolly can be used for additional Speed; Flareon can outspeed Scolipede at +1 if Jolly is used. If more bulk is preferred, an EV spread of 244 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Spe could be used, allowing Flareon to outspeed 124 Speed Lickilicky and minimize damage dealt from the opponent. Quick Attack and Baton Pass are both options on this set as well. Quick Attack acts as a great priority move, which can come in handy in certain situations. Baton Pass tweaks Flareon's role to a more supportive one, as it can pass its Speed boosts from Flame Charge. Toxic is also an option; it can cripple walls that otherwise stop Flareon, specifically Alomomola. However, finding a moveslot for Toxic can be difficult, as this Flareon is more of a wallbreaker.</p> <p>Spikes and Stealth Rock can cripple Flareon, so Rapid Spin users, such as Armaldo and Wartortle, are excellent partners. Armaldo can help Flareon offensively, while Wartortle helps Flareon defensively with Eviolite because it walls Water-types and can lower the opponent's Attack with a Scald burn. Sawk prevents Sturdy users from setting up entry hazards thanks to its ability, Mold Breaker. Flareon also enjoys entry hazard support, as entry hazards let it secure important 2HKOs and OHKOs. They also grant Flareon more opportunities to land a free Speed boost by netting KOs through Flame Charge. Bulky entry hazard setters such as Regirock are advised, as they can take physical attacks that Flareon cannot survive, such as a Life Orb Brave Bird from Braviary. Roselia is also a great Spikes setter for Flareon, as it can deal with Alomomola.</p> <p>If you choose not to run Protect, a slow Volt Switch user such as Eelektross allows Flareon to activate Guts without taking a hit. Alomomola can wall all of Flareon's attacks, heal them off with Wish, and stall Flareon with Protect. Because of this, Substitute Seismitoad and Exeggutor are great allies to deal with Alomomola. Exeggutor can also handle the Rock- and Ground-type attacks that Flareon is weak against. Pokemon that are faster than Flareon, such as Braviary, Floatzel, and Kangaskhan, bring grief to Flareon, as they can KO it before it can retaliate. Choice Scarf users, such as Rotom-S and Sawk, can defeat most of these Pokemon. Golem, Gigalith, and Regirock can wall Flareon and KO it with their STAB moves; special attackers, notably Samurott and Gorebyss, can usually deal with them.</p>"

  "Dragonair": {
    "overview": "<p>A single glance at Dragonair's stats would usually give you the impression that she is a mediocre Pokemon. In all honesty, she is. Offensively, her stats aren't so hot, especially when there are better offensive Dragon-types such as Fraxure. If you combine that with her subpar Speed and defensive stats, Dragonair might not even be worth using in the NU tier. However, thanks to two useful abilities, Shed Skin and Marvel Scale, and Eviolite, Dragonair still finds hope to become known in NU. While her defensive stats alone aren't very promising, holding an Eviolite allows them to be utilized. Her great defensive typing gives her resistances to many common types, as well as only two weaknesses. Because of this bulk, she can make use of Dragon Dance. Thunder Wave and Dragon Tail are also great move selections for Dragonair to help her cripple sweepers and rack up entry hazard damage. Overall, while Dragonair does have her perks, she is outclassed in many ways and should be used with extreme care.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With powerful special attacks at her arsenal, such as Draco Meteor and Dragon Pulse, Dragonair has the option of running a special attacking set. However, her mediocre Special Attack prevents this set from being successful. Leftovers can be used for any of Dragonair's sets, but she really needs the defensive boosts that Eviolite has to offer. Alternatively, an offensive Dragon Dance set can try to bring out Dragonair's offensive prowess, but her lackluster defenses are exposed even more so, making it difficult to set up. Flamethrower and Fire Blast can be used to deal with Steel-types, but Dragonair has no place for them in her movesets. Substitute can also be used in the bulky Dragon Dance set to try to set up Dragon Dance, but with a lack of reliable recovery, Dragonair would be wearing herself down.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Even with Eviolite, Dragonair doesn't stand a chance against many of the offensive Pokemon in NU. In general, almost every Ice-type in NU can defeat Dragonair. Choice Scarf Jynx can outspeed Dragonair even at +3 and deal over 50% to it with Ice Beam, making it a solid choice in picking off a weakened Dragonair, while Choice Specs Glaceon can OHKO Dragonair from full HP. Sawk with Mold Breaker can cut through Marvel Scale, making Dragonair even more vulnerable to physical attacks. Dragonair still has a hard time with physical walls, even with Dragon Dance. Steel-types, specifically Bastiodon and Klang, can easily wall Dragonair and force it out in some way. Specifically, Bastiodon is capable of Roaring away Dragonair's boosts and Klang can set up alongside it with Shift Gear. Encore users, especially Liepard and Volbeat, can lock Dragonair into Rest, Sleep Talk, or Dragon Dance and force it to switch out. Offensively, Pokemon with Choice Band can break through the bulky Dragon Dance set, namely Braviary, Sawk, and Golurk. Finding a Pokemon to handle Dragonair isn't the most difficult task, as her defenses are often not good enough to withstand the strongest attackers in the tier.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Dragonair can function well with a bulky offensive set. She can set up Dragon Dance on special attackers such as Eelektross, Serperior, Seismitoad, and Charizard by taking advantage of her decent bulk, in contrast to other frail sweepers. In spite of her defensive boost, this set isn't meant to set up on powerhouses and bulky setup sweepers, such as Sawk and Carracosta, but it is rather meant to set up on special attackers and walls, which in some cases cannot stop at least one Dragon Dance. Thanks to Dragonair's great ability options, Rest can be used with succession, giving Dragonair a recovery option.</p> <p>Dragon Dance raises Dragonair's Speed and Attack to viable levels. Rest is Dragonair's only source of recovery, and while two turns asleep can hinder Dragonair's capabilities, Shed Skin and Marvel Scale can mend it. If she finds an opportunity to set up, Dragonair can break through opposing teams with her powerful STAB move, Outrage, as there aren't many Pokemon in the tier that can resist it. Sleep Talk is the preferred option in the final moveslot, as it takes advantage of Rest and works well in conjunction with Marvel Scale. Sleep Talk also allows Outrage to be used without being locked into it. However, Waterfall can be used for extra coverage, but unless Dragonair encounters a Steel-type, Outrage is almost always the superior choice.</p> <p>Shed Skin and Marvel Scale both have their merits and should be used accordingly. Shed Skin gives the opportunity for Dragonair to wake up from Rest 33% of the time, which can be useful in the midst of setting up. However, Marvel Scale gives Dragonair a 50% boost in Defense when Dragonair is inflicted with status, which allows Dragonair to be even harder to defeat. Full investment in both HP and Special Defense allows Dragonair to obtain the bulk necessary to set up on her main target. With Eviolite, the given Special Defense EVs, and her great defensive typing, Dragonair doesn't have many difficulties setting up against special attackers, such as Eelektross and Charizard. A Careful nature maximizes her Special Defense. An EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe is optional to handle physical attackers such as Tauros and Primeape. Extremespeed is an option that could be used in the last moveslot. However, it offers nothing in terms of coverage, and Dragonair usually isn't going to be attacking much until it has attained several boosts anyways.</p> <p>As Dragonair's attacks are usually underwhelming, entry hazards are appreciated so that Dragonair can manage to land a KO. Scolipede, Garbodor, and Probopass are good partners for that role; Probopass in particular has good synergy with Dragonair, as it takes the Ice-type attacks aimed at her and can eliminate pesky Steel-types with Magnet Pull. Pokemon that can spread paralysis or burn, such as Volbeat, Liepard, or Misdreavus, can be helpful in weakening the opponent for Dragonair. Heal Bell support can be useful for Dragonair, especially when not running Sleep Talk. Lickilicky and Miltank are great selections as Heal Bell partners, and Lickilicky can also pass Wishes to Dragonair.</p>"

      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<p>Dragonair's goal for this set is to spread paralysis against the opposing team, which can be achieved thanks to her access to Eviolite, recovery from Rest, and the Defense boost from Marvel Scale when Dragonair is afflicted with status. Rest is the key move in this set, as it keeps Dragonair healthy. Thunder Wave is an important move to the set because it can not only cripple the opposing sweepers, but can give an opportunity for teammates to attack. Dragon Tail in conjunction with Thunder Wave allows Dragonair to pass paralysis to the adversary, as well as stopping setup sweepers from advancing, such as Swords Dance Samurott. However, due to Dragonair's lackluster Attack stat, she is often setup bait to Substitute users, who can then set up entry hazards, Leech Seed, or power up. In such a scenario, Outrage is a solution, allowing Dragonair to have some sort of offensive presence. Sleep Talk is the final move of the set, allowing Dragonair to continue to act while she is asleep from Rest.</p> <p>Marvel Scale encourages Rest to be used, as the 50% Defense boost helps maintain Dragonair's longevity, allowing her to fare well against physical attackers, such as Rapidash, non-Mold Breaker Pinsir, and Swellow. The given EV spread balances her defensive stats when Marvel Scale is activated. A Careful nature enhances her Special Defense. Eviolite also increases her defenses, allowing her to survive hits much easier. If Thunder Wave isn't used, Dragon Dance can be replaced with it, giving her the chance to deal with more offensive threats. Toxic can also replace Thunder Wave to cripple bulky walls, such as Regirock and Alomomola. Pokemon that benefit from having paralyzed opponents, such as Choice Band Sawk, Butterfree, and Braviary, are great allies, as they can perform sweeps on the opposing team with fewer difficulties. Rotom-F and Jynx are great Pokemon to handle powerful physical attackers, such as Golurk and Braviary, but they must be careful of opposing Fighting-type moves. Golurk is also a good partner, as it can deal with Steel-types, Sawk, and Musharna. This variant of Dragonair is Taunt bait, which attracts Pokemon such as Liepard and Misdreavus to prevent Dragonair from using her support moves. Gurdurr and Sawk can easily deal with the former, while Charizard can take a Will-O-Wisp from the latter and proceed to KO it.</p>"

Trick is really annoying and is Furret's greatest weapon, but don't switch in an offensive Pokemon to absorb it right off the bat as Return or Double-Edge can actually leave a dent in a few Pokemon.

Your goal should be to prevent it from getting an opportunity to actually switch in and cause trouble. Stealth Rock helps in this venture, as does nearly any physical attack.

  "Natu": {
    "overview": "<p>Magic Bounce has carved Natu an interesting niche in the NU metagame, allowing it to shut down several support Pokemon that rely on status, phazing, or entry hazard setting, such as Alomomola, Bastiodon, and Tangela, and can therefore single-handedly wall most stall-oriented teams; it also stops the lesser known but deadly Riolu phazing strategy. Furthermore, the utility Magic Bounce boasts prevents the opposition from obliviously laying entry hazards and spreading status around, an external support tactic no Pokemon but Natu can rightfully claim in NU. However, Natu is very underwhelming itself, as even with Eviolite and a generally maximized Defense stat, Natu is still hit quite hard by many relatively powerful physical attackers. Thus, a skilled user who excels in prediction is required to play completely to Natu's strengths, as switching Natu in on the wrong move or allowing the opponent to set up entry hazards will essentially make it a wasted slot. In essence, Natu is completely reliant on its ability and support moves to cause any kind of nuisances, which makes it a risky Pokemon to use and setup bait for a myriad of sweepers, such as Bulk Up Braviary, Nasty Plot Jynx, and Swords Dance Samurott.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Natu holds an extensive support movepool consisting of notable moves such as Haze, Light Screen, Wish, Trick Room, Feather Dance, Rain Dance, and Sunny Day, but each move is generally executed better by more reliable Pokemon and Natu just doesn't have the space to use them effectively. Calm Mind looks like a feasible option, but with Natu's poor defenses and underwhelming Special Attack, it's better done by the likes of Musharna and Gardevoir. Grass Knot can be useful against Seismitoad, Golem, and Regirock, but it's highly situational and Natu doesn't have the power to OHKO them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>As Natu typically shuts down bulky walls, there are specific methods to dealing with it. Pokemon with high offensive prowess, specifically special attackers to take advantage of Natu's poor Special Defense, work excellently. Jynx, Eelektross, and Regice, which pack STAB super effective attacks against Natu, are examples that easily dispose of it. Boosting sweepers that don't fear Toxic too greatly can set up and bypass Natu, such as Swords Dance Samurott, SubSmash Gorebyss, and Shift Gear Klang. Substitute users that block Toxic can also be effectively used. Braviary and Tauros are great Substitute users to promptly shut Natu down as Night Shade fails to even affect them. Guts and Toxic Boost Pokemon, such as Zangoose, Swellow, and Ursaring, can switch in freely, activate their abilities once hit by Toxic, and pound Natu with their STAB Facade. It's also possible to indirectly cripple Natu with status as it significantly hinders Natu's effectiveness. This can be done with the likes of Wartortle's Scald, Skuntank's Poison Jab (which also packs Pursuit), Torkoal's Lava Plume, and Stunfisk's Discharge; Musharna also works well because once Natu reflects Toxic, it will be poisoned itself due to Synchronize and Musharna can use Heal Bell to remove its own Toxic. It's generally very easy to threaten Natu as it cannot do much from an offensive standpoint and its defenses are not high enough to withstand most Pokemon with enough power or with super effective attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>This is Natu's generic support set, which works effectively due to the fact that Natu cannot be shut down by Taunt thanks to its ability bouncing it right back at the opponent. When using Natu, the basic objective is to bring it in against any non-threatening support Pokemon, such as Audino, defensive Scolipede, and Mandibuzz, to keep entry hazards and status from hindering your team and instead reflect them all back towards the opponent.</p> <p>Because Magic Bounce users typically need to stay alive for as long as possible due to the phenomenal support it provides, Roost is the primary move to ensure such longevity. It further helps Natu to potentially accommodate for three of its weaknesses to Rock-, Ice-, and Electric-type moves, as Natu would take neutral damage from slower Pokemon carrying moves of said types, such as Regirock and Piloswine. Toxic is Natu's best weapon to actually deal with the Pokemon it shuts down, as many bulky walls detest the poison status, such as Alomomola and Tangela. Reflect is a vital move on Natu because it provides it with the ability to withstand the many Rock- and Ice-type Stealth Rock setters, such as the aforementioned Regirock and Piloswine, as well as Golem. On top of that, it makes Natu and its teammates significantly harder to overcome by physical attacks for a few turns. Lastly, Night Shade is used to better handle other threats Natu switches into, especially against Toxic-immune Pokemon as seen in Bastiodon and Garbodor, as it does decent damage and also prevents Natu from being complete setup bait against boosting attackers.</p> <p>The suggested Speed EVs allows Natu to outpace max Speed Golem to use Reflect and Roost before it can attack with Rock Blast. It's recommended to invest in Natu's Defense as most entry hazard setters are physically attacking. 0 Attack IVs and a Bold nature are used to minimize Foul Play damage, making Natu an excellent answer to Mandibuzz and Liepard. In terms of other moves to use, Thunder Wave is a good way to cripple sweepers and potentially buy free turns through full paralysis, but Toxic is more useful as Natu needs to beat the threats it walls by Toxic stalling. Psychic can work as a STAB move to hit Scolipede, Garbodor, and Roselia, but Night Shade already beats the former two and Roselia overtakes Natu with Sludge Bomb anyway. Night Shade is also needed to hurt Bastiodon, Probopass, and Metang, while preventing Skuntank from walling Natu. Finally, U-turn is a good move to scout for switch-ins, as Natu forces a lot of Pokemon out, and generally increases momentum on your side, but it's not recommended as Natu doesn't have room for it and it is inferior to the other moves Natu should be using.</p> <p>Pokemon that appreciate Natu's ability to keep entry hazards off the field and act as a reliable status absorber are recommended. Jynx, Charizard, and Mandibuzz are excellent options to consider as they are all easily hampered by entry hazards and status effects. It's also necessary to carry Pokemon that have good synergy with Natu's typing. Liepard, which typically lures in the defensive Pokemon that Natu beats, resists Natu's Dark- and Ghost-type weaknesses while Natu in return quad-resists Liepard's Fighting-type weakness. Seismitoad is also a great Pokemon to use with its resistance to Rock and immunity to Electric, and Natu takes care of its Grass-type weakness. As Natu attracts setup sweepers and Pokemon with Substitute, Liepard deserves another mention as it's equipped with a Prankster Encore to lock the opposition into their setup move and can use U-turn to scout for their switch-in. Volbeat is also an excellent partner in this regard, as it too has Prankster Encore and can potentially set up a free Tail Glow to Baton Pass to a teammate.</p>"

  "Sudowoodo": {
    "overview": "<p>Sudowoodo, as with most other Rock-type Pokemon, has high Attack and Defense stats. Unfortunately, its pure Rock typing makes the Imitation Pokemon weak to common attacking types, such as Grass, Water, and Fighting, and is therefore often shunned in favor of a Pokemon with a solid secondary typing. However, Sudowoodo does have one trick up its sleeve that sets it apart from other Rock-types: Wood Hammer. While other Rock-type Pokemon would flee from Water- and Ground-types, Sudowoodo can fight back, scoring many surprise KOs against unsuspecting opponents. Sudowoodo can also take on the role of a support Pokemon by laying down Stealth Rock and sponging hits from the common Braviary and Swellow. However, aside from that niche, Sudowoodo doesn't have anything over other Rock-types, so always keep that in mind when including it on your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sudowoodo has a couple of other options, thanks to its decent movepool. Double-Edge works well with Rock Head, but it sacrifices coverage and generally should be avoided. Rest allows Sudowoodo to fully heal, although due to the risk of being setup fodder, it should be used in conjunction with a cleric. Rock Slide can be used over Stone Edge for higher PP and accuracy, but the drop in power is very noticeable. Sudowoodo has access to the elemental punches, which may seem like a good idea, but the low Base Power and unneeded coverage makes these options inferior. Sudowoodo was also gifted with Focus Punch, allowing for a SubPunch set. However, Sudowoodo has difficulty forcing switches, and deciding which moves to swap out for Substitute and Focus Punch can be a pain. Explosion is also an option if you want to end with a bang, although the BW nerf and Sudowoodo's low Speed makes this difficult to use successfully. Sudowoodo gets two decent boosting moves in Rock Polish and Curse. Rock Polish doubles Sudowoodo's Speed, but even then it is still too slow to outspeed the top tier threats and too weak to get past a lot of the walls in the tier. The latter would be feasible were it not for Sudowoodo's poor Special Defense, which leaves it prone to special attacks when setting up. The Dream World gave Sudowoodo the Rattled ability, which raises its Speed by one stage when hit by a Bug-, Dark-, or Ghost-type move, all very common attacking types in the NU tier. While this seems usable, a Speed boost of only one stage means practically nothing to Sudowoodo.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Due to Sudowoodo's pure Rock typing, it possesses many common weaknesses and is therefore easy to counter. Most Pokemon can 2HKO Sudowoodo with a decently powerful special attack. Tangela is a nightmare to face, taking only neutral damage from Stone Edge while resisting Wood Hammer and Earthquake. A Giga Drain from it is a surefire 2HKO, even from the support variant. Bulky Psychic-types such as Musharna can set up all over a Sudowoodo lacking Toxic, taking only neutral damage from its attacks. In general, bulky Pokemon give Sudowoodo trouble.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>With a respectable Defense stat, Sudowoodo can easily take on a support role. It can set up Stealth Rock, which stops common threats from repeatedly switching in. Misdreavus can be used as a spinblocker to keep Stealth Rock present and also has the benefit of being immune to Fighting-type attacks. STAB Stone Edge hits surprisingly hard coming off its base 100 Attack, and is Sudowoodo's main way of dealing damage to foes. The inclusion of Wood Hammer sets Sudowoodo apart from other Rock-types; it allows Sudowoodo to hit Water- and Ground-types, which wall its fellow Rock-types, hard. Finally, Toxic is there to cripple opposing sweepers and walls.</p> <p>Leftovers are necessary on this set due to Sudowoodo's lack of recovery. The given EVs and nature maximize Sudowoodo's Defense, allowing it to endure even the most powerful of physical attacks. This set makes an excellent counter to the common Flying-types in NU, being able to comfortably switch into Brave Bird or Facade and scare them out with Stone Edge (make sure to watch out for Braviary's Superpower though). However, Sudowoodo's low Special Defense makes it very vulnerable, so one must be careful around special attackers. Specially defensive Altaria works brilliantly in conjunction with Sudowoodo, being able to take the numerous specially based attacks directed at Sudowoodo and Roosting off the damage. Lickilicky also works well, being one of the tier's best special walls and also being able to pass enormous Wishes, replenishing Sudowoodo's HP. However, Sudowoodo should be cautious of Fighting-type attacks, which neither Sudowoodo nor Lickilicky resist.</p> <p>Rock Head increases Sudowoodo's survivability by negating Wood Hammer recoil, making it the primary option for the ability. Sturdy could be used, but in that case, Earthquake is recommended over Wood Hammer, as the recoil damage would break Sturdy.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to a decent base 100 Attack and a good movepool, Sudowoodo can take on the role of a physical attacker. Once again, Stone Edge is a great STAB move and, thanks to the Attack investment, allows Sudowoodo to heavily dent foes. Earthquake is used with this to form the EdgeQuake combination, allowing Sudowoodo to hit most Pokemon for at least neutral damage. Wood Hammer allows Sudowoodo to decimate Water- and Ground-types, and being Sudowoodo's niche move, should always be present. Due to an abysmal Speed stat, Sucker Punch is used in the final move slot to take out faster, weakened foes.</p> <p>Sudowoodo's poor Speed means it is outpaced by most Pokemon in the tier, and will therefore have difficulty sweeping. The given EVs allow it to beat uninvested base 60 Speed Pokemon, while the Adamant nature increases Sudowoodo's Attack. Having a Pokemon to set up entry hazards will be of great benefit to Sudowoodo. Cacturne for example can set up Spikes, allowing Sudowoodo to KO many more Pokemon. Garbodor is an alternative, being able to set up either Spikes or Toxic Spikes depending on the situation.</p> <p>While Sudowoodo has a good offensive presence, physical walls such as Tangela can stop it completely. To remedy this, a special attacker should be used to remove the said wall and give Sudowoodo a better chance of a sweep. Magmar works well in this role, being able to easily deal with Tangela thanks to its powerful STAB Fire Blast and immunity to sleep, while its coverage moves enable it to deal with most other physical walls.</p> <p>Rock Head is chosen to negate Wood Hammer recoil. Sturdy doesn't offer much use, as entry hazards will almost always be up. A Choice Band turns Sudowoodo into a spectacular wallbreaker. However, a Choice-locked Sucker Punch can easily be used as setup bait. This is easily remedied by using a Life Orb instead, but the decrease in power is very noticeable. Finally, Hammer Arm can be used over another move if you are having problems with Dark- and Normal-types, although this isn't recommended due to the superior coverage provided by its other moves.</p>"

With other Chlorophyll sweepers in the tier, such as Victreebel and Exeggutor, that are speedier and more powerful than it, Sunflora finds its only niche as a suicide sun setter than can threaten opponents in the process. However, this set is very difficult to pull off and it is advisable to stick to other options instead.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fire can go over Sunflora's coverage move, as it hits Metang and Roselia and gets a power boost from sun, but it is mostly redundant because Sunflora's teammates can usually beat them just as well. Growth can be used in sun, but Sunflora hardly gets the chance to set it up and it is still revenge killed easily. Substitute + Endeavor with Custap Berry as the item can be an interesting set, but it is inferior because it is much harder to pull off. GrassWhistle sounds like a decent option, but in reality, its accuracy is appalling and Sunflora usually cannot afford to miss due to its frailty. Fully offensive sets are outclassed by Pokemon such as Victreebel, although Solar Power Sunflora in sun is surprisingly powerful; it can even OHKO Musharna with SolarBeam. However, as mentioned before, this usually does not work as Sunflora is extremely slow and frail.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Taunt users, such as Misdreavus, Mandibuzz, and Serperior, can prevent Sunflora from setting up sun. Ghost-types can usually defeat Sunflora as they are immune to Endeavor, although they should watch out for SolarBeam. Although they cannot prevent Sunflora from setting up sun, priority users can defeat Sunflora without giving it time to use Endeavor. Opposing rain teams completely neuter Sunflora as they can cancel out sun, weaken SolarBeam, and Pokemon on these teams can swiftly 2HKO. If Sunflora isn't running Hidden Power Rock, Fire- and Flying-types can easily defeat Sunflora. Meanwhile, Sunflora that do not run Earth Power find themselves walled by Probopass and Bastiodon. Roselia completely walls Sunflora and can either set up Spikes on it or simply 2HKO with Sludge Bomb. Special walls such as Audino and Lickilicky easily soak up hits from Sunflora, but they should watch out for Endeavor. Piloswine can OHKO Sunflora most of the time through Focus Sash thanks to Icicle Spear, and Sunflora cannot do anything back because SolarBeam is ineffective if sun is not up. Liepard can lock Sunflora into Sunny Day with Encore, and U-turn out of the switch-in to gain momentum. Any Choice Scarf user or fast Pokemon above base 106 Speed, such as Choice Scarf Rotom-S and Tauros, can outspeed Sunflora even in sun and 2HKO. Although preventing sun is slightly more difficult, checking Sunflora itself isn't a huge problem because most Pokemon have a good matchup against it. In fact, Sunflora's teammates are usually the more threatening ones, which is why it is better to watch out and prepare for them instead.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Suicide Sun": {
        "description": "<p>With this set, Sunflora can quickly set up weather for sun teams and slightly weaken opponents before getting KOed, possibly allowing a teammate to sweep. Generally, though, Volbeat and Liepard are better options thanks to Prankster, a plethora of utility moves, and the ability to hold a Heat Rock. Sunny Day is a non-negotiable move, as without it, Sunflora has no other niche worth mentioning. SolarBeam is Sunflora's strongest STAB attack in sun. Hidden Power Rock allows Sunflora to dent opposing Charizard and Braviary, while Earth Power allows Sunflora to take down Probopass. Endeavor allows Sunflora to bring down an opponent to 1 HP thanks to Focus Sash. Finally, Encore is an option to lock opponents into harmless moves such as Stealth Rock, Toxic, or Will-O-Wisp, possibly allowing a teammate to switch in for free.</p> <p>Chlorophyll is the chosen ability because Sunflora is too slow and frail to utilize Solar Power effectively. In addition, Chlorophyll allows Sunflora to outspeed up to base 106 Speed Pokemon, including Electabuzz and Kadabra, thus weakening potentially dangerous opponents. Heat Rock is a possible item, but it is inferior because Sunflora will hardly be surviving attacks to set up sun. Because this set fits sun teams well, teammates that benefit from sun are good. Chlorophyll users such as Shiftry, Exeggutor, Sawsbuck, and Victreebel, as well as Fire-types such as Rapidash and Charizard, are good Pokemon on sun teams. Other Pokemon that can set up sun would be beneficial, as the sun set up by Sunflora will not last long and it eases the pressure off of it to stay alive. Pokemon such as Liepard, Volbeat, Regirock, and Probopass can set up sun and provide other decent support options as well. Because sun teams dislike Stealth Rock, Pokemon that can prevent or remove it are useful teammates. Mold Breaker Sawk and Shell Smash Torkoal are decent options to prevent Stealth Rock; this also allows Sunflora to preserve its Focus Sash.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With a large non-attacking movepool containing moves such as Calm Mind, Perish Song, and Feather Dance to utilize alongside its ability, Prankster, Murkrow can be quite versatile. While it might seem frail at first glance, Eviolite and its access to Roost allow Murkrow to maintain longevity on the field to make its mark. However even with Eviolite, Murkrow is still quite easy to get past, as it takes a lot of damage from the majority of the tier. It faces competition from Liepard, a fellow Prankster user, which has a higher Speed stat to rely on. Mandibuzz, who shares the same typing as Murkrow, also rivals it in terms of bulk and team support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With Mean Look, Perish Song, and Prankster, Murkrow can play the role of a perish trapper to net a free KO against a Pokemon or two. However, opponents will often switch in Pokemon that can handle Murkrow before Mean Look can even be used, so it will often fail. Taunt alongside Prankster and Roost can make Murkrow a good stallbreaker, however it faces heavy competition with Mandibuzz, who has superior bulk and is generally fast enough to outspeed walls regardless. A great base 91 Speed, along with powerful offensive moves such as Brave Bird, Heat Wave, and Sucker Punch, gives Murkrow the option of running a successful Life Orb set. However, Murkrow is very frail without an Eviolite and thus easy to KO. Confuse Ray is another move to consider that can cripple the opponent further, but Murkrow rarely finds the space to run it. With a weather rock, Murkrow can be a useful weather inducer, but without Eviolite, it is KOed with ease, and there are many other Pokemon who can fulfill the role better than Murkrow could. Tailwind can be used to further support the team through Speed, but Murkrow has difficulty fitting it into a moveset. A set centered around Feather Dance can be used to cripple physical attackers, but in most cases, using both Calm Mind and Feather Dance produces the best results, as it gives Murkrow better overall defenses. While Murkrow has many other options to consider, very few of them are worth deviating from its standard sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Taunt users can ruin Murkrow, as it often relies on non-attacking moves, so Pokemon such as Samurott and Skuntank are good checks. Even with Eviolite, Murkrow is still rather frail, so Pokemon with powerful or super effective moves to use against it, such as Rotom-F, Eelektross, and Piloswine, are good as well. Carracosta, Gigalith, and Golem also fit into this category, as they can tank Murkrow's hits and KO it with their Rock-type STAB moves. Golem in particular can also break Murkrow's Substitutes with Rock Blast. Specially bulky Pokemon, such as Flareon and Lickilicky, are good counters to the Calm Mind set, as Murkrow cannot do a thing to them, even with Calm Mind boosts. However if Flareon and Lickilicky lack Roar and Dragon Tail, respectively, Murkrow has the ability to set up on them without much trouble. In Lickilicky's case, if Murkrow has Substitute it can avoid being phazed by Dragon Tail. It is difficult to inflict status onto Murkrow due to Prankster and Substitute, and setting up against it or attacking it might be challenging because of its plethora of non-attacking moves. However, Murkrow cannot switch into very many attacks, so hitting it on the switch is a great tactic to defeat it.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Blessed with Prankster, access to Roost, and a decent Special Attack, Murkrow can find success as a Calm Mind user. With Eviolite, Murkrow can last longer on the field and find more opportunities to set up. This set is great for dealing with Psychic-types, such as Gardevoir, but it cannot switch into some of their attacks, as it is still a bit frail. Calm Mind is the center point of this set, raising Dark Pulse's power and making Murkrow more specially defensive. Roost allows Murkrow to heal itself in a pinch, and it gets boosted priority thanks to Prankster. Feather Dance allows Murkrow to deal with the majority of physical attackers in the tier, most notably Sawk, by crippling them. Calm Mind and Feather Dance combine very well to grant Murkrow more chances to force switches and set up. However, Substitute can be used to avoid status conditions that can cripple Murkrow.</p> <p>248 HP EVs allow Murkrow to switch into Stealth Rock four times at full HP. 252 Defense EVs and a Bold nature balance out Murkrow's defenses with Calm Mind. Prankster is key to in this set, as it gives Murkrow a boost in priority when using non-attacking moves, which form the majority here. There are not many alternative move selections for this set; the only notable one would be Hidden Power Flying, which allows Murkrow to deal with Fighting-types. However, Dark Pulse offers more power.</p> <p>If Murkrow isn't using Substitute, status conditions can really hinder its sweeping capabilities. Clerics such as Lickilicky, Musharna, and Vileplume are good partners, as they can tank attacks that Murkrow cannot take. Musharna in particular can also deal with Fighting-types that Murkrow cannot really harm. Sawk is a good ally, as it can deal with Steel-, Rock-, and opposing Dark-types Murkrow can't scratch. Sawk also has nice synergy with Musharna, which can work well in Murkrow's favor. While Jynx cannot switch into Dark Pulse, it can quickly dispose of Murkrow if it hasn't begun setting up Calm Mind; Metang and Choice Scarf Charizard can defeat Jynx. Pokemon that can phaze Murkrow, such as Serperior and Eelektross, can prevent it from setting up successfully. Dragonair is a good counter to Eelektross, and Sap Sipper Miltank and Swellow fare well against Serperior. Miltank also can offer Heal Bell support to Murkrow. Toxic Spikes support is appreciated, as it can weaken the adversary, making it much easier for Murkrow to handle. Garbodor and Scolipede are good partners in that department.</p>"

  "Misdreavus": {
    "overview": "<p>With the transition to BW came the Eviolite, and because of it, many Pokemon were forever changed. Misdreavus is a prime example of this, as when equipped with an Eviolite, its lackluster defenses rise to impressive levels, and when combined with a fantastic defensive typing and ability, it is a formidable defensive threat in NU. Combine that with an excellent support movepool, a satisfactory offensive movepool, and the ability to spinblock, and you can see why Misdreavus is one of the most viable Pokemon in the tier. Its main niche in the metagame is that of a bulky supporter and spinblocker, but Misdreavus can easily become an unexpected offensive threat as well. Spikes-stacking is a very powerful strategy in NU, which only heightens Misdreavus's usefulness. Sadly, though, Misdreavus's great bulk is severely hindered by its lack of reliable recovery (it can't even utilize Leftovers), and is prone to being worn down. Still, none can perform Misdreavus's job quite as efficiently.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Misdreavus has many other options it can utilize, but can't always bring each one to its fullest potential. A defensive Calm Mind set similar to the Nasty Plot set is viable and can easily set up against stall, but stall is rare in NU, so this is not advised. Besides, the Nasty Plot set can set up on stall as well and is a much more immediate threat. Magic Coat can be used to bounce back status moves, but requires good prediction to work and is thus much riskier than Taunt. A set with Curse, Taunt and Pain Split can turn Misdreavus into a dedicated stallbreaker, but is rather gimmicky and the 50% health loss from Curse is undesirable and can put Misdreavus at severe risk. Destiny Bond could potentially work, but requires Misdreavus to die to function, wasting its amazing longevity. If you're looking for a frail Ghost with Destiny Bond, use Haunter instead. Finally, Rain Dance, Sunny Day and Trick Room could work on their respective teams, but there are better Pokemon for the job.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Checks and counters for Misdreavus are completely different for each set, and thus almost nothing is a complete \"counter.\" Skuntank can usually do well against both sets, but must watch out for Will-O-Wisp and boosted Thunderbolts. Swellow and Zangoose can beat most defensive variants with ease and Swellow can even use Pursuit on the switch, but will quickly fall to Foul Play or Thunderbolt, while Will-O-Wisp cripples Zangoose if it has not activated its Toxic Orb yet. Charizard can switch in on Will-O-Wisp and deal loads of damage with Fire Blast, but hates switching in on attacks with its massive Stealth Rock weakness. Bulky attackers (primarily special ones), such as Regice and Choice Specs Altaria, can do well against Misdreavus as they aren't crippled by Will-O-Wisp, can wear it down, and don't mind taking an attack or two. Special attackers in general can usually deal a ton of damage to Misdreavus, examples being Samurott, Ludicolo, and Serperior, but the frailer ones must be careful when switching in. Nasty Plot Shiftry gets a special mention as it laughs at anything Misdreavus throws at it and can fire back with a Dark Pulse. Offensive spinners, such as Swords Dance Armaldo and Shell Smash Torkoal, can get past Misdreavus and get to spin, but if it Taunts them before they can set up, they will always lose. Trick and Knock Off users can remove Misdreavus's Eviolite, heavily crippling it. Residual damage, whether it be from Stealth Rock, U-turn, or status, also severely limits its ability to check the opposing team. However, it's very important to note that entry hazards can punish almost every one of these methods listed, so keep that in mind when both facing and using Misdreavus.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility Counter": {
        "description": "<p>This is the most common Misdreavus set you'll see in the metagame, and for good reason. With the moves above, Misdreavus can put a stop to some of the biggest threats in the tier, including Sawk, Primeape, Musharna, and Swords Dance Samurott. This Misdreavus can perform several roles on a team at once, from a wall to a supporter to a stallbreaker, freeing up room for extra teammates. Its typing and Levitate really benefit this set as well, as it really appreciates an immunity to Spikes and a neutrality to Stealth Rock when switching in. Even so, Misdreavus can't switch in excessively as its lack of reliable recovery make it prone to being worn down, and cannot take too much pressure from the opposing team as a result. Nevertheless, Misdreavus still gets the job done as long as you play it conservatively.</p> <p>Will-O-Wisp is a great move for Misdreavus, shutting down nearly every physical attacker in the tier and further enhancing its defensive capabilities. Shadow Ball is a reliable STAB attack with decent power and a nice potential Special Defense drop, which makes it the main option for the second slot. Foul Play, on the other hand, punishes Swords Dance users as well as Pokemon that would normally get a free switch into Misdreavus, such as Swellow and Zangoose. This makes it an option for the attacking move on this set, but do note that it's not nearly as reliable as Shadow Ball. Pain Split, the third move, is Misdreavus's only form of recovery outside of the undesirable Rest, and it works decently with its relatively low HP stat. The last moveslot depends on your team's needs; Taunt is an excellent move for shutting down setup Pokemon and walls, and protecting Misdreavus against status. Heal Bell also provides protection against status, and unlike Taunt, it even provides insurance against things like Scald burns; Heal Bell also supports Misdreavus's team. Do note that the best partners for Misdreavus have access to Heal Bell anyway, so it's generally not preferred. Finally, Perish Song gets a mention on full stall teams as it can be invaluable for dealing with the last Pokemon on the field when you can't shuffle around your opponent's team anymore.</p> <p>The EV spread allows Misdreavus to outspeed Adamant Rampardos, and focuses on physical bulk, both because Misdreavus's typing is much more suited for tanking physical hits due to its immunities and because it gives it good all-around defenses. A specially defensive spread is viable, but there are better Pokemon suited for this role and it doesn't bring out Misdreavus's best potential. With a physically defensive spread, Misdreavus is also capable of easily beating anything slower than it that hates being burned or Taunted, including the various Stealth Rock leads inhabiting the tier such as Golem, Piloswine, Regirock and Metang. Misdreavus can also use various other moves in the first slot such as Toxic or Thunder Wave, but Will-O-Wisp has the most utility overall and really helps it take more hits.</p> <p>Because Misdreavus lacks reliable recovery, a Wish passer is highly recommended to help make up for that. Lickilicky and Audino are outstanding partners that fill this role, as they both carry Wish and Heal Bell (freeing Misdreavus up to use another move in the fourth slot) and they have excellent defensive synergy with it. This set tends to force many switches, and when that's combined with the ability to spinblock, entry hazards work extremely well with Misdreavus. Ironically, some of the best entry hazard setters for Misdreavus are the ones it scares out; Golem, Piloswine, Regirock and Metang can set up Stealth Rock, they all have decent synergy with it, and can beat many of Misdreavus's counters, such as Skuntank, Swellow and Zangoose (provided it doesn't run Foul Play for the latter two). This Misdreavus works well on many different teams due to the prevalence of the threats it's able to stop, and will always do well if played correctly.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>With a Nasty Plot set, Misdreavus can function well on offensive teams in need of a spinblocker with some endurance that doesn't give up any offensive momentum. Thanks to its good Speed, Misdreavus can be used to break down bulky walls with its fast Taunt or cripple offensive threats with its fast Will-O-Wisp. Nasty Plot Misdreavus is also capable of defeating or at least severely denting most of its normal counters. For these reasons, this set is viable, and it's surprisingly threatening as well, with Nasty Plot boosting Misdreavus's below-average Special Attack of 269 all the way up to 538 in a single turn.</p> <p>Shadow Ball is Misdreavus's strongest and most reliable STAB, with good power, perfect accuracy and a decent chance to lower the opposing Pokemon's Special Defense. The main coverage move, Thunderbolt, is probably the biggest surprise to the opponent when they see it; it OHKOes Swellow with no boosts, and with a single boost and Stealth Rock support, it OHKOes and 2HKOes Mandibuzz and Skuntank respectively, something Misdreavus would never dream of doing otherwise. Finally, the two moves in the fourth slot are down to your team's needs; Taunt eases setup, protects Misdreavus from status, and lets it break down special walls such as Lickilicky and Altaria, but Will-O-Wisp provides a much more reliable way for breaking down Skuntank and helps Misdreavus provide support against offensive teams.</p> <p>This variant of Misdreavus appreciates Wish support, as it loses out on a lot of bulk and longevity with an offensive set. Lickilicky and Audino prove to be great candidates with Wish and Heal Bell, and they provide great type synergy with Misdreavus. Swords Dance Lickilicky can even come together with it to make an effective offensive core, although it can't provide Wish support. The EV spread outspeeds positive-natured base 80s, maximizes power, and the rest just goes into bulk, as Misdreavus's excellent typing and passable bulk helps it set up. Maximum Speed investment can be used, but Misdreavus isn't really outspeeding anything notable with it, as the most common Pokemon that hits Misdreavus's Speed tier is Sawk, which usually runs an Adamant nature. A bulkier spread can be used as well, but Misdreavus really appreciates being able to outspeed non-Choice Scarf Braviary, Gardevoir and Drifblim. Substitute is a viable move in the last slot to ease setup in a similar fashion to Taunt but causes Misdreavus to wear itself down much too quickly. Pain Split is another option to recover lost health, but Misdreavus rarely gets an opportunity to do this and would usually like to spend that time doing something else. Hidden Power Fighting can be used over Thunderbolt to hit Sawsbuck, Shiftry, and Cacturne, but missing super effective coverage against Mandibuzz and Swellow isn't usually worth it. This set supports its team in a much different way than the defensive set; it punches holes in the opposing team for another sweeper to come in and clean up. Do note that this set is not meant to sweep entire teams— it just softens them up.</p>"

  "Girafarig": {
    "overview": "<p>Girafarig is a bit of a one-trick pony—while its two heads and extremely generous movepool might suggest otherwise, it cannot perform most roles without being outclassed. However, a unique Psychic / Normal typing, two immunities in Ghost and Grass (the latter being courtesy of its ability, Sap Sipper), and access to Calm Mind let it act as a decent Baton Passer. Even so, Girafarig's mediocre offensive stats and poor defenses means that you are often better off using one of the many other offensive Psychic-types in NU, such as Musharna and Gardevoir.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A dual screens set might seem like a good option, but Gardevoir is infinitely better for this role for various reasons. However, if a Grass immunity is needed, Girafarig is a decent user of them. Physical sets are usable but Miltank is generally better as a physical Normal-type attacker. Girafarig has a secondary STAB move in Zen Headbutt as well as access to moves such as Earthquake and Crunch that differentiates it in this role from Miltank, however. Choiced Girafarig sets might seem like good options, but again, Gardevoir is better for this role. Girafarig can run a support role due to its access to moves such as Magic Coat, Whirlwind, Taunt, and Thunder Wave, but it is way too frail to run such a set. Girafarig could try running other variants of Baton Pass sets with moves such as Work Up and Charge Beam. On a similar note, a more defensive Baton Pass set with Substitute / Amnesia / Baton Pass / Foul Play takes lets Girafarig Baton Pass more reliably, but defensive boosts don't accomplish much by themselves. Shadow Ball hits Psychic-types but Girafarig is hard-pressed for moveslots.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Even though Girafarig is seemingly easy to counter, Baton Pass means that it won't be staying in on said counter most of the time and will swap out to an appropriate switch-in for it. Steel-types such as Bastiodon, Probopass, and Metang are excellent counters to Girafarig; Bastiodon is particularly effective due to Roar. Pursuit trappers such as pivot Liepard are immune to its Psychic STAB and can trap it; this fact is further augmented by Liepard's access to Encore, which lets it lock Girafarig into Calm Mind. Skuntank is a seemingly excellent counter, but it is outsped by Girafarig, which can simply Baton Pass and escape Skuntank's Pursuit. Perish Song Misdreavus can stop Girafarig's sweep in its tracks even if it chooses to Baton Pass to a teammate. Taunt users such as Serperior and Mandibuzz are great counters to Girafarig, although the latter is 2HKOed by Thunderbolt. Users of phazing moves can deal with Girafarig by wiping away its Calm Mind boosts. Physical attackers that outspeed Girafarig, such as Sawsbuck, can KO it before it can Baton Pass out to a teammate or utilize the Calm Mind boosts itself.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>This set lets Girafarig differentiate itself from other Psychic-types with its immunities and secondary Normal-type STAB. Baton Pass is the main move on the set and lets Girafarig pass its Calm Mind boosts; it can also be used for dry passing, which lets Girafarig ease prediction as well as escape Pursuit. The Special Defense boosts granted by Calm Mind allow Girafarig to set up on weak special attackers and pass these boosts to teammates. Calm Mind also means that Girafarig can take on the role of a sweeper in a last-Pokemon situation or if said teammate cannot switch in safely. Psychic is an obligatory STAB move and hits common Pokemon such as Sawk, Gurdurr, and Roselia hard. Hyper Voice is the move of choice in the fourth slot as it provides good coverage alongside Psychic, hitting the Dark- and Psychic-types that easily shrug off a Psychic. It should be noted, however, that the combination of the previously mentioned STAB moves is resisted by Steel-types, so Thunderbolt is a viable option to hit them hard. Mandibuzz is also a very important target that Thunderbolt hits, as specially defensive variants are 2HKOed after Stealth Rock while physically defensive variants are 2HKOed with no prior damage.</p> <p>A spread of 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe is viable as it lets Girafarig take on a more primary Baton Passing role. A Substitute + Calm Mind set is usable with Baton Pass, Hyper Voice, and maximum HP investment; keep in mind, however, that Ghost-types will beat this set. Grass Knot is an interesting option to hit Seismitoad and Golem, as is Hidden Power Ground to hit Probopass, Bastiodon, and Skuntank, but both are relatively weak against other threats. Golem partners well with Girafarig, as it can deal with Skuntank and Steel-types that are troublesome for Girafarig to handle. In addition, it can lure in Grass-type attacks from various threats, which lets Girafarig set up on said threats. Pokemon that can take advantage of Calm Mind boosts are great partners; Charizard is an excellent example. Wish support from the likes of Alomomola and Lickilicky is valuable to Girafarig so that it can set up on threats even after it has taken damage after Baton Passing once. Substitute can be used over Calm Mind but Sawsbuck is usually better when it comes to SubPass.</p>"

  "Pineco": {
    "overview": "<p>With access to all three forms of entry hazards, the coveted Rapid Spin, and the handy ability Sturdy, Pineco has carved itself a great niche as a suicide entry hazard lead in NU. The ability to quickly set up multiple layers of entry hazards and get emergency early-game spins off is an absolute blessing to hyper offensive teams in NU, and Pineco does not disappoint in this role. Unfortunately, Pineco is limited to doing just that, as there are literally no other reasons to use it. It also faces extreme competition from other suicide leads such as Cacturne and Golem, which are faster and bring offensive presence to the field. Despite this, Pineco has a very unique niche as an entry hazard setter, and it pulls it off well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Don't even think about it. Pineco should never be used for ANYTHING aside from quick entry hazards and emergency Rapid Spins, and as a result has no better options it can use.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The quirky thing about Pineco is that you often aren't looking for a counter for Pineco itself—you're looking for a counter for the entry hazards it sets up. Taunt works extremely well at accomplishing this, preventing Pineco from doing anything. As a result, Pokemon such as Skuntank, Misdreavus, Serperior, and Samurott are effective counters. Magic Bounce and Magic Coat can also get the job done; while they do require slightly more prediction than Taunt, they can effectively use Pineco's own entry hazards against it. Breaking its Sturdy—whether it be from status, multi-hit moves such as Rock Blast, Mold Breaker, or Fake Out—also works well to prevent multiple layers of entry hazards, although many of these methods struggle to prevent at least one layer against Endure variants. Substitute users can also set up all over Pineco, but they fail to prevent Pineco from setting up entry hazards. The Custap lead set is even easier set up on, as Substitute isn't even required. Finally, the Rapid Spinners of the tier do very well against Pineco, as Armaldo, Torkoal, and Wartortle are all capable of defeating it one-on-one and can easily rid the field of its entry hazards.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Custap Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Pineco is played as a lead; it aims to set up as many entry hazards as possible in the first few turns of the match, and does not last for long. Its access to multiple forms of entry hazards sets it apart from the likes of other hazard setters in the tier, and between its ability Sturdy and the Custap Berry, Pineco is near guaranteed to get up at least a few layers of entry hazards or a potential Rapid Spin off, exhibiting its ability to be immediately useful to its team.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is an obvious staple on this set as Pineco is near guaranteed to set it up, making for an excellent wielder of the move. The choice between Spikes and Toxic Spikes can often be a difficult one; however, with the former often being easier to maintain thanks to the abundance of grounded Poison-types in NU, Spikes tends to have more utility. Toxic Spikes can be invaluable against teams that lack a grounded Poison-type, though. Rapid Spin occupies the third slot, and is what separates it from Dwebble—the ability to get a single emergency spin off before dying often makes a world of a difference over the course of a match. Finally, Endure is the preferred move in the last slot, as it ensures Pineco gets into Custap range safely and helps it to bypass Mold Breakers such as Sawk and multi-hit move users such as Golem. Bug Bite is another viable option to be considered; while it is incredibly situational and rarely sees use, it does have some utility, as it can 2HKO Gardevoir and Ludicolo. However, it sees next to no use otherwise, and because of that, Endure is often the more practical and useful choice.</p> <p>With maximum Speed investment and a Speed-boosting nature, Pineco is able to outspeed Modest Shell Smash Torkoal as well as standard Piloswine and Regirock. Zero investment in bulk and a Defense-lowering nature helps Pineco get into Custap range easier; for example, Golurk's Shadow Punch is now guaranteed to bring it down to 1 HP, where Pineco can respond appropriately with its Custap Berry activated. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature can potentially allow Pineco to survive a few hits and set up more entry hazards, but it sadly does not avoid any relevant 2HKOs with the above spread and makes it more reliant on Endure to reach Custap range. Toxic is a notable move that can be used in the last slot, allowing Pineco to potentially cripple Pokemon it couldn't touch before (which is basically everything). Endure and Bug Bite generally have more utility, though. Finally, Explosion is viable as well—while its damage output isn't outstanding due to Pineco's poor Attack stat, it does see use in ensuring that a teammate gets a free switch-in should Pineco be fully set up. Pineco does not accomplish this often, though, and thus Explosion is not preferred.</p> <p>Ghost-types are near mandatory for Pineco's success, as Pineco fares poorly against Rapid Spinners in general and leaves its entry hazards vulnerable to being spun away, Ghost-types help this case by spinblocking, making Golurk, Misdreavus, Haunter, and Drifblim outstanding partners. Additionally, offensive teams love Pineco's ability to provide quick entry hazards and get potential emergency spins off; this makes Pokemon such as Charizard, Samurott, and Sawk excellent partners as well. For the most part, though, Pineco is fairly self-supporting; required teammates are minimal outside of Ghost-types, and it can work on most offensive teams without many synergy issues.</p>"
      },
      "Suicide Lead (Level 1)": {
        "description": "<p>While this set is a bit less reliable than the first set in terms of ensuring multiple layers of entry hazards, it is capable of doing some major damage to the opposing lead if played correctly. As the name suggests, it needs to be used at level 1, so one might question how this is possible. The trick, however, lies in Pineco's hidden weapon, Pain Split, which effectively acts as a pseudo-Super Fang and simultaneously restores Pineco back to full health. The goal of the set is simple: set up as many entry hazards as possible until Pineco's Berry Juice is activated, restoring it back to full health. Follow that up by continuously spamming Pain Split until the opposing Pokemon is weakened enough so that it can be picked off by something else on your team. Finally, set up one final layer of entry hazards before you are KOed, either a layer of Spikes or Toxic Spikes, depending on the opposing team. This set is extremely efficient at defeating Life Orb users, as it is capable of bringing them down low enough where they will die to their own Life Orb recoil. Obviously, this set has many flaws—Substitute, Taunt, multi-hit move users, and Mold Breakers, to name a few—but it should be noted that this set can and will cripple an opposing Pokemon if given the chance.</p> <p>Rapid Spin has some potential in the last slot, allowing Pineco to remove any potential entry hazards from its side of the field. It is also notable for allowing Pineco to at least do something should it ever be Taunted; however, it is far less reliable at spinning than the first set and often never finds the time to use it. Toxic is another considerable choice, allowing Pineco to whittle down an opposing lead via poison. However, Pineco would rather use free turns to set up entry hazards than use Toxic. Maximum Speed investment allows for a Speed tie with the occasional opposing level 1 Pineco; while this does not often come into play, it still can prove to be relevant in some one-on-one scenarios. Partners include the obvious Ghost-types, as spinblocking is absolutely invaluable when it comes to maintaining Pineco's entry hazards. Offensive sweepers always benefit from Pineco's early-game entry hazard provision as well, and make for excellent partners. As stated before, this set is far less reliable at ensuring hazards than the first set; however, if you want a way to prevent Pineco from becoming setup bait, this set is for you.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Even when Dunsparce was first introduced, it was ignored and neglected. Now, Dunsparce has entered a new low in usage; it isn't recommended on any serious NU team, as there are many other Normal-types in the tier that can outclass Dunsparce in many aspects. The only reason Dunsparce should ever be looked upon is its access to Glare and its ability, Serene Grace, together granting it a niche with a high paraflinch chance. With that said, Dunsparce cannot just fit onto any team; serious support is needed for it to be of use.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Dunsparce only has one viable set, it has many other options that require much more team support. A RestTalk set is viable with Coil, but unless Dunsparce can set up quickly, it will be easily defeated. Aqua Tail is an alternative coverage move against Rock- and Ground-type Pokemon, but it doesn't offer much beyond that. Finally, a combination of Curse and Gyro Ball is plausible, as it not only raises Dunsparce's Attack and Defense, but it makes Gyro Ball stronger by moving slower against its adversary.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Dunsparce is in most cases very easy to defeat, but if it begins setting up with Coil or spreads paralysis to your team, it becomes increasingly difficult to defeat. Taunt users, specifically Misdreavus and Liepard, are prime choices to shut down Dunsparce. Pokemon that can potentially brush off paralysis, such as Shed Skin Dragonair, Gurdurr, and Roselia, can easily set up on Dunsparce. Substitute users such as Serperior and Eelektross can avoid Dunsparce's Glare and phaze it out with Dragon Tail before it can set up.</p> <p>There is a plethora of Pokemon that can outright KO Dunsparce; most special attackers such as Gardevoir can tear through Dunsparce, but they must be wary of Glare. Fighting-types and strong physical attackers, such as Sawk and Swords Dance Armaldo, can handle Dunsparce easily.</p> <p>Ironically, if Dunsparce is statused, it is rendered useless. Misdreavus and Probopass can status Dunsparce and take very little from its attacks. Toxic also completely checkmates Dunsparce, as it has no way to remove status by itself. Lastly, the majority of physical walls, such as Alomomola and Golem, can sponge any of Dunsparce's attacks.</p>",

Thanks to Coil, Roost, and its viable defenses, Dunsparce can run a defensive set. While its Special Defense isn't great, it is enough to tank hits. To reach an acceptable level of bulk, two Coils are usually needed. Special attackers have some issues with it as well. The goal of this set is to paralyze the opponent and either switch into a teammate to set up or continually cause the foe to flinch.</p> <p>Glare is recommended in the first moveslot; while its initial accuracy might not be perfect, after a Coil boost, Glare is a dangerous move, as it can paralyze any Pokemon, even Ground-types. However, if you want to have a STAB move for Dunsparce, Body Slam can be used, boasting a 60% chance to paralyze the foe. Coil is an important move to the set as well, as it allows Dunsparce to be a decent physical wall and increase its offensive prowess. Choosing which move to use in the third moveslot reflects on the choice of the first moveslot. If Body Slam is used, Rock Slide is recommended, as having two similar STAB moves of the same type generally isn't a good idea. If Glare is used, Headbutt is the move of choice. Roost is the final move of the set, healing Dunsparce in a pinch and maintaining its HP throughout the match.</p> <p>Serene Grace is the key aspect to the set, as it allows Dunsparce to consistently immobilize the opponent. Leftovers increases Dunsparce's longevity. Dunsparce runs a defensive EV spread so it can tank as much attacks as possible, rather than attacking. 252 Special Defense EVs help balance Dunsparce's defenses after a Coil boost, and a Careful nature maximizes it, raising it to acceptable heights. As for other move options, Bite can be used in the third moveslot to deal with Ghost-types while still attaining the paraflinch strategy. Thunder Wave can be used in the first moveslot for a reliable 100% accuracy, unlike Glare. However, after a Coil, Glare outclasses Thunder Wave, as it not only has reliable accuracy, but can hit Ground-types, something Thunder Wave cannot. Finally, Substitute is an option, as status completely cripples Dunsparce. It works well with Roost, allowing Dunsparce to survive much longer. However, finding a moveslot for it can be difficult.</p> <p>Since Dunsparce's goal is to spread paralysis to your adversary, Pokemon that appreciate slower opponents are good partners to Dunsparce. Mixed Samurott and Choice Band Golurk aren't very fast, so they'll appreciate slower opponents. They can also deal with Golem and Gigalith, two Pokemon Dunsparce can't scar. Status conditions annoy Dunsparce, so clerics such as Musharna and Miltank are great choices; the former being able to deal with Tangela, a Pokemon that walls Dunsparce, while the latter can heal statuses that are inflicted on Dunsparce while aiding in spreading paralysis to Pokemon. Poison-types such as Skuntank are good allies, as they can absorb the dreaded Toxic Spikes that Dunsparce despises. Even when it's fully invested in Special Defense, Dunsparce is still weak to special attacks. Special walls, such as Gardevoir, Regice, and Flareon, can take the special attacks for Dunsparce; in return, Dunsparce takes the physical attacks for them. Finally, Ghost-types such as Golurk and Misdreavus bring grief to Dunsparce, only fearing the rare Bite. Skuntank is a good counter to both of them, only fearing of Misdreavus's Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

  "Shuckle": {
    "overview": "<p>In a nutshell, Shuckle is a bad Pokemon. Despite its massive defenses, it comes with many flaws. It has an absolutely horrendous base 20 HP, which makes it not as bulky as its defenses might suggest. Shuckle also lacks any offensive presence whatsoever—not even Seismic Toss—which leaves it setup fodder for many Pokemon. Shuckle's typing is also not remarkable defensively, only giving it one useful resistance in Normal. What Shuckle can do is wall common Normal-types, set up Stealth Rock, and use a couple of utility moves such as Encore, Knock Off, and Toxic. However, this is not enough to justify Shuckle's use, as all of these things can also be done by much better NU Pokemon. Overall, Shuckle is much more trouble than it's worth, and one who intends to build a serious team should stay as far away from it as possible.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shuckle has very few viable option aside from those listed. It gets Contrary and can use it with Shell Smash to boost its defenses, but no recovery and lack of offensive presence let it down. Rest could serve as a recovery move, but the sleep mechanics along with Shuckle's massive entry hazard weakness make this a bad idea. Shuckle also gets some other gimmicky moves such as Power Split, Power Trick, Sunny Day, Guard Split, and Acupressure. Unfortunately, Shuckle's utility is already very limited, and none of these moves allow Shuckle to do anything useful.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Entry hazards are the best way to dispose of Shuckle. Any form of entry hazards will wear down Shuckle at a moderate pace and make it much easier to remove. Users of Substitute can also take advantage of Shuckle, although they must beware of Encore. Steel-types such as Metang and Klang can laugh at Shuckle's attempts to do anything useful and hit it hard with their STAB moves. Poison-types such as Roselia and Garbodor do not mind Toxic and can wear Shuckle down with repeated attacks. In general, any Pokemon that can hit Shuckle super effectively can make quick work of it. Finally, Taunt and Trick users such as Mandibuzz and Rotom-S can put Shuckle out of commission and in general prevent it from doing anything meaningful.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wall": {
        "description": "<p>This is Shuckle's best bet at accomplishing anything in NU. With this set, Shuckle can use its somewhat usable bulk to set up Stealth Rock and disrupt the opponent while it dies at a moderate pace. Shuckle can wall Normal-types such as Kangaskhan, which does help it in a few situations. Stealth Rock is Shuckle's most useful support move, especially with the many Pokemon weak to it in NU. Toxic is Shuckle's only real way of doing any damage and can wear down bulkier Pokemon such as Alomomola. Encore can lock other Pokemon into setup moves so Shuckle can switch out to a teammate that can remove them. Finally, Knock Off removes Eviolite from Misdreavus, Roselia, and Metang, among other useful items. Protect, however, is useful if one aims to stall with Toxic damage.</p> <p>Shuckle aims to go physically defensive in order to wall Normal-types and take at least one hit from Sawk. Wartortle, Mold Breaker Sawk, and Taunt Samurott could be useful to prevent entry hazards, as Shuckle is terribly weak to them. Cleric support from the likes of Misdreavus, Audino, and Musharna could also be useful, as Shuckle despises status. Wish support from Alomomola and Audino is also useful because Shuckle lacks reliable recovery.</p>"

  "Sneasel": {
    "overview": "<p>Sneasel has the makings of a good sweeper: it is incredibly fast, has acceptable attack power and it has fantastic dual STABs in Dark and Ice. This allows Sneasel to perform a rather specific niche in targeting notable threats, such as Serperior, Jynx, Swellow, Exeggutor, Haunter, and Golurk. Sneasel is a total glass cannon though, as it is extremely frail with 55 / 55 / 75 defenses. Sneasel's biggest drawback however is that its moves have only average power at best, with none of its STAB options reaching 80 base power. This really hurts its offensive potential and forces it to only target Pokemon weak to its STABs. Thankfully, it does a decent job at it, particularly being the best Jynx trapper due to Dark STAB and greater speed, making Sneasel a very specialized Pokemon in the tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Unfortunately, much of Sneasel's movepool consists of low-powered moves, making most of them unviable. Sneasel has access to Swords Dance, but it is very frail and still lacks the power needed to sweep its foes. The combination of Beat Up and King's Rock can be annoying, but it weakens with each fallen teammate, making it unreliable. Counter with Focus Sash is a perfectly plausible strategy since it works well with Pickpocket, and Sneasel attracts physical attackers. Linked attacks, such as Rock Blast, and entry hazards however render it useless, and it's a one-time use.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Due to Sneasel's pathetic defenses, anything that isn't hit super effectively by Sneasel can either KO it from the get-go or stall Sneasel long enough to beat it. However, the real danger Sneasel poses is its ability to swiftly threaten or KO its targets, as even switching out is a risk due to Pursuit. If you keep Sneasel's main targets off the field, then it won't be able to threaten much else. Fighting-types are the best counters against Sneasel, but due to Sneasel's high Speed stat, they should be equipped with a Choice Scarf and/or not weakened. Priority, particularly Mach Punch and Bullet Punch, destroys Sneasel by hitting its weak Defense while bypassing its Speed, rendering it helpless. Specialized counters aren't required to deal with Sneasel, as many Pokemon can handle it, but be careful with your frailer sweepers that Sneasel can prey on, as it will quickly dispatch of them.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>This set capitalizes on both of its wonderful dual STABs; it's designed to be a catch-all answer against top threats. Pursuit ensures the demise of Jynx, Kadabra and Haunter by threatening an OHKO regardless of whether they switch out or not, as well as finishing off weakened threats in general, making Sneasel a good 'finisher'. Ice Punch is Sneasel's most reliable STAB, as it nets good coverage against most of the tier, severely denting threats such as Serperior and Braviary hard and is Sneasel's strongest attack against Fighting types, namely Primeape and Sawk who would usually switch in and OHKO Sneasel. Sneasel's Dark-type STAB of choice depends on type of targets you wish to face. Punishment is handy against setup Pokemon, such as Calm Mind Musharna and Baton Pass teams, while providing a more reliable Dark STAB against Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon, such as Misdreavus and Gardevoir who might refuse to switch to avoid massive Pursuit damage. Foul Play uses the opponent's Attack stat against them, which makes up for Sneasel's lack of raw power. Foul Play can notably OHKO Golurk, Zangoose, and +2 Scolipede. It also fares well against Choice Band users, while still deterring the frailer Fighting-types from switching in directly. However, it is ironically less effective against Ghost- and Psychic-types since they tend to have low Attack stats, meaning bulkier targets will be a hassle to take down.</p> <p>Ice Shard snipes faster threats, notably Swellow, Ninjask, Unburden Drifblim, and weakened Choice Scarf users, giving Sneasel more utility as a trapper and a priority user. Taunt is useful for stopping Misdreavus, Gardevoir, and Musharna from using status moves, forcing them to switch out, only to be hit hard by Pursuit. Note that Ice Shard can be used regardless of what item Sneasel is holding, while Taunt should only be used on Eviolite Sneasel, who has a better time surviving attacks.</p> <p>The EV spread allows Sneasel to switch in against Stealth Rock four times at full HP, as well as maximizing its Speed and power. Low Kick can dent Rock- or Steel-type switch-ins, such as Probopass, Gigalith, Bastiodon and Carracosta, but this works better with Life Orb to secure more 2HKOs. One option is to eschew Ice Punch for both Ice Shard for priority and Low Kick for heavy targets, but this loses consistency against targets such as Serperior, Rotom-S, Golem, Eviolite Fraxure, and Fighting-types. Eviolite allows Sneasel to take resisted hits from its primary targets well and increases Taunt's viability; Life Orb allows Sneasel to use its STABs the best way it can and gives a notable power increase against neutral targets. Punishment works better on Eviolite Sneasel, who can better take the boosted attacks of its primary targets (Ghosts and Psychics) and retaliate with huge boosted damage; Life Orb Sneasel should stick to Foul Play to secure more KOs and improve its revenge killing potential. While neither ability is of much help at all to Sneasel, Inner Focus is marginally more useful to prevent flinches, although Sneasel takes massive damage from Fake Out anyway, and rarely gets flinched by other moves since it's faster than the majority of the tier. Brick Break can be used to hit lighter threats, such as Mawile or Audino, hard.</p> <p>Sneasel needs a lot of help dealing with the numerous threats it cannot defeat. Good teammates are Pokemon who appreciate Sneasel's ability to threaten and remove certain problematic types. Fighting-types and Scolipede make for remarkable teammates, as they have great synergy with Sneasel, taking each other's weaknesses well. Ground-types like having Jynx, Grass-, and Flying-types eliminated. Teammates that can hit hard are highly recommended, as they can compensate for Sneasel's lack of brute strength.</p>"

  "Ursaring": {
    "overview": "<p>Ursaring is a very threatening Pokemon, taking advantage of otherwise crippling status conditions with two abilities that benefit from them: Quick Feet and Guts. Quick Feet fixes Ursaring's Speed issues and allows it to become one of the scariest late-game sweepers in NU. Guts, on the other hand, boosts Ursaring's already massive Attack to sky-high levels, allowing it to at least dent everything in the tier. Ursaring also has a good movepool to work with that allows it to get past Ghost-, Rock-, and Steel-types, something that not many other Normal-types in the tier can do. However, Ursaring is let down by its poor typing, being easy pickings for the numerous Fighting-types running around NU. It also struggles to maintain longevity, as the status Orbs that Ursaring tends to hold chip its life away; this, combined with its only above-average bulk, means that it won't be sticking around for too long. It also faces stiff competition from Swellow and Zangoose, two other Normal-types that also use status to their advantage. It does, however, have the advantage of being faster (with Quick Feet) than Zangoose, and it is more powerful than Swellow (with Guts), while also having considerably more bulk. In addition, Ursaring has a better movepool than both of them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Belly Drum can be used alongside Quick Feet to make Ursaring an insanely powerful and decently fast attacker; however, it's very rare that Ursaring will be able to survive a hit afterwards, and even if it does, Toxic Orb recoil will take it out. Ursaring also has access to many more offensive moves, such as the elemental punches, Gunk Shot, Seed Bomb, Shadow Claw, and Stone Edge; however, they are outclassed as the options above have more coverage or power (or both). A SubPunch set can be considered, but it's hard to set up; Close Combat is almost always better for a Fighting-type move, and the SubSD set utilizes Substitute better. Bulk Up is another boosting move that Ursaring has access to, but Swords Dance is preferred because Ursaring likes the immediate power provided by it. Much like many other Pokemon, Ursaring can use the RestTalk strategy, but while combining this with Guts or Quick Feet might seem good on paper, it is too gimmicky and hard to pull off in practice, as Ursaring will almost never survive the three turns of sleep. In addition, the luck reliance RestTalk forces into play can be hard to account with a Ghost-type on the opponent's team.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>There are quite a few ways to defeat Ursaring, although it ultimately comes down to what set it's using. Alomomola and Tangela can deal with the Quick Feet set well, as they aren't weak to any of its moves and can strike it down with their STABs. They can even use Protect Ursaring as setup bait to heal with Wish or Synthesis, respectively. Be wary though, as Alomomola is setup bait for the SubSD set, and the Guts variant defeats them both. Foul Play Misdreavus does excellently against Quick Feet Ursaring, as it only gets 3HKOed by Crunch and it will almost always 2HKO back after Stealth Rock. Regirock also does a decent job against Quick Feet Ursaring, as it doesn't take too much from Earthquake (3HKO at best) and can hit back hard with its Rock-type STAB. Revenge killing the Quick Feet variant might be hard because it outspeeds the majority of the unboosted metagame, but the other sets will be outsped by any decently fast threat. Beware though, as most Pokemon can't OHKO Ursaring and it can OHKO most of them back. Kadabra is a common exception; it outspeeds any Ursaring variant, and thanks to Focus Sash, it always survives a hit and 2HKOes back with its Psychic-type STAB. Choice Scarf Primeape and Sawk are also great answers, as they outspeed and OHKO with Close Combat. If Ursaring has successfully gotten a Substitute up, something is almost always going down, as an Ursaring with Substitute up is near impossible to revenge kill. If all else fails, just try to bank on the residual damage that status Orbs and entry hazards provide to take it down.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Quick Feet": {
        "description": "<p>Say hello to Quick Feet Ursaring, one of the best late-game sweepers available in the NU tier. This is Ursaring's easiest set to use, and it doesn't compromise effectiveness to achieve this. Quick Feet fixes Ursaring's disastrous base Speed in the matter of a turn, letting it match up against some of NU's most common threats, such as non-Choice Scarf Jynx and Primeape. Although this set mainly focuses on Speed, Ursaring still hits like a truck thanks to its gigantic base Attack. Do note that Ursaring will still be outsped by common Choice Scarf users, such as Rotom-F and Sawk.</p> <p>Facade is the STAB of choice, as it reaches a whopping 140 Base Power after Toxic Orb is activated, becoming Ursaring's strongest attacking move that doesn't have any drawbacks. Earthquake hits the Rock- and Steel-types that resist Facade and also hits Metang for super effective damage, something that no other move on this set accomplishes. It should be noted that, despite being super effective against Electric-type Pokemon, Earthquake will not hit them as hard as Facade, making the latter the primary option. Crunch is used in the third moveslot because of its ability to hit Ghost-types, such as Drifblim, Misdreavus, and Haunter, that are immune to every other move on the set super effectively. Much like Earthquake though, a neutral Facade is always stronger than a super effective Crunch, so it should only be used on Ghost-type Pokemon. The last moveslot is a toss-up between Swords Dance and Protect. Swords Dance is an excellent move, as it turns Ursaring into a terrifying sweeper and it can find opportunities to set up on weak attackers such as Lickilicky, Garbodor, and Seismitoad. However, taking even these attacks combined with Toxic Orb recoil will greatly shorten Ursaring's lifespan. Protect is an alternative option, as it guarantees the activation of Toxic Orb, allowing Ursaring to act as a pseudo-revenge killer; Protect also turns Ursaring into a good scout for Choice-locked Pokemon.</p> <p>Jolly is chosen over Adamant because Jolly allows Ursaring to outspeed everything up to positive-natured Pokemon with base 105 Speed. Toxic Orb is the status Orb of choice, as Quick Feet doesn't negate the 50% Attack drop that burn causes. Close Combat can be used in place of Earthquake, as it is more powerful, hits Dark-, Normal-, and Ice-type Pokemon harder than Facade, and gets a super effective hit on Rock- and Steel-types, just like Earthquake. However, the power difference really isn't notable, and having Ursaring's defenses dropped by a stage every time Close Combat is used makes it very susceptible to revenge killers. As far as partners go, Ursaring fits well with almost every Pokemon; however, it really likes the Encore support Wynaut provides, as it provides a free turn to set up Swords Dance. Gothorita can trap and remove several common physical walls such as Alomomola, Weezing, and to a lesser extent, Tangela. This variant of Ursaring appreciates entry hazard support more than any other, as it helps unboosted Ursaring net some specific KOs on Pokemon, such as guaranteeing a 2HKO on Misdreavus with Crunch. The best Pokemon for this job would be Poison-types such as Scolipede and Garbodor, as they resist Fighting-type attacks. Golurk is another great entry hazard setter because it's immune to Fighting-type attacks. Ursaring also likes the company of revenge killers and hard-hitting tanks on its team, as they can take care of opposing revenge killers.</p>"
      },
      "Guts": {
        "description": "<p>Guts Ursaring is a very hard-hitting attacker, demolishing everything in its way with the combination of a massive Attack and a perfect movepool. Facade is the choice of STAB, as it reaches a whopping 140 Base Power after Toxic Orb is activated. Earthquake can hit the Rock- and Steel-types that resist Facade, easily scoring a 2HKO on Regirock and Metang, two of the most common ones, after Stealth Rock. Ghost-type Pokemon are the only Pokemon that take no damage from Facade, and some of the Ghost-types in NU take nothing from Earthquake either. Because of this, Crunch is very useful against them, as it handily scores a super effective hit on every Ghost-type found in Ursaring's homeland; however, Crunch should pretty much only be used for this purpose, as its power is much less than Facade, even when laying a super effective hit on Pokemon. Protect is the main option to occupy Ursaring's last moveslot, as it will guarantee the activation of Ursaring's Toxic Orb while protecting it from taking a hit; this could potentially be life-saving, as Ursaring won't have to take that extra hit before proceeding to destroy the opponent with its Guts-boosted Attack. Swords Dance is a lesser option here, as Guts Ursaring doesn't need its provided power and its low Speed lowers the chance of an effective sweep. However, a +2 Guts-boosted Ursaring's Facade will KO everything in its way, and resistance and immunity issues will be taken care of by Earthquake and Crunch, respectively. Swords Dance will also punish Protect users, such as Alomomola, that try to stall Ursaring out.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is preferred because of the sheer damage output it provides, but a Jolly nature can be used to outrun standard Misdreavus so Ursaring can 2HKO it with Crunch before it does the same with Foul Play. Flame Orb seems like a better choice on paper, but in reality, you'll find Ursaring getting forced out (after a KO, that is) very often, so Toxic Orb is the preferred choice, as it deals less residual damage unless Ursaring stays in for more than three turns. Close Combat can be used in place of Earthquake to hit the same targets and get in a stronger hit on Dark-, Ice-, and Normal-types. However, it lowers Ursaring's defenses afterwards, making it more susceptible to revenge killers. Furthermore, Ursaring will also miss out on 2HKOing Metang, which will then become a threat.</p> <p>Partners for this set are very similar to those of the Quick Feet variant. Wynaut can lock opposing Pokemon into harmless moves for Ursaring to set up on with Swords Dance. Trick Room setters, such as Duosion and Musharna, are also excellent teammates, as this Ursaring fits well on Trick Room teams due to its low Speed. Furthermore, Ursaring can come in on Ghost-types that most Trick Room setters despise, and in return, they can come in on Fighting-type attacks. If you're using Ursaring on a Trick Room team, then this EV spread is recommended: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD with a Brave nature. Similarly, just providing Ursaring with paralysis support lets it shred teams apart. Entry hazard setters are also highly appreciated, as with them, Ursaring can net a few KOs that it wouldn't be able to otherwise, such as a 2HKO on Regirock. Golurk is the best for this job, as it can come in on Fighting-types and set up Stealth Rock. Scolipede and Garbodor also work wonders, as they resist Fighting-type attacks and can set up Spikes. Revenge killers are also very nice, as this Ursaring is very slow and needs hard-hitting attackers, such as Kadabra and Sawk, removed before attempting to wallbreak. Likewise, Pokemon that appreciate walls such as Probopass and Alomomola removed make for great partners, as this set functions more as a wallbreaker than as a sweeper.</p>"
      },
      "SubSD": {
        "description": "<p>This set might seem inferior to Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary at first, but a closer look reveals that Ursaring is equally as good as it, if not better. The reason lies in Ursaring's better typing, access to Swords Dance, reliable way to hit Rock- and Steel-types, and ability to switch into status and benefit from it. Substitute is a no brainer on this set, as it protects Ursaring from revenge killers and allows it to defeat them, opening up a late-game sweep. Swords Dance boosts Ursaring's already massive Attack to terrifying levels even without maximum investment. Return is used over Facade because this Ursaring doesn't (and shouldn't) hold a status Orb, making Facade situational and almost always weaker. Earthquake hits Rock- and Steel-types hard, providing crucial coverage, and it also does decent damage to Golurk, easily 2HKOing it.</p> <p>The listed EVs allow Ursaring to set up on Alomomola, as it outspeeds it, will never have its Substitutes broken by Waterfall, and can 2HKO with Return after a boost. An alternate spread of 248 HP / 172 Def / 84 Spe can be used to make sure that Miltank and Lickilicky's Body Slams never break Ursaring's Substitutes, but it then finds itself having trouble breaking through walls. You can also use 124 Special Defense EVs to make sure Tangela doesn't break Ursaring's Substitutes with Giga Drain, but this isn't recommended because Tangela is a much rarer sight than Alomomola.</p> <p>A status Orb can be used over Leftovers to activate Guts, but the combined damage from Substitute, the status Orb, and repeated hits will quickly finish Ursaring off; this is why Leftovers is recommended, as it provides recovery instead. Crunch can be used over Earthquake in the last slot to give Ursaring a way to hit Ghost-types such as Drifblim, Haunter, and Misdreavus. This isn't recommended though, as it isn't as strong as Earthquake and Ursaring will then be walled by Steel-types, which are usually harder to take care of. Likewise, Close Combat can be used as a stronger alternative to Earthquake; however, the nasty defense drops take away from the bulk this set has. Close Combat really only hits the virtually non-existent Levitate Bronzor harder and leaves Ursaring much less able to deal with Golurk and Metang, who are potent threats in today's metagame. When it comes to partners, Pursuit trappers are the best, as they eliminate Ghost-types, Pokemon that this set can't handle. Skuntank is the best Pursuit trapper in the tier, but it really doesn't offer much synergy with Ursaring. Entry hazard setters are very useful, as this set can't 2HKO Alomomola or Tangela without them even after a boost. Wynaut can neutralize opponents with Encore to give Ursaring setup opportunities. Lastly, a revenge killer or a hard-hitting tank is useful to handle the small possibility of two revenge killers on the opposing team.</p>"

  "Piloswine": {
    "overview": "<p>Piloswine is one of the best Stealth Rock users in NU thanks to its bulk and power and also makes a very effective lead as a result. While base 100 HP and base 80 Defense are respectable in NU, Eviolite improves Piloswine's physical bulk even further. Piloswine's Thick Fat ability gives it an added advantage against Ice- and Fire-type attacks, the former now being resisted and latter neutralized in tandem with Piloswine's unique Ice / Ground typing. With its typing, Piloswine is a great switch-in to Electric-types such as Rotom-F, thus breaking Volt Switch momentum for the opponent. While many dedicated leads in NU do not stick around for the ends of battles, Piloswine can last long in a game because of its bulk and proves to be valuable for many teams late-game because of its STAB Ice Shard, capable of picking off weakened Pokemon such as Braviary and Rotom-Fan.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Piloswine's role in NU is rather limited due to its movepool. Endeavor + Ice Shard with Focus Sash is an alternative option to be used as a lead, but it is inferior because it sacrifices Piloswine's bulk and longevity. A Curse set with Avalanche can be considered, but this is usually quite unsuccessful because Piloswine has subpar Special Defense which can easily be taken advantage of. Piloswine can try a Choice Band or Life Orb set for more offensive capability, but this is also inferior to the tank set because it is not guaranteed Stealth Rock and wastes Piloswine's bulk as well. Stone Edge and Superpower can be options to consider on such sets; Stone Edge can beat non Choice-Specs Charizard in the lead slot, while Superpower helps against Miltank, Audino, and Scraggy. Piloswine also has access to Light Screen and Reflect, but it would need to sacrifice Eviolite to run screens for a prolonged period with Light Clay, which is not ideal otherwise.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Water-types such as Alomomola and Wartortle are great responses to Piloswine. Alomomola can wall any attack Piloswine uses, and use Scald and Toxic to whittle away its health. Wartortle can similarly use Scald and Toxic to beat Piloswine in addition to being able to spin Stealth Rock away, although it lacks recovery much like Piloswine. Will-O-Wisp Misdreavus can come in on Earthquake or Stealth Rock and proceed to burn Piloswine, thus hindering its ability to deal significant damage. Tangela can also come in on Earthquake and Stealth Rock and is also bulky enough to withstand hits from an Ice-type attack from Piloswine's Ice-type attacks and then retaliate with Giga Drain. Tangela also commonly run Knock Off, which would hurt Piloswine's bulk by removing Eviolite.</p> <p>There are also Pokemon that are strong enough to simply OHKO Piloswine right off the bat and act as checks against it. Choice Banded Fighting-types such as Sawk can come in and kill with Close Combat, and Choice Specs Charizard can OHKO it with Fire Blast. Samurott is also a common attacker that can OHKO Piloswine by running Hydro Pump with Life Orb and can also set up Swords Dance and proceed to use Waterfall. Pokemon such as Simipour, Serperior, Ludicolo, and Seismitoad can also deal significant damage to Piloswine, although they are not always able to land an OHKO on Piloswine and only act as solid responses if Piloswine is weakened enough.</p>",

      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<p>Piloswine makes a great Stealth Rock lead because it ensures that Pokemon such as Garbodor can only get one layer of Spikes up and beats common Stealth Rock leads such as Golem, Regirock, and Probopass with its bulk and STAB Earthquake. Piloswine is even bulky enough to survive Choice Scarf Sawk and Primeape's Close Combats, and can KO them with a combination of Earthquake and Ice Shard. Icicle Spear is used primarily to break Substitutes from Pokemon such as Misdreavus, Mandibuzz, and Braviary, and Ice Shard is used to pick off weakened threats that attempt to capitalize on Piloswine's lackluster Speed. Piloswine's bulk enables it to stay in the game for a longer period of time and also makes it a great switch-in to Electric-type Pokemon seen in Zebstrika and Rotom-F, making it a great way to stop Volt Switch momentum.</p> <p>The EV spread for this set is fairly straightforward, capitalizing on Piloswine's two main selling points: bulk and power. The 16 Speed EVs allow Piloswine to outspeed max Speed Torkoal and attack with Earthquake before it is able to do any damage. Icicle Crash can be considered over Icicle Spear as it is more powerful than Icicle Spear in most instances, but Icicle Spear is generally better because of its ability to break Substitutes and Earthquake is Piloswine's main form of offense regardless. Toxic can also be used over Icicle Spear if one wishes to poison common switch-ins, such as Alomomola and Wartortle. Lastly, an additional EV spread of 240 HP / 156 Atk / 96 Def / 16 Spe with an Impish nature can be used for more bulk. This spread in particular can be used in tandem with Roar due to Piloswine's heightened defensive presence.</p> <p>Spikes support from Garbodor and Roselia is beneficial for Piloswine in order to rack up additional entry hazard damage alongside Stealth Rock. Pokemon that switch in on Water-type moves such as Samurott, Ludicolo, and Serperior also make great partners as well. Pokemon that can switch into Fighting-type attacks also work well; for example, Misdreavus can come in on a Choice-locked Close Combat from Sawk or Primeape and force a switch, thus shifting momentum in your favor. Carracosta boasts great offensive synergy alongside Piloswine because it is able to set up on Normal-type attackers that Piloswine cannot switch into safely such as Swellow and Zangoose, and Piloswine can aid Carracosta by taking down certain Choice Scarfed Pokemon such as Rotom-Frost.</p>"

  "Octillery": {
    "overview": "<p>As a Water-type Pokemon, Octillery is mostly outclassed by Pokemon such as Gorebyss and Seismitoad, and is therefore very rarely seen in the tier. Fortunately, it does have great offenses backed by a powerful STAB Hydro Pump , meaning that it can do huge damage to most opponents, and a wide coverage movepool, meaning that would-be checks need to think twice before switching in; unlike other Water-types, Octillery can hit Water-, Grass-, and Dragon-types for massive damage with the appropriate coverage move. However, it isn't particularly bulky and its Speed is disappointingly low, meaning it will always have to take a hit before being able to strike back.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Although Water Spout might seem tempting, Octillery is slow and not really bulky, meaning that it will almost always go last and will quickly reach the point where Hydro Pump deals more damage. Thunder Wave seems appealing to slow down switch-ins and blast them with an appropriate coverage move, but Octillery is rather frail and has a four-moveslot syndrome. Acid Spray lowers the opponent's Special Defense, but Octillery is better off attacking in the meantime. Signal Beam can be used to hit Ludicolo for massive damage on the switch-in, having a small chance to OHKO Rain Dance variants and doing a respectable chunk to specially defensive variants. A physical set consisting of a variety of moves including Waterfall, Seed Bomb, and Rock Blast is a possibility, but not really viable, as said moves are either not very powerful or unreliable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Most special walls can take on Octillery rather well but must beware of switching directly into Hydro Pump; not much wants to take two Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pumps. Grass-types can take Octillery on rather easily if they switch into Hydro Pump; Roselia in particular can incapacitate the switch-in with Sleep Powder or set up Spikes as Octillery flees. Both Rain Dance and specially defensive variants of Ludicolo are great checks to Octillery, being able to switch into all of its moves, force it out with Giga Drain, or in the case of the Rain Dance set, even set up Rain Dance while it switches out; keep in mind that Rain Dance variants take upwards of 50% damage from Fire Blast, though. RestTalk Mantine can wall Octillery to hell and back, being only 3HKOed 6.98% of the time by Ice Beam after Stealth Rock—and that is for physically defensive variants! Water-types such as Alomomola and Seismitoad hate coming in on Energy Ball, but Octillery rarely uses it and is usually Choice-locked into another move, making them reliable as checks. Altaria and Dragonair can wall Octillery that don't run Ice Beam and can come in on any other Choice-locked attack from those that do.</p> <p>On most teams, checking Octillery offensively is more feasible than trying to wall it. If all else fails, strong attacks such as Choice Band Sawk's Close Combat and Choice Specs Charizard's Hidden Power Grass (after Stealth Rock damage) can easily send the octopus back to the depths of the sea where it came from. Using Grass- and Electric-type STAB moves from the likes of Tangela and Eelektross is an easy way to put a stop to Octillery's antics, as they can easily OHKO it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>This is, quite simply, Octillery's best set, as Octillery really needs the raw power provided by Choice Specs to break through certain threats. This extra power is especially important for securing the OHKO on Skuntank and Gardevoir after Stealth Rock with Hydro Pump. Hydro Pump is the main move on this set and hits most Pokemon that don't resist it hard. Ice Beam hits Flying- and Dragon-types for good damage while hitting Grass-types accurately. Energy Ball gives important coverage against Seismitoad as well as other Water-types, although Hydro Pump hit many Water-types reasonably hard as well. Fire Blast is on this set to hit important Grass-types such as Ludicolo (it does over 50% damage to Rain Dance variants, which, along with Stealth Rock, is good enough to make sure they don't get a free switch-in).</p> <p>Choice Specs is the only option on the main set for the reasons stated above. Life Orb is definitely a good alternative, though, as while it might miss out on the previously mentioned important KOs, it allows Octillery to switch around moves, therefore making better use of its brilliant coverage. Keep in mind that Life Orb is more hazard-reliant, while Choice Specs is more prediction-reliant. The EVs let Octillery outspeed Alomomola, which it can 2HKO with Energy Ball. Although Sniper is the recommended ability, as the results can be devastating for the opponent if the Octillery user gets lucky, Suction Cups is also a choice on Baton Pass teams where Octillery can make use of Speed boosts from the likes of Ninjask and Special Attack boosts from other Baton Passers. A Life Orb or Expert Belt set is more suited to Baton Pass teams, as is Water Spout, which is a great option here to spam when Octillery is at full health. Pokemon that set up entry hazards, such as Golem and Roselia, make for good partners as well. The two also have the added benefit of being able to switch into Electric-type attacks with impunity, but do note that Golem shares a weakness to Grass with Octillery. Roselia is particularly effective, as it can take down the Grass-types that threaten Octillery with their STAB moves as well. Trick Room is great for Octillery, as it can \"outspeed\" most Pokemon under it and start firing off strong special attacks; for this reason, Duosion and Musharna make for good partners. If Octillery is being used under Trick Room, a Quiet nature along with 0 Speed IVs should be used.</p>"

Many a kid's holidays have been spoiled by these mundane avatars of Kris Kringle in what can only be described as a ritualistic assassination of childhood innocence. Truly, they are a blight upon our cultural landscape, and only when they are washed from our social consciousness can some form of dignity begin to return to Christmas.</p> <p>Everything stated in the above paragraph also applies to Delibird.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Delibird's Special Attack is better than its Attack before the Hustle boost, so a Choice Specs set is conceivable, but if Delibird is not being an ice-cold hustler with its Hustle boost, then there's really no point in having it on your team at all. In a cruel twist of fate, Delibird learns Rapid Spin, giving it the dubious honor of being the worst Rapid Spin user in the game. Delibird's signature move, Present, can be used for some novelty value, but let's face it, using Delibird is in itself already a gift to your opponent.</p> <p>Fool people into thinking Delibird is a pre-evolution of Articuno and sneak it into Little Cup to see if it will do well there (it won't).</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Rock-types, Steel-types, Water-types, and even Fire-types can all switch into Delibird without much fear and threaten to tear through its wafer-thin defenses with their respective STAB attacks. Delibird is incredibly weak to Stealth Rock, so keeping it on the field is guaranteed to spell Delibird's demise; alternatively, kick some pebbles into its face and bid it adieu.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Every day Delibird is hustlin', and this set is no exception. The combination of Choice Band and Hustle allows Delibird's Attack to approach barely usable levels, and then the fun begins. Hustle makes Delibird miss its target more than fellow frosty bird Sarah Palin misses the point, so the never-miss Aerial Ace will be its best friend. Ice Shard bypasses Delibird's mediocre Speed, but if you're feeling particularly foolhardy and confident that Delibird will survive the turn, why not let it fire off an Ice Punch, the stronger STAB option on this set. Focus Punch and Brick Break are there to irritate the Rock- and Steel-types that are the bane of Delibird's existence, but it's just delaying the inevitable conclusion of Delibird being pulverized into a pile of red snow.</p> <p>Much like the average New York gigolo, this Delibird will be coming and going a lot, and unfortunately its typing means that it gets a whopping 50% of its health clipped away by Stealth Rock every time it switches in, so Rapid Spin support is essential. Wartortle is probably the most adequate choice, as it doesn't double up on any weaknesses with Delibird. Spinda also learns Rapid Spin, and could be partnered with Delibird in an effort to psyche out your opponent. If the team looks this bad, then the strategy must be immaculate, right?</p> <p>Seed Bomb could be used in the last slot to bring discomfiture to Water-types that switch in hoping to wall Delibird's icy assaults; keep in mind, however, that Delibird will bomb harder than any seeds ever could. Adamant could be used over Jolly for an additional boost in power, but the idea of running anything but Jolly on this wintertime courier just seems blasphemous.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Stantler is rather mediocre in NU. It is outclassed by Kangaskhan and Tauros, both of which are speedier, are more powerful, and have better abilities. The only thing Stantler has over other Normal-types is its access to the combination of Intimidate and Sucker Punch, which allows it to take a few physical hits and support the team by weakening the opponent, and gives it a decent priority move to defeat faster threats such as Kadabra. However, because this niche is extremely specific, it is generally more beneficial to use other Normal-types instead.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A mixed set with Thunderbolt sounds like a decent option to lure in and defeat Alomomola, but in reality, it is very weak and deals only about 50% to its main target, which can be easily recovered through Regenerator, meaning this lure is useless. Work Up and Calm Mind can be used on mixed sets, but using Work Up usually means that physical walls are more wary of switching in. Substitute can be used to shield Stantler from faster threats, but the recoil from Substitute, Life Orb, and Double-Edge recoil adds up very quickly. Jump Kick is an option to hit Bronzor and Cradily, both of which otherwise wall Stantler. Megahorn can also be used, but it doesn't do a lot of damage to Tangela, and Exeggutor is 2HKOed by Double-Edge anyway. Thunder Wave and Hypnosis are decent supporting options in Stantler's movepool, but Stantler's bulk is a little too low to use these options effectively. Energy Ball is a decent option to defeat Seismitoad, but it doesn't really hit anything else. Stantler has access to dual screens, but apart from its access to Intimidate, this set is rather outclassed by the likes of Serperior, Gardevoir, and Ampharos. Choice Band is a decent option, but it doesn't utilize Sucker Punch effectively and is done better by Kangaskhan. Choice Scarf is not a good option either, as it fails to reach the base 95 Speed benchmark and is terribly outclassed by Tauros.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Misdreavus is one of the best counters to Stantler, as it is immune to Stantler's STAB move and can avoid Sucker Punch by burning it with Will-O-Wisp, crippling it for the rest of the match. Physical walls do a great job at countering Stantler, as it can barely scratch them. Regirock, Alomomola, and Tangela are all examples of physical walls that have no trouble with Stantler. These physical walls can proceed to wear down Stantler with status or a STAB move. Golbat and Weezing are solid checks to Stantler, as they are immune to Toxic and are relatively bulky, but they must remain healthy in order to stomach Double-Edge. Bulky Fighting-types, such as Gurdurr and Throh, take little damage from Stantler's moves and can retaliate with Drain Punch and Circle Throw, respectively. Defensive Carracosta walls Stantler thanks to Solid Rock and can wear it down with repeated Waterfalls. Braviary is a decent Pokemon that discourages Stantler from switching in in the first place, because if it does, Braviary gets a free Attack boost thanks to Defiant. Finally, faster Pokemon, such as Choice Scarf Braviary and Choice Band Primeape, can easily revenge kill Stantler due to its frailty. However, the frailer ones need to beware of being hit by Sucker Punch.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Double-Edge is Stantler's most powerful STAB move and is needed to hit opponents as hard as possible. However, it should be noted that the combination of Double-Edge and Life Orb recoil will kill Stantler very quickly. Sucker Punch allows Stantler to hit faster threats such as Kadabra and Gardevoir, as well as finish off faster threats that are sufficiently weakened. Earthquake is a coverage move for hitting Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon. Finally, Toxic is mostly a filler move, but its utility lies in allowing Stantler to cripple physical walls such as Misdreavus and Alomomola.</p> <p>A Jolly nature allows Stantler to outrun positive-natured base 80 Pokemon, such as Braviary and Gardevoir, as well as Adamant Sawk. However, an Adamant nature is also viable, as it guarantees that Stantler 2HKOes Metang with Earthquake. Intimidate is the chosen ability because it allows Stantler to survive a few weaker hits. It also allows Stantler to act as a pivot against weaker opponents, although it is still extremely frail. Sap Sipper isn't used because it leaves Stantler entirely outclassed by Sawsbuck and it is illegal with Double-Edge and Sucker Punch, which are both very important parts of Stantler's moveset. Double-Edge is the only viable STAB move because Stantler cannot do enough damage with Return; for example, it cannot 2HKO Miltank without Double-Edge. Life Orb helps Stantler nab several important KOs, such as the 2HKO against Metang. Gothorita is an excellent teammate, as it can trap and eliminate physical walls such as Regirock and Alomomola, allowing Stantler to sweep. Skuntank and Liepard are also good teammates for Pursuit trapping opposing defensive Ghost-types, especially Misdreavus, which are troublesome to Stantler. Entry hazard support is also beneficial for Stantler to enable it to grab a few extra KOs. For example, a layer of Spikes is needed to 2HKO physically defensive Seismitoad. Garbodor is a decent Spikes user that also covers up Stantler's weakness to Fighting-type moves, and it is especially useful for dealing with the troublesome Primeape. Roselia is also a decent Spikes user and defeats both Alomomola and Tangela, which are rather troublesome to Stantler. Both of these previously mentioned Spikes users can also set up Toxic Spikes, which helps wear down Alomomola and Tangela. Finally, Seismitoad is also a good partner, as it can set up Stealth Rock and help Stantler defeat Regirock.</p>"

  "Miltank": {
    "overview": "<p>As the fastest Stealth Rock setter in the NU tier, Miltank has a claim to fame as a support Pokemon. With a variety of utility moves such as Heal Bell under its belt, as well as a reliable recovery move in Milk Drink, Miltank can easily cater to your team's needs. Alongside Miltank's decent mixed bulk, it has two effective abilities that aid its defensive prowess in Thick Fat and Sap Sipper. Offensively, Miltank can work as a decent late-game sweeper with a Curse set alongside Scrappy. It's not always easy for Miltank to be effective though, due to the prevalence of Fighting-type Pokemon in the metagame. Miltank has a difficult time getting past Ghost-types, especially Misdreavus, without Scrappy. It also has difficulty fitting coverage moves into its already limited moveslots; Milk Drink is an automatic requirement, which leaves Miltank with only three moveslots. While its Normal typing leaves a lot to be desired, its three abilities all provide unique niches that makes Miltank one of the more unpredictable Pokemon in the NU tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An offensive set with Life Orb and Sap Sipper, possibly even Scrappy, is a viable option for Miltank; the recommended moves would be Double-Edge, Milk Drink, Earthquake, and a choice of Ice Punch, Punishment, or Heal Bell. Just understand that such a set compromises Miltank's good bulk; an additional drawback is that Miltank's power is still mediocre and it requires a boost from Sap Sipper to significantly threaten the opposing team. Hammer Arm and Gyro Ball can be utilized on the Curse set as Speed isn't very relevant on the set, but they are mediocre options for the most part when compared to Miltank's Normal STAB moves. Zen Headbutt is a possible move to hit Fighting-types, but it is difficult to fit onto any of Miltank's sets. Fire Punch and Thunder Punch can be used to hit specific Pokemon for 4x damage, but Return and Double-Edge either match or outdamage, respectively, against all other targets that are hit neutrally. In order to hit Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon, Brick Break and Focus Punch are options but they are generally inferior to Earthquake. Rest and Sleep Talk are options over Milk Drink and Heal Bell on the Curse set, but such a set's unreliability and inability to support its team makes it a less practical option. Finally, Miltank can set up both Sunny Day and Rain Dance for weather sweepers; unfortunately, Miltank's inability to provide a safe switch-in for such teammates, lack of priority on such moves, and lack of benefits from weather moves in general makes it an inferior choice compared to Volbeat, Regirock, Liepard, and even the weather sweepers themselves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Gurdurr is the best counter to Miltank as it can use Bulk Up to overpower Miltank while keeping itself healthy with Drain Punch. Throh can also use Bulk Up to absorb Miltank's attacks and can either threaten it with Storm Throw or Circle Throw. Choice Band Sawk can break through Miltank even after a Curse. Misdreavus walls any Miltank that lacks Scrappy, and threatens Scrappy sets with Will-O-Wisp and Taunt. Other Ghost-types, such as Haunter and Golurk, can check non-Scrappy sets as well; they must be wary of the status ailments Miltank can inflict. Mandibuzz can completely wall Miltank with Taunt, Toxic, and Roost; Whirlwind variants can at least prevent Curse sets from setting up too much. Mandibuzz must be wary of Toxic on the switch or, to a lesser extent, paralysis. Alomomola walls the offensive set if it lacks Heal Bell and doesn't already have several boosts; it also walls the utility set if Miltank lacks Toxic. Miltank doesn't have the greatest special bulk, so powerful special attackers, such as Samurott and Gardevoir, can possibly 2HKO it.</p>",

        "description": "<p>With an assortment of support and utility moves, great overall bulk, reliable recovery, and two abilities that enhance its defensive capabilities, Miltank makes a fabulous support Pokemon. Milk Drink is vital for Miltank's longevity, as it allows Miltank to continuously support your team throughout the battle. Stealth Rock provides excellent support for most teams, and Miltank happens to be one of the fastest users even without Speed investment. The third moveslot decides what kind of utility Miltank will provide for one's team: Heal Bell is invaluable for most teams to remove crippling status afflictions, while Toxic works to wear down defensive Pokemon like Alomomola and Misdreavus to allow teammates to break through them more easily. An offensive move is critical to prevent Miltank from being completely destroyed by Taunt and Substitute users. Body Slam is the preferred move as the paralysis chance allows Miltank to possibly cripple offensive Pokemon more effectively than with Toxic. Return can be used instead if you do not like the paralysis chance clashing with Miltank's ability to Toxic defensive Pokemon.</p> <p>Max HP and Special Defense EV investment and a Careful nature are recommended as Miltank's Special Defense is rather mediocre and it needs all it can get in special bulk to make the most use of its resistances from Thick Fat. Thick Fat is the preferred ability to grant Miltank invaluable resistances to Fire- and Ice-type moves. Factoring in the gradual recovery from Leftovers, Miltank checks Charizard as even a Blaze-boosted Fire Blast from the Choice Specs set cannot 2HKO Miltank; be wary around Charizard regardless, as Focus Blast from just the Choice Scarf set 2HKOes. Sap Sipper can also be used, as Miltank becomes a great pivot into the Grass-types that are rather common, while Charizard is likely to be the only Fire-type you'll commonly face; the Attack boost is also appreciated to give Body Slam and Return more force. Thunder Wave is a good option for the utility slot if Miltank uses Return, but the paralysis chance from Body Slam usually suffices and Toxic is generally the better status to have, as it gives Miltank the ability to threaten both defensive and offensive Pokemon alike. Seismic Toss is an alternative attacking move Miltank can use for consistent damage, though Body Slam's paralysis chance and Return's better power against offensive Pokemon make them more useful overall.</p> <p>Choice Band Golurk is an excellent teammate, being able to break past Rock- and Steel-types and sponge Fighting-type moves for Miltank; in exchange Miltank provides Stealth Rock and paralysis support to give Golurk an easier time breaking down the opposing team. Other Ghost-types, such as Misdreavus and Haunter, can also take on Fighting-types while acting as spinblockers to keep Stealth Rock around. Musharna also provides a valuable defense against Fighting-types, and can provide the utility that Miltank forgoes with either its own Thunder Wave or Heal Bell. Garbodor can also check Fighting-types, and it even provides Spikes and Toxic Spikes support to complement Stealth Rock. For more offensive teammates, Grass-type sweepers, such as Substitute and Calm Mind Serperior and Rain Dance Ludicolo, appreciate Miltank's ability to wear down Charizard, Regice, and special walls so that they can sweep more effectively.</p>"

        "description": "<p>This set makes use of Scrappy to allow Miltank to hit every Pokemon in the tier with its STAB move, which complements a mono-attacking setup sweeper such as Miltank perfectly. Curse is the key to this set, bringing Miltank's physical bulk to impressive levels. The Attack boost is also appreciated, making Body Slam and Return considerably more threatening. Return has more power, but Body Slam is still preferred as the paralysis chance gives Miltank more opportunities to set up; Body Slam is also a decent move to use early-game when Miltank cannot safely set up to fish for paralysis. Miltank will likely have to withstand several attacks in order to set up, so Milk Drink is a requirement to keep it healthy. Heal Bell prevents Miltank from becoming crippled by Toxic and Will-O-Wisp and allows Miltank to support its team despite its focus being primarily on sweeping. Milk Drink and Heal Bell both differentiate Miltank from other bulky setup sweepers, such as Bulk Up Gurdurr, which lacks reliable recovery and Heal Bell, and Bulk Up Braviary, which relies on Substitute to block status.</p> <p>As Curse boosts Miltank's Defense, this set most benefits from investing entirely in HP and Special Defense. A Careful nature complements the special bulk investment, and Leftovers is the preferred item so that Miltank does not have to use Milk Drink as often. Thick Fat is a possible option for this set so that Miltank can set up on Fire- and Ice-type Pokemon, but this set is then walled by Ghost-types. Earthquake is an option over Heal Bell for a more offensive approach, but status becomes crippling for Miltank. This set greatly appreciates Toxic Spikes support from teammates such as Garbodor and Roselia in order to wear down opposing walls and setup sweepers and deter them from staying in. Garbodor is particularly useful in order to check opposing Fighting-types that can break through Miltank even after a Curse.</p> <p>This set is walled by Mandibuzz, which either breaks it down with Taunt and Toxic or simply blows Miltank out of battle with Whirlwind. This means that Pokemon that can defeat Mandibuzz, such as Eelektross, the Rotom formes, special Samurott, or other strong special attacking Pokemon are required teammates. Additional bulky sweepers, such as Calm Mind Musharna and Bulk Up Gurdurr, partner well with this Miltank set as they help wear down each other's counters.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mightyena's movepool is quite scarce, but there are some interesting options in it. Mightyena has access to some decent support moves such as Roar, Yawn, and Torment, but is too frail to use them effectively. Mightyena can also use Dig or Rock Smash to deal with the Steel-types in NU, but they are either easy to avoid or too weak to be viable. Mightyena also has access to Ice Fang, Thunder Fang, Fire Fang, and Return, which at first glance might seem to be good, but Mightyena's STABs are stronger most of the time and it should always be paired with Pokemon able to deal with Steel-types and bulky Pokemon anyway. Finally, Dark Gem could be used over Black Glasses to make the first Sucker Punch stronger, but Mightyena needs Black Glasses to KO some Pokemon after a boost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Mightyena isn't hard to take on due to its poor coverage, low Speed, and general frailty. The most common options to counter Mightyena are Fighting-types such as Gurdurr, Sawk, Throh, and Primeape, which resist its STAB and can easily finish it off with their own STAB attacks. Another way to stop Mightyena is by the use of faster priority users such as Kangaskhan, Swellow, Zangoose, and Floatzel, as they won't get hit by Sucker Punch, but keep in mind that Mightyena can predict this and strike back with a strong Crunch. Faster Pokemon with Substitute are also a problem as they can easily avoid Sucker Punch, allowing them to strike back next turn without fear. Steel-types such as Probopass, Metang, and Bastiodon are the bane of Mightyena's existence, taking nothing from its STAB attacks with their amazing bulk and typing. Bulky Pokemon such as Piloswine, Golem, Torterra, and Tangela can also easily take a hit from Mightyena and strike back. Finally, Mightyena can't take neutral hits either due to its frailty, easily getting 2HKO by most Pokemon in the tier.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This set is pretty much the best Mightyena can pull off in NU. Sucker Punch is mandatory, allowing Mightyena to overcome its middling Speed and to have a chance against faster opponents, which can make it quite scary after some Moxie boosts. Crunch is a more reliable STAB, mostly used against slower Pokemon or a faster opponent trying to set up on Mightyena or status it. Substitute is here so Mightyena can avoid status moves from slower Pokemon or by forcing out Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Musharna, Misdreavus, Gardevoir, and Jynx. Finally, Taunt or Toxic can be used in the fourth moveslot. Taunt helps to prevent entry hazards and phazing moves, while Toxic helps Mightyena a lot against walls it can't do much against, such as Regirock and Alomomola.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is chosen over Jolly because Mightyena needs the extra power due to its low offenses, but Jolly allows Mightyena to outspeed faster Ghost- and Psychic-type such as Adamant or Modest Drifblim and Modest Gardevoir. Black Glasses is the preferred item as it gives Mightyena the power to guarantee a 2HKO against Musharna after Stealth Rock and to OHKO against Muk after two boost and Stealth Rock. Lum Berry also has some good uses, as it helps Mightyena against Jynx and lets it switch in on status moves from Pokemon such as Musharna and Misdreavus. Howl can also be used over Taunt or Toxic, allowing Mightyena to get a boost behind a Substitute or from a forced switch and OHKO Pokemon such as Roselia and Misdreavus, but Taunt and Toxic's support from Mightyena is more useful most of the time. Life Orb can also be used over Black Glasses or Lum Berry, as it gives Mightyena more power, but Mightyena will faint quickly with the Life Orb recoil and Substitute.</p> <p>Since Mightyena can remove Psychic- and Ghost-types, Fighting-types such as Gurdurr, Sawk, and Primeape are all great partners to it, as they can easily KO Steel-types and wear down bulkier Pokemon so Mightyena can pick them off later in the game. Garbodor pairs well with Mightyena, as it can take any Bug- or Fighting-type move for Mightyena and set up entry hazards to wear down physical walls for it, while Mightyena can take on Psychic-types for Garbodor. Golurk is also an amazing partner for Mightyena as Golurk is immune to Fighting-type moves, able to take on the Steel-types that wall Mightyena with its STAB Earthquake, and can set up Stealth Rock to support the team. Meanwhile, Mightyena can deal with the Ghost-types that force Golurk out.</p>"

  "Linoone": {
    "overview": "<p>Linoone is a fairly predictable Pokemon, as the Belly Drum and Extreme Speed combo remains pretty much the only reason to use it. However, while this does make Linoone somewhat risky to use, it is still extremely hard to stop once it has set up. Even with Linoone's measly base 70 Attack, Extreme Speed OHKOes nearly every Pokemon in NU that does not resist it after a Belly Drum. Unfortunately, Belly Drum is very hard to pull off because of Linoone's lackluster defenses, and there are many Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types that can stop a Linoone sweep in its tracks even after it has set up. As such, Linoone requires much team support to pull off a sweep, whether it is trapping, dual screens support, or the use of a slow Volt Switch or U-turn.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Despite Linoone's rather large movepool, only a small portion of it is usable, let alone viable. Choice Band Linoone has instant power with STAB Extreme Speed and doesn't need to go through the hassle of setting up, but it is still admittedly weak as a base 70 Attack Pokemon. Trick or Switcheroo can be used alongside Choice Band in order to cripple defensive Pokemon as well. Gluttony and Salac Berry can be used over Pickup for specific situations where Linoone needs to outspeed Pokemon without using Extreme Speed, such as against Choice Scarf Haunter. Rock Smash can be used on the Belly Drum set to deal more damage to Bastiodon, but it fails to OHKO it because Rock Smash is inherently weak. Dig can also be used to hit Steel-types such as Metang and Klang harder, but the opponent can simply switch out and play around Dig accordingly.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Although Linoone lacks many checks and counters once Belly Drum is set up, defensive Steel-types can still generally handle it. Metang can withstand all of Linoone's attacks and respond with a Meteor Mash, while Bastiodon is able to Roar Linoone away while also being able to tank a +6 Seed Bomb. Probopass can manage to last a hit as well and can retaliate by either paralyzing it or attacking with Power Gem.</p> <p>Pokemon with the Sturdy ability such as Golem, Gigalith, and Carracosta can survive any hit and pick off Linoone in return, but they must be able to switch in at 100% health in order to do so. Ghost-types can beat Linoone if it does not carry Shadow Claw, and Haunter in particular can outspeed the standard Linoone set. Choice Scarf Haunter can outspeed Linoone even if it opts to run a faster spread and acts as a solid check. Lastly, Tangela and Regirock can both withstand Linoone's attacks if they are healthy enough, and can retaliate with Giga Drain and Drain Punch respectively while restoring health in the process.</p>",

      "Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<p>Once the opponent's team is clear of imminent threats, Linoone is able to plow through it after a Belly Drum with a STAB-boosted Extreme Speed. At +2 priority, Extreme Speed allows Linoone to avoid being revenge killed by conventional methods such as Mach Punch and Sucker Punch. Shadow Claw and Seed Bomb provide Linoone the extra coverage it needs to damage Pokemon that would otherwise be able to tank or wall hits from it. Shadow Claw in particular allows Linoone to OHKO common Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Haunter, although both of them are able to outspeed Linoone with Speed investment. Seed Bomb is useful for Pokemon such as Alomomola, Carracosta, Piloswine, Seismitoad, and Golurk that would otherwise be able to survive an Extreme Speed. Return is also an option to consider over Shadow Claw if one wishes to damage Psychic-types such as Musharna and Exeggutor a bit more or if one prefers to have a stronger STAB move to use against slower Pokemon, but it makes Linoone even more susceptible to Ghost-types.</p> <p>Silk Scarf gives Linoone an extra boost in power that makes Extreme Speed even more devastating after Belly Drum, and can also be used in tandem with Return over Shadow Claw. Otherwise, Sitrus Berry is the preferred option as it allows Linoone more freedom in setting up Belly Drum and can save Linoone when the extra health is necessary to prevent a revenge kill.</p> <p>With Extreme Speed being Linoone's main form of offense, the given EV spread focuses on Linoone's bulk and power to ensure the best opportunity to set up and sweep after Belly Drum. Even without Speed investment, Linoone is still able to outspeed utility Misdreavus and OHKO with Shadow Claw. However, if one wishes to outspeed Haunter and other base 95 Pokemon, then an alternative EV spread of 40 HP / 252 Atk / 216 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used, although this is noticeably less bulky and powerful. Substitute can be considered over Shadow Claw and Return if one wishes to ease prediction when setting up Belly Drum, but the lost coverage hampers Linoone's ability to run through teams freely. Additionally, Substitute is a bit difficult to set up as opponents will usually attack in desperation rather than switch when dealing with Linoone.</p> <p>Setting up Belly Drum is difficult; as such, it is essential that Linoone has teammates focused around giving it opportunities to set up with little consequence. Dual screens users such as Gardevoir partner well with Linoone as the increased defenses allow for Linoone to avoid being KOed while setting up Belly Drum. Additionally, Gardevoir in particular can use Memento in tandem with dual screens to weaken enemy attacks even further, all while giving Linoone a free switch-in opportunity. Eelektross and Ampharos can utilize a slow Volt Switch in order to give Linoone a free switch-in opportunity as well. Pokemon that are able to absorb Toxic Spikes such as Garbodor and Skuntank are important to have in order to ensure that Linoone cannot be stalled out. Garbodor can also provide Spikes support while Skuntank can trap Ghost-type Pokemon with Pursuit, which are important to eliminate when using Linoone. Lastly, Pokemon that can eliminate Rock- and Steel-types such as Golurk, Sawk, Primeape, and Seismitoad are useful in clearing the way for a Linoone sweep.</p>"

  "Ludicolo": {
    "overview": "<p>Ludicolo is both a dangerous rain sweeper and a great special wall in NU. When given a single chance to switch in and a single turn to set up, it can shred entire teams to pieces within seconds. Its unique Water / Grass typing only benefits it, giving it excellent coverage, as well as handy resistances, with just its STABs alone. It also has an impressive Special Defense to work with, letting it take a more supportive role if needed. In addition, Ludicolo does not require excessive team support to function, having every tool it needs to sweep or wall right under its belt. Not all is well, though; for  Ludicolo is heavily dependent on setting up Rain Dance, as it just isn't fast or strong enough without the rain up. This means that it is incredibly vulnerable on turns it attempts to set up, something that must be kept in mind when using it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Due to Ludicolo's expansive physical movepool, a Swords Dance set can come as a big surprise to many special walls, but it's generally inferior to the Rain Dance set. Ludicolo can use Sunny Day to take advantage of Solar Beam and Synthesis, but it is a far better sweeper in rain due to Swift Swim. Focus Blast can be used to hit Normal-types hard, but it is not necessary as Hydro Pump in the rain hits even harder (save for the rare Cloud Nine Lickilicky). Substitute is a viable option to block status and ease prediction, but Ludicolo does not have the room for it. Finally, Damp Rock can be used on the Rain Dance set to extend rain turns, but the extra power from Life Orb is far more important.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ironically, bulky Ludicolo is actually a great counter to offensive variants, as bulky Ludicolo can easily stall the latter out of rain turns. Aside from that, Mantine is an excellent counter as it is immune to Hydro Pump, can comfortably tank Giga Drain and Ice Beam with its titanic Special Defense, and can 2HKO with Air Slash. Roselia counters Ludicolo fairly well, and can KO a slightly weakened one with Sludge Bomb, but it cannot safely switch directly into Ice Beam after a little hazard damage. Specially defensive Braviary can tank even a rain-boosted Hydro Pump at full health and OHKO with Brave Bird. Fast Choice Scarf users, such as Zebstrika, Charizard, and Tauros, can revenge kill Ludicolo even in the rain, but none can do it without prior damage. Priority can also revenge a weakened Ludicolo, examples being Kangaskhan's Fake Out + Sucker Punch combination and Gurdurr's Mach Punch. Toxic Spikes are also very effective at wearing down Ludicolo, limiting its sweeping and walling capabilities. However, the best way to keep Ludicolo in check is to prevent it from setting up rain, as this leaves it much slower and easier to deal with.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rain Dance": {
        "description": "<p>This is Ludicolo's signature sweeping set. Rain Dance turns Ludicolo into an offensive terror, doubling its Speed and giving its Water-type STAB an enormous power boost in a single turn. Hydro Pump is Ludicolo's Water-type STAB of choice, hitting like a truck with its high Base Power and boost from rain. Giga Drain is Ludicolo's best Grass-type STAB, punishing bulky Water-types and healing it in the process. Finally, Ice Beam provides much needed coverage against Grass- and Dragon-types, and attains near perfect neutral coverage with Ludicolo's STABs.</p> <p>A Modest nature is preferred, as it lets Ludicolo break down most special walls, most notably Lickilicky. Timid can be used to let Ludicolo outspeed everything up to Timid Choice Scarf Electabuzz in the rain, but this is somewhat situational and Ludicolo generally needs the extra power more. Surf is an alternative to Hydro Pump if accuracy is a problem, but Ludicolo loses out on the ability to break through special walls such as Lickilicky. Entry hazards work well with Ludicolo, allowing it to net several KOs against certain Pokemon; for example, Alomomola is OHKOed by Giga Drain after Stealth Rock, and Roselia is 2HKOed by Ice Beam after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. Offensive Seismitoad is a good partner, as it can set up Stealth Rock and forms a powerful offensive core with Ludicolo. Spikes users such as Garbodor and Roselia also pair well with Ludicolo—not only do they set up entry hazards, but they absorb Toxic Spikes, which are a massive pain for Ludicolo. Ludicolo performs quite well on dedicated rain teams; not only can its teammates set up rain for it, but it can also provide Rain Dance support of its own. On that note, Rain Dance Rotom-S is a good partner for summoning rain as it beats Mantine and Roselia, two Pokemon Ludicolo tends to struggle against. In return, Ludicolo can make quick work of Ground-types that give Rotom-S trouble. Volbeat is another good partner, possessing Prankster Rain Dance to nearly ensure rain is set up and a relatively slow U-turn to make sure Ludicolo gets in safely.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>This set focuses more on Ludicolo's defensive capabilities, namely its good special bulk and typing, to become one of the best counters to various special attackers in the tier around. Courtesy of its unique defensive typing, Ludicolo can take on threats such as Gorebyss, Samurott lacking Megahorn, Seismitoad, and opposing Ludicolo with ease. It also manages to check Eelektross and Rotom-F. Scald is a relatively strong Water-type STAB that can inflict a potential burn, which is great for patching up Ludicolo's mediocre Defense. Giga Drain is a reliable Grass-type STAB that also heals Ludicolo in the process and hits many top threats like Samurott, Seismitoad, and Gorebyss hard. Synthesis is Ludicolo's most reliable form of recovery, and works great for stalling out special attackers. Finally, Leech Seed slowly drains the opponent's health and works well in tandem with Giga Drain and Synthesis. This Ludicolo works best on stall and balanced teams looking for a good rain counter, but it's a fairly niche Pokemon and can't just fit onto any team. This is largely due to the offensive nature of most teams in NU, as this set can really slow down momentum.</p> <p>The EV spread allows Ludicolo to outspeed maximum Speed Golem and KO with Scald or Giga Drain after Sturdy is broken. The rest of them focus on its Special Defense. Ludicolo can opt to run maximum Special Defense, but this doesn't really accomplish anything in the long run. Likewise, more Speed EVs can be used, but this detracts from Ludicolo's walling capabilities.</p> <p>Ludicolo has a few additional moves it can utilize, including Toxic, Ice Beam, and Protect. Like Leech Seed, Toxic can also be useful in gradually wearing down the opponent; unlike Leech Seed, however, it can target some Grass-types. In a similar vein, Ice Beam provides coverage against said Grass-types, as well as Dragon-types, both of which would otherwise turn Ludicolo into setup fodder. Finally, Protect allows Ludicolo to scout for the opponent's next move and gain extra Leftovers recovery. Because this set forces a lot of switches, entry hazards are recommended to take advantage of that. Ground-types make good choices to set up Stealth Rock, as they share good type synergy with Ludicolo. Spikes users such as Garbodor have good synergy with Ludicolo as well. Garbodor can also provide Toxic Spikes support, which works fantastically with Ludicolo's ability to stall. Finally, an Electric-type, such as Eelektross or Zebstrika, makes for a good partner to beat Mantine and Swanna, two Water-types that Ludicolo loses to.</p>"

Double-Edge is a slightly more powerful STAB attack than Return, but the recoil is annoying for Vigoroth. Sucker Punch lets Vigoroth hit Ghost-types but many of said Ghost-types have access to Will-O-Wisp, making it rather ineffective.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Magic Coat Bastiodon, while uncommon, is the best counter to Vigoroth as it can reflect back a Taunt and proceed to cripple Vigoroth with Toxic. Haunter doesn't take anything from either set, can use Disable to prevent Vigoroth from recovering, and proceeds to whittle it down with a STAB Sludge Bomb. Drifblim outspeeds Vigoroth, can use Will-O-Wisp to cripple it, and hits it hard with Flying Gem-boosted STAB Acrobatics. Misdreavus and Golurk hard wall the Bulk Up set due to their Ghost typing, but lose to the stallbreaker set and can't do much back in return. Throh and Gurdurr are boosting sweepers that can hit Vigoroth hard due to their super effective Fighting STAB. Choice Band Sawk and Primeape can revenge kill Vigoroth with Close Combat even after it has used Bulk Up once. Musharna can switch in on a Toxic and pass it onto Vigoroth due to Synchronize; it can later cleanse itself of status by using Heal Bell. Faster Toxic users such as Mandibuzz, SubToxic Seismitoad, and Pokemon such as Kangaskhan and Tauros that run it to cripple physical walls can make Vigoroth a lot easier to deal with and only fear boosted Returns or a Taunt on the switch.

    "overview": "<p>With an Attack stat higher than that of Groudon, Zekrom, and Rayquaza, a respectable Speed tier, and a beefy base 150 HP stat, combined with great coverage moves such as Earthquake and Night Slash, Slaking looks like a top-tier Uber threat. That is, until you spot its ability, Truant, probably the single worst ability in the entire game. Because of Truant, Slaking becomes huge setup fodder for dangerous sweepers. It also keeps Slaking from having any way of sweeping the opposing team, even late-game. With such a letdown of an ability, Slaking is rather challenging to use. That said, it can and often will KO at least one of the opponent's team members if it gets a free switch in.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Slaking really does not have many other notable items or moves it can utilize. However, Slaking does have three alternative STAB options: Double-Edge, Body Slam, and Giga Impact. Double-Edge is very similar to Return but has higher Base Power, and because Slaking has such a huge HP stat, it usually will not take large amounts of recoil damage. However, Double-Edge is illegal with Night Slash and will force you to run Shadow Claw, an inferior coverage option, instead. Body Slam is nice for extra utility alongside Pursuit, as it comes with a 30% chance to paralyze the opponent. Unfortunately, Slaking only gets to attack every other turn, which means it needs to make the most out of every turn it gets to attack with more powerful moves. Giga Impact might seem to fit perfectly with Slaking's ability and item, but it forces Slaking to stay in after attacking and should therefore almost never be used.</p> <p>For coverage moves, Sucker Punch is a neat option, but it is also a risky one, especially when playing around potential Substitutes or setup moves, as it makes Slaking even easier to set up on. Other than that, Slaking has many coverage moves that it could utilize; Fire Punch, Ice Punch, and Low Kick are all options, but Slaking's main coverage moves will usually do the job much better. Slaking also has a decent Special Attack stat, so it can use special attacks to help break through tough physical walls; most notably, Thunderbolt and Fire Blast help it get past Alomomola and Tangela, respectively. Encore could be an option to deal with slower setup sweepers, such as Swords Dance Pinsir, but Slaking should usually use its turns to attack the opponent. When it comes to different sets, the only real other one that might work would be a set with Bulk Up and Slack Off, but due to Slaking's poor Special Defense stat and an ability that makes it hard to stay in even two turns, it is almost impossible to pull off successfully.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The single best way to deal with Slaking is Protect. If you have a Pokemon with Protect against a Slaking, it is impossible for it to hit you at all. Guts Pokemon, such as Swellow and Ursaring, can freely take advantage of Slaking's presence to activate their Status Orbs during Slaking's Truant turn. Additionally, Tangela and Alomomola are very bulky on the physical side and can easily avoid the OHKO from any of Slaking's moves. They can then put it to sleep or stall it with Toxic and Protect. Rock- and Steel-types such as Golem and Metang can easily take any STAB move but should be afraid of Earthquake. Similarly, Misdreavus is immune to Slaking's STAB moves and Earthquake, but Night Slash threatens it.</p> <p>A different way of playing effectively around a Slaking is simply sacrificing an expendable Pokemon. After doing so, you receive a free turn that you can easily use to your advantage to set up for a sweep or place Stealth Rock. Be aware of Slaking's partners though, as the user should and often will be prepared for dangerous setup sweepers.</p>",

Thanks to its powerful STAB move alongside its coverage moves, there are not many Pokemon in NU that appreciate taking a hit from a Choice Banded Slaking, and with Pursuit, it can even outspeed and checkmate Jynx and Haunter.</p> <p>Return is the STAB move of choice, as it has good Base Power with no drawbacks. Earthquake is the main coverage move, as it hits Rock- and Steel-types, which resist Return, for super effective damage. Night Slash rounds off the simple, yet effective coverage. Without Night Slash, Ghost-types such as Misdreavus, Haunter, and Golurk would be able to switch into Slaking much more safely. When it comes to choosing a move for the last spot, Pursuit is the preferred option, even though Retaliate might be more effective for Slaking's hit-and-run strategy. With Pursuit, Slaking can take out fleeing Psychic- and Ghost-types, most notably Jynx and Haunter, which can only outspeed Slaking when using a Choice Scarf. However, Retaliate is great for revenge killing, as very few Pokemon can switch into a boosted Retaliate and live to tell the tale.</p> <p>Using a Jolly nature is important to outpace common NU Pokemon such as Jynx, Kangaskhan, and Haunter. An alternative to Choice Band would be Choice Scarf, as it can deal with Choice Scarf variants of said Pokemon, as well as outpacing faster Pokemon such as Scolipede and Serperior.</p> <p>Considering how easy it is to set up on an immobilized Slaking, it is important to carry counters to common NU setup sweepers, as they could otherwise easily sweep a team after a free turn. Choice Scarf Jynx and Rotom-S are great teammates for Slaking, as they can deal with Carracosta, Scolipede, and Gorebyss, even after said Pokemon have used their setup moves. Liepard is another solid choice, as it can switch in on a predicted Substitute or stat-boosting move and force the opponent to switch with its Prankster Encore. Musharna and Misdreavus have good defensive synergy with Slaking, and they can switch into Fighting-type moves that threaten it. Offensive and defensive pivots, such as Eelektross and Musharna, are also great to build up momentum and potentially give Slaking a free switch-in to dish out huge amounts of damage.</p>"

  "Ninjask": {
    "overview": "<p>Ninjask has a successful niche of utilizing Baton Pass; the secret lies in Ninjask's ability, Speed Boost, which raises its Speed every turn, and when this is Baton Passed to a teammate in succession, it can pull off a threatening sweep. Holding the title of the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the tier, Ninjask fits perfectly onto dedicated Baton Pass teams as a Pokemon that can rack up Speed boosts with Protect and Substitute easily. While its frailness and 4x weakness to Stealth Rock prevent Ninjask from staying on the field for very long, it will always be a coveted member of a team in need of speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An offensive set with a Life Orb or Choice Band is plausible, as it allows Ninjask to make use of its decent base 90 Attack and access to coverage moves. However, it's too frail to reign successful and it's not strong enough to KO opposing Pokemon. Hone Claws can be used in place of Swords Dance, trading power for accuracy. A gimmicky strategy with Final Gambit can be used to defeat weakened Pokemon when Ninjask is at full HP; however, it doesn't have the desired HP to fully utilize it correctly, and its talents are being wasted with such a set. Flash is a gimmicky option as well, but it gives Ninjask many chances to set up if it's used correctly. Ninjask has many great special attacks, such as Bug Buzz, Solar Beam, Silver Wind, and Shadow Ball, but only a mediocre base 50 Special Attack to effectively use them. Other moves such as Sunny Day can be used to support, but there are poor choices, as Ninjask's frailness puts a limit on how long it can stay on the field. Finally, while Mental Herb is not a very useful item in most cases, it can stop Taunt from hindering Ninjask once, although that matters more on Baton Pass teams than anything else. Overall, Ninjask has many options other than its standard set, but the majority of them are lackluster.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Stealth Rock is a huge weakness to Ninjask, so Pokemon that can set it up are very useful in defeating Ninjask. Rock-type Pokemon, such as Golem, Regirock, and Gigalith, are your best bet in OHKOing Ninjask. Rock Blast can work wonders against Ninjask, as it can break through its Substitute and the occasional Focus Sash. Phazing Ninjask out after Stealth Rock is in place is a great way to not only weaken it but prevent or remove any boosts it have attained. Eelektross is a great example of a Pokemon that can phaze Ninjask with ease. Pokemon with priority moves, such as Choice Band Floatzel, can stop Ninjask before it can use Baton Pass or set up Substitute. Taunt is another way to silence Ninjask and break a Baton Pass chain; a Pokemon with Prankster is the best option in this department, as Ninjask will easily outspeed everything else. Murkrow is a good candidate for such a task. Haze and Clear Smog can basically renders Ninjask useless. With correct prediction, Encore is also able to do this to a lesser extent, so Pokemon that wield one of the aforementioned moves, such as Torkoal, Wartortle, and Liepard, work well against it. While stopping Ninjask from using Baton Pass can be difficult if you are unprepared, if you have a offensively strong Pokemon or Stealth Rock, you won't have many issues against it. It's is more important to handle the Baton Pass recipient rather than Ninjask itself; Ninjask isn't too threatening on its own.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Baton Pass": {
        "description": "<p>Ninjask's full potential as a Baton Pass user is displayed in this set; its main goal is to successfully rack up boosts with its ability, Speed Boost, and pass them to a teammate. It is capable of coming out in any part of the match, but it is most common early-game due to its vulnerability to entry hazards. While its poor defenses might give the impression that Ninjask is easy to defeat, it can be very annoying to get rid of if you aren't prepared for it.</p> <p>Baton Pass is the centerpoint of this set, as it allows Ninjask to pass all of its accumulated Speed boosts to a teammate. Substitute is very useful in avoiding status conditions while collecting Speed boosts and Leftovers recovery. Protect is also a vital move on this set, as it usually can earn Ninjask a free Speed boost from the get-go and scout the opponent's attacks. Swords Dance can be used to get an Attack boost to pass to a teammate, and while it is difficult to achieve due to Ninjask's frailness, it can be very dangerous when paired with Speed Boost. However, X-Scissor grants Ninjask a STAB move and prevents it from being complete Taunt bait or offensively useless.</p> <p>Speed Boost is mandatory on this set; it, along with Baton Pass, is what makes Ninjask worth using. Leftovers allow Ninjask to create more Substitutes and switch in more often, as well as working well in conjunction with Protect. 248 HP EVs allow Ninjask to switch in on Stealth Rock twice without fainting, 36 Speed EVs allow Ninjask to outspeed Jolly Swellow, and the remaining Defense EVs with an Impish nature gives Ninjask enough physical bulk to tank Fighting-type attacks, such as a Choice Band Sawk's Close Combat. However, the defensive EVs can be traded for Special Defense with a Careful nature to survive weak special attacks from Tangela, Wartortle, and Scald Alomomola. It can also be traded for Attack with an Adamant nature to KO Psychic-types with X-Scissor. The second choice isn't recommended, as Ninjask can easily be KOed by Pokemon it cannot outright OHKO, so investing in its defenses is the superior option. Focus Sash is an option to nearly guaranteed a Speed or Attack boost by surviving a potential OHKO. However, with Stealth Rock being so common, the Focus Sash can easily be broken before Ninjask can make use of it, making Leftovers the best option. U-turn can be used in the fourth moveslot; if Ninjask is hit by Taunt, it would have to resort to either switching out or using X-Scissor, losing momentum in the process. U-turn can be used to ensure momentum is not lost, though it's a very situational option. Roost allows Ninjask to get more opportunities to set up if it's been weakened. However, Ninjask doesn't get chances to fully utilize Roost.</p> <p>Pokemon that benefit from the Speed boost Ninjask can pass, such as Golurk, Rampardos, Ursaring, Samurott, Exeggutor, and Gorebyss, are good allies. Pokemon that benefit from the occasional Attack boost from Swords Dance are also good teammates to use alongside Ninjask. Rapid Spin support is recommended if you want Ninjask to stay useful in the match. Wartortle is a great choice, as it can tank many attacks for Ninjask thanks to Eviolite. Armaldo is a good choice as well, as it benefits from the Speed boost Ninjask provides. Other Pokemon that can use Baton Pass, such as Mr. Mime, Gorebyss, and Mawile, work well with Ninjask on a dedicated Baton Pass team, as they can pass their boosts to each other. Gorebyss and Mawile can pass defensive boosts to Ninjask, allowing it to last longer. Mr. Mime can pass Barrier to raise its Defense as well.</p>"

  "Shedinja": {
    "overview": "<p>Shedinja is a very risky Pokemon to use in NU. While its niche in Wonder Guard lets it wall several dangerous Pokemon, such as Samurott, Jynx, and Ludicolo, it requires a lot of support, as Shedinja easily falls to all forms of residual damage. Rapid Spin and Magic Bounce support is essential when using it; however, this limits the Pokemon usable with Shedinja to only a few choices. On a properly supported team, however, Shedinja can function as an effective pivot, switching into moves and using Baton Pass for momentum and can even take advantage of Wonder Guard to easily set up Swords Dance and attempt a sweep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shedinja's movepool is small, so do not expect to find many viable options here. Toxic is a decent option that gives Shedinja the ability to hurt Fire-types, which Will-O-Wisp cannot do. Dig can be used to break down Steel-types that wall it, but that also means giving Flying-types a free switch, which Shedinja does not appreciate. Hone Claws and Baton Pass can be used to pass boosts to its teammates, which makes use of its immunities to find set-up opportunities, although it's outclassed in this regard by Ninjask, who has better boosts to pass. Night Slash can be used to gain coverage on Fire-, Normal-, and Ghost-types all at once, but it is inferior to Shadow Claw due to the lack of STAB. Sunny Day can be used to negate sandstorm and hail damage, but these are so rare that it's not worth the moveslot to get rid of them. Shedinja can, however, become a decent pivot for sun teams. A Choice Band set can be used, but given that it no longer has the insurance granted by Focus Sash or Lum Berry, it becomes much riskier. Air Balloon can be used to avoid Spikes, but it is extremely gimmicky and has no use otherwise. Confuse Ray or Swagger can be used, but they add to the risk factor. Grudge can be used to discourage Choiced attackers from attacking, but Shedinja's low Speed means it is difficult to pull off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Any entry hazard will kill Shedinja immediately, so your best bet is to keep them on the field. Fire-types are great checks to Shedinja, as they are immune to burn and can force it out. Most walls with a status move can switch in and kill it with status, as they often have enough bulk to stay in after Shedinja's Lum Berry has been consumed. Alomomola, Lickilicky, and Tangela can do this easily. Skuntank takes little damage from most of Shedinja's moves and can use Pursuit to defeat it immediately, but it must be wary of Will-O-Wisp. Certain Pokemon with Guts, such as Ursaring and Swellow, are completely immune to Shadow Sneak and do not mind getting burned. Garbodor has the defenses to wall Shedinja and can either KO it through Rocky Helmet recoil, Toxic, or Rock Blast or set up Spikes that would prevent Shedinja from switching in again. Steel-types completely wall Shedinja and often have a move to counter it; Probopass can use Power Gem while Bastiodon can set up Stealth Rock and phaze it out. Golem and Armaldo with Rock Blast can OHKO Shedinja through its Focus Sash, although they don't appreciate burns. Mold Breaker Sawk and Pinsir can bypass Wonder Guard but dislike getting burned. In general, anything carrying a super effective move or damaging status can counter Shedinja due to its low Speed.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>This set can switch in on offensive threats that do not have a way to hit it and gain switching momentum with Baton Pass. It can also bring in frail teammates safely thanks to its low Speed. Will-O-Wisp helps cripple many physical attackers that try to force Shedinja out. It is also Shedinja's only way to hit Pokemon that are immune to Shadow Sneak. Protect helps Shedinja scout for unexpected moves, such as a super effective Hidden Power. Finally, Shadow Sneak allows Shedinja to pick off weakened foes and prevents it from becoming Taunt bait. In addition, it can OHKO Jynx after entry hazard damage.</p> <p>The item choice focuses on giving Shedinja a second chance against mispredictions. Focus Sash allows it to live any one hit, while Lum Berry allows it to heal itself from burn or poison. Lum Berry also allows Shedinja to become one of the best Jynx counters in the tier, as it no longer fears Lovely Kiss. Minimum Speed IVs and a Speed hindering nature allows Shedinja to almost always use Baton Pass last, preventing the opponent from predicting and hitting the incoming teammate. Sucker Punch can be used for a more powerful form of priority, but it is very risky against status users.</p> <p>Shedinja absolutely needs Rapid Spin support, as without it, Shedinja cannot even enter the battlefield. Wartortle makes a good partner, as it is NU's most reliable Rapid Spin user and has good matchups against the Fire-, Flying-, and Rock-type Pokemon that can beat Shedinja. Natu is also a great partner thanks to its ability to bounce back entry hazards. Entry hazard support is also useful thanks to Shedinja's ability to force switches. Garbodor is bulky enough to take hits, doesn't stack weaknesses, and can provide Spikes support. Bastiodon and Probopass resist all of Shedinja's weaknesses bar Fire, have Magic Coat to prevent opposing entry hazards, and can reliably set up Stealth Rock. Golem and Seismitoad resist some of Shedinja's weaknesses and can reliably set up Stealth Rock as well. Sawk and Gurdurr can come in on and defeat the Dark-types that threaten Shedinja. It is generally a good idea to have teammates that resist Shedinja's weaknesses, as they will often be targeted at it, thus granting switch-in opportunities.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Shedinja's decent Attack stat, making use of its numerous switch-in opportunities to set up Swords Dance. It is capable of dishing out major damage should it set up, and in tandem with priority Shadow Sneak, it easily cleans up late-game. However, do note that Shedinja would get forced out often thanks to its inability to take hits. Shadow Sneak is Shedinja's priority move, mitigating its low Speed by allowing it to hit first. Shadow Claw is an alternative to hit harder, but the lack of priority makes it inferior, and because this set is supposed to clean up a weakened team, power isn't necessary. X-Scissor is Shedinja's most powerful move, and it grants Shedinja coverage against Normal- and Dark-type Pokemon. Protect helps scout for unexpected moves and preserves Shedinja's life. Will-O-Wisp is an alternative to help cripple physical attackers on the opposing team and lets it avoid Sucker Punch.</p> <p>The item choice is one between insurance against either attacks or status. Both give Shedinja the opportunity to 2HKO opposing Pokemon. Shedinja absolutely needs entry hazards to be off the field to get its job done. Hence, Rapid Spin users are compulsory teammates. Wartortle is the most reliable spinner and shares decent synergy with Shedinja. However, Shell Smash Torkoal is a superior option if an offensive spinner is needed. Natu is also a good teammate, as it can prevent entry hazards from landing on your side with Magic Bounce. This set also appreciates the presence of entry hazards on the opposing side of the field in order to help it grab the KOs it needs. Garbodor does not stack weaknesses with Shedinja and can provide Spikes. Bastiodon, Seismitoad, and Golem also share decent synergy with Shedinja and can set up Stealth Rock.</p>"

  "Lairon": {
    "overview": "<p>Lairon has access to the combination of Head Smash and Rock Head, allowing it to use a very powerful attack without drawbacks. In addition, it has a very high physical bulk bolstered further by Eviolite, along with several useful resistances including Normal, Flying, and Psychic. Unfortunately, Lairon also has weaknesses to the common Fighting-, Ground-, and Water-type attacks, and a lack of recovery, including Leftovers, limits Lairon's staying power severely. It also lacks the special bulk to survive special attacks from the likes of Charizard; while these flaws do give it a lot of competition from Probopass, which doesn't have many of these problems, Lairon's higher offensive presence can make it more useful in some scenarios.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lairon has a few means of setup, including Curse, Hone Claws, and Autotomize, but these are all hard to set up due to Lairon's low Speed and common weaknesses. Lairon's access to Sturdy can create several strategies to utilize Lairon as a lead, such as Cutsap + Endeavor or Metal Burst, but doing either means Lairon is incapable of taking advantage of Head Smash before it goes down, and Golem is usually better as a lead due to access to Explosion and a Ground STAB. A Choice Band can work with the fact that Lairon rarely uses anything other than Head Smash, making it hit even harder, but its Speed and bulk are not high enough to get the full benefit of this. Magnet Rise gives it a temporary immunity to Ground attacks, but Lairon is slow enough to the point that it will likely get hit before it uses the move. Superpower hits Normal-types hard, but most of them are hit around as hard as Head Smash and other targets of Superpower are general dealt with by Earthquake. Likewise, Double-Edge is a strong, recoil-less move Lairon can use, but it doesn't offer any additional coverage. Finally, Protect can be used to scout, but a major problem is that, other than the lack of space, Lairon cannot even get a turn of passive recovery as it uses an Eviolite.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ground-types such as Golurk, Seismitoad, Golem, and Marowak make the best ways to check Lairon as they can take a Head Smash, outspeed Lairon, and OHKO with Earthquake. While Water-types such as Samurott and Simipour cannot switch in as easily due to Head Smash, they can easily OHKO Lairon as long as they use a special Water-type move (note that Lairon isn't even 2HKOed by Samurott's Waterfall without a boosting item). Fighting-types such as Sawk, Primeape, and Gurdurr are also easily capable of OHKOing Lairon, and Gurdurr in particular does not take very much damage from Head Smash due to its great physical bulk. Spikes tend to wear down Lairon a lot as it does not have any recovery and is forced out somewhat easily, meaning that this limits it ability to wall other Pokemon severely. Finally, Lairon has a rather poor special bulk when compared to its physical bulk, meaning that strong special attackers such as Charziard or Eelektross can finish off a slightly weakened Lairon, even though Head Smash punishes many switch-in opportunities, especially for the former.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<p>Due to Head Smash, the ability to hold an Eviolite, and a typing that grants it multiple resistances, Lairon gets several opportunities to set up Stealth Rock or fire off a powerful attack. As Stealth Rock supports its teammates and checks dangerous Pokemon such as Charizard and Braviary, every team needs some sort of user of the move. Head Smash is the preferred STAB attack, which hits very hard coming off of Lairon, hitting significantly harder than even Golem's Stone Edge, and Earthquake covers the Rock- and Steel-types that could take the hit easily, although note that the lack of STAB means Head Smash outdamages it even if Earthquake is super effective. Roar allows Lairon to phaze an opponent that may be trying to set up on Lairon, such as Musharna or Braviary—notably, having Roar makes Lairon one of the best checks for Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary in NU. However, Toxic can cripple walls that can take multiple hits from Lairon, such as Alomomola and Tangela.</p> <p>Maximized Attack is preferred to take full advantage of Head Smash, although a physically defensive spread can make Lairon extremely durable on the physical side—it takes these hits well enough regardless, however, and its higher offensive presence is the main reason to use it over other Rock-types anyway. Iron Head allows Lairon to have an extra STAB attack, but it doesn't offer that much additional coverage and is usually inferior to Earthquake as it covers more targets.</p> <p>Lairon's common weaknesses warrant partners that can take these hits for it. Misdreavus in particular makes a very good partner due to its immunities to Ground and Fighting, as well as its ability to keep Stealth Rock from being spun away. Musharna is a similar partner, and can typically set up on Fighting-types due to its high bulk while still having enough bulk to take a fair amount of Earthquakes. Grass-types, especially Tangela and Roselia, also make good partners for Lairon. The former's ridiculous physical defense allows it to sponge Ground attacks very easily and take a fair amount of Fighting-type moves as well, while the latter has high special bulk and is able to easily take Water-type attacks that scare out Lairon. It can also use the opportunity to set up Spikes, which can further wear down opponents alongside Stealth Rock. In return, Lairon generally has a very easy time taking on Flying-type attacks, especially from the likes of Swellow and Braviary as it 4x resists both their STABs. Finally, Eelektross and Rotom-S make good partners as they both are immune to Ground-type attacks and have an Electric STAB in order to scare out Water-types. The latter can take on Fighting-types for Lairon, even though it does have difficulty switching into them occasionally, while the former can threaten Pokemon such as Golem or Seismitoad due to its access to Giga Drain.</p>"

Its base 90 Attack isn't too shabby and is more than compensated for by the high Base Power of Head Smash. Autotomize boosts Lairon's terrible Speed to decent levels and lets Lairon go for a sweep. Head Smash is its main offensive move and differentiates itself from other Rock Polish sweepers such as Camerupt. Head Smash hits most Pokemon ridiculously hard, especially as a large amount of Pokemon in NU are weak to Rock-type attacks. Earthquake hits all Pokemon that resist Head Smash for at least neutral damage, with Torterra being the only notable exception. Iron Head is a reliable STAB move that never misses and has a good chance to flinch the opponent after a Speed boost.</p> <p>Adamant is the nature of choice to give Lairon the most attacking power after full EV investment in Attack and Speed; however, Jolly can be used to let Lairon outrun Pokemon such as Swoobat. In general, though, it is not worth the reduction in power.</p> <p>Fighting- and Ground-types are Lairon's greatest enemies, so Flying-types and Levitating Ghost-types, such as Golbat and Misdreavus are once again Lairon's best partners.

    "overview": "<p>Roselia is one of few Pokemon in NU that has access to Spikes, which it can set up reliably thanks to its Grass-, Water-, and Electric-type resistances and good special bulk with Eviolite. Its typing and relatively high Special Attack also allow her to stop various Pokemon in NU, such as Ludicolo, Alomomola, and Seismitoad. Unfortunately, Roselia's Defense is rather lackluster even with Eviolite, leaving it vulnerable to common physical attacks, such as those from Kangaskhan and Sawk. Roselia also faces competition as a Spiker from Garbodor, which has better physical bulk to tank Fighting- and Bug-type attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Roselia has a great support movepool with moves such as Aromatherapy, Stun Spore, Cotton Spore, and Toxic. Roselia also has access to Toxic Spikes, which could be used instead of Sludge Bomb on some teams. Extrasensory is an option to hit Poison-types such as Garbodor and Haunter harder. Roselia also has access to Sleep Powder, but because it's illegal with Spikes, it rarely sees use. As Roselia's typing is more suited to taking physical attacks, one could choose to run an EV spread of 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD with a bold nature to capitalize on this. Keep in mind that Natural Cure is really the only ability you should be using on Roselia, as Poison Point is too unreliable and Leaf Guard is basically an inferior Natural Cure that needs sun up in order to work. Finally, Roselia could also utilize its relatively high Special Attack on an offensive set with Leaf Storm or Giga Drain alongside Sludge Bomb, allowing it to hit opponents hard and get more chances to set up Spikes, but Leaf Storm is illegal with Spikes and Roselia faces competition as an offensive Spiker from Garbodor.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Despite Roselia's impressive bulk with Eviolite, nearly any physical attacker can take it down. Sawk, Golurk, and Kangaskhan can all at least 2HKO Roselia. On top of that, not even Roselia's special bulk can protect it from the Psychic-, Fire-, and Ice-types throughout NU; Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Charizard, and Rotom-Frost all make short work of her with their super effective STAB moves. Steel-types can also switch into Roselia with few problems. Klang is one of the best options, as it can simply set up while all Roselia can do is use Spikes or switch out. Poison-types are in the same boat, resisting both of Roselia's STABs and even absorbing any Toxic Spikes Roselia might have set up. Muk, Skuntank, and Golbat are good choices, as Muk can OHKO with Ice Punch, while Skuntank can damage Roselia on the way out with Pursuit, taking away about half its health. Golbat, while unable to absorb Toxic Spikes, takes almost nothing from Roselia's attacks and can OHKO it back with Brave Bird. Finally, while Knock Off and Trick do not stop Roselia from setting up Spikes, it removes Roselia's Eviolite, making Roselia much easier to defeat.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Spikes": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Roselia's access to Spikes and solid special bulk, which allows it to switch into most special attacks with relative ease. Roselia can also use its Toxic immunity to grant it free switches and start setting up Spikes. Rest restores all of Roselia's HP, increasing its longevity at the cost of having to switch out so that Natural Cure can wake it up. Synthesis can be used instead to let Roselia stay in longer and set up more layers of Spikes. Giga Drain is Roselia's primary STAB attack, hitting common Pokemon such as Golem and Samurott for super effective damage. Sludge Bomb is useful for hitting the many Pokemon that resist Giga Drain, such as Charizard, Tangela, and Serperior, and gives Roselia a way to hit Pokemon with Sap Sipper.</p> <p>A specially defensive spread is usually Roselia's best option because of its ability to check common special attackers. Additionally, Armaldo is the only spinner in the tier capable of switching into Roselia without being 2HKOed after Stealth Rock damage, as Wartortle and Torkoal can be taken down by Giga Drain and Sludge Bomb, respectively.</p> <p>Although better at being a special wall, Roselia is also capable of running a physically defensive spread well—this allows her to utilize her more physically-inclined defensive typing while still having good special bulk. By utilizing such a spread, Roselia can now check Ground-types, such as Golem, more easily. However, while this variant of Roselia does have its merits, it still has some glaring flaws—for example, Roselia's physical bulk is still not fantastic even when invested, and it can still be 2HKOed by many common physical attackers in the tier, such as Golurk and Kangaskhan. Additionally, this comes at the cost of Roselia failing to check special attackers, such as Ludicolo and Samurott, nearly as well as specially defensive variants, as it's far more vulnerable to Ice Beam.</p> <p>As Roselia's Defense is lacking, it appreciates having a Pokemon to take physical hits for it. Alomomola is one of the best options, as not only can it take physical hits for Roselia, but it also resists the Fire- and Ice-type moves that ruin Roselia's day. Meanwhile, Roselia can take any Electric- and Grass-type attacks, as well as Toxics, aimed at Alomomola. It should be noted that Alomomola does not beat most Ice-types, it just tanks their hits in order to pivot to another partner. Musharna is another great partner, as it can effectively wall Sawk, one of the bigger threats to Roselia. Bastiodon is also a good choice thanks to its access to Stealth Rock, and it synergizes well with Roselia typing wise. As for spinblockers, Misdreavus is one of the best options, not only because of its bulk, but also because it can burn the physical attackers that threaten Roselia. Finally, Skuntank makes a good partner, as it can take care of any Psychic-types that threaten Roselia with Pursuit.</p>"

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>With an offensive set, Roselia can serve as a bulky offensive pivot and status absorber for more offensive and balanced teams. Roselia can come in, take a hit, strike back with strong STABs coming off of base 100 Special Attack, and use Sleep Powder to disrupt the opposing team. The ability to absorb Toxic Spikes along with Poison STAB really separate Roselia from other bulky offensive pivots such as Tangela. Without Spikes on this set, Roselia is able to use Sleep Powder to cripple would-be checks that would normally have nothing to fear. Sludge Bomb is Roselia's most powerful STAB move, and it has really good neutral coverage and a handy chance to poison the foe. Giga Drain, Roselia's other STAB, covers the Ground- and Rock-types that resist Sludge Bomb, and it also lets Roselia take on bulky Water-types such as Seismitoad and Alomomola that can be problematic for offensive teams. Synthesis allows Roselia to remain healthy throughout the match, and it can be used to heal up against the Pokemon that are put to sleep by Sleep Powder.</p> <p>The Speed EVs used on this set are to allow Roselia to outspeed max Speed Golem, Armaldo, and Marowak, with the rest thrown into Special Attack and HP for offensive presence and added bulk. Both Eviolite and Natural Cure allow Roselia to come in against a variety of attackers and absorb status for the team. Toxic Spikes or Spikes could be used on this set, but using Spikes would mean that you can't use Sleep Powder, as the two are illegal together, and Roselia doesn't usually have room for Toxic Spikes. Leaf Storm can be used over Giga Drain, but Roselia likes to stay in for as long as it can without being forced to switch out. For this same reason, though Rest might sound better than Synthesis thanks to Natural Cure, it is usually inferior.</p> <p>Roselia partners really well with other pivots that share great defensive synergy. Metang and Regirock are both good options, as they can set up Stealth Rock, and Metang can take on Flying-, Psychic-, and Ice-type attacks while Regirock can take on Flying- and Fire-type attacks. In return, Roselia can take on opposing Water- and Grass-types really well and also has a good matchup against most Ground-types. Practically every Steel-type walls Roselia completely, so offensive partners that can take them on will prove to be beneficial. Strong Fighting-types such as Sawk and Fire-types such as Charizard and Camerupt can come in on most Steel-types and take them on with their STAB super effective attacks. Finally, Roselia's ability to absorb Toxic Spikes is greatly appreciated by setup sweepers that play significantly worse while poisoned. Carracosta loves the lack of Toxic Spikes on its side of the field, and it can set up against Fire- and Flying-types that try to take out Roselia. Similarly, Swords Dance Samurott can set up against Ice- and Fire-types and hates to be poisoned.</p>"

Its movepool is decent, but it has very low offensive stats. The only niche Swalot has over those Poison-types is Encore, but that is rarely enough to merit its usage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gunk Shot can be utilized instead of Sludge Bomb for a higher damage output, but the lower accuracy and PP are generally not worth it. Swalot has access to Yawn, which can be useful when forcing switches. Curse is a viable option as well, but Swalot is outclassed in sweeping by Curse Muk and Coil Arbok. Swalot has access to a wide variety of physical and special moves, but its offenses are too low to pull off any viable set. A Custap Berry + Destiny Bond set is optional, but is gimmicky and unreliable. Swalot can set up weather as well, but it is outclassed by Pokemon with better typings and abilities. Lastly, Swalot has access to Swagger, but the strategy is luck-based and unreliable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Poison- and Steel-types walk all over Swalot if it lacks Earthquake. Some Pokemon, such as Weezing, Haunter, Grass / Poison types, and defensive Metang, can even handle sets with Earthquake. Taunt users, such as Mandibuzz and Misdreavus, shut down Swalot as well. Strong Ground-type attacks from Golurk, Sawk, and Golem can quickly dispose of Swalot; Psychic-type STAB attacks from Musharna and Gardevoir do the same. Substitute users, such as Gorebyss and Braviary, can avoid Toxic, but they must be wary of Encore. Lastly, clerics, such as Lickilicky and Audino, remove the status Swalot spreads and can wall Swalot for a while.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Swalot's main niche is Encore, which allows Swalot to disrupt sweepers trying to set up on it, such as Gurdurr and Musharna. Toxic is Swalot's most reliable method of dealing damage, as its offensive stats are too lackluster to leave a serious dent. Sludge Bomb is Swalot's most reliable STAB attack, due to its high PP and decent Base Power. The potential poisoning effect is also great when afflicting switch-ins. Pain Split offers Swalot decent recovery, but Earthquake hits the Steel- and Poison-types that plan on switching into Toxic super effectively.</p> <p>Swalot should only use a Relaxed nature if it is using Earthquake. Protect can fit in the set to scout for moves, Toxic stall, and gain Leftovers recovery. Great partners for Swalot include Mandibuzz, which is immune to both of Swalot's weaknesses and wields outstanding bulk. Ground-types, such as Golurk and Golem, make good offensive partners for Swalot because they can eliminate the Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon that could switch in on Toxic, saving Swalot the trouble of needing Earthquake as well. Lastly, partners with Taunt are also helpful so clerics can not eliminate the status Swalot spreads.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Wailord's size does not translate into usefulness, especially in a metagame where Pokemon such as Alomomola and Ludicolo are so common. Its main selling point is the deadly Water Spout, which pairs with Choice Specs to become a weapon that crushes anything that doesn't resist it. While Water isn't the best type to spam with the prevalence of Water-immune and -resistant Pokemon such as Seismitoad and Roselia, Wailord unfortunately has average at best power with its coverage moves. Despite its size, Wailord is not difficult to wear down, as its high HP is mitigated by its low defenses. Low Speed becomes the final nail in the coffin, as Wailord cannot outspeed most offensive teams without a lot of support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Scarf set is usable, but it lacks power and is outsped by nearly every other Choice Scarf user and positive Speed natured Pokemon with a base 115 or higher Speed. A dedicated Trick Room team can fit Wailord if it uses a Quiet nature, but Trick Room teams are generally gimmicks. A defensive set with Scald, Roar, Rest, and Sleep Talk is a possibility, but Wailord's poor defenses let it down. Toxic can catch specially bulky Pokemon, such as Regice, Lickilicky, and Audino, on the switch; unfortunately, these Pokemon tend to carry a move to deal with status such as Rest or Heal Bell. Wailord has a decent physical movepool with gems such as Waterfall, Earthquake, Heavy Slam, Body Slam, and Avalanche. Unfortunately, Wailord cannot physically power through Pokemon easily, and such sets are outclassed by faster and stronger Water-types such as Samurott and Floatzel. Curse can work with these physical moves, but it does nothing to patch Wailord's low Special Defense. Self-Destruct works as a last resort, but Wailord is still slow, and you are still better off using your Water STAB rather than sacrificing Wailord, as the difference in power is negligible. Amnesia can patch up Wailord's low Special Defense, but it does nothing for its Defense.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bulky Water-type Pokemon wall Wailord if it lacks Hidden Power Grass, especially Water Absorb Seismitoad and Mantine, while specially defensive Ludicolo walls Wailord if it lacks Hidden Power Bug. Specially defensive Pokemon, such as Lickilicky, Regice, and Audino, can take a couple of Water Spouts and cripple Wailord with status or simply retaliate and reduce Water Spout's power. However, they struggle to take Water Spout if Wailord is at maximum health, as it can 2HKO all three after Stealth Rock damage. Any Pokemon that is faster than Wailord can inflict large amounts of damage on it, forcing it to use Surf or Hydro Pump instead. Grass-types can switch in against Wailord's Water-type moves, but they must be wary of Ice Beam, which 2HKOes almost all of them.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Water Spout is Wailord's strongest move if it can maintain relatively high health; enhanced by Choice Specs, Water Spout can power through any Pokemon that doesn't resist it or have high special bulk. Ice Beam has excellent coverage alongside Wailord's Water-type STAB moves, hitting everything bar opposing Water-types for at least neutral damage. Hidden Power Grass allows Wailord to damage most Water-types and is especially useful for damaging Seismitoad. Surf and Hydro Pump are reliable STAB moves for Wailord to use when its HP drops too low.</p> <p>140 Speed EVs allow Wailord to outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Golem, and its damage output is maximized with a Modest nature and maximum investment in Special Attack. The remaining EVs are allocated to its defenses to improve its overall durability better than by simply investing in its HP. Maximum Speed is a possibility in order to outspeed Misdreavus. Scald is a viable option instead of Surf or Hydro Pump, as its burn chance can rack up considerable chip damage on common switch-ins such as Lickilicky and Regice. Stealth Rock support allows Wailord to wear down foes that resist Water, such as Alomomola; Ground-types such as Golem and Golurk are great teammates for this role, as they also provide an immunity to Electric-type moves. Spikes support is also useful, as they can help wear down Pokemon such as Roselia and Ludicolo Wailord struggles to take on. Garbodor and Roselia are excellent options, as they also help absorb Toxic Spikes on your field, which can otherwise quickly drain Wailord's health. Both of these Pokemon also offer a much appreciated resistance to Grass-type moves. Grass- and Electric-types can deal with opposing Water-types that resist Wailord's STAB moves and Ice Beam. Fire-types such as Charizard and Torkoal are effective teammates to remove bulky Grass-types that resist Wailord's STAB moves and also form a Fire / Water / Grass core with it alongside a Grass-type teammate. Torkoal is also able to remove entry hazards from your field to maintain Wailord's HP. Paralysis support from teammates such as Musharna and Liepard is highly beneficial so that Wailord can outspeed a larger portion of the opponent's team. Rain support from Pokemon such as Volbeat and Liepard can be beneficial because it makes Water Spout immensely powerful, though this is most effective on a dedicated rain team.</p>"

Its typing is thoroughly unique, boasting immunities to Electric and burn as well as neutrality to Grass and Ice. This makes it a solid check to Electric-types like Eelektross, Rotom-S, and Electabuzz, notably being able to block Rotom-F's Volt Switch, avoid a 2HKO from Blizzard, and threaten it back. However, Camerupt's typing is a double-edged sword, as it is hindered by two very common weaknesses in Ground and Water. Therefore, Camerupt often has trouble thwarting opposing Stealth Rock users. Camerupt has awful Speed, which, in tandem with its merely average bulk and lack of reliable recovery, leaves it quite vulnerable to being overwhelmed and often forced out.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Protect allows Camerupt to scout Water- and Ground-types likes Alomomola, Golurk, Samurott, and Seismitoad, as well as Choice-locked attackers such as Sawk and Rotom-S. However, Protect can end up giving free entry for said Water- and Ground-types, forcing Camerupt out. Toxic and Will-O-Wisp let Camerupt punish switch-ins like Samurott and Golurk while adding to Stealth Rock's chip damage. Yawn serves similarly to Roar. All three also let Camerupt punish bulky Pokemon like Alomomola and Mandibuzz. However, they tend to be difficult to slot because the listed options have better utility overall. A Choice Specs set can act as a horrifying wallbreaker, boasting a mighty STAB Eruption and solid coverage with Earth Power and Hidden Power Grass. However, this set tends to be easily revenge killed due to Camerupt's meager bulk, and it's a much less consistent answer to the likes of Eelektross and Rotom-F.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Alomomola, Samurott, and Seismitoad can easily switch into Camerupt's moves, and they deal massive damage in return with their STAB attacks, the latter two possibly even OHKOing it after minor chip damage. However, none of these Pokemon particularly enjoy burns from Lava Plume.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Golurk and Golem can come in on a predicted Lava Plume or Stealth Rock and threaten to OHKO Camerupt with their Ground-type attacks. However, they must be wary of Earth Power and Lava Plume burns.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Zweilous and Altaria completely wall Camerupt, and in return, they can phaze it or overwhelm it with repeated attacks, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Camerupt's middling defenses and lack of recovery make it very susceptible to residual damage from entry hazards and statuses, such as Toxic from Mandibuzz, Garbodor, and Seismitoad.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Strong attackers, especially physical ones such as Kangaskhan, Sawk, Braviary, and Swellow, can take advantage of Camerupt's middling bulk and deal major damage to it, with the latter two being able to OHKO it.</p>",

Camerupt heavily appreciates partners that can deal with Water- and Ground-types.

Roselia has a resistance to Water while also boasting Spikes, creating a good hazard-stacking core. Alomomola is yet another great check to Water- and Ground-types and boasts major utility with its massive Wish. In return, Camerupt provides a capable pivot into the Electric-types that threaten these teammates, namely Rotom-S and Eelektross.

  "Grumpig": {
    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written around the time that BW was considered the main generation. The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW NU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>Stuck in a tier where Psychic-type Pokemon run rampant, Grumpig struggles to make an impact, as most of its roles are better done by Psychic-types that boast reliable recovery moves and/or workable defenses. However, the additional resistances granted by its Thick Fat ability allow it to patch up holes in teams, and the new found access to Heal Bell coupled with Whirlwind grant it a solid niche over its competition as a specially defensive cleric. While this niche is not enough for Grumpig to find a spot on most teams, it does wield the ability to check one of the biggest threats in the NU metagame: Charizard.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Calm Mind set is viable, but Musharna and Gardevoir are better choices for this due to the former's defenses and the latter's offenses. Musharna also handles the dual screens role better, as it has access to Moonlight and better bulk. Trick can be used, but Grumpig's Choice Scarf set misses out on the base 95 Speed tier, and the Choice Specs set is not strong enough; additionally both sets are better done by Gardevoir and the latter is also run better by Musharna. Grumpig can also set up weather, but Prankster Pokemon and setup sweepers are more reliable. Magic Coat is a fun, situational move that surprises well known status inducers, but it is generally not worth the moveslot. Lastly, Grumpig can run a set of Rest / Sleep Talk / Psyshock / Heal Bell for self-recovery, but it loses its utility as a phazer and as a status inducer.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Most physical attackers, including Skuntank, Golurk, Pinsir, and Swellow, outspeed and crush Grumpig. Primeape deserves a special mention, as a super effective U-turn will scare Grumpig out and force its team to lose significant momentum. Mandibuzz can also Taunt Grumpig with absolutely nothing to fear from it in return. Nevertheless, all of these Pokemon risk being hit by a Thunder Wave or Toxic on the switch or being blown right back out with Whirlwind. Ground-type Pokemon in general are great checks, as they can come in on a Thunder Wave and set up or attack. Any Taunt user typically forces Grumpig out, and Pokemon with Pursuit will be having pork for dinner; Skuntank is a prime example of both of these. Misdreavus is also a good check, as it can Taunt Grumpig or smack it with a super effective Foul Play or Shadow Ball. Lastly, Rapid Spin users ruin Grumpig's phazing antics, and clerics spoil Grumpig's status shenanigans; for example, Lickilicky can remove its statuses and wear Grumpig down with Body Slam.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility Support": {
        "description": "<p>Fitting best on bulky teams with entry hazards, Grumpig's job is to support its team with Heal Bell, phaze with Whirlwind, and paralyze or poison as much as possible to aid its team members. Its high base Speed for a wall comes in handy, as it outpaces the majority of defensive Pokemon in the tier. Psychic is a reliable STAB move that is excellent for whittling down the opposition. Whirlwind works well at preventing Pokemon from setting up on Grumpig, as well as racking up entry hazard damage. Grumpig's resistances from Thick Fat and impressive special bulk provide it with many chances to use Heal Bell, removing fatal status conditions, as well as allowing teammates to use Rest as a recovery move.</p> <p>If stall teams cause problems, Taunt can be used in the last moveslot so opposing Pokemon do not ruin Grumpig's supporting capabilities. If you would rather not use one of Grumpig's moveslots, Taunt users such as Mandibuzz, Misdreavus, or Serperior are encouraged as partners. Focus Blast can also be used in place of Thunder Wave and Toxic to surprise clerics such as Lickilicky and Audino, but it fails to do much damage to either. Wish support is nice for Grumpig as it cannot reliably recover itself. Alomomola is a good partner as it can patch Grumpig's lackluster Defense, or Audino or Lickilicky can be used to form a Special Defense core, as they have good typing synergy with Grumpig. Regirock, Carracosta, and Miltank are some great Stealth Rock users to complement Grumpig's phazing because of their physical bulk. Miltank deserves a special mention as Grumpig can take most Fighting-type attacks headed towards it, and Miltank can take the Ghost-type attacks aimed at Grumpig. Miltank also can fill the cleric role, allowing Grumpig to use a different move in its first slot. Offensive partners that work well with Grumpig are those that can take out the physical Dark-, Bug-, and Ghost-type Pokemon that threaten it. Golem is a great example because it can beat the popular Skuntank as well as most Bug-type Pokemon, and can Sucker Punch the ever-present Golurk for hefty damage. In return Grumpig patches up Golem's terrible Special Defense. Lastly, spinblockers such as Misdreavus are needed to keep hazards on the field to ensure Grumpig's phazing has a purpose; just make sure the team covers their shared Dark and Ghost weaknesses.</p>"

  "Spinda": {
    "overview": "<p>A few strange gimmick Pokemon have been made by Game Freak over the course of five generations of Pokemon: Castform was meant to showcase then-new weather moves and abilities, Unown was made to furnish the Ruins of Alph and create a mildly inconvenient form of code writing, Smeargle could learn every move but had pitiful stats with which to do so, and Plusle and Minun were Pikachu clones meant to represent double battles. At the very least, such Pokemon served a purpose, no matter how contrived. In comparison, Spinda seems extremely random, if you pardon the pun. It's a Pokemon with a variable sprite based on PID and... that's about it. Spinda is, to put it bluntly, a terrible Pokemon. No matter what it tries to do, it will always be held back by its abysmal stats, nearly matched by such fearsome monsters as Farfetch'd and Snorunt. For some strange reason, Game Freak had the urge to polish one of their turds and released Spinda in the Dream World with Superpower--a move Spinda literally cannot learn in any other way--to go with Contrary, allowing it to effectively gain a Bulk Up boost upon launching off a strong Fighting-type attack. Sadly, Game Freak paused the process and, evidently, forgot about it--Spinda cannot learn Superpower in BW2, which means that the surprisingly decent combination of Baton Pass, Rapid Spin, and Superpower remains illegal. In the meantime, Spinda remains a mangled mess, a useless piece of junk that nobody is ever meant to use, simply a remnant of Game Freak's caprice.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>It seems genuinely unfair that a Pokemon with such a rich list of Egg moves, including Rapid Spin, Wish, Baton Pass, Encore, and Disable, cannot use any due to illegalities. Without these moves, Spinda is stuck with little else. However, if you feel brave enough to use Spinda without Superpower, these Egg moves become legal, allowing Spinda to take advantage of being the sole user of both Baton Pass and Rapid Spin in the tier; it can also Baton Pass Calm Mind. Spinda's movepool is filled with random physical attacks such as Zen Headbutt, the elemental punches, and Wild Charge, but they all lack power and, more importantly, purpose. Teeter Dance is an option to make your opponent play recklessly by making him or her think that you are a terrible player.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Spinda cannot get past a single Ghost-type in the tier without Toxic; most have status moves and thus cannot be hit by any of Spinda's moves while switching in or by Sucker Punch. Whether the Ghost-type is Golurk or Shuppet, Spinda is not going to win against it. Most strong special attackers are able to take Spinda out in one fell swoop, especially as damage from Life Orb racks up; however, they must be aware of Sucker Punch. Physically defensive Pokemon, especially Tangela, Alomomola, and Shelgon, have little difficulty walling Spinda, even after one or two uses of Superpower. However, as Spinda begins to accumulate boosts, entertainingly enough, it becomes harder and harder to get rid of; previously solid Pokemon like those mentioned become easier and easier to KO with sufficient prior damage. Ironically, Superpower is, in itself, a cap on most of the power Spinda will ever hope to have. The move's pitiful 8 PP ensures that a Spinda that has had its sweep interrupted will not sweep again.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Attacker?": {
        "description": "<p>Although this set might be dangerous in the hands of something with better stats, in the stubs of Spinda, it's barely threatening. After bravely switching Spinda in (hopefully on a Pokemon that has been hit by Memento and also uses Memento), use Trick Room to give Spinda a tiny chance to deal a bit of damage. Double-Edge is Spinda's strongest STAB move; our permanently disabled koala definitely needs any power it can get. Superpower, as previously mentioned, allows Spinda to raise its stats while firing off a moderately powerful attack that pairs well with its STAB. Sucker Punch is the second strongest priority move in the game and Spinda's strongest move against Ghost-types. Using it against a frail Pokemon that has already taken a Superpower might, hilariously enough, actually result in a KO for Spinda!</p> <p>Spinda has a large number of options, yet almost all of them are, unsurprisingly, stuck in its Egg moves and therefore illegal with Superpower. As a result, the best moves Spinda has to offer include: Return, a safer but weaker alternative to Double-Edge; Drain Punch, which can be used over Trick Room to recover a bit of health in a pinch; Toxic, a move that every Pokemon learns to break down walls; and Substitute, which can protect Spinda from harmful status but not, unfortunately, equally harmful damage. Spinda can use Leftovers, but loses a great deal of its superpower without a Life Orb. Spinda needs as many entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field as it can get, so be sure to set up as many as possible with Pokemon like Cacturne and Garbodor to even entertain the possibility of a mythical Spinda sweep.</p>"

That said, Cacturne hasn't only pulled short straws; boasting the craved move Spikes in its arsenal of moves, Cacturne has the ability to fill the role of an offensive Spiker. With access to STAB Sucker Punch, it can also bypass its terrible Speed stat to an extent, making Swords Dance a viable way to clean through offensive teams after Pokemon that resist Dark are out of the way. Its typing and ability also provide immunities to Psychic- and Water-type moves, allowing it to set up Spikes and Swords Dance much more easily.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>When thinking of other options for Cacturne, its base 115 Special Attack stat stands out the brightest, especially alongside its access to the awesome boosting move Nasty Plot. That said, a fully special attacking set is almost out of the question due to Cacturne's abysmal Speed; physical sets work thanks to priority Sucker Punch, but Cacturne has no priority that hits off its Special Attack stat. A mixed set is an option though; Focus Blast is a move that has amazing coverage alongside Cacturne's STAB attacks, so it could be used in the second moveslot of the first set. Cacturne also has options left to choose when attacking physically, but the only notable one is Focus Punch, which can be used alongside Substitute. However, this will prevent Cacturne from using Spikes or Swords Dance—the building blocks of Cacturne's niche. Finally, Choice Band and Choice Specs sets are options, especially as Cacturne has access to Switcheroo, but they usually are not a good idea due to its atrocious Speed stat.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Unless you give Cacturne a free turn, it is not hard to counter at all. Common Pokemon won't have a hard time checking or countering it. Bulky Grass-types such as Vileplume, Tangela, and Roselia can all sponge Cacturne's hits rather well, and if given the chance, deal major damage with Sludge Bomb or Hidden Power Fire. If Cacturne lacks Drain Punch, most bulky Steel-types shut it down, as they resists both of its STAB moves. Metang is probably the best overall Steel-type check to Cacturne, as it isn't hit super effectively by Drain Punch.</p>",

      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>This set focuses on making the very best out of Cacturne's ability to lay down Spikes and hit hard at the same time. The first moveslot is obviously Spikes; Spikes is one of the most useful moves any Pokemon can get, and even though Cacturne's stats don't exactly encourage using it, it's still the main reason to use Cacturne at all. In the second moveslot, Destiny Bond is usually preferred, as it can surprise an unsuspecting Pokemon and take it down. Swords Dance is also an option, as Cacturne can take advantage of bulky Water-types, such as Alomomola, and punch holes in offensive teams. Sucker Punch fills the third moveslot, as it helps bypass Cacturne's pathetic Speed stat and hits with stellar power after the STAB boost is taken into account. Seed Bomb is the obvious choice for the final moveslot, as it grants Cacturne additional STAB coverage and comes with the benefit of hitting Alomomola, a Pokemon that physical attackers normally have a hard time breaking through, extremely hard.</p> <p>The only change that should be considered for the EVs and nature is using Adamant over Jolly. This is not recommended though, as Jolly allows Cacturne to outpace standard Misdreavus, something very useful for an entry hazard setter. Focus Sash is the only item you should use on this set. Even though Life Orb might seem like a viable alternative, Cacturne is simply too frail to miss out on the guaranteed one-time survival that Focus Sash brings, especially as it should be used as a suicide lead. A different move option would be Substitute, which can help Cacturne pressure the opponent and avoid status, but as you should never run Focus Sash in tandem with Substitute, it should only be used with Leftovers instead.</p> <p>As this Cacturne set aims to set up Spikes, offensive Pokemon appreciate it for the extra damage output against walls, making them harder to switch into, the most prevalent being Samurott, Sawk, and Kangaskhan. Cacturne's favorite teammate, though, is definitely Golurk; the two together have great synergy both offensively and defensively, as Golurk can spinblock the Spikes set by Cacturne and can even set Stealth Rock, a move that works amazingly in tandem with Spikes.</p>"

      "Physical Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Making use of the deadly combination of Swords Dance and Sucker Punch, this Cacturne set is very scary if it gets to set up. Swords Dance makes Cacturne a deadly offensive threat; with a Life Orb boost, Sucker Punch can OHKO many prevalent threats such as Primeape after Stealth Rock, and Samurott. Sucker Punch is the main attacking move, as the priority it has lets Cacturne threaten a myriad of offensive threats and helps it bypass its annoying Speed problem. Seed Bomb is necessary as it lets Cacturne hit threats such as Alomomola much harder and gives it way to avoid having to predict with Sucker Punch, which can be helpful against slower foes. Drain Punch is the main move for the final slot, as it provides perfect neutral coverage by hitting Steel-types hard. Substitute is a great move for use against Misdreavus and Alomomola to avoid status and set up easily though. It also pressures the opponent to attack Cacturne, which makes Sucker Punch more reliable.</p> <p>A different EV spread of 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe and an Adamant nature can be used in tandem with Substitute and Leftovers, enables Cacturne to still outspeed Alomomola and save many EVs for HP to survive hits, thereby having a much easier time setting up. Without higher Speed investment though, Cacturne will be outpaced and burned by Misdreavus before it does anything. Life Orb is preferred if using Drain Punch, but if you plan on utilizing Substitute in the fourth moveslot, Leftovers is the definite item of choice. Lum Berry and Dark Gem are also viable options for the item slot, as the former helps Cacturne set up against walls and the latter allows for a single, hard-hitting Sucker Punch without eating away at Cacturne's HP like Life Orb does.</p> <p>Offensive Probopass is one of the best partners for this particular Cacturne set; not only is it able to set up Stealth Rock to help Cacturne sweep more easily, but it also traps and kills most Steel-types that resist Cacturne's STAB attacks. Unfortunately, the core is demolished by just about any Fighting-type in NU. Golurk is a great partner with fantastic offensive and defensive synergy, and the ability to support Cacturne's potential sweeps by setting up Stealth Rock. Fire-types such as Charizard, Rapidash, and Camerupt are good partners too, as they can lure in Water-types, threaten bulky Grass- and Steel-types, and switch into Fire-type attacks aimed at Cacturne.</p>"

  "Altaria": {
    "overview": "<p>Altaria seems like a great choice in a tier with few Dragon-type Pokemon. However, past its appealing defensive stats, there is little incentive to use it. Altaria has horrible weaknesses to Rock- and Ice-type attacks that curb its otherwise great bulk immensely. A Dragon Dance set with Altaria seems promising, but then you compare it to Fraxure and Dragonair, and it simply pales in comparison; Fraxure has more power, whilst Dragonair has Extreme Speed and isn't weak to Stealth Rock. Still, Altaria does have unique access to supportive and defensive options such as Heal Bell and Roost, as well as Leftovers (as its competition needs Eviolite to function). It's also the only specially based Dragon-type Pokemon in NU, and powerful moves such as Draco Meteor and Fire Blast make up for its poor offensive stats. Overall though, Altaria is still a rather lackluster choice.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A support set looks good, but Altaria is Stealth Rock weak. Choice Band also looks good, but it is worse than Choice Specs and Outrage locks Altaria into the attack. Mixed attacking also looks viable, but Altaria's stats simply aren't good enough to spread EVs this way. Roar on bulky Dragon Dance looks decent, but Altaria is left very susceptible to status ailments. A gimmicky Draco Meteor set with Haze or Power Swap is fun to use but difficult to pull off. Cotton Guard can make Altaria incredibly physically bulky; this can work well with Dragon Dance to give Altaria many setup opportunities but still leaves its Ice Beam weakness unresolved. Agility isn't as good as Dragon Dance as Altaria doesn't have very good base offenses. Tailwind is a good support move, but Pokemon such as Braviary and Charizard are generally better Tailwind users. Similarly, other Pokemon tend to outperform Altaria as a Rain Dance or Sunny Day user. Altaria has access to Pursuit, but that is only useful against Haunter, and even then does not guarantee a kill.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Altaria's counters really depends on which set you are using. Special walls such as Lickilicky and Audino wall Choice Specs, while physical walls such as Tangela and Regirock beat the Dragon Dance set. Regice counters both sets well as it is both physically and specially bulky and swiftly OHKOes with Ice Beam. In fact, any Pokemon that commonly uses Ice-type attacks, including many Water- and Electric-type Pokemon, can be a check to Altaria. Rock-type Pokemon wall Altaria well, particularly Regirock, which can take a Draco Meteor and KO back with Stone Edge. Golem breaks Substitute with Rock Blast. Steel-types wall Altaria's Dragon-type moves, but Altaria's movesets tends to prepare for them so be careful. Altaria's low offensive stats can be taken advantage of easily, particularly while it is at -2 from a Draco Meteor; Musharna and Braviary are able to set up on it rather easily. Altaria is also weak to Stealth Rock, which often makes its hit-and-run strategies inadvisable.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Generally considered to be Altaria's best set, Choice Specs allows it to fully utilize Draco Meteor's huge 140 Base Power (210 including STAB) to power through much of the tier. Altaria's good natural bulk allows it to switch in quite easily, forcing switches it can punish with a Choice-boosted attack. The lack of Steel-types in NU makes Draco Meteor the go-to move early, while Dragon Pulse's reliability makes it useful for late-game cleanup. For the few Steel-types that are around, such as Metang, Fire Blast is used. Rest, while normally odd on a Choice set, works well thanks to Natural Cure and Altaria's good bulk.</p> <p>Altaria uses a Modest nature to maximize its damage output, and doesn't miss out on outspeeding anything significant with a neutral Speed nature. Modest actually 2HKOes Misdreavus after Stealth Rock and OHKOes Samurott without any prior damage, two dangerous threats in NU. Hidden Power Ground can hit Probopass and Bastiodon, but it misses the 2HKO on the far more common Metang. Cloud Nine can be used to check rain sweepers such as Ludicolo, but most of the time Natural Cure is superior. Life Orb can also be used, with Roost over Rest. This allows Altaria to stay in battle longer as it won't be locked into a move, but the loss of power is notable. Steel-types have fantastic synergy with Altaria, and they can set up the ever-coveted Stealth Rock. Strong Fighting-type Pokemon such as Sawk and Primeape can help Altaria clear out problematic special walls, and Sawk can also stop the opponent from taking advantage of Altaria's Stealth Rock weakness by OHKOing many hazard setters. Altaria can also support Pokemon such as Swords Dance Samurott and Shell Smash Carracosta, both of which enjoy Altaria clearing out the physical walls that would otherwise block them.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Altaria is rather outclassed at using Dragon Dance, but it still has some advantages, the most apparent being the general bulk that Altaria possesses. Furthermore, it doesn't use Eviolite, but instead uses Leftovers for a little recovery every turn, and also has access to Roost, a more reliable recovery move for when you're in a pinch. Dragon Dance boosts Altaria's low Attack and decent Speed to deadly levels, but it requires quite a lot of setup. As such, Altaria will be forced into Roosting a lot, so Dragon Claw is used rather than Outrage so that Altaria isn't locked into attacks and doesn't get confused. Substitute shields Altaria from status ailments and revenge killing, and also helps it boost more efficiently. Heal Bell also shields both Altaria and your team from status, but it leaves Altaria prone to to being revenge killed.</p> <p>Before boosting, Altaria can outspeed offensive Torterra, and after a boost it can outspeed base 95 Speed Pokemon such as Primeape. Everything else is invested into special bulk, Altaria's stronger defense, so that it has more opportunities to set up. A more offensive spread, while possible, would be outclassed by Fraxure. Safeguard is an interesting option to prevent status for a few turns, but Heal Bell and Substitute have more general utility. Earthquake gives fantastic coverage, but there is no room on this set to use it. Toxic lets Altaria set up on walls whilst actually doing damage, but once again, there is no room; this does mean that Altaria loves Toxic Spikes support. Good Toxic Spikes users include Garbodor and Roselia. Altaria struggles against Rock-type Pokemon, so Pokemon that beat them, such as Alomomola, which provides Wish and Toxic support, and Wartortle, which spins Stealth Rocks away, are good partners. Special Samurott is a good offensive partner that deals with not only Rock-type Pokemon but also Metang. Altaria is also a good win condition on bulkier teams.</p>"

  "Zangoose": {
    "overview": "<p>Zangoose is a fearsome wallbreaker thanks to its perfect coverage and its ability, Toxic Boost. It has access to Swords Dance, and it's known for being able to nearly OHKO the entire tier after one turn of setup. Priority is also a highlighted trait on Zangoose; its Quick Attack can OHKO Charizard after Stealth Rock and can nearly KO -1 Primeape. Unfortunately, Zangoose is quite frail, and it does not like to take even neutral hits, so it can be difficult to set up Swords Dance and activate Toxic Orb unscathed. Zangoose is hindered not only by Toxic Orb putting it on a timer, but also by the prevalence of priority in the tier, such as from Kangaskhan, Carracosta, Gurdurr, and Skuntank. It also faces competition from fellow status Orb sweepers, specifically Swellow and Ursaring; the former is faster but has poorer coverage, and the latter can be faster or stronger than Zangoose with its abilities, but Zangoose possesses a mixture of both.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Zangoose has a few other options, but it should generally be running its standard moveset. Pursuit allows Zangoose to trap fleeing Ghost- and Psychic-types, although it's ideally better to just run Night Slash. Zangoose has access to all of the elemental punches, but they don't add additional coverage. The only notable one is Ice Punch, which allows it to OHKO Torterra. Zangoose has access to a wonderful specially offensive movepool with powerful moves such as Fire Blast, Ice Beam, and Thunderbolt, but they're unusable because of Zangoose's low base 60 Special Attack. Final Gambit with max HP will generally allow Zangoose to take down one Pokemon, but that wastes its potential. Taunt is interesting, as it'll stop walls such as Alomomola and Musharna from recovering health. Finally, other items, such as Choice Band, Life Orb, Choice Scarf, and Silk Scarf, can replace Toxic Orb if you can predict a Toxic, but it is an unwise decision; predicting a Toxic that Zangoose can switch into is very difficult and unlikely, making it not worth the risk to run another item.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Very few Pokemon can outright counter Zangoose. With that being said, Metang is a perfect counter, as it isn't weak to Close Combat and can take down Zangoose with Meteor Mash. Any relatively bulky Pokemon, such as Gurdurr, Golurk, and Piloswine, can take an unboosted hit and strike back with their STAB moves. Furthermore, faster Pokemon that can take a Quick Attack can check Zangoose; Tauros, and Haunter are good examples. Priority users such as Carracosta, Kangaskhan, Swellow, and Golem can take down a weakened Zangoose. Walls such as Tangela and Alomomola can take on Zangoose one-on-one, with the former being able to take any of Zangoose's hits while striking back with Giga Drain, and the latter is able to Toxic stall Zangoose; however, they must be wary of a Swords Dance-boosted attack. Before Zangoose activates its Toxic Orb, many Pokemon can easily tank a hit and KO it, as Zangoose lacks the power from Toxic Boost as well as a double-powered Facade.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set acts as a wallbreaker, as it's able to break down NU's most sturdiest walls. Facade becomes a powerful move after Toxic Orb is activated, reaching a Base Power of 210 when STAB is factored in. Close Combat grants additional coverage on Rock- and Steel-types that resist Facade, such as Golem, Regirock, and Probopass. Night Slash completes Zangoose's coverage, as it is able to hit Ghost-types, specifically Golurk and Misdreavus, which would otherwise be able to switch freely into any other move Zangoose has. Finally, Zangoose has access to Quick Attack, which allows it to defeat weakened, faster opponents, such as Charizard and Primeape.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is preferred because it allows Zangoose to Speed tie with Kangaskhan and outspeed positive-natured base 80 and 85 Speed Pokemon, such as Gardevoir and Sawk. However, an Adamant nature can be used to 2HKO Alomomola, Tangela, and offensive Regirock. Protect could be used over Quick Attack to guarantee Toxic Orb's activation, but it forces Zangoose to give up a moveslot and isn't useful outside of activating Toxic Orb.</p> <p>Entry hazard support from Golem and Garbodor is recommended to snag crucial KOs on the likes of Kangaskhan and Gardevoir. Zangoose appreciates slow Volt Switch support from users such as Eelektross, as it can activate its Toxic Orb without having to take a hit or relying on defeating the opponent. Eelektross also can take care of Alomomola and Tangela; the former can Toxic stall Zangoose, and the latter can deal heavy damage with Giga Drain. Dark-types such as Skuntank can remove Ghost-types, allowing Zangoose to freely use Close Combat and Facade. Common Fighting-types, such as Primeape and Gurdurr, can check Zangoose; a Psychic-type such as Musharna is a good teammate to tank hits and set up with Calm Mind. Late-game sweepers, such as Swords Dance Samurott and Shell Smash Carracosta, appreciate having Zangoose as a wallbreaker, as it can take down their counters for them to successfully sweep.</p>"

        "description": "<p>This set, if used properly, can nearly OHKO the entire tier after a boost. Factoring in Swords Dance, Zangoose hits 658 Attack with a Jolly nature. A +2 Toxic-boosted Facade will OHKO Alomomola and can possibly OHKO Tangela. However, due to its frailty, Zangoose struggles to set up Swords Dance; in the long run, it might not even be worth the hassle to set it up. Close Combat will demolish Rock- and Steel-types, such as Bastiodon, Carracosta, and Gigalith. The fourth move depends on what Pokemon Zangoose wants to defeat. Quick Attack allows Zangoose to bypass faster Pokemon that try to revenge kill it, but it is then walled by Ghost-types. Night Slash permits Zangoose to hit Ghost-types, but it is then checked by faster Pokemon such as Primeape and Charizard.</p> <p>Here are a few calculations to show you how fearsome Zangoose is after a Swords Dance with just a Jolly nature:</p> <ul> <li>+2 Facade vs. 252/252+ Alomomola:97.8% - 115.2%</li> <li>+2 Facade vs. 240/252+ Musharna: 115.9% - 136.7%</li> <li>+2 Quick Attack vs. 0/0 Primeape: 100% - 117.7%</li> <li>+2 Quick Attack vs. 4/0 Gardevoir: 91.7 - 108.3%</li> </ul> <p>A Jolly nature allows Zangoose to Speed tie with Kangaskhan and Jolly Sawk. However, an Adamant nature can be used for more power, and with a Swords Dance boost, Zangoose can OHKO defensive Misdreavus and Tangela with the appropriate move and Stealth Rock support. If you opt to run Quick Attack on Zangoose, a Pursuit trapper such as Skuntank is required, as Zangoose cannot do a thing against Ghost-types. Alternatively, if you choose to run Night Slash, Zangoose is vulnerable to faster Pokemon, particularly common Choice Scarf variants of Primeape and Charizard. Tanks or walls, such as Alomomola, Lickilicky, Golem, and Metang, make good teammates because they can either counter those Pokemon or take a hit and strike back. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Garbodor, Piloswine, Roselia, and Golem are recommended. With just Stealth Rock support, Zangoose's Quick Attack can possibly OHKO threats such as Charizard, Sawsbuck, and Pinsir at +2. Kangaskhan shares a common Fighting-type weakness, but it works well with Zangoose because they share similar checks, which they can both weaken until one of them can break through.</p>"

Its Poison typing is helpful, as it can absorb Toxic Spikes and check weaker attackers such as Serperior and Gurdurr, but any stronger attacks can land a devastating blow, even if resisted. The best chance Seviper has to pull its weight is to make use of its decent attacking stats and coverage in a mixed set.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice item + Switcheroo is a decent option for Seviper, but Pokemon such as Musharna pull it off better with its higher bulk. Giving Seviper Choice Specs also turns it into a powerhouse, but it doesn't enjoy locking itself into its STAB move and it can easily be revenge killed. A Coil set with Poison Jab, Seed Bomb, Earthquake, Crunch, and/or Aqua Tail is doable, but Arbok outclasses it in Speed, bulk, and its access to Gunk Shot. Seviper has access to some nifty support moves, such as Glare, Dragon Tail, Haze, Taunt, and Knock Off, but it has trouble fitting any of those moves into a set. Seviper can set up weather, but it is completely outclassed by Pokemon with better abilities, Speed, and/or reliable recovery. Seviper could use Rest in conjunction with Shed Skin for its own recovery, but most attacks will at least 2HKO it, so there is little chance of it being effective.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Anything faster with a strong attack that does not fear Sucker Punch can eliminate Seviper, such as Sawk, Tauros, Timid Ludicolo, and Charizard, but they all must avoid switching in on a strong attack. Special sponges such as Lickilicky and Audino can take all of Seviper's attacks with little to fear. Musharna can easily KO Seviper with Psychic and will not take too much damage from Sucker Punch. Ground-types that outspeed or take little damage from Giga Drain, such as Camerupt, are great counters as well. Probopass and Bastiodon also take very little from Seviper's attacks and can set up Stealth Rock and/or phaze Seviper out. Entry hazards in general are great at wearing Seviper down, as it has no reliable recovery.</p>",

Flamethrower hits the Steel-types that will switch in on a predicted Sludge Bomb very hard. Giga Drain rounds off Seviper's coverage by nailing Ground-types that resist both Sludge Bomb and Flamethrower, such as Seismitoad and Golem, for 4x damage and also grants Seviper recovery in the process. Sucker Punch is important in the last moveslot because it allows Seviper to damage faster threats.</p> <p>Seviper uses maximum Speed and a Naive nature so it can outspeed Modest Samurott and Modest Ludicolo, which is an important benchmark. Shed Skin is the ability of choice because it makes Seviper reasonably good at switching in status attacks, and as such grants Seviper more Pokemon to switch in on, such as Misdreavus and Tangela. Life Orb is the best item because Seviper needs a high damage output in order to make an impact; it cannot survive many hits anyway, so the residual damage is insignificant. Nevertheless, an Expert Belt can be used instead of a Life Orb, but Seviper's main STAB will rarely receive a boost in this case, owing to Poison's sparse super effective coverage. A cool alternative over Flamethrower is Hidden Power Ground, which turns Seviper into an effective Probopass and Bastiodon lure, since both of them sponge its attacks otherwise. Good defensive partners for Seviper are Musharna and Mandibuzz, which can handle the incoming Ground- and Psychic-type attacks, as well as most of the stronger attacks that tend to break through Seviper. Good offensive partners are stallbreakers, such as Choice Band Sawk and Swords Dance Samurott, which can handle special walls that can take all of Seviper's attacks. Lastly, paralysis support from Pokemon such as Regirock and Rotom-S greatly helps Seviper by allowing it to outspeed and severely damage Pokemon that it wouldn't normally be able to.</p>"

Whiscash is also quite slow—many Pokemon and almost every Choice Scarf user outspeed it even after a Dragon Dance boost—and its Attack is average, meaning it will need a few boosts in order to become a threatening sweeper.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A tank set might seem appealing because of Whiscash's nice bulk and great typing, but such a set would be outclassed by Seismitoad, which has a Water immunity, access to Stealth Rock, and better offensive prowess. However, Whiscash has access to Hydration + Rest, which in conjunction with Rain Dance gives Whiscash reliable recovery and a way to avoid status, something Seismitoad doesn't have. On such a set, Whiscash should be running special attacks such as Earth Power, Ice Beam, and Hydro Pump. Whiscash can also run Ice Beam on physical sets to catch Torterra and Tangela off guard. Aqua Tail can replace Waterfall if you want more power, but the inferior accuracy and lack of flinch chance make it unappealing. Zen Headbutt can be used to hit Weezing, but it's not worth giving up a moveslot for it. Return has great coverage with Waterfall, but Stone Edge and Zen Headbutt are better coverage options. Bounce can be used to hit Grass-type Pokemon super effectively, but the charging turn makes it easy to avoid. Finally, Whiscash can run Toxic to inflict status on its opponents, something that can be useful against an incoming Grass-type Pokemon or Alomomola.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Almost any Grass-type Pokemon can threaten Whiscash, as they can normally take a hit and then OHKO Whiscash with a STAB move. Ludicolo resists Whiscash's STAB moves and can OHKO it using Giga Drain. Torterra and Tangela make great counters due to their bulk and typing, but they must be wary of the rare Ice Beam. Serperior and Exeggutor can also deal with Whiscash without much trouble with good physical bulk and access to Giga Drain; Serperior can even outspeed most +1 Whiscash. Cradily can take a boosted Earthquake well and destroy Whiscash with Giga Drain. Mantine deserves a special mention as a counter if Whiscash only uses its STAB moves, as Water Absorb variants are immune to both of them. Physically defensive Misdreavus doesn't take much damage from Whiscash's attacks and can hit it with a strong Foul Play or burn it with Will-O-Wisp. Misdreavus can even outspeed and Taunt Whiscash if it hasn't set up yet. Gurdurr can set up Bulk Up at the same time Whiscash uses Dragon Dance, and it will always win that war if Whiscash doesn't get a critical hit or multiple flinches. Swellow can switch in on a predicted Earthquake or after a KO and proceed to outspeed and deal massive damage to Whiscash even after a Dragon Dance, making it a nice offensive check. Prankster Encore users, such as Liepard and Volbeat, can switch in on a predicted Dragon Dance or Substitute and force Whiscash out. Toxic Spikes reduces Whiscash's potential considerably as it needs many setup turns to be a threat, so being poisoned significantly reduces the time it has to sweep. Common users of this move include Roselia, Garbodor, and Scolipede.</p> <p>Whiscash's main problem is that, even after a boost, it lacks the power to OHKO or even 2HKO bulky Pokemon, especially if they resist Earthquake, meaning that even if it has managed to set up a Dragon Dance, many Pokemon, such as Musharna and Mandibuzz, while not capable of switching in safely, can come in after a KO and beat Whiscash one-on-one. If you don't allow Whiscash to set up many Dragon Dances, you should do fine against it.</p>",

Earthquake is Whiscash's strongest STAB, and it will deal good damage to most Pokemon that do not resist it. Waterfall complements Earthquake pretty well, providing Whiscash with coverage against most non-Grass-types. It also has a nice flinch rate that Whiscash can take advantage of with Speed boosts from Dragon Dance.</p> <p>The EV spread allows Whiscash to create 101 HP Substitutes and ensures Alomomola's Waterfall never breaks its Substitute. The spread also enables Whiscash to outspeed non-Choice Scarf Jynx, Haunter, and Primeape after a Dragon Dance boost. Whiscash can also run full offensive investment with a Life Orb, a Jolly nature, and Stone Edge over Substitute. However, that set, while stronger, finds setting up much harder, and because it also needs a few boosts to be threatening, it is generally a less reliably way for Whiscash to sweep. This more offensive approach lets Whiscash outspeed Pokemon such as Serperior, Charizard, and Swoobat after a Dragon Dance boost, though, so it's not to be dismissed. Hydration is used as Whiscash's main ability; while it might be situational, it's the least useless of the three abilities Whiscash has access to and is very useful if rain is up. Anticipation would be nice if it warned about Hidden Power Grass, but Hidden Power is always taken to be a Normal-type move and the ability only activates when you send Whiscash out, making it a poor choice.</p> <p>Whiscash has trouble getting past Grass-type Pokemon such as Torterra, Tangela, and Ludicolo, so teammates that can beat those Pokemon are necessary. Scolipede and Roselia make great partners for Whiscash, as they boast a superb 4x resistance to Grass-type moves and can also provide Whiscash with Spikes and Toxic Spikes support, easing its sweep, and opportunities to switch in and set up against Fire-type attacks aimed at them. Garbodor is also a nice teammate, as it resists Grass-type moves and can also reliably set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes. These three Pokemon can also absorb Toxic Spikes, which is incredibly helpful for Whiscash outside of rain. Braviary and Charizard deal with Grass-type Pokemon easily, as they can switch in on a predicted Grass-type move and destroy them with Brave Bird and Fire Blast, respectively. LumRest Exeggutor makes a nice partner for Whiscash as well, as it can beat most Grass-type Pokemon easily and it doesn't fear being put to sleep thanks to Lum Berry and Harvest. Meanwhile, Whiscash can deal with the Fire-type Pokemon that threaten Exeggutor. Specially offensive Water-types are also difficult for Whiscash to deal with, so Regice and Ludicolo make good partners. Ludicolo can also provide Whiscash with rain support, making Waterfall a much stronger move and activating Hydration.</p>"

  "Cradily": {
    "overview": "<p>Cradily sports respectable bulk, a unique typing in NU that allows it to resist Normal-type attacks, and the ability Storm Drain, which grants it an immunity to Water-type attacks. Cradily can be customized to fit the needs of different teams as it can be both physically and specially based, can act as Stealth Rock support, and can function as a setup sweeper. Despite Cradily's versatility and bulk, its weaknesses to common attacking types hinder its usefulness in NU. Furthermore, unlike the rest of its Rock-type brethren, Cradily takes neutral damage from Flying-type attacks, which makes it less appealing to use. Nonetheless, Cradily's unique typing allows it to provide key resistances and act as a glue for a team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stockpile boosts Cradily's defenses even further, but Stockpile Cradily is a sitting duck more often than not. Mirror Coat can provide decent surprise factor and might sometimes catch an opponent off-guard, especially if a Water-type were to use Ice Beam against Cradily. Confuse Ray is another option to consider, although Cradily has better things to be doing than relying on confusion against the opponent. Earthquake can be used to hit Garbodor, Probopass, and Bastiodon for respectable damage, although doing so would require Cradily to sacrifice much more important coverage or utility in the process. Lastly, a Swords Dance set can be considered, but Cradily is too slow to pull it off effectively, especially considering the types of weaknesses that it has. Because of this, Curse is generally a much better option as it also boosts Defense.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Charizard is easily capable of 2HKOing Cradily; however, it must watch out for Rock-type moves, as Rock Slide is very common on Cradily. As such, Charizard should only be used against Cradily when it is weakened enough to be picked off in one hit. Fighting-types such as Sawk, Throh, and Primeape all deal heavy damage to Cradily and resist its Rock-type attacks.</p> <p>Defensively, Poison-types can wall Cradily effectively; Weezing in particular can use Haze against any Curse sets and sports Will-O-Wisp in order to cripple the support set. Garbodor can also wall the support set and lay down entry hazards, but loses out to the mono-attacker set. Grass-types such as Tangela and Exeggutor can wall the support set if it does not run Toxic. Exeggutor is at a stalemate with Cradily if it runs Substitute + Leech Seed, while Lum and Sunny Day variants beat the support set but lose to Curse. Roselia can wall the support Set and lay down Spikes, but it loses to the Curse set. Steel-types such as Klang and Metang are troublesome because they resist both of Cradily's STAB moves, and Bastiodon can wall the support set as well but has to be wary of Curse.</p>",

      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>Cradily's Storm Drain ability allows it to switch into bulky Water-types such as Alomomola, Seismitoad, and Wartortle with relative ease without fearing a Scald burn. In addition, its Rock typing allows it to tank hits from Kangaskhan and Tauros efficiently. As a result, Cradily is a unique Stealth Rock user because it can set up against Water- and Normal-types alike without much fear. Giga Drain is Cradily's primary form of offense, doing considerable damage after a Storm Drain boost, and helps it heal health at a faster pace. Rock Slide is primarily used as a way to beat Flying-types such as Altaria. It can also do decent damage to Bug-types, although Cradily must watch out for Bug-type attacks in return. Toxic can also be considered in this slot if one wishes to forgo coverage for a more stall-oriented strategy, as it is able to poison common switch-ins such as Tangela. Recover allows for Cradily to last longer in battle, providing it much-needed longevity in combination with its resistances and bulk to tank hits from the opponent while acting as a support pivot.</p> <p>To tank hits efficiently from hard hitting physical Normal-types such as Tauros and Kangaskhan, it is usually more effective if Cradily invests in its physical bulk. Hidden Power Fire is an option to consider to take on Steel-types such as Metang and Klang, although they beat Cradily for the most part anyway. A specially based set with a Bold nature and Hidden Power Rock over Rock Slide is also viable if one wishes to take complete advantage of Storm Drain's Special Attack boost. Furthermore, one can also opt to use a completely specially defensive spread in 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD depending on the needs of the team.</p> <p>Cradily is best used alongside a cleric and a Toxic Spikes absorber, as status severely restricts its ability to tank hits and switch in on threats. Lickilicky, Garbodor, and Musharna make great teammates as a result; Musharna in particular has Heal Bell and a much-needed Fighting-type resistance to cover Cradily's weaknesses. Metang is also a good teammate that can be used to help deal with Ice-type attacks. Given Metang's physical bulk, it works best alongside a specially defensive Cradily set; using the two together also enables Cradily to run Toxic over Stealth Rock because Metang is able to use Stealth Rock instead.</p>"
      },
      "Mono-Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Cradily can be used to switch into status afflicting moves such as Toxic and Will-O-Wisp, then set up late-game for sweeps once its counters have been dealt with. RestTalk allows Cradily to switch in multiple times throughout a game as a defensive pivot, and Curse allows it to sweep when the time is right. Using Rock Slide makes Cradily vulnerable to both Fighting- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Throh, Gurdurr, and Golem. On the other hand, Seed Bomb makes Cradily more susceptible to Sap Sipper users such as Zebstrika, as well as Flying- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Tangela, Serperior, Mandibuzz, and Altaria. Steel-types in particular resist both Rock Slide and Seed Bomb, so Pokemon such as Klang and Metang are able to hinder Cradily's ability to sweep late-game if they are still present.</p> <p>Suction Cups is the preferred ability because it prevents phazing, a common strategy used to nullify the effectiveness of setup mono-attackers such as Cradily. Storm Drain may also be considered in tandem with Recover over RestTalk if one wishes to use a Curse set with more coverage and utility but less opportunities to set up. If one chooses to go this route, one must use a cleric in order to heal Cradily of crippling status such as burn and poison.</p> <p>Toxic Spikes support is appreciated for breaking down Pokemon that won't go down to Rock Slide or Seed Bomb; for example, Tangela and Exeggutor won't be able to wall Seed Bomb Cradily effectively with the presence of Toxic Spikes. Garbodor works great with Cradily because it resists both Bug- and Fighting-type moves and can lay down entry hazards with ease. Pokemon that deal with Steel-types such as Seismitoad, Charizard, and Torkoal also make great partners as they can help clear the field for a Cradily sweep. In the same vein, Gothorita is a premier trapper in NU against Fighting-types that would otherwise make it difficult for Cradily to set up and sweep.</p>"

  "Armaldo": {
    "overview": "<p>While Armaldo does possess above average stats, a wide variety of offensive options, and the ever-handy Rapid Spin, it is still a mediocre Pokemon. The biggest problem is that Armaldo requires a lot of support to be used effectively, as it fails to make use of its bulk due to its mediocre typing and cannot spin against the two top Ghost-type Pokemon in the tier—Golurk and Misdreavus—one-on-one. On top of that, Armaldo is too slow to reliably Rapid Spin without being revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Samurott and Sawk. Armaldo does have one redeeming trait however: its ability, Swift Swim. With it, Armaldo is capable of beating most Ghost-types in the tier as well as outspeeding every Pokemon up to Zebstrika, all while still dealing good damage to most Pokemon in this offensive-inclined metagame. Despite its mediocrity, Armaldo can be put to good use on dedicated rain teams. On weatherless teams, however, Mold Breaker Sawk and Taunt leads such as Samurott and Misdreavus are much better at preventing hazards from going up on your side of the field.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Any other choices for Armaldo are either terrible or severely outclassed. That said, if you insist on seeing this for yourself, there are a few select alternatives that you can make use of. If you're not using Armaldo in the rain for some odd reason, Battle Armor is the ability of choice. A physically defensive set with Stealth Rock / Rock Blast / Rapid Spin / Toxic or Knock Off might seem good on paper, but in reality, it fails to wall a good amount of prominent threats in NU, as Armaldo's typing is mediocre at best. X-Scissor is not recommended as Armaldo has trouble finding space for it, and the extra coverage is not that useful most of the time. It's quite sad that Armaldo learns Sunny Day but not Rain Dance, as it doesn't benefit from the sun at all. One thing that is useful to an extent is Rock Polish, which enables Armaldo's Speed to be boosted without rain. Armaldo also has access to other boosting moves such as Hone Claws and Curse, but most of the time, you're better off just attacking as these boosting moves aren't worth your while.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Offensive Water-type Pokemon, such as Samurott and Carracosta, can kill Armaldo with their STAB attacks. Metang and Seismitoad can take any hit from Armaldo and deal serious damage with their STAB moves. Tangela and Alomomola laugh at all of Armaldo's attempts at getting past them, as they can put it to sleep or hit it with a super effective attack, respectively; however, as Armaldo should be used on rain teams, it will have teammates that will likely get past that problem. Carracosta and Weezing can handle Armaldo well, but they should be wary after Armaldo gains a boost or two. While Armaldo can support a team by removing entry hazards, it has problems with them as Armaldo is weak to all of those entry hazards. Strong special attacks also hurt Armaldo greatly, but it does have enough bulk to take most neutral hits when at full health. Even with Rain up, Armaldo is still very slow and is outsped by common Choice Scarf users such as Primeape, Rotom-A, and Charizard, which can take down Armaldo at low health.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swift Swim": {
        "description": "<p>This set should only be used on rain teams, where it can take on Regice and Kangaskhan, Pokemon that most rain teams have trouble with. Furthermore, Armaldo can now beat all Ghost-type Pokemon while also having a shot at pulling off a sweep once it nabs a boost. If you aren't using a rain team, you're better off with other Rapid Spin users such as Wartortle and Torkoal. Swords Dance boosts Armaldo's Attack stat to monstrous levels, turning it from an average Pokemon to a deadly sweeper in one turn if given the opportunity. Rock Blast provides a decent STAB move that can dent a bunch of Pokemon for good damage, and also gives Armaldo the ability to break through Substitutes and Focus Sashes; Lum Berry is the preferred item in this case as the utility that it provides comes in handy should Armaldo get crippled by status conditions such as Misdreavus's Will-O-Wisp. Stone Edge can also be used if you want a more consistent STAB move; however, it should only be used with Life Orb which allows Armaldo to hit hard and OHKO Misdreavus at +2. Aqua Tail in the rain acts like a pseudo-STAB move; it also has near-perfect coverage alongside Armaldo's Rock-type STAB and maims Golurk in the rain. Rapid Spin can remove hazards, such as Toxic Spikes and Stealth Rock, that are troublesome to rain sweepers.</p> <p>Jolly can be used if you want Armaldo to outspeed Swellow under rain, but the extra Speed does not make up for the lower damage output most of the time. Rock Slide is a decent option for a STAB move, but it is less powerful than Stone Edge and has less utility compared to Rock Blast. Preferred teammates for Armaldo are those that can set up rain and benefit from it. Volbeat and Gardevoir are good utility rain-inducers, while Pokemon such as Seismitoad and Ludicolo can also set up rain while benefiting from it as well. Practically anything that beats dedicated physical walls is of great help to Armaldo; Eelektross, Swanna, Misdreavus, and Mantine can all assist Armaldo greatly.</p>"

  "Banette": {
    "overview": "<p>Banette is a very unfortunate case. While its offensive stats are very solid, it suffers from the fact that it is simply too frail and slow to make any use of said stats the majority of the time. Its movepool doesn't help its case either, since it is fairly dry on offensive options, further limiting any offensive potential it might have had. Banette does have one small niche, however, as a suicidal Trick Room lead. It can set up Trick Room for its team while taking itself down in the process; therefore, don't expect too much out of Banette otherwise.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>As previously stated, Banette has quite a miserable movepool, which means there isn't much for it to put to good use. It has some useful priority attacks in Sucker Punch and Shadow Sneak, but its lack of STAB on the former makes Banette a mediocre user of it. Choice Band and Choice Specs are certainly possibilities, but it is outclassed by Golurk and Sawk as Choice Band users, with Trick being its one and only niche over them. It can also support its team with Sunny Day or Rain Dance, and has Thunder to take advantage of the latter, but this role is better left to other Pokemon such as Regirock and Ludicolo. Banette also has some support options in Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, Disable, Toxic, Pain Split, Calm Mind, and Cotton Guard. Unfortunately, Banette's bulk is too disappointing put any of these moves to good use.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Kangaskhan can utilize Scrappy along with a combination of Fake Out and Double-Edge to ensure Banette accomplishes nothing. Taunt users such as Mandibuzz, Samurott, and Serperior are also useful to stop Banette from doing its job, especially if it lacks Shadow Claw in favor of Curse. Skuntank can also do this, and can also use Pursuit to break the Focus Sash. Marowak, Golem, and Piloswine can use multi-hit moves to break Banette's Focus Sash and potentially eliminate it from the match. It is noteworthy that it is usually the slow powerhouses under Trick Room that pose the legitimate threat; Banette itself is not extraordinarily threatening.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Suicide Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>This is Banette's best and only way to effectively contribute to its team. This set should always take the lead position, as it should very rarely stay around for long. Its main role is to support slower team members with Trick Room, hopefully taking down an opponent in the process. Its middling defenses and Speed are also key to this set's success. Taunt is an effective tool to stop the opponent's setup opportunities, especially from the likes of Swords Dance Samurott and Carracosta. Shadow Claw provides a reasonably strong STAB attack for Banette to use, and prevents it from being complete Taunt bait. Curse, on the other hand, is useful against any Pokemon that refuses to outright defeat Banette after it has done its job; aside from wearing down an opponent for your sweepers to sweep better, it will quickly guarantee Banette's demise. Finally, Destiny Bond is useful for Banette to potentially take down an opponent after it has done its job.</p> <p>The EV spread, IVs, and nature minimize Banette's already upsetting defenses and Speed to allow it to reach its Focus Sash more easily and outspeed plenty of opponents under Trick Room. Focus Sash is necessary in order for Banette to set up Trick Room successfully, as Banette is a frail Pokemon in general. Insomnia is the preferred ability, as it allows Banette to ignore sleep moves from the likes of Jumpluff and hence set up Trick Room on it. Because Banette is running Trick Room, it is necessary to pair it up with slow and powerful Pokemon, such as Marowak, Relicanth, Eelektross, and Golurk. Other Trick Room users, such as Exeggutor and Musharna, are also advisable to put less pressure on Banette for its role.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Tropius doesn't fit in very well in NU. On one hand, Tropius's typing and bulk allows it to check threats such as Sawk, Golurk, and Swords Dance Samurott. In addition, Tropius's movepool is gigantic, and it has access to three good abilities. On the other hand, Tropius's typing leaves it vulnerable to most special attackers in NU, and its Speed is rather lackluster, which hinders any chances to go strictly offensive or defensive. The best bet Tropius has to fit on a team is to take advantage of Harvest, Leech Seed, and its Flying typing, turning it into a decent SubSeed user. Still, Tropius faces competition from Exeggutor, which wields similar bulk and higher Special Attack.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tropius has access to Roost, for even more recovery, and Whirlwind, for phazing. The LumRest combination is viable as well, allowing Tropius to fight status, which really hinders its performance in battle. Tropius has access to boosting moves such as Curse, Swords Dance, and Dragon Dance as well as offensive moves such as Leaf Blade, Aerial Ace, Nature Power, Bullet Seed, and Body Slam, but sweepers with higher Attack stats are more viable. Tropius can attempt to sweep in the sun with Chlorophyll or Solar Power, but it is outclassed by Victreebel, Sawsbuck, and Charizard in that regard. Tropius can also set sun, but Pokemon with better typings and abilities are more suited for the job.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Miltank absorbs Leech Seed with Sap Sipper, takes little damage from Air Slash, and can remove poison with Heal Bell. Duosion also avoids damage from Leech Seed and Toxic and can set up Calm Minds to minimize Air Slash damage. Pokemon with reliable recovery that take little damage from Air Slash can handle Tropius as well. RestTalk users can even beat Tropius with Toxic. Taunt users, such as Mandibuzz and Misdreavus, shut Tropius down. Status really hinders Tropius's performance in battle as well, so any faster Pokemon can cripple Tropius before it uses Substitute. Stealth Rock limits the amount of times Tropius can switch in, and setters such as Golem also wield Rock Blast, which can break through Tropius's Substitutes. Lastly, any special attacker with super effective coverage, such as Simisear or Charizard, can easily break through Tropius's Substitutes and force it out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "SubSeed": {
        "description": "<p>With this set, Tropius supports its team with Leech Seed, spreading recovery to teammates whilst forcing switches. With Substitute, Tropius can wall many Pokemon by repeatedly using Substitute until Leech Seed KOes the opponent. This is possible because Harvest grants Tropius extra recovery through multiple Sitrus Berries. In addition, one of the greatest reasons to use Tropius over other SubSeed users is its Flying typing, which allows Tropius to threaten most Grass-type Pokemon attempting to switch in and absorb Leech Seed with a STAB Air Slash. Protect is an option so Tropius can stall longer and gain more chances to regain Sitrus Berries. However, Toxic can be used to dispose of the opponent more quickly.</p> <p>The 116 Speed EVs allow Tropius to outspeed Alomomola and Tangela before they can use a crippling status move. Tropius can use its good bulk in a specially defensive set similar to this one, walling threats such as Gardevoir and Musharna. However, Tropius's weaknesses to Fire- and Ice-type moves really hinder its ability to wall special attackers. Metang is a good partner for Tropius because it can take all of the Poison-, Ice-, Flying-, and Rock-type attacks aimed at Tropius as well as gaining valuable recovery from Leech Seed. Water-types such as Samurott and Seismitoad cover Tropius's Fire- and Ice-type weaknesses and appreciate the recovery as well. Entry hazard support is also very important to Tropius because of the many switches it forces. Toxic Spikes support from Roselia or Garbodor is the most crucial because it limits the amount of times a Pokemon can stay in on Tropius, allowing it to safely use Substitute more often. Lastly, good offensive partners for Tropius are Braviary, Charizard, and Swellow, which can eliminate the Grass-types that tend to annoy Tropius.</p>"

However, it does have a niche, and that is being a decent suicide lead. With Taunt, Spikes, and Explosion, Glalie can often set up several layers of Spikes while preventing opposing entry hazards and is often useful for offensive teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Icy Wind is an option to slow down faster leads and switch-ins before using Explosion. Earthquake can be used to catch the likes of Probopass and Bastiodon by surprise. Glalie can use Rain Dance and act as a rain setter which can also set up Spikes and give free switches to teammates with Explosion. Super Fang can be used to deal a huge chunk of damage to things that lack reliable recovery, such as Probopass and Regirock, and help weaken walls for offensive teams to take advantage of. Toxic can be used to cripple some walls like Regirock and Alomomola. Body Slam can be used to help spread paralysis for the team, although Glalie is better off setting up Spikes, Exploding, and letting its teammates do the rest of the work. A Normal Gem can be used to beef up the power of Explosion, but without Focus Sash, Glalie is no longer guaranteed two layers of Spikes against slower targets. Disable might be a neat option, but since it is illegal with Spikes, it should never be used. Crunch can be used to hit Ghost-types coming in to block Explosion, although many of them can be beaten through other means anyway. A fully offensive set can be used; however, it is mostly outclassed by Piloswine and Beartic, and it is best for Glalie to stick to its own niche of setting up Spikes instead.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bastiodon and Probopass are two of the best counters to Glalie, as they can bounce back both Spikes and Taunt with Magic Coat, take little damage from its attacks, and can set up Stealth Rock against it. Carracosta and Gurdurr are bulky enough to tank hits and can either set up on Glalie or KO it with a combination of a powerful STAB move and priority. Golem and Armaldo can KO Glalie through its Focus Sash, although Golem finds a little trouble switching in. Generally, most opponents that are faster than Glalie can either limit it to one layer of Spikes or force it to use Explosion early.

Explosion allows Glalie to go out with a bang after laying down Spikes and can hurt many frail opponents. Glalie also outspeeds all of the spinners in NU, and with Explosion, it can kill itself and prevent the opponent from using Rapid Spin, thus preserving its Spikes for another turn. Ice Beam is capable of 2HKOing Golem and Golurk, though most of the time, Glalie would rather be setting up Spikes.</p> <p>Ice Fang and Avalanche are alternatives to Ice Beam that allow Glalie to nab a 2HKO against Roselia, but they actually fail to 2HKO Golem, which is more common. Ice Shard is another option, as it is a priority move that allows Glalie to grab some small damage and gives it a chance to OHKO Jumpluff before it uses Sleep Powder.</p> <p>Because Glalie gives its team such great Spikes support, teammates that can take advantage of Spikes are appreciated. For example, Charizard, Swellow, and Primeape love Spikes support to nab extra KOs and force switches. They also prefer to have their side clear of entry hazards and can take advantage of the free switch provided by Explosion. Like with any suicide lead, spinblockers are good teammates as they can keep the Spikes up after Glalie has fainted. Golurk and Misdreavus are effective spinblockers, and the latter even enjoys Spikes being up on the opponent's side of the field. Because Rock-type opponents, such as Golem and Armaldo, often threaten Glalie, teammates that can set up on or threaten them are appreciated. Gorebyss and Samurott can easily set up on Rock-types and also benefit from Spikes to score additional kills.</p>"

Roar is another move Walrein has over its competitors, and its good Special Attack means it can still hit decently hard. A Water typing helps Walrein to take on Water- and Steel-types better than Regice, allowing Walrein to function as a decent tank that is difficult to OHKO. Walrein's lack of recovery, however, limits its effectiveness as a tank.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Life Orb or Choice Specs set is possible, as Walrein's Special Attack and type coverage is pretty decent. A physical Curse set can be used to take advantage of Walrein's great bulk, but Walrein's weaknesses to common types such as Fighting and Grass make it unable to set up safely. Finally, manual hail can be used to utilize the unbreakable Stallrein strategy, but five turns isn't nearly enough to properly execute said strategy.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Walrein is worn down easily by entry hazards—Stealth Rock takes out a chunk of its health, and it gets worn down by Spikes very quickly as well. Due to its multiple common weaknesses, it is easy to force Walrein out, thus racking up the hazard damage that Walrein takes. Grass-types can only check Walrein because they don't want to switch directly into Ice Beam, but they can easily 2HKO Walrein, meaning that they almost always win against it one-on-one. Most Electric- and Fighting-types with decent offensive presence, such as Electabuzz, Ampharos, Sawk and Gurdurr, can easily force Walrein out as well. Ludicolo is especially threatening to Walrein, since it's only hit neutrally by Ice Beam, can heal itself back with Giga Drain, and only really fears Toxic. Clerics, including, but not limited to, Audino and Musharna, and RestTalk users, can easily cleanse themselves of Toxic poison and stall Walrein out. Steel-types are in a similar vein, with opponents such as Metang being immune to Toxic and resisting Ice Beam, while retaliating with a painful Meteor Mash. Finally, Taunt users, particularly Mandibuzz and Misdreavus, can temporarily halt Walrein's usage of support moves and can also cripple Walrein with Will-O-Wisp or Toxic, respectively.</p>",

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Thick Fat gives Walrein helpful resistances to Fire- and Ice-type moves, which combined with its great bulk allows it to easily take Water-, Ice-, and Fire-type attacks from the likes of Samurott, Simipour, and Charizard, respectively. Toxic is an essential move for Walrein, as it wears down the opponent over the course of the match. Ice Beam is its STAB move of choice and lets it hit Flying-, Grass-, and Ground-type opponents for super effective damage. Surf is Walrein's method of disposing of Charizard immediately, and is its only way of doing any real damage to Steel-types that shrug off an Ice Beam with ease and are immune to Toxic. Surf also helps with other Fire-types, such as Torkoal and Camerupt, and does more damage to the likes of Armaldo. Roar and Encore are both options for disrupting setup sweepers; while Roar is the safer move, allowing Walrein to phaze and rack up hazard damage, Encore can lock the opponent into disadvantageous moves, such as a stat-boosting move or Substitute, and thus lets a teammate set up on said threat. Walrein is hampered by its lack of access to reliable recovery and the lack of permanent hail in Neverused, which is a letdown considering its great bulk. Protect somewhat mitigates this by letting Walrein get extra Leftovers recovery and rack up Toxic damage.</p> <p>A specially defensive spread allows Walrein to take on Charizard and special Samurott. However, you can opt to use a physically defensive set, which boasts the ability to take on Swords Dance Samurott and most Ground-types with ease. Super Fang is a viable move which can halve the opponent's health and cripples the Pokemon that can normally handle this set, such as Regice and Metang. However, since Walrein can actually deal decent damage thanks to its base 95 Special Attack, it is usually not necessary.</p> <p>Entry hazard support is great to take advantage of Walrein's stalling ability and to use in conjunction with Roar. Great teammates for Walrein include those that can set up both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, such as Roselia and Garbodor. In addition, they resist the Grass- and Fighting-type attacks that Walrein dislikes and can set up entry hazards against them. Meanwhile, Walrein can deal with the Ground- and Rock-types that these entry hazard setters loathe by forcing them out due to the threat of Surf. Rapid Spin support is nice to have for Walrein, as Walrein's weakness to Stealth Rock hurts its ability to take on various Pokemon, such as Charizard. Pokemon such as Sawk, Torterra, and Serperior are great partners and can also easily prevent Stealth Rock. Torkoal is the best Rapid Spin user for Walrein's team to use, as not only can it set up Stealth Rock, but it also takes Grass-type attacks for Walrein. Additionally, Torkoal can act as a physically defensive tank while Walrein acts as a specially defensive tank, making the combination of these two Pokemon a solid core. Ground-types such as Golem pair well with Walrein, as they are immune to Electric and can take Rock-type attacks for Walrein, while Walrein can take Water- and Ice-type attacks for them. Exeggutor is also a great teammate for Walrein; it can take the Fighting- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Walrein, while Walrein can check pesky Fire- and Flying-types for Exeggutor.</p>"

  "Huntail": {
    "overview": "<p>Huntail is a prime example of a Pokemon with stolen potential; while it has one of the best boosting moves in the game, Shell Smash, it faces heavy competition as a Shell Smash user from the likes of Gorebyss and Carracosta, and simply struggles to find a niche. Its bulk is inferior to that of Carracosta, and it does not have the useful Solid Rock ability, which makes it harder to set up. Huntail also does not pack as much power as Gorebyss, as it relies on a weaker STAB move than the latter does. That said, Huntail does have a few things going for it. Shell Smash is nonetheless a great move, and after a boost, Huntail is still a legitimate threat to contend with. Huntail also has higher Speed than Carracosta, which means it can outspeed Pokemon such as Swellow at +2. Huntail can also go mixed, allowing it to lure the likes of Tangela and still pull off a sweep. Overall, always consider your other options before using Huntail, but don't discount it completely.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Huntail's small movepool means there isn't much else going for it. It has some special moves such as Hydro Pump, Surf, and Hidden Power to use off of its decent Special Attack, but Gorebyss is significantly better as a pure special sweeper. Ice Fang could be used to handle Grass-types, but it is a very weak move in general. Sucker Punch is a useful priority move to nail faster targets, but it is illegal with Shell Smash. Huntail also has Baton Pass, but sadly, it can't be used alongside Shell Smash in NU. Huntail does have Barrier and Aqua Ring to use with Baton Pass, but they are very situational moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>There aren't many complete counters to Huntail; however, there are plenty of checks. Alomomola is the greatest counter to Huntail, due to its ability to take repeated hits and stall with Toxic, Wish, and Protect, but it is massive setup fodder due to its lack of offensive presence. Seismitoad is also capable of taking hits from Huntail and can even recovery off Waterfall thanks to Water Absorb. Priority users, such as Kangaskhan and Skuntank, can revenge kill Huntail after a Shell Smash boost. Huntail is not extraordinarily fast even after a Shell Smash boost, so Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Rotom-S can still revenge kill it quite easily. Electric-types such as Electabuzz can make quick work of Huntail before it grabs a Shell Smash boost, but they can be beaten after a boost. Finally, if all else fails, paralysis from Pokemon such as Regirock can cripple Huntail and cut its sweep short.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<p>This is Huntail's best way to pose a threat as well as to stand out from its competition in Gorebyss and Carracosta. With its usable offensive stats and good enough Speed to use Shell Smash with, Huntail is a capable mixed sweeper in NU. Shell Smash is chosen to make Huntail fast and powerful and hence give it a chance to sweep. Waterfall is a strong and reliable STAB for Huntail to use, and the flinch chance can also come in handy. Return provides great overall coverage with Waterfall; although it doesn't hit anything super effectively, it can handle most Pokemon that resist Waterfall, such as Jynx and Samurott. Finally, Ice Beam serves as a usable coverage move to handle Tangela and other Grass-types.</p> <p>A Naive nature is chosen to enhance Huntail's middling Speed without lowering its Special Attack. Water Veil is a great ability to avoid burns from Misdreavus and Weezing that could potentially stop Huntail from sweeping. A White Herb is chosen to avoid the Defense drops from Shell Smash so that Huntail can still make use of its decent bulk. Swift Swim can be useful to give Huntail greater Speed in rain to make sweeping easier, but it has little utility otherwise. A Life Orb can be used to allow Huntail to hit harder, but the decrease in bulk hurts Huntail's performance, given its usable defenses and the ubiquity priority attacks are in NU.</p> <p>Huntail appreciates entry hazard support for it to sweep; Scolipede and Roselia are great teammates to provide this, and they also handle opposing Grass-types such as Exeggutor. Jynx is also a great teammate for Huntail, as it dismantles Grass- and Dragon-types while Huntail can handle opposing Fire-types. Eelektross and Exeggutor are both great to handle Alomomola, one of Huntail's best counters. The former can effectively Volt Switch into Huntail, which is helpful as it is not very easy for Huntail to switch directly into battle, while the latter can maim Seismitoad.</p>"

  "Gorebyss": {
    "overview": "<p>Gorebyss's access to Shell Smash makes it a very dangerous setup sweeper that can do well against offensive and defensive teams alike. However, while it is powerful, it faces competition from another Shell Smash user, Carracosta, which has a priority move and can set up relatively easily due to its decent bulk and typing. Gorebyss, on the other hand, has trouble finding setup opportunities, especially against offensive teams, because most powerful neutral attacks do a lot of damage to it. Gorebyss also suffers from a slight case of four-moveslot syndrome; while its coverage is decent, it cannot cover every defensive threat at the same time. Gorebyss's low Speed leaves it extremely vulnerable to revenge killing even after a boost because almost every common Choice Scarf user can outspeed and OHKO it, even at +2. Even after Choice Scarf users are removed, Gorebyss still has to watch out for priority users, which can take it out easily after its defenses are lowered by Shell Smash. The large amount of team support required for it to sweep is something that needs to be considered when building around Gorebyss.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gorebyss has access to Baton Pass along with many potential boosting moves to pass to teammates, including Amnesia, Iron Defense, Agility, and Aqua Ring, making it a great option on full Baton Pass teams. However, do note that the combination of Shell Smash and Baton Pass is banned in NU. Toxic can be used to catch special walls by surprise and wear them down, but it is hard to fit onto Gorebyss's moveset, and Gorebyss is generally better off using attacking moves. Hydration, Rain Dance, and Rest could be used, but this is a waste of Gorebyss's potential, especially as its defenses are decent at best. Gorebyss could make use of Rain Dance and Shell Smash for a powerful and fast sweep, but it would be more efficient if its teammates were to set up rain for it, and boosting with Shell Smash twice is still more beneficial. Finally, Hidden Power Electric could be run in the last slot to destroy unsuspecting Mantine, but this option is rather situational.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Mantine is the ultimate counter, as it does not mind any of Gorebyss's common moves, can wear Gorebyss down with Air Slash, and constantly heals itself with Rest. Regice and Lickilicky are bulky enough to tank any one hit and retaliate with Thunderbolt or Body Slam, respectively. Specially defensive Ludicolo and Roselia can switch into Surf and hit back with Giga Drain, but they risk getting OHKOed with the appropriate coverage move with entry hazard support. Choice Scarf users, such as Rotom-A, Jynx, and Primeape, can easily revenge kill Gorebyss, even at +2 Speed. Kangaskhan can utilize two forms of priority moves in Fake Out and Sucker Punch to do the same. However, be mindful that all these revenge killing attempts are stopped cold if Gorebyss has an intact Substitute. Kangaskhan can also be beaten if Gorebyss sets up a Substitute against a Sucker Punch. The best way to defeat Gorebyss is to keep hammering at it before it sets up because this will either severely dent it or prevent it from successfully setting up a Substitute, which makes revenge killing much easier. Variants without Lum Berry also dislike Toxic Spikes, which shortens its sweep, so Roselia and Scolipede are great Pokemon to have when facing it, as they can set up Toxic Spikes and at the same time discourage Gorebyss from switching in and setting up due to their ability to OHKO it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<p>Shell Smash allows Gorebyss to become a fearsome sweeper and to clean up easily once opposing revenge killers are defeated. Surf provides a powerful yet reliable option for sweeping through the opponent's team. Signal Beam hits Grass-types such as Ludicolo and Exeggutor, which otherwise wall Gorebyss. For the last moveslot, Substitute is generally preferred, as it allows Gorebyss to set up in front of walls such as Torkoal, Alomomola, and Metang by shielding it from status. Substitute is also very helpful when the opponent's revenge killer is still alive in order to protect Gorebyss from opposing priority and Choice Scarf users. Ice Beam is an alternative, and while it does not provide insurance against revenge killers, it does allow Gorebyss to take down Roselia, Altaria, and Vileplume if its teammates are unable to do so. However if you go this route, be sure to defeat opposing Choice Scarf users first before attempting a sweep.</p> <p>A Timid nature allows Gorebyss to outspeed everything up to base 85 Speed Choice Scarf users at +2 Speed, including Choice Scarf Sawk and Gardevoir. It also allows Gorebyss to outspeed utility Misdreavus when unboosted, which lets it use Shell Smash or Substitute before being Taunted or burned by Will-O-Wisp, respectively. A Modest nature can be used for more cleaning power, but outspeeding Misdreavus is usually preferred. Hydro Pump can be used for added wallbreaking power, as it can OHKO defensive threats such as Audino, but the loss in accuracy is not worth it, as an untimely miss would end a potential sweep due to Gorebyss's frailty at -1 defenses. The item choice corresponds with the move chosen in the fourth slot. Life Orb should be used with Substitute, as together they guarantee power and safety, and the added residual damage should not matter too much because Gorebyss should ideally only need to use Substitute once. You could also opt to use Leftovers for more opportunities to set up a Substitute, but Life Orb helps Gorebyss nab some important KOs. For example, it needs the additional power to OHKO SubBU Braviary at +2 after Stealth Rock damage. Lum Berry should be used with Ice Beam, as it guarantees protection against status alongside Ice Beam's superior coverage. It also allows Gorebyss to switch into Toxic Spikes fearlessly once.</p> <p>Swellow and Braviary are decent partners, as they are both capable of taking down troublesome special walls with relative ease. They can also lure in Rock-types and U-turn into Gorebyss, allowing it to set up by threatening an OHKO. Entry hazard support is also crucial for Gorebyss to attain important KOs. For example, Life Orb Gorebyss needs Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes to OHKO specially defensive Ludicolo with Signal Beam, and Gorebyss without a boosting item needs Stealth Rock to guarantee a 2HKO against Lickilicky. Scolipede and Golem are good examples of offensive teammates that can set up entry hazards. Teammates that hit hard physically are also appreciated. For example, Primeape and Pinsir are able to break down the special walls that stop Gorebyss and lure in physical walls such as Alomomola for Gorebyss to set up on. Encore or Memento support is appreciated, as it grants Gorebyss additional setup opportunities. Liepard and Muk can provide this support effectively. Dual screens support is very helpful for Gorebyss, as the added survivability allows it to set up more effectively and survive a few hits from weak priority moves and revenge killers. Teammates that can provide dual screens support include Serperior, Gardevoir, and Ampharos. Gardevoir in particular can also provide Memento support and even Safeguard support for variants without Lum Berry while also setting up dual screens. Gorebyss's sweep can be cut short by Toxic Spikes, as the residual damage from Substitute, Life Orb, and poison greatly reduces Gorebyss's longevity. Grounded Poison-type teammates, such as the previously mentioned Scolipede and Muk, can remove these Toxic Spikes. Skuntank is also a useful teammate, as it can absorb Toxic Spikes, defeat Jynx, and Pursuit Roselia for major damage, which all give Gorebyss an easier time sweeping later on.</p>"

  "Relicanth": {
    "overview": "<p>Relicanth is a Pokemon that struggles to find its place in NU, as it faces major competition from the likes of Carracosta in both offensive and defensive roles. Its great physical bulk is somewhat offset by its low Speed and Special Defense, as well as weaknesses to some of the most common offensive types in the tier. However, Relicanth does have access to an extremely powerful STAB move in Head Smash, as well as the ability Rock Head, which gives Relicanth a niche in the tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Relicanth doesn't really have a lot of options outside of those listed. A Rock Polish set could be used, but unfortunately, Relicanth fails to outspeed even base 95 Speed Choice Scarf users after a boost. A Swift Swim set could be used on a rain team, but it loses the ability spam recoil-free Head Smash, and still falls short of the key 95 base Speed Choice Scarf users that dominate NU.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Nothing in the tier likes to switch into Choice Band Relicanth, but Gurdurr can switch into anything bar Zen Headbutt and heal off the damage with Drain Punch. Defensive Seismitoad can switch into Relicanth once and finish it off with Earth Power. The easiest way to deal with Relicanth is to revenge kill it with faster special attackers; Rotom-S, Rotom-F, Samurott, and Serperior are all good options for this. Sawk and Primeape can also come in after Relicanth kills something and force it out with their Fighting-type STABs. Torterra also deserves a special mention, as offensive variants can switch in once and kill it with Wood Hammer. Due to the fact that Relicanth is vulnerable to every entry hazard and has no reliable recovery, it is easily worn down if you keep putting offensive pressure on it.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Thanks to Head Smash and the ability Rock Head, Choice Band Relicanth is a great wallbreaker, even 2HKOing Alomomola with Head Smash. Waterfall is advised as an additional STAB move, and has pretty good coverage in conjunction with Head Smash. Earthquake allows Relicanth to beat Steel-types looking to switch in and absorb a Head Smash, while Double Edge provides additional neutral coverage, and is Relicanth's best move with which to hit Seismitoad.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is chosen so Relicanth can hit as hard as possible, allowing Relicanth to 2HKO Alomomola and Tangela most of the time after Stealth Rock. Rock Head allows Relicanth to spam its most powerful STAB, Head Smash, without taking massive amounts of recoil damage. Zen Headbutt and Toxic can be used in the last slot over Double Edge, as Zen Headbutt allows Relicanth to beat Gurdurr, while Toxic can be used for switch-ins that Relicanth struggles to beat such as Torterra or Seismitoad. An alternative EV spread of 176 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe can be used to give Relicanth more bulk while still outspeeding minimum Speed Alomomola, but the extra Speed investment is generally more useful. Relicanth should be used with Pokemon that appreciate its ability to lure in and break physical walls, such as Braviary or Primeape, who can easily clean a weakened team. Relicanth also appreciates teammates that can switch into Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon and beat them reliably, such as Charizard and Torterra, respectively.</p>"

        "description": "<p>This set aims to take advantage of Relicanth's monstrous Defense stat and set up Stealth Rock reliably.

Waterfall and Earthquake both have decent coverage with Head Smash, but Waterfall is preferred as it gets the STAB bonus. Yawn is also an option in the last slot, as it can force out a dangerous switch in and rack up hazard damage.</p> <p>Even though this is a defensive set, Rock Head is chosen as the ability because it allows Relicanth to utilize its most powerful STAB move. The EV spread allows Relicanth to outspeed min Speed Alomomola, and hit it with Toxic before it can do anything. If you are concerned about not hitting hard enough, an EV spread of 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe could be used with an Adamant nature, but you lose some ability to tank hits. Relicanth really appreciates teammates that can set up Spikes to punish the switches it forces, while also being able to absorb special moves. Roselia deserves special mention, as it forms a great defensive backbone with Relicanth, setting up Spikes and absorbing special Electric- and Grass-type moves. Ludicolo is another good teammate for Relicanth, as it can take Ground-type moves, as well as special Electric-, Grass-, and Fighting-type moves for Relicanth.</p>"

  "Shelgon": {
    "overview": "<p>Shelgon's excellent physical bulk and decent Attack stat allow it to separate itself from other Dragon-types, such as Fraxure and Dragonair. With its good bulk, Shelgon is a decent switch-in to many powerful physical attackers, such as Sawk, Swellow, and Scolipede. With Dragon Dance, Shelgon can set up on many walls and is tough to take down after several boosts, as it takes little damage from priority moves. It can also become a physical wall, utilizing its amazing Defense stat. However, Shelgon has a terrible Special Defense stat as well as poor Speed, leaving it outsped by fast special attackers, even after several turns of setup, most notably by the common Jynx.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An offensive Dragon Dance set is possible, as Shelgon can outspeed base 95 Speed Pokemon after a boost with maximum Speed investment, but this set faces stiff competition from Fraxure and cannot set up as effectively without defensive EVs. The Dragon Dance set can run Brick Break to beat Bastiodon, but because it's hard to find a spare moveslot, it is generally better to rely on team support to do so, especially because Bastiodon is not very common. Toxic can also be used on the Dragon Dance set to wear down Alomomola and Tangela, but once again, it is better to rely on Toxic Spikes support, as Shelgon really struggles to fit Toxic into its moveset. DragonBreath can help the team by spreading paralysis, but it lacks power for the Dragon Dance set and clashes with Toxic for the physical wall set. In addition, it works off Shelgon's weak Special Attack stat. Otherwise, Shelgon does not have many other options because its sets are very inflexible and its movepool is not very large.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Bastiodon is a great counter to both sets, as it completely walls the defensive set and it can phaze the Dragon Dance set if Shelgon isn't the last Pokemon remaining. Probopass and Metang can beat the defensive set with Flash Cannon and Toxic, respectively. However, the Dragon Dance variant can set up on them. Klang can set up on Shelgon and eventually KO it with Gear Grind before it can do the same. Most special attackers can also beat Shelgon, especially those carrying an Ice-type move. However, they might face some trouble switching in against the Dragon Dance set. Regice and Piloswine can tank unboosted Outrages with their good bulk and KO Shelgon with their Ice-type attacks. Charizard and Jynx are fast special attackers that easily destroy Shelgon if they get in safely, and they can even outspeed Shelgon at +2. The physical wall set hates Toxic, as it has no way of healing it bar cleric support from its teammates. Therefore, Toxic Spikes are a very good way to wear down Shelgon. Shelgon also hates losing its Eviolite, as it can no longer take hits easily. Thus, using Trick or Knock Off to remove it is a good way to cripple Shelgon.</p>",

Dragon Dance Shelgon is also an extremely effective late-game sweeper, especially if it is the last Pokemon alive, as it can no longer be phazed out.</p> <p>Dragon Dance boosts Shelgon's Attack and Speed, potentially allowing Shelgon to sweep. Outrage is Shelgon's STAB move and hits hard after several boosts. Furthermore, the locking-in effect of Outrage does not occur if selected by Sleep Talk. Rest allows Shelgon to absorb status and set up as much as it likes, especially in the face of walls, before healing off all the damage. Sleep Talk prevents Shelgon from being a sitting duck during its sleep and allows it to grab more boosts or hit something hard with Outrage.</p> <p>The HP and Defense EVs on the spread help Shelgon to avoid the 2HKO from Jolly Choice Band Sawk's Close Combat, and the rest are thrown into Attack to slightly power Shelgon up. An alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 164 Def / 92 Spe allows Shelgon to outpace base 95 Speed Pokemon at +2, but it loses out on a lot of bulk and, ultimately, setup opportunities. Do note that this alternative spread can outspeed Jynx, who otherwise troubles Shelgon, which is useful if you do not have any other methods of removing it.</p> <p>Shelgon dislikes opposing Bastiodon, which can easily tank a boosted Outrage and phaze it with Roar. Magnet Pull Probopass is a decent partner for Shelgon, as it can trap and kill Bastiodon. Sawk and Golurk are also good partners, as they can take care of the Steel-types that threaten to stop Shelgon. Meanwhile, Shelgon easily sets up on Alomomola and Tangela, both of which can wall Sawk and Golurk. Shelgon absolutely hates Jynx, as it can outspeed it, even at +2, and easily KO with Ice Beam. Choice Scarf variants can even outspeed Shelgon until it gets to +5 Speed. Metang beats Jynx and is therefore a good partner. Furthermore, it can also take care of Bastiodon if it carries Earthquake. Pursuit trappers can also help to reliably revenge kill Jynx and remove it entirely. Tauros and Lum Berry Skuntank are decent partners for this. Shelgon also appreciates Toxic Spikes support, as it allows Shelgon to wear down walls passively while it sets up against them. Scolipede and Garbodor are effective Toxic Spikes users.</p>"

Wish is mainly a form of recovery for Shelgon. In a pinch, it can also grant a teammate some additional health, but due to Shelgon's low HP stat, it is recommended not to rely on it as a Wish passer. Protect allows Shelgon to scout for moves, rack up Toxic damage, and receive its own Wishes safely. Toxic helps Shelgon to cripple walls and annoy offensive opponents that do not appreciate residual damage. On the other hand, Roar can be used for Shelgon to take on the role of a phazer, and it prevents opponents from setting up on it. Dragon Claw is mainly used as a STAB move to finish off weakened foes and avoid becoming Taunt bait.</p> <p>While Rock Head sees no use on this set, it is the only ability available because Overcoat is illegal with Wish. This Shelgon set is good on stall teams that need resistances to the four elemental types because it can take on physical attackers relatively well. Because this set hates opposing special attackers, special walls are good teammates. Munchlax is a decent teammate, as it can handle Ice-type attacks easily. Its amazing Special Defense allows it to tank most special hits that Shelgon cannot, and it can even phaze if you choose to run Toxic on Shelgon. Lickilicky can handle special attackers decently well and provide Shelgon with Wish and Heal Bell support. This set hates Toxic Spikes; therefore, grounded Poison-type teammates, such as Garbodor and Vileplume, are recommended. Shelgon also needs cleric support because it can no longer stall effectively once it gets crippled by status. Lickilicky and Vileplume can fulfill that role as well. Finally, this set also loves Toxic Spikes support on the opponent's side, as its stalling job becomes much easier if it does not need to Toxic the opponent manually. The previously mentioned Garbodor can set them up easily.</p>"

  "Metang": {
    "overview": "<p>Metang finds a niche thanks to its ability to act as a reliable counter to many Psychic- and Normal-type Pokemon in the tier. Thanks to its decent bulk, which is enhanced further by Eviolite, Metang makes excellent use of its defensive typing to take on many of the offensive Pokemon in the tier, most notably Kangaskhan, Zangoose, Braviary, Serperior, and Musharna. Unfortunately, Metang has difficulty staying around for long due to its lack of recovery and the abundance of Ground- and Fire-type attacks in the tier. Metang's STAB moves lack coverage and have average power, which forces it to rely on Toxic to inflict damage against many common opponents.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Surprisingly, Metang has a lot of options in its movepool. Sleep Talk could be used as a filler if you need someone to absorb sleep afflictions from Exeggutor. Rock Slide could be used if your team is weak to Charizard, but you'll have to predict Charizard's switch in, as it'll force Metang out most of the time. Zen Headbutt could also be used over Meteor Mash, but Metang would become setup bait for Dark-types. An offensive Metang with moves such as Hone Claws and Agility might seem good, but it won't go far with its low Speed and its average Attack. Dual screens are possible, but Metang needs Eviolite to take hits better, and it doesn't have the space in its moveset to run these moves. RestTalk might seem like a good idea, as Metang has no other recovery move and lack Leftovers, but it just doesn't have the space for it. Keep in mind that using Hone Claws and RestTalk in the same set is Metang's best bet as a RestTalk user. Finally, Rest alone can also be used as a filler if you want the recovery and have a Heal Bell user such as Audino on your team, but Metang doesn't have the moveslots to spare.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Even though Metang has some offensive presence, its lack of coverage leaves it open to being set up on by some Pokemon, including Swords Dance Charizard, Swords Dance Samurott, Rock Polish + Swords Dance Torterra, Shell Smash Carracosta, Shell Smash Gorebyss, and Rain Dance Ludicolo. Keep in mind though, that most of them won't enjoy being hit by Toxic. Other than that, Pokemon able to hit Metang hard with a special attack or strong super effective move, such as Charizard, Samurott, Seismitoad, Eelektross, Choice Band Torterra, and Golurk, can easily force Metang out.</p> <p>Magnet Pull Probopass is great against Metang, as it is able to finish Metang off with Earth Power and takes almost nothing from Metang's Meteor Mash, but it must watch out for the occasional Earthquake. Golem can also check Metang, but keep in mind it'll come out weakened at best. Also, Pokemon commonly running Taunt such as Mandibuzz, which can take any hit from Metang, constantly wear it down with Foul Play, and heal itself with Roost, and Misdreavus, which can Heal Bell if Metang hits it with Toxic and can Will-O-Wisp Metang to wear it down, can easily kill Metang. Being grounded, Spikes hinders Metang's survivability quite a lot; add to that its lack of recovery outside of the unreliable RestTalk, and Metang is easy to wear down.</p>",

      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<p>One glance at Metang's stats might suggest that it is suited to act as a defensive wall, but underestimate offensive Metang at your own risk, as it hits many of the offensive threats in the tier hard. Courtesy of its great bulk, Metang can also check physical and special attackers alike, such as Primeape, Serperior, Braviary, and Musharna. Unfortunately, Metang still cannot beat common leads such as Piloswine and Golem one-on-one, but it can survive an Earthquake from them, allowing it to make a move before it dies. Stealth Rock is a handy move on Metang, chipping off health from Pokemon such as Charizard and Rotom-S to which Metang can do little otherwise. Meteor Mash is a strong STAB move, 2HKOing Serperior, Primeape, and Skuntank after Stealth Rock damage. Toxic is essential for Metang to cripple Tangela and Alomomola, and it also allows Metang to beat Musharna without gambling on Meteor Mash Attack boosts. Bullet Punch might seem odd as it limits Metang's coverage, but it is incredibly useful as it allows it to pick off frail threats such as Primeape, Haunter, and Swellow.</p> <p>176 Attack EVs allow Metang to break +1 Defense Braviary's Substitute; adding more doesn't help it net any notable KOs. 80 Special Defense EVs make it easier for Metang to sponge special hits from special attackers such as Kadabra and Haunter. Even though both of Metang's abilities give little benefit, Clear Body is the better option, as it prevents unexpected stat drops from Shadow Ball and Psychic. As for other moves, Psych Up allows Metang to copy stat boosts from Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary effectively. Pursuit can be used over Bullet Punch to catch Haunter and Kadabra as they attempt to switch, but it doesn't serve much use otherwise because it's pathetically weak against other Pokemon. Earthquake enables Metang to hit the likes of Samurott and Skuntank harder, but it shouldn't stay in on Samurott anyway and Skuntank does not survive constant Meteor Mashes either.</p> <p>As far as partners go, Ludicolo is a great teammate as it can beat the Fire- and Ground-types that Metang despises; it also handles certain Water-types such as Alomomola, Seismitoad, and special Samurott well. Misdreavus is also a good teammate, as it is immune to Ground-type attacks and can threaten Golem, Armaldo, Piloswine, and other common leads with Will-O-Wisp and Taunt. Anything that can take on strong Fire-types helps, thus making Carracosta and Seismitoad effective partners for Metang, but they should be wary of Hidden Power Grass that the Fire-types might carry. Pokemon that find Normal- and Flying-types troublesome generally appreciate Metang's presence; Serperior and Primeape are the most noteworthy of these. Alomomola can pass big Wishes to Metang and resists Fire-type attacks aimed at it.</p>"
      },
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>With Eviolite boosting its stellar Defense, Metang becomes a usable physical wall. Metang differentiates itself from other Steel-types in NU with its amazing typing, which is greatly appreciated on stall teams as it lets Metang not only wall popular Normal-, Psychic-, and Flying-types such as Zangoose, Kangaskhan, Musharna, Braviary, and Swellow, but also keep its important resistances and take neutral hits from Fighting-type moves.</p> <p>Metang takes advantage of its resistances by using them to find opportunities to support its team with entry hazards in the form of Stealth Rock. Meteor Mash is Metang's strongest STAB move to directly damage its foes while potentially boosting its Attack. Toxic gives Metang a way to wear down bulky Pokemon trying to set up on it that would otherwise take very little damage from its other attacks. Psych Up is used in the fourth moveslot to copy the boost from Pokemon that think they can set up on Metang, such as Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary, Calm Mind Musharna with Heal Bell, Substitute + Calm Mind Serperior, and Bulk Up Scraggy.</p> <p>If your team needs Metang to take special attacks, an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Careful nature can be used, as it lets Metang take hits from Pokemon such as Gardevoir and Haunter more effectively. As far as partners go, stall partners such as Alomomola, which in particular can easily take any Ground-type move headed toward Metang and provide it with recovery in the form of Wish, and others are your best choices. Zweilous is also a great partner, as it can easily take hits from special attackers such as Charizard, Samurott, and Ludicolo, and along with Metang, wall every relevant special attacker when used together. Furthermore, Metang can still cover most physical attackers. Audino and Lickilicky also pair well with Metang, as they can tank a special attack, provide recovery with Wish, and heal status conditions with Heal Bell.</p>"

  "Bibarel": {
    "overview": "<p>Bibarel is generally an unfortunate case. All three of its abilities are among the best in the game (Moody being banned for being too overpowered), but Bibarel simply lacks the stats and movepool to make good use of them. Bibarel does possess a decent support movepool with options such as Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave, but it is so heavily outclassed that dealing with its countless flaws is not worth the trouble. However, Bibarel does have the potential to be a plausible threat by using Curse alongside Simple and its great STAB coverage. Even so, Bibarel is still a very weak and underwhelming Pokemon that has no chance of being the serious threat it could have been if it wasn't so cruelly designed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A defensive set with Unaware using Stealth Rock and Toxic, Thunder Wave, or Yawn can be used, but it's generally ineffective with Bibarel's pathetic defenses. It's also possible to run a specially defensive mono-Curse set using Waterfall, but it's far too easily dealt with and difficult to execute with Bibarel's lackluster special bulk. Work Up is another boosting attack Bibarel has access to and can turn it into a mixed attacker, but Bibarel still remains awfully weak with its subpar offenses. Bibarel can be used as a weather supporter as well, but it is completely inferior to the plethora of other choices out there. Taunt and Super Fang can be used in conjunction to break down walls, but Golbat does this task significantly better and there are other more reliable wallbreakers to consider. Lastly, Aqua Tail can be used over Waterfall for a stronger but less accurate STAB attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>It's not difficult to counter Bibarel whatsoever; anything that can take Waterfall and Quick Attack and retaliate back hard generally works well. More specifically, strong Electric-, Grass, and Fighting-type attackers will completely obliterate Bibarel. Eelektross, Exeggutor, and Sawk are examples of such. Taunt users, such as Mandibuzz and Samurott, can nullify half of Bibarel's typical moveset, and any phazer, such as Bastiodon and Lickilicky, can make it start from square one. Water immune or resistant Pokemon, such as Water Absorb Seismitoad and Alomomola, can hamper Bibarel's sweeping potential, as it's forced to use its weaker Quick Attack. Frillish stands as the perfect counter to Bibarel, being immune to both of Bibarel's STAB attacks, although it cannot do much back. All that basically needs to be done is to not obliviously allow Bibarel to accumulate full boosts because it does have the possibility to do some harm.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Simple Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>This is the only set Bibarel can run remotely well. With its Simple ability, Curse becomes a Swords Dance and Iron Defense boost in one, meaning Bibarel only needs to set up three times to maximize its power and bulk. Rest is used to recover Bibarel's lost HP from taking hits while Curse boosting and remove any status ailments, and with Chesto Berry intact, it won't be subject to the initial Rest's sleep effect. Waterfall is the primary STAB attack of choice, hitting more Pokemon harder than Return. Quick Attack takes up the last slot to provide much-needed STAB priority to prevent revenge killers, such as Rotom-A and Primeape, from easily checking Bibarel.</p> <p>Max HP EVs are used to give Bibarel more opportunities to pile up Curse boosts, and the rest of the EVs are dumped into Attack with an Adamant nature so Bibarel can actually hit hard with the accumulated Curses. It's possible to run Return over Quick Attack if you prefer to have a stronger coverage attack, but losing priority leaves Bibarel vulnerable to literally any Pokemon due to Curse harshly reducing its Speed.</p> <p>It's not surprising that Bibarel needs significant support to work. Toxic Spikes support is highly recommended so the opponent is still being hampered as Bibarel boosts up. It also prevents Alomomola from completely walling Bibarel. Therefore, Garbodor and Roselia are great options to look into, as they both also resist Bibarel's Fighting-type weakness. Due to Bibarel boasting a pitiful defensive stat spread, dual screens support from the likes of Gardevoir and Serperior is strongly encouraged. This can help to potentially ensure Bibarel reaches three Curse boosts for maximum power. It's also necessary to pack teammates to remove the common bulky Grass- and Water-types that are resistant or immune to Waterfall, such as Tangela, Seismitoad, and the previously mentioned Alomomola. Piloswine packs Icicle Spear and priority Ice Shard to pick off weakened Grass- and Dragon-types, while Charizard can lure and easily muscle through bulky Water-types with its powerful Fire Blast followed up with a Hidden Power Grass. Exeggutor deals with Water-types very well, demolishing most with its STAB Leaf Storm, and also resists Bibarel's Grass-, Fighting-, and Electric-type weaknesses.</p>"

  "Luxray": {
    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written around the time that BW was considered the main generation. The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW NU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>With base 120 Attack, a great ability in Guts, and a strong physical movepool to back it up, Luxray has what it needs to be a potent offensive threat in NU. Its Electric typing grants it a good STAB move in Wild Charge, allowing Luxray to get past a foe that most physical attackers struggle with: Alomomola. Additionally, Superpower gives Luxray the ability to handle Regirock and other common physical threats. This, in conjunction with its decent bulk and good coverage, makes Luxray a force to be reckoned with.</p> <p>However, Luxray isn't without its flaws. Guts usually requires a poison or burn to activate and with the residual damage of status, along with the recoil from Wild Charge, Luxray won't last very long. Additionally, base 70 Speed is rather slow, so faster Pokemon such as Zangoose and Sawk can outspeed and hurt Luxray before it can react. Luxray also struggles against some common physical walls, such as Tangela, meaning it can be stopped in its tracks without proper teammates, something you must keep in mind when using Luxray.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With Intimidate and decent bulk, Luxray is capable of running a defensive set with Roar, Discharge, and either Toxic or Thunder Wave. However, with Braviary receiving Defiant, this set has lost its main niche. Fire Fang and Ice Fang are options on the Guts set, but a boosted Facade does more damage overall. Howl seems cool as it boosts Attack, but Luxray will rarely be able to boost effectively, with Guts and Choice Band being more reliable. Quick Attack is Luxray's only priority move and can help Luxray pick off weakened threats; however most Luxray sets suffer from four-moveslot syndrome.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Due to its great coverage, Luxray does not have a large number of hard counters. That being said, there are a number of good Luxray checks. Regirock, thanks to its titanic physical bulk, can take most of what Luxray has to offer and can retaliate with Earthquake. Pokemon that can outspeed Luxray, such as Sawk and Zangoose, can deal heavy damage before it can strike back. Luxray is also rather weak before Guts activates, so taking it out before it gets the boost is ideal. As Luxray will get worn down by status and Wild Charge recoil, setting up entry hazards will further shorten its lifespan. Garbodor is good at this, and can take repeated Wild Charges while its Aftermath ability will damage Luxray upon being KOed. Metang has enough physical bulk to take what Luxray has to offer and can hit it with weak Earthquakes. Tangela and Gurdurr are in a similar boat with additional access to recovery moves, healing off any damage Luxray throws at them. Finally, Sawsbuck could come in on Wild Charge and pummel Luxray with its attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Guts": {
        "description": "<p>This is Luxray's best set. Using its great coverage and base 120 Attack, Luxray can put massive holes in opposing teams. Luxray stands out among other status abusers, such as Zangoose and Swellow, due to its decent bulk and great coverage. Luxray also sports a higher Attack stat than both of these Pokemon and is also able to break through Alomomola. This allows Luxray to serve as an excellent mid-game attacker, hitting the opposing team hard and giving its teammates opportunities to sweep through the remaining Pokemon. Wild Charge is Luxray's STAB move of choice and, while the recoil does not pair up well with the burn damage, it hits fairly hard after a Guts boost. Superpower provides more coverage, maiming Pokemon like Regirock and Golem that would otherwise take little to no damage from Wild Charge. Facade benefits from Guts and hits Grass-types such as Tangela for decent damage. Finally, Crunch is chosen as a final coverage move to pummel incoming Exeggutor and Golurk, both of which don't mind Wild Charge.</p> <p>A Jolly nature allows Luxray to Speed tie with positive natured Samurott and Ludicolo. An Adamant nature will help Luxray hit Alomomola harder, but being able to tie with Ludicolo and Samurott is important. Flame Orb activates Guts, which is needed to attain the needed Guts boost. Using a Toxic Orb instead will lessen the initial damage, but the net damage will be greater than Flame Orb after the third turn. Ice Fang can be used over Facade to better handle Altaria, but a boosted Facade is generally stronger and has more utility.</p> <p>Luxray is not easy to switch into the battlefield, so a slow Volt Switch user, such as Probopass or Baton Pass Musharna, can get Luxray in safely and also activate Guts quickly. Spikes support from the likes of Cacturne or Garbodor is useful to help Luxray net some KOs it would otherwise miss out on. A Rapid Spin user can be used to remove entry hazards to prevent Luxray from being worn down more easily, but the majority of viable spinners aren't too useful outside of removing entry hazards. Sawk is a great offensive partner, dealing with both Regirock and Golem. Finally, Articuno and Regice both make good offensive teammates, checking Tangela and opposing Dragon-types, such as Altaria and Fraxure.</p>"
      },
      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<p>This set uses Luxray's Special Attack stat alongside its Attack stat to get past certain threats that Luxray can't beat otherwise. Thunderbolt is Luxray's main attack, as it is a reliable STAB move that can get past threats such as Gorebyss while giving Luxray a way to break down Alomomola. Superpower is in the second moveslot, because it's ridiculously powerful coming off Luxray's base 120 Attack stat, nailing Regice and Lickilicky for OHKOs, the former after Stealth Rock and the latter after a Thunderbolt. Superpower cleanly OHKOes Audino and Bastiodon right off the bat. Hidden Power Grass gives Luxray the power to OHKO Seismitoad and Golem, the latter if Sturdy has been broken. This means that Seismitoad in particular no longer walls Luxray to no end. In the last moveslot, it's down to personal preference. Volt Switch lets you scout for switches against Pokemon Luxray checks, such as Braviary, giving you momentum. On the other hand, Signal Beam hits almost every Grass-type hard as well as Psychic-types such as Duosion.</p> <p>Ice Fang could be used in the last slot in order to hit Altaria, who walls this set otherwise, and it is also the only way to hit Roselia and Vileplume for super effective damage. However, it is not listed because it doesn't make as good use of the EV spread as the other two options do. The EV spread lets Luxray hit with as much power as possible on the special side, giving it a way to hit physical walls, who are this set's main targets, hard while still hitting like a truck on the physical side. The remaining EVs are dumped into Speed to let Luxray outpace max Speed Gorebyss before a Shell Smash and OHKO it with Thunderbolt. Life Orb is used to let Luxray hit hard on both the physical and special side, and a Rash nature boosts Luxray's Special Attack further while not lowering its Attack stat. Intimidate is used due to Guts only boosting Luxray's Attack stat, as well as for its ability to turn Luxray into a half-decent bulky pivot. However, if you are paranoid about Superpower not being weakened by burn, Guts is still viable, but it's too unreliable to be recommended.</p> <p>Entry hazard setters are vital to Luxray's success, gaining it many OHKOs and 2HKOs after they have been set up, such as an OHKO on Regice with Superpower. This makes Pokemon such as Garbodor, Cacturne, and Probopass very good teammates For Luxray. Strong special attackers, such as Choice Specs Altaria, make good partners for their ability to lure Pokemon such as Regice in, ready to be KOed or crippled by Superpower. Ice-types such as Regice and Articuno complement Luxray with their typing and ability to hit Vileplume, Roselia, and Tangela hard, coming in on a Volt Switch or a well predicted double switch. Water-types such as Carracosta, Samurott, and Ludicolo make good teammates for Luxray, hitting Piloswine and Golurk harder than Hidden Power Grass. Fast and frail sweepers such as Swellow and Choice Scarf Charizard make good partners for Luxray as well because it breaks down walls, opening up a late-game sweep for the said Pokemon.</p>"
      },
      "Choice": {
        "description": "<p>With a Choice item, Luxray can become an effective wallbreaker or revenge killer. Unlike the Guts set, this does not suffer from residual damage and provides a more immediate threat. Choice Band Luxray faces stiff competition from Eelektross, which packs U-turn, Aqua Tail, and an immunity to Ground-type moves, but Luxray stands out with its greater power and higher Speed stat. Wild Charge is the obligatory STAB move, heavily damaging targets that do not resist it. Superpower is the coverage move of choice, hitting Golem and Regirock, two Pokemon that don't mind Wild Charge. Ice Fang provides decent coverage with Wild Charge and hits Dragon-types and Tangela. Finally, Volt Switch is chosen to scout switch-ins and to allow a more immediately threatening teammate to switch in. However, Crunch can be used to hit Golurk, which takes little from Luxray's other moves.</p> <p>When using a Choice Band, a Jolly nature allows Luxray to Speed tie with positive natured Samurott and Ludicolo. However, an Adamant nature offers more power and works well with a Choice Scarf. The choice between a Choice Band and Choice Scarf depends on the role that Luxray will play on your team. Intimidate is useful to soften up damage from physical attackers, such as Sawk and Zangoose. However, Guts can be useful to absorb Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Misdreavus.</p> <p>Sawk is a solid teammate to KO Regirock and Golem while providing solid offensive synergy with Luxray. Golurk is in a similar boat and can also come in on opposing Sawk. Articuno and Regice can be useful as well, as they check Tangela and Altaria, and again provide great offensive synergy. Additionally, Samurott and Ludicolo handle Regirock effectively. Luxray also appreciates Spikes support to help it net some KOs. Cacturne and Garbodor are both excellent options for this.</p>"

  "Rampardos": {
    "overview": "<p>Feel the wrath of Rampardos and its unrivaled base 165 Attack, which makes it the strongest wallbreaker you'll ever get to see in the lower tiers. Out of its two decent abilities, Mold Breaker is superior as it allows Rampardos to be a wallbreaker with a bit of utility by allowing it to OHKO common Sturdy Stealth Rock users. However, despite all of the power Rampardos packs, it is quite the glass cannon; its defenses are quite low and it is quite slow. Nonetheless, Rampardos is still able to outspeed the slower defensive Pokemon in the tier and does a fine job of Head Smashing them into oblivion.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Other options include a specially offensive Sheer Force set with moves such as Thunderbolt and Ice Beam, but this set is not very appropriate for the Neverused tier due to Tangela's dwindling usage—its only use is to lure Alomomola, which is 2HKOed by Head Smash regardless. A Choice Scarf set is a good idea, but even after the boost, Rampardos's Speed is still underwhelming. Stealth Rock can be used on an offensive lead set, but such a set is suboptimal due to Rampardos's frailty. Toxic is another great option to use on a Life Orb set to cripple bulky walls such as Alomomola and Tangela. Rampardos boasts boosting moves in Swords Dance and Rock Polish, and can elect to run both for a double dance set. However, it is difficult to find opportunities for Rampardos to set up due to its low defenses. Substitute can act as a useful shield against stray attacks, but it will cause Rampardos to lose even more health, which can be painful in conjunction with Head Smash. A combination of Substitute and Endeavor can help Rampardos get past troublesome opponents such as Alomomola low on health without risking the recoil of Head Smash.</p> <p>Some options that Rampardos has are downright unviable and should not be used. Double-Edge might seem tempting due to its high power, but it has useless coverage, and its recoil just reduces Rampardos's already disappointing longevity. A Substitute + Focus Punch set should not be considered as Superpower should be sufficient as Rampardos's Fighting-type coverage and its Substitutes are frail and easily broken. Dragon Tail might seem fun for phazing the opponent but a bulkier phazer such as Lickilicky should be used for the role of a phazer instead.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>It is very difficult to counter Rampardos, as even the bulkiest physical walls have trouble tanking more than one Head Smash. Metang is one of the few reliable checks to Rampardos, as it avoids the OHKO from Earthquake most of the time and can OHKO back with Meteor Mash or Bullet Punch. Since Fighting-types resist Rock-type attacks, they can also tank a hit before smashing Rampardos with a super effective STAB move of choice; Pokemon capable of doing so include Sawk, Throh, and Gurdurr. Alomomola in particular can wear out Rampardos by forcing it to Head Smash repeatedly, causing Rampardos to take massive amount of recoil, while stalling it out with Wish and Protect. In a similar vein, Tangela is a check that is 2HKOed only by Head Smash, and can easily hit Rampardos hard with its STAB Grass-type moves. Torterra is another stable check to Rampardos, being able to survive a Head Smash and retaliate with Earthquake or Wood Hammer. In general, it is easy to kill this bumbling beast by outspeeding it and striking it where it hurts; many common offensive Pokemon in the tier can accomplish this easily, with some common choices being Samurott, Ludicolo, Primeape, and Seismitoad.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>On this set, Rampardos is equipped with a Choice Band in order to boost its Attack to sky-high levels; it works great with Head Smash because even Pokemon that resist the move have trouble tanking multiple hits. Head Smash is Rampardos's main attack and wreaks destruction easily, especially since it boasts the capability to 2HKO two of the bulkiest physical walls in Neverused: Alomomola and Musharna. Unfortunately, there is a limit to the amount of shots Rampardos is able to fire—there is a large amount of recoil damage incurred by the usage of Head Smash, which wears out Rampardos fairly quickly. Earthquake is a very useful move, especially when combined with Mold Breaker, as it is able to bypass Sturdy and KO its users, often eliminating common entry hazard setters early game. Crunch OHKOes Golurk, another common Stealth Rock setter. Stone Edge and Rock Slide are good alternative options when Rampardos is low on health and does not wish to fall to recoil; Stone Edge is more powerful but Rock Slide is more accurate.</p> <p>Superpower is an alternative option to the set as it provides great coverage and has high power; however, it has the consequence of dropping Rampardos's Attack and Defense after each use. A Jolly nature can also be used to allow Rampardos to outspeed standard Mandibuzz, after which it can proceed to OHKO it, but this invariably results in a drop in power. Sheer Force is a viable option as it boosts the power of Crunch and Rock Slide, but Rampardos prefers the ability to OHKO Sturdy Pokemon before they have the chance to set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Rampardos is generally used to destroy the bulkiest of walls so that other teammates will have an easier time sweeping, and with paralysis support from teammates such as Musharna, Probopass, and Regice, Rampardos is also able to sweep as well. Good teammates for Rampardos are those that can take advantage of the removal of bulky walls and sweep. Some common late-game cleaners such as Sawsbuck, Tauros, and Sawk are good teammates as they take advantage of Rampardos's wallbreaking abilities. Offensive Seismitoad is a good teammate for dealing with opposing defensive Seismitoad , a Stealth Rock setter which isn't OHKOed by Rampardos. It also sets up its own Stealth Rock for your team; Stealth Rock weakens opponents so that Rampardos can break through them. Some Pokemon that appreciate Rampardos's ability to defeat common Stealth Rock setters include powerhouses such as Charizard and Swellow that otherwise have a limited number of switch-ins. Additionally, Rampardos functions very well on Trick Room teams, so other great supporting teammates include Musharna, Duosion, and Beheeyem.</p>"

  "Bastiodon": {
    "overview": "<p>This analysis was written around the time that BW was considered the main generation. The following content may no longer be accurate about this Pokemon's place in the metagame and the BW NU metagame in general.</p> <hr /> <p>Wielding massive defensive stats, a typing that gives it a bunch of nifty resistances, and the ability to set up Stealth Rock and phaze with Roar, Bastiodon has a solid niche on defensive teams. However, its rare and defensive Steel typing is sadly hindered by its additional Rock typing, giving it many exploitable weaknesses, including two 4x ones to very common offensive types in the tier, Fighting and Ground. In addition, Bastiodon has no offensive presence or reliable recovery moves, so it can easily end up being dead weight to the team. While these traits hinder Bastiodon greatly, some stall teams still find this Pokemon's plethora of resistances and support moves to be just what they need to patch the holes in their defenses.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While it's blessed with an extensive movepool, Bastiodon fails to use almost any of it effectively. Rock Blast could fit into a slot, but it could only really hit Ninjask and break Haunter's Substitutes, and Bastiodon can safely Roar them out anyway. Its special movepool is marvelous, as it contains Thunderbolt, Flamethrower, Ice Beam, and Flash Cannon, but none of these attacks will do close to satisfactory damage unless super effective. A Curse set is plausible with Rock Blast and Avalanche, but it would need many boosts to do significant damage. Bastiodon can also learn Taunt, but it is too slow for it to be effective.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Because of its typing, Bastiodon can be defeated by almost any Ground- or Fighting-type attack, so it is threatened out by the likes of Sawk, Primeape, Golurk, Pinsir, and Golem, all of which are common. Marowak deserves a special mention, as it can bypass Sturdy and OHKO with Bonemerang; any Pokemon with Mold Breaker, such as Sawk, Rampardos, and Fraxure, can also bypass Sturdy and KO Bastiodon. Water-type Pokemon such as Samurott and Ludicolo can also hit Bastiodon super effectively, but Bastiodon can usually survive one hit and phaze them out. In addition, any residual damage, such as entry hazards and burns, will wear down Bastiodon quickly because it can't heal itself reliably.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Bastiodon will start off most games by switching in on a defensive Pokemon or a Pokemon with ineffective attacks to set up Stealth Rock to support the team. Magic Coat will bounce back Taunt or harmful statuses, ensuring Bastiodon's longevity; it can also reflect any incoming Spikes or Toxic Spikes, saving the team time for setting up while the opponent has to lay down entry hazards. One of Bastiodon's redeeming qualities is its treasured ability to safely counter the antics of Pokemon with the Prankster ability, such as Swagger and Foul Play Liepard and Copycat and Roar Riolu, as Magic Coat has a higher priority than what Prankster gives their moves. Once enough entry hazards are on the opponent's side of the field, Bastiodon can begin phazing with Roar, racking up as much damage as possible. Toxic is in the last slot as it is the only significant source of damage Bastiodon can offer, and it can neuter some important Pokemon such as Alomomola and Audino who have the Regenerator ability, which minimizes entry hazard damage. It also badly poisons Flying-type and levitating Pokemon, who avoid Toxic Spikes.</p> <p>Sturdy is the better ability because it nearly guarantees that Bastiodon will set up Stealth Rock, ensuring only Bonemerang Marowak and Pokemon with the ability Mold Breaker can stop it. Against more offensive teams, this will most likely be all that Bastiodon is able to accomplish, as its typing leaves it open to many common moves, such as Earthquake, Close Combat, and Hidden Power Ground. Its EVs can be switched from Special Defense to Defense depending on the team, but Bastiodon's Defense is much more exploitable due to its typing. If Toxic damage is really important to the team, Protect can be used instead of Magic Coat to rack it up, gain Leftovers recovery, and scout for Pokemon with Trick or with super effective coverage. Metal Burst can also be used in place of Magic Coat for decent damage, but Magic Coat will generally provide more utility to the team as Protect is only a safe option and Metal Burst is situational at best.</p> <p>Because of Bastiodon's lack of reliable recovery, Wish support is recommended to keep it alive. Alomomola is a good partner, as it can take Water-type attacks aimed at Bastiodon. Misdreavus also patches up both of Bastiodon's 4x weaknesses with its immunity to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks; Misdreavus is also one of the tier's best spinblockers and can help ensure Bastiodon's phazing deals optimal damage. Bastiodon also covers Misdreavus's weaknesses to Dark- and Ghost-type attacks, so they have great synergy with each other. As Spikes and Toxic Spikes support is necessary for a stall team, Roselia and Garbodor make excellent partners.</p>"

  "Mothim": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Mothim seems to be outclassed by Butterfree and other Quiver Dance users due to its frailty and lack of Sleep Powder, but fortunately for Mothim, its decently high Special Attack and Tinted Lens ability typically make it a better user of Choice Specs than these Pokemon, though an inferior user of Quiver Dance. Even so, Mothim's low Speed, 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, and overall frailty make it hard for it to stay around for longer than a few turns, so its use is fairly limited. While it won't hurt to try Mothim out, you have to keep in mind that it faces a lot of competition as a wallbreaker from other Pokemon such as Charizard, who can provide other benefits to your team in addition to punching holes in opposing teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mothim receives Quiver Dance, which is a fantastic setup move. Sadly, it is outclassed in this department by both Butterfree and Masquerain, who have Sleep Powder and Intimidate, respectively, to help them set up. Hidden Power Ice or Water can be used to hit Pokemon such as Altaria or Camerupt, respectively, a little harder, but Mothim's STAB moves are usually enough for its purposes. Giga Drain is a neat move that can be used to recover the moth's health, but in the long run it probably won't help Mothim survive any attacks, and Grass-type moves don't provide any useful coverage. Tailwind can boost Mothim's Speed and allow Mothim to support its team, but Mothim's frailty and the short duration of the move's effect mean that it is gimmicky at best. There is also the option of a physical set with Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics and U-turn, but Mothim has no way of boosting its average Attack stat. Finally, Swarm can be used to boost Bug Buzz's power when Mothim is at low health, but Tinted Lens is a far better ability in the long run.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Because of its sheer power thanks to Choice Specs and Tinted Lens, Mothim can be a tough Pokemon to switch into. However, checking it is a lot easier due to its many notable flaws. Because of Mothim's average Speed and awful defenses, a faster Pokemon such as Sawk, Rotom-S, or Zangoose can outspeed and OHKO Mothim. Keep in mind that these Pokemon are strictly revenge killers, as they cannot switch in to Mothim's attacks. Stealth Rock is a huge thorn in Mothim's side, as it strips away half its HP every time it switches in. Setting and keeping it up can be a problem due to Mothim's teammates preventing you from doing so, but it helps with controlling Mothim's switch-ins. As for some specific counters, Probopass hard counters Mothim if it doesn't run Hidden Power Ground, as can either OHKO with Power Gem or set up Stealth Rock. Special walls such as Regice and Lickilicky that have high Special Defense stats also counter Mothim, and can either phaze it out or OHKO in Regice's case. Finally, priority moves from Pokemon such as Skuntank and Piloswine can easily OHKO Mothim with some prior damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Bug Buzz and Air Slash are Mothim's strongest STAB options and the combination of the two is unresisted in NU, thanks to Mothim's Tinted Lens ability. Since the majority of the Pokemon in the tier that use sleep-inducing moves are Grass- or Bug-type Pokemon, Mothim makes a great user of Sleep Talk as it both resists their STAB attacks and can deal damage back with either Air Slash or Bug Buzz, as appropriate. Finally, U-turn allows Mothim to maintain momentum for its team by pivoting away from the special walls that can take its Choice Specs-Boosted boosted attacks, such as Lickilicky, Audino, and Probopass.</p> <p>Rash is preferred over Modest, as Mothim's defenses are terrible anyway, and it doesn't want U-turn to be weakened. Choice Specs is used as it boosts Mothim's power, which is really its only redeeming trait, while Tinted Lens makes the move lock a trivial matter. Hidden Power Ground is an interesting option over Sleep Talk as it can be used to hit Probopass and Bastiodon, who can otherwise wall Mothim. Due to its crippling Stealth Rock weakness, a spinner, such as Wartortle, or a teammate who can defeat common entry hazard setters, such as Mold Breaker Sawk, Taunt Samurott, or Bullet Seed Torterra, is an immense help in order to keep Mothim healthy. Spikes support is needed for Mothim to OHKO some Pokemon, such as bulkier Golurk, which makes Garbodor a great partner as it can reliably set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes to support its team and take hits for Mothim in a pinch. Due to Mothim's bad bulk, pivots such as Musharna and Probopass make amazing partners for it as they can easily take any hit for Mothim and spread paralysis to support it, or in Probopass's case, set up Stealth Rock.</p>"

  "Vespiquen": {
    "overview": "<p>It's not difficult to understand why Vespiquen struggles to fit in NU, as it is a wall with a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock. First, Vespiquen's typing and lack of Speed allows most sweepers to scare it out and gain easy boosts. To add insult to injury, Vespiquen's movepool is horrendously small and predictable. Luckily, a Bug / Flying typing makes Vespiquen a decent Sawk and Golurk check, and Pressure is a decent ability for drawn out matches. Typically, however, the amount of support Vespiquen needs is not worth the trouble of using it in a match.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute is a decent option for Vespiquen, but Vespiquen's low Speed prevents it from blocking any status moves. Defend Order seems like a cool move, but Vespiquen needs the moves it already has to efficiently stall. A Hone Claws + Acrobatics set is possible but is terribly outclassed by offensive Pokemon that don't have a 4x Stealth Rock weakness, such as Swellow and Drifblim. The Custap Berry + Destiny Bond combination is surprising but is gimmicky at best. Vespiquen has access to Swagger, but it is entirely luck reliant so it will often let you down. Vespiquen can set up weather, but Pokemon with better typings and abilities are more suited for the job.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>First things first: Stealth Rock is the most reliable method to check Vespiquen. Other than that, Steel- and Poison-types can't be touched by Vespiquen, so they make great counters. Substitute sweepers, such as Misdreavus, Drifblim, and Braviary, can all set up on Vespiquen and not fear Attack Order. Rock-type coverage from Pokemon such as Sawk, Primeape, and Golem is a great way to check Vespiquen as well. Taunt users that are not weak to Attack Order, such as Samurott, also make good checks. Lastly, special attackers with super effective coverage, such as Charizard, check Vespiquen reliably.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wall": {
        "description": "<p>Vespiquen's greatest niche is its ability Pressure, which can turn threatening scenarios in its favor. For example, Close Combat can only be used four times, greatly helping Vespiquen's survivability. Protect is the most important move, as it stalls the opponent's PP and gains Leftovers recovery. Roost adds on to the longevity, granting Vespiquen more walling opportunities. Toxic is its most reliable damaging source, seriously crippling many Pokemon that switch into Vespiquen. Attack Order prevents Vespiquen from being Taunt bait, and it has decent power for a wall.</p> <p>The most important thing to recognize when supporting Vespiquen is that it needs Rapid Spin support to function decently as a wall; Wartortle is the best option because its typing synergizes the best with Vespiquen out of all the NU Rapid Spinners. Cleric support is also highly recommended, as residual damage will drastically limit Vespiquen's walling capabilities; Audino is a great partner for this job, since Vespiquen can take Fighting-type attacks aimed at it. Garbodor, the Toxic Spikes setter that synergizes best with Vespiquen, is a helpful partner since Toxic Spikes support saves Vespiquen many extra turns to heal itself instead of using Toxic. Misdreavus is a cool partner that fits the stall playstyle well because it offers a fast Taunt that can keep Stealth Rock off the field. Partners with phazing moves, such as Bastiodon, make great partners, as they can force out sweepers that set up on Vespiquen. One last, great partner is defensive Seismitoad, as its typing covers almost all of Vespiquen's weaknesses while Vespiquen 4x resists its Grass-type weakness.</p>"

  "Pachirisu": {
    "overview": "<p>Though Pachirisu lacks the Flying-type coverage granted to its fellow squirrel Emolga and a niche, game-changing item such as Pikachu's Light Ball, I promise there is still a reason to use it. That reasoning, however, is buried rather far under the ground, in a place to which Pachirisu can't venture (you know, due to typing and all that). As such, the mystery of Pachirisu's presence in NU is as of yet unsolved. However, those brave souls who have dedicated themselves with a passion to understanding Pachirisu have made leaps and bounds in between the generations, discovering a latent ability--Volt Absorb--deep within the recesses of Pachirisu's dreams. This ability has truly catapulted Pachirisu sky-high, where, if only for a moment, it can soar just as well as Emolga.</p> <p>It also makes Pachirisu a really nice counter to Plusle or Minun for when you're having a Battle of the Cutest with your friends.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Though Pachirisu was designed, honestly, to ferry items from one Pokemon to another, there are a few more moves it can utilize to its advantage. For those trainers who fear the wrath of an angry Pachirisu, moves such as Flatter, Fake Tears, Growl, and Sweet Kiss can be placed over Volt Switch and Super Fang, maximizing Pachirisu's endearing qualities. For the few trainers who, instead, embrace the idea of a miniature version of Godzilla running through the park, Pachirisu can control the fauna of its natural habitat using Grass Knot to trip up larger foes. And, while you're at it, since you're destroying the sanctity of such a cute Pokemon, how about you teach your pet squirrel how to Dig, even though it lives in the trees!? A reminder, of course, that even with Dig, Pachirisu will not be able find the reasoning for its use in NU. It does, however, make Earthquake a really good idea for your opponent, if you have any shred of goodliness in your body and want to advise them. For those who are on power trips, Pachirisu can use Hyper Fang over Super Fang. Though I can't guarantee it will actually do more damage, the knowledge that the name of the move is superior in all ways may put your mind at ease.</p> <p>Pachirisu can also adapt its items, ability, and nature to reflect your needs. Sometimes Pachirisu just can't stand the fact that people consider it inferior to Pikachu. If your Pachirisu is one of the ones affected by this extreme jealously, let it hold a Light Ball to calm it down. When it has recovered its sense enough to continue battling, it can even Fling the Light Ball to paralyze enemies! If the same thing happens but with its cousin Emolga, feel free to give Pachirisu an Air Balloon. In order to get your Pachirisu more in-tune with its natural instincts, you are free to let it use the Run Away ability and a Bashful nature, thereby perfectly mimicking real squirrels. You may be able to use this to your advantage, tricking the opponent into believing you don't have a deadly monster on the field, and are in fact just some nut with a squirrel for a pet.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Honestly, Pachirisu is just too speedy to stop. It outpaces quite a lot of the NU metagame, and upon doing so, completely incapacitates almost every enemy with its generosity. After all, who doesn't like playing with new toys? Do you think your Pokemon don't have a fun side to them? You seriously are the type of monster who wouldn't want to use Pachirisu. I can't stand people like you. However, you can put a stop to Pachirisu's item shuffling fun by using Pokemon faster than it, Pokemon who have any sort of attack and aren't as impressed by gifts as you'd hoped, or any Pokemon that is too tall for Pachirisu to steal from. All three of these areas of weakness in Pachirisu's stronghold make Charizard the premier counter for it, though Pokemon such as Zangoose, Fraxure, and Torterra work just as well. But not Luvdisc. Or Pelipper. Don't even try, you heartless fiends.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Generous Sparky": {
        "description": "<p>As mentioned earlier, Pachirisu works in mysterious ways. While most Pokemon look to make the most of their items by hoarding them for themselves, a few others look to Trick their items to the opponent in order to cripple them. Pachirisu, however, takes this notion in a direction only a squirrel truly could: up a tree. With Bestow, Pachirisu offers up its item--its proverbial nut--to the opponent. Upon witnessing an act of such generosity, many opponents will refuse to strike such an innocent creature, and will be sent, domesticated by a squirrel, back to their trainers. Of course, Bestow can only work if Pachirisu's opponent isn't already bearing an item (probably not for a gift exchange, unfortunately). To guarantee that Pachirisu gives its gift to its foe, Fling can be used to forcibly chuck the item at the enemy. Of course, Pachirisu can't just stop there. If it brought a gift for one Pokemon, it has to have gifts for them all, right? By utilizing its access to Covet, Pachirisu can perform the act of re-gifting even better than you can when you receive those ugly sweaters from your grandparents at Christmas time.</p> <p>There are times, however, when even Pachirisu's generosity won't be enough to placate the ferocious beast you may be facing. This is most likely because their trainer is the literal incarnation of the Grinch, pre-heart swelling, and never taught them how to enjoy the act of giving. Or maybe they're mad Pachirisu stole their item? It doesn't matter, though, because Pachirisu will become a ferocious beast of its own, with power rivaling that of a local squirrel that may or may not have rabies. In the event that Pachirisu becomes this uncontrollable monstrosity, Volt Switch can be used to return it to you, thereby calming the beast within. Should Pachirisu fail to return, however, it will likely cut the opponent's life span in half thanks to Super Fang. Alternatively, it might even learn to spit venom and poison them with Toxic. This last scenario is probably only possible if you've dipped your Pachirisu in hazardous waste, for which you should feel really, really bad.</p> <p>Because Pachirisu is a squirrel at heart, the most genuine item to use is a Lum Berry. This works perfectly alongside Bestow, as Pachirisu's paws are just large enough to hold a Lum Berry, giving the appearance of a helpless beggar, akin to Oliver Twist. Those who prefer to utilize Fling and the more dangerous variants of Pachirisu may want to make it hold a Zap Plate, which will power up Volt Switch and probably tickle the opponent a little when it gets thrown at them. Volt Absorb, as previously lauded, makes Pachirisu the ultimate Electric-type. The EVs are very specific, in order to maximize Pachirisu's effectiveness. 156 HP EVs gives Pachirisu an HP stat of 300, filling it with the souls of shirtless warriors from the movie of the same name. A Timid nature and maximized Speed EVs allow Pachirisu to move as nimbly as its stumpy feet allow, making it more effective at delivering items than either UPS or FedEx. 56 Special Attack EVs allow Pachirisu to OHKO Swanna with Volt Switch even without the Zap Plate, which is important as ducks are the squirrel's only natural enemy. The remaining 44 EVs go into Special Defense, making it slightly harder to cause mental and emotional damage to Pachirisu's tiny brain.</p>"

  "Floatzel": {
    "overview": "<p>Meet the fastest Water-type in NU, complete with usable offensive stats and a movepool to present itself as a threat. Having acquired Hydro Pump and resolved some move illegalities with Water Veil, most importantly that of Ice Punch, Floatzel can now combat numerous threats at once without sacrificing its effectiveness. With its access to a plethora of coverage moves, Floatzel can take on a wide variety of Pokemon by itself, blasting through them before they can move. Unfortunately, its frailty means it often loses to most neutral match-ups and bulky walls. Floatzel also faces competition from Simipour and Basculin as a fast, hard-hitting Water-type, and its awkward mix of higher physical Attack and stronger special movepool doesn't help it in that regard.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Me First is situationally useful for reflecting back certain moves of slower opponents, occasionally outdamaging Floatzel's own attacks, but is useless against moves its counters use and fails against faster opponents and attacks. Focus Blast is an option, but most of its targets are specially defensive or are hit harder by Hydro Pump anyway, limiting its usefulness. Aqua Tail can be used over Waterfall anywhere it is mentioned, but trading flinching and accuracy just for 10 increased Base Power is generally not worth it, especially when Floatzel can easily make use of the flinch chance with its good Speed. Pursuit can be used to trap Pokemon such as Jynx, but Sneasel does this better due to STAB and resisting its targets' STABs. Rain Dance can be used to power up Floatzel's STAB while doubling its Speed, but Floatzel doesn't have the bulk to set up rain for itself and must rely on teammates for the job. Agility should hardly be considered, as it is usually outclassed by Rain Dance and Swift Swim, and Ninjask is a better Pokemon for Baton Passing Speed boosts. Floatzel has the movepool to try a specially offensive set, but that is outclassed by Simipour, which has access to a greater Special Attack, better coverage, and Nasty Plot. Aqua Ring is a possible option on the Baton Pass set, but Floatzel usually prefers Taunt or extra coverage in that last moveslot. Flame Orb and Switcheroo is a gimmick, as it only burns once and at the end of the turn to boot, meaning Floatzel isn't taking weakened damage on the turn it Switcheroos.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Floatzel mostly relies on quick clean KOs or a setup opportunity in Bulk Up's case. Water-types with strong neutral or super effective moves, such as Ludicolo, Samurott, and Earth Power Seismitoad, generally make for the best counters, provided they can take Floatzel's other attacks well. Be warned that the same defensive Water-types that wall offensive Floatzel to hell and back, such as Alomomola, Earthquake Seismitoad, Frillish, and Wartortle, risk being turned into setup fodder for Bulk Up Floatzel. Grass- and Electric-types can easily dispatch Floatzel, but all Grass-types are slower than Floatzel, whereas only two Electric-type (Zebstrika and Electrode) outspeed Floatzel. Grass-types with more balanced defenses that can tank Ice-type attacks, such as Meganium, Ludicolo, and Cradily, are considerably better answers than Tangela and Roselia, who fear Ice Beam and Ice Punch, respectively. All other Electric-types bar Zebstrika and Electrode usually have to take at least one unresisted hit (which they usually can if at high health) before KOing Floatzel or utilize Choice Scarf to outspeed it, making them more of checks than counters. Eviolite Electabuzz can take a strong hit relatively well and OHKO back with Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Bulk Up sets are a bit trickier to stop as their incredible Speed means stopping them with Taunt, status, or a KO before Baton Pass is difficult. However, simply weakening Floatzel to the point where it can no longer set up can be considered sufficient. Choice Scarf users can threaten Floatzel with powerful neutral STAB or coverage moves, and priority can greatly whittle Floatzel down, do note that Bulk Up Floatzel is harder to take down this way. Floatzel cannot be burned thanks to Water Veil, but absolutely despises paralysis from Pokemon such as Thunder Wave Musharna and Liepard, and Body Slam Lickilicky, which neuters its greatest advantage in Speed and makes it dead weight.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>A mixed set offers the best overall combination of power and coverage against threats due to its ability to hit hard both physically and specially. Hydro Pump is Floatzel's strongest move against neutral targets, striking down Pokemon that Waterfall would fail to KO, such as Piloswine and Torkoal. Ice Beam is stronger than Ice Punch against targets of equal defenses and hits Tangela, Torterra, and Exeggutor much harder; however, Ice Punch still has its uses, as it 2HKOes Roselia and +1 Calm Mind Serperior even with no investment, which Ice Beam fails to do. Crunch maims Specially bulky Psychic-types, such as Gardevoir and Grumpig, that can easily take Floatzel's other attacks. Hidden Power Grass is used for opposing Water-types that would otherwise wall Floatzel, such as Seismitoad, Wartortle, and Alomomola, whereas Low Kick dents specially defensive Pokemon such as Lickilicky, Munchlax, Lapras, and Regice.</p> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment is necessary to give Floatzel the power it needs to hit threats hard, while max Speed takes advantage of Floatzel's greatest quality and major selling point over Simipour, which can pull off a similar set. Floatzel's higher Attack stat means it can still opt for a physically inclined set, which can be more consistent but is much easier to wall. If you choose to go that route, Return should go over Crunch if fully invested in Attack as it is Floatzel's best attack against opposing Water-types, though Crunch can still be used to have an easier time dealing with Misdreavus. Physical Floatzel can also make use of STAB Aqua Jet to pick off faster foes. Swift Swim is an option to allow Floatzel to combat rain teams, but it doesn't do too good at that job, and Water Veil gives Floatzel free switch-ins against burn-inducing moves. Teammates that can handle special walls such as Mantine and Regice for mixed Floatzel (such as mixed Eelektross), and physical walls such as Alomomola and Tangela for physical Floatzel (such as LumRest Exeggutor) are highly recommended. Floatzel's susceptibility to revenge killers and priority prompts the use of a bulky teammate such as Gurdurr, which deals with priority users such as Kangaskhan and Skuntank very well. Floatzel highly appreciates Grass-type partners, such as Tangela, Vileplume, Serperior, and Sawsbuck, as they resist its weaknesses and support it passively with their respective properties.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>When equipped with a Choice Band, Floatzel's Attack is boosted to very high levels. While this set looks like it suffers significant competition from the stronger Basculin, Floatzel has higher Speed and access to Switcheroo to set itself apart. Waterfall is Floatzel's main STAB and can strike down numerous targets. Ice Punch nails Grass-types and Dragon-types wanting to switch in on a resisted Waterfall and retaliate. Return is Floatzel's strongest attack against opposing Water-types and has more than enough power to take down Jynx. Floatzel's moves provide unresisted coverage bar Frillish and Shedinja, which are so rare that hitting them is irrelevant. Switcheroo, a unique move Floatzel has among Water-types, can steal the items of walls and lock them into one move, rendering them useless. This allows your set-up sweepers to set up freely, unhindered by the crippled wall's efforts to retaliate or survive. On the other hand, a Choice Band boosted Aqua Jet packs a punch and can pick off fast foes, although one must be wary about being locked into it and consider if Basculin is a better alternative for this due to its access to Adaptability.</p> <p>Because a Choice Band-boosted Return destroys Jynx, Crunch's only real use would be to hit Frillish and Shedinja and land a stronger hit on Exeggutor and Misdreavus, which isn't nearly as important as what Floatzel's other moves accomplish. Choice Scarf Floatzel could outrun other Choice Scarf users bar Zebstrika and run an Adamant nature, but Floatzel already has immense Speed, and its need for power makes this an ineffective strategy. Choice Band Floatzel, like other Choiced Pokemon, tends to switch out a lot, so having teammates that can deal with opponents that resist Floatzel's moves is ideal. For example, Jynx can deal with Water-, Grass-, and Dragon-types all at once and greatly appreciates setup opportunities granted by Floatzel's Switcheroo. Grass-types make for fantastic partners, as they provide a good safety buffer in case Floatzel screws up a prediction; dual screens Serperior and Meganium can improve Floatzel's durability to prolong its rampage, Leech Seed and Aromatherapy from Tangela and Vileplume can alleviate health and status issues, and Spikes Roselia and Cacturne help to nab certain OHKOs and 2HKOs. A possible route to take would be to employ Rain Dance on the team, allowing Floatzel the freedom to run Adamant, thanks to Swift Swim, to further augment its STAB attacks.</p>"
      },
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>While its frailty might indicate Bulk Up won't help Floatzel much at all, it has the tools it needs to make this work. Bulk Up not only raises Floatzel's respectable Attack, but also beefs up its Defense so that it can take physical hits better, which is important for this set to function. Baton Pass is also vital to Bulk Up Floatzel's success, allowing it to bestow its boosts to a fellow sweeper to initiate a sweep or just get away from danger without losing momentum. Waterfall is Floatzel's STAB move of choice, as it is a very reliable move. Floatzel also holds the distinction of being the only fully evolved Pokemon in NU that can Baton Pass Bulk Ups, so it can help out a variety of physical sweepers that either cannot boost for themselves or appreciate the Defense boost to prolong their rampage. Floatzel also has access to Taunt, which is incredibly useful to prevent status, phazing, healing, or opposing setup sweepers. The main selling point of Taunt is how it turns the tables on bulky Water-types that would severely wall Floatzel otherwise, notably defensive Seismitoad with Scald, Earthquake, and Toxic, meaning Bulk Up Floatzel can actually lure in opponents for it to set up on. Other Pokemon such as Wartortle, Alomomola, Misdreavus, and Torkoal are easy targets to start setting up Bulk Up on and pass the boosts. Note that Floatzel can take a good deal of damage from the likes of Scolipede's Megahorn even with Bulk Up boosts, which is usually your cue to pass the boost to a teammate that can handle the threat better.</p> <p>With max HP investment and a respectable base HP, Floatzel can set up Bulk Up on foes such as Samurott, Scolipede, Piloswine, and Kangaskhan with health to spare. Bulk Up makes up for the lack of Attack investment, as Floatzel reaches 370 Attack after just one boost, the equivalent of fully invested positive-natured base 119 Pokemon. Leftovers allow Floatzel to accumulate more boosts, though it's usually not more than two. However, pinch Berries, notably Salac Berry, can be used to grant an additional boost for teammates to receive, though Floatzel would be near dead if it does pass the berry boost. Water Veil has significant use on this set, as it prevents Scald and Lava Plume burns, further easing its setup. Obviously, teammates that appreciate the boosts are welcome. Scolipede and Drifblim resist Grass for Floatzel, and can even use Baton Pass as a way to backup Floatzel in case they encounter roadblocks such as Torkoal and Misdreavus, which can burn them; Golurk takes Electric-type attacks for Floatzel, and hurts things even more while being harder to bring down with physical attacks if passed to, and even stacks boosts with Rock Polish. In terms of defensive synergy, Grass-types are still there; Grass-types that can take advantage of the Bulk Up boosts, such as Swords Dance Jumpluff, Rock Polish Torterra, and Sawsbuck, are excellent partners. Sweeping with Floatzel itself is a perfectly viable option, though you'll need to sacrifice its great utility in Taunt. The usual EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe is best for optimum sweeping but leaves Floatzel too frail to set up more than one Bulk Up most of the time. Return offers great neutral coverage alongside Waterfall with very few Pokemon resisting both; Ice Punch can hit Grass- and Dragon-types hard at the cost of being walled by Water-types, though with Baton Pass, this is less of an issue. Note that even with Taunt, moves such as Dragon Tail, Circle Throw, and Clear Smog can still remove the boosts, so a powerful offensive partner, such as Golurk, Jynx, or Sawk, should generally be used to quickly dispatch these threats.</p>"

  "Drifblim": {
    "overview": "<p>Drifblim is the epitome of uniqueness: it has a one of a kind typing with atypical stats, abilities, and movepool. These traits might imply greatness, but competitive viability does not work that way. Despite boasting three immunities, including to the common Normal-type, and a gargantuan HP stat—the seventh highest in the game—, the same typing that blesses it with the aforementioned immunities also gives it a glaring weakness to Stealth Rock, Pursuit, and the BoltBeam combination, all of which are common in NU. Add in puny defenses that don't match its HP and you'll realize that Drifblim is being held back. However, despite all of these negative features, Drifblim has a great ability in Unburden, which, combined with its extensive movepool, Drifblim is able to exploit it with great success. You might not deem this purple balloon threatening, but it will easily prove otherwise.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Drifblim has a lot of options. Aftermath as an ability is pretty much outclassed by Unburden in all cases. A Baton Pass set is also possible using an EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD, passing either Calm Mind, Stockpile, or both, as well as high HP Substitutes. Unburden will let you use Baton Pass very quickly so you won't be killed before you do, but you must always keep in mind that the Unburden Speed boost cannot be passed. Drifblim can use both Sunny Day and Rain Dance with Weather Ball, so it's able to function well in a weather team, but it's slow and doesn't gain any good coverage, so it's not a good option. Drifblim has access to a wide variety of support moves, including Hypnosis, Trick, and Thunder Wave. It can even use Memento, forcing a switch out that will help a lot. You can use Flare Boost and a Flame Orb with Trick, a gimmicky option that gives you a boost and cripples an opponent; however, using Calm Mind with Unburden is usually a superior option. Despite Explosion's nerf, it can be used in a Memento-like fashion, dealing decent damage. Drifblim has also access to Recycle to reuse a Chesto Berry, but its defenses are too puny to effectively use this tactic against most offensive teams and it is wasting a precious moveslot that Drifblim needs to be effective. Drifblim also has access to Charge Beam which can be used against the plethora of Flying-types in NU and serves as a boosting move at the same time, but Calm Mind is generally better. It can even run Sucker Punch to deal with other Ghost-types on a physical set, but the moveslot for that is disputed by more useful moves and if an opposing Pokemon is sure to attack, it's just better to use Destiny Bond.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The Ghost- and Dark-types of NU are amongst the more perilous foes for Drifblim. Haunter, offensive Misdreavus, and Skuntank will all easily dispatch it before the Unburden boost. Its glaring Pursuit weakness is one of Drifblim's worst traits. Rotom-F and Rotom-S can scare Drifblim off before it gets an Unburden boost, taking little damage from Acrobatics and KOing it back, but they can be easily KOed by either Drifblim with Ghost Gem Shadow Ball or Destiny Bond. Alomomola can wall AcroBlimp ad infinitum, taking the hits and using Wish + Protect to heal back, plus using Toxic to wear Drifblim down. It can burn Drifblim with Scald as well; the most you can do to it is burn it. AcroBlimp will have trouble breaking through physical walls, such as Bastiodon, Regirock, and Golem, however, they can all be crippled easily by Will-O-Wisp or taken down by Destiny Bond. Bastiodon and Regirock commonly have ways to get around Drifblim; Bastiodon has Magic Coat and Roar to avoid Will-O-Wisp and remove Drifblim's Unburden boost, respectively; Regirock can Toxic Drifblim to avoid Destiny Bond, but is crippled by Will-O-Wisp regardless. Both Regice and Stunfisk can easily KO Drifblim with their STABs. They also happen to have high bulk to avoid being hit hard by Drifblim. Phazing Drifblim will make it lose Unburden for the rest of the battle as well as its Substitute, and if Stealth Rock is set up, Roar users such as Bastiodon and Lairon are very dangerous to Drifblim; they also resist Drifblim's STABs. Keep in mind that both main sets require different counters, so it's hard to safely switch a Pokemon into Drifblim until you know which set it's running, even though bulky Electric-types are good to go against any kind of Drifblim; Eelektross, Ampharos, and even Luxray can beat it, albeit risking a burn. Bastiodon is the safest choice to counter any Drifblim, resisting all of its common attacks and being able to phaze it. Finally, there's no single hard counter to Drifblim, as it can always use Destiny Bond and KO your counter, so be cautious.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "AcroBlimp": {
        "description": "<p>This set excels in its utility, spreading status with Will-O-Wisp, wearing down the opposing team with heavy blows, and luring its checks in to be burned. Drifblim can try to KO weak Pokemon such as Primeape with its first Flying Gem-boosted hit, gaining the Unburden boost. At this point, Drifblim will be the fastest Pokemon in the metagame, barring a few Choice Scarfers over base 100 Speed, and will prefer to attempt to sweep until it faints; it can even KO revenge killers with Destiny Bond. To take care of the physical attackers that threaten Drifblim, such as Skuntank and Tauros, Will-O-Wisp can be used on switch-ins to burn them. There are no hard counters to this set, as Will-O-Wisp will cripple almost anything and Destiny Bond will threaten to KO. Additionally, a fast Will-O-Wisp will deter physical attackers and common spinners such as Armaldo, the most common and dangerous one, which will find itself in a tough situation against an Unburden-boosted Drifblim.</p> <p>When getting Drifblim into the game, the first Acrobatics attack is crucial, since the Flying Gem works once and you don't want to waste it on an incoming Bastiodon or Regirock. What Drifblim does best is luring out foes such as Skuntank and Regirock to burn them, rendering them pretty much useless. Despite its positive traits, you must take into account that Drifblim doesn't really pack a punch after the first hit, and it will need team support and Unburden to do its job. You can choose to run a SubDisable set or sacrifice Substitute for Disable, since it will buy you turns to deal additional damage. If you manage to disable a Pokemon's most powerful attack against Drifblim, it will have to either switch out or take an Acrobatics hit.</p> <p>The chosen EV spread is used to outspeed base 70s with a positive speed nature and Speed tie with base 80s before the Unburden boost, letting it pick on as many Pokemon as possible to start disruption. Don't be bothered about the low damage output; you will be moving first and using Will-O-Wisp often. As Drifblim is a good team staple, Pokemon such as Swellow, Braviary, Zangoose, and Kangaskhan, which struggle against Rock- and Steel-types, will be glad to count on it to burn or KO them with Destiny Bond. Some teams pack both a physical wall and a Flying-type counter, so be cautious when using Drifblim and a Flying Pokemon. Given that Drifblim forces a lot of switches and can spinblock and cripple common Rapid Spin users, Pokemon that set up hazards work decently with it. Garbodor and Roselia team up nicely with Drifblim, setting up Spikes and Toxic Spikes on relatively easily. Armaldo can both set up Stealth Rock and use Rapid Spin reliably, so it is very welcome. Drifblim is an offensive spinblocker at best; it'll pressure spinners and hurt them so they can be taken out. It can switch into a Rapid Spin, but it can't switch in and out consistently; however, Drifblim can lure them in to then burn them or use Destiny Bond to get a troublesome Rock-type out of the game.</p>"
      },
      "SubCM": {
        "description": "<p>This set does mainly one thing: sweeping. If you manage to set up a Substitute on a Pokemon that can't hurt it, you can easily trigger Unburden, boost up with Calm Mind, and start delivering powerful attacks. You can switch on a foe you can scare out, such as Sawk or Roselia, set up a Substitute, and proceed to Calm Mind. After the first Ghost Gem-powered Shadow Ball, Drifblim's Speed is boosted by Unburden and it becomes nearly impossible to outpace, outspeeding many Choice Scarf users. Thanks to its three immunities and six resistances, you will find plenty of occasions to start setting up. Add in one or two Calm Mind boosts and Drifblim will hit hard. The only Pokemon that can reliably stop your sweep then are Regice and Skuntank, followed by Lickilicky, which can be dealt with with the help of teammates. Shadow Ball and Hidden Power Fighting used together grant perfect coverage, but Thunderbolt is generally more useful and will hit more Pokemon for more damage and helps defeat foes like Alomomola, Braviary, and Samurott; however, Hidden Power Fighting is super effective against Bastiodon and Lickilicky.</p> <p>You can use a ChestoRest set, using Calm Mind, Rest, Shadow Ball, and Hidden Power Fighting or Thunderbolt as a moveset, Chesto Berry as an item, and an EV spread of 252 Def / 140 SpA / 116 Spe with a Modest nature. The EVs allow Drifblim to outspeed Choice Scarf Sawk after Unburden. The Defense helps Drifblim to set up, since Calm Mind already covers Special Defense.</p> <p>Despite the potential Unburden brings, Drifblim needs team support to prevail. Generally, Skuntank and Regice are the main threats to this set. Fighting-types, namely Sawk and Gurdurr, the premier Fighting-types of NU, will help dealing with opposing Dark-type threats, and they can force out Regice. They also lure in physical walls, such as Alomomola, that Drifblim can use to set up on, as it will take little damage, can use Substitute to block status, and get at least a Calm Mind boost before firing off the first Shadow Ball. Colbur Berry Golurk can take a Sucker Punch and OHKO Skuntank with Earthquake, while other Rock- and Ground-types, including Golem or Gigalith, can dispatch it with their own Earthquakes. Gardevoir is a very good teammate; SubWisp can burn Drifblim's threats and LO + 3 attacks is a very powerful set that can KO or weaken many NU Pokemon. Piloswine will help take out both Rotom-F and Rotom-S, which threaten Drifblim with their powerful super effective attacks and superior Speed before Unburden. Lickilicky doesn't take much damage even from Hidden Power Fighting, so it's best to burn it or let a teammate deal with it before trying to set up with Drifblim. Putting it in KO range for Drifblim might be enough to balance the game in your favor. You can also use Rotom formes to Trick Lickilicky a Choice item or let Samurott or Skuntank Taunt it. A bulky Substitute will render its Dragon Tail useless as well.</p> <p>Stealth Rock support is mandatory, since it puts Regice in 2HKO range and Rotom formes can be OHKOed, which is a huge deal. Piloswine is an excellent teammate for this reason, as it can use its powerful STAB Earthquake to dispose of Regice and other Ice-type dangers that can obliterate Drifblim and reliably lay Stealth Rock. Rapid Spin support is not necessary to ensure its survival as Drifblim is meant to stay in and attempt to sweep, but it helps Drifblim to set up from full health. Most players will expect the AcroBlimp set on Drifblim, so you can use this to your advantage to scare out a Pokemon weak to Flying like Ludicolo, or a weakened slow Pokemon, to set up on the switch.</p>"

  "Lopunny": {
    "overview": "<p>The combination of Klutz and Switcheroo grants Lopunny the niche of reliably crippling the opponent's Pokemon of choice with its harmful held item, giving it a helpful role on offensive teams. In addition, its wonderful support movepool and great Speed give Lopunny many ways to disrupt the opponent and aid the team. However Lopunny's terrible offenses, Defense, and lack of recovery typically hinder it from usage, as most teams find trouble using a team slot for pure support. When used successfully, however, Lopunny's teammates have a field day setting up with full health and plowing through the opponent's crippled team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lopunny can run many riskier items in conjunction with Klutz, such as a Choice Band, Choice Specs, or Flame Orb, but they all have smaller target ranges that can prove underwhelming in some cases. Other than that, Lopunny's other options are pretty limited. It can run a dedicated Baton Pass set with either Work Up, Agility, or Substitute, but it is generally outclassed in that regard. If Lopunny ever wants to go offensive, it can use Fake Out, Return, the elemental punches, or Circle Throw, but these attacks would be situational at best with their underwhelming power. Rest can grant Lopunny some recovery, but it cannot do much with fewer moveslots. Limber could also be used for Leftovers recovery, but Switcheroo and Klutz are Lopunny's greatest niche. Copycat could be used to take advantage of the opponent's moves as well, such as Stealth Rock or Spikes.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Because a very small majority of Pokemon enjoy holding a Choice Scarf, countering Lopunny can be difficult. If you send in a Pokemon that isn't crippled by a Choice Scarf, they are most likely vulnerable to Thunder Wave and vice-versa. If you need a perfect counter, Zebstrika or Raichu is the best option, as they are not affected--and even benefit--from both moves. Even though Lopunny has few pure counters, it is easy to work around. Many Pokemon can switch in and plow through Lopunny's low Defense, such as Sawk and Primeape. Taunt users also shut down Lopunny; Serperior and Liepard are faster options. Other than that, status and entry hazards both do a great job at wearing Lopunny down due to its lack of recovery.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Klutz": {
        "description": "<p>Lopunny fits best on balanced and offensive teams because it aims to cripple the opponent's Pokemon, making it easier for setup sweepers to rampage. With Klutz, Lopunny can give any Pokemon its Choice Scarf with Switcheroo, making it easier for certain Pokemon to sweep because their only counter has the harmful item. Choice Scarf is the preferred item because of its consistency, as all walls despise being locked into one move and offensive Pokemon dislike the lack of coverage. Encore is another great disruptive move, as it stops setup sweepers and bothersome walls cold. When Lopunny is close to fainting, Healing Wish can be used, sacrificing Lopunny in hopes that a teammate can set up and beat the opponent. In the last slot, Baton Pass and Thunder Wave are both good options, as the former Pass can take advantage of all the switches Lopunny costs, and Thunder Wave can seriously cripple multiple Pokemon with little effort.</p> <p>With Lopunny's great Speed, it generally does not have problems crippling at least one Pokemon on the opponent's team, as it outspeeds the common base 95 Speed benchmark. Because of that, many Pokemon greatly enjoy Lopunny's support as they have a much easier time sweeping the opposition. Some great examples include Calm Mind Musharna, Nasty Plot Misdreavus, and Choice Band Golurk, as they all synergize well with Lopunny and love Thunder Wave support. Any Pokemon with immunities, such as Braviary or Metang, can partner well with it, as they can come in safely on a Pokemon locked into Earthquake or Toxic, respectively. Pokemon with Guts, such as Swellow and Ursaring, enjoy Baton Pass support, as they can get in safely and have their orbs activate. Because Lopunny is known for forcing switches, entry hazard setters such as Seismitoad, Golem, Garbodor, and Carracosta are all good choices to set up Stealth Rock or Spikes. Lastly, a move to greatly consider on Lopunny is Magic Coat, as it deflects harmful status moves and, more importantly, Taunt.</p>"

  "Purugly": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite its fat and clumsy appearance, Purugly is a fast Pokemon that is capable of scouting and revenge killing. U-turn and higher Speed sets it apart from Kangaskhan, while it is speedier and slightly bulkier than Liepard. Thick Fat also helps it to switch into certain moves such as Hidden Power Ice from Rotom-F. However, its poor movepool leaves it walled by Rock- and Steel-types, and while it is able to distinguish itself from its competition, most of the time, they aren't enough to justify its use over Kangaskhan, which has Scrappy, and Liepard, which has Prankster Encore and Pursuit. They are also both more powerful than Purugly and have better neutral coverage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Band set can be used, but this is done better by more powerful or bulkier Pokemon such as Kangaskhan and Lickilicky. Purugly can attempt to boost with Hone Claws or Work Up, but it is better off running the pivot set listed due to its poor coverage and average bulk; Purugly's strength, after all, lies in its scouting abilities. Knock Off is an option to cripple Misdreavus and Tangela switching into Purugly, but giving up a moveslot for this is hardly worth it. Purugly can set up weather with Rain Dance or Sunny Day, but Volbeat and Liepard are better for this role due to Prankster. Shadow Claw can be used to hit Ghost-types, but Purugly can already hit them with a super effective Sucker Punch if they attack, or simply switch to a counter with U-turn. Quick Attack is a more reliable priority option, but is weaker than Sucker Punch and less likely to revenge kill opponents. Hypnosis is usable, but it is a move with shaky accuracy that takes up a moveslot that could be better used to aid in Purugly's revenge killing.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>It isn't very easy to counter Purugly in the strictest sense due to the fact it can simply U-turn out of its counters. In any case, Pokemon with Rocky Helmet, such as Garbodor and Regirock, inflict residual damage onto Purugly that carelessly use Fake Out or U-turn. Alomomola and Tangela are capable of walling Purugly, but must be wary if it uses U-turn on the switch or uses an unexpected move such as Toxic. Ghost-types, such as Misdreavus and Golurk, are immune to Purugly's STAB moves and are able to threaten it with a burn from Will-O-Wisp or a powerful STAB Earthquake, respectively. Gurdurr is a great counter to Purugly, taking little damage from anything Purugly uses while threatening back with Mach Punch or Drain Punch to heal back all its HP. Slower Pokemon with switching moves can turn Purugly's attempt to gain momentum against it. For example, Musharna or Probopass can use Baton Pass or Volt Switch respectively after Purugly U-turns out, hence gaining the switch advantage while taking little damage in the process. Pokemon with a Choice Scarf can outspeed and defeat Purugly, but they must be careful of switching in directly; Fake Out + Sucker Punch can easily dent most fragile Choice Scarf users as well. Finally, strong priority users, including Kangaskhan and Samurott, can get around a weakened Purugly by picking it off before it can attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Purugly's blazing Speed allows it to check several fast but frail attackers reliably, and fare very well against offensive teams. U-turn allows Purugly to scout for switch-ins or escape a potential counter and switch into a teammate, keeping its team's momentum. Return is a reliable STAB move that works well with Purugly's high Speed. Fake Out and Sucker Punch form an amazing combination that takes down frail opponents which are faster than Purugly with ease. It should be noted that unlike Kangaskhan, Purugly is less reliant on Sucker Punch due to its high Speed which allows it to outspeed a majority of the unboosted metagame.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is required for Purugly to outspeed Liepard and Kadabra. Silk Scarf is the preferred item, as it boosts the STAB moves that Purugly is most likely to spam without detracting from its bulk, although a Life Orb could be used instead for the additional power. Taunt is a good option that defeats stall as well as offensive teams at the same time, but is hard to fit into the moveset. Super Fang is a possibility to surprise bulky walls that lack recovery, such as Regirock and Metang, but cuts into Purugly's revenge killing abilities. Toxic can be used to surprise Tangela and Alomomola, but is hard to fit onto the set.</p> <p>Due to Purugly's ability to use U-turn, good teammates are ones who can take advantage of Purugly luring in its counters before U-turning out to these teammates. Zebstrika and Electabuzz are great teammates for their ability to threaten Alomomola and Tangela, two would-be counters to Purugly, with Thunderbolt for the former and Overheat or Hidden Power Ice for the latter. Zebstrika and Electabuzz are also able to switch into Tangela's Sleep Powder without fear, thanks to Sap Sipper and Vital Spirit respectively. At the same time, these teammates also form a strong VoltTurn core with Purugly. Setup sweepers appreciate free switches into opponents they threaten out, for a safe setup. Gorebyss is a decent teammate, being able to take advantage of Purugly's U-turns out of the Rock-types it lures in, and it can proceed to set up Shell Smash or OHKO them. Similarly, Arbok and Misdreavus can set up on Sawk or Primeape Choice-locked into Close Combat after Purugly U-turns out of them. Exeggutor is also a good check to all of the above, while either setting up a Substitute or hitting the next switch-in hard. Skuntank is also a decent teammate, switching in on Ghost-types after Purugly uses U-turn, and eliminating them with Pursuit. Magnet Pull Probopass can remove troublesome Steel-types, allowing Purugly to use Return more freely. At the same time, it forms a nice VoltTurn core with Purugly. Purugly also appreciates the presence of entry hazards, particularly Spikes and Stealth Rock, on the opponent's side of the field, due to Purugly's nature of forcing switches with Fake Out and U-turn. Roselia and Garbodor are good candidates for Spikes setters. At the same time, they are also able to take hits from Fighting-types that threaten Purugly.</p>"

  "Skuntank": {
    "overview": "<p>Access to Sucker Punch and Pursuit coupled by access to Taunt make Skuntank one of the best offensive supporters in the tier. Its unique Poison / Dark typing is a blessing for it—not only does it allow Skuntank to serve as a near-perfect counter to the various Psychic- and Ghost-types that plague the tier, but grants it the ability to absorb Toxic Spikes as well. Its utility doesn't end there, as its ability Aftermath allows it to serve as an emergency check against various physical attackers such as Swellow and Zangoose. Unfortunately, Skuntank's rather average stats hold it back; it has mediocre bulk and only decent Attack. Skuntank does not fare well against the common Fighting- and Ground-types of NU; in general, it's not very hard to defeat outside of Psychic- and Ghost-types. Nonetheless, Skuntank performs many roles on a team, and it does them well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Perhaps the most interesting other option for Skuntank is a mixed attacker; a set consisting of Sucker Punch / Pursuit / Hidden Power Grass / Fire Blast can lure in many of Skuntank's traditional checks and defeat them. However, doing this makes Skuntank a much less reliable Pursuit trapper, its main role in the metagame. On that note, Skuntank can opt to use a fully specially offensive set with Acid Spray, but the loss of Sucker Punch alone often makes it inferior. Hone Claws can be used to boost Attack, but Skuntank is not built to sweep and often never finds the room to boost anyway. Substitute can block status in a similar fashion to Taunt, but Taunt allows Skuntank to support its team rather than just itself. Air Balloon is an interesting item choice; it makes trapping Golurk much easier while also avoiding any potential Hidden Power Grounds from the likes of Musharna or Exeggutor. Despite this, Black Sludge and Lum Berry are still far more consistent.</p> <p>Memento and Explosion can be useful for ensuring a teammate can come in safely, but Skuntank generally has too much utility to pass up by killing itself. Haze can deter setup, but is outclassed by Taunt. Toxic can be used in conjunction with Taunt to systematically break down walls, but Skuntank has no room to spare for Toxic and is generally outdone by Mandibuzz in this regard. Iron Tail, with a Steel Gem intact and potentially a Hone Claws boost, can lure in common checks such as Golem and Piloswine and OHKO them. However, it doesn't do anything outside of this and there is still no room for it. Skuntank can set up Rain Dance and Sunny Day, but doesn't benefit from either and is outdone by other Pokemon in this role. Finally, Punishment and Foul Play can be used as alternative Dark-type STABs, but Punishment is unreliable and Skuntank's natural power makes Foul Play unnecessary.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ground-types, barring Golurk, make for excellent counters, sporting the natural bulk to take all of Skuntank's common attacks and can OHKO with Earthquake. Fighting-types also serve as excellent answers to Skuntank, resisting its Dark-type STAB and pummeling it with Close Combat and Drain Punch. Gurdurr is an especially good switch-in to Skuntank, as Poison Jab can potentially activate Guts. Most hard hitters, such as Charizard and Samurott, can beat Skuntank one-on-one due to its relatively mediocre bulk. Bulky Rock-types, such as Regirock, can take Skuntank's attacks with relative ease and KO in return with Stone Edge or Earthquake. Alomomola and Weezing can also tank Skuntank's hits quite well, though they must be wary of Taunt. Steel-types make for good answers, as they resist Skuntank's STABs and can wear it down, though Metang must watch out for the occasional Fire Blast. Probopass in particular completely walls Skuntank and can defeat it with Earth Power or gain momentum with Volt Switch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Support": {
        "description": "<p>This set is Skuntank's best, providing a multitude of ways to support its team and disrupt momentum on the opposing side. With Sucker Punch, Skuntank can serve as a revenge killer, being able to easily pick off weakened threats thanks to Skuntank's satisfactory Attack stat. With the combination of Pursuit and Sucker Punch, Skuntank can put many Pokemon—particularly Psychic- and Ghost-types—into a checkmate position, either forcing them to attack and be hit with Sucker Punch or switch and be hit by Pursuit. Poison Jab serves as a reliable STAB, providing nice coverage against Fighting-types such as Sawk and Primeape while also having a nice 30% poison chance to wear down bulkier opponents. On the other hand, Crunch is a viable alternative; while it provides considerably less coverage than Poison Jab, it acts as a reliable Dark-type STAB when Sucker Punch and Pursuit aren't needed. Finally, the last slot is reserved for Taunt, providing a way to disrupt momentum and shut down setup. It also forms an excellent combination with Sucker Punch and Pursuit, forcing the opponent to either attack or switch and be attacked accordingly.</p> <p>The given EV spread achieves a few purposes. 80 EVs are put into Speed in order to outspeed Timid Gorebyss and either Taunt before its Shell Smash or simply attack it. Attack is maximized to get the most out of Sucker Punch and Pursuit. Finally, the rest of the EVs buff up Skuntank's special bulk. This EV spread is fairly variable; for example, 104 Speed EVs can be used to get the jump on standard Mandibuzz as well as positive-natured base 55s such as Exeggutor and Cacturne. Maximum Speed coupled with a Jolly nature allows for outspeeding Timid Gardevoir, Jolly Drifblim, and Adamant Sawk.</p> <p>Black Sludge is the preferred item here, providing passive recovery to allow Skuntank to switch in more often and do its job. However, Lum Berry is a perfectly viable alternative; it allows Skuntank to switch into Misdreavus's Will-O-Wisp and Musharna's Thunder Wave and trap them more efficiently. The most notable other alternative is Dread Plate; it allows Skuntank to 2HKO Musharna with Crunch and OHKO Charizard with Sucker Punch after Stealth Rock. Despite this, Black Sludge and Lum Berry are still generally preferred due to both providing a more reliable trap on the opponent.</p> <p>Ideal teammates for Skuntank include those that benefit from Skuntank's Pursuit trapping abilities; Fighting-types such as Sawk, Primeape, and Gurdurr are some of the best examples, and in return can threaten the Steel-types that give Skuntank trouble. Primeape gets a special mention, being able to lure in Psychic- and Ghost-types with U-turn so Skuntank can freely trap them. Ironically, these very same Fighting-types are some of Skuntank's greatest nemeses; Psychic-types make fantastic partners for defeating them and can form an effective Psychic / Dark / Fighting core that can trouble a large majority of the metagame. Finally, specially oriented Samurott is a good partner, as it can deal with pesky Ground-types and physical walls that Skuntank struggles to break.</p>"

  "Bronzor": {
    "overview": "<p>With respectable bulk thanks to Eviolite and one of the greatest defensive typing and ability combinations in NU, Bronzor is very easy to fit on most dedicated stall teams. When using Levitate, it is left with only a Fire-type weakness, which happens to be one of the least common attacking types in the metagame. This trait allows Bronzor to wall a giant chunk of NU, including many top threats that stall teams have trouble with, such as Serperior and Golurk. However, do not think you can just slap Bronzor on any stall team and expect a victory. It needs plenty of entry hazard, cleric, and defensive support to properly thrive, as its pathetic offenses, reliance on Rest for recovery, and tendency to be used as setup fodder will disappoint you.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Despite being blessed with an amazing movepool, Bronzor fails to use almost any of its moves effectively. It can use dual screens, but it cannot hold both Light Clay and Eviolite, making it outclassed. The same goes for Sunny Day and Rain Dance as well, as it cannot hold an Eviolite and a Heat Rock or Damp Rock at the same time. Bronzor has access to many great offensive moves such as Earthquake, Zen Headbutt, Charge Beam, Shadow Ball, and Grass Knot, but it lacks the offenses and moveslots to use any of them successfully. Some cool support moves Bronzor can learn are Imprison, Trick Room, Swagger, and Bulldoze, but they also have trouble fitting in one of its moveslots. The most viable other option Bronzor could use would be a Stealth Rock set, as the only way it would be forced out before it could set up is by Taunt or a rare Fire-type. However, Metang shares Bronzor's typing and has better offenses, so it is the preferable choice for this role.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The easiest way to beat Bronzor is to strike its weaker Special Defense before it can get any boosts with strong, super effective Fire-type attacks from Pokemon such as Charizard, Water-type attacks from Pokemon such as special Samurott, or Electric-type attacks from Pokemon such as Eelektross. If a few Calm Mind boosts have already been acquired, strong physical setup sweepers, including Swords Dance Samurott and Shell Smash Carracosta, are best to break through Bronzor's constant Defense stat. Other effective methods of shutting it down include Pokemon with Trick and a Choice item, such as Rotom-S; phazers (if Bronzor is not the last Pokemon left) such as Bastiodon, Riolu, Lickilicky, and Zweilous; and Taunt users such as Liepard, Misdreavus, and Samurott. In addition, Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon are immune to Toxic, but unless they have reliable coverage moves, they won't be able to hurt Bronzor.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Bronzor possesses the great ability to wall both sides of the offensive spectrum, with Calm Mind patching up its lacking Special Defense. Luckily, with its typing and Levitate, Bronzor usually finds no trouble setting up on common Pokemon such as Golurk, Piloswine, and Kangaskhan. It also makes Bronzor immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes and gives it a resistance to Stealth Rock, allowing it to switch in very often. Flash Cannon is the preferred STAB attack because of its safer coverage with all of the Dark-type Pokemon rampant in NU, but it won't do much damage unless Bronzor has acquired many boosts. Rest is the only recovery move it can learn, but luckily Bronzor's bulk is good enough that it can take multiple hits easily after setting up. Toxic is the better choice for the last moveslot, as even at +6, Bronzor's weak Special Attack keeps it from doing much damage to most bulky Pokemon. Sleep Talk can be used instead of Toxic so that it fares better against setup sweepers; with this, however, Toxic Spikes support is necessary and Bronzor misses out on poisoning Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate.</p> <p>Although Flash Cannon is the preferred STAB, if extra coverage suits you when facing Charizard, Water-types, and Electric-types, Psychic could be used instead, but a strong Fighting-type partner, such as Sawk, would be needed to eliminate the Dark-types that would wall Bronzor, and those Pokemon take away from the stall playstyle where Bronzor thrives. If Sleep Talk is used, Roselia or Garbodor is the best partner for setting up Toxic Spikes. With Rest, a cleric such as Audino or Misdreavus is highly recommended to wake it up. Bronzor will also need a Pokemon to take any immediate special attacks threatening it; Zweilous can take all of the Fire, Water, and Electric attacks that could break through Bronzor before it boosts.</p>"

  "Chatot": {
    "overview": "<p>Chatot is a rather bad Pokemon on account of its horrible stats and poor STABs. It is rather unique in the sense that it is the only specially based Normal / Flying type in the metagame and it sits just above the base 90 Speed benchmark, but that's about it. Chatot is a decent hit-and-run special attacker, but you are better off using one of the other Flying-types in NU for any other role.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Nasty Plot can be used, but Chatot is far too frail to set up. Encore is a decent option to let Chatot set up on resisted hits, but it still takes quite a lot of damage from them. Substitute lets Chatot avoid status and being revenge killed, but Chatot isn't staying on the battlefield for long and its Substitutes are easily broken even by resisted attacks. Taunt lets Chatot shut down walls, but it cannot do much to them anyway as it loses out on important coverage. Hidden Power Flying and Chatter are options for Flying-type STAB moves. Tailwind lets Chatot boost its team's Speed, but it cannot take a hit, so has few opportunities to set it up, and is better off attacking. Hidden Power Water lets Chatot get better overall coverage than Hidden Power Grass and Hidden Power Ground, but is ineffective against most targets as unlike the previously mentioned Hidden Powers, it does not hit its targets for 4x damage. Agility is another seemingly good option as a setup move, but again, Chatot is far too frail to utilize it efficiently.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Stealth Rock is a great way of countering Chatot, as it limits its ability to switch in repeatedly, which is especially important due to its use of U-turn. Due to Chatot's poor bulk and mediocre offenses, it is quite easy to counter with any relatively bulky Pokemon. Audino and Lickilicky can easily take a hit from Chatot and retaliate with a STAB move of choice. Probopass and Bastiodon can switch into most of its moves, but are hit hard by Hidden Power Ground. Defensive Misdreavus is barely 3HKOed by Heat Wave and can stall Chatot out with Will-O-Wisp and Pain Split. Faster Pokemon such as Swellow can easily OHKO Chatot, but must be wary of switching in. Regirock can take any hit from it bar Hidden Power Ground and retaliate with a STAB move of choice.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>This is the only set Chatot can use without being outclassed by its Flying-type brethren. With a nice Speed stat, access to U-turn, and a somewhat decent movepool, Chatot makes for a good attacker. Hyper Voice is Chatot's main STAB move, and with a Choice Specs equipped, it can hit pretty hard; for example, it is capable of 2HKOing threats such as Eelektross. Heat Wave is Chatot's move of choice against the likes of Metang, which is 2HKOed by it, as well as Ghost-types, which can take the other moves on this set easily. U-turn lets Chatot escape switch-ins that wall it cold and force them out with the appropriate Pokemon and helps maintain momentum. Hidden Power Ground is used exclusively for Probopass and Bastiodon and 2HKOes them.</p> <p>A Timid nature lets Chatot outrun 90 base Speed Pokemon and below, such as Kangaskhan and Zangoose. For alternative moves, Hidden Power Grass hits Golem, Seismitoad, and Carracosta harder, but Hidden Power Ground suffices against Golem and Carracosta and Hyper Voice has a good chance to 2HKO Seismitoad. Pokemon that appreciate Chatot's ability to weaken Steel-types, such as Arbok and Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary, make for fine partners. Choice Band Sawk is a great partner as well, as it can OHKO most Stealth Rock setters. Probopass and Eelektross form a decent VoltTurn core with Chatot, making them good options for partners as well. Skuntank is another good partner as it can trap Misdreavus; in return, Chatot can weaken Steel-types that are annoying for Skuntank to handle. Chatot can grant it a free switch by using U-turn as well.</p>"

With Eviolite equipped, it is also quite bulky physically. This lets it take strong attacks such as Choice Band Sawk's Close Combat and wear down their users with its ability, Rough Skin. However, Gabite's Attack is average, and it lacks reliable recovery. Furthermore, despite its good bulk, it lacks very important resistances to Normal- and Flying-type Pokemon's STAB attacks that most other Stealth Rock users possess. This makes it even more difficult to check these threats when using Gabite.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dragon Claw is an alternative Dragon-type STAB move that Gabite can use but it's quite weak and cannot even OHKO Altaria, a Pokemon that is weak to it. Roar and Dragon Tail are options Gabite can use to phaze the opponent, but it cannot do this consistently due to its lack of reliable recovery and setup sweepers such as Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary can still do huge amounts of damage to it at +0. Stone Edge hits Mandibuzz but has no use aside from that. RestTalk is Gabite's only means of recovery, but it is rather unreliable. Hone Claws can be used to boost Gabite's Attack, but both of Gabite's STAB moves are 100% accurate and it takes a lot of time to set up to any worthwhile point.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The best counter to Gabite is Bronzor. It resists the combination of Gabite's STAB moves, isn't 2HKOed by Fire Blast, and can set up Calm Minds while healing itself with Rest. Bulky Pokemon such as Torterra, Tangela, and Alomomola can easily take hits from Gabite, although the first two don't like taking a Fire Blast and all of them are crippled by Toxic. Misdreavus can burn Gabite and stall it out with Pain Split. Water-type Pokemon that carry Ice-type moves, such as Wartortle, Ludicolo, and Samurott, can dispose of Gabite with ease. Primeape can revenge kill Gabite with a super effective Ice Punch.</p>",

Toxic allows Gabite to cripple troublesome Pokemon such as Tangela, Alomomola, Mandibuzz, and Misdreavus. Alternatively, Fire Blast lets it 2HKO Leafeon, Tangela, and Exeggutor.</p> <p>With the given EVs, Gabite can 2HKO standard Armaldo, Eelektross, Samurott, and Metang with its STAB move of choice.

Thick Fat is also a great ability that patches up Munchlax's lack of resistances. In addition, it can take on Charizard and Haunter, two of the most prominent special threats in NU. Munchlax also has a usable base Attack along with a decent offensive movepool, which means it can be somewhat threatening to opposing Pokemon. However, Munchlax must rely on RestTalk for recovery, and with the fifth generation sleep mechanics, this can often lead to Munchlax being dead weight without cleric support. Munchlax also has a weakness to Fighting-type moves, which can make it bait for threats such as Sawk and Primeape. While its base Attack is decent, it is also not always going to deal sufficient damage. Lastly, Munchlax is the slowest Pokemon in NU, which means it will always have to take damage in order to deal some back.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There aren't many viable options for Munchlax to consider aside from the ones listed. The elemental punches can be used as coverage options, but they don't provide much aside from Ice Punch being able to maim Golurk. Zen Headbutt can be useful to pummel incoming Gurdurr and Sawk but has little utility otherwise. Munchlax has other offensive options such as Rock Slide, Gunk Shot, Seed Bomb, and Last Resort, but it can't put any of these to good use. Amnesia and Defense Curl could be used to raise Munchlax's defensive stats; however, these are more often than not a waste of a moveslot. Finally, Munchlax can use Counter to absorb physical hits and hit back hard with its high HP stat.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fighting-types such as Gurdurr, Primeape, and Sawk make great answers to Munchlax, as they are able to remove it quickly and Gurdurr also has enough bulk to take anything that Munchlax has to offer. Golurk can also take most of what Munchlax has to offer and retaliate for heavy damage. Trick users, such as Rotom-S, can remove Munchlax's Eviolite to make it much less of a threat. Because Munchlax has a middling Defense stat even with Eviolite, strong physical attackers such as Carracosta can deal heavy amounts of damage to it. Finally, wearing down Munchlax with constant entry hazard pressure will weaken it to the point where it cannot check any special threats.</p>",

Thick Fat also makes Munchlax one of the best answers to Charizard and allows it to stand out from its main competition, Lickilicky. This set is excellent on stall teams, but it is usually a hindrance on other kinds of teams due to it often causing its team to lose momentum. Rest serves as Munchlax's sole form of recovery, and while it is often a poor form of recovery with the sleep counter being reset upon switching, Munchlax has enough bulk to survive until it awakens most of the time. Sleep Talk is useful, as it allows Munchlax to accomplish something while asleep. Body Slam is used for a decently powerful STAB move that can also spread paralysis, which is useful against faster teams. Whirlwind prevents Munchlax from becoming setup fodder and also racks up entry hazard damage.</p> <p>The EV spread gives Munchlax enough special bulk to take repeated Focus Blasts from Charizard after Stealth Rock, while also giving it enough physical bulk to withstand Psyshock. Munchlax's high HP stat makes maximum investment unnecessary. A Careful nature and Eviolite are chosen to further enhance Munchlax's special bulk. Return is a usable option over Body Slam because, although the power difference is not significant, its lack of a paralysis chance can be useful, as fully defensive teams might prefer to spread poison and burn instead.</p> <p>Entry hazard support is advisable for Whirlwind to be utilized to its full effect; Garbodor, Roselia, and Golem are all ideal choices for this. Munchlax appreciates Heal Bell support in the event that it gets forced out of the battle while asleep; Misdreavus and Musharna are both excellent choices, and both have great synergy with Munchlax. The former is also very useful to spinblock the entry hazards that Munchlax appreciates so much. Alomomola is a great teammate for Munchlax as well, as it is able to pass massive Wishes for it and also wall physical attackers. Mandibuzz can also be useful as a secondary wall that can also phaze. Finally, Munchlax appreciates Rapid Spin support from Wartortle and Torkoal to prevent it from being worn down easily. Do keep in mind that Rapid Spin support is not required and generally support from Wish is enough to counteract the damage from entry hazards.</p>"

Body Slam serves as a strong and reliable STAB move, and the paralysis chance can be especially helpful for slower teams. Return, however, packs more power at the cost of the paralysis chance. Earthquake serves as a great coverage move, hitting Golem and Bastiodon for good damage. Pursuit is a useful move as Munchlax can trap Gardevoir with it and also take any attack from it with its solid special bulk. The last moveslot all depends on what role you need fulfilled. Toxic wears down bulkier targets such as Tangela and Alomomola, making them easier to deal with later on. Sleep Talk, however, allows Munchlax to absorb Sleep Powder from Tangela.

  "Carnivine": {
    "overview": "<p>Carnivine is one of many physical Grass-types in NU, but unfortunately, it is outclassed by the majority of these Grass-types, such as Sawsbuck and Leafeon. The combination of bad bulk and lack of reliable recovery reduces Carnivine's longevity severely, so it can't take many hits before falling. Carnivine is too slow to be effective as a sweeper, but its Speed does allow it to barely outspeed a couple of key threats, such as Golurk and Golem. As it is so slow and frail, Carnivine rarely has time to accomplish anything. Its typing is bad, as pure Grass leaves it vulnerable to many top tier threats, including Charizard and Pinsir. Not only does it lack reliable recovery, but it also lacks good coverage moves and has a generally lackluster movepool. It doesn't have access to any priority moves or useful coverage moves, which is a big blow for any usefulness Carnivine may have. However, Levitate is a useful ability, as it provides an immunity to Ground-types and lets Carnivine freely switch in while Spikes and Toxic Spikes are down without any drawbacks. Moreover, Carnivine does have access to Sleep Powder, which differentiates it somewhat from the other physical Grass-types in the tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Carnivine can choose to utilize Sleep Powder in conjunction with Stun Spore to create a dual powder set, but this is largely outclassed by other Pokemon such as Butterfree, which is faster and has access to U-turn. A special set is an option for Carnivine, as it has a decent Special Attack stat, only slightly lower than its Attack stat. However, it has no way to boost its Special Attack outside of Growth, and no special coverage moves outside of Sludge Bomb, so it is not as effective as a physical set. Carnivine can opt for a mixed set to surprise its usual counters, and when used in the sun can get a free +2 in both Attack and Special Attack from Growth. The purely physical set is usually better because it doesn't rely on weather, and is more reliable as a whole. Life Orb can be used as the item for extra power, but Carnivine is OHKOed by too much, and requires a Focus Sash to work at its full potential. Carnivine also has the option of running a Substitute + Leech Seed set, like many other Grass-types. It is not very effective, however, as Carnivine has low Speed and no way of dealing with opposing Grass-types that are immune to Leech Seed. Synthesis can be used to heal Carnivine, but it is too frail to make effective use of the extra health, and generally can't afford to waste a turn healing. Crunch is an interesting coverage move that can be used to hit Psychic- and Ghost-types, but Power Whip will usually hit harder, so only use Crunch if you really don't want to rely on Power Whip's accuracy.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Any decently powerful super effective move will most likely OHKO Carnivine thanks to its low defenses, and that chance is further increased if the move is boosted by STAB. Any strong STAB move in general will do a lot of damage, such as any Fighting-type's Close Combat / Drain Punch, or a Psychic-type's Psychic. Steel-types resist both Power Whip and Return, and can deal with Carnivine easily, especially considering the fact that they have high defense and can take a hit or two with ease. Charizard can OHKO Carnivine with either of its STAB attacks, though it is OHKOed by a +2 Return after Stealth Rock. Physically defensive Pokemon such as Misdreavus, Mandibuzz, and Torkoal can take any hit Carnivine wants to throw at them and burn Carnivine to put a full stop to its potential sweep or simply wall it to death. Carnivine also relies on Sleep Powder to be even mildly threatening, so Sap Sipper Miltank and Sawsbuck do well as they can absorb both Sleep Powder and Power Whip, while Miltank doesn't take much damage from Return either.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>With its Attack boosted, Carnivine can do a good amount of damage, but due to its low defenses and Speed, it often doesn't get a chance to set up. Therefore, this is the best and only remotely viable set Carnivine can run. Swords Dance is used to boost Carnivine's mediocre Attack stat so that it can hit decently hard. Power Whip is the primary STAB option, although it's inaccurate, it's strong, which helps make up for Carnivine's low Attack. Sleep Powder can put an opposing Pokemon to sleep if it hits, which can give Carnivine an opportunity to set up a Swords Dance. Return provides good neutral coverage with Power Whip, but no super effective coverage unfortunately. It is still the best choice however, since Carnivine doesn't have access to any useful coverage options.</p> <p>Focus Sash is the chosen item to ensure that Carnivine can take at least one hit from something, and the item's use is made more effective by Carnivine's immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Leading with Carnivine or having a Pokemon that can keep Stealth Rock off the field is the best way to keep Carnivine's Focus Sash intact. Good teammates for Carnivine include Pokemon that beat bulky Steel- and Poison-types, such as Seismitoad, Golurk and Golem. Grass-, Flying-, and Fire-types are also a nuisance, so Pokemon such as Samurott and Ludicolo are useful teammates. Carnivine really likes to have a free switch due to its sub-par defenses. Slow pivots such as Probopass and Musharna can be very helpful for this, as they take damage before using Volt Switch or Baton Pass respectively, causing Carnivine to take no damage. While the EVs may seem simple, having 252 EVs in Speed along with a Jolly nature lets you outspeed max Speed Adamant Golurk so you can get in a Power Whip before it attacks you. Trick Room support could be used alongside Carnivine, as Carnivine is slow, so it can \"outspeed\" the majority of Pokemon in NU. 0 Speed EVs and IVs with a Brave nature should also be used when used with Trick Room. Bullet Seed can be run to beat Sturdy and Focus Sash users such as Kadabra and Golem, respectively. Carnivine can also choose to run a bulkier spread without Focus Sash, which is equally as mediocre as Carnivine with Focus Sash.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Lumineon is terrible in NU; it has no offensive pressure, low defensive stats, no reliable recovery, and only okay Speed. With such a wide movepool, one would think Lumineon has much to offer for the tier; alas, it does not. Lumineon's only remotely viable set revolves around supporting the team with either Rain Dance or Tailwind, but in both cases, it is still extremely outclassed. Other Pokemon should definitely be considered before choosing Lumineon for your team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lumineon can use an Eject Button to switch out immediately after it sets up Rain Dance or Tailwind, which grants an incoming sweeper more turns to make use of the situation, but this scenario is situational and unreliable. Scald is also an option simply because of its burn chance, but Lumineon prefers to use physical attacks because U-turn is very important. Lumineon has access to many other offensive moves, such as Ice Beam, Signal Beam, and Hidden Power, but its offensive stats are too low to put any of them to good use. Aqua Ring can be used in a stall situation with Toxic and Protect, but Lumineon is frail enough to be OHKOed by many threats. Psych Up is an option, but Lumineon is too weak to accomplish much even with matched boosts. Lastly, Lumineon has access to Swagger, but the move is luck-reliant and therefore unreliable. Then again, Lumineon needs luck to accomplish much anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The best way to truly counter Lumineon is to stop it from setting up, so positive-natured base 85 Speed Pokemon and up that can KO Lumineon, such as Jolly Sawk, Choice Band Primeape, Serperior, most Electric-types, and most Choice Scarf Pokemon are going to accomplish the job. Nevertheless, even if it sets up, most strong neutral or super effective STAB attacks will KO Lumineon as well. Protect is great for stalling Rain Dance or Tailwind turns, considering how limited the moves are already. Clerics, such as Audino and Lickilicky, can eliminate the poison Lumineon spreads and can sponge attacks from most rain sweepers as well.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Lumineon has the ability to set up Rain Dance and Tailwind, both of which allow its teammates to sweep the opposing team much more easily due to their extra power and/or Speed. U-turn allows Lumineon to pivot to the most appropriate teammate much more reliably than it could by just switching out. Waterfall is Lumineon's STAB move of choice due to its reliable accuracy, decent power, and nifty flinch rate; however, Lumineon still will not do much damage. Lastly, Toxic is a source of constant damage that allows Lumineon to cripple walls that can sponge its partner sweepers' attacks.</p> <p>Damp Rock and Swift Swim should be used if Lumineon is using Rain Dance to support the team, while Leftovers and Storm Drain are most helpful on Tailwind sets.</p> <p>Good partners for when Lumineon uses Rain Dance are Swift Swim sweepers, such as Ludicolo, Seismitoad, and Mantine, all of which can spam their high-powered STAB attacks with little to fear. Electric-types, such as Zebstrika, can take the Electric-type attacks aimed at Lumineon and use a high powered Thunder under rain. Lumineon can team with Liepard or Volbeat, as their Prankster ability is much better for setting up rain. Good partners for when Lumineon uses Tailwind are Choice Band Sawk, Rampardos, Golurk, and Charizard, all of which pack great power but are easily revenge killed outside of Tailwind.</p>"

  "Lickilicky": {
    "overview": "<p>Lickilicky has a wide supportive movepool containing Wish, Heal Bell, Dragon Tail, and more allowing it to act as an effective cleric. Along with these moves, Lickilicky has a high HP stat, meaning the Wishes that it passes off can heal most offensive Pokemon almost to full, and excellent bulk on both sides, which makes it one of the hardest clerics to wear down in NU. Lickilicky isn't limited to only being defensive however, as it has a large offensive movepool, including Swords Dance, a wide special movepool, rare moves such as Power Whip, and even a STAB Explosion. Despite these perks, its low Speed is a bit saddening, and its weakness to Fighting moves, while not as significant in NU as higher tiers, is still bad because of how common Sawk, Primeape, and Gurdurr are. However, Lickilicky is a versatile Pokemon, and is both a dangerous defensive and offensive threat worthy of considering for any team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lickilicky has a wondrous movepool, consisting of moves such as Ice Beam, Fire Blast, Surf, and Thunderbolt. While these can all do a bit of damage, Lickilicky's average Special Attack usually requires a Life Orb, which hurts Lickilicky's great bulk. An Expert Belt could be used instead, but then the power of Lickilicky's STAB becomes lacking. Curse may at first seem like an excellent option for Lickilicky, and may eventually make it almost unbreakable, but its main problem stems from its lack of recovery, because Wish is incompatible with Curse. It therefore becomes outclassed by Miltank, which boasts that and Scrappy. Work Up can also boost Lickilicky's average Attack and Special Attack, but it is hard to sweep with it due to Lickilicky's bad Speed stat. Toxic can wear down walls, but its usage is limited on Lickilicky as it is usually pressed for moveslots. Knock Off is a similar case, as it gets rid of the items of walls but often cannot find space on Lickilicky. Weather moves can work well with Lickilicky due to its great bulk, but there exist many other ways to set up the weather. Finally, Lickilicky has access to Belly Drum, which makes Lickilicky hard to wall, but its Speed once again works against it. It is noteworthy, however, that a Life Orb-boosted +6 Explosion is so powerful that it OHKOes even 252/252+ Regirock without entry hazards.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Gurdurr stands out as the best counter to Lickilicky, as it can use it as setup fodder, heal a lot of its HP with Drain Punch, and take very little damage from any of Lickilicky's moves. Taunt is also a great way to shut down Lickilicky in most cases, making it unable to support its team or set up a Swords Dance. Misdreavus is an example of a Pokemon that can use Taunt, and will wall almost anything Lickilicky can throw at it. SubDisable Haunter is also capable of walling Lickilicky almost completely, due to its immunities. Most of the time, if Haunter Disables the correct move, Lickilicky is literally incapable of damaging Haunter. Drifblim is a similar case if it decides to run Disable, although even without Disable, Lickilicky generally does not run moves that can do very much damage to it. Sawk doesn't enjoy getting paralyzed by Body Slam, but it can OHKO Lickilicky with Close Combat. Without a boosting item, Primeape may not be able to OHKO Lickilicky at full health, but a slightly damaged one will get OHKOed by Primeape's Close Combat. Throh, although uncommon, can easily set up against Lickilicky, and if it gets paralyzed by Body Slam, Guts kicks in and it can hit harder. Lickilicky's defensive set does not hit very hard, meaning that it can become setup fodder for sweepers such as Shell Smash Carracosta and Bulk Up Braviary if it cannot phaze them, although Carracosta must watch out for Power Whip. Finally, as Lickilicky typically cannot hit hard and doesn't usually carry Toxic, physical walls such as Tangela and Regirock are decent ways to take it down, and the two in particular have Leech Seed and Drain Punch, respectively, to heal themselves while wearing Lickilicky down. However, note that most weaker walls are made into setup fodder from Lickilicky's Swords Dance set, and walls weak to Grass need to be careful about boosted Power Whips, which can do quite a bit of damage.</p>",

      "Support": {
        "description": "<p>With the third biggest Wishes in the tier, only behind Alomomola and the fairly irrelevant Wigglytuff, and access to Heal Bell, Lickilicky is arguably the best cleric in NU. While Alomomola has a much higher HP stat and Regenerator, Lickilicky can take on special attackers including Kadabra, Altaria, Gardevoir without Focus Blast, Regice, and more with ease while still taking on physical hits well enough. Similarly, unlike Audino, which has similar support moves, it can hit the foe back with a decently powerful move due to a decent Attack stat, and is also overall more bulky.</p> <p>Wish is an excellent support move, as it provides Lickilicky with a way to heal 50% of its HP and also a very large portion of its teammates' HP stats, especially those that do not invest in HP, namely offensive Pokemon. Heal Bell clears status away from the team, which means that not only can it save its teammates from an untimely burn or paralyze, but it's also not worn down by Toxic like other defensive Pokemon nearly as easily. Protect ensures that Wish heals Lickilicky, making it much harder for special attackers to get through it. Finally, Body Slam is preferred as the attacking move, as it can do decent amounts of damage and it also has a chance of paralyzing the foe, which can make faster opponents almost useless. Dragon Tail is a usable alternative, as it can phaze the foe while not being affected by Taunt and gives Lickilicky a way to hit Ghost-types. However, be warned that it is less than half as strong as Body Slam, and will fail to break many Substitutes.</p> <p>While it may seem strange to put Own Tempo over the clearly superior Cloud Nine, Wish and Cloud Nine are incompatible, due to Wish being from a Gen 3 event and Cloud Nine being from the Dream World. Ultimately, Own Tempo is far better than Oblivious, as it at least makes it easily take on the incredibly annoying Liepard, which often runs Swagger. Return is usable over Body Slam or Dragon Tail because it puts a bit more of a sting on foes, but due to its lack of a side effect, the other two moves are more useful from a utility standpoint. If Heal Bell is not needed, both Dragon Tail and Body Slam can be used.</p> <p>Being a cleric, Lickilicky does not need very much support, and instead usually supports its own team. Wish is useful for practically any Pokemon that lacks instant recovery, such as Regirock and Regice, as it ensures that they will not be worn down as easily. Misdreavus appreciates Wish as well due to its low HP stat and unreliable recovery. In return, Misdreavus can wall Fighting-type Pokemon such as Sawk and Gurdurr, which can otherwise destroy Lickilicky or use it as setup fodder. Offensive Gardevoir is a similar case, and while Sawk tends to do a lot of damage to it thanks to its low physical bulk, it does appreciate Wish healing almost all of its HP and can easily OHKO Fighting-types. Skuntank also makes a good partner, as it can deal with Ghost-types such as Haunter and Misdreavus that Lickilicky can potentially be unable to damage. Skuntank also benefits from Wish and Heal Bell to capitalize on its decent bulk and remove burns, allowing it to perform its role for longer. Finally, if Dragon Tail is used, entry hazard support is helpful to damage the foes as Lickilicky phazes. Pokemon with Spikes, such as Garbodor and Scolipede, make good partners, as both resist Fighting moves and lack instant recovery, meaning Wish will help them out a lot.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>This set may look strange and complicated at first glance, as it uses Swords Dance, seems to be emphasized on bulk rather than offense, and hardly invests in Attack at all. However, Lickilicky's enormous bulk allows it to set up Swords Dance extremely easily against walls such as Tangela and Alomomola, and after a few Swords Dance boosts, which is fairly easy to do thanks to its lack of weaknesses on the special side, it will be hitting its opposition hard. Substitute may seem like an odd choice on this set, but Lickilicky's Substitute is notoriously hard to break with walls, meaning that Lickilicky essentially can set up another free Swords Dance. For the main STAB, Body Slam is the better option in most cases due to its side effect of paralysis, which can allow it to finish off a foe that is normally faster that may try to switch in. However, Return offers more power. Finally, Power Whip is a powerful move to use alongside Lickilicky's Normal STAB, and allows it to get past foes such as Alomomola, Golurk, and Golem. In addition, most Steel-types, such as Bastiodon and Probopass, are hit for neutral damage from the move, meaning they cannot completely wall Lickilicky.</p> <p>The given EV spread outspeeds Alomomola, gives Lickilicky 101 HP Substitutes, and allows these Substitutes to survive Choice Scarf Rotom-S's Volt Switch and many other attacks. The rest of the EVs are thrown into Attack. A much simpler EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe can be used for more of an emphasis on power, but there are many Normal-types and other Swords Dance users that give Lickilicky competition in this role, as its amazing bulk is what makes this set unique. To deal with Steel-types that resist Power Whip, such as Metang and Mawile, Earthquake is usable, and it still hits Rock-types hard enough. However, it then misses out on the ability to hit Golurk hard and also leaves Lickilicky completely walled by Misdreavus, Drifblim, and Haunter. Finally, although Cloud Nine isn't that helpful, it usually comes in handy more often than Lickilicky's other abilities.</p> <p>This Lickilicky doesn't need very much support due to how easy it can be to set up, but two types that remain dangerous to Lickilicky are Fighting- and Ghost-types, the former of which can easily power through it and the latter of which can wall it easily or give it the dangerous burn. For Fighting-types, ironically, Ghost-types such as Misdreavus make excellent partners due to their immunity to Fighting moves. Misdreavus in particular has Heal Bell to heal off an untimely burn or Toxic. Poison-types such as Garbodor and Scolipede can also take Fighting-types moves and can also absorb Toxic Spikes—although they are rare, they make it hard for Lickilicky to pull off a sweep. As for Ghost-types, Skuntank can threaten Misdreavus, Haunter, and Drifblim with its arsenal of Dark-type moves such as Pursuit, Crunch, and Sucker Punch, and the fact that Golurk threatens Skuntank doesn't matter that much because Lickilicky's Power Whip does plenty of damage to it already.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Considering it has an average base 85 Attack, running a Choice Band may seem like an odd choice at first glance. However, Lickilicky has numerous advantages over other Normal-types that make it a viable option. Firstly, Lickilicky's 110/95/95 defenses let it take hits very well, taking hits even better than Kangaskhan by a fair amount. Lickilicky also has two key moves in Power Whip and Explosion, and because it is the only Normal-type to learn these two powerful moves, it can hit certain targets harder than any of its competition. Return is the main STAB move used here, dealing a great amount of damage while not detracting on Lickilicky's bulk in any way. Power Whip is capable of 2HKOing Alomomola and Regirock, as well as OHKOing Golurk, all three of which most Normal-types struggle against. Earthquake covers Steel-types such as Metang for lots of damage, which is useful as they resist everything on this set. Finally, Lickilicky is the only Pokemon in the game, other than Smeargle, to have access to a STAB Explosion. Even with the power drop from the transition to BW, it is the strongest single move in the entire game, and only the bulkiest of Pokemon are capable of surviving the hit; even Musharna gets OHKOed by the move.</p> <p>The given EVs allow Lickilicky to outspeed Alomomola and other Pokemon that have a base 65 Speed. Cloud Nine is useful on this particular Lickilicky due to its great bulk, allowing it to take non-weather boosted attacks and retaliate with the appropriate attack. Because Earthquake most likely won't be used as much as the other moves, Ice Punch or Hammer Arm can be used to hit Drifblim or opposing Lickilicky and Miltank, respectively, harder, but hitting Steel-types such as Metang is important, and these moves end up being situational. Double-Edge can be used over Return to hit general targets for more damage, but there are two issue regarding this change—one is the fact that the recoil damage takes a toll on Lickilicky's bulk, and the other is that Cloud Nine becomes illegal with this set. If Double-Edge is used, Own Tempo should be used because it comes in handy when against Liepard.</p> <p>Even though Lickilicky can deal a lot of damage to Golurk, Ghost-types immune to Earthquake, such as Misdreavus, Drifblim, and Haunter, can switch into three of the four moves on this set without fear of taking damage, and even then, Power Whip cannot do very much damage to them, and Haunter can Disable the move entirely. For this reason, Dark-types or Pokemon with Pursuit such as Skuntank make good partners to take them out of the battle. Although Lickilicky has Earthquake, Steel-types such as Metang are nuisances. Ground-types such as Golurk and Seismitoad can generally hit them for a lot of damage. It is notable that, once Steel- and Ghost-types are eliminated, Lickilicky's Explosion can be used more freely, as Power Whip already hits Rock-types for enough damage to dissuade them from switching in. Due to Power Whip, Lickilicky can lure in Rock-types expecting a defensive set and hit them hard with the move, which could leave the foe open to other offensive Normal-types such as Swellow and Tauros, making them good partners.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Probopass is one of the better defensive pivots in the tier due to its combination of great bulk and numerous resistances. Between its access to Stealth Rock and a slow Volt Switch, it finds many opportunities to support its teammates. It also has two useful abilities in Sturdy and Magnet Pull, both of which Probopass can use effectively. Sadly, while Probopass's typing is one of its greatest assets, it's also its greatest downfall; a 4x weakness to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks compounded by a 2x weakness to Water-type moves is a heavy burden to bear. Probopass's longevity is further hindered by its lack of reliable recovery, and due to its low offensive presence, it can often be used as setup bait.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt gets a mention, allowing Probopass to prevent setup and Toxic stall more effectively. However, for the most part, Probopass is far too slow to make use of it. Magic Coat also prevents setup similarly to Taunt, but it requires a bit of prediction to work. Pain Split is Probopass's only form of recovery outside of the undesirable Rest, but Probopass doesn't have the room for it on any set. Magnet Rise is a more gimmicky option that can remove Probopass's Ground-type weakness, but it is too slow to pull this off. Probopass can utilize Gravity alongside its slow Volt Switch to support its teammates, but it doesn't benefit from Gravity itself and Gravity is generally a gimmicky strategy. Endure is a notable move, as when combined with a Custap Berry it allows Probopass to get around Mold Breaker Sawk and set up Stealth Rock. Unfortunately, Probopass's severe four-moveslot syndrome prevents it from making use of Endure. Thunderbolt can be used, but Volt Switch has more utility. Probopass can set up Sunny Day, but there are better Pokemon for this role. Finally, RestTalk is not recommended as a method of healing, being unreliable and forgoing much utility.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Probopass is fairly easy to beat if you target its three glaring weaknesses; any Pokemon with a strong Fighting-, Ground-, or Water-type move can easily smash it into pieces. Sawk gets a special mention in this regard, bypassing Sturdy thanks to Mold Breaker and OHKOing Probopass with Close Combat. Probopass lacks decent offensive presence; because of this, setup sweepers such as Serperior and Samurott can easily take advantage of it. Misdreavus also gets a mention, being able to Taunt Probopass and wear it down via Will-O-Wisp. In general, residual damage does well at wearing down Probopass and limiting its walling capabilities. Finally, if worst comes to worst, simply pounding away at Probopass with strong attacks will eventually take it down as it lacks reliable recovery.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of all of Probopass's useful qualities, namely its excellent bulk, Rock / Steel typing, access to Stealth Rock, and ability to gain switch advantage with Volt Switch. Thanks to Sturdy, Probopass is almost guaranteed to set up Stealth Rock unless it is matched up against Mold Breaker users such as Sawk, Pinsir, or Fraxure. Power Gem is the chosen STAB move because of the utility it provides, allowing Probopass to deal with the likes of Rotom-F, Kadabra, and Charizard, none of which can do much back without a super effective coverage move. Additionally, the combination of Power Gem and Toxic allows Probopass to effectively counter Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary, a Pokemon that would otherwise set up all over it. Toxic also allows Probopass to counter Musharna, stalling out Heal Bell's PP and avoiding being poisoned by Synchronize thanks to its Steel typing. Finally, a slow Volt Switch ensures that its teammates get in safely, making it great support for frail Pokemon such as Charizard and Zangoose.</p> <p>56 EVs are put into Special Attack to allow Probopass to OHKO Charizard with Power Gem. The rest of the EVs emphasize Special Defense, allowing Probopass to make better use out of its various specially oriented resistances. A physically defensive spread can be used, but Probopass's weaknesses to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks make this undesirable. Flash Cannon is stronger than Power Gem and lets Probopass hit Rock-types harder, but the damage output is still rather average coming off of Probopass's poor uninvested Special Attack stat. Protect is another option to be considered, allowing Probopass to Toxic stall more efficiently. However, using Protect means forgoing a more useful move in its place. Finally, Thunder Wave can be used over Toxic, helping against more offensive teams. However, Probopass needs Toxic to beat Musharna and Braviary, which could otherwise set up to +6 with Calm Mind and Bulk Up, respectively, and proceed to sweep the rest of your team.</p> <p>Probopass absolutely requires partners to cover its glaring weaknesses to Fighting-, Ground-, and Water-type attacks. On that note, Musharna is an outstanding partner, resisting Fighting-type attacks and forming an excellent defensive core with Probopass. Vileplume and Roselia can handle most Water-types with relative ease, with the former also helping to deal with Fighting- and Ground-types and the latter setting up Spikes. Finally, Swellow is a good offensive partner, as it can take advantage of Probopass's slow Volt Switch to activate its Toxic Orb and forms a solid VoltTurn core with it. Probopass works best on teams that can take advantage of its great utility and compensate for its weaknesses; because of this, balance and bulkier offensive teams are where it fits in best.</p>"
      },
      "Trapper": {
        "description": "<p>Courtesy of its useful Magnet Pull ability, Probopass is capable of running an offensive pivot set very well. This set specializes in trapping and removing Steel-types from the field—Pokemon such as Metang, opposing Probopass, and Bastiodon are renowned for their great bulk and numerous resistances, and Probopass can effectively clear the path of all of them. Stealth Rock is there as always for support, as Probopass finds many opportunities to set it up; however, do note that due to the lack of Sturdy and investment in bulk, this set is not as reliable at setting up Stealth Rock in contrast to more defensive variants. Power Gem is the preferred STAB, hitting Flying-types and Scolipede harder than any other move in Probopass's arsenal. Flash Cannon can be used instead, being Probopass's strongest STAB and best way to hit Rock-types; however, aside from this, it does not add much to Probopass's coverage. Earth Power is mainly used for damaging the Steel-types that Probopass traps while also providing solid coverage alongside Probopass's STAB. Finally, Volt Switch is there to gain momentum, using Probopass's low Speed to its advantage.</p> <p>The given EV spread allows Probopass to outspeed Modest Torkoal and KO it with Power Gem. It also maximizes Probopass's power, allowing it to defeat trapped Steel-types easier. Finally, the remaining EVs are put into bulk to increase its longevity. There aren't many reasons to deviate from this spread, as more Speed is unnecessary and more bulk doesn't avoid any relevant 2HKOs. Air Balloon is the preferred item choice, letting Probopass avoid any random Earthquakes from Metang and Earth Powers from opposing Probopass. Leftovers is another option, providing passive recovery, but do note it makes Probopass more vulnerable to Ground-type moves. Hidden Power Grass or Ice could be used, hitting Ground-types harder than any other move. However, Probopass does not have the room for either, and it is too slow to make use of them anyway.</p> <p>Any Pokemon that hates Steel-types loves Probopass as a partner; Swellow is despises opposing Steel-types and can even form a VoltTurn core with Probopass. Calm Mind Musharna loves having Steel-types removed, and in return it can easily deal with the Fighting-types that trouble Probopass. This set finds its home on more offensive teams as a pivot and Steel trapper; Probopass has the most utility on these team archetypes for obvious reasons, and it gets its job done well.</p>"

Rotom-F can also run a Substitute set that capitalizes on the switches it forces, pressuring foes with its STAB moves and utility movepool with options like Pain Split and Will-O-Wisp. It also has nice defensive utility, being an Electric-type immune to Ground-type moves. While Rotom-F’s STAB combination is nearly unresisted, specially bulky Pokemon like Piloswine, Miltank, and Regice can give it significant difficulty breaking through these threats. Its Stealth Rock weakness and middling Speed tier cause it to be worn down and get picked off by priority users and faster Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Gurdurr, and Choice Scarf Primeape. Rotom-F also relies on heavily on its inaccurate Blizzard to do most of its wallbreaking, making it somewhat unreliable.</p>",

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-S is blessed with decent stats across the board and an expansive movepool to back them up. Primarily known for its Choice Scarf set, Rotom-S has lost some limelight to Primeape and Charizard due to their higher Speed and greater coverage. Nevertheless, its great offensive typing offers a STAB Volt Switch, and its Speed covers enough significant threats that Rotom-S can see some usage as a Choice Scarf user. In addition, its typing covers many physical threats, so Rotom-S can use its large movepool to function as a wall or pivot, showcasing its versatility. However, a Pokemon with a weakness to Stealth Rock and a lack of reliable recovery cannot thrive on its own, so Rotom-S needs proper team support to function to its fullest.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Some viable options for Rotom-S include a Choice Specs wallbreaker set and a Rain Dance set with Damp Rock, as it can use the weather itself with Thunder or pivot to a rain sweeper with Volt Switch. It can also set up with Sunny Day, but it doesn't fit well on sun teams. Rotom-S also has access to dual screens, but its lack of reliable recovery leaves it outclassed by Musharna. A Life Orb set with Substitute and Pain Split is also viable, but it is often underwhelming with the lack of coverage. Rotom-S can take the annoying path with Confuse Ray, Thunder Wave, and Air Slash, but any strategy dependent on luck is unreliable. Some moves that it can possibly fit into a slot on the offensive sets to hit situational threats are Dark Pulse, Shadow Ball, Signal Beam, and Sucker Punch. A Charge Beam set is possible, but setup sweepers such as Nasty Plot Misdreavus and Calm Mind Serperior are more reliable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Because of Rotom-S's low power, most dedicated special walls, such as Regice, Lickilicky, Audino, and Munchlax, can handle the offensive sets. Tanks can also take most of Rotom-S's attacks as long as they have an advantageous typing. For example, Piloswine is immune to Thunderbolt and Volt Switch and can deal damage back with super effective STAB Ice-type attacks. However, if any of these Pokemon are Tricked onto a Choice Scarf, they are severely crippled for the rest of the match. Electric-types such as Eelektross, Zebstrika, and Ampharos are able to switch in on Rotom-S's STABs with minimal damage, and most generally do not fear a Choice item being Tricked onto them. Pokemon with Taunt such as Misdreavus are able to stop the defensive set from recovering, and Pokemon that don't fear status, such as Ursaring and RestTalk users, can generally handle that set.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>This set functions as a revenge killer and late-game sweeper. With Thunderbolt and Air Slash as Rotom-S's most reliable STAB options, it can outspeed and KO common threats such as +2 Timid Gorebyss, +2 Carracosta, and Choice Scarf Sawk. If the opponent lacks a Ground-type, Rotom-S can easily spam Volt Switch early-game for damage and momentum. Trick is used for bulky defensive Pokemon, easily crippling whatever comes in to wall Rotom-S's attack and allowing it to switch up moves.</p> <p>While lacking in power when compared to Primeape and Charizard due to its lower attacking stat and its lower Base Power STABs, Rotom-S does have surprising fortitude, withstanding Aqua Jets from +2 Carracosta and +2 Samurott and KOing them back. Unfortunately, with its weakness to Stealth Rock, its bulk is hindered with each quarter of health lost, so keeping Stealth Rock out of play is highly beneficial, but not required. Great partners to keep Stealth Rock off the field are Choice Band Mold Breaker Sawk and Taunt Samurott, both of which fit into the offensive playstyle nicely. Ground-types are also a problem, as they are immune to Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, severely limiting Rotom-S in the match. Multiple measures can be taken, however, to alleviate this issue. For starters, Rotom-S can use Hidden Power Grass to hit common Ground-types, such as Seismitoad and Golem, for massive damage. Most Water-, Grass-, and Ice-type Pokemon can dispose of Ground-types as well; Ludicolo is a good partner because it has the bulk to switch in and threaten them with Giga Drain, Hydro Pump, or Ice Beam. Good defensive partners for Rotom-S cover its Rock- and Ice-type weaknesses, so Steel-types such as Hone Claws Metang and Shift Gear Klang are good choices for this playstyle.</p>"

Hidden Power Grass hits all of them for major damage, KOing the 4x weak Seismitoad and Golem. Air Slash and Thunderbolt are the most reliable STABs and are meant to dish out optimal damage.</p> <p>Expert Belt is the key item for this set, because the lack of residual damage when attacking creates the impression that Rotom-S is holding a Choice Scarf. Because it is not locked into any moves, Rotom-S can use much of its large arsenal to exploit the bluff. Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple almost all of NU's physical attackers, but KOing them with the appropriate coverage move is more beneficial. Also, Rotom-S could use the ChestoRest strategy for good recovery while utilizing the same masquerade, but the lack of immediate power is noticeable. Pain Split could also be used for recovery, but the lack of coverage would hurt it more.</p> <p>Much like the Choice Scarf set, Steel-types such as Metang and Klang are good partners because they cover Rotom-S's weaknesses to Ice- and Rock-type moves. Wallbreakers such as Choice Band Sawk are great for disposing of walls that can handle all of Rotom-S's attacks, such as Lickilicky and Regice, and Sawk can possibly keep Stealth Rock off the field as well, aiding in Rotom-S's longevity. Lastly, more balanced teams can afford a Wish passer, such as Lickilicky or Alomomola, which helps keep Rotom-S alive.</p>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>A surprising set for defensive teams, Rotom-S's role is to spread harmful status conditions on many unsuspecting Pokemon. Its Flying typing allows it to switch in on the popular Fighting- and Ground-types of NU and burn them with Will-O-Wisp or hurt them with Air Slash. Discharge is preferred for its paralysis chance, and Rotom-S can create a mean para-flinching scenario with Air Slash. Pain Split is important because it's Rotom-S's most reliable recovery move. Substitute could be used instead of Discharge to ease prediction and handle more switch-ins that would threaten Rotom-S out.</p> <p>The 64 Speed EVs allow Rotom-S to outspeed Timid Gorebyss before it can use Shell Smash, which is an important precaution. The rest of the EVs offer the highest amount of Leftovers recovery and maximize its bulk. It is possible to make Rotom-S specially defensive, but there is less it can wall on that side of the spectrum. It can use the ChestoRest strategy for guaranteed recovery, but the more balanced the team and the longer matches drag on, the more the strategy proves to be underwhelming. Another option is to use Volt Switch, which turns Rotom-S into a bulky pivot.</p> <p>Metang is the best partner for this set because of its synergy with Rotom-S and its bulk, creating a sound defensive core. Defensive teams always appreciate Wish support, which comes best from Audino or Alomomola in this playstyle. Good partners that also fit the defensive playstyle are Taunt Misdreavus and Rapid Spin Wartortle because they help patch up Rotom-S's weakness to Stealth Rock.</p>"

  "Regigigas": {
    "overview": "<p>Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all ages: if it isn't the legendary, the all-powerful, the tragically designed behemoth known as Regigigas! With its Uber-worthy stat spread including a gargantuan base Attack stat catching the naked eye, one must not overlook the serious flaws this giant boasts. Equipped with one of the most shallow movepools in the game and a repulsive ability in Slow Start, which halves both Regigigas's Attack and Speed for five whole turns, Regigigas finds itself seeking refuge within the NU territory.</p> <p>Despite these two crippling attributes, Regigigas should not be quickly dismissed, as it's supplied with the necessary tools to make it competitively bearable and a threat that any team must prepare for. Alongside its excellent overall bulk and sturdy Substitutes, Regigigas is one of the best users of the notorious parafusion strategy, immensely helping it stall out the Slow Start effect whilst taking minimal damage in the process. However, Regigigas still requires heavy team support to ensure success in executing its tactic, and even then, its sheer reliance on parafusion makes it somewhat unreliable as a sweeper.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Looking at Regigigas's lackluster movepool, there really isn't much going for it outside of the one-hit wonder set. A Rock Polish set is interesting, but it just isn't effective at fulfilling a late-game sweeping role due to Slow Start and poor coverage options; there are simply better Pokemon to choose from. A defensive set is a viable approach, using moves such as Toxic, Thunder Wave, Icy Wind, and Knock Off, but the lack of reliable recovery and crippling ability make it outclassed as a specially defensive Normal-type by Miltank, Audino, and Lickilicky. Regigigas also has access to neat special attacks, such as Thunderbolt and Earth Power, but passing up that enormous base Attack for a Special Attack stat that's half as much is nowhere near worth it. Finally, Superpower, Focus Punch, and the elemental punches are available for use, but Regigigas is already strapped for moveslots and can't put them to good effect. Of the elemental punches, Fire Punch is nice for Metang and Ice Punch for Golurk, but again, it's not worth passing up Thunder Wave or Confuse Ray and thus having teammates to handle them is the far better choice.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ghost-types are one of the best counters to Regigigas. Golurk in particular is immune to Thunder Wave and Return and can cause major damage with Dynamic Punch and its STAB Earthquake. In terms of other Ghost-types, like Misdreavus and Drifblim, be cautious if you are not running Substitute; Regigigas has the bulk to sponge a lot of their attacks, and it is possible for them to actually lose to confusion damage. Bastiodon, Golem, and Probopass are all effective switch-ins to Regigigas lacking Drain Punch: Bastiodon stops Regigigas cold with Magic Coat and Roar, Golem is immune to Thunder Wave and hits hard enough to break Regigigas's Substitutes but must be cautious of confusion damage and constant Returns, and Probopass also needs to be aware that it too can succumb to the effects of confusion damage and repeated Return hits.</p> <p>Crippling Regigigas with Will-O-Wisp or Toxic easily shatters its dreams of crushing its enemies, but keep in mind that most teams that are using Regigigas will also have a cleric that needs to be taken care of first. Toxic Spikes also instantly shuts Regigigas down, but again, Poison-types or Rapid Spin users will be seen to accommodate for this; be sure to pack Pokemon to dispose of them. Furthermore, any phazer with Whirlwind or Roar can stop Regigigas from clearing its Slow Start ability, but understand that this method is not the most optimal. This is because parafusion might prevent the use of these moves and Regigigas is also often the last Pokemon on the team, making this method unusable. Dragon Tail is also not recommended, as most users of it typically lack the power to break Regigigas's Substitutes. Perish Song, however, is a deadly weapon to use against Regigigas. Even though parafusion might prevent it from being used, it's a good answer to Regigigas even if it's the last Pokemon on the team. Prankster Murkrow and Misdreavus are perfect users of this.</p> <p>It's also possible to defeat Regigigas by simply brute forcing it. Exploiting its Fighting-type weakness with the likes of Sawk and Gurdurr works well. Luck might be needed when using Sawk due to parafusion, but Gurdurr finds itself enjoying the paralysis, thanks to Guts, and it packs Bulk Up to bolster its Attack and Defense, Drain Punch to restore the health it loses from confusion and Return damage, and Mach Punch to snatch a quick KO against an exposed Regigigas.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "One-Hit Wonder": {
        "description": "<p>This is by far Regigigas's best and most threatening set available. The combination of Thunder Wave, Confuse Ray, and Substitute allows Regigigas to quite easily rid itself of its Slow Start ability and often be guarded behind a Substitute in the end. This is because the nefarious parafusion combo results in only a measly 37.5% chance for the enemy to successfully attack, meaning in the majority of cases, Regigigas will often be setting up bulky Substitutes unscathed. Furthermore, Regigigas's superb overall bulk provides a plethora of opportunities for Regigigas to switch in and begin wreaking havoc. The final moveslot is reserved for Regigigas's most powerful and reliable STAB attack in Return, which when backed up by an overwhelmingly high base Attack stat, ends OHKOing or 2HKOing every NU Pokemon, barring heavily defensive threats, such as Alomomola, Tangela, and Bastiodon, and Ghost-types.</p> <p>If being walled by defensive Steel- and Rock-types severely concerns you, Drain Punch is available to remedy that issue; however, it's strongly discouraged as forgoing Confuse Ray or Thunder Wave will severely hinder Regigigas's ability to compensate for Slow Start. The EV spread focuses solely on maximizing Regigigas's overall bulk and gargantuan power. Leftovers paired with the parafusion strategy is also a deadly combination, often allowing Regigigas to restore the health lost from its Substitutes and may even replenish the damage it takes from being hit outside of its bulwark.</p> <p>It's clearly evident that any Ghost-type will pose an immediate threat to Regigigas, especially Golurk, as it also blocks Thunder Wave, and Substitute or Taunt variants of Misdreavus and Drifblim, as both can quickly halt the entire parafusion combo. For this reason, it is necessary to carry partners to reliably dispose of any Ghost-type in the tier. Skuntank and Zangoose are both formidable Pursuit trappers, the former also packing STAB Sucker Punch and Crunch and the latter boasting an immunity to Will-O-Wisp thanks to the use of Toxic Orb, a Shadow Ball immunity, and Night Slash for a stronger Dark-type. As mentioned previously, defensive Steel- and Rock-types, particularly Bastiodon and Probopass, will be a nuisance to deal with. Even though most are susceptible to Thunder Wave and Confuse Ray, their sheer bulk prevents them from taking any serious damage from Return, giving them an opportunity to hit back, PP stall, or phaze Regigigas out with the likes of Roar. For this reason, using Regirock is a great option as it handily deals with these Pokemon via Drain Punch or Earthquake and can even spread paralysis of its own with Thunder Wave, something Regigigas greatly appreciates. Gurdurr is a more offensive answer to these threats, obliterating them with its STAB attacks. It also enjoys the paralysis support provided by Regigigas due to its poor Speed.</p> <p>It must be acknowledged that Toxic Spikes is the number one method to passively shut Regigigas down without question. The escalating poison damage will end up being too much for Regigigas to handle before Slow Start even has a chance to wear off. It is absolutely critical to utilize Poison-types to absorb them or surefire Rapid Spin users to get rid of them. Again, Skuntank is a great choice with its part Poison typing, and Foresight Wartortle can be used to nearly guarantee a successful Rapid Spin. It is also recommended to use additional paralysis spreaders to aid and quicken Regigigas's ability to set up while taking the least possible damage in the process. Musharna is a fantastic candidate here, as it resists the Fighting-type attacks that Regigigas might come across, has access to the important Heal Bell should Regigigas be crippled with status prematurely, and has the longevity to continually spread paralysis with Thunder Wave. It's also a good idea to use Stun Spore support from the likes of Tangela and Exeggutor, the former deserving a special mention for its ability to handily counter any variant of Golurk. This allows for Ground-types and Pokemon that absorb Electric-type moves, such as Lightning Rod Zebstrika, to be crippled with paralysis, further aiding Regigigas's sweep.</p>"

  "Phione": {
    "overview": "<p>The only reason Phione is worth using is its adored Hydration ability, and with Rest and U-turn in its arsenal, Phione makes for a decent Rain Dance setter. The only strategy Phione should attempt is to set up Rain Dance, heal excess damage with Rest, and U-turn to a rain sweeper; it doesn't have any other notable traits to take advantage of and remain successful.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Phione has a very scarce movepool, and most options it does wield aren't very successful. An offensive set with Life Orb is viable, but Phione doesn't have the strength to utilize it well. Choice items can be used to increase Phione's Attack or Speed, but it loses too much momentum and doesn't have those qualities to take advantage of. Outside of this, Acid Armor, Charm, and Safeguard are some of the best options Phione has. The fact that these aren't remotely viable really shows how bad a movepool Phione has.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Phione is very easy to counter due to its average bulk and offenses. Any strong Electric- or Grass-type, such as Ludicolo, Roselia, Eelektross, and Rotom-S, can deal with Phione, but physical attackers must be wary of Scald's burn. Gardevoir, Regice, and Musharna can take any of Phione's attacks and retaliate with powerful moves of their own. Most Pokemon see Phione as setup bait; Substitute users such as Braviary can get Substitute up on Phione with ease. Many other Pokemon—even Butterfree— can set up on Phione.</p> <p>Pokemon that don't mind being inflicted by status, such as Gurdurr, Shed Skin Dragonair, Swellow, and Ursaring, can handle Phione quite easily, not fearing Scald or Toxic. Taunt users such as Misdreavus and Liepard can shut Phione down and force it to switch out. Any wall that isn't weak to Phione's STAB move can sponge its attacks; Roselia, Tangela, and Regice are prime examples. In short, many Pokemon in the NU tier can handle Phione easily since it can't fight back, but its main goal is to set up Rain Dance, and it usually fulfills that role well. With that in mind, countering Phione isn't usually as important as countering the rain sweepers that follow it, as they are much more threatening than Phione itself.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rain Dance": {
        "description": "<p>This is the only set that Phione can effectively pull off; it combines all of Phione's strong points into a simple strategy: providing Rain Dance for a rain sweeper. Thanks to Hydration, Phione has reliable healing in rain with Rest, allowing it to maintain longevity during the match. U-turn is very useful when switching into a rain sweeper, as it provides a safe switch. Rest is a great healing move when Rain Dance is active, as it heals Phione to full HP. While Phione has very little offensive presence, Scald should be used when Phione cannot switch out or when you're positive it can score a KO. Not only does it prevent Phione from being complete Taunt bait, but it's a great STAB move that has a 30% burn chance, which fares well against physical attackers such as Sawk. However, Toxic can be used to cripple bulky Pokemon, such as Alomomola and Lickilicky.</p> <p>Damp Rock is the key to this set's success, increasing Rain Dance's longevity, giving rain sweepers more time to sweep. Phione's EV spread focuses on its physical bulk; a Bold nature maximizes its Defense, and in conjunction with Rest, this keeps Phione alive as long as possible. Phione invests no Speed EVs to make U-turn as slow as possible, switching after most opponents and getting a sweeper in for free. To this end, a Relaxed nature can be used, as it gives Phione an even slower U-turn while giving it a chance to OHKO Jynx on the switch after Stealth Rock damage. You can even lower Phione's Speed IVs to allow an even slower U-turn to rain sweepers. If Toxic is being used, it's advised to use an Impish nature to slightly strengthen U-turn. Surf can be used over Scald for more power, but it still won't do much damage off of Phione's pitiful Special Attack, while Scald's burn chance is useful.</p> <p>Since this set is specifically made to set up Rain Dance for rain sweepers, having them as partners is mandatory. Ludicolo, Gorebyss, Swanna, and Seismitoad are prime examples of sweepers who appreciate Rain Dance support. Backup rain inducers are always helpful; Electrode, Swanna, Volbeat, and Liepard are great partners in that regard. This set is easily forced out by Taunt users, especially those Phione can't really harm, such as Misdreavus. Regice and Samurott can get rid of Misdreavus with their powerful special attacks; Samurott's STAB moves also get a boost from Rain Dance.</p>"

The most notable of these moves would be Encore, which can lock its targets into unfavorable moves and provide easy setup. While its attacking stats are not too impressive, it can still boast surprising offensive presence due to its tricky attacks. Unfortunately, it is one of the frailest Pokemon in existence, meaning it dies to even the lightest of breezes, which brings its fair share of risks when trying to use its disruption tools, but Prankster coupled with its movepool does go a long way in helping it to avoid direct hits.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Nasty Plot can do serious damage to most physical walls that intend to wall Liepard, but Liepard's power is pretty modest before a boost and can be lacking even after a boost, and it is hard to find the turns it needs to set up while protecting itself from revenge kills. Taunt can be used to prevent setup attempts such as Spikes, but Encore is better as not many Pokemon have access to it nor make use of it well, though the two can be used together to force a Pokemon locked into a non-damaging move to Struggle. Toxic allows Liepard to combat bulky Pokemon that can stand up to Foul Play, and causes residual damage to make up for weak Foul Plays; when used in tandem with Encore, it can really harass most walls looking to counteract the poison. However, bulkier Pokemon make use of Toxic better since they can take hits longer. Yawn can be used to force switches or put a foe to sleep, both of which can buy Liepard free turns, but Liepard would be exposed to attacks for at least one turn. Torment combos very well with a prior Substitute to infuriate Choice users (without Volt Switch or U-turn) or mono-attack Pokemon such as Alomomola and support Miltank, and can be used in tandem with Encore to force Struggling (and switches). Encore alone is better most of the time though.</p> <p>Knock Off can be used to cripple pretty much any wall and even certain sweepers, and is effective against bulky Poison-types that Toxic can't affect, though Liepard has better things to be doing and this is also better left off to bulkier Pokemon. Prankster Trick is outdone by Encore, nor is Liepard strong enough to make use of Choice items. Unburden with a pinch berry does not do damage as consistently as Life Orb and only has the boost as long as it stays in. Liepard has Hone Claws with physical moves such as Seed Bomb, Gunk Shot, and Iron Tail, but still cannot beat its common switch-ins. Prankster Charm can weaken physical sweepers, but it does clash with Foul Play and said physical sweepers can still overwhelm Liepard.</p> <p>​</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Liepard is super frail, and one direct hit can do massive damage or even KO. In general, Pokemon that are even remotely bulky, such as Samurott and Eelektross, can take Liepard's attacks and KO back. Defensive titans such as Alomomola, Regice, Torkoal, and even Wartortle perform similarly. Fighting-types and Steel-types make for the safest switch-ins to most Liepard, with Gurdurr receiving special mention due to powering up from status via Guts and threatening with STAB Mach Punch, while Shed Skin Scraggy manhandles any Liepard. Resisting the temptation to set up or heal haphazardly can deny Liepard the opportunity to mess you up with Encore, so just take it down as quickly as you can. Pivot Liepard for the most part is not very hard to counter due to its lackluster power, but access to U-turn and Sucker Punch makes it tricky to check. Faster Pokemon such as Tauros, Swellow, and various Choice Scarf Pokemon can easily KO Liepard, but if they are weakened they need to be wary of Sucker Punch. Priority moves outspeed Liepard's attack, cornering it into using Sucker Punch or switching out; faster priority such as Fake Out and Extreme Speed or faster priority users such as Quick Attack Swellow and Aqua Jet Floatzel outspeed it regardless. Jolly Shell Smash Carracosta and Belly Drum Linoone are two exceptions to setup sweepers Liepard cannot stop, as they can evade Liepard's Encore by following up with Aqua Jet and Extreme Speed respectively.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This Liepard serves as both a momentum grabber and a revenge killer. It is fairly consistent at its role, and has priority that packs decent enough power to pick off weakened foes, though it struggles to KO healthier targets. While it seems risky for such a frail Pokemon to adopt a prediction-heavy task, Liepard has all the moves it needs to minimize this risk. For a trapper, Skuntank is usually used in this role, but Liepard's advantages are better Speed, U-turn for grabbing momentum, and Encore for stopping setup sweepers and Substitute users, while Skuntank has to rely on prediction and usually isn't fast enough to use Taunt on them to ease said prediction. Sucker Punch revenge kills weakened targets and is Liepard's strongest unboosted attack, but it fails if the opponent switches or doesn't attack. Pursuit can hunt down those that flee and take them out anyway. Should the opponent stick around to either set up or heal, Prankster Encore locks the opponent into the non-damaging move they used on a previous turn regardless of any Speed they may have attained, turning the opponent into a sitting duck. What this means is that Liepard can thwart almost any attempt to bypass Sucker Punch by itself. From there, U-turn and Pursuit gives Liepard's team the advantage against the switches the opponent will be making to escape Encore or Sucker Punch. U-turn also allows Liepard to escape its counters while landing chip damage. Night Slash provides more reliable STAB, but Pursuit is preferred as it punishes Pokemon attempting a switch, especially after they have been Encored, while Sucker Punch is stronger and its risks have been reduced thanks to Liepard's other moves.</p> <p>Dread Plate is used for maximum power on Sucker Punch without recoil from Life Orb, at the cost of a negligible loss in U-turn's power. Dark Gem could be used but Liepard loses a noticeable amount of power after it is consumed. Due to the switches Encore, Sucker Punch, and U-turn force, Liepard appreciates hazard support as it can wear down walls that stop Liepard, making Pokemon such as Garbodor and Golem good partners. Liepard also has good synergy with Poison-types such as Garbodor and Roselia, as well as Ghost-types such as Haunter and Golurk to cover its weaknesses. Encore and U-turn makes Liepard a great partner for setup sweepers such as Carracosta, Samurott, and Braviary, or frail attackers such as Swellow, Drifblim, Zangoose, and Haunter, all of whom like free switch-ins. Walls such as Alomomola and Regice are good counters because Liepard doesn't have the sheer power to break them, thus wallbreakers such as Eelektross and Samurott are recommended.</p>"

      "Weather Support": {
        "description": "<p>Liepard's access to Prankster makes it a perfect choice to set up weather for weather teams. While Liepard faces competition from Volbeat as a weather setter, its immunity to Psychic-type moves gives it more opportunities to switch in and set up. Unlike Volbeat, it also has decent Attack and Speed to strike back against frailer foes and can defeat Kadabra and Gardevoir, both of which threaten weather teams. Its Speed stat also allows it to set up weather against faster opponents with priority moves, such as Pinsir and Zangoose, unlike Volbeat. Rain Dance or Sunny Day would depend on whether you are using a rain or sun team. Encore is a great move to punish Psychic-types, status spreaders, and Kangaskhan using Fake Out, locking them into undesirable moves and getting a free opportunity to set up weather in the process. U-turn allows Liepard to gain momentum on switches and threaten Kadabra and Exeggutor. Finally, Sucker Punch is Liepard's most powerful move to punish faster opponents that think they can beat it. It also works well with Encore punishing opponents that try to avoid Sucker Punch by using a status move.</p> <p>The EV spread allows Liepard to outspeed Kadabra and Speed tie at worst with other Liepard, but a more specially defensive EV spread can be used for an easier time setting up against Ghost-types. Thunder Wave is an option to spread paralysis, crippling threats to weather teams such as Kangaskhan, but that is best left to Volbeat. Taunt is a decent alternative move, preventing opponents from using entry hazards. This could prove useful due to rain teams' weakness to Toxic Spikes and sun teams' weakness to Stealth Rock. Foul Play can be used over Sucker Punch to potentially deal more damage. Pursuit is also another option to defeat fleeing Psychic-types and ensure that these Pokemon trouble the team. It also catches out opponents fleeing after being Encore-locked into an unfavorable move.</p> <p>Volbeat is a great partner and fellow supporter of weather teams. In combination with Volbeat, Liepard can almost ensure the weather consistently stays up throughout the game. Other weather inducers, such as Rotom-S, Regirock, Gardevoir, and Illumise, are appreciated to take the pressure off Liepard and aid in setting up weather. Teammates that take advantage of their respective weather are essential. For rain teams, Pokemon with Swift Swim or Hydration are good users of rain. For example, Ludicolo, Seismitoad, Carracosta, Mantine, Gorebyss, Floatzel, and Swanna can take advantage of rain very well. Meanwhile, Chlorophyll users and Fire-types can take advantage of the sun. This includes Exeggutor, Shiftry, Sawsbuck, Victreebel, Rapidash, and Charizard. Weather teams in general dislike entry hazards, more so for rain teams with Toxic Spikes and sun teams with Stealth Rock. This is because Toxic Spikes easily wears down rain teams while Fire-types that are omnipresent on sun teams are weak to Stealth Rock Garbodor is a good Toxic Spikes absorber, and it can set up entry hazards of its own to aid in its team's sweep. Mold Breaker Sawk is useful for sun teams to get rid of opposing Stealth Rock users. Finally, Torkoal and Armaldo are decent Rapid Spin users for sun and rain teams respectively. ​</p>"

  "Musharna": {
    "overview": "<p>Musharna is one of the most versatile Pokemon in the tier due to a great stat distribution and a movepool that adds to its ability to perform a variety of roles. Such options include that of a defensive pivot, boosting sweeper, offensive Trick Room sweeper, and Choice Specs wallbreaker. Excellent defensive capabilities allow Musharna to check or counter most physical attackers, such as Sawk and Kangaskhan, as well as check most opposing Psychic-types, defensive threats, and most weak special attackers. Musharna has a wide, viable movepool with options including Heal Bell, Thunder Wave, Baton Pass, and Trick, while having reliable recovery of its own in Moonlight. Synchronize gives Musharna a great weapon against more defensive teams, as this allows it to cripple most defensive Pokemon that depend on status to wear it down. While access to so many useful options makes it an exceptional pick for many teams, Musharna's usefulness depends a lot on the variety of moves that it needs to run in a given situation, which highlights its biggest shortcoming in the fact that it's limited to only four of those options. It is also one of the slowest Pokemon in the tier, meaning that it is often prone to being worn down as it constantly gets pummeled by powerful attacks and passive damage. Musharna is able to threaten a lot of Pokemon that don't resist its STAB, but it tends to struggle a lot against most Dark- and Steel-type Pokemon that can either trap it or inflict said passive damage. Because of these flaws, Musharna faces competition as a bulky Psychic-type from Duosion and Gothorita, the former of which is immune to passive damage while the latter has extra utility through Shadow Tag.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>As versatile as Musharna is, it is perhaps no surprise that it does have a variety of other options worth considering. Musharna can utilize Rest and Sleep Talk as recovery, but this is ultimately inferior to Moonlight and Heal Bell as the latter two don't require putting itself to sleep, don't depend on the unreliable Sleep Talk, can support other team members as well, and can provide healing each turn. Hypnosis and Yawn can allow Musharna to cripple something in the form of sleep, which is always game-changing in itself, and Musharna can have plenty of opportunities to use them with its excellent bulk. Forewarn allows Musharna to scout for coverage moves. Toxic seems enticing, but is overshadowed by the utility of Synchronize in many cases, and Thunder Wave is the better support option for more offensive teams. Rain Dance is interesting, and Musharna can make use of Baton Pass alongside it to generate momentum and get rain sweepers in for free. This does, however, further compound Musharna's four-moveslot syndrome. Rain also really lowers the effectiveness of Moonlight.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Musharna is a very difficult Pokemon to check because of its great stat distribution, defensive typing that leaves it few weaknesses, and a wide movepool that gives it a lot of options. Because of how differently they play and which filler options they choose, each of Musharna's sets has different flaws and vulnerabilities to exploit.</p> <p>The best all-around answers, especially to mono-attacking sets, are Dark- and Steel-type Pokemon. Skuntank can come in on everything but a timely Hidden Power Ground and proceed to shut Musharna down with Taunt, trap it with Pursuit, or hit it hard with Crunch. Zweilous can just phaze it out while taking minimal damage from Signal Beam or respond with Crunch for heavy damage. Mandibuzz is another solid answer that is able to shut down Musharna a majority of the time with its typing, bulk, and access to Taunt to stop it from using its support options. However, Mandibuzz must be wary of being crippled with Thunder Wave on the switch or Toxic when attempting to hit Musharna in kind, due to Musharna's Synchronize and Heal Bell. Liepard can switch in and Encore Musharna into any move that doesn't threaten it, especially as Prankster ignores Trick Room, and proceed to set up on Musharna. Zweilous and Liepard must be wary of Life Orb or Choice Specs-boosted Signal Beam, however, as well as Trick. Generally speaking, any set that forgoes Heal Bell is susceptible to status, but you must be wary of Synchronize's effect as it can turn your strategy against you. This is where Steel-type Pokemon such as Metang, Bastiodon, and Probopass become some of the most solid answers. They resist Psychic and take very little from Musharna's coverage moves barring Hidden Power Ground and Trick, and reduce its overall performance with Toxic. Metang, Bastiodon, and Probopass are also able to stall out Heal Bell between Metang's 4x resistance to Psychic and Probopass's excellent bulk with Leftovers, alongside their immunity to Toxic.</p> <p>In regards to other offensive Pokemon, Golurk can take two unboosted Psychic hits and proceed to 2HKO with Shadow Punch. Swoobat can outboost Calm Mind Musharna and overwhelm it with boosted Stored Power, while its typing is great for tanking most of Musharna's attacks in general, giving it many opportunities to set up on Musharna. Powerful physical Bug-types such as Pinsir can 2HKO with their STAB moves. Haunter can Disable Musharna's Psychic and proceed to wear it down with Shadow Ball, or can serve as a last-ditch resort with Destiny Bond. Most Choice-locked attackers such as Braviary and powerful special attackers that can 2HKO it before it can start boosting with Calm Mind such as Charizard or Haunter can easily overwhelm Musharna with their sheer power, making it impossible for Musharna to safely boost.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>In a metagame where most common Pokemon are fast and frail, support pivot Musharna has a niche as a Pokemon able to utilize its bulk to find many opportunities to support its team. Musharna is able to switch into and safely cripple a lot of offensive Pokemon that fail to 2HKO it, including every common Fighting-type and nearly every defensive Pokemon. The ability to heal with Moonlight is the most important part of the set, as it allows Musharna to continuously perform its role of countering threats, giving it more opportunities to spread status or attack when necessary. A status move is also necessary to keep Musharna from being used as setup fodder. Toxic is the most reliable option, as it cripples both defensive and offensive Pokemon alike. Yawn is a fantastic move to use alongside Baton Pass to give Musharna the opportunity to gain a lot of momentum for more offensively oriented teams. If the opponent decides to switch out of Yawn, you'll always have the upper hand as you Baton Pass into an appropriate check, and if they decide to stay in, an opposing Pokemon will be crippled for the rest of the match. Thunder Wave is also a good option to cripple opposing Skuntank as they try to switch in and Pursuit trap Musharna, and it has added utility of slowing down faster foes. Baton Pass is used to provide momentum for the team, and it is particularly useful against Dark-types and Golurk as they attempt to switch into Psychic or Thunder Wave, respectively. It also works very well with Musharna's low Speed, which gives it a lot of opportunities to bring offensive teammates that might have trouble switching in otherwise. Heal Bell can be used instead to let Musharna act as a cleric, but Baton Pass is far more valuable for more offensive teams. However, it can be especially helpful against walls that rely on status to cripple Musharna, as they are then crippled in return by Synchronize. Psychic is Musharna's primary STAB move, dealing respectable damage overall and preventing Musharna from becoming Taunt bait.</p> <p>240 HP EVs give Musharna a Leftovers number to reduce passive damage, while the rest goes to its overall bulk. The selected moves provide Musharna the most effective form of consistently supporting its teammates, but there are other alternatives that can be useful in certain situations. Reflect is unique in the fact that it allows Musharna to bypass any of the physical attackers that can reliably break through it, such as Dark-types, Golurk, and Skuntank, allowing it to either safely switch out or retaliate. The same applies to special attackers such as Shiftry or Charizard if using Light Screen. Both moves can also be used to help teammates set up.</p> <p>Pokemon that can lure or reliably threaten Dark- and Steel-types are especially good partners, as said Dark- and Steel-types are often common obstacles that can safely switch into Musharna and dismantle it with Pursuit or Toxic, respectively. Fighting-types such as Sawk and Gurdurr are excellent examples, as they can easily threaten essentially all of those obstacles, while also being able to take advantage of the likes of Audino and other Heal Bell users that don't particularly mind Musharna's plethora of opportunities to use Thunder Wave. Musharna can also form part of a Psychic / Fighting / Dark core that focuses on eliminating each other's checks. Haunter is also a good teammate to consider, as it can take advantage of free Baton Pass switch-ins with its excellent offensive prowess, break down offensive teams with the help of Thunder Wave support, and lure and eliminate several of Musharna's checks with Destiny Bond.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>While this set might seem similar to the support set, this set focuses more on obtaining a win condition by playing the role of a bulky boosting sweeper. Musharna can slowly gain boosts on many physical attackers that can't 2HKO it such as most Fighting-type Pokemon that it counters, as well as almost any defensive Pokemon that isn't a Steel-type that carries Toxic. One of the main perks of this set is that even though it is more of a sweeper, Musharna is also easily capable of functioning as a physical wall of sorts, being able to support the team in a variety of ways in the process. After a single Calm Mind boost, Musharna's Special Defense becomes extraordinarily high, making it nearly impossible to 2HKO under most circumstances. Moonlight allows Musharna to pivot against threats that it can wall, and can be used to heal up any damage taken while setting up, or give it more opportunities to set up throughout the course of the match. Psychic is the primary STAB move, and easily has overwhelming damage output after several boosts. Heal Bell is the primary filler of choice, as it allows Musharna to support its teammates and itself. The latter is especially important in allowing Musharna to function as a stallbreaker against more defensive teams, and helps prevents its sweep from being cut short from annoying status ailments. However, Baton Pass provides excellent momentum with Musharna's low Speed, and can even give a teammate a temporary advantage by passing Calm Mind boosts. Signal Beam is Musharna's main coverage move, allowing it to hit Dark- and Psychic-types that aren't troubled by Psychic.</p> <p>The given EV spread as usual gives Musharna a Leftovers number, giving it as much physical bulk as possible while the rest is dumped into Special Defense. A more offensive spread with more Special Attack investment can be used, but the problem with this is that the lack of defensive investment makes it much easier for physical attackers to break through Musharna. Likewise, Musharna can opt to run more Special Defense investment to set up more easily on special attackers such as Charizard and Eelektross, but that detracts from its ability to function as a mixed wall, and is largely unnecessary as Musharna is already boosting its Special Defense. As far as other move options go, it should be noted first of all that Musharna will have to forgo other important options, such as the ability to hit Dark-types, or to heal the team of status. Thunder Wave is nice to cripple Pokemon before Musharna attempts a sweep, and helps it better support its offensive teammates. Reflect lets it set up on a lot more physical attackers, like Skuntank and Golurk that Musharna tends to lure, while also helping Musharna escape from Skuntank's Pursuit much more reliably. Psyshock and Stored Power are neat alternatives over Psychic. The former hits special walls harder and allows Musharna to win any Calm Mind war, but is overall weaker than Psychic and more common walls in this metagame tend to be physically defensive anyways. The latter becomes more powerful than Psychic after two Calm Mind boosts, but Musharna doesn't usually have much time to get greedy with Calm Mind against more offensive teams. Hidden Power Ground can provide coverage against Skuntank, Metang, and Bastiodon.</p> <p>Even though Musharna can make good use of its coverage moves, its abysmal Speed still leaves it vulnerable to Dark- and Steel-type counters such as Skuntank, Zweilous, and Metang. Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Sawk remain as the top suggestions for teammates as a result, as they can easily take advantage of them while also making Musharna's job easier against most special walls that can cripple it if it doesn't use Heal Bell. Ground-type Pokemon such as Golem, Piloswine, and Golurk are also good partners, as they are able to bust through most of these checks and set up Stealth Rock to provide more team support. Musharna also appreciates hazard support, as most of its checks are grounded and Musharna has a tendency of forcing many Pokemon out. Garbodor and Roselia are both solid examples of supporters that can set up Spikes.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes a different offensive approach to Musharna, taking advantage of its ability to sweep the fast, frail offensive metagame with Trick Room and Life Orb-boosted attacks. While Beheeyem might appear to pull off a set like this much more effectively due to its significantly higher offensive presence and utility with Analytic, Musharna stands out due to its notably superior bulk. This allows Musharna to find a lot more setup opportunities and heal much more reliably than Beheeyem, while still possessing enough power to break through most offensive Pokemon with the help of Life Orb. Psychic is the consistent STAB move that can hit most Pokemon quite hard, easily OHKOing most offensive Pokemon with some hazard support. Signal Beam is Musharna's best coverage move, as it hits Dark- and Psychic-types that don't take much damage from Psychic. Moonlight is one of the best filler moves on this set, healing Life Orb recoil and other damage. Hidden Power Ground aims to gain a solid 2HKO on Skuntank and Metang, while also OHKOing Bastiodon and Probopass.</p> <p>The EVs maximize Musharna's combination of power and bulk, and the IVs grant it a maximum Hidden Power Ground with the lowest Speed possible. If you do not wish to use Hidden Power Ground, simply use a 0 Speed IV instead. Leftovers can provide recovery, but this also comes at the cost of significantly cutting the set's damage output overall. Similarly, TwistedSpoon could be used to boost the power of Musharna's STAB move without necessitating Life Orb recoil. Psyshock can hit Audino and Regice harder, but generally less enticing overall in a more physically oriented metagame. Baton Pass is good for momentum, but is generally less effective if Musharna has activated Trick Room already.</p> <p>This set doesn't require as much support as most of Musharna's other sets, as it sports powerful offensive presence with solid coverage, allowing Musharna to threaten its checks much more efficiently. Nonetheless, Fighting-types remain as the best partners to enable a late-game Musharna sweep, which can also pair up with a Dark-type to make an effective core towards supporting one another. Bulky wallbreakers such as Gurdurr, Choice Band Lickilicky, and Eelektross can provide good backup under Trick Room, while also sharing good offensive synergy with Musharna. This set is much more vulnerable to passive damage between Life Orb damage and entry hazards, and due to the lack of defensive investment, Musharna becomes easier to wear down before it can have an opportunity to heal with Moonlight. As such, Pokemon that can help keep entry hazards away from the field are especially helpful; Choice Band Sawk for example can OHKO most of the common Stealth Rock users thanks to Mold Breaker. A safer alternative is a Rapid Spin user, notably Wartortle, as it can threaten Golurk with Scald and bypass other Ghost-types with Foresight to guarantee a Rapid Spin.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>On paper, Choice Specs Musharna seems underwhelming, incapable of either pulling off dedicated sweeps or having the ability to keep itself alive with Moonlight. This set, however, should focus mostly on Musharna's power and ability to break through lots of Pokemon with its immediate offensive presence. This set requires a good amount of prediction to be useful, as locking itself in to an unfavorable coverage move or Psychic against a Dark- or Steel-type can leave it easily forced out. Signal Beam is the safest coverage move for this set, as it can hit Dark- and Psychic-types that its Psychic STAB doesn't cover well. Baton Pass can let Musharna escape from Skuntank switch-ins without taking any damage from potential trapping, while Hidden Power Ground can be used to 2HKO Skuntank and Steel-types. Trick gives this set a unique twist, allowing Musharna to cripple special walls or other common switch-ins, such as Skuntank and Golurk, very well. Sleep Talk can let Musharna also play the role of a sleep absorber, sponging the status from the likes of Tangela.</p> <p>The EV spread increases Musharna's effectiveness as a tank, maximizing its offensive prowess while investing the rest into its bulk. Moonlight can find a place on the set, and especially shares some synergy with Trick, as Musharna can easily switch moves and heal anytime after Tricking Choice Specs. Psyshock can give Musharna a better matchup against Lickilicky, Audino, and Regice, but it's still generally less effective in a metagame with most defensive Pokemon like Misdreavus or Tangela being physically bulky. Shadow Ball can be used to hit Golurk and Misdreavus harder, but it provides redundant coverage with Signal Beam, in fact missing out on Dark-types, which are the biggest obstacle of this set anyways.</p> <p>This set especially appreciates support from its teammates, so that Musharna doesn't have to risk locking itself in to Signal Beam to hit Dark-types. Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Sawk are the most reliable options in this role, as both can usually switch safely into the likes of Skuntank or Liepard and easily threaten with their STAB moves. Ground-types are solid teammates as well, as they can switch in and hit Skuntank hard with Earthquake. Colbur Berry Golurk can also help by luring Skuntank as well as by switching into and threatening Audino and Lickilicky. Destiny Bond lures such as Gardevoir and Haunter are good teammates that can remove common Dark-type switches so that Musharna can safely proceed to spam Psychic.</p>"

  "Zebstrika": {
    "overview": "<p>Zebstrika stands out from most of its Electric-type brethren due to its particularly amazing Speed tier; outpacing the vast majority of the NU metagame unboosted. It also has a great ability in Lightning Rod and STAB Volt Switch to build momentum. Unfortunately, the good news ends here. Zebstrika's horrible physical movepool forces it to utilize its mediocre Special Attack to deal damage, so it is not very powerful. Zebstrika also faces stiff competition from various Electric-types in NU—Electabuzz, Raichu, Electrode, and Rotom-A all give it a major run for its money as a fast Electric-type scout. Nonetheless, focusing on Zebstrika's decent coverage and making use of its fantastic Speed will let it truly shine.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Like most Electric-types, Zebstrika has a really barren movepool. Its Attack stat is higher than its Special Attack stat, but it has an absolutely horrible physical movepool to use it with. Likewise, Zebstrika can go mixed using Wild Charge over Thunderbolt, but this doesn't accomplish anything in the long run and splitting offenses is a bad idea on a Pokemon that's so offensively weak. Zebstrika can utilize Choice Specs over Life Orb, but it really likes being able to switch moves and hit hard at the same time. Pursuit can catch Haunter and Gardevoir on the switch, but it doesn't do much else and forces Zebstrika to forgo another move in lieu of it. Agility and Flame Charge can boost Zebstrika's Speed and attempt a sweep, but it is too easily walled to make this effective and to free up the moveslot must give up the utility of Volt Switch, one of its biggest selling points. Charge Beam can help patch up Zebstrika's mediocre Special Attack, but it is too frail to set up multiple Charge Beams and, again, must forgo Volt Switch. Zebstrika can better utilize Thunder with Rain Dance, and it can support rain sweepers with a fast Volt Switch, but rain weakens the power of Overheat and ends up doing more harm than good. Signal Beam can hurt Grass-types without lowering Zebstrika's Special Attack, but Overheat's greater power and ability to seriously damage Grass / Poison types is generally superior. Thunder Wave can cripple faster threats, but Zebstrika is too frail to use it effectively. Finally, Toxic does a number to most walls, but the most common special wall in the tier, Lickilicky, can heal it off with Heal Bell.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Zebstrika is pretty easy to counter due to its relatively low attacking power. Pretty much any special wall can force it out; Regice and Bastiodon are two examples of such. Lickilicky and Audino also perform very well against Zebstrika; they can take any attack with ease, Wish off the damage, and wear it down. Most Ground-types, such as Golurk and Piloswine, can comfortably tank one Life Orb-boosted Hidden Power Grass and OHKO with Earthquake. Camerupt is a particularly adept counter, as its typing allows it to take any of its attacks with ease. Bulky Dragon-types, such as Altaria, Dragonair, and Zweilous, can wall Zebstrika and either set up or phaze it out, though Altaria must watch out for Hidden Power Ice. Priority can also efficiently take down a weakened Zebstrika, examples being Kangaskhan's Fake Out and Sucker Punch combination and Gurdurr's Mach Punch. Overall, as long as you have something that can both take a hit and fire one back, you should be good to go against Zebstrika.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Zebstrika functions best as an all-out attacker; it makes the most out of its high Speed and scouting ability, while Life Orb helps to patch up its lack of initial power. With its high Base Power and perfect accuracy, Thunderbolt is a great main STAB and cleaning tool. Volt Switch is great early- to mid-game and is perfect for revenge killing and predicting switches. Overheat is a handy tool that suits Zebstrika's great Speed extremely well, netting an OHKO on most Grass-types. Finally, Hidden Power Grass nails Seismitoad and Golem, two common Pokemon that would otherwise take Zebstrika's attacks with ease.</p> <p>Expert Belt can be used to bluff a Choice set and net some surprise KOs, but otherwise, the extra power provided by Life Orb is preferred. Hidden Power Ice provides pseudo-BoltBeam coverage and can dent Altaria, but this is rather situational, and hitting Seismitoad and Golem is generally more important. Lastly, Sap Sipper can be used over Lightning Rod to check Serperior much more easily, but that's about all it offers, and Zebstrika really enjoys the potential power boost and immunity to Volt Switch and Thunder Wave given by Lightning Rod.</p> <p>Entry hazards work well alongside Zebstrika's scouting ability and help it gain important KOs against certain Pokemon; Choice Specs Altaria, for example, is solidly 2HKOed by Thunderbolt after Stealth Rock, and maximum HP Seismitoad is OHKOed by Hidden Power Grass after one layer of Spikes. Speaking of Seismitoad, it makes a good partner for Zebstrika, as it can combat Ground-types which can be troublesome for Zebstrika to beat. Garbodor is a good partner for setting up Spikes on offensive teams. Pokemon like Primeape and Swellow are also good partners, forming a solid VoltTurn core with Zebstrika. Finally, Water-types can defeat Ground-types for Zebstrika as well as luring in Electric-type moves for Zebstrika to absorb.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf lets Zebstrika take on the role of a dedicated revenge killer. It gives up the useful power boost granted by Life Orb for the ability to check a wider variety of threats. While it might seem like a waste to put a Choice Scarf on something as fast as Zebstrika, its ridiculously high Speed when equipped with said item is actually its main selling point. Zebstrika can now outspeed and quickly dispose of Swellow and Choice Scarf Charizard at +1. Volt Switch is the main STAB on this set and is most likely the move you'll be using when you bring it in; due to Zebstrika being locked into one move and lacking power overall, Volt Switch is great for both revenge killing and getting it out in a pinch. That being said, Thunderbolt is another good Electric STAB when Volt Switch's power just doesn't cut it. Overheat and Hidden Power Grass provide the best coverage alongside Zebstrika's STABs, but be extremely cautious when using them, as they are both terrible moves to be locked into and should only be used in dire situations. Keep in mind that this set can't clean up as efficiently as the Life Orb set because of its measly unboosted Special Attack stat.</p> <p>A Modest nature is preferred, as Zebstrika is generally fast enough and needs as much power as it can get. Timid can be used to outspeed Timid Ludicolo and Victreebel in their respective weathers, but otherwise, Zebstrika should just stick with Modest. Hidden Power Ice gets the jump on boosting Dragon-types (after they are severely weakened), but doesn't do much else, and being locked into Hidden Power is a bad idea. Sap Sipper can be used to handle Serperior, but in most cases, Lightning Rod is superior.</p> <p>Fighting-types are good partners for Zebstrika, as they can break down special walls that Zebstrika has no chance of defeating. Primeape in particular can form a VoltTurn core with it. Ground-types are even more threatening to this set than others due to Zebstrika being locked into one move; Water-types are capable of beating them, and they can also lure Electric-type moves for Zebstrika to take advantage of.</p>"

  "Swoobat": {
    "overview": "<p>Swoobat is a mediocre Pokemon, but has one decent niche. The combination of Simple and Calm Mind grants Swoobat a +2 boost in both Special Attack and Special Defense after only one turn of setup. In addition to this, it also gets access to Stored Power, a 100 Base Power STAB attack after only one Calm Mind. While this might make Swoobat seem like a top-tier threat, it has quite a few flaws holding it back. Aside from its great Speed stat, all its other stats are terrible. A mediocre base 77 Special Attack means it needs at least one boost to do any sort of significant damage. Its 67 / 55 / 55 bulk doesn't do it any favors, and it is weak to Sucker Punch, the most common form of priority in NU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swoobat has an excellent support movepool, such as Toxic, Tailwind, Taunt, Trick, dual screens, Knock Off, Magic Coat, and U-turn, but it has nowhere near the bulk required to effectively use it. Roost is a reliable recovery move, but Swoobat will never find the time to use it; using Roost will also take away a precious moveslot that could be used for a coverage move. Charge Beam can be used to do a little bit of Electric-type damage while also having a good chance to boost Swoobat's Special Attack, but Calm Mind is much better as it provides a guaranteed boost, and boosts Special Defense as well. Klutz in conjunction with Trick is a usable gimmick, but it is hard to pull off because of Swoobat's frailty, so Swoobat is better off as a Simple Calm Mind sweeper. Choice items are out of the question because of Swoobat's disappointing offensive stats; in addition, Jynx and Gardevoir severely outclass it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The best way to counter Swoobat is to prevent it from setting up or Encoring it into Calm Mind. Liepard gets a notable mention for being able to switch into a predicted Stored Power, Encore Swoobat, and KO it with STAB Pursuit. Skuntank is immune to Stored Power, can take a +2 Heat Wave, and can defeat Swoobat with the combination of Pursuit and Sucker Punch. Regice can take any move Swoobat throws at it with ease and OHKO with Ice Beam after Stealth Rock, even if Swoobat has a Calm Mind boost under its belt. However, if Swoobat uses Calm Mind twice, it can survive an Ice Beam, get the Salac Berry boost, and OHKO with a +4 Stored Power. Bastiodon can phaze away Swoobat's boosts with Roar and only really fears Hidden Power Ground, which it can survive provided Sturdy is intact. Audino and Lickilicky can take a Stored Power after one Calm Mind and a Salac boost, and severely damage Swoobat with Body Slam and Double-Edge, respectively.</p> <p>While it is difficult to counter Swoobat due to the sheer power of a boosted Stored Power, there exist many checks. Although Swoobat can avoid being revenge killed with Substitute, most Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Glaceon and Jynx, can take out Swoobat if it hasn't gotten its Salac boost due to its frailty. Priority moves, such as Aqua Jet and Sucker Punch from the likes of Carracosta and Cacturne, can defeat Swoobat provided it isn't behind a Substitute. Golem can KO Swoobat through its Substitute with Rock Blast, though Swoobat can OHKO it with a boosted Stored Power if Golem's Sturdy is broken, making it a very shaky check. Finally, Choice Scarf Imposter Ditto can copy Swoobat's boosts if it is not behind a Substitute, outspeed it, and possibly sweep the rest of Swoobat's team.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "SubSalac": {
        "description": "<p>This is Swoobat's only set, but it performs it well due to a great base Speed that lets it outspeed most of the tier and access to Calm Mind along with the Simple ability. After a single boost, Stored Power reaches 100 Base Power, which is devastating combined with Swoobat's increased Special Attack and STAB. Due to its high Speed, the only things Swoobat fears being revenge killed by are Choice Scarf Pokemon and priority users. Substitute is a great move that remedies this by preventing Swoobat from being revenge killed by the likes of Skuntank. Stored Power takes advantage of Calm Mind to the fullest with its high Base Power after a Calm Mind or two, and Heat Wave provides excellent coverage with Stored Power, hitting the Dark-, Psychic-, and Steel-types in the tier, such as Jynx, Metang, and Probopass. Salac Berry is the item of choice here, as the +2 Speed boost it gives Swoobat upon falling into the last 25% of its HP both allows it to outspeed the entire tier and further boosts the power of Stored Power.</p> <p>Out of the additional items that can be considered, Life Orb seems like a great alternative over Salac Berry, but greatly lowers Swoobat's longevity when used in tandem with Substitute. In addition, Salac Berry prevents Choice Scarf users from outspeeding it, and with the Speed boost, Stored Power actually hits harder than it would with Life Orb. Leftovers is another option to increase its longevity, but Swoobat is very frail anyway. In the place of Stored Power, Psyshock and Psychic are alternative STABs that can hit harder without the boost, but Swoobat is very weak without the boost and prefers the higher Base Power of Stored Power after setup. Hidden Power Ground can be used to hit Probopass, Bastiodon, and Skuntank super effectively, but then Swoobat loses the ability to OHKO Jynx, which in turn KOes it after Stealth Rock, even after a Calm Mind boost. Giga Drain is an interesting coverage move as it heals Swoobat after it gets into Salac Berry range, but it provides somewhat redundant coverage along with Stored Power.</p> <p>Swoobat despises having Stealth Rock on its side of the field, which makes Taunt users such as Serperior and Misdreavus, as well as Rapid Spinners such as Torkoal and Wartortle, good partners; all of them except Misdreavus also share decent synergy with Swoobat. Choice Band Sawk can also help against Stealth Rock setters, OHKOing many as Mold Breaker negates Sturdy. Probopass is a good choice for a partner as it takes Rock-, Ghost-, Ice-, and Dark-type attacks aimed at Swoobat, while also providing a slow Volt Switch to bring Swoobat in safely. Finally, dual screens support from the likes of the aforementioned Serperior is appreciated by Swoobat due to its paper-thin defenses.</p>"

  "Audino": {
    "overview": "<p>Audino seems like the typical bulky Normal-type, but it has a lot of notable niches that set it apart from its competition. To begin with, its ability, Regenerator, allows it to pass recovery from Wish to its teammates while healing itself on the switch. Audino's movepool is also filled with a wide variety of different support moves that few other Pokemon share with it. Audino is very bulky, and even with a specially defensive spread, it can take some neutral physical hits. Due to all of these unique defensive traits, Audino typically plays best on stall teams where no other Pokemon can fill quite the same role. Unfortunately, its awesome movepool and ability come with a price: it has much less bulk than its biggest rival, Lickilicky, leaving it less able to wall the strong special attackers in the tier. It also has significantly less offensive presence than Lickilicky, so it must rely on the recoil-inducing Double-Edge to keep from being setup fodder.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Audino's movepool is filled with plenty of options that can be used to tailor it to your team's needs. Encore is a great, somewhat rare, support move that can lock the opposing Pokemon into a setup move so that a teammate can handle it. Light Screen and Reflect are also difficult to come by in NU, and Audino can run a dedicated dual screens set. Rain Dance and Sunny Day are good options for weather teams. If you can find the room for it, Magic Coat can be used to reflect bothersome non-attacking moves such as Toxic, Taunt, and Stealth Rock. Yawn is a great utility move that can either open up a free switch for a teammate or put the opposing Pokemon to sleep. Knock Off can help make it easier for your teammates to beat Eviolite users such as Misdreavus. Trick Room is an option for a dedicated Trick Room team, though overall, dedicated Trick Room teams are very easy to exploit with priority and Taunt. A Calm Mind set is something that might seem appealing, but Audino needs multiple boosts in order to hit hard, and it's generally too slow to utilize the boosts well. Finally, Audino's offensive movepool has amazing coverage options, but unfortunately, it is generally far too weak to use them well.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The best way to defeat Audino is simple: just use Taunt against it. Because Audino is offensively lacking, preventing it from using its support moves generally makes it useless. Misdreavus can easily defeat Audino with Taunt, as it is immune to Double-Edge and can recover a lot of HP with Pain Split. Similarly, Golurk is immune to Double-Edge and Thunder Wave, and it can hit Audino hard and recover with Drain Punch, only fearing a Toxic on the switch. Toxic Spikes also wear down Audino quite a bit: while Audino might have Heal Bell to recover its status, Heal Bell only has 8 PP, and it has to use one every time it switches in if it wants to remove the status. Some of the tier's stronger special attackers, especially those carrying Focus Blast, can also break through Audino. Charizard is the best example of this. Fighting-types can also break through Audino relatively easily. Gurdurr and Throh get a special mention as their ability, Guts, makes it so that they benefit from status. Gothorita can also trap Audino and take it out so that it can't provide any support for the opposing team. Ultimately, you're better off trying to handle whatever Audino switches out to. Alone, Audino isn't a very threatening Pokemon; it is the support it provides more threatening Pokemon that makes it effective.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Cleric": {
        "description": "<p>With a cleric set, Audino is able to provide Heal Bell and Wish support for its team. Wish is used to pass on recovery to teammates that might have no other way to heal their HP. Heal Bell is helpful for removing crippling statuses from both itself and its teammates. Protect is really helpful despite the recovery that Regenerator provides upon switching. However, there are some times when you might want to keep Audino in to recover with its own Wish or you might not have anything else on your team to take a hit. Protect helps Audino make it through many clutch situations, and it can also be used to scout against Pokemon wielding a Choice item. Nevertheless, Toxic is still an invaluable move on Audino, as it can hit setup sweepers on the switch that think they can use Audino as setup fodder. Even so, because Audino is often used alongside Toxic Spikes, this might not be necessary for your team. Finally, Double-Edge is Audino's offensive move of choice and keeps it from being used as setup bait, as the recoil is usually not crippling due to its massive HP stat.</p> <p>Audino fully invests in HP and Special Defense despite equal defenses because many common physical attackers carry Fighting-type coverage. Audino also has access to a few other moves which it can take advantage of. On more balanced teams, Thunder Wave can be used to help neutralize many offensive threats. There are also a number of offensive moves you might want to try over Double-Edge, namely special attacks such as Flamethrower, Ice Beam, and Thunderbolt. Overall, the lack of STAB on these moves typically makes them inferior options, but if you need specific coverage for certain threats, they are still viable.</p> <p>There are a large variety of Pokemon that appreciate Audino's support. Bulky setup sweepers in particular love Heal Bell and Wish support, as an untimely burn or Toxic can cripple many of them, and recovery can give them another chance to sweep. Good examples of these Pokemon include Bulk Up Braviary, Calm Mind Musharna without Heal Bell, and Bulk Up Gurdurr. Other Pokemon that despise status and lack reliable recovery also appreciate Audino's support: Skuntank, Metang, and Regirock are all good examples. Golurk has the ability to annihilate Audino thanks to its immunity to Double-Edge and access to an Iron Fist-boosted Drain Punch. Mandibuzz, Alomomola, and Tangela all take on Golurk well, and they work well as partners with Audino in general. Finally, Misdreavus pairs well defensively with Audino, and because it often has no room to run Heal Bell itself, it appreciates Audino handling any status that it might be inflicted with.</p>"

  "Gurdurr": {
    "overview": "<p>As one of just a handful of viable Fighting-types in NU, Gurdurr carves a clear niche for itself as a bulky boosting sweeper and pivot. Gurdurr has a lot going for it in NU: it has decent defensive stats, augmented by Eviolite; STAB Drain Punch makes up for a lack of recovery; and base 105 Attack gives it good power. While it might be slow, Gurdurr has access to priority in the form of Mach Punch, allowing it to bypass faster would-be checks and KO them before they get the chance to strike. Additionally, two great abilities, Guts and Iron Fist, both help it do its job, one that no other Pokemon in NU can perform quite the same. Unfortunately, Gurdurr's low Speed and Special Defense can make it an easy target for some offensive Psychic-types, and even with Drain Punch, Gurdurr detests Spikes, an entry hazard that has increased significantly in prominence in the tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Despite its sets being very similar to one another, Gurdurr does have some other options you may want to consider. While a Choice Band set may sound worthwhile, it's a set that is generally outclassed by Sawk due to its greater power and Speed, and Gurdurr's good bulk with Eviolite is its main draw. A set with Substitute and Focus Punch could be used, but the lack of passive recovery and its inability to beat Gurdurr's typical checks and counters are both off-putting. A set with Rest, Sleep Talk, and Bulk Up is something to consider as well, although because it cannot beat Ghost-types and because Throh can perform this role better, it is generally unappealing. Low Sweep is an option to be considered on the bulky attacker set, as it can lower the Speed of potential switch-ins to make it easier for another Pokemon to set up or to finish off the slower foe. The only downside with Low Sweep is that Gurdurr generally prefers the recovery that Drain Punch provides; this is Gurdurr's only form of recovery, so losing it allows Gurdurr to be worn down by chip damage and hazards much more easily. Thunder Punch and Fire Punch might seem appealing, but they add little in terms of coverage. Facade is an option alongside Guts, but it relies on being statused--otherwise, it is dead weight. On a similar note, a status orb set with Guts can be used, but Gurdurr's low Speed and sub par bulk without Eviolite make it a very poor choice for a Guts sweeper. Finally, Taunt is an option on either set, but Gurdurr is far too slow to be running it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>In terms of checks and counters, you could just hope Gurdurr drops its iron girder on its foot! But if you are looking for a more sensible approach, feel free to keep reading. Musharna is one of the best checks to either set, as it can tank any move Gurdurr has to offer and retaliate with a STAB Psychic. It is also slower than Gurdurr, meaning that Payback will only have 50 Base Power when used against it. Misdreavus is a great check to sets running Iron Fist, as it can outspeed and burn Gurdurr, thus crippling it for the rest of the match; however, it can struggle against Guts sets and detests losing its Eviolite to Knock Off. Iron Fist boosted Ice Punch is a 3-4HKO against Golbat while Golbat can Taunt Gurdurr to prevent it from using Bulk Up, Roost off any damage from Ice Punch or Stone Edge, and strike back with a super effective Brave Bird. Vileplume only struggles to take an Ice Punch, and it can put Gurdurr to sleep, then switch out to an appropriate check. Charizard can take on Gurdurr to a decent extent, taking everything but Stone Edge well and KOing Gurdurr with Air Slash after just a bit of prior damage. Psychic-types, such as Gardevoir and Exeggutor, can switch in on Fighting-type moves with ease and KO Gurdurr with Psychic. Grumpig, on the other hand, can take any hit from Gurdurr and Whirlwind, fearing absolutely nothing Gurdurr has to use against it: Psychic resists Fighting, Thick Fat adds an Ice-type resistance, and Payback will always go first when Grumpig uses Whirlwind. Finally, Garbodor and Weezing can both Clear Smog against Bulk Up variants to remove the boosts that Gurdurr has gathered.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Although it is most often seen running a Bulk Up set, Gurdurr can also play the role of a bulky attacker and pivot for offensively oriented teams in need of a partner that can take a hit and dish one out. This set is also very bulky, but it forgoes the ability to boost and sweep teams for greater utility. Drain Punch is chosen as a reasonably powerful STAB that can make up for the lack of passive recovery from Leftovers. Mach Punch allows Gurdurr to come in and revenge kill faster offensive threats. Because of the prominence of frail attackers in NU, this quality is greatly appreciated for bulky offensive teams and offensive teams alike. Ice Punch should be used in the third slot for the most reliable coverage alongside Gurdurr's Fighting-type STAB, as it hits Flying-type and Vileplume for super effective damage. Knock Off can be used in the last slot to hinder the performance of the common bulky Pokemon, such as Alomomola, Misdreavus, and Tangela, that rely heavily on their item in order to function best. Alternatively, if you would prefer a way of hitting Bug-types, such as Pinsir, Stone Edge is a great option in the fourth slot.</p> <p>Eviolite is incredibly important for Gurdurr to run on this set, as its teammates will be relying on it to sponge hits, something it cannot do without the added bulk that Eviolite provides. Rock Slide can be used over Stone Edge for greater accuracy, although the lack of boosting item makes the added power of Stone Edge more appealing. Hammer Arm can be used in place of Drain Punch, trading perfect accuracy and recovery for added power. Toxic can be used in the last slot as an alternate way of handling bulky switch-ins, but it leaves you vulnerable to being set up on by Spikes users, such as Garbodor. Iron Fist is chosen for the ability on this set since the majority of the moves on the set are boosted, but Guts is an option if you are more concerned with absorbing status.</p> <p>This set struggles against Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon, making Skuntank a good partner. Gurdurr also still needs partners that can take special hits, but as it's also going to be taking many hits, specially defensive Pokemon that can pass it Wishes are appreciated--Audino and Lickilicky both perform this role well. Finally, offensive Pokemon that don't like taking hits play well with this set. SubDisable Haunter can escape Skuntank, a Pokemon that would otherwise cause it major problems, and pivot out into Gurdurr to take it on more efficiently.</p>"
      },
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>With Bulk Up, Gurdurr can play the role of a boosting sweeper, taking advantage of the boosts in defensive stats that Eviolite provides in order to help it set up. This set generally takes much longer to set up than other sweepers in the tier, such as Shell Smash Carracosta, Rain Dance Ludicolo, and Swords Dance Sawsbuck, but what it loses out in speed of setup, it more than makes up for in reliability. Bulk Up is used to raise Gurdurr's Attack and Defense, simultaneously helping it set up thanks to the Defense boosts and increasing its power to prepare for its sweep. Drain Punch is Gurdurr's most reliable STAB; thanks to the recovery the move provides, Gurdurr can continue to fight even in the face of Pokemon that could otherwise cripple it. Mach Punch is used on this set to ignore Gurdurr's poor Speed and to finish off many Pokemon that would otherwise outspeed and KO it. The last choice in move typically goes to Payback, a move that doubles in power if the user moves second, which Gurdurr generally will due to its low Speed. Payback allows Gurdurr to compensate for this flaw, and it also lets it beat Misdreavus one-on-one. Ice Punch can be used in this slot, however, should you already have a reliable check for Misdreavus, as it allows Gurdurr to beat Flying-types and Vileplume much more easily.</p> <p>Eviolite should always be used along with full HP investment to give Gurdurr much needed bulk. Attack investment is used over Special Defense investment, since many special attackers, such as Charizard, Gardevoir, and Musharna, can often beat it regardless of additional defensive investment. Guts is the preferred ability for this set, as it allows Gurdurr to absorb status that would otherwise cripple it or cut its sweep short. Guts is also the better ability to use for the potential matchup against Misdreavus, which very often carries Will-O-Wisp. If you run Heal Bell support on your team, Iron Fist can be used instead for the immediate power boost it provides; however, it should be noted that a burn will still cut a sweep short, since you'll have to call Gurdurr back in order to use Heal Bell. You can also use Stone Edge or Rock Slide on this set to hit Charizard or Articuno on a switch, but Golurk will then wall Gurdurr entirely.</p> <p>Skuntank partners well with this set due to its ability to beat Psychic- and Ghost-types that threaten it. Additionally, Metang can both provide Stealth Rock support and tank Flying- and Psychic-type attacks aimed toward Gurdurr. Bulky Rock-type Pokemon, such as Regirock, can also take Flying-type attacks while setting up Stealth Rock. As previously mentioned, Heal Bell support, while by no means required, is appreciated alongside Gurdurr to prevent an untimely Toxic from taking it down while it's getting ready to sweep. Finally, special walls, such as Audino, Lickilicky, and Mantine, are all appreciated to sponge attacks targeting Gurdurr's less impressive Special Defense stat.</p>"

  "Throh": {
    "overview": "<p>Throh has fantastic bulk and a solid Attack stat, but what really separates itself from similar Pokemon such as Gurdurr is its better special bulk and ability to phaze out troublesome opponents. Between these factors and its access to Bulk Up, Throh becomes extremely hard to stop after a few boosts. It also has a great ability in Guts, allowing it to absorb most forms of status and utilize RestTalk effectively. Its low Speed is hardly a hindrance due to its ability to plow through teams with the combination of Bulk Up and Circle Throw. However, it is weak to Psychic and Flying, two common attacking types in NU that can wear it down quickly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Throh can use a Toxic Orb alongside Guts to attack under Trick Room, with a moveset consisting of Superpower, Earthquake, Stone Edge, and Payback. However, such a set is extremely reliant on teammates to set up Trick Room for it, and it is not a very good strategy in the first place. Its reliance on Toxic Orb and Superpower also limits Throh's staying power, which is the main draw of using Throh in the first place. Toxic and Knock Off can be used to support Throh's teammates, but this is done better by Gurdurr due to the latter's access to Drain Punch. Brick Break is a powerful alternative STAB move that can break the opponent's dual screens, but it does not have the utility of phazing that Circle Throw does, and critical hits from Storm Throw ignore dual screens anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>It is very difficult to switch into Throh due to the threat of Circle Throw, especially with entry hazards on the field. Ghost-types are among the best counters as they are immune to Throh's STAB moves and completely wall bulky phazer Throh if it lacks Payback on the first set. SubDisable Drifblim and Haunter deserve a special mention as they completely wall Throh regardless of its moves by disabling Payback or Ice Punch. Bulky Psychic-types, such as Musharna, can tank a hit from Throh and retaliate with a powerful Psychic. Flying-types, such as Swellow and Braviary, can swiftly defeat Throh with a powerful Brave Bird, but they have trouble switching in unless they come in on a setup move. Pokemon with Taunt can prevent Throh from setting up or using Sleep Talk, making it easier to wear Throh down. Pokemon with Encore can also lock Throh into an unfavorable move and proceed to wear it down. Kadabra has Encore and deserves a special mention for its immunity to entry hazards and ability to quickly defeat Throh with Psychic. Mandibuzz and Golbat have access to Taunt and Toxic with which to defeat Throh. They also have access to Whirlwind to erase all of Throh's boosts even from behind a Substitute, and due to their higher Speed, can phaze before Throh's Circle Throw. Golbat even has access to Haze to remove any boosts that Throh has without resorting to negative priority. However, it should be noted that Circle Throw will still go before Whirlwind if called by Sleep Talk. Also, Mandibuzz has to take extra care when using Roost as Throh's STAB then becomes super effective.</p>",

      "Bulky Phazer": {
        "description": "<p>Circle Throw is Throh's best STAB option, as it can phaze while still doing damage, working very well alongside entry hazards. This also means that Throh's counters have a harder time switching in, as they must be careful of being phazed out. Bulk Up allows Throh to boost its Attack and Defense, allowing it to hit hard while being difficult to take down both physically and specially. Rest is Throh's only form of recovery, but serves its purpose adequately, allowing it to boost before healing itself, and adding to its longevity. As a bonus, it also allows Throh to hit harder while asleep thanks to Guts. Sleep Talk allows Throh to continue to damage and phaze opponents while asleep and avoid becoming a sitting duck. At the same time, it also gives Circle Throw neutral priority. Payback is another option as it is Throh's only way to hit Ghost-types, and forms perfect neutral coverage alongside Circle Throw.</p> <p>Leftovers should be used when running Sleep Talk, while Chesto Berry should be used with Payback, as if not running Sleep Talk you will want to spend the least possible amount of time asleep, and therefore defenseless. A specially defensive EV spread is used to make Throh tough to take down on the special side, while relying on Bulk Up to boost its Defense. However, a more offensive EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD with an Adamant nature can be used alongside a Chesto Berry to allow Throh to immediately hit harder when it wakes up. Teammates that lay down entry hazards are essential, because otherwise, Throh is not as potent a threat. It also helps that some of Throh's biggest counters are also those more weak to entry hazards and are thus more easily worn down by constant phazing. Metang is an excellent teammate, sponging Flying- and Psychic-type attacks for Throh while setting up Stealth Rock. Misdreavus is also a great partner as it blocks the opponent's attempts to Rapid Spin away the entry hazards, while burning physical attackers to allow Throh to set up more easily. Pursuit trapping is also appreciated to ease Throh's trouble with Ghost- and Psychic-types, especially the former, which Throh is unable to hit if not running Payback. Therefore, Skuntank is a great partner, as it can trap and remove Ghost- and Psychic-types for Throh and allow it an easier time sweeping.</p>"

      "Substitute + Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>This set allows Throh to set up on weak defensive Pokemon that have difficulty breaking its Substitute. Unlike the bulky phazer set, this variant of Throh is able to defeat stall with less team support and avoids status without relying on Rest. Substitute allows Throh to avoid status and revenge killers, and thanks to its good bulk, most walls are unable to break through it in one hit. Bulk Up boosts Throh's Attack and Defense, allowing it to hit hard while making its Substitute even harder to break with physical attacks. Storm Throw is Throh's most powerful reliable STAB move, and due to its nature of always landing critical hits, it allows Throh to defeat other Throh and Gurdurr that try to set up Bulk Up alongside it. Finally, Ice Punch gives Throh the best neutral coverage in two moves, hitting the likes of Drifblim and Roselia hard.</p> <p>Mold Breaker is the chosen ability as it allows Throh to OHKO offensive Carracosta through Solid Rock after Stealth Rock at +1 as well as OHKO Bastiodon through Sturdy before it gets phazed out. The HP EVs allow Throh to create 101 HP Substitutes that cannot be broken by Seismic Toss and Night Shade, allowing it to set up on Wartortle that lack Haze and Hypno if they use these moves. Alongside the given Special Defense EVs, Throh's Substitutes cannot be broken by weak moves from defensive Pokemon, including Tangela's Giga Drain, Roselia and Weezing's Sludge Bomb, Alomomola's Waterfall, and Regirock's Drain Punch, and Throh can proceed to set up on them. The Speed EVs allow Throh to outspeed Roselia and everything below that benchmark, including common walls such as Tangela and Alomomola. The rest of the EVs are placed into Attack to power up Throh. Unlike other sets, this variant of Throh can hit much harder immediately thanks to more investment in Attack and thus can perform well against offensive teams as well. Payback can be used over Ice Punch to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types slightly harder, but this fails to defeat Vileplume and Roselia, and Throh has no business staying in on the previously mentioned Ghost- and Psychic-types anyway. This variant of Throh despises status, especially Toxic Spikes, which limits its longevity as it is unable to rid itself of it. Hence, cleric support from the likes of Lickilicky and Audino is recommended. Grounded Poison-types, such as Garbodor, are also able to absorb Toxic Spikes. These Pokemon can also set up Toxic Spikes of their own to help Throh wear down bulky walls it otherwise cannot break, such as Musharna. Psychic-types are also problematic for this set due to their ability to tank hits from it and retaliate with a super effective STAB move. Hence, Skuntank and Liepard are good partners as they can Pursuit trap these Psychic-types and eliminate them for Throh. Finally, Metang makes for an excellent teammate, covering up on Throh's two weaknesses to Flying and Psychic while setting up Stealth Rock to aid in Throh's sweep.</p>"

  "Sawk": {
    "overview": "<p>Of all the Fighting-type Pokemon found in NU, Sawk secures its spot on many teams thanks to its incredible immediate power; its base 125 Attack makes it the strongest Fighting-type in the tier. Sawk's immense power isn't all that it has up its sleeve, though. It also has two great abilities, Sturdy and Mold Breaker, that help it perform its job. Additionally, thanks to its great coverage moves, it can be very difficult to wall. For these reasons, Sawk is often found on teams wielding a Choice item, meaning it can be rather predictable. Ultimately, despite its great power, its Speed, while above average, does not allow it to outpace out other common offensive threats, such as Tauros and Charizard.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>The above sets do the best job of utilizing Sawk's potential, but it does have some other options at its disposal. First off, Reversal can be used in the last slot on the Choice Scarf set; if Sawk is brought down to 1 HP due to Sturdy, it has a 200 Base Power STAB it can use to clean up the opposing team. A dedicated set with Reversal, Endure, and a Salac Berry can also be used, but it is unreliable due to its inability to beat Ghost-types and common priority users. A Fist Plate set with Fling can be used to bluff a Choice set and lure in common checks and counters, but once it uses Fling, it loses out on its item for the rest of the match. Additionally, Sawk can try out a Life Orb set with Pain Split, but it generally prefers to keep attacking rather than trying to recover its HP. Fire Punch and Thunder Punch are options to consider, though they don't add much in terms of coverage that the sets listed don't already provide. Sawk can also try an anti-lead set with Taunt, but Mold Breaker on the Choice Band set usually performs well enough when trying to prevent hazards from being set. Bulk Up is an option, but Sawk usually prefers the immediate power that the Choice Band set provides and Gurdurr usually performs this role better thanks to its priority and greater bulk. Finally, Counter can be used alongside Sturdy, but Sawk hits hard enough as it is.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Sawk is generally difficult to counter because of its sheer power, but there are a few Pokemon that handle it well enough. Misdreavus can switch into the majority of its sets; a Choice Band-boosted Earthquake is a 3HKO at best, and Misdreavus can retaliate with Will-O-Wisp. Musharna can also take any hit that Sawk has to dish out and recover the damage with Moonlight. As most Sawk are holding Choice items, knowing what move it is going to lock itself into is a great way to defeat it. Protect users are fairly reliable at this, because they are able to see what move Sawk uses and react accordingly. Pokemon with Regenerator, such as Tangela and Alomomola, can also switch into Sawk to scout, then switch into an appropriate check based on whichever move it is using. Garbodor can switch into a Close Combat and set up Spikes against Sawk, but it must watch out for Earthquake. Similarly, Weezing only fears Earthquake and can burn Sawk with Will-O-Wisp. Golbat takes little damage from Close Combat and no damage from Earthquake, and it can OHKO Sawk with Brave Bird. Offensively, strong priority moves, such as Fake Out from Kangaskhan or Mach Punch from Gurdurr, can deal a sizable amount of damage to Sawk, but it does have some bulk behind it--a simple Bullet Punch from Metang won't take it out alone. Finally, Swellow can KO Sawk easily, though it cannot outspeed Choice Scarf sets and cannot switch directly into Sawk.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Sawk performs best with a Choice Band, serving as a wallbreaker that can punch holes through entire teams. Its fantastic Attack stat means that not much wants to switch in; even some of the tier's premier physical walls, particularly Alomomola and Tangela, cannot switch into Close Combat without fearing a 2HKO. Close Combat is chosen for this reason; it is Sawk's best STAB, thanks to its high Base Power with limited drawbacks. Earthquake can hit three of the most common switches into Sawk--Garbodor, Misdreavus, and Weezing--thanks to Mold Breaker. Ice Punch is the best way that Sawk has to deal with Golurk and Vileplume, and it also provides great coverage alongside its STAB. Finally, Stone Edge is used in the last slot as a move that can hit Bug- and Flying-types on the switch, though its accuracy is a bit off-putting.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is used on this set in order for Sawk to 2HKO Alomomola and Tangela after Stealth Rock. A Jolly nature can be used to tie with opposing Pokemon with base 85 Speed and outspeed all slower ones, though the 2HKO on Alomomola and Tangela is much more important. Mold Breaker is by far the best ability on the set, as it allows Sawk to bypass abilities such as Sturdy and Levitate, which would otherwise give this set problems. In particular, Sawk can OHKO common Stealth Rock leads, such as Probopass and Golem, keeping entry hazards off your side of the field.</p> <p>When considering partners for this set, the first thing to consider is entry hazards of your own. Metang and Regirock can switch into Psychic- and Flying-type attacks directed at Sawk and set up Stealth Rock. Spikes support is also helpful, making Garbodor a good partner, although you should watch out for the shared Psychic-type weakness. Because this set struggles against Ghost- and Psychic-types, Skuntank makes a good partner due to its ability to trap and kill those Pokemon. Ultimately, anything that appreciates physical walls taken out plays well with Sawk. Late-game cleaners in particular, such as Carracosta and Swellow, both work well with Sawk for this reason.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Though not as strong as the Choice Band set, Sawk can still run an effective Choice Scarf set. Although many common Choice Scarf users in the tier sport a higher base Speed, none of them can hit as hard as Sawk. With a Choice Scarf equipped, Sawk can serve as a revenge killer and a late game cleaner. Once again, Close Combat is chosen as Sawk's STAB of choice because of its high Base Power. Ice Punch is used for its coverage and reliability once more, as it hits Golurk and Vileplume harder than the other moves of this set. Stone Edge hits Flying- and Bug-types that resist Close Combat, while also hitting Ghost-types outside of Golurk for greater damage. The last slot is open to your choice, although Toxic is typically the best option here. While it is not the best move to lock Sawk into, it can cripple switch-ins that would brush off the rest of the set, while also potentially fooling your opponent into thinking Sawk is not Choice-locked. Earthquake can be used instead to hit Poison-types, such as Garbodor, but it's a much more dangerous move to lock into without Mold Breaker since two of the most common switches into Sawk, Weezing and Misdreavus, have Levitate. Finally, Knock Off can bother common switch-ins such as Misdreavus, Tangela, and Alomomola, either through decreasing the bulk of Tangela and Misdreavus by removing Eviolite, or ridding Alomomola of passive recovery from Leftovers.</p> <p>This set runs an Adamant nature in lieu of a Jolly nature, as the only Pokemon that are outsped with a Jolly nature are +2 Modest Gorebyss and Choice Scarf users with base 80 Speed or above. Since all of these Pokemon are rare enough in the metagame, the extra power is preferred over the extra Speed in order to help Sawk clean up later in the game. However, a Jolly nature can still be used if you feel as though outspeeding these Pokemon is worth the loss in power. Sturdy is the chosen ability on this set, as it allows Sawk a fail-safe against faster foes.</p> <p>For this reason, anti-leads such as Misdreavus and Serperior, both of which can beat common Stealth Rock leads with Taunt and either Will-O-Wisp or a strong STAB move, are appreciated to keep entry hazards off the field and keep Sawk's Sturdy intact. Armaldo can use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards from your side of the field while also carrying STAB X-Scissor to help beat Psychic-types that threaten Sawk. The only problem with Armaldo is that, much like Sawk, it struggles to beat Ghost-types that can block its Rapid Spin. Skuntank can be used to remedy this problem, as it can trap and beat many of the Ghost- and Psychic-types in the tier. Since this set aims to clean up the opponent's team later in the game, it appreciates partners that can wear down the opponent's team and break down the Pokemon that wall it. For the former, Pokemon that can set entry hazards, such as Garbodor and Golem, are appreciated, while Eelektross and Taunt Serperior can beat many common walls in the tier.</p>"

  "Basculin": {
    "overview": "<p>Basculin's primary advantage over other Water-types in the tier comes from its useful ability, Adaptability. Because of its ability, Basculin's Water-type moves are noticeably stronger than those of other physically attacking Water-types in the tier, such as Samurott, Carracosta, and Floatzel. In addition to this, Basculin is fairly fast, and the ability to outspeed many dangerous offensive Pokemon such as Sawk, is a valuable asset. Despite this offensive advantage, Basculin can be relatively easy to wall with the correct Pokemon due to its heavy dependency on its STAB moves. The aforementioned Water-types also have wider movepools than Basculin, giving them an advantage in coverage, and a few also have setup options. Overall, if you need a physically attacking Water-type, consider Basculin, but be sure to utilize its niche well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Basculin's rather pitiful movepool leaves it with few other options. Basculin has Mold Breaker, which can be useful because it can outspeed and OHKO most Stealth Rock leads, such as Golem, with its STAB, but it is otherwise inferior to Adaptability. Ice Beam can be used to surprise Tangela and Dragon-types, but its usage stops there. Taunt can be used to nearly shut down Alomomola, but this turns into a stalemate without Toxic, as Basculin has no prayer of actually defeating Alomomola directly. Crunch is Basculin's only way to hit Frillish, but it is rare enough to practically ignore. Basculin has access to Agility, but Floatzel's access to Swift Swim makes it a better Pokemon at boosting its Speed. An Expert Belt can be used to bluff a Choice set to surprise Pokemon, notably Frillish with Crunch, when they expect a free switch, but neutral targets are hit for relatively little damage in this case. Expert Belt also has the advantage of being able to surprise most Stealth Rock leads with a combination of Waterfall and Aqua Jet, preventing them from activating their Custap Berries, which is important if you don't want to use Mold Breaker. Finally, Final Gambit is an interesting option to take down just about anything, but it is extremely risky since Basculin will faint afterwards, and its HP isn't very high without investment. It also wastes Basculin's potential to clean up late-game.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Frillish is the definition of a counter for the Choice Band set, as it is immune to everything listed on the set, only fearing the rare Crunch. Aside from that, Alomomola does extremely well against Basculin, taking little damage from all of its moves and allowing it to stall out Basculin. Tangela also takes little damage from Basculin's moves and can easily dispatch it with a Giga Drain. Other Grass-types can also switch into Basculin's STAB moves easily; specific examples are Leafeon, thanks to its massive Defense stat, and Serperior, which can set up on it. Dragon-types, such as Fraxure and Shelgon, also resist Water, and their bulk can be further augmented by an Eviolite, allowing them to set up Dragon Dance against Basculin. Although Seismitoad and Ludicolo risk getting 2HKOed by a coverage move, their ability to easily tank Water-type attacks allow them to switch into Basculin's STAB move, forcing it to switch out. Finally, many Pokemon can revenge kill it, including Electabuzz and Choice Scarf Rotom-S, but note that many revenge killers take a surprising amount of damage from Aqua Jet and can't switch into a Waterfall.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>The best way to use Basculin is by using a simple Choice Band set. However, prediction is necessary to make this set work—there are many Pokemon that can absorb Water-type moves in NU, including Lapras and Seismitoad, and allowing them to freely switch in could result in them using the opportunity to set up. As a result, Pokemon such as these must be dealt with via coverage moves or with other Pokemon before Basculin can freely use its STAB moves. Waterfall is its main STAB option; because it's powered up by Adaptability, it hits fairly hard. Basculin's Aqua Jet is the strongest in the tier thanks to Adaptability, and because of this, it is powerful enough to 2HKO frailer foes, such as Primeape, which discourages them from switching in to revenge kill it. Double-Edge allows Basculin to get nearly perfect coverage, hitting every Pokemon in NU bar Cradily, Shedinja, and NFEs for at least neutral damage. Furthermore, it is powerful enough to 2HKO Pokemon that absorb Water-type moves, such as non-physically defensive Seismitoad and Mantine. Superpower is mostly filler, but its high Base Power allows it to inflict massive damage to certain foes weak to the move, including Miltank, Lickilicky, Carracosta, and Cradily.</p> <p>Despite the prediction that this set needs to be successful, a Choice Band is the preferred item for a few reasons. Basculin, especially late-game, rarely finds itself switching moves, meaning being locked into the move isn't as big of a deal. In addition, the extra power is needed for Basculin to have a chance at 2HKOing foes such as Seismitoad with Double-Edge, making a Life Orb slightly underwhelming. Adaptability is heavily suggested for Basculin in order to give it the power it needs to rival its competition. In regards to moveslots, Toxic is a usable alternative to surprise Pokemon that wall it, such as Alomomola and Tangela, but having this move sacrifices coverage and being locked into a non-damaging move can be taken advantage of. Return can be used over Double-Edge if you dislike the recoil damage and do not mind the power drop, but missing out on certain 2HKOs, such as on Seismitoad, could potentially prove game-changing.</p> <p>As previously mentioned, Basculin struggles against Alomomola and Tangela, as both have a very high Defense stat and resist Water. For this reason, Electabuzz is a great partner, as it has Vital Spirit to take a Sleep Powder from Tangela, and it has an Electric-type STAB in order to handle Alomomola. Grass-types that aren't Tangela can also prove to be annoying, as they resist Water. Due to this, Flying-types, such as Braviary and Swellow, can be good partners, easily OHKOing most Grass-types. Although Basculin can hit most of them hard, Pokemon that absorb Water-type moves, including Seismitoad and Lapras, along with Ludicolo, can easily switch into Basculin's STAB. To ease prediction, Electabuzz can help once again because it outspeeds them all and hits most of them hard in return. Eelektross makes a good partner as well, hitting all of them hard with the appropriate move. Eelektross also provides a slow U-turn or Volt Switch to allow Basculin to get on the field safely.</p>"

  "Maractus": {
    "overview": "<p>Maractus is outclassed as a Grass-type in nearly every aspect. Roselia and Cacturne outclass it as a Spikes user, while Victreebel, Exeggutor, and most other Chlorophyll Pokemon outclass it as a sun sweeper. Its best niche is a utility Spikes setter that can defeat a few common leads, such as Golem and Seismitoad. Maractus is rather slow, though it is less hindering as it still outspeeds most common Stealth Rock users. With a bland movepool and low bulk, Maractus has little else to make it stand out and should stick to its small role.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Maractus can make use of Chlorophyll by setting up Sunny Day along with Spikes, making it the fastest Spikes user in the sun. Unfortunately, Maractus doesn't set up both moves very often due to its mediocre bulk, even with investment. Knock Off can be used to cripple certain Pokemon, but it isn't really worth the moveslot. Cotton Guard can patch up Maractus's poor Defense, but it is still vulnerable to special moves. A physically offensive set with Wood Hammer, Sucker Punch, Drain Punch, and Substitute can be used, but it is entirely outclassed by Cacturne and Maractus has mediocre Attack. Grass Whistle can cripple a Pokemon, but the horrible accuracy makes it unworthy of a moveslot most of the time.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>It isn't too hard to counter Maractus, and there are ways to stop it from setting up Spikes as well. Kangaskhan easily stops Maractus by using Fake Out to break its Focus Sash and then using Double-Edge to finish it off. Natu completely walls Maractus and bounces back its Spikes, and doesn't take much damage even from Sucker Punch. Most Taunt users can stop Maractus from setting up Spikes, and many, such as Serperior, Skuntank, and Misdreavus, take little from any of its moves. Mandibuzz is notable as it can also Roost off any possible damage to basically ignore all of Maractus's moves. Rapid Spin users, such as Torkoal and Armaldo, can remove the Spikes Maractus sets up, though Maractus can defeat Wartortle. Jynx can use Lovely Kiss to prevent Maractus from setting up, though it has to be wary of Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Maractus is frail and slow, so most offensive Pokemon have no trouble taking it out. Fire-types, such as Rapidash and Charizard, can easily defeat Maractus. Charizard even has a chance to prevent Maractus from setting up Spikes thanks to Air Slash's flinch chance. Flying-types, such as Swellow and Rotom-S, can also easily handle Maractus. Most Grass-types, such as Roselia and Tangela, wall Maractus and can hit it with a super effective move or put it to sleep. Any offensive Pokemon that can take a Sucker Punch has a good chance of 2HKOing Maractus and limiting the amount of Spikes it can set up.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Spikes": {
        "description": "<p>This set makes the best use of Maractus by using it as a lead against some common Stealth Rock setters. Spikes is the best support move Maractus has, and it usually has at least one opportunity to set up if you lead with Maractus. Bullet Seed is what differentiates this set from Cacturne, as Maractus is the only Grass-type in NU that can legally use it alongside Spikes. It allows Maractus to defeat Golem even through Sturdy, which is useful to prevent it from setting up Stealth Rock. Grass Knot is a more reliable and powerful STAB move that allows Maractus to OHKO Golurk and physically defensive Seismitoad before it can set up Stealth Rock. Sucker Punch provides useful priority, and helps damage Pokemon that Maractus can't outspeed.</p> <p>Maractus has poor bulk, so a Focus Sash is the best way to guarantee that Maractus survives at least one turn. The EVs allow Maractus to OHKO Golurk and outspeed Jolly Golem. Max Attack investment allows Maractus to have a good chance to OHKO utility Golem with three hits from Bullet Seed. Hidden Power Ice is a possible option as it allows Maractus to threaten the rare Altaria, while Hidden Power Rock lets it threaten Charizard and other Fire-types. Giga Drain can be used over Grass Knot as a reliable STAB move, but the lower power prevents it from OHKOing Golurk and Maractus is too frail to make the recovery meaningful. Endeavor is a viable move with Focus Sash, as Maractus is frail enough to be hit down to one HP most of the time. As Maractus aims to set up Spikes, Ghost-types, such as Haunter and Drifblim, are good teammates to prevent them from easily being removed by Rapid Spin. Golurk is a notable teammate as it lures out Seismitoad and Jynx for Maractus, allowing it to OHKO them with Grass Knot and Sucker Punch respectively. Rock-types, such as Golem and Regirock, are valuable teammates as they can handle Kangaskhan and the Fire- and Flying-types that threaten Maractus; as a bonus, they can also set up Stealth Rock to complement the Spikes Maractus sets up. Charizard is a good teammate, as it appreciates Maractus's ability to defeat common Stealth Rock setters and Water-types; in return, Charizard can overpower Grass-types and several Taunt users, such as Serperior and Misdreavus.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Entry hazards are the only reason to use Dwebble in NU, and there are no better options than what is in the Custap Berry set. Dwebble has a very shallow movepool, so there are not many other options. You can attempt an offensive approach with a Shell Smash set consisting of Stone Edge, X-Scissor, and Earthquake, but even at +2, Dwebble is still weak and fails to hit hard.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Taunt is a very effective method of dispatching of Dwebble, so Skuntank and Serperior can do a good job of keeping it in check. They can force it out, and if it doesn't switch back in fast enough, Stealth Rock can break its Sturdy. Pokemon that commonly carry multi-hit moves such as Rock Blast Golem and Icicle Spear Piloswine are also threatening because they tend to lead and are able to break through Dwebble's Sturdy and KO it. However, it's worth noting that the latter is only a problem for Knock Off variants as Piloswine can't OHKO through Sturdy with negative investment. Mold Breaker Sawk also gives problems to Dwebble. Lastly, Rapid Spin users are the bane of its existence; even if you carry a spinblocker, there are some Rapid Spin users, such as Shell Smash Torkoal and Foresight Wartortle, that can beat them.</p>",

What separates it from the other entry hazards users is its ability to use both Spikes and Stealth Rock. These two moves are mandatory on this set, and with a Custap Berry and Sturdy, Dwebble is almost always guaranteed at least Stealth Rock or one layer of Spikes. The third move depends on what you prefer: Endure allows Dwebble to survive a hit and get to Custap range after Sturdy has been broken or when an attack didn't do enough damage to get there. Knock Off is useful to cripple Misdreavus, as thanks to its Levitate ability, it doesn't take much damage from entry hazards, and its immunity to Spikes is very annoying for Dwebble's teammates. Endure is almost always the superior option, though, because Knock Off's only real uses is to cripple Misdreavus. The last moveslot, Rock Blast, is mostly a filler and prevents occasional Ninjask leads setting up on you while it lays down entry hazards.</p> <p>Jolly and max Speed makes Dwebble as fast as possible, and allows it to outspeed the most common Taunt user, Misdreavus, before it can prevent Dwebble from doing its job. A few HP EVs paired with Endure allows it to lay down a few entry hazards while taking some hits, but if you opt to use Knock Off in lieu of Endure, 0 HP EVs and 0 IVs in HP, Defense, and Special Defense can be used to reach Custap Berry range more easily. Toxic can be used over Rock Blast if you're using Knock Off in the third moveslot, as Rock Blast is very weak without (and even with) investment.</p> <p>Ghost-types, such as Misdreavus, Drifblim, Haunter, and Golurk, are Dwebble's best friends, as they can prevent the opponent's Pokemon from using Rapid Spin and spinning away the entry hazards.

    "overview": "<p>Scraggy's Dark/Fighting typing, shared only with its evolution, allows it to check numerous Psychic-type Pokemon while granting it neutral coverage on everything in NU. Eviolite gives Scraggy some solid bulk to work with, and Shed Skin allows it to break free of status, such as poison from Garbodor's Toxic and burn from Misdreavus's Will-O-Wisp. Along with this, Scraggy also has two good boosting moves, Bulk Up and Dragon Dance, to boost its middling Attack to high levels. However, its Attack is very low before a boost, and as such, Scraggy will need a couple of turns to be a real threat. It also has two common weaknesses to Fighting- and Flying-type attacks, which often limit its chances to set up. Scraggy is also very slow, meaning even after one Dragon Dance boost, faster Pokemon, such as Choice Scarf Primeape and Charizard, can still outspeed it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Head Smash and Stone Edge are both usable options to handle Flying-types better, although their poor accuracy does not do them any favors and the former's massive recoil is often detrimental. Dragon Tail is a usable option for phazing and allows Scraggy to rack up entry hazard damage. Low Sweep can be used to make it easier for Scraggy to outspeed its foes, but the move is very weak in general. Zen Headbutt, Fire Punch, and Thunder Punch are all decent coverage options, although they provide nothing notable that Scraggy's STABs don't already cover.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fighting-types and Flying-types are the best ways to handle Scraggy. Primeape and Sawk are capable of quickly making work of Scraggy with Close Combat, but be aware that they cannot OHKO it if Scraggy has accumulated enough Bulk Up boosts. Gurdurr can boost alongside Scraggy and defeat it. Rotom-S, Swellow, and Braviary are also viable options; the former can also use Trick to remove Scraggy's Eviolite. Weezing is extremely bulky and can take anything Scraggy has to offer; it also has Haze to reset any boosts Scraggy may have attained. Tangela is also very bulky and can use Leech Seed and Giga Drain to chip away at Scraggy's HP. Finally, any user of Trick or Taunt can neuter Scraggy and make it a complete non-threat.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>This is arguably Scraggy's best set in the NU metagame, as its solid bulk with Eviolite and its useful typing allow it to grab Bulk Up boosts as it likes. It stands out from its biggest competitor, Gurdurr, with its Dark typing, which allows it to take on Psychic- and Ghost-types decently. It is also bulky enough that, after a number of boosts, even super effective moves, such as Sawk and Primeape's Close Combats, are unable to OHKO it. Its ability, Shed Skin, is excellent, as it lets Scraggy become an excellent counter to Musharna and Misdreavus. Bulk Up is Scraggy's form of boosting, bolstering its bulk and power to tremendous levels. Drain Punch is Scraggy's primary STAB move, and also provides it with a decent form of recovery. Crunch is Scraggy's secondary STAB move, providing excellent coverage with Drain Punch, and is part of what makes Scraggy an excellent Musharna and Misdreavus counter. Finally, Rest is a form of recovery should Scraggy be low on health; Shed Skin also makes it more reliable than it would normally be.</p> <p>A specially defensive spread is chosen as Scraggy's typing allows it to better check special attackers and its Defense is getting boosted by Bulk Up anyway. Payback is a usable option over Crunch, as Scraggy is very slow and can usually use it at full power. However, running it means Scraggy cannot effectively counter Musharna. Garbodor and Golurk make viable options for partners, resisting Fighting-type moves and providing entry hazard support. Musharna has excellent defensive synergy with Scraggy and can spread paralysis to make its job easier. Rotom-S also has excellent defensive synergy and offensive synergy, as it is capable of eliminating Primeape, Sawk, and Swellow, which all trouble Scraggy.</p>"
      },
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Scraggy stands out from other Dragon Dance users with its excellent coverage in its STABs alone and its access to Shed Skin. Scraggy is also fairly bulky with Eviolite, and its typing, which grants it useful resistances to Psychic- and Rock-type moves, allows it to grab boosts with relative ease. Although its Speed doesn't look too great, it is good enough for Scraggy to succeed. Dragon Dance is the main move of the set, as Scraggy aims to be a sweeper with it. High Jump Kick is chosen as the main STAB move for its raw power. Crunch complements it well, pummeling Musharna and Misdreavus while giving Scraggy effectively perfect coverage. Finally, Drain Punch is a reliable move that also allows Scraggy to heal its HP.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Attack and Speed to make the most out of Dragon Dance. A Jolly nature is chosen to make sure Scraggy can outspeed base 95 Speed Pokemon, such as Haunter and Sawsbuck, after a boost from Dragon Dance. Shed Skin is the preferred ability to makes sure Scraggy doesn't get crippled by status as it boosts. Moxie is a useful alternative to grab more Attack boosts and make it easier for Scraggy to sweep after a boost. However, this means Scraggy is more vulnerable to status. Ice Punch is a usable option over Drain Punch to deliver a harder blow to Rotom-S and Altaria, but this rarely is helpful over the recovery provided by Drain Punch, as Crunch provides enough coverage in most situations. As Scraggy is a sweeper, it appreciates entry hazard support; Garbodor is a solid option for providing this, as it resists Fighting-type moves and can attract Psychic- and Rock-type moves for Scraggy to set up on. Rotom-S has excellent defensive and offensive synergy with Scraggy and can also use Volt Switch to send it in safely. Finally, Musharna is a great choice for its synergy and can spread paralysis with Thunder Wave to help Scraggy deal with faster threats such as Choice Scarf Primeape and Charizard.</p>"

  "Carracosta": {
    "overview": "<p>Carracosta is one of the best setup sweepers in NU, as it can set up on many offensive Pokemon and tank super effective hits thanks to its ability, Solid Rock. Carracosta has a great offensive typing and powerful STAB options, making it very difficult to defeat if it sets up Shell Smash. However, aside from being an offensive sweeper, Carracosta can also run a tank set with Stealth Rock. Carracosta's awful Speed stat might be the only thing holding it back, but having access to Aqua Jet mitigates that weakness somewhat. After Carracosta sets up a Shell Smash, it can be really devastating and game-changing.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Carracosta is very versatile, so it has many other options to choose from. A fully physically defensive spread with Solid Rock and a moveset consisting of Stealth Rock, Scald, Rock Slide, and Toxic can hit hard and potentially burn opponents with Scald or cripple them with Toxic. Additionally, an offensive Swift Swim set consisting of Waterfall, Stone Edge, Hidden Power Grass, and either Aqua Jet or Stealth Rock is great to consider if Carracosta is used on a rain team. Flail with a Liechi Berry and Sturdy is an extremely situational tactic to OHKO Alomomola at +3 after Stealth Rock damage. Carracosta can use its Shell Smash to power up its specially offensive attacks, which does well against physical walls, but it's weaker than the physically attacking version. Mystic Water can be used to specifically power up Carracosta's Water-type attacks, but its other attacks are then noticeably weaker. A Choice Band set is plausible, as Carracosta has many other physical attacking moves to use, such as Earthquake, Superpower, Body Slam, and Low Kick. However, it has the potential to lose too much momentum for the team.</p> <p>Carracosta can also utilize many other moves. Curse is great for increasing Carracosta's tanking prowess, and it can be used in the tank set to defeat Sub Bulk Up Braviary much easier, but with Carracosta wielding no reliable source of recovery, it isn't very effective. Ice Beam can hit Tangela harder, but unfortunately that is all it really offers to Carracosta. Icy Wind and Bulldoze are both situational moves that can lower the Speed of Carracosta's faster threats, but even so it is still quite slow. Carracosta can be a rain inducer with Damp Rock, but there are generally other Pokemon better suited for that role. Rest is Carracosta's only recovery source, but it leaves itself wide open during the two turns of sleep. Finally, Rock Polish can raise Carracosta's Speed without the defense drops, but unlike Shell Smash, Rock Polish does little to increase Carracosta's offensive presence.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Tangela is the best counter to Carracosta, fearing only the very rare Ice Beam. Grass-types in general, such as Serperior and Vileplume, are great counters to Carracosta as well. Seismitoad and Alomomola can tank any of Carracosta's attacks and retaliate with Earth Power or cripple it with Toxic respectively. Specially offensive Samurott fares pretty well against Carracosta too, as it can OHKO Carracosta with Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p>Carracosta also has its fair share of checks. Sawk locked into Close Combat can severely weaken Carracosta, but it doesn't enjoy switching into any of Carracosta's attacks except for Stone Edge. Gurdurr is a good check to the tank set, as it does not mind being hit by Toxic and can tank a Waterfall comfortably. Toxic Spikes will wear Carracosta down very easily, so Pokemon that can set them up, such as Garbodor and Roselia, are great checks. Even with Solid Rock, hitting Carracosta with consistently powerful attacks is your best bet at defeating it, as it gets worn down very quickly. A great way to make Carracosta less threatening is to stop it from setting up Shell Smash by utilizing offensive pressure or Taunt.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<p>With its great bulk in unison with Solid Rock, Carracosta can set up Shell Smash on a variety of Pokemon, including Kangaskhan, Tauros, Swellow, and Sawk and Primeape that are not locked into Close Combat. Once Carracosta has set up, it can completely flip the outcome of the game. After a Shell Smash boost, Carracosta can 2HKO Alomomola and OHKO Audino, Braviary, Kangaskhan, and Lickilicky. It should be noted, however, that Carracosta cannot switch into Kangaskhan to set up. Waterfall and Stone Edge are Carracosta's STAB moves, hitting the majority of the tier for at least neutral damage. Aqua Jet is Carracosta's STAB priority move, revenge killing weakened threats and many Choice Scarf users.</p> <p>Solid Rock is what permits Carracosta to set up on many Pokemon, as it weakens super effective attacks for Carracosta. The EV spread with an Adamant nature allows Carracosta to outspeed neutral base 98 Speed Pokemon, such as Swanna and Basculin, after a Shell Smash boost. However, a Jolly nature can be used to allow Carracosta to outspeed base 113 Pokemon and below, such as Serperior, once it's at +2. A Lum Berry and Sturdy is an option to guarantee Carracosta sets up Shell Smash at full HP. A Liechi Berry with Sturdy is also plausible, with the main advantage being having similar power to Life Orb, minus the recoil. However, it is harder to pull off successfully. Rock Slide can replace Stone Edge for better accuracy, but the loss in power is noticeable. Likewise, Aqua Tail can be used over Waterfall as a slightly stronger STAB move, but the decrease in accuracy can hinder Carracosta. Hidden Power Grass can hit Seismitoad and Alomomola harder and more reliably than Carracosta's other moves, but it would have to give up Waterfall and have a Naughty nature to make the most of it.</p> <p>Carracosta appreciates entry hazards on the field to make it easier to score OHKOs on Pokemon such as Primeape and Misdreavus. Golurk and Piloswine are good partners as entry hazard setters. Toxic Spikes are huge issue for Carracosta; they make it harder for Carracosta to set up and maintain longevity. Poison-types, specifically Garbodor and Roselia, can absorb Toxic Spikes for Carracosta. Seismitoad can tank Carracosta's attacks and OHKO with Earth Power, so Pokemon who can deal with it, such as Ludicolo and Vileplume, make great allies. Muk is also a good partner for Carracosta, as it can not only be a great counter to Tangela, but it can also use its ability, Poison Touch, to weaken threats such as Misdreavus, Alomomola, and Seismitoad for Carracosta to KO. Muk can also use Memento to give Carracosta a chance to set up. LumRest Exeggutor, Gothorita, and Charizard can deal with all of Carracosta's counters, specifically Alomomola and Tangela, very well, so they make great partners.</p>"
      },
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Carracosta's great bulk with Solid Rock. Carracosta has great potential as a tank, as it can take a hit and deliver one back without much difficulty. With its fantastic physical bulk, Carracosta finds many opportunities to set up Stealth Rock against the many Normal- and Flying-types in the tier. Waterfall and Stone Edge are Carracosta's STAB moves, which boast great coverage against the majority of the tier. Aqua Jet allows Carracosta to bypass its poor Speed stat and pick off weakened foes. However, Toxic holds that surprise factor, crippling walls such as Tangela, Alomomola, and Seismitoad that Carracosta would have trouble defeating otherwise.</p> <p>248 HP EVs grant maximum bulk to Carracosta while getting the most HP recovery from Leftovers. 252 Atk EVs with an Adamant nature prevent Carracosta from being offensively weak; however, those EVs can be placed in Defense for more bulk. Rocky Helmet is optional for racking up extra damage on physically offensive Pokemon that Carracosta switches into. With Solid Rock, Carracosta can take super effective attacks more easily; it can avoid an OHKO from Choice Scarf Rotom-S's Thunderbolt and easily tank Kangaskhan's Earthquake. Rock Slide and Aqua Tail can replace the original STAB moves for more accuracy or power, respectively. Knock Off is great for crippling opponents by removing their item, specifically Tangela or Misdreavus's Eviolite. It's hard to fit Knock Off into this set, however.</p> <p>Carracosta has no reliable recovery, so Heal Bell and Wish users are great allies. Lickilicky can provide both, while Vileplume can provide the latter. Miltank can also be used for Heal Bell support while handling Grass-types for Carracosta with its Sap Sipper. Seismitoad and Samurott are both notable threats to Carracosta, and Serperior and Ludicolo can be used to handle both of them. As Carracosta's main goal is to get Stealth Rock on the field, sweepers that appreciate entry hazard support, such as Pinsir and Ludicolo, are good partners. As Carracosta wants to keep Stealth Rock on the field for its team, having spinblockers, such as Misdreavus, which can offer Heal Bell and Will-O-Wisp support, and Golurk, are good allies. Finally, LumRest Exeggutor and Charizard all both great partners, as they can deal with Carracosta's counters in their own respective ways.</p>"

  "Garbodor": {
    "overview": "<p>Access to Spikes and Toxic Spikes alongside great bulk has enabled Garbodor to carve itself a niche as a bulky hazard setter. Its decent defensive typing gives it key resistances and the ability to absorb opposing Toxic Spikes, making Garbodor a great team supporter. As a result, it is a very capable Spikes setter in the metagame. Unfortunately for Garbodor, its typing is a double-edged sword, giving it weaknesses to two extremely common attacking types in NU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>If you're really desperate, a suicide lead with Weak Armor does have some potential; however, this wastes Garbodor's good bulk and resistances. In a similar vein, Explosion can be used, but Garbodor's longevity is its main selling point. Garbodor has a wide special movepool with moves such as Sludge Bomb, Thunderbolt, Giga Drain, and even Acid Spray, but it has an awful Special Attack stat to use them with. It has several setup options, including Curse, Stockpile, Amnesia, and Rock Polish. However, Curse does not bring out Garbodor's full potential, Stockpile and Amnesia are just wastes of a moveslot. Garbodor can set up Rain Dance and Sunny Day, but it doesn't benefit from either of them and has far better things it can be doing. Substitute is a viable option, but Garbodor usually doesn't have the room for it and would rather use free turns to set up Spikes. Finally, RestTalk can be used as a form of recovery if Pain Split doesn't cut it, but Garbodor loses far too much utility by doing so.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Ground-types can easily come in on anything but the rare Seed Bomb and dispose of Garbodor with their STAB moves. Bulky Psychic-types, such as Musharna, Gothorita, and Duosion, have little to fear from Garbodor and can set up against it, the latter two even using it to its advantage, as Gothorita can trap Garbodor, while Duosion does not care about passive damage. Frailer Psychic-types such as Gardevoir can also check it well but have difficulty switching in on an attack. Most special attackers can beat Garbodor one-on-one due to its more physically-inclined defensive typing. Ghost-types, such as Misdreavus and Haunter, are immune to Spikes, resist Garbodor's STAB, and can set up on it, though Haunter must be wary of Rock Blast due to its frailty. Both Rock- and Steel-types laugh at anything Garbodor throws at them, save for the rare Drain Punch or Seed Bomb, and can dispose of it with their Ground-type coverage moves. Finally, Rapid Spin users can rid the field of Garbodor's Spikes, defeating its purpose on a team. Additionally, all the viable spinners in the tier are capable of defeating Garbodor one-on-one, as Armaldo, Torkoal, and Wartortle are all bulky enough to take repeated Rock Blasts or Gunk Shots from it and whittle it down.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Spikes": {
        "description": "<p>This is Garbodor's best set, which focuses on Garbodor's utility, bulk, and typing to the fullest. Spikes is Garbodor's best way to support its team, particularly with the switches it commonly forces, making it a staple on this set. Toxic cripples walls, such as Alomomola, that would normally have their way with Garbodor. Pain Split is Garbodor's most reliable form of recovery. Toxic Spikes can be used for further team support, but Pain Split is generally superior as it lets Garbodor stick around for a while. Besides, Toxic usually gets the job done just fine. The last moveslot prevents Garbodor from being Taunt bait; Rock Blast is a great choice for the utility it provides, notably hitting common threats such as Armaldo and Haunter. Gunk Shot, on the other hand, provides a powerful STAB attack that hits decently hard off of Garbodor's good Attack stat. Most notably, it allows Garbodor to dent Fighting-types such as Sawk and Primeape.</p> <p>A physically defensive EV spread makes the most out of Garbodor's resistances to Close Combat and Megahorn, allowing it to set up in the face of common threats, such as Sawk, Primeape, and Gurdurr. 16 Speed EVs let Garbodor outspeed maximum Speed Golem—despite the fact that this set cannot touch Golem, outspeeding it allows Garbodor the chance to set up an extra layer of Spikes against it before falling to Earthquake. Rocky Helmet punishes many physical threats Garbodor likes to switch into, letting it stack up residual damage against them. Most importantly, it ensures Primeape can't just U-turn out against Garbodor unscathed. Rocky Helmet also works well in conjunction with Aftermath, letting Garbodor potentially deal over 40% in residual damage when it goes down. Black Sludge is also a viable alternative, providing passive recovery and focusing more on Garbodor's survivability. Air Balloon is another potential option for a one-time immunity to Ground-type attacks, but Garbodor loses to most Ground-types even with it. Garbodor also has several somewhat useful options in the last two slots, including Seed Bomb, Drain Punch, Clear Smog, and Protect. Seed Bomb lets Garbodor outspeed and dent common Ground-types, such as Seismitoad and Golem. Drain Punch allows Garbodor to dent Rock- and Steel-types, such as Probopass and Bastiodon, and provides a semi-reliable form of recovery. Clear Smog prevents Garbodor from being setup bait, while Protect allows Garbodor to scout the opponent's next move and helps with Toxic stalling. However, Garbodor generally does not have room for any of these moves, and thus the main options are preferred over them.</p> <p>If you are running Toxic Spikes, Ground-types make for good partners, as they help combat the Poison-types that absorb them and can set up Stealth Rock. Garbodor lacks reliable recovery, so a Wish passer is recommended to help make up for that. Alomomola is a good partner for this role, passing enormous Wishes as well as handling Ground-types that threaten Garbodor with relative ease. Lickilicky and Audino are also good partners, as they provide decent defensive synergy and Heal Bell support as well. Sweepers also appreciate Garbodor's presence on a team to take advantage of the Spikes that it provides. Examples include Samurott, Serperior, and Sawsbuck, who all provide decent type synergy and the ability to dispose of Ground-types with their STABs. As a bonus, Swords Dance Samurott can even take out Psychic-types that threaten Garbodor with Megahorn. Finally, Ghost-types make great partners to spinblock and keep Garbodor's Spikes on the field. Misdreavus is arguably the best partner for this role, as it handles Ground-types thanks to Levitate and keeps Psychic-types in check with its Foul Play or STAB Shadow Ball.</p>"

  "Duosion": {
    "overview": "<p>Given that many Psychic-types in the tier are competing with it for a teamslot, Duosion struggles to make a mark. It is mostly outclassed by Musharna due to the latter's better bulk. It is also extremely slow. However, it has an amazing ability in Magic Guard, which means it cannot be Toxic stalled or worn down by entry hazards, unlike Musharna. Alternatively, Regenerator is also a fantastic ability that allows Duosion to stay healthy throughout the match without having to rely on Recover. Unlike most bulky Psychic-types, Duosion is able to beat Mandibuzz thanks to Magic Guard and its access to Thunder.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Duosion can use a defensive Trick Room set to support its teammates, but dedicated Trick Room teams are usually not effective in NU. Duosion can use Trick while holding a status Orb, but it loses a significant amount of bulk without Eviolite. Energy Ball and Hidden Power Fighting are other options at Duosion's disposal, but they don't provide any additional coverage. Magic Coat is an option to reflect Taunt, status, and entry hazards back at the opponent, but with Magic Guard, Duosion is already immune to residual damage from status moves and would rather set up Calm Mind or Trick Room. Acid Armor can make Duosion very hard to take down on the physical side, but it is gimmicky at best. Duosion can use dual screens, but Gardevoir performs this role better thanks to its higher Speed and access to moves such as Taunt and Memento. Thunder Wave can help cripple fast Pokemon on the opponent's team, but is difficult to fit into Duosion's moveset.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Scraggy is the best counter to Duosion, as it can boost alongside it while taking little damage from any of its attacks, and can retaliate with a super effective Crunch. Dark-types in general are decent checks to Duosion; for example, Skuntank is a big roadblock to both sets, as it is immune to Psychic and can use a combination of Taunt, Sucker Punch, and Pursuit to eliminate Duosion. However, it has to watch out for Hidden Power Ground. Mandibuzz is a full stop to any Duosion that lacks Thunder, while it can use Taunt to prevent Duosion from setting up or using Recover. Mandibuzz can also heal itself with Roost. Shiftry and Cacturne wall any set that lacks Signal Beam, can wear down Duosion with their STAB moves, and can OHKO the offensive Trick Room set with priority Sucker Punch. Bastiodon walls all Duosion that lack Hidden Power Ground, and can erase all of Duosion's boosts by phazing it out with Roar. Special walls, such as Lickilicky and Audino, wall the offensive Trick Room set. Lickilicky also has the edge against Calm Mind Duosion thanks to Dragon Tail. However, any attempts to phaze Duosion are futile if it is the last Pokemon remaining. Liepard is immune to Psychic, can mess up Duosion's setup attempts with Encore, and can proceed to use U-turn to gain momentum or simply defeat Duosion with Pursuit, but it takes a lot of damage from Duosion's coverage moves. Taunt users also foil Duosion's setup or recovery attempts; the previously mentioned Mandibuzz and Skuntank have access to it, while Serperior can use Taunt and subsequently set up Calm Minds of its own. As Duosion relies heavily on Eviolite for its bulk, Knock Off and Trick are good ways to cripple Duosion and make it easy to take down, especially since it almost always has to take a hit due to its abysmal Speed. Bug- and Ghost-type Pokemon have trouble switching in, but can demolish Duosion with a super effective STAB attack if they do manage it. For instance, Pinsir can OHKO Duosion with X-Scissor and get a Moxie boost in the process, while Golurk can defeat Duosion with Shadow Punch. SubDisable Haunter and Drifblim find trouble switching in, but completely wall variants of Duosion that run Signal Beam over Thunder by disabling Psychic. Duosion has a large weakness to U-turn that can be troublesome and give the opponent momentum, and this can be taken advantage of by the likes of Choice Band Primeape and Liepard if they switch in safely. In general, offensive teams give Calm Mind Duosion trouble as they rarely give it opportunities to set up, while bulkier teams have an easier time stopping offensive Trick Room Duosion as Pokemon on these teams can soak up unboosted hits much more easily and can wear down Duosion with status.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Duosion is a fantastic late-game setup sweeper. Due to its immunity to residual damage, this set is an amazing weapon against stall teams. Calm Mind allows Duosion to boost its already fantastic Special Attack even further while raising its Special Defense as well, making it hard to revenge kill with special attackers such as Gardevoir. Psychic is Duosion's STAB move that can 2HKO a large portion of the tier when boosted. Thunder is a useful coverage move and also represents Duosion's main niche over Musharna, as it allows Duosion to OHKO Mandibuzz after Stealth Rock damage at +1. It also hits the likes of Metang and Skuntank extremely hard. However, Signal Beam is another option that grants extremely good coverage together with Psychic, and unlike Thunder, has more accuracy and can hit other Psychic-types harder, particularly Exeggutor. Recover allows Duosion to stay healthy after boosting, and is another factor that separates Duosion from Musharna, as Recover has more PP than Moonlight and is not affected by the weather, giving Duosion the edge when in a Calm Mind war.</p> <p>Eviolite is the only viable item as it makes Duosion's bulk usable. Because Duosion is already boosting its Special Attack and Special Defense, the EVs emphasize on Defense to allow Duosion to sponge some weaker physical hits. Hidden Power Ground is an option to defeat Bastiodon and Skuntank, but does not grant much additional coverage. Psyshock is a decent alternative STAB move, which allows Duosion to hit special walls and opposing Calm Mind users hard. However, after a few boosts, Duosion will plow through most special walls anyway. In terms of teammates, Duosion appreciates partners that can defeat the Dark-type opponents that threaten it. Hence, Fighting-type teammates such as Sawk and Gurdurr are appreciated for their ability to switch into these Dark-types and force them out. Skuntank is another great teammate as it can use Pursuit to trap opposing Ghost- and Psychic-types that threaten Duosion, and it is extremely helpful in avoiding a Calm Mind war. Gurdurr, Skuntank, and Duosion also form an effective Dark / Psychic / Fighting core. Duosion appreciates Toxic Spikes support, allowing it to break through opponents much more quickly and wear down checks such as Musharna. Garbodor and Roselia are two decent teammates that can set up Toxic Spikes. Magnet Pull Probopass is also a great teammate for its ability to remove Metang and Bastiodon, two troublesome foes for Duosion.</p>"

      "Offensive Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Duosion is a very effective standalone Trick Room sweeper due to its terrible Speed and high Special Attack. Unlike other offensive Trick Room sweepers, Duosion can restore its HP every time it pivots out thanks to Regenerator, which makes it harder to wear down by residual damage and can thus sustain a sweep for a long period of time. Psychic is Duosion's most powerful STAB move, and with Trick Room making Duosion extremely fast, it becomes a frightening sweeper. Thunder allows Duosion to 2HKO Mandibuzz and in general grants decent neutral coverage with Psychic. Signal Beam allows Duosion to defeat Exeggutor, Cacturne, and Shiftry, as well as to hit opposing Psychic-types hard. On the other hand, Hidden Power Ground allows Duosion to defeat the likes of Skuntank, Bastiodon, and Metang.</p> <p>3 Speed IVs are required to give Duosion a 70 Base Power Hidden Power Ground. However, if Hidden Power Ground is not used, the Speed IVs should be lowered to 0 instead. Regenerator is the chosen ability, as it allows Duosion to stay healthy throughout the match and to lessen its reliance on Recover, hence giving it the space to run more coverage moves. Magic Guard can be used instead, but this set is meant to take down faster teams, which usually do not use status moves. If using Magic Guard, Recover can be used to allow Duosion to heal itself, but if not then Regenerator already does that sufficiently. Duosion also doesn't have enough bulk to spend a turn using Recover without investment in Defense. Life Orb can be used over Eviolite to grant Duosion extra power, but the loss in bulk means that Duosion finds lots of trouble setting up. Gurdurr is an amazing partner, soaking up Dark-type moves while benefiting from Trick Room. Slow but powerful teammates are also good options as backup if Duosion faints while Trick Room is still up. These include Guts Ursaring, Marowak, and Choice Band Lickilicky. However, Trick Room should not be relied on too much as its duration is greatly limited, and it is advisable to only include one of such teammates. Magnet Pull Probopass is another decent teammate thanks to its ability to trap and defeat troublesome Steel-types, such as Metang, Bastiodon, and opposing Probopass. It also provides entry hazard support to aid Duosion, takes Ghost-, Bug-, and Dark-type hits, and can give Duosion a safe switch in with a slow Volt Switch. While not necessary, Duosion appreciates free turns to set up Trick Room. Hence, dual screens or Encore support, from the likes of Gardevoir and Liepard, respectively, is helpful.</p>"

  "Swanna": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Swanna looks mediocre at best, with no base stats over 100. However, believe it or not, she's definitely a threat to watch out for. In rain, Swanna becomes a powerhouse with Hurricane, a move that sets her apart from other rain sweepers. Swanna has amazing offensive stats and a great Speed of 98, which allows her to outspeed many threats in NU, such as Gardevoir and Braviary. She also has access to Roost as well as Rest, which pairs well with her Hydration ability.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Swanna is far from invincible, and she faces many obstacles in NU. Stealth Rock happens to be one of them, as Swanna has a weakness to it. Swanna's movepool is decent but not amazing, leaving her with only one good set. Despite boasting one of the best typings in NU, Swanna's subpar bulk holds her back; 75 / 63 / 63 defenses are far from great. However, Swanna is still an amazing ally to any rain team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swanna doesn't have a very large movepool, so she doesn't have many other viable sets. Damp Rock is an option, but it wastes Swanna's offensive power, which should be taken advantage of whenever she is used due to her sad defenses. Brave Bird is plausible, but it doesn't have much use. Scald could be used in place of Surf for the burn chance, but the power drop is noticeable. Tailwind and Feather Dance could be used for support moves. Choice Scarf Swanna is one of the few viable options left for her and is the only option if she isn't used in rain.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Swanna has her fair share of checks. Choice Scarf Rotom-S is one of them, checking Swanna with Volt Switch. It can't switch in, however, as it is KOed by Surf in rain. The same applies for any Electric-type, specifically Ampharos and Electabuzz, that resist Hurricane and can OHKO Swanna. Bulky Pokemon, such as Musharna and Lickilicky, can take several STAB Hurricanes and proceed to do as they please. Altaria is a counter to any Swanna that doesn't carry Ice Beam, as it can wall her all day without it. Revenge killers can outspeed Swanna and easily KO her; an example would be Choice Scarf Sawk, which can get rid of Swanna with Stone Edge. Articuno, Regice, and Lapras can take any of Swanna's attacks due to their high Special Defense. The latter two have access to Thunderbolt, which OHKOes Swanna.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>This is Swanna's best set for the NU environment. Boasting two STAB moves that benefit greatly from rain and a great Speed stat, Swanna has immense potential as a sweeper. Surf is the primary STAB move, getting a power increase from rain. Hurricane is Swanna's secondary STAB move, and it boasts a high 120 Base Power, perfect accuracy in rain, and a 30% chance of confusing the foe; this is something that even the most defensive Pokemon in NU struggle to handle if they don't resist it.</p> <p>For the final two moveslots, you should use the combination of either Rain Dance and Rest or Substitute and Roost. With the former, Swanna can heal herself to full HP at any time as long as the rain she provides is up thanks to Hydration, making her much more self-sufficient. Alternatively, the latter lets Swanna heal without rain up and ward off status with Substitute. Substitute also lets Swanna take advantage of obvious switches and dodge Sucker Punch. The downside of this combination is that once rain subsides Swanna doesn't have a way to summon it again, preventing her from healing herself if she is inflicted with a status and from boosting the power of her Surf and accuracy of her Hurricane.</p> <p>While Leftovers is great for healing off damage Swanna takes, Swanna greatly appreciates Life Orb's increase in power; any damage she takes can easily be healed off with Rest or Roost anyway, making Life Orb the superior option in most cases. Big Pecks and Keen Eye aren't useful abilities in this metagame, making Hydration the only viable option. Ice Beam can be used for extra coverage, although it's usually not worth the slot in the long run, as it only deals with Altaria, which isn't common enough to justify running a move for it. Hidden Power Grass can be used to handle Seismitoad and Carracosta, Hidden Power Electric is an option to deal with Mantine and other Swanna, and Air Slash can be used in place of Hurricane if Swanna isn't used in rain.</p> <p>As this set is best used in rain conditions, partners such as Volbeat and Electrode are great, as they can provide constant rain. Revenge killers, such as Choice Scarf Sawk, can outspeed Swanna and proceed to KO it. Choice Scarf Rotom-S is thus a good ally to handle Sawk and other revenge killers. Zebstrika and Raichu are also good partners, as they can absorb Electric-type attacks that Swanna attracts. Stealth Rock is a problem for Swanna as well; spinners such as Armaldo and Wartortle are good partners for this reason. Mold Breaker Sawk can also prevent Pokemon with the ability Sturdy from setting up Stealth Rock, something that aids Swanna greatly. Lickilicky and Miltank are bulky Pokemon that are difficult for Swanna to defeat; Fighting-types, such as Gurdurr, are good choices to use against them. Entry hazards are great to have on the field to aid Swanna in sweeping. Garbodor and Cacturne are both great Spikes users that also have good synergy with Swanna. Pokemon who can set up Stealth Rock, such as Cradily and Golurk, are good partners as well.</p>"

  "Sawsbuck": {
    "overview": "<p>Sawsbuck possesses several traits that set it apart from other physical Grass-types, namely its ability Sap Sipper and Normal typing. This blesses it with a handy immunity, potential Attack boosts, and excellent neutral coverage with its STABs alone. With a solid movepool containing gems such as Horn Leech, Double-Edge, Nature Power, Swords Dance, Substitute, and Baton Pass, it has everything it needs to lay wreckage to the opposing team. Its high base Speed further benefits it, letting it outspeed the majority of the metagame and putting it on par with threats such as Primeape and Haunter. Unfortunately, it is rather frail, leaving it prone to being revenge killed—its weaknesses to common attacking types and vulnerability to priority don't do it any favors. Nevertheless, no other physical Grass-type in the tier's offensive capabilities and movepool can compare to Sawsbuck's.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sawsbuck can opt to use its other ability, Chlorophyll, turning it into a deadly cleaner on sun teams. Choice Band can be used to give an even bigger power boost than Life Orb; however, this denies Sawsbuck the ability to switch moves and boost Attack via Swords Dance, making it an inferior option. Jump Kick provides similar coverage to Nature Power, but is inferior due to its inability to provide super effective coverage against Metang and Poison-types and cannot bypass Sucker Punch. Retaliate can be used on the Choice Scarf set, as it is more of a hit-and-run type of Pokemon; however, Double-Edge is usually strong enough and is a far more reliable option should you decide to stay in. A set with Substitute and Leech Seed is interesting, and Sawsbuck separates itself from other SubSeeders with its higher offensive presence, but it doesn't generally accomplish anything the other sets don't. Sawsbuck is also unable to break through the common Grass-types of the tier who are immune to Leech Seed. Aromatherapy provides protection against status, but Sawsbuck is too frail to effectively utilize it and Substitute is generally a better option. Finally, Sawsbuck has access to two forms of status, namely Thunder Wave and Grass Whistle. However, it is too frail to make use of the former, and the latter is far too inaccurate to be worth using.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The Ghost-types of the tier are an ever-present nightmare to Sawsbuck, particularly Drifblim, Misdreavus, and Haunter. Drifblim is the best offensive check to Sawsbuck available, resisting all of its common moves while only fearing the rare Wild Charge, and can OHKO it back with Acrobatics. Misdreavus, particularly Foul Play variants, can also handle Sawsbuck extremely well, breaking its Substitutes with Foul Play and burning it with Will-O-Wisp. Finally, while Haunter does not enjoy taking a boosted Horn Leech to the face, it fears nothing else and can OHKO with Sludge Bomb. Weezing's combination of typing, bulk, and ability make it an adept counter to Sawsbuck, tanking any attack and KOing with STAB Sludge Bomb. Gurdurr is another Pokemon that counters Sawsbuck fairly well, being able tank any attack with its Eviolite-boosted defenses and threaten back with Drain Punch and Mach Punch. Defensive Sap Sipper Miltank is immune to Horn Leech, can shrug off one or two Double-Edges or Returns, and can paralyze Sawsbuck with Body Slam. Braviary and Charizard are two excellent offensive checks; while they dislike eating a Double-Edge or Return to the face, particularly with their pronounced Stealth Rock weakness, they can easily switch in on Horn Leech and proceed to OHKO. Finally, priority is very effective at taking down a weakened Sawsbuck, particularly Gurdurr's Mach Punch and Kangaskhan's Fake Out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>This is by far Sawsbuck's most common and threatening set. The goal is simple: set up a Swords Dance and dish out as much damage as possible. Double-Edge is chosen as the primary Normal STAB because of its sheer damage output, OHKOing Ludicolo and Sawk after Stealth Rock and generally helping to check things even without a Swords Dance boost. However, if the recoil turns you off, Return is a suitable replacement but the power difference is noticeable. Horn Leech is Sawsbuck's best Grass-type STAB, hitting Rock-types and Golurk hard and providing a semi-reliable form of recovery that helps patch up Life Orb and Double-Edge recoil. Finally, Nature Power (as it turns into Earthquake) provides the best coverage with Sawsbuck's STABs, hitting Steel-types like Metang for super effective damage as well as letting it bypass Sucker Punch from the likes of Kangaskhan and Skuntank. Substitute, on the other hand, works in tandem with Swords Dance, allowing Sawsbuck to set up in the face of Alomomola, Tangela lacking Hidden Power Ice, defensive Seismitoad, and Misdreavus without Foul Play. It's worth noting that if you do decide to use Substitute, Return is the Normal STAB of choice. However, both Double-Edge and Return are suitable alongside Nature Power.</p> <p>Life Orb is generally the go-to item, giving Sawsbuck a noticeable power boost and helping it to gain several important KOs against certain Pokemon. Lum Berry is an alternative that gives it a temporary shield against status, which is particularly useful when not running Substitute. This allows Sawsbuck to comfortably absorb Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, and, of course, Swagger, without forcing it to give up its coverage move. Generally speaking though, the power boost provided by Life Orb is more important. Baton Pass is another useful move that can be used in the fourth slot; it allows Sawsbuck to escape its counters and potentially pass Attack boosts at the same time. Sawsbuck does miss the coverage and utility provided by its other options here, but Baton Pass is perfectly viable and can certainly be considered.</p> <p>Specially oriented Water-types, such as Samurott and Gorebyss, make good partners for Sawsbuck; not only can they break down physical walls like Weezing but they can also lure in Grass-type moves for Sawsbuck to absorb. This set often runs into issues with the Fighting-types of the tier; Gurdurr in particular is extremely threatening as it can tank any attack and threaten back with Drain Punch or Mach Punch. Psychic-types, such as Musharna, can take it on with ease as well as threaten physical walls with STAB Psychic. Entry hazards work well with Sawsbuck, with Stealth Rock allowing it to score an OHKO on Charizard with Double-Edge or Return. Rock-types and Ground-types can set up Stealth Rock, and they also lure in Water- and Grass-type Pokemon for Sawsbuck to take advantage of. Finally, Garbodor is a good candidate for setting up Spikes, being able to handily deal with Fighting-types through Rocky Helmet and Aftermath recoil.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>While Sawsbuck might be a bit lacking when compared with other possible Choice Scarf users, especially the faster and more versatile Tauros, it is still a viable choice. It sets itself apart from Tauros with its secondary Grass typing and Sap Sipper and still hits just as hard. That said, Tauros is still usually the superior option and should always be considered before using Sawsbuck as a Choice Scarf user. Double-Edge is the best Normal-type STAB for this set, as Sawsbuck needs all the power it can get due to lacking the boost from Life Orb. STAB Horn Leech is one of Sawsbuck's main advantages over Tauros and helps deal damage against Golurk, Rock-types, and bulky Water-types. Nature Power helps revenge kill Steel-types, such as Metang, Probopass, and Bastiodon, who would otherwise wall Sawsbuck completely. Finally, the last slot is reserved for Baton Pass and allows Sawsbuck to escape walls that it can't break through, as well as potentially passing Sap Sipper boosts.</p> <p>One can forgo Baton Pass in exchange for an attacking move such as Megahorn or Wild Charge. However, this does not generally add much to Sawsbuck's coverage, and its STAB moves are strong enough in most cases. Wild Charge is notable, however, for hitting Drifblim, a Pokemon who would completely wall this set without it. That said, there are far better ways to deal with this threat, and Wild Charge recoil combined with Drifblim's enormous HP stat does not end well for Sawsbuck. Likewise, Toxic can come as a surprise to most walls, but simply using Baton Pass to pivot into a better matchup is a much safer and more reliable option.</p> <p>As this set has no way to break down physical walls, namely Weezing, Tangela, and Vileplume, partners that can defeat these Pokemon are near mandatory. Powerful special attackers such as Charizard and Samurott are some of the best examples of this, handily breaking down physical walls and generally making up for Sawsbuck's lack of overall power. As a bonus, Samurott can even lure in Grass-type moves for Sawsbuck to take advantage of. Skuntank makes for a prime partner as well, handily dealing with the Ghost-types that Sawsbuck commonly lures in. Sawsbuck is extremely weak to priority, particularly Mach Punch, so any partner that can sponge it comes in handy. Garbodor and Musharna are some of the best examples of this, the former having access to Spikes and the latter easily dealing with bulky Poison-types.</p>"

  "Emolga": {
    "overview": "<p>Cute Electric rodents have always been useless in the competitive scene, and Emolga continues that tradition; it is both weak offensively and extremely frail defensively. Its only saving grace is its good Speed, which allows it to pull off a barely decent support set that makes use of Tailwind. Emolga is a bad Pokemon, and you should always consider other options, such as Rotom-S, before using it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic can be used to wear down certain bulky threats such as Regirock and Regice. Discharge can be used to allow Emolga to spread paralysis, but Air Slash hits more targets than Discharge and also carries a nice flinch chance. A Charge Beam set can be used to attempt a sweep, but Emolga is too frail to afford the turns it needs to set up. A paraflinch set could be used, but it is luck-based and done better by Rotom-S, which has better bulk and access to Confuse Ray. A full Baton Pass set is usable, but Emolga does not have many useful boosts to pass, and the likes of Ninjask and Volbeat can pass the same boosts more effectively. Electro Ball can be used with Thunder Wave, but this is a very unreliable strategy and is done better by Electrode if, for some reason, you want to use it. A Life Orb set is also plausible, but any kind of offensive set is outclassed by Emolga's fellow Electric-types, such as Rotom-S and Electabuzz.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Preventing Emolga from getting up Tailwind is difficult, as its high Speed makes it hard to Taunt. However, killing Emolga itself is extremely easy. By constantly hammering its teammates with attacks, one can prevent Emolga from switching in because it is KOed by most powerful moves. Most bulky Pokemon, such as Regirock and Regice, can tank hits from Emolga and KO in return. Most Pokemon that are faster than Emolga can easily destroy it; for example, Tauros and Choice Scarf users can do so easily. However, remember that they are all outsped under Tailwind.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tailwind Support": {
        "description": "<p>This is the only set Emolga can perform well, although it still isn't very good. Tailwind only requires one turn to set up, meaning that it is the best support option Emolga has. Tailwind gives slow but powerful teammates the chance to sweep due to their boosted Speed. Emolga's frailty allows it to die and bring in a teammate safely after setting up Tailwind. Encore gives Emolga setup opportunities against Electric-type, Ground-type, and status moves that can't touch it. U-turn lets Emolga get out after setting up Tailwind and is used over Volt Switch because nothing is immune to it. Air Slash is used mainly to avoid being Taunt bait, as well as allowing Emolga to deal some last minute damage before dying. Taunt can also be used over Air Slash to beat opposing Taunt users that are slower than Emolga.</p> <p>If Taunt is used, the EV spread should be changed to 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature. Roost can be used, but Emolga is usually meant to set up Tailwind and die, and Roost does not help with this. Baton Pass can be used over U-turn to avoid Pursuit and pass Speed boosts from Motor Drive to Emolga's teammates, but there is a risk of passing harmful things like Leech Seed, Perish Song, and Attack drops from Intimidate, as well as making Emolga more vulnerable to Taunt. A Focus Sash can be used, but Emolga is meant to faint in order to bring in a teammate safely. Good teammates for this set are ones that can take advantage of the Tailwind support that Emolga provides, so slow, hard-hitting Pokemon are great. Examples include Ursaring, Sawk, and Torterra. However, the best choice should also be able to take a hit due to a possibly having to switch in on Emolga's fast U-turn. For example, Samurott and Golurk can come in on Ice- and Rock-type moves respectively.</p>"

  "Frillish": {
    "overview": "<p>Frillish has a lot of cons that prevent it from being effective on many teams. It has a niche on stall teams as a bulky spinblocker with reliable recovery that can check Pokemon such as Samurott and Charizard, but fails to be worth its weight more often than not. Frillish is extremely weak and slow—its only viable offensive moves are Scald and Night Shade—causing it to be setup fodder most of the time. Frillish faces a lot of competition for the role of a bulky Water-type, but as it is effective at dealing with the most common spinners—Wartortle, Torkoal, and Armaldo—it does merit some use on stall teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cursed Body can be used, but it relies on luck and is thus unfavorable. Shadow Ball and Ice Beam are other offensive options that Frillish has, but considering its low Special Attack, the moves won't hit very hard. Magic Coat is actually a really good option and can replace Taunt in the set, but is very prediction-reliant and only for advanced players. Frillish can also play a role in Trick Room support, but this is best left to other users such as Musharna, Duosion, and Audino. Frillish also has access to Acid Armor and Refresh, but these are gimmicky options at best.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Pokemon that do not fear Will-O-Wisp can take Frillish head-on. These include Toxic Boost Zangoose and Guts users such as Swellow, which take advantage of Frillish's weaker Defense stat and hit hard. Powerful Electric- and Grass-types that are common in the tier can switch in easily and KO it; Eelektross, Roselia, Rotom-A, and Ludicolo are prime examples. Finally, a faster Taunt user such as Mandibuzz, Misdreavus, or Skuntank can halt Frillish in its tracks and force it out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>A physically defensive set is used as Frillish's typing is much more suitable for physical walling; with the investment, Frillish can take hits from threats such as Tauros, Pinsir, Swords Dance Samurott, and Primeape, and also avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Sawk without Stealth Rock. With good prediction, Frillish even has a good chance to beat Skuntank.</p> <p>With its nice Special Defense, useful resistances, and Eviolite, Frillish can be quite specially bulky even without defensive investment. Frillish has more reliable recovery when compared to Misdreavus's Pain Split, as Recover consistently heals half of Frillish's health. Night Shade is used as the offensive move, as it deals a stable 100 damage on each use and does not rely on Frillish's horrible offensive stats. Frillish has another advantage in its typing, which permits it to defeat the common Rapid Spinners in the tier: Wartortle, Armaldo, and Torkoal. Will-O-Wisp is a great move to cripple opponents and cushion Frillish from powerful physical attacks. It is best used when predicting an opponent to switch into a physical attacker. Taunt is great to block Heal Bell users or boosting sweepers, but is more difficult to use due to Frillish's low Speed; fortunately it can still be used to reliably stop Musharna and Audino as they are slower. Scald can be used instead of Will-O-Wisp despite Frillish's low offensive stats, as strategic usage of the move can deal decent damage to super effective targets, especially on the likes of Golem, Armaldo, and Torkoal. Water Absorb is the preferred ability because Frillish appreciates the extra immunity.</p> <p>100 Speed EVs are invested to allow Frillish to outspeed and Taunt Modest Torkoal before it can use Shell Smash as well as Taunt Audino and Lickilicky before they can use Heal Bell. You can use a specially defensive set if you wish, as it is completely viable in the metagame; just shift the Defense EVs into Special Defense. 148 Speed EVs can be used to allow Frillish to outspeed minimum Speed Wartortle. This can be useful to Taunt it and prevent it from using moves such as Toxic and Foresight, allowing Frillish to reliably stop all of the Rapid Spinners in the tier. Toxic can replace Will-O-Wisp if Scald is used, although the latter is usually too good to pass up. Despite Frillish's ability to counter all the Rapid Spin users in the tier, Frillish should only be used on stall teams, as it has no offensive presence at all. One should consider Misdreavus or Alomomola as their roles overlap with Frillish; they should not be used on the same team.</p> <p>Good teammates for Frillish are those that set up entry hazards. Roselia and Garbodor can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes while absorbing the Toxic Spikes that might linger on your field. Meanwhile, Probopass, Bastiodon, Golem, and Torkoal can set up Stealth Rock. Finally, great teammates include bulky Pokemon that can phaze the opponent to rack up entry hazard damage, such as Roar Bastiodon, Dragon Tail Lickilicky, Circle Throw Throh, and Whirlwind Mandibuzz.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With an enormous base 165 HP, Alomomola stands out as one of the best Wish passers in the game. It's a very successful physically defensive pivot as well, tanking some of the strongest physical attackers in the metagame. Although it is unable to inflict much damage onto Pokemon with its STAB moves, Alomomola can also weaken the opponent by stalling out Toxic damage while maintaining its longevity.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Despite having one viable set, Alomomola has plenty of interesting options for you to utilize. A set consisting of Hydration, Rest, and Rain Dance is intriguing, as it gives Alomomola reliable recovery and longevity. However, it would have trouble fitting all this into a moveset that would be effective, and replacing one of Alomomola's vital moves with Rain Dance generally isn't worth it. Knock Off can further cripple the opponent, but it is challenging to fit this into Alomomola's moveset. Refresh is a great way to heal off status conditions, but it is rather difficult to find a spot for it on the set without hindering Alomomola's abilities. Healing Wish is a situational option, but as Wish almost fully heals the majority of the tier, it isn't worth sacrificing Alomomola for essentially the same effect. Light Screen is an option to better support the team, but other Pokemon outclass Alomomola in using it, and it forces Alomomola to give up a precious moveslot.</p> <p>With access to Calm Mind, Ice Beam, Shadow Ball, and Hydro Pump, Alomomola seems like a good candidate for a special attacker at first glance. However, with a weak Special Attack stat, it is hardly worth using in this role. Substitute with Rest and Sleep Talk appears to be viable, but Alomomola doesn't have anything to set up with behind Substitute, and it is already bulky enough, so RestTalk is useless in this case. It also doesn't have the available moveslots to fully utilize Substitute's effect. Mirror Coat and Soak are plausible options; the former allows Alomomola to use its pitiful Special Defense to its advantage, while the latter is a gimmicky option that allows it to use Toxic on Poison- and Steel-types. Finally, Aqua Jet could be used for priority, but it wouldn't do much damage from Alomomola's mediocre Attack. All in all, Alomomola would almost always rather stick to its standard set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Taunt is a great way to silence Alomomola; Serperior, Skuntank, Mandibuzz, and Samurott can all handle it this way. Status moves, particularly Toxic, cripple Alomomola, so wearing it down with them is a good strategy. Because Alomomola isn't strong enough to break through bulky Substitutes or those from Pokemon that resist Water-type attacks, Pokemon such as Braviary and Sawsbuck can easily set up on it. Also, because of Alomomola's pathetic offensive presence, the majority of the tier can set up on it without needing Substitute, though they must be careful of Toxic. Arbok and Muk in particular fare well against Alomomola because of their immunity to Toxic and not taking severe damage from Waterfall. Strong Grass- and Electric-types, such as Rotom-S, Rotom-F, Eelektross, Vileplume, Tangela, and Exeggutor, can threaten Alomomola quite easily. Roselia deserves its own special mention, as it can take any move Alomomola normally carries, threaten it with a STAB Giga Drain, and set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes so that Alomomola has more difficulty switching in. Gothorita can trap and take out Alomomola, preventing it from switching and supporting its teammates. Targeting Alomomola's weaker Special Defense is a great tactic; Gorebyss with Substitute and Shell Smash is a great choice for this, as it can avoid Toxic with Substitute and set up freely.</p>",

Wish is key for the set, as the degree to which Alomomola can heal itself and its teammates is one of its main strengths. Protect is an important move for this set as well, as it works well in conjunction with Wish, allowing Alomomola to almost always heal itself. It also racks up Leftovers recovery and scouts the opponent's attacks. While Alomomola lacks offensive presence, Waterfall prevents Alomomola from being complete Taunt bait and acts as a good STAB move. It is also strong enough to break through frail Pokemon's Substitutes. Toxic is the final move of the set, working well with Protect to stall opponents, slowly whittling away at their HP. It is also Alomomola's main way of inflicting damage onto the opponent.</p> <p>152 EVs in Special Defense allow Alomomola to survive two hits from Charizard's Hidden Power Grass after Leftovers and wear it down with Life Orb and Toxic damage. 252 EVs are placed in Defense, as when paired with an Impish nature, this enables Alomomola to tank physical attacks much more easily. For example, even a Choice Band Sawk can only 2HKO Alomomola with Close Combat, and a Guts-boosted Swellow can only 3HKO with Facade. This allows Alomomola to serve as a scout against some of the strongest physical attackers in the tier and pivot into a more appropriate check or stall out the opponent. The remaining 104 EVs are used in HP to increase Alomomola's overall bulk and the amount of HP it heals with Wish. It also allows Alomomola to reach a Leftovers number. Regenerator is the ability of choice, as it grants Alomomola the ability to switch in without fear of entry hazards. It's also what makes Alomomola a phenomenal Wish passer, as it is able to use Wish, tank a hit, and switch out while still remaining at nearly full HP. Scald can be used in place of Waterfall for a potential burn chance, but it is even weaker than Waterfall and leaves Alomomola helpless against anything with Substitute due to Alomomola's pitiful Special Attack.</p> <p>Alomomola can be rendered useless if it is inflicted with status; Lickilicky, Audino, and Flareon are great partners for this reason, as they can use Heal Bell to heal Alomomola when necessary. Flareon in particular can take on Grass-types—most notably Tangela, Vileplume, and Roselia—that Alomomola can't get near. They can also take special attacks quite well for Alomomola. Misdreavus and Miltank can also be considered as well; they offer utilities that Alomomola can find useful, such as inflicting the opponent with burn or paralysis, respectively. Toxic Spikes support aids Alomomola in slowly weakening the opponent. Garbodor is a good choice in that department as it can handle Grass-types as well if needed. This also lessens the need for Toxic, which allows Alomomola to use other support moves. Pokemon that benefit from Wish support are great partners to use alongside Alomomola; Regice and Eelektross are examples of such. Electric-types can easily KO Alomomola, most notably Rotom-S and Rotom-F. Eelektross, Piloswine, and Seismitoad are all great answers to these Pokemon. They also appreciate the Wish support Alomomola provides. Finally, Taunt users prevent Alomomola from supporting its team, so having partners to deal with them is recommended.</p>"

  "Klang": {
    "overview": "<p>Klang is often underused and ignored in the NU tier due to its small movepool and lack of coverage. However, it makes its mark with its signature moves: Shift Gear and Gear Grind. Those two moves represent the purpose of using Klang: to set up and perform a sweep. Klang is meant to function as a late-game sweeper, finishing off any opponent that hasn't been defeated by Klang's fellow teammates. Klang is one of the few Steel-types in the tier, and because of the offensive presence it can create with its signature moves, it stands out from the competition.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Because of Klang's pitiful movepool, its options are limited. A special attacking set with Charge Beam is possible, but many Pokemon in NU can easily wall Klang, and without Shift Gear, Klang loses its offensive presence. Volt Switch can be useful in certain conditions, but as Klang will be setting up the majority of the time, it isn't recommended. A set consisting of Toxic and Thunder Wave is plausible, but Klang has no supporting moves outside of these, and thus makes for a very poor support Pokemon. Finally, Life Orb can increase Klang's offensive prowess, but Eviolite is unarguably the best item for Klang because it allows Klang to better maintain its Substitutes.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Even with Eviolite and useful resistances, Klang can still be easily taken down. Fighting-types such as Choice Scarf Primeape and Gurdurr are excellent answers to Klang, overwhelming it with their powerful attacks; the former can only prey on a weakened Klang, as it cannot outright OHKO it, and the latter can easily switch into any of Klang's attacks. Unless Klang carries Magnet Rise, Ground-types, especially Golurk, can take almost all of Klang's attacks and KO it with their STAB Ground-type moves. Shift Gear Klang has no reliable recovery, so wearing it down with powerful, consistent attacks is a great way to defeat it. Status is a particularly good way to shut down Shift Gear Klang; Misdreavus can burn it with Will-O-Wisp, and Miltank and Musharna can hit it with Thunder Wave. However, these should be used only if Magnet Rise has been revealed, as Klang carrying Substitute can avoid status.</p> <p>While there are not many Pokemon that can outright KO Klang, many Pokemon can sponge an attack or two from it, then proceed to set up on it. Alomomola, Eelektross, Ludicolo, Torterra, and many other bulky Pokemon can either set up on Klang or outright attack it for decent damage. Frillish and Lampent can wall Klang's STAB move and are immune to Return, so they can serve as good walls against it. The former must be wary of Wild Charge, however. Knock Off makes Klang significantly more easier to deal with, as it lowers Klang's defenses.</p> <p>Finally, there are many checks to Klang that can defeat it, but only if Klang hasn't set up with Shift Gear. Taunt is a great way to prevent Klang from overpowering your team; Liepard, Misdreavus, and Murkrow are great examples of Taunt users, but bear in mind that all of them take a lot of damage from Gear Grind. Fast Fire-types, such as Rapidash and Charizard, can check Klang with their super effective STAB moves, but Klang can seriously dent them if it has set up. Choice Scarf users, such as Sawk and Gardevoir, are great checks to Klang if it hasn't set up. Overall, Klang is not that hard to wall and KO because it doesn't hit that hard and has average coverage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mono-Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set focuses on Klang's exceptional defenses, handy resistances, and access to RestTalk to set up and sweep. However, RestTalk is often unreliable and comes with a loss of momentum. While its primary role is that of a physically defensive wall, it can set up on a variety of Pokemon, such as Musharna, Skuntank, and Serperior. Klang trades coverage for additional bulk: it can set up much more easily than its standard set, tank more attacks, and power its way through most of the NU tier. Its lack of recovery and vulnerability to status conditions are no longer an issue due to Rest, which heals Klang to full HP in a pinch. Sleep Talk is a very useful move in this set, allowing Klang to set up or attack while it's asleep. Shift Gear is Klang's setup move, which can now be used more efficiently due to Klang's enhanced defenses. Finally, Gear Grind is Klang's STAB move, hitting many Pokemon fairly hard after a Shift Gear boost.</p> <p>92 Speed EVs allow Klang to outspeed positive-natured base 95 Speed Pokemon after a Shift Gear boost. 136 Defense EVs with an Impish nature brings Klang to an impressive 286 Defense before the Eviolite boost, allowing Klang to wall many Pokemon, including Kangaskhan and Tauros, both of which cannot even 2HKO Klang with super effective attacks. The remaining EVs increase Klang's overall bulk. Eviolite is an absolute must to this set if Klang wants to attain the defenses that allow it to wall many Pokemon in NU. Clear Body is Klang's only viable ability for this set. None of Klang's moves can be replaced in this set; each move has a distinct purpose that can't be altered.</p> <p>Toxic Spikes users are excellent partners to Klang; bulky Water-types, such as Alomomola, are much easier to handle. Garbodor is a prime partner for Klang, dealing with Fighting-types Klang has difficulty setting up against. Because of the lack of coverage on this set, many Pokemon, specifically Fire-types, can tank all of Klang's attacks and strike back. Carracosta and Samurott can handle almost all of the Fire-types, such as Charizard, with their STAB moves. Carracosta with Hidden Power Grass can as a bonus also lure Seismitoad and Alomomola, two Pokemon that Klang has trouble against, and OHKO them after entry hazard damage and, for the former, one use of Shell Smash and one turn of Life Orb recoil. Taunt can nearly shut Klang down; Liepard, Murkrow, and physically defensive Misdreavus can all Taunt Klang and avoid a 2HKO from it, provided that it hasn't set up with Shift Gear. Sawk, Rotom-F, and specially offensive Charizard can handle each of them, respectively. Sawk can also deal with most of the opposing Steel- and Ground-types in the tier.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Shift Gear": {
        "description": "<p>This is a more offensive version of Klang; it displays excellent usage of its decent Attack, Eviolite, Shift Gear, and resistances to common Grass-, Ice-, and Rock-type attacks in the tier. Through the combination of Eviolite and its Steel typing, which is rare in NU, Klang gets multiple chances to set up Shift Gear against a variety of attackers, especially Choice-locked Primeape, Kangaskhan, and Tauros. Because Klang doesn't have the raw Speed or power to attempt sweeps early- or mid-game, this set works best by defeating weakened foes late-game.</p> <p>Shift Gear is the main aspect of this set, as it can raise Klang's Attack and Speed to viable—and sometimes dangerous—levels. Gear Grind is its STAB move, sporting a Base Power of 100 after two hits, which is very useful in breaking opposing Substitutes from Pokemon such as Serperior, as well as OHKOing Pokemon such as Roselia and 2HKOing Pokemon such as Golurk after a boost. Return offers nearly perfect coverage when paired with Gear Grind, hitting Pokemon such as Rotom-S and Ludicolo much harder than Gear Grind could. However, Wild Charge allows Klang to severely dent Water-types, such as Samurott and Carracosta. The recoil damage and lack of recovery might make this move a lackluster choice though, especially if Substitute is used. Substitute is the recommended final option, allowing Klang to set up without fear of being inflicted by status from the likes of Misdreavus. However, Magnet Rise allows Klang to set up on Ground-type Pokemon that it normally struggles against, such as Golurk, Golem, and Piloswine.</p> <p>168 Speed EVs allow Klang to outspeed Pokemon at or below base 110 Speed after a Shift Gear boost. 252 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature maximizes the power of Klang's attacks, and 88 HP EVs are invested so Klang can tank more attacks. If more bulk is preferred, an EV spread of 140 HP / 252 Atk / 116 Spe can be utilized, and Klang still outspeeds Pokemon at base 100 Speed or below, such as Haunter and Charizard. Eviolite is the staple of this set, allowing Klang to set up without being easily KOed. Leftovers can be used for consistent recovery, but Klang's defenses suffer a significant drop, so it's not advised. There aren't any other viable move selections that Klang can utilize.</p> <p>As Klang is a late-game sweeper, sweepers to get rid of Pokemon that wall Klang, such as Alomomola and Eelektross, are useful. Exeggutor is an prime example, as Exeggutor can take Fighting- and Ground-type attacks aimed at Klang while defeating Alomomola. Eelektross can also wall Klang quite well, so Mold Breaker Sawk is a great counter, as it can OHKO Eelektross. Entry hazard support a great way to weaken the adversary for Klang before it performs a sweep. Garbodor is a great partner, as it can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes, crippling walls such as Alomomola and Tangela. Regirock can also set up Stealth Rock while taking Fire-type attacks that Klang despises. Wish support is also appreciated, as Klang doesn't have any reliable form of recovery. Alomomola and Lickilicky are great options in that department, as both of them can heal Klang significantly with Wish. Gothorita in particular can also aid Klang by trapping and defeating Alomomola and Gurdurr.</p>"

  "Eelektross": {
    "overview": "<p>Eelektross is undoubtedly one of the scariest Pokemon for a defensive team to face, and it's not surprising why this is so; with excellent attacking stats, an expansive offensive movepool with great coverage options, and a slow Volt Switch and U-turn, it can be both unpredictable and incredibly difficult to wall. On top of that, Eelektross's bulk allows it to take a few hits, and it has no weaknesses that opposing teams can prey upon. Unfortunately, more offensive teams can typically make it hard for Eelektross to do its job, as in spite of its lack of weaknesses, it has very few resistances, and because of its poor Speed, it's not very difficult to outpace it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Despite its expansive movepool, most of Eelektross's best options have already been covered. Coil is probably the most viable other option, and using it with an EV spread of 248 HP / 100 Atk / 36 Def / 124 Spe with an Adamant nature allows Eelektross to outspeed Alomomola and retain some good offensive capabilities without a boost. The problem with a Coil set is that its few resistances make it difficult to find opportunities to set up. Eelektross is usually much better off using its great mixed attacking stats to hit hard right off the bat. For the same reason, Charge Beam is generally an inferior choice. If you are considering a Coil set, Zap Cannon might seem like a good option, but Eelektross prefers to use the Attack boosts to its advantage over the accuracy boosts. Acrobatics is an interesting option to help Eelektross beat Grass-type Pokemon, but the lack of an item needed to use it to full effect is unappealing. Rock Slide is another option, but its coverage is a bit redundant with Eelektross's STAB, and its flinch chance will rarely come in handy because of Eelektross's low Speed. Knock Off can be used on any of Eelektross's sets to cause problems for the Pokemon that switch in to wall it. Finally, Thunder Wave and Toxic can be good options to hinder the Pokemon it cannot beat on its own.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Eelektross is a Pokemon that is incredibly difficult to counter, as it is so strong and unpredictable. The easiest way to defeat Eelektross is to try and keep up offensive pressure against the opponent's team and never give it a free switch. If this is not possible, you might be forced to revenge kill it with strong attackers, such as Sawk and Charizard. With Mold Breaker, Sawk, Rampardos, and Pinsir can also use Earthquake to hit Eelektross for super effective damage. Probably the only true counters to any Eelektross set are Dragonair and Shelgon, as it rarely carries a move to hit them for super effective damage and the coverage moves it has to hit them with generally won't hit hard enough to take them out. Meanwhile, both of these Pokemon can set up Dragon Dances against it and later Rest to recover the damage they've taken.</p> <p>Outside of trying to counter every set with one Pokemon, each individual set has its own checks and counters. Camerupt, Ampharos, and Zweilous all wall the special set very well. Lickilicky and Audino also do well against the special set, as they can come in on any move and either stay in to wall non-Choice Specs variants or pivot out into a better check against Choice Specs variants. Additionally, Fraxure can set up against the special set, though it doesn't appreciate taking a Choice Specs Thunderbolt. As for the physical set, Torterra, Tangela, Vileplume, and Seismitoad can all take it on relatively well. Still, all of them but Tangela don't appreciate taking repeated U-turns. Finally, the mixed set is incredibly difficult to wall, as very few Pokemon can survive two consecutive hits. One of the only viable Pokemon that can do this is Altaria, which can survive a Thunderbolt after Stealth Rock and Roost to recover the damage it took. Misdreavus can also survive one Thunderbolt, but it can't do much back to Eelektross.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Eebeltross": {
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Eelektross's great mixed attacking stats and fantastic coverage in order to break through nearly every wall and tank in NU. With this set, Eelektross can also serve as an effective lure; if you need to take out a special wall to open up a sweep later on, you can use special attacks to bait the opponent into bringing it in, then to take it out with Superpower. Thunderbolt is used on this set as Eelektross's most powerful and reliable STAB and helps it take on bulky Water-types, such as Alomomola and Mantine. Superpower helps make Eelektross very difficult to wall; most Pokemon that can take a hit from the special side don't want to take a strong physical attack, and many of the tier's special walls are weak to Fighting-type attacks. Flamethrower is used for additional coverage to help beat Grass-types, such as Tangela and Vileplume, which would wall this set otherwise. Finally, Giga Drain is used as a way of beating the Ground-types that can switch into a Thunderbolt, and it provides a form of recovery for Eelektross.</p> <p>The EV spread for this set allows Eelektross to outspeed minimum Speed Alomomola and KO it before it can use Toxic and to 2HKO common special walls such as Regice, Lickilicky, Audino, and Zweilous. A bulkier spread of 112 HP / 140 Atk / 248 SpA / 8 Spe can be used to help take hits better if you are less concerned about outpacing some of the walls that the set aims to beat. Expert Belt is the ideal item choice, as it can help Eelektross bluff a Choice Specs set better while also maintaining its vitality throughout the battle. A Life Orb can be used to 2HKO Altaria without Stealth Rock, but it has little use otherwise.</p> <p>Finding partners for this set isn't very difficult; basically anything that appreciates the opponent's walls and tanks eliminated enjoys working with Eelektross. Examples of such Pokemon include Ludicolo, Carracosta, and Zangoose. Eelektross does appreciate some assistance from its team members as well. Spikes support can help it attain the 2HKO against opposing Piloswine and Roselia, as well as the OHKO against specially defensive Seismitoad. Roselia and Garbodor are both effective users of the move, and Eelektross can take Flying-type attacks aimed at the first two as well as Ground-type attacks aimed at the third. Stealth Rock support is also helpful, as it can bring certain Pokemon, such as Articuno, Lapras, and Regice, down to a range where Eelektross can OHKO them. Both Golem and Seismitoad can set up Stealth Rock while maintaining offensive momentum. Finally, while uncommon, this set still struggles against Dragon-types, such as Altaria, Shelgon, and Dragonair.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This set uses Eelektross's fantastic special movepool and great Special Attack stat to become a hard-hitting attacker. Volt Switch allows it to serve as a slow scout in order to keep up offensive momentum and bring fast, frail teammates to the field safely. Because of STAB and Eelektross's above average Special Attack, Volt Switch will also hit many Pokemon for solid damage. Giga Drain offers Eelektross a way of defeating Ground-types that keep it from using Volt Switch, and it provides a form of recovery. Grass-types also keep Eelektross from spamming its STAB moves; Flamethrower is a way of handling them and alleviating this issue. Finally, Thunderbolt gives Eelektross a more powerful and reliable STAB to spam when scouting is unnecessary, such as when it finds itself facing bulky special walls.</p> <p>The EV spread used invests fully in Special Attack with enough Speed EVs to outspeed Tangela in order to avoid a Sleep Powder. The rest of the EVs are used in HP in order to further augment Eelektross's good bulk. Leftovers is the primary item of choice, giving Eelektross some nice passive recovery and helping it to pivot in and out throughout the match, but Choice Specs can be used for additional power to beat out many of the bulkier Pokemon in NU. Expert Belt is a perfectly viable option as well, giving Eelektross a bit more power and allowing it to switch up moves. Hidden Power Ice can be used over Giga Drain if you would like a better way of handling Dragon-type Pokemon without giving up the ability to beat Ground-types, but be aware that you'll lose out on super effective coverage against Thick Fat Piloswine and Seismitoad as well as the recovery that Giga Drain provides. Finally, Acid Spray can be used over either Thunderbolt or Volt Switch as a way of taking down some of the bulkier special walls in the tier.</p> <p>There are many different Pokemon that partner well with this set. Swellow, Zangoose, and Ursaring all appreciate Eelektross's slow Volt Switch, which helps bring them in safely to activate their status Orbs. Other users of Volt Switch and U-turn also pair well with this set, as they can overwhelm the opponent with offensive momentum and give them as few free turns as possible. Primeape, Swellow, Probopass, and most Electric-type Pokemon can all work alongside Eelektross for this reason. Any user of Volt Switch or U-turn appreciates entry hazard support as well due to its ability to force switches; Eelektross is no exception to this. Garbodor is a great Spikes user, and Golem, Golurk, and Seismitoad are all great offensive Stealth Rock users. Because Eelektross struggles against some of the special walls in the tier, Fighting-types work well alongside it. Gurdurr and Sawk are good examples of this, as they can both beat Lickilicky, Audino, Bastiodon, and Probopass fairly easily.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>With a physical set, Eelektross can use its great physical movepool and attacking prowess to muscle through many of the tier's bulkiest Pokemon. U-turn is the first move on this set, and it gives Eelektross a fantastic way to gain momentum for the team. Unlike Volt Switch, only one Pokemon--Shedinja--is immune to U-turn. On top of that, Grass-types are the most common types of Pokemon to switch into Eelektross, and U-turn can deal some solid damage to many of them. Thunder Punch is used as a reliable choice for STAB with a handy chance of paralyzing opponents. Superpower is used for its great power, but if the stat drops are unappealing, Drain Punch is a viable alternative that gives Eelektross a form of recovery. Finally, Aqua Tail hits Ground-type Pokemon that keep Eelektross from using its STAB hard.</p> <p>The EVs on this set are used to outspeed Alomomola, with the rest thrown into Attack and HP for added power and bulk. Choice Band is the first item choice on this set, as it cannot rely on super effective coverage as well as other sets can, but Expert Belt can still be used in order to lure in Ground-type Pokemon and hit them with Aqua Tail. Crunch is a decent option over Aqua Tail as it gives Eelektross a way of hitting certain Grass-type Pokemon, such as Exeggutor and Vileplume, for good damage, and it has near perfect coverage alongside its choice of Fighting-type attack. However, keep in mind that Eelektross would rather just U-turn against these Pokemon anyway. Wild Charge might seem like a better choice than Thunder Punch, but if you use it, Eelektross will suffer heavy recoil against Alomomola.</p> <p>Even with Aqua Tail, certain Ground-type Pokemon, such as Torterra and Seismitoad, can cause problems for Eelektross; Ludicolo and Serperior are good options to take care of them. Pokemon with great physical bulk, such as Tangela and Vileplume, can be very difficult for Eelektross to beat. Strong special attackers, such as Charizard and Exeggutor, have little problems against them. Frailer offensive Pokemon love being able to come in with ease, and Eelektross's slow U-turn gives them this opportunity. Swellow, Ursaring, and Zangoose can all capitalize upon free chances to get into battle and activate their status Orbs. Finally, Spikes and Stealth Rock support is very appreciated, as U-turn allows Eelektross to force many switches. Garbodor is a great Spikes user, and Golem, Golurk, and Seismitoad are all great offensive Stealth Rock users.</p>"

  "Beheeyem": {
    "overview": "<p>While Beheeyem faces a lot of competition from the other Psychic-types in the tier, it has one thing going for it that all the others lack: Analytic. When coupled with Beheeyem's horrible Speed, Analytic lets Beheeyem hit like a truck against the majority of the tier. Beheeyem can also use Trick Room, which turns its horrible Speed into an advantage and lets it outspeed the majority of the tier. Unfortunately, Beheeyem only has the bulk to take a single strong hit, making it pretty hard to bring in without getting 2HKOed on the switch, especially as it will get outsped by pretty much everything. Finally, unlike other Psychic-type Pokemon such as Musharna and Mr. Mime, Beheeyem has a lot of difficulty dealing with Dark-types, as it has no way to avoid being trapped by Pokemon such as Skuntank and Liepard.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Beheeyem can use Nasty Plot or Calm Mind with either three offensive moves or two offensive moves alongside Recover, but Beheeyem isn't bulky enough to set up more than once, lacks the Speed to avoid being revenge killed by faster Pokemon, and is outclassed by most of the other Psychic-types in the tier in this regard, such as Musharna and Duosion, both of which do it better. Shadow Ball can be used to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types harder, but Beheeyem needs both Thunderbolt and Signal Beam to beat Steel-, Dark-, and Psychic-types such as Mandibuzz, Probopass, and Exeggutor. Beheeyem can also run dual screens, but it is outclassed in this by Gardevoir, which has access to Destiny Bond and is fast enough to get Reflect and Light Screen up before getting KOed. Finally, Beheeyem can run Substitute on the Trick Room set to avoid Sucker Punch from Pokemon such as Shiftry and Skuntank, but needs its coverage moves to be able to beat as many Pokemon as possible.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>It is actually fairly hard to find a true counter to Beheeyem as few Pokemon can switch into Beheeyem 100% of the time thanks to its incredible power. Unfortunately for Beheeyem, its low base Speed coupled with its average bulk makes it quite easy for faster offensive Pokemon to outspeed it and hit it hard, although this doesn't work as well against the Trick Room set. Dark-types that commonly carry Sucker Punch, such as Skuntank and Shiftry, can revenge kill any of Beheeyem's sets as they can easily OHKO it with their strong priority move. Beheeyem also has problems playing around Liepard, which can Encore it into Trick Room, hit it hard with Sucker Punch, and trap it with Pursuit. Steel-types such as Bronzor, Metang, Bastiodon, and Probopass can serve as shaky checks, since the best they can do is cripple Beheeyem with status, or in Metang's case, 3HKO it with Meteor Mash. If Trick Room isn't up, Ghost- and Bug-types, such as Haunter, Golurk, and Pinsir can also easily force Beheeyem out with their strong super effective STAB moves. Kangaskhan is also a good check to Beheeyem as it can wear down and KO Beheeyem with the combination of Fake Out and Sucker Punch. Furthermore, if Trick Room is down, Kangaskhan can outspeed and KO Beheeyem with Double-Edge.</p> <p>While special walls such as Audino and Lickilicky can only take a single hit from Beheeyem, they can easily retaliate back with a status move which puts Beheeyem on a timer and can easily stop it from sweeping. Taunt is also a good way to deal with the Trick Room set, but most Taunt users won't enjoy taking an attack from Beheeyem. Finally, Beheeyem is worn down easily because of its average bulk and susceptibility to all forms of entry hazards, leaving it prone to being 2HKOed if it tries to switch into any attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>If you are looking for one of the strongest wallbreakers in NU, you have come to the right place. With Choice Specs, Beheeyem has the ability to 2HKO every special wall in NU with the appropriate move and entry hazard support. Keep in mind that this set needs prediction to work perfectly, however, as otherwise it gets forced out often and will get worn down by entry hazard damage. Psychic is the mandatory STAB move and is also Beheeyem's strongest attack. Thunderbolt lets Beheeyem beat Mandibuzz easily and provides awesome coverage with Psychic. Signal Beam is mainly used to beat other Psychic-types and allows Beheeyem to hit Pokemon such as Shiftry, Exeggutor, and Cacturne, which resist its other two moves. With these three moves, Beheeyem can hit the whole tier for at least neutral damage with the appropriate move, making it difficult to wall. Finally, Trick allows Beheeyem to cripple the opponent's walls.</p> <p>Psyshock is a good option over Psychic as it allows Beheeyem to beat special walls more easily, but it's weaker than Psychic against everything else. Hidden Power Ground can also be used to hit Steel-types harder, but Thunderbolt already does a lot to them and most Steel-types can't 2HKO Beheeyem back anyway. Stealth Rock support greatly helps Beheeyem break walls, letting it OHKO Mandibuzz and 2HKO Regice. Speaking of Stealth Rock, Probopass is a great partner for Beheeyem as it can set up Stealth Rock, resists the Bug-, Dark-, and Ghost-type moves which Beheeyem despises, traps troublesome Steel-types, and provides a slow Volt Switch to bring its teammate in safely. Pokemon such as Shell Smash Carracosta and Swords Dance Samurott are also amazing partners as they appreciate Beheeyem's ability to break through walls to help them clean later in the game. Beheeyem's utility as a wallbreaker also makes fast Pokemon such as Tauros, Charizard, and Swellow good partners as they appreciate Beheeyem's ability to OHKO or 2HKO every wall in the tier, clearing a path for destruction. Fighting-types such as Sawk and Gurdurr are also amazing partners as they can easily handle Dark-types for Beheeyem, who is too slow to hit them before they attack it except on the switch-in, while Beheeyem can easily break walls for them to sweep later. Finally, Dark-types such as Skuntank and Mandibuzz are also good partners as they can easily take on the Ghost-types that force Beheeyem out. Speaking of Dark-types, Shiftry pairs well with Beheeyem, as Beheeyem can easily OHKO Mandibuzz, while Shiftry can deal with the Ghost-, Steel-, and Psychic-types that give Beheeyem trouble, such as Haunter, Metang, Golurk, and Gardevoir.</p>"

      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<p>Unlike the Choice Specs set, this set focuses on sweeping later in the game. Trick Room is the most important move here as it allows Beheeyem to outspeed almost everything in the tier. Keep in mind that Trick Room is mainly useful against offensive teams as Beheeyem will easily outspeed a majority of the Pokemon found on those types of teams. Psychic is used as it is Beheeyem's strongest STAB move, while Thunderbolt gives Beheeyem fantastic neutral coverage. This combination only misses out on a few Pokemon such as Exeggutor and Shiftry, both of which are OHKOed by Signal Beam. Thunderbolt also allows Beheeyem to beat Mandibuzz easily.</p> <p>Life Orb is the preferred item for this set as it allows Beheeyem to hit as hard as possible while still letting it switch moves. Psyshock can be used over Psychic to beat special walls more easily, but Psychic is stronger against everything else. Hidden Power Ground can also be used to hit Steel- and Dark-types such as Probopass, Bastiodon, Metang, and Skuntank harder, but it's pretty weak otherwise. Beheeyem can also use Nasty Plot over Signal Beam to help deal with bulkier Pokemon and special walls, but it's hard to pull this off with its horrible Speed and average bulk, and leaves Beheeyem walled by Pokemon such as Exeggutor and Shiftry.</p> <p>As for teammates, Fighting-types such as Gurdurr, Sawk, and Primeape can deal with bothersome Steel- and Dark-types for Beheeyem, while Beheeyem can easily force out the Poison-types that these Fighting-types bring in and set up safely. Dark-types such as Skuntank and Shiftry are also awesome partners; the former can easily take on Psychic- and Ghost-types for Beheeyem, who can in turn set up Trick Room and easily force out the Fighting-types that can take on Skuntank, while the latter can take on Psychic-, Ghost-, and Steel-types with its coverage moves while Beheeyem easily beats Mandibuzz for it. Finally, Probopass pairs well with Beheeyem as it resists Bug-, Dark-, and Ghost-type moves, can set up Stealth Rock to support its teammates, traps troublesome Steel-types, and provides a slow Volt Switch to bring its teammates in safely, while Beheeyem can in turn easily deal with the Fighting-types that threaten Probopass.</p>"

  "Fraxure": {
    "overview": "<p>Fraxure was always a classic case of an otherwise good Pokemon held back by coverage issues. Its movepool was as shallow as could be, with only Dragon-type moves as viable options. However, in the transition to BW2, Fraxure gained numerous new toys in Superpower, Low Kick, and Aqua Tail. As a result, Fraxure stands out among the crowd as the most powerful Dragon in NU, boasting great coverage in just a few moves. Combine that with a great boosting move in Dragon Dance, and you've got a huge threat in the NU metagame.</p> <p>Fraxure does have its flaws, however. It has a pitiful base 67 Speed, so it fails to outspeed much before it boosts. It also has a bad weakness to Ice, which leaves it vulnerable to powerhouses like Rotom-F and Articuno. However, with its great coverage and high Attack Fraxure is still a force to be reckoned with.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fraxure's movepool is almost devoid of other options. That said, there are some unorthodox ones such as X-Scissor and Shadow Claw. Fraxure can also utilize Toxic to wear down walls such as Alomomola and Tangela. Fraxure also has an alternate ability in Rivalry, which can provide more power; however, Mold Breaker is far more reliable. A Liechi or Salac Berry is usable on the Dragon Dance set to keep Fraxure going if it gets low on HP, but both Berries are rather situational. Yache Berry also has a very situational use to survive an Ice Beam from Samurott or Ludicolo, but is completely useless otherwise. Additionally, a Choice Scarf set is usable to transform Fraxure into a solid revenge killer, but it loses out on the sheer power provided by the main sets. Finally, a bulky EV spread of 248 HP / 176 SpD / 88 Spe is also usable with Substitute, Dragon Dance, Dragon Claw, and Low Kick as moves, and can take on walls such as Alomomola.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fraxure is one of few Pokemon that boasts no true counters thanks to its unresisted coverage in just a few moves. Metang and Mawile come the closest to countering Fraxure, as they can take an Outrage or Low Kick, but cannot do much back in return. Piloswine, Mandibuzz, Musharna, and Gurdurr can take a boosted Outrage and cripple it some way; Piloswine can take down Fraxure with a combination of Icicle Spear and Ice Shard; Mandibuzz can tank a hit and hit Fraxure hard with Foul Play; Musharna can paralyze with Thunder Wave; Gurdurr can bring Fraxure down low with a Drain Punch and Mach Punch. Special Samurott and Ludicolo can outspeed unboosted Fraxure and OHKO with Ice Beam, but cannot take on Fraxure if it gets up a Dragon Dance. Ditto with Choice Scarf can check Fraxure as Dragon is weak to itself. Alomomola and Tangela can tank repeated Outrages, but can't do anything back apart from Toxic unless Tangela carries Hidden Power Ice. The main way of defeating Fraxure is to get it weak enough as it tries setting up that it can be picked off easier with priority, bulky attackers, and Choice Scarf Pokemon. Choice Scarf users such as Sawsbuck, Primeape, Rotom-A, and Charizard in particular can deal with a weakened Fraxure rather well.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>This set is Fraxure's most common and most dangerous set. Thanks to Dragon Dance, it can boost its high Attack and subpar Speed to formidable levels. With great coverage in just two moves, Fraxure can easily sweep teams after just one boost. It also stands out from Altaria with its much stronger firepower.</p> <p>Dragon Dance boosts Fraxure's Speed and power. Outrage is the STAB move of choice, hitting nearly everything for heavy damage, especially after a boost. Low Kick is the preferred coverage move, hitting Steel-types such as Bastiodon and Probopass for great damage. Finally, the last slot is up to the player's needs. Taunt allows Fraxure to set up on threats such as Alomomola, while Substitute allows it to evade Sucker Punch from Skuntank. Keep in mind, however, that Fraxure can take a Sucker Punch, so Substitute is not as necessary.</p> <p>Maximum EV values are invested into Attack and Speed to utilize Dragon Dance as effectively as possible. A Jolly nature is chosen here so that Fraxure can outspeed Swellow after one boost. However, an Adamant nature with an EV spread of 56 HP / 252 Atk / 200 Spe is possible to hit harder, as well as catching base 100 Speed Pokemon, such as Charizard, after one boost; however, being able to outspeed Swellow is generally much more important. The item here depends on the player's needs; Eviolite provides Fraxure with more bulk to set up Dragon Dance effectively, while Life Orb provides more power if bulk is not needed. Superpower is an option over Low Kick if Mawile poses a bigger problem than other Steel-types, but the Attack drop is counterproductive to the set's purpose. Likewise, Dragon Claw, Dual Chop, and Aqua Tail are all perfectly acceptable alternatives, although none of them are as good as the moves listed in the set. Swords Dance is also a decent boosting move alongside Dragon Dance.</p> <p>As Fraxure does have issues with Steel-types, such as Metang and Mawile, a Pokemon like Sawk is greatly appreciated to deal with said Steel-types. A dual screens user, such as Gardevoir or Musharna, is also immensely helpful to allow Fraxure to attain boosts more easily. Finally, this set pairs well with powerful attackers, such as Zangoose and Swellow, due to their wallbreaking capabilities.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>As opposed to a setup sweeper, this set aims to hit hard and switch out, keeping up offensive pressure. It also OHKOes the popular users of Stealth Rock and Sturdy. Fraxure also boasts perfect coverage in only a few moves, giving it the edge over other Choice Band users, namely Braviary.</p> <p>Outrage is chosen as the primary STAB move, seriously denting many Pokemon. Superpower is chosen over Low Kick here; its sheer power can KO many Steel-types, including Probopass and Bastiodon, and also fits this set's hit and run nature. Aqua Tail is chosen for its ability to reliably OHKO Golem, as well as for hitting Golurk super effectively when Outrage is risky. Finally, as no additional coverage is needed, Dragon Claw is in the final moveslot to provide a reliable STAB move over Outrage, although it is considerably weaker.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is chosen here to provide the highest Attack stat attainable to hit hard with Choice Band. A Jolly nature is usable, however, to outspeed neutral nature Samurott and Ludicolo; however, the extra Attack provided by an Adamant nature is preferred here. Mold Breaker is the chosen ability to bypass Sturdy, which allows Superpower to OHKO Bastiodon. Low Kick is a usable option over Superpower for its lack of stat drops, but the latter's hit-and-run nature and power is preferable on this set.</p> <p>As Fraxure can struggle with Steel-types, Pokemon such as Sawk are immensely helpful to deal with them. As Fraxure is used to OHKO Stealth Rock users, Pokemon that appreciate the lack of said hazard, such as Swellow, benefit from Fraxure's support. Samurott is also useful to remove Regirock and Armaldo, the two Stealth Rock users that Fraxure cannot OHKO. Powerful physical attackers, such as Zangoose, Samurott, and Sawk, also appreciate Fraxure's ability to bypass said walls. To remove Alomomola and Tangela, Spikes support from Cacturne or Garbodor is greatly appreciated. Additionally, a Pokemon with a trapping ability, such as Probopass or Gothorita, can trap and remove threats such as Bastiodon and Alomomola, respectively. As Fraxure is slow, paralysis support from the likes of Regirock, Regice, or Volbeat is also appreciated to remove faster threats. Finally, a slow user of U-turn or Volt Switch, such as Eelektross, is useful to bring Fraxure in safely.</p>"

  "Stunfisk": {
    "overview": "<p>Stunfisk has a great typing that gives it some interesting resistances, including Flying- and Rock-type attacks. Stunfisk is also surprisingly bulky, which makes it one of the few Pokemon in NU that can beat Flying-types by itself without being a Rock- or Steel-type. Stunfisk's ability, Static, is excellent to punish physical attackers that try to weaken Stunfisk with U-turn or a strong contact move such as Close Combat or Ice Punch, which makes it an interesting wall. Unfortunately, its typing also leaves Stunfisk vulnerable to common Pokemon such as Samurott, Torterra, Golurk, and Seismitoad, which makes it hard for Stunfisk to stay alive.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stunfisk can use a Choice Specs set with Thunderbolt, Earth Power, Sludge Wave, and Surf, which can hit hard against some of the Pokemon that usually switch into Stunfisk, such as Tangela, Ludicolo, Golurk, and Piloswine, but Stunfisk isn't strong enough to punch holes through teams and is better off as a Stealth Rock setter. Stunfisk can also use Foul Play, which allows it to OHKO Choice Band Golurk and hit other physical attackers harder, or Sludge Wave, which allows Stunfisk to hit Pokemon that take nothing from its STABs harder, such as Tangela and Ludicolo, but Stunfisk needs its four moves to function best. Stunfisk also has access to Pain Split to regain health, but it's not that useful with Stunfisk's high HP. Finally, Stunfisk has access to both Yawn and Thunder Wave, but Stunfisk is better off using Toxic to wear down as many Pokemon as possible and Discharge often takes care of paralysis.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Despite Stunfisk's surprising bulk, its typing leaves it open to a lot of Pokemon. Grass-types such as Torterra, Roselia, and Serperior can easily take any hit from Stunfisk, outspeed it, and KO with either a STAB Wood Hammer or Giga Drain. Water-types such as Ludicolo, Samurott, and Seismitoad can also easily outspeed Stunfisk or take a hit and retaliate back with their STABs for the KO. Ground-types such as Piloswine, Golem, and Golurk can easily take on Stunfisk too, being immune to its Electric-type attacks and able to KO Stunfisk with their STAB Earthquake. While they don't resist Stunfisk's STABs, Ice-types such as Regice and Glaceon can take everything from Stunfisk and take it out with their STAB Ice Beam. Finally, Stunfisk has no way to regain health outside of Leftovers, which means it can easily get worn down by entry hazards and status during the game.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>This set makes use of Stunfisk's bulk and typing as a physically defensive wall that can easily beat Flying-types without having to rely on a Rock or Steel typing. Stealth Rock allows Stunfisk to support its teammates with entry hazards. Discharge is used as it allows Stunfisk to spread paralysis and gives it a decent STAB move, while Earth Power is Stunfisk's strongest STAB move that allows it to inflict as much damage as possible against Ground-, Rock-, Electric-, and Steel-types. Finally, Toxic helps Stunfisk cripple troublesome Pokemon such as Audino, Lickilicky, and Alomomola, all of which can easily take a Discharge and recover their health back with Wish.</p> <p>Stunfisk can also use maximum Special Defense investment to take on Pokemon such as Choice Specs Charizard better if needed. Scald can be used over Toxic if you want Stunfisk to burn a physical attacker, but most of the time Stunfisk will prefer Toxic to cripple as many bulky Pokemon as possible.</p> <p>Grass-types such as Tangela, Ludicolo, and Roselia pair well with Stunfisk, as they can easily take Grass-, Water-, and Ground-type attacks for it while Stunfisk can easily deal with the Flying-types that threaten them. Flying-types such as Braviary and Swellow are also great partners for Stunfisk, as they are immune to Ground-type attacks and can easily deal with the Grass-types that threaten Stunfisk, while Stunfisk is immune to Electric-type attacks and can easily KO Rock- and Steel-types to help Braviary or Swellow sweep later in the game. Finally, Mantine can also be a great partner for Stunfisk, as Mantine has a Water- and Ground-type immunity and can easily deal with the Grass-types that threaten Stunfisk, which can easily take on the opponent's Rock- and Electric-types.</p>"

  "Golurk": {
    "overview": "<p>Giant fighting robots are generally tough opponents, and Golurk is no exception, as it is one of the premier physical threats in NU. Its typing grants it a fantastic dual STAB combination, an immunity to Volt Switch, and the ability to check Primeape and Sawk not locked into Ice Punch, two of the tier's most common Fighting-types. Wielding a Choice Band, Golurk is one of the most fearsome wallbreakers, capable of 2HKOing the entire tier with the appropriate move. It can also make use of its numerous switch-in opportunities to support the team by setting up Stealth Rock throughout the match. However, Golurk is often held back by its low Speed, leaving it unable to sweep fast teams and prone to being revenge killed. Its typing is also sometimes a double-edged sword, often forcing it to retreat due to its numerous weaknesses to common types in NU, such as Ice, Water, and Grass.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>No Guard with Dynamic Punch is an option on the Choice Band set; however, Golurk sorely misses the power from Iron Fist and would often prefer the extra KOs over confusion. Besides, it also means that inaccurate moves from the opponent's side, such as Blizzard and Hydro Pump, will directly hit Golurk, and with its low Speed, Golurk will be forced out more often. Substitute can be used with Focus Punch or Dynamic Punch to ease prediction, as well as preventing walls such as Weezing from statusing it. Golurk can wield a Life Orb or Expert Belt to ease prediction, but will either miss the extra power provided by Choice Band or longevity from Leftovers. Hammer Arm or Superpower can be used over Drain Punch for more power, but as they generally hit the same things as Earthquake does and cause negative stat drops, the utility of Drain Punch is preferred. Zen Headbutt can be used to defeat Weezing, but that's all it does. Magic Coat can be used on the Stealth Rock set to reflect back entry hazards and surprise the opponent. Rock Polish can be used to help set up a sweep, but Golurk's Speed is too low to use it effectively and it is revenged killed easily by priority and faster Choice Scarf users such as Samurott. Rain Dance can be used on a rain team, but unless you're pressed for a team slot, it's better left to another Pokemon, as Golurk's niche is in hitting hard. Gravity can be used to utilize an accurate and powerful Dynamic Punch and Earthquake, but Golurk has trouble setting up due to its low Speed, and gets forced out often. Curse can be used to catch walls by surprise, but cuts into its longevity and Golurk would rather do damage directly anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Golurk might be hard to counter, but is very easy to check due to its low Speed and weaknesses to common attacking types. The best counter to the Choice Band set is Weezing, which avoids the 2HKO from all its moves and can wear Golurk down with Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split, and Fire Blast, while only fearing the nonexistent Zen Headbutt. Good prediction is key to countering the Choice Band set, as each move lets certain Pokemon come in on it. Alomomola and Tangela can come in, take a hit and scout for moves, and switch out to the appropriate check while healing HP with Regenerator. Golbat and Misdreavus can switch in on anything bar Ice Punch and Shadow Punch respectively and slowly wear Golurk down. Braviary and Swellow can switch in on both of Golurk's STAB moves and retaliate with Brave Bird or gain momentum with U-turn. Mandibuzz can take any one hit from even Choice Band Golurk and OHKO back with Foul Play, but it will take massive damage if it switches into Choice Band Ice Punch. Similarly, Ludicolo can take a hit, outspeed, and OHKO Golurk, but it is a shaky check at best. Most Pokemon carrying a STAB Water-, Ice-, Grass-, Ghost-, or Dark-type move can come in and revenge kill Golurk. Examples include Samurott, and Ludicolo. Skuntank can also play mind games with Golurk using Sucker Punch and Pursuit if it comes in safely.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Golurk with a Choice Band is one of the hardest Pokemon to counter and can function as a wallbreaker many offensive teams can use. Its numerous resistances allow it to switch into the battlefield many times and its amazing power can easily 2HKO the entire tier, including some Pokemon that resist Ground. However, this set is extremely reliant on prediction, as a wrong move can let a dangerous Pokemon such as Braviary or Samurott set up.</p> <p>Earthquake is Golurk's main STAB move, hitting extremely hard, even 2HKOing the very bulky Alomomola after Stealth Rock and Spikes. Shadow Punch is Golurk's second STAB move. Boosted by Iron Fist, it hits Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Haunter for major damage. Ice Punch provides further coverage, hitting Normal- and Flying-types such as Braviary that are immune to Golurk's STAB moves. It also carries a good chance to 2HKO Tangela after Stealth Rock. Finally, Drain Punch can hit Normal-types for super effective damage, as well as giving Golurk a form of recovery. It can also be used as a relatively safe move if prediction is too risky as it hits Steel-types for super effective damage like Earthquake, while hitting the Normal/Flying Pokemon for neutral damage.</p> <p>The Speed EVs on the set allow Golurk to outpace fully invested Adamant Golem. Thunder Punch is another option that nabs a guaranteed 2HKO on Alomomola after Stealth Rock, although Earthquake hits nearly as hard. Because Golurk needs Stealth Rock up to have a guaranteed 2HKO on the likes of Alomomola and Tangela, entry hazard support is almost mandatory. Metang is an excellent partner, as it can take hits from Swellow, which usually force Golurk out if the user predicts wrongly, and can set up Stealth Rock for Golurk. Garbodor can take Grass-type moves aimed at Golurk and help set up Spikes; meanwhile, Golurk helps to spinblock. Ludicolo is a decent partner for Golurk, as it also appreciates entry hazards and reliably beats most Water-types that threaten Golurk. Because Golurk draws in Tangela and Alomomola often, teammates that set up on them are appreciated. Exeggutor can switch in for free on them most of the time and break them down with powerful special attacks. Calm Mind Musharna with Heal Bell can also set up on Alomomola. Roselia is also a good partner, setting up Spikes against these threats. Finally, Gothorita is also an amazing partner for this set, as it traps and eliminates Weezing, Tangela, and Alomomola for Golurk.</p>"

Thanks to it being part Ghost, Golurk is the only Pokemon in NU that can set up Stealth Rock and spinblock at the same time. Earthquake can get a super effective hit on common leads including Bastiodon, Garbodor, and Golem. Shadow Punch allows Golurk to beat Ghost-types like Misdreavus and Haunter. Finally, Ice Punch hits Normal- and Flying-types such as Swellow and Braviary, which are immune to Golurk's STAB moves.</p> <p>No Guard with Dynamic Punch can be considered, allowing Golurk to mess with opposing leads and prevent them from setting up Stealth Rock. However, this makes dangerous moves from opposing Pokemon fully accurate, such as Will-O-Wisp from Misdreavus and Weezing and Hydro Pump from Samurott and Ludicolo. Drain Punch can be used as a form of health recovery, while Stone Edge can be run to deal more damage to opposing Mandibuzz. Colbur Berry can be used over Leftovers to lure in Skuntank and OHKO with Earthquake. The Speed EVs outpace max Speed Adamant Golem. This Golurk is most effective on balanced teams, as it can stick around and set up Stealth Rock throughout the match while providing an offensive presence. Good partners include those that appreciate entry hazards to help them nab extra KOs, such as Ludicolo, Sawsbuck, and Kangaskhan. As this Golurk hates Ice-, Water-, Grass-, and Ghost-type moves, partners that can deal with them are appreciated. Skuntank beats Haunter reliably and appreciates the presence of Stealth Rock. Similarly, Ludicolo can take on Water-types like Samurott for Golurk. Garbodor is another good partner, as it can lay down Spikes to help the entire team, shares good synergy with Golurk, and has its entry hazards spinblocked by Golurk.</p>"

  "Braviary": {
    "overview": "<p>One of the most dangerous offensive threats in NU, Braviary is a force to be reckoned with. Along with its powerful moves and high Attack, it packs a surprising amount of versatility; for instance, its Bulk Up set gives bulkier teams problems while its Choice Band set makes for a dangerous wallbreaker. Also, unlike other Pokemon of its typing, Braviary has good bulk and coverage moves, with Superpower doing major damage to Pokemon that could otherwise withstand its STAB moves. Braviary's biggest downfall is its Speed stat—while it's not exactly slow, it is slower than most other offensive threats in the tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Roost + 3 Attacks set with a Life Orb is an interesting option, considering it can allow Braviary to keep itself healthy and switch moves. However, Braviary's Speed issue makes it a bit hard to pull off a Roost despite its bulk. A similar set with an Expert Belt or Sharp Beak can bluff a Choice item if the need arises. Tailwind can patch up Braviary's Speed issue. In particular, a set of 56 HP / 248 Atk / 204 Spe with an Adamant nature with Tailwind, Bulk Up, Brave Bird, Roost, and a Sharp Beak can act as a mixture of other sets and helps against offensive and defensive teams. While this gives Braviary more versatility, it lowers its effectiveness against either offensive or defensive teams. Rock Slide alongside Sheer Force can act as a strong Rock move, but that is practically it, and it is generally unneeded. Heat Wave with the aforementioned ability, with enough Special Attack EVs and a Life Orb, can 2HKO Metang, which is quite possibly the only Pokemon that can wall Braviary. Crush Claw is interesting for a Normal STAB as it can provide Defense drops against the opponent, but Return has quite a bit more Base Power than it. Finally, Braviary's decent defensive stats, instant recovery, and other moves such as Whirlwind and Toxic can amount to a defensive set, but its defensive typing is not stellar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Braviary can be tough to counter thanks to its Bulk Up set that can mess up typical counters. Metang is the closest that you can get to a counter, as with a bit of investment in Attack, it won't be set up on by Bulk Up Braviary, and its typing and high Defense allow it to take onslaughts and avoid getting 2HKOed by any of its moves. Rock Pokemon with Rock Blast, such as Golem, are generally safe bets against Braviary, only really fearing Choice Band-boosted Superpowers, and they can get through Braviary's Substitutes thanks to the move hitting multiple times. Probopass and Lairon, despite easily falling to a Superpower, are some of the best solutions against the Bulk Up set, as thanks to Power Gem and Roar they cannot be set up on at all, and they 4x resist both of Braviary's STABs. Other Rock-types, such as Carracosta and Regirock, are bulky enough, or in the case of Carracosta, have Solid Rock in order to survive a Superpower if they get hit by one, but with only Stone Edge they can have difficulty against Bulk Up sets. Alomomola can survive attacks thanks to its high Defense and can attempt to stall out Braviary with Wish. However, Alomomola is setup fodder for Bulk Up as a result of it being incapable of breaking Braviary's Substitutes even before Braviary begins boosting. Finally, if all else fails, Electrode is a somewhat reliable revenge killer, outspeeding even Adamant Choice Scarf Braviary without needing one of its own, and Rotom-A and Zebstrika can revenge kill any set while being capable of using a Choice Scarf of their own for the aforementioned set. Stealth Rock and Brave Bird recoil also wears Braviary down quite a bit over the match, especially Choice variants.</p>",

      "Substitute + Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>This is arguably Braviary's most dangerous set—with a combination of a good bulk, access to reliable recovery, and a reliable, strong STAB move, it makes for a dangerous Bulk Up user. Not only can this variant of Braviary easily deal with defensive teams thanks to the aforementioned traits, but it can also set up on Pokemon that could otherwise deal with its other sets. For example, Braviary can set up a Substitute on Rock-types that rely on Stone Edge, such as Regirock or Carracosta, when they switch in, then use a combination of that and Roost until they run out of PP for Stone Edge, and then start setting up Bulk Ups as they are unable to damage it with a super effective attack.</p> <p>Bulk Up is the main move on this set, patching up Braviary's uninvested Defense to cushion attacks from Rock-types in particular and making its already impressive Attack higher. Roost allows Braviary to keep itself healthy, as it tends to get worn down from a combination of Substitute, Brave Bird recoil, and repeated attacks from the opposition. Substitute allows Braviary to get in additional boosts and avoid status moves. Many weaker Pokemon, such as Tangela, Alomomola, Roselia, and defensive Seismitoad, will find themselves unable to break past Braviary's Substitutes in one hit, which means that Braviary can set up an additional Bulk Up and keep its Substitute intact for the next Pokemon. Brave Bird is the best option for the STAB move, as even though it causes recoil, nothing is immune to Brave Bird, making it more optimal for a mono-attacker than a Normal STAB move. Even without any boosts, it still does quite a bit of damage to any Pokemon that doesn't resist it.</p> <p>The given EVs allow Braviary to outspeed Adamant Torterra and everything slower, with the remaining EVs being thrown into HP and Special Defense. Maximum HP allows Braviary to make 101 HP substitutes, and even though users of Seismic Toss are rare, being able to set up on them is always nice. Defiant is chosen as the ability—while it doesn't come in handy too often, it is the only ability that actually helps it out. Braviary could potentially run more Speed, but there isn't much that is worth catching up to without sacrificing Braviary's bulk. Leftovers should be used as the item, as it allows Braviary to receive passive recovery as it is setting up. Return could be used for the attacking option, as it causes no recoil damage and it hits Electric-types neutrally, but Ghost-types will then wall this set completely, with Misdreavus in particular no longer being set up fodder.</p> <p>This variant of Braviary is rather self-sufficient, but it finds it challenging to set up against Electric-types and can also be revenge killed by them. A bulky Ground-type such as Seismitoad, Piloswine, or Golurk therefore makes a good partner; they are also capable of taking down Bastiodon and Probopass, which can deal with Braviary with Roar and Power Gem, respectively. Toxic Spikes, and to an extent Spikes, support is very helpful for wearing down Rock-types quicker, as even though Braviary can potentially set up on them, they still pose a threat to Braviary. As a result, Garbodor is a good partner, and Braviary can switch into an Earthquake that might be targeted at it. Finally, Pokemon, generally Normal-types, that struggle against Rock-types but have a means of wearing them down via coverage moves, such as Zangoose, Kangaskhan, or Tauros, appreciate the fact that Braviary can use them to set up on under the right circumstances, although note that Braviary cannot directly switch in in these situations.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Equipped with a Choice Band, Braviary becomes one of the most powerful wallbreakers in the tier. To put it into perspective, with the correct move, Braviary is capable of 2HKOing at worst almost every Pokemon in the tier after Stealth Rock, an incredible feat, ensuring almost nothing is safe if Braviary can predict correctly. Brave Bird is the main STAB, easily destroying any Pokemon that does not resist it, and even though the recoil damage can be annoying when in conjunction with Braviary's Stealth Rock weakness, its good coverage makes it preferable to use in most cases. Return is a less powerful, alternative STAB move, but it does have the advantage of not causing recoil damage, making it more optimal to clean the opponent's team with if the need arises. It also hits Electric-types, notably Eelektross and Rotom-S (the latter resists every other move on this set), for neutral damage. Superpower is used in order to deter Rock- and Steel-types from switching into Braviary easily; this ensures that Regirock and the like won't be able to easily wall it as they risk a 2HKO. Finally, U-turn is good for keeping momentum and scouting for switch-ins while still hitting mildly hard.</p> <p>Despite the fact that the given EVs are fairly straightforward, an alternative spread of 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe with an Adamant nature will get the jump on neutral-natured Samurott and Ludicolo while getting a bit of extra bulk. However, it is usually worth going in at maximum Speed in order to try to outspeed and OHKO opposing Braviary before they do the same back to it, as it can do that even with a Jolly nature. In the rare case Braviary receives a stat drop from an opponent's attack or ability, Defiant will make Braviary almost impossible to wall as a result. Sleep Talk is an interesting option for Braviary to act as sleep fodder to try and power through Grass-types such as Tangela even when it is statused. However, it's difficult to find a free moveslot for the move, as the listed moves are all useful in their own right.</p> <p>Although Braviary has Superpower to defeat Rock- and Steel-types, they still get a free switch into both of Braviary's STAB moves, meaning Braviary will usually have to predict their switch-in to defeat them. As a result, a good idea would be to partner up Braviary with a Fighting-type such as Sawk that can defeat them. Running Choice Band Sawk in particular means that you can have two incredibly powerful physical attackers that can provide a great deal of offensive pressure. Thanks to Mold Breaker, Sawk can OHKO most Stealth Rock setters as well, something which Braviary likes the absence of. Swellow makes an interesting partner. Similar to the double Dragon strategy in OU, teams may be hard-pressed to deal with two strong Normal / Flying Pokemon, as Braviary can break down their checks while Swellow can finish them off thanks to its high Speed. Finally, Spikes support is suggested in order to wear down walls that might try to survive onslaughts such as Regirock and Metang. Cacturne is an example, and with a Grass STAB it performs decently against Rock-types.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Despite the fact that Braviary lacks the Speed of other Choice users common in the metagame, such as Primeape and Charizard, it makes up for it by being able to secure KOs much more easily thanks to its high-powered moves and a high Attack stat. In addition, while it will almost never outspeed another Pokemon with a Choice Scarf, it still at least outspeeds Swellow, the fastest common unboosted Pokemon in the tier, so it can still be reliable enough in most situations to revenge kill any unboosted threat. Brave Bird serves as the main STAB move, and even without any boosting item, it still hits hard enough to finish off, if not OHKO, frailer foes, while Return serves as an alternative STAB that doesn't have any recoil. Return is also better for cleaning up the opponent's team, as the lack of recoil ensures that a sweep won't be cut short in these situations. Superpower still hits Rock- and Steel-types for super effective damage, but be warned that, without an item like the Choice Band boosting its Attack, it won't hit bulkier Pokemon of this type very hard. Finally, U-turn is useful to gain momentum and scout, especially early-game, and Braviary's Speed will ensure that its U-turn will usually go first.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is preferred on Braviary, as the only Pokemon that it would get the jump on with a positive nature are Electrode, Butterfree at +1, and certain +2 foes. However, Jolly is usable if these, along with other neutral-natured Choice Scarf users that have a base 85 Speed, such as Sawk or Pinsir, are issues, but the power is usually more important. Defiant is once again chosen as the ability, as it is the only ability that will help Braviary, while making Intimidate users such as Tauros unreliable against it. Due to the typical defensive stats of what Superpower hits super effectively, it won't be doing very much damage to them, and even with that considered, Braviary will have to predict their switch-in to hit them, as they take very little damage from its STAB moves. As a result, a strong Fighting-or Ground-type, such as Sawk or Golurk, can dent them with their STAB moves and possibly provide offensive pressure to prevent Stealth Rock from going up. Speaking of Stealth Rock, because Braviary can keep momentum with U-turn and will often have to switch in because it is a revenge killer, its weakness to the move can be troubling. A spinner therefore makes a good partner, with Wartortle being a standout example due to it doing well against Rock-types due to its typing. Other Pokemon that can learn U-turn or Volt Switch can be paired up with Braviary in order to create a VoltTurn core. Primeape provides U-turn, and its Fighting STAB makes it able to dent Rock- and Steel-types pretty well.</p>"

  "Mandibuzz": {
    "overview": "<p>Mandibuzz is one of the best defensive Pokemon in NU. Thanks to its combination of great bulk, good Speed, and awesome support moves, Mandibuzz can function as an effective pivot, wall, and stallbreaker in one teamslot. On top of this, Mandibuzz's typing lets it check many of the Psychic-types in the tier. Balanced and defensive teams really appreciate the support that Mandibuzz offers because it can help beat opposing stall teams with its fast Taunt and many offensive threats with its STAB Foul Play. Unfortunately, Mandibuzz's Stealth Rock weakness makes it more difficult to switch into powerful attacks. Its few resistances also hold Mandibuzz back, forcing it to rely strictly on its bulk in order to take hits. Finally, Taunt and Encore completely shut down Mandibuzz and keep it from doing its job effectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mandibuzz can't run many sets outside of the one covered. One potential set that might be appealing is a Nasty Plot set with coverage moves such as Dark Pulse, Heat Wave, and Air Slash. The problem with this set is that Mandibuzz needs multiple boosts before it has any kind of offensive presence, and many other Pokemon can run sets like this one much better. When looking at other options, you're typically better off running a set similar to the one listed with other moves. One potential option for another move is Punishment, a move that can take out many setup sweepers thanks to the boost in power it gets for every stat boost the opponent has. Unfortunately, Mandibuzz isn't capable of utilizing this move well, as Foul Play take out most offensive sweepers well enough as it is, and Punishment relies on the opponent boosting in order to make good use of it. Snarl is another interesting option for Mandibuzz, as it helps it defeat the special attackers that like to switch into it. Finally, Rain Dance and Sunny Day can work well on weather teams, as there aren't very many bulky Pokemon in the tier that have access to these two moves and can fit it onto their sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>The easiest way of defeating Mandibuzz is to overwhelm it with strong attackers. If you give it a free turn to switch in and Roost, Mandibuzz is going to be an issue for your team, as most defensive Pokemon cannot outspeed it and hit it with a status move before being Taunted. In fact, Regirock, Probopass, and Bastiodon are some of the only defensive Pokemon that can take Mandibuzz out, as they all typically carry a super effective STAB to hit Mandibuzz with and take minimal damage from Foul Play thanks to their massive defenses. You should also aim to get Stealth Rock up as soon as possible in the match to hinder Mandibuzz when it tries to switch into attacks. Faster Pokemon carrying Toxic can also cripple Mandibuzz and make it even harder for it to switch into attacks. Truly the easiest way to take out Mandibuzz offensively is by exploiting its weaknesses. Ice-types such as Regice and Rotom-F; Electric-types such as Rotom-S and Eelektross; and Rock-types such as Rampardos, Golem, and Carracosta are all able to pick off Mandibuzz with their powerful STAB attacks. Finally, bulky Fighting-types, such as Gurdurr and Throh, benefit from taking a Toxic thanks to Guts and often carry coverage moves to hit Mandibuzz for super effective damage. Even if Mandibuzz uses Roost against them, Gurdurr and Throh can hit it with their powerful Fighting-type attacks for super effective damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Mandibuzz is best played as a fast, defensive Pokemon that can both take hits and break down walls and tanks with Toxic and Taunt. One of the main reasons to use Mandibuzz is its access to STAB Foul Play, a move that hits opposing offensive Pokemon for solid damage and compensates for its low offensive stats. Taunt, when used with Mandibuzz's great Speed, helps to break down opposing walls and stall teams by preventing them from using their support moves and forcing them to attack. Roost provides Mandibuzz with reliably recovery to keep itself healthy throughout the match. Finally, Toxic is used to break down opposing walls and wear down the Pokemon that Foul Play fails to take out.</p> <p>The EV spread for this set allows Mandibuzz to outspeed Timid Gorebyss and use Taunt to prevent it from setting up or Toxic to hinder it after a Shell Smash. The remaining EVs are placed in HP and Defense to help it take on neutral physical attacks, as Mandibuzz's weaknesses to common Ice- and Electric-type attacks make it difficult to run a specially defensive spread. Still, Mandibuzz's EVs are very easy to change around to fit your team's needs. Big Pecks is used on this set because its other abilities are entirely inferior, and with Big Pecks, Mandibuzz can prevent Defense drops from moves such as Samurott's Razor Shell. A lot of other moves can be used on this set as well, depending on what kind of support your team needs. Brave Bird can be used over Foul Play to hit Fighting-types and Ludicolo for greater damage. On more offensive teams, U-turn can be used to let Mandibuzz come in to take a hit and pivot out into a teammate to keep up offensive momentum. On more defensive teams, Mandibuzz can utilize other support moves such as Knock Off, Whirlwind, and Substitute.</p> <p>There are many different Pokemon that make good teammates for Mandibuzz. A special wall or tank can form a good defensive core with Mandibuzz; Audino, Lickilicky, and Regice can all serve this role. The first two can provide much appreciated Heal Bell support for Mandibuzz with the added bonus of Wish support to compensate for Stealth Rock damage. Regice also works well because of its resistance to Ice-type attacks and its ability to beat most Electric-types. Because Stealth Rock is such a problem for a defensive Pokemon like Mandibuzz, having a spinner can be really useful to get rid of Stealth Rock. Wartortle is a good choice for a spinner, as it can take on many Ice- and Rock-type Pokemon. In general, tanks that share good defensive synergy with Mandibuzz make good partners for it; Piloswine resists Ice-types attacks, is immune to Electric-type attacks, and beats most Rock-type Pokemon, while Seismitoad resists Rock-type attacks and is also immune to Electric-type attacks.</p>"

  "Heatmor": {
    "overview": "<p>Heatmor is a very mediocre Pokemon in NU, being one of the myriad of Fire-types outclassed by Charizard. Due to its poor defenses as well as its mediocre Speed, Heatmor will often be outsped and KOed before it has a chance to do anything. Heatmor also has a crippling Stealth Rock weakness, shortening its already limited lifespan. Despite these flaws, Heatmor has a few redeeming qualities that prevent it from being completely worthless in the NU metagame. Thanks to its high offensive stats as well as its amazing movepool, Heatmor can run a mixed set relatively well. Heatmor is also the only Fire-type in NU capable of using Sucker Punch, allowing it to revenge kill miscellaneous threats its competition cannot. Despite these perks, Heatmor should never be your first choice for a Fire-type, and you should always consider your other options before using it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Curse set with Curse, Fire Punch, Thunder Punch, and Sucker Punch can be used, but Heatmor's poor defenses and bad defensive typing make it difficult to set up and it can rarely take advantage of the Attack boost due to the low Base Power of its physical attacks. Heatmor can use Pursuit to a decent effect, as it forces out Jynx, Exeggutor, Gardevoir, and Haunter out of fear of its other moves. Hidden Power Ice is usable to hit Altaria, but it doesn't hit anything else notable. Heatmor can use a Sunny Day set with Sunny Day, Fire Blast, Sucker Punch, and Solar Beam, but to be perfectly honest, Sucker Punch is the only reason to use Heatmor over other Fire-types such as Charizard and Rapidash in this regard. Finally, Heatmor can use support moves such as Taunt, Will-O-Wisp, Knock Off, and Toxic, but this is better left to bulkier Pokemon such as Misdreavus.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Heatmor's power and coverage make it relatively difficult to counter. Camerupt is not hit super effectively by any of Heatmor's attacks and can put it into an unfavorable position with Earth Power. Regirock falls into a similar category, as apart from Giga Drain, it isn't fazed by whatever Heatmor throws at it and can OHKO it with Stone Edge. Water-types such as offensive Seismitoad, Carracosta, and Samurott can switch into any move not named Giga Drain and OHKO Heatmor with their respective STAB moves. While Heatmor is a difficult Pokemon to counter, it isn't very hard to check due to its low Speed and common weaknesses. Common offensive Pokemon such as Choice Band Sawk and Primeape can take a Sucker Punch and OHKO in return with Close Combat. Kangaskhan can revenge kill Heatmor with the combination of Fake Out and Double-Edge. Overall, if you have anything faster than Heatmor that can take a Sucker Punch, you shouldn't have many problems with it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Heatmor's wide array of coverage moves, it can function as a relatively decent wallbreaker. Fire Blast serves as the main STAB move, and thanks to its high Base Power, it can 2HKO relatively bulky Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Misdreavus. Giga Drain has amazing coverage with Fire Blast, hitting Water- and Rock-types, such as Seismitoad, Samurott, Alomomola, and Regirock, for super effective damage. Superpower is the premier option in the third slot, as it reliably 2HKOes special walls such as Audino and Lickilicky. Sucker Punch is what sets Heatmor apart from other Fire-types, as it revenge kills several Pokemon, such as Jynx, Haunter, and Swellow, that they cannot. However, you should only Sucker Punch when the foe is weakened, as it is very weak without a STAB boost and cannot OHKO many Pokemon.</p> <p>The given EV spread allows Heatmor to outspeed minimum Speed base 80s, such as Stoutland and Gardevoir, while allowing Heatmor to take down Audino and Lickilicky with Superpower after being hit by Fire Blast. Hone Claws is a possible option to increase the power of Sucker Punch as well as the accuracy of Fire Blast. However, Heatmor's below average bulk prevents it from setting up reliably. Focus Blast can be used to hit Pokemon such as Miltank and Regirock harder and still deal a large amount of damage to Lickilicky and Audino, but its low accuracy is a major drawback. Heatmor's great power and coverage allow it to use Expert Belt effectively, but more often than not, the additional power from Life Orb is more useful. Because of Heatmor's low Speed and defenses, a large amount of team support is required for it to function effectively. Heatmor loathes entry hazards, so Pokemon that can prevent them going up, such as Choice Band Sawk and Taunt Serperior, make great partners. As Heatmor forces a large amount of switches, entry hazard support from Roselia, Garbodor, or Scolipede is recommended to put pressure on the foe's team. As for offensive partners, Jynx is a fantastic one, as she can switch into Water-type moves thanks to Dry Skin and can threaten Ground- and Dragon-types such as Golurk and Fraxure with Ice Beam. Torterra is another amazing partner, as it can switch into the Rock- and Ground-types moves Heatmor fears and also hit Water-types super effectively with Wood Hammer.</p>"

  "Zweilous": {
    "overview": "<p>Zweilous is a niche Pokemon that should only be used on a need basis, but it possesses a few qualities that make can make it worthwhile. It has great bulk with Eviolite and can support defensive teams by walling a large portion of the special attackers in NU. It can also provide phazing to rack up damage from entry hazards with Dragon Tail and Roar. Offensively, it can deal massive damage with Outrage and Crunch, while taking advantage of its typing and the appropriate moves to get past the top physical walls in the tier, Alomomola and Misdreavus, opening the path for partners to break through. Its lack of reliable recovery means that it gets worn down quickly by entry hazards, putting a hamper on its ability to wall Pokemon or just stay alive during a match; as a result, Zweilous requires support to make the best out of it. While Zweilous's typing has great resistances, it also comes with some terrible weaknesses that common Pokemon such as Scolipede, Jynx, and Primeape can easily take advantage of.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Zweilous can use a Choice Scarf to outspeed up to base 110 Pokemon such as Tauros, but its reliance on Hustle means that it has to take a gamble every time, making it a poor revenge killer. It can also use a Choice Band to break apart almost every wall with Outrage, but generally speaking, as soon as it grabs a KO, it will leave Zweilous open to being KOed itself due to its lack of bulk without Eviolite. Zweilous has more gimmicky options that it can use such as Taunt and Torment, but it doesn't have room for them in its sets, and it's far too slow to use Taunt. It also has access to Rain Dance and Sunny Day, but there are better Pokemon capable of setting up weather that also bring other kinds of utility to those kinds of teams. Zweilous would also need to make a choice between using Eviolite to have an easier time setting up weather, or a Damp Rock or Heat Rock to extend the amount of time the weather is up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>While it can be a little difficult to get a free switch into a defensive Zweilous due to its constant phazing, the only real threatening thing about it is just that. With Zweilous's specially defensive set being unable to hit hard, Pokemon such as Scolipede, Primeape, Sawk, Samurott, Jynx, and Piloswine are capable of doing major damage to Zweilous without much of a risk. On the other hand, offensive sets are countered depending on their move choices; sets without Superpower are beaten by Steel-type Pokemon such as Probopass, Klang, and Bastiodon, and sets without Crunch are forced out after Superpower's stat drops or Outrage's confusion. Alomomola, Tangela, and Regirock can take Outrages and Crunches, but have to watch out for Toxic crippling them. Gurdurr benefits from Toxic due to Guts and can take an Outrage while retaliating back with a Drain Punch. As both sets lack reliable recovery, they are easily worn down by entry hazards, which makes any kind of neutral attack deal significant damage to Zweilous.</p>",

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Zweilous's Dark / Dragon typing grants it many resistances to common special attacks, and with 72 / 70 / 70 defenses alongside Eviolite, it can take on a huge slew of special attackers in the tier. The list of Pokemon that Zweilous beats is huge; these Pokemon provide it opportunities to phaze teams around with Roar and Dragon Tail to rack up damage from Stealth Rock and Spikes. Pokemon such as Eelektross, Rotom-S, Zebstrika, Serperior, Exeggutor, Ludicolo, Alomomola, Musharna, Charizard, Misdreavus, and Haunter make up a large portion of the metagame and are easily walled and taken advantage of by Zweilous.</p> <p>Zweilous's main draw, other than walling special attackers, is its ability to phaze other Pokemon with both Roar and Dragon Tail. Roar ignores the effects of Hustle and allows for more reliable phazing, while Dragon Tail ignores the effects of Taunt and deals damage but only has a shaky 72% accuracy when putting Hustle into account. Having both Roar and Dragon Tail at once might seem weird, but it maximizes the chances of Sleep Talk picking a phazing move, which is extremely useful to keep a phazing chain going. Crunch is a good option over Dragon Tail for 2HKOing Musharna, Duosion, and Misdreavus, but its use ends there. Crunch gets in the way of Sleep Talk's phazing and only deals decent damage to neutral targets. However, if your team is weak to those targets, Crunch can be a blessing as the combination of good special bulk, phazing, and ability to beat Musharna, Duosion, and Misdreavus is not found on many other Pokemon in the tier.</p> <p>60 Speed EVs allow Zweilous to outspeed uninvested Alomomola and Tangela while also phazing them through Sleep Talk before they can do anything in return. This is really useful for Zweilous as it prevents Alomomola and Tangela from using Wish or Leech Seed, respectively, which would decrease the damage done on the Pokemon being forced in to take damage from entry hazards. With all the talk about entry hazards, it should come to no surprise that some of the best partners for Zweilous are Stealth Rock and Spikes users. As this set is more tailored to fit on defensive teams, the best Stealth Rock users for the job are Metang, Bastiodon, Torkoal, and Regirock. Each have niches for stall teams and pair well with Zweilous, especially Metang and Torkoal, who have good defensive synergy with it and support it by countering Jynx and providing Rapid Spin support, respectively.</p> <p>Rapid Spin users in general are very good for Zweilous, who doesn't like having to switch into entry hazards while attempting to wall the Pokemon it needs to. Torkoal and Wartortle are the best defensive Rapid Spin users in the tier; Torkoal is a good check to Scolipede, Primeape, and Jynx that bother Zweilous, while Wartortle can guarantee Rapid Spin thanks to Foresight. As Zweilous is constantly using Rest, Heal Bell and Aromatherapy are great support options for it. They allow Zweilous to instantly wake up without having to be out on the field for two turns, which is useful if it desperately needs to be awake to heal with Rest or phaze with Roar. Musharna and Misdreavus are the best users of Heal Bell to partner with Zweilous as they can take the Fighting-type attacks aimed at it. Meganium, Audino, and Lickilicky are also good options to use Aromatherapy or Heal Bell on stall teams, but they compound weaknesses with Zweilous.</p>"

      "Offensive Tank": {
        "description": "<p>Hustle gives Zweilous a lot of power, and a STAB Outrage in a metagame where Steel-type Pokemon are uncommon is frightening. With the metagame being more inclined towards offense, Outrage is generally an OHKO on most offensive Pokemon with only a few of them avoiding an OHKO after Stealth Rock. Due to its decent bulk with Eviolite and good typing, Zweilous is capable of setting up a Substitute on a good number of Pokemon, including Alomomola, Misdreavus, Tangela without HP Ice, Roselia, Eelektross, Exeggutor, and Serperior. Most importantly, it allows Zweilous to turn the most popular physical walls in the tier, Alomomola and Misdreavus, into complete setup bait. Toxic, alongside Substitute, allows Zweilous to beat Alomomola and Tangela, crippling them so that Zweilous's partners can break through them. Crunch is a reliable STAB attack that, unlike Outrage, doesn't lock Zweilous into one move. Superpower can be used to hit Probopass, Klang, and Bastiodon, but it doesn't work well with Substitute due to the Defense and Attack drops, forcing you to wear down Alomomola with only Toxic or risk an Outrage confusion.</p> <p>208 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow Zweilous to outspeed max Speed Timid Gorebyss and slower Pokemon such as Misdreavus, Exeggutor, and Alomomola, all of which give Zweilous an opportunity to set up a Substitute. Zweilous also can use a moveset of Thunder Wave, Outrage, Crunch, and Superpower with a 196 HP / 252 Atk / 60 Spe EV spread and an Adamant nature to spread around paralysis, hit harder, and have more coverage options than the main set. 60 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed uninvested Roselia so it can OHKO Roselia before it can set up Spikes, and the HP EVs allow it to take several hits thanks to Eviolite. While that set has more bulk and more coverage, it loses out on the utility brought by Substitute and Toxic, which allows it to do important things like bring down Alomomola and set up on Misdreavus.</p> <p>Thanks to its ability to lure in and defeat Alomomola and Tangela, as well as turning Misdreavus into setup fodder, Pokemon that struggle against any of them, such as Kangaskhan, Primeape, Sawk, Carracosta, Scolipede, and Charizard, make good partners. As Zweilous lacks any form of recovery, entry hazards and constant use of Substitute wear it down quickly. For that reason, Wish support is appreciated to keep Zweilous alive; Alomomola in particular is a great partner as Zweilous can defeat most of the Pokemon that gives it trouble.</p>"
