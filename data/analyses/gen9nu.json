  "Sandslash-Alola": {
    "overview": "<p>Alolan Sandslash is a great role compressor by virtue of being a Steel-type with access to entry hazards, hazard removal, and item removal. While it is not the strongest Pokemon to fulfill any of these roles individually, this unique combination of traits in combination with its ability to check foes like Munkidori and Alolan Muk makes it a decent choice for balanced and defensive teams. Alolan Sandslash also finds use as an offensive Swords Dance sweeper thanks to its ability, Slush Rush, and snow support from its regional pal Alolan Ninetales. This lets Alolan Sandlash outspeed some of the tier's most prominent Choice Scarf users like Flygon and Flamigo. Unfortunately, other Choice Scarf users like Munkidori and Infernape still outspeed Alolan Sandslash under snow and put a stop to its sweep. Additionally, Alolan Sandslash's special bulk is quite poor compared to the other Steel-types in the tier, and its crippling 4x weaknesses to both Fighting- and Fire-type attacks from Pokemon like Toxicroak and Chandelure can force Alolan Sandslash to Terastallize. Defensive sets in particular struggle to deal meaningful damage to common defensive Pokemon like Avalugg and Swampert, and they do little to dissuade offensive threats like Paldean Tauros-W, Paldean Tauros-F, and Incineroar from entering the field. Alolan Sandslash can struggle to find safe turns to set up because of its exploitable typing, and its reliance on snow leads to it being easily revenge killed once snow ends.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bulky variants of Alolan Sandslash can also run Iron Head to surprise Alolan Ninetales and Diancie, but dropping either its Ice-type STAB move or Knock Off is usually not worth the tradeoffs. Ice Shard can be used to aid teams that otherwise lack priority in picking off low HP foes and catch Flygon off-guard before it can use Earthquake or U-turn, but the low Base Power can render you ineffective against bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tsareena. This also helps offensive sets surprise Choice Scarf Flamigo and Flygon after snow expires. Super Fang can be a decent midground option to deal significant damage to bulky switch-ins like Swampert and Vaporeon, but Knock Off is usually more consistent at making long-term progress, especially when paired with Spikes. Offensive sets have a few more item options at their disposal: Wide Lens brings Triple Axel to near-perfect accuracy, reducing the move's biggest drawback. Lum Berry's ability to cure status can be extremely helpful against Vaporeon, Milotic, and Klefki. Clear Amulet blocks attack drops from Intimidate from foes like Incineroar and Paldean Tauros-W, enabling comparable damage after to Life Orb sets after a Swords Dance without the self-damage drawback. Finally, you can simply run Leftovers or Sitrus Berry to improve Alolan Sandslash's longevity, as its uninvested physical bulk under snow is still quite decent.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Paldean Tauros-W, Paldean Tauros-F, Infernape, and Hariyama can consistently switch into Alolan Sandslash's Ice-type attacks and Knock Off and threaten an OHKO with Close Combat. With a Choice Scarf, Infernape is even able to outspeed maximum Speed Alolan Sandslash under snow. Non-Fighting-types with Fighting-type coverage, such as Body Press Bronzong and Focus Blast Munkidori, can also force Alolan Sandslash to switch out or KO it by surprise.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types are incredibly threatening to Alolan Sandslash, as it has a crippling 4x weakness to Fire-type attacks and they resist both of its STAB moves. Incineroar takes minimal damage from all of Alolan Sandslash's attacks bar Earthquake. Chandelure can be a difficult matchup, as it gains momentum by switching in to block Rapid Spin, but it can be predicted and hit with a super effective Knock Off or Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Due to Alolan Sandslash's low Special Defense, even resisted attacks from special wallbreakers like Toxtricity, Porygon-Z, and Choice Specs Sylveon can easily overwhelm Alolan Sandslash. Offensive Alolan Sandslash does not suffer to the same degree, as it can outspeed these Pokemon under snow and OHKO them after a Swords Dance boost.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Avalugg walls both offensive and defensive variants of Alolan Sandslash, threatens an OHKO with Body Press, and can remove entry hazards Alolan Sandslash has set with Rapid Spin. Bulky Water-types like Vaporeon and Milotic can shrug off hits and threaten to burn Alolan Sandslash with Scald, and defensive Alolan Sandslash often gives them breathing room to heal themselves or their teammates with Wish and Recover. Defensive tanks like Diancie and Duraludon can easily take on Alolan Sandslash one-on-one and set their own hazards, while Rocky Helmet users like Overqwil, Swampert, and Galarian Slowbro can be annoying for Triple Axel variants of Alolan Sandslash due to the massive recoil damage inflicted.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Flygon, Swampert, and Gastrodon threaten massive damage to Alolan Sandslash with Earthquake and Earth Power, but Flygon in particular does not enjoy switching into its Ice-type attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Icicle Crash is used to avoid contact and fish for potential flinches against slower foes, while Ice Spinner can be used for a 100% accurate move with the additional utility of clearing Terrain effects. Knock Off is used to pressure Ghost-types that could attempt to block Rapid Spin, like Chandelure and Basculegion-M, and threaten considerable damage against Psychic-types like Bronzong, Munkidori, and Uxie while making progress against defensive switch-ins like Avalugg, Paldean Tauros-W, and Incineroar. Since Stealth Rock is easier to fit elsewhere on a team, Spikes is the preferred entry hazard for Alolan Sandslash. Alolan Sandslash invests heavily into Special Defense to improve its ability to switch into Psychic- and Fairy-types such as Munkidori, Uxie, and Sylveon. An investment of 44 Speed EVs let it outspeed base 111s and below, like Tornadus, Alolan Ninetales, and Flygon, under snow while also getting the jump on Vaporeon and its highly contested Speed tier. Tera Water flips Alolan Sandslash's weakness to Fire-types and removes its other weaknesses. Tera Ghost does the same against Fighting-types with the additional benefit of blocking opposing Rapid Spin attempts from Pokemon like Avalugg and Brambleghast, allowing Alolan Sandslash to freely stack multiple layers of Spikes. Tera Fairy also provides a resistance to Fighting-type moves without the drawback of a weakness to Dark-type moves.</p> <p>Alolan Sandslash simultaneously sets entry hazards, removes enemy hazards, removes enemy items with Knock Off, and packs many useful resistances with its Steel typing. No other Pokemon in NU can tick all of these boxes, and thus, Alolan Sandslash is typically used to patch up balanced and defensive builds that desire a Pokemon with these traits. Since these team archetypes often rely on stacking hazards, Ghost-type teammates like Basculegion-M and Chandelure are appreciated for their ability to block Rapid Spin while also having immunities to Fighting- and Fire-type attacks. Bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Gastrodon, and Milotic can help the team's matchup against Fire-types like Incineroar and Paldean Tauros-F. Fighting-types like Toxicroak, Flamigo, and Infernape can easily destroy Alolan Sandslash with their STAB attacks; thus, it synergizes with Fighting-resistant Pokemon like Sylveon, Galarian Slowbro, and Gligar. With no means of recovering HP outside of Leftovers, Alolan Sandslash appreciates Wish support with teammates like Vaporeon, Sylveon, and Scream Tail. Due to its mediocre special bulk, pairing Alolan Sandslash with special walls like Porygon2, Incineroar, and Gastrodon can help deal with powerful wallbreakers like Chandelure, Toxtricity, and Inteleon. Sandslash's reliable hazard removal can enable Rock-weak Pokemon like Staraptor, Kilowattrel, Chandelure, and Alolan Ninetales to run offensive items instead of Heavy-Duty Boots. Alolan Ninetales in particular sets snow that boosts Alolan Sandslash's Defense and Speed while benefitting from Sandslash's Poison immunity.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Triple Axel is Alolan Sandslash's highest-power attack; Ice Spinner has improved accuracy and the ability to clear Terrains, which helps prevent Unburden sweepers from activating Grassy Seed; and Icicle Crash avoids contact effects from things like Rocky Helmet. Knock Off provides crucial coverage against Psychic- and Ghost-types like Bronzong, Uxie, and Chandelure, while Earthquake rounds out Alolan Sandslash's coverage by hitting Fire- and Steel-types like Incineroar, Paldean Tauros-F, and Klefki super effectively. Iron Head can be used to OHKO Alolan Ninetales and Diancie, even without a boost, and does significant damage to Avalugg. Rapid Spin is an option if the team lacks entry hazard removal elsewhere. Life Orb significantly increases Alolan Sandslash's wallbreaking potential, allowing Earthquake to OHKO maximum HP Incineroar from +1. Heavy-Duty Boots helps offset Alolan Sandslash's poor longevity by preventing damage from hazards while avoiding a Speed drop from Sticky Web. Tera Ground is often the best Tera type, as it simultaneously boosts the power of Earthquake and provides a Thunder Wave immunity, which is particularly helpful against Klefki. Tera Fire provides a timely Fire resistance and can give Alolan Sandslash more setup opportunities when threatened by Will-O-Wisp from Incineroar, Altaria, and Rotom-H, but it comes with the drawback of increased damage from Stealth Rock. Tera Ghost can be used for its immunity to Fighting-type moves such as Breloom's Mach Punch and Avalugg's Body Press, the latter of which grants Alolan Sandslash the ability to boost its damage further and win the one-on-one.</p> <p>As a sweeper, Alolan Sandslash is best used on offense or hyper offense teams and should always be paired with Snow Warning Alolan Ninetales to activate Slush Rush. Alolan Ninetales can also provide support with Aurora Veil, allowing Alolan Sandslash to take less damage while setting up. Teammates such as Flygon and Cinccino that draw in and force chip damage against Alolan Sandslash's counters like Paldean Tauros-W and Vaporeon are also of great importance. Cinccino also provides entry hazard removal with Tidy Up, which is very beneficial to hazard-weak snow teams. Flash Fire Chandelure also makes for great support thanks to its immunities to Fire- and Fighting-type attacks, and its Memento can provide Alolan Sandslash and its teammates with setup opportunities. Alolan Sandslash should also be paired with other sweepers like Drednaw, Toxtricity, Flygon, and Beartic, which share many of its checks like Vaporeon, Bronzong, and Swampert. Teammates like Kilowattrel, Decidueye, and Guts Hariyama are also great at handling the bulky Water-types that Alolan Sandslash can struggle with.</p>"

  "Ninetales-Alola": {
    "overview": "<p>Snow Warning, great Speed, and a solid offensive typing distinguish Alolan Ninetales in roles as a support Pokemon and fast special attacker. Thanks to all these traits, Alolan Ninetales makes a great wallbreaker against Amoonguss and Vaporeon and a solid revenge killer against Flygon and Paldean Tauros-W. Snow helps Alolan Sandslash and Beartic to sweep, and Alolan Ninetales can lean into its snow setting by using Aurora Veil to support other dangerous setup sweepers like Scyther and Toxtricity. Snow even enables Alolan Ninetales itself, granting it a Defense boost and a perfectly accurate Blizzard. Alolan Ninetales is a good user of Terastallization to wallbreak more effectively, and it can quickly overwhelm supposed counterplay like Bronzong and Diancie. Unfortunately, Alolan Ninetales is walled by prominent Steel-types like Klefki, Bronzong, and Copperajah depending on its set and coverage, curtailing its own offensive presence. Fire-types like Chandelure, Incineroar, and Paldean Tauros-F are also troublesome for Alolan Ninetales, even if some of them don't resist Fairy. Despite snow mitigating Alolan Ninetales's poor Defense, physical attackers like Basculegion-M and Flamigo still hit Alolan Ninetales hard. Alolan Ninetales's Stealth Rock weakness makes its Heavy-Duty Boots sets vulnerable to Knock Off and disincentivizes running items besides Heavy-Duty Boots.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs may seem appealing, as Blizzard and Moonblast are quite spammable, but Alolan Ninetales becomes very dependent on entry hazard control without the same payoff in power as other special wallbreakers like Chandelure, Toxtricity, and Porygon-Z have. A set of Aurora Veil / Nasty Plot / Moonblast with one of Freeze-Dry, Blizzard, Tera Blast, or Dark Pulse can be used to wallbreak for snow and setup sweepers while also allowing them to set up more easily. Life Orb can be run over Heavy-Duty Boots to give Nasty Plot Alolan Ninetales variants enough power to OHKO offensive Incineroar most of the time with +2 Moonblast.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Bronzong and Copperajah totally wall Alolan Ninetales, and Klefki has Thunder Wave to slow down Nasty Plot Alolan Ninetales. However, all Steel-types must be wary of Encore from support sets and Tera Blast Fire, Ground, and, in Bronzong's case, Ghost from Nasty Plot variants.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Incineroar and Paldean Tauros-F threaten Alolan Ninetales offensively and can stomach its Ice-type attacks. Additionally, other Fire-types like Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion can completely wall Alolan Ninetales, tanking Moonblast as well as its Ice-type attacks. However, Paldean Tauros-F needs a Choice Scarf to outspeed Nasty Plot Alolan Ninetales so that it isn't OHKOed by its +2 Moonblast, and Tera Blast Ground can handle them all very easily.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon like Alolan Muk, Porygon2, and Diancie can tank boosted attacks from Alolan Ninetales and threaten it back with strong attacks or status.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Aurora Veil Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Freeze-Dry is more threatening to prominent Water-types like Basculegion-M, Vaporeon, and Paldean Tauros-W. However, Blizzard hits more important KO thresholds, 2HKOing Cinccino, Amoonguss, and Toxtricity. Encore helps Alolan Ninetales lock passive Pokemon like Diancie and Alolan Muk into status moves, creating easier turns for setting up Aurora Veil. Foul Play can replace Moonblast to punish physical attackers like Basculegion-M, Steel-types, and Tera Steel Flygon, but it lacks Moonblast's superior coverage against Incineroar, Paldean Tauros-F, and Scrafty. Moonblast is also more important as coverage against Paldean Tauros-W if Alolan Ninetales drops Freeze-Dry for Blizzard. Icy Rock is more beneficial to teammates that rely on snow like Beartic and Alolan Sandslash, while Heavy-Duty Boots increase Alolan Ninetales's longevity in the face of entry hazards so that it can switch and set up snow more freely. Tera Water flips the Steel and Fire weaknesses into resistances, which is beneficial against Copperajah and Incineroar, and it gives Alolan Ninetales a generally good defensive typing with few weaknesses.</p> <p>Alolan Sandslash and Beartic benefit most directly from Alolan Ninetales setting snow, and both of them enjoy Aurora Veil creating safer turns to set up Swords Dance. Aurora Veil also benefits setup sweepers that prefer multiple turns to fully set up like Scyther, Toxtricity, Scream Tail, Flygon, Paldean Tauros-F, and Double Dance Porygon-Z. Cinccino can keep entry hazards out of the picture with Tidy Up so that Alolan Ninetales can run Icy Rock, and Cinccino itself benefits from Aurora Veil mitigating its meager bulk and defensive utility. Diancie, Basculegion-M, and Paldean Tauros-W can check Fire-types like Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion that threaten Alolan Ninetales. Additionally, the first one can set hazards as well. Weather Ball users like Kilowattrel and Raikou can use snow set by Alolan Ninetales to benefit their coverage. Eject Button users like Galarian Slowbro and Amoonguss help Alolan Ninetales's teammates come onto the field safely to best take advantage of Alolan Ninetales's Aurora Veil.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Freeze-Dry's better effectiveness against bulky Water-types like Milotic and Vaporeon makes Alolan Ninetales an even more devastating wallbreaker than Blizzard would, but the greater power of Blizzard overwhelms special walls like Alolan Muk, Diancie, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro. Alolan Ninetales can use Encore over an Ice-type STAB or coverage move to facilitate itself as a setup sweeper by locking passive walls like Gastrodon, Porygon2, and Avalugg into useless status moves. Nasty Plot Alolan Ninetales greatly benefits from using Terastallilzation in conjunction with Tera Blast to surprise and overwhelm its checks. Tera Blast Ground beats Steel-types like Copperajah, Fire-types like Chandelure and Incineroar, and Poison-types like Alolan Muk and Galarian Slowbro. In addition, Tera Ground protects Alolan Ninetales from Thunder Wave users like Klefki and Porygon2, and it's a good defensive answer to Poison-type attacks from Alolan Muk and Munkidori while Alolan Ninetales sets up. Tera Blast Fire has similar offensive potency against Steel-types, and it's superior to Ground defensively against otherwise super effective Steel- and Fire-type attacks, though it makes Alolan Ninetales offensively weaker against Fire-types. Tera Ghost lets Alolan Ninetales use a Ghost-type Tera Blast to blow past Bronzong and Ghost-types like Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion. It also protects Alolan Ninetales from Cinccino as well as Speed-boosted Toxtricity and Porygon-Z for a critical turn, flips its Poison weakness against foes like Munkidori, and lets it take advantage of Body Press users like Avalugg and Bronzong. Dark Pulse covers Bronzong and Chandelure, and it's Alolan Ninetales's strongest attack against Galarian Slowbro and Munkidori if it lacks Blizzard. Tera Water offers Alolan Ninetales a convenient defensive typing to deal with its usual Fire and Steel weaknesses.</p> <p>Alolan Ninetales makes for a good wallbreaker on offense and balance teams. Avalugg enjoys the Defense boost from snow, and along with walls like Cramorant and Altaria, it checks physical attackers like Flygon, Paldean Tauros-W, Infernape, and Scyther. Avalugg can also chip Steel-types like Bronzong and Copperajah and keep entry hazards off for Alolan Ninetales. Additionally, Altaria can run a Perish trap set to clear bothersome Steel- and Fire-types for Alolan Ninetales. Other hazard removers like Cinccino similarly chip Steel-types and can give Alolan Ninetales the freedom to run Life Orb. Ground-types like Flygon, Gastrodon, and Gligar can check Alolan Muk and pressure Fire-types and Steel-types besides Bronzong. Porygon2 and Incineroar are solid defensive answers to Hisuian Typhlosion and Chandelure, and the former can check Toxtricity, especially Choice Scarf variants, for Alolan Ninetales. Flygon, Fighting-types like Paldean Tauros-W, and Fire-types like Paldean Tauros-F can put the pressure on Steel-types like Klefki, Copperajah, and Bronzong so that Alolan Ninetales can finish them off late-game.</p>"

  "Vileplume": {
    "overview": "<p>Vileplume is one of the premier physical walls in the NU tier. Its Grass / Poison typing allows it to resist common Fighting- and Water-type attacks from Mienshao, Breloom, and Basculegion. Vileplume excels in punishing foes for making contact, dealing damage with Rocky Helmet and spreading status with Effect Spore. Despite being a wall, Vileplume isn't completely passive; with Giga Drain and Sludge Bomb, it can threaten serious damage on Vaporeon, Sylveon, and Avalugg, and Vileplume can potentially poison foes with the latter. Leech Seed and Strength Sap further Vileplume's longevity and weaken checks like Registeel and Alolan Muk. Special wallbreakers like Dragalge, Chandelure, and Porygon-Z can easily overwhelm Vileplume. Defensive Steel-types such as Copperajah and Klefki that resist both of Vileplume's STAB moves wall it well but risk being worn down by Leech Seed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Growth can be used over Leech Seed, allowing Vileplume to take advantage of bulkier Pokemon that can't threaten it like Alolan Muk and Brute Bonnet, but losing out on Leech Seed means Vileplume can't take on or chip away at Steel-type checks like Registeel and Klefki. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to ignore entry hazards and to decrease passivity by not needing to heal as often, but the sheer punishment of Rocky Helmet or healing of Leftovers is usually preferred. This value is often not seen long-term, as Vileplume is often tasked with taking Knock Off repeatedly.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Special wallbreakers like Chandelure, Munkidori, and Porygon-Z can all easily beat Vileplume down with their powerful super effective and even neutral attacks.</p> <p><strong>Tentacruel</strong>: Tentacruel's Liquid Ooze poses a unique threat to Vileplume, which cannot meaningfully damage it with Giga Drain or Sludge Bomb.

Effect Spore and Rocky Helmet can punish U-turn pivots like Mienshao and Flygon and other contact attackers like Paldean Tauros-W and Basculegion. Leftovers can be used to keep it from being too passive and having to heal up as often. Tera Water is used to resist Fire- and Ice-type attacks in a pinch from Chandelure, Mienshao, and Inteleon; on the other hand, Tera Fairy removes its weaknesses, notably to Fire and Psychic, while improving its matchup versus Fighting-types like Mienshao, Gallade, and Infernape.</p> <p>Defensive Steel-types like Copperajah and Registeel wall Vileplume's STAB moves, so Fighting-types like Mienshao and Gallade and Fire-types like Chandelure and Infernape pair well with it.

  "Arcanine": {
    "overview": "<p>Access to the powerful priority of Extreme Speed, the simultaneous offensive and defensive boosting of Curse, and the healing of Morning Sun solidifies Arcanine as a sweeper to be respected, capable of taking advantage of common passive foes such as Bronzong, Sylveon, Amoonguss, Klefki, and Wo-Chien as well as KOing common offensive threats like Flygon, Munkidori, and Flamigo. Additionally, Arcanine complements many sweepers such as Alolan Ninetales, Flygon, Oricorio-P, and Diancie, making it slot in easily on tons of offensive teams. Arcanine also has use throughout the course of a game, as with Intimidate, it can slow down opposing wallbreakers and sweepers, easing the burden on its teammates. However, if Arcanine wants to get past bulky Water-types like Vaporeon and Swampert, then it's forced to Terastallize and, consequently, risk a Scald burn from Vaporeon. On top of that, Arcanine often finds itself stuck between Stealth Rock and a hard place by having to choose between Leftovers + Crunch and Heavy-Duty Boots + Morning Sun; the former combination provides Arcanine coverage to nail Basculegion-M and Chandelure at the risk of being chipped heavily by entry hazards, while the latter offers reliable healing and more chances to set up during a game at the cost of being hard walled by the aforementioned Ghost-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Howl can be used over Curse to not drop Arcanine's Speed, but the bulk gained from Curse and the priority from Extreme Speed are often enough to offset this downside.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chandelure and Basculegion-M</strong>: Chandelure and Basculegion-M are immune to Extreme Speed and don't mind Flare Blitz, making them Arcanine's number one adversaries. They are also faster than it and can throw out a powerful Shadow Ball, Liquidation, or Surf. However, Arcanine can play around them with Tera Normal, and with Crunch, it has a fighting chance against them.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Vaporeon, Milotic, and Swampert are annoying for Arcanine to break through and often force it out, since they resist its Flare Blitz and, in the former two's case, can heal up as well. However, after using Curse twice and with Tera Normal, Arcanine can then net 2HKOs on both Vaporeon and Milotic while dealing great damage to Swampert.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Flygon and Gligar can throw a powerful Earthquake at Arcanine, forcing it to Terastallize, quickly KO them, or heal up constantly. However, both of these Ground-types can't handle Arcanine's Extreme Speed and Flare Blitz, respectively, too well. Rhyperior, though, can wall Arcanine quite well due to being a Rock-type, and its impressive physical bulk usually forces Arcanine to rely on teammates to weaken it beforehand.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards and Chip Damage</strong>: Due to not wanting to be walled by Chandelure and Basculegion-M, Arcanine often takes Leftovers over Heavy-Duty Boots, since the longevity offsets Crunch replacing Morning Sun in its moveset. Unfortunately, this leads to Arcanine being vulnerable to chip damage in many forms, including Stealth Rock and Spikes, and even if it carries Heavy-Duty Boots, attacks from foes it enjoys switching into such as Bronzong's Psychic Noise, Amoonguss's Sludge Bomb, and Nasty Plot Alolan Ninetales's non-Terastallized Tera Blast can weaken Arcanine too.</p>",

Crunch targets foes that stonewall Arcanine otherwise such as Basculegion-M and Chandelure. On the other hand, Morning Sun offers recovery for Arcanine, letting it use Curse repeatedly. Leftovers provides recovery to non-Morning Sun sets and is preferred on more fast-paced teams, which Arcanine often finds itself on, while Heavy-Duty Boots alleviates Arcanine's Stealth Rock weakness. Tera Normal powers up Extreme Speed to achieve rolls like OHKOing Barraskewda at +1 and foes such as Flamigo and Flygon at +2. Additionally, it lets Arcanine blank a Shadow Ball from Chandelure so that it can retaliate with a Crunch afterwards.</p> <p>Arcanine thrives on offensive teams, enjoying partners like Tornadus, Flygon, and Paldean Tauros-W with how they can weaken checks such as Diancie, Rhyperior, and Vaporeon. Grassy Terrain teams especially appreciate Arcanine, and they complement it very well; the Grassy Terrain set by Thwackey offers extra recovery to Arcanine and weakens Earthquake, while Arcanine greatly benefits common Terrain sweepers like Oricorio-P, Cinccino, Grafaiai, Torterra, and Diancie by beating Steel-types like Bronzong and Copperajah. In return, the first three sweepers weaken shared checks with Arcanine like Rhyperior, Torterra handles bulky Water-types such as Vaporeon and Swampert, and Diancie deals with Fire-types like Chandelure and Incineroar. Dual screens Klefki and Aurora Veil Alolan Ninetales pair well with Arcanine, as they both ease setup and pair well with Cinccino, which can ensure entry hazards are removed for Arcanine. Morning Sun Arcanine struggles to get past Bascluegion-M and is walled by Chandelure, so Pokemon such as Toxtricity, Overqwil, and Rhyperior all complement it very well, handling these threats for it.

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tentacruel can use Acid Spray as a way to combat bulky setup sweepers such as Scrafty and Vaporeon while still retaining a sliver of an offensive presence. Using its defensive typing and Speed boost from Rapid Spin, Tentacruel can use Swords Dance with powerful physical moves like Gunk Shot and Knock Off, even ignoring Intimidate via Clear Body. Tentacruel's other ability, Rain Dish, can let it take advantage of either the opponent's rain or find itself on a rain team.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Although Tentacruel is a Water-type, with only a weak Flip Turn in its arsenal, many Ground-types like Flygon and Swampert can safely pivot into Tentacruel and threaten to OHKO it with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Without Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots, Tentacruel has no method of recovery and will fail as a long-term pivot and entry hazard remover, making it quite reliant on its item. Even Pokemon it's meant to check like Infernape and opposing Tentacruel can dissuade Tentacruel from coming in for fear of Knock Off.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Tentacruel may want to delay using Rapid Spin if it has been hit with Leech Seed, as this will deal constant damage to the foe. Knock Off is Tentacruel's primary way of not being entirely passive, removing Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from Pokemon that can switch into it like Swampert and Klefki. Haze disrupts bulky setup sweepers. Toxic achieves a similar goal, but Tentacruel must be wary of Tera Poison and Steel commonly seen on bulky setup sweepers like Calm Mind Sylveon and Scrafty. Toxic is also useless against the many bulky Steel-types like Bronzong and Registeel using IronPress, Poison-types like Overqwil and Toxicroak, and Substitute users like Uxie and Paldean Tauros-W. Toxic Spikes make pivots into Tentacruel riskier, especially if it has previously removed Heavy-Duty Boots; however, the metagame is teeming with airborne foes, grounded Poison-types, and Heavy-Duty Boots users. Lastly, Sludge Bomb gives Tentacruel a means of dealing out any meaningful damage, letting it 2HKO Grass-types like Tsareena and Breloom that can otherwise take advantage of Tentacruel and threaten frailer offensive threats like Paldean Tauros-W and Porygon-Z. The given EV spread lets it outpace base 85 Speed Pokemon like Heracross and Overqwil, although this can be lowered to only outspeed foes with base 80 Speed and below like Chandelure, Basculegion-M, and Milotic or raised to outspeed even the likes of Porygon-Z and Hisuian Typhlosion.</p> <p>Tentacruel's ability to pivot in and out of play easily facilitates frail wallbreakers like Porygon-Z, Flamigo, and Breloom, which can take advantage of bulky Water-types that often switch in on Tentacruel like Vaporeon, Milotic, and Gastrodon. Bronzong and Orthworm pair well with Tentacruel, serving as Ground-immune and Psychic-resistant Pokemon that can set up entry hazards for Tentacruel. They also appreciate Tentacruel's Fire resistance, allowing it to check threats like Chandelure and Infernape. Offensive pivots such as Flygon and Kilowattrel are two Ground-immune Pokemon that also offer an Electric immunity for Tentacruel as well. Defensive pivots like Gligar and Incineroar form nice VoltTurn cores with Tentacruel, and their respective immense physical bulk and Intimidate compensate for Tentacruel's poor Defense. Wish users like Sylveon and Florges can keep Tentacruel healthy as it sponges Poison-type attacks for them and bothers Amoonguss.</p>"

  "Slowbro-Galar": {
    "overview": "<p>Galarian Slowbro establishes itself as a solid physical wall in NU thanks to Regenerator, letting it come in and check threats repeatedly without having to waste a turn healing. Its typing allows Galarian Slowbro to be immune to poison, allowing it to avoid Toxic from Overqwil, while letting it consistently check Fighting-types like Mienshao, Toxicroak, and Breloom. Galarian Slowbro's deep utility movepool lets it support its team by whittling away at walls like Incineroar and Diancie with Toxic or slowing down threats like Munkidori and Inteleon with Thunder Wave. It also has access to Calm Mind, which allows Galarian Slowbro to take advantage of common defensive walls like Registeel and Vileplume by making it harder to KO and switch into as well. On the other hand, it can choose to be more immediately threatening with Assault Vest, as it allows Galarian Slowbro to make use of its vast coverage, and it helps act as a blanket check to special wallbreakers such as Munkidori, Dragalge, and Porygon-Z. However, Galarian Slowbro's typing makes it weak to common Ground- and Dark-types like Flygon, Incineroar, and Alolan Muk. Galarian Slowbro is also susceptible to being KOed by repeated special hits from wallbreakers like Inteleon, Toxtricity, and Porygon-Z due to its below-average Special Defense. While Galarian Slowbro checks Fighting-types like Toxicroak and Breloom quite well, other physical wallbreakers with neutral STAB moves like Heracross, Paldean Tauros-W, and Basculegion-M can easily overpower it or force it to Terastallize.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Iron Defense + Body Press can be used to turn the tables against Dark-types like Incineroar, Scrafty, and Alolan Muk, but Galarian Slowbro is still easily forced out by special wallbreakers. Nasty Plot can be used over Calm Mind, turning it into a terrifying sweeper, but unlike Calm Mind, it forces Galarian Slowbro to switch out when it's up against special wallbreakers like Dragalge and Munkidori. Trick Room can be used on Galarian Slowbro to take advantage of its low Speed and decent Special Attack, but without a boost, it struggles to pick up KOs. Colbur Berry lets Galarian Slowbro tank any Dark-type attacks such as Incineroar's and Alolan Muk's Knock Off and Toxicroak's Dark Pulse so that it can respond with an attack afterwards, but the utility of its other items usually outweighs the benefit of using it. Eject Button allows Galarian Slowbro to become a one-time pivot, letting it safely bring in setup sweepers like Swords Dance Incineroar, Dragon Dance Flygon, and Nasty Plot Toxicroak for free. Galarian Slowbro could also opt to go itemless, as it can then wall Brambleghast and reduce Knock Off damage from Incineroar and Mienshao.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Incineroar and Bombirdier can put a lot of pressure on Galarian Slowbro with their STAB attacks, but they have to be worried about getting poisoned by Sludge Bomb when switching in. Alolan Muk is especially noteworthy for being able to switch into its STAB attacks easily without worry of being poisoned, and it can respond with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Flygon, Swampert, and Gligar can tank its Poison-type attacks and threaten Galarian Slowbro with their STAB Earthquake. However, the former two have to fear getting poisoned, and they all have to be cautious about switching into Ice Beam, Grass Knot, or Surf.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Chandelure, Hisuian Typhlosion, Decidueye, and Brambleghast can easily destroy Galarian Slowbro with their STAB attacks. However, the former two have to fear about switching into Surf, while the latter two have to worry about Sludge Bomb damage and switching into a Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Special wallbreakers like Choice Specs Meloetta and Inteleon can easily break through Galarian Slowbro and force it to switch out. Calm Mind users like Uxie and Chandelure can put a lot of pressure on Galarian Slowbro too, but they have to be mindful of getting poisoned and switching into Psyshock and Surf, respectively.</p>",

However, Psyshock can be used over Sludge Bomb, allowing Galarian Slowbro to deal with Poison-types and special walls like Toxicroak, Tentacruel, and Diancie more easily, and it also helps overwhelm opposing special setup Pokemon like Sylveon and Oricorio-G. Flamethrower allows Galarian Slowbro to hit Steel-types switching in on Sludge Bomb like Copperajah, Registeel, Bronzong, and Tera Steel Sylveon. Alternatively, Surf allows it to target Incineroar trying to blank an incoming Psyshock. Rocky Helmet punishes physical wallbreakers like Mienshao, Cinccino, and Breloom; it also pairs well with Regenerator, as it allows Galarian Slowbro to consistently switch in to rack up chip damage. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Galarian Slowbro avoid damage from entry hazards, meaning its Regenerator can't be negated, while Leftovers gives it passive recovery, minimizing the need to heal off damage with Slack Off. The EV spread lets Galarian Slowbro outpace Bronzong. Tera Water lets it handle Water-, Ground-, and Fire-types like Basculegion, Flygon, and Incineroar; however, Galarian Slowbro loses its matchup against Grass-types like Tsareena and Breloom. Tera Fairy retains the Fighting-type resistance and allows it to resist Dark-type attacks from Incineroar and Bombirdier but makes it weak to foes like Copperajah and Toxicroak.</p> <p>Galarian Slowbro pairs best with bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Swampert, and Milotic to handle Ground-types such as Flygon and Swampert; in return, Galarian Slowbro checks Grass-types like Tsareena, Breloom, and Vileplume. Dark-types like Incineroar, Bombirdier, and Scrafty synergize well with Galarian Slowbro by beating Ghost-types like Chandelure and Decidueye; in return, Galarian Slowbro handles Fighting-types like Mienshao, Toxicroak, and Breloom. Galarian Slowbro appreciates Fighting-type teammates like Toxicroak, Breloom, and Paldean Tauros-W, as they can check Dark-types like Incineroar, Bombirdier, and Alolan Muk, which threaten it. Physical wallbreakers like Flygon, Mienshao, and Infernape appreciate Galarian Slowbro's positive matchup against physically defensive walls like Milotic, Vileplume, and Avalugg. Galarian Slowbro can form a defensive backbone with special walls like Copperajah, Bronzong, and Diancie, as they can check special wallbreakers like Choice Specs Meloetta and Toxtricity, while Galarian Slowbro handles the physical wallbreakers like Breloom and Toxicroak.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Shell Side Arm is preferred over Sludge Bomb, as it will do more damage to special walls. However, Sludge Bomb can be used for its higher poison chance. Similarly, Psyshock hits special walls harder, but Psychic can be used for its raw power. Flamethrower allows it to hit Steel-types like Copperajah, Bronzong, and Klefki, while Earthquake targets Alolan Muk and Tentacruel with a trade-off of not hitting Bronzong and Orthworm. Ice Beam lets Galarian Slowbro hit Ground-types like Flygon and Gligar, while Surf targets Fire- and Rock-types like Chandelure, Talonflame, and Diancie. Grass Knot can be used as well to hit Water- and Ground-types like Swampert, Milotic, and Gastrodon more effectively. The given Speed EVs outpace Bronzong, though a spread of 180 HP / 252 SpA / 76 Spe could be run to outspeed Gastrodon if it runs Grass Knot. An alternative bulkier EV spread of 252 HP / 128 Def / 4 SpA / 96 SpD / 28 Spe can be run with a Bold nature to live a +2 Wave Crash from Paldean Tauros-W and ensure that Shell Side Arm is a special attack, but Galarian Slowbro can fail to put its coverage to great use at times if it doesn't invest heavily in its offenses. Tera Water lets Galarian Slowbro handle Fire- and Water-types like Choice Specs Chandelure and Inteleon. However, Tera Fairy retains the Fighting-type resistance while letting it handle Dark-types like Incineroar and Bombirdier.</p> <p>Bulky Water- and Grass-types like Vaporeon, Milotic, and Tsareena are great partners for Galarian Slowbro, as they can check Ground-types like Flygon and Swampert.

In return, they can handle the Ghost-types like Chandelure, Basculegion, and Hisuian Typhlosion. Galarian Slowbro's typing leaves it weak to common Knock Off users like Incineroar and Alolan Muk. Thus, it pairs well with Pokemon like Bellibolt, Swampert, and Toxicroak, as they can check the aforementioned Knock Off users. Defensive walls like Bellibolt, Sylveon, Vaporeon, and Orthworm are great partners for Galarian Slowbro, as they can check physical wallbreakers like Basculegion and Flygon. Physical wallbreakers like Life Orb Mienshao and Choice Band users such as Paldean Tauros-W and Flygon are great partners to form a wallbreaking core with Galarian Slowbro. Special walls like Bronzong, Milotic, and Incineroar can check special wallbreakers like Meloetta, Inteleon, and Chandelure, since Galarian Slowbro can't always beat them.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Swords Dance Scyther is able to fire off powerful Technician-boosted attacks with its great Attack as well as capitalize on the extra bulk it gains from Eviolite, easing setup by gifting it more opportunities. As a pivot, Scyther leverages its great Speed, which lets it outpace top threats in NU like Overqwil, Paldean Tauros-W, and Toxicroak. This quality is further enhanced by the tier's general lack of good entry hazard removal, meaning the opponent's attempts to switch around Scyther and its teammates are punished even more. Its typing is also quite helpful, since it allows Scyther to switch in on many common Pokemon like Breloom, Decidueye, and Flygon. However, Swords Dance sets not running Heavy-Duty Boots are crippled by Stealth Rock; additionally, Pokemon that Scyther switches into like Tsareena, Scrafty, and Florges carry moves like Knock Off and Trick to severely cripple it and limit its longevity. Scyther's bulk isn't the best in general, since it is 2HKOed by the secondary STAB moves and coverage moves of Pokemon it'd easily beat otherwise like Brambleghast's Poltergeist, Toxicroak's Gunk Shot, and Breloom's Rock Tomb. Contact effects like Milotic's and Galarian Slowbro's Rocky Helmet as well as Bellibolt's Static can punish Scyther's tendency to pivot with U-turn.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>On Swords Dance sets, Quick Attack can be used instead of Trailblaze, as it doesn't need to be used before facing faster threats like Kilowattrel, Inteleon, and Cinccino to be effective. Tera Normal can also be utilized, boosting Quick Attack while also granting Scyther a free turn of setup, if needed, by avoiding powerful Ghost-type attacks from Decidueye and Brambleghast. Tera Ground can be used on Scyther, since it lets Scyther take attacks from Poison-, Fire-, Rock-, and Electric-types like Galarian Slowbro, Salazzle, Diancie, and Kilowattrel; on top of that, it allows Scyther to take advantage of Tera Blast to hit the former three super effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Kilowattrel, Galvantula, and Raikou all outspeed Scyther and threaten it with their Electric-type STAB moves, while Rotom-H is slower but can take Dual Wingbeat easily and retaliate back with Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave. However, if Scyther Terastallizes into an Electric-type, it can capitalize on and beat all of them.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Copperajah, Registeel, Orthworm, and Bronzong can all take Scyther's Dual Wingbeat, and the former three can handle constant U-turns. On top of that, they can capitalize on this by setting up entry hazards and, in the latter three's case, boosting as well. Close Combat dents the former three, and the latter can't deal with repeated U-turns, though.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Incineroar, Chandelure, and Hisuian Typhlosion can all switch in and take advantage of Scyther's Defog; the latter two can also capitalize on Swords Dance, if they run Choice Scarf, as well as Close Combat. Additionally, none of them are severely punished by Scyther's U-turn if they predict poorly. However, they fail to switch into a Dual Wingbeat too well, and Incineroar hates to take Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Item Displacement</strong>: Pokemon that Scyther would normally be fine with switching into and beating one-on-one such as Scrafty, Tsareena, and Florges can carry crippling moves like Knock Off and Trick. Since these moves would remove Scyther's Heavy-Duty Boots, Scyther would take Stealth Rock damage, limiting its switch ins and ability to be an effective Defogger.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Since Close Combat nails Steel-types like Registeel, Orthworm, and Tera Steel Sylveon, it complements Dual Wingbeat almost perfectly. Trailblaze allows Scyther to boost its Speed, letting it outpace and deal with faster Pokemon such as Kilowattrel, Cinccino, and Inteleon. Since on hyper offense builds Scyther is nearly always paired with Tidy Up Cinccino to remove entry hazards, it prefers Eviolite for more setup opportunities, but Heavy-Duty Boots can be used if a team has poor hazard removal or none at all. Technician powers up Dual Wingbeat and Trailblaze to make them quite powerful and dangerous attacks. Tera Electric lets Scyther flip what would otherwise be poor matchups against Pokemon like Kilowattrel, Oricorio-F and -P, and Tornadus into setup opportunities, and it lets Scyther disregard Thunder Wave from Registeel and Prankster Klefki. Tera Grass boosts Trailblaze, letting Scyther more easily beat Diancie as well as Water-types like Vaporeon and Gastrodon. Tera Fighting turns Scyther's Rock weakness into a resistance and gifts it a boost to Close Combat to better handle Steel- and Rock-types.</p> <p>On hyper offense, whether Cinccino chooses to be a lead or setup sweeper, it is a near-essential partner for Eviolite Scyther; Cinccino can remove entry hazards with Tidy Up and weaken as well as possibly take advantage of Scyther's checks like Bronzong, Gligar, and Diancie. Other hazard-removing and -denying leads like Rapid Spin Brambleghast and Taunt Lycanroc are appreciated as well, letting Scyther freely run Eviolite. Alolan Ninetales is a fantastic partner, since it can set up Aurora Veil to aid setup for Scyther. Steel-types like Registeel, Orthworm, and Bronzong are one of Scyther's biggest roadblocks, so Pokemon that can beat them outright like Paldean Tauros-W and -F, Flygon, Infernape, and Chandelure make for great partners. Toxtricity, Uxie, Porygon-Z, Calm Mind Scream Tail, and Diancie work well too, as they can work alongside Scyther to overwhelm the same Steel-types instead. Blanket physical walls such as Galarian Slowbro, Scream Tail, Gligar, and Milotic can be annoying to get past for Scyther, making teammates like Chandelure, Munkidori, Inteleon, Porygon-Z, and Toxtricity pair well. Cinccino, Porygon-Z, Incineroar, and Overqwil draw in Fighting- and Ground-types like Breloom, Flamigo, and Flygon that Scyther can take advantage of after they get KOed. Incineroar is quite a bothersome foe for Scyther, so it enjoys teammates that can weaken Incineroar, like Decidueye, Overqwil, and Salazzle, and ones that take it out completely, such as Paldean Tauros-W and -F, Infernape, and Flygon.</p>"

Close Combat targets the Steel-types that resist and try to switch into Scyther's STAB moves. Swords Dance allows Scyther to take advantage of a free turn, and it lets Scyther better break through more defensive teams. However, either Close Combat or Swords Dance can be replaced with Defog so that Scyther can provide its team with some much-needed entry hazard removal, since Defog is uncommon to come by. Tera Electric lets Scyther capitalize on would-be bad matchups against Kilowattrel, Tornadus, and Oricorio-P and -F, as well as gifting it an immunity to Scream Tail's and Prankster Klefki's Thunder Wave. However, Tera Steel provides Scyther with many resistances, letting it take attacks like Cinccino's Tail Slap, Inteleon's Ice Beam, and Munkidori's Sludge Wave. Tera Fighting powers up Scyther's Close Combat and makes its Rock weakness a resistance, helping it out when it pivots into Stealth Rock if it's already lost its Heavy-Duty Boots, though.</p> <p>Steel-types such as Bronzong, Registeel, and Orthworm try to take advantage of Scyther using its STAB attacks, so partners like Chandelure, Flygon, and Paldean Tauros-F pair extremely well. In a similar vein, Fire-types like Incineroar, Chandelure, and Hisuian Typhlosion often switch into Scyther, trying to capitalize on its U-turn and, in the latter two's case, its Close Combat as well. Because of this, switch-ins to these Pokemon like Milotic, Incineroar, and Goodra are greatly appreciated. Gastrodon is an especially noteworthy partner, as it provides a switch-in to Steel- and Fire-types, handles Kilowattrel, a common Scyther check, and sets entry hazards, which complements Scyther's pivoting quite well. Other hazard setters that can achieve the same thing such as Bronzong, Diancie, Swampert, and Gligar work just as well. While Scyther can take attacks from Fighting- and Ground-types such as Breloom, Paldean Tauros-W, and Flygon, it is quite a poor check due to its frailty, so more solid or secondary checks like Sylveon, Galarian Slowbro, Amoonguss, and Whimsicott are great partners. Rotom-H, Flygon, and Munkidori work well as teammates; Rotom-H can switch into Ground-type attacks and take care of Water-types; Flygon appreciates how Scyther threatens Grass-types like Tsareena and Whimsicott and can provide it with a way to handle Fire-and Steel-types; Munkidori can spread poison to weaken checks like Diancie, Incineroar, and Vaporeon and remove Poison-types like Galarian Slowbro and Tera Poison Sylveon. Scyther often finds itself pivoting out against physical walls like Galarian Slowbro, Bellibolt, and Gligar, making wallbreakers such as Hisuian Typhlosion, Toxtricity, and Inteleon good teammates.</p>"

Paldean Tauros-F poses as a wallbreaker with strong STAB attacks that are hard to switch around. It can also use Bulk Up to increase its power and bulk, making it harder to revenge kill with physical attackers. Its Speed tier gives it an edge over common wallbreakers such as Porygon-Z, Toxtricity, and Chandelure, letting it revenge kill them if needed. Not only is it an offensive threat, it has great defensive merits, too. Its Fire typing gives it a useful immunity to Will-O-Wisp from Incineroar, Houndstone, and opposing Paldean Tauros-F; meanwhile, Intimidate gives it more opportunities to switch in against physical wallbreakers like Toxicroak, Decidueye, and Breloom. On the flip side, Paldean Tauros-F has poor Special Defense, which, when paired with its typing, lets it be easily revenge killed by faster Pokemon like Munkidori, Kilowattrel, and Inteleon, all of which can force it to Terastallize. Paldean Tauros-F is heavily threatened by bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Milotic, and Gastrodon, all of which can use Tera Poison or Tera Fairy to tank Close Combat. It also faces competition with Paldean Tauros-W, which has a better typing while being easier to fit on teams. Wallbreakers like Chandelure and Basculegion-M as well as walls like Altaria are able to take advantage of Paldean Tauros-F's STAB attacks easily, giving them free turns to set up or use Defog, respectively.</p>",

Bulk Up sets can run Substitute; however, it has no way of dealing damage to Chandelure unless it wants to give up one of its STAB attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Scyther, Kilowattrel, Oricorio-P, and Oricorio-F threaten Paldean Tauros-F with their STAB moves, and the last two can often use it as an opportunity to set up. The first three don't enjoy switching into its Fire-type attacks, however, and Oricorio-F is OHKOed by Stone Edge. Altaria resists both of Paldean Tauros-F's STAB attacks and is only hit hard by Stone Edge while threatening it back with Brave Bird. Gligar resists Close Combat and doesn't take much damage from Paldean Tauros-F's Fire-type attacks; while it does hit it hard with Earthquake, it does not want to be hit by Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Paldean Tauros-F is heavily checked by defensive Water-types like Vaporeon, Milotic, and Gastrodon; the only one that it threatens to 2HKO is specially defensive Gastrodon.

Trailblaze gives it the opportunity outspeed faster threats like Inteleon, Kilowatrel, and Scyther. Earthquake lets Paldean Tauros-F deal with Poison-type foes like Alolan Muk and Overqwil as well as one of its best checks in Chandelure. Will-O-Wisp can be used to weaken Pokemon like Toxicroak, Basculegion-M, and Copperajah so that Paldean-Tauros-F can set up on them for free, but Will-O-Wisp gets rid of its only way of dealing damage to Chandelure. Leftovers recuperates any health lost from Flare Blitz's recoil and gives Paldean Tauros-F some longevity, while Heavy-Duty Boots enables it to repeatedly switch in without worrying about entry hazards. Tera Grass turns its Ground- and Water-type weaknesses into resistances while simultaneously boosting Trailblaze's power, giving it the chance to OHKO Gastrodon and 2HKO Swampert. Tera Electric is useful for its defensive merits such as the resistances to Kilowattrel's STAB attacks as well as Air Slash from Oricorio-P and Oricorio-F; it also gives it an immunity to Klefki's Thunder Wave. Tera Steel gives Paldean Tauros-F a favorable matchup against Munkidori while also letting it resist Flying-type moves from the aforementioned Kilowattrel and Oricorio formes.</p> <p>Paldean Tauros-F enjoys being put on hyper offense and balance teams that take advantage of both its offensive prowess and defensive utility.

In return, these aforementioned Pokemon threaten Poison-types that Paldean Tauros-F struggles with, like Galarian Slowbro, Tentacruel, and Tera Poison Vaporeon. Paldean Tauros-F also struggles with physically defensive Flying-types like Gligar, Altaria, and Galarian Articuno, which lets it pair well with Ice Beam users such as Porygon2, Vaporeon, and Milotic, as well as Diancie.

Dark- and bulky Normal-types like Incineroar, Alolan Muk, Porygon2, and Dudunsparce pressure Ghost-types like Chandelure, Hisuian Typhlosion, and special attacking Basculegion-M. Dudunsparce and Porygon2 along with Klefki and Amoonguss can inflict paralysis on faster Pokemon like Munkidori, Inteleon, and Choice Scarf Porygon-Z and Paldean Tauros-W, letting Paldean Tauros-F outspeed them and not worry about needing to use Trailblaze.

On the other hand, Choice Scarf enables it as a fast revenge killer, outspeeding the likes of Inteleon, Kilowattrel, and Flygon. Raging Bull should only be considered on Choice Band variants due to the extra power given by the item, as Choice Scarf sets need the extra power from Flare Blitz. Earthquake aims to take down Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion, which resist or are immune to both of Paldean Tauros-F's STAB attacks, as well as Poison-types like Alolan Muk, Overqwil, and Tera Poison Gastrodon. Stone Edge gives Paldean Tauros-F an edge over Flying-types like Scyther, Altaria, and Galarian Articuno. Wild Charge targets the aforementioned Flying-types as well as Water-types like Vaporeon and Milotic. Tera Fighting boosts the power of Close Combat, making it harder to switch into Paldean Tauros-F. Other Tera types like Electric and Steel can be used for their defensive traits like resisting Flying-type moves as well as Psychic-type moves for the latter.</p> <p>These sets fit best on balance and offensive teams that require a strong wallbreaker to beat Steel-types. Diancie, Munkidori, and Cinccino all appreciate Paldean Tauros-F's ability to threaten Steel-types like Bronzong, Copperajah, and Klefki. Choice Scarf Paldean Tauros-F enjoys Spikes from users like Diancie, Gastrodon, and Gligar to apply more pressure on checks like Vaporeon, Gastrodon, and Tera Water Amoonguss. Choice Band variants enjoy the presence of Choice Scarf users like Flygon, Munkidori, and Porygon-Z to take down faster foes like Munkidori, Scream Tail, and Choice Scarf Chandelure. Kilowattrel pairs especially well with Paldean Tauros-F thanks to its solid matchup against Water- and Flying-types like Vaporeon, Paldean Tauros-W, and Scyther; in return, Paldean Tauros-F can take down Gastrodon, Incineroar, and Bronzong. Wish passers like Vaporeon and Sylveon work well alongside Paldean Tauros-F to alleviate any residual damage from entry hazards and recoil from Flare Blitz. Water-types tend to be a thorn in Paldean Tauros-F's side, so Pokemon like Flygon and Scyther that can weaken them over a battle fit well alongside it. Paldean Tauros-F appreciates the presence of a Steel-type to pivot into its checks, whether it's Bronzong for handling Munkidori and Flygon, Copperajah helping with Kilowattrel and Galarian Articuno, or Klefki laying Spikes and switching into Scyther and Galarian Slowbro. Dark-types like Incineroar and Alolan Muk help beat down Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion, while Wo-Chien targets Basculegion-M. Grassy Terrain teams enjoy the utility of Paldean Tauros-F, using it as a safe pivot to weaken Pokemon like Incineroar and Flygon that threaten Oricorio-P and Grafaiai. Paldean Tauros-F appreciates Avalugg, Scyther, and Altaria to remove any hazards so that it can switch in more. Future Sight users like Galarian Articuno love partnering with Paldean Tauros-F because it threatens any potential switch-ins to Future Sight like Bronzong, Copperajah, Incineroar, and Alolan Muk.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Paldean Tauros-W splashes its way to the top of the tier as one of the best wallbreakers thanks to its strong STAB attacks boosted with Choice Band or Bulk Up, good Speed tier, and great matchup against top threats like Flygon and Incineroar. With a Choice Band, it threatens common physical walls like Swampert, Galarian Slowbro, and Bellibolt. Alternatively, it can choose to set up with Bulk Up, which prevents physical revenge killers from trying to stop it. Not only does it have a good Speed tier, outspeeding wallbreakers like Porygon-Z, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Toxicroak, but it has a strong priority option in Aqua Jet to beat weakened, faster foes like Kilowattrel and Cinccino. However, it can be easy to take advantage of. If it is Choice Band, then Pokemon immune to Water like Vaporeon or Toxicroak as well as Ghost-types like Chandelure can switch in and punish it. Other foes that resist its STAB moves like Galarian Slowbro and Vileplume use Rocky Helmet to punish its use of contact moves; the latter can punish it further due to Effect Spore. Vileplume is able to hard wall Bulk Up variants, stopping any attempt to set up or forcing the use of Tera. Its Speed tier is good, but not good enough, as some wallbreakers like Kilowattrel, Tornadus, and Munkidori outspeed and revenge it with ease.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Iron Head can be used as an option to hit Tera Fairy Vaporeon, but that's its only target because Wave Crash hits the other Fairy-types for more damage. Trailblaze can be paired with Bulk Up to outspeed would-be faster Pokemon like Kilowattrel and Choice Scarf Porygon-Z.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Vileplume is a hard counter, resisting both of its STAB attacks and only ever getting 2HKOed by Choice Band Zen Headbutt. Defensive Brambleghast can be problematic due to its immunity to Fighting-type moves and Water resistance; that in combination with Strength Sap can wall Paldean Tauros-W. Choice Scarf users like Rotom-C and Tsareena can revenge kill it while resisting its Water-type moves. Decidueye resists Wave Crash and is immune to Close Combat, letting it switch in and set up at no cost.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Bulky Psychic-types like Cresselia and Galarian Slowbro can tank any of Paldean Tauros-W's hits and threaten it in return. Others like Munkidori and Espeon outspeed it and threaten to KO or force the use of Tera Steel.</p> <p><strong>Water-immune and -resistant Pokemon</strong>: Vaporeon and Gastrodon are both immune to Wave Crash and Raging Bull and can use Tera Fairy to resist Close Combat. Vaporeon and Milotic can use Scald to burn it. Toxicroak is immune to its Water-type moves and resists Close Combat, often giving it a free turn to set up. Tera Water Galarian Slowbro is hardly threatened by Paldean Tauros-W, and it can hit it back with a super effective Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Some of Paldean Tauros-W's most common checks, like Vileplume, Galarian Slowbro, and Houndstone, tend to use Rocky Helmet, punishing it for simply attacking. On top of that, one of its main STAB attacks inflicts recoil damage, which adds up over any given match. This also leads into it having a poor matchup against Talonflame, Vileplume, and Bellibolt, which all have abilities that can status it on contact.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band turns Paldean Tauros-W into a powerful wallbreaker with its high-Base Power STAB attacks, letting it 2HKO slower Water- or Fighting-resistant Pokemon like Brambleghast and Choice Specs Sylveon. Choice Band also takes advantage of Aqua Jet's priority to revenge kill faster threats like Kilowattrel, Munkidori, and Choice Scarf Chandelure. Choice Scarf allows it to use Raging Bull instead of Aqua Jet, giving it another Water-type STAB move that doesn't have recoil damage. Zen Headbutt allows it to 2HKO Vileplume, while Earthquake is more accurate and has higher damage against other Poison-types like Galarian Slowbro and Dragalge. Choice Scarf enables Paldean Tauros-W to turn into a revenge killer, outspeeding and KOing threats like Inteleon, Munkidori, and Kilowattrel. Tera Water pushes Wave Crash's damage through the roof, opening room for new 2HKOs on Pokemon like Cresselia, defensive Brambleghast, and Bellibolt. Tera Fighting buffs Close Combat, enabling it to OHKO Klefki and, after some prior chip damage, Diancie and Vaporeon.</p> <p>Psychic- and Fairy-types like Cresselia, Munkidori, and Sylveon all heavily threaten Paldean Tauros-W with their super effective STAB attacks while being able to tank its Close Combat. This opens room for Steel-types and certain special walls like Bronzong, Registeel, and Incineroar; in return, Paldean Tauros-W helps deal with Fire- and Ground-types, like Chandelure, Flygon, and Swampert, that hinder those Pokemon. Ground-types like Flygon, Swampert, and Gastrodon take advantage of Electric-types like Kilowattrel, Bellibolt, and Rotom-C, which can all KO Paldean Tauros-W with ease. Due to its struggles with taking on common physical walls like Vileplume, Galarian Slowbro, and Tera Poison Avalugg, special wallbreakers like Munkidori, Porygon-Z, and Hisuian Typhlosion make for great partners. Due to recoil damage, Rocky Helmet, and entry hazards, it appreciates Wish support from Pokemon like Sylveon and Florges as well as Lunar Dance from Choice Scarf Cresselia. Vaporeon and Toxicroak are both checks to it due to their Water immunity; this opens up room for certain Pokemon like Rotom-C and Kilowattrel. Galarian Articuno in particular forms a core with it thanks to Future Sight and U-turn to pressure Vileplume and other Pokemon that switch into Paldean Tauros-W; in return, Paldean Tauros-W helps defeat any Steel- and Dark-types that Galarian Articuno loses to.</p>"

      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Raging Bull can be used over Wave Crash as a strong option if Paldean Tauros-W is not using Leftovers to help mitigate recoil damage. Aqua Jet gives it a form of strong priority, making revenge killing it with Kilowattrel and Munkidori much harder. Zen Headbutt helps to hit Poison-types like Vileplume, Toxicroak, and Dragalge. Substitute can be used instead for longevity, pairing well with Tera Steel to become immune to status and Vileplume's Leech Seed. Leftovers gives it some form of longevity while setting up and lets it regain some HP lost due to Wave Crash's recoil. Lum Berry grants it a one-time immunity to any status it may obtain from the likes of Talonflame's Flame Body and Vileplume's Effect Spore. Tera Steel grants useful resistances to Fairy-, Psychic-, Flying-, and Grass-type attacks that Paldean Tauros-W is otherwise weak to, while Tera Electric lets it wall and take advantage of Kilowattrel, disregard Thunder Wave, and take Flying-type attacks from Oricorio formes and Tornadus. Alternatively, Tera Water boosts the damage of Wave Crash and Raging Bull, though it doesn't offer much defensive utility.</p> <p>This set excels when partnered with other setup sweepers on a hyper offense team, such as Flygon, Chandelure, and Incineroar; they all appreciate having Galvantula as a lead to lay Sticky Web on the opposing side, slowing down any faster Pokemon. Froslass, Brambleghast, and Iron Thorns are other good leads for these teams, using Spikes to wear down already unstable checks. Despite that, Paldean Tauros-W isn't a one-trick pony, being a staple on some balance builds, especially when paired with Flygon. It helps beat some of Flygon's checks such as Bronzong, Orthworm, and Choice Scarf Cresselia; simultaneously, Flygon pressures Paldean Tauros-W's checks like Galarian Slowbro, Toxicroak, and Vileplume. It appreciates Steel-types like Bronzong, Registeel, and Klefki to tank any Psychic- and Fairy-type attacks coming its way. Flygon, Swampert, and Volt Absorb Kilowattrel do a great job at punishing any Electric-types trying to revenge it like opposing Kilowattrel and Choice Scarf Rotom-C. It appreciates help from Pokemon like Munkidori and Meloetta to threaten Vileplume, Galarian Slowbro, and Houndstone; Paldean Tauros-W, in return, alleviates pressure from Dark-types like Incineroar, Alolan Muk, and Umbreon.</p>"

      "Among Us (Imposter)": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Ditto distinguishes itself with the entirely unique combination of Imposter + Choice Scarf. Ditto's ability enables it to morph into a revenge killer with great potential to reverse sweep teams with the boosts it copies, so it deters setup sweepers like Flygon, Cinccino, Munkidori, Paldean Tauros-W, Toxtricity, and Scyther. Maximum physical bulk and minimum Speed help Ditto to trigger an opposing Ditto's Imposter first and PP stall it. Tera Steel helps Ditto against Cinccino, Flygon, Alolan Ninetales, and Oricorio-P, and it can turn the tables for Ditto in risky Speed ties against Choice Scarf variants of Flamigo and Porygon-Z. Lessened damage from Stealth Rock and a Toxic Spikes immunity are also nice perks from Tera Steel. Tera Fairy provides Ditto a neat defensive typing with helpful Dark, Bug, and Fighting resistances to better stomach priority moves like Sucker Punch, First Impression, Mach Punch, and Vacuum Wave. The Normal and Fighting immunities from Tera Ghost help Ditto against Cincinno and Porygon-Z, Paldean Tauros-W and other Fighting-types, and bulky Body Press sweepers like Bronzong.</p> <p>Ditto is a good filler option for teams in need of an emergency answer to setup sweepers, and most teams can appreciate Ditto's ability to check weather teams by copying Speed-boosting weather abilities like Swift Swim, Slush Rush, and Chlorophyll. Stall teams can rely on Ditto as an anti-setup option that provides opportunities they'd otherwise lack for reverse sweeping. Offensive teams can worry less about fitting defensive counterplay for major offensive threats by running Ditto, and Ditto itself can work as a wincon if it copies a setup sweeper. Balance teams appreciate Ditto's ability to deter offensive setup sweepers, and they have the defensive backbone necessary to compensate for Ditto needing to switch out after being locked into a move by Choice Scarf. The virtually infinite PP Ditto can bring with Imposter helps in matchups against stall teams, and it can use Imposter to copy abilities like Regenerator from Amoonguss and Natural Cure from Altaria. Imposter's ability to overwrite the Speed drop from Sticky Web and copy Speed-boosting weather abilities helps Ditto out against hyper offense teams, lessening the strain Cinccino and other fast threats like Choice Scarf Flygon are under to answer these teams. However, Ditto itself can be surprised by Terastallization from threats like Flygon and Scyther, so it relies on secondary checks to setup sweepers. Scream Tail can disrupt setup sweepers with its fast Encore, while Ditto exploits threats that continue to try and boost against it, such as Oricorio-P.</p>"

  "Vaporeon": {
    "overview": "<p>Vaporeon's typing and good defenses let it check common physical attackers like Paldean Tauros-W, Incineroar, and Flygon, and Water Absorb makes it one of the best answers to opposing Water-types like Inteleon and Basculegion-M. Compared to other physically bulky Water-types like Swampert and Quagsire, Vaporeon excels due to its access to reliable recovery in Wish and its ability to pivot and potentially pass Wish to its teammates with Flip Turn. Vaporeon can also run Haze, which allows it to check bulky setup sweepers like Calm Mind Cresselia and Iron Defense Registeel. However, more powerful or more aggressively boosting foes, such as Swords Dance Mienshao and Nasty Plot Munkidori, can overwhelm Vaporeon. Additionally, while Vaporeon can be a great blanket check to certain physical and special attackers, it can be easily overwhelmed at times by either how many it has to check in a battle or their sheer power. Grass- and Electric-type attackers, such as Poison Heal Breloom, Brambleghast, and Kilowattrel, are quite common as well and easily force Vaporeon out.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>As an alternative to Haze, Vaporeon can utilize Roar to phaze opposing setup sweepers. Calm Mind can be used on Vaporeon to let it take advantage of forced switches and passive Pokemon, usually alongside Ice Beam to make progress against Toxicroak and Grass-types like Vileplume. However, this set is still walled by opposing Water-types. Tera Fairy can be used to resist Fighting- and Dragon-type attacks, and Tera Ghost can be used to completely wall Paldean Tauros-W.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Vaporeon is weak to common Grass-type attackers such as Brambleghast, Technician Breloom, and Tsareena. However, all of these hate switching into a Scald burn. Grass-type coverage, like Chandelure's Energy Ball and Tera Grass Paldean Tauros-F's Trailblaze, can also be threatening.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-type attackers like Kilowattrel and Iron Thorns force Vaporeon out, and they can take advantage of this by gaining momentum or setting up.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Strong special attackers, such as Porygon-Z, Chandelure, and Dragalge, scare out Vaporeon, and the first two have Trick to cripple it.</p> <p><strong>Water-immune Pokemon</strong>: As Vaporeon only runs Water-type attacks, it cannot actually damage opposing Water-immune Pokemon. Most prominently, Toxicroak can set up on Vaporeon or throw out powerful attacks, Gastrodon can set entry hazards, and opposing Vaporeon are untouchable.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wish Passer": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Flip Turn allows Vaporeon to pivot in teammates for free and more easily pass Wish. Alternatively, Haze gives Vaporeon an option to prevent opposing setup sweepers like Calm Mind Cresselia and Iron Defense Registeel from boosting out of control. Leftovers gives Vaporeon additional healing, particularly in combination with Protect to gain free turns to heal. However, Heavy-Duty Boots allows Vaporeon to pivot more frequently without concern for entry hazard chip damage. Tera Poison gives Vaporeon a resistance to Fighting- and Grass-type attacks from common physical attackers such as Mienshao, Breloom, and Brambleghast, as well as an immunity to being poisoned by Umbreon's Toxic. Tera Dark, on the other hand, allows Vaporeon to temporarily check Stored Power sweepers like Bronzong and Cresselia if it doesn't have Haze, as well as Choice Band Tera Blast Ghost Basculegion, which would 2HKO it otherwise.</p> <p>Vaporeon benefits from teammates that can take powerful special attacks from foes like Chandelure, Porygon-Z, and Munkidori, so special walls like Incineroar, Bronzong, and Assault Vest Alolan Muk support it well. These teammates also benefit from Wish being passed to them, as they lack reliable recovery. A backup physical wall such as Sylveon or Vileplume is useful to ensure Vaporeon isn't overwhelmed by Ground- and Fighting-types like Flygon and Mienshao. On non-Heavy-Duty Boots sets, entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Talonflame, Tsareena, and Brambleghast is vital to ensure Vaporeon doesn't become excessively passive by being forced to heal each time it comes out. Powerful wallbreakers such as Mienshao, Flygon, and Chandelure benefit from Wish and Flip Turn support from Vaporeon, allowing them to repeatedly switch in and break opposing walls.</p>"

  "Articuno-Galar": {
    "overview": "<p>Galarian Articuno's main draw is its high Special Attack and good matchup into threats like Flamigo, Toxicroak, and Amoonguss. Its ability, Competitive, also makes it very attractive, since stat-dropping moves and abilities like Brambleghast's Strength Sap as well as Paldean Tauros-W's and Incineroar's Intimidate are commonplace. Additionally, Galarian Articuno is one of the few viable Future Sight users, combining very well with NU's many Fighting-type wallbreakers like Heracross, Flamigo, Infernape, and Paldean Tauros-W. However, Steel- and Dark-types like Registeel, Bronzong, and Alolan Muk being everywhere holds it back. Not only that, but Galarian Articuno is also forced to compete with Oricorio-P and -F. Unlike Galarian Articuno, these Oricorio formes have access to Quiver Dance and Taunt as well as Revelation Dance, which is useful before Terastallization unlike the Tera Blast that Galarian Articuno is forced to use. Galarian Articuno's Speed and defensive profile can be disappointing at times as well, since Pokemon such as Staraptor, Flygon, and the Paldean Tauros formes can easily outpace it whereas Basculegion-M's Aqua Jet, Decidueye's Shadow Sneak, and Toxicroak's Sucker Punch all threaten to deal great damage to it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shadow Ball can be run on Calm Mind sets to hit Bronzong, but it's nearly useless outside of that matchup.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Bronzong, Registeel, Copperajah, Klefki, and Duraludon can all check Galarian Articuno. Additionally, they can use it to set up their entry hazards; Bronzong, Registeel, and Duraludon can boost their stats; and Klefki as well as Duraludon can paralyze it. However, Registeel, Copperajah, and Duraludon have to be cautious of Tera Blast Fighting.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Incineroar and Alolan Muk can take Galarian Articuno's Psychic-type STAB moves, but the former needs to worry about its Intimidate activating Competitive and, consequently, boosting Hurricane. Additionally, while Overqwil and Dragon Dance Scrafty don't take Hurricane too well, they can outspeed and threaten Galarian Articuno with Throat Chop and Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: While Kilowattrel, Raikou, and Toxtricity don't switch into Galarian Articuno's Psychic-type STAB attacks too well, the former two outspeed it, and they all threaten it with huge damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>On more balanced teams, Galarian Articuno prefers a moveset of Calm Mind / Recover / Hurricane or Air Slash / Freezing Glare. However, on more offensive or hyper offense builds, it can opt for other moves like Agility, Tera Blast, and Stored Power. Recover allows Galarian Articuno to repeatedly set up throughout the course of a match, letting it wear down walls like Bronzong. Hurricane hits Dark-types like Alolan Muk and Scrafty, and it's especially strong against Incineroar due to Intimidate activating Galarian Articuno's Competitive. Alternatively, Air Slash can be run for its higher accuracy. Freezing Glare is a decently powered Psychic-type STAB move with no drawback, while Stored Power aims to capitalize on Agility compounding with Calm Mind boosts. Psychic Noise can be used on balanced builds so that Galarian Articuno aids its team in breaking through walls like Gastrodon, Porygon2, and Milotic, denying them from healing, though it can be weak at times. Additionally, Psyshock can be used to aid in Calm Mind wars with Sylveon and Scream Tail. Tera Blast Fairy lets Galarian Articuno hit Dark-types like Scrafty more reliably than Hurricane, though many of them like Incineroar and Alolan Muk are still hit neutrally by it. However, in general, Tera Fairy offers Galarian Articuno a solid defensive typing that helps it against most of the tier's threats like Heracross, Flygon, and Incineroar. On the other hand, Tera Fighting trades off defensive capability, only helping Galarian Articuno with taking Knock Off from Incineroar and Copperajah, for offensive prowess, since Tera Blast Fighting lets it hit both the Dark- and Steel-types that resist its Psychic-type STAB move like Incineroar and Registeel. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Galarian Articuno to constantly come in on and threaten Pokemon like Tentacruel, Amoonguss, and Breloom regardless of entry hazards. Alternatively, Galarian Articuno can go for Grassy Seed on Grassy Terrain teams to ease setup opportunities. Weakness Policy can also be run to boost Stored Power's Base Power quickly. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 Spe can be run on Galarian Articuno sets that aim to gain many boosts, especially aiding ones that carry Agility, Stored Power, Grassy Seed, and Weakness Policy. Tera Steel offers Galarian Articuno an incredible defensive typing, which helps with taking powerful attacks like Alolan Ninetales's Blizzard, Diancie's Meteor Beam, and Flygon's Dragon-type STAB attacks.</p> <p>Hyper offense teams can best support Weakness Policy Galarian Articuno with Cinccino, especially lead sets of Cinccino to ensure entry hazards are removed, and Aurora Veil from Alolan Ninetales, which lets Galarian Articuno better withstand super effective attacks to activate its Weakness Policy. In return, Galarian Articuno's Competitive deters Defog, ensuring Aurora Veil stays up. On these teams, Galarian Articuno appreciates teammates like Porygon-Z, Toxtricity, Flygon, and Paldean Tauros formes to weaken or outright KO Steel-types like Bronzong, Registeel, and Duraludon for it. Similarly, more balanced teams can take advantage of partners like Chandelure, Heracross, and Flygon for their ability to threaten these Steel-types. For Grassy Seed Galarian Articuno sets, Thwackey is a vital teammate to set Grassy Terrain. Additionally, other Terrain sweepers that can take advantage of Grassy Terrain like Grafaiai, Diancie, Oricorio-F, and Hitmonlee synergize well, as the first two can overwhelm Steel-types alongside Galarian Articuno, while the latter two can beat them outright. Dark-types such as Incineroar, Alolan Muk, and Scrafty can be problematic for Galarian Articuno to deal with, making Pokemon like Paldean Tauros-W, Heracross, and Sylveon good partners. On top of that, these Pokemon can also act as good Knock Off switch-ins. In return, Galarian Articuno handles pesky Poison-types like Amoonguss and Galarian Slowbro for them.</p>"

Tera Ground lets Galarian Articuno become immune to Kilowattrel's Electric-type attacks and resist Diancie's Rock-type STAB moves.</p> <p>Future Sight Galarian Articuno is best paired alongside wallbreakers like Paldean Tauros-W, Infernape, Heracross, and Flygon, since they can capitalize on it drawing in and pivoting on Steel- and Dark-types as well as specially defensive blanket checks like Incineroar, Bronzong, Registeel, and Porygon2 with its U-turn. On top of that, Galarian Articuno's Future Sight dissuades Poison-types like Galarian Slowbro and Amoonguss from switching in. Similarly, Fairy-type wallbreakers like Alolan Ninetales, Sylveon, and Diancie can take advantage of Galarian Articuno drawing in and pivoting on Dark-types with its U-turn and discouraging Poison-types from switching in with its Future Sight. Additionally, together they can work to wear down shared Steel-type checks. Knock Off switch-ins are vital for Galarian Articuno, since it is both weak to the move and vulnerable to Stealth Rock. Because of this, Pokemon like Diancie, Paldean Tauros-W, and Overqwil make for good teammates. Bulky Psychic-types like Galarian Slowbro, Uxie, and Scream Tail can be difficult for Galarian Articuno and, at times, the wallbreakers it's paired with to break through, so Galarian Articuno pairs well with Pokemon such as Incineroar, Decidueye, and specially oriented Substitute Basculegion-M.</p>"

Good Speed further distinguishes Hisuian Typhlosion, giving it an advantage over wallbreakers like Breloom, Heracross, and Chandelure. However, the power of Hisuian Typhlosion's Eruption completely depends on it being healthy, either restricting it to running Heavy-Duty Boots or mandating tight entry hazard control. Hisuian Typhlosion may be fast for a wallbreaker, but common faster threats like Flygon, Inteleon, and Paldean Tauros-W all handily outspeed and OHKO Hisuian Typhlosion given its fragility, and all of them have Choice Scarf sets to match Hisuian Typhlosion's own Choice Scarf set. In addition, priority users like the aforementioned Paldean Tauros-W, Basculegion, and Toxicroak threaten to diminish Hisuian Typhlosion's strongest move if they don't outright KO it. Incineroar is a particularly troublesome and common check, forcing Hisuian Typhlosion to risk missing with Focus Blast and making it easily intercepted afterward by any specially defensive Fire-resistant Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hisuian Typhlosion can run Solar Beam over Focus Blast on sun teams for a powerful coverage move against bulky Water- and Ground-types, but this leaves it defenseless against Incineroar. Choice Specs sets are nearly impossible for anything but the bulkiest Fire-resistant Pokemon to withstand, though this comes at the cost of Hisuian Typhlosion becoming vulnerable to revenge killers like Inteleon and Scyther. Hisuian Typhlosion lacks the capacity to use Infernal Parade effectively, as its fragility means it struggles to stay on the field long enough to spread burns. Blaze gives Flamethrower and Fire Blast a surge in power once Hisuian Typhlosion has been worn into range of activation; however, it should avoid being put into range of Blaze if possible, as it's most effective when using Eruption. Tera Blast in conjunction with a Grass Tera Type could let Hisuian Typhlosion surprise and overwhelm bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Gastrodon, Swampert, and Milotic. However, Hisuian Typhlosion struggles to capitalize on Terastallization well or fit Tera Blast over any of its other moves, and running it often means depriving other teammates of a valuable resource.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Fire-Resistant Pokemon</strong>: Resisting Eruption, boasting solid special bulk, and setting Stealth Rock make Diancie a pain for Hisuian Typhlosion to beat without repeated opportunities to wear it down. Vaporeon, Milotic, and Gastrodon can wall Hisuian Typhlosion thanks to their recovery moves. Dragalge, Tentacruel, Swampert, and Goodra can tank even a Tera Fire-boosted Eruption from Hisuian Typhlosion in sun and hit it back hard, though they cannot switch into such a powerful attack repeatedly.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority Users</strong>: Inteleon and Choice Scarf Chandelure can dispatch non-Choice Scarf Hisuian Typhlosion sets on their own. Aqua Jet from Basculegion, Paldean Tauros-W, and even Overqwil threatens to at least neuter if not outright OHKO Hisuian Typhlosion. Sucker Punch from Toxicroak and Shadow Sneak from Decidueye, Alolan Muk, and Brambleghast similarly threaten to chip Hisuian Typhlosion to reduce the power of Eruption for their teammates if they're unable to finish it off. However, few to none of these Pokemon switch into Hisuian Typhlosion well, and that's if they can switch in at all.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Any damage takes away from Hisuian Typhlosion's ability to wallbreak effectively with Eruption, so entry hazards are terrible for Choice Scarf sets. Hisuian Typhlosion even struggles to switch into passive targets like Bronzong, Amoonguss, and Wish Sylveon due to the risk of taking any damage.</p>",

Shadow Ball nails Flash Fire Chandelure and prevents Fire-resistant Pokemon like Paldean Tauros-W, opposing Hisuian Typhlosion, and Basculegion from switching in unscathed, though Hisuian Typhlosion should generally spam Eruption whenever possible. Focus Blast targets Incineroar with super effective damage. Heavy-Duty Boots enables Hisuian Typhlosion to safely enter the field repeatedly with entry hazards up in order to preserve the power of its Eruption, making it less dependent on hazard removal to function. Frisk scouts opposing foes, helping to determine whether or not Hisuian Typhlosion should stay in to attack slower foes with multiple sets, including ones such as Swords Dance Overqwil, Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, and Choice Scarf Heracross. Tera Fighting boosts the power of Focus Blast for Incineroar and helps Hisuian Typhlosion take Dark-type attacks like Sucker Punch from Toxicroak and Knock Off from Scyther, giving it room to retaliate.</p> <p>Pivots, including Flamigo, Milotic, and Vaporeon, excel at finding opportunities to bring Hisuian Typhlosion onto the field without scuffing its health, and they tend to draw in Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro and Decidueye for Hisuian Typhlosion to threaten. Flygon, Gligar, Diancie, and Kilowattrel greatly appreciate Hisuian Typhlosion as a partner that pressures Bronzong; Flygon and Gligar can check Alolan Muk and position Hisuian Typhlosion with U-turn, and Flygon and Diancie can offensively and defensively check Incineroar. In particular, Kilowattrel makes a great partner to Hisuian Typhlosion by checking Water-types and potentially taking advantage of Incineroar's Intimidate with Competitive. Dragalge, Toxtricity, and Sylveon can rely on Hisuian Typhlosion to break Registeel for them; the former two can get Hisuian Typhlosion in with Flip Turn and Volt Switch, while the last one can support Hisuian Typhlosion with Wish. Toxicroak's Water immunity and ability to check Alolan Muk can make it a helpful partner to Hisuian Typhlosion, and the two of them can wear down their shared Ground-type checks. Hisuian Typhlosion is a good fit for sun teams, complementing Venusaur and working with Scovillain to wear down their shared checks, including Incineroar and Dragalge.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Fire Blast is a stronger move than Eruption once Hisuian Typhlosion has been worn below roughly 74% of its maximum health, and Flamethrower is the same once it's under 60% HP. Flamethrower is a more consistent alternative to Fire Blast, which is especially helpful given Hisuian Typhlosion's frailty becomes a huge liability if it doesn't KO the foe in front of it. Choice Scarf turns Hisuian Typhlosion into a potent revenge killer and potential late-game cleaner, and it ensures it can beat fast foes such as Munkidori and Kilowattrel and slower Choice Scarf users like Porygon-Z and Chandelure. Tera Fire makes Hisuian Typhlosion's Eruption nearly unable to be walled, 2HKOing Alolan Muk and offensive Incineroar and giving it the chance to OHKO Registeel and Gligar after Stealth Rock damage. Tera Fighting cranks up the power of Focus Blast to particularly punish Incineroar. The Fighting typing both enables Hisuian Typhlosion to take a Sucker Punch from Toxicroak and better preserves Eruption's power by turning Hisuian Typhlosion's weakness to Stealth Rock into a resistance.</p> <p>Entry hazard control is necessary to preserve the power of Hisuian Typhlosion's Eruption. Scyther, Tentacruel, and Tsareena are all hazard removers that have pivot moves to safely bring Hisuian Typhlosion in. Hyper offense teams especially appreciate Hisuian Typhlosion's power, and their tempo is conducive to it spamming Eruption. Cinccino is a great teammate on hyper offense teams, as it can use Tidy Up to clear the field of hazards, while Hisuian Typhlosion threatens Steel-types like Bronzong and Registeel. Flygon, Staraptor, and Flamigo can take care of Paldean Tauros-F, Milotic, and Incineroar to open up Hisuian Typhlosion to sweep later. Slow and defensive pivots, including Swampert, Milotic, and Dragalge, can get Hisuian Typhlosion onto the field unscathed, and they draw in faster foes like Brambleghast, Kilowattrel, and Munkidori for it to surprise. Hazard setters like Bronzong and Diancie make Hisuian Typhlosion more punishing to switch around, and their hazards help to wear down checks to Hisuian Typhlosion that may lack Heavy-Duty Boots, such as Vaporeon, Milotic, and Diancie. Spikes setters like Orthworm, Gastrodon, and Gligar can particularly weaken target checks like Swampert, opposing Gastrodon, and Alolan Muk.</p>"

Furthermore, it also excels on entry hazard-spam teams, as it has both Spikes and Stealth Rock. Many hazard stack teams appreciate Gligar's access to Knock Off allowing them to overwhelm foes with hazards. Immunity lets Gligar consistently switch in against foes that spread poison, like Alolan Muk, Toxicroak, and Overqwil. However, Gligar lacks any form of recovery, meaning many foes that it checks like Incineroar, Flygon, and Heracross can wear it down over a battle. Furthermore, Gligar often switches into Knock Off users such as Cinccino, Copperajah, and Incineroar that can reduce its effectiveness. Gligar's average Special Defense makes it worry about special wallbreakers like Toxtricity, Inteleon, and Chandelure, as they can either OHKO it or force it to switch out.</p>",

Toxic Spikes can pressure the opponent's switches and wear down the opposing team more easily. Taunt allows Gligar to deny any entry hazards and setup attempts. Tera Fairy provides useful defensive value against Dragon- and Dark-types like Flygon and Incineroar, but it loses a useful resistance to Poison-type attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Vaporeon, Milotic, and Gastrodon can easily tank Gligar's attacks and threaten it back with Scald and Ice Beam.

Knock Off is preferred over U-turn if Gligar is running dual hazards. Gligar can run Acrobatics so that if it loses its Eviolite it can hit Fighting- and Grass-types like Flamigo, Heracross, and Amoonguss with a strong STAB attack. 56 Speed EVs allow Gligar to outspeed Adamant Incineroar, while 140 Speed EVs let it outpace Jolly Incineroar and Adamant Decidueye.

    "overview": "<p>Porygon2's good Eviolite-boosted defenses and access to Trace make it one of the best special walls in the tier. Porygon2 utilizes Trace to great effect, copying abilities such as Chandelure's Flash Fire, Vaporeon's Water Absorb, Amoonguss's Regenerator, and Toxtricity's Punk Rock. Boasting an impressive Special Attack, Porygon2 circumvents its passivity by threatening 2HKOs or 3HKOs on most offensive Pokemon with its Tri Attack and super effective coverage options. Porygon2's Normal typing is great for letting it be a general blanket check, but its lack of resistances can lead to it being overwhelmed, especially with its susceptibility to entry hazards, since it cannot run Heavy-Duty Boots. Porygon2 is also very vulnerable to physical attackers such as Incineroar and Gligar using Knock Off as well as Choice item users like Chandelure and Munkidori using Trick, since it relies heavily on Eviolite to boost its bulk. Additionally, Porygon2 struggles to threaten bulky Steel-types, such as Registeel and Bronzong, which can allow them opportunities to come in on it for free. On top of that, Porygon2 cannot handle Calm Mind setup sweepers like Sylveon and Scream Tail on its own, especially if they have recovery moves, but it can slow them down with Thunder Wave, allowing a teammate to handle them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Discharge can be used as an alternative to Thunder Wave, since it gives Porygon2 space for more offensive options while still letting it fish for paralysis, though Thunder Wave's guaranteed paralysis is generally preferred.

However, Trace's overall utility is usually much better.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Item Displacement</strong>: Porygon2 relies on Eviolite for much of its walling power, meaning it is very susceptible to moves like Knock Off and Trick, which can remove the Eviolite. Many physical attackers such as Incineroar, Swampert, Alolan Muk, and Gligar carry Knock Off and can hinder Porygon2's bulk to allow partners to break through it more easily. Additionally, special attackers with Choice items, such as Chandelure, Porygon-Z, and Munkidori, can cripple Porygon2 by giving it a Choice item, using Trick.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Porygon2 struggles against bulky Steel-types such as Registeel, Bronzong, and Copperajah. They aren't generally hindered by Thunder Wave and have ways to set entry hazards or boost their own stats, letting these Steel-types exploit Porygon2's lack of coverage to hit them. The first two also threaten Porygon2 with a powerful Body Press.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Powerful physical Fighting-types such as Paldean Tauros-F and -W, Breloom, and Flamigo all threaten Porygon2 with their strong Close Combat. While most do not want to switch into a Thunder Wave, they can pivot in and force Porygon2 out, and Lum Berry Paldean Tauros formes as well as Poison Heal Breloom ignore Thunder Wave altogether and can use Porygon2 as a chance to setup with Bulk Up, Swords Dance, or Substitute.</p>",

Porygon2 can also run a BoltBeam set. Ice Beam threatens Ground-types that might be tempted to switch into a Thunder Wave, such as Flygon and Gligar as well as Grass-types such as Breloom and Amoonguss, which are otherwise very threatening to Porygon2. Thunderbolt handles bulky Water-types like Milotic and Vaporeon that could chip down Porygon2 or Wish pass to allies for free. Foul Play is useful against any physical attackers, such as Basculegion-M, Scyther, and Tera Steel Flygon, as well as physically frail Pokemon such as Espeon and Munkidori. Trace gives Porygon2 amazing defensive utility, providing a massive advantage against a number of Pokemon. For example, it can Trace Vaporeon's Water Absorb, Porygon-Z's Adaptability, Munkidori's Toxic Chain, Toxtricity's Punk Rock, Chandelure's Flash Fire, Incineroar's as well as Paldean Tauros-W's Intimidate, and Klefki's as well as Tornadus's Prankster. Tera Poison is an excellent defensive typing overall and prevents Porygon2 from being poisoned, which is vital against Pokemon like Munkidori, Alolan Muk, and Amoonguss that attempt to cripple Porygon2 by poisoning it. Alternatively, Tera Ghost makes Porygon2 Fighting-immune and boosts the power of Shadow Ball. Finally, Tera Fairy, if Porygon2 copies Flygon's Levitate, allows it to completely wall both of Flygon's STAB attacks while being a generally useful defensive typing. In addition to that, unlike Tera Ghost, Tera Poison and Fairy allow Porygon2 to resist Scrappy Flamigo's Close Combat.</p> <p>Porygon2's weakness to Knock Off users and physical attackers, especially Fighting-types such as Flamigo, Toxicroak, and Heracross, means that it appreciates teammates that can switch into these Pokemon. Amoonguss and Galarian Slowbro make for excellent partners thanks to their Poison typing and Regenerator, allowing them to come in repeatedly throughout the game and tank hits from these threats. Avalugg is another physical wall that pairs well with Porygon2. Despite Avalugg still being weak to Fighting and Knock Off, Porygon2 covers many of its weaknesses by being a blanket special wall that can take on special attackers for it. In return, Avalugg removes entry hazards for Porygon2. Other hazard control options such as Defog Scyther and Altaria are also good partners for Porygon2, since they remove hazards for it while providing good defensive synergy with their Fighting resistances. Porygon2 also appreciates teaming up with physical wallbreakers, especially Fighting-types that can take advantage of bulky Steel-types, which Porygon2 tends to allow in. Flamigo, Paldean Tauros-W and -F, and Heracross are great for this, since they also have good defensive synergy with Porygon2 and appreciate it spreading paralysis to faster Pokemon. Bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Milotic, and Tentacruel can spread status to physical attackers like Flamigo, Flygon, and Scyther that threaten Porygon2 while also checking Hisuian Typhlosion, one of the only special attackers that consistently carries Fighting-type coverage moves. These bulky Water-types also often carry phazing moves, which are very helpful against bulky setup sweepers like Registeel and Bronzong, which Porygon2 struggles against. Additionally, Tentacruel can also provide Rapid Spin support for Porygon2.</p>"

It has a variety of coverage moves, such as Scald and Shadow Ball, but to actually threaten the Ground- and Grass-types that wall it like Flygon, Gligar, Swampert, and Tsareena, it usually requires Tera Blast Fairy or Tera Blast Ice. Furthermore, Raikou usually only has space for one coverage move, so it has to choose which checks to target: Tera Blast Fairy doesn't seriously threaten Gligar; Tera Blast Ice doesn't do much to Swampert; and Scald is impotent against Covert Cloak Tsareena, and if it doesn't burn Flygon, that foe is still very threatening. While Raikou can, given either time or sufficient Calm Mind boosts, break special walls like Bronzong, they can threaten it back with Earthquake. Raikou can also be picked off by physical Choice Scarf users like Flygon, Flamigo, and Infernape.

However, none of these foes are Electric immune, so they can be worn down over time by being forced to repeatedly switch into Raikou's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Raikou's Speed is very good, but Choice Scarf users still threaten to revenge kill it, particularly physical attackers that don't care about its Calm Mind boosts like Flygon, Flamigo, and Infernape.

Shadow Ball, often boosted by Tera Ghost, has solid neutral coverage, but Thunderbolt can provide a strong STAB attack that doesn't force Raikou to leave the field and, consequently, lose its Calm Mind boosts. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Raikou to pivot in and out more freely without concerns about entry hazards, while Leftovers grants longevity and better supports Substitute sets. In addition to Tera Blast Grass's ability to hit Ground-types like Swampert and Gastrodon, Tera Grass gives Raikou a resistance to Ground-type attacks.

On top of this, Swampert also has access to Knock Off, which is valuable utility to cripple item-reliant Pokemon like Talonflame, Avalugg, and Registeel, and Roar, which allows Swampert to challenge setup sweepers like Cresselia and Oricorio-E. However, its limited recovery options make Swampert vulnerable to being worn down over the course of a battle, meaning it won't be able to check these aforementioned setup sweepers long-term. Swampert's 4x weakness to Grass-type attacks also hampers it, as it struggles against common Grass-types like Tsareena, Breloom, and Brambleghast.

Tera Poison turns Swampert's 4x weakness to Grass-type attacks into a resistance and helps it more easily take on the myriad of Fighting-types like Mienshao, Infernape, and Breloom. Tera Fairy makes Swampert immune to Dragon-type attacks from threats like Dragalge and resistant to Dark- and Fighting-type attacks from foes such as Brute Bonnet and Mienshao while allowing it to continue checking Ground-types like Flygon. Tera Dragon gives Swampert resistances to Water-, Fire-, and Grass-type attacks, making it strong against common attackers like Basculegion-M, Incineroar, and Breloom. Tera Steel gives Swampert a wide array of resistances to more easily handle special attackers like Dragalge and Sylveon.</p> <p>Swampert benefits from the support of Grass-resistant teammates like Dragalge, Talonflame, and Incineroar, covering its biggest weakness. Swampert's Stealth Rock can be supplemented by Grass-resistant Spikes users like Klefki and Brambleghast to stack entry hazards, both of which also benefit from Swampert's Fire resistance. Ghost-type teammates like Brambleghast and Chandelure can also support Swampert's Stealth Rock by preventing Rapid Spin from opposing Tsareena and Avalugg. Knock Off users like Alolan Muk, Incineroar, and Mienshao can further support Swampert's entry hazards by removing items. While Swampert can take multiple hits, it lacks any reliable recovery, so pairing it with Wish passers like Sylveon and Florges or backup walls like Dragalge, Vileplume, Registeel, and Incineroar can be helpful. As Swampert lures in Grass-types like Tsareena and Vileplume, wallbreakers that can take advantage of Swampert's pivoting like Infernape, Dragalge, and Chandelure can threaten these foes and force others to switch in and take damage from Swampert's Stealth Rock.</p>"

  "Breloom": {
    "overview": "<p>Breloom's monstrous Attack, especially when coupled with Technician, makes it difficult to switch into at times. On top of this, it has the rare trait of being a Fighting-type that easily beats Water-types like Vaporeon, Swampert, and Milotic; however, it competes with Toxicroak for this role, which has an immunity to Water-type attacks and a higher Speed tier to boot. Breloom can circumvent its middling Speed with a Technician-boosted Mach Punch, though, and while Breloom has solid checks like Vileplume, Galarian Slowbro, and Tornadus, it can carry coverage moves to make quick work of them. Breloom is even immune to Vileplume's Effect Spore, letting it attack it without worry, though it needs to be wary of Rocky Helmet. However, Breloom can't beat all of these checks in one set, forcing it to choose which foes it prefers to beat. Additionally, even though it can be worked around, its Speed can be taken advantage of by multiple other wallbreakers like Chandelure, Staraptor, and Toxtricity. While Breloom has good resistances like Water and Ground, these are often rendered moot by its low defenses, and Water-types, which it can normally check, might burn it with Scald, worsening its damage output and ability to beat them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Breloom can equip a Choice Scarf to become a surprise revenge killer, but its mediocre Speed tier and access to a Technician-boosted Mach Punch makes this set unappealing overall. Gunk Shot lets Breloom hit Grass- and Fairy-types that try to switch into its STAB attacks super effectively like Brambleghast, Whimsicott, and Scream Tail while dealing good damage to Flying-types like Tornadus and Kilowattrel that try to do the same.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Galarian Slowbro, Dragalge, and Vileplume all easily wall Breloom, and both Toxicroak and Tera Poison Uxie can easily use it as setup fodder. However, if Breloom carries Bulldoze, the majority of these aren't an issue, and Aerial Ace can make quick work of Vileplume.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Kilowattrel and Galarian Articuno wall Breloom's STAB moves and can use it for momentum, while Tornadus and Scyther can do the same and also capitalize on Breloom by setting up or throwing off their high-Base Power attacks. However, they're quite frail, meaning Mach Punch could pick them off if they've been sufficiently weakened, and Breloom can carry Rock Tomb and Tera Rock to handle them, though Scyther often carries Close Combat and doesn't worry about Substitute sets thanks to Dual Wingbeat's multi-hit nature.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion can take both of Breloom's STAB moves and retaliate with powerful Fire-type attacks. Paldean Tauros-F and Incineroar are also annoying for Breloom with their access to Intimidate. Breloom can take them out on the switch in with Rock Tomb or Bulldoze and can use Tera Rock to take one Fire-type attack if needed, though.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Munkidori, Meloetta, and Uxie can all threaten out Breloom, but the first two are susceptible to being picked off due to their frailty, and none of them take multiple Bullet Seed hits comfortably.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Aerial Ace allows Breloom to handle one of its best checks, Vileplume. However, Breloom could opt for Bulldoze instead, since Poison-types like Dragalge and Galarian Slowbro can be a pain for it to get past, but in doing so, Breloom gives up any chance of even touching Tornadus, Kilowattrel, and Galarian Articuno. Rock Tomb, on the other hand, allows Breloom to hit these aforementioned troublesome Flying-types as they switch in, and similarly to Bulldoze, it can hit Fire-types like Chandelure, Incineroar, and Hisuian Typhlosion. Seed Bomb can be used over Bullet Seed for its reliable damage output, as it's stronger if Bullet Seed only hits twice; however, the majority of the time, it's weaker, and Breloom is worse off running it. Since Breloom's Speed tier isn't too congested, Adamant is preferred for more power. Jolly does let it outpace Adamant Basculegion, Jolly Incineroar, and Modest Toxtricity, though. Tera Fighting lets Breloom boost its Close Combat and Mach Punch to absurd levels, allowing it to OHKO Alolan Muk and Bronzong and 2HKO Sylveon with the former as well as OHKO Inteleon and Mienshao with the latter. On the other hand, Tera Fire allows Breloom to avoid burns from Incineroar's Will-O-Wisp while letting it withstand a Fire-type attack from Hisuian Typhlosion, Chandelure, and the aforementioned Incineroar at least once. Tera Rock similarly gifts Breloom a Fire resistance and allows it to take Flying-type attacks from Galarian Articuno, Kilowattrel, and Tornadus so that it can retaliate with a STAB-boosted Rock Tomb.</p> <p>One of Breloom's main struggles when trying to wallbreak is getting past Poison-types like Vileplume, Dragalge, and Galarian Slowbro, so Psychic- and Ground-types like Munkidori, Uxie, and Flygon are greatly appreciated. The former two as well as Kilowattrel and Dragalge excel at pivoting Breloom in on Dark- and Steel-types like Klefki, Registeel, and Alolan Muk with their U-turn and Flip Turn. Galarian Articuno is an exceptionally good partner, as on top of also providing U-turn support, it can use Future Sight to limit Breloom's switch-ins even further and take advantage of Vileplume's Strength Sap with its Competitive. In a similar vein, pivots such as Mienshao, Incineroar, Inteleon, and the aforementioned Flygon are appreciated, as they commonly draw in Water-types, like Vaporeon, Milotic, Gastrodon, and Swampert, for Breloom to take advantage of. Flying-types like Kilowattrel and Tornadus can be similarly annoying, so switch-ins to these threats like Kilowattrel, Bellibolt, and Diancie have good synergy. Incineroar, Alolan Muk, and Bronzong, also make for decent partners, handling the Psychic- and Fairy-types, like Uxie, Munkidori, Whimsicott, and Sylveon, that force Breloom out.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>With its monstrous Attack and powerful coverage, Swords Dance Breloom is a terrifying setup sweeper and wallbreaker in NU. Bullet Seed in conjunction with Loaded Dice is Breloom's strongest STAB option, while Seed Bomb provides a Grass-type move without needing to use Loaded Dice, freeing up a slot for Life Orb. Close Combat lets Breloom break through walls like Bronzong and Incineroar but comes at the cost of not hitting Water-types like Swampert and Vaporeon as strongly. Mach Punch lets Breloom pick off Fighting-weak foes like Cinccino, as well as frailer Pokemon like Inteleon and Flygon. Aerial Ace threatens Grass-types, primarily Amoonguss, Decidueye, and Brambleghast, that resist Breloom's STAB combination. Bulldoze buries Poison-types like Alolan Muk, Galarian Slowbro, and Overqwil, as well as nailing Munkidori and Toxicroak on the switch in. Rock Tomb snipes Flying-types like Scyther, Kilowattrel, and Galarian Articuno, with the added benefit of dropping the foe's Speed, making Breloom far more threatening. Bulldoze and Rock Tomb also deter Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion from trying to wall Breloom's STAB moves.</p> <p>Breloom best fits as a wallbreaker on offensive and balanced teams, where its talent in dismantling defensive cores is greatly appreciated against bulkier teams. Hyper offense staples like Uxie, Flygon, and Torterra love Breloom's ability to tear apart defensive stalwarts like Registeel, Sylveon, and Avalugg, respectively, while they help Breloom weaken Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tsareena. On balance teams, teammates like Calm Mind Scream Tail, Paldean Tauros-W, and Overqwil enjoy Breloom handling Steel-, Grass-, and Ground-types. As Breloom is quite frail, defensive pivots like Gligar, Tentacruel, and Incineroar help Breloom hit the field safely; additionally, these Pokemon bait in Water- and Ground-types like Milotic and Gastrodon that Breloom feasts on. Offensive pivots like Kilowattrel, Infernape, and Inteleon can bring Breloom in on foes like Registeel, Tentacruel, and Vaporeon, respectively, where it can grab a boost and start wallbreaking. Entry hazard setters like Overqwil, Diancie, and Gligar assist Breloom with wearing down foes like Overqwil, Sylveon, and Alolan Muk. As Breloom is prone to being forced out by foes like Kilowattrel and Chandelure, a defensive backbone with walls like Bronzong and Incineroar can help deal with them. Steel-types like Registeel handle Poison-types like Munkidori, and Water-types such as Vaporeon help with Fire-types like Hisuian Typhlosion.</p>"

      "GlisLoom (Poison Heal)": {
        "description": "<p>After Poison Heal Breloom activates its Toxic Orb, its immunity to status means it doesn't have to fear attempts to status it from Thunder Wave Galarian Slowbro and Scald users such as Vaporeon and Milotic. However, this could be completely negated if Breloom takes a Knock Off or Trick too early from Mienshao or Choice Scarf Florges. Seed Bomb gives Breloom a STAB move to let it reliably threaten bulky Water- and Ground-types like Vaporeon, Swampert, and Palossand, whereas Toxic allows Breloom to pressure troublesome Ghost-types that it would struggle with otherwise such as Chandelure, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Brambleghast as well as physical walls like Sylveon and Bellibolt. Facade offers a strong neutral attack for Breloom to use against Pokemon that could easily wall it otherwise such as Kilowattrel and Amoonguss. However, Thunder Punch, which should always be paired with Seed Bomb, allows Breloom to hit Flying-types like Flamigo super effectively as well as Steel-types such as Klefki and Copperajah neutrally. Thunder Punch also lets Breloom capitalize on Tera Electric offensively while, defensively, Breloom enjoys its newfound Flying resistance. Protect allows Breloom to activate its Toxic Orb, gives it a free turn of Poison Heal recovery, and lets it scout out Choice item users like Flygon and Munkidori. Breloom could also choose to opt for other moves too, though. For example, Leech Seed allows Breloom to make progress against bulkier foes like Orthworm and Bronzong, Substitute lets it take advantage of passive Pokemon that give it more turns to heal such as Vaporeon and Gligar, Drain Punch lets Breloom target Dark- and Steel-types like Incineroar and Copperajah, Focus Punch pairs exceptionally well with Substitute and lets Breloom do major damage against the aforementioned foes and others like Diancie and Tsareena, and Swords Dance, which should be used in combination with Bulldoze as its last move, allows Breloom to become more threatening more quickly. The EV spread allows Breloom to maximize Poison Heal recovery and outspeed Klefki.</p> <p>Breloom appreciates pivot support from Flygon, Mienshao, Incineroar, and Inteleon, as they can force in Water-types like Milotic and Vaporeon for Breloom to take advantage of, and they grant it free entry because if it switches into a Scald without its Toxic Orb activated already, it risks getting burned. Physical walls like Galarian Slowbro, Milotic, and Dragalge are great partners for Breloom, since they can handle faster, more powerful foes like Mienshao, Chandelure, and Paldean Tauros-W. Bulky Poison-types like Galarian Slowbro, Vileplume, and Dragalge can tank Breloom's attacks when it's unboosted, so it best partners with Psychic- and Ground-types like Munkidori, Meloetta, and Flygon to check them. Flying-types like Kilowattrel and Tornadus can easily revenge kill Breloom. Thus, it appreciates Pokemon like Bellibolt, Diancie, and Rotom-H to take advantage of them. Breloom works well as a partner to Steel- and Dark-types like Copperajah, Bronzong, and Incineroar, as they can handle Fairy- and Psychic-types like Sylveon, Florges, and Meloetta. Breloom synergizes really well with Incineroar, Chandelure, and Hisuian Typhlosion, as it resists Ground-type attacks and can beat both Water- and Dark-types like Milotic and Scrafty for them. Pokemon that hate Scald like Flygon, Paldean Tauros-F, and Mienshao appreciate Breloom for dealing with Scald users like Vaporeon and Milotic for them.</p>"

  "Flygon": {
    "overview": "<p>Flygon's great set versatility makes it an elite Pokemon and one of the best Ground-types in NU. Choice Scarf Flygon fits on many teams, outspeeding and limiting many wallbreakers such as non-Choice Scarf Infernape and Munkidori. Choice Band gives Flygon an incredibly spammable Earthquake and makes it a lot harder to switch into. Flygon can also pivot out with U-turn, allowing it to maintain offensive pressure and momentum. Dragon Dance Flygon can use Loaded Dice, which makes it a great late-game sweeper, and it also threatens lead entry hazard setters like Galvantula and Smeargle. Additionally, it can run moves like Fire Blast to threaten would-be checks like Bronzong and Avalugg. However, as a Choice Scarf user, it faces competition from Munkidori and Infernape, both of which are faster than it and can revenge kill it with Close Combat or Psychic. Additionally, Flygon's average Attack leaves it struggling when facing physical walls like Vaporeon, Amoonguss, and Avalugg, as they can still take its attacks even after a Dragon Dance. Choice Scarf Flygon can be very easy to play around due to both of its STAB options having common immunities and resistances.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flygon can run a mixed set with Draco Meteor and Fire Blast, allowing it to hit physically defensive Pokemon like Avalugg, Orthworm, and Amoonguss. It can also run a Choice Specs set with Tera Normal, which gives it a powerful Boomburst. However, both of these sets are not common due to Flygon's low Special Attack. Flygon can also run a utility set with Stealth Rock / Earthquake / Dragon Tail / U-turn with a bulkier EV spread. This set allows it to set entry hazards for its teammates and check foes like Copperajah and Infernape. Sadly, Flygon lacks any recovery, making it very easy for it to get worn down by chip damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Sylveon and Alolan Ninetales are able to tank hits from Choice Scarf Flygon and KO it back with their STAB Fairy-type attacks; however, neither of them can handle Choice Band sets too well, and they can be setup fodder against Tera Steel Dragon Dance Flygon.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Physically defensive Pokemon such as Avalugg and Amoonguss have enough bulk to win against any of Flygon's sets, but Amoonguss has to be careful directly switching into +1 Flygon if entry hazards are present. Bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Swampert, and Milotic are bulky enough to tank a boosted attack and threaten Flygon back with status and Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users and Faster Attackers</strong>: Infernape, Breloom, Toxicroak, and Basculegion-M can revenge kill Flygon after it has been weakened a bit.

Dragon Claw is a safer option to avoid getting locked into Outrage, but it's significantly weaker and is harder to revenge kill foes with. U-turn allows Flygon to maintain momentum and provide free switches to teammates. Flygon's last move is commonly Stone Edge, which allows it to hit Flying-types like Kilowattrel as well as Ice-types such as Alolan Ninetales. Alternatively, Stealth Rock allows it to set entry hazards for its teammates. Flygon can run Throat Chop last for a move with great neutral coverage into the entire tier while hitting Bronzong super effectively. Tera Blast Steel could also be used, surprising and OHKOing would-be revenge killers to Flygon like Alolan Ninetales and Diancie. It also offers a strong and spammable attack. First Impression can be used over Stone Edge, allowing Flygon to revenge kill weakened boosted and faster threats like Drednaw and Choice Scarf Munkidori. Tera Steel gives Flygon a resistance to Fairy- and Dragon-type attacks from Pokemon like Sylveon, Florges, and opposing Flygon. This also allows it to check some special wallbreakers like Alolan Ninetales, Munkidori, and Porygon-Z.</p> <p>Wallbreakers like Chandelure, Infernape, and Basculegion-M appreciate Choice Scarf Flygon for giving them free entry with U-turn.

Outrage is still an option to allow Flygon to 2HKO Vaporeon, but Scale Shot is preferred so Flygon isn't easily revenge killed by Fairy-types, and it makes Flygon harder to revenge kill overall.  Alternatively, Dragon Claw offers Flygon a reliable and decently powered STAB move. First Impression revenge kills weakened foes like Porygon-Z, Munkidori, and Torterra. However, Throat Chop provides coverage for Bronzong and shuts down Hyper Voice Sylveon whereas Stone Edge pops Kilowattrel and Alolan Ninetales on the switch.

Dropping Scale Shot for Outrage is acceptable to run a different item, but this makes Flygon significantly more reliant on obtaining multiple Dragon Dance boosts to avoid being revenge killed. Fire Punch allows Flygon to hit Grass-types like Tsareena, Amoonguss, and Decidueye, as well as Steel-types like Bronzong, Orthworm, and Tera Steel Flygon. Alternatively, Throat Chop lets Flygon target Bronzong, and it blocks Sylveon from using Hyper Voice. Tera Steel allows it to take attacks from Alolan Ninetales, Diancie, Munkidori, and Flygon more easily. If Flygon forgoes Scale Shot, its item slot opens up to Life Orb for an extra power boost, Clear Amulet to avoid Incineroar's and Paldean Tauros-W's Intimidate, or other more niche ones like Leftovers and Muscle Band. With Tera Steel, Flygon can also exploit Pokemon like Amoonguss for easier setup. However, Substitute leaves Flygon dead in the water against Bronzong and Orthworm. Tera Fire gives Fire Punch a much-needed power boost and retains the resistance to Fairy-type attacks that Tera Steel gives.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Flygon appreciates entry hazard support from Klefki and Swampert to guarantee a 2HKO on Pokemon like Amoonguss and Vaporeon. Flygon is a perfect pick for hyper offense teams due to its Sticky Web immunity and because it can sweep opposing hyper offense teams. It can also punish lead hazard setters like Cinccino and Smeargle by setting up a Dragon Dance and breaking their Focus Sashes with Scale Shot. Other sweepers like Cinccino, Drednaw, and Mienshao appreciate Dragon Dance Flygon's ability to weaken teams so they can win late-game. Choice Scarf users like Mienshao, Munkidori, and Infernape can force Flygon to switch out even if it's at +1 because they can still outspeed it. Thus, slow pivots like Toxtricity, Swampert, and Flip Turn Vaporeon can help by bringing Flygon in safely. Other Pokemon that overwhelm Bronzong alongside Flygon synergize especially well.

Throat Chop allows Flygon to block sound-based attacks from foes like Sylveon and Toxtricity as well as hit Bronzong. Dragon Tail can also be used to force out sweepers like Shell Smash Drednaw and Bulk Up Scrafty, however Flygon prefers to run other moves due to them having more utility and being more usable.

Natural Cure allows Altaria to double up as a status absorber, enabling status-hating Pokemon like Diancie, Incineroar, and Substitute Basculegion-M. With Perish trapping sets, Altaria can surprise bulky walls and offensive foes alike that plan to take advantage of it like Bronzong, Porygon2, and Scrafty, and by removing these foes, Altaria can open up its teammates to more easily break through and take on the opposing team. However, utility sets are very passive, meaning many Pokemon such as Toxtricity, Diancie, and Alolan Ninetales can capitalize on it by switching in freely. Additionally, Altaria's 4x Ice weakness means that it must be extremely careful around Pokemon carrying Ice-type coverage like Inteleon, Porygon2, and Milotic as well as common Ice-types like Alolan Ninetales and Avalugg.

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp lets Altaria burn physical attackers such as Basculegion-M, Flamigo, and Scyther. Alternatively, Altaria can use Haze to prevent setup sweepers like Arcanine and Incineroar from taking advantage of it. Roar works similarly, and it can rack up entry hazard damage on foes, though it's worse in one-on-one scenarios. Natural Cure allows Altaria to be a very valuable status absorber, being able to take Vaporeon's Scald burns, Amoonguss's Toxic, and Porygon2's Thunder Wave. Both EV spreads allow Altaria to be faster than Thwackey, Milotic, and Bulk Up Scrafty, but the first one improves its matchup against physical attackers like Paldean Tauros-W, Flamigo, and Basculegion-M, whereas the second lets it better handle powerful special attackers such as Chandelure, Munkidori, and Kilowattrel. However, a physically defensive set is generally preferred due to the lack of Pokemon in the tier that can also handle both STAB attacks from powerful wallbreakers like Paldean Tauros-W, Infernape, and Paldean Tauros-F. Tera Steel complements Altaria's base typing quite well, gifting Altaria resistances to attacks it would take big damage from otherwise like Alolan Ninetales's Blizzard and Moonblast, Diancie's Rock- and Fairy-type STAB attacks, and Flygon's Dragon-type STAB moves. On the other hand, Tera Fairy grants Altaria a Dragon immunity to help its matchup against Flygon while still maintaining Altaria's Fighting resistance.</p> <p>Altaria appreciates Steel- and Fairy-type defensive partners, such as Bronzong, Sylveon, and Diancie, which can switch into Ice-, Dragon-, and Fairy-types that threaten Altaria, such as Alolan Ninetales, Flygon, and opposing Sylveon. Powerful special wallbreakers such as Chandelure, Inteleon, and Porygon-Z can overwhelm Altaria, especially if they have Ice-type coverage, making special walls such as Porygon2 and Alolan Muk good partners. In return, Altaria's great defensive typing lets it switch into Fighting- and Ground-type attacks that threaten them. Altaria's typing also has great synergy with other defensive Pokemon, such as Avalugg, Diancie, Incineroar, and Gastrodon, switching into attacks from Pokemon that threaten them like Infernape, Swampert, Paldean Tauros-W, and Breloom. Altaria's entry hazard removal further helps keep these defensive cores healthy. However, Altaria is very susceptible to item displacement, making Knock Off absorbers such as Amoonguss, Paldean Tauros-W, Paldean Tauros-F, Sylveon, and Sticky Hold Gastrodon good partners. Finally, Altaria's passivity makes it vulnerable to bulky setup sweepers, especially special attackers that do not care about Will-O-Wisp such as Oricorio-P, Calm Mind Scream Tail, and Nasty Plot Porygon-Z, making Pokemon that can disrupt them with Encore, such as Whimsicott and Grafaiai, or phazers and Haze users such as Roar Sylveon and Vaporeon as well as Haze Overqwil and Milotic good partners.</p>"

      "Perish Trap": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Perish Song and Fire Spin let Altaria trap and KO foes that lack pivot moves, such as Bronzong, Amoonguss, and Gastrodon. Roost lets it heal up and stall turns until Perish Song kicks in. However, Rest can also be used, since Altaria's Natural Cure allows it to heal to full HP and then switch out while removing the sleep status. Altaria's fourth move is very flexible. Defog allows Altaria to remove entry hazards, which it can find opportunities to use when stalling turns for Perish Song. Brave Bird makes Altaria a bit more threatening and not entirely reliant on Perish Song for KOing foes, aiding it against Pokemon that either don't care about Fire Spin or can pivot out of it like Chandelure and Incineroar. Will-O-Wisp lets Altaria cripple physical attackers, allowing it to more easily weather their attacks while waiting for Perish Song. Finally, Haze lets Altaria remove stat boosts from the foe, which prevents setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Incineroar and Bulk Up Scrafty from breaking through Altaria. Natural Cure removes status such as poison from Alolan Muk and Amoonguss or paralysis from Klefki and Porygon2 when it switches out. A Bold or Calm nature should be used if Fire Spin is Altaria's only attack, but Impish or Careful can be used if Altaria has Brave Bird. Altaria can run either a physically defensive or a specially defensive EV spread, depending on what its team requires defensively. Either way, the given Speed investment lets it outpace Milotic, Thwackey, and Bulk Up Scrafty. Tera Steel flips Altaria's matchup against Ice- and Fairy-types such as Alolan Ninetales and Sylveon as well as Pokemon with Ice-type coverage, such as Ice Beam Porygon2 and Inteleon. Alternatively, Tera Fairy can be used, as it lets Altaria more reliably handle Dragon-types and continue checking Fighting-types after Terastallizing.</p> <p>Perish trap Altaria pairs well with offensive teammates that struggle to break through bulky foes, such as Paldean Tauros-W, Chandelure, Diancie, and Munkidori. These Pokemon can bait in their bulky checks, such as Amoonguss, Porygon2, Bronzong, and Copperajah, letting Altaria trap and KO them. Altaria also pairs well with defensive partners that struggle to make progress against bulky teams, such as Porygon2, Vaporeon, and Gastrodon, helping very passive teams make progress against opposing walls. Knock Off and entry hazard support is very useful for Altaria, as Altaria can force a lot of switches once it is revealed to be a Perish trap variant . This makes Altaria useful on hazard stack teams, with partners such as Gligar, Diancie, and Bronzong. As Pokemon with pivot moves like Volt Switch Kilowattrel, Flip Turn Basculegion-M, and U-turn Infernape don't fear Perish Song + Fire Spin, teammates that can punish these attacks such as Electric-immune Pokemon like Gastrodon and Volt Absorb Kilowattrel, Water-immune Pokemon like Vaporeon, and Rocky Helmet users like Milotic and Galarian Slowbro have great synergy. Diancie, Decidueye, Basculegion-M, and Incineroar enjoy Altaria's great defensive profile, which allows it to switch into checks of theirs like Paldean Tauros-W, Arcanine, Scrafty, and Heracross. Steel- and Fairy-type Pokemon such as Bronzong, Copperajah, Sylveon, and Alolan Ninetales naturally complement Altaria quite well, with the former two being specially defensive partners and the latter two offensively handling Dragon-types.</p>"

  "Milotic": {
    "overview": "<p>Milotic stands out from the other bulky Water-types thanks to its access to reliable recovery and solid mixed bulk. It checks many common threats like Flygon, Incineroar, and Chandelure. Milotic's access to Recover means that it can run other moves on its set, giving it a huge advantage over Vaporeon, which usually sacrifices two slots for Wish and Protect. However, Milotic can struggle against powerful wallbreakers like Flamigo, Porygon-Z, and Flygon, as they can overwhelm it and force it to immediately heal. Additionally, Milotic can be forced to Terastallize by Pokemon like Alolan Muk and Galarian Slowbro that threaten it with poison, which otherwise forces it to constantly heal. While Milotic can handle many physical and special attackers, it can be easily overwhelmed by repeatedly switching into foes that it checks like Chandelure and Flygon or a powerful attack.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Milotic can run Tera Steel, giving it an immunity to Poison-type moves and letting it check foes like Munkidori and Porygon-Z, but the Steel typing makes Milotic weak to Ground- and Fire-type attacks from foes like Flygon and Chandelure.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Kilowattrel, Toxtricity, and Raikou easily destroy Milotic with their STAB attacks and the latter two can use it as setup fodder, but none of them enjoy switching into either Scald or Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Brambleghast, Decidueye, and Breloom can easily destroy Milotic with their powerful attacks and the latter two can use it as setup fodder. However, all of them must be worried about switching into Ice Beam variants.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Powerful wallbreakers like Life Orb Toxicroak and Choice Band users such as Flygon and Paldean Tauros-W can put a lot of pressure on Milotic. Setup sweepers like Swords Dance Breloom, Nasty Plot Munkidori, and Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro can overwhelm Milotic with their powerful STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Water-immune Pokemon</strong>: Vaporeon and Gastrodon are immune to Milotic's Scald, and the former can threaten Milotic with status attempts. Toxicroak can use Milotic as complete setup fodder or to safely fire off its STAB attacks.</p>",

      "Defensive Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Ice Beam allows Milotic to threaten Grass- and Dragon-types like Brambleghast, Breloom, Amoonguss, and Goodra. Haze helps it prevent setup sweepers like Swords Dance Overqwil and Dragon-immune ones such as Calm Mind Scream Tail as well as Tera Fairy Uxie from snowballing, while Dragon Tail lets Milotic phaze sweepers and walls like Toxicroak, Taunt Oricorio-P, and Gastrodon. Milotic can run Alluring Voice, letting it threaten foes that often boost their stats like Paldean Tauros-W and Flygon with confusion. Heavy-Duty Boots prevent Milotic from getting worn down by entry hazards, while Leftovers gives it a bit more recovery. Rocky Helmet can be used over Heavy-Duty Boots, as it can punish any physical contact with chip damage. Marvel Scale can be useful if Milotic gets statused, whereas Competitive lets it take advantage of Intimidate users like Overqwil and Incineroar as well as Defoggers such as Altaria and Cramorant. Milotic can run a mixed defensive EV spread, allowing it to survive a Swords Dance-boosted Adamant Incineroar's Knock Off while letting it check special wallbreakers like Hisuian Typhlosion, Chandelure, and Inteleon reliably. Tera Poison gives Milotic a useful immunity to poison from Alolan Muk and Overqwil while providing it with a useful resistance to Fighting- and Grass-type attacks, helping it against Paldean Tauros-W, Infernape, and Decidueye. Alternatively, Tera Fairy provides it with an overall better defensive typing that doesn’t give it a Ground-type weakness, which helps against Flygon and better handle Fighting-types like Flamigo and Paldean Tauros-W. Lastly, Tera Dragon still gives it the Grass-type resistance while giving it the ability to check Pokemon like Inteleon, Chandelure, and Toxtricity.</p> <p>Milotic can form a strong VoltTurn core with other pivot users like Flygon, Flamigo, Kilowattrel, and Toxtricity, as they can enter the field safely thanks to Milotic's slow Flip Turn and chip foes like Swampert and Overqwil. Grass-types like Brambleghast, Breloom, and Decidueye can force Milotic to switch out or use up Terastallization, so it best partners with Fire- and Poison-types like Incineroar, Chandelure, and Galarian Slowbro to check them. Physical attackers like Flygon, Infernape, and Breloom appreciate Milotic variants that run Competitive to take advantage of Intimidate users like Incineroar and Overqwil. Non-Heavy-Duty Boots Milotic variants can be worn down by entry hazards; thus it partners well with hazard removers like Brambleghast, Scyther, and Cinccino. Milotic best synergizes with defensive Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro, Gligar, Bronzong, and Amoonguss, as they can handle foes like Toxicroak, Breloom, Alolan Ninetales, and Alolan Muk. In return, Milotic handles threats like Flygon, Chandelure, and Incineroar. Milotic pairs well with teammates like Toxicroak, Decidueye, and Toxtricity to help it deal with Water-immune and -resistant foes like Vaporeon, Gastrodon, and opposing Milotic.</p>"

  "Torterra": {
    "overview": "<p>Torterra excels as a setup sweeper on hyper offense teams, using Shell Smash to boost its stats and power through foes. Torterra has all the coverage it needs with Rock Blast, as it hits Flying-types like Talonflame and Kilowattrel that might otherwise threaten to wall and KO Torterra. It can also work around some of its checks with Tera Blast, improving its matchup into Grass-types like Vileplume and Tsareena. Torterra's high base Defense and solid defensive typing provide it ample opportunities to set up against foes like Basculegion and Swampert. While Torterra can somewhat choose its checks with Rock Blast and Tera Blast Fire, it cannot run both, and as a result can be checked by Grass-types like Vileplume and Tsareena or by Flying-types like Talonflame. Furthermore, Torterra's low base Speed makes it vulnerable to being outsped and revenge killed by Choice Scarf users like Munkidori, Flygon, and Mienshao, even after a Shell Smash boost, meaning it often requires Sticky Web support. Priority, such as Flygon's First Impression and Toxicroak's Sucker Punch, can also end a potential sweep, as Torterra often lowers its Defense with Shell Smash and Headlong Rush.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>On non-Loaded Dice sets, Torterra can choose Stone Edge as an alternative to Tera Blast for coverage that does not require Tera, but accuracy can become a problem. Torterra can also run moves like Zen Headbutt and Crunch to hit specific targets like Vileplume and Bronzong without Terastallizing; however, they are fairly niche or outclassed by other options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Torterra's STAB moves cannot hit Grass-types, such as Tsareena, Vileplume, and Brambleghast, so it is forced to rely on Tera Blast Fire to hit them, which some sets may not carry.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types like Talonflame, Kilowattrel, and Tornadus don't fear Torterra's STAB moves, and even when Torterra carries coverage like Rock Blast, it can be inaccurate. These foes also outspeed unboosted Torterra, and Talonflame in particular may burn it if it predicts that Torterra will not Terastallize Fire.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Torterra's low Speed makes it vulnerable to being revenge killed by Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Munkidori, as well as priority like Toxicroak's Sucker Punch and Flygon's First Impression. Flygon in particular is dangerous, as its Choice Scarf set cannot be slowed by Sticky Web due to Levitate, and it frequently uses Tera Steel.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Bullet Seed is a powerful STAB move but requires Loaded Dice to be effective, while Wood Hammer provides immediate power without requiring an item slot but forces Torterra to take recoil. Earthquake is a strong move without a drawback, but Headlong Rush provides even more power, with the downside of defensive stat drops. Rock Blast, like Bullet Seed, requires Loaded Dice to be effective, but it provides necessary coverage against Flying-types like Talonflame and Kilowattrel. Tera Ghost can be used defensively, removing Torterra's existing weaknesses and adding an immunity to Fighting-type attacks, which can be useful against revenge killers like Mach Punch Breloom and Choice Scarf Mienshao. Tera Blast Fire can OHKO defensive Grass-types like Tsareena and Vileplume. Tera Fire also prevents Torterra from being burned. Since Flying-types like Talonflame, Tornadus, and Kilowattrel naturally outspeed Torterra and deal great damage with their STAB moves, Torterra may want to opt for Tera Electric, giving it a resistance to their Flying-type STAB moves and maintaining its immunity to Thunder Wave. If not using Loaded Dice along with Bullet Seed and Rock Blast, Torterra can utilize White Herb to restore its defenses after Shell Smash, making it a more reliable setup sweeper. While a Jolly nature lets Torterra outspeed foes such as Choice Scarf Chandelure and Heracross, Adamant can be run on Sticky Web teams for more power.</p> <p>Torterra's low Speed makes it vulnerable to being revenge killed by Choice Scarf users like Mienshao, Munkidori, and Inteleon, so Sticky Web users like Araquanid and Galvantula support it well. Choice Scarf Flygon has Levitate to be immune to Sticky Web, so faster Choice Scarf users like Munkidori and Mienshao can help Torterra handle it. Additional physical breakers can weaken Torterra's checks and finish them off after Torterra is stopped, so teammates like Swords Dance Toxicroak and Dragon Dance Flygon and Iron Thorns pair well with it; the first handles Grass-types, the second and third can weaken them for Torterra, and the last can also handle Flying-types like Talonflame and Kilowattrel. Teammates such as Chandelure and Tornadus that can target Grass-types like Vileplume and Tsareena are also appreciated, weakening or outright removing these checks to Torterra. Fire-types like Chandelure, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Incineroar appreciate Torterra's support against Water- and Ground-types like Swampert and Flygon.</p>"

  "Infernape": {
    "overview": "<p>Infernape has a unique niche in NU thanks to its phenomenal set diversity and excellent Speed tier. However, it usually opts for two sets, Choice Scarf and Choice Specs, both of which have many upsides. Specifically, Choice Scarf allows Infernape to revenge kill faster Pokemon like Munkidori, Barraskewda, and Kilowattrel, while Choice Specs sets capitalize on Infernape's set ambiguity by unleashing a powerful Overheat or Fire Blast on the physical walls that Choice Scarf Infernape forces in. Additionally, Choice Scarf sets outspeed most other Choice Scarf users, such as Flygon, Munkidori, and Flamigo. However, Infernape faces competition against these exact Choice Scarf users due to them fitting on more teams easily. Additionally, Choice Specs sets can struggle to break through Pokemon like Altaria, Chandelure, and Basculegion-M due to their decent bulk and ability to take both of Infernape's STAB moves comfortably. Infernape also fights for a slot on teams with other Fighting-types, since Toxicroak reliably beats Water-types, Flamigo has access to recovery, Paldean Tauros-W can switch into Incineroar without fear of Knock Off due to being less item reliant than Infernape, and Paldean Tauros-F can easily fit Stone Edge to hit would-be checks like Altaria and Chandelure.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Infernape can run a Choice Band set, letting it break through defensive tanks like Galarian Slowbro and Overqwil, but it's largely outclassed by other Fighting-types like Flamigo, Toxicroak, and the Paldean Tauros formes. Infernape can run a Swords Dance or Nasty Plot set, making it a excellent setup sweeper; however, it struggles to run all of the moves that it needs and is easily revenge killed by common Choice Scarf users like Munkidori, Chandelure, and Flygon. A lead set of Stealth Rock / Taunt / Endeavor or Encore / Mach Punch or Knock Off with a Focus Sash can be run on hyper offense teams to aid in both setting up and preventing entry hazards. Infernape can run a mixed set of Fire Blast or Overheat / Close Combat / U-turn or Grass Knot or Stone Edge / Knock Off with a Life Orb, allowing it to threaten many walls like Avalugg, Galarian Slowbro, Vaporeon, and Gligar; however, it gets revenge killed by faster foes like Kilowattrel, Munkidori, and Choice Scarf Flamigo, and due to EV constraints, it often is a weaker and worse off wallbreaker than a fully physical or special set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Threats and Priority Users</strong>: Barraskewda, Kilowattrel, and Scream Tail can outspeed Infernape and destroy it with their attacks, but none of them enjoy switching into Infernape's STAB attacks.

Infernape can be picked off by priority users like Shadow Sneak Decidueye and Aqua Jet Basculegion-M.</p> <p><strong>Fire-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Vaporeon can fairly tank Infernape's attacks and threaten it back with their attacks, but none can repeatedly switch into its Fighting-type attacks. Offensive Water-types like Barraskewda and Paldean Tauros-W can KO Infernape with their attacks, and they can pick it off with Aqua Jet. Chandelure is immune to both of its STAB attacks and easily destroys it; however, Chandelure doesn't enjoy switching directly into Scorching Sands and Knock Off. Basculegion-M can tank Infernape's Fire-type attacks and blank its Fighting-type attacks, but it doesn't enjoy tanking Grass Knot and Knock Off. While Altaria doesn't enjoy switching into Stone Edge variants, it can easily resist both of Infernape's STAB attacks and KO it. Diancie walls Infernape's Fire-type attacks and Choice Specs sets, but it doesn't enjoy switching into Close Combat repeatedly.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Flygon, Rhyperior, and Swampert can easily OHKO Infernape with Earthquake or freely set up entry hazards; however, none of them enjoy directly switching into Infernape's Fighting-type attacks.

  "Staraptor": {
    "overview": "<p>Staraptor lands itself a niche in NU thanks to its high Attack and Speed stats, which can be further boosted with either Choice Band or Choice Scarf. Choice Band paired with Reckless lets Staraptor do major damage towalls like Galarian Slowbro and Overqwil while putting pressure on resistant foes such as Klefki and Bronzong. On the other hand, Choice Scarf lets it outpace threats like Kilowattrel, Flamigo, and Inteleon. Staraptor fits on many balance teams thanks to its ability to handle common defensive cores of Amoonguss, Vaporeon, and Wo-Chien. Despite its strengths, Staraptor is outclassed by Flamigo in almost every aspect as a Flying-type Choice Scarf user, as Flamigo isn't weak to Stealth Rock and has a more useful secondary typing in Fighting, which allows it to hit Steel-types much more effectively. Staraptor is held back by its weakness to Stealth Rock, which, alongside recoil from its STAB moves, hurts its longevity greatly. It is also held back by its struggles to break commonplace defensive Pokemon such as Galarian Slowbro, Avalugg, Bellibolt, and Duraludon thanks to their natural bulk. Staraptor's competition as a Choice Scarf user is fierce, as Munkidori and Flamigo both provide a similar Speed tier while not needing to use recoil inflicting moves, which allows them to last longer in games more effectively and still do large amounts of damage. There are other naturally fast, offensive Flying-types like Kilowattrel and Tornadus that Staraptor competes with, and both of them have much better coverage options, which further discredits using Staraptor.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf, along with Starptor's high Speed tier, makes it an excellent user of Final Gambit, allowing it to grab surprise KOs and deal solid damage to foes like Flygon and Bronzong and letting its teammates benefit at the cost of losing Staraptor itself.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Staraptor is threatened by fast Electric-types like Kilowattrel and Raikoun as they can outspeed and threaten to KO it with their STAB moves; however, Staraptor can surprise KO them if it is using Choice Scarf. Bellibolt is also threatening, as it punishes Staraptor's moves with Rocky Helmet chip damage and the risk of paralysis from Static. None of these Pokemon can switch into Staraptor's Choice Band attacks without being 2HKOed at best, however.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Staraptor's reliance on Choice items makes it threatened by Stealth Rock. Furthermore, Staraptor consistently switching in and out can make this worse, since Stealth Rock greatly limits Staraptor's longevity and its ability to repeatedly enter the field.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls like Galarian Slowbro, Rhyperior, and Avalugg can all take hits from Staraptor and threaten it back with their own attacks, and the former also threatens it with status. Due to Staraptor's raw power, these walls do not enjoy switching into its attacks directly though.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Klefki, Duraludon, Bronzong, and Copperajah resist Staraptor's STAB attacks, so they can freely switch into them and either set up entry hazards or hit back against Staraptor with their own attacks.

Close Combat allows Staraptor to hit Steel-types such as Bronzong, Klefki, and Copperajah. U-turn lets Staraptor capitalize on switch-ins such as Bronzong and Diancie by wearing them down. Choice Band can put huge dents into walls such as Altaria and Klefki, making them very limited in how often they can switch into an attack, whereas Choice Scarf makes Staraptor capable of outpacing threats like Flamigo and Kilowattrel. Tera Flying lets Brave Bird OHKO Basculegion-M and Munkidori. On the other hand, Tera Normal makes Quick Attack a stronger priority option, allows Double-Edge 2HKO Gligar, and removes Staraptor's Stealth Rock weakness. Tera Fighting provides some defensive value by giving Staraptor a resistance to Stealth Rock and a resistance to Dark-type moves from foes like Scrafty and Incineroar.</p> <p>Staraptor alone can struggle to break physically defensive Pokemon such as Bellibolt, Duraludon, and Galarian Slowbro. Partners such as Chandelure, Flygon, and Toxtricity can effectively break through them and appreciate Staraptor's U-turn support. Staraptor also benefits from other fast pivots like Inteleon, Kilowattrel, and Munkidori by chipping down their checks such as Incineroar and Bronzong and allowing them to potentially KO them. Slower pivots like Incineroar, Bellibolt, and Swampert give it free entry to capitalize on switch-ins such as Heracross, Wo-Chien and Amoonguss. Furthermore, Staraptor enjoys being partnered with entry hazard removal Pokemon like Tsareena, Avalugg, and Altaria to maximize its longevity. Tsareena in larticular is a useful partner, as its Knock Off is especially helpful for Staraptor to break Steel-types.</p>"

  "Bronzong": {
    "overview": "<p>Bronzong is an elite Steel-type in NU thanks to both its great mixed bulk and an excellent ability in Levitate, which, unlike other Steel-types, allows it to check many Ground-types like Flygon and Gligar, along with other Pokémon that rely on Ground-type coverage to hit Steel-types like Diancie. Bronzong is remarkably resistant to entry hazards, as it simultaneously resists Stealth Rock and has an immunity to Spikes, making it a centerpiece on teams with little to no hazard removal. Furthermore, Bronzong excels at being a great hazard setter thanks to its ability to check threats like Munkidori, Sylveon, and Porygon-Z. It can take advantage of these positive matchups and its already tremendous bulk by instead being a bulky setup sweeper, becoming very difficult to take out. However, Bronzong's only form of recovery is Leftovers, meaning that it has to be even more wary about switching into the already threatening Knock Off from Pokemon that it would check otherwise like Copperajah, Tsareena, and Toxicroak. Additionally, foes that Bronzong is typically expected to check like Munkidori, Florges, and Rotom-C often run Trick to cripple it severely and especially hurt its setup sets.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bronzong can opt to run a fully physically defensive EV spread, letting it handle physical wallbreakers like Flygon, Staraptor, and Breloom a bit better, but this makes it worse against Pokemon like Kilowattrel, Inteleon, and Munkidori. Heatproof allows Bronzong to handle Pokemon that carry Fire-type coverage like Fire Punch Flygon and Flamethrower Galarian Slowbro, but the Ground immunity from Levitate is almost always superior. Future Sight lets it limit switch-ins for wallbreakers like Flygon, Breloom, and Paldean Tauros-W. Gyro Ball lets Bronzong hit faster opponents like Mienshao, Tornadus, and Flygon much harder. Protect can be used on utility sets, providing Bronzong a bit more Leftovers recovery and letting it scout out Choice item users like Flygon and Munkidori; however, it struggles to fit it because it prefers to run other utility moves. Trick alongside Toxic Orb allows Bronzong to cripple defensive tanks like Incineroar, Cresselia, and Vaporeon. Colbur Berry lets Bronzong tank Dark-type attacks like Dark Pulse from Inteleon and Knock Off from Tsareena, but it prefers Leftovers for gaining extra recovery.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types and Dark-type Coverage</strong>: Incineroar, Alolan Muk, Overqwil, and Scrafty can tank Bronzong’s attacks very well and threaten it back with their STAB attacks. However, none of them want to switch into a +2 Body Press. Pokemon that have Dark-type coverage like Throat Chop Flygon, Dark Pulse Inteleon, and Knock Off from Tornadus or Cinccino can put a lot of pressure on Bronzong as well.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Chandelure, Hisuian Typhlosion, Decidueye, and Brambleghast easily destroy Bronzong with their STAB attacks, and the former can cripple it with Trick. However, the first two have to be mindful about switching into Bronzong variants that run Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Knock Off users like Copperajah, Tsareena, Gligar, and Mienshao can threaten Bronzong by getting rid of its Leftovers, cutting into its longevity over the course of the battle. Choice Scarf users like Munkidori, Florges, and Rotom-C can both bother utility sets and ruin Bronzong's sweeping attempts by crippling it with Trick.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Paldean Tauros-F, Rotom-H, and Salazzle threaten Bronzong with their high-Base Power attacks or take advantage of it by getting free turns to set up. Salazzle is especially annoying with its access to Encore and, thanks to Corrosion, can threaten Bronzong with Toxic.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Body Press pairs well with Bronzong's good Defense, letting it threaten Dark- and Steel-types like Incineroar, Scrafty, and Copperajah. Earthquake lets Bronzong target Fire- and Poison-types like Chandelure and Galarian Slowbro, and even after Intimidate, it hits Overqwil harder than Body Press can. Heavy Slam allows Bronzong to hit Fairy-types like Sylveon, Florges, and Diancie. Night Shade can be used over Heavy Slam, allowing Bronzong to make solid progress against Ghost- and Dark-types like Chandelure, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Alolan Muk. Optionally, Bronzong can invest 164 Defense EVs in order to 2HKO offensive Incineroar with Body Press while better taking hits from physical attackers like Flygon. Tera Fairy gives Bronzong a useful resistance to Dark- and Fighting-type attacks from Incineroar and Mienshao. Tera Water, on the other hand, provides it a resistance to Water- and Fire-type attacks, helping it against Pokemon like Inteleon and Chandelure.</p> <p>Bronzong pairs well with Fighting-types like Mienshao, Scrafty, Toxicroak, and Paldean Tauros-W, as they can handle Dark-types like Incineroar and Alolan Muk, and the last three are great switch-ins to Knock Off; in return, Bronzong checks Fairy- and Psychic-types such as Sylveon, Florges, and Munkidori. Ghost-types like Chandelure, Decidueye, and Brambleghast can take Bronzong's attacks fairly easily and threaten it back with their own STAB attacks. Thus, it best partners with Dark-types like Incineroar, Alolan Muk, Overqwil, and Bombirdier to check the aforementioned Ghost-types. Bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Milotic, and Tentacruel can beat Fire-types like Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion for Bronzong. Spikes users like Overqwil, Brambleghast, and Heracross are excellent partners for Bronzong, as they can spread entry hazards to help each other wear down their checks. Wish passers like Vaporeon and Sylveon let Bronzong repeatedly switch in against special wallbreakers like Kilowattrel and Dragalge by offsetting its lack of recovery. Bronzong synergizes well with physical walls like Gligar, Vileplume, and Vaporeon for their positive matchups against physical attackers like Toxicroak, Paldean Tauros-W, and Incineroar. In return, Bronzong handles special wallbreakers like Munkidori, Toxtricity, and Sylveon.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Body Press lets Bronzong pressure Steel- and Dark-types like Copperajah, Klefki, and Incineroar. Stored Power lets it more easily break through Fighting-resistant and -immune Pokemon that try to switch in like Sylveon, Vileplume, and Decidueye, while the scaling power from both Bronzong's boosted offenses and defenses helps it break past opposing Calm Mind setup from the likes of Sylveon, Florges, and Galarian Slowbro. The EV spread allows Bronzong to outspeed Gastrodon so that when Bronzong Terastallizes, it can attack before being hit by a Clear Smog while giving it enough special bulk to tank many hits. Tera Fairy gives it a resistance to Fighting-, Dark-, and Dragon-type attacks from Heracross, Scrafty, and Flygon. However, Tera Water lets it better handle foes like Inteleon, Chandelure, and Hisuian Typhlosion. Tera Poison could also be used, as it allows Bronzong to check Fighting- and Poison-types like Mienshao, Toxicroak, and Alolan Muk, and it maintains Bronzong's immunity to both Toxic and the latter's Poison Touch.</p> <p>Wish passers like Vaporeon and Sylveon appreciate Bronzong for checking threats like Munkidori, Kilowattrel, and Porygon-Z. In return, they provide it recovery by passing it Wish. Bronzong greatly appreciates partners like Florges, Mienshao, Scrafty, and Alolan Muk, as they often bring in foes like Munkidori, Sylveon, and Flygon for Bronzong to take advantage of. Fighting- and Fairy-types like Mienshao, Paldean Tauros-F, Florges, and Diancie are great partners for Bronzong, as they can handle Dark-types like Incineroar and Scrafty, and the last three are good Knock Off absorbers; in return, Bronzong checks and can capitalize on bulky Poison-types like Galarian Slowbro, Vileplume, and Dragalge. Bronzong partners well with Dark-types like Incineroar, Alolan Muk, and Overqwil, as they can check Ghost-types such as Chandelure, Decidueye, and Brambleghast and bulky Psychic-types like Uxie and opposing Bronzong that it can struggle with. Fire-types like Hisuian Typhlosion, Rotom-H, and Incineroar can force Bronzong to switch out, so it best pairs with bulky Water- and Dragon-types like Vaporeon, Milotic, and Goodra to check them.</p>"

  "Toxicroak": {
    "overview": "<p>Toxicroak stands out for having the rare combination of Dry Skin and a great typing both offensively and defensively, which makes it the premier switch-in to Water-types like Vaporeon, Milotic, Paldean Tauros-W, Basculegion, and Inteleon. Toxicroak is also less susceptible to being revenge killed after it has set up; its access to priority moves makes it a lot harder to revenge kill despite its middling Speed. However, Toxicroak's biggest problem is its frailty; if it switches into any non-Water-type attack from these threats, it gets easily 2HKOed, but Toxicroak's good defensive typing gives it more opportunities to set up against foes like Vileplume, Choice Scarf Mienshao, and Tsareena. Toxicroak also struggles against physically defensive Ground- and Poison-types like Palossand, Galarian Slowbro, and Dragalge, as they can take both of its STAB attacks and proceed to threaten Toxicroak back with their own STAB moves. Additionally, Toxicroak also faces Fighting-type competition with Mienshao and Breloom, which are both stronger, making them more consistent at times.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf Toxicroak can outspeed common threats like Chandelure, Infernape, and Flygon. However, its moves are quite exploitable if it's locked into them, as Pokemon that resist or are immune to its attacks are common. Air Balloon gives Toxicroak a useful immunity to Ground-type attacks, giving it more opportunities to set up. Alternatively, Shuca Berry lets Toxicroak better lure in and damage Flygon and Swampert, as it's discreet; however, the majority of the time, Toxicroak prefers to run other items. Ice Punch allows Toxicroak to hit Ground- and Dragon-types like Gligar, Flygon, and Dragalge, but Toxicroak struggles to fit it. Encore allows Toxicroak to take advantage of bulky setup sweepers and entry hazard leads like Cresselia, Swampert, and Sylveon by giving it a free opportunity to set up either Swords Dance or Nasty Plot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Flygon, Swampert, and Gastrodon threaten Toxicroak with their STAB Ground-type attacks, but none of them want to switch into a boosted Close Combat or Focus Blast. Quagsire can shut down Toxicroak's sweeping attempts with Unaware and destroy it with a STAB Earthquake. However, Quagsire fares a bit worse against Nasty Plot Toxicroak. Gligar resists both of Toxicroak's STAB attacks and uses it to set up entry hazards or hits it back with Earthquake. Palossand is especially noteworthy, though, as it blanks Fighting-type attacks, resists Poison-type moves, and doesn't take too much from Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Galarian Slowbro and Dragalge resist both of Toxicroak's STAB attacks, and they can either set up or hit it back with their own STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Munkidori and Meloetta destroy Toxicroak with their powerful STAB attacks. However, none of them want to switch into a boosted Dark Pulse, and they can also be picked off by Sucker Punch. Indeedee-M will always win in a one-on-one against Toxicroak due to Psychic Terrain, but it can't switch in.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Close Combat is the preferred STAB option, allowing Toxicroak to 2HKO defensive walls like Alolan Muk and Klefki with Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Drain Punch helps provide more longevity against foes like Alolan Muk and Swampert, and it can counteract Life Orb chip if needed. Sucker Punch helps Toxicroak pick off revenge killers and weakened threats alike such as Munkidori and Flygon; Tera Dark allows Toxicroak to OHKO foes like Inteleon and Kilowattrel after a Swords Dance boost. Both Knock Off and Earthquake can be run in the last moveslot to hit checks like Palossand, Galarian Slowbro, and Dragalge harder, but Toxicroak's low Speed makes it prefer a priority move in most situations. A Jolly nature lets Toxicroak outspeed foes like Heracross and Chandelure, but an Adamant nature provides more wallbreaking power, allowing Toxicroak to OHKO Vileplume with a +2 Gunk Shot when it's boosted by Life Orb. Leftovers is the preferred item for Toxicroak, providing it needed recovery and letting it continually come in and check bulky Water-types. However, Life Orb provides Toxicroak a bit more extra wallbreaking power.</p> <p>Toxicroak best pairs with Pokemon that lure in bulkier Water-types such as Vaporeon and Milotic, so good partners would be Water-types like Inteleon and Basculegion and Fire-types like Incineroar and Talonflame, as all of them are able to pivot and give it a free switch into the aforementioned bulky Water-types. Inteleon is a noteworthy partner, as it checks the common Ground- and Fire-types like Flygon, Gligar, and Chandelure, and it can actually pivot on Water-immune Pokemon thanks to its access to U-turn, helping Inteleon keep up momentum. In return, Toxicroak can take advantage of bulky Water- and Grass-types such as Vaporeon, Tentacruel, and Tsareena. Toxicroak gets threatened by Psychic-types such as Indeedee-M, Meloetta, and Munkidori, so it pairs well with Dark- and Steel-types like Umbreon, Incineroar, and Bronzong that check the aforementioned Psychic-types. Poison-types like Dragalge and Galarian Slowbro can cause many problems for Toxicroak, making Psychic- and Ground-types like Meloetta, Flygon, and Swampert great partners. Ground-immune Pokemon like Talonflame, Rotom-C, and Bronzong are great partners for Toxicroak, as they are able to check Ground-types such as Flygon and Swampert.

A Timid nature allows Toxicroak to outspeed foes like non-Choice Scarf Chandelure and Basculegion, but a Modest nature allows it to OHKO foes like Swampert with a +2 Focus Blast. Life Orb is preferred for its immediate power, allowing Toxicroak to always 2HKO foes like Swampert and Sylveon, but Leftovers can provide Toxicroak needed recovery over the course of the battle. Tera Dark boosts the power of Dark Pulse while giving Toxicroak an immunity to Psychic-type attacks from Meloetta and Munkidori.

Adaptability also adds on to its already insane power, letting it 2HKO common special walls like Incineroar and, after Stealth Rock, Alolan Muk as well. Download can turn common physical walls like Galarian Slowbro, Scream Tail, and Vaporeon into switch-in opportunities, though. On top of that, Porygon-Z only requires Shadow Ball the majority of the time as a coverage option to complement its STAB move, freeing up its other moveslots. Since Porygon-Z has access to Trick, it isn't completely stonewalled by special walls like Registeel, Bronzong, and Diancie that well either; it can capitalize on them being locked into a status move with one of either Nasty Plot, Agility, or Recover, and because they now lack their only form of recovery in Leftovers, chipping them over time will be quite easy. Porygon-Z's frailty is quite apparent in battle, though, forcing it to rely on pivots to switch in safely. Common fast Pokemon like Munkidori, Flygon, Kilowattrel, and Inteleon can take advantage of its somewhat middling Speed tier as well, threatening to KO or force it out.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Porygon-Z can run Choice Scarf to become a revenge killer and cleaner, but most common Choice Scarf users like Flygon, Munkidori, and Infernape outspeed and threaten it with a KO. Porygon-Z can opt for Silk Scarf on Nasty Plot sets for extra damage on Tri Attack and its pre-Terastallization Tera Blast, boosting its ability to wallbreak. Porygon-Z can take advantage of Sitrus Berry really well with Nasty Plot and especially Double Dance sets, and it can even forego a fully offensive EV spread in favor of a more defensive one so that it can pull off both an Agility and a Nasty Plot easily. Thunderbolt and Ice Beam can be run on Choice Specs sets. However, the utility of its last two moveslots is more useful overall. Choice Specs sets can also use Hyper Beam as a sort of nuke button that's able to chip away at Steel- and Rock-types heavily, but this leaves it wide open the next turn. Porygon-Z can opt to run Tera Fairy over Tera Ghost so that it can resist Scrappy Flamigo's Close Combat. However, this makes it noticeably worse against other Fighting-types like Toxicroak and the Paldean Tauros formes.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Pokemon like Copperajah, Klefki, Registeel, and Bronzong can all switch in on Porygon-Z quite freely, and they can all take advantage of it by setting up entry hazards. On top of that, the latter two can use it as a setup opportunity, and Klefki and Registeel can cripple it with Thunder Wave. However, the former three must watch out for Tera Blast Ground, and Bronzong must be cautious about switching into a Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Hisuian Typhlosion and both Choice Scarf Chandelure and Basculegion-M outspeed Porygon-Z and can capitalize on its use of Tri Attack, as they are immune and can retaliate with high-Base Power attacks, which are further bolstered by their high offenses. Brambleghast can also do the same, but it risks losing a Speed tie, and all Ghost-types need to be cautious about possibly switching into a Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Porygon-Z's middling Speed and frailty can be taken advantage of by quite a few Pokemon faster than it like Flygon, Paldean Tauros-W, Kilowattrel, and Munkidori. Notably, Choice Scarf Flamigo outspeeds non-Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, and since Flamigo runs Scrappy, it doesn't fear using Close Combat against a possible Tera Ghost Porygon-Z either. On top of that, priority moves can easily KO it, if not after a bit of chip damage beforehand, so it must be cautious with Breloom's Mach Punch, Basculegion-M's Aqua Jet, and Toxicroak's Sucker Punch.</p>",

Shadow Ball allows Porygon-Z to hit Ghost-types like Brambleghast, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Chandelure that are immune to its Tri Attack, and it hits Bronzong, a common switch-in. Trick allows Porygon-Z to cripple defensive switch-ins like Bronzong, Diancie, and Alolan Muk. Since Porygon-Z has all the coverage it needs from its first two attacks, it runs more situational moves for its last moveslot to choose how to take advantage of Trick and free turns. Nasty Plot allows it to still break through walls like Incineroar, Alolan Muk, and Bronzong; Agility lets it become a late-game sweeper after it has already worn down opposing walls; and Recover lets it wallbreak repeatedly, letting it not worry as much about both chip and entry hazard damage. Tera Ghost turns Porygon-Z's weakness to Fighting into an immunity, meaning it can get free turns to attack against Body Press Bronzong and Paldean Tauros formes, while boosting Shadow Ball. Adaptability is Porygon-Z's preferred ability, as it allows Porygon-Z to reliably break through even special walls like Alolan Muk, Incineroar, and Diancie. On the other hand, Download can be used to take advantage of common physical walls like Milotic, Sylveon, and Galarian Slowbro better.</p> <p>Since Porygon-Z easily draws in and chips Rock- and Steel-types, partners that can take advantage of this like Kilowattrel, Munkidori, Nasty Plot Uxie, and Trick Room Diancie synergize well. Especially if Porygon-Z is using Download, it appreciates pivots like Flygon, Flamigo, and Gligar, since they bring it in on physical walls like Amoonguss, Galarian Slowbro, and Swampert, which it can threaten out. The former two pivots, along with Basculegion-M, are also great partners for creating a wallbreaking core with Porygon-Z, handling the Steel- and Rock-types like Registeel and Diancie that can check it. Porygon-Z can achieve many 2HKOs, but the majority of them require some chip damage beforehand; because of this, entry hazard setters like Klefki, Bronzong, and Swampert make for good partners. Additionally, Porygon-Z is forced out by Fighting-types like Flamigo, Breloom, and the Paldean Tauros formes, so switch-ins such as Sylveon, Amoonguss, Galarian Slowbro, and Dragalge make for good teammates.

Shadow Ball allows Porygon-Z to hit Ghost-types like Decidueye, Basculegion-M, and Chandelure that are immune to its Tri Attack. Thunderbolt hits Rock- and Steel-types that Porygon-Z struggles with, is a strong neutral move against most of the tier, and can clear Water-types like Milotic and Vaporeon easily. Nasty Plot can be used over Agility if Porygon-Z aims to solely break through bulkier teams; however, using it over Thunderbolt allows Porygon-Z to decide which setup move is more rewarding depending on the situation. If Porygon-Z is running Nasty Plot over Agility, Recover can be used instead of Thunderbolt to improve its matchup against balance and bulkier builds. Life Orb provides more wallbreaking power at the cost of constant chip damage, letting it achieve OHKOs on Sylveon and Dragalge with Tri Attack after Stealth Rock at +2, and it gives Porygon-Z a high chance of OHKOing Bronzong with Shadow Ball and Incineroar as well as Alolan Muk with Tri Attack. However, Leftovers provides passive recovery for Porygon-Z, letting it both attack and set up more. Heavy-Duty Boots could also be used, since it lets Porygon-Z ignore crippling entry hazards like Sticky Web and Spikes. Download is preferred, as it can boost Porygon-Z's Special Attack, providing it with a damage boost that it can take advantage of with Agility. Additionally, for Double Dance sets, it means Porygon-Z isn't always forced to use Nasty Plot. On the other hand, Adaptability could be used to increase its reliability at weakening specially defensive Steel- and Rock-types like Copperajah, Registeel, and Diancie. Tera Ghost boosts Shadow Ball while turning Porygon-Z's Fighting weakness into an immunity, which gives it a free turn to setup against or attack Paldean Tauros formes and Body Press Bronzong. On the other hand, Tera Electric lets Porygon-Z hit Steel-types with a powerful neutral STAB Thunderbolt, gives it an immunity to Porygon2's as well as Klefki's Thunder Wave, and allows Porygon-Z to turn Kilowattrel into setup fodder.</p> <p>Porygon-Z has issues with KOing Steel- and Rock-types like Copperajah, Registeel, and Diancie one-on-one, so leads that set entry hazards like Froslass and Brambleghast or other Pokemon that do the same like Klefki, Gligar, and Swampert make for great teammates. Pokemon like Munkidori, Trick Room Diancie, Booster Energy Calm Mind Scream Tail, and Life Orb Kilowattrel have great synergy, as they can help overwhelm these shared checks. On sets lacking Agility, Porygon-Z enjoys Sticky Web support from Galvantula. Setup sweepers like Paldean Tauros-W, Flygon, and Breloom force in physical walls like Sylveon, Orthworm, and Vileplume, and if these partners get KOed, Porygon-Z can get a Special Attack boost from Download when coming in on these walls.

    "overview": "<p>Uxie's deep movepool and solid bulk carve a role out for it as either a bulky setup sweeper or utility pivot. Nasty Plot sets have an easy time setting up thanks to Uxie's high defensive stats, which also make them good candidates for defensive Terastallization. Options like Encore, U-turn, Stealth Rock, and Knock Off make Uxie an excellent role compressor. However, Uxie's mediocre Special Attack makes it very passive unless it's set up multiple times, and it struggles to break through common Steel-types like Bronzong and Copperajah even after setting up. Uxie's passivity means its utility sets are easily taken advantage of by common Dark-types like Incineroar, Overqwil, and Alolan Muk. The mono-Psychic typing does few favors for Uxie defensively, which can make it reliant on Terastallization to reliably sweep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Nasty Plot Uxie can invest more EVs into its bulk to make it more difficult to take out, but doing so makes Uxie both far more passive and reliant on multiple Nasty Plot boosts to sweep. Said set can consider using Psyshock over Psychic Noise to hit specially defensive foes like Goodra and Dragalge much harder. Pivot sets can use Future Sight over Psychic Noise to put its teammates in even better positions against pressured foes. Utility Uxie can function as a setter for rain, sun, and Trick Room teams with Stealth Rock and Memento, though such dedicated teams tend to be more niche.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Setup Uxie sets are almost incapable of beating Steel-types on their own without setting up several times, locking them into ineffective moves with Encore, and keeping up pressure with Psychic Noise. Utility sets are too passive to beat Steel-types at all, but Bronzong and Copperajah dislike losing their Leftovers to Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Nasty Plot Uxie cannot break through Alolan Muk and is vulnerable to its Poison Jab after Terastallizing, and its utility sets are similarly walled by it. Incineroar also checks Uxie, but it especially dislikes losing its item to Knock Off, and it can be overwhelmed by Uxie Terastallizing.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Basculegion-M, Chandelure, and Brambleghast all threaten Uxie, but they should be wary of Knock Off from utility sets.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: If Nasty Plot Uxie is not behind Substitute, then Munkidori and Gligar can at least put it on a timer. Utility sets are especially vulnerable to users like Goodra and Amoonguss punishing it given their lack of recovery beyond Leftovers.</p>",

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Psychic Noise helps Uxie suffocate walls like Milotic, Gastrodon, and Vaporon, somewhat compensating for its passivity. Draining Kiss covers Dark-types, but it's primarily used in tandem with Terastallization to increase Uxie's longevity. Encore can shut down walls and utility Pokemon like Bronzong and Gligar by locking them into utility moves, creating opportunities for Uxie to use them as setup fodder and eventually overwhelm them. Uxie can similarly use Encore against slower offensive Pokemon like Swampert and Breloom to force them into repeatedly using less effective attacks against it, opening windows for itself to sweep. Substitute protects Uxie from slower Toxic users like Gligar and Bellibolt, helping maintain its great longevity as it sweeps, and it can proceed to use them as opportunities to set up. Uxie also has more breathing room against revenge killers like Paldean Tauros-W and Scyther when it's protected by Substitute. Shadow Ball allows Uxie to blow past a would-be wall in Bronzong, though it comes at the cost of the utility of other status moves. Grassy Seed is exclusively for Grassy Terrain teams, and the Defense boost it grants makes Uxie much more difficult for physical attackers like Paldean Tauros-W to revenge kill, and it can open up the possibility for Uxie to run Stored Power over Psychic Noise. Tera Fairy powers up Draining Kiss and gives Uxie a great defensive typing, one that notably resists its usual weaknesses to Dark and Bug. Uxie can use Flygon as setup fodder once it's Terastallized.</p> <p>Uxie is a much-needed defensive backbone for hyper offense teams, flexing both its great bulk and capability to stallbreak against Milotic and Gastrodon. Fellow setup sweepers like Scyther, Dragon Dance Flygon, and Shift Gear Toxtricity can blow holes in teams to get Uxie in position for its own sweep. Uxie can beat physical walls like Avalugg that Scyther and Flygon struggle against, while they can break past special walls like Alolan Muk. Special setup sweepers like Scream Tail can work with Uxie to overwhelm their shared checks like Bronzong and Copperajah. As many of Uxie's answers are grounded, Klefki and other Spikes setters support it well. Alolan Ninetales can set dual screens for Uxie to give it greater windows for accumulating multiple boosts. Both Alolan Ninetales and Cinccino can create additional opportunities for Uxie to set up by using Encore on foes. On Grassy Terrain teams, Thwackey is mandatory as support, and it can get Uxie into comfortable positions to set up thanks to U-turn, Knock Off, and Taunt. Other Pokemon that appear on Terrain teams, including Diancie, Cinccino, and Oricorio-P, can weaken Steel-types, while Arcanine and Paldean Tauros-F destroy Steel-types.</p>"

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Uxie is a decent bulky pivot capable of compressing plenty of utility onto one set. As Uxie isn't an especially strong attacker, Psychic Noise is helpful to smother bulkier Pokemon with recovery moves, such as Vaporeon and Gastrodon. Knock Off punishes Pokemon that depend on their items, such as Gligar, Alolan Muk, and Incineroar. Uxie's ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from entry hazard removers like Avalugg and Altaria makes it an especially effective hazard setter. Uxie's ability to subject a foe to Encore and pivot out with U-turn makes it an especially adept support option. Thunder Wave especially annoys faster Pokemon like Scream Tail and Scyther, and it especially deters them from using Uxie as setup fodder. Heavy-Duty Boots helps to preserve Uxie's health, as it pivots out frequently and takes chip damage from Stealth Rock, while Leftovers can better benefit Uxie's longevity on teams with decent hazard control. 216 Speed EVs and a Timid nature give Uxie enough Speed to outrun Flamigo and other base 90 Speed Pokemon like Brambleghast. Tera Dark flips Uxie's Dark and Ghost weaknesses into resistances to potentially let it handle Toxicroak, Chandelure, and Basculegion-M in a pinch, and it boosts Knock Off's damage. Tera Steel has better synergy with Levitate, lets Uxie wall Flygon, and grants it a useful Toxic immunity and many resistances.</p> <p>Uxie's entry hazards and pivoting are appreciated by wallbreakers like Paldean Tauros-W, Basculegion-M, and Chandelure, and they can make up for Uxie's passivity thanks to their great power. Setup sweepers like Flygon and Scyther similarly benefit from hazards, the safer positioning provided by U-turn, and Uxie's Encore and Thunder Wave creating opportunities for safer setup. Other pivots, such as Kilowattrel, Toxtricity, and Incineroar can form pivot cores with Uxie and catch foes in the vortex. Incineroar notably checks Dark-types and Ghost-types for Uxie, while Uxie can handle Fighting-types for it. Wish users like Vaporeon and Sylveon can supplement Uxie's otherwise lacking recovery. Dark-types are problematic for Uxie, so wallbreakers like Paldean Tauros-W, Flygon, and Nasty Plot Alolan Ninetales are welcome teammates. Dark-resistant walls like Alolan Muk, Sylveon, and Diancie also cover for Uxie.</p>"

Giga Drain offers a form of recovery and hits Water-types like Vaporeon and Swampert while Memento paves the way for Whimsicott's teammates to set up for a sweep of their own and Leech Seed lets Whimsicott bother bulky switch-ins like Copperajah, Bronzong, and Galarian Slowbro. 68 Speed EVs allows Whimsicott to outpace Chandelure.</p>"}}},
  "Scrafty": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its solid mixed bulk, many resistances, and great abilities, Scrafty is a potent setup sweeper. Both Bulk Up and Dragon Dance sets are major setup threats because of Scrafty's access to STAB Knock Off, Close Combat, and Drain Punch for great overall power, utility, and sustainability. Staple Pokemon like Alolan Muk and Amoonguss can be setup fodder for Scrafty, letting it prey on common defensive cores. Bulk Up turns Scrafty into a bulky booster that can overwhelm defensive cores relying on Swampert and Bronzong. Dragon Dance sets can snowball out of control and use Scrafty's great bulk to secure multiple boosts. Scrafty is an especially good user of Terastallization, as it's bulky and enabled by flipping its few major weaknesses into resistances. Shed Skin is a fantastic ability to make status users like Vaporeon and Galarian Slowbro insecure checks to Scrafty, and Scrafty even has other good abilities like Intimidate and Moxie to facilitate its sweeping. However, Scrafty has major vulnerabilities to Fairy-types like Diancie and Scream Tail and Fighting-type revenge killers like Paldean Tauros-W and Paldean Tauros-F, so it's often pressured to exhaust Terastallization. Dragon Dance sets can struggle if they don't have the opportunity to acquire multiple boosts, and Bulk Up sets can be overwhelmed by strong special attackers like Toxtricity and Sylveon. Scrafty's low Speed trips it up by making it vulnerable to Encore and Taunt, and its average Attack makes it even more prone to Trick and phazing.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Punch hits Flying- and Dragon-types like Altaria, Gligar, and Flygon very hard, but Scrafty struggles to fit it for this one matchup over its coverage moves for Fairy-types. Tera Ghost is an option for a useful immunity against Fighting-types like Paldean Tauros-W and Body Press users like Bronzong, potentially turning them into setup fodder or giving Scrafty a critical turn where it doesn't have to take any damage when it's weakened.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Diancie can OHKO Scrafty with Moonblast and is capable of beating it with Body Press and boosts from Diamond Storm. However, Diancie can be overwhelmed due to its dependence on Leftovers for recovery and lack of Fighting resistance. Klefki can force Bulk Up sets to either Terastallize or fall to Dazzling Gleam, but Dragon Dance Scrafty can threaten to OHKO Klefki with +1 Close Combat after Spikes damage. Calm Mind and lead Scream Tail variants can both beat Scrafty, but utility sets are setup fodder for Dragon Dance Scrafty. Fairy-types like Sylveon and Florges and Tera Fairy users like Uxie and Milotic should stay wary of Scrafty's coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Flamigo, Toxicroak, and Heracross all deal major damage to Scrafty with their STAB moves and resist both of Scrafty's STAB types. Paldean Tauros-F and Paldean Tauros-W can run Choice Scarf to outspeed Dragon Dance Scrafty variants, and they both soften it up with Intimidate. Breloom and Infernape can both pick off weakened Scrafty with Mach Punch.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Scyther, Galarian Articuno, and Kilowattrel both outspeed and threaten Scrafty with their super effective STAB attacks, and the last one even outspeeds Jolly Scrafty at +1. Neither of these Pokemon, or most Flying-types in general, enjoy switching into Knock Off. Gligar can beat Dragon Dance sets in a vacuum, but it can lose to Bulk Up sets. Trapper Altaria sets can remove Scrafty with Perish Song.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Toxicroak and Amoonguss both resist Scrafty's Fighting-type moves; Toxicroak can hit Scrafty back hard with Fighting-type moves, and Amoonguss is bulky enough to chip down Scrafty with Sludge Bomb and Giga Drain. However, Amoonguss can lose to Shed Skin Bulk Up Scrafty sets.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal and Disruption</strong>: Chandelure, Munkidori, and Meloetta can cripple Scrafty with a Choice item if they're not able to KO it, leaving it exploitable. Fast Encore users like Scream Tail, Cinccino, and Uxie can force Scrafty to repeatedly set up or use Rest, which enables them and their teammates to begin exploiting it.</p>",

      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Drain Punch's healing makes Scrafty less reliant on Rest. Knock Off is especially useful to soften up Gligar and punish Scrafty's checks, including Scyther, Diancie, and Altaria. Throat Chop stops Sylveon from using Hyper Voice and prevents Bronzong from using Psychic Noise if Scrafty has Terastallized into a Poison-type. Rest is less passive on Scrafty than other Pokemon thanks to Shed Skin's potential to wake up Scrafty early, and it's helpful both as a recovery move and immediate method to heal status. The EV spread allows Scrafty to outpace foes like Vaporeon and Sylveon. Shed Skin has good synergy with Rest and keeps Scrafty healthier against status spreaders like Alolan Muk, Gligar, and Vaporeon. Both Tera Poison and Tera Steel flip Scrafty's problematic 4x Fairy weakness into a resistance, which improves its matchups against Diancie, Sylveon, and Scream Tail. Tera Poison helps Scrafty against Fighting-types like Toxicroak and opposing Scrafty, while Tera Steel is more useful against Alolan Ninetales and Kilowattrel.</p> <p>Scrafty is unlikely to sweep unless Fairy-types like Scream Tail, Florges, and Sylveon have been weakened. Bronzong, Klefki, and Orthworm check Fairy-types for Scrafty, and they can set entry hazards to wear down Diancie and Amoonguss. Ground-types like Flygon, Gastrodon, and Swampert can handle Poison-types like Toxtricity and Toxicroak for Scrafty. Spikes setters like Klekfi, Gligar, and Orthworm are especially good at making sure foes like Amoonguss are softened up for Scrafty, and Scrafty's Knock Off synergizes with them by removing Heavy-Duty Boots. Specially defensive Pokemon like Diancie, Bronzong, and Porygon2 are great answers to problematic special attackers like Alolan Ninetales, Kilowattrel, and Chandelure that can pressure Scrafty with their super effective and powerful STAB moves, and the former two walls can set up hazards for Scrafty as well. Physical walls like Galarian Slowbro, Vaporeon, and Gligar support Scrafty by handling physical attackers like Paldean Tauros-F, Incineroar, and Flamigo.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Drain Punch helps keep Scrafty healthy enough to stay out of range of priority users like Basculegion-M and Choice Scarf revenge killers like Flygon. Knock Off can be helpful to soften up checks to Scrafty such as Scream Tail, Gligar, and Sylveon so that Scrafty can more easily sweep past them late-game. Throat Chop lacks Knock Off's general utility and initial additional power, but its effect of disabling sound-based moves helps against foes like Sylveon and Toxtricity. Scrafty can run Encore to navigate around problematic foes like Milotic and Vaporeon, and it can turn passive walls like Avalugg and Amoonguss into setup fodder. Poison Jab is preferred as a coverage move for its synergy with Tera Poison, but Iron Head nails Alolan Ninetales and Diancie. Similarly to Drain Punch, Leftovers helps keep Scrafty out of range of revenge killers like Basculegion-M. However, a Lum Berry is very helpful for non-Shed Skin sets to help against status spreaders like Gligar, Incineroar, and Klefki if Scrafty Terastallizes. Shed Skin makes Scrafty less prone to status spreaders like Incineroar, Gligar, and Alolan Muk, which can also open Scrafty up to use these Pokemon as setup fodder. Intimidate creates windows for Scrafty to set up more easily against physical attackers like Flygon and Swampert. Moxie helps Scrafty to snowball with boosts and punish opponents who eagerly sack Pokemon against it. Tera Poison helps Scrafty match up better against Fairy-types, Fighting-type revenge killers like Paldean Tauros-W, and Body Press users such as Bronzong. Tera Steel shares Tera Poison's offensive and defensive qualities against Fairy-types while giving Scrafty a better defensive typing against Flying-types like Kilowattrel and Psychic-types like Uxie.</p> <p>Scrafty is a good fit for offense and balance teams as a wincon that isn't lacking a defensive backbone. Sets with Shed Skin are especially valuable as status absorbers. Scrafty can take advantage of Alolan Muk, which is appreciated by Psychic-types like Scream Tail, Oricorio-P, and Bronzong. Psychic-type pivots like Munkidori and Uxie are excellent at drawing in Alolan Muk for Scrafty and giving it free entry with their pivot moves. Setup sweepers like Flygon, Scyther, and Diancie can all overwhelm Fairy- and Poison-type walls for Scrafty. In return, Scrafty can beat Steel-types like Bronzong for the three aforementioned Pokemon. Fast Encore users like Scream Tail and Cinccino can lock passive Pokemon like Bronzong and Amoonguss into moves that let Scrafty use them as setup fodder. Alolan Ninetales supports Scrafty with Aurora Veil and Encore to widen its opportunities for setting up. Steel- and Poison-type teammates like Klefki and Toxtricity can handle Fairy-types like Scream Tail and Sylveon.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Cinccino's blistering Speed and access to Technician, which it can fully take advantage of with Loaded Dice, make it a dangerous setup sweeper that can end games as easily as it can wallbreak for its partners. Passive Pokemon that might try to take advantage of Cinccino like Orthworm and Bronzong aren't safe from it either, as Cinccino can lock them into setting up entry hazards or using Iron Defense with its Encore, giving it free turns to boost with Tidy Up. On top of that, after a turn of setup, its myriad of coverage moves lets it beat anything from Flygon to Swampert easily. However, Cinccino has terrible four-moveslot syndrome, and its STAB move can be easily punished by common Rocky Helmet users like Amoonguss and Galarian Slowbro. Pokemon like Inteleon and Choice Scarf Mienshao can outpace it and threaten it with a KO, but they fail to check it after it boosts. Cinccino's Tidy Up is also a double-edged sword, as it needs the power to achieve many of its KOs, but in using the move, it removes the hazards that were helping limit its switch-ins in the first place, making it somewhat difficult to fit on many teams. Cinccino also struggles to find setup opportunities due its frailty typically only letting it survive one hit.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Protective Pads could be run to not be vulnerable to contact punishment, but with how Cinccino is then forced to use Skill Link, it becomes weaker. On teams that would like an offensive form of entry hazard control, Heavy-Duty Boots + Skill Link can be run on Cinccino alongside U-turn, letting it reliably remove hazards and bring in a wallbreaker for incoming Steel-types. However, the weaker power, along with the fact that there are better hazard removal options generally, causes it to be unused. Tera Blast Fire can be utilized on Cinccino to hit Rocky Helmet Amoonguss and Steel-types like Orthworm and Copperajah, which it can have trouble dealing with otherwise, but Tera Blast being a wasted moveslot before Terastallization means that it's generally worse overall.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Orthworm, Registeel, and Copperajah can take all of Cinccino's attacks comfortably and retaliate with a Body Press or powerful Iron Head; on top of that, the latter two can even paralyze and phaze it, respectively. Bronzong can also wall Cinccino and retaliate with Body Press, but it must beware of Knock Off. If any of them set up entry hazards or used Iron Defense as Cinccino came in, they are easily beat one-on-one due to its Encore.</p> <p><strong>Contact Punishment</strong>: Pokemon like Flame Body Chandelure and Static Bellibolt can all cripple Cinccino with a burn or paralysis, and Rocky Helmet users like Overqwil, Amoonguss, and Galarian Slowbro can chip away heavily at Cinccino if it uses Tail Slap, opening it up to being revenge killed even more easily. However, Cinccino can run Rock Blast to take out Chandelure and Knock Off to remove these crippling items.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Fast Pokemon, such as Inteleon and Kilowattrel, and Choice Scarf users, like Infernape and Munkidori, outspeed Cinccino and can threaten it with a KO if Cinccino hasn't boosted yet. On top of that, Pokemon with priority like Mach Punch Breloom and First Impression Flygon can revenge kill Cinccino as well. However, for some of these revenge killers, Cinccino can Terastallize into a Ghost-type and use Encore, which then provides it with setup opportunities.</p>",

Encore allows Cinccino to take advantage of passive Pokemon like Swampert, Bronzong, and Palossand that use Stealth Rock or heal up, which gifts it more setup opportunities. It also helps Cinccino handle slower setup sweepers like Calm Mind Sylveon and Iron Defense Registeel and Bronzong. Alternatively, Endeavor can be used on Focus Sash sets to heavily dent these same Steel-types for partners like Oricorio-P, Scyther, and Alolan Ninetales, and Triple Axel can be used as a strong coverage move to nail Brambleghast, Gligar, Flygon, and Dragalge. A Cinccino that aims to sweep teams should run Loaded Dice + Technician for maximum damage output. In contrast, if it chooses to be a dedicated lead, Focus Sash + Skill Link allows it to take advantage of both Tidy Up's entry hazard-clearing potential and its multi-hit moves. Tera Ghost allows Cinccino to become immune to Choice Scarf Paldean Tauros-W's as well as Infernape's Close Combat, and it lets Cinccino blank Breloom's Mach Punch and take advantage of it with Encore, giving Cinccino free turns to set up.</p> <p>Cinccino struggles with breaking through Steel-types like Copperajah, Orthworm, and Registeel, so partners such as Alolan Ninetales, Oricorio-P, Diancie, and Munkidori pair well, as they can help overwhelm these shared checks. Teammates that can benefit from Cinccino's Tidy Up removing hazards like Air Balloon Chandelure, Weakness Policy Incineroar, Choice Scarf Staraptor, and Life Orb Kilowattrel enjoy its presence; on top of that, the former two can handle Steel-types easily with their STAB moves, whereas the latter two can help wear them down. Terrain teams can also take advantage of Cinccino's hazard clearing, as common Terrain sweepers like Oricorio-P, Arcanine, and Grafaiai enjoy not being chipped by hazards. Due to them not being as concerned about Cinccino's Tidy Up removing their hazards, Stealth Rock leads like Eject Pack Flygon and Booster Energy Scream Tail pair best with it. Spikes leads like Froslass and Brambleghast can help wear down checks like Orthworm and Copperajah, and a Sticky Web lead like Galvantula can help Cinccino outspeed Choice Scarf users like Infernape, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Munkidori; however, these teams must be wise about when to send out Cinccino to ensure their hazards aren't completely wasted. Physical walls that carry a way to punish contact moves through their ability like Bellibolt or item users like Rocky Helmet Amoonguss and Galarian Slowbro are issues for Cinccino, so teammates with access to Knock Off such as Incineroar and Heracross can help deal with these walls. Cinccino's frailty often hinders its ability to set up, so partners that can create opportunities like Memento Chandelure or slow pivots like Dragalge and Incineroar are greatly appreciated.</p>"

Additionally, with access to Stun Spore and Toxic as well as with Sludge Bomb's high poison chance, Amoonguss spreads status quite easily, letting it even make progress against checks like Incineroar, Chandelure, and Scyther. One of the main issues with Amoonguss, though, is that it lets in Poison-types like Munkidori, Toxicroak, and Toxtricity very freely, and its inability to do much back to them turns it into a liability at times, since they can easily use it as setup fodder. What's more, Amoonguss's weakness to top threats like Alolan Ninetales, Chandelure, Kilowattrel, and Uxie also holds it back quite a bit, and many of the Pokemon that it'd like to check, such as Flamigo, Decidueye, Paldean Tauros-F, and Toxicroak often carry a second typing and STAB attack that invalidates Amoonguss's ability to switch in against them at all.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Amoonguss can use Assault Vest to capitalize on its good resistances, letting it better handle attackers like Inteleon, Sylveon, and Diancie.

However, if Amoonguss carries Stomping Tantrum, it can mitigate their ability to capitalize on it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Amoonguss can't touch Chandelure, Incineroar, and Hisuian Typhlosion too well, meaning they can switch in freely, though they must be cautious of being paralyzed or poisoned.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Tornadus, Kilowattrel, Scyther, and Galarian Articuno all can switch in on a Grass-type attack from Amoonguss and threaten it out with their powerful Flying-type attacks.

However, the former three loathe switching into it for fear of Sludge Bomb, Toxic, and Stun Spore, while the last dislikes taking a Stomping Tantrum.

Foul Play aids versus physical setup sweepers and wallbreakers like Cinccino, Flygon, and Decidueye. On the other hand, Stomping Tantrum can ensure that Amoonguss isn't walled and taken advantage of by Poison-types like Toxicroak, Alolan Muk, and Toxtricity. Toxic and Stun Spore let Amoonguss cripple setup sweepers like Incineroar, Paldean Tauros-F, Scyther, and Overqwil, while Synthesis provides a reliable source of healing so that Amoonguss doesn't have to rely solely on Giga Drain and Regenerator. Additionally, due to Stomping Tantrum clearing the Poison- and Steel-types immune to poison, it has great synergy with Toxic. Heavy-Duty Boots guarantees that Amoonguss's Regenerator isn't just rendered moot by entry hazards, but Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers like Paldean Tauros-W, Basculegion-M, and Breloom. Eject Button is also a useful item on Amoonguss, since Amoonguss can immediately recover health by switching out thanks to its Regenerator, and it can bring in a teammate safely on the field. This is largely appreciated by rain teams, which enjoy having their rain sweepers at high health. The given EV spread allows Amoonguss to survive a Bleakwind Storm from Tornadus. Tera Water lets Amoonguss take Ice- and Fire-type attacks from Alolan Ninetales, Avalugg, Inteleon, Chandelure, and Paldean Tauros-F. Tera Steel, though, lets it take a myriad of special attacks, including Inteleon's Ice Beam, Tornadus's Hurricane, Munkidori's Psychic, and Porygon-Z's Tri Attack. Alternatively, Tera Fairy is a great defensive typing that also maintains Amoonguss's Fighting resistance while making it better into Flygon, Heracross, and Scyther.</p> <p>Opposing Poison-types like Toxicroak, Munkidori, and Toxtricity can be quite problematic for Amoonguss, since they easily switch into it and can use it as setup fodder. Because of this, Pokemon like Gligar, Bronzong, and Porygon2 make for good teammates. Common Fighting-weak Pokemon like Registeel, Incineroar, and Avalugg pair well with Amoonguss, as it can check Breloom, Paldean Tauros-W, and Heracross. Partners like Milotic, Vaporeon, and Goodra pair well with Amoonguss, handling dangerous Fire-types like Paldean Tauros-F, Incineroar, and Chandelure. On the other hand, offensive Water- and Ground-types like Inteleon, Basculegion-M, and Flygon pair well with Amoonguss, since they can capitalize on how it draws in these Fire-types. Amoonguss's ability to spread status like poison and paralysis with Sludge Bomb, Toxic, and Stun Spore onto Pokemon like Incineroar, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Munkidori is highly appreciated by slower wallbreakers like Chandelure and Heracross. Additionally, Hisuian Typhlosion and Chandelure can take advantage of the status ailments that Amoonguss inflicts on the opposing team with their Infernal Parade and Hex, respectively. Partners like Paldean Tauros-F, Chandelure, and Inteleon enjoy Amoonguss's Water and Grass resistances, letting it be a switch-in to Vaporeon, Paldean Tauros-W, and Breloom, and in the case of the former two, it can also check Flygon for them. Amoonguss sets lacking Heavy-Duty Boots can be easily overwhelmed by having to take both strong attacks from wallbreakers like Flygon and chip damage from entry hazards. To patch this issue, Amoonguss should be paired with hazard removal options like Tidy Up Cinccino, Defog Cramorant as well as Altaria, and Rapid Spin Avalugg.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>By setting up Sticky Web, Galvantula can enable wallbreakers like Torterra, Indeedee-M, and Paldean Tauros-W that are otherwise easily revenge killed by faster Pokemon like Inteleon, Choice Scarf Mienshao, and Choice Scarf Hisuian Typhlosion. Galvantula also spreads paralysis quite easily with both Thunder and Thunder Wave. Galvantula, however, can be outsped and KOed by Pokemon with multi-hit moves like Scale Shot Flygon and Triple Axel Mienshao. Notably, Tsareena, one of the best hazard removers the tier has to offer, can use Rapid Spin to clear Sticky Web and then proceed to outspeed and KO Galvantula with Triple Axel or Knock Off the next turn. Another hurdle for Galvantula to overcome is Magic Bounce Espeon, as it always survives one hit from Galvantula as it switches in and can get severe damage off on it before bringing in a revenge killer to finish it off.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lunge or Pounce can be used to simultaneously ease setup for Galvantula's partners and prevent it from being taken advantage of as easily. Volt Switch can also be run to circumvent Galvantula's passivity by letting it pivot, and it can save Sticky Web for later if the hazard is removed. Energy Ball can be run to hit Pokemon like Diancie and specially defensive Swampert, but dropping Thunder Wave makes Galvantula quite passive overall. Swarm can be used over Compound Eyes with Thunderbolt replacing Thunder, as Galvantula can then OHKO Espeon with Bug Buzz after being knocked into Swarm range by Psychic. Infestation can be used to trap slower Pokemon, preventing any needless predictions to cover an opponent's switch to Magic Bounce Espeon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Control</strong>: Due to Galvantula almost always being a lead, it can be easily countered by entry hazard control. Specifically, Magic Bounce Espeon, Taunt Iron Thorns, Defog Talonflame, and Rapid Spin Tsareena can all thwart hazard setting attempts by Galvantula and KO it without difficulty.</p> <p><strong>Multi-hit Moves</strong>: Some Pokemon carry Focus Sash-breaking multi-hit moves like Tsareena and Mienshao, which can run Triple Axel, and certain setup sweepers like Cinccino, Torterra, and Flygon, which typically run Tail Slap, Rock Blast, and Scale Shot, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Flygon and Torterra can easily boost in front of Galvantula, as they are not OHKOed and can KO Galvantula the next turn with their multi-hit moves. Since Energy Ball is quite rare on Galvantula, Diancie, Quagsire, and specially defensive Swampert can take advantage of it as well by setting their own hazards.</p>",

Thunder + Compound Eyes allows Galvantula to hit as hard as possible with great accuracy. It can also spread paralysis to bulkier Pokemon like Dragalge and Registeel that can freely come in otherwise. Thunder Wave can reliably paralyze Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate that are unaffected by Sticky Web like Talonflame and Cresselia. Tera Ghost on Galvantula is only used in niche situations where forcing Sticky Web to be up by spinblocking Pokemon like Tsareena, Avalugg, and Brambleghast is necessary or there is no strong need to Terastallize another teammate.</p> <p>Setup sweepers that are relatively slow, like Porygon-Z, Chandelure, and Indeedee-M, greatly appreciate foes suffering the Speed drop from Galvantula's Sticky Web. Other setup sweepers that are still outsped even after they boost their Speed like Torterra and Dragon Dance Flygon work magnificently with Galvantula. Galvantula's Sticky Web also tends to get cleared by Tsareena's Rapid Spin and Talonflame's Defog, so spinblockers and Defog deterrents like Chandelure, Hisuian Typhlosion, Kilowattrel, and Galarian Articuno help to dissuade these entry hazard removers. The former two can also run Choice Scarf so that the team has speed control in case Sticky Web is removed. Opposing Choice Scarf users can be difficult to deal with because Pokemon on Sticky Web teams tend to be relatively slow, meaning naturally fast Pokemon like Inteleon, Infernape, and Flygon can work to counteract this issue. Hazards are also quite annoying for Sticky Web teams, especially opposing Sticky Web. Thus, Tsareena can work well as both an offensive threat and a hazard remover. Another hazard remover that works on Sticky Web teams is Focus Sash Brambleghast, as it can also set up Spikes and dent defensive Pokemon with Curse.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With Chandelure's tremendous Special Attack and STAB attacks, it can hit the entire tier for at least neutral damage, barring Incineroar. Chandelure, donning a Choice Specs, easily breaks through would-be checks like Diancie and Alolan Muk. However, with Choice Scarf, it becomes a dangerous revenge killer that’s able to check setup sweepers like Munkidori and Mienshao. Chandelure also learns Trick, which allows it to cripple walls and bulky setup sweepers alike such as Umbreon, Incineroar, and Cresselia. However, Chandelure has to deal with being extremely weak to entry hazards, limiting its opportunities to switch in. On top of that, Chandelure itself is quite easily revenge killed due to faster Choice Scarf users that are able to threaten it with their own STAB moves or through coverage moves like Flygon, Mienshao, and Meloetta.</p>",

Heavy-Duty Boots Chandelure can also run Flame Charge or Trailblaze to pick off weakened threats and sweep with its boosted Speed. Chandelure can run Hex on a status spreading team; however, it must give up a powerful STAB attack, coverage, or Trick to do so. Choice Scarf Chandelure can run Memento on a hyper offense team to try to aid its teammates in setting up once it becomes useless. Chandelure can also run Heavy-Duty Boots or Air Balloon to circumvent its entry hazards weakness and Ground-type weakness, respectively. If it runs these, though, it becomes noticeably weaker and slower.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types are a pain for Chandelure mostly because they tend to be able to take one attack and retaliate with a Knock Off. Specifically, Incineroar is quite problematic, since it resists all of Chandelure's attacks and is quite specially defensive, but due its to lack of recovery and entry hazards weakness, Incineroar can be chipped over the course of a game and taken advantage of with Trick, giving Chandelure its Heavy-Duty Boots.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: While Chandelure is able to beat Ghost-types like Basculegion, Brambleghast, and Hisuian Typhlosion offensively, it struggles to switch into and take priority attacks from the former two, and more often that not, it will get outsped and KOed by the latter two.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: With Chandelure's middling Speed, even with Choice Scarf, it is quite easily revenge killed by faster threats.

Pairing Chandelure with Fighting-types like Mienshao, Gallade, and Scrafty helps it take on Dark-types like Incineroar and Alolan Muk, which it tends to struggle against. With how vulnerable Chandelure is to entry hazards, it pairs greatly with hazards removal from Talonflame, Tsareena, and Tentacruel. Vileplume, Wo-Chien, and Tsareena are great teammates for Chandelure, as they check the Ground- and Water-types that scare it out like Flygon, Basculegion, and Inteleon; on top of that, the former two teammates can spread paralysis with Stun Spore.</p>"

Flash Fire gives Chandelure the ability to take advantage of Choice-locked Fire-types like Hisuian Typhlosion, Infernape, and opposing Chandelure. On the other hand, Flame Body lets Chandelure punish contact moves like Flygon's U-turn and Tsareena's Power Whip, but these targets and most others usually carry another move to hit Chandelure super effectively, negating its utility. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Chandelure to ignore entry hazards, letting it switch in repeatedly without worry. However, Air Balloon can be used instead to give Chandelure a temporary immunity to Ground-type attacks, giving Chandelure opportunities to set up against Earthquake Paldean Tauros-F and Choice-locked Flygon. Tera Grass boosts Energy Ball while giving Chandelure a resistance to Ground- and Water-type attacks from Pokemon like Flygon, Swampert, and Vaporeon. Tera Fairy can be used on Air Balloon sets to completely wall Flygon's STAB moves, and in general, it helps with taking Dark-type attacks from the likes of Bombirdier and Incineroar.</p> <p>Ground-types like Flygon and Gligar can destroy Chandelure with their STAB Earthquake, and they can also force it to Terastallize.

Fairy- and Fighting-types like Sylveon, Toxicroak, and Paldean Tauros-W are great teammates for Chandelure, as they can handle the Dark-types like Umbreon, Incineroar, and Alolan Muk. Chandelure appreciates slow pivots like Swampert, Dragalge, and Bellibolt giving it a safe entry without the risk of taking damage. Galvantula and Araquanid are great partners for Chandelure, as they can set up Sticky Web to remedy Chandelure's underwhelming Speed, letting it outspeed and KO faster foes like Mienshao, Inteleon, and Paldean Tauros-W.

    "overview": "<p>Tornadus's high-Base Power STAB and coverage moves, which are both further bolstered by its gargantuan offenses, and access to amazing utility options like Knock Off and Taunt make it a versatile threat in NU. Its Speed is also enormous, letting it blow past common fast Pokemon like Alolan Ninetales, Munkidori, and Paldean Tauros-W. On top of that, it has access to two amazing abilities that allow it to either be more supportive by getting off a fast Taunt and setting up Rain Dance freely with Prankster or offensive by letting it take advantage of common stat-dropping moves and abilities like Altaria's Defog, Brambleghast's Strength Sap, and both Paldean Tauros-W's and Incineroar's Intimidate. While some Tornadus sets run Heavy-Duty Boots, a fair amount don't, since other items can provide more support at times. Tornadus's weakness to Stealth Rock is further exacerbated on non-Heavy-Duty Boots sets by how much it loves to repeatedly come in, though. As a trade-off for its great offensive prowess, Tornadus has low bulk, which really starts to show when combined with its Stealth Rock weakness, and because of it, Tornadus's useful resistances and immunities are rendered moot, meaning it can be overpowered by Flamigo's Close Combat or KOed by a secondary STAB move like Flygon's Outrage. Tornadus also has to deal with either using unreliable moves like Hurricane and Bleakwind Storm or dealing with adverse contact effects such as paralysis from Bellibolt's Static. Not only that, but Amoonguss, Galarian Slowbro, and Bellibolt often carry Rocky Helmet, worsening Tornadus's situation.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sludge Bomb allows Tornadus to threaten Fairy-types like Sylveon, Florges, and Tera Fairy Galarian Slowbro, and it can usefully spread poison; however, Tornadus's other moves tend to provide more utility overall. Bulk Up sets can opt for Rest + Chesto Berry alongside Prankster so that they can set up many more times, but losing out on Defiant is quite detrimental with how common Intimidate is. A Choice Specs set with Hurricane / Focus Blast / Dark Pulse / U-turn can be run with Tornadus's enormous Special Attack and Speed as well as its access to pivoting, but its reliance on inaccurate moves can make it inconsistent at times. Tornadus can trade out Rain Dance and Damp Rock for Snowscape, Sunny Day, or Sandstorm and its respective weather-elongating item depending on what weather team it's being run on, but non-rain weather teams aren't as consistent overall.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Bellibolt, Rotom-H, Raikou, and Kilowattrel all can take on Tornadus's Hurricane and Acrobatics and retaliate with super effective STAB attacks. On top of that, they can all use Tornadus for momentum, Bellibolt can spread status with Toxic, Rotom-H and Raikou can set up, and Raikou and Kilowattrel outspeed it naturally. However, they can be easily caught off-guard by Tera Ground, and Bellibolt and Raikou must be wary of Tera Blast Ground.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Copperajah, Registeel, and Bronzong can take multiple hits from Tornadus, and they can capitalize on this by setting up entry hazards or boosting their stats. However, the former two need to watch out for common super effective coverage moves, the latter needs to be cautious of Knock Off, and they all have to watch out for Heat Wave.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Minior, Drednaw, and Diancie can use Tornadus as setup fodder or an opportunity to set up their hazards. However, the latter two need to watch out for super effective coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: While Alolan Ninetales isn't insanely bulky, it can almost always take one attack from Tornadus, especially from physically oriented sets, and retaliate with a powerful Blizzard. Alolan Ninetales also sets snow, forcing Tornadus to set up rain again. Similarly, physical Tornadus sets struggle to get past Avalugg. However, special attacking Tornadus sets with moves like Hurricane, Bleakwind Storm, and Heat Wave can get past Avalugg without too much of an issue.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Tornadus tends to prefer items other than Heavy-Duty Boots, as they can provide more utility. However, this causes Stealth Rock to be an enormous issue, and with how often certain Tornadus sets love to switch in and out, the damage can rack up quickly.</p>",

Heat Wave lets Tornadus nail Steel-types like Copperajah, Bronzong, and Registeel, while Grass Knot allows Tornadus to hit Ground- and Water-types like Gastrodon and Milotic. On the other hand, Taunt lets Tornadus stop walls like Bronzong, Gligar, and Gastrodon from setting up, getting their entry hazards up, or healing. An alternative EV spread of 116 HP / 140 SpA / 252 Spe can be used to survive common Choice Scarf users' attacks like Chandelure's Overheat and Hisuian Typhlosion's Eruption. Tera Steel allows Tornadus to tank a variety of hits like Cinccino's Tail Slap, Munkidori's Sludge Wave, and Sylveon's Hyper Voice. Alternatively, Tera Ground lets Tornadus take an Electric- or Rock-type attack from Kilowattrel and Diancie.</p> <p>Tornadus excels at firing off Knock Off and pivoting out, so entry hazard setters like Gastrodon, Bronzong, Orthworm, and Diancie can help capitalize on this trait. Tornadus can take one or two Fighting-type attacks, but it can't switch in consistently. Because of this, Fighting-resistant partners like Galarian Slowbro, Scream Tail, and Sylveon pair well with it. Pivots like Inteleon, Milotic, and Flygon enjoy Tornadus's presence, as it can easily dismantle common Grass-type switch-ins like Decidueye, Amoonguss, and Breloom. Ground- and Steel-types such as Gligar, Gastrodon, Bronzong, and Orthworm can help take on Electric- and Rock-types like Kilowattrel and Diancie that threaten Tornadus. As Tornadus typically lures in Rock-, Electric-, and Steel-types like Diancie, Bellibolt, and Registeel, wallbreakers like Basculegion-M, Choice Band Flygon, Guts Heracross, and Swords Dance Incineroar that capitalize on these Pokemon as entry points synergize extremely well; on top of that, they can also get rid of any neutral special walls trying to check Tornadus like Alolan Muk, Milotic, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro.</p>"

Under rain, Weather Ball is a powerful move that hits Flying-resistant Pokemon like Diancie super effectively while providing strong neutral coverage for others like Copperajah, but Knock Off allows Tornadus to provide more utility, removing important items like Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots while hitting Bronzong and Wind Rider Brambleghast super effectively. Tera Steel provides a strong defensive typing that can let Tornadus have an easier time both setting up rain and pivoting. On the other hand, Tera Ground can turn the tables against Electric- and Rock-types like Kilowattrel and Diancie, which would threaten Tornadus otherwise.</p> <p>Basculegion-M is a no-brainer when it comes to partners, as it can take advantage of Tornadus's rain-setting capabilities with its Swift Swim and rain-boosted Water-type STAB attacks. Other Swift Swim users like Kingdra, Overqwil, and Ludicolo also pair well while offering unique qualities: Kingdra excels at weakening Water-resistant and -immune Pokemon; Overqwil offers rain teams an easy way to handle Grass-types; and Ludicolo takes advantage of Water-types that rain teams can struggle with like Vaporeon, Gastrodon, and Milotic while acting as a secondary rain setter. As Tornadus is quite offensive, it tends to not have great longevity, so a more defensive rain setter like Klefki is greatly appreciated. On top of being more reliable, Klefki can support its team with both entry hazards and Thunder Wave. Tornadus can't handle Water-types too well, and neither can most Swift Swim users; thus, partners like Toxicroak, Kilowattrel, and Brambleghast are greatly appreciated.</p>"

Notably, at +1, Tornadus's Hammer Arm OHKOes Copperajah after one layer of Spikes and 2HKOes both Registeel and Orthworm. Tera Blast Ground gives Tornadus a more reliable way to take out the aforementioned Steel-types, barring Orthworm, along with Rock-types like Diancie. Tera Ground also allows Tornadus to surprise and take hits from Kilowattrel and Diancie. Alternatively, Knock Off can be used so that Tornadus neither has to Terastallize nor drop its Speed if it wishes to hit or take out Steel-types on low health, and it gives Tornadus a way to easily deal with Bronzong. Sitrus Berry provides some recovery to Tornadus and, when consumed, allows Acrobatics to be at full power. However, no item can be run to automatically have Tornadus at its fullest potential. Defiant lets Tornadus take advantage of common stat-dropping abilities and moves like Overqwil's and Incineroar's Intimidate as well as Vileplume's Strength Sap. Tera Steel can be run to gift Tornadus with a typing that better handles common special attackers like Munkidori, Dragalge, and Sylveon that could easily break through it.</p> <p>Since Defiant is Bulk Up Tornadus's biggest draw, leads like Galvantula, Brambleghast, and Froslass that set entry hazards pair naturally, as they help pressure the opponent's team to use Defog. Ghost-types like Hisuian Typhlosion, Chandelure, and Decidueye make for good partners, as they can create a hazard removal-punishing duo because any of them can spinblock, and Tornadus can punish Defoggers. Tornadus can have issues with KOing Steel-types like Registeel, Bronzong, and Orthworm, meaning teammates like Munkidori, Diancie, Cinccino, and Minior have great synergy, since they can work alongside Tornadus to overwhelm these shared checks. Cinccino is especially good thanks to its Tidy Up clearing Stealth Rock for Tornadus. Fighting- and Ground-types such as Breloom, Toxicroak, Torterra, Paldean Tauros-W, and Flygon work well to take out the aforementioned Steel-types as well as Rock-types like Diancie. The former three can also help take care of pesky defensive Water-types like Vaporeon, Milotic, and Swampert. Bulk Up Tornadus struggles with OHKOing Alolan Ninetales and breaking through Ice-types like Avalugg, meaning teammates that can switch in and beat them such as Chandelure and Diancie are greatly appreciated.</p>"

Focus Blast allows Tornadus to better hit Rock-types like Diancie as well as Dark-types like Incineroar, but Heat Wave gives it a more reliable way of taking out Steel-types such as Copperajah and Registeel. Dark Pulse lets Tornadus hit Wind Rider Brambleghast and the Fighting-neutral Bronzong super effectively, which could potentially wall Tornadus otherwise. Alternatively, Tera Blast Steel can be run to super effectively hit Diancie, which would wall Tornadus pretty well otherwise, as well as letting Tornadus KO Brambleghast. Tera Steel also means Tornadus can take attacks like Inteleon's Ice Beam, Cinccino's Tail Slap, and Munkidori's Psychic, giving it an easier time setting up and firing off attacks. Tera Ground, on the other hand, allows Tornadus to better take on Rock- and Electric-types like Diancie and Kilowattrel.

Cinccino is also quite good at this, and it can remove entry hazards for Tornadus, letting it comfortably run a different item. Pokemon like Diancie, Toxtricity, and Weakness Policy Incineroar help bring in Fighting- and Ground-types like Breloom, Flygon, and Swampert, which all give Tornadus free setup opportunities. Since Tornadus will most likely thud into and faint to a Steel- or Rock-type, a teammate like Chandelure, Breloom, Torterra, or Flygon works well to take advantage of the free entry they get afterwards. A dedicated lead like Booster Energy Scream Tail, Brambleghast, Eject Pack Flygon, or Focus Sash Infernape is also appreciated to help wear down Tornadus's checks like Diancie, Registeel, and Alolan Muk.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Meloetta's amazing Special Attack and solid special bulk let it feature in several roles as a special wallbreaker, offensive pivot, Calm Mind sweeper, revenge killer, and late-game cleaner. Thanks to Meloetta's range, it can be unpredictable at team preview and early-game. Meloetta's ability to use Tera Blast as a STAB move only adds to its flexibility, and it's a great offensive user of Terastallization to turn the tables on its checks or enhance its Calm Mind set. However, Meloetta's offensive STAB moves leave gaps in its coverage against Steel-types like Klefki, Bronzong, and Copperajah, and it struggles to pack a coverage move and Tera type to hit all of them super effectively. This leaves Meloetta's Calm Mind sets especially vulnerable to these Steel-types, while its Choice item sets are prediction-reliant and struggle with Focus Blast's inaccuracy and Shadow Ball's limited coverage. Meloetta's Speed tier leaves it behind revenge killers like Paldean Tauros-W, Flygon, and Cinccino, while Scream Tail severely annoys Meloetta's setup sets with its fast Encore. Meloetta also competes with special attackers like Toxtricity, Munkidori, and Porygon-Z, which can offer much more immediate power, Speed-boosting options, and pivoting opportunities between the three of them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Alluring Voice goes through Substitute and provides Meloetta with Fairy-type coverage without requiring it to Terastallize, but common Dark-types like Incineroar and Alolan Muk are hit neutrally by it anyway. Knock Off provides similar utility to Trick against item-dependent Pokemon like Incineroar and Porygon2 without forcing Meloetta to give up its Choice item, but a Choice item tends to be more devastating against these foes. Assault Vest Meloetta has great special bulk for tanking hits from wallbreakers like Toxtricity and Porygon-Z, but it lacks the standout Speed and power of its Choice sets. Meloetta can run a pivot set with Heavy-Duty Boots that avoids the shortcomings of its Choice item sets having to lock into one move and taking entry hazard damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Klefki doesn't fear any of Meloetta's coverage moves, Bronzong deals with Meloetta variants that don't have Shadow Ball, and all Steel-types can tank Meloetta's STAB attacks and use it as an opportunity to set up entry hazards. However, Steel-types like Alolan Sandslash and Copperajah must be wary of Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Physically Offensive Revenge Killers</strong>: Flygon, Paldean Tauros-W, and Staraptor outpace Meloetta, and they can match its Choice Scarf sets with ones of their own. Scyther and Cinccino even have multi-hit moves to break past Substitute sets.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Dark-types</strong>: Alolan Muk does not struggle with Meloetta's coverage moves, though it can be worn down by repeated hits from Choice Specs sets. Incineroar, Scrafty, and Wo-Chien must be wary of Focus Blast, but they have the bulk to tank one attack and retaliate against Meloetta with Knock Off.</p>",

      "Choice Item": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Meloetta's STAB moves are quite spammable against defensive staples like Amoonguss, Gastrodon, and Swampert. Hyper Voice's ability to go through Substitute is helpful against users like Raikou, Nasty Plot Uxie, and Goodra. Tera Blast makes Meloetta much more offensively threatening in conjunction with Terastallization. Psyshock is an alternative to Psychic, allowing Meloetta to nail specially bulky Pokemon like Porygon2, Goodra, Gastrodon, and Sylveon as well as special sweepers like Oricorio-F and Raikou, but Psychic's better damage against Pokemon like Diancie and Paldean Tauros-W makes it preferred. Shadow Ball covers Bronzong and hits Scream Tail, Oricorio-P, and Basculegion super effectively. In addition, Shadow Ball has a neat synergy with Serene Grace, improving Meloetta's odds to overwhelm Bronzong and Scream Tail. Focus Blast hits other Steel-types like Alolan Sandslash, Duraludon, and Copperajah super effectively, and it's useful coverage against Dark-types like Incineroar and Scrafty. U-turn lets Meloetta keep up momentum for its team against switch-ins like Klefki, Copperajah, and Bronzong. Meloetta can use Trick to disrupt its defensive switch-ins, as a Choice item is especially devastating to walls like Copperajah and Porygon2. However, Meloetta can drop Trick for U-turn so it can fit a coverage move while still acting as an offensive pivot. Tera Fighting grants Meloetta key resistances to moves like Knock Off and Sucker Punch against foes like Alolan Muk and Toxicroak, and the coverage it provides in conjunction with Tera Blast enables Meloetta to break through Copperajah, Porygon2, and Alolan Sandslash. Tera Fairy shares Tera Fighting's nice resistances against Dark- and Bug-type moves, and it grants Meloetta better defensive matchups against Fighting-types like Scrafty and Heracross when it's in a pinch. Tera Fairy also turns Tera Blast into a super effective move against Dragon-types like Goodra and Altaria, as well as a stronger option against Duraludon. Tera Ghost powers up Shadow Ball to nail Bronzong and Scream Tail, and the Fighting immunity it offers is helpful against Body Press users like the aforementioned Bronzong and Diancie.</p> <p>Meloetta appreciates checks to troublesome Steel-types like Copperajah and Bronzong, so wallbreakers such as Paldean Tauros-W, Paldean Tauros-F, and Basculegion make good teammates. Fighting-types like Scrafty and Toxicroak compensate for Meloetta's difficult matchups against bulky Dark-types like Incineroar and Alolan Muk. Offensive pivots like Flygon, Flamigo, and Kilowattrel can get Meloetta into good positions by bringing it in against defensive Pokemon like Breloom, Amoonguss, and Galarian Slowbro, which is greatly appreciated by Choice Specs variants. Slow, defensive pivots like Vaporeon, Swampert, and Incineroar can go a step further by tanking hits for Meloetta as they switch it in. Entry hazard removers like Cinccino and Altaria help keep Meloetta from being worn down as it pivots on and off the field. Meloetta itself appreciates hazards from setters like Copperajah, Diancie, and Gastrodon for wearing down checks like Alolan Muk, Klefki, and opposing Diancie. Physically defensive Pokemon like Amoonguss, Galarian Slowbro, and Sylveon can switch into physically offensive revenge killers such as Flygon, Paldean Tauros-W, and Scyther to let Meloetta switch out.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Substitute helps Meloetta set up against passive Pokemon it forces out, including Amoonguss and Gastrodon. Substitute's effect of blocking status comes in handy against Porygon2 and Galarian Slowbro, and Meloetta can depend on Substitute as protection from revenge killers like Paldean Tauros-W and Choice Scarf Basculegion. Meloetta can also use Substitute to play around Toxicroak's Sucker Punch. Psyshock is used over Psychic to win boosting wars against opposing special sweepers like Scream Tail, Sylveon, and Raikou. Psyshock's additional damage against specially defensive Pokemon like Goodra, Porygon2, and Gastrodon is another perk. Tera Blast is used instead of Hyper Voice to make Meloetta's STAB attack flexible coverage with Terastallization. Leftovers enables Meloetta to set up Substitute multiple times, turning passive Pokemon like Gastrodon and Porygon2 into setup fodder. Tera Fighting improves Meloetta's matchups against Dark-types like Alolan Muk and turns Tera Blast into a solid coverage move against targets like Copperajah, Incineroar, and Porygon2. Alternatively, Tera Fairy also gives Meloetta a Dark resistance while giving it a stronger coverage against Goodra and Scrafty and an immunity to Dragon Tail.</p> <p>Specially offensive pivots like Toxtricity, Kilowattrel, and Inteleon can draw in special walls like Porygon2 and Gastrodon for Meloetta to use as setup fodder. Defensive pivots like Incineroar, Vaporeon, and Gligar can get Meloetta onto the field safely. Alolan Ninetales can set up Aurora Veil to facilitate Meloetta's ease of setting up, and it's also solid at wearing down Steel-types like Klefki and Bronzong for Meloetta to overwhelm later. Alolan Muk, Munkidori, and Diancie can also draw in and weaken Steel-types for Meloetta. Entry hazard setters like Klefki, the aforementioned Diancie, and Gligar serve to soften up foes like Alolan Muk and Porygon2, facilitating Meloetta's ability to break through them. Hazard removal support from Avalugg and Scyther helps Meloetta not be worn down too quickly as it uses Substitute.</p>"

  "Dragalge": {
    "overview": "<p>Dragalge is a staple in NU thanks to its great typing, utility movepool, and access to Adaptability, which let it successfully fulfill both offensive and defensive roles. Bulkier sets can come in on walls like Vileplume and take advantage of them by setting Toxic Spikes, causing the rest of their team to suffer. On the other hand, Choice Specs sets provide a ton of nuking power with Adaptability, allowing Dragalge to break through former counters like Umbreon and Registeel. However, Dragalge lacks good Speed, meaning it often can't retaliate before strong attackers overwhelm it. Bulkier sets are also held back due to a lack of access to recovery moves and Dragalge’s below-average HP. Dragalge’s typing too, at times, can be somewhat limiting, since Ground- and Steel-types are fairly common in NU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Scald can be used on bulkier Dragalge sets to try to burn checks like Copperajah and Klefki, but this causes Dragalge to lose out on pressure in Toxic Spikes or momentum in Flip Turn. A moveset consisting of Substitute / Sludge Bomb / Dragon Pulse / Focus Blast or Tera Blast Ground can be used with Leftovers to significantly capitalize on forced switches and take advantage of more passive Pokemon. But this can hurt Dragalge's longevity quite a bit, and, in general, opportunities aren’t too common.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types like Flygon and Torterra are difficult to handle for Dragalge, as they’re always faster and can hit it with their powerful STAB Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Registeel and Tera Steel Sylveon wall Dragalge's STAB moves, meaning they can come in and take advantage of it often and only fear Focus Blast. Also, Klefki loves to come in on any of Dragalge’s attacks and spread status or set Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Dragalge struggles against the plethora of Psychic-types like Gallade, Indeedee, and Munkidori. All of these Pokemon easily scare out Dragalge with their Psychic-type STAB moves and also tend to be able to take a hit from it.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls like Alolan Muk, Assault Vest Gallade, Bronzong, and Diancie take on Dragalge’s attacks easily and can threaten it with Knock Off, super effective damage, or a physical attack. All of these Pokemon don’t have a very reliable source of healing, though, so they tend to be whittled down over the course of a battle.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Toxic Spikes allows Dragalge to chip away at walls, while Dragon Tail can phaze Dragalge’s checks as well as setup sweepers. Flip Turn works amazingly on Dragalge, letting it act as a bulky pivot that can bring in powerful wallbreakers. The given EV spread allows Dragalge to outspeed Vileplume while giving it some physical bulk to aid with Fighting-types like Mienshao and Infernape. Tera Steel allows Dragalge to take Psychic-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type attacks from foes like Munkidori, Sylveon, and opposing Dragalge. On the other hand, Tera Water alleviates its weakness to Ground-type attacks while giving it an overall strong defensive typing.</p> <p>Toxic Spikes lowers switch rates when your opponent tries to play around them, so Pokemon that can scare out Poison-types and cause switches like Flygon and Future Sight Galarian Articuno can overwhelm your opponents. Partners that can bring in physically defensive Pokemon such as Mienshao and Infernape gift Dragalge with chances to set Toxic Spikes. In the face of Steel-types like Klefki and Copperajah, Dragalge fails to do much, so partners that can take advantage of its Flip Turn and deal with these pests, like Gallade, Mienshao, and Flare Blitz Talonflame, work well. Opposing Dragon- and Fairy-type Pokemon also cause issues for Dragalge, as they’re usually faster and can severely damage or KO Dragalge before it can react. Teammates that help alleviate this weakness such as Sylveon, Registeel, and Copperajah are appreciated. Dragalge’s limited HP also hinders it; to ensure its survival for longer, entry hazard removers or Wish users like Talonflame, Brambleghast, and Vaporeon can be used. Pokemon like Vileplume and Tsareena that can handle more offensive Ground-types such as Flygon and Torterra can help out Dragalge.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sludge Wave is preferred for damage output, but Sludge Bomb can more reliably poison specially defensive Pokemon like Gastrodon and Umbreon. Focus Blast can heavily dent many Steel-types on the switch-in like Registeel, Klefki, and Copperajah. Tera Blast Ground can be used instead to hit these targets more accurately and powerfully along with Alolan Muk; however, this comes at the cost of Terastallizing, making it not as favored of an option overall. For the last move, a way to pivot in Flip Turn is preferred to bring a partner in on a wall it would otherwise have trouble with. The given EVs let Dragalge outpace Vaporeon and Umbreon with the rest poured into HP. An alternative and bulkier EV spread of 120 HP / 252 SpA / 136 Spe can be run, as it gives Dragalge enough Speed to outrun uninvested Sylveon. Tera Poison grants Dragalge a resistance to Fairy while also powering Sludge Wave to preposterous levels; however, a more defensive Tera type like Tera Steel could be used to help Dragalge retaliate after surviving Psychic- and Dragon-type attacks.</p> <p>Dragalge’s low Speed tends to hinder it a lot, but this can be negated with pivot cores. Dragalge draws in Steel-types, but it can use Flip Turn to let Mienshao or Flygon handle them. On the other hand, Mienshao and Flygon themselves can use U-turn after drawing in a physical wall like Vileplume or Quagsire, which Dragalge preys on. Dragalge can also whittle down Steel-types like Copperajah and Registeel over time with a strong Focus Blast, so Pokemon that can take advantage of this such as Munkidori, Reuniclus, and Calm Mind Sylveon enjoy its presence. Special walls like Alolan Muk, Gastrodon, and Registeel love to come in on Dragalge, so strong physical wallbreakers like Gallade and Incineroar work well to deal with these checks.</p>"

  "Sylveon": {
    "overview": "<p>Sylveon's great matchup against top threats like Scrafty and Flygon alongside its set versatility makes it one of the premier Fairy-types in NU. Wallbreaking sets can break through common special walls like Alolan Muk and Gastrodon. Sylveon can also run a more defensive set, letting it heal up teammates that it naturally synergizes with like Incineroar, Registeel, and Swampert that lack reliable recovery. Sylveon has great Special Defense, letting it take on special wallbreakers like Inteleon and Diancie with little or no investment. However, both of Sylveon's roles are contested by another Fairy-type, namely Florges, as Florges has access to Trick for Choice Specs sets as a way to decommission Steel-types and special walls, and it has higher Speed, meaning its wallbreaking sets can outpace more threats and Wish passing sets can invest more in its Defense. On top of that, Sylveon must compete with other Wish passers such as Vaporeon and Scream Tail, which can provide more utility at times with the former having access to Haze and Flip Turn, while the latter can provide Thunder Wave and Encore. Sylveon is also walled immensely by Steel-types like Copperajah and Registeel, but their lack of recovery leaves them susceptible to being worn down over the course of a game. Wish sets also tend to be passive and easily taken advantage of by the aforementioned Steel-types and setup sweepers like Munkidori and Incineroar. Sylveon's subpar Defense can also let it be broken through, as it's typically forced to take Knock Off for its team all while being whittled away at by entry hazards.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Due to Choice Specs Sylveon already having all the coverage it needs from its first three slots, it can run many moves for its last. Sylveon can opt for Quick Attack as a means to pick off weakened threats. Hyper Beam can be used as a nuke button that's able to chip away at Steel-types heavily but leaves it open the next turn. Sylveon can even forgo Choice Specs entirely and go for a Pixie Plate set that allows it to bluff Choice Specs, surprising its opponent when it changes up its moves; however, Sylveon's overall power drops. On Wish sets, Moonblast + Cute Charm can be run on bulkier teams, as Moonblast has higher PP than Hyper Voice, and if Sylveon is female, it can fish for immobilization via attraction against Pokemon forced to be male like Hitmonlee and Tornadus.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Registeel, Bronzong, and Copperajah all wall Sylveon and can use it to set entry hazards, as they easily threaten it out with their Steel-type STAB moves. While Klefki can also wall Sylveon, use it to set entry hazards, and paralyze it with Thunder Wave, it's more of a stalemate because Klefki fails to do significant damage to Sylveon unless it carries a rare move like Steel Beam. All of these Steel-types must be wary of Tera Blast Ground and, in Bronzong's case, Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Alolan Muk, Munkidori, Amoonguss, and Tentacruel can take a Hyper Voice and threaten back with super effective Poison-type attacks. Dragalge can also take a hit and threaten it, but it can only do this once per game.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Sylveon, especially when defensive, tends to have to take Knock Off and U-turn for its team, and losing Heavy-Duty Boots or not running it in the first place means entry hazards also chip away at it. All of this combined with Wish taking two turns and possibly being cancelled out due to Roar from Swampert or Whirlwind from Copperajah means that Sylveon can be whittled away at and beaten by wallbreakers it normally beats, like Incineroar and Flygon.</p>",

Shadow Ball gives Sylveon a strong neutral move for the Steel-types that tend to switch into Sylveon like Klefki, Registeel, and Copperajah, and notably, it hits Bronzong super effectively. As Sylveon's last moveslot is its most flexible one, it prefers to run Draining Kiss as a secondary STAB move so that it doesn't get chipped away at as easily. Tera Blast Ground can instead be used to hit the aforementioned non-Bronzong Steel-types that could sit on Sylveon otherwise; however, due to this requiring Terastallization, it typically isn't run. A Modest nature is preferred for the extra damage output, but Timid can be run to outspeed Adamant Incineroar. Tera Fairy allows Sylveon to reach catastrophic levels of damage with its Hyper Voice, as it's now able to 2HKO Fairy-resistant Pokemon like Rotom-H and Galarian Slowbro.</p> <p>Sylveon's main roadblock from tearing apart teams is bulky Steel-types like Registeel, Copperajah, and Klefki; however, due to their lack of recovery, there are a few ways its teammates can whittle them down. Entry hazard setters like Brambleghast, Swampert, and Flygon can help to soften up these Steel-types for Sylveon's attacks. Another way to break through these Pokemon is teammates that carry super effective coverage to surprise these Steel-types like Close Combat Staraptor, Focus Blast or Tera Blast Ground Munkidori, and Focus Blast Dragalge. It can also go through more straightforward means such as having a partner like Paldean Tauros formes, Incineroar, or Flygon to pressure these Steel-types. Incineroar, Flygon, and Infernape greatly enjoy Sylveon as a partner, as they can pivot it in on physically defensive Water-types like Milotic, Swampert, and Vaporeon that wall them. Choice Scarf users like Munkidori, Meloetta, and Porygon-Z enjoy Sylveon wearing away at Steel-types like Copperajah, Klefki, and Registeel. Sylveon easily dispatches Dark-types like Incineroar, Scrafty, and Alolan Muk. Teammates that benefit from this like Meloetta, Galarian Articuno, and Brambleghast pair well alongside Sylveon, as they can form a wallbreaking core together.</p>"

On the other hand, Roar prevents Sylveon from needing to risk certain Calm Mind wars like those versus Scream Tail, Galarian Articuno, and Bronzong, and it doubles as a way to get extra chip damage on Steel-types trying to switch in, forcing them out to rack up entry hazard damage. The Speed EVs allow Sylveon to get the jump on Vaporeon, letting Sylveon avoid having its stat boosts thrown away by Vaporeon's Haze before it can get a hit off. Tera Steel is preferred, as it allows Sylveon to better handle Poison- and Steel-types like Amoonguss and Copperajah, provides an immunity to Gligar's Toxic, and lets it soft check many special attackers in a pinch like Munkidori, Porygon-Z, and Toxtricity. Tera Poison, on the other hand, maintains Sylveon's matchup against Fighting-types while keeping Tera Steel's utility against Toxic users and poison from Alolan Muk. Alternatively, Tera Water provides a strong defensive typing that doesn't forfeit Sylveon's matchup against both Ground- and Fighting-types like Flygon and Infernape. Leftovers prevents Sylveon from having to use Wish as often and lets it heal with Protect, but Heavy-Duty Boots is useful to circumvent entry hazard chip damage.</p> <p>Sylveon's access to Wish means it can support Pokemon without reliable recovery like Swampert, Bronzong, and Incineroar. Pokemon like Basculegion-M, Munkidori, and Registeel that are scared out by Wo-Chien, Flygon, and Heracross enjoy having Sylveon to check these threats. Alongside a specially defensive partner like Alolan Muk, Gastrodon, or Copperajah, Sylveon can help to form a defensive backbone for teams. Sylveon also appreciates wallbreakers like Paldean Tauros-W, Flygon, and Chandelure, as they can pressure Steel-types that typically wall and take advantage of it like Klefki, Copperajah, and Bronzong. Due to Sylveon's reliance on Protect to safely heal, it's vulnerable to setup sweepers like Drednaw, Munkidori, and Paldean Tauros formes, meaning Choice Scarf revenge killers like Ditto or Pokemon with priority like Flygon pair well with it. Sylveon also tends to be a momentum sink, so pivots like Flygon, Incineroar, and Flamigo that do well versus common switch-ins like Alolan Muk, Registeel, and Copperajah can help regain lost momentum. As Sylveon can be easily chipped down by entry hazards and having to switch into Knock Off and U-turn from Pokemon like Incineroar, a second soft check to physical attackers is welcome, so partners like Scyther, Amoonguss, and Dragalge work well to fulfill this role.</p>"

Choice Specs makes Goodra a strong wallbreaker that can 2HKO the bulkiest foes that don't resist Dragon like Gastrodon and Alolan Muk after Stealth Rock damage. However, Goodra's average physical bulk makes it very easy to be revenge killed by physical attackers like Flygon, Toxicroak, and Flamigo. Steel- and Fairy-types like Bronzong, Diancie, and Scream Tail can take advantage of Choice Specs Goodra locking into its Dragon-type attacks, letting them set up or force it to switch.

Tera Poison boosts Sludge Wave and Sludge Bomb while giving Goodra the ability to better handle foes like Toxicroak, Sylveon, and Flamigo. On the other hand, Tera Dragon boosts the power of Goodra's STAB attacks, letting it do major damage to threats like Alolan Muk, Gastrodon, and Milotic.</p> <p>Goodra partners well with entry hazard setters like Bronzong, Klefki, and Overqwil, allowing it to pressure special walls like Porygon2 and Gastrodon. Fairy-types like Sylveon, Diancie, and Scream Tail can force Goodra to switch if it's locked into a Dragon-type attack; thus, Steel-types like Copperajah, Bronzong, and Klefki are good partners to check them. Hazard removers like Scyther, Brambleghast, and Avalugg allow Goodra to not be worn down by hazards. Goodra synergizes with other wallbreakers like Paldean Tauros-W, Incineroar, and Decidueye, allowing them to overwhelm defensive tanks like Galarian Slowbro, opposing Incineroar, and Porygon2. Pivot users like Inteleon, Flamigo, and Infernape can bring in foes like Milotic, Diancie, and Altaria; together, they can overwhelm these foes and let Goodra easily pick them off.</p>"

Flamethrower gives Goodra the ability to hit Steel-types like Bronzong and Klefki, but Fire Blast can be used for its higher power, allowing it to potentially get a KO. Substitute allows Goodra to take advantage of passive walls like Vaporeon, Gastrodon, and Galarian Slowbro. Sludge Bomb hits Fairy-types like Alolan Ninetales and Scream Tail while letting it fish for poison, but Sludge Wave can be used for the higher power. Leftovers gives Goodra a form of recovery, which is especially useful on Substitute sets, while Heavy-Duty Boots lets it continuously switch into foes like Chandelure and Milotic without getting worn down by entry hazards. Sap Sipper allows Goodra to take advantage of Grass-types like Amoonguss and Decidueye. Alternatively, Gooey can benefit its teammates, allowing them to outspeed faster foes like Flygon and Cinccino. An EV spread of 76 HP / 252 SpA / 180 Spe paired with a Modest nature lets Goodra better tank attacks from threats like Toxtricity and Munkidori while outpacing foes such as Jolly Incineroar and Adamant Decidueye, but it can fully invest into Speed to let Goodra outspeed threats such as Basculegion-M and Toxtricity. Tera Poison gives Goodra useful resistances to Fighting and Fairy and an immunity to any poison status from Alolan Muk and Galarian Slowbro while boosting the power of both Sludge Bomb and Sludge Wave. On the other hand, Tera Steel gives it the ability to better handle special wallbreakers like Sylveon, Munkidori, and Toxtricity.</p> <p>Goodra best partners with Pokemon like Inteleon, Munkidori, and Kilowattrel, since they can bring in passive threats like Gastrodon, Bronzong, and Porygon2 and allow it to easily take advantage of them.

Goodra pairs best with Steel- and Poison-types like Bronzong, Amoonguss, and Klefki, as they can handle Fairy-types like Florges and Diancie. Physical walls like Overqwil, Amoonguss, and Swampert can handle physical attackers like Flygon, Infernape, and Scyther. Goodra can be pressured if it's repeatedly switching into entry hazards; thus, it appreciates hazard removal like Scyther, Brambleghast, and Avalugg.

  "Klefki": {
    "overview": "<p>Klefki is an incredibly crafty support Pokemon, making use of its incredible combination of ability, movepool, and typing to bring mayhem to the battlefield. Klefki's Prankster ability lets it scatter Spikes, spread paralysis with Thunder Wave, summon rain and sun, and even boost its own stats before the foe can act; it's a very malleable Pokemon that can find itself on almost any team due to its supportive capabilities. Klefki's highly coveted Steel / Fairy typing makes it a great sponge for special attacks, taking on the likes of Munkidori, Espeon, and Dragalge while also resisting Knock Off and U-turn. Although Klefki has many tricks up its sleeve, offense is not one of them, since it uses paltry base 80 offensive stats and often relies on Foul Play to not be a complete sitting duck. Any means to circumvent Prankster-affected moves such as Magic Bounce, Dark-types, and Taunt can generally spell doom for Klefki. Dark-types like Incineroar, Alolan Muk, and Tera Dark Drednaw can take advantage of Klefki's inability to status them. Despite Klefki's phenomenal defensive typing, its stats often leave much to be desired, meaning some special wallbreakers like Porygon-Z and Indeedee-M can eventually overwhelm it even in spite of a type disadvantage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Klefki can utilize its Prankster ability to run a Double Dance set; boosting its Defense with Iron Defense and special stats with Calm Mind while maintaining its health with Draining Kiss to turn Stored Power into an unwallable attack. Klefki can sport a Damp Rock or Heat Rock along with Rain Dance or Sunny Day, respectively, to facilitate those respective weather teams. Klefki can use Eject Button or Red Card in tandem with Prankster Recycle to repeatedly pivot itself or its foe out of play. Klefki can hold onto a Toxic Orb, which won't affect it, and use Switcheroo to bestow it onto an unsuspecting target like Oricorio-E, which can otherwise set up on Klefki safely.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types like Swampert, Flygon, Gligar, and Swampert are immune to Klefki's Prankster Thunder Wave and threaten it with Earthquake, although they must be wary of Magnet Rise.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Bulky setup sweepers that can take advantage of Klefki's passivity can be a huge issue for it. Calm Mind Pokemon like Cresselia, Chandelure, and Florges take minimal damage from Klefki's attacks and can accrue multiple boosts while it flounders helplessly.</p> <p><strong>Prankster-immune Pokemon</strong>: Many Pokemon that can ignore Klefki's Prankster-affected moves in one way or another can take advantage of Klefki's relative passivity. Magic Bounce Espeon, Dark-types, and Thunder Wave-immune Pokemon like Oricorio-E and Flygon find safe entry against Klefki and threaten it.</p>",

  "Avalugg": {
    "overview": "<p>Avalugg's exceptional physical bulk and access to Rapid Spin and Recover make it one of the best physical walls in the tier for balanced and defensive teams. Avalugg can comfortably take some of the most powerful physical attacks in the tier, such as Basculegion-M's Wave Crash and Staraptor's Brave Bird, as well as super effective attacks from Fighting-types such as Infernape and Paldean Tauros-W. Avalugg can also dish out serious damage by weaponizing its Defense stat with Body Press and hitting hard with moves like Avalanche and Earthquake, thanks to its high Attack stat. However, Avalugg is extremely frail on the special side, which allows special wallbreakers such as Munkidori and Porygon-Z to easily force it out. Avalugg's Ice typing makes it weak to common physical wallbreakers in the tier like Incineroar, Paldean Tauros-F, and Flamigo and heavily reliant on Terastallization to wall many physical threats. Avalugg is also very susceptible to Knock Off, since it relies on Heavy-Duty Boots to circumvent its Stealth Rock weakness.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Running IronPress allows Avalugg to become a very threatening sweeper. However, this forces Avalugg to drop a coverage option or Rapid Spin, the former making Avalugg unable to hit Ghost-types, while the latter significantly reduces its utility. Tera Fighting removes Avalugg's weaknesses and makes Avalugg more offensively threatening. Tera Fighting also lets Avalugg resist Stealth Rock, allowing it to switch in more frequently if its Heavy-Duty Boots is removed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers, such as Chandelure, Inteleon, and Munkidori, pose a major threat to Avalugg, since it cannot handle their attacks very well. However, Sturdy can help mitigate this issue by allowing Avalugg to deal damage to special wallbreakers for its partners when necessary.</p> <p><strong>Fire- and Fighting-type Wallbreakers</strong>: Powerful physical attackers such as Incineroar, Paldean Tauros-F, Heracross, and Flamigo threaten Avalugg with their strong STAB moves, forcing it out. Avalugg's sheer bulk allows it to take one hit from even super effective attackers, these Pokemon often run Choice Band or Swords Dance sets, preventing Avalugg from safely switching in and beating them.</p> <p><strong>Item Displacement</strong>: Avalugg's Ice typing means it requires Heavy-Duty Boots to consistently switch in. Avalugg must use Recover more often if Knock Off users like Incineroar and Alolan Muk or Trick users remove its Heavy-Duty Boots, making it harder for Avalugg to consistently remove entry hazards and wall important foes.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Body Press utilizes Avalugg's Defense stat to threaten 2HKOs or 3HKOs on most offensive threats while hitting bulky Steel-types for super effective damage. Body Press also threatens attackers such as Tera Steel Flygon and Incineroar. Since Avalugg is slower than nearly the entire metagame, Avalanche is a great STAB option. However, Ice Spinner can sometimes be preferable for more consistent damage and can remove Terrain, which helps Avalugg and its team against Grassy Terrain offense teams. Earthquake deals super effective damage to Fire-, Poison-, and Electric-type wallbreakers that try to take advantage of Avalugg, such as Chandelure, Munkidori, and Toxtricity. Sturdy allows Avalugg to always survive a single attack in a pinch and retaliate. When paired with Alolan Ninetales, though, Ice Body can be used to capitalize on its snow to gain passive recovery. Tera Poison gives Avalugg a great defensive typing, providing it with a resistance to Fighting and making it immune to poison and Toxic, which would otherwise cripple it, from Alolan Muk and Amoonguss. Alternatively, Tera Water grants Avalugg important resistances to Fire, Steel, and Water, letting it better withstand attacks from threats like Incineroar, Copperajah, and Basculegion-M.</p> <p>Avalugg's entry hazard control and high Defense is appreciated by many teamstyles from balance to stall. However, Avalugg's abysmal Special Defense means that it benefits greatly from blanket special walls such as Porygon2, Registeel, and Milotic, which can switch into the many special attackers that force Avalugg out like Toxtricity, Diancie, and Chandelure. Fire- and Fighting-type wallbreakers like Paldean Tauros-F, Flamigo, and Breloom can overwhelm Avalugg, meaning Pokemon that can switch into their attacks, such as Chandelure, Gligar, and Amoonguss, are good partners. Avalugg struggles to threaten Ghost-types like Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion with its attacks, especially if it lacks Earthquake, making Dark-types such as Incineroar and Alolan Muk good partners for it. These two can also burn and poison wallbreakers, making it much easier for Avalugg to outlast them. Bulky Water-types, such as Vaporeon, Gastrodon, and Milotic, can pose a huge problem for Avalugg, as they have powerful special attacks and are difficult to switch out of due to the risk of Scald burning an incoming Pokemon. Water-immune Pokemon such as Vaporeon and Toxicroak can help immensely, while status-immune wallbreakers, such as Poison Heal Breloom, Toxtricity, and Guts Hariyama, can force them out or set up on them. Alolan Ninetales outspeeds many Fighting-type wallbreakers that threaten Avalugg, such as Flamigo, Paldean Tauros-F and -W, and Breloom, and can KO them with Moonblast. It also sets snow for Avalugg, boosting its Defense considerably and giving it passive recovery from Ice Body. In return, Avalugg can draw in and dent Steel-type walls, such as Registeel and Copperajah, which are difficult for Alolan Ninetales to get past, by using Body Press and Earthquake.</p>"

With well-rounded stats, Diancie can easily go both offensive and defensive, with its sets being supported by its large movepool. Specially defensive Diancie is a great check to special wallbreakers like Chandelure, Kilowattrel, and Hisuian Typhlosion, and it can carry Encore to circumvent its passivity when against setup sweepers. Trick Room sets can easily turn the tables versus faster, more offensive teams, as Diancie can outspeed and KO everything after it gets its Special Attack boost from Meteor Beam.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Diancie can run Rock Polish for a more permanent Speed boost, but with its low-base Speed, it's easily outpaced by Choice Scarf users like Flygon, Inteleon, and Mienshao even after it boosts. A Sticky Web setter is great for this set, as it attempts to solve Diancie's low Speed issue. If there is already a Stealth Rock user on Diancie's team, it can run Spikes instead so that it can continue to provide entry hazard support. Specially defensive sets can run a more specially-oriented moveset, with moves like Moonblast, Earth Power, and Power Gem being run over Diamond Storm and Body Press. Diancie can also run a sweeper set with a moveset of Calm Mind / Iron Defense / Draining Kiss / Stored Power, which can take advantage of passive or weaker Pokemon quite well, but it can be easily overpowered by any wallbreaker or Trick, Encore, and Taunt users. Diancie can also run offensive sets with Stealth Rock and Spikes, usually with Moonblast and Earth Power supporting it; however, it is considered a bit suboptimal, since its bulk is usually appreciated to set hazards up safely.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Bulky Steel-types like Bronzong, Registeel, and Copperajah can easily switch in on Diancie and set up entry hazards, forcing it out or making it use Tera in order to survive an attack and KO them. In particular, Bronzong is quite bothersome for Diancie, as it walls its STAB attacks and is immune to Earth Power thanks to Levitate. However, all of these Steel-types lack a form of reliable recovery making them easily overwhelmed over the course of a battle. Both Bronzong and Registeel take a lot of damage from +2 Body Press and +1 Earth Power, respectively, so after some chip damage, Diancie can beat them.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Flygon, Swampert, and Gastrodon are trouble for Diancie, as they threaten Diancie out with their Ground-type STAB attacks and can take advantage of it by setting up entry hazards. If Diancie is running Moonblast, it can somewhat damage them, but if its not, it is an almost free switch-in for them, as Earth Power and Body Press aren't doing enough to threaten them.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Offensive or defensive Water-types such as Inteleon, Basculegion, and Vaporeon can all threaten Diancie with their STAB attacks. They can also use Diancie for momentum and pivot with U-turn or Flip Turn, and they can even force Diancie to Terastallize or switch out. Inteleon and Basculegion both cannot deal with Diancie when under Trick Room, as they get defeated before they can act.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Offensive Grass-types such as Torterra and Tsareena make progress against and threaten Diancie; however they can't comfortably switch in on offensive sets. Torterra and Tsareena force Diancie to switch out or Terastallize, and the latter can even remove its Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin. Both of those Pokémon can't defeat Diancie when in Trick Room, as they get KOed first by +1 Moonblast</p>",

Body Press hits Steel-types like Copperajah and Registeel trying to switch in on Diancie, and it can take advantage of Diamond Storm's chance to boost its Defense. Encore prevents Diancie's passivity from getting taken advantage of too easily by opposing hazard setters and setup sweepers, such as Klefki and Iron Thorns alike, but Moonblast can be used to be able to hit Ground-types like Swampert and Flygon harder. Tera types for this set are focused on flipping Diancie's matchups. Tera Water gives Diancie a resistance to Steel- and Water-type attacks, letting it finish off Copperajah and Inteleon while maintaining its Fire resistance. However, Tera Steel trades Diancie's matchup against Fire-types for a strong defensive typing thay can take on hits from Munkidori, Sylveon, and Tsareena without issue. Tera Dragon on the other hand lets Diancie take on Rotom-C and Araquanid, but it completely throws away its matchup against Dragalge and Florges.</p> <p>Fire-types like Incineroar and Talonflame make for strong partners because they threaten Steel- and Grass-types that force Diancie out, such as Bronzong, Registeel, Tsareena, and Brambleghast. The aforementioned Grass-types, along with Rotom-C, also have great synergy with Diancie, as it checks Fire- and Flying-types for them. In return, they handle Ground- and Water-types like Flygon, Swampert, and Inteleon.

Earth Power offers coverage for the Steel- and Poison-types that can take Diancie's Moonblast comfortably such as Registeel, Copperajah, and Tentacruel. Trick Room lets Diancie turn the tables versus offense, using their Speed against them, whereas Stealth Rock works on offensive teams like Grassy Terrain ones that enjoy its typing, utility, and power but don't plan on sacrificing it immediately. Power Herb allows Diancie to immediately attack and get its Special Attack boost with Meteor Beam. No Speed EVs and IVs ensures Diancie can move as fast as possible under Trick Room, while 120 HP / 252 SpA / 136 Spe with a Modest nature lets Diancie outpace Vaporeon, Sylveon, and Incineroar; hit as hard as possible; and still be able to take attacks. Tera Grass gives Diancie a resistance to Grass-, Ground-, and Water-type attacks while giving it a neutrality to Steel-type moves, letting it set up Trick Room and attack more easily. Alternatively, Tera Fairy boosts Moonblast, letting Diancie power through Bronzong and Orthworm at times, as well as giving it a Fighting resistance. Tera Ground is an option to boost Earth Power's damage, which is really appreciated to get KOs it wouldn't otherwise.</p> <p>A lead to set up entry hazards such as Brambleghast or Froslass makes for a great partner, as it can help chip checks like Registeel, Alolan Muk, and Tentacruel into range for a KO. Mienshao and Breloom enjoy how Diancie can come in on and take advantage of Talonflame, and with it being downed, they don't need to worry about being revenge killed as easily or getting burned. Pokemon like Flygon, Drednaw, Oricorio-E, Galarian Articuno, and Iron Thorns that can chip away at and weaken Steel-types like Registeel and Copperajah for Diancie pair well with it too.</p>"

It also serves as one of the few viable users of Defog in the tier, taking advantage of the fear its powerful physical sets create to find turns to clear entry hazards. Its typing allows it to switch in on common attackers like Paldean Tauros-W, Breloom, and Flygon, and it often finds turns to set up in front of common defensive Water-types like Gastrodon, Vaporeon, and Milotic. Its ability to throw out powerful attacks is only enhanced by Long Reach, which allows it to avoid the threats of Chandelure's Flame Body, Bellibolt's Static, and Rocky Helmet. Decidueye does struggle with its mediocre Speed though, particularly on offensive sets. Even Swords Dance-boosted Shadow Sneak does not often pick off neutral targets from full HP without Tera Ghost, leaving Decidueye open to being revenge killed by many faster and Ghost-immune foes such as Cinccino, Porygon-Z, and Tera Normal Toxtricity. Decidueye's STAB types are also walled by several common Pokemon, namely Overqwil, Alolan Muk, and Incineroar. Defog sets must also be careful of several Competitive and Defiant Pokemon, such as Kilowattrel, Galarian Articuno, Milotic, and Tornadus.</p>",

Many other Pokemon such as Grafaiai, Toxicroak, and Cinccino threaten Decidueye with Knock Off as well.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types and Fire-type Attacks</strong>: Fire-types, such as the previously mentioned Incineroar along with Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion, threaten to blow Decidueye away with powerful Fire-type attacks. However, the latter two can be threatened with Shadow Sneak. Speedy attackers like Scream Tail and Flygon can also run Fire Blast to threaten Decidueye.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Decidueye must be wary of powerful Flying-type Pokemon like Scyther, Kilowattrel, Galarian Articuno, and Tornadus. The latter three also threaten Defog sets with Competitive and Defiant boosts. However, none of them want to switch into Poltergeist and Spirit Shackle, and they can also be picked off with Shadow Sneak.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Alolan Ninetales can survive most of Decidueye's attacks with the Defense boost from snow, threatens it back with Blizzard and Freeze-Dry, and can lock it into Swords Dance with Encore.

Shadow Sneak lets Decidueye pick off and revenge kill faster foes, particularly Ghost-weak ones like Chandelure, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Munkidori. Tera Ghost lets Shadow Sneak OHKO Inteleon, Kilowattrel, and, after Stealth Rock damage, Flamigo, while Tera Fairy and Water act defensively to give Decidueye a chance to set up in front of Dark-types like Scrafty and Fire-types like Incineroar, respectively.</p> <p>Decidueye appreciates teammates like Munkidori and Chandelure that are also checked by Dark- and Fire-types, since it can work together with these partners to wear down shared checks like Alolan Muk and Incineroar. Particularly when using Spirit Shackle over Poltergeist, entry hazard support from teammates like Froslass, Diancie, and Bronzong can be helpful to wear down checks and guarantee KOs. Backup physical attackers can work to overwhelm solid physical walls like Amoonguss and Bellibolt, so the Paldean Tauros formes, Toxicroak, and Flygon can support Decidueye very well. On top of that, they can capitalize on Pokemon that Decidueye might faint against like Incineroar, Overqwil, and Alolan Muk.

    "overview": "<p>The combination of Knock Off, good typing, and Intimidate makes Incineroar a great wallbreaker while being a solid defensive Pokemon. Sword Dance sets can make Incineroar into a great wallbreaker, since many defensive staples like Amoonguss, Galarian Slowbro, and Registeel just drop to its Swords Dance-boosted STAB attacks. Also, Incineroar easily checks the common Ghost-, Grass-, and Steel-types like Chandelure, Decidueye, and Klefki, meaning it can take advantage of its utility moves with a defensive pivot set if it wishes. It has Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off to cripple incoming physical wallbreakers like Toxicroak, Flygon, and Paldean Tauros-W and item-reliant Pokemon like Diancie, Avalugg, and Swampert. Defensive Incineroar is also solid for handling special wallbreakers such as Chandelure, Porygon-Z, and Heavy-Duty Boots Munkidori. However, Incineroar's low Speed stat makes it very easy for wallbreakers with a middling Speed tier like Basculegion, Breloom, and Heracross to outspeed and destroy it with their own STAB attacks. Incineroar's reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots can be felt, since it has to be wary of switching into opposing Knock Off from Tsareena, Alolan Muk, and Wo-Chien. It even has to worry about switching into the Pokemon it checks best, Chandelure, as it carries Trick to cripple Incineroar. Incineroar also lacks any form of recovery, making it easily worn down over the course of a battle.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Close Combat is an option to hit many foes neutrally like Swampert and Diancie while also hitting opposing Incineroar super effectively. Flame Charge gives Incineroar the opportunity to become a late-game cleaner after picking off a weakened threat. Alternatively, Trailblaze can be used alongside Tera Grass to hit Water-types super effectively, but it's pretty reliant on Terastallization to do good damage. Iron Head can be used on Swords Dance Incineroar to surprise Sylveon, Diancie, and Florges, but the ability to pivot, boost its Speed, or use a high-Base Power coverage move tends to be better overall. Weakness Policy + Power Trip sets can be used on hyper offense teams, letting Incineroar become a dangerous sweeper. Incineroar has a bunch of usable defensive Tera types, but they are really inconsistent for many teams. Tera Flying helps Incineroar take on Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, but it retains its weakness to Stealth Rock. Tera Grass gives Incineroar a resistance to Water- and Ground-type attacks but gives it a bad matchup against opposing Fire-types like Chandelure, Infernape, and Hisuian Typhlosion.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Vaporeon, Milotic, and Swampert can switch into its Flare Blitz and threaten Incineroar back with their own STAB attacks, but they have to be wary about switching into a boosted Knock Off from Swords Dance sets. Offensive Water-types like Inteleon and Basculegion, while they have to be worried about switching into its Knock Off, can easily destroy it.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Flygon, Swampert, and Rhydon destroy Incineroar with their STAB Earthquake, but they have to be wary about switching into Will-O-Wisp from bulkier sets.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Paldean Tauros-W, Toxicroak, and Breloom outspeed Incineroar and destroy it with their STAB Fighting-type attacks. Infernape and Paldean Tauros-W resist both of Incineroar's STAB attacks and use it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Diancie</strong>: Diancie can tank Incineroar's STAB attacks very well and use it to set up Stealth Rock or hit it back with its STAB Rock-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Item Displacement</strong>: Common Knock Off users like Tsareena, Alolan Muk, and Wo-Chien can threaten Incineroar by removing its Heavy-Duty Boots, making it a lot weaker to entry hazards. On top of this, Pokemon it would love to switch into like Chandelure, Munkidori, and Porygon-Z often carry Trick to cripple it.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>U-turn allows Incineroar to pivot on, chip away at, and not get taken advantage of by its checks like Swampert and Diancie. Earthquake, on the other hand, provides a powerful attack with no drawback that also hits the common Rock- and and Fire-types like Diancie, Dragalge, and Paldean Tauros-F. An Adamant nature can be used to allow Incineroar to 2HKO Alolan Muk, but a Jolly nature is useful for outspeeding foes like Modest Choice Specs Sylveon and unboosted Torterra. A specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 212 SpD / 48 Spe with a Careful nature can alternatively be used on Swords Dance sets, letting it better pivot into foes like Chandelure, Munkidori, and Meloetta; the Speed EVs let Incineroar outpace Alolan Muk. Tera Poison gives Incineroar an immunity to poison from Alolan Muk and Amoonguss while having a resistance to Fighting-type attacks. However, Tera Fairy provides a more well-rounded defensive typing that isn't weak to Ground-type attacks while still resisting Fighting-type attacks. Tera Ghost allows Incineroar to completely blank Close Combat, and it helps to revenge kill Cinccino. This comes at a trade-off of it having no other useful resistances, though.</p> <p>Incineroar can partner with other pivots like Flygon and Swampert, which tend to draw in Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tsareena for Incineroar to prey on and form a VoltTurn core able to chip away at each other's checks. Entry hazard removers like Brambleghast, Tsareena, and Tentacruel can be great partners, since they can remove entry hazards if Incineroar loses its Heavy-Duty Boots. Incineroar can struggle against bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Milotic, and Swampert that can tank its STAB attacks, so it pairs with Pokemon like Toxicroak, Amoonguss, and Gastrodon, as they can check the aforementioned Water-types. Fairy- and Poison-types like Sylveon and Dragalge appreciate Incineroar for checking Steel-types like Registeel, Klefki, and Bronzong; in return, they can check Fighting-types like Paldean Tauros-W and Flamigo.</p>"

However, U-turn can be used because it allows Incineroar to pivot out from Diancie and Registeel, which would usually be immune to Parting Shot due to their Clear Body ability. The given EV spread allows Incineroar to get the jump on Vaporeon while having as much special bulk as possible. Tera Fairy provides it the ability to check Dragon- and Fighting-types like Flygon and Heracross while also letting it resist the omnipresent U-turn. Alternatively, Tera Dragon gives Incineroar the ability to check a myriad of special attackers like Toxtricity and Inteleon. Tera Water is similar to Tera Dragon but replaces a Grass resistance for an Ice resistance, making Incineroar better against Inteleon.</p> <p>Grass-types like Tsareena, Brambleghast, and Amoonguss are great partners for Incineroar, since they can handle bulky Water- and Ground-types such as Vaporeon, Swampert, and Gastrodon.

Additionally, Sylveon can provide Incineroar with recovery by passing it a Wish. Wallbreakers like Inteleon, Munkidori, and Toxtricity appreciate Incineroar's slow Parting Shot, as they can get a free entry on Rock-, Fighting-, and Water-types that tend to switch in on Incineroar. Setup sweepers like Swords Dance Toxicroak and Dragon Dance Flygon similarly appreciate Incineroar's Parting Shot weakening foes and it giving them more opportunities to set up. Incineroar's longevity is limited and can be cut severely if it loses its Heavy-Duty Boots, so it pairs well with entry hazard removers such as Tsareena, Tentacruel, and Brambleghast.</p>"

While offensive Tsareena profiles as a solid wallbreaker that can take over games thanks to Rapid Spin's Speed boost, defensive sets are fantastic at checking the swathes of offensive Ground-types in NU, especially Krookodile and Flygon, and its access to Synthesis is a huge factor in it outclassing Brambleghast, its primary competition. Tsareena faces some very real struggles defensively, though, as almost every Ground-type it aims to check carries super effective coverage, like Gunk Shot from Krookodile and Megahorn from Rhyperior, that threatens to KO it with minimal chip damage required. Offensive sets aren't very fast without a Speed boost and easily pressured by other wallbreakers like Chandelure and Munkidori as well as fast utility options in Noivern and Talonflame. Meanwhile, defensive sets are quite easy to exploit due to their reliance on Knock Off with Pokemon like RestTalk Alolan Muk, Vileplume, and Dragalge.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tsareena has other usable Tera types than the ones listed, but they lack consistency across teams. Tera Dark is good for teams that lack a Ghost resistance and amps up Knock Off's damage, but it offers little else. Tera Ghost is a harder answer to Fighting-types than Tera Poison, but it's just as bad into Krookodile and gives Tsareena a horrible Alolan Muk matchup. Tera Fire is similar to Tera Dragon in helping Tsareena against Fire-types, although Tsareena gains a Water weakness. Choice Scarf sets are good at revenge killing priority-reliant setup sweepers like Lycanroc-D and Lucario and don't have to worry about Klefki's Thunder Wave.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: All of Talonflame, Noivern, and Acrobatics Thundurus outspeed Tsareena and beat it with relative ease. Talonflame hates losing its item, though, and both Noivern and Thundurus are vulnerable to Triple Axel from offensive sets.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Alolan Muk is a great Tsareena answer, especially if it's RestTalk. Other Poison-types like Dragalge, Vileplume, and Munkidori are good checks but less consistent. The former two cannot survive Knock Off followed by Triple Axel, while the latter is too frail to take Knock Off from either Tsareena set.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Incineroar counters Tsareena with ease, only fearing the rare High Jump Kick. Although Knock Off obliterates Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion, they both can spinblock Tsareena, tank its Power Whip, and OHKO it with their Fire-type attacks barring a well-timed Terastallization.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Tsareena doubles as a source of entry hazard removal and a potent wallbreaker. Knock Off punishes switch-ins such as Talonflame and Magnezone while obliterating Chandelure, and Triple Axel deletes opposing Grass-types like Vileplume, Venusaur, and Rotom-C as well as Noivern. If you wish to tap further into Tsareena's utility movepool, U-turn is optional over Triple Axel, still giving it an out against any of its checks while enabling its stronger teammates. High Jump Kick is another coverage move you can try, as it's Tsareena's best option for hitting Steel-type hazard setters like Copperajah and Registeel and does good damage to Incineroar. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Tsareena bypass hazard damage, which increases its proficiency as a spinner, but Lum Berry helps against Talonflame's Flame Body and Slowbro's Scald. Tsareena usually shouldn't be Terastallizing, but Tera Dragon potentially lets it KO a Chandelure or Hisuian Typhlosion with Knock Off and gives Tsareena a good sun matchup, while Tera Steel blanks Munkidori's STAB moves, potentially lets Tsareena beat Cloyster, and helps it against Alolan Muk.</p> <p>Tsareena is great at luring in and beating certain Poison-types like Dragalge, Vileplume, and Venusaur with Triple Axel; make sure to pair it with teammates like Mienshao, Thundurus, and Sylveon that can take advantage of this. Furthermore, Mienshao especially, as well as other physical attackers like Gallade and Infernape, appreciate Tsareena removing Talonflame's Heavy-Duty Boots and making it easier to overwhelm with Stealth Rock up. Similarly, teammates like Choice Specs Noivern, Chandelure, and Hisuian Typhlosion all appreciate Tsareena's Rapid Spin, and the latter two can beat Steel-type checks like Klefki, Registeel, and Magnezone for Tsareena. Talonflame is perhaps the most common switch-in to Tsareena, so Pokemon like Diancie and Slowbro that easily switch into it are helpful to have.</p>"

Although they possess super effective coverage moves for it, they can't OHKO it, and Synthesis keeps Tsareena healthy throughout the game so it can stay out of KO range from these threats. The biggest boon to this set, though, is destroying Klefki; it can't do enough damage with Foul Play thanks to the bulk investment, and Power Whip or Trop Kick will slowly beat it down. Trop Kick can be used over Power Whip for its accuracy, but you lose out on useful damage rolls like 2HKOing Diancie, 2HKOing Assault Vest Reuniclus after Stealth Rock, and OHKOing Krookodile. Tsareena will rarely want to Terastallize, but Tera Poison is nice to consistently answer Fighting-types like Mienshao and non-Meteor Mash Lucario and makes Tsareena immune to poison from Alolan Muk at the cost of becoming weak to Earthquake; Tera Dragon aids against Fire-types like Hisuian Typhlosion and retains several resistances to types like Water, Grass, and Electric; and Tera Steel is useful for checking Fairy- and Poison-types such as Sylveon and Munkidori as well as Cloyster.</p> <p>Tsareena creates great defensive cores with common entry hazard setters like Diancie and Rhyperior.

Thwackey uses Wood Hammer to chip down walls like Registeel and Alolan Muk that sweepers like Oricorio-P and Uxie have trouble with. It can also clean up games with Grassy Glide, picking off weakened foes like Cincinno and Swampert. Against opposing Psychic Terrain teams, Thwackey's low Speed is a benefit, as it underspeeds Indeedee-M on lead and sets its Terrain second. Thwackey's pure Grass typing benefits it against foes like Basculegion-M and Flygon but leaves it open to being taken advantage of by attackers like Munkidori, Alolan Ninetales, and Infernape. While Thwackey does have a decent Attack stat, particularly with Grassy Terrain-boosted STAB attacks, its niche is entirely on Grassy Terrain teams, as its stats make it simply incapable of standing up against the metagame on its own.</p>",

U-turn allows Thwackey to cleanly pivot in its more powerful teammates while preserving itself to reset its Terrain later.

It can choose from a number of useful Tera types; Poison gives it resistances to Close Combat from foes like Flamigo, U-turn from foes like Flygon, and Poison-type attacks from Munkidori and Alolan Muk.

Cincinno pairs well with the two Oricorio formes by removing entry hazards for them. Torterra in particular benefits from Grassy Terrain, boosting its powerful Grass-type STAB attacks to immense heights while allowing it to use Grassy Glide to defeat foes that are faster than it after a Shell Smash. The boost from Grassy Terrain even allows +2 Tera Grass Life Orb Torterra to OHKO Bronzong with Wood Hammer. Stealth Rock Meteor Beam Diancie and Fire-type attackers like Chandelure, Arcanine, and Paldean Tauros-F also work well with Thwackey, using Grassy Terrain to weaken Earthquake and restore their own HP. These sweepers also appreciate Spikes to weaken opposing walls and break Focus Sashes, so Klefki works well and itself benefits from Grassy Terrain weakening Earthquake.

Even when facing Water-immune Pokemon like Gastrodon, Toxicroak, and Vaporeon, Inteleon still has a way to flip the matchup in its favor in its U-turn, which lets it bring in teammates like Breloom, Flygon, and Toxicroak to take advantage of these checks. On the other hand, Inteleon does face a bit of competition from Basculegion-M and Paldean Tauros-W, as the former can switch up its moves because it largely uses Mystic Water, the latter has Intimidate, and both have access to priority and easily fit coverage for Toxicroak; however, it isn't hindered by contact punishment such as Talonflame's Flame Body and Vileplume's Rocky Helmet and Effect Spore. It also has to deal with not being able to use its strongest move when up against teams with Water-immune Pokemon, which greatly halts Inteleon's progress-making, as it's almost always forced to use U-turn against them if it doesn't want to give up momentum.</p>",

Inteleon can drop U-turn in favor of running a second STAB move, like Surf or Snipe Shot, alongside Hydro Pump, letting it choose the right move depending on its situation; however, losing momentum versus Water-immune and -resistant Pokemon can be annoying at times. Tera Blast Grass can be run to snipe Water-immune Pokemon like Vaporeon and Gastrodon, but because Inteleon has to Terastallize to make use of it and already has access to U-turn, it typically is unnecessary and thus isn't used.

Similarly, Dragalge can take Inteleon's Hydro Pump decently but dislikes having to take an Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Brambleghast, Tsareena, and Breloom can take Inteleon's Hydro Pump and proceed to KO it with their Grass-type STAB moves, but they can't do this repeatedly. Similarly, bulkier Grass-types like Brute Bonnet and Vileplume can switch into Hydro Pump and threaten with Seed Bomb or Giga Drain, respectively; however, the former's lack of recovery and the latter's poor Special Defense leads them to being overwhelmed.

In return, Inteleon handles Fire- and Ground-types for the former two and can easily overwhelm physical walls Flygon brings in. Inteleon is quite powerful, but to achieve any of its 2HKOs, especially those against Water-type checks like Milotic and Vaporeon, it requires entry hazards to chip away at its foes; Copperajah, Bronzong, Gligar, and Klefki all synergize well to fill this role. Even without entry hazards, however, most special walls that do not resist Inteleon's STAB attacks like Bronzong, Alolan Muk, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro have a hard time switching in, as Bronzong is 2HKOed right away and Alolan Muk and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro are 2HKOed after minimal chip damage.

With access to Strong Jaw-boosted Ice Fang and Crunch, even typically sturdy physical walls such as Bronzong and Amoonguss can struggle to take its attacks. Drednaw also naturally outspeeds the majority of the tier after a Shell Smash boost, including even +1 Speed Cinccino as well as Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Munkidori and Flamigo. However, Drednaw can struggle with Grass- and Water-types such as Breloom and Paldean Tauros-W, as they can take one of its hits and KO it back with either Seed Bomb or Close Combat, respectively. Furthermore, priority users such as Toxicroak, Barraskewda, and Basculegion-M can revenge kill Drednaw once it has sustained solid chip damage. Drednaw can also struggle to OHKO common walls such as Bellibolt and Amoonguss, even if it carries the right coverage options for them, forcing it to rely on entry hazards. Drednaw also can struggle with four-moveslot syndrome, as Pokemon such as Toxicroak and Paldean Tauros-W can wall Drednaw if it doesn't have Tera Blast Flying or Earthquake, but if it drops Crunch, then Bronzong can be a big problem.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Air Balloon can be used to allow Drednaw to set up against common Ground-types such as Rhyperior and Flygon. Focus Sash allows Drednaw to guarantee a setup opportunity even in the face of Pokemon such as Flamigo and Tsareena that might otherwise OHKO it. Tera Ghost gives an immunity to Choice-locked Fighting-type attackers such as Toxicroak and Paldean Tauros-W, allowing Drednaw to potentially set up again on them while also giving it a resistance to Flygon's First Impression.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Breloom and Amoonguss do quite well against Drednaw, as they can easily take a Liquidation and KO it back with either Seed Bomb or Giga Drain, respectively. However, Tera Blast Flying and Ice Fang variants of Drednaw can easily OHKO them.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Paldean Tauros-W and Vaporeon can stomach any of Drednaw's attacks and either KO it with Close Combat for the former or phaze it out with Roar for the latter. The former is OHKOed by Tera Blast Flying, though, and Vaporeon can get heavily chipped by a +2 Tera Dark Strong Jaw-boosted Crunch.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority users such as Flygon, Toxicroak, and especially Breloom can threaten a weakened Drednaw with good damage through their priority moves, though due to its good natural bulk, the first two need significant chip damage to OHKO Drednaw.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Stone Edge can be used if Drednaw wants to free up its item slot, while Rock Blast in conjunction with Loaded Dice gives Drednaw a much more reliable STAB move, though at the cost of being revenge killed by priority moves from higher health ranges. Ice Fang hits Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Tsareena, and Flygon for large damage. Crunch allows Drednaw to hit checks such as Galarian Slowbro, Bronzong, and Uxie, while Tera Blast Flying allows Drednaw to snipe usual counters in Breloom, Toxicroak, and Paldean Tauros-W. Alternatively, Earthquake can hit Steel-types such as Copperajah and Klefki while targeting Bellibolt as well. White Herb makes Drednaw much more reliable against common priority users such as Baculegion-M. Shell Armor can be used on sets without Crunch or Ice Fang to give Drednaw security against critical hits while setting up. Tera Dark gives Crunch a chance to OHKO Amoonguss after Stealth Rock and also gives Drednaw an immunity to Klefki's Prankster Thunder Wave, while Tera Flying flips Drednaw's usual weakness to Ground, Grass, and Fighting. Tera Ground gives Drednaw an immunity to Electric-type attacks from Raikou and Kilowattrel as well as Thunder Wave immunity against Klefki and boosts the power of Earthquake to OHKO Pokemon such as Bellibolt.</p> <p>Drednaw fits best on hyper offense and offense teams, which heavily appreciate its ability to easily end games. Pokemon such as Toxicroak and Decidueye that can take advantage of bulky Water- and Grass-types are good teammates, as they can use these typical counters to Drednaw as a setup opportunity. Entry hazard setters like Klefki and Scream Tail can allow Drednaw to beat usual counters such as Vaporeon and Amoonguss. On the other hand, Cincinno can remove hazards on Drednaw's side to allow it to more easily set up, while it can help overwhelm the Steel-types that Cincinno typically struggles with. Other physical sweepers such as Flamigo, Flygon, and Overqwil pair well with Drednaw, as together they can overwhelm walls that they struggle with such as Bellibolt, Bronzong, and Copperajah, respectively. Special attackers like Toxtricity and Scream Tail also help Drednaw, as they can take advantage of its usual checks such as Grass- and Fighting-types and use them as a setup opportunity. Alolan Ninetales can not only set up Aurora Veil to help aid Drednaw in sweeping, but it can also revenge kill the common Fighting-types that Drednaw struggles against such as Paldean Tauros-W and Flamigo with Moonblast.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Barraskewda thrives in NU as a powerful physical attacker that is also the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the tier, which allows it to act as both a fast, supportive pivot and a speedy wallbreaker. Barraskewda's high base Attack allows it to consistently deal damage with its STAB attacks, and with access to Close Combat and Psychic Fangs, it can even break through Water-immune foes like Vaporeon and Toxicroak. In addition, its Speed allows it to revenge kill fast foes such as Kilowattrel, Raikou, and non-Choice Scarf Munkidori. However, Barraskewda can at times rely on prediction, as it requires a Choice Band for certain 2HKOs, such as Tera Fighting Close Combat on Vaporeon and Bellibolt. It can also struggle to run all the moves it needs, generally needing to drop a coverage or STAB move no matter what role it wants to fill. Furthermore, Barraskewda has next to no bulk, and is vulnerable to priority from foes such as Breloom, Flygon, and Decidueye. NU also features several Pokemon that resist Barraskewda's attacks or force it to Tera to secure a KO, such as Amoonguss and Water-immune foes like Vaporeon and Toxicroak.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Barraskewda can use Throat Chop to hit Basculegion-M as well as Galarian Slowbro, and it helps against sound move users like Bronzong and Toxtricity. Tera Poison can be used to boost the power of Poison Jab as well, OHKOing physically defensive Sylveon after Stealth Rock chip damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-immune Pokemon</strong>: Vaporeon and Toxicroak wall Barraskewda's STAB options and restore HP while doing so. Barraskewda is forced to Tera to 2HKO with Close Combat, and is completely walled if Vaporeon has a relevant Tera type. Toxicroak, however, must be very cautious of Psychic Fangs.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Foes like Tsareena, Breloom, and Amoonguss can all resist Barraskewda's Water-type attacks and restore HP in order to do so multiple times, while Breloom can use it as setup fodder. However, all of them are vulnerable to its coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Barraskewda's nonexistent bulk makes it vulnerable to being revenge killed by essentially any Choice Scarf user, such as Flygon, Munkidori, and Chandelure.

Close Combat with Choice Band and Tera Fighting 2HKOes checks like Vaporeon and Toxicroak. Liquidation is Barraskewda's most spammable STAB move, dealing immense damage to any foe that doesn't resist it. Alternatively, Aqua Jet can revenge kill faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf Munkidori and Dragon Dance Flygon, while Ice Fang lets Barraskewda hit Dragon- and Grass-types such as Altaria, Breloom, and Tsareena. Choice Band Psychic Fangs allows Barraskewda to 2HKO Amoonguss, which otherwise walls it, while OHKOing Toxicroak, though Poison Jab can instead be used to hit Fairy- and Grass-types such as Sylveon, Scream Tail, and Tsareena super effectively. Heavy-Duty Boots can provide Barraskewda some additional survivability on teams that don't control entry hazards well as well as allow it to act more freely as a pivot and as speed control. Choice Band, as mentioned before, makes several damage rolls possible, and generally supports Barraskewda's role as a wallbreaker, whereas Mystic Water prevents Barraskewda from being Choice-locked while maintaining some power, but makes the previously mentioned 2HKOs impossible. 168 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow Barraskewda to outpace the entire unboosted metagame, including Kilowattrel, Inteleon, and Munkidori. This allows the rest of the EVs to be poured into Barraskewda's HP to aid its role as a supportive but offensive pivot. However, a more offensive spread with maximum Attack and Speed is preferred on wallbreaking Choice Band and Mystic Water sets. On these sets, an Adamant nature can be used for the improved wallbreaking it offers, but a Jolly nature ensures Barraskewda can still outspeed all foes. Tera Water is a viable alternative to Tera Fighting, letting Barraskewda OHKO Flygon and 2HKO Swampert with Liquidation.</p> <p>Barraskewda, particularly on Choice Band sets, requires teammates that can switch into Water-immune Pokemon like Vaporeon and Toxicroak. Thus, it partners well with teammates like Poison Heal Breloom, Toxicroak, and Galarian Slowbro. Pivoting sets with Heavy-Duty Boots lure in psychical walls like Bellibolt and Amoonguss, and thus pair well with special wallbreakers like Chandelure and Toxtricity. Steel-types such as Bronzong and Copperajah also work as switch-ins to checks like Amoonguss and Bellibolt and provide Stealth Rock support. Teammates that can help overload these physical walls, such as Flygon, Flamigo, and Rhyperior, further support Barraskewda's ability to break through. Entry hazard setters such as the previously mentioned Steel- and Ground-types, as well as others like Gligar, Uxie, and Diancie, help Barraskewda break down foes that would otherwise switch in on it such as Galarian Slowbro, Vaporeon, and Amoonguss. Barraskewda also performs extremely well on rain teams, accompanied by setters like Klefki and Tornadus as well as by other wallbreakers like Basculegion-M, Kilowattrel, and Kingdra.</p>"

  "Toxtricity": {
    "overview": "<p>Toxtricity is an extremely powerful special wallbreaker thanks to its already high Special Attack being further bolstered by  Punk Rock and powerful moves to take advantage of it. Toxtricity can choose to capitalize on these traits by either equipping Choice Specs to severely limit its switch-ins, which lets it 2HKO special walls like Bronzong and Alolan Muk, or it can run Shift Gear to become a setup sweeper and surpass Choice Scarf Flygon and Mienshao's Speed tier. Comparable wallbreakers like Chandelure and Porygon-Z lack Toxtricity's ability to gain momentum with Volt Switch, and they lack access to a high-power no-drawback move like Boomburst. While Toxtricity has plenty of power, its Speed is lacking, with non-Shift Gear sets being outsped and revenge killed by foes like Basculegion-M, Chandelure, and Paldean Tauros-W. Furthermore, even though its typing has good resistances, it is offset by its fairly meager bulk. This makes Toxtricity vulnerable to priority, such as Toxicroak's Sucker Punch and, particularly after Tera Normal, Breloom's Mach Punch. Toxtricity's lackluster bulk can also be seen when trying to set up on Shift Gear sets, as those require two turns to be fully set up: one to boost its Speed and the other its Special Attack with Throat Spray. If it does just one, it leaves itself open to being revenge killed easily.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Encore is a reasonable move that can potentially grant Toxtricity turns to set up, but carrying it requires dropping important coverage. Choice item sets can choose to run Choice Scarf to surprise and outspeed normally faster non-Choice Scarf foes like Life Orb Mienshao and Heavy-Duty Boots Munkidori trying to revenge kill it, but it loses breaking power as a result. Toxtricity can choose to run Heavy-Duty Boots for additional flexibility and more longevity.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Bronzong, Copperajah, and Registeel switch into Sludge Wave and Boomburst, but they can be threatened by Overdrive or pivoted on with Volt Switch, so they must be careful to correctly predict Toxtricity's move choice.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types like Flygon and specially defensive Gastrodon resist both of Toxtricity's STAB attacks, block Volt Switch, and threaten to OHKO Toxtricity with Earthquake and Earth Power.

Snarl is weaker versus other targets, though. Tera Normal lets Boomburst OHKO Vileplume and Swampert.

Play Rough hits Fighting- and Dark-types like Mienshao, Breloom, and Wo-Chien, but it's rarely used. Supercell Slam targets bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Milotic, and Tentacruel. However, Copperajah struggles to fit it, and Supercell Slam's risk of recoil damage makes it very niche. Tera Water lets Copperajah better handle Ground- and Water-types like Flygon and Inteleon, but Tera Dragon is preferred for not giving it a weakness to Grass- and Electric-type attacks from Breloom and Kilowattrel. Tera Ghost gives Copperajah a useful immunity to Fighting-type attacks from foes like Mienshao and Toxicroak while spinblocking Tsareena and Brambleghast.

However, the lack of a reliable physical Ghost-type STAB move hurts Basculegion-M greatly, making it susceptible to Pokemon that it otherwise would have a chance against, namely bulky Water-types such as Vaporeon and Gastrodon. Additionally, Basculegion-M's Speed is rather average, leaving it susceptible to being revenge killed by common Pokemon such as Kilowattrel and Brambleghast as well as Choice Scarf users like Infernape, Rotom-C, and Munkidori as well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A mixed attacking Assault Vest set can function as a decent bulky offensive pivot, leveraging Basculegion-M's solid special bulk against common special attackers like Munkidori. However, Basculegion-M's typing leaves it vulnerable to common special attackers such as Chandelure, Kilowattrel, and Rotom-C, making its defensive use somewhat inconsistent. Additionally, the lack of reliable recovery makes it prone to being chipped down over time, forcing it to be paired with a Wish user and making it much less efficient into common threats. Choice Specs Basculegion-M is a decent option, with its stronger coverage options in Shadow Ball and Ice Beam, alongside Adaptability, compensating for its otherwise middling Special Attack stat. This set can threaten typical counterplay to physical Basculegion-M sets such as Vaporeon, Toxicroak, Dragalge, and Amoonguss with either Shadow Ball or Ice Beam.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-immune Pokemon</strong>: Vaporeon is an excellent answer to Basculegion-M thanks to Water Absorb making it immune to Basculegion-M's Water-type STAB moves alongside strong physical bulk with investment making it hardly deterred by any of Basculegion-M's coverage moves. Gastrodon functions similarly, albeit with more reliable recovery with Recover and the ability to turn Basculegion-M's Water-type moves into an opportunity for offensive momentum thanks to Storm Drain. Toxicroak can also switch into Basculegion-M's Water-type moves courtesy of Dry Skin and use Basculegion-M as fodder for setting up Swords Dance. However, Psychic Fangs obliterates Toxicroak, so it must be mindful of Basculegion-M's choice of coverage.</p> <p><strong>Water- and Dragon-types</strong>: Milotic is generally a solid check to Basculegion-M thanks to Recover giving it extremely important longevity as well as Flip Turn letting Milotic use Basculegion-M as a chance to gain momentum. Inteleon can generally switch into Basculegion-M once and, in return, outspeed and OHKO Basculegion-M with Dark Pulse after some chip damage. Dragalge's solid physical bulk lets it come in on Basculegion-M's Water-type STAB moves and either wear it down with Sludge Bomb or finish it off with Draco Meteor. Paldean Tauros-W's high physical bulk combined with Intimidate and Bulk Up lets it easily come in on Basculegion-M's Water-type STAB moves, but it must exercise caution against sets with Psychic Fangs.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tsareena are able to handle Basculegion-M's Water-type moves outside of rain quite effectively and can overwhelm it with their STAB moves. Amoonguss in particular can also take advantage of Basculegion-M's presence for longevity with Giga Drain and Toxic. However, both of these Pokemon must be wary of Choice Band Ice Fang, as they are vulnerable to being 2HKOed by it. Amoonguss also must look out for Psychic Fangs.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Basculegion-M's bulk, while decent, leaves it vulnerable to various faster Pokemon with super effective coverage. Dark-types and Pokemon with Dark-type coverage such as Infernape, Cinccino, and Inteleon can all OHKO Basculegion-M with their respective Dark-type attacks after some minor chip damage. Other faster offensive Pokemon such as Tsareena, Kilowattrel, and Rotom-C can overwhelm Basculegion-M with super effective moves. However, all of these Pokemon have to be wary of Basculegion-M under rain, and non-Choice Scarf variants have to fear a possible Choice Scarf on Basculegion-M, as the majority of them are susceptible to being OHKOed by Basculegion-M's Wave Crash.</p>",

On the other hand, Pain Split lets Basculegion-M simply recover some HP while simultaneously dealing damage. Leftovers is preferred, since it provides passive healing, mitigating Substitute's impact on Basculegion-M's HP. However, Metronome can capitalize on Substitute giving Basculegion-M free turns, letting it continually attack and more easily beat Vaporeon and Gastrodon, and Heavy-Duty Boots means Basculegion-M doesn't need to worry about constant chip damage from entry hazards, though this forces Basculegion-M to run Pain Split if it wishes to have any form of recovery. Jolly and Timid natures can also be used so that Basculegion-M outspeeds Tsareena, Breloom, and Toxicroak, but the wallbreaking power of Adamant and Modest is typically better. Tera Water increases the power of both Liquidation and Surf, letting Basculegion-M break through walls more easily, while Tera Dark allows it to take Ghost-type attacks from Chandelure and opposing Basculegion-M as well as Dark-type moves like Incineroar's Knock Off if necessary.</p> <p>Gastrodon and Roar Vaporeon are the main roadblocks for Basculegion-M, so partners that can help pressure them like Breloom, Toxicroak, and Freeze-Dry Alolan Ninetales make for good pairings. In return, Basculegion-M can whittle down Amoonguss for Breloom as well as take care of Galarian Slowbro and Bronzong for Toxicroak and Alolan Ninetales. Pivots like Munkidori, Flygon, and Whimsicott that draw in Pokemon that Basculegion-M can set Substitute on and take advantage of, like Bronzong, Vaporeon, and Toxicroak, are greatly appreciated, though Basculegion-M must be cautious of Toxicroak's Knock Off sets. Substitute Basculegion-M sets excel at weakening defensive Water-resistant Pokemon like Amoonguss, Milotic, and Tentacruel, meaning it can pave the way for partners like Flygon, Incineroar, and Paldean Tauros-F. Avalugg is often a hard check to get past for Basculegion-M, but specially oriented sets are good at luring it in and dealing great damage. This can be capitalized on by physical attackers like Overqwil, Scyther, and Flygon. Faster Ghost-types such as Hisuian Typhlosion, Chandelure, and Brambleghast can be problematic for Basculegion-M, causing Ghost-resistant and -immune teammates like Incineroar, Scrafty, Porygon2, and Dudunsparce to be necessary. Powerful Grass-, Electric-, and Dark-type Pokemon like Breloom, Kilowattrel, and Incineroar can stop Basculegion-M from keeping up its Substitute, so checks to these Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Bellibolt, and Diancie make for good partners.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Liquidation acts as a recoil-free alternative to Wave Crash at the cost of lower power. This is especially useful late-game, where Basculegion-M can wreck through weakened foes while still maintaining some health as to not be too vulnerable to revenge killers. Alternatively, Aqua Jet has more use outside of rain, being a useful priority tool to revenge kill faster Pokemon like Infernape, Munkidori, and Cinccino. For Basculegion-M's last move, it tends to opt for Tera Blast alongside Tera Ghost, as it gifts Basculegion-M a powerful and reliable physical Ghost-type STAB move to hit Water-resistant and -immune Pokemon like Vaporeon, Toxicroak, Milotic, and Tsareena. However, it forces Basculegion-M to Terastallize, so it can be off-putting at times as an option. Because of this, Psychic Fangs can be used as alternative to hit Vaporeon neutrally while also hitting checks like Toxicroak and Amoonguss super effectively. Ice Fang is another option that hits Dragon- and Grass-types like Dragalge, Tsareena, and Amoonguss attempting to switch into Basculegion-M's Water-type attacks. If not running Tera Blast, Tera Water can further boost Basculegion-M's already monstrous offensive profile, letting it 2HKO bulky Water-resistant Pokemon such as Dragalge, Amoonguss, and Tsareena with Wave Crash.</p> <p>Choice Band Basculegion-M is a premier threat on rain teams thanks to its immense power and Swift Swim boosting its Speed. As a result, rain setters such as Klefki and Tornadus are necessary picks. In addition to setting rain, the former has access to a vast array of utility moves such as Thunder Wave, which cripples Choice Scarf users like Infernape and Inteleon, and Spikes, while the latter can use rain itself to break through Grass-types like Amoonguss, Wo-Chien, and Tsareena. Other Swift Swim Pokemon such as Kingdra, Overqwil, and Ludicolo have solid synergy with Basculegion-M. Kingdra can overwhelm Vaporeon, Toxicroak, and Dragalge, making it less needed for Basculegion-M to Terastallize to hit these Pokemon. Overqwil can function as a late-game cleaner that appreciates Basculegion-M's insane wallbreaking letting it finish off games more easily, as it's able to finish off weakened foes. Ludicolo's Grass-type STAB moves and Ice-type coverage can be monumental in turning the tides against bulky Water-, Grass-, and Dragon- types like Gastrodon, Vaporeon, Amoonguss, and Dragalge. Other entry hazard setters such as Gligar, Flygon, and Swampert make for good teammates, further bolstering Basculegion-M's wallbreaking capabilities.</p>"

      "All-out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Aqua Jet gives Mystic Water sets a way to pick off faster Pokemon like Chandelure, Cinccino, and Munkidori, while Liquidation helps out Choice Scarf sets by providing a less risky version of Wave Crash with more PP and no recoil. Aqua Jet can even find use on Choice Scarf variants as a means to combat faster Choice Scarf users like Munkidori. Psychic Fangs provides solid coverage, hitting Poison-types that can take Water-type moves like Dragalge, Toxicroak, and Amoonguss. Ice Fang instead targets Grass- and Dragon-types like Tsareena, Amoonguss, Flygon, and Dragalge, albeit being weaker into the aforementioned Poison-type Pokemon. Mystic Water in tandem with Adaptability makes Basculegion-M's Water-type STAB moves extremely menacing while allowing it to switch its moves. This is further boosted by Tera Water, which makes Basculegion-M's Water-type attacks monstrously strong, doing immense damage to even the bulkiest of physically defensive Pokemon like Avalugg. Alternatively, Choice Scarf patches up Basculegion-M's otherwise average Speed and makes it a formidable revenge killer in its own right. Despite this, Basculegion-M's average Speed stat prevents it from being consistent as a revenge killer, as other Choice Scarf users such as Flygon, Infernape, Munkidori, and Porygon-Z can effectively outspeed and threaten it.</p> <p>All-out attacker Basculegion-M benefits many balance, bulky offense, and offense teams thanks to its ability to easily wallbreak and, if carrying Choice Scarf, its surprise factor as well. Entry hazard setters like Flygon, Swampert, and Diancie can set up Stealth Rock and Spikes, whittling down foes for Basculegion-M to more easily overwhelm. Hazard removal from the likes of Cinccino, Avalugg, and Tsareena is heavily appreciated, increasing Basculegion-M's longevity and making it more capable offensively late-game. Basculegion-M tends to draw in bulky Water- and Grass-types like Vaporeon, Amoonguss, Gastrodon, and Tsareena. As a result, offensive Pokemon that can capitalize on these foes, namely Toxicroak, Incineroar, Rotom-C, and Staraptor, can form potent wallbreaking cores with Basculegion-M. Additionally, the last three Pokemon can reliably bring Basculegion-M in with their pivot moves, giving Basculegion-M an easier time entering battle. Dark-types like Incineroar, Alolan Muk, Scrafty, and Bombirdier can counteract opposing Dark- and Ghost-types and use their presence as an opportunity to generate offensive momentum through pivoting, wearing down foes over time with Knock Off, and, in the case of the first two, status. Setup Pokemon that can boost Speed such as Dragon Dance Flygon and Tidy Up Cinccino, as well as those that increase their physical bulk like Iron Defense Registeel and Bulk Up Scrafty, can pose a problem to Choice Scarf Basculegion-M, as either Basculegion-M's average Speed stat or the lack of an additional power boost can let it down against these threats. Thus, Pokemon that can check these foes such as Orthworm, Chandelure, and Sylveon are appreciated, providing some solid defensive backbone for Basculegion-M to fall back upon. In return, these Pokemon heavily appreciate Basculegion-M's strong offensive presence.</p>"

  "Overqwil": {
    "overview": "<p>Overqwil is an amazing wallbreaker, entry hazard setter, and setup sweeper thanks to its remarkable Attack, good Speed, and decent utility movepool. On rain teams, Overqwil synergizes with the best rain sweeper in the tier, Basculegion-M, amazingly, since Overqwil handles the bulkier Grass-types that can take Basculegion-M's Wave Crash like Wo-Chien and Amoonguss and checks Ghost-types that try to revenge kill it as well such as Shadow Sneak Decidueye. In return, Basculegion-M takes care of Ground-types like Gligar and Swampert that can stump Overqwil. Overqwil's typing and access to Intimidate let it check many top threats like Incineroar, Munkidori, and the aforementioned Decidueye, and its access to Spikes lets it capitalize on these traits quite well. It isn't completely useless against walls like Vaporeon, Amoonguss, and Milotic either, since it can punish them with moves like Taunt and Toxic. However, even with Overqwil's access to Water-type coverage moves like Liquidation, Ground-types like Gligar, Swampert, and Flygon can still be problematic for it to handle, and they can often capitalize on it by setting up their hazards. Not only that, but thanks to their naturally high Defense, Steel-types like Duraludon and Copperajah also do a pretty good job at checking Overqwil, tanking a +2 Crunch and, in the latter's case, a Life Orb-boosted one as well. Additionally, common fast Pokemon like Flamigo, Paldean Tauros-W, Inteleon, and Kilowattrel easily prey on Overqwil's poor ability to handle repeated strong attacks, especially special ones. Overqwil's poor special bulk also leaves it vulnerable to powerful wallbreakers like Porygon-Z, Goodra, and Tornadus, which can easily break through it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swords Dance sets can run Agility instead of Scale Shot or another coverage move, which allows Overqwil to more quickly outspeed many Pokemon like Basculegion-M as well as Ludicolo under rain, Speed Booster Energy Scream Tail, and Choice Scarf users like Flygon and Infernape. However, its passivity compared to Scale Shot usually means it gets disregarded. More defensive Spikes sets can run Toxic to chip away at walls like Milotic, Incineroar, and Swampert, and in spreading poison, it can boost Barb Barrage. In a similar way, Toxic Spikes is usable, though common grounded Poison-types like Galarian Slowbro, Alolan Muk, and opposing Overqwil can render it useless. Air Balloon is useful, especially on offensive sets, since it lets Overqwil take advantage of Gligar, Torterra, and Choice-locked Flygon. In rain, Overqwil can capitalize on the one-time boost that Tera Stellar gives all of its moves to achieve similar rolls to Life Orb, namely, after a Swords Dance, OHKOing Toxicroak with Gunk Shot; Galarian Slowbro with Crunch; and, after Stealth Rock damage, Gligar with Liquidation. Because of this, going with Tera Stellar opens up Overqwil's item, which means it can run Clear Amulet to avoid Paldean Tauros-W's Intimidate, Brambleghast's Strength Sap, and Sticky Web.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Flygon, Gligar, Swampert, and Gastrodon can all switch in on Overqwil and threaten it with their super effective Ground-type attacks. On top of that, they can take advantage of it by setting entry hazards and, in Flygon's case, boosting their stats. However, especially under rain, the former three must be cautious, since rain-boosted Liquidation allows Overqwil to handle them quite well, and Overqwil can boost Liquidation even further with Tera Water and Life Orb. Gastrodon is Water-immune though, which helps it, and it does well versus more defensive Overqwil sets. However, due to it often being specially defensive, it can get 2HKOed by offensive Overqwil's Throat Chop.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Duraludon, Copperajah, and Klefki all block Overqwil's most powerful attack, Gunk Shot, forcing it rely on the weaker Throat Chop or Crunch to get through them. Additionally, Duraludon can boost its Defense as well as threaten to 2HKO offensive and defensive Overqwil sets alike, Copperajah can phaze Overqwil, and they all can capitalize on it by setting their hazards.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Even though Overqwil has Intimidate, neutral Fighting-type STAB attacks from Paldean Tauros-W, Infernape, and Toxicroak can overpower it due to Close Combat's high Base Power, and they can often set up on it. However, versus rain Overqwil sets, they must be cautious of being outsped and hit by powerful Life Orb-boosted attacks.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Special wallbreakers such as Porygon-Z, Inteleon, and Tornadus outspeed Overqwil and capitalize on its low Special Defense to overwhelm it. In rain, Overqwil can turn the tables on these threats though, outspeeding and OHKOing all of them.</p>",

Scale Shot, which is always paired with Loaded Dice, boosts Overqwil's Speed, letting it outpace fast Pokemon like Scyther, Kilowattrel, and Inteleon, and it acts as a powerful neutral coverage move against the tier. Liquidation allows Overqwil to break through Ground-types like Gligar and Flygon, while Aqua Jet lets it pick off faster threats like Flamigo, Cinccino, and Kilowattrel. Life Orb lets Overqwil OHKO Galarian Slowbro, Gligar, and Toxicroak with +2 Throat Chop or Crunch, Liquidation after Stealth Rock damage, and Gunk Shot, respectively. Clear Amulet lets Overqwil not worry about Incineroar's Intimidate, Galvantula's Sticky Web, and Brambleghast's Strength Sap though. Tera Dragon boosts Scale Shot and provides Overqwil with a solid defensive typing, letting it take attacks from Pokemon like Inteleon, Chandelure, and Rotom-H. On the other hand, Tera Water allows Overqwil to OHKO Paldean Tauros-F with a +1 Liquidation and means Overqwil can better take on Water- and Fire-types such as Milotic, Basculegion-M, and Incineroar. Tera Flying, however, allows Overqwil to handle Flygon, Toxicroak, and Breloom much more easily while providing it with setup opportunities against them.</p> <p>Leads such as Galvantula and Focus Sash Cinccino can easily aid Overqwil in sweeping, but ones like Eject Pack Flygon and Spikes setters like Brambleghast as well as Froslass can do that while also drawing in Grass- and Dark-types, respectively, gifting Overqwil setup opportunities. Overqwil easily handles Psychic- and Poison-types like Bronzong, Munkidori, Galarian Slowbro, and Amoonguss, which can pave the way for sweepers like Porygon-Z, Munkidori, Scyther, Diancie, and Infernape. Since Overqwil has trouble with breaking through Steel-types like Copperajah and Duraludon, partners that can beat them easily like Flygon, Paldean Tauros-W, Paldean Tauros-F, Breloom, and Chandelure are greatly appreciated. In a similar vein, Pokemon that weaken these Steel-types like Uxie, Diancie, Cinccino, Toxtricity, and Porygon-Z also work well alongside Overqwil. Ground-types like Gligar, Swampert, and Gastrodon could also be problematic, especially if Overqwil runs Scale Shot, so it should pair with teammates that can take advantage of them such as Paldean Tauros-W, Breloom, and Decidueye.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Throat Chop's ability to block sound moves like Sylveon's Hyper Voice as well as Scream Tail's and Toxtricity's Boombursts makes it preferred over Crunch, though Crunch has the chance to drop the foe's Defense and possibly make breaking through bulkier Pokemon easier. Liquidation hits Ground-types that try to switch into Overqwil's Gunk Shot like Flygon, Gligar, and Swampert, and it gets boosted by rain. Aqua Jet can be run over Swords Dance, though, so that Overqwil can have a way to pick off threats like Kilowattrel, Cinccino, and Infernape outside of rain. Life Orb is preferred, since it allows Overqwil to always OHKO Toxicroak with a +2 Gunk Shot, Galarian Slowbro with a +2 Throat Chop or Crunch, and Gligar with a +2 Liquidation under rain. However, Clear Amulet means Overqwil doesn't need to worry about Sticky Web, Intimidate, and Strength Sap from foes like Galvantula, Paldean Tauros-W, and Brambleghast, respectively. An Adamant nature allows Overqwil to achieve many rolls, including the aforementioned ones with Life Orb, but a Jolly nature lets it outspeed Unburden Hitmonlee, neutral-natured Kingdra as well as Overqwil, and +1 Cinccino under rain. Tera Water boosts Liquidation and Aqua Jet while giving Overqwil a decent defensive typing, but Tera Flying gifts it the ability to take Close Combat and Earthquake from foes such as Heracross and Flygon, giving it more chances to set up and fire off attacks.</p> <p>Rain setters like Tornadus, Klefki, and Uxie are necessary partners. Additionally, they each provide unique benefits; Tornadus offers Taunt as well as fast pivoting, Klefki brings Spikes as well as speed control in Thunder Wave, and Uxie has access to Knock Off to ensure its Stealth Rock affects all foes. Overqwil is a great rain sweeper that complements Basculegion-M perfectly: Overqwil handles the Water-resistant Pokemon that can take Basculegion-M's Wave Crash like Wo-Chien, Amoonguss, and Milotic; gets free entry on them with Basculegion-M's Flip Turn; checks Decidueye, which can revenge kill it with Shadow Sneak; and nails the Water-immune Pokemon that switch in on it like Vaporeon, Toxicroak, and Gastrodon. In return, Basculegion-M beats Ground-types that Overqwil can have issues with beating sometimes like Gligar and Palossand. Other rain sweepers like Ludicolo and Kingdra are also appreciated, since the former can reliably beat Water-resistant or -immune Pokemon like Milotic, Vaporeon, and Gastrodon more reliably, while the latter dents the same Pokemon quite easily and is extremely fast under rain. Even though Overqwil can beat Water-types, since the rest of its teammates often struggle with them, it's a good idea to have partners like Kilowattrel, Toxicroak, and Decidueye. Pokemon such as Flygon and Gligar as well as the aforementioned Klefki and Uxie can set up entry hazards, allowing Overqwil and its teammates to wallbreak more easily.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Barb Barrage complements more defensive EV spreads really well with how it easily spreads poison, while Gunk Shot works better on offensive EV spreads with the sheer power it provides. Throat Chop blocks sound moves like Sylveon's Hyper Voice as well as Toxtricity's and Scream Tail's Boombursts. Pain Split provides Overqwil with a manner of recovery, but Taunt means it can bother walls, stopping them from setting entry hazards, boosting their stats, or healing up. Haze can clear stat boosts from Pokemon like Bronzong, Sylveon, and Decidueye, though. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Overqwil pivot in and out without worry of hazards chipping it, but Leftovers gives it passive healing. Rocky Helmet could also be used, though Overqwil often switches into Pokemon that carry Knock Off like Incineroar, Alolan Muk, and Tsareena. A defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 40 Def / 216 Spe with a Jolly nature allows Overqwil to handle Incineroar's and Paldean Tauros-W's attacks while letting it outpace Basculegion-M and Chandelure, but investing into its Attack lets it double up as a wallbreaker. Tera Fairy lets Overqwil handle Flygon as well as Paldean Tauros-F, maintains its Dark resistance, and gives it a well-rounded defensive typing, while Tera Steel offers it multiple useful resistances, letting it take attacks like Cinccino's Tail Slap, Sylveon's Hyper Voice, and Kilowattrel's Hurricane. Tera Flying allows Overqwil to take on Ground- and Fighting-types like Flygon, Flygon, and Breloom.</p> <p>Overqwil's ability to check Munkidori, Galarian Slowbro, Alolan Muk, and Decidueye makes it a prime partner for Flamigo, Breloom, Decidueye, and Paldean Tauros-W, and on top of that, they all enjoy it setting up Spikes. However, if Overqwil wants to take full advantage of its Spikes, it requires Knock Off users, making Pokemon like Cinccino, Tornadus, Copperajah, and Gligar great teammates. To add on to Overqwil's Spikes, Stealth Rock setters like the latter two as well as Flygon and Bronzong work well alongside it. Overqwil easily falls to Fighting- and Ground-types such as Paldean Tauros-W, Toxicroak, and Flygon, so partners like Sylveon, Dragalge, Gligar, and Amoonguss work amazingly. Special walls like Porygon2, Gastrodon, Diancie, and Bronzong work well to check Pokemon like Chandelure, Inteleon, Tornadus, and Sylveon that try to take advantage of Overqwil's lower Special Defense.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Bellibolt carves out a niche for itself thanks to being a bulky Electric-type, which lets it checks dangerous Flying-types like Flamigo, Kilowattrel, and Scyther better than any other wall can. On top of that, it easily punishes the omnipresent U-turn as well as other contact moves like Cinccino's Tail Slap with both Static and its Rocky Helmet, and unlike other walls or tanks, Bellibolt doesn't give up momentum as easily because of its access to Volt Switch, letting it pivot out of bad matchups. Bellibolt's ability to pivot also means that it complements wallbreakers extremely well, giving them a myriad of opportunities to come in. However, this affinity for pivoting can also lead to Bellibolt's downfall, making it quite susceptible to entry hazards if it lacks Heavy-Duty Boots, and if Bellibolt runs that item, then it misses out on the extra chip damage granted by Rocky Helmet, allowing it to be attacked without as great of a concern as otherwise. Additionally, even though Bellibolt can use Toxic to chip away at Ground-types like Flygon and Gastrodon, they still force it out, which grants them a free turn to set hazards or start boosting. Another glaring issue with Bellibolt is its lack of resistances; although a physically defensive Flying-resistant wall with reliable recovery is rare, Bellibolt is often designated as the main physical wall for its team, needing to stomach repeated powerful neutral attacks such as Flamigo's Close Combat and Paldean Tauros-W's Wave Crash. This situation can be worsened even more so if these attackers carry a Choice Band, which they often do, and poison-immune setup sweepers like Toxtricity, Munkidori, and Toxicroak can use Bellibolt as setup fodder, since all it can do is use Volt Switch.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Acid Spray lets Bellibolt threaten decent chip damage on walls, and it can help partners as well thanks to Bellibolt's Volt Switch. However, it doesn't let Bellibolt rack up chip damage on Ground-types like Toxic does. Parabolic Charge or Discharge can be used, but Bellibolt prefers the pivoting that Volt Switch offers. Bellibolt can run other moves in its last moveslot to aid itself and its team like Reflect, Light Screen, and Thunder Wave, but this leaves it walled by Gligar. Tera Water boosts Muddy Water and Chilling Water, but more importantly, it removes Bellibolt's Ground weakness while giving it Water and Fire resistances, aiding Bellibolt versus Paldean Tauros-W and Infernape. However, these resistances aren't as useful as the ones provided by Tera Fairy or Flying. Tera Poison lets Bellibolt become immune to poison and resist Fighting-type attacks so that it can take on Alolan Muk as well as Fighting-types like Heracross and Flamigo. It maintains Bellibolt's Ground weakness, though. Leftovers can be used on Bellibolt for extra recovery, but the punishment of Rocky Helmet and the security of Heavy-Duty Boots are usually preferred.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-immune Pokemon</strong>: Flygon, Gastrodon, Gligar, and Volt Absorb Kilowattrel pose a threat to Bellibolt, as they block its Volt Switch from working, forcing it to switch out manually, give these foes a free turn, and allow them to boost their stats, set up entry hazards, or capitalize on Bellibolt's manual switch and pivot with U-turn, consequently allowing them to gain more momentum. However, Toxic is annoying for Flygon, Gastrodon, and Kilowattrel to deal with long-term, and Gligar is often overwhelmed by having to repeatedly take Muddy Water on top of hazard chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers and Setup Sweepers</strong>: Bellibolt's lack of resistances leaves it open to being overwhelmed by common wallbreakers, including physical attackers like Choice Band Paldean Tauros-W and Guts Heracross. Additionally, setup sweepers like Flygon, Substitute Raikou, Toxicroak, Munkidori, and Toxtricity can easily take advantage of Bellibolt, the first of which does that by threatening an Earthquake, whereas the other four simply aren't affected by Toxic and can comfortably take a Volt Switch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Bellibolt's last moveslot is very flexible due to Volt Switch already getting Bellibolt out of bad matchups such as those versus Toxtricity and Toxic punishing Ground-types that want to switch in on it like Gastrodon. This leaves its only significant adversary to be Gligar, which can't be poisoned due to Immunity. For this reason, Bellibolt often goes with Muddy Water to deal good damage to it and fish for accuracy drops against foes. On the other hand, when Soak is used against an incoming Ground-type, it allows Bellibolt to keep up momentum and immediately pivot with Volt Switch. Additionally, it allows Bellibolt to use Toxic against Steel- and Poison-types like Bronzong, Copperajah, and Amoonguss, helping its team out. Chilling Water offers a way to stave off bulky setup sweepers like Bulk Up users such as Scrafty and Poison Heal Breloom. The choice between Rocky Helmet and Heavy-Duty Boots usually comes down to if Bellibolt's team has entry hazard removal: if it does, Rocky Helmet is preferred due to how it lets Bellibolt punish U-turn, Flamigo, and other physical attackers with chip damage, but if there is no removal, Heavy-Duty Boots ensures Bellibolt stays healthy even in the face of hazards. Static complements Rocky Helmet's contact-punishing effects especially well, but its also just Bellibolt's best ability with how it threatens paralysis on all foes that use a contact move. Tera Fairy offers Bellibolt a Fighting resistance, which lets it more easily take a Close Combat from Flamigo, Heracross, and Paldean Tauros-F, and it offers a solid defensive typing that eases its matchup against Flygon and Scrafty. Tera Flying grants Bellibolt a Fighting resistance and a Ground immunity, meaning it can handle a Close Combat when needed from the aforementioned Fighting-types and avoid an Earthquake from Flygon. However, this leaves it open to Stealth Rock chip damage if it lacks Heavy-Duty Boots.</p> <p>One of Bellibolt's biggest issues is with Ground-types like Gastrodon, Flygon, and Gligar, as they block its Volt Switch. This leads to teammates like Decidueye, Alolan Ninetales, and Vaporeon pairing well alongside it. Additionally, thanks to Bellibolt constantly drawing in Ground-types and being able to accumulate chip damage with Toxic, Pokemon that can struggle with breaking past them such as Paldean Tauros-F, Toxicroak, and Diancie enjoy Bellibolt's presence. Entry hazard removers like Tsareena, Altaria, and Avalugg help out non-Heavy-Duty Boots Bellibolt sets, which can be easily overwhelmed by hazards. In a similar fashion, physical wallbreakers like Flamigo, Heracross, and Paldean Tauros-F can blow through Bellibolt with their strong neutral attacks, leading to secondary physical walls like Galarian Slowbro, Sylveon, and the aforementioned Altaria being welcomed as partners. Bellibolt's slow Volt Switch can facilitate the entry of many wallbreakers, and since it commonly draws in Decidueye, Amoonguss, and Alolan Muk, teammates such as Swords Dance Incineroar, Calm Mind or Choice Specs Chandelure, and Choice Band Flygon synergize well, capatilizing on these switch-ins. A complementary special wall like Wo-Chien, Gastrodon, or Alolan Muk pairs well with Bellibolt, as it can handle special wallbreakers like Basculegion-M, Toxtricity, and Chandelure for it, while Bellibolt can take on physical ones such as Cinccino, Flamigo, and Paldean Tauros-F.</p>"

Volt Absorb makes it a decent soft check to opposing Electric-types like Bellibolt, Raikou, and Totricity, and with Tera Steel it can full-on wall these foes; additionally, with how common stat-dropping moves and abilities are in NU, Kilowattrel's Competitive is quite useful, allowing it to capitalize on Brambleghast's Strength Sap and both Paldean Tauros-W's and Incineroar's Intimidate. On top of that, Kilowattrel being able to fire off a powerful Volt Switch or an unblockable U-turn helps it keep up pressure and momentum, and this aids Kilowattrel with wearing down checks like Diancie, Copperajah, and Bronzong. Kilowattrel's counters aren't that common; however, whenever Kilowattrel comes across one like Bellibolt, it struggles to deal with them and is forced to pivot, giving away free turns. Kilowattrel's low bulk also can be detrimental, as any neutral hit can easily 2HKO it, such as Jolly Barraskewda's Liquidation or Loaded Dice Flygon's Scale Shot. Even Pokemon Kilowattrel would normally take out can beat Kilowattrel one-on-one if they have access to priority moves, like Sucker Punch Toxicroak and Aqua Jet Basculegion-M, due to its disappointing bulk.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Kilowattrel can opt for a Choice Specs set to more easily wallbreak, but its weakness to Stealth Rock combined with how much it loves to pivot leads to it usually being worn down too quickly. Alternatively, Life Orb can by used on more offensive teamstyles that can both keep up enough pressure to prevent Stealth Rock from being set up and take advantage of the extra boost it gives Kilowattrel. Kilowattrel can run Weather Ball on rain and snow teams to hit Ground-types like Swampert, Gligar, and Flygon harder than Air Slash can, and notably, Weather Ball on snow teams lets Hurricane Kilowattrel easily dispatch Wind Rider Brambleghast. Thunder is also great for more power on rain teams, taking advantage of the weather. Tera Blast Fairy can even be used, as it lets Kilowattrel hit Flygon super effectively while blanking its Outrage and Scale Shot. On top of that, it lets Kilowattrel maintain its Fighting resistance and gives it a solid defensive typing. Tera Blast Ground is another option that lets Kilowattrel dispatch Diancie, Bellibolt, and Copperajah, since they can be annoying for Kilowattrel to get past at times. Tera Ghost can be used to avoid a powerful Close Combat from Choice Scarf Infernape, Heracross, and Paldean Tauros-W; however, the defensive utility that Tera Steel or Fairy gives Kilowattrel is usually preferred.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Bellibolt, Raikou, and Volt Absorb Kilowattrel all can switch into Kilowattrel, wall it repeatedly, and capitalize on their free turn by gaining momentum or, in Raikou's case, setting up.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Copperajah and Bronzong easily switch in to Kilowattrel's Air Slash and Hurricane. Since Kilowattrel has to pivot or switch out after they switch in, they can take advantage of their free turn by setting entry hazards or boosting their stats.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority Users</strong>: Kilowattrel's frailty leaves it open to being quite easily revenge killed by even neutral hit from Choice Scarf users like Munkidori's Sludge Wave and Inteleon's Hydro Pump. Additionally, priority users like Toxicroak and Mystic Water Basculegion-M can heavily threaten Kilowattrel, since the former can OHKO it at +2 with a Tera Dark-boosted Sucker Punch, and the latter can 2HKO it with Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Diancie can tank Kilowattrel's attacks quite well, and it can use it as an opportunity to set up Trick Room or set its entry hazards up. Rhyperior stonewalls Kilowattrel and forces it out, leaving Rhyperior free to use Swords Dance, Stealth Rock, or simply firing off a powerful attack on that turn.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Air Slash is preferred, as it is more accurate and can hit Wind Rider Brambleghast, but Hurricane can be used on teams that can handle it through other means. U-turn helps it keep up momentum in the face of Ground-types like Gligar, Flygon, and Swampert; however, Volt Switch lets Kilowattrel take advantage of Competitive's Special Attack boosts better. Roost allows Kilowattrel to continually pivot and gain value from its Competitive. Heavy-Duty Boots is preferred to let Kilowattrel come in safely and repeatedly during a match. Volt Absorb can be run to take advantage of Raikou, Bellibolt, and opposing Competitive Kilowattrel. On the other hand, Competitive allows Kilowattrel to capitalize on common Pokemon's abilities and moves like both Overqwil's and Incineroar's Intimidate as well as Brambleghast's Strength Sap. 160 HP EVs allows Kilowattrel to reliably revenge kill all Flamigo, surviving two Close Combats or Brave Birds from its Choice Scarf set so that it can retaliate with a Thunderbolt. Alternatively, an EV spread of 92 Def / 164 SpA / 252 Spe could be used to achieve the same goal at the cost of lower bulk but better offensive presence. Tera Steel allows Kilowattrel to resist many common attacks like Cinccino's Tail Slap, Inteleon's Ice Beam, and Munkidori's Sludge Wave and Psychic.</p> <p>Entry hazard setters like Klefki, Flygon, Copperajah, and Gligar are great partners for Kilowattrel, as their hazards can punish the opponent's switches, while Kilowattrel helps keep the hazards up by pressuring stray Defoggers like Cramorant, Scyther, and Decidueye. Similarly, Kilowattrel can work with hyper offense leads like Cinccino, Lycanroc, and Froslass. While Kilowattrel can pressure Defoggers, it fails to stop spinners like Brambleghast, Avalugg, and Tsareena, so pairing it with a Ghost-type like Basculegion-M, Decidueye, or Chandelure is a good idea. Kilowattrel can pressure Water-types like Vaporeon, Milotic, and Basculegion-M quite easily, meaning Pokemon that struggle dealing with them or can force them in like Flygon, Incineroar, and Inteleon have good synergy. Special walls like Diancie, Copperajah, and Bronzong can be difficult to take down alone, so physical wallbreakers like Breloom, Flygon, and Incineroar are great to deal with them, and Kilowattrel can form VoltTurn cores with many of them. Electric- and Rock-types like Bellibolt, Volt Absorb Kilowattrel, and Diancie are difficult for Kilowattrel to KO; because of this, Ground-type teammates like Flygon, Rhyperior, and Gligar make for good partners.</p>"

  "Grafaiai": {
    "overview": "<p>Grafaiai's naturally high Speed and access to multiple useful abilities let it solidify its spot as both a powerful Swords Dance Terrain sweeper and utility-offering offensive pivot. On Terrain teams, Grafaiai finds ample opportunities to set up thanks to Grassy Seed boosting its Defense, Grassy Terrain weakening Earthquake, and its high Speed, which allows it to invest heavily into its HP. On the other hand, pivot sets excel at disruption thanks to Grafaiai's Prankster Encore, messing with setup sweepers like Flygon and walls like Bronzong alike, and Poison Touch, spreading status onto many defensive staples like Gastrodon, Incineroar, and Diancie. However, Dark-type walls and setup sweepers such as Alolan Muk, Incineroar, and Tera Dark Drednaw can completely ignore Grafaiai's Prankster Encore. Not only that, but Poison Touch pivot sets struggle to get past poison-immune Pokemon like Copperajah, Overqwil, and Immunity Gligar. Grafaiai also struggles to muscle past Ground-types like Swampert, needing to use Acrobatics if it wishes to deal decent damage, but in doing so, it is either vulnerable to being walled by Bronzong or other Steel-types, depending on the coverage move it drops. Additionally, it's quite frail, which is exacerbated on pivot sets, since it can't safely switch into most attackers that it would like to check otherwise, such as Chandelure and Decidueye.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>On Terrain sweeper sets, Grafaiai can run Tera Blast Grass to clear sturdy Ground- and Water-types for teammates like Diancie, Hitmonlee, and Oricorio-F. However, Tera Blast being a wasted moveslot if Grafaiai doesn't Terastallize makes it unappealing overall, and it requires Grafaiai to drop other important coverage. On Prankster pivot sets, Toxic can be run to cripple walls and setup sweepers, though Grafaiai can simply run Poison Touch and spread poison with its attacks, not needing need to waste a moveslot. Taunt could also be used to stop those same Pokemon from healing or setting up, but Encore and Switcheroo often find more use through the course of a game. Additionally, Copycat is usable due to it letting Grafaiai attack frail but fast foes with priority Gunk Shot and Knock Off, but it's difficult to fit with Encore, Parting Shot, and U-turn being more generally useful. Poison Jab is a usable alternative over Gunk Shot due to its reliable accuracy, but its lower power and contact effect make it undesirable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Swampert, Gastrodon, Gligar, and Flygon all resist Grafaiai's Gunk Shot and can use it to set up entry hazards. Additionally, Flygon can potentially use it as setup fodder, though it needs to be cautious of Encore and Choice Scarf Switcheroo. Grafaiai's best tool to whittle down walls is poison, which works just fine against Swampert and non-Covert Cloak Sticky Hold Gastrodon, but Gligar's Immunity completely renders that moot. However, it's vulnerable to Knock Off and Switcheroo, removing its Eviolite, as well as constant chip damage from Grafaiai's U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Bronzong, Duraludon, and Copperajah all are immune to Grafaiai's Gunk Shot as well as any attempt to poison them, and they can take advantage of it to set up hazards. On top of that, the first can possibly survive Swords Dance-boosted Knock Off, retaliating with Earthquake or Psychic Noise, whereas Duraludon takes on Swords Dance sets with ease due to Low Kick being weakened by its Light Metal and its ability to fire off a powerful Draco Meteor. Copperajah can use Whirlwind to phaze Grafaiai. However, Copperajah's Whirlwind is often futile because by the time the move goes off, Grafaiai has either switched out, dealt great damage, or completely KOed Copperajah.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Toxicroak, Amoonguss, Galarian Slowbro, and Alolan Muk are quite problematic for Grafaiai, since they take its Gunk Shot quite well and are immune to poison. However, Acrobatics hits the former two super effectively, whereas Knock Off nails Galarian Slowbro. Additionally, while Alolan Muk resists Knock Off in addition to Gunk Shot and is immune to Prankster Encore, its low Defense means it can be overwhelmed by Swords Dance Grafaiai sets, and it despises being Choice-locked by Grafaiai's Switcheroo.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Knock Off targets Ghost-types that Gunk Shot fails to hurt like Chandelure and Basculegion-M while hitting both Galarian Slowbro and Bronzong super effectively. Low Kick allows Grafaiai to handle Steel-types like Duraludon and Copperajah. Acrobatics can be run over either Knock Off or Low Kick for a strong and risk-free coverage move that hits Toxicroak super effectively as well as Ground-types such as Swampert and Flygon more powerfully than any other coverage move at Grafaiai's disposal. The first EV spread ensures Grafaiai outspeeds +1 Speed Cinccino, Scream Tail, Flygon, and Munkidori. Alternatively, the second EV spread lets Grafaiai outpace Agility-boosted Flamigo, Unburden Hitmonlee, and Swift Swim Basculegion-M as well as Overqwil. Tera Dark boosts the power of Knock Off and grants Grafaiai an immunity to Psychic-type attacks from Munkidori, Bronzong, and Uxie, giving it a free turn to attack or set up versus them. Similarly, Tera Flying powers up Acrobatics while making Grafaiai immune to Ground-type attacks from Flygon and Gastrodon so that it can set up against or simply attack them.</p> <p>In order to activate Grafaiai's Grassy Seed, it requires Thwackey to set up Grassy Terrain, which also helps Grafaiai with setting up by weakening Earthquake and providing passive recovery. Additionally, Grafaiai benefits heavily from Thwackey, since Thwackey can beat pesky defensive Water- and Ground-types that Grafaiai can have trouble getting past like Vaporeon, Swampert, and Gligar. Due to Ground-types being difficult for Grafaiai to break through by itself, it appreciates teammates that can weaken them, such as Cinccino, Arcanine, and Paldean Tauros-F. What's more, the latter two as well as Oricorio-F and Chandelure can also handle Steel-types like Bronzong and Copperajah for Grafaiai. Torterra is an exceptional teammate for Grafaiai, since it beats bulky Poison-, Steel-, and Ground-types that Grafaiai struggles with KOing, such as Overqwil, Klefki, and Swampert. In return, Grafaiai deals with Grass-types like Decidueye as well as Tsareena, and it deals great damage to, if not outright KOes, the Ground-immune Steel-types—Bronzong and Orthworm—with Swords Dance-boosted Knock Off and Low Kick, respectively. Diancie and Oricorio-P can work alongside Grafaiai to overwhelm shared Steel-type checks like Bronzong and Copperajah. On top of that, they complement it very well; both of them, especially Oricorio-P due to Taunt, are great at breaking through bulkier Pokemon like Gastrodon and Amoonguss as well as more defensive teams, whereas Grafaiai excels at cleaning and sweeping offensive structures. Additionally, Diancie provides Stealth Rock.</p>"

Parting Shot and Encore are best used alongside Prankster so that Grafaiai can disrupt both setup sweepers and walls alike, though Encore can be run on Poison Touch sets that plan to capitalize on and punish walls as well as slower setup sweepers by poisoning them. Poison Touch complements U-turn quite well, spreading poison as Grafaiai switches out. Switcheroo is run solely with Choice Scarf, letting Grafaiai cripple walls and setup sweepers by locking them into status moves.

When these poison-immune Pokemon are cleared, Grafaiai can easily spread poison to walls like Diancie, Avalugg, Gastrodon, and Milotic. This can open up powerful Pokemon that are usually held back by these defensive staples like Incineroar, Flygon, Kilowattrel, and Inteleon. Walls like Vaporeon, Incineroar, and Bronzong enjoy Grafaiai's access to Prankster Encore, since it can lock setup sweepers such as Toxicroak and Trick Room Diancie as well as Substitute Basculegion-M into status moves, mitigating how effectively they can take advantage of these walls. Fast Psychic- and Ground-types like Munkidori, Booster Energy Scream Tail, and Choice Scarf Flygon easily force out Grafaiai, so partners like Bronzong, Copperajah, and Gligar are appreciated.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Brambleghast is a premier Rapid Spin user in NU thanks to its high-Base Power STAB moves, typing that lets it beat common entry hazard setters like Swampert, Diancie, and Bronzong one-on-one, and solid Speed. Brambleghast's useful Wind Rider ability lets it block a possible Hurricane from Kilowattrel and Tornadus. Additionally, Brambleghast is a great wallbreaker, since not many Pokemon can take both of its STAB attacks. Choice Band makes Brambleghast into a dangerous threat, as defensive foes like Amoonguss and Tsareena get 2HKOed by Poltergeist on the switch. However, Brambleghast's poor bulk makes it poor at checking wallbreakers like Heracross, Flygon, and Paldean Tauros-W, as they can threaten it with a 2HKO from their coverage or Choice Band-boosted attacks, forcing Brambleghast to constantly use Strength Sap. Additionally, Brambleghast's typing leaves it weak to common Dark- and Fire-types like Alolan Muk, Incineroar, and Chandelure. While Brambleghast does have good Speed, it's still outsped and revenge killed by foes like Inteleon and Munkidori or by priority attacks like Sucker Punch Toxicroak and Shadow Sneak Alolan Muk.</p>",

Leech Seed can be run on defensive sets, letting Brambleghast make progress on foes like Incineroar, Registeel, and Sylveon. Night Shade lets Brambleghast do consistent damage against Dark-types like Bombirdier and Alolan Muk. A set with Spikes / Poltergeist / Rapid Spin / Curse and a Focus Sash turns Brambleghast into a solid lead hazard setter, as it can set up Spikes and punish foes like Incineroar and Alolan Muk with Curse damage.

Not running an item allows Flamigo to use the drawback-free Acrobatics over the health-wasting Brave Bird, whereas Sitrus Berry eases setup for Flamigo on hyper offense builds while allowing it to still use Acrobatics later. The second EV spread is for Flamigo on hyper offensive teams, as it maximizes its Attack and, after an Agility, allows it to outspeed Speed Booster Energy Scream Tail. Tera Steel lets Flamigo take a hit from Munkidori, Choice Scarf Flamigo, and Sylveon in a pinch so that it can retaliate with an Acrobatics or, in Sylveon's case, capitalize on them better. Alternatively, Tera Electric and Ground give Flamigo an immunity to Klefki's Thunder Wave. However, for a paralysis immunity, Tera Electric is better, as Bellibolt's Static can circumvent Tera Ground. Additionally, Tera Electric lets Flamigo use Kilowattrel as setup fodder and allows it to take a Brave Bird from opposing Flamigo in a pinch. Tera Ground offers a full immunity to Electric-type moves from Kilowattrel and Bellibolt, though, meaning Flamigo won't be getting constantly chipped like it would be with Tera Electric.</p> <p>Flamigo's biggest enemy is Bellibolt, and because of this, it appreciates any way to wear it down, whether that be through entry hazard stacking with aid from setters such as Spikes Klefki, Diancie, and Gastrodon as well as Stealth Rock Flygon, in tandem with Knock Off users like Incineroar and Cinccino, or by checking it with Ground-types like Gligar, Flygon, and Swampert. Pivots like Munkidori, Cinccino, Basculegion-M, and Flygon pair well with Roost Flamigo, bringing in Steel- and Grass-type foes like Copperajah, Wo-Chien, and Amoonguss, which it can take advantage of. Flamigo's middling Speed leads it to rely on partners like Rhyperior, Bronzong, and Bellibolt on balance teams so that it can better position itself around common offensive threats like Kilowattrel, Munkidori, and Tornadus. Double Dance Flamigo sets love dual screens Klefki and Sableye as well as Aurora Veil Alolan Ninetales, since they help lessen the burden on Flamigo's bulk to survive turns as it sets up. On these dual screens teams, partners often are fellow setup sweepers such as Flygon, Toxtricity, Drednaw, Scream Tail, and Cinccino. Flygon and Toxtricity can capitalize on Bellibolt and Galarian Slowbro, which Flamigo often falls against; Flygon, Drednaw, and Cinccino can work in tandem with Flamigo to chip away at walls like Gligar, Swampert, and Diancie; and Toxtricity and Scream Tail can nail physically defensive Pokemon such as Sylveon and Bellibolt for Flamigo while it takes care of special walls like Gastrodon and Copperajah for them.</p>"

Calm Mind Scream Tail is a terrifying wallbreaker; it becomes very hard to KO after a few boosts, and thanks to Booster Energy giving it a free Speed boost, Scream Tail can outspeed faster threats like Kilowattrel and Choice Scarf Munkidori. Additionally, Scream Tail's great bulk and typing gives it the ability to handle powerful wallbreakers such as Flygon, Heracross, Kilowattrel, and Scyther. Its access to Stealth Rock makes it a solid entry hazard lead that can disrupt foes with Encore or Thunder Wave. However, Scream Tail's poor Special Attack makes it easy for special walls like Alolan Muk, Gastrodon, and Diancie to tank its attacks even after a Calm Mind boost. Scream Tail can also be forced to heal due to repeatedly switching in against moves that it resists from wallbreakers like Heracross, Infernape, and Scrafty.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Scream Tail can use Disable on both lead and Wish sets, letting it disrupt many setup sweepers and entry hazard leads like Incineroar, Swampert, and Gastrodon. Perish Song lets it pressure walls and setup sweepers like Gastrodon, Scyther, and Porygon-Z that would take advantage of lead Scream Tail while it helps its teammates. Roar can be used on Wish sets to phaze setup sweepers like Flygon, Paldean Tauros-F, and Porygon-Z. Psyshock lets Scream Tail better handle special walls like Porygon2 and Gastrodon, while Psychic can be used for its raw power. Tera Dragon can be used to handle Water- and Fire-type attacks from Inteleon, Basculegion-M, and Chandelure. Scream Tail can run a Bulk Up set with Bulk Up / Psychic Fangs / Play Rough / Drain Punch, enabling it to gain the upper hand against its checks like Porygon2 and Gastrodon, but its poor Attack makes the set very niche.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Copperajah, Bronzong, and Registeel can destroy Scream Tail with their Steel-type attacks. Additionally, Copperajah can phaze it, the latter two can set up, and all three of them can set up entry hazards. Klefki can also threaten Scream Tail with Thunder Wave and set up Spikes. However, none of them enjoy switching directly in against its Fire Blast or Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Scream Tail's poor Special Attack makes it easy for special tanks like Alolan Muk, Porygon2, Diancie, and Gastrodon to tank its boosted attacks and threaten it with status or hit it back with their attacks.

Fire Blast allows Scream Tail to hit Steel-types like Copperajah, Bronzong, and Registeel that would handle its Boomburst. Alternatively, Flamethrower can be used for its better accuracy, but a +1 boost misses out the ability to 2HKO Bronzong. Psychic Noise lets Scream Tail prevent healing attempts from Vaporeon and Gastrodon while hitting Chandelure neutrally, which it would be walled by otherwise, but Dazzling Gleam allows it to hit Dark-types like Scrafty. 216 Speed EVs allow Scream Tail to outpace Choice Scarf users like Flygon and Munkidori after activating its Booster Energy. Tera Normal boosts Boomburst, letting it 2HKO foes like Kilowattrel and Tornadus, and it gives Scream Tail a free turn to set up against or attack Ghost-types like Chandelure and Decidueye, blanking their Shadow Ball, Spirit Shackle, and Shadow Sneak. Tera Fire boosts Fire Blast and Flamethrower, allowing Scream Tail to better handle Steel-types such as Registeel, and the Fairy resistance it gives can help in Calm Mind wars against Sylveon and Florges.</p> <p>Scream Tail synergizes greatly with wallbreakers and setup sweepers like Flygon, Paldean Tauros-F, Swords Dance Scyther, and Bulk Up Tornadus, as they can handle the special walls like Gastrodon, Milotic, and Porygon2 that stump Scream Tail.

Scream Tail appreciates entry hazard-setting leads like Eject Pack Flygon, Focus Sash Infernape, and Spikes Brambleghast, which let it pressure special tanks like Alolan Muk and Porygon2. Alolan Ninetales can set up Aurora Veil for Scream Tail, giving it more chances to boost and making Scream Tail more difficult to revenge kill.

Leftovers provides Scream Tail a bit more recovery, whereas Heavy-Duty Boots allows it not to be worn down by hazards. The first EV spread allows Scream Tail to outpace Flygon, the Paldean Tauros formes, and Staraptor while still being bulky, but fully investing in Speed allows it to outspeed Pokemon like Infernape, Alolan Ninetales, and Scyther. Tera Steel gives Scream Tail a useful defensive typing, letting it better handle foes like Sylveon, Toxtricity, Munkidori, and Porygon-Z. Tera Poison maintains the useful Fighting-type resistance while giving it a useful immunity to any poison attempts from Galarian Slowbro, Alolan Muk, and Amoonguss.

Its typing allows it to hit much of the tier for at least neutral damage with its STAB moves, with Sludge Bomb and Sludge Wave targeting Fairy- and Grass-types like Sylveon and Tsareena, while Psychic and Psyshock target Poison- and Fighting-types like Vileplume and Breloom. Munkidori's Nasty Plot set loves to capitalize on the switches that it forces against these Pokemon, and with its excellent Speed tier, it can outspeed common threats like Mienshao and Flygon. Munkidori's U-turn is also incredibly potent, as it easily spreads poison with Toxic Chain to chip away at walls like Diancie, Incineroar, and Umbreon so that it can KO them more easily later. It also runs moves like Focus Blast and Tera Blast Ground to hit its poison-immune checks such as Steel-types like Copperajah and Registeel and Poison-types like Alolan Muk. Trick can also limit opposing setup sweepers like Cresselia and Iron Thorns or cripple specially defensive walls upon switch-in like Bronzong and Alolan Muk. However, Munkidori is vulnerable to opposing Dark-types like Incineroar and Brute Bonnet and can be limited by Steel-types if not carrying sufficient coverage.

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fake Out is a niche option that can be used on Toxic Chain sets with the intention of giving Munkidori as many opportunities as possible to poison the opposing Pokemon. Parting Shot can also be used as an alternative to U-turn, avoiding contact and lowering the foe's stats, but Munkidori's main draw is its ability to poison Pokemon without having to waste a turn using a status move like Toxic. Psychic Noise can also be used on pivot sets while attempting to chip down bulkier foes, preventing them from recovering while a more effective attacker switches in. Shadow Ball can be run alongside Tera Ghost to hit Bronzong, which otherwise walls Munkidori, and it can provide an immunity to priority moves like Mienshao's Fake Out and Breloom's Mach Punch. Grass Knot is a niche option alongside Tera Grass to target potential threats like specially defensive Swampert and Gastrodon but leaves Munkidori helpless against Steel-types. Tera Fairy can also be used as an alternative to Tera Fighting that maintains Munkidori's resistance to Fighting-type attacks at the cost of the potential boost to Focus Blast.
