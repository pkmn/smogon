  "Vileplume": {
    "overview": "<p>Vileplume is one of the premier physical walls in the NU tier. Its Grass / Poison typing allows it to resist common Fighting- and Water-type attacks from Mienshao, Breloom, and Basculegion. Vileplume excels in punishing foes for making contact, dealing damage with Rocky Helmet and spreading status with Effect Spore. Despite being a wall, Vileplume isn't completely passive; with Giga Drain and Sludge Bomb, it can threaten serious damage on Vaporeon, Sylveon, and Avalugg, and Vileplume can potentially poison foes with the latter. Leech Seed and Strength Sap further Vileplume's longevity and weaken checks like Registeel and Alolan Muk. Special wallbreakers like Dragalge, Chandelure, and Porygon-Z can easily overwhelm Vileplume. Defensive Steel-types such as Copperajah and Klefki that resist both of Vileplume's STAB moves wall it well but risk being worn down by Leech Seed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Growth can be used over Leech Seed, allowing Vileplume to take advantage of bulkier Pokemon that can't threaten it like Alolan Muk and Brute Bonnet, but losing out on Leech Seed means Vileplume can't take on or chip away at Steel-type checks like Registeel and Klefki. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to ignore entry hazards and to decrease passivity by not needing to heal as often, but the sheer punishment of Rocky Helmet or healing of Leftovers is usually preferred. This value is often not seen long-term, as Vileplume is often tasked with taking Knock Off repeatedly.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Special wallbreakers like Chandelure, Munkidori, and Porygon-Z can all easily beat Vileplume down with their powerful super effective and even neutral attacks.</p> <p><strong>Tentacruel</strong>: Tentacruel's Liquid Ooze poses a unique threat to Vileplume, which cannot meaningfully damage it with Giga Drain or Sludge Bomb. Liquid Ooze prevents Leech Seed from healing Vileplume and threatens to OHKO Vileplume if it attempts to use Strength Sap.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Giga Drain hits offensive Ground-types like Swampert and Flygon that resist Sludge Bomb. However, Stun Spore can be run instead for extra utility, allowing Vileplume to spread paralysis for teammates. Leech Seed allows Vileplume to make progress against special walls like Registeel, Cresselia, and Dragalge. Effect Spore and Rocky Helmet can punish U-turn pivots like Mienshao and Flygon and other contact attackers like Paldean Tauros-W and Basculegion. Leftovers can be used to keep it from being too passive and having to heal up as often. Tera Water is used to resist Fire- and Ice-type attacks in a pinch from Chandelure, Mienshao, and Inteleon; on the other hand, Tera Fairy removes its weaknesses, notably to Fire and Psychic, while improving its matchup versus Fighting-types like Mienshao, Gallade, and Infernape.</p> <p>Defensive Steel-types like Copperajah and Registeel wall Vileplume's STAB moves, so Fighting-types like Mienshao and Gallade and Fire-types like Chandelure and Infernape pair well with it.

Options like Registeel, Incineroar, and Milotic can resist these wallbreakers' strong special attacks. Psychic-types like Assault Vest Gallade and Cresselia and Dark-types like Brute Bonnet and Alolan Muk also support Vileplume, helping it against Psychic-type threats like Munkidori, Indeedee-F, and Gallade. Powerful Fire-types like Infernape, Incineroar, Chandelure, and Hisuian Typhlosion also pose a threat to Vileplume, so teammates like Vaporeon, Swampert, and Diancie help it handle these threats.</p>"

Tentacruel's typing lets it take on many threats like Paldean Tauros-F, Inteleon, and Sylveon. Tentacruel also has a niche in thwarting HP-draining attacks like Uxie's Draining Kiss and Brambleghast's Strength Sap thanks to Liquid Ooze. Although Tentacruel boasts a lot of utility options, it's quite passive and can often get overwhelmed attempting to make use of every support move in a battle. Because of this, Tentacruel is best used as a bulky pivot to allow powerful wallbreakers like Porygon-Z and Flamigo to hit the field safely. Despite its great typing and Special Defense, Tentacruel's lack of recovery and poor physical bulk often leave it getting overwhelmed quite easily.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tentacruel can use Acid Spray as a way to combat bulky setup sweepers such as Scrafty and Vaporeon while still retaining a sliver of an offensive presence. Using its defensive typing and Speed boost from Rapid Spin, Tentacruel can use Swords Dance with powerful physical moves like Gunk Shot and Knock Off, even ignoring Intimidate via Clear Body. Tentacruel's other ability, Rain Dish, can let it take advantage of either the opponent's rain or find itself on a rain team.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Although Tentacruel is a Water-type, with only a weak Flip Turn in its arsenal, many Ground-types like Flygon and Swampert can safely pivot into Tentacruel and threaten to OHKO it with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Without Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots, Tentacruel has no method of recovery and will fail as a long-term pivot and entry hazard remover, making it quite reliant on its item. Even Pokemon it's meant to check like Infernape and opposing Tentacruel can dissuade Tentacruel from coming in for fear of Knock Off.</p>",

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Tentacruel may want to delay using Rapid Spin if it has been hit with Leech Seed, as this will deal constant damage to the foe. Knock Off is Tentacruel's primary way of not being entirely passive, removing Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from Pokemon that can switch into it like Swampert and Klefki. Haze disrupts bulky setup sweepers. Toxic achieves a similar goal, but Tentacruel must be wary of Tera Poison and Steel commonly seen on bulky setup sweepers like Calm Mind Sylveon and Scrafty. Toxic is also useless against the many bulky Steel-types like Bronzong and Registeel using IronPress, Poison-types like Overqwil and Toxicroak, and Substitute users like Uxie and Paldean Tauros-W. Toxic Spikes make pivots into Tentacruel riskier, especially if it has previously removed Heavy-Duty Boots; however, the metagame is teeming with airborne foes, grounded Poison-types, and Heavy-Duty Boots users. Lastly, Sludge Bomb gives Tentacruel a means of dealing out any meaningful damage, letting it 2HKO Grass-types like Tsareena and Breloom that can otherwise take advantage of Tentacruel and threaten frailer offensive threats like Paldean Tauros-W and Porygon-Z. The given EV spread lets it outpace base 85 Speed Pokemon like Heracross and Overqwil, although this can be lowered to only outspeed foes with base 80 Speed and below like Chandelure, Basculegion-M, and Milotic or raised to outspeed even the likes of Porygon-Z and Hisuian Typhlosion.</p> <p>Tentacruel's ability to pivot in and out of play easily facilitates frail wallbreakers like Porygon-Z, Flamigo, and Breloom, which can take advantage of bulky Water-types that often switch in on Tentacruel like Vaporeon, Milotic, and Gastrodon. Bronzong and Orthworm pair well with Tentacruel, serving as Ground-immune and Psychic-resistant Pokemon that can set up entry hazards for Tentacruel. They also appreciate Tentacruel's Fire resistance, allowing it to check threats like Chandelure and Infernape. Offensive pivots such as Flygon and Kilowattrel are two Ground-immune Pokemon that also offer an Electric immunity for Tentacruel as well. Defensive pivots like Gligar and Incineroar form nice VoltTurn cores with Tentacruel, and their respective immense physical bulk and Intimidate compensate for Tentacruel's poor Defense. Wish users like Sylveon and Florges can keep Tentacruel healthy as it sponges Poison-type attacks for them and bothers Amoonguss.</p>"

  "Slowbro-Galar": {
    "overview": "<p>Galarian Slowbro establishes itself as a solid physical wall in NU thanks to Regenerator, letting it come in and check threats repeatedly without having to waste a turn healing. Its typing allows Galarian Slowbro to be immune to poison, allowing it to avoid Toxic from Overqwil, while letting it consistently check Fighting-types like Mienshao, Toxicroak, and Breloom. Galarian Slowbro's deep utility movepool lets it support its team by whittling away at walls like Incineroar and Diancie with Toxic or slowing down threats like Munkidori and Inteleon with Thunder Wave. It also has access to Calm Mind, which allows Galarian Slowbro to take advantage of common defensive walls like Registeel and Vileplume by making it harder to KO and switch into as well. On the other hand, it can choose to be more immediately threatening with Assault Vest, as it allows Galarian Slowbro to make use of its vast coverage, and it helps act as a blanket check to special wallbreakers such as Munkidori, Dragalge, and Porygon-Z. However, Galarian Slowbro's typing makes it weak to common Ground- and Dark-types like Flygon, Incineroar, and Alolan Muk. Galarian Slowbro is also susceptible to being KOed by repeated special hits from wallbreakers like Inteleon, Toxtricity, and Porygon-Z due to its below-average Special Defense. While Galarian Slowbro checks Fighting-types like Toxicroak and Breloom quite well, other physical wallbreakers with neutral STAB moves like Heracross, Paldean Tauros-W, and Basculegion-M can easily overpower it or force it to Terastallize.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Iron Defense + Body Press can be used to turn the tables against Dark-types like Incineroar, Scrafty, and Alolan Muk, but Galarian Slowbro is still easily forced out by special wallbreakers. Nasty Plot can be used over Calm Mind, turning it into a terrifying sweeper, but unlike Calm Mind, it forces Galarian Slowbro to switch out when it's up against special wallbreakers like Dragalge and Munkidori. Trick Room can be used on Galarian Slowbro to take advantage of its low Speed and decent Special Attack, but without a boost, it struggles to pick up KOs. Colbur Berry lets Galarian Slowbro tank any Dark-type attacks such as Incineroar's and Alolan Muk's Knock Off and Toxicroak's Dark Pulse so that it can respond with an attack afterwards, but the utility of its other items usually outweighs the benefit of using it. Eject Button allows Galarian Slowbro to become a one-time pivot, letting it safely bring in setup sweepers like Swords Dance Incineroar, Dragon Dance Flygon, and Nasty Plot Toxicroak for free. Galarian Slowbro could also opt to go itemless, as it can then wall Brambleghast and reduce Knock Off damage from Incineroar and Mienshao.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Incineroar and Bombirdier can put a lot of pressure on Galarian Slowbro with their STAB attacks, but they have to be worried about getting poisoned by Sludge Bomb when switching in. Alolan Muk is especially noteworthy for being able to switch into its STAB attacks easily without worry of being poisoned, and it can respond with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Flygon, Swampert, and Gligar can tank its Poison-type attacks and threaten Galarian Slowbro with their STAB Earthquake. However, the former two have to fear getting poisoned, and they all have to be cautious about switching into Ice Beam, Grass Knot, or Surf.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Chandelure, Hisuian Typhlosion, Decidueye, and Brambleghast can easily destroy Galarian Slowbro with their STAB attacks. However, the former two have to fear about switching into Surf, while the latter two have to worry about Sludge Bomb damage and switching into a Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Special wallbreakers like Choice Specs Meloetta and Inteleon can easily break through Galarian Slowbro and force it to switch out. Calm Mind users like Uxie and Chandelure can put a lot of pressure on Galarian Slowbro too, but they have to be mindful of getting poisoned and switching into Psyshock and Surf, respectively.</p>",

However, Psyshock can be used over Sludge Bomb, allowing Galarian Slowbro to deal with Poison-types and special walls like Toxicroak, Tentacruel, and Diancie more easily, and it also helps overwhelm opposing special setup Pokemon like Sylveon and Oricorio-G. Flamethrower allows Galarian Slowbro to hit Steel-types switching in on Sludge Bomb like Copperajah, Registeel, Bronzong, and Tera Steel Sylveon. Alternatively, Surf allows it to target Incineroar trying to blank an incoming Psyshock. Rocky Helmet punishes physical wallbreakers like Mienshao, Cinccino, and Breloom; it also pairs well with Regenerator, as it allows Galarian Slowbro to consistently switch in to rack up chip damage. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Galarian Slowbro avoid damage from entry hazards, meaning its Regenerator can't be negated, while Leftovers gives it passive recovery, minimizing the need to heal off damage with Slack Off. The EV spread lets Galarian Slowbro outpace Bronzong. Tera Water lets it handle Water-, Ground-, and Fire-types like Basculegion, Flygon, and Incineroar; however, Galarian Slowbro loses its matchup against Grass-types like Tsareena and Breloom.

Flamethrower allows it to hit Steel-types like Copperajah, Bronzong, and Klefki, while Earthquake targets Alolan Muk and Tentacruel with a trade-off of not hitting Bronzong and Orthworm. Ice Beam lets Galarian Slowbro hit Ground-types like Flygon and Gligar, while Surf targets Fire- and Rock-types like Chandelure, Talonflame, and Diancie. Grass Knot can be used as well to hit Water- and Ground-types like Swampert, Milotic, and Gastrodon more effectively. The given Speed EVs outpace Bronzong, though a spread of 180 HP / 252 SpA / 76 Spe could be run to outspeed Gastrodon if it runs Grass Knot. An alternative bulkier EV spread of 252 HP / 128 Def / 4 SpA / 96 SpD / 28 Spe can be run with a Bold nature to live a +2 Wave Crash from Paldean Tauros-W and ensure that Shell Side Arm is a special attack, but Galarian Slowbro can fail to put its coverage to great use at times if it doesn't invest heavily in its offenses.

On top of this, Alolan Muk isn't useless against bulkier Pokemon either; thanks to its access to Knock Off in combination with Poison Touch, it can slowly beat Sylveon, Talonflame, and Gastrodon. Poison Touch along with Poison Jab allow it to spread poison nearly uninhibited, letting it chip away at opposing teams quite easily. However, Alolan Muk is quite frail physically, often being forced out by pivots like Mienshao and Flygon and losing momentum. It is also weak to fairly common Ground-types like Flygon and Swampert, which then get free turns to set entry hazards or boost their offensive stats.

Because of how easily Alolan Muk can remove items, hazard setters like Klefki, Swampert, and Quagsire have great synergy with it. On the flip side, with how many times Alolan Muk is forced to switch into an attack, hazards become an issue for it, jeopardizing its ability to take on Chandelure and Munkidori.

As a pivot, Scyther leverages its great Speed, which lets it outpace top threats in NU like Overqwil, Paldean Tauros-W, and Toxicroak. This quality is further enhanced by the tier's general lack of good entry hazard removal, meaning the opponent's attempts to switch around Scyther and its teammates are punished even more. Its typing is also quite helpful, since it allows Scyther to switch in on many common Pokemon like Breloom, Decidueye, and Flygon. However, Swords Dance sets not running Heavy-Duty Boots are crippled by Stealth Rock; additionally, Pokemon that Scyther switches into like Tsareena, Scrafty, and Florges carry moves like Knock Off and Trick to severely cripple it and limit its longevity. Scyther's bulk isn't the best in general, since it is 2HKOed by the secondary STAB moves and coverage moves of Pokemon it'd easily beat otherwise like Brambleghast's Poltergeist, Toxicroak's Gunk Shot, and Breloom's Rock Tomb. Contact effects like Milotic's and Galarian Slowbro's Rocky Helmet as well as Bellibolt's Static can punish Scyther's tendency to pivot with U-turn.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>On Swords Dance sets, Quick Attack can be used instead of Trailblaze, as it doesn't need to be used before facing faster threats like Kilowattrel, Inteleon, and Cinccino to be effective. Tera Normal can also be utilized, boosting Quick Attack while also granting Scyther a free turn of setup, if needed, by avoiding powerful Ghost-type attacks from Decidueye and Brambleghast. Tera Ground can be used on Scyther, since it lets Scyther take attacks from Poison-, Fire-, Rock-, and Electric-types like Galarian Slowbro, Salazzle, Diancie, and Kilowattrel; on top of that, it allows Scyther to take advantage of Tera Blast to hit the former three super effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Kilowattrel, Galvantula, and Raikou all outspeed Scyther and threaten it with their Electric-type STAB moves, while Rotom-H is slower but can take Dual Wingbeat easily and retaliate back with Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave. However, if Scyther Terastallizes into an Electric-type, it can capitalize on and beat all of them.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Copperajah, Registeel, Orthworm, and Bronzong can all take Scyther's Dual Wingbeat, and the former three can handle constant U-turns. On top of that, they can capitalize on this by setting up entry hazards and, in the latter three's case, boosting as well. Close Combat dents the former three, and the latter can't deal with repeated U-turns, though.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Incineroar, Chandelure, and Hisuian Typhlosion can all switch in and take advantage of Scyther's Defog; the latter two can also capitalize on Swords Dance, if they run Choice Scarf, as well as Close Combat.

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Since Close Combat nails Steel-types like Registeel, Orthworm, and Tera Steel Sylveon, it complements Dual Wingbeat almost perfectly. Trailblaze allows Scyther to boost its Speed, letting it outpace and deal with faster Pokemon such as Kilowattrel, Cinccino, and Inteleon. Since on hyper offense builds Scyther is nearly always paired with Tidy Up Cinccino to remove entry hazards, it prefers Eviolite for more setup opportunities, but Heavy-Duty Boots can be used if a team has poor hazard removal or none at all. Technician powers up Dual Wingbeat and Trailblaze to make them quite powerful and dangerous attacks. Tera Electric lets Scyther flip what would otherwise be poor matchups against Pokemon like Kilowattrel, Oricorio-F and -P, and Tornadus into setup opportunities, and it lets Scyther disregard Thunder Wave from Registeel and Prankster Klefki. Tera Grass boosts Trailblaze, letting Scyther more easily beat Diancie as well as Water-types like Vaporeon and Gastrodon. Tera Fighting turns Scyther's Rock weakness into a resistance and gifts it a boost to Close Combat to better handle Steel- and Rock-types.</p> <p>On hyper offense, whether Cinccino chooses to be a lead or setup sweeper, it is a near-essential partner for Eviolite Scyther; Cinccino can remove entry hazards with Tidy Up and weaken as well as possibly take advantage of Scyther's checks like Bronzong, Gligar, and Diancie. Other hazard-removing and -denying leads like Rapid Spin Brambleghast and Taunt Lycanroc are appreciated as well, letting Scyther freely run Eviolite. Alolan Ninetales is a fantastic partner, since it can set up Aurora Veil to aid setup for Scyther. Steel-types like Registeel, Orthworm, and Bronzong are one of Scyther's biggest roadblocks, so Pokemon that can beat them outright like Paldean Tauros-W and -F, Flygon, Infernape, and Chandelure make for great partners. Toxtricity, Uxie, Porygon-Z, Calm Mind Scream Tail, and Diancie work well too, as they can work alongside Scyther to overwhelm the same Steel-types instead. Blanket physical walls such as Galarian Slowbro, Scream Tail, Gligar, and Milotic can be annoying to get past for Scyther, making teammates like Chandelure, Munkidori, Inteleon, Porygon-Z, and Toxtricity pair well. Cinccino, Porygon-Z, Incineroar, and Overqwil draw in Fighting- and Ground-types like Breloom, Flamigo, and Flygon that Scyther can take advantage of after they get KOed. Incineroar is quite a bothersome foe for Scyther, so it enjoys teammates that can weaken Incineroar, like Decidueye, Overqwil, and Salazzle, and ones that take it out completely, such as Paldean Tauros-W and -F, Infernape, and Flygon.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>U-turn lets Scyther pivot out of bad matchups against Bronzong, Galarian Slowbro, and Registeel while allowing it to maintain momentum. Close Combat targets the Steel-types that resist and try to switch into Scyther's STAB moves. Swords Dance allows Scyther to take advantage of a free turn, and it lets Scyther better break through more defensive teams. However, either Close Combat or Swords Dance can be replaced with Defog so that Scyther can provide its team with some much-needed entry hazard removal, since Defog is uncommon to come by. Tera Electric lets Scyther capitalize on would-be bad matchups against Kilowattrel, Tornadus, and Oricorio-P and -F, as well as gifting it an immunity to Scream Tail's and Prankster Klefki's Thunder Wave. However, Tera Steel provides Scyther with many resistances, letting it take attacks like Cinccino's Tail Slap, Inteleon's Ice Beam, and Munkidori's Sludge Wave. Tera Fighting powers up Scyther's Close Combat and makes its Rock weakness a resistance, helping it out when it pivots into Stealth Rock if it's already lost its Heavy-Duty Boots, though.</p> <p>Steel-types such as Bronzong, Registeel, and Orthworm try to take advantage of Scyther using its STAB attacks, so partners like Chandelure, Flygon, and Paldean Tauros-F pair extremely well. In a similar vein, Fire-types like Incineroar, Chandelure, and Hisuian Typhlosion often switch into Scyther, trying to capitalize on its U-turn and, in the latter two's case, its Close Combat as well. Because of this, switch-ins to these Pokemon like Milotic, Incineroar, and Goodra are greatly appreciated. Gastrodon is an especially noteworthy partner, as it provides a switch-in to Steel- and Fire-types, handles Kilowattrel, a common Scyther check, and sets entry hazards, which complements Scyther's pivoting quite well. Other hazard setters that can achieve the same thing such as Bronzong, Diancie, Swampert, and Gligar work just as well. While Scyther can take attacks from Fighting- and Ground-types such as Breloom, Paldean Tauros-W, and Flygon, it is quite a poor check due to its frailty, so more solid or secondary checks like Sylveon, Galarian Slowbro, Amoonguss, and Whimsicott are great partners. Rotom-H, Flygon, and Munkidori work well as teammates; Rotom-H can switch into Ground-type attacks and take care of Water-types; Flygon appreciates how Scyther threatens Grass-types like Tsareena and Whimsicott and can provide it with a way to handle Fire-and Steel-types; Munkidori can spread poison to weaken checks like Diancie, Incineroar, and Vaporeon and remove Poison-types like Galarian Slowbro and Tera Poison Sylveon. Scyther often finds itself pivoting out against physical walls like Galarian Slowbro, Bellibolt, and Gligar, making wallbreakers such as Hisuian Typhlosion, Toxtricity, and Inteleon good teammates.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Paldean Tauros-W splashes its way to the top of the tier as one of the best wallbreakers thanks to its strong STAB attacks boosted with Choice Band or Bulk Up, good Speed tier, and great matchup against top threats like Flygon and Incineroar. With a Choice Band, it threatens common physical walls like Swampert, Galarian Slowbro, and Bellibolt. Alternatively, it can choose to set up with Bulk Up, which prevents physical revenge killers from trying to stop it. Not only does it have a good Speed tier, outspeeding wallbreakers like Porygon-Z, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Toxicroak, but it has a strong priority option in Aqua Jet to beat weakened, faster foes like Kilowattrel and Cinccino. However, it can be easy to take advantage of. If it is Choice Band, then Pokemon immune to Water like Vaporeon or Toxicroak as well as Ghost-types like Chandelure can switch in and punish it. Other foes that resist its STAB moves like Galarian Slowbro and Vileplume use Rocky Helmet to punish its use of contact moves; the latter can punish it further due to Effect Spore. Vileplume is able to hard wall Bulk Up variants, stopping any attempt to set up or forcing the use of Tera. Its Speed tier is good, but not good enough, as some wallbreakers like Kilowattrel, Tornadus, and Munkidori outspeed and revenge it with ease.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Iron Head can be used as an option to hit Tera Fairy Vaporeon, but that's its only target because Wave Crash hits the other Fairy-types for more damage. Trailblaze can be paired with Bulk Up to outspeed would-be faster Pokemon like Kilowattrel and Choice Scarf Porygon-Z.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Vileplume is a hard counter, resisting both of its STAB attacks and only ever getting 2HKOed by Choice Band Zen Headbutt. Defensive Brambleghast can be problematic due to its immunity to Fighting-type moves and Water resistance; that in combination with Strength Sap can wall Paldean Tauros-W. Choice Scarf users like Rotom-C and Tsareena can revenge kill it while resisting its Water-type moves. Decidueye resists Wave Crash and is immune to Close Combat, letting it switch in and set up at no cost.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Bulky Psychic-types like Cresselia and Galarian Slowbro can tank any of Paldean Tauros-W's hits and threaten it in return. Others like Munkidori and Espeon outspeed it and threaten to KO or force the use of Tera Steel.</p> <p><strong>Water-immune and -resistant Pokemon</strong>: Vaporeon and Gastrodon are both immune to Wave Crash and Raging Bull and can use Tera Fairy to resist Close Combat. Vaporeon and Milotic can use Scald to burn it. Toxicroak is immune to its Water-type moves and resists Close Combat, often giving it a free turn to set up. Tera Water Galarian Slowbro is hardly threatened by Paldean Tauros-W, and it can hit it back with a super effective Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Some of Paldean Tauros-W's most common checks, like Vileplume, Galarian Slowbro, and Houndstone, tend to use Rocky Helmet, punishing it for simply attacking. On top of that, one of its main STAB attacks inflicts recoil damage, which adds up over any given match. This also leads into it having a poor matchup against Talonflame, Vileplume, and Bellibolt, which all have abilities that can status it on contact.</p>",

Choice Band also takes advantage of Aqua Jet's priority to revenge kill faster threats like Kilowattrel, Munkidori, and Choice Scarf Chandelure. Choice Scarf allows it to use Raging Bull instead of Aqua Jet, giving it another Water-type STAB move that doesn't have recoil damage. Zen Headbutt allows it to 2HKO Vileplume, while Earthquake is more accurate and has higher damage against other Poison-types like Galarian Slowbro and Dragalge. Choice Scarf enables Paldean Tauros-W to turn into a revenge killer, outspeeding and KOing threats like Inteleon, Munkidori, and Kilowattrel. Tera Water pushes Wave Crash's damage through the roof, opening room for new 2HKOs on Pokemon like Cresselia, defensive Brambleghast, and Bellibolt. Tera Fighting buffs Close Combat, enabling it to OHKO Klefki and, after some prior chip damage, Diancie and Vaporeon.</p> <p>Psychic- and Fairy-types like Cresselia, Munkidori, and Sylveon all heavily threaten Paldean Tauros-W with their super effective STAB attacks while being able to tank its Close Combat. This opens room for Steel-types and certain special walls like Bronzong, Registeel, and Incineroar; in return, Paldean Tauros-W helps deal with Fire- and Ground-types, like Chandelure, Flygon, and Swampert, that hinder those Pokemon. Ground-types like Flygon, Swampert, and Gastrodon take advantage of Electric-types like Kilowattrel, Bellibolt, and Rotom-C, which can all KO Paldean Tauros-W with ease. Due to its struggles with taking on common physical walls like Vileplume, Galarian Slowbro, and Tera Poison Avalugg, special wallbreakers like Munkidori, Porygon-Z, and Hisuian Typhlosion make for great partners. Due to recoil damage, Rocky Helmet, and entry hazards, it appreciates Wish support from Pokemon like Sylveon and Florges as well as Lunar Dance from Choice Scarf Cresselia. Vaporeon and Toxicroak are both checks to it due to their Water immunity; this opens up room for certain Pokemon like Rotom-C and Kilowattrel. Galarian Articuno in particular forms a core with it thanks to Future Sight and U-turn to pressure Vileplume and other Pokemon that switch into Paldean Tauros-W; in return, Paldean Tauros-W helps defeat any Steel- and Dark-types that Galarian Articuno loses to.</p>"

      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Raging Bull can be used over Wave Crash as a strong option if Paldean Tauros-W is not using Leftovers to help mitigate recoil damage. Aqua Jet gives it a form of strong priority, making revenge killing it with Kilowattrel and Munkidori much harder. Zen Headbutt helps to hit Poison-types like Vileplume, Toxicroak, and Dragalge. Substitute can be used instead for longevity, pairing well with Tera Steel to become immune to status and Vileplume's Leech Seed. Leftovers gives it some form of longevity while setting up and lets it regain some HP lost due to Wave Crash's recoil. Lum Berry grants it a one-time immunity to any status it may obtain from the likes of Talonflame's Flame Body and Vileplume's Effect Spore. Tera Steel grants useful resistances to Fairy-, Psychic-, Flying-, and Grass-type attacks that Paldean Tauros-W is otherwise weak to, while Tera Electric lets it wall and take advantage of Kilowattrel, disregard Thunder Wave, and take Flying-type attacks from Oricorio formes and Tornadus. Alternatively, Tera Water boosts the damage of Wave Crash and Raging Bull, though it doesn't offer much defensive utility.</p> <p>This set excels when partnered with other setup sweepers on a hyper offense team, such as Flygon, Chandelure, and Incineroar; they all appreciate having Galvantula as a lead to lay Sticky Web on the opposing side, slowing down any faster Pokemon. Froslass, Brambleghast, and Iron Thorns are other good leads for these teams, using Spikes to wear down already unstable checks. Despite that, Paldean Tauros-W isn't a one-trick pony, being a staple on some balance builds, especially when paired with Flygon. It helps beat some of Flygon's checks such as Bronzong, Orthworm, and Choice Scarf Cresselia; simultaneously, Flygon pressures Paldean Tauros-W's checks like Galarian Slowbro, Toxicroak, and Vileplume. It appreciates Steel-types like Bronzong, Registeel, and Klefki to tank any Psychic- and Fairy-type attacks coming its way. Flygon, Swampert, and Volt Absorb Kilowattrel do a great job at punishing any Electric-types trying to revenge it like opposing Kilowattrel and Choice Scarf Rotom-C. It appreciates help from Pokemon like Munkidori and Meloetta to threaten Vileplume, Galarian Slowbro, and Houndstone; Paldean Tauros-W, in return, alleviates pressure from Dark-types like Incineroar, Alolan Muk, and Umbreon.</p>"

  "Vaporeon": {
    "overview": "<p>Vaporeon's typing and good defenses let it check common physical attackers like Paldean Tauros-W, Incineroar, and Flygon, and Water Absorb makes it one of the best answers to opposing Water-types like Inteleon and Basculegion-M. Compared to other physically bulky Water-types like Swampert and Quagsire, Vaporeon excels due to its access to reliable recovery in Wish and its ability to pivot and potentially pass Wish to its teammates with Flip Turn. Vaporeon can also run Haze, which allows it to check bulky setup sweepers like Calm Mind Cresselia and Iron Defense Registeel. However, more powerful or more aggressively boosting foes, such as Swords Dance Mienshao and Nasty Plot Munkidori, can overwhelm Vaporeon. Additionally, while Vaporeon can be a great blanket check to certain physical and special attackers, it can be easily overwhelmed at times by either how many it has to check in a battle or their sheer power. Grass- and Electric-type attackers, such as Poison Heal Breloom, Brambleghast, and Kilowattrel, are quite common as well and easily force Vaporeon out.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>As an alternative to Haze, Vaporeon can utilize Roar to phaze opposing setup sweepers. Calm Mind can be used on Vaporeon to let it take advantage of forced switches and passive Pokemon, usually alongside Ice Beam to make progress against Toxicroak and Grass-types like Vileplume. However, this set is still walled by opposing Water-types. Tera Fairy can be used to resist Fighting- and Dragon-type attacks, and Tera Ghost can be used to completely wall Paldean Tauros-W.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Vaporeon is weak to common Grass-type attackers such as Brambleghast, Technician Breloom, and Tsareena. However, all of these hate switching into a Scald burn. Grass-type coverage, like Chandelure's Energy Ball and Tera Grass Paldean Tauros-F's Trailblaze, can also be threatening.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-type attackers like Kilowattrel and Iron Thorns force Vaporeon out, and they can take advantage of this by gaining momentum or setting up.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Strong special attackers, such as Porygon-Z, Chandelure, and Dragalge, scare out Vaporeon, and the first two have Trick to cripple it.</p> <p><strong>Water-immune Pokemon</strong>: As Vaporeon only runs Water-type attacks, it cannot actually damage opposing Water-immune Pokemon. Most prominently, Toxicroak can set up on Vaporeon or throw out powerful attacks, Gastrodon can set entry hazards, and opposing Vaporeon are untouchable.</p>",

Alternatively, Haze gives Vaporeon an option to prevent opposing setup sweepers like Calm Mind Cresselia and Iron Defense Registeel from boosting out of control. Leftovers gives Vaporeon additional healing, particularly in combination with Protect to gain free turns to heal. However, Heavy-Duty Boots allows Vaporeon to pivot more frequently without concern for entry hazard chip damage. Tera Poison gives Vaporeon a resistance to Fighting- and Grass-type attacks from common physical attackers such as Mienshao, Breloom, and Brambleghast, as well as an immunity to being poisoned by Umbreon's Toxic. Tera Dark, on the other hand, allows Vaporeon to temporarily check Stored Power sweepers like Bronzong and Cresselia if it doesn't have Haze, as well as Choice Band Tera Blast Ghost Basculegion, which would 2HKO it otherwise.</p> <p>Vaporeon benefits from teammates that can take powerful special attacks from foes like Chandelure, Porygon-Z, and Munkidori, so special walls like Incineroar, Bronzong, and Assault Vest Alolan Muk support it well. These teammates also benefit from Wish being passed to them, as they lack reliable recovery. A backup physical wall such as Sylveon or Vileplume is useful to ensure Vaporeon isn't overwhelmed by Ground- and Fighting-types like Flygon and Mienshao. On non-Heavy-Duty Boots sets, entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Talonflame, Tsareena, and Brambleghast is vital to ensure Vaporeon doesn't become excessively passive by being forced to heal each time it comes out. Powerful wallbreakers such as Mienshao, Flygon, and Chandelure benefit from Wish and Flip Turn support from Vaporeon, allowing them to repeatedly switch in and break opposing walls.</p>"

Good Speed further distinguishes Hisuian Typhlosion, giving it an advantage over wallbreakers like Breloom, Heracross, and Chandelure. However, the power of Hisuian Typhlosion's Eruption completely depends on it being healthy, either restricting it to running Heavy-Duty Boots or mandating tight entry hazard control. Hisuian Typhlosion may be fast for a wallbreaker, but common faster threats like Flygon, Inteleon, and Paldean Tauros-W all handily outspeed and OHKO Hisuian Typhlosion given its fragility, and all of them have Choice Scarf sets to match Hisuian Typhlosion's own Choice Scarf set. In addition, priority users like the aforementioned Paldean Tauros-W, Basculegion, and Toxicroak threaten to diminish Hisuian Typhlosion's strongest move if they don't outright KO it. Incineroar is a particularly troublesome and common check, forcing Hisuian Typhlosion to risk missing with Focus Blast and making it easily intercepted afterward by any specially defensive Fire-resistant Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hisuian Typhlosion can run Solar Beam over Focus Blast on sun teams for a powerful coverage move against bulky Water- and Ground-types, but this leaves it defenseless against Incineroar. Choice Specs sets are nearly impossible for anything but the bulkiest Fire-resistant Pokemon to withstand, though this comes at the cost of Hisuian Typhlosion becoming vulnerable to revenge killers like Inteleon and Scyther. Hisuian Typhlosion lacks the capacity to use Infernal Parade effectively, as its fragility means it struggles to stay on the field long enough to spread burns. Blaze gives Flamethrower and Fire Blast a surge in power once Hisuian Typhlosion has been worn into range of activation; however, it should avoid being put into range of Blaze if possible, as it's most effective when using Eruption. Tera Blast in conjunction with a Grass Tera Type could let Hisuian Typhlosion surprise and overwhelm bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Gastrodon, Swampert, and Milotic. However, Hisuian Typhlosion struggles to capitalize on Terastallization well or fit Tera Blast over any of its other moves, and running it often means depriving other teammates of a valuable resource.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Fire-Resistant Pokemon</strong>: Resisting Eruption, boasting solid special bulk, and setting Stealth Rock make Diancie a pain for Hisuian Typhlosion to beat without repeated opportunities to wear it down. Vaporeon, Milotic, and Gastrodon can wall Hisuian Typhlosion thanks to their recovery moves. Dragalge, Tentacruel, Swampert, and Goodra can tank even a Tera Fire-boosted Eruption from Hisuian Typhlosion in sun and hit it back hard, though they cannot switch into such a powerful attack repeatedly.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority Users</strong>: Inteleon and Choice Scarf Chandelure can dispatch non-Choice Scarf Hisuian Typhlosion sets on their own. Aqua Jet from Basculegion, Paldean Tauros-W, and even Overqwil threatens to at least neuter if not outright OHKO Hisuian Typhlosion. Sucker Punch from Toxicroak and Shadow Sneak from Decidueye, Alolan Muk, and Brambleghast similarly threaten to chip Hisuian Typhlosion to reduce the power of Eruption for their teammates if they're unable to finish it off. However, few to none of these Pokemon switch into Hisuian Typhlosion well, and that's if they can switch in at all.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Any damage takes away from Hisuian Typhlosion's ability to wallbreak effectively with Eruption, so entry hazards are terrible for Choice Scarf sets. Hisuian Typhlosion even struggles to switch into passive targets like Bronzong, Amoonguss, and Wish Sylveon due to the risk of taking any damage.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Flamethrower becomes Hisuian Typhlosion's stronger Fire-type STAB move once it's below 60% HP. Shadow Ball nails Flash Fire Chandelure and prevents Fire-resistant Pokemon like Paldean Tauros-W, opposing Hisuian Typhlosion, and Basculegion from switching in unscathed, though Hisuian Typhlosion should generally spam Eruption whenever possible. Focus Blast targets Incineroar with super effective damage. Heavy-Duty Boots enables Hisuian Typhlosion to safely enter the field repeatedly with entry hazards up in order to preserve the power of its Eruption, making it less dependent on hazard removal to function. Frisk scouts opposing foes, helping to determine whether or not Hisuian Typhlosion should stay in to attack slower foes with multiple sets, including ones such as Swords Dance Overqwil, Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, and Choice Scarf Heracross. Tera Fighting boosts the power of Focus Blast for Incineroar and helps Hisuian Typhlosion take Dark-type attacks like Sucker Punch from Toxicroak and Knock Off from Scyther, giving it room to retaliate.</p> <p>Pivots, including Flamigo, Milotic, and Vaporeon, excel at finding opportunities to bring Hisuian Typhlosion onto the field without scuffing its health, and they tend to draw in Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro and Decidueye for Hisuian Typhlosion to threaten. Flygon, Gligar, Diancie, and Kilowattrel greatly appreciate Hisuian Typhlosion as a partner that pressures Bronzong; Flygon and Gligar can check Alolan Muk and position Hisuian Typhlosion with U-turn, and Flygon and Diancie can offensively and defensively check Incineroar. In particular, Kilowattrel makes a great partner to Hisuian Typhlosion by checking Water-types and potentially taking advantage of Incineroar's Intimidate with Competitive. Dragalge, Toxtricity, and Sylveon can rely on Hisuian Typhlosion to break Registeel for them; the former two can get Hisuian Typhlosion in with Flip Turn and Volt Switch, while the last one can support Hisuian Typhlosion with Wish. Toxicroak's Water immunity and ability to check Alolan Muk can make it a helpful partner to Hisuian Typhlosion, and the two of them can wear down their shared Ground-type checks.

Flamethrower is a more consistent alternative to Fire Blast, which is especially helpful given Hisuian Typhlosion's frailty becomes a huge liability if it doesn't KO the foe in front of it. Choice Scarf turns Hisuian Typhlosion into a potent revenge killer and potential late-game cleaner, and it ensures it can beat fast foes such as Munkidori and Kilowattrel and slower Choice Scarf users like Porygon-Z and Chandelure. Tera Fire makes Hisuian Typhlosion's Eruption nearly unable to be walled, 2HKOing Alolan Muk and offensive Incineroar and giving it the chance to OHKO Registeel and Gligar after Stealth Rock damage. Tera Fighting cranks up the power of Focus Blast to particularly punish Incineroar. The Fighting typing both enables Hisuian Typhlosion to take a Sucker Punch from Toxicroak and better preserves Eruption's power by turning Hisuian Typhlosion's weakness to Stealth Rock into a resistance.</p> <p>Entry hazard control is necessary to preserve the power of Hisuian Typhlosion's Eruption. Scyther, Tentacruel, and Tsareena are all hazard removers that have pivot moves to safely bring Hisuian Typhlosion in. Hyper offense teams especially appreciate Hisuian Typhlosion's power, and their tempo is conducive to it spamming Eruption. Cinccino is a great teammate on hyper offense teams, as it can use Tidy Up to clear the field of hazards, while Hisuian Typhlosion threatens Steel-types like Bronzong and Registeel. Flygon, Staraptor, and Flamigo can take care of Paldean Tauros-F, Milotic, and Incineroar to open up Hisuian Typhlosion to sweep later. Slow and defensive pivots, including Swampert, Milotic, and Dragalge, can get Hisuian Typhlosion onto the field unscathed, and they draw in faster foes like Brambleghast, Kilowattrel, and Munkidori for it to surprise. Hazard setters like Bronzong and Diancie make Hisuian Typhlosion more punishing to switch around, and their hazards help to wear down checks to Hisuian Typhlosion that may lack Heavy-Duty Boots, such as Vaporeon, Milotic, and Diancie.

Many hazard stack teams appreciate Gligar's access to Knock Off allowing them to overwhelm foes with hazards. Immunity lets Gligar consistently switch in against foes that spread poison, like Alolan Muk, Toxicroak, and Overqwil. However, Gligar lacks any form of recovery, meaning many foes that it checks like Incineroar, Flygon, and Heracross can wear it down over a battle. Furthermore, Gligar often switches into Knock Off users such as Cinccino, Copperajah, and Incineroar that can reduce its effectiveness.

Alternatively, Toxic allows it to pressure defensive tanks like Vaporeon and Gastrodon. Gligar can run Stealth Rock alongside Spikes, letting it set up multiple hazards. Knock Off is preferred over U-turn if Gligar is running dual hazards. Gligar can run Acrobatics so that if it loses its Eviolite it can hit Fighting- and Grass-types like Flamigo, Heracross, and Amoonguss with a strong STAB attack. 56 Speed EVs allow Gligar to outspeed Adamant Incineroar, while 140 Speed EVs let it outpace Jolly Incineroar and Adamant Decidueye. Tera Water allows Gligar to handle foes like Inteleon, Basculegion, Paldean Tauros-W, and Hisuian Typhlosion in a pinch.</p> <p>Gligar appreciates teammates like Toxicroak, Breloom, and Brambleghast, as they can handle bulky Water-types such as Vaporeon, Gastrodon, and Milotic. In return, it handles Poison-types like Galarian Slowbro and Overqwil. Gligar pairs well with Wish passers such as Sylveon, Vaporeon, and Florges for recovery, and they allow it to consistently handle physical attackers like Flygon and Toxicroak. Gligar synergizes greatly with other entry hazards setters such as Copperajah, Bronzong, and Registeel, since they can set hazards. These hazard setters can also form good defensive cores with it, as they can check special attackers like Munkidori, whereas Gligar can handle physical ones such as Toxicroak and Flygon. Similarly, Gligar appreciates more dedicated special walls such as Porygon2, Milotic, and Gastrodon, since they check powerful special wallbreakers like Toxtricity, Inteleon, and Sylveon that can overwhelm Gligar. Wallbreakers such as Basculegion, Decidueye, and Porygon-Z appreciate hazard support from Gligar letting them weaken defensive tanks like Amoonguss and Diancie.</p>"

  "Porygon2": {
    "overview": "<p>Porygon2's good Eviolite-boosted defenses and access to Trace make it one of the best special walls in the tier. Porygon2 utilizes Trace to great effect, copying abilities such as Chandelure's Flash Fire, Vaporeon's Water Absorb, Amoonguss's Regenerator, and Toxtricity's Punk Rock. Boasting an impressive Special Attack, Porygon2 circumvents its passivity by threatening 2HKOs or 3HKOs on most offensive Pokemon with its Tri Attack and super effective coverage options. Porygon2's Normal typing is great for letting it be a general blanket check, but its lack of resistances can lead to it being overwhelmed, especially with its susceptibility to entry hazards, since it cannot run Heavy-Duty Boots. Porygon2 is also very vulnerable to physical attackers such as Incineroar and Gligar using Knock Off as well as Choice item users like Chandelure and Munkidori using Trick, since it relies heavily on Eviolite to boost its bulk. Additionally, Porygon2 struggles to threaten bulky Steel-types, such as Registeel and Bronzong, which can allow them opportunities to come in on it for free. On top of that, Porygon2 cannot handle Calm Mind setup sweepers like Sylveon and Scream Tail on its own, especially if they have recovery moves, but it can slow them down with Thunder Wave, allowing a teammate to handle them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Discharge can be used as an alternative to Thunder Wave, since it gives Porygon2 space for more offensive options while still letting it fish for paralysis, though Thunder Wave's guaranteed paralysis is generally preferred. Download can be used over Trace, boosting Porygon2's offensive power and making it more difficult for offensive threats to safely switch into it. However, Trace's overall utility is usually much better.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Item Displacement</strong>: Porygon2 relies on Eviolite for much of its walling power, meaning it is very susceptible to moves like Knock Off and Trick, which can remove the Eviolite. Many physical attackers such as Incineroar, Swampert, Alolan Muk, and Gligar carry Knock Off and can hinder Porygon2's bulk to allow partners to break through it more easily. Additionally, special attackers with Choice items, such as Chandelure, Porygon-Z, and Munkidori, can cripple Porygon2 by giving it a Choice item, using Trick.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Porygon2 struggles against bulky Steel-types such as Registeel, Bronzong, and Copperajah. They aren't generally hindered by Thunder Wave and have ways to set entry hazards or boost their own stats, letting these Steel-types exploit Porygon2's lack of coverage to hit them. The first two also threaten Porygon2 with a powerful Body Press.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Powerful physical Fighting-types such as Paldean Tauros-F and -W, Breloom, and Flamigo all threaten Porygon2 with their strong Close Combat. While most do not want to switch into a Thunder Wave, they can pivot in and force Porygon2 out, and Lum Berry Paldean Tauros formes as well as Poison Heal Breloom ignore Thunder Wave altogether and can use Porygon2 as a chance to setup with Bulk Up, Swords Dance, or Substitute.</p>",

      "Special Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Shadow Ball complements Tri Attack, hitting Ghost-types such as Chandelure, Decidueye, and Hisuian Typhlosion while also dealing super effective damage to Bronzong. Porygon2 can also run a BoltBeam set. Ice Beam threatens Ground-types that might be tempted to switch into a Thunder Wave, such as Flygon and Gligar as well as Grass-types such as Breloom and Amoonguss, which are otherwise very threatening to Porygon2. Thunderbolt handles bulky Water-types like Milotic and Vaporeon that could chip down Porygon2 or Wish pass to allies for free. Foul Play is useful against any physical attackers, such as Basculegion-M, Scyther, and Tera Steel Flygon, as well as physically frail Pokemon such as Espeon and Munkidori. Trace gives Porygon2 amazing defensive utility, providing a massive advantage against a number of Pokemon. For example, it can Trace Vaporeon's Water Absorb, Porygon-Z's Adaptability, Munkidori's Toxic Chain, Toxtricity's Punk Rock, Chandelure's Flash Fire, Incineroar's as well as Paldean Tauros-W's Intimidate, and Klefki's as well as Tornadus's Prankster. Tera Poison is an excellent defensive typing overall and prevents Porygon2 from being poisoned, which is vital against Pokemon like Munkidori, Alolan Muk, and Amoonguss that attempt to cripple Porygon2 by poisoning it. Alternatively, Tera Ghost makes Porygon2 Fighting-immune and boosts the power of Shadow Ball. Finally, Tera Fairy, if Porygon2 copies Flygon's Levitate, allows it to completely wall both of Flygon's STAB attacks while being a generally useful defensive typing. In addition to that, unlike Tera Ghost, Tera Poison and Fairy allow Porygon2 to resist Scrappy Flamigo's Close Combat.</p> <p>Porygon2's weakness to Knock Off users and physical attackers, especially Fighting-types such as Flamigo, Toxicroak, and Heracross, means that it appreciates teammates that can switch into these Pokemon. Amoonguss and Galarian Slowbro make for excellent partners thanks to their Poison typing and Regenerator, allowing them to come in repeatedly throughout the game and tank hits from these threats. Avalugg is another physical wall that pairs well with Porygon2. Despite Avalugg still being weak to Fighting and Knock Off, Porygon2 covers many of its weaknesses by being a blanket special wall that can take on special attackers for it. In return, Avalugg removes entry hazards for Porygon2. Other hazard control options such as Defog Scyther and Altaria are also good partners for Porygon2, since they remove hazards for it while providing good defensive synergy with their Fighting resistances. Porygon2 also appreciates teaming up with physical wallbreakers, especially Fighting-types that can take advantage of bulky Steel-types, which Porygon2 tends to allow in. Flamigo, Paldean Tauros-W and -F, and Heracross are great for this, since they also have good defensive synergy with Porygon2 and appreciate it spreading paralysis to faster Pokemon. Bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Milotic, and Tentacruel can spread status to physical attackers like Flamigo, Flygon, and Scyther that threaten Porygon2 while also checking Hisuian Typhlosion, one of the only special attackers that consistently carries Fighting-type coverage moves. These bulky Water-types also often carry phazing moves, which are very helpful against bulky setup sweepers like Registeel and Bronzong, which Porygon2 struggles against. Additionally, Tentacruel can also provide Rapid Spin support for Porygon2.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Swampert is an excellent wall. Its great defensive typing gives it resistances and immunities to Fire-, Poison-, and Electric-type attacks from the likes of Infernape, Alolan Muk, and Iron Thorns, and it threatens them with Earthquake. While there is some competition for the Water-type slot on teams, Swampert is unique in its ability to simultaneously threaten Electric-types and pivot out with Flip Turn, often slowly enough to bring its teammate in completely safely. On top of this, Swampert also has access to Knock Off, which is valuable utility to cripple item-reliant Pokemon like Talonflame, Avalugg, and Registeel, and Roar, which allows Swampert to challenge setup sweepers like Cresselia and Oricorio-E. However, its limited recovery options make Swampert vulnerable to being worn down over the course of a battle, meaning it won't be able to check these aforementioned setup sweepers long-term. Swampert's 4x weakness to Grass-type attacks also hampers it, as it struggles against common Grass-types like Tsareena, Breloom, and Brambleghast. On top of this, many Pokemon like Chandelure, Gallade, and Iron Thorns carry some way to surprise Swampert with Grass-type coverage, whether that be Energy Ball, Leaf Blade, or Tera Blast Grass.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>More offensive sets like Choice Band or bulkier ones that utilize Assault Vest can work, but it's difficult to fit another entry hazard setter that doesn't add on to Swampert's Grass-type weakness. Swampert can run special attacks like Hydro Pump, Earth Power, and Ice Beam; however, if Swampert goes this route, it struggles to fit these moves and its great utility options on the same set, as it wants all of Knock Off, pivoting, hazards, STAB moves, and powerful coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types and Grass-type coverage</strong>: Foes like Vileplume and Breloom can be immensely threatening. Grass-types with Rapid Spin like Brambleghast and Tsareena are particularly dangerous foes because they can chase Swampert out while removing Stealth Rock simultaneously. Pokemon with Grass-type coverage like Grass Knot Infernape, Energy Ball Chandelure, and Tera Blast Grass Iron Thorns can typically KO Swampert without warning from high health.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Swampert lacks reliable recovery, so it is vulnerable to repeated damage from entry hazards, status ailments from Vileplume's Effect Spore and Talonflame's Flame Body, and repeated attacks from foes it is meant to check like Mienshao, Munkidori, and Hisuian Typhlosion. Knock Off users like Incineroar and Alolan Muk only exacerbate this issue with their ability to remove Swampert's Leftovers.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Flip Turn allows Swampert to pivot out and bring in teammates to make progress. Knock Off supplies utility against foes that Swampert cannot hit well with its STAB moves, and it cripples item-reliant foes like Munkidori, Talonflame, and Avalugg. However, Roar prevents Swampert's passivity from getting taken advantage of by stopping setup sweepers like Oricorio-E and Paldean Tauros-W. The physically defensive EV spread is better into attackers like Flygon and Mienshao, but a specially defensive one assists against Electric-types like Rotom-H and Raikou. Tera Poison turns Swampert's 4x weakness to Grass-type attacks into a resistance and helps it more easily take on the myriad of Fighting-types like Mienshao, Infernape, and Breloom. Tera Fairy makes Swampert immune to Dragon-type attacks from threats like Dragalge and resistant to Dark- and Fighting-type attacks from foes such as Brute Bonnet and Mienshao while allowing it to continue checking Ground-types like Flygon. Tera Dragon gives Swampert resistances to Water-, Fire-, and Grass-type attacks, making it strong against common attackers like Basculegion-M, Incineroar, and Breloom. Tera Steel gives Swampert a wide array of resistances to more easily handle special attackers like Dragalge and Sylveon.</p> <p>Swampert benefits from the support of Grass-resistant teammates like Dragalge, Talonflame, and Incineroar, covering its biggest weakness. Swampert's Stealth Rock can be supplemented by Grass-resistant Spikes users like Klefki and Brambleghast to stack entry hazards, both of which also benefit from Swampert's Fire resistance. Ghost-type teammates like Brambleghast and Chandelure can also support Swampert's Stealth Rock by preventing Rapid Spin from opposing Tsareena and Avalugg. Knock Off users like Alolan Muk, Incineroar, and Mienshao can further support Swampert's entry hazards by removing items. While Swampert can take multiple hits, it lacks any reliable recovery, so pairing it with Wish passers like Sylveon and Florges or backup walls like Dragalge, Vileplume, Registeel, and Incineroar can be helpful. As Swampert lures in Grass-types like Tsareena and Vileplume, wallbreakers that can take advantage of Swampert's pivoting like Infernape, Dragalge, and Chandelure can threaten these foes and force others to switch in and take damage from Swampert's Stealth Rock.</p>"

  "Breloom": {
    "overview": "<p>Breloom's monstrous Attack, especially when coupled with Technician, makes it difficult to switch into at times. On top of this, it has the rare trait of being a Fighting-type that easily beats Water-types like Vaporeon, Swampert, and Milotic; however, it competes with Toxicroak for this role, which has an immunity to Water-type attacks and a higher Speed tier to boot. Breloom can circumvent its middling Speed with a Technician-boosted Mach Punch, though, and while Breloom has solid checks like Vileplume, Galarian Slowbro, and Tornadus, it can carry coverage moves to make quick work of them. Breloom is even immune to Vileplume's Effect Spore, letting it attack it without worry, though it needs to be wary of Rocky Helmet. However, Breloom can't beat all of these checks in one set, forcing it to choose which foes it prefers to beat. Additionally, even though it can be worked around, its Speed can be taken advantage of by multiple other wallbreakers like Chandelure, Staraptor, and Toxtricity. While Breloom has good resistances like Water and Ground, these are often rendered moot by its low defenses, and Water-types, which it can normally check, might burn it with Scald, worsening its damage output and ability to beat them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Breloom can equip a Choice Scarf to become a surprise revenge killer, but its mediocre Speed tier and access to a Technician-boosted Mach Punch makes this set unappealing overall. Gunk Shot lets Breloom hit Grass- and Fairy-types that try to switch into its STAB attacks super effectively like Brambleghast, Whimsicott, and Scream Tail while dealing good damage to Flying-types like Tornadus and Kilowattrel that try to do the same.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Galarian Slowbro, Dragalge, and Vileplume all easily wall Breloom, and both Toxicroak and Tera Poison Uxie can easily use it as setup fodder. However, if Breloom carries Bulldoze, the majority of these aren't an issue, and Aerial Ace can make quick work of Vileplume.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Kilowattrel and Galarian Articuno wall Breloom's STAB moves and can use it for momentum, while Tornadus and Scyther can do the same and also capitalize on Breloom by setting up or throwing off their high-Base Power attacks. However, they're quite frail, meaning Mach Punch could pick them off if they've been sufficiently weakened, and Breloom can carry Rock Tomb and Tera Rock to handle them, though Scyther often carries Close Combat and doesn't worry about Substitute sets thanks to Dual Wingbeat's multi-hit nature.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion can take both of Breloom's STAB moves and retaliate with powerful Fire-type attacks. Paldean Tauros-F and Incineroar are also annoying for Breloom with their access to Intimidate. Breloom can take them out on the switch in with Rock Tomb or Bulldoze and can use Tera Rock to take one Fire-type attack if needed, though.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Munkidori, Meloetta, and Uxie can all threaten out Breloom, but the first two are susceptible to being picked off due to their frailty, and none of them take multiple Bullet Seed hits comfortably.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Aerial Ace allows Breloom to handle one of its best checks, Vileplume. However, Breloom could opt for Bulldoze instead, since Poison-types like Dragalge and Galarian Slowbro can be a pain for it to get past, but in doing so, Breloom gives up any chance of even touching Tornadus, Kilowattrel, and Galarian Articuno. Rock Tomb, on the other hand, allows Breloom to hit these aforementioned troublesome Flying-types as they switch in, and similarly to Bulldoze, it can hit Fire-types like Chandelure, Incineroar, and Hisuian Typhlosion. Seed Bomb can be used over Bullet Seed for its reliable damage output, as it's stronger if Bullet Seed only hits twice; however, the majority of the time, it's weaker, and Breloom is worse off running it. Since Breloom's Speed tier isn't too congested, Adamant is preferred for more power. Jolly does let it outpace Adamant Basculegion, Jolly Incineroar, and Modest Toxtricity, though. Tera Fighting lets Breloom boost its Close Combat and Mach Punch to absurd levels, allowing it to OHKO Alolan Muk and Bronzong and 2HKO Sylveon with the former as well as OHKO Inteleon and Mienshao with the latter. On the other hand, Tera Fire allows Breloom to avoid burns from Incineroar's Will-O-Wisp while letting it withstand a Fire-type attack from Hisuian Typhlosion, Chandelure, and the aforementioned Incineroar at least once. Tera Rock similarly gifts Breloom a Fire resistance and allows it to take Flying-type attacks from Galarian Articuno, Kilowattrel, and Tornadus so that it can retaliate with a STAB-boosted Rock Tomb.</p> <p>One of Breloom's main struggles when trying to wallbreak is getting past Poison-types like Vileplume, Dragalge, and Galarian Slowbro, so Psychic- and Ground-types like Munkidori, Uxie, and Flygon are greatly appreciated. The former two as well as Kilowattrel and Dragalge excel at pivoting Breloom in on Dark- and Steel-types like Klefki, Registeel, and Alolan Muk with their U-turn and Flip Turn. Galarian Articuno is an exceptionally good partner, as on top of also providing U-turn support, it can use Future Sight to limit Breloom's switch-ins even further and take advantage of Vileplume's Strength Sap with its Competitive. In a similar vein, pivots such as Mienshao, Incineroar, Inteleon, and the aforementioned Flygon are appreciated, as they commonly draw in Water-types, like Vaporeon, Milotic, Gastrodon, and Swampert, for Breloom to take advantage of. Flying-types like Kilowattrel and Tornadus can be similarly annoying, so switch-ins to these threats like Kilowattrel, Bellibolt, and Diancie have good synergy. Incineroar, Alolan Muk, and Bronzong, also make for decent partners, handling the Psychic- and Fairy-types, like Uxie, Munkidori, Whimsicott, and Sylveon, that force Breloom out.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>With its monstrous Attack and powerful coverage, Swords Dance Breloom is a terrifying setup sweeper and wallbreaker in NU. Bullet Seed in conjunction with Loaded Dice is Breloom's strongest STAB option, while Seed Bomb provides a Grass-type move without needing to use Loaded Dice, freeing up a slot for Life Orb. Close Combat lets Breloom break through walls like Bronzong and Incineroar but comes at the cost of not hitting Water-types like Swampert and Vaporeon as strongly. Mach Punch lets Breloom pick off Fighting-weak foes like Cinccino, as well as frailer Pokemon like Inteleon and Flygon. Aerial Ace threatens Grass-types, primarily Amoonguss, Decidueye, and Brambleghast, that resist Breloom's STAB combination. Bulldoze buries Poison-types like Alolan Muk, Galarian Slowbro, and Overqwil, as well as nailing Munkidori and Toxicroak on the switch in. Rock Tomb snipes Flying-types like Scyther, Kilowattrel, and Galarian Articuno, with the added benefit of dropping the foe's Speed, making Breloom far more threatening. Bulldoze and Rock Tomb also deter Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion from trying to wall Breloom's STAB moves.</p> <p>Breloom best fits as a wallbreaker on offensive and balanced teams, where its talent in dismantling defensive cores is greatly appreciated against bulkier teams. Hyper offense staples like Uxie, Flygon, and Torterra love Breloom's ability to tear apart defensive stalwarts like Registeel, Sylveon, and Avalugg, respectively, while they help Breloom weaken Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tsareena. On balance teams, teammates like Calm Mind Scream Tail, Paldean Tauros-W, and Overqwil enjoy Breloom handling Steel-, Grass-, and Ground-types. As Breloom is quite frail, defensive pivots like Gligar, Tentacruel, and Incineroar help Breloom hit the field safely; additionally, these Pokemon bait in Water- and Ground-types like Milotic and Gastrodon that Breloom feasts on. Offensive pivots like Kilowattrel, Infernape, and Inteleon can bring Breloom in on foes like Registeel, Tentacruel, and Vaporeon, respectively, where it can grab a boost and start wallbreaking. Entry hazard setters like Overqwil, Diancie, and Gligar assist Breloom with wearing down foes like Overqwil, Sylveon, and Alolan Muk. As Breloom is prone to being forced out by foes like Kilowattrel and Chandelure, a defensive backbone with walls like Bronzong and Incineroar can help deal with them. Steel-types like Registeel handle Poison-types like Munkidori, and Water-types such as Vaporeon help with Fire-types like Hisuian Typhlosion.</p>"

        "description": "<p>After Poison Heal Breloom activates its Toxic Orb, its immunity to status means it doesn't have to fear attempts to status it from Thunder Wave Galarian Slowbro and Scald users such as Vaporeon and Milotic. However, this could be completely negated if Breloom takes a Knock Off or Trick too early from Mienshao or Choice Scarf Florges. Seed Bomb gives Breloom a STAB move to let it reliably threaten bulky Water- and Ground-types like Vaporeon, Swampert, and Palossand, whereas Toxic allows Breloom to pressure troublesome Ghost-types that it would struggle with otherwise such as Chandelure, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Brambleghast as well as physical walls like Sylveon and Bellibolt. Protect allows Breloom to activate its Toxic Orb, gives it a free turn of Poison Heal recovery, and lets it scout out Choice item users like Flygon and Munkidori. Breloom could also choose to opt for other moves too, though. For example, Leech Seed allows Breloom to make progress against bulkier foes like Orthworm and Bronzong, Substitute lets it take advantage of passive Pokemon that give it more turns to heal such as Vaporeon and Gligar, Drain Punch lets Breloom target Dark- and Steel-types like Incineroar and Copperajah, Focus Punch pairs exceptionally well with Substitute and lets Breloom do major damage against the aforementioned foes and others like Diancie and Tsareena, and Swords Dance, which should be used in combination with Bulldoze as its last move, allows Breloom to become more threatening more quickly. The EV spread allows Breloom to maximize Poison Heal recovery, outspeed Dragalge, and OHKO Vileplume with a +2 Tera Normal Facade.</p> <p>Breloom appreciates pivot support from Flygon, Mienshao, Incineroar, and Inteleon, as they can force in Water-types like Milotic and Vaporeon for Breloom to take advantage of, and they grant it free entry because if it switches into a Scald without its Toxic Orb activated already, it risks getting burned. Physical walls like Galarian Slowbro, Milotic, and Dragalge are great partners for Breloom, since they can handle faster, more powerful foes like Mienshao, Chandelure, and Paldean Tauros-W. Bulky Poison-types like Galarian Slowbro, Vileplume, and Dragalge can tank Breloom's attacks when it's unboosted, so it best partners with Psychic- and Ground-types like Munkidori, Meloetta, and Flygon to check them. Flying-types like Kilowattrel and Tornadus can easily revenge kill Breloom. Thus, it appreciates Pokemon like Bellibolt, Diancie, and Rotom-H to take advantage of them. Breloom works well as a partner to Steel- and Dark-types like Copperajah, Bronzong, and Incineroar, as they can handle Fairy- and Psychic-types like Sylveon, Florges, and Meloetta. Breloom synergizes really well with Incineroar, Chandelure, and Hisuian Typhlosion, as it resists Ground-type attacks and can beat both Water- and Dark-types like Milotic and Scrafty for them. Pokemon that hate Scald like Flygon, Paldean Tauros-F, and Mienshao appreciate Breloom for dealing with Scald users like Vaporeon and Milotic for them.</p>"

Choice Band gives Flygon an incredibly spammable Earthquake and makes it a lot harder to switch into. Flygon can also pivot out with U-turn, allowing it to maintain offensive pressure and momentum. Dragon Dance Flygon can use Loaded Dice, which makes it a great late-game sweeper, and it also threatens lead entry hazard setters like Galvantula and Smeargle. However, as a Choice Scarf user, it faces competition from Mienshao and Infernape, both of which are faster than it and can revenge kill it with Close Combat. Additionally, Flygon's average Attack stat leaves it struggling when facing physical walls like Vaporeon, Vileplume, and Avalugg, as they can still take its attacks even after a Dragon Dance boost. Choice Scarf Flygon can be very easy to play around due to both of its STAB options having common immunities and resistances.</p>",

Flygon can also run a utility set with Stealth Rock / Earthquake / Dragon Tail / U-turn with a bulkier EV spread. This set allows it to set entry hazards for its teammates and check foes like Copperajah, Iron Thorns, and Infernape. Sadly, Flygon lacks any recovery, making it very easy for it to get worn down by chip damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Sylveon and Florges are able to tank hits from Choice Scarf Flygon and KO it back with their STAB Fairy-type attacks; however, neither of them can handle Choice Band sets, and they are complete setup fodder against Tera Steel Dragon Dance Flygon.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Physically defensive Pokemon such as Avalugg and Vileplume have enough bulk to win against any of Flygon's sets, but Vileplume has to be careful directly switching into +1 Flygon if entry hazards are present. Bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Swampert, and Quagsire are bulky enough to tank a boosted attack and threaten Flygon back with status and Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users and Faster Attackers</strong>: Infernape, Breloom, Brute Bonnet, and Basculegion can revenge kill Flygon after it has been weakened a bit.

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Outrage is one of Flygon's strongest STAB attacks for late-game cleaning, and it can 2HKO foes like Tsareena and Kilowattrel on a switch. Dragon Claw is a safer option to avoid getting locked into Outrage, but it's significantly weaker and is harder to revenge kill foes with. U-turn allows Flygon to maintain momentum and provide free switches to teammates. Flygon's last move is commonly Stone Edge, which allows it to hit Flying-types like Talonflame, Kilowattrel, and Oricorio-E. Alternatively, Stealth Rock allows it to set entry hazards for its teammates. Flygon can run Dragon Claw alongside Outrage so that it can still revenge kill foes like Kilowattrel and Tsareena without getting immediately destroyed by Fairy-types. First Impression can be used over Stone Edge, allowing Flygon to revenge kill weakened boosted and faster threats like Drednaw and Choice Scarf Munkidori. Tera Steel gives Flygon a resistance to Fairy- and Dragon-type attacks from Pokemon like Sylveon, Florges, and opposing Flygon. This also allows it to check some special wallbreakers like Meloetta, Dragalge, and Porygon-Z.</p> <p>Wallbreakers like Chandelure, Mienshao, and Breloom appreciate Choice Scarf Flygon for giving them free entry with U-turn. Flygon can form a VoltTurn core with special attackers like Kilowattrel, Rotom-C, and Toxtricity. They can threaten physical walls like Vaporeon, Avalugg, and Vileplume; in return, Flygon can pressure special walls like Alolan Muk and Copperajah. Choice Scarf Flygon struggles to break past bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Swampert, and Quagsire, which tank its attacks and punish it with Scald, Knock Off, a slow Flip Turn, and Toxic. Grass-types like Brambleghast, Brute Bonnet, and Vileplume similarly appreciate Flygon's U-turn giving them free entry to handle the aforementioned bulky Water-types. Steel-types like Copperajah, Registeel, and Bronzong appreciate Flygon for checking Fire-types like Chandelure, Infernape, and Incineroar; in return, they can check Fairy-types like Sylveon, Florges, and Diancie. Choice Scarf Flygon appreciates entry hazard support from Copperajah, Diancie, and Swampert, as it can wear down foes to help with Choice Scarf Flygon's low damage output.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band gives Flygon more immediate power, allowing it to always 2HKO Vileplume and Quagsire after Spikes damage with Earthquake. Outrage is still an option to allow Flygon to 2HKO Vaporeon and Quagsire, but Scale Shot is preferred so Flygon isn't easily revenge killed by Fairy-types, and it makes Flygon harder to revenge kill overall. First Impression revenge kills weakened foes like Porygon-Z, Munkidori, and Torterra. Alternatively, Throat Chop provides coverage for Bronzong and shuts down Hyper Voice Sylveon, whereas Stone Edge pops Talonflame on the switch. Tera Bug gives First Impression a power boost, allowing Flygon to KO Mew and do major damage to defensive Reuniclus. Tera Steel can sometimes be preferred over Tera Bug, since it's better defensively and allows Flygon to pivot without getting chipped heavily by Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Choice Band Flygon likes having entry hazard support from teammates like Klefki, Copperajah, and Diancie to wear down foes that can repeatedly switch into it. Many Pokemon that tend to struggle against bulky Water-types like Vaporeon and Milotic, such as Registeel, Infernape, and Basculegion, appreciate Choice Band Flygon's ability to 2HKO them on the switch. However, while it can 2HKO most bulky Water-types, it can't always beat them one-on-one, so it pairs well with Grass-types like Tsareena, Brambleghast, and Vileplume. Physically defensive Pokemon like Avalugg, Weezing, and Orthworm can take Flygon's attacks with ease, so it pairs best with Pokemon like Kilowattrel, Munkidori, and Chandelure that can handle these physical walls. Future Sight Galarian Articuno can be a great partner for Choice Band Flygon, allowing it to weaken physical walls like Milotic, Avalugg, and Vileplume.</p>"

      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Dragon Dance with a Scale Shot boost allows Flygon to outspeed the entire tier, including common Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Infernape. Dropping Scale Shot for Outrage is acceptable to run a different item, but this makes Flygon significantly more reliant on obtaining multiple Dragon Dance boosts to avoid being revenge killed. Substitute allows Flygon to take advantage of switches and passive Pokemon, giving it more turns to set up. With Tera Steel, Flygon can also exploit Pokemon like Vileplume and Brave Bird Talonflame for easier setup. Fire Punch allows Flygon to hit Grass-types like Tsareena, Vileplume, and Brute Bonnet, as well as Steel-types like Bronzong, Orthworm, and Tera Steel Flygon. Alternatively, Throat Chop lets Flygon target Bronzong, and it blocks Sylveon from using Hyper Voice. Tera Steel allows it to be immune to Umbreon and Quagsire's Toxic. Tera Fire gives Fire Punch a much-needed power boost and retains the resistance to Fairy-type attacks that Tera Steel gives. If running Substitute, an alternate EV spread of 32 HP / 224 Atk / 252 Spe can be run to avoid Tera Steel Flygon's Substitute from being broken by Talonflame's Brave Bird.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Flygon appreciates entry hazard support from Klefki and Swampert to guarantee a 2HKO on Pokemon like Vileplume and Vaporeon. Toxic Spikes in particular is helpful, since it makes it a lot easier to break through physical walls like Quagsire and Swampert that would usually tank many hits from a Dragon Dance boost. Flygon is a perfect pick for hyper offense teams due to its Sticky Web immunity and because it can sweep opposing hyper offense teams. It can also punish lead hazard setters like Galvantula and Smeargle by setting up a Dragon Dance and breaking their Focus Sashes with Scale Shot. Other sweepers like Breloom, Drednaw, and Mienshao appreciate Dragon Dance Flygon's ability to weaken teams so they can win late-game. Choice Scarf users like Mienshao, Munkidori, and Infernape can force Flygon to switch out even if it's at +1 because they can still outspeed it. Thus, slow pivots like Toxtricity, Swampert, and Flip Turn Vaporeon can help by bringing Flygon in safely.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Milotic stands out from the other bulky Water-types thanks to its access to reliable recovery and solid mixed bulk. It checks many common threats like Flygon, Incineroar, and Chandelure. Milotic's access to Recover means that it can run other moves on its set, giving it a huge advantage over Vaporeon, which usually sacrifices two slots for Wish and Protect. However, Milotic can struggle against powerful wallbreakers like Flamigo, Porygon-Z, and Flygon, as they can overwhelm it and force it to immediately heal. Additionally, Milotic can be forced to Terastallize by Pokemon like Alolan Muk and Galarian Slowbro that threaten it with poison, which otherwise forces it to constantly heal. While Milotic can handle many physical and special attackers, it can be easily overwhelmed by repeatedly switching into foes that it checks like Chandelure and Flygon or a powerful attack.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Milotic can run Tera Steel, giving it an immunity to Poison-type moves and letting it check foes like Munkidori and Porygon-Z, but the Steel typing makes Milotic weak to Ground- and Fire-type attacks from foes like Flygon and Chandelure.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Kilowattrel, Toxtricity, and Raikou easily destroy Milotic with their STAB attacks and the latter two can use it as setup fodder, but none of them enjoy switching into either Scald or Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Brambleghast, Decidueye, and Breloom can easily destroy Milotic with their powerful attacks and the latter two can use it as setup fodder.

      "Defensive Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Ice Beam allows Milotic to threaten Grass- and Dragon-types like Brambleghast, Breloom, Amoonguss, and Goodra. Haze helps it prevent setup sweepers like Swords Dance Overqwil and Dragon-immune ones such as Calm Mind Scream Tail as well as Tera Fairy Uxie from snowballing, while Dragon Tail lets Milotic phaze sweepers and walls like Toxicroak, Taunt Oricorio-P, and Gastrodon. Milotic can run Alluring Voice, letting it threaten foes that often boost their stats like Paldean Tauros-W and Flygon with confusion. Heavy-Duty Boots prevent Milotic from getting worn down by entry hazards, while Leftovers gives it a bit more recovery. Rocky Helmet can be used over Heavy-Duty Boots, as it can punish any physical contact with chip damage. Marvel Scale can be useful if Milotic gets statused, whereas Competitive lets it take advantage of Intimidate users like Overqwil and Incineroar as well as Defoggers such as Altaria and Cramorant. Milotic can run a mixed defensive EV spread, allowing it to survive a Swords Dance-boosted Adamant Incineroar's Knock Off while letting it check special wallbreakers like Hisuian Typhlosion, Chandelure, and Inteleon reliably. Tera Poison gives Milotic a useful immunity to poison from Alolan Muk and Overqwil while providing it with a useful resistance to Fighting- and Grass-type attacks, helping it against Paldean Tauros-W, Infernape, and Decidueye. Alternatively, Tera Fairy provides it with an overall better defensive typing that doesn’t give it a Ground-type weakness, which helps against Flygon and better handle Fighting-types like Flamigo and Paldean Tauros-W. Lastly, Tera Dragon still gives it the Grass-type resistance while giving it the ability to check Pokemon like Inteleon, Chandelure, and Toxtricity.</p> <p>Milotic can form a strong VoltTurn core with other pivot users like Flygon, Flamigo, Kilowattrel, and Toxtricity, as they can enter the field safely thanks to Milotic's slow Flip Turn and chip foes like Swampert and Overqwil. Grass-types like Brambleghast, Breloom, and Decidueye can force Milotic to switch out or use up Terastallization, so it best partners with Fire- and Poison-types like Incineroar, Chandelure, and Galarian Slowbro to check them. Physical attackers like Flygon, Infernape, and Breloom appreciate Milotic variants that run Competitive to take advantage of Intimidate users like Incineroar and Overqwil. Non-Heavy-Duty Boots Milotic variants can be worn down by entry hazards; thus it partners well with hazard removers like Brambleghast, Scyther, and Cinccino. Milotic best synergizes with defensive Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro, Gligar, Bronzong, and Amoonguss, as they can handle foes like Toxicroak, Breloom, Alolan Ninetales, and Alolan Muk. In return, Milotic handles threats like Flygon, Chandelure, and Incineroar. Milotic pairs well with teammates like Toxicroak, Decidueye, and Toxtricity to help it deal with Water-immune and -resistant foes like Vaporeon, Gastrodon, and opposing Milotic.</p>"

  "Torterra": {
    "overview": "<p>Torterra excels as a setup sweeper on hyper offense teams, using Shell Smash to boost its stats and power through foes. Torterra has all the coverage it needs with Rock Blast, as it hits Flying-types like Talonflame and Kilowattrel that might otherwise threaten to wall and KO Torterra. It can also work around some of its checks with Tera Blast, improving its matchup into Grass-types like Vileplume and Tsareena. Torterra's high base Defense and solid defensive typing provide it ample opportunities to set up against foes like Basculegion and Swampert. While Torterra can somewhat choose its checks with Rock Blast and Tera Blast Fire, it cannot run both, and as a result can be checked by Grass-types like Vileplume and Tsareena or by Flying-types like Talonflame. Furthermore, Torterra's low base Speed makes it vulnerable to being outsped and revenge killed by Choice Scarf users like Munkidori, Flygon, and Mienshao, even after a Shell Smash boost, meaning it often requires Sticky Web support. Priority, such as Flygon's First Impression and Toxicroak's Sucker Punch, can also end a potential sweep, as Torterra often lowers its Defense with Shell Smash and Headlong Rush.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>On non-Loaded Dice sets, Torterra can choose Stone Edge as an alternative to Tera Blast for coverage that does not require Tera, but accuracy can become a problem. Torterra can also run moves like Zen Headbutt and Crunch to hit specific targets like Vileplume and Bronzong without Terastallizing; however, they are fairly niche or outclassed by other options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Torterra's STAB moves cannot hit Grass-types, such as Tsareena, Vileplume, and Brambleghast, so it is forced to rely on Tera Blast Fire to hit them, which some sets may not carry.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types like Talonflame, Kilowattrel, and Tornadus don't fear Torterra's STAB moves, and even when Torterra carries coverage like Rock Blast, it can be inaccurate. These foes also outspeed unboosted Torterra, and Talonflame in particular may burn it if it predicts that Torterra will not Terastallize Fire.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Torterra's low Speed makes it vulnerable to being revenge killed by Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Munkidori, as well as priority like Toxicroak's Sucker Punch and Flygon's First Impression. Flygon in particular is dangerous, as its Choice Scarf set cannot be slowed by Sticky Web due to Levitate, and it frequently uses Tera Steel.</p>",

      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Bullet Seed is a powerful STAB move but requires Loaded Dice to be effective, while Wood Hammer provides immediate power without requiring an item slot but forces Torterra to take recoil. Earthquake is a strong move without a drawback, but Headlong Rush provides even more power, with the downside of defensive stat drops. Rock Blast, like Bullet Seed, requires Loaded Dice to be effective, but it provides necessary coverage against Flying-types like Talonflame and Kilowattrel. Tera Ghost can be used defensively, removing Torterra's existing weaknesses and adding an immunity to Fighting-type attacks, which can be useful against revenge killers like Mach Punch Breloom and Choice Scarf Mienshao. Tera Blast Fire can OHKO defensive Grass-types like Tsareena and Vileplume. Tera Fire also prevents Torterra from being burned. Since Flying-types like Talonflame, Tornadus, and Kilowattrel naturally outspeed Torterra and deal great damage with their STAB moves, Torterra may want to opt for Tera Electric, giving it a resistance to their Flying-type STAB moves and maintaining its immunity to Thunder Wave. If not using Loaded Dice along with Bullet Seed and Rock Blast, Torterra can utilize White Herb to restore its defenses after Shell Smash, making it a more reliable setup sweeper. While a Jolly nature lets Torterra outspeed foes such as Choice Scarf Chandelure and Heracross, Adamant can be run on Sticky Web teams for more power.</p> <p>Torterra's low Speed makes it vulnerable to being revenge killed by Choice Scarf users like Mienshao, Munkidori, and Inteleon, so Sticky Web users like Araquanid and Galvantula support it well. Choice Scarf Flygon has Levitate to be immune to Sticky Web, so faster Choice Scarf users like Munkidori and Mienshao can help Torterra handle it. Additional physical breakers can weaken Torterra's checks and finish them off after Torterra is stopped, so teammates like Swords Dance Toxicroak and Dragon Dance Flygon and Iron Thorns pair well with it; the first handles Grass-types, the second and third can weaken them for Torterra, and the last can also handle Flying-types like Talonflame and Kilowattrel. Teammates such as Chandelure and Tornadus that can target Grass-types like Vileplume and Tsareena are also appreciated, weakening or outright removing these checks to Torterra. Fire-types like Chandelure, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Incineroar appreciate Torterra's support against Water- and Ground-types like Swampert and Flygon.</p>"

  "Gastrodon": {
    "overview": "<p>Gastrodon is a standout defensive option for its excellent bulk, reliable recovery, and plentiful resistances to complement its sole Grass weakness. An Electric immunity means Gastrodon excels at grabbing momentum back from Volt Switch users like Kilowattrel and Toxtricity, enabling it to set up entry hazards. Similarly, Gastrodon has Storm Drain to check Inteleon and deny Flip Turn users like Basculegion-M, Vaporeon, and Milotic, though Sticky Hold is another great choice for a defensive ability by granting Gastrodon rare utility as an absorber of Knock Off and Trick. Such a robust defensive profile makes Gastrodon an excellent hazard setter, and it boasts access to both Stealth Rock and Spikes. That said, Gastrodon's 4x Grass weakness is a major Achilles heel, leaving it wide open to being taken advantage of by Grass-types like Amoonguss, Decidueye, and Tsareena. Gastrodon's lower Defense is another shortcoming, leaving physical attackers like Toxicroak, Paldean Tauros-W, and Flygon capable of breaking through it. Not only does Gastrodon hardly deter Bronzong from taking advantage of it, but its passivity means other Calm Mind sweepers like Scream Tail and Uxie can use it as setup fodder.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A physically defensive EV spread can be used to make Gastrodon a better wall against physical attackers, including Incineroar, Toxicroak, Overqwil, and Paldean Tauros-W. Earthquake is more threatening to specially bulkier Pokemon like Alolan Muk, Munkidori, and Tentacruel. Tera Dragon helps Gastrodon check Grass-types like Decidueye, Electric-types like Kilowattrel, Fire-types like Chandelure, and Water-types like Inteleon and Basculegion-M all at once. Additionally, it improves Sticky Hold Gastrodon's matchup against Water-types that it would otherwise struggle against without Storm Drain.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon and Coverage Moves</strong>: Breloom, Brambleghast, and Amoonguss can come in on Gastrodon and exploit its 4x Grass weakness to beat it or scare it out. However, they should be wary of switching into its coverage moves. Chandelure threatens Gastrodon with Energy Ball, though it does not switch into Earth Power or Surf comfortably. Scyther can use Trailblaze to both set up on Gastrodon and potentially OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Lower Defense means Gastrodon poorly answers foes like Toxicroak, Heracross, and Choice Band Flygon. If it lacks Storm Drain, Water-types like Basculegion and Paldean Tauros-W can much more effectively run through Gastrodon.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Gastrodon is much less effective as a defensive Pokemon when afflicted by status, often forcing it to become more passive by using Recover more often. Munkidori's Toxic Chain can passively inflict Gastrodon with this status just by using U-turn, Goodra has the bulk to stomach Ice Beam from Gastrodon and status it, and Bellibolt and Gligar can use Toxic on Gastrodon as it switches in.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Ice Beam prevents Ground-immune Pokemon from taking advantage of Gastrodon and particularly threatens Ice-weak Pokemon like Flygon, Kilowattrel, and Grass-types. Sludge Bomb is another anti-Grass-type coverage move with perks such as letting Gastrodon fish for poison and doing more damage to Sylveon, Scream Tail, and Tera Fairy users like Bronzong and Incineroar. Surf hits Bronzong and Rotom-H, and its decent power with STAB still prevents Ground-immune Pokemon from totally exploiting Gastrodon. However, it weakens Gastrodon's matchups against Grass-types and freely invites them in. Heavy-Duty Boots protects Gastrodon from being worn down by entry hazards. The Water immunity granted by Storm Drain makes Gastrodon an even more effective answer to Inteleon, helps it take advantage of Choice item Paldean Tauros-W and Basculegion-M, and slows the momentum otherwise gained by Flip Turn users like Swampert, Milotic, and Vaporeon. Sticky Hold is an alternative to deny item disruption from Knock Off users like Incineroar, Gligar, and Alolan Muk. Covert Cloak is best run on Sticky Hold sets so that Gastrodon can effectively counter Alolan Muk. Sticky Hold Gastrodon can run an EV spread of 252 HP / 180 Def / 76 SpD to make Alolan Muk's Knock Off a 4HKO instead of a 3HKO or 2HKO. Tera Ghost lets Gastrodon act as effective spinblocker for itself and more comfortably answer Toxicroak, Toxtricity's Boomburst, and Cinccino. Tera Fairy makes Gastrodon a decent answer to Fighting-types like Flamigo and an especially good check to Paldean Tauros-W, though this worsens Gastrodon's matchup against Toxicroak. Tera Poison flips Gastrodon's 4x Grass weakness, grants it an immunity to poison, and enables it to answer Fighting- and Poison-types like Toxicroak and Amoonguss.</p> <p>Bronzong is a superb partner to Gastrodon, handling Grass-types and enabling Gastrodon to run Spikes if it runs Stealth Rock. Gastrodon matches Bronzong by intercepting Fire-types like Hisuian Typhlosion, absorbing Knock Off if it has Sticky Hold, and checking special attackers like Kilowattrel and Toxtricity that could wear down Bronzong. Orthworm is similar to Bronzong, but it can check physical attackers like Flygon and Cinccino for Gastrodon. Alolan Muk and Incineroar can both check Grass-types for Gastrodon, and they both have Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots and maximize the reach of Gastrodon's entry hazards. Pokemon like Chandelure and Diancie value Storm Drain Gastrodon's ability to answer Water-types; Chandelure can return the favor by checking Grass-types, while Diancie's access to Stealth Rock lets Gastrodon create a hazard-stacking core with it. Avalugg's physical bulk pairs nicely with Gastrodon's role as a special wall. Other checks to Grass-types like Registeel, Galarian Slowbro, and Overqwil also stand out for covering Gastrodon's most significant weakness. Wallbreakers like Flamigo, Choice Band Flygon, and Porygon-Z thrive from the passive damage Gastrodon spreads with its entry hazards. Scyther is a significant partner thanks to its potential to check Grass-types and capitalize on Gastrodon's entry hazards, while Gastrodon checks Fire-, Steel-, and Water-types in return. Gastrodon's Sticky Hold making it an effective Knock Off absorber is appreciated by Pokemon that depend on their items, including Avalugg, Gligar, and Bronzong.</p>"

Bronzong is remarkably resistant to entry hazards, as it simultaneously resists Stealth Rock and has an immunity to Spikes, making it a centerpiece on teams with little to no hazard removal. Furthermore, Bronzong excels at being a great hazard setter thanks to its ability to check threats like Munkidori, Sylveon, and Porygon-Z. It can take advantage of these positive matchups and its already tremendous bulk by instead being a bulky setup sweeper, becoming very difficult to take out. However, Bronzong's only form of recovery is Leftovers, meaning that it has to be even more wary about switching into the already threatening Knock Off from Pokemon that it would check otherwise like Copperajah, Tsareena, and Toxicroak. Additionally, foes that Bronzong is typically expected to check like Munkidori, Florges, and Rotom-C often run Trick to cripple it severely and especially hurt its setup sets.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bronzong can opt to run a fully physically defensive EV spread, letting it handle physical wallbreakers like Flygon, Staraptor, and Breloom a bit better, but this makes it worse against Pokemon like Kilowattrel, Inteleon, and Munkidori. Heatproof allows Bronzong to handle Pokemon that carry Fire-type coverage like Fire Punch Flygon and Flamethrower Galarian Slowbro, but the Ground immunity from Levitate is almost always superior. Future Sight lets it limit switch-ins for wallbreakers like Flygon, Breloom, and Paldean Tauros-W. Gyro Ball lets Bronzong hit faster opponents like Mienshao, Tornadus, and Flygon much harder. Protect can be used on utility sets, providing Bronzong a bit more Leftovers recovery and letting it scout out Choice item users like Flygon and Munkidori; however, it struggles to fit it because it prefers to run other utility moves. Trick alongside Toxic Orb allows Bronzong to cripple defensive tanks like Incineroar, Cresselia, and Vaporeon. Colbur Berry lets Bronzong tank Dark-type attacks like Dark Pulse from Inteleon and Knock Off from Tsareena, but it prefers Leftovers for gaining extra recovery.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types and Dark-type Coverage</strong>: Incineroar, Alolan Muk, Overqwil, and Scrafty can tank Bronzong’s attacks very well and threaten it back with their STAB attacks.

Heavy Slam allows Bronzong to hit Fairy-types like Sylveon, Florges, and Diancie. Night Shade can be used over Heavy Slam, allowing Bronzong to make solid progress against Ghost- and Dark-types like Chandelure, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Alolan Muk. Optionally, Bronzong can invest 164 Defense EVs in order to 2HKO offensive Incineroar with Body Press while better taking hits from physical attackers like Flygon.

Stored Power lets it more easily break through Fighting-resistant and -immune Pokemon that try to switch in like Sylveon, Vileplume, and Decidueye, while the scaling power from both Bronzong's boosted offenses and defenses helps it break past opposing Calm Mind setup from the likes of Sylveon, Florges, and Galarian Slowbro. The EV spread allows Bronzong to outspeed Gastrodon so that when Bronzong Terastallizes, it can attack before being hit by a Clear Smog while giving it enough special bulk to tank many hits. Tera Fairy gives it a resistance to Fighting-, Dark-, and Dragon-type attacks from Heracross, Scrafty, and Flygon. However, Tera Water lets it better handle foes like Inteleon, Chandelure, and Hisuian Typhlosion. Tera Poison could also be used, as it allows Bronzong to check Fighting- and Poison-types like Mienshao, Toxicroak, and Alolan Muk, and it maintains Bronzong's immunity to both Toxic and the latter's Poison Touch.</p> <p>Wish passers like Vaporeon and Sylveon appreciate Bronzong for checking threats like Munkidori, Kilowattrel, and Porygon-Z.

Fighting- and Fairy-types like Mienshao, Paldean Tauros-F, Florges, and Diancie are great partners for Bronzong, as they can handle Dark-types like Incineroar and Scrafty, and the last three are good Knock Off absorbers; in return, Bronzong checks and can capitalize on bulky Poison-types like Galarian Slowbro, Vileplume, and Dragalge. Bronzong partners well with Dark-types like Incineroar, Alolan Muk, and Overqwil, as they can check Ghost-types such as Chandelure, Decidueye, and Brambleghast and bulky Psychic-types like Uxie and opposing Bronzong that it can struggle with. Fire-types like Hisuian Typhlosion, Rotom-H, and Incineroar can force Bronzong to switch out, so it best pairs with bulky Water- and Dragon-types like Vaporeon, Milotic, and Goodra to check them.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Toxicroak stands out for having the rare combination of Dry Skin and a great typing both offensively and defensively, which makes it the premier switch-in to Water-types like Vaporeon, Milotic, Paldean Tauros-W, Basculegion, and Inteleon. Toxicroak is also less susceptible to being revenge killed after it has set up; its access to priority moves makes it a lot harder to revenge kill despite its middling Speed. However, Toxicroak's biggest problem is its frailty; if it switches into any non-Water-type attack from these threats, it gets easily 2HKOed, but Toxicroak's good defensive typing gives it more opportunities to set up against foes like Vileplume, Choice Scarf Mienshao, and Tsareena. Toxicroak also struggles against physically defensive Ground- and Poison-types like Palossand, Galarian Slowbro, and Dragalge, as they can take both of its STAB attacks and proceed to threaten Toxicroak back with their own STAB moves. Additionally, Toxicroak also faces Fighting-type competition with Mienshao and Breloom, which are both stronger, making them more consistent at times.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf Toxicroak can outspeed common threats like Chandelure, Infernape, and Flygon. However, its moves are quite exploitable if it's locked into them, as Pokemon that resist or are immune to its attacks are common. Air Balloon gives Toxicroak a useful immunity to Ground-type attacks, giving it more opportunities to set up. Alternatively, Shuca Berry lets Toxicroak better lure in and damage Flygon and Swampert, as it's discreet; however, the majority of the time, Toxicroak prefers to run other items. Ice Punch allows Toxicroak to hit Ground- and Dragon-types like Gligar, Flygon, and Dragalge, but Toxicroak struggles to fit it. Encore allows Toxicroak to take advantage of bulky setup sweepers and entry hazard leads like Cresselia, Swampert, and Sylveon by giving it a free opportunity to set up either Swords Dance or Nasty Plot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Flygon, Swampert, and Gastrodon threaten Toxicroak with their STAB Ground-type attacks, but none of them want to switch into a boosted Close Combat or Focus Blast. Quagsire can shut down Toxicroak's sweeping attempts with Unaware and destroy it with a STAB Earthquake. However, Quagsire fares a bit worse against Nasty Plot Toxicroak. Gligar resists both of Toxicroak's STAB attacks and uses it to set up entry hazards or hits it back with Earthquake. Palossand is especially noteworthy, though, as it blanks Fighting-type attacks, resists Poison-type moves, and doesn't take too much from Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Galarian Slowbro and Dragalge resist both of Toxicroak's STAB attacks, and they can either set up or hit it back with their own STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Munkidori and Meloetta destroy Toxicroak with their powerful STAB attacks. However, none of them want to switch into a boosted Dark Pulse, and they can also be picked off by Sucker Punch. Indeedee-M will always win in a one-on-one against Toxicroak due to Psychic Terrain, but it can't switch in.</p>",

Alternatively, Drain Punch helps provide more longevity against foes like Alolan Muk and Swampert, and it can counteract Life Orb chip if needed. Sucker Punch helps Toxicroak pick off revenge killers and weakened threats alike such as Munkidori and Flygon; Tera Dark allows Toxicroak to OHKO foes like Inteleon and Kilowattrel after a Swords Dance boost. Both Knock Off and Earthquake can be run in the last moveslot to hit checks like Palossand, Galarian Slowbro, and Dragalge harder, but Toxicroak's low Speed makes it prefer a priority move in most situations. A Jolly nature lets Toxicroak outspeed foes like Heracross and Chandelure, but an Adamant nature provides more wallbreaking power, allowing Toxicroak to OHKO Vileplume with a +2 Gunk Shot when it's boosted by Life Orb. Leftovers is the preferred item for Toxicroak, providing it needed recovery and letting it continually come in and check bulky Water-types. However, Life Orb provides Toxicroak a bit more extra wallbreaking power.</p> <p>Toxicroak best pairs with Pokemon that lure in bulkier Water-types such as Vaporeon and Milotic, so good partners would be Water-types like Inteleon and Basculegion and Fire-types like Incineroar and Talonflame, as all of them are able to pivot and give it a free switch into the aforementioned bulky Water-types. Inteleon is a noteworthy partner, as it checks the common Ground- and Fire-types like Flygon, Gligar, and Chandelure, and it can actually pivot on Water-immune Pokemon thanks to its access to U-turn, helping Inteleon keep up momentum. In return, Toxicroak can take advantage of bulky Water- and Grass-types such as Vaporeon, Tentacruel, and Tsareena. Toxicroak gets threatened by Psychic-types such as Indeedee-M, Meloetta, and Munkidori, so it pairs well with Dark- and Steel-types like Umbreon, Incineroar, and Bronzong that check the aforementioned Psychic-types. Poison-types like Dragalge and Galarian Slowbro can cause many problems for Toxicroak, making Psychic- and Ground-types like Meloetta, Flygon, and Swampert great partners. Ground-immune Pokemon like Talonflame, Rotom-C, and Bronzong are great partners for Toxicroak, as they are able to check Ground-types such as Flygon and Swampert. Toxicroak also appreciates Water- and Rock-types like Vaporeon, Swampert, and Diancie to consistently switch into Fire-types like Chandelure, Infernape, and Hisuian Typhlosion.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Dark Pulse hits Psychic- and Ghost-types like Galarian Slowbro, Chandelure, and Basculegion that would resist or be immune to its STAB attacks. Vacuum Wave can be used over Dark Pulse, allowing Toxicroak to KO revenge killers like Porygon-Z, Flygon, and Inteleon. A Timid nature allows Toxicroak to outspeed foes like non-Choice Scarf Chandelure and Basculegion, but a Modest nature allows it to OHKO foes like Swampert with a +2 Focus Blast. Life Orb is preferred for its immediate power, allowing Toxicroak to always 2HKO foes like Swampert and Sylveon, but Leftovers can provide Toxicroak needed recovery over the course of the battle. Tera Dark boosts the power of Dark Pulse while giving Toxicroak an immunity to Psychic-type attacks from Meloetta and Munkidori. Tera Fighting gives both Toxicroak's Focus Blast and Vacuum Wave an extra power boost, allowing it to 2HKO foes like Alolan Muk, Registeel, and Diancie and pick foes off from higher health.</p> <p>Toxicroak pairs well with pivots like Inteleon, Flygon, and Incineroar, as they can bring in foes like Vaporeon, Vileplume, and Alolan Muk and give Toxicroak a free opportunity to set up. Faster Pokemon like Talonflame, Flygon, and Munkidori outspeed and destroy Toxicroak. Thus, it pairs with defensive walls like Vaporeon, Tsareena, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro to handle the aforementioned Pokemon. Toxicroak synergies best with Steel- and Dark-types like Bronzong, Umbreon, and Incineroar, as they can check Psychic-types such as Munkidori, Indeedee-M, and Meloetta. In return, Toxicroak can pressure and take advantage of the Fighting- and Fairy-types like Sylveon, Florges, and Mienshao that give these Pokemon trouble. Ground-types like Flygon, Swampert, and Palossand can tank Toxicroak's unboosted attacks and OHKO it with their Ground-type STAB moves. Therefore, Toxicroak partners well with bulky Water- and Grass-types like Vaporeon, Tsareena, and Vileplume, as they can check the aforementioned Ground-types.</p>"

Adaptability also adds on to its already insane power, letting it 2HKO common special walls like Incineroar and, after Stealth Rock, Alolan Muk as well. Download can turn common physical walls like Galarian Slowbro, Scream Tail, and Vaporeon into switch-in opportunities, though. On top of that, Porygon-Z only requires Shadow Ball the majority of the time as a coverage option to complement its STAB move, freeing up its other moveslots. Since Porygon-Z has access to Trick, it isn't completely stonewalled by special walls like Registeel, Bronzong, and Diancie that well either; it can capitalize on them being locked into a status move with one of either Nasty Plot, Agility, or Recover, and because they now lack their only form of recovery in Leftovers, chipping them over time will be quite easy. Porygon-Z's frailty is quite apparent in battle, though, forcing it to rely on pivots to switch in safely. Common fast Pokemon like Munkidori, Flygon, Kilowattrel, and Inteleon can take advantage of its somewhat middling Speed tier as well, threatening to KO or force it out.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Porygon-Z can run Choice Scarf to become a revenge killer and cleaner, but most common Choice Scarf users like Flygon, Munkidori, and Infernape outspeed and threaten it with a KO. Porygon-Z can opt for Silk Scarf on Nasty Plot sets for extra damage on Tri Attack and its pre-Terastallization Tera Blast, boosting its ability to wallbreak. Porygon-Z can take advantage of Sitrus Berry really well with Nasty Plot and especially Double Dance sets, and it can even forego a fully offensive EV spread in favor of a more defensive one so that it can pull off both an Agility and a Nasty Plot easily. Thunderbolt and Ice Beam can be run on Choice Specs sets. However, the utility of its last two moveslots is more useful overall. Choice Specs sets can also use Hyper Beam as a sort of nuke button that's able to chip away at Steel- and Rock-types heavily, but this leaves it wide open the next turn. Porygon-Z can opt to run Tera Fairy over Tera Ghost so that it can resist Scrappy Flamigo's Close Combat. However, this makes it noticeably worse against other Fighting-types like Toxicroak and the Paldean Tauros formes.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Pokemon like Copperajah, Klefki, Registeel, and Bronzong can all switch in on Porygon-Z quite freely, and they can all take advantage of it by setting up entry hazards. On top of that, the latter two can use it as a setup opportunity, and Klefki and Registeel can cripple it with Thunder Wave. However, the former three must watch out for Tera Blast Ground, and Bronzong must be cautious about switching into a Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Hisuian Typhlosion and both Choice Scarf Chandelure and Basculegion-M outspeed Porygon-Z and can capitalize on its use of Tri Attack, as they are immune and can retaliate with high-Base Power attacks, which are further bolstered by their high offenses. Brambleghast can also do the same, but it risks losing a Speed tie, and all Ghost-types need to be cautious about possibly switching into a Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Porygon-Z's middling Speed and frailty can be taken advantage of by quite a few Pokemon faster than it like Flygon, Paldean Tauros-W, Kilowattrel, and Munkidori. Notably, Choice Scarf Flamigo outspeeds non-Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, and since Flamigo runs Scrappy, it doesn't fear using Close Combat against a possible Tera Ghost Porygon-Z either. On top of that, priority moves can easily KO it, if not after a bit of chip damage beforehand, so it must be cautious with Breloom's Mach Punch, Basculegion-M's Aqua Jet, and Toxicroak's Sucker Punch.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Tri Attack gives Porygon-Z a reliable STAB move that it can use even after Terastallizing, but Tera Blast can be used instead, alongside Tera Ground, to have a way to hit common switch-ins super effectively, like Registeel, Klefki, and Diancie. Shadow Ball allows Porygon-Z to hit Ghost-types like Brambleghast, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Chandelure that are immune to its Tri Attack, and it hits Bronzong, a common switch-in. Trick allows Porygon-Z to cripple defensive switch-ins like Bronzong, Diancie, and Alolan Muk. Since Porygon-Z has all the coverage it needs from its first two attacks, it runs more situational moves for its last moveslot to choose how to take advantage of Trick and free turns. Nasty Plot allows it to still break through walls like Incineroar, Alolan Muk, and Bronzong; Agility lets it become a late-game sweeper after it has already worn down opposing walls; and Recover lets it wallbreak repeatedly, letting it not worry as much about both chip and entry hazard damage. Tera Ghost turns Porygon-Z's weakness to Fighting into an immunity, meaning it can get free turns to attack against Body Press Bronzong and Paldean Tauros formes, while boosting Shadow Ball. Adaptability is Porygon-Z's preferred ability, as it allows Porygon-Z to reliably break through even special walls like Alolan Muk, Incineroar, and Diancie. On the other hand, Download can be used to take advantage of common physical walls like Milotic, Sylveon, and Galarian Slowbro better.</p> <p>Since Porygon-Z easily draws in and chips Rock- and Steel-types, partners that can take advantage of this like Kilowattrel, Munkidori, Nasty Plot Uxie, and Trick Room Diancie synergize well. Especially if Porygon-Z is using Download, it appreciates pivots like Flygon, Flamigo, and Gligar, since they bring it in on physical walls like Amoonguss, Galarian Slowbro, and Swampert, which it can threaten out. The former two pivots, along with Basculegion-M, are also great partners for creating a wallbreaking core with Porygon-Z, handling the Steel- and Rock-types like Registeel and Diancie that can check it. Porygon-Z can achieve many 2HKOs, but the majority of them require some chip damage beforehand; because of this, entry hazard setters like Klefki, Bronzong, and Swampert make for good partners. Additionally, Porygon-Z is forced out by Fighting-types like Flamigo, Breloom, and the Paldean Tauros formes, so switch-ins such as Sylveon, Amoonguss, Galarian Slowbro, and Dragalge make for good teammates. If Porygon-Z locks into Tri Attack and a Ghost-type comes in, it appreciates a check to bring in like Incineroar, Overqwil, and Alolan Muk.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Agility allows Porygon-Z to capitalize on its supreme Special Attack, boosting its Speed and letting it clean teams, especially more offensive ones, with Life Orb-boosted attacks. Tri Attack offers Porygon-Z a reliable STAB attack that it can use even after Terastallizing, but Tera Blast can be used instead, alongside Tera Ground, to have a way to hit common switch-ins super effectively like Registeel, Copperajah, and Diancie while having an equally powerful STAB move beforehand. Shadow Ball allows Porygon-Z to hit Ghost-types like Decidueye, Basculegion-M, and Chandelure that are immune to its Tri Attack. Thunderbolt hits Rock- and Steel-types that Porygon-Z struggles with, is a strong neutral move against most of the tier, and can clear Water-types like Milotic and Vaporeon easily. Nasty Plot can be used over Agility if Porygon-Z aims to solely break through bulkier teams; however, using it over Thunderbolt allows Porygon-Z to decide which setup move is more rewarding depending on the situation. If Porygon-Z is running Nasty Plot over Agility, Recover can be used instead of Thunderbolt to improve its matchup against balance and bulkier builds. Life Orb provides more wallbreaking power at the cost of constant chip damage, letting it achieve OHKOs on Sylveon and Dragalge with Tri Attack after Stealth Rock at +2, and it gives Porygon-Z a high chance of OHKOing Bronzong with Shadow Ball and Incineroar as well as Alolan Muk with Tri Attack. However, Leftovers provides passive recovery for Porygon-Z, letting it both attack and set up more. Heavy-Duty Boots could also be used, since it lets Porygon-Z ignore crippling entry hazards like Sticky Web and Spikes. Download is preferred, as it can boost Porygon-Z's Special Attack, providing it with a damage boost that it can take advantage of with Agility. Additionally, for Double Dance sets, it means Porygon-Z isn't always forced to use Nasty Plot. On the other hand, Adaptability could be used to increase its reliability at weakening specially defensive Steel- and Rock-types like Copperajah, Registeel, and Diancie. Tera Ghost boosts Shadow Ball while turning Porygon-Z's Fighting weakness into an immunity, which gives it a free turn to setup against or attack Paldean Tauros formes and Body Press Bronzong. On the other hand, Tera Electric lets Porygon-Z hit Steel-types with a powerful neutral STAB Thunderbolt, gives it an immunity to Porygon2's as well as Klefki's Thunder Wave, and allows Porygon-Z to turn Kilowattrel into setup fodder.</p> <p>Porygon-Z has issues with KOing Steel- and Rock-types like Copperajah, Registeel, and Diancie one-on-one, so leads that set entry hazards like Froslass and Brambleghast or other Pokemon that do the same like Klefki, Gligar, and Swampert make for great teammates. Pokemon like Munkidori, Trick Room Diancie, Booster Energy Calm Mind Scream Tail, and Life Orb Kilowattrel have great synergy, as they can help overwhelm these shared checks. On sets lacking Agility, Porygon-Z enjoys Sticky Web support from Galvantula. Setup sweepers like Paldean Tauros-W, Flygon, and Breloom force in physical walls like Sylveon, Orthworm, and Vileplume, and if these partners get KOed, Porygon-Z can get a Special Attack boost from Download when coming in on these walls. Similarly, these partners enjoy how Porygon-Z forces in special walls for them to take advantage of.</p>"

Nasty Plot sets have an easy time setting up thanks to Uxie's high defensive stats, which also make them good candidates for defensive Terastallization. Options like Encore, U-turn, Stealth Rock, and Knock Off make Uxie an excellent role compressor. However, Uxie's mediocre Special Attack makes it very passive unless it's set up multiple times, and it struggles to break through common Steel-types like Bronzong and Copperajah even after setting up. Uxie's passivity means its utility sets are easily taken advantage of by common Dark-types like Incineroar, Overqwil, and Alolan Muk. The mono-Psychic typing does few favors for Uxie defensively, which can make it reliant on Terastallization to reliably sweep.</p>",

Pivot sets can use Future Sight over Psychic Noise to put its teammates in even better positions against pressured foes. Utility Uxie can function as a setter for rain, sun, and Trick Room teams with Stealth Rock and Memento, though such dedicated teams tend to be more niche.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Setup Uxie sets are almost incapable of beating Steel-types on their own without setting up several times, locking them into ineffective moves with Encore, and keeping up pressure with Psychic Noise. Utility sets are too passive to beat Steel-types at all, but Bronzong and Copperajah dislike losing their Leftovers to Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Nasty Plot Uxie cannot break through Alolan Muk and is vulnerable to its Poison Jab after Terastallizing, and its utility sets are similarly walled by it. Incineroar also checks Uxie, but it especially dislikes losing its item to Knock Off, and it can be overwhelmed by Uxie Terastallizing.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Basculegion-M, Chandelure, and Brambleghast all threaten Uxie, but they should be wary of Knock Off from utility sets.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: If Nasty Plot Uxie is not behind Substitute, then Munkidori and Gligar can at least put it on a timer.

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Psychic Noise helps Uxie suffocate walls like Milotic, Gastrodon, and Vaporon, somewhat compensating for its passivity. Draining Kiss covers Dark-types, but it's primarily used in tandem with Terastallization to increase Uxie's longevity. Encore can shut down walls and utility Pokemon like Bronzong and Gligar by locking them into utility moves, creating opportunities for Uxie to use them as setup fodder and eventually overwhelm them. Uxie can similarly use Encore against slower offensive Pokemon like Swampert and Breloom to force them into repeatedly using less effective attacks against it, opening windows for itself to sweep. Substitute protects Uxie from slower Toxic users like Gligar and Bellibolt, helping maintain its great longevity as it sweeps, and it can proceed to use them as opportunities to set up. Uxie also has more breathing room against revenge killers like Paldean Tauros-W and Scyther when it's protected by Substitute. Grassy Seed is exclusively for Grassy Terrain teams, and the Defense boost it grants makes Uxie much more difficult for physical attackers like Paldean Tauros-W to revenge kill, and it can open up the possibility for Uxie to run Stored Power over Psychic Noise. Tera Fairy powers up Draining Kiss and gives Uxie a great defensive typing, one that notably resists its usual weaknesses to Dark and Bug. Uxie can use Flygon as setup fodder once it's Terastallized.</p> <p>Uxie is a much-needed defensive backbone for hyper offense teams, flexing both its great bulk and capability to stallbreak against Milotic and Gastrodon. Fellow setup sweepers like Scyther, Dragon Dance Flygon, and Shift Gear Toxtricity can blow holes in teams to get Uxie in position for its own sweep. Uxie can beat physical walls like Avalugg that Scyther and Flygon struggle against, while they can break past special walls like Alolan Muk. Special setup sweepers like Scream Tail can work with Uxie to overwhelm their shared checks like Bronzong and Copperajah. As many of Uxie's answers are grounded, Klefki and other Spikes setters support it well. Alolan Ninetales can set dual screens for Uxie to give it greater windows for accumulating multiple boosts. Both Alolan Ninetales and Cinccino can create additional opportunities for Uxie to set up by using Encore on foes. On Grassy Terrain teams, Thwackey is mandatory as support, and it can get Uxie into comfortable positions to set up thanks to U-turn, Knock Off, and Taunt. Other Pokemon that appear on Terrain teams, including Diancie, Cinccino, and Oricorio-P, can weaken Steel-types, while Arcanine and Paldean Tauros-F destroy Steel-types.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Uxie is a decent bulky pivot capable of compressing plenty of utility onto one set. As Uxie isn't an especially strong attacker, Psychic Noise is helpful to smother bulkier Pokemon with recovery moves, such as Vaporeon and Gastrodon. Knock Off punishes Pokemon that depend on their items, such as Gligar, Alolan Muk, and Incineroar. Uxie's ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from entry hazard removers like Avalugg and Altaria makes it an especially effective hazard setter. Uxie's ability to subject a foe to Encore and pivot out with U-turn makes it an especially adept support option. Thunder Wave especially annoys faster Pokemon like Scream Tail and Scyther, and it especially deters them from using Uxie as setup fodder. Heavy-Duty Boots helps to preserve Uxie's health, as it pivots out frequently and takes chip damage from Stealth Rock, while Leftovers can better benefit Uxie's longevity on teams with decent hazard control. 216 Speed EVs and a Timid nature give Uxie enough Speed to outrun Flamigo and other base 90 Speed Pokemon like Brambleghast. Tera Dark flips Uxie's Dark and Ghost weaknesses into resistances to potentially let it handle Toxicroak, Chandelure, and Basculegion-M in a pinch, and it boosts Knock Off's damage. Tera Steel has better synergy with Levitate, lets Uxie wall Flygon, and grants it a useful Toxic immunity and many resistances.</p> <p>Uxie's entry hazards and pivoting are appreciated by wallbreakers like Paldean Tauros-W, Basculegion-M, and Chandelure, and they can make up for Uxie's passivity thanks to their great power. Setup sweepers like Flygon and Scyther similarly benefit from hazards, the safer positioning provided by U-turn, and Uxie's Encore and Thunder Wave creating opportunities for safer setup. Other pivots, such as Kilowattrel, Toxtricity, and Incineroar can form pivot cores with Uxie and catch foes in the vortex. Incineroar notably checks Dark-types and Ghost-types for Uxie, while Uxie can handle Fighting-types for it. Wish users like Vaporeon and Sylveon can supplement Uxie's otherwise lacking recovery. Dark-types are problematic for Uxie, so wallbreakers like Paldean Tauros-W, Flygon, and Nasty Plot Alolan Ninetales are welcome teammates.

Passive Pokemon that might try to take advantage of Cinccino like Orthworm and Bronzong aren't safe from it either, as Cinccino can lock them into setting up entry hazards or using Iron Defense with its Encore, giving it free turns to boost with Tidy Up. On top of that, after a turn of setup, its myriad of coverage moves lets it beat anything from Flygon to Swampert easily. However, Cinccino has terrible four-moveslot syndrome, and its STAB move can be easily punished by common Rocky Helmet users like Amoonguss and Galarian Slowbro. Pokemon like Inteleon and Choice Scarf Mienshao can outpace it and threaten it with a KO, but they fail to check it after it boosts. Cinccino's Tidy Up is also a double-edged sword, as it needs the power to achieve many of its KOs, but in using the move, it removes the hazards that were helping limit its switch-ins in the first place, making it somewhat difficult to fit on many teams. Cinccino also struggles to find setup opportunities due its frailty typically only letting it survive one hit.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Protective Pads could be run to not be vulnerable to contact punishment, but with how Cinccino is then forced to use Skill Link, it becomes weaker. On teams that would like an offensive form of entry hazard control, Heavy-Duty Boots + Skill Link can be run on Cinccino alongside U-turn, letting it reliably remove hazards and bring in a wallbreaker for incoming Steel-types. However, the weaker power, along with the fact that there are better hazard removal options generally, causes it to be unused. Tera Blast Fire can be utilized on Cinccino to hit Rocky Helmet Amoonguss and Steel-types like Orthworm and Copperajah, which it can have trouble dealing with otherwise, but Tera Blast being a wasted moveslot before Terastallization means that it's generally worse overall.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Orthworm, Registeel, and Copperajah can take all of Cinccino's attacks comfortably and retaliate with a Body Press or powerful Iron Head; on top of that, the latter two can even paralyze and phaze it, respectively. Bronzong can also wall Cinccino and retaliate with Body Press, but it must beware of Knock Off. If any of them set up entry hazards or used Iron Defense as Cinccino came in, they are easily beat one-on-one due to its Encore.</p> <p><strong>Contact Punishment</strong>: Pokemon like Flame Body Chandelure and Static Bellibolt can all cripple Cinccino with a burn or paralysis, and Rocky Helmet users like Overqwil, Amoonguss, and Galarian Slowbro can chip away heavily at Cinccino if it uses Tail Slap, opening it up to being revenge killed even more easily. However, Cinccino can run Rock Blast to take out Chandelure and Knock Off to remove these crippling items.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Fast Pokemon, such as Inteleon and Kilowattrel, and Choice Scarf users, like Infernape and Munkidori, outspeed Cinccino and can threaten it with a KO if Cinccino hasn't boosted yet. On top of that, Pokemon with priority like Mach Punch Breloom and First Impression Flygon can revenge kill Cinccino as well. However, for some of these revenge killers, Cinccino can Terastallize into a Ghost-type and use Encore, which then provides it with setup opportunities.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Knock Off hits Ghost-types that blank Cinccino's STAB attack as well as Bronzong, and Bullet Seed hits certain physically defensive checks like Swampert, Vaporeon, and Milotic. Encore allows Cinccino to take advantage of passive Pokemon like Swampert, Bronzong, and Palossand that use Stealth Rock or heal up, which gifts it more setup opportunities. It also helps Cinccino handle slower setup sweepers like Calm Mind Sylveon and Iron Defense Registeel and Bronzong. Alternatively, Endeavor can be used on Focus Sash sets to heavily dent these same Steel-types for partners like Oricorio-P, Scyther, and Alolan Ninetales, and Triple Axel can be used as a strong coverage move to nail Brambleghast, Gligar, Flygon, and Dragalge. A Cinccino that aims to sweep teams should run Loaded Dice + Technician for maximum damage output. In contrast, if it chooses to be a dedicated lead, Focus Sash + Skill Link allows it to take advantage of both Tidy Up's entry hazard-clearing potential and its multi-hit moves. Tera Ghost allows Cinccino to become immune to Choice Scarf Paldean Tauros-W's as well as Infernape's Close Combat, and it lets Cinccino blank Breloom's Mach Punch and take advantage of it with Encore, giving Cinccino free turns to set up.</p> <p>Cinccino struggles with breaking through Steel-types like Copperajah, Orthworm, and Registeel, so partners such as Alolan Ninetales, Oricorio-P, Diancie, and Munkidori pair well, as they can help overwhelm these shared checks. Teammates that can benefit from Cinccino's Tidy Up removing hazards like Air Balloon Chandelure, Weakness Policy Incineroar, Choice Scarf Staraptor, and Life Orb Kilowattrel enjoy its presence; on top of that, the former two can handle Steel-types easily with their STAB moves, whereas the latter two can help wear them down. Terrain teams can also take advantage of Cinccino's hazard clearing, as common Terrain sweepers like Oricorio-P, Arcanine, and Grafaiai enjoy not being chipped by hazards. Due to them not being as concerned about Cinccino's Tidy Up removing their hazards, Stealth Rock leads like Eject Pack Flygon and Booster Energy Scream Tail pair best with it. Spikes leads like Froslass and Brambleghast can help wear down checks like Orthworm and Copperajah, and a Sticky Web lead like Galvantula can help Cinccino outspeed Choice Scarf users like Infernape, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Munkidori; however, these teams must be wise about when to send out Cinccino to ensure their hazards aren't completely wasted. Physical walls that carry a way to punish contact moves through their ability like Bellibolt or item users like Rocky Helmet Amoonguss and Galarian Slowbro are issues for Cinccino, so teammates with access to Knock Off such as Incineroar and Heracross can help deal with these walls. Cinccino's frailty often hinders its ability to set up, so partners that can create opportunities like Memento Chandelure or slow pivots like Dragalge and Incineroar are greatly appreciated.</p>"

  "Amoonguss": {
    "overview": "<p>Amoonguss is a premier physical wall in NU, taking advantage of its typing to check powerful wallbreakers like Paldean Tauros-W, Basculegion-M, and Breloom, and, with Regenerator, it can scout out many wallbreakers like Flygon, Inteleon, and Torterra. Additionally, with access to Stun Spore and Toxic as well as with Sludge Bomb's high poison chance, Amoonguss spreads status quite easily, letting it even make progress against checks like Incineroar, Chandelure, and Scyther. One of the main issues with Amoonguss, though, is that it lets in Poison-types like Munkidori, Toxicroak, and Toxtricity very freely, and its inability to do much back to them turns it into a liability at times, since they can easily use it as setup fodder. What's more, Amoonguss's weakness to top threats like Alolan Ninetales, Chandelure, Kilowattrel, and Uxie also holds it back quite a bit, and many of the Pokemon that it'd like to check, such as Flamigo, Decidueye, Paldean Tauros-F, and Toxicroak often carry a second typing and STAB attack that invalidates Amoonguss's ability to switch in against them at all.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Amoonguss can use Assault Vest to capitalize on its good resistances, letting it better handle attackers like Inteleon, Sylveon, and Diancie. However, in doing so, it won't be able to use Synthesis, making it entirely reliant on Regenerator for healing, and it can't spread status with Toxic and Stun Spore.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Amoonguss fails to do any meaningful damage to Dragalge, Overqwil, Toxicroak, Munkidori, and Toxtricity with solely its STAB moves, leaving the first to use it as a free switch-in and the latter four free to treat it as setup fodder. However, if Amoonguss carries Stomping Tantrum, it can mitigate their ability to capitalize on it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Amoonguss can't touch Chandelure, Incineroar, and Hisuian Typhlosion too well, meaning they can switch in freely, though they must be cautious of being paralyzed or poisoned.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Tornadus, Kilowattrel, Scyther, and Galarian Articuno all can switch in on a Grass-type attack from Amoonguss and threaten it out with their powerful Flying-type attacks. However, they must be cautious of Amoonguss's Sludge Bomb, Stun Spore, and Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Alolan Ninetales, Avalugg, Beartic, and Alolan Sandslash all threaten Amoonguss with their Ice-type STAB moves. However, the former three loathe switching into it for fear of Sludge Bomb, Toxic, and Stun Spore, while the last dislikes taking a Stomping Tantrum. On top of that, Amoonguss commonly carries Ice-resistant Tera types like Water and Steel, meaning it can take on these threats itself if necessary.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sludge Bomb is preferred for its poison chance and higher Base Power than Clear Smog; however, Clear Smog can help Amoonguss against setup sweepers like Overqwil, Scrafty, and Flygon. Foul Play aids versus physical setup sweepers and wallbreakers like Cinccino, Flygon, and Decidueye. On the other hand, Stomping Tantrum can ensure that Amoonguss isn't walled and taken advantage of by Poison-types like Toxicroak, Alolan Muk, and Toxtricity. Toxic and Stun Spore let Amoonguss cripple setup sweepers like Incineroar, Paldean Tauros-F, Scyther, and Overqwil, while Synthesis provides a reliable source of healing so that Amoonguss doesn't have to rely solely on Giga Drain and Regenerator. Additionally, due to Stomping Tantrum clearing the Poison- and Steel-types immune to poison, it has great synergy with Toxic. Heavy-Duty Boots guarantees that Amoonguss's Regenerator isn't just rendered moot by entry hazards, but Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers like Paldean Tauros-W, Basculegion-M, and Breloom. Eject Button is also a useful item on Amoonguss, since Amoonguss can immediately recover health by switching out thanks to its Regenerator, and it can bring in a teammate safely on the field. This is largely appreciated by rain teams, which enjoy having their rain sweepers at high health. The given EV spread allows Amoonguss to survive a Bleakwind Storm from Tornadus. Tera Water lets Amoonguss take Ice- and Fire-type attacks from Alolan Ninetales, Avalugg, Inteleon, Chandelure, and Paldean Tauros-F. Tera Steel, though, lets it take a myriad of special attacks, including Inteleon's Ice Beam, Tornadus's Hurricane, Munkidori's Psychic, and Porygon-Z's Tri Attack. Alternatively, Tera Fairy is a great defensive typing that also maintains Amoonguss's Fighting resistance while making it better into Flygon, Heracross, and Scyther.</p> <p>Opposing Poison-types like Toxicroak, Munkidori, and Toxtricity can be quite problematic for Amoonguss, since they easily switch into it and can use it as setup fodder. Because of this, Pokemon like Gligar, Bronzong, and Porygon2 make for good teammates. Common Fighting-weak Pokemon like Registeel, Incineroar, and Avalugg pair well with Amoonguss, as it can check Breloom, Paldean Tauros-W, and Heracross. Partners like Milotic, Vaporeon, and Goodra pair well with Amoonguss, handling dangerous Fire-types like Paldean Tauros-F, Incineroar, and Chandelure. On the other hand, offensive Water- and Ground-types like Inteleon, Basculegion-M, and Flygon pair well with Amoonguss, since they can capitalize on how it draws in these Fire-types. Amoonguss's ability to spread status like poison and paralysis with Sludge Bomb, Toxic, and Stun Spore onto Pokemon like Incineroar, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Munkidori is highly appreciated by slower wallbreakers like Chandelure and Heracross. Additionally, Hisuian Typhlosion and Chandelure can take advantage of the status ailments that Amoonguss inflicts on the opposing team with their Infernal Parade and Hex, respectively. Partners like Paldean Tauros-F, Chandelure, and Inteleon enjoy Amoonguss's Water and Grass resistances, letting it be a switch-in to Vaporeon, Paldean Tauros-W, and Breloom, and in the case of the former two, it can also check Flygon for them. Amoonguss sets lacking Heavy-Duty Boots can be easily overwhelmed by having to take both strong attacks from wallbreakers like Flygon and chip damage from entry hazards. To patch this issue, Amoonguss should be paired with hazard removal options like Tidy Up Cinccino, Defog Cramorant as well as Altaria, and Rapid Spin Avalugg.</p>"

Galvantula also spreads paralysis quite easily with both Thunder and Thunder Wave. Galvantula, however, can be outsped and KOed by Pokemon with multi-hit moves like Scale Shot Flygon and Triple Axel Mienshao. Notably, Tsareena, one of the best hazard removers the tier has to offer, can use Rapid Spin to clear Sticky Web and then proceed to outspeed and KO Galvantula with Triple Axel or Knock Off the next turn. Another hurdle for Galvantula to overcome is Magic Bounce Espeon, as it always survives one hit from Galvantula as it switches in and can get severe damage off on it before bringing in a revenge killer to finish it off.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lunge or Pounce can be used to simultaneously ease setup for Galvantula's partners and prevent it from being taken advantage of as easily. Volt Switch can also be run to circumvent Galvantula's passivity by letting it pivot, and it can save Sticky Web for later if the hazard is removed. Energy Ball can be run to hit Pokemon like Diancie and specially defensive Swampert, but dropping Thunder Wave makes Galvantula quite passive overall. Swarm can be used over Compound Eyes with Thunderbolt replacing Thunder, as Galvantula can then OHKO Espeon with Bug Buzz after being knocked into Swarm range by Psychic. Infestation can be used to trap slower Pokemon, preventing any needless predictions to cover an opponent's switch to Magic Bounce Espeon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Control</strong>: Due to Galvantula almost always being a lead, it can be easily countered by entry hazard control. Specifically, Magic Bounce Espeon, Taunt Iron Thorns, Defog Talonflame, and Rapid Spin Tsareena can all thwart hazard setting attempts by Galvantula and KO it without difficulty.</p> <p><strong>Multi-hit Moves</strong>: Some Pokemon carry Focus Sash-breaking multi-hit moves like Tsareena and Mienshao, which can run Triple Axel, and certain setup sweepers like Cinccino, Torterra, and Flygon, which typically run Tail Slap, Rock Blast, and Scale Shot, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Flygon and Torterra can easily boost in front of Galvantula, as they are not OHKOed and can KO Galvantula the next turn with their multi-hit moves. Since Energy Ball is quite rare on Galvantula, Diancie, Quagsire, and specially defensive Swampert can take advantage of it as well by setting their own hazards.</p>",

Thunder + Compound Eyes allows Galvantula to hit as hard as possible with great accuracy. It can also spread paralysis to bulkier Pokemon like Dragalge and Registeel that can freely come in otherwise. Thunder Wave can reliably paralyze Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate that are unaffected by Sticky Web like Talonflame and Cresselia. Tera Ghost on Galvantula is only used in niche situations where forcing Sticky Web to be up by spinblocking Pokemon like Tsareena, Avalugg, and Brambleghast is necessary or there is no strong need to Terastallize another teammate.</p> <p>Setup sweepers that are relatively slow, like Porygon-Z, Chandelure, and Indeedee-M, greatly appreciate foes suffering the Speed drop from Galvantula's Sticky Web. Other setup sweepers that are still outsped even after they boost their Speed like Torterra and Dragon Dance Flygon work magnificently with Galvantula. Galvantula's Sticky Web also tends to get cleared by Tsareena's Rapid Spin and Talonflame's Defog, so spinblockers and Defog deterrents like Chandelure, Hisuian Typhlosion, Kilowattrel, and Galarian Articuno help to dissuade these entry hazard removers. The former two can also run Choice Scarf so that the team has speed control in case Sticky Web is removed. Opposing Choice Scarf users can be difficult to deal with because Pokemon on Sticky Web teams tend to be relatively slow, meaning naturally fast Pokemon like Inteleon, Infernape, and Flygon can work to counteract this issue. Hazards are also quite annoying for Sticky Web teams, especially opposing Sticky Web. Thus, Tsareena can work well as both an offensive threat and a hazard remover. Another hazard remover that works on Sticky Web teams is Focus Sash Brambleghast, as it can also set up Spikes and dent defensive Pokemon with Curse.</p>"

Chandelure, donning a Choice Specs, easily breaks through would-be checks like Diancie and Alolan Muk. However, with Choice Scarf, it becomes a dangerous revenge killer that’s able to check setup sweepers like Munkidori and Mienshao. Chandelure also learns Trick, which allows it to cripple walls and bulky setup sweepers alike such as Umbreon, Incineroar, and Cresselia. However, Chandelure has to deal with being extremely weak to entry hazards, limiting its opportunities to switch in. On top of that, Chandelure itself is quite easily revenge killed due to faster Choice Scarf users that are able to threaten it with their own STAB moves or through coverage moves like Flygon, Mienshao, and Meloetta.</p>",

Heavy-Duty Boots Chandelure can also run Flame Charge or Trailblaze to pick off weakened threats and sweep with its boosted Speed. Chandelure can run Hex on a status spreading team; however, it must give up a powerful STAB attack, coverage, or Trick to do so. Choice Scarf Chandelure can run Memento on a hyper offense team to try to aid its teammates in setting up once it becomes useless. Chandelure can also run Heavy-Duty Boots or Air Balloon to circumvent its entry hazards weakness and Ground-type weakness, respectively. If it runs these, though, it becomes noticeably weaker and slower.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types are a pain for Chandelure mostly because they tend to be able to take one attack and retaliate with a Knock Off. Specifically, Incineroar is quite problematic, since it resists all of Chandelure's attacks and is quite specially defensive, but due its to lack of recovery and entry hazards weakness, Incineroar can be chipped over the course of a game and taken advantage of with Trick, giving Chandelure its Heavy-Duty Boots.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: While Chandelure is able to beat Ghost-types like Basculegion, Brambleghast, and Hisuian Typhlosion offensively, it struggles to switch into and take priority attacks from the former two, and more often that not, it will get outsped and KOed by the latter two.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: With Chandelure's middling Speed, even with Choice Scarf, it is quite easily revenge killed by faster threats.

Heavy-Duty Boots allows Chandelure to ignore entry hazards, letting it switch in repeatedly without worry.

Tera Grass boosts Energy Ball while giving Chandelure a resistance to Ground- and Water-type attacks from Pokemon like Flygon, Swampert, and Vaporeon.

Its Speed is also enormous, letting it blow past common fast Pokemon like Alolan Ninetales, Munkidori, and Paldean Tauros-W. On top of that, it has access to two amazing abilities that allow it to either be more supportive by getting off a fast Taunt and setting up Rain Dance freely with Prankster or offensive by letting it take advantage of common stat-dropping moves and abilities like Altaria's Defog, Brambleghast's Strength Sap, and both Paldean Tauros-W's and Incineroar's Intimidate. While some Tornadus sets run Heavy-Duty Boots, a fair amount don't, since other items can provide more support at times. Tornadus's weakness to Stealth Rock is further exacerbated on non-Heavy-Duty Boots sets by how much it loves to repeatedly come in, though. As a trade-off for its great offensive prowess, Tornadus has low bulk, which really starts to show when combined with its Stealth Rock weakness, and because of it, Tornadus's useful resistances and immunities are rendered moot, meaning it can be overpowered by Flamigo's Close Combat or KOed by a secondary STAB move like Flygon's Outrage. Tornadus also has to deal with either using unreliable moves like Hurricane and Bleakwind Storm or dealing with adverse contact effects such as paralysis from Bellibolt's Static.

A Choice Specs set with Hurricane / Focus Blast / Dark Pulse / U-turn can be run with Tornadus's enormous Special Attack and Speed as well as its access to pivoting, but its reliance on inaccurate moves can make it inconsistent at times. Tornadus can trade out Rain Dance and Damp Rock for Snowscape, Sunny Day, or Sandstorm and its respective weather-elongating item depending on what weather team it's being run on, but non-rain weather teams aren't as consistent overall.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Bellibolt, Rotom-H, Raikou, and Kilowattrel all can take on Tornadus's Hurricane and Acrobatics and retaliate with super effective STAB attacks.

However, they can be easily caught off-guard by Tera Ground, and Bellibolt and Raikou must be wary of Tera Blast Ground.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Copperajah, Registeel, and Bronzong can take multiple hits from Tornadus, and they can capitalize on this by setting up entry hazards or boosting their stats. However, the former two need to watch out for common super effective coverage moves, the latter needs to be cautious of Knock Off, and they all have to watch out for Heat Wave.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Minior, Drednaw, and Diancie can use Tornadus as setup fodder or an opportunity to set up their hazards. However, the latter two need to watch out for super effective coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: While Alolan Ninetales isn't insanely bulky, it can almost always take one attack from Tornadus, especially from physically oriented sets, and retaliate with a powerful Blizzard. Alolan Ninetales also sets snow, forcing Tornadus to set up rain again. Similarly, physical Tornadus sets struggle to get past Avalugg. However, special attacking Tornadus sets with moves like Hurricane, Bleakwind Storm, and Heat Wave can get past Avalugg without too much of an issue.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Tornadus tends to prefer items other than Heavy-Duty Boots, as they can provide more utility. However, this causes Stealth Rock to be an enormous issue, and with how often certain Tornadus sets love to switch in and out, the damage can rack up quickly.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Bleakwind Storm is preferred due to its higher accuracy; however, Hurricane is a stronger STAB move to fire off. Knock Off cripples common switch-ins like Bronzong, Brambleghast, and Diancie. Heat Wave lets Tornadus nail Steel-types like Copperajah, Bronzong, and Registeel, while Grass Knot allows Tornadus to hit Ground- and Water-types like Gastrodon and Milotic. On the other hand, Taunt lets Tornadus stop walls like Bronzong, Gligar, and Gastrodon from setting up, getting their entry hazards up, or healing. An alternative EV spread of 116 HP / 140 SpA / 252 Spe can be used to survive common Choice Scarf users' attacks like Chandelure's Overheat and Hisuian Typhlosion's Eruption. Tera Steel allows Tornadus to tank a variety of hits like Cinccino's Tail Slap, Munkidori's Sludge Wave, and Sylveon's Hyper Voice. Alternatively, Tera Ground lets Tornadus take an Electric- or Rock-type attack from Kilowattrel and Diancie.</p> <p>Tornadus excels at firing off Knock Off and pivoting out, so entry hazard setters like Gastrodon, Bronzong, Orthworm, and Diancie can help capitalize on this trait. Tornadus can take one or two Fighting-type attacks, but it can't switch in consistently. Because of this, Fighting-resistant partners like Galarian Slowbro, Scream Tail, and Sylveon pair well with it. Pivots like Inteleon, Milotic, and Flygon enjoy Tornadus's presence, as it can easily dismantle common Grass-type switch-ins like Decidueye, Amoonguss, and Breloom. Ground- and Steel-types such as Gligar, Gastrodon, Bronzong, and Orthworm can help take on Electric- and Rock-types like Kilowattrel and Diancie that threaten Tornadus. As Tornadus typically lures in Rock-, Electric-, and Steel-types like Diancie, Bellibolt, and Registeel, wallbreakers like Basculegion-M, Choice Band Flygon, Guts Heracross, and Swords Dance Incineroar that capitalize on these Pokemon as entry points synergize extremely well; on top of that, they can also get rid of any neutral special walls trying to check Tornadus like Alolan Muk, Milotic, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro.</p>"

      "Rain Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>U-turn allows Tornadus to bring in a rain sweeper, and it can help create mind games with opposing leads like Galvantula and Cinccino; however, Taunt stops setup sweepers and entry hazard setters from taking advantage of Tornadus. Under rain, Weather Ball is a powerful move that hits Flying-resistant Pokemon like Diancie super effectively while providing strong neutral coverage for others like Copperajah, but Knock Off allows Tornadus to provide more utility, removing important items like Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots while hitting Bronzong and Wind Rider Brambleghast super effectively. Tera Steel provides a strong defensive typing that can let Tornadus have an easier time both setting up rain and pivoting. On the other hand, Tera Ground can turn the tables against Electric- and Rock-types like Kilowattrel and Diancie, which would threaten Tornadus otherwise.</p> <p>Basculegion-M is a no-brainer when it comes to partners, as it can take advantage of Tornadus's rain-setting capabilities with its Swift Swim and rain-boosted Water-type STAB attacks. Other Swift Swim users like Kingdra, Overqwil, and Ludicolo also pair well while offering unique qualities: Kingdra excels at weakening Water-resistant and -immune Pokemon; Overqwil offers rain teams an easy way to handle Grass-types; and Ludicolo takes advantage of Water-types that rain teams can struggle with like Vaporeon, Gastrodon, and Milotic while acting as a secondary rain setter. As Tornadus is quite offensive, it tends to not have great longevity, so a more defensive rain setter like Klefki is greatly appreciated. On top of being more reliable, Klefki can support its team with both entry hazards and Thunder Wave. Tornadus can't handle Water-types too well, and neither can most Swift Swim users; thus, partners like Toxicroak, Kilowattrel, and Brambleghast are greatly appreciated.</p>"
      },
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Hammer Arm is the preferred option to take out Steel-types like Copperajah, Registeel, and Tera Steel Sylveon due to its high Base Power, but because of how it drops Tornadus's Speed, Brick Break can be used for a less punishing but weaker alternative. Notably, at +1, Tornadus's Hammer Arm OHKOes Copperajah after one layer of Spikes and 2HKOes both Registeel and Orthworm. Tera Blast Ground gives Tornadus a more reliable way to take out the aforementioned Steel-types, barring Orthworm, along with Rock-types like Diancie. Tera Ground also allows Tornadus to surprise and take hits from Kilowattrel and Diancie. Alternatively, Knock Off can be used so that Tornadus neither has to Terastallize nor drop its Speed if it wishes to hit or take out Steel-types on low health, and it gives Tornadus a way to easily deal with Bronzong. Sitrus Berry provides some recovery to Tornadus and, when consumed, allows Acrobatics to be at full power. However, no item can be run to automatically have Tornadus at its fullest potential. Defiant lets Tornadus take advantage of common stat-dropping abilities and moves like Overqwil's and Incineroar's Intimidate as well as Vileplume's Strength Sap. Tera Steel can be run to gift Tornadus with a typing that better handles common special attackers like Munkidori, Dragalge, and Sylveon that could easily break through it.</p> <p>Since Defiant is Bulk Up Tornadus's biggest draw, leads like Galvantula, Brambleghast, and Froslass that set entry hazards pair naturally, as they help pressure the opponent's team to use Defog. Ghost-types like Hisuian Typhlosion, Chandelure, and Decidueye make for good partners, as they can create a hazard removal-punishing duo because any of them can spinblock, and Tornadus can punish Defoggers. Tornadus can have issues with KOing Steel-types like Registeel, Bronzong, and Orthworm, meaning teammates like Munkidori, Diancie, Cinccino, and Minior have great synergy, since they can work alongside Tornadus to overwhelm these shared checks. Cinccino is especially good thanks to its Tidy Up clearing Stealth Rock for Tornadus. Fighting- and Ground-types such as Breloom, Toxicroak, Torterra, Paldean Tauros-W, and Flygon work well to take out the aforementioned Steel-types as well as Rock-types like Diancie. The former three can also help take care of pesky defensive Water-types like Vaporeon, Milotic, and Swampert. Bulk Up Tornadus struggles with OHKOing Alolan Ninetales and breaking through Ice-types like Avalugg, meaning teammates that can switch in and beat them such as Chandelure and Diancie are greatly appreciated.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Hurricane provides Tornadus with more power, but Bleakwind Storm has higher accuracy. Focus Blast allows Tornadus to better hit Rock-types like Diancie as well as Dark-types like Incineroar, but Heat Wave gives it a more reliable way of taking out Steel-types such as Copperajah and Registeel. Dark Pulse lets Tornadus hit Wind Rider Brambleghast and the Fighting-neutral Bronzong super effectively, which could potentially wall Tornadus otherwise. Alternatively, Tera Blast Steel can be run to super effectively hit Diancie, which would wall Tornadus pretty well otherwise, as well as letting Tornadus KO Brambleghast. Tera Steel also means Tornadus can take attacks like Inteleon's Ice Beam, Cinccino's Tail Slap, and Munkidori's Psychic, giving it an easier time setting up and firing off attacks. Tera Ground, on the other hand, allows Tornadus to better take on Rock- and Electric-types like Diancie and Kilowattrel. Tera Dark can also potentially be used, as it boosts Dark Pulse and allows Tornadus to have an easier time breaking through Uxie and Bronzong.</p> <p>Tornadus enjoys partners like Diancie, Munkidori, Uxie, Calm Mind Scream Tail, and Porygon-Z, as they can help to overwhelm shared Steel-type checks like Bronzong, Copperajah, and Registeel. Cinccino is also quite good at this, and it can remove entry hazards for Tornadus, letting it comfortably run a different item. Pokemon like Diancie, Toxtricity, and Weakness Policy Incineroar help bring in Fighting- and Ground-types like Breloom, Flygon, and Swampert, which all give Tornadus free setup opportunities. Since Tornadus will most likely thud into and faint to a Steel- or Rock-type, a teammate like Chandelure, Breloom, Torterra, or Flygon works well to take advantage of the free entry they get afterwards. A dedicated lead like Booster Energy Scream Tail, Brambleghast, Eject Pack Flygon, or Focus Sash Infernape is also appreciated to help wear down Tornadus's checks like Diancie, Registeel, and Alolan Muk.</p>"

  "Dragalge": {
    "overview": "<p>Dragalge is a staple in NU thanks to its great typing, utility movepool, and access to Adaptability, which let it successfully fulfill both offensive and defensive roles. Bulkier sets can come in on walls like Vileplume and take advantage of them by setting Toxic Spikes, causing the rest of their team to suffer. On the other hand, Choice Specs sets provide a ton of nuking power with Adaptability, allowing Dragalge to break through former counters like Umbreon and Registeel. However, Dragalge lacks good Speed, meaning it often can't retaliate before strong attackers overwhelm it. Bulkier sets are also held back due to a lack of access to recovery moves and Dragalge’s below-average HP. Dragalge’s typing too, at times, can be somewhat limiting, since Ground- and Steel-types are fairly common in NU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Scald can be used on bulkier Dragalge sets to try to burn checks like Copperajah and Klefki, but this causes Dragalge to lose out on pressure in Toxic Spikes or momentum in Flip Turn. A moveset consisting of Substitute / Sludge Bomb / Dragon Pulse / Focus Blast or Tera Blast Ground can be used with Leftovers to significantly capitalize on forced switches and take advantage of more passive Pokemon. But this can hurt Dragalge's longevity quite a bit, and, in general, opportunities aren’t too common.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types like Flygon and Torterra are difficult to handle for Dragalge, as they’re always faster and can hit it with their powerful STAB Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Registeel and Tera Steel Sylveon wall Dragalge's STAB moves, meaning they can come in and take advantage of it often and only fear Focus Blast. Also, Klefki loves to come in on any of Dragalge’s attacks and spread status or set Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Dragalge struggles against the plethora of Psychic-types like Gallade, Indeedee, and Munkidori. All of these Pokemon easily scare out Dragalge with their Psychic-type STAB moves and also tend to be able to take a hit from it.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls like Alolan Muk, Assault Vest Gallade, Bronzong, and Diancie take on Dragalge’s attacks easily and can threaten it with Knock Off, super effective damage, or a physical attack. All of these Pokemon don’t have a very reliable source of healing, though, so they tend to be whittled down over the course of a battle.</p>",

Flip Turn works amazingly on Dragalge, letting it act as a bulky pivot that can bring in powerful wallbreakers. The given EV spread allows Dragalge to outspeed Vileplume while giving it some physical bulk to aid with Fighting-types like Mienshao and Infernape. Tera Steel allows Dragalge to take Psychic-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type attacks from foes like Munkidori, Sylveon, and opposing Dragalge. On the other hand, Tera Water alleviates its weakness to Ground-type attacks while giving it an overall strong defensive typing.</p> <p>Toxic Spikes lowers switch rates when your opponent tries to play around them, so Pokemon that can scare out Poison-types and cause switches like Flygon and Future Sight Galarian Articuno can overwhelm your opponents. Partners that can bring in physically defensive Pokemon such as Mienshao and Infernape gift Dragalge with chances to set Toxic Spikes. In the face of Steel-types like Klefki and Copperajah, Dragalge fails to do much, so partners that can take advantage of its Flip Turn and deal with these pests, like Gallade, Mienshao, and Flare Blitz Talonflame, work well. Opposing Dragon- and Fairy-type Pokemon also cause issues for Dragalge, as they’re usually faster and can severely damage or KO Dragalge before it can react. Teammates that help alleviate this weakness such as Sylveon, Registeel, and Copperajah are appreciated. Dragalge’s limited HP also hinders it; to ensure its survival for longer, entry hazard removers or Wish users like Talonflame, Brambleghast, and Vaporeon can be used. Pokemon like Vileplume and Tsareena that can handle more offensive Ground-types such as Flygon and Torterra can help out Dragalge.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sludge Wave is preferred for damage output, but Sludge Bomb can more reliably poison specially defensive Pokemon like Gastrodon and Umbreon. Focus Blast can heavily dent many Steel-types on the switch-in like Registeel, Klefki, and Copperajah. Tera Blast Ground can be used instead to hit these targets more accurately and powerfully along with Alolan Muk; however, this comes at the cost of Terastallizing, making it not as favored of an option overall. For the last move, a way to pivot in Flip Turn is preferred to bring a partner in on a wall it would otherwise have trouble with. The given EVs let Dragalge outpace Vaporeon and Umbreon with the rest poured into HP. An alternative and bulkier EV spread of 120 HP / 252 SpA / 136 Spe can be run, as it gives Dragalge enough Speed to outrun uninvested Sylveon. Tera Poison grants Dragalge a resistance to Fairy while also powering Sludge Wave to preposterous levels; however, a more defensive Tera type like Tera Steel could be used to help Dragalge retaliate after surviving Psychic- and Dragon-type attacks.</p> <p>Dragalge’s low Speed tends to hinder it a lot, but this can be negated with pivot cores.

  "Sylveon": {
    "overview": "<p>Sylveon's great matchup against top threats like Scrafty and Flygon alongside its set versatility makes it one of the premier Fairy-types in NU. Wallbreaking sets can break through common special walls like Alolan Muk and Gastrodon. Sylveon can also run a more defensive set, letting it heal up teammates that it naturally synergizes with like Incineroar, Registeel, and Swampert that lack reliable recovery. Sylveon has great Special Defense, letting it take on special wallbreakers like Inteleon and Diancie with little or no investment. However, both of Sylveon's roles are contested by another Fairy-type, namely Florges, as Florges has access to Trick for Choice Specs sets as a way to decommission Steel-types and special walls, and it has higher Speed, meaning its wallbreaking sets can outpace more threats and Wish passing sets can invest more in its Defense. On top of that, Sylveon must compete with other Wish passers such as Vaporeon and Scream Tail, which can provide more utility at times with the former having access to Haze and Flip Turn, while the latter can provide Thunder Wave and Encore. Sylveon is also walled immensely by Steel-types like Copperajah and Registeel, but their lack of recovery leaves them susceptible to being worn down over the course of a game. Wish sets also tend to be passive and easily taken advantage of by the aforementioned Steel-types and setup sweepers like Munkidori and Incineroar. Sylveon's subpar Defense can also let it be broken through, as it's typically forced to take Knock Off for its team all while being whittled away at by entry hazards.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Due to Choice Specs Sylveon already having all the coverage it needs from its first three slots, it can run many moves for its last. Sylveon can opt for Quick Attack as a means to pick off weakened threats. Hyper Beam can be used as a nuke button that's able to chip away at Steel-types heavily but leaves it open the next turn. Sylveon can even forgo Choice Specs entirely and go for a Pixie Plate set that allows it to bluff Choice Specs, surprising its opponent when it changes up its moves; however, Sylveon's overall power drops. On Wish sets, Moonblast + Cute Charm can be run on bulkier teams, as Moonblast has higher PP than Hyper Voice, and if Sylveon is female, it can fish for immobilization via attraction against Pokemon forced to be male like Hitmonlee and Tornadus.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Registeel, Bronzong, and Copperajah all wall Sylveon and can use it to set entry hazards, as they easily threaten it out with their Steel-type STAB moves. While Klefki can also wall Sylveon, use it to set entry hazards, and paralyze it with Thunder Wave, it's more of a stalemate because Klefki fails to do significant damage to Sylveon unless it carries a rare move like Steel Beam. All of these Steel-types must be wary of Tera Blast Ground and, in Bronzong's case, Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Alolan Muk, Munkidori, Amoonguss, and Tentacruel can take a Hyper Voice and threaten back with super effective Poison-type attacks. Dragalge can also take a hit and threaten it, but it can only do this once per game.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Sylveon, especially when defensive, tends to have to take Knock Off and U-turn for its team, and losing Heavy-Duty Boots or not running it in the first place means entry hazards also chip away at it. All of this combined with Wish taking two turns and possibly being cancelled out due to Roar from Swampert or Whirlwind from Copperajah means that Sylveon can be whittled away at and beaten by wallbreakers it normally beats, like Incineroar and Flygon.</p>",

However, Psyshock can be run to hit Tentacruel and both Tera Poison Bronzong harder. Shadow Ball gives Sylveon a strong neutral move for the Steel-types that tend to switch into Sylveon like Klefki, Registeel, and Copperajah, and notably, it hits Bronzong super effectively. As Sylveon's last moveslot is its most flexible one, it prefers to run Draining Kiss as a secondary STAB move so that it doesn't get chipped away at as easily. Tera Blast Ground can instead be used to hit the aforementioned non-Bronzong Steel-types that could sit on Sylveon otherwise; however, due to this requiring Terastallization, it typically isn't run. A Modest nature is preferred for the extra damage output, but Timid can be run to outspeed Adamant Incineroar. Tera Fairy allows Sylveon to reach catastrophic levels of damage with its Hyper Voice, as it's now able to 2HKO Fairy-resistant Pokemon like Rotom-H and Galarian Slowbro.</p> <p>Sylveon's main roadblock from tearing apart teams is bulky Steel-types like Registeel, Copperajah, and Klefki; however, due to their lack of recovery, there are a few ways its teammates can whittle them down. Entry hazard setters like Brambleghast, Swampert, and Flygon can help to soften up these Steel-types for Sylveon's attacks. Another way to break through these Pokemon is teammates that carry super effective coverage to surprise these Steel-types like Close Combat Staraptor, Focus Blast or Tera Blast Ground Munkidori, and Focus Blast Dragalge. It can also go through more straightforward means such as having a partner like Paldean Tauros formes, Incineroar, or Flygon to pressure these Steel-types. Incineroar, Flygon, and Infernape greatly enjoy Sylveon as a partner, as they can pivot it in on physically defensive Water-types like Milotic, Swampert, and Vaporeon that wall them. Choice Scarf users like Munkidori, Meloetta, and Porygon-Z enjoy Sylveon wearing away at Steel-types like Copperajah, Klefki, and Registeel. Sylveon easily dispatches Dark-types like Incineroar, Scrafty, and Alolan Muk. Teammates that benefit from this like Meloetta, Galarian Articuno, and Brambleghast pair well alongside Sylveon, as they can form a wallbreaking core together.</p>"

On the other hand, Roar prevents Sylveon from needing to risk certain Calm Mind wars like those versus Scream Tail, Galarian Articuno, and Bronzong, and it doubles as a way to get extra chip damage on Steel-types trying to switch in, forcing them out to rack up entry hazard damage. The Speed EVs allow Sylveon to get the jump on Vaporeon, letting Sylveon avoid having its stat boosts thrown away by Vaporeon's Haze before it can get a hit off. Tera Steel is preferred, as it allows Sylveon to better handle Poison- and Steel-types like Amoonguss and Copperajah, provides an immunity to Gligar's Toxic, and lets it soft check many special attackers in a pinch like Munkidori, Porygon-Z, and Toxtricity. Tera Poison, on the other hand, maintains Sylveon's matchup against Fighting-types while keeping Tera Steel's utility against Toxic users and poison from Alolan Muk. Alternatively, Tera Water provides a strong defensive typing that doesn't forfeit Sylveon's matchup against both Ground- and Fighting-types like Flygon and Infernape. Leftovers prevents Sylveon from having to use Wish as often and lets it heal with Protect, but Heavy-Duty Boots is useful to circumvent entry hazard chip damage.</p> <p>Sylveon's access to Wish means it can support Pokemon without reliable recovery like Swampert, Bronzong, and Incineroar. Pokemon like Basculegion-M, Munkidori, and Registeel that are scared out by Wo-Chien, Flygon, and Heracross enjoy having Sylveon to check these threats. Alongside a specially defensive partner like Alolan Muk, Gastrodon, or Copperajah, Sylveon can help to form a defensive backbone for teams. Sylveon also appreciates wallbreakers like Paldean Tauros-W, Flygon, and Chandelure, as they can pressure Steel-types that typically wall and take advantage of it like Klefki, Copperajah, and Bronzong. Due to Sylveon's reliance on Protect to safely heal, it's vulnerable to setup sweepers like Drednaw, Munkidori, and Paldean Tauros formes, meaning Choice Scarf revenge killers like Ditto or Pokemon with priority like Flygon pair well with it. Sylveon also tends to be a momentum sink, so pivots like Flygon, Incineroar, and Flamigo that do well versus common switch-ins like Alolan Muk, Registeel, and Copperajah can help regain lost momentum. As Sylveon can be easily chipped down by entry hazards and having to switch into Knock Off and U-turn from Pokemon like Incineroar, a second soft check to physical attackers is welcome, so partners like Scyther, Amoonguss, and Dragalge work well to fulfill this role.</p>"

Klefki's Prankster ability lets it scatter Spikes, spread paralysis with Thunder Wave, summon rain and sun, and even boost its own stats before the foe can act; it's a very malleable Pokemon that can find itself on almost any team due to its supportive capabilities. Klefki's highly coveted Steel / Fairy typing makes it a great sponge for special attacks, taking on the likes of Munkidori, Espeon, and Dragalge while also resisting Knock Off and U-turn. Although Klefki has many tricks up its sleeve, offense is not one of them, since it uses paltry base 80 offensive stats and often relies on Foul Play to not be a complete sitting duck. Any means to circumvent Prankster-affected moves such as Magic Bounce, Dark-types, and Taunt can generally spell doom for Klefki. Dark-types like Incineroar, Alolan Muk, and Tera Dark Drednaw can take advantage of Klefki's inability to status them. Despite Klefki's phenomenal defensive typing, its stats often leave much to be desired, meaning some special wallbreakers like Porygon-Z and Indeedee-M can eventually overwhelm it even in spite of a type disadvantage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Klefki can utilize its Prankster ability to run a Double Dance set; boosting its Defense with Iron Defense and special stats with Calm Mind while maintaining its health with Draining Kiss to turn Stored Power into an unwallable attack.

Klefki can use Eject Button or Red Card in tandem with Prankster Recycle to repeatedly pivot itself or its foe out of play.

  "Avalugg": {
    "overview": "<p>Avalugg's exceptional physical bulk and access to Rapid Spin and Recover make it one of the best physical walls in the tier for balanced and defensive teams. Avalugg can comfortably take some of the most powerful physical attacks in the tier, such as Basculegion-M's Wave Crash and Staraptor's Brave Bird, as well as super effective attacks from Fighting-types such as Infernape and Paldean Tauros-W. Avalugg can also dish out serious damage by weaponizing its Defense stat with Body Press and hitting hard with moves like Avalanche and Earthquake, thanks to its high Attack stat. However, Avalugg is extremely frail on the special side, which allows special wallbreakers such as Munkidori and Porygon-Z to easily force it out. Avalugg's Ice typing makes it weak to common physical wallbreakers in the tier like Incineroar, Paldean Tauros-F, and Flamigo and heavily reliant on Terastallization to wall many physical threats. Avalugg is also very susceptible to Knock Off, since it relies on Heavy-Duty Boots to circumvent its Stealth Rock weakness.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Running IronPress allows Avalugg to become a very threatening sweeper. However, this forces Avalugg to drop a coverage option or Rapid Spin, the former making Avalugg unable to hit Ghost-types, while the latter significantly reduces its utility. Tera Fighting removes Avalugg's weaknesses and makes Avalugg more offensively threatening. Tera Fighting also lets Avalugg resist Stealth Rock, allowing it to switch in more frequently if its Heavy-Duty Boots is removed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers, such as Chandelure, Inteleon, and Munkidori, pose a major threat to Avalugg, since it cannot handle their attacks very well. However, Sturdy can help mitigate this issue by allowing Avalugg to deal damage to special wallbreakers for its partners when necessary.</p> <p><strong>Fire- and Fighting-type Wallbreakers</strong>: Powerful physical attackers such as Incineroar, Paldean Tauros-F, Heracross, and Flamigo threaten Avalugg with their strong STAB moves, forcing it out. Avalugg's sheer bulk allows it to take one hit from even super effective attackers, these Pokemon often run Choice Band or Swords Dance sets, preventing Avalugg from safely switching in and beating them.</p> <p><strong>Item Displacement</strong>: Avalugg's Ice typing means it requires Heavy-Duty Boots to consistently switch in. Avalugg must use Recover more often if Knock Off users like Incineroar and Alolan Muk or Trick users remove its Heavy-Duty Boots, making it harder for Avalugg to consistently remove entry hazards and wall important foes.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Body Press utilizes Avalugg's Defense stat to threaten 2HKOs or 3HKOs on most offensive threats while hitting bulky Steel-types for super effective damage. Body Press also threatens attackers such as Tera Steel Flygon and Incineroar. Since Avalugg is slower than nearly the entire metagame, Avalanche is a great STAB option. However, Ice Spinner can sometimes be preferable for more consistent damage and can remove Terrain, which helps Avalugg and its team against Grassy Terrain offense teams. Earthquake deals super effective damage to Fire-, Poison-, and Electric-type wallbreakers that try to take advantage of Avalugg, such as Chandelure, Munkidori, and Toxtricity. Sturdy allows Avalugg to always survive a single attack in a pinch and retaliate. When paired with Alolan Ninetales, though, Ice Body can be used to capitalize on its snow to gain passive recovery. Tera Poison gives Avalugg a great defensive typing, providing it with a resistance to Fighting and making it immune to poison and Toxic, which would otherwise cripple it, from Alolan Muk and Amoonguss. Alternatively, Tera Water grants Avalugg important resistances to Fire, Steel, and Water, letting it better withstand attacks from threats like Incineroar, Copperajah, and Basculegion-M.</p> <p>Avalugg's entry hazard control and high Defense is appreciated by many teamstyles from balance to stall. However, Avalugg's abysmal Special Defense means that it benefits greatly from blanket special walls such as Porygon2, Registeel, and Milotic, which can switch into the many special attackers that force Avalugg out like Toxtricity, Diancie, and Chandelure. Fire- and Fighting-type wallbreakers like Paldean Tauros-F, Flamigo, and Breloom can overwhelm Avalugg, meaning Pokemon that can switch into their attacks, such as Chandelure, Gligar, and Amoonguss, are good partners. Avalugg struggles to threaten Ghost-types like Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion with its attacks, especially if it lacks Earthquake, making Dark-types such as Incineroar and Alolan Muk good partners for it. These two can also burn and poison wallbreakers, making it much easier for Avalugg to outlast them. Bulky Water-types, such as Vaporeon, Gastrodon, and Milotic, can pose a huge problem for Avalugg, as they have powerful special attacks and are difficult to switch out of due to the risk of Scald burning an incoming Pokemon. Water-immune Pokemon such as Vaporeon and Toxicroak can help immensely, while status-immune wallbreakers, such as Poison Heal Breloom, Toxtricity, and Guts Hariyama, can force them out or set up on them. Alolan Ninetales outspeeds many Fighting-type wallbreakers that threaten Avalugg, such as Flamigo, Paldean Tauros-F and -W, and Breloom, and can KO them with Moonblast. It also sets snow for Avalugg, boosting its Defense considerably and giving it passive recovery from Ice Body. In return, Avalugg can draw in and dent Steel-type walls, such as Registeel and Copperajah, which are difficult for Alolan Ninetales to get past, by using Body Press and Earthquake.</p>"

With well-rounded stats, Diancie can easily go both offensive and defensive, with its sets being supported by its large movepool. Specially defensive Diancie is a great check to special wallbreakers like Chandelure, Kilowattrel, and Hisuian Typhlosion, and it can carry Encore to circumvent its passivity when against setup sweepers. Trick Room sets can easily turn the tables versus faster, more offensive teams, as Diancie can outspeed and KO everything after it gets its Special Attack boost from Meteor Beam.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Diancie can run Rock Polish for a more permanent Speed boost, but with its low-base Speed, it's easily outpaced by Choice Scarf users like Flygon, Inteleon, and Mienshao even after it boosts. A Sticky Web setter is great for this set, as it attempts to solve Diancie's low Speed issue. If there is already a Stealth Rock user on Diancie's team, it can run Spikes instead so that it can continue to provide entry hazard support. Specially defensive sets can run a more specially-oriented moveset, with moves like Moonblast, Earth Power, and Power Gem being run over Diamond Storm and Body Press. Diancie can also run a sweeper set with a moveset of Calm Mind / Iron Defense / Draining Kiss / Stored Power, which can take advantage of passive or weaker Pokemon quite well, but it can be easily overpowered by any wallbreaker or Trick, Encore, and Taunt users. Diancie can also run offensive sets with Stealth Rock and Spikes, usually with Moonblast and Earth Power supporting it; however, it is considered a bit suboptimal, since its bulk is usually appreciated to set hazards up safely.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Bulky Steel-types like Bronzong, Registeel, and Copperajah can easily switch in on Diancie and set up entry hazards, forcing it out or making it use Tera in order to survive an attack and KO them. In particular, Bronzong is quite bothersome for Diancie, as it walls its STAB attacks and is immune to Earth Power thanks to Levitate. However, all of these Steel-types lack a form of reliable recovery making them easily overwhelmed over the course of a battle. Both Bronzong and Registeel take a lot of damage from +2 Body Press and +1 Earth Power, respectively, so after some chip damage, Diancie can beat them.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Flygon, Swampert, and Gastrodon are trouble for Diancie, as they threaten Diancie out with their Ground-type STAB attacks and can take advantage of it by setting up entry hazards. If Diancie is running Moonblast, it can somewhat damage them, but if its not, it is an almost free switch-in for them, as Earth Power and Body Press aren't doing enough to threaten them.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Offensive or defensive Water-types such as Inteleon, Basculegion, and Vaporeon can all threaten Diancie with their STAB attacks. They can also use Diancie for momentum and pivot with U-turn or Flip Turn, and they can even force Diancie to Terastallize or switch out. Inteleon and Basculegion both cannot deal with Diancie when under Trick Room, as they get defeated before they can act.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Offensive Grass-types such as Torterra and Tsareena make progress against and threaten Diancie; however they can't comfortably switch in on offensive sets. Torterra and Tsareena force Diancie to switch out or Terastallize, and the latter can even remove its Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin. Both of those Pokémon can't defeat Diancie when in Trick Room, as they get KOed first by +1 Moonblast</p>",

Body Press hits Steel-types like Copperajah and Registeel trying to switch in on Diancie, and it can take advantage of Diamond Storm's chance to boost its Defense. Encore prevents Diancie's passivity from getting taken advantage of too easily by opposing hazard setters and setup sweepers, such as Klefki and Iron Thorns alike, but Moonblast can be used to be able to hit Ground-types like Swampert and Flygon harder. Tera types for this set are focused on flipping Diancie's matchups. Tera Water gives Diancie a resistance to Steel- and Water-type attacks, letting it finish off Copperajah and Inteleon while maintaining its Fire resistance. However, Tera Steel trades Diancie's matchup against Fire-types for a strong defensive typing thay can take on hits from Munkidori, Sylveon, and Tsareena without issue. Tera Dragon on the other hand lets Diancie take on Rotom-C and Araquanid, but it completely throws away its matchup against Dragalge and Florges.</p> <p>Fire-types like Incineroar and Talonflame make for strong partners because they threaten Steel- and Grass-types that force Diancie out, such as Bronzong, Registeel, Tsareena, and Brambleghast. The aforementioned Grass-types, along with Rotom-C, also have great synergy with Diancie, as it checks Fire- and Flying-types for them. In return, they handle Ground- and Water-types like Flygon, Swampert, and Inteleon. Diancie can't take on physical wallbreakers like Toxicroak and Mienshao too well, so physically defensive Pokemon like Swampert, Dragalge, and Talonflame pair well with it to help check these threats.</p>"

Earth Power offers coverage for the Steel- and Poison-types that can take Diancie's Moonblast comfortably such as Registeel, Copperajah, and Tentacruel. Trick Room lets Diancie turn the tables versus offense, using their Speed against them, whereas Stealth Rock works on offensive teams like Grassy Terrain ones that enjoy its typing, utility, and power but don't plan on sacrificing it immediately. Power Herb allows Diancie to immediately attack and get its Special Attack boost with Meteor Beam. No Speed EVs and IVs ensures Diancie can move as fast as possible under Trick Room, while 120 HP / 252 SpA / 136 Spe with a Modest nature lets Diancie outpace Vaporeon, Sylveon, and Incineroar; hit as hard as possible; and still be able to take attacks. Tera Grass gives Diancie a resistance to Grass-, Ground-, and Water-type attacks while giving it a neutrality to Steel-type moves, letting it set up Trick Room and attack more easily. Alternatively, Tera Fairy boosts Moonblast, letting Diancie power through Bronzong and Orthworm at times, as well as giving it a Fighting resistance. Tera Ground is an option to boost Earth Power's damage, which is really appreciated to get KOs it wouldn't otherwise.</p> <p>A lead to set up entry hazards such as Brambleghast or Froslass makes for a great partner, as it can help chip checks like Registeel, Alolan Muk, and Tentacruel into range for a KO. Mienshao and Breloom enjoy how Diancie can come in on and take advantage of Talonflame, and with it being downed, they don't need to worry about being revenge killed as easily or getting burned. Pokemon like Flygon, Drednaw, Oricorio-E, Galarian Articuno, and Iron Thorns that can chip away at and weaken Steel-types like Registeel and Copperajah for Diancie pair well with it too.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Decidueye is an incredibly powerful physical attacker, using Swords Dance-boosted Spirit Shackle, Poltergeist, and Leaf Blade to do massive damage to opposing walls, such as Amoonguss, Registeel, and Gligar, and revenge killing faster foes like Munkidori and Chandelure with Shadow Sneak. It also serves as one of the few viable users of Defog in the tier, taking advantage of the fear its powerful physical sets create to find turns to clear entry hazards. Its typing allows it to switch in on common attackers like Paldean Tauros-W, Breloom, and Flygon, and it often finds turns to set up in front of common defensive Water-types like Gastrodon, Vaporeon, and Milotic. Its ability to throw out powerful attacks is only enhanced by Long Reach, which allows it to avoid the threats of Chandelure's Flame Body, Bellibolt's Static, and Rocky Helmet. Decidueye does struggle with its mediocre Speed though, particularly on offensive sets. Even Swords Dance-boosted Shadow Sneak does not often pick off neutral targets from full HP without Tera Ghost, leaving Decidueye open to being revenge killed by many faster and Ghost-immune foes such as Cinccino, Porygon-Z, and Tera Normal Toxtricity. Decidueye's STAB types are also walled by several common Pokemon, namely Overqwil, Alolan Muk, and Incineroar. Defog sets must also be careful of several Competitive and Defiant Pokemon, such as Kilowattrel, Galarian Articuno, Milotic, and Tornadus.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Decidueye can run Low Kick instead of Leaf Blade or Shadow Sneak in order to hit Incineroar, other Dark-types, and Registeel for super effective damage, but it loses either priority or its Grass-type STAB move in return. Decidueye can also run a special attacking set of Nasty Plot / Shadow Ball / Giga Drain, Leaf Storm, or Energy Ball / Roost or Tera Blast Ground, but this set can be easily revenge killed because it lacks priority.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types and Dark-type Attacks</strong>: Common Dark-types like Alolan Muk, Overqwil, and Incineroar wall Decidueye's STAB moves, and the latter two weaken it further with Intimidate. Many other Pokemon such as Grafaiai, Toxicroak, and Cinccino threaten Decidueye with Knock Off as well.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types and Fire-type Attacks</strong>: Fire-types, such as the previously mentioned Incineroar along with Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion, threaten to blow Decidueye away with powerful Fire-type attacks.

Speedy attackers like Scream Tail and Flygon can also run Fire Blast to threaten Decidueye.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Decidueye must be wary of powerful Flying-type Pokemon like Scyther, Kilowattrel, Galarian Articuno, and Tornadus. The latter three also threaten Defog sets with Competitive and Defiant boosts. However, none of them want to switch into Poltergeist and Spirit Shackle, and they can also be picked off with Shadow Sneak.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Alolan Ninetales can survive most of Decidueye's attacks with the Defense boost from snow, threatens it back with Blizzard and Freeze-Dry, and can lock it into Swords Dance with Encore.

Shadow Sneak lets Decidueye pick off and revenge kill faster foes, particularly Ghost-weak ones like Chandelure, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Munkidori. Tera Ghost lets Shadow Sneak OHKO Inteleon, Kilowattrel, and, after Stealth Rock damage, Flamigo, while Tera Fairy and Water act defensively to give Decidueye a chance to set up in front of Dark-types like Scrafty and Fire-types like Incineroar, respectively.</p> <p>Decidueye appreciates teammates like Munkidori and Chandelure that are also checked by Dark- and Fire-types, since it can work together with these partners to wear down shared checks like Alolan Muk and Incineroar.

Backup physical attackers can work to overwhelm solid physical walls like Amoonguss and Bellibolt, so the Paldean Tauros formes, Toxicroak, and Flygon can support Decidueye very well. On top of that, they can capitalize on Pokemon that Decidueye might faint against like Incineroar, Overqwil, and Alolan Muk.

Sword Dance sets can make Incineroar into a great wallbreaker, since many defensive staples like Amoonguss, Galarian Slowbro, and Registeel just drop to its Swords Dance-boosted STAB attacks. Also, Incineroar easily checks the common Ghost-, Grass-, and Steel-types like Chandelure, Decidueye, and Klefki, meaning it can take advantage of its utility moves with a defensive pivot set if it wishes. It has Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off to cripple incoming physical wallbreakers like Toxicroak, Flygon, and Paldean Tauros-W and item-reliant Pokemon like Diancie, Avalugg, and Swampert. Defensive Incineroar is also solid for handling special wallbreakers such as Chandelure, Porygon-Z, and Heavy-Duty Boots Munkidori. However, Incineroar's low Speed stat makes it very easy for wallbreakers with a middling Speed tier like Basculegion, Breloom, and Heracross to outspeed and destroy it with their own STAB attacks. Incineroar's reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots can be felt, since it has to be wary of switching into opposing Knock Off from Tsareena, Alolan Muk, and Wo-Chien. It even has to worry about switching into the Pokemon it checks best, Chandelure, as it carries Trick to cripple Incineroar.

Iron Head can be used on Swords Dance Incineroar to surprise Sylveon, Diancie, and Florges, but the ability to pivot, boost its Speed, or use a high-Base Power coverage move tends to be better overall. Weakness Policy + Power Trip sets can be used on hyper offense teams, letting Incineroar become a dangerous sweeper. Incineroar has a bunch of usable defensive Tera types, but they are really inconsistent for many teams. Tera Flying helps Incineroar take on Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, but it retains its weakness to Stealth Rock.

The given EV spread allows Incineroar to get the jump on Vaporeon while having as much special bulk as possible. Tera Fairy provides it the ability to check Dragon- and Fighting-types like Flygon and Heracross while also letting it resist the omnipresent U-turn. Alternatively, Tera Dragon gives Incineroar the ability to check a myriad of special attackers like Toxtricity and Inteleon. Tera Water is similar to Tera Dragon but replaces a Grass resistance for an Ice resistance, making Incineroar better against Inteleon.</p> <p>Grass-types like Tsareena, Brambleghast, and Amoonguss are great partners for Incineroar, since they can handle bulky Water- and Ground-types such as Vaporeon, Swampert, and Gastrodon. Fighting-types like Flamigo, Toxicroak, and Infernape can force Incineroar to switch, so it best pairs with physically defensive Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro, Bellibolt, and Sylveon that can handle the aforementioned Fighting-types. Additionally, Sylveon can provide Incineroar with recovery by passing it a Wish. Wallbreakers like Inteleon, Munkidori, and Toxtricity appreciate Incineroar's slow Parting Shot, as they can get a free entry on Rock-, Fighting-, and Water-types that tend to switch in on Incineroar. Setup sweepers like Swords Dance Toxicroak and Dragon Dance Flygon similarly appreciate Incineroar's Parting Shot weakening foes and it giving them more opportunities to set up. Incineroar's longevity is limited and can be cut severely if it loses its Heavy-Duty Boots, so it pairs well with entry hazard removers such as Tsareena, Tentacruel, and Brambleghast.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Tsareena is NU's best entry hazard remover, and for good reason: it easily beats the plethora of Grass-weak hazard setters like Rhyperior, Swampert, and Diancie, and even Steel-types such as Klefki and Registeel are inconsistent at beating it one-on-one. While offensive Tsareena profiles as a solid wallbreaker that can take over games thanks to Rapid Spin's Speed boost, defensive sets are fantastic at checking the swathes of offensive Ground-types in NU, especially Krookodile and Flygon, and its access to Synthesis is a huge factor in it outclassing Brambleghast, its primary competition. Tsareena faces some very real struggles defensively, though, as almost every Ground-type it aims to check carries super effective coverage, like Gunk Shot from Krookodile and Megahorn from Rhyperior, that threatens to KO it with minimal chip damage required. Offensive sets aren't very fast without a Speed boost and easily pressured by other wallbreakers like Chandelure and Munkidori as well as fast utility options in Noivern and Talonflame. Meanwhile, defensive sets are quite easy to exploit due to their reliance on Knock Off with Pokemon like RestTalk Alolan Muk, Vileplume, and Dragalge.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tsareena has other usable Tera types than the ones listed, but they lack consistency across teams. Tera Dark is good for teams that lack a Ghost resistance and amps up Knock Off's damage, but it offers little else. Tera Ghost is a harder answer to Fighting-types than Tera Poison, but it's just as bad into Krookodile and gives Tsareena a horrible Alolan Muk matchup. Tera Fire is similar to Tera Dragon in helping Tsareena against Fire-types, although Tsareena gains a Water weakness. Choice Scarf sets are good at revenge killing priority-reliant setup sweepers like Lycanroc-D and Lucario and don't have to worry about Klefki's Thunder Wave.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: All of Talonflame, Noivern, and Acrobatics Thundurus outspeed Tsareena and beat it with relative ease. Talonflame hates losing its item, though, and both Noivern and Thundurus are vulnerable to Triple Axel from offensive sets.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Alolan Muk is a great Tsareena answer, especially if it's RestTalk. Other Poison-types like Dragalge, Vileplume, and Munkidori are good checks but less consistent. The former two cannot survive Knock Off followed by Triple Axel, while the latter is too frail to take Knock Off from either Tsareena set.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Incineroar counters Tsareena with ease, only fearing the rare High Jump Kick. Although Knock Off obliterates Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion, they both can spinblock Tsareena, tank its Power Whip, and OHKO it with their Fire-type attacks barring a well-timed Terastallization.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Tsareena doubles as a source of entry hazard removal and a potent wallbreaker. Knock Off punishes switch-ins such as Talonflame and Magnezone while obliterating Chandelure, and Triple Axel deletes opposing Grass-types like Vileplume, Venusaur, and Rotom-C as well as Noivern. If you wish to tap further into Tsareena's utility movepool, U-turn is optional over Triple Axel, still giving it an out against any of its checks while enabling its stronger teammates. High Jump Kick is another coverage move you can try, as it's Tsareena's best option for hitting Steel-type hazard setters like Copperajah and Registeel and does good damage to Incineroar. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Tsareena bypass hazard damage, which increases its proficiency as a spinner, but Lum Berry helps against Talonflame's Flame Body and Slowbro's Scald. Tsareena usually shouldn't be Terastallizing, but Tera Dragon potentially lets it KO a Chandelure or Hisuian Typhlosion with Knock Off and gives Tsareena a good sun matchup, while Tera Steel blanks Munkidori's STAB moves, potentially lets Tsareena beat Cloyster, and helps it against Alolan Muk.</p> <p>Tsareena is great at luring in and beating certain Poison-types like Dragalge, Vileplume, and Venusaur with Triple Axel; make sure to pair it with teammates like Mienshao, Thundurus, and Sylveon that can take advantage of this. Furthermore, Mienshao especially, as well as other physical attackers like Gallade and Infernape, appreciate Tsareena removing Talonflame's Heavy-Duty Boots and making it easier to overwhelm with Stealth Rock up. Similarly, teammates like Choice Specs Noivern, Chandelure, and Hisuian Typhlosion all appreciate Tsareena's Rapid Spin, and the latter two can beat Steel-type checks like Klefki, Registeel, and Magnezone for Tsareena. Talonflame is perhaps the most common switch-in to Tsareena, so Pokemon like Diancie and Slowbro that easily switch into it are helpful to have.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Bulky Tsareena is one of the tier's few good answers to the plethora of offensive Ground-types in NU, such as Flygon, Krookodile, and Rhyperior. Although they possess super effective coverage moves for it, they can't OHKO it, and Synthesis keeps Tsareena healthy throughout the game so it can stay out of KO range from these threats. The biggest boon to this set, though, is destroying Klefki; it can't do enough damage with Foul Play thanks to the bulk investment, and Power Whip or Trop Kick will slowly beat it down. Trop Kick can be used over Power Whip for its accuracy, but you lose out on useful damage rolls like 2HKOing Diancie, 2HKOing Assault Vest Reuniclus after Stealth Rock, and OHKOing Krookodile. The Speed EVs ensure Tsareena outspeeds Modest Diancie before it can attack with Meteor Beam, but Tsareena can go even faster if it wants, with relevant targets including Modest Magnezone, Torterra, and Adamant Feraligatr. Tsareena will rarely want to Terastallize, but Tera Poison is nice to consistently answer Fighting-types like Mienshao and non-Meteor Mash Lucario and makes Tsareena immune to poison from Alolan Muk at the cost of becoming weak to Earthquake; Tera Dragon aids against Fire-types like Hisuian Typhlosion and retains several resistances to types like Water, Grass, and Electric; and Tera Steel is useful for checking Fairy- and Poison-types such as Sylveon and Munkidori as well as Cloyster.</p> <p>Tsareena creates great defensive cores with common entry hazard setters like Diancie and Rhyperior. They resist Fire and Flying for Tsareena, while it takes on Water- and Ground-type attacks in return. Its Knock Off support is also favored by many offensive Pokemon, specifically Fighting-types like Mienshao, Gallade, and Infernape, since Tsareena so frequently draws in Talonflame and removes its Heavy-Duty Boots. Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon like Choice Specs Chandelure, Choice Specs Noivern, and itemless Thundurus also desire Tsareena for its Rapid Spin.</p>"

Thwackey uses Wood Hammer to chip down walls like Registeel and Alolan Muk that sweepers like Oricorio-P and Uxie have trouble with. It can also clean up games with Grassy Glide, picking off weakened foes like Cincinno and Swampert. Against opposing Psychic Terrain teams, Thwackey's low Speed is a benefit, as it underspeeds Indeedee-M on lead and sets its Terrain second. Thwackey's pure Grass typing benefits it against foes like Basculegion-M and Flygon but leaves it open to being taken advantage of by attackers like Munkidori, Alolan Ninetales, and Infernape. While Thwackey does have a decent Attack stat, particularly with Grassy Terrain-boosted STAB attacks, its niche is entirely on Grassy Terrain teams, as its stats make it simply incapable of standing up against the metagame on its own.</p>",

However, when both are entering on the same turn, Thwackey underspeeds Indeedee-M and ensures Grassy Terrain is set; furthermore, its teammates are generally less dependent on Grassy Terrain to be useful than Indeedee-M's are on Psychic Terrain.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Chandelure and Incineroar are common and can force Thwackey to switch out rather than pivot with U-turn, forcing damage on its teammates.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Alolan Ninetales threatens Thwackey with powerful Ice-type attacks and can set Aurora Veil to protect its teammates.

U-turn allows Thwackey to cleanly pivot in its more powerful teammates while preserving itself to reset its Terrain later. Knock Off lets Thwackey hit foes like Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion and serves as useful utility. Thwackey can choose to run Terrain Extender to increase the duration of its Grassy Terrain, granting sweepers like Paldean Tauros-F, Grafaiai, and Diancie additional passive recovery and weakening Earthquake longer, or it can utilize Eviolite to boost its own bulk and thus survive to set its Terrain again later. It can choose from a number of useful Tera types; Poison gives it resistances to Close Combat from foes like Flamigo, U-turn from foes like Flygon, and Poison-type attacks from Munkidori and Alolan Muk. Tera Water allows it to resist Fire-type attacks from Chandelure and Incineroar while resisting Ice-type attacks from Inteleon.

Cincinno pairs well with the two Oricorio formes by removing entry hazards for them. Torterra in particular benefits from Grassy Terrain, boosting its powerful Grass-type STAB attacks to immense heights while allowing it to use Grassy Glide to defeat foes that are faster than it after a Shell Smash. The boost from Grassy Terrain even allows +2 Tera Grass Life Orb Torterra to OHKO Bronzong with Wood Hammer. Stealth Rock Meteor Beam Diancie and Fire-type attackers like Chandelure, Arcanine, and Paldean Tauros-F also work well with Thwackey, using Grassy Terrain to weaken Earthquake and restore their own HP. These sweepers also appreciate Spikes to weaken opposing walls and break Focus Sashes, so Klefki works well and itself benefits from Grassy Terrain weakening Earthquake. These teams can also appreciate Eject Pack or Eject Button users to pivot while preserving HP on Thwackey.

    "overview": "<p>Inteleon's Speed tier and sky-high Special Attack make it a formidable threat in NU. Not only is it blazing fast, but with Choice Specs, it's also quite powerful and can 2HKO many common special walls like Alolan Muk, Copperajah, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro on the switch with Hydro Pump. Even when facing Water-immune Pokemon like Gastrodon, Toxicroak, and Vaporeon, Inteleon still has a way to flip the matchup in its favor in its U-turn, which lets it bring in teammates like Breloom, Flygon, and Toxicroak to take advantage of these checks. On the other hand, Inteleon does face a bit of competition from Basculegion-M and Paldean Tauros-W, as the former can switch up its moves because it largely uses Mystic Water, the latter has Intimidate, and both have access to priority and easily fit coverage for Toxicroak; however, it isn't hindered by contact punishment such as Talonflame's Flame Body and Vileplume's Rocky Helmet and Effect Spore. It also has to deal with not being able to use its strongest move when up against teams with Water-immune Pokemon, which greatly halts Inteleon's progress-making, as it's almost always forced to use U-turn against them if it doesn't want to give up momentum.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Inteleon can also run a Scope Lens + Sniper set that is similar to its Choice Specs moveset except with Hydro Pump being traded out for Snipe Shot. When landing a critical hit, Inteleon can dent many Pokemon, but its unreliability makes it weaker overall. Choice Scarf Inteleon reaches a blisteringly fast Speed tier and, with its high Special Attack and U-turn, easily revenge kills many setup sweepers and can create momentum. A moveset of Hydro Pump / Ice Beam / U-turn / Taunt can be run alongside Heavy-Duty Boots to bother passive Pokemon that would easily take advantage of Inteleon otherwise like Alolan Muk, Vaporeon, and Bronzong. Inteleon can drop U-turn in favor of running a second STAB move, like Surf or Snipe Shot, alongside Hydro Pump, letting it choose the right move depending on its situation; however, losing momentum versus Water-immune and -resistant Pokemon can be annoying at times. Tera Blast Grass can be run to snipe Water-immune Pokemon like Vaporeon and Gastrodon, but because Inteleon has to Terastallize to make use of it and already has access to U-turn, it typically is unnecessary and thus isn't used.

However, with access to U-turn and strong coverage moves, Inteleon can find ways around these matchups.</p> <p><strong>Water- and Dragon-types</strong>: Basculegion-M and Milotic can switch into Inteleon's Hydro Pump and Ice Beam and proceed to use it for momentum, but neither of them enjoy switching in on a Dark Pulse. Similarly, Dragalge can take Inteleon's Hydro Pump decently but dislikes having to take an Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Brambleghast, Tsareena, and Breloom can take Inteleon's Hydro Pump and proceed to KO it with their Grass-type STAB moves, but they can't do this repeatedly. Similarly, bulkier Grass-types like Brute Bonnet and Vileplume can switch into Hydro Pump and threaten with Seed Bomb or Giga Drain, respectively; however, the former's lack of recovery and the latter's poor Special Defense leads them to being overwhelmed. On top of this, all of these Grass-types must fear Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to Inteleon's frailty, faster Pokemon like Kilowattrel and Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Munkidori easily threaten Inteleon with a KO and can use it for momentum, but they fail to switch in reliably with their lack of bulk.</p>",

Dark Pulse provides Inteleon with a coverage move so that it isn't completely useless against Water-types like Vaporeon and Basculegion-M. U-turn allows Inteleon to pivot on even Water-immune Pokemon like Gastrodon and Vaporeon. Instead of Ice Beam or Dark Pulse, Inteleon could opt for Air Slash to better target Toxicroak and Paldean Tauros-W, but its lower Base Power means that it's worse at breaking through other Water-immune and -resistant Pokemon. Tera Water boosts Inteleon's STAB move to insane levels, but Tera Ghost allows Inteleon to avoid priority like Breloom's Mach Punch and resist Flygon's First Impression while blanking high-Base Power attacks like Mienshao's and Infernape's Close Combat.</p> <p>Inteleon forces in bulky Water-immune and -resistant Pokemon like Gastrodon, Vaporeon, and Tsareena, and it can capitalize on this with U-turn, letting it bring in a threat that takes advantage of them like Brambleghast, Toxicroak, or Incineroar.

In return, Inteleon handles Fire- and Ground-types for the former two and can easily overwhelm physical walls Flygon brings in. Inteleon is quite powerful, but to achieve any of its 2HKOs, especially those against Water-type checks like Milotic and Vaporeon, it requires entry hazards to chip away at its foes; Copperajah, Bronzong, Gligar, and Klefki all synergize well to fill this role. Even without entry hazards, however, most special walls that do not resist Inteleon's STAB attacks like Bronzong, Alolan Muk, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro have a hard time switching in, as Bronzong is 2HKOed right away and Alolan Muk and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro are 2HKOed after minimal chip damage.

For example, Knock Off allows it to hit item-reliant Pokemon that commonly switch into it like Rotom-H and Incineroar, letting Copperajah's entry hazards chip away at them, and Whirlwind lets it phaze setup sweepers like Calm Mind Cresselia and Quiver Dance Oricorio-E. However, Copperajah's biggest problem is the lack of reliable recovery, making it a lot harder to consistently switch into special wallbreakers that have STAB attacks that it doesn't resist like Inteleon and Toxtricity. Copperajah also struggles to break through physical walls like Vileplume, Vaporeon, and Milotic, as they can tank its attacks and threaten it back with status.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An Assault Vest set with an EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe and an Adamant nature lets Copperajah outspeed foes like Registeel and Dragalge, tank hits from Porygon-Z and Kilowattrel, and be a menacing wallbreaker. Play Rough hits Fighting- and Dark-types like Mienshao, Breloom, and Wo-Chien, but it's rarely used. Supercell Slam targets bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Milotic, and Tentacruel. However, Copperajah struggles to fit it, and Supercell Slam's risk of recoil damage makes it very niche. Tera Water lets Copperajah better handle Ground- and Water-types like Flygon and Inteleon, but Tera Dragon is preferred for not giving it a weakness to Grass- and Electric-type attacks from Breloom and Kilowattrel. Tera Ghost gives Copperajah a useful immunity to Fighting-type attacks from foes like Mienshao and Toxicroak while spinblocking Tsareena and Brambleghast. However, these Pokemon usually can then proceed to hit it with super effective attacks like Knock Off and Poltergeist.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Mienshao, Toxicroak, Heracross, and Breloom destroy Copperajah with their STAB Close Combat, but none of them want to switch directly into its STAB attacks. Paldean Tauros-W resists Copperajah's STAB attacks, allowing it to either destroy Copperajah with its STAB Close Combat or force Copperajah to switch, giving it a free opportunity to use Bulk Up.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Vileplume, Vaporeon, and Milotic can tank Copperajah's attacks very well and threaten it back with status. Orthworm is notable for also taking Copperajah's attacks very well and either using it to set up entry hazards or hitting it back with Body Press.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Flygon, Swampert, and Gligar can KO Copperajah with their STAB Earthquake, but they don't enjoy switching into its Knock Off, and Flygon takes a lot of damage from its Iron Head.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion can put a lot of pressure on Copperajah with their STAB attacks, but they have to be cautious about switching into its Knock Off. Incineroar can force Copperajah to switch out, allowing it to freely set up with Swords Dance, or destroy Copperajah with its STAB Flare Blitz. Rotom-H can use Copperajah as setup fodder or cripple it heavily with Pain Split. However, Rotom-H doesn’t enjoy directly switching into its Knock Off.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Knock Off allows Copperajah to target item-reliant foes like Rotom-H, Kilowattrel, and Incineroar. For its last move, Copperajah commonly runs Whirlwind, allowing it to phaze bulky setup sweepers like Calm Mind Cresselia and Sylveon. Alternatively, Protect allows Copperajah to scout out Choice item attackers like Flygon, Mienshao, and Munkidori and gives it more Leftovers recovery. Earthquake hits Fire- and Poison-types like Chandelure and Galarian Slowbro and Steel-types like Registeel, Klefki, and opposing Copperajah. The Speed investment allows Copperajah to outpace Bronzong. Tera Dragon gives Copperajah a useful resistance to Fire-type attacks from foes like Chandelure and Rotom-H, while Tera Fairy gives it a better matchup against Flygon and Fighting-types like Mienshao and Breloom.</p> <p>Wish passers like Vaporeon and Sylveon provide massive recovery for Copperajah, letting it repeatedly switch into foes like Munkidori and Porygon-Z. Copperajah best synergizes with physical walls like Galarian Slowbro, Vileplume, and Vaporeon, as they can handle physical wallbreakers like Toxicroak, Paldean Tauros-W, and Basculegion-M. In return, Copperajah checks special wallbreakers like Munkidori, Kilowattrel, and Dragalge. Copperajah is forced out by Fire-types like Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion, as they can destroy it with their Fire-type attacks. Thus, it pairs well with Water- and Dragon-types like Vaporeon, Dragalge, and Goodra to check them. Copperajah appreciates Fairy- and Psychic-types like Sylveon, Cresselia, and Diancie, as they can handle foes like Heracross, Flygon, and Incineroar. Wallbreakers such as Flygon, Overqwil, and Paldean Tauros-W appreciate Copperajah's strength, since unlike other Steel-types such as Bronzong, Klefki, and Registeel, it can wear down physical walls like Gligar, Galarian Slowbro, and Swampert.</p>"

  "Basculegion": {
    "overview": "<p>Basculegion-M's solid Attack stat, supported by two amazing abilities and high-Base Power STAB moves, makes it one of the most potent wallbreakers available in the tier. An Adaptability-boosted Wave Crash is capable of doing immense damage to bulky walls like Registeel and Swampert and even gets good chip on bulky Water-resistant Pokemon like Milotic and Tsareena. Alternatively, Basculegion-M can opt for Swift Swim on rain teams, becoming an extremely menacing Pokemon that can outspeed and power through bulky and offensive teams alike. While not having much in terms of type coverage, Basculegion-M has access to a solid movepool. Most notably, access to Aqua Jet lets it act as a revenge killer, picking off faster Pokemon such as Cinccino, Infernape, and Munkidori with ease. However, the lack of a reliable physical Ghost-type STAB move hurts Basculegion-M greatly, making it susceptible to Pokemon that it otherwise would have a chance against, namely bulky Water-types such as Vaporeon and Gastrodon. Additionally, Basculegion-M's Speed is rather average, leaving it susceptible to being revenge killed by common Pokemon such as Kilowattrel and Brambleghast as well as Choice Scarf users like Infernape, Rotom-C, and Munkidori as well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A mixed attacking Assault Vest set can function as a decent bulky offensive pivot, leveraging Basculegion-M's solid special bulk against common special attackers like Munkidori. However, Basculegion-M's typing leaves it vulnerable to common special attackers such as Chandelure, Kilowattrel, and Rotom-C, making its defensive use somewhat inconsistent. Additionally, the lack of reliable recovery makes it prone to being chipped down over time, forcing it to be paired with a Wish user and making it much less efficient into common threats. Choice Specs Basculegion-M is a decent option, with its stronger coverage options in Shadow Ball and Ice Beam, alongside Adaptability, compensating for its otherwise middling Special Attack stat. This set can threaten typical counterplay to physical Basculegion-M sets such as Vaporeon, Toxicroak, Dragalge, and Amoonguss with either Shadow Ball or Ice Beam.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-immune Pokemon</strong>: Vaporeon is an excellent answer to Basculegion-M thanks to Water Absorb making it immune to Basculegion-M's Water-type STAB moves alongside strong physical bulk with investment making it hardly deterred by any of Basculegion-M's coverage moves. Gastrodon functions similarly, albeit with more reliable recovery with Recover and the ability to turn Basculegion-M's Water-type moves into an opportunity for offensive momentum thanks to Storm Drain. Toxicroak can also switch into Basculegion-M's Water-type moves courtesy of Dry Skin and use Basculegion-M as fodder for setting up Swords Dance. However, Psychic Fangs obliterates Toxicroak, so it must be mindful of Basculegion-M's choice of coverage.</p> <p><strong>Water- and Dragon-types</strong>: Milotic is generally a solid check to Basculegion-M thanks to Recover giving it extremely important longevity as well as Flip Turn letting Milotic use Basculegion-M as a chance to gain momentum. Inteleon can generally switch into Basculegion-M once and, in return, outspeed and OHKO Basculegion-M with Dark Pulse after some chip damage. Dragalge's solid physical bulk lets it come in on Basculegion-M's Water-type STAB moves and either wear it down with Sludge Bomb or finish it off with Draco Meteor. Paldean Tauros-W's high physical bulk combined with Intimidate and Bulk Up lets it easily come in on Basculegion-M's Water-type STAB moves, but it must exercise caution against sets with Psychic Fangs.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tsareena are able to handle Basculegion-M's Water-type moves outside of rain quite effectively and can overwhelm it with their STAB moves. Amoonguss in particular can also take advantage of Basculegion-M's presence for longevity with Giga Drain and Toxic. However, both of these Pokemon must be wary of Choice Band Ice Fang, as they are vulnerable to being 2HKOed by it. Amoonguss also must look out for Psychic Fangs.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Basculegion-M's bulk, while decent, leaves it vulnerable to various faster Pokemon with super effective coverage. Dark-types and Pokemon with Dark-type coverage such as Infernape, Cinccino, and Inteleon can all OHKO Basculegion-M with their respective Dark-type attacks after some minor chip damage. Other faster offensive Pokemon such as Tsareena, Kilowattrel, and Rotom-C can overwhelm Basculegion-M with super effective moves. However, all of these Pokemon have to be wary of Basculegion-M under rain, and non-Choice Scarf variants have to fear a possible Choice Scarf on Basculegion-M, as the majority of them are susceptible to being OHKOed by Basculegion-M's Wave Crash.</p>",

      "Substitute": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Basculegion-M can opt for either a physical or special set, and they both come with their benefits and drawbacks. A physical set is more easily walled, but its Liquidation gets to come off its higher Attack. Additionally, Phantom Force being a two-turn attack means it may not always hit Basculegion-M's desired target, though it always gets a free turn of healing from Leftovers. On the other hand, a specially oriented Substitute Basculegion-M has access to reliable moves for both of its STAB types, isn't as held back by four-moveslot syndrome as physical sets are, and can surprise physical walls. However, this comes at a price of its noticeably lower Special Attack. Aqua Jet lets Basculegion-M safely pick off foes like Cinccino, Munkidori, and Infernape at low health, ensuring neither it nor its Substitute takes damage. Endeavor capitalizes on Substitute lowering Basculegion-M's HP, letting it cut down the HP of walls that it can struggle with like Vaporeon, Avalugg, and Amoonguss. On the other hand, Pain Split lets Basculegion-M simply recover some HP while simultaneously dealing damage. Leftovers is preferred, since it provides passive healing, mitigating Substitute's impact on Basculegion-M's HP. However, Metronome can capitalize on Substitute giving Basculegion-M free turns, letting it continually attack and more easily beat Vaporeon and Gastrodon, and Heavy-Duty Boots means Basculegion-M doesn't need to worry about constant chip damage from entry hazards, though this forces Basculegion-M to run Pain Split if it wishes to have any form of recovery. Jolly and Timid natures can also be used so that Basculegion-M outspeeds Tsareena, Breloom, and Toxicroak, but the wallbreaking power of Adamant and Modest is typically better. Tera Water increases the power of both Liquidation and Surf, letting Basculegion-M break through walls more easily, while Tera Dark allows it to take Ghost-type attacks from Chandelure and opposing Basculegion-M as well as Dark-type moves like Incineroar's Knock Off if necessary.</p> <p>Gastrodon and Roar Vaporeon are the main roadblocks for Basculegion-M, so partners that can help pressure them like Breloom, Toxicroak, and Freeze-Dry Alolan Ninetales make for good pairings. In return, Basculegion-M can whittle down Amoonguss for Breloom as well as take care of Galarian Slowbro and Bronzong for Toxicroak and Alolan Ninetales. Pivots like Munkidori, Flygon, and Whimsicott that draw in Pokemon that Basculegion-M can set Substitute on and take advantage of, like Bronzong, Vaporeon, and Toxicroak, are greatly appreciated, though Basculegion-M must be cautious of Toxicroak's Knock Off sets. Substitute Basculegion-M sets excel at weakening defensive Water-resistant Pokemon like Amoonguss, Milotic, and Tentacruel, meaning it can pave the way for partners like Flygon, Incineroar, and Paldean Tauros-F. Avalugg is often a hard check to get past for Basculegion-M, but specially oriented sets are good at luring it in and dealing great damage. This can be capitalized on by physical attackers like Overqwil, Scyther, and Flygon. Faster Ghost-types such as Hisuian Typhlosion, Chandelure, and Brambleghast can be problematic for Basculegion-M, causing Ghost-resistant and -immune teammates like Incineroar, Scrafty, Porygon2, and Dudunsparce to be necessary. Powerful Grass-, Electric-, and Dark-type Pokemon like Breloom, Kilowattrel, and Incineroar can stop Basculegion-M from keeping up its Substitute, so checks to these Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Bellibolt, and Diancie make for good partners.</p>"

      "Rain Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Liquidation acts as a recoil-free alternative to Wave Crash at the cost of lower power. This is especially useful late-game, where Basculegion-M can wreck through weakened foes while still maintaining some health as to not be too vulnerable to revenge killers. Alternatively, Aqua Jet has more use outside of rain, being a useful priority tool to revenge kill faster Pokemon like Infernape, Munkidori, and Cinccino. For Basculegion-M's last move, it tends to opt for Tera Blast alongside Tera Ghost, as it gifts Basculegion-M a powerful and reliable physical Ghost-type STAB move to hit Water-resistant and -immune Pokemon like Vaporeon, Toxicroak, Milotic, and Tsareena. However, it forces Basculegion-M to Terastallize, so it can be off-putting at times as an option. Because of this, Psychic Fangs can be used as alternative to hit Vaporeon neutrally while also hitting checks like Toxicroak and Amoonguss super effectively. Ice Fang is another option that hits Dragon- and Grass-types like Dragalge, Tsareena, and Amoonguss attempting to switch into Basculegion-M's Water-type attacks. If not running Tera Blast, Tera Water can further boost Basculegion-M's already monstrous offensive profile, letting it 2HKO bulky Water-resistant Pokemon such as Dragalge, Amoonguss, and Tsareena with Wave Crash.</p> <p>Choice Band Basculegion-M is a premier threat on rain teams thanks to its immense power and Swift Swim boosting its Speed. As a result, rain setters such as Klefki and Tornadus are necessary picks. In addition to setting rain, the former has access to a vast array of utility moves such as Thunder Wave, which cripples Choice Scarf users like Infernape and Inteleon, and Spikes, while the latter can use rain itself to break through Grass-types like Amoonguss, Wo-Chien, and Tsareena. Other Swift Swim Pokemon such as Kingdra, Overqwil, and Ludicolo have solid synergy with Basculegion-M. Kingdra can overwhelm Vaporeon, Toxicroak, and Dragalge, making it less needed for Basculegion-M to Terastallize to hit these Pokemon. Overqwil can function as a late-game cleaner that appreciates Basculegion-M's insane wallbreaking letting it finish off games more easily, as it's able to finish off weakened foes. Ludicolo's Grass-type STAB moves and Ice-type coverage can be monumental in turning the tides against bulky Water-, Grass-, and Dragon- types like Gastrodon, Vaporeon, Amoonguss, and Dragalge. Other entry hazard setters such as Gligar, Flygon, and Swampert make for good teammates, further bolstering Basculegion-M's wallbreaking capabilities.</p>"

      "All-out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Aqua Jet gives Mystic Water sets a way to pick off faster Pokemon like Chandelure, Cinccino, and Munkidori, while Liquidation helps out Choice Scarf sets by providing a less risky version of Wave Crash with more PP and no recoil. Aqua Jet can even find use on Choice Scarf variants as a means to combat faster Choice Scarf users like Munkidori. Psychic Fangs provides solid coverage, hitting Poison-types that can take Water-type moves like Dragalge, Toxicroak, and Amoonguss. Ice Fang instead targets Grass- and Dragon-types like Tsareena, Amoonguss, Flygon, and Dragalge, albeit being weaker into the aforementioned Poison-type Pokemon. Mystic Water in tandem with Adaptability makes Basculegion-M's Water-type STAB moves extremely menacing while allowing it to switch its moves. This is further boosted by Tera Water, which makes Basculegion-M's Water-type attacks monstrously strong, doing immense damage to even the bulkiest of physically defensive Pokemon like Avalugg. Alternatively, Choice Scarf patches up Basculegion-M's otherwise average Speed and makes it a formidable revenge killer in its own right. Despite this, Basculegion-M's average Speed stat prevents it from being consistent as a revenge killer, as other Choice Scarf users such as Flygon, Infernape, Munkidori, and Porygon-Z can effectively outspeed and threaten it.</p> <p>All-out attacker Basculegion-M benefits many balance, bulky offense, and offense teams thanks to its ability to easily wallbreak and, if carrying Choice Scarf, its surprise factor as well. Entry hazard setters like Flygon, Swampert, and Diancie can set up Stealth Rock and Spikes, whittling down foes for Basculegion-M to more easily overwhelm. Hazard removal from the likes of Cinccino, Avalugg, and Tsareena is heavily appreciated, increasing Basculegion-M's longevity and making it more capable offensively late-game. Basculegion-M tends to draw in bulky Water- and Grass-types like Vaporeon, Amoonguss, Gastrodon, and Tsareena. As a result, offensive Pokemon that can capitalize on these foes, namely Toxicroak, Incineroar, Rotom-C, and Staraptor, can form potent wallbreaking cores with Basculegion-M. Additionally, the last three Pokemon can reliably bring Basculegion-M in with their pivot moves, giving Basculegion-M an easier time entering battle. Dark-types like Incineroar, Alolan Muk, Scrafty, and Bombirdier can counteract opposing Dark- and Ghost-types and use their presence as an opportunity to generate offensive momentum through pivoting, wearing down foes over time with Knock Off, and, in the case of the first two, status. Setup Pokemon that can boost Speed such as Dragon Dance Flygon and Tidy Up Cinccino, as well as those that increase their physical bulk like Iron Defense Registeel and Bulk Up Scrafty, can pose a problem to Choice Scarf Basculegion-M, as either Basculegion-M's average Speed stat or the lack of an additional power boost can let it down against these threats. Thus, Pokemon that can check these foes such as Orthworm, Chandelure, and Sylveon are appreciated, providing some solid defensive backbone for Basculegion-M to fall back upon. In return, these Pokemon heavily appreciate Basculegion-M's strong offensive presence.</p>"

With how common stat-dropping moves and abilities are in NU, Kilowattrel's Competitive allows it to capitalize on Vileplume's Strength Sap and both Paldean Tauros-W's and Incineroar's Intimidate. On top of that, Kilowattrel being able to fire off a powerful Volt Switch or an unblockable U-turn helps it keep up pressure and momentum, and this aids Kilowattrel with wearing down checks like Diancie, Registeel, and Bronzong. Kilowattrel's counters aren't that common; however, whenever Kilowattrel comes across one like Bellibolt or Rotom-H, it struggles to deal with them and is forced to pivot, giving away free turns. Kilowattrel's low bulk also can be detrimental, as Choice Scarf users like Mienshao can 2HKO it with even a resisted Close Combat. Even Pokemon Kilowattrel would normally take out can beat Kilowattrel one-on-one if they have access to priority moves, like Sucker Punch Toxicroak and Aqua Jet Basculegion, due to its disappointing bulk.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Kilowattrel can opt for a Choice Specs set to more easily wallbreak, but its weakness to Stealth Rock combined with how much it loves to pivot leads to it usually being worn down too quickly. Kilowattrel can run Weather Ball on rain and snow teams to hit Ground-types like Swampert, Gligar, and Flygon harder than Air Slash can, and notably, Weather Ball on snow teams lets Hurricane Kilowattrel easily dispatch Wind Rider Brambleghast. Thunder is also great for more power on rain teams, taking advantage of the weather. Tera Ghost can be used to avoid a powerful Close Combat from Choice Scarf Mienshao, Heracross, and Paldean Tauros-W; however, the defensive utility that Tera Steel gives Kilowattrel is usually preferred.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Bellibolt, Rotom-H, and Volt Absorb Kilowattrel all can switch into Kilowattrel, wall it repeatedly, and capitalize on their free turn by gaining momentum or, in Rotom-H's case, setting up. The former must be wary of Tera Blast Ground sets, though.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Copperajah, Bronzong, and Registeel easily switch in to Kilowattrel's Air Slash and Hurricane. Since Kilowattrel has to pivot or switch out after they switch in, they can take advantage of their free turn by setting entry hazards or, in the latter two's case, boosting their stats.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority Users</strong>: Kilowattrel's frailty leaves it open to being quite easily revenge killed by even resisted hits from Choice Scarf users; for example, it gets 2HKOed by Mienshao's Close Combat. Neutral hits from other Choice Scarf users also extremely hurt like Munkidori's Sludge Wave and Inteleon's Hydro Pump. Additionally, priority users like Toxicroak and Mystic Water Basculegion can heavily threaten Kilowattrel, since the former can OHKO it at +2 with a Tera Dark-boosted Sucker Punch, and the latter can 2HKO it with Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Gastrodon</strong>: Gastrodon can both block Kilowattrel's Electric-type STAB moves and can take both Air Slash and Hurricane relatively comfortably; it even has access to recovery and often runs Ice Beam. Because of this, when up against Gastrodon, Kilowattrel is either forced to use U-turn or switch out, giving Gastrodon the chance to set up entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Diancie can tank Kilowattrel's attacks quite well, and it can use it as an opportunity to set up Trick Room or set its entry hazards up. Coalossal can also soak up its attacks and set up hazards. However, they must be cautious of Tera Blast Ground variants.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Air Slash is preferred, as it is more accurate and can hit Wind Rider Brambleghast, but Hurricane can be used on teams that can handle it through other means. Volt Switch lets Kilowattrel take advantage of Competitive's Special Attack boosts better; however, U-turn helps it keep up momentum in the face of Ground-types like Gastrodon, Flygon, and Swampert. Tera Blast Fairy can even be used, as it lets Kilowattrel hit Flygon super effectively while blanking its Outrage and Scale Shot. On top of that, it lets Kilowattrel maintain its Fighting resistance and gives it a solid defensive typing. Tera Blast Ground is another option that lets Kilowattrel dispatch Diancie, Bellibolt, and Registeel, since they can be annoying for Kilowattrel to get past at times. Roost allows Kilowattrel to continually pivot and gain value from its Competitive, and it can help counteract Life Orb chip damage. Heavy-Duty Boots is preferred to let Kilowattrel come in safely and repeatedly during a match. Alternatively, Life Orb can by used on more offensive teamstyles that can both keep up enough pressure to prevent Stealth Rock from being set up and take advantage of the extra boost it gives Kilowattrel. Competitive allows Kilowattrel to capitalize on common Pokemon's abilities and moves like both Overqwil's and Incineroar's Intimidate as well as Vileplume's Strength Sap. On the other hand, Volt Absorb can be run to take advantage of Galvantula, Rotom-C, and opposing Competitive Kilowattrel. Tera Steel allows Kilowattrel to resist many common attacks like Cinccino's Tail Slap, Inteleon's Ice Beam, and Munkidori's Sludge Wave and Psychic.</p> <p>Entry hazard setters like Klefki, Flygon, Copperajah, and Gligar are great partners for Kilowattrel, as their hazards can punish the opponent's switches, while Kilowattrel helps keep the hazards up by pressuring stray Defoggers like Scyther and Decidueye. Similarly, Kilowattrel can work with hyper offense leads like Galvantula, Araquanid, and Froslass. While Kilowattrel can pressure Defoggers, it fails to stop spinners like Brambleghast, Avalugg, and Tsareena, so pairing it with a Ghost-type like Basculegion, Brambleghast, or Hisuian Typhlosion is a good idea. Kilowattrel can pressure Water-types like Vaporeon, Milotic, and Basculegion quite easily, meaning Pokemon that struggle dealing with them or can force them in like Flygon, Incineroar, and Inteleon have good synergy. Special walls like Gastrodon, Copperajah, and Bronzong can be difficult to take down alone, so physical wallbreakers like Incineroar, Breloom, and Mienshao are great to deal with them, and Kilowattrel can form VoltTurn cores with many of them. Electric- and Rock-types like Bellibolt, Volt Absorb Kilowattrel, and Diancie are difficult for Kilowattrel to KO; because of this, Ground-type teammates like Flygon, Gastrodon, and Palossand make for good partners. Since Life Orb Kilowattrel is highly susceptible to being worn down by Stealth Rock, a hazard-removing teammate like Cinccino, Tsareena, or Brambleghast is appreciated, especially the former thanks to the offensive pressure it exerts.</p>"

Additionally, Brambleghast is a great wallbreaker, since not many Pokemon can take both of its STAB attacks. Choice Band makes Brambleghast into a dangerous threat, as defensive foes like Amoonguss and Tsareena get 2HKOed by Poltergeist on the switch. However, Brambleghast's poor bulk makes it poor at checking wallbreakers like Heracross, Flygon, and Paldean Tauros-W, as they can threaten it with a 2HKO from their coverage or Choice Band-boosted attacks, forcing Brambleghast to constantly use Strength Sap. Additionally, Brambleghast's typing leaves it weak to common Dark- and Fire-types like Alolan Muk, Incineroar, and Chandelure.

Night Shade lets Brambleghast do consistent damage against Dark-types like Bombirdier and Alolan Muk.

Tera Water gives it a useful resistance against Fire-type attacks, but it makes Brambleghast weak to other Grass-types like Tsareena and Rotom-C.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Incineroar, Alolan Muk, and Bombirdier resist both of Brambleghast's STAB attacks and can destroy it with their own STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion destroy Brambleghast with their STAB attacks. Hisuian Typhlosion can outspeed Brambleghast, while Chandelure requires a Choice Scarf to outspeed it, but they are wary of switching into its Poltergeist and can be picked off by Shadow Sneak. Infernape outspeeds Brambleghast, and it can threaten it back with a KO from its Flare Blitz. However, Infernape doesn't enjoy directly switching into Poltergeist.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Amoonguss and Avalugg can tank Brambleghast's attacks and both of them having recovery makes it a lot more difficult for Brambleghast to break through them. However, Amoonguss can't directly switch into Choice Band Brambleghast, as it gets 2HKOed. Other physical walls like Dragalge, Galarian Slowbro, and bulky Tsareena can tank Choice Banded Brambleghast's attacks and threaten it back with their own attacks, but they have to predict correctly or they take significant damage.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster foes like Inteleon, Munkidori, and Air Slash Kilowattrel can threaten Brambleghast with their attacks due to its poor bulk or use it for momentum, but they don't enjoy switching into Brambleghast's STAB attacks. Priority users like First Impression Flygon and Sucker Punch Toxicroak can easily revenge kill Brambleghast after it's been weakened.</p>",

However, Spikes can be used instead, letting Brambleghast become a solid entry hazard setter. Alternatively, Shadow Sneak lets it revenge kill weakened foes like Flygon, Munkidori, and Infernape. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Brambleghast ignore entry hazards, meaning it can more reliably remove them, while Colbur Berry lets it tank Dark-type attacks such as Infernape's Knock Off and Toxicroak's Sucker Punch, letting Brambleghast use Strength Sap on them or hit them back with its STAB attacks. Brambleghast can run a defensive set with an EV spread of 252 HP / 80 Def / 176 Spe and a Jolly nature on utility sets, as it lets Brambleghast better handle physical wallbreakers like Paldean Tauros-W, Flygon, and Breloom while letting it outspeed base 80 Speed Pokemon like Chandelure. Tera Fairy provides a Dark resistance while not throwing away its matchup into Fighting-types and Flygon. Alternatively, Tera Ghost gives both Poltergeist and Shadow Sneak a power boost, letting it 2HKO foes like Amoonguss, Dragalge, and Copperajah with the former.</p> <p>Fighting-types like Infernape, Toxicroak, and Heracross are great partners for Brambleghast, as they can check Dark-types like Incineroar, Alolan Muk, and Umbreon; in return, Brambleghast pressures Ghost- and bulky Psychic-types like Chandelure, Uxie, and Galarian Slowbro. Incineroar is an exceptionally great partner for Brambleghast due to how it beats Grass-, Steel-, and Dark-types for Brambleghast, and in return, Brambleghast can check Fighting-, Ground-, and Water-types for Incineroar. Fire-types like Choice Scarf Chandelure and Infernape outspeed Brambleghast and destroy it with their STAB attacks. Thus, it best pairs with bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Milotic, and Tentacruel to check the aforementioned Fire-types. Faster Pokemon like Flygon, Infernape, and Kilowattrel can easily revenge kill Brambleghast, so it synergizes well with defensive tanks like Sylveon, Galarian Slowbro, and Diancie that check them. Brambleghast appreciates special wallbreakers like Munkidori, Inteleon, and Kilowattrel for handling physical walls like Vileplume and Avalugg. Brambleghast can spinblock for hazard setters like Bronzong, Diance, and Swampert. Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon like Chandelure, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Staraptor that won't have Heavy-Duty Boots appreciate Brambleghast for its hazard removal.</p>"

Shadow Sneak lets Brambleghast pick off weakened foes like Flygon and Breloom. Tera Blast Ghost is a good alternative to Poltergeist, as it neither requires the foe to have an item nor can it miss. Tera Blast Ground could be used to hit common walls like Incineroar and Alolan Muk, but because Brambleghast needs to Terastallize for it to work and it almost always prefers a reliable Ghost-type STAB move, it isn't run.</p> <p>Ground-types like Flygon, Gligar, and Swampert appreciate Brambleghast for checking Water-types like Vaporeon, Milotic, and Paldean Tauros-W; in return, they can handle Fire-types like Incineroar and Chandelure.

Choice Scarf allows Flamigo to outspeed normally faster Pokemon like Inteleon and Cinccino.

  "Munkidori": {
    "overview": "<p>Munkidori is a strong special attacker and pivot. Its typing allows it to hit much of the tier for at least neutral damage with its STAB moves, with Sludge Bomb and Sludge Wave targeting Fairy- and Grass-types like Sylveon and Tsareena, while Psychic and Psyshock target Poison- and Fighting-types like Vileplume and Breloom. Munkidori's Nasty Plot set loves to capitalize on the switches that it forces against these Pokemon, and with its excellent Speed tier, it can outspeed common threats like Mienshao and Flygon. Munkidori's U-turn is also incredibly potent, as it easily spreads poison with Toxic Chain to chip away at walls like Diancie, Incineroar, and Umbreon so that it can KO them more easily later. It also runs moves like Focus Blast and Tera Blast Ground to hit its poison-immune checks such as Steel-types like Copperajah and Registeel and Poison-types like Alolan Muk. Trick can also limit opposing setup sweepers like Cresselia and Iron Thorns or cripple specially defensive walls upon switch-in like Bronzong and Alolan Muk. However, Munkidori is vulnerable to opposing Dark-types like Incineroar and Brute Bonnet and can be limited by Steel-types if not carrying sufficient coverage. Its poor bulk also means it can be easily revenge killed by faster Choice Scarf users like Inteleon and Infernape or Pokemon with priority such as Sucker Punch Toxicroak and Aqua Jet Basculegion.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fake Out is a niche option that can be used on Toxic Chain sets with the intention of giving Munkidori as many opportunities as possible to poison the opposing Pokemon. Parting Shot can also be used as an alternative to U-turn, avoiding contact and lowering the foe's stats, but Munkidori's main draw is its ability to poison Pokemon without having to waste a turn using a status move like Toxic. Psychic Noise can also be used on pivot sets while attempting to chip down bulkier foes, preventing them from recovering while a more effective attacker switches in. Shadow Ball can be run alongside Tera Ghost to hit Bronzong, which otherwise walls Munkidori, and it can provide an immunity to priority moves like Mienshao's Fake Out and Breloom's Mach Punch. Grass Knot is a niche option alongside Tera Grass to target potential threats like specially defensive Swampert and Gastrodon but leaves Munkidori helpless against Steel-types. Tera Fairy can also be used as an alternative to Tera Fighting that maintains Munkidori's resistance to Fighting-type attacks at the cost of the potential boost to Focus Blast. Frisk is an option to regularly gain information on the foe's items but loses the potential status effects and chip damage of Toxic Chain.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types, such as Incineroar, Brute Bonnet, and Tera Dark Toxicroak are immune to Munkidori's Psychic-type STAB moves and threaten it back with powerful moves like Knock Off and Sucker Punch. However, with access to moves like Sludge Wave, Focus Blast, Tera Blast Ground and the ability to Terastallize into a Dark-resistant Tera type, they must be cautious.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Copperajah, Klefki, and Registeel can handle Munkidori's STAB attacks easily, forcing it to rely on coverage like Focus Blast and Tera Blast Ground or its teammates to break through. They also are immune to poison, preventing Munkidori from wearing them down with Toxic Chain.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: While Munkidori, particularly with Choice Scarf, is quite fast, it can be outsped and its physical bulk is somewhat lacking, meaning faster Choice Scarf users like Inteleon and Infernape and priority such as Basculegion's Aqua Jet and Brute Bonnet's Sucker Punch can easily pick it off it its health gets low enough.</p> <p><strong>Specially defensive Poison-types</strong>: Alolan Muk and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro can be difficult for Munkidori to break through due to their bulk, strong defensive typing, and immunity to being poisoned.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sludge Bomb provides a greater chance of poisoning the foe, while Sludge Wave provides greater power. Psychic targets physically defensive walls like Vileplume and Galarian Slowbro, notably OHKOing Vileplume after Stealth Rock. However, Psyshock gives Munkidori an answer to specially defensive Poison-types like Tentacruel and Tera Poison Calm Mind Cresselia. U-turn lets Munkidori pivot and possibly poison specially defensive walls switching in like Diancie and Umbreon. Focus Blast targets Steel-types like Copperajah and Dark-types like Incineroar, 2HKOing both. Tera Blast Ground is a viable alternative that better targets Alolan Muk, which is 2HKOed after Stealth Rock. On Choice Scarf sets, Trick allows Munkidori to cripple walls like Alolan Muk and Registeel and setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Flygon and Calm Mind Cresselia. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Munkidori to pivot frequently and lets it not be locked into a move. On the other hand, Choice Scarf makes Munkidori one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, as it is only outsped by opposing Choice Scarf users like Infernape and Inteleon. Tera Fighting works twofold; it lets Munkidori resist Dark-type attacks and boosts the power of Focus Blast. Tera Ground, however, should only be used alongside Tera Blast. A defensive Tera type of Tera Flying also works on Munkidori, as it helps it avoid Earthquake from Flygon and retains its Fighting resistance.</p> <p>Munkidori benefits from teammates that can break through special walls, such as Copperajah, Bronzong, and Alolan Muk, that it struggles to deal with itself. Physical wallbreakers like Gallade, Infernape, and Mienshao help to take care of the specially defensive Steel- and Dark- types that might otherwise give Munkidori trouble. In return, Munkidori handles physical walls like Vileplume, Dragalge, Sylveon, and Avalugg. Entry hazard setters like Swampert and Klefki can be useful teammates, as their hazards alongside Munkidori's constant pivoting and threat of poison can help wear down foes over time and get them into range for Munkidori to finish them off. The poison caused by Toxic Chain makes bulky teammates like Avalugg, Vaporeon, and Sylveon good teammates, as it lets them stall out foes more easily with poison chipping away at them.</p>"

Focus Blast lets Munkidori deal with Umbreon and Copperajah more easily, but boosted Tera Blast Ground can be used, as it handles Alolan Muk and Incineroar more reliably. U-turn could also be used as a last move so that Munkidori can support its team early-game, but it then heavily relies on its teammates to deal with Steel-types. Heavy Duty-Boots allows Munkidori to repeatedly switch in without concern for entry hazard chip damage, letting it use Nasty Plot repeatedly over the course of a battle. Tera Fighting is used to further boost Focus Blast's damage while letting Munkidori resist Dark-type attacks, while Tera Ground is used alongside Tera Blast to blow through checks like Alolan Muk. Tera Flying is used defensively against opposing Ground-type attackers like Swampert or Flygon, providing additional opportunities to boost with Nasty Plot.</p> <p>Pokemon that can overwhelm opposing Steel- and Dark-types are appreciated by Munkidori, so teammates like Cinccino, Porygon-Z, and Brambleghast pair well with it.
