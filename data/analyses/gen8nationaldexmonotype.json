However, the immediate damage output from Swords Dance and Close Combat is generally preferred. Substitute may be used to help Mega Gallade set up against passive Pokemon like Toxapex while avoiding status conditions from foes like Mega Sableye and Rotom-W, and it is opted for on Bulk Up sets, but it forces Mega Gallade to give up Knock Off or Shadow Sneak which are preferred in most cases.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Psychic</h4> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-type Pokemon like Mega Diancie and Mimikyu can threaten to OHKO Mega Gallade with their powerful STAB moves. However, Mega Diancie needs to be wary of Mega Gallade winning the speed tie, while Mimikyu is easily threatened if Disguise is broken. Bulky Fairy-types like Hatterene can also check Mega Gallade effectively.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-type Pokemon such as Gengar and Choice Scarf Blacephalon can outspeed and OHKO Mega Gallade with their Ghost-type STAB moves. However, they need to be wary of Shadow Sneak.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Physically defensive walls such as Mega Slowbro and Mega Sableye can easily switch in against Mega Gallade and proceed to burn it with Scald or Will-O-Wisp, respectively. Mega Sableye in particular is immune to both of Mega Gallade's STAB options and takes reduced damage from Knock Off, completely walling Mega Gallade.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny, Zeraora, Tapu Koko, and Choice Scarf Latios can all threaten to KO Mega Gallade after very little chip damage. However, Pokemon weak to Shadow Sneak like Latios need to watch out for it.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: All forms of status can cripple Mega Gallade greatly. Poison puts Mega Gallade on a timer, limiting its ability to act as a reliable wallbreaker. Paralysis allows Mega Gallade to easily be revenge killed. Burn greatly weakens it as a wallbreaker.</p>",

        "description": "<p>An excellent Speed tier, a sky-high Attack stat, and a great secondary type in Fighting that aids greatly against Steel and Dark teams make Mega Gallade an amazing physical wallbreaker on Psychic teams. Swords Dance allows Mega Gallade to further increase its already high Attack stat, allowing it to easily break through a majority of teams and walls like Celesteela. Close Combat is Mega Gallade's primary STAB option, dealing with troublesome Steel-, Dark-, Normal-, and Rock-types like Bisharp, Zarude, Porygon2, and Tyranitar. Zen Headbutt allows it to deal with Poison- and Fighting-types like Mega Venusaur, Toxapex, and Keldeo. Psycho Cut can be used in lieu of Zen Headbutt at the cost of some Base Power as a more accurate option that also avoids damage from Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin, as well as Poison from Toxapex's Baneful Bunker. Knock Off helps against opposing Psychic-types like Slowbro and Victini that resist both of Mega Gallade's STAB options while also helping with Ghost-types like Galarian Corsola and Aegislash. Knock Off also gets rid of items like Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots, crippling the foe as a result. Shadow Sneak can be used instead of Knock Off as a form of priority that also helps against fast Psychic- and Ghost-types like Latios and Choice Scarf Blacephalon. However, Knock Off is generally preferred for the increased power against bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types like Slowbro and Galarian Corsola, and Shadow Sneak proves to be counter-productive when paired with Tapu Lele. Justified, prior to Mega Evolution, allows Gallade to switch into weak Dark-type moves like Mega Sableye's Knock Off and gain an Attack boost. Maximum Speed investment along with a Jolly nature makes Mega Gallade outspeed threats like Choice Specs Blacephalon, Keldeo, and Landorus.</p> <p>All of Mega Gallade's teammates appreciate its ability to deal with Dark-types like Hydreigon and Mega Tyranitar. Steel-types like Jirachi and Metagross pair up well with Mega Gallade, as they deal with Fairy-types like Mega Diancie and Clefable that threaten it, and they can better handle Dragon-type attacks like Draco Meteor from Latios and Latias while also being able to provide Stealth Rock support. Victini and Mega Gallade form a formidable physical wallbreaking core while also synergizing well against Steel teams, as Victini deals with threats like Celesteela, while Mega Gallade in return takes care of Heatran reliably. Latios and Latias act as the most reliable Choice Scarf users on Psychic-type teams and can provide Defog support. Latias in particular can provide Healing Wish support for Mega Gallade, which it appreciates greatly. Fairy-types like Hatterene and Tapu Lele further improve the Dark matchup while also dealing with Dragon-type threats like Mega Altaria and Dragonite. Slowbro provides a reliable defensive pivot, can act as a reliable Fire-resistant Pokemon against Pokemon like Cinderace, and is also able to bring Mega Gallade safely into the field thanks to Teleport. Celebi is a great teammate, as it reliably deals with Water- and Ground-types that threaten Mega Gallade such as Mega Swampert and Excadrill. Deoxys-S breaks through Flying-type teams thanks to its BoltBeam coverage in conjunction with Nasty Plot. Albeit not common, Meloetta can provide a reliable switch-in against Ghost-type attacks directed at Mega Gallade from the likes of Gengar and Blacephalon.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Mega Venusaur acts as a wall for Grass teams, checking threats such as Nidoking and Mega Diancie. Thick Fat crucially helps Mega Venusaur take attacks from Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Victini and Mamoswine. Sludge Bomb is Mega Venusaur's main attack and nails Grass- and Fairy-types like Rillaboom and Alolan Ninetales while doing neutral damage to threats such as Dragonite. Sludge Bomb can also be used to fish for poison against foes such as Mega Sableye, Landorus-T, and Zapdos, making them easier to wear down. Giga Drain allows it to take on threats such as Mamoswine while also gaining back health. Leech Seed can be used over Giga Drain, notably allowing setup sweepers such as Celebi and Decidueye to set up more easily. Hidden Power Fire provides meaningful damage against Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Bisharp. Synthesis allows Mega Venusaur to stay healthy throughout the match; it should continually use Synthesis to stay at full health so it can constantly switch into different attackers, such as Mega Lopunny and Mimikyu. 16 Speed EVs let Mega Venusaur outspeed Adamant Azumarill.</p> <p>All of Mega Venusaur's teammates appreciate its ability to take on so many threats, such as Mega Diancie, Mega Scizor, and Buzzwole, while also clearing the field of Toxic Spikes. Additionally, Leech Seed on top of the type's natural ability to hazard stack wears down foes quickly. Ferrothorn forms the defensive core of the team with Mega Venusaur, switching into Psychic-type attacks, setting hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes, and taking on threats such as Weavile with Gyro Ball. Mega Venusaur can take Fighting-type attacks for Ferrothorn such as Terrakion's Close Combat. Whimsicott can take on Dragon-type Pokemon such as Kyurem, Hydreigon, and Kommo-o with Moonblast for Mega Venusaur, notably switching into Dragonite's Outrage. It can also cripple various threats such as Blissey, Porygon2, and Choice Band Victini by removing their items. All of Mega Venusaur's offensive teammates such as Breloom, Celebi, Rillaboom, Tapu Bulu, and Zarude appreciate its ability to wear down foes such as Mandibuzz, allowing them to better clean late-game. Breloom can take on Dark- and Steel-type Pokemon for Mega Venusaur such as Hydreigon, Heatran, and Excadrill with Swords Dance + Mach Punch and take on Flying-types such as Celesteela with Continental Crush. Celebi can take on Poison- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Nidoking, Toxapex, and Kommo-o as well as threats such as Heatran with Earth Power. Celebi can also opt to run Hidden Power Fire alongside Earth Power to handle Steel teams better. Rillaboom generally threatens offensive Pokemon such as Mega Gallade, Landorus, and Nihilego with Grassy Glide in Grassy Terrain. Tapu Bulu can also summon Grassy Terrain and takes on Steel- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Bisharp, and Zapdos with Close Combat and Stone Edge. Rillaboom and Tapu Bulu's Grassy Terrain helps Venusaur stay healthy and take Earthquakes from Pokemon like Excadrill more easily. Zarude can handle Psychic-type Pokemon such as Alakazam and Tapu Lele and pivot into status conditions due to Jungle Healing, preventing Mega Venusaur from being worn down.</p>"

Its great bulk allows it to also take on physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny and Excadrill. Giga Drain hits Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types like Hippowdon, Gastrodon, Azumarill, Terrakion, and Mega Diancie. Sludge Bomb is Mega Venusaur's strongest STAB option that greatly dents Fairy-and Grass-types like Tapu Koko, Tapu Bulu, and Rillaboom. It is also useful for its 30% poison chance against specially defensive walls like Mega Sableye, Mantine, and Zapdos. Mega Venusaur can use Leech Seed over Sludge Bomb to give it and its teammates passive recovery. Hidden Power Fire makes does good damage to Excadrill and prevents Mega Venusaur from being fodder for Mega Scizor's setup and Ferrothorn's entry hazards. Synthesis keeps Mega Venusaur healthy throughout the match. Venusaur gains Thick Fat upon Mega Evolution, which halves damage taken from Fire- and Ice-type attacks from Blacephalon, Greninja, and Alolan Ninetales, and it also prevents a 2HKOfrom Choice Scarf Victini 's V-create. 16 Speed EVs are used to outpace Adamant Azumarill. The remaining EVs maximize Mega Venusaur's physical bulk so it can tank physical attacks from Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Mega Lopunny, and Excadrill.</p> <p>Toxapex forms a great defensive core with Mega Venusaur, providing Haze to check setup sweepers that exploit Mega Venusaur such as Dragonite, Aegislash, Volcarona, and Mega Scizor. It switches into Mega Charizard Y and pressures the opposition with Toxic Spikes and Scald as well. Mega Venusaur in return can check Electric-types like Zeraora and Tapu Koko and switch into Ground-type attacks from Gastrodon and Hippowdon. Nihilego can set Stealth Rock and take care of Fire- and Flying-types like Mega Charizard Y, Tornadus-T, and Zapdos. Nidoking can also provide Stealth Rock support while also being a great wallbreaker that can 2HKO Mega Sableye using Earth Power, and break through Heatran + Celesteela. Nidoking can also beat Flying-types such as Zapdos and Gliscor, and in return, Mega Venusaur can switch into Ice- and Water-types like Weavile and Urshifu-R. Levitate Galarian Weezing gives the team immunity to Dragon and Ground as well as support in Will-O-Wisp and Defog. Drapion can set Toxic Spikes and switch into Psychic-type attacks from Tapu Lele, Latias, and Latios and Pursuit trap them. Alolan Muk is another Dark-type option that can use Curse, Rest, and Knock Off to take care of Psychic-types. Both Dark-types switch into Ghost-type attacks from Pokemon such as Gengar as well. Galarian Slowking can help against special attackers such as Kyurem and switch in on Psychic-types like Tapu Lele, Latios, and Alolan Raichu.</p>"

It can outspeed Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Hydreigon after one Dragon Dance and Mega Charizard X can outpace Sand Rush Excadrill in sand and Regieleki after two. Outrage can be used to hit other Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Kyurem and Fire-resistant foes like Slowbro and Swampert; however, being locked into it and confused can be taken advantage of by Pokemon such as Azumarill. Dragon Claw is Mega Charizard X's more reliable but less powerful Dragon-type STAB move. Roost can be used to give Mega Charizard X longevity throughout the game and heal off Flare Blitz recoil, whereas Earthquake hits Heatran, Tyranitar, and Toxapex. 252 EVs in Speed alongside a Jolly nature allow Mega Charizard X to outspeed common threats like Excadrill and Hydreigon.</p> <p>Torkoal can set up Stealth Rock and remove entry hazards from Mega Charizard X's side thanks to Rapid Spin while fueling its Flare Blitz by setting up sun. Rotom-H can set up Light Screen and Reflect so Mega Charizard X can set up safely. Rotom-H can also remove Stealth Rock with Defog and bring Mega Charizard X in safely with Volt Switch. Cinderace as a teammate can wallbreak through diverse walls Mega Charizard X struggles against, such as Tyranitar and Toxapex, by virtue of its coverage moves in High Jump Kick and Zen Headbutt. Blacephalon can help Mega Charizard X by breaking through physical walls such as Hippowdon and Porygon2 with its Choice Specs set. Infernape's Fighting typing allows it to threaten the likes of Tyranitar, Heatran, and Porygon2, with the former two being hard for Mega Charizard X to beat without Earthquake. Choice Scarf Infernape and Choice Scarf Blacephalon can be used against huge threats like Choice Scarf Nihilego. Volcanion can be used to check Rock- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Rhyperior, and Water Absorb lets it beat Tapu Fini and Azumarill with Sludge Wave. Volcarona can form a sweeping core with Mega Charizard X by removing some of its checks like Mega Slowbro and Gastrodon.

It also has a decent movepool consisting of moves like Solar Beam and Focus Blast, which lets it take on some of the Pokemon that can take Fire-type attacks. Mega Charizard Y's presence on Flying-type teams also improves the matchups against types like Steel, Ice, and Ground. Fire Blast hits super hard thanks to the boost from Drought and deals with pesky Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Skarmory. Solar Beam deals with Water- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Swampert, and Hippowdon. Focus Blast helps Mega Charizard Y beat problematic Pokemon for it like Heatran and Tyranitar that can reliably stomach other moves . Roost allows it to keep itself healthy and threaten balance cores more such as those of Water and Psychic teams. Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Mega Charizard Y to hit as hard as possible and outspeed Pokemon like Choice Specs Tapu Lele and Speed tie with other base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Mew and Galarian Zapdos. Blaze is the preferred ability before Mega Evolving so Charizard does not take any unnecessary damage from opposing sun. Charizardite Y is used as an item to Mega Evolve Charizard.</p> <p>Defoggers like Mantine, Skarmory, Mandibuzz, and Zapdos can reliably clear Stealth Rock for Mega Charizard Y while also providing it with other utility support. Mantine also covers Water-type attacks for it from Pokemon like Urshifu-R and Barraskewda. Since Mega Charizard Y struggles to get past dedicated special walls like Toxapex, Blissey, and Araquanid, teammates like Landorus-T and Dragonite are good, as they can break apart such Pokemon. Landorus-T also provides Mega Charizard Y with an immunity from Electric-type attacks and wallbreak with its Swords Dance set or check threats like Tapu Koko with its Choice Scarf set. Dragonite, on the other hand, loves Mega Charizard Y dealing with Steel-type Pokemon for it; in return, it can muscle past Pokemon like Alolan Muk and Toxapex with its Choice Band set and revenge kill faster threats like Alolan Raichu with Extreme Speed. As Mega Charizard Y is threatened by faster Pokemon such as Nihilego, Terrakion, and Garchomp, teammates like Corviknight, Celesteela, and Skarmory help to have, and they provide a Rock-type neutrality. They all also provide various utility support like Defog, Toxic + Leech Seed, and Stealth Rock to keep Mega Charizard Y safer and to help wear down teams. Other special attackers such as Landorus, Tornadus-T, and Thundurus-T are also decent teammates, as they all can weaken shared checks like Blissey, Heatran, Toxapex, and Tyranitar. Focus Sash Aerodactyl is a good teammate on hyper offensive Flying-type teams to provide it with Stealth Rock and Tailwind support. Gliscor can help stallbreak defensive Pokemon like Blissey and Toxapex for Mega Charizard Y while also providing it with an Electric-type immunity and taking on Pokemon like Zeraora.</p>"

Rising Voltage's power is significantly boosted under Electric Terrain, letting Alolan Raichu break past foes that don't resist it or are not specially bulky and be an effective sweeper as well. Psychic is useful for hitting notable Fighting- and Poison-type threats to Electric teams such as Kommo-o, Mega Venusaur, and Nidoking. Grass Knot provides important coverage for Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Gastrodon, Swampert, and Seismitoad. Nasty Plot is an option over Grass Knot if a teammate like Rotom-C already has Grass-type coverage, allowing Alolan Raichu to set up on foes it can force out like Pelipper, Toxapex, and Celesteela, making it a sufficient wallbreaker as well. Focus Blast can KO many important targets including Hydreigon, Excadrill, Tyranitar, Diggersby, and Ferrothorn after chip damage. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Alolan Raichu to outspeed Keldeo, Alolan Ninetales, and Landorus outside of Electric Terrain. A Modest nature can be used instead to increase damage output while still being very fast under Electric Terrain. Life Orb is used to increase Alolan Raichu's otherwise underwhelming damage output so it can sweep better. Alolan Raichu is very frail, so it should generally avoid switching in recklessly after Electric Terrain has been set up and instead come in safely from teammates' pivoting.</p> <p>Tapu Koko is needed in order to set Electric Terrain for Alolan Raichu so it can clean teams or weaken foes. It also provides an immunity against Dragon-type moves from foes like Garchomp, Latios, and Mega Altaria, and it can beat problematic Dark-types like Bisharp thanks to its STAB Dazzling Gleam. Zeraora can deal with specially defensive walls such as Blissey and Celebi that Alolan Raichu struggles with. Alolan Golem and Magnezone can trap problematic Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Scizor with Magnet Pull and KO them. Alolan Golem is also able to set up Stealth Rock to chip foes for Alolan Raichu. Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and Regieleki are able to pivot into Alolan Raichu with Volt Switch and weaken foes, giving it more opportunities to sweep. Bulky partners such as Zapdos and Rotom-W are able to take powerful attacks or priority moves for Alolan Raichu, provide support with Defog, and switch in on Ground-type attacks. However, Rotom-W has to be wary of Mold Breaker Excadrill. Additionally, Zapdos is able to check Tapu Bulu, which disrupts Electric Terrain and checks Alolan Raichu freely due to its typing.</p>"

Thunderbolt helps combat Water and Flying teams, notably hitting foes like Tapu Fini and Mantine, allowing Nidoking to make progress. Stealth Rock can be used as an option over Thunderbolt to further increase pressure on the opposing team with entry hazards, as not many Poison-types can learn the move.</p> <p>Amoonguss and Mega-Venusaur assist Nidoking by switching into revenge killers such as Excadrill and Landorus-Therian, status them with sleep and poison, and switch into the Water-type attacks aimed at Nidoking.

Muk also appreciates Nidoking's presence, as Nidoking pressured Pokemon that Alolan Muk fails to beat such as Hippowdon and Celesteela. If Stealth Rock is used over Thunderbolt, Gengar and Nihilego are good teammates, as they can both utilize Electric- and Grass-type coverage to make up for Nidoking loses upon dropping Thunderbolt. Crobat, Toxapex, and Galarian Slowking make for exceptional teammates that all appreciate NIdoking's Electric immunity. Crobat is immune to Ground-type attacks and can revenge kill foes such as Mega Gallade, Keldeo and Greninja. Toxapex can pivot into the Water- and Ice-type attacks that force Nidoking out while providing Toxic Spikes support. Finally, Galarian Slowking provides Future Sight support, which makes Nidoking's offensive pressure even harder to handle. Future Sight allows Nidoking to even break Pokemon such as opposing Mega-Venusaur. Galarian Slowking can also switch into Nidoking revenge killers such as Keldeo or Tapu Lele.</p>"

Alolan Ninetales's Fairy typing is good to threaten Fighting- and Dark-types like Keldeo and Mega Sableye with STAB Moonblast, and it has a great Speed tier to outpace Pokemon such as Keldeo and Terrakion. Freeze-Dry is used to hit Water-types such as Swampert, Pelipper, Mantine, and Gastrodon. Encore allows Alolan Ninetales to lock entry hazard settlers and setup sweepers like Galarian Corsola, Torkoal, and Bisharp into non-damaging moves. Light Clay is used to maintain Aurora Veil for eight turns, and Snow Warning is needed to summon hail. 252 Special Attack EVs make Alolan Ninetales hit as hard as possible. A Timid nature with 252 Speed EVs is vital for Alolan Ninetales to outpace Keldeo and Hydreigon.</p> <p>All teammates appreciate Alolan Ninetales providing Aurora Veil to help take attacks and its Moonblast threatening Keldeo and Terrakion. Alolan Sandslash loves Alolan Ninetales summoning hail to enable Slush Rush, allowing it to outpace Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Diancie. Alolan Ninetales in return can take care of Landorus and Nidoking outside hail. Avalugg is a great wall that can come in on Excadrill's and Bisharp's attacks and take care of them with Body Press. It can also use Rapid Spin to get rid of entry hazards that prevent Alolan Ninetales from repeatedly coming in. Cloyster is a great partner, as it loves the support from Aurora Veil to safety set up and sweep and can take care of troublesome Rock- and Fire-types once it set up, like Mega Tyranitar, Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Charizard Y, and Victini. Piloswine is also a great partner that can take care of Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y thanks to Thick Fat and provide Stealth Rock. Mamoswine is another option, as it can also provide Stealth Rock support, takes neutral damage from Fire- and Rock-type attacks and helps against Rock-, Fire-, Steel- and Poison-types like Tyranitar, Heatran, Magnezone, and Toxapex. Kyurem is a great wallbreaker; helps out Alolan Ninetales by taking care of troublesome Steel-types such Heatran, Excadrill, and Magnezone with Earth Power; and helps out in the Water-type matchup with Freeze-Dry to 2HKO Toxapex, which Alolan Ninetales has trouble beating. Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan is a great wallbreaker and a great way to take care of troubling Steel-types like Excadrill, Heatran, and Jirachi that threaten Alolan Ninetales out. Choice Scarf Weavile is a great check to a set-up Cloyster thanks to Foul Play and troublesome Ghost- and Psychic-types like Gengar, Blacephalon, Victini and Jirachi thanks to Knock Off and Pursuit. Knock Off is also useful to get rid of Heavy-Duty Boots from Blissey, Leftovers from Tyranitar, and Eviolite from Porygon2.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Ditto is one of the best ways for Normal teams to handle fast threats, as Imposter mirrors opposing Pokemon's stats and Choice Scarf makes Ditto outspeed them. With Ditto in battle, Pokemon like Volcarona, Mega Altaria, and Kommo-o are pressured from setting up because it can steal stat boosts to countersweep, and Imposter means Sticky Web has no effect on it. Ditto can also exploit support Pokemon like Zapdos and Blissey to recover with Roost or Soft-Boiled and entry hazard removers like Pelipper and Coalossal to clear hazards. It can also safely switch into Mega Sableye's Knock Off to trade Speed for move freedom, and it ignores defensive Celesteela's Toxic. However, Ditto's 5 PP per move and Choice lock give it a hard time beating defensive sweepers like CurseRest Mega Steelix and Calm Mind Mega Slowbro. Choice Scarf is required for Ditto to revenge kill setup sweepers like Swords Dance Excadrill and Mega Lopunny and Speed tie with opposing Choice Scarf Pokemon like Nihilego and Landorus-T. Ditto cannot copy HP, so investing 252 EVs into HP helps it a lot, and 0 Speed IVs and a Relaxed nature allow it to not transform and lose PP against mirrored Ditto. The mentioned IV spread allows it to have HP Fire to trap and KO Magnezone.</p> <p>Defensive Pokemon like Staraptor, Blissey, and Porygon2 appreciate Ditto because it can revenge kill setup Pokemon like Dragon Dance Altaria and Bulk Up Cinderace that will try to break and setup on them. Ditto appreciates Pokemon with pivoting moves, like Teleport Blissey and Porygon2 and U-Turn Staraptor, to allow it to come in safely. Staraptor helps with Fighting-types with its part Flying typing and Intimidate, and it has Defog to clear entry hazards for when Ditto comes in. Ditto does not appreciate being statused in any form, so Blissey as a teammate can absorb status thanks to Natural Cure. Offensive Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, Diggersby, Heliolisk, and Indeedee-M are appreciated, as they can remove defensive Pokemon Ditto cannot revenge kill. Mega Lopunny's Close Combat helps with Pokemon like Tyranitar and Mamoswine, and its Encore to helps with defensive sweepers like the aforementioned Steelix and Calm Mind Mega Slowbro. Diggersby helps with Electric-, Rock-, and Steel-types like Zapdos, Coalossal, and Aegislash with Earthquake and can revenge kill faster Pokemon like Zeraora and Cinderace with Quick Attack. Indeedee-M helps with Fighting- and Poison-types like Keldeo and Toxapex with Expanding Force and prevents priority moves like Mach Punch from working thanks to Psychic Terrain. Heliolisk helps with Water- and Flying-types like Celesteela, Toxapex, and Mantine with Thunderbolt and has Dry Skin to offer Water immunity for the team.</p>"

Fire Fang is also an option to hit Steel-type Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Forretress harder than any move on the set. Dual Wingbeat can be used over Dragon Dance to beat Pokemon like Kommo-o, Mega Gallade, and Mega Venusaur.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Flying</h4> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Sturdy defensive Pokemon like Porygon2, Galarian Corsola, and Ferrothorn have little to fear from Mega Aerodactyl, as they can take it on even after a Dragon Dance, cripple it with status moves, and proceed to wear it down.</p> <p><strong>Status Moves</strong>: Being a physical attacker, Mega Aerodactyl fears burns from Scald and Will-O-Wisp, which leave it unable to do any significant damage.

        "description": "<p>Mega Aerodactyl's high Attack stat, stellar Speed stat, and good offensive typing make it a solid offensive Pokemon for Flying-type teams. Its great Speed also lets it outspeed and handle fast threats like Tapu Koko, Zeraora, and Weavile. Its access to Dragon Dance lets Mega Aerodactyl increase its already good Attack stat to even greater levels and outspeed extremely fast Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Greninja, Regieleki, and Excadrill in the sand, making it considerably harder to revenge kill. Stealth Rock can also be used over Dragon Dance for role compression, especially when Mega Aerodactyl's teammates are not carrying it. Its high Speed stat lets it set Stealth Rock quickly against types like Flying, Dragon, and Fire and threaten their entry hazard removers. Stone Edge hits much of the metagame for good damage right off the bat, especially with Rock's good coverage. When boosted by Dragon Dance, it scores 2HKOs on Pokemon such as Slowbro and Mega Venusaur after minor chip damage. Earthquake in tandem with Stone Edge improves Mega Aerodactyl's coverage and lets it hit Pokemon such as Aegislash and Toxapex reliably. It also takes care of Electric-type Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Magnezone, and Zeraora without relying on Stone Edge to hit. Tough Claws-boosted Ice Fang lets Mega Aerodactyl take care of bulky Ground- and Dragon-type Pokemon like Gliscor, Landorus, and Garchomp. Stone Edge + Ice Fang synergizes well in the Dragon matchup, as it can hit every viable Dragon-type for super effective damage. Pursuit, which is also boosted by Tough Claws, can be used over Ice Fang to handle threats to Flying-type teams such as Choice Band Victini, Mega Latias, and Latios.</p> <p>Mega Aerodactyl is vulnerable to Electric-type Pokemon like Alolan Raichu in Electric Terrain and Regieleki, so teammates like Gliscor and Landorus can cover that weakness. Gliscor can provide stallbreaking support to wear down walls and absorb status for Mega Aerodactyl, while Landorus is a formidable wallbreaker to beat physical walls like Toxapex, Porygon2, Galarian Corsola, and Hippowdon. Additionally, both can also utilize Stealth Rock so Mega Aerodactyl can use Dragon Dance to be more threatening. Ice- and Rock-type Pokemon like Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, Weavile, Nihilego, and Terrakion also threaten Mega Aerodactyl, so teammates like Corviknight, Celesteela, and Skarmory can handle them; in return, Mega Aerodactyl can deal with problematic Fire-type Pokemon like Victini and Mega Charizard Y. Corviknight can act as a great wincon with its Bulk Up set after Mega Aerodactyl has weakened the team, while Skarmory can also take on physical threats like Mega Scizor, Mega Sharpedo, and Excadrill. They both also provide Defog support to help with Mega Aerodactyl's Stealth Rock weakness. Celesteela, on the other hand, can take care of Steel-type Pokemon with Flamethrower or wear down teams for Mega Aerodactyl with Toxic + Leech Seed support and check Mega Diancie. Special attackers such as Thundurus-T and Tornadus-T can take care of Water-type Pokemon such as Swampert, Toxapex, and Urshifu-R that are problematic for Mega Aerodactyl. Mantine and Mandibuzz are also decent teammates to take on Water- and Ghost-type threats like Kingdra and Aegislash; the former provides Mega Aerodactyl with an important Water-type immunity while the latter provides pivoting with U-turn and Knock Off support. A wallbreaker like Dragonite can weaken shared checks like Toxapex for Mega Aerodactyl and appreciates Stealth Rock support for a late-game sweep.</p>"

It's also useful against Dragon-types like Latias and Mega Altaria. Heat Wave allows it to take on Ice-, Steel-, and Grass-types such as Glastrier, Excadrill, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn. Hidden Power Ice allows Zapdos to hit Dragon- and Ground-types like Dragonite, Garchomp, and Landorus super effectively.

Volt Switch helps Zapdos pivot and maintain momentum, while Discharge deals with Pokemon like Celesteela and Toxapex better and does not force Zapdos to switch out. Heat Wave hits Steel-types like Excadrill and Ferrothorn. Toxic can be used on teams with reliable way of dealing with Steel-types, as it helps put threats like Diggersby and Garchomp on a timer, which otherwise can deal with Zapdos's other moves, and deals with walls like Porygon2. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Zapdos to safely switch in throughout the battle without worrying about its Stealth Rock weakness. Defog in conjunction with Pressure can stall out Stealth Rock's PP. Static is an alternative to have an easier time spreading paralysis, especially in conjunction with Discharge. 80 Speed EVs along with a Timid nature helps Zapdos outspeed Pokemon such as Jolly Diggersby, maximum Speed Heatran, and Tapu Bulu. Maximum HP investment and 176 Special Defense EVs allows Zapdos to take multiple hits from Pokemon such as Gengar and Latias.</p> <p>All of Zapdos's teammates appreciates its Electric neutrality allowing it to switch in against special attacks like Thunderbolt from unboosted Mega Latios. Zapdos should try to come in on a predicted Stealth Rock use to decrease its PP, use Volt Switch to bring in teammates safely, and avoid getting statused or having its Heavy-Duty Boots removed by Knock Off. Stealth Rock-weak teammates such as Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Charizard Y greatly appreciate Defog support from Zapdos. Celesteela is a great partner alongside Zapdos, as it can switch in against Ice- and Rock-type attacks thanks to its excellent typing and wear down teams with Leech Seed and Toxic. Leech Seed's additional healing is also greatly appreciated by Zapdos. Mantine forms a great defensive core with Zapdos, with Mantine appreciating Zapdos's ability to switch in on Electric-type moves and Zapdos benefitting from Mantine tanking Ice-type moves. Mantine also switches into powerful Water-type attacks like Keldeo's Hydro Pump, and Zapdos running Defog allows Mantine to be less passive and run other moves such as Toxic. Haze from Mantine further helps Zapdos against setup sweepers. Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Charizard Y, and Landorus-T appreciates Zapdos's ability to bring them safely in with Volt Switch; in return, the former two can KO Ice-types, while the latter can KO Rock-types. Mega Aerodactyl can also Pursuit trap Pokemon such Victini and Trick Latios, which threatens Zapdos. Landorus and Mega Charizard Y help in breaking through walls, like Hippowdon and Heatran, for Zapdos, making it easier to wear down offensive threats. They also help in dealing with Poison- and Steel-types like Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn if Zapdos is running Toxic over Heat Wave. Tornadus-T can also act as a secondary Defogger and forms a great pivoting core with Volt Switch Zapdos while also taking on Pokemon like Mega Venusaur, which Zapdos struggles with.</p>"

Brave Bird deals with major threats to Poison teams in the form of Mega Gallade and Mega Pinsir. Defog allows Crobat to remove entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes for its teammates, while Roost serves as reliable recovery, providing longevity for Crobat throughout the game. Taunt allows Crobat to pressure walls like Blissey and Hippowdon by blocking recovery while also preventing utility Pokemon such as Swampert and Klefki from setting up hazards and using all sorts of status moves. Taunt also ensures Toxapex's Toxic Spikes stays up against opposing Defog users like Staraptor. U-turn can be opted over Taunt, improving Crobat as a fast pivot instead. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Crobat from taking Stealth Rock damage upon entry. 192 Speed EVs along with a Jolly nature allow Crobat to outspeed key threats like Greninja, Tornadus, and Alakazam, while 48 Attack EVs ensure that it OHKOes Mega Gallade with 4 Defense EVs after Stealth Rock damage. 252 HP EVs and the remaining EVs going in Defense increase Crobat's bulk.</p> <p>All of Crobat's teammates appreciate Crobat's Ground immunity Defog. Toxapex provides a great defensive switch-in against a majority of attacks directed at Crobat, notably resisting Ice. Toxapex can also provide Haze and Toxic Spikes support. Mega Venusaur is a great teammate for Crobat, dealing with Electric-type attack and Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Rotom-W that threaten it. Mega Venusaur can also act as a reliable secondary Ground-type switch-in, and, together with Toxapex, is able to provide an extremely reliable defensive core that may switch into almost any attack directed at Crobat. Drapion and Alolan Muk act as the much needed sources of Psychic immunity, additionally being able to Pursuit trap and defeat threatening Psychic-types for Crobat, like Choice Scarf Latios and Tapu Lele. They can also aid greatly in the Ghost-type matchup by safely switching into and Pursuit trapping threats like Gengar and Blacephalon. Drapion can also provide Toxic Spikes support, while Alolan Muk can opt for a Curse set which is an extremely effective late-game sweeper. Nidoking is an excellent special wallbreaker that is able to beat the Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Heatran that wall Crobat while serving as the best source Electric immunity Poison has to offer. Nihilego is a great asset in the Flying matchup and is the best available Choice Scarf user for Poison-type teams. Lastly, Assault Vest Galarian Slowking reliably checks some key threats like Kyurem and Choice Specs Zapdos that otherwise pose a significant threat to Crobat and Poison teams more broadly.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Fairy</h4> <p>Azumarill can opt to run Sitrus Berry if a different teammate like Tapu Bulu runs a Z-Crystal. However, Normalium Z is the more reliable way to ensure it successfully uses Belly Drum. Azumarill can also chose to run Brick Break in lieu of Play Rough, as it better deals with Steel-type Pokemon, namely Melmetal, which otherwise withstands any of Azumarill's attacks even after Belly Drum. Substitute may be used over Play Rough in order to let Azumarill set up on Pokemon that rely on status moves to deal with it, like Torkoal and Mega Sableye, but Play Rough is generally preferred due to it hitting useful targets. Return along with a Jolly nature can be used to better deal with Galarian Weezing and Mega Venusaur, significantly improving the Poison-type matchup.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Fairy</h4> <p><strong>Water-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that resist Azumarill's Aqua Jet such as Latios and Serperior can withstand Aqua Jet even after Belly Drum and KO Azumarill with their STAB moves or super effective coverage options. Even many walls that resist Water, like Mega Venusaur, Celebi, and Rotom-W, can outspeed Azumarill and KO it with super effective STAB moves before Azumarill can use Knock Off or Play Rough.</p> <p><strong>Haze Users and Phazers</strong>: Mantine can outspeed Azumarill and remove its boosts with Haze, while Azumarill fails to reliably set up Belly Drum against Toxapex, as it removes the move's boosts with Haze and proceeds to easily deal with unboosted Azumarill. In the same vein, Azumarill fails to reliably set up against phazers like Hippowdon and Skarmory.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: All status conditions significantly hinder Azumarill's ability to act as a reliable offensive threat. Burn makes it significantly weaker, paralysis prevents it from outspeeding threats like Porygon2 it otherwise would, and poison puts it on a timer, wearing it down quickly in conjunction with Belly Drum's health drop.</p> <p><strong>Psychic Terrain</strong>: Due to Azumarill's below average Speed stat, it heavily relies on Aqua Jet. As a result, Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain can hamper Azumarill greatly and make it much more easily revenge killed.</p>",

Aqua Jet allows it to deal with faster threats like Volcarona and Mamoswine, making up for its subpar Speed stat. Knock Off hits Psychic- and Ghost-types like Jirachi and Aegislash for super effective damage, and it's able to OHKO Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Celesteela and bulky walls like Toxapex with minor or no chip damage after Belly Drum. Play Rough is a stronger STAB option that deals with Dragon- and Dark-types such as Kommo-o and Mandibuzz. Maximum Speed EVs make Azumarill as fast as possible, outspeeding threats such as Dragalge and Melmetal. Normalium Z is Azumarill's preferred item, as it nullifies chip damage taken prior to using Belly Drum while also preventing Azumarill from being crippled by Knock Off, as opposed to Sitrus Berry. The added perk of Normalium Z is that Azumarill can use Belly Drum without it to use Z-Belly Drum later, either recovering its HP back to full if it didn't switch out.</p> <p>Klefki pairs up exceptionally well with Azumarill. Klefki acts as a much needed Poison immunity and provides dual screens support and Spikes support, the former allowing Azumarill to set up more easily and the latter chipping down foes for it. Tapu Koko helps greatly in the Flying- and Water-type matchups, while Mega Diancie is able to bounce off entry hazards as well as status moves directed at Azumarill. Mega Diancie can also provide Stealth Rock support, which helps it further improve the Fire- and Flying-type matchups, and aid in matchups like Poison, Steel, and Electric thanks to a wide range of coverage options in Psychic, Mystical Fire, and Earth Power. Tapu Bulu is a great asset in the Water-, Electric- and Ground-type matchups. Tapu Lele is not only a great wallbreaker when equipped with a Choice Specs, but also a great help against Poison-types such as Mega Venusaur and Galarian Weezing that threaten Azumarill. Mimikyu helps greatly in the Ghost- and Psychic-type matchups, dealing with Pokemon like Aegislash and Tapu Lele. Lastly, Togekiss synergizes well with Azumarill, as it deals with Grass-types troublesome to Azumarill, like Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn, while Azumarill in return deals with Rock-type threats to Togekiss.</p>"

In conjunction with Mega Steelix's sky-high Defense stat, a single Curse boost allows it to survive attacks such as V-create from Choice Band Victini and Close Combat from +2 Mega Gallade. Heavy Slam nails Fairy-types like Tapu Bulu and Mega Diancie while dishing out large amounts of damage against neutral targets, allowing it to deal with most of the tier after a few boosts. Rest allows Mega Steelix to maintain longevity and cure any burns when against passive Pokemon such as Mandibuzz, Mega Sableye, and Klefki. Sleep Talk synergizes well with Rest, allowing it to potentially further set up with Curse or fire off a powerful Heavy Slam even when asleep, preventing foes from taking advantage of Rest. Due to its already sky-high Defense stat, maximum HP and Special Defense EVs are invested to increase Mega Steelix's special bulk, allowing it to better deal with special attackers like Latios and Alolan Ninetales. An Impish nature is used to ensure Mega Steelix survives a +6 Aqua Jet from Azumarill, KOing it back with Heavy Slam.</p> <p>Gastrodon and Seismitoad act as great teammates, as they both provide a much needed immunity to Water-type attacks and are able to deal with threats to Mega Steelix, such as Mega Slowbro and Mantine. Landorus synergizes well with Mega Steelix, as it comfortably deals with some of Mega Steelix's checks in Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Heatran while also acting as a great special wallbreaker. Mamoswine can deal with troublesome Ground-, Flying- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Landorus, Zapdos, and Garchomp while also providing a form of priority thanks to Ice Shard. Nidoking works well with Mega Steelix, as it can better address the threat posed by Steel- and Flying-types that deal with Mega Steelix, such as Ferrothorn and Celesteela, by virtue of its wide coverage boosted by Sheer Force. Excadrill provides a way to check faster foes such as Cinderace and also deals with offensive threats such as Heatran while providing secondary hazard control thanks to Rapid Spin; it is also able to act as reliable wallbreaker with Swords Dance. Garchomp can form a strong physical wallbreaker core in tandem with Mega Steelix, since Swords Dance lets it break past some of Mega Steelix's checks in Mantine and Toxapex. Gliscor can cripple both offensive and defensive Pokemon thanks to Knock Off and Taunt, which Mega Steelix appreciates greatly, while also removing troublesome Spikes with Defog. Hippowdon can be a great teammate, as it sets up sand, activating Mega Steelix's Sand Force, while also providing Stealth Rock support.</p>"

Paralysis also cripples Mega Scizor, forcing it to use its coverage moves last.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Sturdy physical walls like Porygon2 and Toxapex can take care of Mega Scizor rather easily with Hidden Power Fire from the former and Haze or Scald burn from the latter.

A STAB move in priority Bullet Punch, which is further boosted by its ability Technician, allows it to sweep teams easily once boosted. Additionally, it also lets Mega Scizor bypass its mediocre Speed stat and take care of faster Pokemon like Landorus, Tapu Koko, and Mega Medicham. Bug Bite lets Mega Scizor deal with Pokemon that resist Bullet Punch such as Rotom-W, Gastrodon, and Swampert. Dual Wingbeat is an option that allows Mega Scizor to score crucial rolls such as the 2HKO on Toxapex, OHKO on Mega Venusaur at +2, and OHKO on Keldeo and Urshifu-R while unboosted. Superpower when boosted lets Mega Scizor deal with some of its checks like Skarmory, Celesteela, and Porygon2. Knock Off can be used as well to remove items from defensive Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Galarian Corsola, which makes it easier for Mega Scizor to deal with them late-game. Knock Off also hits Aegislash hard, which otherwise takes little damage from its other moves. Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature allows Mega Scizor to hit as hard as possible, whereas maximum Speed investment lets it outspeed Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Rotom-W. Scizorite as item lets Scizor Mega Evolve to gain additional bulk and power.</p> <p>Volcarona appreciates Mega Scizor as a teammate greatly, since Mega Scizor can deal with special walls and faster Rock-types such as Blissey, Tyranitar, and Nihilego, respectively, that can be an obstacle for Volcarona. In return, Volcarona takes care of Steel-types such as Corviknight, Celesteela, and Skarmory that are hard for Mega Scizor to get past. It can also specifically beat Zapdos, which otherwise checks Mega Scizor comfortably. Araquanid can sponge Fire-type attacks aimed at Mega Scizor from Pokemon such as Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona while also providing Sticky Web support so that Mega Scizor can outspeed more threats. Buzzwole and Heracross with a Choice Scarf and Stone Edge can take on threats like Choice Band Victini and Mega Charizard Y for the team, and they also appreciate Mega Scizor breaking down walls like Hippowdon when boosted by Swords Dance and make cleaning late-game much easier for the aforementioned revenge killers. Galvantula does well against Water- and Flying-type teams that are usually a trouble for Mega Scizor; it can provide Sticky Web support, too. Forretress can provide entry hazard support in the form of Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes while also providing hazard removal in the form of Rapid Spin and Volt Switch support to bring Mega Scizor safely into the battle.

Stealth Rock helps wear down foes upon switch in, most notably breaking Focus Sash and Sturdy from Pokemon such as Cloyster and Skarmory. Encore prevents setup sweepers such as Mega Gallade, Azumarill, and Volcarona from using Shuckle as setup bait. It also helps deal with defensive walls like Toxapex by forcing them into using utility moves. Knock Off helps get rid of items such as Heavy-Duty Boots, Eviolite, and Choice Scarf from Pokemon like Blissey, Porygon2, and Landorus-T. Removing Heavy-Duty Boots also further improves the effectiveness of the hazards Shuckle sets. Final Gambit can be opted for over Encore, as it provides great momentum gain after hazards are set up. Mental Herb allows Shuckle to ignore Taunt from Pokemon such as Aerodactyl, Cobalion, and Tapu Fini for a single turn allowing it to reliably set up at least one entry hazard. 248 HP EVs and 252 Defense EVs along with an Impish nature maximizes Shuckle's physical bulk and minimizes damage taken by Stealth Rock. Sturdy ensures Shuckle survives a hit from full HP, allowing it to set up hazards against powerful wallbreakers like Choice Specs Aegislash.</p> <p>Mega Diancie pairs well with Shuckle, bouncing off entry hazards and Taunt while also being able to make the most of Shuckle's Sticky Web and Stealth Rock support.

Much like Mega Diancie, Choice Scarf Terrakion appreciates Shuckle reliably setting up Sticky Web to outspeed faster threats, such as Sand Rush Excadrill and Choice Scarf Greninja. Terrakion can also run Swords Dance to make the most out of Sticky Web, as Swords Dance further improves its wallbreaking abilities and helps greatly in matchups such as Steel and Normal. Nihilego can be a threatening teammate against Fairy, Flying, and Water teams when paired with Shuckle's entry hazards thanks to a great ability in Beast Boost and a wide range of coverage options. Tyranitar can provide sand support, bolstering Shuckle's already high Special Defense stat, allowing it to take special hits better, while also improving the Psychic and Ghost matchups greatly due to its STAB-boosted Crunch and Pursuit. Alolan Golem pairs well with Shuckle thanks to an amazing ability in Magnet Pull, allowing it to deal with threats such as Mega Scizor, which it even outspeeds after Sticky Web.

Mega Sableye forms a great defensive core with Galarian Corsola, as it provides a useful Dark neutrality, absorbs Knock Off, and prevents entry hazards like Spikes and Toxic Spikes from being set with Magic Bounce. Additionally, it deals with foes like Nidoking, Blacephalon, and SubToxic Aegislash. Mimikyu is an amazing teammate, as it helps greatly in the Dark and Dragon matchups by pressuring foes like Mandibuzz, Mega Sableye, and Kommo-o for Galarian Corsola. Swords Dance Aegislash can defeat opposing walls that Galarian Corsola struggles to deal with, like Porygon2 and Blissey, making it an amazing partner. SubToxic Aegislash can be used instead to provide a way to deal with special attackers like Kyurem, Tapu Lele, and Choice Specs Latios. Choice Specs Gengar is a great wallbreaker that breaks apart opposing walls such as Toxapex, Heatran, and Mega Venusaur while absorbing Toxic Spikes for Galarian Corsola. Choice Scarf Blacephalon is a useful revenge killer that forces out threatening Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor while outspeeding major threats to Galarian Corsola such as Zarude and Tapu Koko.</p>"

Burns, while much less of an issue, still hamper Porygon2's defensive capabilities by taking away its health continuously due to its lack of passive recovery.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Trick</strong>: Knock Off users like Bisharp and Mega Sableye remove Porygon2's Eviolite, diminishing its sky-high bulk and making it much more vulnerable. In addition to doing that, Trick from Choice-locked Pokemon like Latios and Blacephalon also locks Porygon2 into a single move, turning it into a liability.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Stallbreakers like Taunt Mew and SubToxic Zapdos can easily beat Porygon2 by either disabling its Recover or PP stalling it.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers</strong>: Although Porygon2's insane bulk on both sides lets it take on most wallbreakers, extremely powerful ones like Choice Band Victini and Choice Specs Tapu Lele easily shred it by scoring clean 2HKOes with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types like Terrakion and Mega Gallade are able to easily take down Porygon2 by virtue of their STAB super effective attacks.

        "description": "<p>Porygon2 is the premier physically defensive wall available for Normal teams due to its combination of stellar bulk, reliable recovery, and a movepool that's able to keep important threats in check. Recover is Porygon2's go-to move, allowing it to stay healthy and provide its utility throughout the match. Ice Beam works as Porygon2's main attack, keeping key Ice-weak targets like Dragonite, Gliscor, and Landorus-T at bay. Discharge has a decent chance to cripple the opposition with paralysis while dealing good damage to Pokemon such as Pelipper, Celesteela, and Gyarados. It also forms the BoltBeam coverage alongside Ice Beam, which is capable of heavily denting Flying teams. Hidden Power Fire rounds off the set, enabling Porygon2 to nail Steel-types that take little from its other moves like Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Mega Steelix. Alternatively, Teleport allows Porygon2 to work as a defensive pivot, generating momentum for the team at the cost of further coverage. Download is the preferred ability for Porygon2, reducing its overall passiveness and further threatening Flying-, Water-, Dragon-, and Steel-type teams should it get a Special Attack boost. However, one can opt for Trace to copy and take advantage of defensive abilities like Toxapex's Regenerator, Dragonite's Multiscale, and Landorus-T's Intimidate. Max HP and Defense investments in tandem with a Bold nature and Eviolite bolster Porygon2's physical bulk, permitting it to shrug assaults from the likes of Mega Sharpedo and Choice Band Excadrill. Eviolite in particular also lets Porygon2 take special attacks from Pokemon like Nidoking and Hydreigon with relative ease, despite the lack of EVs in Special Defense.</p> <p>Together, Blissey and Porygon2 form a stellar defensive core for Normal teams that can stop most attackers in their tracks. Blissey can comfortably stomach attacks from special wallbreakers like Landorus and Mega Charizard Y that easily bypass Porygon2 and absorb status aliments for it by virtue of Natural Cure. In return, Porygon2 takes on powerful physical attackers like Dragonite and Mega Sharpedo for Blissey, and the pair can form an extremely effective pivoting backbone should Porygon2 be running Teleport. Ditto is an excellent teammate as well, as it can easily revenge kill sweepers that may use Porygon2 as setup fodder such as Swords Dance Excadrill and Z-Belly Drum Azumarill. It also switches into walls that beat Porygon2 one-on-one like Mega Sableye and Blissey by copying themselves and, thus, their status move immunities. Wallbreakers like Mega Lopunny and Diggersby greatly appreciate Porygon2's bulk to shrug off priority moves and its Teleport for them to come into the field safely. In return, they can beat threats to Porygon2 like Heatran, Mega Sableye, and Tyranitar. Mega Lopunny can also absorb Knock Offs for Porygon2. Defog users like defensive Staraptor and Mega Pidgeot remove entry hazards, allowing Porygon2 to better perform its walling and support duties by coming into the field unscathed. The former also takes hits from dangerous Fighting-types like Infernape and Heracross for Porygon2 and brings it safely into the field with U-turn, while the latter revenge kills Fighting-types and threatens Steel-types like Bisharp and Ferrothorn. Lastly, Porygon-Z's wide array of possible coverage moves allows it to threaten Psychic-types and certain Steel-types Porygon2 struggles dealing with.</p>"

Aromatherapy or Heal Bell lets Blissey act as a cleric for the team, but Blissey can just absorb status via Natural Cure anyways.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Normal</strong></p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types like Mega Gallade and Terrakion can OHKO Blissey with no problem at all while not fearing anything from it bar the rare Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types like Mimikyu and Alolan Marowak are immune to Seismic Toss, meaning Toxic-less Blissey can do nothing to them but Teleport out.

Teleport turns Blissey into an incredibly good defensive pivot as well, taking advantage of its ability to switch into special attackers it walls, like Greninja and Nidoking, to maintain momentum for the team by bringing attackers in safely. Soft-Boiled increases Blissey's longevity, allowing it to support its team throughout the match. Seismic Toss deals consistent damage, enabling Blissey to weaken most of the threats it walls while making it not fully stopped by Taunt. Lastly, Stealth Rock weakens opposing teams gradually, which helps offensive Pokemon like Diggersby and Mega Lopunny net crucial KOs. However, Toxic can be used to further diminish Blissey's passiveness by heavily crippling defensive and offensive threats alike, such as Zapdos and Hydreigon. Maximum HP and Defense investments with a Bold nature are needed to patch Blissey's physical frailty, ensuring it can comfortably shrug weaker physical hits from the likes of Choice Scarf Excadrill and Mega Diancie. Natural Cure lets Blissey absorb status aliments for the team. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents entry hazard damage, which gives Blissey better Teleport pivoting that sets it apart from the bulkier Chansey.</p> <p>All of Blissey's teammates appreciate its supportive and slow pivoting capabilities. Porygon2 stands out as Blissey's best partner because it can easily soak physical hits Blissey is unable to, including from threats like Mega Sharpedo and Mega Scizor, while also being able to pivot out with Teleport. In return, Blissey absorbs status for Porygon2 and takes on special threats that bypass it such as Landorus and Volcarona, making the pair a formidable defensive backbone for Normal teams. Defensive Staraptor is also a good teammate given it switches in on physical Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Infernape for Blissey. It also has access to U-turn to keep momentum in tandem with Blissey's Teleport. Ditto patches Blissey's general vulnerability to setup sweepers like Dragonite and Cloyster by KOing them after it gets brought into the field via Teleport. It also helps Blissey massively against walls that beat it one-on-one like Celesteela and Toxic Toxapex. Mega Lopunny can threaten Ghost-types like Mega Sableye with its access to Scrappy, and Mega Pidgeot beats most Fighting-types that threaten Blissey such as Mega Gallade. Both Mega Pokemon can also form a pivoting core with Blissey due to their fast U-turns and moves to threaten Steel-types like Ferrothorn. Wallbreakers like Diggersby and Heliolisk all appreciate Blissey bringing them safely into the field with Teleport and weakening their targets with its Stealth Rock or Toxic support. In the same vein, Porygon-Z can more easily pull off a sweep with Blissey's aforementioned perks.</p>"

Rock Slide lets it take care of many threats to Dark teams such as Volcarona, Tornadus-T, and Mega Charizard Y. Heavy Slam gives Tyranitar the ability to take on Tapu Lele and Hatterene, while Fire Blast hits most Steel-type physical walls such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor that would otherwise wall Tyranitar. Tyranitar can cripple faster foes that don't get OHKOed by Rock Slide with Thunder Wave such as Latios and Dragonite. Leftovers gives Tyranitar some passive recovery that increases its longevity. Maximum HP and Special Defense gives Tyranitar as much special bulk as possible, allowing it to tank almost any unboosted special attack in sand. Sassy nature is preferred if Fire Blast is chosen over Heavy Slam.</p> <p>All of Tyranitar's teammates appreciate Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave support. Hydreigon especially helps in the Poison and Steel matchups as a Substitute + Nasty Plot sweeper or a faster teammate for an edge in the Dragon matchup. Mega Sableye is a great choice as a Mega Evolution and can act in tandem with Tyranitar, since it is immune to Fighting and can keep entry hazards off your side of the field while spreading burns with Will-O-Wisp. Greninja can be geared to help in any matchup and runs a variety of different sets including Choice Specs, Choice Scarf, Grassium-Z, Icium-Z or Expert Belt. Choice Specs is particularly helpful in the Dragon and Flying matchups, while Grassium-Z is great in the Water and Ground matchups. Icium-Z helps break defensive Celesteela after an Ice Beam, and Extrasensory with Expert Belt can break through Toxapex and Mega Venusaur, which give Tyranitar a lot of trouble. Choice Scarf Greninja can revenge kill opposing Choice Scarf users such as Latios, Latias, and Landorus-T as well as Mega Aerodactyl. Toxic Spikes can be fitted into any of these sets to support entry hazard stacking. Mandibuzz can help check physical setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Mega Scizor, and is also able to clear entry hazards with Defog. Alolan Muk is extremely helpful with taking on pesky Fairy-types and can take advantage of Fairy teams' passive Pokemon such as Klefki to set up with Curse. Zarude is another great teammate that gives an edge in the Water and Ground matchups since it becomes very dangerous after one or two Bulk Ups, and Weavile could be helpful versus Flying with its hard hitting STAB Ice-type attacks. Bisharp is a strong physical attacker that can set up with Swords Dance and provides great priority in Sucker Punch.</p>"

Maximum Speed and Attack investment alongside a Jolly nature allows it to outpace threats such as Adamant Tapu Bulu.</p> <p>Pelipper is an essential teammate, as it sets rain for Mega Swampert, enabling Swift Swim and allowing it to act as a revenge killer and powerful wallbreaker. In addition to setting rain, Pelipper can also nuke Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur with Hurricane, utilize a defensive set with Heavy-Duty Boots to safely pivot in Mega Swampert with U-turn, provide a Ground immunity, and clear entry hazards with Defog. Urshifu-R forms a physical wallbreaking core with Mega Swampert, being able to break past Steel-, Dark-, Ice-, and Normal-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Mandibuzz, Kyurem, and Porygon2. In addition, Urshifu-R can form a pivoting core with Mega Swampert due to U-turn. Greninja can break past Water- and Flying-type Pokemon like opposing Swampert, Mantine, and Landorus with Grass Knot, Hidden Power Electric, and Ice Beam and set Toxic Spikes for Mega Swampert. Choice Scarf Tapu Fini prevents Mega Swampert from being vulnerable to status due to Misty Terrain, provides a Dragon immunity, and can revenge kill Dragon-type Pokemon such as Kyurem and Choice Specs Latios with Moonblast.

Kingdra can also break past physical walls such as Skarmory for Mega Swampert, and in return, Mega Swampert can break past special walls such as Blissey. Barraskewda is another Swift Swim user that can break down its shared checks with Mega Swampert such as Skarmory with its physical Water-type moves, take on Pokemon such as Kyurem with Close Combat, and pivot it in safely with Flip Turn. Manaphy can break past physical walls and checks to Mega Swampert such as Skarmory, Dragonite, and Mega Venusaur thanks to its wallbreaking potential with Tail Glow and great coverage moves. Additionally, thanks to its ability Hydration, it can absorb status for Mega Swampert then use Rest, effectively allowing it to act as a stallbreaker. One of Slowking and Toxapex are typically present on rain teams due to their ability Regenerator, allowing them to act as tanks while being able to pivot out with Teleport or Eject Button, respectively, safely bringing in Mega Swampert. Slowking eases the Psychic matchup, while Toxapex eases the Grass matchup and provides Toxic Spikes. Empoleon can alternatively be used because it can clear entry hazards with Defog, provides a resistance to Dragon- and Psychic-type attacks such as Draco Meteor and Psychic from Latios, and can act as the Stealth Rock setter.</p>"

Greninja can help in a variety of ways taking on opposing Water teams with Grass Knot and Hidden Power Electric, taking on Poison-type Pokemon such as Toxapex with Extrasensory, take on Flying-type Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Mantine with Ice Beam and Hidden Power Electric, or act as a revenge killer and take on threats such as Tapu Koko with Gunk Shot. Kingdra is the primary special attacking abuser of rain using Swift Swim, it can take on Dragon-type Pokemon for Pelipper such as Kyurem and Kommo-o. Additionally, Kingdra is capable of running Hurricane, allowing it to wear down Grass-type Pokemon alongside Pelipper such as Ferrothorn. Tapu Fini can be used as an emergency check to Dragon-type Pokemon with a Choice Scarf outspeeding threats such a Freeze Dry Kyurem and Mega Altaria. Additionally, it can Trick its Choice Scarf onto a wall such as Slowking, preventing it from checking Pelipper as easily. Slowking and Toxapex are present on rain teams to act as a defensive pivot, while not losing momentum for rain teams. Slowking achieves this through Teleport, while Toxapex relies on an Eject Button. Slowking can also provide resistance to Psychic-type attacks from Pokemon such as Tapu Lele and provide Future Sight support, while Toxapex can improve the Fairy matchup and check Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu, while setting up Toxic Spikes, allowing Pelipper to more easily break through Pokemon such as Galarian Corsola. Manaphy takes advantage of rain through Hydration, allowing it to bring a better matchup against more defensive teams due to being able to absorb status, then being able to break past them thanks to Tail Glow and Waterium Z. Manaphy can also aid Pelipper in the Poison matchup by using Psychic allowing it to break past Mega Venusaur and Toxapex, making Pelipper's job easier.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Drizzle allows Pelipper to support the Swift Swim archetype of Water teams, while its great utility moves and typing, providing an immunity to Ground, make it a fantastic rain setter. Scald allows Pelipper to fish for burns against Pokemon such as Celesteela and Garchomp, while also preventing it from becoming too passive. U-turn allows Pelipper to pick up momentum and bring in an offensive teammate safely such as Mega Swampert. Roost allows Pelipper to stay healthy through the match, giving it the ability to set rain multiple times through the game. Defog allows Pelipper to clear hazards such as Sticky Webs and Toxic Spikes for its teammates. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents it from being chipped by Stealth Rock, allowing it to act as a rain setter more times throughout the match. Maximum HP and Defense investment alongside a Relaxed nature and 9 Speed IVs allow Pelipper to under-speed Hippowdon, allowing it to set the rain, helping in the weather war and be as physically bulky as possible tanking attacks such as Mamoswine's Icicle Crash.</p> <p>All Swift Swim users appreciates Pelipper's ability to set rain, which it can do multiple times a match due to its decent bulk and access to Heavy-Duty Boots and reliable recovery. Pelipper also provides Water teams with a Ground immunity allowing it to switch into Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Excadrill. Mega Swampert provides an Electric immunity for Pelipper and can break Poison- and Electric-type Pokemon for Pelipper such as Toxapex, Alolan Muk, Tapu Koko, and Zapdos. Barraskewda sacrifices power and bulk for Speed instead of Mega Swampert allowing it to take on Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Latios and Choice Scarf Greninja under rain. Urshifu-R can break past Normal-, Ice-, Steel-, and Dark-type Pokemon such as Blissey, Porygon2, Kyurem, Ferrothorn, and Mandibuzz. Mega Swampert, Barraskewda, and Urshifu-R all form a momentum-generating core with Pelipper as each of them have a pivoting move like Flip Turn or U-turn. Kingdra is a great teammate for Pelipper, since this set does not run Hurricane it is near mandatory on Kingdra allowing it to take on Grass-types like Mega Venusaur and Tapu Bulu. Kingdra can revenge killing Dragon-type Pokemon such as Kyurem, Kommo-o, and Choice Scarf Latias with Draco Meteor. Greninja can take on a variety of Pokemon for Pelipper such as Mega Venusaur with Extrasensory, Galarian Moltres and Garchomp with Ice Beam, Gastrodon and Swampert with Grass Knot, or act as a revenge killer and take on threats such as +1 Volcarona with a Choice Scarf Rock Slide set. Choice Scarf Tapu Fini can take on threats such as Hydreigon and Kyurem with Moonblast. Slowking or Toxapex complete a defensive core with Pelipper, acting as the teams defensive pivots and providing some sort of momentum such as Teleport in Slowking's case or Eject Button in Toxapex's case. Slowking can help take on threatening Psychic-type Pokemon such as Mega Alakazam and Tapu Lele, while Toxapex can take on Fairy-type Pokemon such as Azumarill and Tapu Bulu with Sludge Bomb and provide Toxic Spikes and Haze support. Empoleon while hard to fit on rain teams can make an excellent teammate due to a few key resistances it brings to the table being against Fairy-, Psychic-, and Dragon-type attacks, while also being able to clear the field of hazards with Defog. However, Empoleon perpetuates a weakness to Ground attacks for Water teams, however, due to the fact Heavy-Duty Boots Pelipper has access to reliable recovery it is a solid option. Manaphy acts as a stall breaker for Pelipper with Tail Glow alongside Waterium Z it can break past a plethora of Pokemon such as Celesteela, Clefable, Galarian Corsola, Aegislash, and Ferrothorn. Additionally, it can run Psychic to take on Poison-type Pokemon such as Toxapex and Mega Venusaur or Ice Beam to take on Dragon- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Garchomp, Dragonite, and Tornadus-T.</p>"

Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers such as Excadrill, Buzzwole, and Dragonite, letting your team more easily handle them. Protect allows Mega Sableye to scout attacks from Choice-locked Pokemon, such as Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan and Choice Band Victini, then switch accordingly. Protect also allows Sableye to Mega Evolve safely. Mega Sableye's Special Defense EVs notably let it take Earth Power from Nidoking, remove its Life Orb, and then take a second Earth Power.

Tyranitar, on the other hand, is the specially defensive part of the core that also sets Stealth Rock and can cripple threats such as Landorus with Toxic. Its great special bulk lets it take on threats such as Volcarona. Greninja can take on a very wide variety of foes with its powerful coverage and set Toxic Spikes, helping Mega Sableye wear down foes with that much more ease. Zarude can take on Water-type Pokemon that threaten Mega Sableye such as Keldeo and Urshifu-R with a Chople Berry and other threats such as Tapu Fini and Azumarill.

Protect lets Sableye safely Mega Evolve against major threats such as Mega Diancie while also scouting Choice-locked attackers like Tapu Koko. Prankster is the ability of choice on pre-Mega Evolution Sableye for priority status moves if necessary.

Galarian Corsola forms a formidable defensive core with Mega Sableye, namely dealing with significant threats in Mega Lopunny, Choice Band Excadrill, and Swords Dance Garchomp. Together, they reliably switch into most attacks directed at their offensive teammates. Aegislash further complements this defensive core as a reliable specially defensive wall with its SubToxic set Poison immunity. Aegislash also greatly aids against Fairy- and Ice-types like Mega Diancie, Tapu Lele, and Alolan Ninetales. Mimikyu is an amazing offensive teammate that helps against Dark-types like Hydreigon and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Latios, Hydreigon, and Kommo-o. Blacephalon helps greatly against Steel-, Grass-, and Ice-types like Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Galarian Darmanitan and is able to act as a reliable revenge killer with Choice Scarf, outspeeding and taking care of some of Mega Sableye's threats like Mega Lopunny and Tapu Koko. Gengar is another great offensive teammate that wallbreaks with Choice Specs and is a great asset in matchups like Fairy.

Lava Plume is the only attacking move on the set, hits decently hard with sun support, and is used to fish for burns against physical attackers like Mimikyu, Mega Lopunny, and Zeraora. Yawn is a good move to force foes to switch out, letting Torkoal set up Stealth Rock or clear hazards with Rapid Spin. It also threatens setup sweepers like Dragonite and Mega Gallade and gives opportunities to teammates like Volcarona and Mega Charizard X to set up. Due to the role compression that Torkoal provides, it is essential to keep it around for its Drought and hazard removal support. Maximum HP and Defense investment with a Bold nature makes Torkoal as bulky as possible, allowing it to take on physical attackers like Mega Lopunny, Mega Gallade, and Dragonite a lot better.

They also appreciate Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin support to have an easier time wallbreaking and safely setting up. Specially defensive Heatran is also a good partner to Torkoal because it can sponge special hits for it from the likes of Latios and Tapu Lele and check Nihilego for the team thanks to its Rock neutrality. Volcanion provides an important immunity to Water-type attacks, which lets it check Belly Drum Azumarill, and secondary hazard removal with Defog, taking pressure off from Torkoal. Alolan Marowak can cover Electric-type attacks for Torkoal from threats like Tapu Koko, Regieleki, and Alolan Raichu.

Choice Scarf and a Timid nature ensure Latias can provide speed control.</p> <p>All of Latias's teammates benefit from its speed control, removal of entry hazards, and Healing Wish utility. Garchomp is a great lead to pair with Latias, since it can reliably set entry hazards and wear physical attackers down with Rough Skin or set up with Swords Dance, which enables Latias to clean late-game. Duraludon provides a Fairy-type neutrality, sets entry hazards, and cripples foes with Thunder Wave. Dragonite benefits from Defog and Healing Wish keeping Multiscale intact, and it is also the only Dragon-type with access to priority in the form of Extreme Speed, which can be used to clean up threats to Dragon teams such as Greninja and Weavile. Latias also benefits from pairing with Mega Altaria, which prevents the opponent from spamming Dragon-type moves in the Dragon mirror. Mega Altaria also assists in the Dark matchup against Greninja after a Dragon Dance, Hydreigon, Urshifu, and Mega Sableye. Kommo-o is helpful in the Steel and Dark matchups but also can help break down Normal's walls, such as Blissey and Porygon2. Hydreigon can deal with Ghost-, Steel-, and Psychic-type threats that check Latias, such as Ferrothorn, Aegislash, and Jirachi. Kyurem provides a valuable Ice-type neutrality and handles walls that Latias struggles with, such as Mandibuzz and Gliscor, while also dealing with bulky Water-types thanks to Freeze-Dry. Also, with Latias filling the need for speed control, you are free to run Choice Specs Latios or Mega Latios. Both are potent wallbreakers, breaking through specially defensive walls that Latias and other teammates struggle with breaking, such as Mantine.</p>"

      "Bulky Calm Mind (Dragon)": {
        "description": "<p>Mega Latias can be a very potent wincon on Dragon teams due to its fantastic combination of bulk, Speed, and the notorious famous BoltBeam coverage, which allows it to be effective in many matchups such as Flying, Water, Ground, and Dragon. Calm Mind enables Mega Latias to clean weakened teams and handle Mega Diancie and Greninja after a few boosts, which otherwise threaten it. Roost is to boost its longevity so it can use Calm Mind throughout the match. Thunderbolt threatens a majority of Water-types and Flying-types, making said matchups easier. Ice Beam hits Ground-types and opposing Dragon-types super effectively. Try to use Mega Latias conservatively early-game to damage key threats weak to either Ice Beam or Thunderbolt. Only attempt a sweep once all of its checks are weakened. Levitate is Mega Latias's only ability and can be incredibly helpful in the Ground matchup. Maximum investment in Speed and HP in tandem with a Timid nature allows Mega Latias to become as fast as possible, outpacing threats like Landorus and Keldeo, while taking advantage of its fantastic bulk to set up Calm Mind more easily.</p> <p>Mega Latias is most used as a wincon, so teammates that can help it sweep are appreciated. Dragalge provides Toxic Spikes support to help wear down Mega Latias's checks for it to sweep late-game and can also switch into Fairy-type attacks for it. Stealth Rock support from Duraludon or Garchomp is similarly helpful to weaken the few checks Mega Latias has. Mega Latias is walled by the majority of Steel-types; therefore, Pokemon that can defeat Steel-types such as Hydreigon and Kommo-o are useful. In particular, Kommo-o can form a sweeping core while taking on types that Mega Latias can't do much against, such as by taking on Blissey on Normal and Tyranitar on Dark. Hydreigon also notably helps in Ghost-type matchups. Latios can outspeed threats faster than Mega Latias and blow away hazards with Defog. Dragonite can beat fast threats to Mega Latias such as Gengar and Greninja, as it provides a priority move in Extreme Speed and Multiscale.</p>"

However, losing the ability to safely pivot is not desired; Blissey is a better Toxic user; and Close Combat's drawback forces Staraptor out more than often, draining much needed momentum. Bulky Staraptor may also hit certain Speed benchmarks to outspeed Adamant Breloom or Tapu Bulu; however, Staraptor usually wants the maximum bulk it can get to switch into powerful physically offensive Pokemon. A Choice Band set with an Adamant nature and Reckless powers up Staraptor to absurd levels, enabling it to break through specially defensive Celesteela and Mega Slowbro with its STAB moves. However, Staraptor's supportive capabilities are much more appreciated for bulkier Normal teams, and more offensive ones benefit more from Staraptor's revenge killing potential.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Normal</h4> <p><strong>Status</strong>: All status aliments greatly hamper Staraptor's roles in the match. Toxic poison puts Staraptor on a timer, meaning it cannot remove entry hazards or spam its recoil STAB moves as reliably. Burns make offensive Staraptor a liability while turning the defensive set into a passive duck. Last but not least, paralysis makes Staraptor's hazard removal less reliable and takes away its valuable Speed, forcing it to move last more often than not and, thus, take a hit first.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers like Hydreigon and Latios easily bypass Staraptor because of its subpar Special Defense.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Despite fearing Close Combat from the offensive set, Steel-types like Excadrill and Duraludon resist Staraptor's Brave Bird and can, therefore, comfortably switch in on it. Bulkier ones like Aegislash and Celesteela deserve a special mention because they easily shrug off everything Staraptor throws at them and are able to heavily cripple it with Toxic and Leech Seed, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types like Mega Tyranitar and Nihilego resist Staraptor's STAB moves and can beat it with their Rock-type attacks. However, they must be wary of Close Combat inflicting sizable damage.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Even though defensive Staraptor is considerably bulky when factoring in Intimidate, powerful physical wallbreakers like Choice Band Victini and Diggersby outspeed and can still 2HKO it after the Attack drop.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Super effective attacks from the likes of Tapu Koko, Greninja, and Mega Garchomp can KO Staraptor without much trouble.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Certain setup sweepers like Mega Scizor and Z-Happy Hour Jirachi use Staraptor as setup fodder, being able to easily beat it once they rack up their boosts.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls such as Hippowdon, Celesteela, and Galarian Corsola shrug off Staraptor's attacks with relative ease and can just recover their lost HP afterwards or cripple it with status moves.</p>",

      "Defensive Defog (Normal)": {
        "description": "<p>Defensive Staraptor is an excellent entry hazard remover and defensive pivot available for Normal teams because of its good bulk, Intimidate, and a typing that grants a key neutrality to Fighting-type attacks. Defog is key for removing otherwise troublesome entry hazards, notably Toxic Spikes, for Normal-type teams. Roost is important to keep Staraptor healthy, increasing its longevity and letting it perform its supportive roles throughout the match. Brave Bird is Staraptor's main form of dealing damage, hitting dangerous threats like Keldeo, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Venusaur super effectively. It also hits offensive Pokemon such as Greninja and Tapu Lele hard, meaning they can't switch in freely on Staraptor. U-turn rounds off the set, switching Staraptor out of unfavorable situations and maintaining valuable momentum for the team by bringing the team's offensive Pokemon onto the field safely. Staraptor should be used cautiously, as it is greatly appreciated to switch into Fighting-type attacks and constantly ward off entry hazards for the team. Maximum HP and Defense investment alongside an Impish nature maximizes Staraptor's natural bulk. Intimidate is needed to patch Staraptor's only average bulk by weakening physical attackers such as Buzzwole and Mimikyu, enabling it to comfortably switch in on them. Heavy-Duty Boots ignores Stealth Rock damage, letting Staraptor come in unscathed to use Defog.</p> <p>All of Staraptor's teammates benefit from its defensive and supportive roles. Blissey appreciates Staraptor's ability to switch into threatening Fighting-types and physical attackers like Choice Scarf Terrakion and Rillaboom. In return, Blissey absorbs status for Staraptor by virtue of its Natural Cure, safely brings Staraptor onto the field via Teleport for it to remove entry hazards, can spread Toxic poison, and easily shrugs off powerful special assaults from the likes of Tapu Koko and Nidoking that check Staraptor. Porygon2's sheer bulk and great coverage permit it to check sweepers that use Staraptor as setup fodder, such as defensive Mega Scizor and Bisharp. In return, it greatly enjoys Staraptor's hazard removal so it can be brought onto the field intact and, therefore, wall a wider range of attackers. Similarly, Ditto is another good partner because it revenge kills most of the threats that use Staraptor as setup fodder, like Swords Dance Excadrill and Z-Belly Drum Azumarill. It also serves as a backup switch-in versus walls that can cripple Staraptor with forms of residual damage, such as Toxapex and Celesteela. Mega Lopunny checks troublesome Steel-, Rock-, and Ice-types like Aegislash, Tyranitar, and Mamoswine for Staraptor and greatly benefits from its access to a fast U-turn. Diggersby's sheer power enables it to break through defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn that Staraptor cannot bypass. It also has a valuable Electric immunity, meaning it can switch into predicted Electric-type attacks that target Staraptor. With its Ghost-type Z-Conversion set, Porygon-Z deals with annoying Pokemon like Jirachi and Galarian Corsola. Conversely, Porygon-Z loves Staraptor's support because that allows it to avoid chip damage from entry hazards and, therefore, pull off a sweep more easily. Mega Pidgeot takes pressure off of Staraptor by offensively checking Fighting-types and has a slot freed to run more effective moves thanks to Staraptor's access to Defog.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf (Normal)": {
        "description": "<p>Staraptor's respectable offensive traits make it suitable as a Choice Scarf revenge killer that finds its place on offensively oriented Normal teams. Brave Bird is Staraptor's go-to attack, nailing Fighting-, Grass-, and Bug-types like Mega Gallade, Zarude, and Volcarona while inflicting hefty damage to frailer offensive Pokemon such as Latios and Blacephalon. Close Combat provides valuable coverage, hitting some of the Rock- and Steel-types that resist Brave Bird, like Tyranitar and Excadrill, hard. U-turn allows Staraptor to work as an offensive pivot, taking advantage of the switches it forces to generate momentum for the team. Complementing the set is Double-Edge, a secondary STAB move that has the primary function of heavily damaging Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Zeraora that resist Brave Bird. Alternatively, Final Gambit's sacrificing blow may be used instead to nuke defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Skarmory in matchups Staraptor cannot typically leave its mark against with its other moves. Maximum Attack and Speed EVs guarantee Staraptor is as powerful and as fast as possible. Choice Scarf in conjunction with a Jolly nature enables Staraptor to outpace common Choice Scarf wielders such as Krookodile, Urshifu-R, and Excadrill as well as Mega Tyranitar after a Dragon Dance boost while Speed tying with Choice Scarf Victini and Volcarona after a Quiver Dance. Reckless is the best ability this set can have, letting Staraptor nab crucial KOs with a boosted Brave Bird or Double-Edge. However, Intimidate's utility against physical attackers is an option if the extra power isn't necessary and is the better choice alongside Final Gambit.</p> <p>Stealth Rock setters like Smeargle and Blissey are paramount for offensive Staraptor to function better given the residual damage allows Staraptor to score crucial OHKOs against threats like Tapu Koko, Nidoking, and Zeraora. Particularly, Smeargle also sets Sticky Web, slowing down faster Choice Scarf users like Greninja and Terrakion for Staraptor, while Blissey can safely bring Staraptor onto the field via Teleport. Ditto and Staraptor make a very good revenge killing combination, both being able to outspeed and beat dangerous Pokemon like Dragon Dance Gyarados, taking away pressure from each other. Ditto also switches in on certain walls that Staraptor cannot bypass, like Celesteela and Mandibuzz. Diggersby is a great companion for Staraptor because of its sheer power, which allows it to shatter defensive Pokemon Staraptor has trouble dealing with, such as Toxapex and Hippowdon. It has a valuable Electric immunity as well, enabling Staraptor to safely switch or pivot out of a predicted Electric-type attack. Mega Lopunny can check Steel- and Rock-types like Heatran, Ferrothorn, Magnezone, and Tyranitar, freeing Staraptor to spam its most powerful moves in the Fire, Grass, Electric, and Dark matchups. Similarly, Porygon-Z removes annoyances to Staraptor like Jirachi, Mega Slowbro, and Celesteela, with its Z-Conversion set. Mega Pidgeot forms a Flying-type spam core with offensive Staraptor, with the former beating physical walls like Skarmory and Ferrothorn and the latter removing special walls like Rotom-W and Mantine. It can also remove entry hazards with Defog, preserving Staraptor's durability. Indeedee-M beats threatening priority wielders that easily pick off Staraptor, like Mamoswine and Bisharp. Despite not doing this as reliably, Indeedee-F has Healing Wish to fully restore Staraptor's health late-game.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Recover gives Gastrodon reliable recovery and lets it fulfill the role of a wall. Scald's potential burn specifically threatens physical sweepers such as Dragonite and Excadrill. Earth Power makes Gastrodon able to take on Steel-types, such as Excadrill and Heatran, and Toxapex after a Storm Drain boost. Earthquake is an option that OHKOes Alolan Raichu and breaks the Substitutes of Keldeo and Mega Gallade, making it more difficult for them to setup. Toxic lets Gastrodon spread status and cripple opposing walls that brush off or are unaffected by its STAB moves, such as Rotom-W, Staraptor, and Porygon2. Clear Smog prevents threatening setup sweepers from setting up, such as Azumarill, Kommo-o, and Latias. Storm Drain in conjunction with Gastrodon's typing gives Ground teams a valuable Water immunity and Ice neutrality. The EV spread and Bold nature give Gastrodon as much physical bulk as possible; a Relaxed nature is preferred if you opt for Earthquake.</p> <p>Gastrodon fits on both sand and non-sand Ground teams, as all Ground-types appreciate its immunity to Water and Ice neutrality. On sand teams, Hippowdon is a good physical wall and sand setter to pair with Gastrodon because it can set entry hazards and phaze with Whirlwind. Excadrill can spin away entry hazards such as Toxic Spikes that are a detriment to Gastrodon's longevity and break through foes that have been worn down from Gastrodon's Toxic or Scald burn. Landorus makes a great teammate on both sand and non-sand teams to wallbreak and take on Grass- and Steel-types that Gastrodon is unable to, such as Mega Venusaur and Celesteela, thanks to its Gravity support and Sheer Force and Life Orb-boosted Earth Power. Mamoswine gives Ground teams another Ice switch-in due to Thick Fat, can take on Dragon- and Flying-types that wear Gastrodon down such as Latios and Zapdos, and has access to priority in Ice Shard that can break Dragonite's Multiscale. Mega Garchomp is another great teammate that survives an Aqua Jet from Azumarill after a Belly Drum and OHKOes it with Earthquake. Mega Steelix is a viable option that helps Gastrodon specifically in the Fairy and Ice matchups, since it can take on Tapu Bulu and Galarian Darmanitan with relative ease.</p>"

Particularly, Mega Kick is able to OHKO Tapu Lele while unboosted and 2HKO Toxapex and Mega Venusaur at +1. However, its accuracy is extremely undesired, and, most of the time, Return scores the same KOs in a more reliable fashion. On the wallbreaker set, Focus Punch is a viable option to surprise some of Mega Lopunny's switch-ins like Celesteela and Skarmory, but it is very prediction reliant and using it means dropping a generally more useful move. Similarly, Substitute fits in over Encore, making Mega Lopunny harder to revenge kill while taking advantage of the switches it forces to get setup opportunities. It also shines in the Normal matchup because of its buffer against Ditto, but Encore's general utility is usually preferred.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Normal</h4> <p><strong>Status</strong>: All status aliments greatly compromise Mega Lopunny's effectiveness. Paralysis takes away its amazing Speed tier, leaving it vulnerable to be outsped and KOed by a myriad of opposing Pokemon. Burn halves its Attack stat, turning it into a liability throughout the match. Last but not least, Toxic poison gradually wears it down.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Although the wallbreaker set can bypass them if well played, physical walls like Hippowdon and Mega Venusaur easily shrug off Mega Lopunny's moves and can severely damage it back or just replenish their health. Toxapex and Slowbro deserve a special mention because aside from stopping unboosted Mega Lopunny in its tracks, they can also threaten to burn it with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster revenge killers like Zeraora, Mega Aerodactyl, and Choice Scarf Terrakion outspeed and OHKO Mega Lopunny with their super effective moves. If Mega Lopunny is weakened enough, Pokemon like Choice Scarf Excadrill and Greninja can easily dispose of it.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types like Mega Gallade and Victini can take any attack Mega Lopunny launches at them and, in return, are able to defeat it. However, if they're slower, U-turn can do sizable chip damage to them.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Clefable, Mega Altaria, and Tapu Fini are able to shrug off Mega Lopunny's damaging moves and can beat it with their Fairy-type STAB attacks.

Fake Out lets Mega Lopunny move first, inflicting chip damage on faster offensive targets like Zeraora and Choice Scarf Greninja and putting Pokemon like Keldeo and Tapu Bulu in KO range from its other moves. Close Combat is Mega Lopunny's go-to attack, nailing Rock-, Steel-, and Dark-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, and Mega Sableye. It also 2HKOes most neutral targets by virtue of its raw power. Triple Axel beautifully complements Close Combat, enabling Mega Lopunny to beat Dragon-types like Dragonite and Garchomp while also turning it into a threat against Dark, Flying, and Ground teams by OHKOing Gliscor and Landorus, as well as 2HKOing Mandibuzz, Zapdos, and specially defensive Hippowdon. U-turn rounds off the set, taking advantage of the walls like Slowbro and Torkoal Mega Lopunny forces onto the field as a way to generate momentum for the team while whittling down the opposition. Maximum Attack and Speed investment alongside a Jolly nature bolsters Mega Lopunny's offensive potential. Limber should be used as the pre-Mega ability because it grants Lopunny a useful immunity to paralysis before Mega Evolving. Scrappy gives Mega Lopunny perfect neutral coverage by letting it hit Ghost-types with its STAB moves and lets it ignore Intimidate from Staraptor and Landorus-T.</p> <p>All of Mega Lopunny's teammates benefit from its capability to take on Steel-, Ghost-, and Rock-type Pokemon that are problematic for Normal teams. Blissey is a great partner, as it can absorb status for Mega Lopunny with its Natural Cure, supply Stealth Rock support, and bring it safely onto the field via Teleport. In return, Mega Lopunny shreds the likes of Mega Sableye and Ferrothorn and is able to comfortably switch into undesired Knock Offs for it. Diggersby forms an exceptional offensive core with Mega Lopunny; with its extreme power, it can defeat certain defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Mega Venusaur that stop Mega Lopunny cold. Conversely, Mega Lopunny revenge kills threats faster than Diggersby such as Nidoking and Greninja and can bring it safely onto the field with U-turn. Choice Scarf Ditto is able to outspeed and either beat or force out threats to Mega Lopunny like Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Altaria. Defensive Staraptor shrugs off physical Fighting-type attacks directed at Mega Lopunny such as Choice Scarf Terrakion's Close Combat, blows away entry hazards with Defog, and has U-turn to form a pivoting core with it. Similarly, Porygon2's sheer bulk enables it to comfortably tank attacks from revenge killers like Choice Scarf Excadrill and safely Teleport out, getting Mega Lopunny into battle unscathed as a result.

Power-Up Punch boosts Mega Lopunny's already high Attack stat to astronomical levels while not being stopped by Taunt. Encore is a very useful tool to lock slower Pokemon like Jirachi and Mantine into support or recovery moves, giving Mega Lopunny free setup opportunities with Power-Up Punch or valuable momentum for the team. Return is Mega Lopunny's most reliable STAB move and its main way to dish out damage; after a boost, it can 2HKO most physical walls that don't resist it, such as Zapdos and Clefable, as well as OHKO frailer Pokemon like Nidoking and Volcarona. Close Combat complements Mega Lopunny's perfect coverage, nailing bulky Steel- and Rock-types that resist Return, such as Aegislash and Cradily, as well as Dark-types like Hydreigon. Maximum Attack and Speed EVs with a Jolly nature make Mega Lopunny as powerful and fast as possible. Limber is Lopunny's pre-Mega ability, which grants it a useful paralysis immunity before it Mega Evolves.

Ditto is able to pick off faster Pokemon that threaten to revenge kill Mega Lopunny, such as Excadrill under sand and Zeraora. Defensive Staraptor switches into physical Fighting-types like Choice Scarf Buzzwole and Infernape, keeps entry hazards off the field with Defog, and can safely get Mega Lopunny in with its U-turn, allowing Mega Lopunny to enter the battlefield unscathed.

Mega Garchomp also appreciates sand set up by Hippowdon which further increases the damage done by its Rock- and Ground-type attacks. Landorus can break through Grass-type teams, deal with Grass-type threats like Ferrothorn and Tapu Bulu and also provide the team with a solid special wallbreaker. It can also set up Gravity, helping against Flying-types like Celesteela and Skarmory. Mega Steelix is a great teammate, as it can switch in against physical attackers that Hippowdon is threatened by, like Tapu Bulu, while also aiding greatly in matchups such as Dragon, Normal, and Fairy. Much like Landorus, Nidoking can act a great special attacker, breaking through Flying-, Water-, and Steel-type teams through its great Sheer Force-boosted coverage options in Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, and Ice Beam. Nidoking can also provide Toxic Spikes support, which helps greatly in matchups like Psychic and Fairy. Mamoswine is a great teammate that can improve the Flying-, Grass-, and Dragon-type matchups while also providing a semi-reliable switch-in against Ice-type attacks directed at Hippowdon thanks to Thick Fat. Gliscor is a great stallbreaker and absorber of status moves directed at Hippowdon, and it can opt to run Defog if necessary, providing a means of hazard control.</p>"

Choice Scarf turns Mamoswine into a decent revenge killer that can outspeed the likes of Tapu Koko, Zeraora, and Barraskewda without rain, but it loses a ton of extra damage output without Choice Band, making it more difficult to wallbreak.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Ground</h4> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Physically defensive walls such as Mega Slowbro, Skarmory, and Swampert are able to take attacks from Mamoswine and wear it down with Scald, Body Press, or Flip Turn, respectively. However, Swampert's lack of reliable recovery means that it can easily be pressured by Mamoswine's teammates.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burn significantly reduces Mamoswine's damage output, leaving it unable to function as a wallbreaker. Toxic consistently wears Mamoswine down, making it difficult for it to stay in the field for a long time.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Offensive Water-types such as Mega Swampert, Urshifu-R, and Mega Gyarados can outspeed Mamoswine and KO it with their STAB moves. Bulky Water-types such as Tapu Fini, Slowbro, Swampert, and Suicune are able to tank attacks from Mamoswine and 2HKO it with Scald, with Tapu Fini and Suicune outspeeding Mamoswine as well.</p> <p><strong>Rotom-W</strong>: Rotom-W is one of the most consistent checks to Mamoswine, being immune to its Earthquake due to Levitate and resisting its Icicle Crash. Rotom-W is able to either KO Mamoswine with a powerful Hydro Pump or cripple it or another teammate with Will-O-Wisp or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types like Heracross, Mega Gallade, Terrakion, and Kommo-o after a boost can all outspeed Mamoswine and KO it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Mamoswine sits at a mediocre Speed tier for an offensive Pokemon, making it outsped and KOed by a myriad of powerful revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny, Keldeo, Tapu Lele, Blacephalon, and Rillaboom due to Grassy Glide.</p>",

Icicle Crash allows it to get rid of Mandibuzz, Tapu Bulu, and Dragonite. Ice Shard provides useful priority for fast threats like Landorus, Hydreigon, Latias, and Latios, especially if they are weakened. Superpower is a useful move for targeting Ferrothorn and Porygon2; however, Knock Off gets rid of items like Eviolite, Leftovers, and Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon such as Galarian Corsola, Porygon2, Celesteela, and Blissey. An Adamant nature paired with a Choice Band maximizes Mamoswine's damage output, letting it pick off weakened threats with Ice Shard better and have a better chance of KOing a weakened Celesteela or Corviknight. Thick Fat is the preferred ability to give Ground teams a useful resistance to Ice-type attacks. Generally, Mamoswine should be used to wallbreak types like Flying, Poison, and Dragon early-game, and it can clean weakened teams with Ice Shard late-game.</p> <p>Hippowdon is a great partner, as it tanks hits for Mamoswine due to its good bulk, can phaze out threatening foes like Mega Scizor and Mega Gallade with Whirlwind, and provide Stealth Rock and Sand Stream support, which gives Mamoswine an easier time sweeping late-game by racking chip damage on foes. Landorus is an essential wallbreaker, as it can not only break through physically defensive foes like Slowbro and Mega Sableye for Mamoswine, but utilize Gravity in order to make Mamoswine's Earthquake useful against threats like Celesteela, Rotom-W, and Corviknight. Gastrodon and Seismitoad can absorb Water-type attacks for Mamoswine; Gastrodon has access to reliable recovery, and Seismitoad can outspeed and threaten Azumarill as well as use its higher physical bulk to take attacks from Pokemon like Barraskewda more easily. Excadrill is a dangerous sweeper under Hippowdon's sand due to Sand Rush, which allows it to outspeed fast threats like Mega Lopunny and Terrakion for Mamoswine, and it provides Rapid Spin support while breaking past physically defensive foes like Mega Sableye, Porygon2, and Avalugg with Steelium Z and Swords Dance. Garchomp can break through most walls due to Swords Dance and Dragonium Z while weakening Celesteela with Fire Fang and providing a useful neutrality to Water- and Grass-type attacks. Mega Garchomp can destroy foes like Celesteela and Ferrothorn with Fire Blast while living an Aqua Jet from +6 Azumarill and threatening it back with a Sand Force-boosted Earthquake. Mega Steelix is a powerful bulky sweeper with Curse that can also live a hit from +6 Azumarill's Aqua Jet and threaten it back with Heavy Slam, and it also threatens other foes like Tapu Bulu and Rillaboom.</p>"

Additionally, its Water typing means it can check Fire- and Water-types such as Blacephalon, Victini, and Urshifu-R that are otherwise difficult to deal with for Electric teams. Volt Switch can bring in offensive teammates like Tapu Koko, Regieleki, and Zeraora safely in a match. It also works very well in tandem with Hydro Pump, as Rotom-W can pressure numerous Ground-types and prevent them from blocking Volt Switch. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers like Mega Gallade, Weavile, and Garchomp, and it is especially effective against switch-ins like Tapu Bulu and Rillaboom. Pain Split is helpful if Rotom-W is weakened, healing off of high-HP foes such as Blissey. Alternatively, Defog may be used to let Rotom-W act as an entry hazard remover on teams should Zapdos lack Defog. Leftovers gives Rotom-W a form of recovery outside of Pain Split, making it weakened less easily. 44 Speed EVs are used in order to outspeed Jolly Azumarill, while 252 HP and 212 Special Defense EVs along with a Calm nature make Rotom-W more effective against special attackers such as Blacephalon, Greninja, and Choice Specs Pelipper.</p> <p>All teammates benefit from Rotom-W's typing allowing it to notably check Ground-, Fire-, and Water-types such as Sand Rush Excadrill, Mamoswine, Blacephalon, and Urshifu-R, as Electric teams otherwise have limited defensive checks to these Pokemon. Zapdos forms an excellent defensive core with Rotom-W, as Zapdos can deal with Grass-types that give Rotom-W trouble such as Tapu Bulu, Rillaboom, and Ferrothorn. Additionally, Zapdos can take on Mold Breaker Excadrill, which is very problematic for Rotom-W and the rest of Electric teams. Choice Specs Zapdos can also be used to break through additional Grass-types like Mega Venusaur and Cradily with a powerful STAB Hurricane. Tapu Koko and Play Rough Zeraora can deal with numerous Dragon-types that Rotom-W heavily struggles against such as Kommo-o, Mega Latias, and Hydreigon. Additionally, Tapu Koko can pressure troublesome Ground-types for Rotom-W like Gastrodon, Seismitoad, and Swampert with Grass Knot. Zeraora pressures specially defensive walls such as Blissey and Galarian Slowking for Rotom-W. Alolan Raichu can take on threats like Mega Venusaur due to its Psychic typing while utilizing Grass Knot in order to defeat Ground-types that give Rotom-W trouble, such as Gastrodon, Seismitoad, and Swampert. Regieleki appreciates Rotom-W's ability to eliminate most Ground-types with Hydro Pump, giving it a great opportunity to break through the opposing team with its powerful Electric-type moves. Alolan Golem and Magnezone can trap and eliminate Steel-types such as Mold Breaker Excadrill and Ferrothorn, with both often being immune to Excadrill's Earthquake due to Air Balloon.</p>"

Foul Play lets Mandibuzz greatly damage physical attackers like Mega Gallade, Dragonite, and Victini while also punishing setup sweepers like Mega Scizor, Mega Charizard X, and Excadrill. Roost allows Mandibuzz to keep itself healthy, giving it longevity and thus allowing it to be an effective defensive pivot throughout the game. Defog is a good utility move that is greatly appreciated by teammates of Mandibuzz, as it keeps them safe from entry hazards like Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes that may plague the entire team. Lastly, U-turn lets Mandibuzz gain momentum on a predicted switch-in against it and bring in an appropriate teammate in the battle safely. 16 Speed EVs let it outspeed Adamant Belly Drum Azumarill and check it with Foul Play. The rest of the EVs are invested into HP and Defense to optimize its overall bulk. Heavy-Duty Boots is used as an item so that Mandibuzz can freely switch in without getting chipped down by Stealth Rock, making it harder for the opposing team to wear it down. Overcoat makes Mandibuzz immune to Spore from Breloom and Amoonguss while also keeping it safe from sand and hail damage.</p> <p>Teammates like Weavile and Greninja like Mandibuzz switching in against physical attacks aimed at them from Pokemon like Excadrill and it creating momentum with U-turn to bring them in safely as well as clearing entry hazards away and allowing them to wallbreak foes much more effectively. Specially defensive Tyranitar can form a defensive core with Mandibuzz, since it can take on special attacks aimed at Mandibuzz while also providing Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave support. Mega Sableye takes the pressure off of Mandibuzz and can check threats like Mega Gallade that can otherwise break apart Dark-type teams, additionally bouncing back any status move aimed at Mandibuzz from Pokemon like Gastrodon and Swampert. It also does great against opposing entry hazard setters like Tyranitar, Blissey, and Ferrothorn. Hydreigon can take care of walls like Toxapex and Hippowdon that Mandibuzz can struggle against. Alolan Muk and Bisharp can cover Fairy-types like Clefable. The former can also absorb special attacks aimed at Mandibuzz well and act as a good wincon when running Curse, while the latter is a good setup sweeper and wallbreaker against defensive types like Poison. Zarude can cover Water-type teams and beat threatening Pokemon like Urshifu-R.</p>"

Fire Blast hits walls such as Gliscor and Mandibuzz hard and beats Steel-types such as Celesteela and Ferrothorn. Psychic helps Volcarona in dealing with troublesome Poison types such as Toxapex. Hidden Power Ground bypasses Heatran after its Air Balloon has been popped, which can otherwise wall it. Giga Drain can be used instead to nail bulky Water- and Ground-types such as Gastrodon, Slowking, and Hippowdon while also granting a bit of recovery. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Volcarona to switch in throughout the game despite its huge Stealth Rock weakness. Volcarona should try setting up against a passive Pokemon like Toxapex or Mandibuzz once its checks such as Mantine are weakened or KOed, allowing it to pull off a clean sweep. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Volcarona to outspeed Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Mimikyu unboosted while outspeeding Choice Scarf users such as Excadrill and Landorus-T after a Quiver Dance boost.</p> <p>Choice Scarf users like Buzzwole and Heracross are great partners to revenge kill faster threats such as Garchomp and Mega Lopunny. Volcarona in return can weaken opposing teams, allowing them to clean with Beast Boost and Moxie boosts, respectively. Heracross can also Pursuit trap offensive Heatran and pop its Air Balloon, thus allowing Volcarona to KO it with Hidden Power Ground, while Buzzwole helps against Dragon- and Ground-types like Landorus and Zygarde-10% with Ice Punch. Shuckle provides Stealth Rock and Sticky Web support; Stealth Rock chips foes while also breaking Focus Sash and Sturdy, while Sticky Web allows Volcarona to outspeed Choice Scarf users like Greninja and Nihilego after a boost. Araquanid can switch into strong special Water-type attacks directed towards Volcarona while also checking Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y that resist Volcarona's coverage. Galvantula is also helpful in beating Water- and Flying-types such as Toxapex and Mantine. Furthermore, both Araquanid and Galvantula can also provide Sticky Web support. Scizor is great to deal with Rock-types like Tyranitar and Mega Diancie and Pursuit trap threats to Volcarona such as Choice Scarf Latias, and Choice Band Victini after the V-Create Speed drop. Mega Scizor also forms a great offensive core with Volcarona, taking on special walls such as Blissey while Volcarona handles physical ones such as Celesteela and Hippowdon. Mega Pinsir is helpful against Choice Scarf users like Keldeo and Zarude, which could threaten Volcarona, with its strong priority in Quick Attack while also beating special walls like Tyranitar for it.

Quiver Dance notably allows Volcarona to outspeed threats like Tapu Koko and Zygarde-10% after a boost. Fire Blast hits neutral targets such as Zapdos for good damage while nailing Grass- and Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Aegislash. Firium Z turns Fire Blast into a one-time nuke in form of Inferno Overdrive, allowing it to OHKO Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur and specially defensive Zapdos after a boost. Volcarona running Firium Z uses Hidden Power Ground to better deal with Steel-type teams by beating Heatran, while Psychium Z variants run Psychic to for strong Shattered Psyche that bypasses one of its biggest checks in Toxapex. Giga Drain helps in hitting bulky Water-types like Slowking and Swampert while acting as a semi-reliable form of recovery. Volcarona should avoid switching in when Stealth Rock is up or getting poisoned or paralyzed, as both greatly harm its sweeping potential. Its checks like Mantine and Tyranitar should also be taken care of before it attempts to pull off a sweep. Maximum Speed investment alongside a Timid nature makes Volcarona outspeed threats like Choice Scarf Excadrill after a boost and Speed tie other base 100s like Galarian Zapdos unboosted.</p> <p>Armaldo and Forretress are mandatory teammates for Z-Move Volcarona, as they can clear Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin while providing their own Stealth Rock support, giving Volcarona an easier time securing KOs. Armaldo can check Fire-types like Choice Scarf Victini with Stone Edge, while Forretress can further bring in Volcarona safely with a slow Volt Switch and also takes on Rock-types such as Terrakion with Gyro Ball. Mega Scizor is great to take on threating Pokemon such as Mega Diancie, Nihilego, and Terrakion with Bullet Punch while also beating special walls such as Mantine and Tyranitar that Volcarona struggles with. Choice Scarf Heracross or Buzzwole further helps Volcarona in dealing with faster threats such as Mega Lopunny and Zarude. Additionally, Heracross can Pursuit trap offensive Heatran and Victini, popping the former's Air Balloon for Volcarona running Hidden Power Ground and potentially removing the latter after a V-Create, while Buzzwole can help against troublesome Dragon- and Flying-types such as Garchomp and Landorus-T with Ice Punch. Mega Heracross is good with Volcarona lacking Hidden Power Ground, as it can take on Heatran. It also forms a good wallbreaking core with Volcarona, helping in the Dark, Normal, and Rock matchups, which Volcarona puts little work in. Specially defensive Araquanid can be useful in dealing with Fire-types such as opposing Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y. Sticky Web support from the likes of Araquanid and Galvantula is greatly appreciated, as it allows Volcarona to outspeed troublesome Pokemon like Choice Scarf Nihilego and Greninja at +1.

Cobalion's decent defensive stats and good Speed mean it can successfully set Stealth Rock more often than not. Iron Head helps against Fairy-types that threaten Fighting-type teams like Mega Diancie and Tapu Lele. Taunt blocks foes from using Taunt and recovery moves, as well as blocking their own entry hazards or Defog to remove Cobalion's Stealth Rock. Thunder Wave is used to cripple faster offensive threats that Cobalion fails to do much against like Deoxys-S and Latios. Volt Switch can be used in lieu of Thunder Wave, making Coballion a great defensive pivot while maintaining offensive momentum. Justified allows it to switch into weak Dark-type attacks from the likes of Mandibuzz and gain an Attack boost.

Mantine and Pelipper both prevent Ground-types like Sand Rush Excadrill from threatening it. Mantine acts as a useful specially defensive wall that can hinder setup sweepers like Volcarona and Azumarill thanks to Haze, while Pelipper fits on offensive teams, can safely bring Greninja in with U-turn, and overwhelms Grass-types like Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur with Choice Specs-boosted Hurricane. Tapu Fini can deal with troublesome Dragon-types like boosted Kommo-o thanks to its part-Fairy typing and Calm Mind, and it provides Misty Terrain and Defog support.</p>"

Klefki's defensive typing is appreciated by Fairy teams, since it is immune to Poison-type attacks and can take on Steel-type attacks such as Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch comfortably. Maximum HP and Defense investment with a Bold nature ensures Klefki has as much physical bulk as possible.</p> <p>All of Klefki's teammates appreciate everything it provides, most notably setup sweepers. Azumarill is a good pairing, since it can take on Ground-types and safely set up with Belly Drum alongside Normalium Z or Sitrus Berry behind dual screens. Swords Dance Tapu Bulu is also able to take on Ground-types and appreciates dual screens as well, since it is easy for it to get off Substitute and set up. Mimikyu benefits from dual screens, as it can survive a few extra turns after setting up, even after its Disguise is broken. Mega Diancie makes for another great teammate to pair with Klefki because it can bounce back opposing entry hazards and has good coverage such as Mystical Fire to pick off Ferrothorn and other bulky Steel-types thanks to chip damage from Spikes. Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Tapu Lele and Choice Band Tapu Bulu appreciate Klefki's ability to cripple threats that would normally outspeed them, such as Gengar and Mega Aerodactyl. Tapu Koko can be used as a pivot to get Klefki on the battlefield safely if switching in with it is not optimal. Clefable can also provide extra utility in the form of setting Stealth Rocks and item removal with Knock Off.</p>"

Iron Defense allows Avalugg to consistently wall threats such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Scizor, and Alolan Golem while simultaneously boosting the power of Body Press. Toxic can slowly put offensive foes on a timer, but is hard to fit.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Ice</h4> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Volcarona, Victini, Blacephalon, and Mega Charizard Y can KO Avalugg with their powerful STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Keldeo, Mega Gallade, Kommo-o, and Terrakion can deal a good amount of damage to Avalugg with their STAB moves. However, after an Iron Defense boost, Avalugg can withstand a few hits from Terrakion and retaliate with a boosted Body Press.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Aegislash, Celesteela, and Heatran can beat Avalugg with ease. Aegislash completely walls Avalugg and can stall it with Substitute and Toxic or set up with Swords Dance, Celesteela defeats it with Leech Seed, Toxic, and Flamethrower, and Heatran has Fire-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: If Avalugg lacks a move they fear, then Rock-types such as Mega Tyranitar, Alolan Golem, and Mega Aerodactyl force Avalugg to take their powerful STAB moves. Nihilego is an especially great check to Avalugg, since it's a special attacker. However, Avalugg can beat Mega Aerodactyl with Avalanche and the other aforementioned Rock-types with Body Press.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic wears down Avalugg, making it harder for it to check Pokemon. Burn's Attack drop makes it difficult for Avalugg to apply pressure on Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Avalugg's Special Defense stat is poor, making it vulnerable to many prominent special attackers in the tier, such as Tapu Koko, Landorus, Blacephalon, Tapu Lele, and Latios to name a few.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types spinblock Avalugg and are immune to Body Press, limiting Avalugg without Avalanche to Roar and Recover.

Rapid Spin allows Avalugg to remove opposing entry hazards for its teammates. Roar phazes setup sweepers like Mimikyu and Mega Altaria that Avalugg cannot touch with Body Press, or Mega Tyranitar if it runs Avalanche. Body Press works well in conjunction with Avalugg's high Defense stat, letting it hit Steel-, Dark-, and Rock-types such as Ferrothorn, Excadrill, Bisharp, and Tyranitar. However, Avalanche allows Avalugg to deal good damage to Zapdos, Landorus, and Tapu Bulu that it otherwise relies on Roar to handle. Heavy-Duty Boots is invaluable, as it provides an immunity to entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, to prevent Avalugg from being chipped and breaking its Sturdy. Avalugg should generally avoid status aliments such as Toxic and getting hit by Knock Off, since it will be too weakened to check the aforementioned Pokemon. Sturdy allows Avalugg to survive moves from powerful attackers like Hydreigon, Keldeo, and Victini, successfully using Rapid Spin against them.</p> <p>All of Avalugg's teammates appreciate its defensive utility, especially since Ice teams are vulnerable to entry hazards. Alolan Ninetales can deal with Fighting-types such as Kommo-o, Keldeo, and Mega Gallade. Additionally, it provides defensive support through Aurora Veil, giving Avalugg an opportunity to wall threats such as Mega Lopunny, Terrakion, Excadrill, and Bisharp. Choice Scarf Weavile is particularly useful for revenge killing Ghost-types such as Aegislash, Blacephalon, Gengar, and Spectrier that spinblock Avalugg, trapping them with Pursuit. Piloswine forms a nice defensive core with Avalugg; Thick Fat and Eviolite let Piloswine take on Fire-types such as Volcarona, Blacephalon, and Mega Charizard Y, it can set Stealth Rock to let Avalugg chip down foes with Roar, and it can absorb attacks from most special attackers like Tapu Koko, Alolan Raichu, Hydreigon, and Nihilego. Galarian Darmanitan is capable of revenge killing Steel-types like Aegislash, Celesteela, and Heatran with the combination of Flare Blitz and Earthquake, especially if it's running a Choice Scarf. Cloyster especially appreciates Rapid Spin support from Avalugg, as it can preserve its occasional Focus Sash and get an easier sweep with Shell Smash.</p>"

Diamond Storm allows Mega Diancie to hit Pokemon such as Volcarona, Tornadus-T, and Alolan Ninetales for super effective damage and fish for Defense boosts. Mystical Fire targets Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Celesteela switching in, and Mega Scizor if it attempts to use Swords Dance on Mega Diancie.

Hidden Power Ice allows Mega Diancie to take on Gliscor and Landorus. Earth Power, in conjunction with Mystical Fire, can be used instead for Mega Diancie to be very effective against Steel teams: it OHKOes Heatran, Excadrill, and Magnezone, hits Aegislash the hardest, and takes on threats such as weakened Mega Steelix. Diamond Storm + Mystical Fire + Hidden Power Ice allows Mega Diancie to hit all Flying-type Pokemon for super effective damage.

Klefki can set Spikes for Mega Diancie, allowing it to break through Pokemon such as Focus Sash Garchomp, and checks setup sweepers like Mega Scizor thanks to Foul Play. Additionally, screens from Klefki make Mega Diancie harder to revenge kill. On top of that, Klefki can paralyze faster threats such as Mega Aerodactyl for it. Tapu Koko can take on threats to Mega Diancie such as Celesteela while also stallbreaking against Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur with Taunt, allowing Mega Diancie to take it out with Psychic. Tapu Lele can take on Poison-type Pokemon such as Toxapex and Nidoking for Mega Diancie.

Tapu Bulu can take on Electric-, Ground-, and Water-type Pokemon for Mega Diancie such as Tapu Koko, Hippowdon, and Swampert with its Grass-type STAB moves, as well as providing passive recovery due to Grassy Terrain. Azumarill can help Mega Diancie take on Fire teams and handles Ground- and Steel-type Pokemon for it with Aqua Jet, and Brick Break to take out Melmetal, after Belly Drum. Mimikyu can easily take on Psychic teams for Mega Diancie after a Swords Dance, OHKO bulkier Pokemon with boosted Shadow Claw, and OHKO faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf Latias with boosted Shadow Sneak. Togekiss can be used to take on Grass-type Pokemon for Mega Diancie, such as Rillaboom, Mega Venusaur, and Ferrothorn, which Fairy teams struggle with. Togekiss can also help break past Steel-type Pokemon such as Melmetal with its coverage in Fire Blast and Aura Sphere.

Scald prevents Toxapex from becoming too passive while also allowing it to fish for burns against physical threats such as Rillaboom. Recover allows Toxapex to stay healthy through the match, especially alongside Regenerator recovery. Toxic Spikes allow Toxapex to support its offensive teammates by poisoning and chipping grounded foes. Toxic Spikes are especially useful in matchups such as Fairy, Psychic, and Dragon. Toxic, on the other hand, allows Toxapex to hit Flying-types and Levitate users such as Zapdos, Mega Latias, and Hydreigon, which can be a problem for Water teams. Haze allows Toxapex to check setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X, Autotomize Celesteela, and Swords Dance Aegislash. Baneful Bunker can be used to scout Choice-locked attackers such as Choice Specs Tapu Koko, gain recovery, and further take advantage of Toxic.

Gastrodon and Empoleon are other defensive teammates that can help Toxapex wear down the foe.

Flamethrower goes well with its Fighting typing, as it enables Kommo-o to take care of other Steel- and Ice-types such as Mega Scizor, Corviknight, and Avalugg. Taunt is used to avoid phazing from Whirlwind users like Skarmory and Hippowdon and Toxapex's Haze, along with blocking Toxic from Pokemon like Aegislash and Blissey. Clangorous Soul is an option over Taunt to boost Kommo-o's stats even further, but it makes Kommo-o prone to being phazed by Mantine and a healthy Skarmory and has a huge drawback of costing a third of its HP. Soundproof is used to make Ditto and opposing Kommo-o unable to revenge kill Kommo-o with Clanging Scales. A Naive nature with 252 Speed EVs allows it to outpace Pokemon like Mamoswine, speed tie with Nidoking, and outspeed Mega Lopunny and Zeraora after using Kommonium Z.</p> <p>Garchomp is great to pair with Kommo-o, as it can set up Stealth Rock and take care of Pokemon like Jirachi for it. Kyurem is great to help beat Water-types that can hinder Kommo-o like Tapu Fini and Greninja with Freeze-Dry. Dragalge can provide Toxic Spikes to make it easier for Kommo-o to sweep in Normal- and Dark-type matchups and can use Flip Turn to safely bring in Kommo-o. Dragalge's Poison typing also allows it to come into special Fairy-type attacks from Tapu Koko and Tapu Fini and take care of them with Sludge Wave. Dragalge can also absorb Toxic Spikes to protect Kommo-o from being poisoned. Mega Altaria pairs well with Kommo-o, forming a Dark-type breaking core with Mega Altaria taking care of Mega Sableye and Mandibuzz while Kommo-o takes care of Bisharp. Latias is great speed control for Dragon teams, as it can take care of Keldeo, Mega Swampert, and Cloyster after it uses Shell Smash. It is also useful to get rid of entry hazards with Defog and bring back Kommo-o to full health with Healing Wish. Mega Latias is a great teammate for Kommo-o, as it can help greatly in the Flying-type matchup by taking care of Tornadus-T and Zapdos thanks to its BoltBeam coverage. Hydreigon helps greatly in the Psychic- and Ghost-type matchups taking care of threats like Blacephalon and Celebi. Hydreigon can also bring Kommo-o in with U-turn.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Electric</h4> <p>Tapu Koko can opt for Expert Belt in lieu of Choice Specs to switch moves freely, further improving the Water- and Flying-type matchups. However, it generally appreciates the extra wallbreaking power provided by Choice Specs more, as it better deals with Dragon-type threats. Tapu Koko can also opt for a utility pivot set with Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Ice, U-turn, and Taunt along with Heavy Duty Boots. U-turn allows it to pivot out, even against Ground-types, and bring in its teammates, while Taunt helps against walls that rely on recovery such as Porygon2.</p> <h4>Fairy</h4> <p>Heavy-Duty Boots can be run over Magnet to make Tapu Koko less prone to being worn down by entry hazards, but it misses out on an extra boost to its Electric-type attacks. Grass Knot can be used over Taunt to hit Water-types such as Swampert and Gastrodon, but Tapu Koko would no longer be able to effectively shut down walls. Choice Specs allows Tapu Koko to become a fearsome wallbreaker, but it will be Choice-locked and the Flying matchup becomes tougher because the opponent can scout more easily. Shuca Berry is another option that eases Tapu Koko's ability to take on threatening Ground-types such as Gliscor and Landorus.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Electric</h4> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-type Pokemon like Mamoswine, Seismitoad, and Gastrodon that shrug off most of Tapu Koko's attacks can switch in against it and KO it with their STAB move,s while faster Ground-types like Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Sand Rush Excadrill outspeed and OHKO Tapu Koko with Earthquake. However, Ground-types like Hippowdon and Seismitoad need to be wary of Grass Knot, while Landorus and Gliscor fall against Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Defensive Grass-types like Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Cradily can comfortably switch in against any of Tapu Koko's attacks and lose little to no HP in the process. Mega Venusaur in particular can threaten to KO it with Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Specially defensive walls like Blissey and Alolan Muk can switch in against Tapu Koko, and Blissey can threaten to cripple it with status moves like Toxic, while Alolan Muk can threaten it with Poison Jab.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster threats like Choice Scarf Greninja, Choice Scarf Blacephalon, and Mega Aerodactyl that outspeed Tapu Koko threaten to revenge kill and OHKO it with their super effective coverage options after minor chip damage.</p> <h4>Fairy</h4> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Hippowdon, Excadrill, Gastrodon, and Swampert are examples of Ground-types that take very little damage from Hidden Power Ice and can OHKO Tapu Koko with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Electric-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Since Thunderbolt is Tapu Koko's main form of damage, it is forced out by anything that resists it.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Walls such as Blissey, Ferrothorn, and Tyranitar take little damage from Tapu Koko's strongest attacks, but they dislike being afflicted by Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Tapu Koko is prone to being revenge killed by fast foes like Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Greninja with their coverage moves such as Earthquake and Gunk Shot, respectively.</p>",

        "description": "<p>An amazing ability in Electric Surge that sets up Electric Terrain, bolstering Electric-type attacks of both itself and its teammates, along with an above average Speed tier and a great secondary typing in Fairy makes Tapu Koko a primary threat on Electric-type teams. Thunderbolt is amplified thanks to Electric Terrain. Dazzling Gleam helps deal with troublesome Dragon-, Fighting-, and Dark-type Pokemon such as unboosted Mega Altaria, Mega Gallade, and Zarude. Hidden Power Ice deals with troublesome Ground-types like Landorus and Gliscor, which freely switch in against Electric-type attacks. Volt Switch allows Tapu Koko to act as a great offensive pivot to maintain offensive pressure while to bring teammates safely into the field. Grass Knot can be used to better deal with Ground-types like Hippowdon and Swampert, which otherwise freely switch in against Tapu Koko. 4 Defense EVs ensure Tapu Koko always survives an Earthquake from Gliscor at full HP. Maximum Special Attack investment along with Choice Specs makes Tapu Koko a reliable wallbreaker, while maximum Speed along with a Timid nature ensures it outspeeds Pokemon like Weavile and Cinderace.</p> <p>Zapdos is a great teammate for Tapu Koko, as it provides a much needed Ground immunity and Defog support while also dealing with physical threats like Mega Scizor, Rillaboom, and Tapu Bulu. Defog helps Tapu Koko pivot freely, but Choice Specs Zapdos can also be a great teammate, as it comfortably deals with bulky Grass-types like Mega Venusaur and Cradily. Rotom-W provides a secondary Ground immunity with Levitate, can deal with Ground-types like Hippowdon and Mamoswine thanks to Hydro Pump, provides a switch-in against Fire- and Water-types like Choice Scarf Blacephalon and Mega Swampert, and cripples physical attackers like Mega Swampert thanks to Will-O-Wisp. Alolan Raichu easily benefits the most from Electric Terrain set up by Tapu Koko while also using it to revenge kill faster threats like Sand Rush Excadrill, Choice Scarf Greninja, and Mega Aerodactyl, which Tapu Koko fails to deal with. Alolan Raichu's Psychic can beat troublesome Poison-types like Mega Venusaur, while Focus Blast can get rid of troublesome walls like Ferrothorn, for Tapu Koko and Grass Knot can cover for Tapu Koko not running a move. Tapu Koko in return deals with troublesome Dark- and Dragon-types like Krookodile and Mega Latias. Zeraora is the best available physical attacker for Electric-type teams and can help greatly in the Normal-, Ghost-, and Dragon-type matchups thanks to Close Combat, Knock Off, and Play Rough, respectively, while also dealing with walls in Blissey and Ferrothorn that Tapu Koko falls short against. Choice Specs Regieleki pairs well as a monstrous wallbreaker with Rising Voltage when paired with Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain, being able to 2HKO major threats to Tapu Koko such as Mega Venusaur and Blissey and providing a secondary hazard control thanks to Rapid Spin. Magnezone is able to trap and deal with Steel-types that Tapu Koko fails to do anything significant against, such as Excadrill and Ferrothorn, and act as a reliable switch-in to Poison-type attacks directed at Tapu Koko. Similar to Magnezone, Alolan Golem is capable of trapping and dealing with the aforementioned troublesome Steel-types while also being able to provide Stealth Rock support.</p>"

      "Pivot (Fairy)": {
        "description": "<p>Tapu Koko is the fastest Fairy-type available and is a great offensive pivot. Thunderbolt is Tapu Koko's most consistent special STAB attack and has a high damage output thanks to boosts from Electric Terrain and Magnet. Hidden Power Ice lets Tapu Koko hit Ground-types that would otherwise be problematic for Fairy teams, such as Landorus and Gliscor. U-turn gives Tapu Koko a way to pivot other teammates in reliably and generate momentum. Taunt is great utility to help Tapu Koko shut down walls such as Zapdos and Blissey, making it easier to bring in a teammate that handles them effectively. Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment allows Tapu Koko to hit as hard and pivot as fast as possible, and 4 Defense EVs let it survive an Earthquake from defensive Gliscor at full health.</p> <p>Tapu Koko's role as a pivot is appreciated by all of its teammates. Klefki provides a much-needed Poison-type immunity and can be brought in safely to reliably set dual screens and entry hazards that can wear down foes for Tapu Koko to clean up late-game. Tapu Lele makes for a great teammate because it's a powerful wallbreaker that can power through specially defensive walls Tapu Koko struggles with, such as Swampert, with its STAB attacks. Tapu Bulu takes on most Ground-types that Tapu Koko struggles with, such as Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Swampert. Azumarill provides valuable priority in Aqua Jet and is also a very strong setup sweeper with Belly Drum while being able to take on all of the Ground-types that Tapu Koko struggles with. Mega Diancie is another good teammate because it can keep entry hazards off of your side that would otherwise wear Tapu Koko down, and it synergizes well with Tapu Koko in the Flying and Fire matchups. Mimikyu is able to break through the Psychic and Ghost teams, and Togekiss helps break through bulky threatening Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Beast Boost, amazing physical bulk, and a wide range of coverage options make Buzzwole a potent revenge killer for Bug teams. Close Combat deals with threats to Bug teams such as Heatran, Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar, Mega Lopunny, Terrakion, and Kyurem. Stone Edge is primarily used to nail threatening Flying- and Fire-types in the form of Mantine, Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Cinderace. Ice Punch helps against Ground- and Dragon-types like Landorus, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Dragonite. Leech Life is a secondary STAB option that aids greatly against threatening Psychic-types such as Celebi while also providing a form of passive recovery. Earthquake can be used instead of Leech Life for further coverage against Rock-, Steel-, and Poison-types like Mega Diancie, Aegislash, and Gengar and can force Toxapex out, especially specially defensive variants.</p> <p>Buzzwole synergizes well with Volcarona. Buzzwole takes care of Volcarona's checks like Blissey and Tyranitar, while Volcarona in return deals with physically defensive walls like Celesteela and Mega Sableye. They also form a great core against Steel as Buzzwole deals with Heatran, allowing Volcarona to sweep through the rest of the team. Mega Scizor and Scizor pair up well with Buzzwole because they deal with faster threats like Choice Scarf Nihilego and Galarian Darmanitan with Bullet Punch. Particularly, Mega Scizor is able to break through certain physical walls such as Mega Venusaur and Clefable, while Choice Band Scizor can Pursuit trap faster threats to Buzzwole like Choice Scarf Latios and Latias. Armaldo and Forretress provide reliable entry hazard control for Buzzwole while also setting up their own Stealth Rock and provide a neutrality against Flying-type attacks. Armaldo also takes neutral damage from Fire-type attacks and has Knock Off, while Forretress provides Spikes support and can safely bring Buzzwole into the field thanks to Volt Switch. Galvantula is able to provide Sticky Web support, allowing Buzzwole to outspeed threats it otherwise wouldn't like Zeraora and Choice Scarf Blacephalon. Galvantula also helps greatly against Water and Flying. Swords Dance Mega Pinsir acts as a reliable wallbreaker, weakening walls like Hippowdon and Mandibuzz for Buzzwole to clean up late-game. Araquanid reliably switches into Fire-type Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y, Blacephalon, and Volcarona and is able to set Sticky Web as well. Scolipede pairs well with Buzzwole because it aids greatly in matchups like Fairy and Psychic. Shuckle can be used as a reliable setter of Sticky Web and Stealth Rock on more offensive teams thanks to Sturdy.</p>"

Metronome is an option on the offensive set that increases Celesteela's effectiveness against passive walls like Toxapex and Mantine, at the cost of better sweep potential overall.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Steel</h4> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Offensive Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Blacephalon, and Victini have the potential to severely damage or OHKO even defensive Celesteela. Heatran deserves a special mention, as it does not fear Toxic or any offensive moves and can even trap Celesteela with Magma Storm or prevent it from using Leech Seed with Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Regieleki and Zeraora can do severe damage to Celesteela even when crippled by Leech Seed and, bar Tapu Koko, don't fear Heavy Slam. Pokemon such as Thundurus-T and Alolan Raichu can set up on a predicted Protect, while Magnezone can even trap and remove Celesteela.</p> <p><strong>Toxic-immune Walls</strong>: Since Celesteela relies on Toxic to beat other walls one-on-one, certain walls such as Toxapex, Mega Sableye, and Mega Venusaur can freely switch into Celesteela, although Mega Venusaur should be wary of Air Slash and Autotomize sets. Other walls such as Ferrothorn can switch into Toxic but cannot check Flamethrower variants.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Substitute and Taunt users such as Zapdos and Kommo-o are difficult for defensive Celesteela to deal with, as it relies on its status moves. Kommo-o can also set up on non-Air Slash Celesteela, which can become very problematic.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Powerful wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Hydreigon, Choice Band Urshifu-S, and Nidoking can break through Celesteela even with Leech Seed recovery.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Celesteela is a vital defensive option for Steel-type teams because of its typing and bulk, which enables it to check most Ground-types and work as one of the few switch-ins to Fighting-types for the type. Heavy Slam is generally Celesteela's most damaging move, dealing hefty damage to frailer, non-resistant offensive Pokemon like Tapu Bulu and Mega Gallade while also preventing it from being shut down by Taunt. Leech Seed is Celesteela's primary form of recovery, and it also allows Celesteela to chip attackers that it switches into. Protect gives another free turn of Leech Seed and Leftovers recovery while also scouting Choice users such as Blacephalon and Dragonite. Toxic allows Celesteela to further wear down walls like Hippowdon and Porygon2 when paired with Leech Seed and Protect. Flamethrower is another option to threaten Steel-, Bug-,and Grass-type switch-ins such as Aegislash, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn. A Relaxed nature is used with Flamethrower so Celesteela's Special Attack is not lowered. Beast Boost provides Celesteela with Defense boosts, which can be useful for absorbing hits from physical attackers such as Mega Gallade.</p> <p>Every Pokemon on Steel teams appreciates Celesteela's ability to switch into threatening Ground- and Fighting-types suchu as Excadrill. Celesteela is forced out by offensive Fire-types, so Heatran makes for a great partner that can threaten them with Earth Power or Toxic. In return, Celesteela covers its Ground- and Fighting-type weaknesses. Celesteela also struggles against Electric-types like Tapu Koko, so Excadrill and Ferrothorn are good switch-ins to these Pokemon. Excadrill can also offensively check Fire-types, while Ferrothorn can help wear down the opposition with Spikes. If Celesteela is the sole Fighting-type check, it can get worn down very easily, so other switch-ins such as Aegislash and Mega Scizor are valuable partners. Mega Scizor also provides an additional check to Ground-types, alleviating pressure from Celesteela. If Celesteela is running Toxic, Magnezone is another good partner to trap and remove Steel-types like the aforementioned Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, preventing them from taking advantage of Celesteela.</p>"

Air Slash can severely hurt Fighting-types such as Urshifu-R and has a useful flinch chance. Flyinium Z mitigates Air Slash's low damage and lets it OHKO Flying-weak Pokemon such as Keldeo and Zarude, as well as weakened walls such as Mandibuzz and Toxapex, to start snowballing with Beast Boost. Flamethrower threatens Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, Magnezone, and Aegislash. Giga Drain targets popular Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types such as Rotom-Wash, Swampert, and Mega Diancie. The passive recovery can also be useful when facing bulky Pokemon such as defensive Tyranitar and Hippowdon. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature lets Celesteela outspeed non-Choice Scarf Magnezone and Primarina before Autotomize and Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan and Choice Scarf Victini after Autotomize. Maximum Special Attacks EVs ensure Celesteela will gain Special Attack boosts from Beast Boost.</p> <p>Autotomize Celesteela is a better fit for offensive Steel teams rather than balanced ones, as it cannot reliably switch into offensive threats. Heatran is still the best partner for Celesteela, as it can deal with Fire-types such as Choice Scarf Blacephalon and Heatran. Offensive Heatran is particularly better because it can weaken and dispose of Toxapex and Zapdos thanks to Magma Storm and Taunt. Strong physical wallbreakers like Mega Scizor, Bisharp, Aegislash, and Excadrill can deal with special walls such as Blissey and Mantine; in return, Celesteela deals with physical walls like Skarmory. Choice Scarf Excadrill also revenge kills Electric- and Fire-types like Tapu Koko and Infernape, while Aegislash serves as a situational switch-in to Fighting-type attacks. Klefki provides dual screens and Spikes to make it easier for Celesteela to set up with Autotomize and sweep. Skarmory can provide Stealth Rock and Spikes to assist Celesteela.

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Fire</h4> <p>On the Offensive Pivot set, Court Change can replace High Jump Kick or Gunk Shot as a way to get rid of entry hazards for Fire teams, notably Stealth Rock, while taking advantage of opposing field effects such as Reflect or Light Screen. However, stripping away coverage defeats the purpose of the set, which is to immediately threaten types like Fairy, Psychic, and Dark with its moves. Fire teams also already have entry hazard removal in Torkoal and dual screens Rotom-H, making it unneeded most of the time. Electro Ball can be a very powerful niche move , OHKOing Pelipper and surprising Slowbro and Toxapex on the switch, but it doesn't do much outside of this. Choice Scarf allows Cinderace to act as a great revenge killer, outspeeding other Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion, Galarian Darmanitan, and Tapu Lele as well as the likes of Cloyster after a Shell Smash boost, Mega Swampert under rain, Tapu Koko, and Mega Aerodactyl. However, Cinderace suffers from being locked into one move, as its true power comes from its Libero-enhanced versatility.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Fire</h4> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Slowbro, Swampert, and Toxapex can comfortably take most hits Cinderace throws at them and retaliate with their Water-type attacks, eventually taking Cinderace out. However, Bulk Up Cinderace can break through Swampert with a few boosts, and Toxapex must be wary of Shattered Psyche.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physically bulky Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Staraptor, and Galarian Corsola are all very capable of taking on Cinderace and threatening it back with status or attacks.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Cinderace's measly defenses allow any super effective moves from Pokemon like Hippowdon, Azumarill, Landorus-T, and Terrakion to easily OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types like Garchomp, Dragonite, and Mega Latias can easily stomach most of Cinderace's moves and, in return, they can heavily damage it back due to Cinderace's frailty. However, certain ones like Latios, Mega Altaria, and Kyurem must be wary of. super effective coverage.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Fast, hard-hitting Pokemon that can survive a Sucker Punch such as Tapu Koko, Tornadus-T, Weavile, and Greninja threaten Cinderace and its teammates.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Paralysis and burn ~once Libero changes its type from Fire~ cripple Cinderace's offensive potential. Also, Toxic puts its on a timer.</p>",

      "Bulk Up (Fire)": {
        "description": "<p>Bulk Up Cinderace's great Speed tier and excellent Libero-boosted coverage moves allow it to threaten a myriad of types like Steel, Dark, and Normal. Its powerful STAB moves can be used to force switches, which can be utilized as a chance for Cinderace to Bulk Up to become even more threatening. Pyro Ball is Cinderace's most reliable move, nailing Steel- and Grass-types like Aegislash and Ferrothorn, and neutral targets such as Clefable while avoiding Rocky Helmet, Baneful Bunker, and King's Shield due to its lack of contact. High Jump Kick complements Pyro Ball's coverage, allowing Cinderace to hit certain Dark-, Steel-, and Normal-types hard, such as Tyranitar, Heatran, and Porygon2. Sucker Punch provides counterplay against frailer Pokemon that outspeed Cinderace, such as Choice Scarf Latios, Barraskewda, Choice Scarf Blacephalon, Alolan Raichu under Electric Terrain, and weakened Mega Aerodactyl. However, Zen Headbutt is an alternative alongside Psychium Z to let Cinderace lure in and OHKO threats to Fire teams such as Toxapex, Mega Diancie, Urshifu-R, and Keldeo with Shattered Psyche. Bulk Up Cinderace should be used as either a mid-game wallbreaker or as a sweeper, utilizing its great coverage moves boosted by Libero in order to break through teams.</p> <p>Mega Charizard X and Volcarona are both very potent setup sweepers that benefit from Cinderace getting rid of walls such as Toxapex and Tyranitar. In particular, boosted Mega Charizard X also defeats Dragon-types that threaten Cinderace like Garchomp and Mega Latias. Rotom-H is a great teammate to Cinderace, as it can set dual screens to help Cinderace set up while safely bringing it in with Volt Switch, or it can work as a Nasty Plot wallbreaker that can beat defensive Water- and Flying-types like Toxapex and Moltres for Cinderace. It also switches into Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Regieleki, but it needs to rely on Pain Split to keep itself healthy. Mega Charizard Y breaks through the physically defensive walls that can give Cinderace trouble such as Galarian Corsola and Slowbro. In return, Cinderace beats the special walls that Mega Charizard Y struggles against such as Blissey and Heatran. Blacephalon can soften up bulky Pokemon like Hippowdon and Gastrodon with its Choice Specs set or sweep late-game while wielding a Choice Scarf. Stallbreaker Heatran can trap and remove walls like Toxapex and Zapdos with Magma Storm, as well as checking offensive Rock-types like Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Nihilego by virtue of its Steel typing. Torkoal is able to set up Stealth Rock for Cinderace and provide sun support via Drought, enabling Cinderace's Pyro Ball to hit even harder. Choice Scarf Infernape is a very useful revenge killer that can dispose of threats that outspeed and OHKO Cinderace, such as the aforementioned Choice Scarf Nihilego and Greninja, while Choice Band Infernape is able to weaken bulky Pokemon like Rotom-W and Gliscor, relieving the pressure on Cinderace and allowing it to set up easier. If Cinderace is using Heavy-Duty Boots, Z-Celebrate Victini is a great teammate that takes advantage of Cinderace checking common checks to it such as defensive Heatran and Chansey. Conversely, Victini can heavily damage Pokemon Cinderace has trouble hitting effectively, such as Toxapex, Mega Venusaur, Mantine, and Tapu Fini.</p>"

      "Offensive Pivot (Fire)": {
        "description": "<p>Cinderace's great Speed tier, generous movepool, and great ability in Libero allow for an effective pivot set that can immediately threaten teams vulnerable to its coverage. Pyro Ball hits most foes decently while avoiding contact-based side effects. U-turn allows Cinderace to pivot out of the various defensive switches it forces while generating momentum and dealing solid damage. High Jump Kick targets the bulky Normal-, Rock-, and Dark-types that shrug off Pyro Ball such as Porygon2, Rhyperior, and Tyranitar. Alongside Pyro Ball, it creates a fearsome combination that hits all Steel-types in the metagame super effectively, making Cinderace a great tool in the Steel matchup. Gunk Shot can be run instead, hitting pesky Fairy-types and certain Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Azumarill, Tapu Fini, Araquanid, and Mantine. Sucker Punch allows Cinderace to revenge kill faster weakened threats like Zeraora, Barraskewda, and Choice Scarf Latias. Maximum Speed EVs let Cinderace outspeed and beat threats like Gengar, Tapu Lele, and Hydreigon.</p> <p>This Cinderace set is an all-out attacker rather than a reliable sweeper or wallbreaker, so it's best paired with Pokemon that capitalize on the offensive pressure it generates. Torkoal is a great partner to Cinderace, providing sun support and laying down Stealth Rock so Cinderace can net more KOs. Choice Band Victini and Infernape are fellow pivots capable of wearing down physically defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Hippowdon, and Mega Venusaur so Cinderace has an easier time versus them. Similarly, Mega Charizard Y breaks down some of the physical walls that annoy Cinderace like Mega Slowbro and Swampert while also setting sun for it. In return, it appreciates Cinderace breaking common special walls, like Blissey and Heatran, and forcing out some of its offensive checks like Mega Diancie. Sweepers like Mega Charizard X and Z-move Volcarona also appreciate Cinderace beating the likes of Azumarill ~if running Gunk Shot, Tyranitar, and Heatran so they have an easier time cleaning against Fairy, Dark, and Steel teams, respectively. They also benefit from Cinderace's U-turn getting them safely into the field. Volcanion is another hard hitter that synergizes well with Cinderace because of its Water immunity, dealing with Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Seismitoad while additionally KOing Pokemon such as Toxapex and Hippowdon.</p>"
