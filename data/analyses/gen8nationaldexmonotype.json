        "description": "<p>Mega Venusaur acts as a wall for Grass teams, checking threats such as Nidoking and Mega Diancie. Thick Fat crucially helps Mega Venusaur take attacks from Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Victini and Mamoswine. Sludge Bomb is Mega Venusaur's main attack and nails Grass- and Fairy-types like Rillaboom and Alolan Ninetales while doing neutral damage to threats such as Dragonite. Sludge Bomb can also be used to fish for poison against foes such as Mega Sableye, Landorus-T, and Zapdos, making them easier to wear down. Giga Drain allows it to take on threats such as Mamoswine while also gaining back health. Leech Seed can be used over Giga Drain, notably allowing setup sweepers such as Celebi and Decidueye to set up more easily. Hidden Power Fire provides meaningful damage against Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Bisharp. Synthesis allows Mega Venusaur to stay healthy throughout the match; it should continually use Synthesis to stay at full health so it can constantly switch into different attackers, such as Mega Lopunny and Mimikyu. 16 Speed EVs let Mega Venusaur outspeed Adamant Azumarill.</p> <p>All of Mega Venusaur's teammates appreciate its ability to take on so many threats, such as Mega Diancie, Mega Scizor, and Buzzwole, while also clearing the field of Toxic Spikes. Additionally, Leech Seed on top of the type's natural ability to hazard stack wears down foes quickly. Ferrothorn forms the defensive core of the team with Mega Venusaur, switching into Psychic-type attacks, setting hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes, and taking on threats such as Weavile with Gyro Ball. Mega Venusaur can take Fighting-type attacks for Ferrothorn such as Terrakion's Close Combat. Whimsicott can take on Dragon-type Pokemon such as Kyurem, Hydreigon, and Kommo-o with Moonblast for Mega Venusaur, notably switching into Dragonite's Outrage. It can also cripple various threats such as Blissey, Porygon2, and Choice Band Victini by removing their items. All of Mega Venusaur's offensive teammates such as Breloom, Celebi, Rillaboom, Tapu Bulu, and Zarude appreciate its ability to wear down foes such as Mandibuzz, allowing them to better clean late-game. Breloom can take on Dark- and Steel-type Pokemon for Mega Venusaur such as Hydreigon, Heatran, and Excadrill with Swords Dance + Mach Punch and take on Flying-types such as Celesteela with Continental Crush. Celebi can take on Poison- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Nidoking, Toxapex, and Kommo-o as well as threats such as Heatran with Earth Power. Celebi can also opt to run Hidden Power Fire alongside Earth Power to handle Steel teams better. Rillaboom generally threatens offensive Pokemon such as Mega Gallade, Landorus, and Nihilego with Grassy Glide in Grassy Terrain. Tapu Bulu can also summon Grassy Terrain and takes on Steel- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Bisharp, and Zapdos with Close Combat and Stone Edge. Rillaboom and Tapu Bulu's Grassy Terrain helps Venusaur stay healthy and take Earthquakes from Pokemon like Excadrill more easily. Zarude can handle Psychic-type Pokemon such as Alakazam and Tapu Lele and pivot into status conditions due to Jungle Healing, preventing Mega Venusaur from being worn down.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Mega Venusaur is a great defensive Pokemon for Poison teams thanks to its decent movepool, recovery in two reliable forms, and amazing defensive typing, which allow it to threaten Water-types like Mega Swampert and Keldeo and come in on Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Magnezone. Its great bulk allows it to also take on physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny and Excadrill. Giga Drain hits Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types like Hippowdon, Gastrodon, Azumarill, Terrakion, and Mega Diancie. Sludge Bomb is Mega Venusaur's strongest STAB option that greatly dents Fairy-and Grass-types like Tapu Koko, Tapu Bulu, and Rillaboom. It is also useful for its 30% poison chance against specially defensive walls like Mega Sableye, Mantine, and Zapdos. Mega Venusaur can use Leech Seed over Sludge Bomb to give it and its teammates passive recovery. Hidden Power Fire makes does good damage to Excadrill and prevents Mega Venusaur from being fodder for Mega Scizor's setup and Ferrothorn's entry hazards. Synthesis keeps Mega Venusaur healthy throughout the match. Venusaur gains Thick Fat upon Mega Evolution, which halves damage taken from Fire- and Ice-type attacks from Blacephalon, Greninja, and Alolan Ninetales, and it also prevents a 2HKOfrom Choice Scarf Victini 's V-create. 16 Speed EVs are used to outpace Adamant Azumarill. The remaining EVs maximize Mega Venusaur's physical bulk so it can tank physical attacks from Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Mega Lopunny, and Excadrill.</p> <p>Toxapex forms a great defensive core with Mega Venusaur, providing Haze to check setup sweepers that exploit Mega Venusaur such as Dragonite, Aegislash, Volcarona, and Mega Scizor. It switches into Mega Charizard Y and pressures the opposition with Toxic Spikes and Scald as well. Mega Venusaur in return can check Electric-types like Zeraora and Tapu Koko and switch into Ground-type attacks from Gastrodon and Hippowdon. Nihilego can set Stealth Rock and take care of Fire- and Flying-types like Mega Charizard Y, Tornadus-T, and Zapdos. Nidoking can also provide Stealth Rock support while also being a great wallbreaker that can 2HKO Mega Sableye using Earth Power, and break through Heatran + Celesteela. Nidoking can also beat Flying-types such as Zapdos and Gliscor, and in return, Mega Venusaur can switch into Ice- and Water-types like Weavile and Urshifu-R. Levitate Galarian Weezing gives the team immunity to Dragon and Ground as well as support in Will-O-Wisp and Defog. Drapion can set Toxic Spikes and switch into Psychic-type attacks from Tapu Lele, Latias, and Latios and Pursuit trap them. Alolan Muk is another Dark-type option that can use Curse, Rest, and Knock Off to take care of Psychic-types. Both Dark-types switch into Ghost-type attacks from Pokemon such as Gengar as well. Galarian Slowking can help against special attackers such as Kyurem and switch in on Psychic-types like Tapu Lele, Latios, and Alolan Raichu.</p> "

It can outspeed Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Hydreigon after one Dragon Dance and Mega Charizard X can outpace Sand Rush Excadrill in sand and Regieleki after two. Outrage can be used to hit other Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Kyurem and Fire-resistant foes like Slowbro and Swampert; however, being locked into it and confused can be taken advantage of by Pokemon such as Azumarill. Dragon Claw is Mega Charizard X's more reliable but less powerful Dragon-type STAB move. Roost can be used to give Mega Charizard X longevity throughout the game and heal off Flare Blitz recoil, whereas Earthquake hits Heatran, Tyranitar, and Toxapex. 252 EVs in Speed alongside a Jolly nature allow Mega Charizard X to outspeed common threats like Excadrill and Hydreigon.</p> <p>Torkoal can set up Stealth Rock and remove entry hazards from Mega Charizard X's side thanks to Rapid Spin while fueling its Flare Blitz by setting up sun. Rotom-H can set up Light Screen and Reflect so Mega Charizard X can set up safely. Rotom-H can also remove Stealth Rock with Defog and bring Mega Charizard X in safely with Volt Switch. Cinderace as a teammate can wallbreak through diverse walls Mega Charizard X struggles against, such as Tyranitar and Toxapex, by virtue of its coverage moves in High Jump Kick and Zen Headbutt. Blacephalon can help Mega Charizard X by breaking through physical walls such as Hippowdon and Porygon2 with its Choice Specs set. Infernape's Fighting typing allows it to threaten the likes of Tyranitar, Heatran, and Porygon2, with the former two being hard for Mega Charizard X to beat without Earthquake. Choice Scarf Infernape and Choice Scarf Blacephalon can be used against huge threats like Choice Scarf Nihilego. Volcanion can be used to check Rock- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Rhyperior, and Water Absorb lets it beat Tapu Fini and Azumarill with Sludge Wave. Volcarona can form a sweeping core with Mega Charizard X by removing some of its checks like Mega Slowbro and Gastrodon.

It also has a decent movepool consisting of moves like Solar Beam and Focus Blast, which lets it take on some of the Pokemon that can take Fire-type attacks. Mega Charizard Y's presence on Flying-type teams also improves the matchups against types like Steel, Ice, and Ground. Fire Blast hits super hard thanks to the boost from Drought and deals with pesky Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Skarmory. Solar Beam deals with Water- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Swampert, and Hippowdon. Focus Blast helps Mega Charizard Y beat problematic Pokemon for it like Heatran and Tyranitar that can reliably stomach other moves . Roost allows it to keep itself healthy and threaten balance cores more such as those of Water and Psychic teams. Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Mega Charizard Y to hit as hard as possible and outspeed Pokemon like Choice Specs Tapu Lele and Speed tie with other base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Mew and Galarian Zapdos. Blaze is the preferred ability before Mega Evolving so Charizard does not take any unnecessary damage from opposing sun. Charizardite Y is used as an item to Mega Evolve Charizard.</p> <p>Defoggers like Mantine, Skarmory, Mandibuzz, and Zapdos can reliably clear Stealth Rock for Mega Charizard Y while also providing it with other utility support. Mantine also covers Water-type attacks for it from Pokemon like Urshifu-R and Barraskewda. Since Mega Charizard Y struggles to get past dedicated special walls like Toxapex, Blissey, and Araquanid, teammates like Landorus-T and Dragonite are good, as they can break apart such Pokemon. Landorus-T also provides Mega Charizard Y with an immunity from Electric-type attacks and wallbreak with its Swords Dance set or check threats like Tapu Koko with its Choice Scarf set. Dragonite, on the other hand, loves Mega Charizard Y dealing with Steel-type Pokemon for it; in return, it can muscle past Pokemon like Alolan Muk and Toxapex with its Choice Band set and revenge kill faster threats like Alolan Raichu with Extreme Speed. As Mega Charizard Y is threatened by faster Pokemon such as Nihilego, Terrakion, and Garchomp, teammates like Corviknight, Celesteela, and Skarmory help to have, and they provide a Rock-type neutrality. They all also provide various utility support like Defog, Toxic + Leech Seed, and Stealth Rock to keep Mega Charizard Y safer and to help wear down teams. Other special attackers such as Landorus, Tornadus-T, and Thundurus-T are also decent teammates, as they all can weaken shared checks like Blissey, Heatran, Toxapex, and Tyranitar. Focus Sash Aerodactyl is a good teammate on hyper offensive Flying-type teams to provide it with Stealth Rock and Tailwind support. Gliscor can help stallbreak defensive Pokemon like Blissey and Toxapex for Mega Charizard Y while also providing it with an Electric-type immunity and taking on Pokemon like Zeraora.</p> "

Rising Voltage's power is significantly boosted under Electric Terrain, letting Alolan Raichu break past foes that don't resist it or are not specially bulky and be an effective sweeper as well. Psychic is useful for hitting notable Fighting- and Poison-type threats to Electric teams such as Kommo-o, Mega Venusaur, and Nidoking. Grass Knot provides important coverage for Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Gastrodon, Swampert, and Seismitoad. Nasty Plot is an option over Grass Knot if a teammate like Rotom-C already has Grass-type coverage, allowing Alolan Raichu to set up on foes it can force out like Pelipper, Toxapex, and Celesteela, making it a sufficient wallbreaker as well. Focus Blast can KO many important targets including Hydreigon, Excadrill, Tyranitar, Diggersby, and Ferrothorn after chip damage. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Alolan Raichu to outspeed Keldeo, Alolan Ninetales, and Landorus outside of Electric Terrain. A Modest nature can be used instead to increase damage output while still being very fast under Electric Terrain.

Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan is a great wallbreaker and a great way to take care of troubling Steel-types like Excadrill, Heatran, and Jirachi that threaten Alolan Ninetales out. Choice Scarf Weavile is a great check to a set-up Cloyster thanks to Foul Play and troublesome Ghost- and Psychic-types like Gengar, Blacephalon, Victini and Jirachi thanks to Knock Off and Pursuit. Knock Off is also useful to get rid of Heavy-Duty Boots from Blissey, Leftovers from Tyranitar, and Eviolite from Porygon2.</p> "

With Ditto in battle, Pokemon like Volcarona, Mega Altaria, and Kommo-o are pressured from setting up because it can steal stat boosts to countersweep, and Imposter means Sticky Web has no effect on it. Ditto can also exploit support Pokemon like Zapdos and Blissey to recover with Roost or Soft-Boiled and entry hazard removers like Pelipper and Coalossal to clear hazards. It can also safely switch into Mega Sableye's Knock Off to trade Speed for move freedom, and it ignores defensive Celesteela's Toxic. However, Ditto's 5 PP per move and Choice lock give it a hard time beating defensive sweepers like CurseRest Mega Steelix and Calm Mind Mega Slowbro. Choice Scarf is required for Ditto to revenge kill setup sweepers like Swords Dance Excadrill and Mega Lopunny and Speed tie with opposing Choice Scarf Pokemon like Nihilego and Landorus-T. Ditto cannot copy HP, so investing 252 EVs into HP helps it a lot, and 0 Speed IVs and a Relaxed nature allow it to not transform and lose PP against mirrored Ditto. The mentioned IV spread allows it to have HP Fire to trap and KO Magnezone.</p> <p>Defensive Pokemon like Staraptor, Blissey, and Porygon2 appreciate Ditto because it can revenge kill setup Pokemon like Dragon Dance Altaria and Bulk Up Cinderace that will try to break and setup on them. Ditto appreciates Pokemon with pivoting moves, like Teleport Blissey and Porygon2 and U-Turn Staraptor, to allow it to come in safely. Staraptor helps with Fighting-types with its part Flying typing and Intimidate, and it has Defog to clear entry hazards for when Ditto comes in. Ditto does not appreciate being statused in any form, so Blissey as a teammate can absorb status thanks to Natural Cure. Offensive Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, Diggersby, Heliolisk, and Indeedee-M are appreciated, as they can remove defensive Pokemon Ditto cannot revenge kill. Mega Lopunny's Close Combat helps with Pokemon like Tyranitar and Mamoswine, and its Encore to helps with defensive sweepers like the aforementioned Steelix and Calm Mind Mega Slowbro. Diggersby helps with Electric-, Rock-, and Steel-types like Zapdos, Coalossal, and Aegislash with Earthquake and can revenge kill faster Pokemon like Zeraora and Cinderace with Quick Attack. Indeedee-M helps with Fighting- and Poison-types like Keldeo and Toxapex with Expanding Force and prevents priority moves like Mach Punch from working thanks to Psychic Terrain. Heliolisk helps with Water- and Flying-types like Celesteela, Toxapex, and Mantine with Thunderbolt and has Dry Skin to offer Water immunity for the team.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Mega Aerodactyl's high Attack stat, stellar Speed stat, and good offensive typing make it a solid offensive Pokemon for Flying-type teams. Its great Speed also lets it outspeed and handle fast threats like Tapu Koko, Zeraora, and Weavile. Its access to Dragon Dance lets Mega Aerodactyl increase its already good Attack stat to even greater levels and outspeed extremely fast Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Greninja, Regieleki, and Excadrill in the sand, making it considerably harder to revenge kill. Stealth Rock can also be used over Dragon Dance for role compression, especially when Mega Aerodactyl's teammates are not carrying it. Its high Speed stat lets it set Stealth Rock quickly against types like Flying, Dragon, and Fire and threaten their entry hazard removers. Stone Edge hits much of the metagame for good damage right off the bat, especially with Rock's good coverage. When boosted by Dragon Dance, it scores 2HKOs on Pokemon such as Slowbro and Mega Venusaur after minor chip damage. Earthquake in tandem with Stone Edge improves Mega Aerodactyl's coverage and lets it hit Pokemon such as Aegislash and Toxapex reliably. It also takes care of Electric-type Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Magnezone, and Zeraora without relying on Stone Edge to hit. Tough Claws-boosted Ice Fang lets Mega Aerodactyl take care of bulky Ground- and Dragon-type Pokemon like Gliscor, Landorus, and Garchomp. Stone Edge + Ice Fang synergizes well in the Dragon matchup, as it can hit every viable Dragon-type for super effective damage. Pursuit, which is also boosted by Tough Claws, can be used over Ice Fang to handle threats to Flying-type teams such as Choice Band Victini, Mega Latias, and Latios.</p> <p>Mega Aerodactyl is vulnerable to Electric-type Pokemon like Alolan Raichu in Electric Terrain and Regieleki, so teammates like Gliscor and Landorus can cover that weakness. Gliscor can provide stallbreaking support to wear down walls and absorb status for Mega Aerodactyl, while Landorus is a formidable wallbreaker to beat physical walls like Toxapex, Porygon2, Galarian Corsola, and Hippowdon. Additionally, both can also utilize Stealth Rock so Mega Aerodactyl can use Dragon Dance to be more threatening. Ice- and Rock-type Pokemon like Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, Weavile, Nihilego, and Terrakion also threaten Mega Aerodactyl, so teammates like Corviknight, Celesteela, and Skarmory can handle them; in return, Mega Aerodactyl can deal with problematic Fire-type Pokemon like Victini and Mega Charizard Y. Corviknight can act as a great wincon with its Bulk Up set after Mega Aerodactyl has weakened the team, while Skarmory can also take on physical threats like Mega Scizor, Mega Sharpedo, and Excadrill. They both also provide Defog support to help with Mega Aerodactyl's Stealth Rock weakness. Celesteela, on the other hand, can take care of Steel-type Pokemon with Flamethrower or wear down teams for Mega Aerodactyl with Toxic + Leech Seed support and check Mega Diancie. Special attackers such as Thundurus-T and Tornadus-T can take care of Water-type Pokemon such as Swampert, Toxapex, and Urshifu-R that are problematic for Mega Aerodactyl. Mantine and Mandibuzz are also decent teammates to take on Water- and Ghost-type threats like Kingdra and Aegislash; the former provides Mega Aerodactyl with an important Water-type immunity while the latter provides pivoting with U-turn and Knock Off support. A wallbreaker like Dragonite can weaken shared checks like Toxapex for Mega Aerodactyl and appreciates Stealth Rock support for a late-game sweep.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Despite facing competition from Galarian Weezing as a Defog user, Crobat's amazing Speed tier, access to U-turn and Taunt, and ability to better deal with threats like Mega Gallade and Choice Scarf Excadrill make it a great utility Pokemon for Poison teams. Brave Bird deals with major threats to Poison teams in the form of Mega Gallade and Mega Pinsir. Defog allows Crobat to remove entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes for its teammates, while Roost serves as reliable recovery, providing longevity for Crobat throughout the game. Taunt allows Crobat to pressure walls like Blissey and Hippowdon by blocking recovery while also preventing utility Pokemon such as Swampert and Klefki from setting up hazards and using all sorts of status moves. Taunt also ensures Toxapex's Toxic Spikes stays up against opposing Defog users like Staraptor. U-turn can be opted over Taunt, improving Crobat as a fast pivot instead. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Crobat from taking Stealth Rock damage upon entry. 192 Speed EVs along with a Jolly nature allow Crobat to outspeed key threats like Greninja, Tornadus, and Alakazam, while 48 Attack EVs ensure that it OHKOes Mega Gallade with 4 Defense EVs after Stealth Rock damage. 252 HP EVs and the remaining EVs going in Defense increase Crobat's bulk.</p> <p>All of Crobat's teammates appreciate Crobat's Ground immunity Defog. Toxapex provides a great defensive switch-in against a majority of attacks directed at Crobat, notably resisting Ice. Toxapex can also provide Haze and Toxic Spikes support. Mega Venusaur is a great teammate for Crobat, dealing with Electric-type attack and Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Rotom-W that threaten it. Mega Venusaur can also act as a reliable secondary Ground-type switch-in, and, together with Toxapex, is able to provide an extremely reliable defensive core that may switch into almost any attack directed at Crobat. Drapion and Alolan Muk act as the much needed sources of Psychic immunity, additionally being able to Pursuit trap and defeat threatening Psychic-types for Crobat, like Choice Scarf Latios and Tapu Lele. They can also aid greatly in the Ghost-type matchup by safely switching into and Pursuit trapping threats like Gengar and Blacephalon. Drapion can also provide Toxic Spikes support, while Alolan Muk can opt for a Curse set which is an extremely effective late-game sweeper. Nidoking is an excellent special wallbreaker that is able to beat the Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Heatran that wall Crobat while serving as the best source Electric immunity Poison has to offer. Nihilego is a great asset in the Flying matchup and is the best available Choice Scarf user for Poison-type teams. Lastly, Assault Vest Galarian Slowking reliably checks some key threats like Kyurem and Choice Specs Zapdos that otherwise pose a significant threat to Crobat and Poison teams more broadly.</p> "

Azumarill can also chose to run Brick Break in lieu of Play Rough, as it better deals with Steel-type Pokemon, namely Melmetal, which otherwise withstands any of Azumarill's attacks even after Belly Drum. Substitute may be used over Play Rough in order to let Azumarill set up on Pokemon that rely on status moves to deal with it, like Torkoal and Mega Sableye, but Play Rough is generally preferred due to it hitting useful targets. Return along with a Jolly nature can be used to better deal with Galarian Weezing and Mega Venusaur, significantly improving the Poison-type matchup.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Fairy</h1> <p><strong>Water-resistant Pokemon: Pokemon that resist Azumarill's Aqua Jet such as Latios and Serperior can withstand Aqua Jet even after Belly Drum and KO Azumarill with their STAB moves or super effective coverage options. Even many walls that resist Water, like Mega Venusaur, Celebi, and Rotom-W, can outspeed Azumarill and KO it with super effective STAB moves before Azumarill can use Knock Off or Play Rough.</p> <p><strong>Haze Users and Phazers: Mantine can outspeed Azumarill and remove its boosts with Haze, while Azumarill fails to reliably set up Belly Drum against Toxapex, as it removes the move's boosts with Haze and proceeds to easily deal with unboosted Azumarill.

Aqua Jet allows it to deal with faster threats like Volcarona and Mamoswine, making up for its subpar Speed stat. Knock Off hits Psychic- and Ghost-types like Jirachi and Aegislash for super effective damage, and it's able to OHKO Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Celesteela and bulky walls like Toxapex with minor or no chip damage after Belly Drum. Play Rough is a stronger STAB option that deals with Dragon- and Dark-types such as Kommo-o and Mandibuzz. Maximum Speed EVs make Azumarill as fast as possible, outspeeding threats such as Dragalge and Melmetal. Normalium Z is Azumarill's preferred item, as it nullifies chip damage taken prior to using Belly Drum while also preventing Azumarill from being crippled by Knock Off, as opposed to Sitrus Berry. The added perk of Normalium Z is that Azumarill can use Belly Drum without it to use Z-Belly Drum later, either recovering its HP back to full if it didn't switch out.</p> <p>Klefki pairs up exceptionally well with Azumarill. Klefki acts as a much needed Poison immunity and provides dual screens support and Spikes support, the former allowing Azumarill to set up more easily and the latter chipping down foes for it. Tapu Koko helps greatly in the Flying- and Water-type matchups, while Mega Diancie is able to bounce off entry hazards as well as status moves directed at Azumarill. Mega Diancie can also provide Stealth Rock support, which helps it further improve the Fire- and Flying-type matchups, and aid in matchups like Poison, Steel, and Electric thanks to a wide range of coverage options in Psychic, Mystical Fire, and Earth Power. Tapu Bulu is a great asset in the Water-, Electric- and Ground-type matchups. Tapu Lele is not only a great wallbreaker when equipped with a Choice Specs, but also a great help against Poison-types such as Mega Venusaur and Galarian Weezing that threaten Azumarill. Mimikyu helps greatly in the Ghost- and Psychic-type matchups, dealing with Pokemon like Aegislash and Tapu Lele. Lastly, Togekiss synergizes well with Azumarill, as it deals with Grass-types troublesome to Azumarill, like Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn, while Azumarill in return deals with Rock-type threats to Togekiss.</p> "

Heavy Slam nails Fairy-types like Tapu Bulu and Mega Diancie while dishing out large amounts of damage against neutral targets, allowing it to deal with most of the tier after a few boosts. Rest allows Mega Steelix to maintain longevity and cure any burns when against passive Pokemon such as Mandibuzz, Mega Sableye, and Klefki. Sleep Talk synergizes well with Rest, allowing it to potentially further set up with Curse or fire off a powerful Heavy Slam even when asleep, preventing foes from taking advantage of Rest. Due to its already sky-high Defense stat, maximum HP and Special Defense EVs are invested to increase Mega Steelix's special bulk, allowing it to better deal with special attackers like Latios and Alolan Ninetales. An Impish nature is used to ensure Mega Steelix survives a +6 Aqua Jet from Azumarill, KOing it back with Heavy Slam.</p> <p>Gastrodon and Seismitoad act as great teammates, as they both provide a much needed immunity to Water-type attacks and are able to deal with threats to Mega Steelix, such as Mega Slowbro and Mantine.

Mamoswine can deal with troublesome Ground-, Flying- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Landorus, Zapdos, and Garchomp while also providing a form of priority thanks to Ice Shard. Nidoking works well with Mega Steelix, as it can better address the threat posed by Steel- and Flying-types that deal with Mega Steelix, such as Ferrothorn and Celesteela, by virtue of its wide coverage boosted by Sheer Force. Excadrill provides a way to check faster foes such as Cinderace and also deals with offensive threats such as Heatran while providing secondary hazard control thanks to Rapid Spin; it is also able to act as reliable wallbreaker with Swords Dance. Garchomp can form a strong physical wallbreaker core in tandem with Mega Steelix, since Swords Dance lets it break past some of Mega Steelix's checks in Mantine and Toxapex. Gliscor can cripple both offensive and defensive Pokemon thanks to Knock Off and Taunt, which Mega Steelix appreciates greatly, while also removing troublesome Spikes with Defog.

Swords Dance allows Mega Scizor to boost its already great Attack stat to even greater heights, making it capable of threatening types like Fairy, Normal, and Dragon after a single boost. A STAB move in priority Bullet Punch, which is further boosted by its ability Technician, allows it to sweep teams easily once boosted. Additionally, it also lets Mega Scizor bypass its mediocre Speed stat and take care of faster Pokemon like Landorus, Tapu Koko, and Mega Medicham. Bug Bite lets Mega Scizor deal with Pokemon that resist Bullet Punch such as Rotom-W, Gastrodon, and Swampert. Dual Wingbeat is an option that allows Mega Scizor to score crucial rolls such as the 2HKO on Toxapex, OHKO on Mega Venusaur at +2, and OHKO on Keldeo and Urshifu-R while unboosted. Superpower when boosted lets Mega Scizor deal with some of its checks like Skarmory, Celesteela, and Porygon2. Knock Off can be used as well to remove items from defensive Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Galarian Corsola, which makes it easier for Mega Scizor to deal with them late-game. Knock Off also hits Aegislash hard, which otherwise takes little damage from its other moves. Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature allows Mega Scizor to hit as hard as possible, whereas maximum Speed investment lets it outspeed Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Rotom-W.

In return, Volcarona takes care of Steel-types such as Corviknight, Celesteela, and Skarmory that are hard for Mega Scizor to get past. It can also specifically beat Zapdos, which otherwise checks Mega Scizor comfortably. Araquanid can sponge Fire-type attacks aimed at Mega Scizor from Pokemon such as Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona while also providing Sticky Web support so that Mega Scizor can outspeed more threats. Buzzwole and Heracross with a Choice Scarf and Stone Edge can take on threats like Choice Band Victini and Mega Charizard Y for the team, and they also appreciate Mega Scizor breaking down walls like Hippowdon when boosted by Swords Dance and make cleaning late-game much easier for the aforementioned revenge killers. Galvantula does well against Water- and Flying-type teams that are usually a trouble for Mega Scizor; it can provide Sticky Web support, too. Forretress can provide entry hazard support in the form of Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes while also providing hazard removal in the form of Rapid Spin and Volt Switch support to bring Mega Scizor safely into the battle. Guts Heracross as a teammate can soften walls like Mandibuzz and Toxapex for an easier Mega Scizor sweep while absorbing troublesome burns for it.</p> "

Stealth Rock helps wear down foes upon switch in, most notably breaking Focus Sash and Sturdy from Pokemon such as Cloyster and Skarmory. Encore prevents setup sweepers such as Mega Gallade, Azumarill, and Volcarona from using Shuckle as setup bait.

Knock Off helps get rid of items such as Heavy-Duty Boots, Eviolite, and Choice Scarf from Pokemon like Blissey, Porygon2, and Landorus-T. Removing Heavy-Duty Boots also further improves the effectiveness of the hazards Shuckle sets. Final Gambit can be opted for over Encore, as it provides great momentum gain after hazards are set up. Mental Herb allows Shuckle to ignore Taunt from Pokemon such as Aerodactyl, Cobalion, and Tapu Fini for a single turn allowing it to reliably set up at least one entry hazard. 248 HP EVs and 252 Defense EVs along with an Impish nature maximizes Shuckle's physical bulk and minimizes damage taken by Stealth Rock.

Tyranitar can provide sand support, bolstering Shuckle's already high Special Defense stat, allowing it to take special hits better, while also improving the Psychic and Ghost matchups greatly due to its STAB-boosted Crunch and Pursuit. Alolan Golem pairs well with Shuckle thanks to an amazing ability in Magnet Pull, allowing it to deal with threats such as Mega Scizor, which it even outspeeds after Sticky Web.

        "description": "<p>Porygon2 is the premier physically defensive wall available for Normal teams due to its combination of stellar bulk, reliable recovery, and a movepool that's able to keep important threats in check. Recover is Porygon2's go-to move, allowing it to stay healthy and provide its utility throughout the match. Ice Beam works as Porygon2's main attack, keeping key Ice-weak targets like Dragonite, Gliscor, and Landorus-T at bay. Discharge has a decent chance to cripple the opposition with paralysis while dealing good damage to Pokemon such as Pelipper, Celesteela, and Gyarados. It also forms the BoltBeam coverage alongside Ice Beam, which is capable of heavily denting Flying teams. Hidden Power Fire rounds off the set, enabling Porygon2 to nail Steel-types that take little from its other moves like Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Mega Steelix. Alternatively, Teleport allows Porygon2 to work as a defensive pivot, generating momentum for the team at the cost of further coverage. Download is the preferred ability for Porygon2, reducing its overall passiveness and further threatening Flying-, Water-, Dragon-, and Steel-type teams should it get a Special Attack boost. However, one can opt for Trace to copy and take advantage of defensive abilities like Toxapex's Regenerator, Dragonite's Multiscale, and Landorus-T's Intimidate. Max HP and Defense investments in tandem with a Bold nature and Eviolite bolster Porygon2's physical bulk, permitting it to shrug assaults from the likes of Mega Sharpedo and Choice Band Excadrill. Eviolite in particular also lets Porygon2 take special attacks from Pokemon like Nidoking and Hydreigon with relative ease, despite the lack of EVs in Special Defense.</p> <p>Together, Blissey and Porygon2 form a stellar defensive core for Normal teams that can stop most attackers in their tracks. Blissey can comfortably stomach attacks from special wallbreakers like Landorus and Mega Charizard Y that easily bypass Porygon2 and absorb status aliments for it by virtue of Natural Cure. In return, Porygon2 takes on powerful physical attackers like Dragonite and Mega Sharpedo for Blissey, and the pair can form an extremely effective pivoting backbone should Porygon2 be running Teleport. Ditto is an excellent teammate as well, as it can easily revenge kill sweepers that may use Porygon2 as setup fodder such as Swords Dance Excadrill and Z-Belly Drum Azumarill. It also switches into walls that beat Porygon2 one-on-one like Mega Sableye and Blissey by copying themselves and, thus, their status move immunities. Wallbreakers like Mega Lopunny and Diggersby greatly appreciate Porygon2's bulk to shrug off priority moves and its Teleport for them to come into the field safely. In return, they can beat threats to Porygon2 like Heatran, Mega Sableye, and Tyranitar. Mega Lopunny can also absorb Knock Offs for Porygon2. Defog users like defensive Staraptor and Mega Pidgeot remove entry hazards, allowing Porygon2 to better perform its walling and support duties by coming into the field unscathed. The former also takes hits from dangerous Fighting-types like Infernape and Heracross for Porygon2 and brings it safely into the field with U-turn, while the latter revenge kills Fighting-types and threatens Steel-types like Bisharp and Ferrothorn. Lastly, Porygon-Z's wide array of possible coverage moves allows it to threaten Psychic-types and certain Steel-types Porygon2 struggles dealing with.</p> "

Teleport turns Blissey into an incredibly good defensive pivot as well, taking advantage of its ability to switch into special attackers it walls, like Greninja and Nidoking, to maintain momentum for the team by bringing attackers in safely. Soft-Boiled increases Blissey's longevity, allowing it to support its team throughout the match. Seismic Toss deals consistent damage, enabling Blissey to weaken most of the threats it walls while making it not fully stopped by Taunt. Lastly, Stealth Rock weakens opposing teams gradually, which helps offensive Pokemon like Diggersby and Mega Lopunny net crucial KOs. However, Toxic can be used to further diminish Blissey's passiveness by heavily crippling defensive and offensive threats alike, such as Zapdos and Hydreigon. Maximum HP and Defense investments with a Bold nature are needed to patch Blissey's physical frailty, ensuring it can comfortably shrug weaker physical hits from the likes of Choice Scarf Excadrill and Mega Diancie. Natural Cure lets Blissey absorb status aliments for the team. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents entry hazard damage, which gives Blissey better Teleport pivoting that sets it apart from the bulkier Chansey.</p> <p>All of Blissey's teammates appreciate its supportive and slow pivoting capabilities. Porygon2 stands out as Blissey's best partner because it can easily soak physical hits Blissey is unable to, including from threats like Mega Sharpedo and Mega Scizor, while also being able to pivot out with Teleport. In return, Blissey absorbs status for Porygon2 and takes on special threats that bypass it such as Landorus and Volcarona, making the pair a formidable defensive backbone for Normal teams. Defensive Staraptor is also a good teammate given it switches in on physical Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Infernape for Blissey. It also has access to U-turn to keep momentum in tandem with Blissey's Teleport. Ditto patches Blissey's general vulnerability to setup sweepers like Dragonite and Cloyster by KOing them after it gets brought into the field via Teleport. It also helps Blissey massively against walls that beat it one-on-one like Celesteela and Toxic Toxapex. Mega Lopunny can threaten Ghost-types like Mega Sableye with its access to Scrappy, and Mega Pidgeot beats most Fighting-types that threaten Blissey such as Mega Gallade. Both Mega Pokemon can also form a pivoting core with Blissey due to their fast U-turns and moves to threaten Steel-types like Ferrothorn. Wallbreakers like Diggersby and Heliolisk all appreciate Blissey bringing them safely into the field with Teleport and weakening their targets with its Stealth Rock or Toxic support. In the same vein, Porygon-Z can more easily pull off a sweep with Blissey's aforementioned perks.</p> "

Rock Slide lets it take care of many threats to Dark teams such as Volcarona, Tornadus-T, and Mega Charizard Y. Heavy Slam gives Tyranitar the ability to take on Tapu Lele and Hatterene, while Fire Blast hits most Steel-type physical walls such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor that would otherwise wall Tyranitar. Tyranitar can cripple faster foes that don't get OHKOed by Rock Slide with Thunder Wave such as Latios and Dragonite. Leftovers gives Tyranitar some passive recovery that increases its longevity. Maximum HP and Special Defense gives Tyranitar as much special bulk as possible, allowing it to tank almost any unboosted special attack in sand. Sassy nature is preferred if Fire Blast is chosen over Heavy Slam.</p> <p>All of Tyranitar's teammates appreciate Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave support. Hydreigon especially helps in the Poison and Steel matchups as a Substitute + Nasty Plot sweeper or a faster teammate for an edge in the Dragon matchup. Mega Sableye is a great choice as a Mega Evolution and can act in tandem with Tyranitar, since it is immune to Fighting and can keep entry hazards off your side of the field while spreading burns with Will-O-Wisp. Greninja can be geared to help in any matchup and runs a variety of different sets including Choice Specs, Choice Scarf, Grassium-Z, Icium-Z or Expert Belt. Choice Specs is particularly helpful in the Dragon and Flying matchups, while Grassium-Z is great in the Water and Ground matchups. Icium-Z helps break defensive Celesteela after an Ice Beam, and Extrasensory with Expert Belt can break through Toxapex and Mega Venusaur, which give Tyranitar a lot of trouble. Choice Scarf Greninja can revenge kill opposing Choice Scarf users such as Latios, Latias, and Landorus-T as well as Mega Aerodactyl. Toxic Spikes can be fitted into any of these sets to support entry hazard stacking. Mandibuzz can help check physical setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Mega Scizor, and is also able to clear entry hazards with Defog. Alolan Muk is extremely helpful with taking on pesky Fairy-types and can take advantage of Fairy teams' passive Pokemon such as Klefki to set up with Curse. Zarude is another great teammate that gives an edge in the Water and Ground matchups since it becomes very dangerous after one or two Bulk Ups, and Weavile could be helpful versus Flying with its hard hitting STAB Ice-type attacks. Bisharp is a strong physical attacker that can set up with Swords Dance and provides great priority in Sucker Punch.</p> "

Blacephalon helps greatly against Steel-, Grass-, and Ice-types like Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Galarian Darmanitan and is able to act as a reliable revenge killer with Choice Scarf, outspeeding and taking care of some of Mega Sableye's threats like Mega Lopunny and Tapu Koko. Gengar is another great offensive teammate that wallbreaks with Choice Specs and is a great asset in matchups like Fairy. Lightning Rod Alolan Marowak proves to be a good teammate, as it blocks Electric-type moves from the likes of Tapu Koko and Regieleki.</p> "

Lava Plume is the only attacking move on the set, hits decently hard with sun support, and is used to fish for burns against physical attackers like Mimikyu, Mega Lopunny, and Zeraora.

Due to the role compression that Torkoal provides, it is essential to keep it around for its Drought and hazard removal support. Maximum HP and Defense investment with a Bold nature makes Torkoal as bulky as possible, allowing it to take on physical attackers like Mega Lopunny, Mega Gallade, and Dragonite a lot better.

They also appreciate Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin support to have an easier time wallbreaking and safely setting up. Specially defensive Heatran is also a good partner to Torkoal because it can sponge special hits for it from the likes of Latios and Tapu Lele and check Nihilego for the team thanks to its Rock neutrality. Volcanion provides an important immunity to Water-type attacks, which lets it check Belly Drum Azumarill, and secondary hazard removal with Defog, taking pressure off from Torkoal. Alolan Marowak can cover Electric-type attacks for Torkoal from threats like Tapu Koko, Regieleki, and Alolan Raichu. It can also break apart defensive types like Poison with sun support and a Swords Dance boost.

Despite the downside of the Special Attack drop, forcing Latias to switch out more often than not, Draco Meteor acts as Latias's strongest STAB move, allowing it to revenge kill major threats to Psychic-type teams such as Mega Sharpedo and Blacephalon while also aiding greatly in the Dragon-type matchup. Psychic acts as Latias's secondary STAB option, preventing it from being completely shut down by Fairy-types, while also dealing with common Poison- and Fighting-types such as Nidoking, Toxapex, and Terrakion.

        "description": "<p>A high Attack stat coupled with exceptional coverage and an incredible Speed tier that outpaces major threats such as Tapu Koko, Cinderace, and Greninja makes Mega Lopunny a very strong offensive Pokemon for Normal teams. Fake Out lets Mega Lopunny move first, inflicting chip damage on faster offensive targets like Zeraora and Choice Scarf Greninja and putting Pokemon like Keldeo and Tapu Bulu in KO range from its other moves. Close Combat is Mega Lopunny's go-to attack, nailing Rock-, Steel-, and Dark-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, and Mega Sableye. It also 2HKOes most neutral targets by virtue of its raw power. Triple Axel beautifully complements Close Combat, enabling Mega Lopunny to beat Dragon-types like Dragonite and Garchomp while also turning it into a threat against Dark, Flying, and Ground teams by OHKOing Gliscor and Landorus, as well as 2HKOing Mandibuzz, Zapdos, and specially defensive Hippowdon. U-turn rounds off the set, taking advantage of the walls like Slowbro and Torkoal Mega Lopunny forces onto the field as a way to generate momentum for the team while whittling down the opposition. Maximum Attack and Speed investment alongside a Jolly nature bolsters Mega Lopunny's offensive potential. Limber should be used as the pre-Mega ability because it grants Lopunny a useful immunity to paralysis before Mega Evolving. Scrappy gives Mega Lopunny perfect neutral coverage by letting it hit Ghost-types with its STAB moves and lets it ignore Intimidate from Staraptor and Landorus-T.</p> <p>All of Mega Lopunny's teammates benefit from its capability to take on Steel-, Ghost-, and Rock-type Pokemon that are problematic for Normal teams. Blissey is a great partner, as it can absorb status for Mega Lopunny with its Natural Cure, supply Stealth Rock support, and bring it safely onto the field via Teleport. In return, Mega Lopunny shreds the likes of Mega Sableye and Ferrothorn and is able to comfortably switch into undesired Knock Offs for it. Diggersby forms an exceptional offensive core with Mega Lopunny; with its extreme power, it can defeat certain defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Mega Venusaur that stop Mega Lopunny cold. Conversely, Mega Lopunny revenge kills threats faster than Diggersby such as Nidoking and Greninja and can bring it safely onto the field with U-turn. Choice Scarf Ditto is able to outspeed and either beat or force out threats to Mega Lopunny like Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Altaria. Defensive Staraptor shrugs off physical Fighting-type attacks directed at Mega Lopunny such as Choice Scarf Terrakion's Close Combat, blows away entry hazards with Defog, and has U-turn to form a pivoting core with it. Similarly, Porygon2's sheer bulk enables it to comfortably tank attacks from revenge killers like Choice Scarf Excadrill and safely Teleport out, getting Mega Lopunny into battle unscathed as a result. With its Ghost-type Z-Conversion set, Porygon-Z can eliminate Psychic-types like Celebi and physical walls like Skarmory for Mega Lopunny.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Mega Lopunny's access to Power-Up Punch and Encore in conjunction with its offensive perks lets it run a wallbreaking set that can effectively threaten popular defensive cores in the metagame like Steel's Aegislash + Heatran + Celesteela and Dark's Mega Sableye + Mandibuzz + Tyranitar. Power-Up Punch boosts Mega Lopunny's already high Attack stat to astronomical levels while not being stopped by Taunt. Encore is a very useful tool to lock slower Pokemon like Jirachi and Mantine into support or recovery moves, giving Mega Lopunny free setup opportunities with Power-Up Punch or valuable momentum for the team. Return is Mega Lopunny's most reliable STAB move and its main way to dish out damage; after a boost, it can 2HKO most physical walls that don't resist it, such as Zapdos and Clefable, as well as OHKO frailer Pokemon like Nidoking and Volcarona. Close Combat complements Mega Lopunny's perfect coverage, nailing bulky Steel- and Rock-types that resist Return, such as Aegislash and Cradily, as well as Dark-types like Hydreigon. Maximum Attack and Speed EVs with a Jolly nature make Mega Lopunny as powerful and fast as possible. Limber is Lopunny's pre-Mega ability, which grants it a useful paralysis immunity before it Mega Evolves. Scrappy gives Mega Lopunny perfect STAB neutral coverage while also enabling it to break through Intimidate Pokemon like Staraptor and Landorus-T by ignoring its effect.</p> <p>Balanced Normal teams greatly appreciate the role compression this Mega Lopunny set provides by being a very effective hole puncher and revenge killer in one slot. Because of this, Z-Conversion Porygon-Z stands out as its best offensive partner, as they form an offensive core capable of covering most matchups. Porygon-Z fondly benefits from Mega Lopunny removing Dark-types and specially defensive Pokemon like Alolan Muk and Gastrodon. In return, Porygon-Z defeats bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types like Jirachi and Galarian Corsola as well as physical walls such as Celesteela and Mega Venusaur. Blissey is a great partner as well, since it can absorb troublesome status conditions with its Natural Cure, set up Stealth Rock so Mega Lopunny can score crucial KOs, and safely bring it onto the field with Teleport. Ditto is able to pick off faster Pokemon that threaten to revenge kill Mega Lopunny, such as Excadrill under sand and Zeraora. Defensive Staraptor switches into physical Fighting-types like Choice Scarf Buzzwole and Infernape, keeps entry hazards off the field with Defog, and can safely get Mega Lopunny in with its U-turn, allowing Mega Lopunny to enter the battlefield unscathed. Porygon2's insane bulk makes it a great switch-in to priority moves such as Mamoswine's Ice Shard and Dragonite's Extreme Speed and opposing revenge killers like Choice Scarf Greninja that can pick off a weakened Mega Lopunny. It can shrug off these assaults and Teleport out, reliably bringing Mega Lopunny back in.</p> "

Stealth Rock most notably helps against Flying- and Bug-types and breaks Focus Sash and Sturdy for Hippowdon's teammates to break through their users more easily. Earthquake deals solid damage and prevents Hippowdon from being completely useless against Taunt users such as Kommo-o. Slack Off in tandem with Leftovers provides reliable recovery for Hippowdon, increasing its longevity throughout the game. Whirlwind phazes setup sweepers such as Mega Scizor and Mega Altaria that try to take advantage of Hippowdon while also forcefully chipping down foes when combined with Stealth Rock. Maximum HP and Defense EVs along with a Impish nature allow Hippowdon to be as physically bulky as possible to deal with physical attackers such as Bisharp, Mega Lopunny, and Excadrill.</p> <p>Excadrill is Hippowdon's best teammate, greatly benefits from Hippowdon's sand doubling its speed thanks to Sand Rush. Excadrill can also deal with threats like Kyurem, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Bulu for Hippowdon under sand and get rid of Spikes and Toxic Spikes for it with Rapid Spin. Seismitoad and Gastrodon can freely switch in against any Water-type move directed at Hippowdon, and Seismitoad can deal with Azumarill, while Gastrodon can use Clear Smog to deal with setup sweepers such as Kommo-o that Hippowdon falls short against. Mega Garchomp also appreciates sand set up by Hippowdon which further increases the damage done by its Rock- and Ground-type attacks. Landorus can break through Grass-type teams, deal with Grass-type threats like Ferrothorn and Tapu Bulu and also provide the team with a solid special wallbreaker. It can also set up Gravity, helping against Flying-types like Celesteela and Skarmory. Mega Steelix is a great teammate, as it can switch in against physical attackers that Hippowdon is threatened by, like Tapu Bulu, while also aiding greatly in matchups such as Dragon, Normal, and Fairy. Much like Landorus, Nidoking can act a great special attacker, breaking through Flying-, Water-, and Steel-type teams through its great Sheer Force-boosted coverage options in Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, and Ice Beam. Nidoking can also provide Toxic Spikes support, which helps greatly in matchups like Psychic and Fairy. Mamoswine is a great teammate that can improve the Flying-, Grass-, and Dragon-type matchups while also providing a semi-reliable switch-in against Ice-type attacks directed at Hippowdon thanks to Thick Fat. Gliscor is a great stallbreaker and absorber of status moves directed at Hippowdon, and it can opt to run Defog if necessary, providing a means of hazard control.</p> "

Icicle Crash allows it to get rid of Mandibuzz, Tapu Bulu, and Dragonite. Ice Shard provides useful priority for fast threats like Landorus, Hydreigon, Latias, and Latios, especially if they are weakened. Superpower is a useful move for targeting Ferrothorn and Porygon2; however, Knock Off gets rid of items like Eviolite, Leftovers, and Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon such as Galarian Corsola, Porygon2, Celesteela, and Blissey. An Adamant nature paired with a Choice Band maximizes Mamoswine's damage output, letting it pick off weakened threats with Ice Shard better and have a better chance of KOing a weakened Celesteela or Corviknight.

Generally, Mamoswine should be used to wallbreak types like Flying, Poison, and Dragon early-game, and it can clean weakened teams with Ice Shard late-game.</p> <p>Hippowdon is a great partner, as it tanks hits for Mamoswine due to its good bulk, can phaze out threatening foes like Mega Scizor and Mega Gallade with Whirlwind, and provide Stealth Rock and Sand Stream support, which gives Mamoswine an easier time sweeping late-game by racking chip damage on foes. Landorus is an essential wallbreaker, as it can not only break through physically defensive foes like Slowbro and Mega Sableye for Mamoswine, but utilize Gravity in order to make Mamoswine's Earthquake useful against threats like Celesteela, Rotom-W, and Corviknight. Gastrodon and Seismitoad can absorb Water-type attacks for Mamoswine; Gastrodon has access to reliable recovery, and Seismitoad can outspeed and threaten Azumarill as well as use its higher physical bulk to take attacks from Pokemon like Barraskewda more easily.

Garchomp can break through most walls due to Swords Dance and Dragonium Z while weakening Celesteela with Fire Fang and providing a useful neutrality to Water- and Grass-type attacks. Mega Garchomp can destroy foes like Celesteela and Ferrothorn with Fire Blast while living an Aqua Jet from +6 Azumarill and threatening it back with a Sand Force-boosted Earthquake. Mega Steelix is a powerful bulky sweeper with Curse that can also live a hit from +6 Azumarill's Aqua Jet and threaten it back with Heavy Slam, and it also threatens other foes like Tapu Bulu and Rillaboom.</p> "

Pain Split is helpful if Rotom-W is weakened, healing off of high-HP foes such as Blissey.

Corviknight can give it a safe switch-in with U-turn and threaten Fighting-types with Brave Bird, Skarmory can set entry hazards so that Excadrill can force progress against bulkier teams, and Celesteela threatens Grass-types like Ferrothorn, Rillaboom, and Zarude with Flamethrower. In return, Excadrill provides an Electric immunity and can take on threats such as Choice Band Zeraora and Tapu Koko. Aegislash and Heatran provide a Fighting and Fire immunity, respectively, and can switch into most special attacks aimed at Excadrill. Heatran, in particular, can nullify V-create from Choice Scarf Victini, which outspeeds Excadrill and poses a huge threat to Steel teams. Wallbreakers such as Bisharp, Mega Scizor, and Choice Specs Aegislash can pressure physical walls such as Porygon2, Slowbro, and Mega Venusaur, which helps Excadrill clean opposing Normal, Psychic, and Poison teams late-game.</p> "

With Protect, Ferrothorn gets an extra turn of Leech Seed and Leftovers recovery and the ability to scout Choice item users like Diggersby, Mamoswine, and Blacephalon.

Aegislash also helps with Ferrothorn's weaknesses, as it is immune to Fighting-type attacks, and prevents Rapid Spin from removing Ferrothorn's Spikes. Due to its typing, bulk, and ability to set up, Mega Scizor checks certain Fighting-types such as Mega Lopunny. In return, Mega Scizor excels with Spikes support from Ferrothorn, as it becomes that much easier to sweep with Bullet Punch later in the game. Z-Happy Hour Jirachi and Bisharp are other similar late-game sweepers that capitalize off of Ferrothorn's Spikes support and chip damage. Jirachi's Psychic typing makes it a good answer to troublesome Fighting-types like Keldeo and Kommo-o, while Bisharp takes on Psychic- and Ghost-type foes such as Latias, Aegislash, and Latios.

Stealth Rock primarily helps against threats weak to it like Choice Specs Zapdos and Alolan Ninetales. Cobalion's decent defensive stats and good Speed mean it can successfully set Stealth Rock more often than not. Iron Head helps against Fairy-types that threaten Fighting-type teams like Mega Diancie and Tapu Lele. Taunt blocks foes from using Taunt and recovery moves, as well as blocking their own entry hazards or Defog to remove Cobalion's Stealth Rock. Thunder Wave is used to cripple faster offensive threats that Cobalion fails to do much against like Deoxys-S and Latios. Volt Switch can be used in lieu of Thunder Wave, making Coballion a great defensive pivot while maintaining offensive momentum. Justified allows it to switch into weak Dark-type attacks from the likes of Mandibuzz and gain an Attack boost. A Jolly nature allows Cobalion to outspeed key threats like both Urshifu-R, Kyurem, Hydreigon, non-Choice Scarf Blacephalon, and Tapu Lele while Speed tying with Pokemon such as Keldeo and Terrakion.</p> <p>All of Cobalion's teammates appreciate it reliably setting up Stealth Rock while also being able to paralyze faster foes for them. Terrakion and Keldeo reliably deal with Fire-types like Volcarona and Victini that threaten Cobalion. Keldeo can also threaten Ground-types that threaten Cobalion such as Landorus and Excadrill. Both Terrakion and Keldeo also appreciate. Volt Switch Cobalion reliably pivoting into them, as do Mega Gallade and Kommo-o looking for good setup opportunities. Mega Gallade also eases matchups such as Poison and Steel where Cobalion fails to do anything significant, and Kommo-o has Taunt to take on opposing walls like Toxapex and Celesteela that deal with Cobalion. Urshifu-S, Heracross, and Buzzwole fit well on Fighting teams because they aid greatly in the Psychic-type matchup. Hawlucha is able to ease the Fighting-type mirror matchup while taking care of Fighting-types that threaten Cobalion, like opposing Keldeo and Choice Scarf users such as Heracross and Buzzwole. Lastly, Breloom can be opted for on certain teams to ease matchups such as Ground and Water where Cobalion fails to do anything of significance besides setting Stealth Rock.</p> "

Sludge Wave threatens the Grass-types that resist Earth Power, such as Tapu Bulu and Celebi, while OHKOing Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele and Hatterene. Focus Blast nails Dark-, Ice-, and Normal-types, like Hydreigon, Kyurem, and Porygon2, while hitting Skarmory without relying on Gravity and targeting Ferrothorn. Gravity removes Ground immunities from foes that would otherwise check Landorus such as Celesteela, Rotom-W, and Zapdos, making Landorus's Earth Power and its teammates' Ground-type STAB moves much more spammable. It also ensures Focus Blast always lands, heightening Landorus's reliability in the Normal, Dark, and Steel matchups. Life Orb works well in tandem with Sheer Force, which negates Life Orb's recoil and adds to its damage boost. A Timid nature is needed in order for Landorus to outspeed common foes like Victini, Tapu Lele, and Hydreigon.</p> <p>Excadrill pairs extremely well with Landorus, as it can deal with specially defensive walls that Landorus struggles with, such as Blissey and Slowking, while outspeeding fast threats to Landorus like Choice Scarf Weavile, Tapu Koko, and Mega Lopunny when under sand. In return, Landorus can provide valuable support to Excadrill with Gravity, letting it beat its usual checks like Skarmory, Celesteela, and Porygon2, in addition to dealing with physically defensive foes such as Porygon2 and Mega Sableye for it. Hippowdon provides a switch-in against certain foes that can outspeed and threaten Landorus such as Mega Gallade, Cinderace, and Garchomp. It also wears down most foes with Stealth Rock and Sand Stream, which Landorus generally appreciates. Gastrodon and Seismitoad both switch completely freely into Water-type attacks from the likes of Mega Swampert, Keldeo, and Mantine for Landorus. Gastrodon is also able to reliably take and heal off most other moves from Water-types thanks to its high bulk and Recover, while Seismitoad is one of the best ways for Ground teams to offensively deal with them. Mamoswine deals with troublesome Dragon-types such as Latias, Mega Latios, and Dragonite as well as Flying-types that Landorus relies on Gravity in order to beat, like Zapdos and Dragonite. Garchomp and Mega Garchomp are fearsome wallbreakers that pressure specially defensive walls like Blissey and Slowking while providing a Water neutrality. Mega Steelix's absurdly high Defense stat and Steel typing make it a fierce bulky sweeper with Curse that can consistently check Azumarill and take on Grass-, Normal-, and Dragon-types for Landorus, such as Rillaboom, Blissey, and Mega Altaria.</p> "

Additionally, Disguise lets Mimikyu act as a potent revenge killer as well, giving it an opportunity to handle extremely threatening foes such as Hydreigon, Weavile, and boosted Kommo-o while blanket checking most other Pokemon. Swords Dance boosts Mimikyu's underwhelming damage output to high levels, and it can be used on Pokemon that it forces out such as Mega Sableye, Tyranitar, and Mandibuzz. Drain Punch hits Steel-types like Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Magnezone super effectively while providing Mimikyu with passive recovery. Shadow Claw can be used instead to deal much more damage to walls like Galarian Corsola, Aegislash, and Slowbro. After a Swords Dance boost, Shadow Sneak OHKOes faster threats like Blacephalon, Gengar, and Alolan Raichu while KOing weakened foes such as Barraskewda, Tapu Koko, and Victini. However, be cautious of using Shadow Sneak against Victini if Psychic Terrain is up. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature is used to outspeed Pokemon like Kyurem, Nidoking, and Tapu Lele. Mimikyu should avoid switching into attacks in order to preserve Disguise. It is also best used as a late-game cleaner once walls are weakened.</p> <p>All Ghost teams appreciate Mimikyu's ability to deal with Dark- and Dragon-types and act as a potent late-game wincon. Mega Sableye and Galarian Corsola both provide a defensive backbone for Mimikyu, switching into powerful attacks for it. Mega Sableye provides a useful neutrality to Ghost and Dark, absorbs Knock Off for Mimikyu, deals with threatening attackers like Blacephalon and Nidoking, and deflects troublesome entry hazards like Spikes and Toxic Spikes with Magic Bounce. Swords Dance Aegislash is a great teammate due to its ability to deal with or weaken walls like Galarian Weezing, Porygon2, and Celesteela for Mimikyu. SubToxic Aegislash can also be used to wear down walls like Hippowdon and Porygon2 with Toxic, which Mimikyu appreciates. Choice Specs Gengar takes on physically defensive walls such as Toxapex, Galarian Weezing, and Skarmory, making it a useful teammate. Additionally, Gengar absorbs Toxic Spikes for Mimikyu. Choice Scarf Blacephalon can also take on walls like Galarian Weezing and Skarmory while revenge killing foes that pose a threat to Mimikyu like Choice Scarf Excadrill and Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan.

Swords Dance boosts Mimikyu's average Attack stat and, in conjunction with Disguise, allows it to act as a potent late-game wincon. Play Rough is Mimikyu's strongest attack and allows it to deal with dangerous Dragon-, Dark-, and Fighting-type threats such as Hydreigon, Greninja, and Terrakion. Shadow Claw allows Mimikyu to deal with opposing Ghost-types and Psychic-types such as Blacephalon, Gengar, Tapu Lele, and Victini. Shadow Sneak further enhances Mimikyu as a formidable late-game sweeper, being able to deal with weakened threats and OHKO threats like Gengar, Blacephalon, and Latios after a Swords Dance boost, making Mimikyu a key wincon in the Psychic- and Ghost-type matchups. Maximum Speed investment along with a Jolly nature allows Mimikyu to outspeed key threats in Tapu Lele, Nidoking and Excadrill. Life Orb helps ameliorate Mimikyu's subpar Attack stat while also ensuring Shadow Sneak does considerable damage.</p> <p>Klefki pairs exceptionally well with Mimikyu, as it provides dual screens support, Spikes support, and a Poison-type immunity. Spikes helps weaken foes, allowing Mimikyu to sweep late-game without much trouble, while dual screens make Mimikyu an even more reliable setup sweeper. Klefki can also provide Thunder Wave support, crippling threats that outspeed Mimikyu like Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Lopunny. Mega Diancie helps greatly in the Fire-, Flying-, and Ice-type matchups while also providing Stealth Rock support to chip down foes. Mega Diancie's Magic Bounce also blocks entry hazards such as Spike and Toxic Spikes that could easily cripple Mimikyu. Tapu Koko teams up well with Mimikyu, mostly because it deals with walls such as Skarmory, Celesteela, and Toxapex that can deal with Mimikyu without much trouble while also helping greatly in the Flying- and Water-type matchups. Tapu Bulu is able to break through Mimikyu's walls such as Hippowdon and defensive Water-types such as Toxapex and Swampert. Tapu Lele has useful wallbreaking capabilities with Choice Specs, dealing with Mimikyu's defensive checks such as Toxapex, while also aiding in the Poison matchup. Belly Drum Azumarill pairs well with Mimikyu as a secondary sweeper, mainly helping in the Steel matchup, which Mimikyu struggles in greatly. Togekiss is able to break through defensive Grass-types like Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn for Mimikyu.</p> "

Drain Punch allows Kommo-o to take care of troubling Normal-, Steel-, Ice-, and Dark-types such as Blissey, Heatran, Mamoswine, and Tyranitar while giving it some passive recovery. Flamethrower goes well with its Fighting typing, as it enables Kommo-o to take care of other Steel- and Ice-types such as Mega Scizor, Corviknight, and Avalugg. Taunt is used to avoid phazing from Whirlwind users like Skarmory and Hippowdon and Toxapex's Haze, along with blocking Toxic from Pokemon like Aegislash and Blissey.

Dragalge can also absorb Toxic Spikes to protect Kommo-o from being poisoned.

Latias is great speed control for Dragon teams, as it can take care of Keldeo, Mega Swampert, and Cloyster after it uses Shell Smash. It is also useful to get rid of entry hazards with Defog and bring back Kommo-o to full health with Healing Wish. Mega Latias is a great teammate for Kommo-o, as it can help greatly in the Flying-type matchup by taking care of Tornadus-T and Zapdos thanks to its BoltBeam coverage. Hydreigon helps greatly in the Psychic- and Ghost-type matchups taking care of threats like Blacephalon and Celebi. Hydreigon can also bring Kommo-o in with U-turn.</p> "

Hidden Power Ice deals with troublesome Ground-types like Landorus and Gliscor, which freely switch in against Electric-type attacks. Volt Switch allows Tapu Koko to act as a great offensive pivot to maintain offensive pressure while to bring teammates safely into the field.

When under Electric Terrain, it also outspeeds and handles the likes of Sand Rush Excadrill, Choice Scarf Greninja, and Mega Swampert in rain, which all outspeed and threaten Zeraora. Zapdos can deal with Ground- and Grass-types like Excadrill, Rillaboom, and Tapu Bulu while removing entry hazards that may cripple Zeraora with Defog. With its Choice Specs set, it is able to power through the defensive Grass- and Ground-types, such as Mega Venusaur and Swampert, that Zeraora hates. Zapdos or Rotom-W can provide a Ground immunity, with the latter forcing out Ground-types like Hippowdon, Mamoswine, and Gliscor with a powerful STAB Hydro Pump and keeping certain revenge killers in check for Zeraora, such as Choice Scarf Blacephalon and Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan. Both Magnezone and Alolan Golem can trap and eliminate or weaken certain Steel-types like Excadrill and Ferrothorn, giving Zeraora a better shot at breaking through Steel teams. Notably, Magnezone's Steel typing lets it take on Pokemon like Latias while making it a switch-in against Fairy- and Poison-type attacks, and Alolan Golem can provide Stealth Rock support.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Flyinium Z Zeraora capitalizes on luring in and KOing the Grass-types that typically trouble Electric teams, such as Mega Venusaur, Tapu Bulu, and Rillaboom, making it a fearsome physical wallbreaker and setup sweeper. Bulk Up lets Zeraora set up in front of Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Tyranitar, making it deadly in matchups like Steel and Dark by becoming difficult to wall and revenge kill after a couple of boosts. Close Combat provides important coverage against foes such as Blissey, Heatran, and Ferrothorn. Bounce is required in the last moveslot to use Supersonic Skystrike, powerful Flying-type coverage that makes Zeraora very threatening against Grass and Poison teams. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Zeraora to outspeed fast foes like Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu and Mega Lopunny, as well as Barraskewda outside of rain.</p> <p>All teammates on Electric teams appreciate Flyinium Z Zeraora luring in and removing troublesome Grass-types, like Mega Venusaur and Tapu Bulu, while still retaining the ability to defeat specially defensive walls such as Blissey and Tyranitar. Tapu Koko can handle Dragon-types such as Kommo-o, Mega Latias, and unboosted Mega Altaria, which are especially troublesome for Zeraora. Additionally, it can beat annoying Ground-types for Zeraora such as Landorus-T and Gliscor with Hidden Power Ice, as well as Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Seismitoad with Grass Knot. Alongside Zeraora, Alolan Raichu can put a lot of pressure on Poison-types such as Mega Venusaur and Galarian Weezing due to its Psychic typing, while also beating Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Seismitoad with Grass Knot. Additionally, it outspeeds almost the entire metagame under Electric Terrain, which crucially lets it handle threats that outspeed even Zeraora like boosted Kommo-o, Kingdra in rain, and Sand Rush Excadrill. Tapu Koko, Alolan Raichu, and Regieleki can all handle physically bulky checks to Zeraora like Porygon2 and Galarian Corsola as well. Zapdos provides a Ground immunity for threats like Excadrill while removing entry hazards for Zeraora. It can also dispose of defensive Ground-type threats such as Mega Steelix with its Choice Specs set. Rotom-W forces out Ground-types like Hippowdon, Mamoswine, and Gliscor due to Levitate and its powerful STAB Hydro Pump. It also keeps certain faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf Victini, Barraskewda, and Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan in check for Zeraora. Both Magnezone and Alolan Golem can trap and eliminate or weaken Steel-types like Excadrill and Ferrothorn, giving Zeraora an even better shot at breaking through Steel teams. Magnezone's Steel typing also lets it provide a switch-in against Fairy-, Dragon-, and Poison-type attacks, and Alolan Golem can provide Stealth Rock support.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Fire</h1> <p>On the Offensive Pivot set, Court Change can replace High Jump Kick or Gunk Shot as a way to get rid of entry hazards for Fire teams, notably Stealth Rock, while taking advantage of opposing field effects such as Reflect or Light Screen. However, stripping away coverage defeats the purpose of the set, which is to immediately threaten types like Fairy, Psychic, and Dark with its moves. Fire teams also already have entry hazard removal in Torkoal and dual screens Rotom-H, making it unneeded most of the time. Electro Ball can be a very powerful niche move , OHKOing Pelipper and surprising Slowbro and Toxapex on the switch, but it doesn't do much outside of this. Choice Scarf allows Cinderace to act as a great revenge killer, outspeeding other Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion, Galarian Darmanitan, and Tapu Lele as well as the likes of Cloyster after a Shell Smash boost, Mega Swampert under rain, Tapu Koko, and Mega Aerodactyl.

        "description": "<p>Bulk Up Cinderace's great Speed tier and excellent Libero-boosted coverage moves allow it to threaten a myriad of types like Steel, Dark, and Normal. Its powerful STAB moves can be used to force switches, which can be utilized as a chance for Cinderace to Bulk Up to become even more threatening. Pyro Ball is Cinderace's most reliable move, nailing Steel- and Grass-types like Aegislash and Ferrothorn, and neutral targets such as Clefable while avoiding Rocky Helmet, Baneful Bunker, and King's Shield due to its lack of contact. High Jump Kick complements Pyro Ball's coverage, allowing Cinderace to hit certain Dark-, Steel-, and Normal-types hard, such as Tyranitar, Heatran, and Porygon2. Sucker Punch provides counterplay against frailer Pokemon that outspeed Cinderace, such as Choice Scarf Latios, Barraskewda, Choice Scarf Blacephalon, Alolan Raichu under Electric Terrain, and weakened Mega Aerodactyl. However, Zen Headbutt is an alternative alongside Psychium Z to let Cinderace lure in and OHKO threats to Fire teams such as Toxapex, Mega Diancie, Urshifu-R, and Keldeo with Shattered Psyche. Bulk Up Cinderace should be used as either a mid-game wallbreaker or as a sweeper, utilizing its great coverage moves boosted by Libero in order to break through teams.</p> <p>Mega Charizard X and Volcarona are both very potent setup sweepers that benefit from Cinderace getting rid of walls such as Toxapex and Tyranitar. In particular, boosted Mega Charizard X also defeats Dragon-types that threaten Cinderace like Garchomp and Mega Latias. Rotom-H is a great teammate to Cinderace, as it can set dual screens to help Cinderace set up while safely bringing it in with Volt Switch, or it can work as a Nasty Plot wallbreaker that can beat defensive Water- and Flying-types like Toxapex and Moltres for Cinderace. It also switches into Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Regieleki, but it needs to rely on Pain Split to keep itself healthy. Mega Charizard Y breaks through the physically defensive walls that can give Cinderace trouble such as Galarian Corsola and Slowbro. In return, Cinderace beats the special walls that Mega Charizard Y struggles against such as Blissey and Heatran. Blacephalon can soften up bulky Pokemon like Hippowdon and Gastrodon with its Choice Specs set or sweep late-game while wielding a Choice Scarf. Stallbreaker Heatran can trap and remove walls like Toxapex and Zapdos with Magma Storm, as well as checking offensive Rock-types like Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Nihilego by virtue of its Steel typing. Torkoal is able to set up Stealth Rock for Cinderace and provide sun support via Drought, enabling Cinderace's Pyro Ball to hit even harder. Choice Scarf Infernape is a very useful revenge killer that can dispose of threats that outspeed and OHKO Cinderace, such as the aforementioned Choice Scarf Nihilego and Greninja, while Choice Band Infernape is able to weaken bulky Pokemon like Rotom-W and Gliscor, relieving the pressure on Cinderace and allowing it to set up easier. If Cinderace is using Heavy-Duty Boots, Z-Celebrate Victini is a great teammate that takes advantage of Cinderace checking common checks to it such as defensive Heatran and Chansey. Conversely, Victini can heavily damage Pokemon Cinderace has trouble hitting effectively, such as Toxapex, Mega Venusaur, Mantine, and Tapu Fini.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive Pivot (Fire)",
        "description": "<p>Cinderace's great Speed tier, generous movepool, and great ability in Libero allow for an effective pivot set that can immediately threaten teams vulnerable to its coverage. Pyro Ball hits most foes decently while avoiding contact-based side effects. U-turn allows Cinderace to pivot out of the various defensive switches it forces while generating momentum and dealing solid damage. High Jump Kick targets the bulky Normal-, Rock-, and Dark-types that shrug off Pyro Ball such as Porygon2, Rhyperior, and Tyranitar. Alongside Pyro Ball, it creates a fearsome combination that hits all Steel-types in the metagame super effectively, making Cinderace a great tool in the Steel matchup. Gunk Shot can be run instead, hitting pesky Fairy-types and certain Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Azumarill, Tapu Fini, Araquanid, and Mantine. Sucker Punch allows Cinderace to revenge kill faster weakened threats like Zeraora, Barraskewda, and Choice Scarf Latias. Maximum Speed EVs let Cinderace outspeed and beat threats like Gengar, Tapu Lele, and Hydreigon.</p> <p>This Cinderace set is an all-out attacker rather than a reliable sweeper or wallbreaker, so it's best paired with Pokemon that capitalize on the offensive pressure it generates. Torkoal is a great partner to Cinderace, providing sun support and laying down Stealth Rock so Cinderace can net more KOs. Choice Band Victini and Infernape are fellow pivots capable of wearing down physically defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Hippowdon, and Mega Venusaur so Cinderace has an easier time versus them. Similarly, Mega Charizard Y breaks down some of the physical walls that annoy Cinderace like Mega Slowbro and Swampert while also setting sun for it. In return, it appreciates Cinderace breaking common special walls, like Blissey and Heatran, and forcing out some of its offensive checks like Mega Diancie. Sweepers like Mega Charizard X and Z-move Volcarona also appreciate Cinderace beating the likes of Azumarill ~if running Gunk Shot, Tyranitar, and Heatran so they have an easier time cleaning against Fairy, Dark, and Steel teams, respectively. They also benefit from Cinderace's U-turn getting them safely into the field. Volcanion is another hard hitter that synergizes well with Cinderace because of its Water immunity, dealing with Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Seismitoad while additionally KOing Pokemon such as Toxapex and Hippowdon.</p> "
