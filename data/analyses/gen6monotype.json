        "description": "<p>Substitute is used against Pokemon Raikou forces out like Landorus and Choice Band Victini and defensive Pokemon such as Zapdos. Substitute also goes well with Pressure, as it allows Raikou to stall out low PP moves like Draco Meteor and Close Combat from Latios and Terrakion, respectively. Calm Mind allows it to turn into a dangerous sweeper to help with opposing special attackers such as Hydreigon and Mega Venusaur. Thunderbolt hits Pokemon like Skarmory and Slowbro. Shadow Ball targets Psychic-types like Mega Gallade, Latios, Choice Band Victini, and Golurk. Hidden Power Ice is an option over Shadow Ball to threaten Dragon- and Ground-types such as Garchomp, Dragonite, Landorus, and Gliscor. However, Shadow Ball is more useful over Hidden Power Ice due to other teammates being able to run it.</p> <p>Raikou's teammates love it taking care of threatening Pokemon such as Celebi and Mega Gallade. Rotom-W is a great defensive wall that can hinder physical attackers like Dragonite, Mega Swampert, Tyranitar, and Terrakion with Will-O-Wisp, OHKO Ground-types like Mamoswine and Nidoking with Hydro Pump, and safely bring Raikou in with Volt Switch. Zapdos is a great wall that can take care of Steel-types such as Excadrill and Ferrothorn with Heat Wave and get rid of troublesome entry hazards with Defog. Magnezone can trap Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Excadrill with Hidden Power Fire. Mega Manectric can check physical attackers like Heracross and Dragonite thanks to Intimidate and use Volt Switch to gain momentum for the team. Furthermore, its coverage in Flamethrower, Signal Beam, and Hidden Power Ice helps with Pokemon like Magnezone, Celebi, and Landorus. Thundurus is a special attacker that can greatly help in the Ground-type matchup, using Hidden Power Ice and Grass Knot to take care of Pokemon like Garchomp, Gastrodon, and Mamoswine. Grass Knot is also useful to get rid of Swampert in the Water-type matchup, and Thundurus can use Prankster Thunder Wave to help slow down Pokemon that Raikou cannot outpace like Weavile and Choice Scarf Terrakion.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With a plethora of coverage moves and a great Attack stat, Entei is easily one of the best Fire-type wallbreakers. To complement its Attack, Entei gets Sacred Fire, which has a 50% chance to burn the foe. Thanks to its base 100 Speed, Entei can outspeed Pokemon such as Hoopa-U, Diggersby, Nidoking, and Heracross. However, Entei can not utilize it to its full extent, as it is forced to run an Adamant nature when using Extreme Speed; this prevents Entei from Speed tying with other base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Kyurem-B, Landorus-T, and Excadrill. Entei makes up for this with its decent bulk, which lets it take non-super effective hits easily. Nevertheless, even with its great offensive stats, Entei is walled by a lot of physically bulky Pokemon. Entei is also weak to Stealth Rock, which can wear it down pretty quickly, and it has no form of recovery, which cripples its longevity even more. Furthermore, it provides no defensive synergy for its team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Entei can run Assault Vest as its item to take special hits easier, but it will be severely less powerful. Flare Blitz can be used over Iron Head or Stone Edge, but if it's used with Life Orb, the combined recoil will wear Entei down very easily. Bulldoze can be used over Stone Edge or Iron Head to hit Pokemon such as Heatran.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Garchomp</strong>: Garchomp can come into Entei's attacks and KO back with an Earthquake, although it fears getting burned by Sacred Fire.</p> <p><strong>Mega Latias</strong>: Mega Latias completely walls Entei and can stall out Sacred Fire and set up with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Physically bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Swampert, Slowbro, and Suicune can all easily take Entei's attacks and stall it out.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon can shrug off a Sacred Fire from Entei and KO it.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Physically defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Porygon2, and Jellicent can wall Entei, though burns can annoy them.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: As Entei cannot run a Speed-boosting nature, it is outpaced and revenge killed by many faster Pokemon such as Terrakion, Manaphy, and Landorus-T.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Entry hazard damage, Life Orb recoil, and poison can easily wear Entei down.</p>",

      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sacred Fire has a good chance to burn the foe, which is advantageous in lieu of Flare Blitz. Extreme Speed has priority over other moves, which is helpful for revenge killing weaker foes. Stone Edge lets Entei hit Flying-type Pokemon such as Dragonite, Zapdos, and Mega Charizard Y super effectively. Iron Head is used to beat Fairy-type Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and Clefable and Rock-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Omastar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack EVs with an Adamant nature let Entei hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed EVs are used to outspeed base 85 Speed Pokemon such as Nidoking and Heracross, as well as Speed tie with other neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon. Life Orb can be used to deal heavy damage while allowing Entei to switch moves, although Entei then takes slight damage after every attacking move. Choice Band can be used as an alternative to Life Orb to OHKO bulkier Pokemon such as Diggersby and 2HKO Porygon2 after Stealth Rock at the cost of Entei losing the ability to switch moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As Entei has both good coverage moves and a STAB attack that can wear down Pokemon quickly through a burn, it can be sent out at any given time. It can be used early-game to wallbreak and burn its checks for late-game. Entei's access to Extreme Speed means it can also be used as a late-game sweeper. Although Entei's decent bulk allows it to easily shrug off most non-super effective hits, it should avoid taking unnecessary damage, as it does not have a reliable form of recovery. Furthermore, Entei can easily get worn down through entry hazard damage, Life Orb recoil, and other forms of chip damage. It should be careful of being hit by status, as poison can make it difficult for Entei to wallbreak and will wear it down very fast. As Sacred Fire has a good chance to burn, it is pretty easy to spam, but one should be aware of its limited PP. Entei is especially good against Flying-type teams due to having access to Stone Edge in conjunction with Sacred Fire's chance to burn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entei and Mega Charizard Y are good partners for each other, as Entei can wear down bulky specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, while Mega Charizard Y can take down bulky Water- and Ground-type Pokemon that usually wall Entei. Mega Charizard Y also sets up sun for Entei, which allows it to almost always OHKO Clefable with a Choice Band-boosted Sacred Fire and take Water-type attacks better. Mega Charizard Y can also run Defog to get rid of entry hazards for Entei, which, in conjunction with Life Orb recoil, can easily wear down Entei. Torkoal is a very reliable Rapid Spin user with the ability to set up its own Stealth Rock. Darmanitan and Entei work well together, as Darmanitan can wear down Pokemon easily, allowing Entei to KO them with Extreme Speed. Darmanitan can also pivot with U-turn to find opportunities to bring Entei in. Volcarona appreciates Entei's wallbreaking capability, as it can set up a sweep late-game. Infernape and Entei work well together, as Infernape can run Earthquake or Stone Edge, allowing Entei to use another move in place of Stone Edge or Bulldoze. Rotom-H is a good teammate, as it checks physically defensive Water-type Pokemon that Entei cannot defeat, such as Suicune and Slowbro. Rotom-H can also pivot with Volt Switch and find opportunities for Entei to switch in.</p>"

  "Torkoal": {
    "overview": "<p>With its amazing Defense, Torkoal easily tanks most physical attacks and is one of the few bulky Fire-type Pokemon. This makes it a very reliable entry hazard remover with Rapid Spin. To complement Torkoal's defensive stats, it cannot be struck with critical hits thanks to Shell Armor. Although it is used to clear away entry hazards, it can also set up its own Stealth Rock to deal chip damage to opposing foes. Torkoal can stop potential sweepers, as it has access to Yawn and Lava Plume, which induce sleep and have a chance to burn the opposing foe, respectively. However, even though Torkoal is a defensive Pokemon, it has no recovery outside of Leftovers, which severely reduces its longevity. Torkoal also has a relatively subpar Special Defense stat, which makes its vulnerable to special attacks. Due to its extremely low Speed stat, it is often Taunt bait or is prevented from clearing entry hazards when it is against a foe that can KO it. Torkoal is also often pressurized to come in on Stealth Rock to clear it away, which can wear it down easily.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Torkoal can use Air Balloon over Leftovers for a temporary Ground immunity, although Torkoal misses out on its only form of recovery. Toxic can be used over Yawn to induce poison. Clear Smog can also be used against potential sweepers to stop them from boosting. Mental Herb is an option to get up Stealth Rock against anti-leads.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such Rotom-W, Starmie, and Slowbro in general give Torkoal a hard time, as most Water-type moves are special and can OHKO Torkoal.</p> <p><strong>Sweepers with Substitute</strong>: Sweepers that pack Substitute such as Dragon Dance Gyarados can easily set one up on Torkoal and start boosting their stats.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers such as Latios and Landorus can easily come in on Torkoal and can OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Heatran can easily come into any of Torkoal's attacks due to its ability Flash Fire and Taunt or even just KO it with Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status effects cripple Torkoal's ability to clear entry hazards or set up its own. Poison deals residual damage at the end of every turn, while sleep and paralysis can hinder it massively.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types such as Latios, Kyurem-B, Garchomp, and Hydreigon can all face Torkoal one-on-one and KO it without much effort. The sheer power of these Pokemon also pressure it when clearing out entry hazards or setting up its own.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: The majority of Rock-types such as Mega Diancie, Terrakion, and Tyranitar can take on Torkoal, although they fear getting burned.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock deals residual damage every time a Pokemon comes into the battle. Rapid Spin clears away opposing entry hazards, most notably Stealth Rock, which most Fire-types get crippled by every time they come onto the field. Yawn is a great support move that induces sleep after two turns to stop potential sweepers or force a switch. This works particularly well with Stealth Rock on the field. Lava Plume is Torkoal's STAB and only attacking move. It is better than other Fire-type moves due to it having a higher chance to burn the opposing Pokemon. Will-O-Wisp can be used over this to ensure a burn on the foe.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>As Torkoal is a physically defensive Pokemon, maximum Defense and HP investment with a Bold nature allows it to be as bulky as it can be. Shell Armor makes it completely immune to critical hits. Leftovers allows it to have some form of recovery, as it heals a small amount of its health at the end of every turn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Torkoal can be sent out on turn one as a lead to set up Stealth Rock and start pressuring the opposing team, but this isn't advised as it generally loses to anti-leads. As its Special Defense stat isn't that great, it usually shouldn't be kept in against special attacking Pokemon. If entry hazards are set by the foe, Torkoal should be sent out as soon as possible to get rid of them with Rapid Spin, even if it means letting Torkoal faint. Torkoal should avoid getting hit with any type of status-inflicting move, as Torkoal's longevity gets severely crippled if it is affected by status effects while also preventing it from clearing entry hazards. Lava Plume or Yawn should be used if the foe starts to set up with a stat-boosting move, as the moves can burn or induce sleep respectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Most Fire-types appreciate Torkoal's ability to remove entry hazards, and in particular, Stealth Rock. Heatran forms a good defensive core with Torkoal, as it takes neutral damage from Rock-type moves while also being a good specially defensive wall that Torkoal can fall back on. Heatran also appreciates not needing to run Stealth Rock, so it can run more useful sets. Infernape too can run an additional coverage move, as it does not have to run Stealth Rock. Mega Charizard Y is another good partner, as it appreciates Torkoal removing Stealth Rock while Mega Charizard Y is immune to Ground-type moves that Torkoal has trouble fighting against. Mega Charizard Y helps tremendously against Water, as it can set up sun while also dealing damage with Solar Beam. In addition to Solar Beam, the sun makes it much easier for Torkoal to get off a critical Rapid Spin in the matchup. Rotom-H can set up Light Screen and Reflect to further improve the bulk of Torkoal and its teammates while also using Volt Switch to create opportunities for Torkoal to clear away hazards. It also provides a Ground immunity, a resistance to Flying, and a way to offensively check Water-types. Like Rotom-H, Darmanitan also creates opportunities for Torkoal to safely come in and use Rapid Spin. Volcanion provides an immunity to Water while dealing heavy damage to opposing walls that Torkoal struggles against.</p>"

Because of its outstanding Special Attack, serviceable Speed tier, and Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice, Mega Gardevoir also has a remarkable offensive presence that shines against Dark and Dragon teams. Mega Gardevoir's part-Fairy typing makes it immune to Dragon and neutral to Dark and Bug, allowing it to better take on Dragonite, Mega Sharpedo, and Heracross. However, it has low HP for a Wish user, and even with investment, Mega Gardevoir is still unable to deal with faster physical wallbreakers. It also competes with Mega Latias and Mega Gallade for a slot. Mega Latias can switch into special wallbreakers like Landorus, and Mega Charizard Y, while Mega Gallade poses a major threat to Normal, Steel, and Psychic teams with its STAB Fighting-type coverage and Knock Off + Shadow Sneak.</p> <h3>Fairy</h3> <p>Gardevoir is a great revenge killer on Fairy teams because of its high Special Attack, Psychic-type STAB moves to deal with Poison-types, and support options in Healing Wish and Trick. Trace allows Gardevoir to check weather sweepers like Swift Swim Kingdra and Sand Rush Excadrill. However, due to its lackluster Speed for a revenge killer, faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf Terrakion and Choice Scarf Victini can outspeed and OHKO it. Its poor Defense leaves it vulnerable to any physical attack. Despite its high Special Attack, Gardevoir has a hard time getting rid of specially defensive Pokemon like Chansey and Jirachi.</p>",

Energy Ball can be used to KO Water / Ground Pokemon like Mega Swampert and Gastrodon. Shadow Ball is an option to hit Psychic-types such as Jirachi and Victini.

It also allows Magnezone to disrupt the popular Flying-type core of Skarmory + Zapdos, easing the matchup for Steel-type teams. Despite the offensive capabilities it offers, Magnezone's Electric / Steel typing isn't that remarkable defensively, as it makes it very weak to Ground-type attacks. Magnezone lacks a good movepool and has very bad coverage aside from its STAB moves and Hidden Power Ice, making it easier to predict and threaten out. Magnezone's poor Speed stat and its reliance on Choice Scarf make it vulnerable to being revenge killed, and any Pokemon with a base 115 Speed stat or higher can outspeed it.</p> <h3>Electric</h3> <p>Magnezone is an excellent choice for Electric teams thanks to Magnet Pull, which allows it to threaten troublesome Steel-types, namely Excadrill. Magnezone's decent bulk and Steel typing provide key resistances to Fairy- and Dragon-type attacks from Mega Gardevoir and Latios. However, its Steel typing also amplifies its weakness to Ground-type attacks while also adding weaknesses to Fighting- and Fire-type attacks. Magnezone's extremely poor coverage options leave it overly reliant on Hidden Power Fire to deal with targets it traps. Furthermore, Magnezone's below-average Speed tier makes it more susceptible to being revenge killed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Steel</h4> <p>Sturdy allows Magnezone to survive a powerful attack at full health; however, entry hazards are common in the metagame and Magnezone won't appreciate taking any damage while they're on its side of the field. Sturdy Magnezone needs to be wary of opposing Pokemon that carry priority moves, which would nullify its ability, such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Gallade, Bisharp, Breloom, and Dragonite. Also, if Sturdy is used, Magnezone will be unable to trap Steel-types, which makes matchups difficult for its teammates. Choice Specs with a Modest nature maximizes Magnezone's damage output. Unfortunately, Magnezone loses out on the extra Speed that Choice Scarf and a Timid nature offers, making it susceptible to being revenge killed. Hidden Power Grass is mainly for hitting Ground-types harder such as Gastrodon, Seismitoad, and Mega Swampert; however, Ferrothorn is a more reliable check and helps open up an extra move slot for Magnezone to utilize. Magnezone can run Hidden Power Fire over Hidden Power Ice to trap certain Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, dealing significant damage to the former and OHKOing the latter after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Electric</h4> <p>Magnezone has no other viable options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Steel</h4> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Several Choice Scarf-using Fighting-types outspeed Magnezone, and many of them such as Heracross, Terrakion, and Infernape can KO it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Magnezone has a huge weakness to Ground-types, and they're immune to its Volt Switch and Thunderbolt. Excadrill, Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Swampert have nothing to fear from any of Magnezone's attacks. However, Gastrodon, and Swampert should be wary of a possible Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types resist Magnezone's Flash Cannon, and most of them aren't KOed by its Electric-type attacks. Choice Scarf Darmanitan and Victini can easily eliminate Magnezone, Entei and Infernape can retaliate with Sacred Fire and Close Combat, and specially defensive Heatran can shrug off its attacks and KO it back with Lava Plume.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Because of its less-than-average Speed stat, Magnezone becomes a prime target for other Choice Scarf users such as Kyurem-B, Victini and Landorus-T and faster Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types resist Magnezone's STAB attacks and take little damage from Hidden Power Ice, barring Zapdos and Thundurus. Pokemon that carry coverage moves such as Mega Manectric, Mega Ampharos, Zapdos, Thundurus, and Electivire can hit Magnezone super effectively. For example, Mega Ampharos and Mega Manectric can OHKO Magnezone with Focus Blast and Overheat, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Magnezone has difficulty breaking through special walls such as Zapdos, Chansey, and Mew. Zapdos can use Heat Wave repeatedly while recovering its health with Roost, Chansey can tank several attacks and replenish its health with Soft-Boiled while using Seismic Toss, and Mew can remove Magnezone's item with Knock Off and stall with Soft-Boiled while burning it with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h4>Electric</h4> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Specially defensive walls like Chansey and Gastrodon shrug off all of Magnezone's attacks with ease and threaten to KO it in return.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Pokemon such as Alakazam, Hydreigon, Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Dragonite have little to no trouble disposing Magnezone with their coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Victini, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard Y threaten Magnezone with their super effective STAB moves. Volcarona, in particular, can use Magnezone as setup fodder to boost with Quiver Dance.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: While Magnezone has temporary immunity to Ground-type attacks, it is easily OHKOed by foes like Hippowdon and Landorus once Air Balloon is popped.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types like Terrakion and Heracross handle Magnezone with their super effective STAB moves. However, Terrakion needs to be wary of switching into Magnezone.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch allows Magnezone to pivot and gain momentum for its teammates while escaping foes that it can't defeat such as Mega Venusaur and Chansey. It can help wear down checks such as Heatran and increase Magnezone's chances to potentially clean opposing teams late-game. Flash Cannon is another STAB attack used to hit Fairy-, Ice-, and Rock-types such as Mega Diancie, Kyurem-B, and Mamoswine. Thunderbolt is a secondary Electric STAB move that provides greater power to OHKO Mega Charizard Y. Hidden Power Ice targets Dragon- and Ground-types such as Garchomp and Landorus.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature lets Magnezone hit 240 Speed, and with a Choice Scarf equipped, it can function as a revenge killer and outpace key Pokemon such as Gengar, Mega Diancie, and Thundurus. 252 Special Attack EVs boost Magnezone's damage output. Magnet Pull is mandatory on Magnezone in order to trap other Steel-types that try to switch out such as Cobalion and Mega Scizor, especially trapping opposing Skarmory, which is important to eliminate because most Steel-types have trouble against it due to its physical bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This particular set is best used for Magnezone to gain momentum and act as a pivot with Volt Switch to escape any match up that's unfavorable to it. However, Magnezone should be careful when using Volt Switch against a team that has an Electric-immune Pokemon such as Swampert on Water-type teams or Landorus-T on Flying-type teams, as Magnezone and its team will lose a lot of momentum if Volt Switch is blocked. Magnezone can be used as a lead, as it can pivot out with Volt Switch into a better teammate that can eliminate any opposing Pokemon that Magnezone has trouble defeating. With Choice Scarf, Magnezone can function as a revenge killer against Pokemon such as Landorus and Mega Diancie. It's best to have entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field to let Magnezone pressure its foes with Volt Switch, constantly wearing them down for it and its teammates to KO. Make sure to utilize Magnet Pull to your advantage by trapping other utility Steel-types that set up entry hazards or support such as Skarmory, Cobalion, and Klefki. Although Magnezone takes little damage from Stealth Rock, Spikes can wear it down much quicker, as it pivots in and out continuously, so it's best to keep entry hazards off your side of the field.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Excadrill can check Fire-types, threatening Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona with Rock Slide while its STAB Earthquake can break through Rotom-H and Entei, and take on Electric-types that wall Magnezone such as Zapdos and Rotom-W. Excadrill also has access to Rapid Spin, which gives Magnezone more freedom to pivot with Volt Switch. Magnezone appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Heatran, all of which can set up Stealth Rock while the former two both can set up Spikes as well, allowing Magnezone to KO its foes more easily and pressure teams with Volt Switch. Skarmory can utilize its physical bulk to switch into physical attackers such as Heracross, and thanks to its Flying typing, it can switch into Ground-type attacks for Magnezone. Thanks to its Grass typing, Ferrothorn can take on Water-types to alleviate pressure placed on Magnezone, switch into Ground-types that threaten it, and take on Swampert, Gastrodon, and Seismitoad. Heatran makes for an efficient partner because of its Flash Fire ability, as it can utilize Magnezone's Fire-type weakness to its advantage in getting a free switch, tank special attacks, and make use of a stallbreaker set featuring Taunt to take on Chansey and Mew, both of which Magnezone has no chance of defeating.</p> <p>Bisharp can take on Ghost- and Psychic-types that can defeat Magnezone such as Gengar, Chandelure, and Mew. Mega Scizor can dent special walls such as Chansey and KO Pokemon such as Kyurem-B, Terrakion, and Breloom with its powerful Bullet Punch. Bisharp and Mega Scizor both have access to Knock Off to remove Leftovers and Eviolite from item-reliant Pokemon such as Jirachi, Chansey, and Porygon2. With Eviolite removed, Porygon2 is put into range of a possible 2HKO from Thunderbolt after Stealth Rock damage. Bisharp and Mega Scizor both appreciate Magnezone's ability to trap and remove Skarmory, which would otherwise wall these three.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Flash Cannon deals significant damage to Fairy-, Ice-, and Rock-types such as Clefable, Weavile, and Tyranitar. Hidden Power Fire synergizes extremely well with Magnet Pull, allowing Magnezone to reliably take care of Steel-types it traps like Ferrothorn and Excadrill. Substitute takes advantage of passive Steel-types that fail to do anything significant to Magnezone, such as Klefki, Ferrothorn, and Choice-locked Excadrill. Air Balloon provides a temporary immunity to Ground-type attacks and allows Magnezone to reliably switch in and trap Choice item Excadrill. It's important to play safely with Magnezone, as preserving Air Balloon in the Ground- and Steel-type matchups and dealing with Excadrill is its most important use. The given Speed EVs allow Magnezone to outspeed uninvested Mega Scizor.</p> <p>Electric teams appreciate Magnezone's ability to reliably deal with troublesome Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Excadrill. Zapdos provides a much needed, reliable Ground immunity for Magnezone, in case Air Balloon has been popped. In return, Zapdos appreciates Magnezone's ability to switch into Rock- and Ice-type attacks from the likes of Weavile and Tyranitar. Rotom-W provides a Fire-resistant and secondary Ground-immune partner for Magnezone while also being able to KO Ground-types like Mamoswine with Hydro Pump. Thundurus greatly helps in matchups such as Flying, Water, and Ground thanks to Thunderbolt + Grass Knot + Hidden Power Ice and is able to significantly cripple faster threats to Magnezone with Thunder Wave. Mega Manectric further improves the Steel-type matchup thanks to Flamethrower and also takes care of Ground-types like Gliscor and Garchomp with Hidden Power Ice. Raikou aids greatly in the Psychic matchup thanks to Calm Mind and Shadow Ball.</p>"

  "Gallade": {
    "overview": "<h3>Psychic</h3> <p>Mega Gallade is the premier option for a setup sweeper on Psychic teams. Its part-Fighting typing grants it a coveted neutrality to Dark-type attacks, which it can take advantage of with its base ability Justified. Mega Gallade's monstrous Attack stat combined with its Fighting-type STAB move lets it wallbreak commonly annoying walls for Psychic teams, such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, Chansey, and Tyranitar. Its great Speed tier and priority in Shadow Sneak make it harder to revenge kill and let it easily run through opposing teams. All of these benefits come at the opportunity cost of not being able to use other Mega Evolutions, such as Mega Gardevoir and Mega Latias. Mega Gardevoir is an even better check to Dark-types that can also pass Wish, while Mega Latias is a Ground-immune defensive pivot and Defogger that can check Flying-types. Additionally, in its base forme, Gallade's Speed is poor, making it harder to find opportunities to safely Mega Evolve. Mega Gallade's lackluster Defense can also be exploited by priority users and faster revenge killers that take little from Shadow Sneak like Dragonite and Choice Scarf Landorus-T.</p> <h3>Fighting</h3> <p>With its great offensive typing, Attack, and Speed, Mega Gallade features as the best Swords Dance sweeper for Fighting teams. With access to STAB moves such as Drain Punch and Close Combat, Mega Gallade can double as either a sweeper or a wallbreaker depending on its team's needs. Its access to Psychic-type STAB attacks makes it a fantastic check to Mega Venusaur, a big threat due to its bulk. In addition, Mega Gallade is one of the few viable Knock Off users and can run priority moves to take on faster foes, and its passable bulk can allow it to find more opportunities to set up, such as against special attackers such as Meloetta and Landorus. With Inner Focus, Mega Gallade is a soft check to the likes of Choice Scarf Jirachi and Choice Scarf Togekiss, which otherwise might try to make its teammates flinch. Mega Gallade does suffer from four-moveslot syndrome, though, as it can find itself easily revenge killed, whittled down, or lacking in power depending on its choices. Furthermore, most Pokemon like Slowbro and Doublade that check Fighting-types also easily check Mega Gallade. While Mega Gallade's Speed is quite good, regular Gallade has rather poor Speed and has a hard time finding safe opportunities to Mega Evolve. It notably faces serious competition for the Mega slot from Mega Medicham, the most powerful wallbreaker for Fighting, although Mega Gallade's ability to compress many offensive roles, especially its ability to sweep Psychic teams with Knock Off, gives it a spot on many teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Psychic</h4> <p>Zen Headbutt lets Mega Gallade hit Pokemon that resist or take little from its coverage moves, like Mega Venusaur and Gyarados before it Mega Evolves, hard. A bulkier EV spread can be used, particularly with Substitute, in order to be able to set up on weaker Pokemon more easily and take a hit from Pokemon like Mega Sharpedo better. Bulk Up may also be run on more defensively-oriented spreads. However, it will take more boosts before Mega Gallade is able to steamroll through a team.</p> <h4>Fighting</h4> <p>A Bulk Up sweeper set can be used but is generally inferior to Swords Dance due to the lower Attack boost. With access to status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and other support options such as dual screens and Knock Off, Mega Gallade can take on a more supportive role for its team if desired, although it should usually be sweeper instead, as Fighting teams can rarely take full advantage of its supportive assistance.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Psychic</h4> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Even with Shadow Sneak, many faster Pokemon, like Choice Scarf Victini and Tornadus-T, and priority users that can take advantage of Mega Gallade's below average Defense, like Dragonite and Mega Scizor, can revenge kill Mega Gallade.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Paralysis makes Mega Gallade overly reliant on a weak Shadow Sneak, while burn completely diminishes its offensive presence.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fighting-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that resist Mega Gallade's Fighting-type STAB move while taking little damage from Knock Off and Shadow Sneak, like Clefable, Mega Venusaur, and Mega Heracross, are able to switch into and KO Mega Gallade. They do need to be wary of the very rare Zen Headbutt, however.</p> <h4>Fighting</h4> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Mega Gallade may have access to Shadow Sneak, but its low Base Power combined with Mega Gallade's poor physical bulk leaves Mega Gallade vulnerable to fast revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Kyurem-B and Choice Scarf Victini that can come in to threaten Mega Gallade out.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Although they do need to be careful of taking boosted Psychic-type STAB attacks, most Fairy-type Pokemon can take one hit and OHKO Mega Gallade back with their own STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Paralysis and burns can instantly shut down Mega Gallade and any attempt at sweeping by quartering or halving one of its stats.</p> <p><strong>Ditto</strong>: A Ditto that copies a +2 Mega Gallade can be devastating, as thanks to its Choice Scarf, it becomes almost impossible to revenge kill and can take advantage of Mega Gallade's incredible power and Psychic-type STAB attacks to sweep most Fighting teams.</p>",

      "Swords Dance (Psychic)": {
        "description": "<p>Mega Gallade can leverage its terrifying offensive presence to force switches and safely set up with Swords Dance. Close Combat is Mega Gallade's strongest and most spammable STAB move, allowing it to check Dark- and Steel-types. Drain Punch is an alternative option that provides Mega Gallade a form of recovery at the cost of not being able to outright OHKO certain Pokemon like Ferrothorn. Shadow Sneak is a great priority move that prevents boosted Mega Gallade from being revenge killed by Pokemon like Choice Scarf Victini, Gengar, and Latios. Knock Off gives Mega Gallade a stronger way to hit Psychic-types and is great utility in general. With Knock Off and Shadow Sneak, Mega Gallade is equipped with the tools to dismantle opposing Psychic and Ghost teams with ease. Substitute is an option over Knock Off that lets Mega Gallade take advantage of its forced switches and weaker defensive Pokemon, like Porygon2, to set up safely. It also gives Mega Gallade a way to play around a boosted Bisharp's Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Victini forms a fantastic Steel-breaking core with Mega Gallade. It can also beat faster threats like Tornadus-T with Choice Scarf and safely bring Mega Gallade in with U-turn. Latios and Latias are Ground-immune Defoggers that can pivot into threats like Landorus and Mega Charizard Y. Choice Specs Latios can wallbreak alongside Mega Gallade, while Choice Scarf Latias can support it with Healing Wish. Jirachi and Celebi can set Stealth Rock, making it easier for Mega Gallade to clean up with Shadow Sneak. Jirachi can also paralyze faster threats like Tornadus-T and Swift Swim Kingdra with Thunder Wave, while Celebi can take on Water-types like Slowbro more easily. Colbur Berry users like Celebi, Reuniclus, and Slowbro are able to take on Mega Sharpedo and Mega Gyarados, which can be huge threats to Mega Gallade when boosted. Stallbreaker Mew beats the few defensive answers to Mega Gallade, like Mega Venusaur and Mandibuzz. Deoxys-S makes a great teammate to Mega Gallade, as it can almost singlehandedly take on Flying teams that Mega Gallade generally struggles against. In return, Deoxys-S appreciates Mega Gallade's wallbreaking abilities in other matchups, like Steel and Dark, as it can clean up late-game more easily.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance (Fighting)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Mega Gallade's Attack to allow it to sweep easily. Close Combat is the strongest and most reliable attack Mega Gallade has and can be used to break walls. Drain Punch is an alternative for improved sweeping potential because of the lack of Defense and Special Defense drops and the healing it provides. Zen Headbutt is the preferred Psychic-type STAB attack because it guarantees several KOs, most importantly against Mega Venusaur at +2, and can neutrally hit Fairy-type Pokemon. Knock Off gives Mega Gallade a way to hit Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon for great damage. After a Swords Dance, Knock Off can OHKO Slowbro after Stealth Rock damage and Mew. Shadow Sneak can be used instead of Knock Off to hit faster threats such as Choice Scarf Gengar and Choice Scarf Victini, but it is far weaker than Knock Off and lacks the general utility that it would bring. As a final alternative, Ice Punch can be used to lure in and KO Flying- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Dragonite, Landorus, and Garchomp, but Mega Gallade will be utterly walled by Psychic-types in exchange.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EV investment and a Jolly nature allow Mega Gallade to take full advantage of its base 110 Speed to outspeed the likes of Terrakion and, at worst, Speed tie with Latios. Investing 252 Attack EVs maximizes Mega Gallade's damage output, helping it sweep and wallbreak. Gallade's ability should be Justified on the very unlikely chance that somehow it gets hit by a Dark-type move on a switch in before it Mega Evolves to get an Attack boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Gallade should use Swords Dance to set up and sweep but can also use it to become a powerful wallbreaker. For example, a +2 Close Combat has a chance to OHKO Skarmory after Stealth Rock damage, making it risky for Skarmory to switch in. Similarly, a +2 Zen Headbutt OHKOes Mega Venusaur. Depending on whether Close Combat or Drain Punch is used, Mega Gallade can choose to either assist in wallbreaking or dedicate itself to sweeping. Mega Gallade using Close Combat should take advantage of its sheer strength and use it to chip away and weaken its checks so that it can sweep late-game. Mega Gallade does have passable bulk, but if Drain Punch isn't used, it's not recommended to switch into even any unresisted move to maximize its chances to sweep. Mega Gallade must avoid status at all costs, as a crippling burn or paralysis could end any hopes of sweeping. Toxic poison will also slowly wear down Mega Gallade that don't pack Drain Punch. Generally, Mega Gallade should wait until its checks have been worn down or taken out before going for the late-game sweep. While Shadow Sneak lacks power, it can still be used to revenge kill weakened threats. If using Knock Off, Mega Gallade should aim to Knock Off the items of its checks as early as possible to make a sweep much easier to pull off later on. Thanks to its Inner Focus ability, Mega Gallade cannot flinch, allowing it to choose to set up Swords Dance against Choice Scarf Jirachi, as Iron Head fails to 2HKO, and Drain Punch will easily heal back most of the lost health. It also prevents Choice Scarf Togekiss from stopping a +2 Mega Gallade's sweep, as Mega Gallade can survive one Air Slash to Knock Off its Choice Scarf.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock support is critical for many KOs. Many walls including Mandibuzz, Mega Venusaur, and Slowbro can be taken out by the appropriate move after the chip damage. Infernape is a phenomenal teammate for setting up the entry hazard while also handling Steel-type foes. It can easily break past the likes of Skarmory and Doublade for Mega Gallade. Cobalion is a great help as well thanks to its Stealth Rock support. It can also spread paralysis with Thunder Wave, bring Mega Gallade in with Volt Switch, and handle Fairy-types with its STAB Iron Head. Choice Scarf Guts Heracross is a great teammate for being able to soak up status for Mega Gallade while also revenge killing faster threats to help set the stage for Mega Gallade's late-game sweep. In the same vein, Choice Scarf Terrakion is especially good for its ability to threaten other Choice Scarf users. Choice Scarf Victini, in particular, is easily revenge killed by Terrakion, helping Mega Gallade that lack Shadow Sneak beat Psychic teams. Terrakion also threatens out most Flying-type foes and appreciates Close Combat Mega Gallade's ability to weaken or outright KO Skarmory. Another setup sweeper can be a great teammate for Mega Gallade. Hawlucha and Swords Dance Lucario share many checks with Mega Gallade, wearing down these shared checks over the course of a battle so that Mega Gallade can more easily sweep. Nasty Plot Lucario can also be used because they and Mega Gallade set up on one another's checks quite nicely. Breloom can be useful for its Spore support, giving Mega Gallade free turns to set up, and its Bullet Seed, which can KO Slowbro with ease.</p>"

  "Heatran": {
    "overview": "<h3>Steel</h3> <p>Heatran is one of, if not the, best Pokemon on Steel-type teams due to its unbelievable versatility, being able to run an offensive, defensive, or trapper set well, and its ability to check Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and opposing Heatran with its Flash Fire ability while gaining a power boost off their attacks. Due to its base 130 Special Attack, Heatran can be an effective special attacker, something Steel-type teams generally lack. Its Fire / Steel typing allows it to check a plethora of foes, such as Zapdos, Skarmory, and Mew, while giving it key resistances to Flying-, Psychic-, Steel-, and Bug-type moves; it also prevents it from being crippled by burn or poison, although it can still be hit with sleep or paralysis. Heatran can also support and defend quite well with its 91 / 106 / 106 bulk, being able to set entry hazards with Stealth Rock and spread burns or poison with Lava Plume and Toxic.</p> <p>Unfortunately, many of the Fire-types Heatran is supposed to check often carry coverage or even STAB moves that hit it super effectively, such as Focus Blast on Mega Charizard Y, Close Combat on Infernape, Steam Eruption on Volcanion, and Earth Power on other Heatran. Furthermore, its mediocre base Speed of 77 leaves it outsped by threats such as Mega Gallade, Mega Medicham, and Infernape. A lack of reliable recovery is another huge detriment to Heatran, since its team will want it to be around for as long as possible to absorb Fire-type moves. Heatran's typing also is a double-edged sword, coming with weaknesses to Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-types, all of which are quite common and hard for Steel-type teams to reliably check. Despite these flaws, however, Heatran remains one of the most solid picks for Steel-type teams, being able to check Fire-types, trap walls, break holes in the opponent's team with powerful special attacks, and, with its defensive set, provide fantastic utility.</p> <h3>Fire</h3> <p>Heatran's neutrality to Rock and resistance to Psychic and Dragons thanks to its part-Steel typing allows it to better take on Pokemon like Aerodactyl, Latios, and Dragonite. With Magma Storm + Taunt, Heatran can trap and stallbreak bulky Pokemon such as Porygon2, Latios, and Chansey. Taunt also allows Heatran to deter slower Stealth Rock setters like Clefable and Cradily, which is essential for Fire teams. While Heatran's Speed lets it outpace slower threats such as Adamant variants of Excadrill, Diggersby, and Dragonite, it leaves it vulnerable to faster threats such as Nidoking, Manaphy, and Kyurem-B.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Steel</h4> <p>Defensive Heatran can utilize Protect to stall for Leftovers recovery or Roar to rack up entry hazard damage, but Earth Power is necessary so that Heatran can super effectively damage Fire-types it is supposed to check, and Stone Edge is need for Heatran to be able to KO Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona. Heatran could run a Choice Scarf set to outspeed Mega Charizard Y or a Choice Specs set to serve as a wallbreaker, but this prevents it from fulfilling its role of trapper or pivot, so it is usually subpar. Heatran could use Flash Cannon on the offensive set in the fourth slot, but its coverage is redundant with Heatran's other moves, with the only additional threats it hits being Fairy-types like Clefable and Mega Gardevoir.</p> <h4>Fire</h4> <p>Flash Cannon can be run over Hidden Power Ice to OHKO Mega Diancie and deal more damage to Rock-types like Terrakion and Tyranitar, but Heatran misses out on important coverage for Dragon- and Ground-types, so it generally isn't worth it. Stealth Rock can be run as well, either alongside Torkoal or Infernape, giving teams a secondary option for hazards. Toxic can also be used to put bulkier walls and sweepers such as Latios and Volcarona on a timer, but Heatran loses valuable coverage doing so. Choice Scarf can also be run with Fire Blast / Earth Power / Flash Cannon / Hidden Power Ice, providing a lure for Mega Diancie, but it faces competition from better Choice Scarf users such as Victini and Darmanitan.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Steel</h4> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Any Ground-type can easily KO Heatran with a STAB move after its Air Balloon has been popped. However, those with low Special Defense, such as Landorus, can be significantly damaged by Heatran's attacks as they switch in. Furthermore, physical Ground-types are crippled by Lava Plume's burn, and most Ground-types dislike Toxic, except for Gliscor, Excadrill, and Mega Steelix, although these cannot switch into Heatran's other moves.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Many Fighting-types, notably Heracross, and Terrakion, can easily KO Heatran with their STAB moves that hit on Heatran's weaker Defense stat while also outspeeding it. Furthermore, most Fighting-types can switch into Heatran easily, since they are not significantly damaged by Heatran's moves.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Although it is immune to poison and burns by virtue of its typing, paralysis cripples Heatran, making offensive Heatran and the dedicated trapper set useless and easily outsped and KOed. However, defensive Heatran does not mind paralysis as much, as it is not meant to outspeed opposing Pokemon; however, it still despises the occasional full paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Many special walls such as Mew, Zapdos, and Clefable do not care about Heatran's moves, recovering any negligible damage dealt, and can do whatever they want in return. However, Heatran beats most of these with Magma Storm + Taunt + Toxic. Furthermore, even if it is not running the dedicated trapper set, Heatran can cripple them with Taunt. Since Heatran's disposal of them can take several turns, though, special walls can damage it in the meantime with attacks like Seismic Toss from Chansey and Discharge from Zapdos.</p> <h4>Fire</h4> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Heatran struggles to break through bulky Water-types such as Gastrodon, Suicune, Swampert, and Rotom-W, the latter of which can pivot out of Magma Storm damage.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Heatran needs to be wary of various Pokemon that run super effective coverage, such as Dragonite, Hydreigon, Gengar, and Mega Gardevoir</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny, Terrakion, and Landorus all outspeed Heatran and immediately force it out with the threat of a KO.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Lava Plume is Heatran's Fire-type STAB move of choice, securing many KOs that Steel-type teams need, including OHKOs on Bisharp, Excadrill (if Heatran has an Air Balloon), and Mega Heracross after damage from Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. It also has a useful 30% burn chance, crippling physical attackers and accumulating residual damage on bulky switch-ins such as Zapdos and Mew. Earth Power provides coverage to hit switch-ins that resist or are immune to Fire-type moves, such as opposing Heatran and Volcanion. A Rock-type coverage move in Stone Edge allows Heatran to OHKO Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona, both of which are massive threats to Steel-type teams. For Heatran's last move, Hidden Power Ice hits Pokemon weak to Ice-type moves as they switch in, such as Garchomp, Landorus, and Dragonite. Alternatively, Taunt allows Heatran to prevent special walls from recovering their HP, allowing it to beat them by chipping away at their health over time; it also stops foes from boosting, setting up hazards, and paralyzing Heatran, as well as prevent threats like Zapdos from removing entry hazards with Defog. Stealth Rock is useful because the chip damage it provides punishes switches and allows Heatran and its teammates to nab crucial KOs. Furthermore, Heatran will be able to set it easily during the match, because of the switches it forces. Fire Blast could be run over Lava Plume, but to do so means losing out on a high burn chance, and Lava Plume already gets many important KOs. However, Fire Blast can 2HKO specially defensive Zapdos after Stealth Rock, which helps keep hazards up if Heatran is not running Taunt.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>232 Special Attack EVs allow Heatran to hit as hard as possible, dealing massive amounts of damage to threats like opposing Heatran, Victini, Dragonite, and Garchomp with the appropriate moves, although Heatran cannot switch into many of these and is outsped by most of them. Maximum Speed investment boosted by a Timid nature gives Heatran a Speed stat of 278, which outpaces Adamant Excadrill, positive -natured base 70 Pokemon, and those Speed creeping that Speed tier, including Mew and Zapdos. 24 Attack EVs are used to guarantee an OHKO on Mega Charizard Y with Stone Edge. Flash Fire allows Heatran to fill its niche on Steel-type teams, absorbing Fire-type moves that KO all the other members of the team. It also boosts Heatran's own Fire-type moves, allowing it to hit much harder with Lava Plume. Air Balloon and Leftovers are the two best choices for an item. Air Balloon neutralizes Heatran's quadruple weakness to Ground-type moves but is unreliable and easily popped by any direct damage. Leftovers, on the other hand, can provide Heatran with residual recovery, which it otherwise lacks. 60 Special Defense EVs could be deducted from Special Attack to always survive Mega Charizard Y's Focus Blast. The reduction in damage output is slight, and Heatran can still OHKO Bisharp, Excadrill (if Heatran has an Air Balloon), and Mega Heracross after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Heatran should be used as an offensive pivot: switch it into a threat it walls, and then attack the predicted switch-in with the move that hits it the hardest or set Stealth Rock. Heatran will have many opportunities to switch in due to its fantastic defensive typing; for example, it can switch in with impunity against Latios, Mega Scizor, Togekiss, and Mew. An Air Balloon allows Heatran to check major Ground-type threats like Landorus, Garchomp, and Excadrill; however, it must be played conservatively, since the Air Balloon is popped easily. The best play against such attackers is usually to come in after a sack and force them to pop Heatran's Air Balloon with a resisted attack while Heatran strikes back with a super effective attack. Preserving the Air Balloon is crucial against certain matchups, most notably against Ground-type teams, as Heatran has to attack one of the opposing threats to even stand a chance. A Fire-type STAB move should be used in most cases, unless the foe resists it or is hit harder by another move. Lava Plume is easily spammed, especially against physical attackers, since the potential burn will cripple them for the rest of the match. However, if the foe resists Fire-type moves, use the appropriate coverage move to heavily damage or even KO it. Stone Edge is on the set solely to OHKO Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona, which none of Heatran's teammates can switch into. If Heatran elects to run Taunt, use it against bulky switch-ins such as Zapdos and Chansey; it cripples them by preventing recovery and also prevents the former from Defogging and the latter from setting Stealth Rock or paralyzing Heatran. Taunt also generates setup opportunities on Pokemon like Sableye and Will-O-Wisp Mew that rely on status moves to deter setup. Steel-type teams can capitalize on the free turn generated by the bulky threat's switch by setting Stealth Rock, nailing the predicted switch-in with the right move, safely pivoting to a teammate, or applying offensive pressure with a setup Pokemon. Keep entry hazards off the field for Heatran because it will be switching around often as an offensive pivot. Avoid paralysis, since it will make Heatran even more easily outsped and KOed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Heatran partners well with Pokemon weak to Fire-type moves such as Mega Scizor, Skarmory, Doublade, and Ferrothorn; these Pokemon usually resist or are immune to Heatran's weaknesses of Ground, Fighting, and Water. Mega Scizor can also check some Pokemon that are threats to Heatran; examples include Terrakion and Breloom, the first of which it can 2HKO with an unboosted Bullet Punch and the latter of which it can set up on with Swords Dance, assuming one has already sacked something to Spore. Skarmory, on the other hand, provides hazard control in addition to being immune to Ground-type moves. It can set both Stealth Rock and Spikes, which discourage switches and allow Heatran to get important KOs, such as a near-certain 2HKO on Zapdos with Fire Blast, an OHKO almost all of the time on Torkoal with Earth Power, and a guaranteed OHKO on Mega Heracross after Stealth Rock and Spikes. On more balanced builds, Skarmory can also Defog away opposing entry hazards, which prevents Heatran from being worn down by repeated switches, a huge problem due to Heatran's lack of recovery. While Skarmory is immune to Ground-type moves, Doublade is immune to Fighting-type moves. It also checks Pokemon that are massive threats to Heatran, including Mega Medicham and Terrakion. Ferrothorn and Empoleon resist Water-type moves, giving them a fantastic synergy with it. The former provides residual damage in Leech Seed and Iron Barbs, entry hazards in Stealth Rock and Spikes, and speed control in Thunder Wave, while the latter can set Stealth Rock for Heatran and remove entry hazards with Defog, if needed. Jirachi is a great partner to Heatran, since it can provide Heatran recovery with Wish or Healing Wish, check Water-types with an Assault Vest set, and revenge kill Fighting-types with a Choice Scarf set. Additionally, Excadrill synergizes well with Heatran, since it can outspeed and eliminate threats to Heatran, including Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, Heracross, and Choice Scarf Rotom-W. Magnezone is another effective partner being able to KO Water-types that give Heatran trouble with Thunderbolt. It can always OHKO Azumarill after Stealth Rock, always 2HKO Mega Gyarados while OHKOing its base forme, and almost always OHKO Slowbro after Stealth Rock. Additionally, Magnezone can absorb paralysis thanks to its Electric typing and can gain momentum for Heatran's team with Volt Switch.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive (Steel)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Lava Plume possesses a nasty burn chance, which is the main reason Heatran uses it, and it also does slight damage to the foe while preventing Heatran from being Taunt bait. Earth Power provides coverage with Lava Plume and allows even defensive Heatran to do damage to specific foes, such as other Heatran. Toxic is extremely helpful, putting walls and setup sweepers such as Chansey, Mew, and Volcarona on a timer, forcing them to switch out. Stealth Rock is used because the chip damage it provides punishes switches and allows Heatran and its teammates to get crucial KOs. However, if Heatran's team already has Stealth Rock support, Stone Edge should be used in the last slot, since specially defensive Heatran can take any attack from Mega Charizard Y or Volcarona once, even Focus Blast or Hidden Power Ground and then OHKO both of them with Stone Edge, which is very useful for Heatran's team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs and nature maximize Heatran's special bulk, allowing it to survive many powerful special hits to inflict the foe with status or set entry hazards. Notable special attacks it survives once are Mega Charizard Y's Focus Blast and Thundurus's Focus Blast. The Speed EVs allow Heatran to outspeed uninvested Rotom-W, in addition to outpacing all uninvested base 80s. Leftovers is crucial to Heatran's longevity, since it does not have reliable recovery. If Stone Edge is used, take 24 EVs from Special Defense and put them in Attack in order to OHKO Mega Charizard Y all of the time.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because of its fantastic special bulk, switch Heatran into special attackers such as Latios, Mega Pidgeot, and Yanmega and then set entry hazards, Toxic the foe, or deal damage and spread burns with Lava Plume. Also, switch Heatran into predicted Fire-type moves so that it will get a free switch in and a Flash Fire boost. Once Heatran has been switched in, set Stealth Rock immediately if it has not been set already, since it punishes switches and allows one to get key KOs. Heatran's next move depends on what the predicted switch-in will be. If the switch-in is weak to Fire- or Ground-type attacks, use the respective move, damaging it. Toxic should be used against bulky switch-ins like Zapdos and Porygon2, since it will cripple them. If one thinks a physical attacker will be switched in, however, it is best to use Lava Plume, possibly burning and crippling it or at least damaging it. Avoid Knock Off from Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Bisharp, since Heatran absolutely needs the passive recovery from Leftovers. Assuming Stone Edge was chosen, if the opponent has a Mega Charizard Y or Volcarona switched in against Heatran, OHKO them with Stone Edge no matter what. Do not hard switch Heatran in, though, since it needs to be at full health to check them. Due to a lack of investment in Special Attack, Heatran will not be doing a lot of damage with Earth Power, but it can still deal significant damage to predicted switch-ins with a Ground-type weakness, such as opposing Heatran and Victini. Preserve Heatran's health for as long as possible so that it can continue to switch into special attacks and absorb Fire-type moves for its team. Although it does not mind paralysis as much as offensive Heatran sets do, defensive Heatran still dislikes being outsped by basically everything.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Skarmory is one of the best partners to Heatran, as the two synergize well defensively. Skarmory can easily switch into Ground-type moves used against Heatran, while Heatran can switch in on Fire-type moves that target Skarmory. They also wall each other's checks, with Skarmory tanking physical attacks and Heatran tanking special ones. Furthermore, since both have access to phazing moves and entry hazards, they can free up moveslots for each other, allowing Skarmory to use Spikes or Heatran to use Stone Edge. Excadrill or Ferrothorn works well with this partnership, since they can switch into Electric-type moves Skarmory is weak to, preventing Heatran from taking unnecessary hits. Excadrill also provides entry hazard removal that does not remove Heatran's hazards, which is beneficial to Heatran, and it can check some threats to Heatran, such as Rotom-W and Mega Charizard Y. On the other hand, Ferrothorn makes for a good partner for with Heatran, having great defensive synergy with it. , being able to switch into switch into many Water-type moves, provide speed control with Thunder Wave, and spread residual damage with Iron Barbs + Leech Seed, which work well with Heatran spreading status to wear down foes. Additionally, Jirachi is a fantastic partner for defensive Heatran. Its Choice Scarf set can take on Fighting-types with STAB Heart Stamp or Zen Headbutt; it can heal Heatran with Healing Wish or Wish; and its Assault Vest set can tank Water-type attacks aimed at Heatran while checking their users. Offensive Pokemon that appreciate what Heatran does partner well with it. For example, Mega Scizor can more easily tank physical hits due to Heatran spreading burns and nab important KOs because of the chip damage from burn, Toxic, or Stealth Rock.; Mega Scizor's excellent defenses make it a great teammate for Heatran in general. Doublade also partners very well with Heatran, since it can spinblock and is immune to Fighting-type moves from Mega Medicham, Mega Heracross, and Terrakion. However, they both share a Ground-type weakness. Magnezone is a great Heatran teammate, since it can check Water-types with Thunderbolt, absorb paralysis for Heatran, and bring Heatran in safely with Volt Switch. Empoleon works very well with defensive Heatran, since it resists the Water-type attacks Heatran fears. It can also learn many utility moves that Heatran enjoys, such as Defog, Roar, and Stealth Rock.</p>"

      "Offensive Trapper (Steel)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Magma Storm allows Heatran to trap passive threats such as Chansey, Porygon2, Zapdos, and Mew and remove them from the game, enabling a sweeper such as Doublade or Mega Scizor to demolish the opponent's remaining team. Earth Power provides coverage to hit threats Magma Storm cannot, such as other Heatran and Victini. Toxic combines with Magma Storm quite well, with Magma Storm preventing threats from switching while Toxic's damage increases and its residual damage adding to Toxic's. Taunt allows Heatran to prevent the threats it traps from recovering their health, while also shutting down setup sweepers and entry hazard setters.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Heatran to be as offensively potent as possible, heavily damaging or outright KOing threats such as Skarmory and Magnezone with the appropriate moves and outspeeding standard Mew and Zapdos. Heatran's Air Balloon gives it a temporary immunity to Ground-type moves, allowing it to check Ground-types such as Excadrill and Mamoswine that it can KO and other Pokemon with Ground-type coverage moves, such as other Heatran and Volcarona. On the other hand, Leftovers's residual recovery is very helpful against the bulky threats Heatran traps, allowing it to recover off the damage from their weak attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because of its immunity to Fire, Heatran should be switched into predicted Fire-type moves. It can then receive a boost and hit the opponent with a Flash Fire-boosted Magma Storm. Switch Heatran into Choice-locked Pokemon whose moves it resists or is immune to. Prime examples include Choice Scarf Latios locked into Draco Meteor and Choice Scarf Victini locked into V-create or Blue Flare. Heatran can then damage, trap, Toxic, or Taunt the switch-in. Heatran should also be switched into bulky threats that use Will-O-Wisp such as Mew, as it is immune to these moves, and it can then trap them with Magma Storm. Use Taunt with Magma Storm to prevent foes from using recovery moves, Chansey from paralyzing Heatran, and Clefable from setting up Calm Minds. Once Heatran is in, immediately trap the threat with Magma Storm, and then Taunt it to prevent recovery. After this, Toxic the foe and spam Magma Storm or Earth Power until the threat is KOed, being sure to keep it Taunted. Against Fire-type teams, Heatran must be played very conservatively, as one misprediction means Heatran's team will be swept by the opponent's Fire-types, since there will be no switch-in to it. Against mixed attackers that can break Skarmory, such as Mega Garchomp, keep Heatran's Air Balloon intact so that it can switch into Ground-type attacks in order to attack the threat. Heatran also dislikes paralysis, since it completely ruins Heatran's already mediocre Speed tier, and the opponent can use the free turn generated by a full paralysis to do as they wish.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Scizor is a fantastic partner to Heatran, as Heatran benefits from its devastating weakness to Fire-type attacks and can switch in against them for free. Additionally, Mega Scizor is hit neutrally by Fighting- and Ground-type moves, to which Heatran is weak. Furthermore, Heatran can trap many Pokemon that are setup bait for Mega Scizor, such as Chansey without Thunder Wave and Gliscor. Because Heatran can trap physical walls with Magma Storm, it pairs well with physical attackers that appreciate this, such as Bisharp, Doublade, and Mega Scizor. The previously mentioned physical attackers can heavily dent special walls such as Chansey, allowing Heatran to trap and KO them more easily. Skarmory also provides Stealth Rock and Spikes support, which punishes switches and allows Heatran to KO its foes more easily. In addition, it is neutral to Fighting-type moves and immune to Ground-type moves. Finally, suicide lead Skarmory can set up hazards quickly, which Heatran appreciates. On the other hand, Ferrothorn can tank Water-type moves aimed at Heatran while setting Stealth Rock or Spikes and dealing residual damage with Leech Seed and Iron Barbs. It can also mitigate Heatran's subpar Speed with Thunder Wave. However, both Ferrothorn and Heatran are weak to Fighting-type moves. Jirachi also partners extremely well with Heatran, being able to run several sets that benefit it. A Choice Scarf allows it to revenge kill Fighting-types with Zen Headbutt or Heart Stamp, while an Assault Vest allows it to check Water-types like Rotom-W. Jirachi can also make up for Heatran's lack of recovery, being able to heal it with Wish or sacrifice itself to do so with Healing Wish. Doublade synergizes well with Heatran, since Heatran benefits from its Fire-type weakness and Doublade is immune to Fighting-type moves. Magnezone also pairs well with Heatran, since it can KO opposing Water-types with Thunderbolt, absorb paralysis, and gain momentum with Volt Switch. Excadrill pairs well with Heatran, as its Choice Scarf set can eliminate faster threats that can KO Heatran before it acts, such as Rotom-W and Mega Charizard Y.</p>"

Earth Power rounds out Heatran's coverage and deals more damage to Rock-types like Mega Diancie and Rhyperior as well as opposing Heatran. Hidden Power Ice targets Dragon- and Ground-types such as Dragonite and Garchomp. Air Balloon gives Heatran the ability to evade Ground-type attacks until it's broken, letting it switch in more early-game.</p> <p>Heatran's teammates appreciate its ability to switch into Ground-type attacks early-game and help beat walls they generally struggle with, such as Chansey and Porygon2, by trapping them. Heatran trapping Chansey makes it easier for special attackers to fulfill their roles, and while physical attackers like Victini and Darmanitan need sun to 2HKO Porygon2, they appreciate Heatran trapping and weakening it. Mega Charizard Y provides sun support, acts as entry hazard removal, and threatens bulky Water-types(give some examples) with Solar Beam. Choice Scarf users such as Victini and Darmanitan take care of faster threats such as Hawlucha, Mega Gallade, and Heracross, as well as provide U-turn support. Volcarona appreciates Heatran's ability to weaken walls it otherwise can't handle, letting it set up and sweep late-game more easily. Infernape pairs well as the lead Stealth Rock setter for Fire teams, which helps provide chip damage to make it easier for Heatran to wear down its threats, while also sporting a good Speed tier and STAB Fighting-type coverage. Torkoal can also be used as a Stealth Rock user and entry hazard removal that generally fits better on more balanced teams. Volcanion can switch into Water-type attacks and threaten certain Water-, Ground-, and Fire-types Heatran otherwise would have trouble with, such as Azumarill, Gastrodon, and Volcarona.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Avalugg is a great wall on Ice teams thanks to its incredible Defense allowing it to tank physical attacks from Pokemon like Excadrill and Mega Sharpedo, utility in Rapid Spin, and access to Recover. Furthermore, Sturdy allows it to survive an OHKO and use Rapid Spin or attack with Avalanche. Avalugg can also phaze threatening setup sweepers like Mega Scizor and Volcarona that will attempt to use it as fodder. Unfortunately, its pure Ice typing doesn't contribute much to Ice teams, compounding a weakness to Stealth Rock and Steel-, Fire-, and Fighting-types like Magnezone, Heatran, Victini, and Mega Gallade. Its lack of coverage moves and inability to normally run Toxic leave it walled by opposing defensive Pokemon like Porygon2, Jellicent, and Skarmory. Avalugg's poor special bulk also causes any special attack to wear it down to a great extent.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Ice</h4> <p>Toxic cripples defensive and Ice-resistant Pokemon like Porygon2, Slowbro, and Rotom-W. Avalugg can utilize Sturdy + Mirror Coat to surprise and KO special attackers like Heatran.

The latter three can notably heal off the damage Avalugg does with their reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types prevent Avalugg from removing entry hazards, causing it to be worn down every time it comes in.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Due to its poor special bulk, special attackers like Hydreigon and Nidoking can KO Avalugg; however, the latter two need to be cautious of Avalugg being at maximum HP and retaliating with Avalanche.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Avalugg is easily crippled and worn down by burn and poison, as they both nullify Leftovers recovery, as well as by entry hazards. Entry hazards also hinder the use of Sturdy, allowing Pokemon to pick up KOs more easily on Avalugg.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt from foes like Mew, Mega Gyarados, and Sableye prevents Avalugg from using Recover and Roar.</p>",

Its immunity to Toxic is also very helpful. Empoleon's excellent natural bulk complements its typing greatly. It also has access to amazing utility moves such as Defog, Stealth Rock, and Roar. These qualities make Empoleon a very reliable entry hazard remover, that is also able to set up its own Stealth Rock. However, not having access to any sort of reliable recovery hinders it greatly. Its low Speed allows it to get outsped by common Taunt users such as Mew and Cobalion. Additionally, being weak to common offensive types like Ground, Electric, and Fighting reduces its viability.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Water</h4> <p>Protect helps with scouting, Empoleon's lack of recovery, and punishing High Jump Kick users, namely Mega Lopunny and Hawlucha.

      "Specially Defensive (Water)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is one of Empoleon's main selling points, dealing chip damage to the foes. It keeps certain Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y, Mega Pinsir, and Zapdos in check, which are huge threats to Water-type teams. Defog provides reliable hazard removal. It does, however, get rid of your own hazards as well and thus should be used carefully. Scald is a decently strong STAB move with a 30% chance to burn, preventing most physical attackers from switching in freely. Knock Off over Scald is useful for crippling Eviolite users like Chansey and Porygon2 and Psychic-types that run Colbur Berry sets like Slowbro and Celebi. Roar allows Empoleon to phaze setup sweepers that it cannot beat, such as Calm Mind Mega Latias and Clefable. It also shuffles the opposing team, forcing them into the Stealth Rock that Empoleon set. Toxic is an option over Roar to cripple Zapdos, Gastrodon, and variants of Mega Latias without Refresh.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Defense and HP investment along with a Calm nature allows Empoleon to take special hits as well as it can. The other 4 EVs are dumped into Special Attack to make use of its decently strong STAB move in Scald. Torrent is Empoleon's only useful ability, boosting Scald's power when Empoleon is below 33%. Leftovers enables Empoleon to regain HP throughout the battle.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is best to use Stealth Rock early-game to deal chip damage to the foes. Empoleon can be switched in on most special attacks barring those that are super effective against it in order Stealth Rock or get rid of entry hazards. However, it should not be switched in on strong physical attacks, as it does not appreciate getting worn down too quickly due to having no reliable recovery. Scald can usually be spammed freely, as it limits most physical Pokemon from switching in safely. Empoleon's plethora of resistances can be used to switch in and get rid of hazards or get Stealth Rock up. While Empoleon is a great special wall, it hates sponging damage. Due to its lack of recovery, it can find itself pressured easily, and once it has switched into attacks a few times, it is incapable of setting up Stealth Rock or Defogging away entry hazards. Empoleon should be careful of switching into some setup sweepers; for example, it has to switch into Mega Latias's Calm Mind if it wants any hope of phazing it, as +1 Mega Latias can 2HKO it with Thunderbolt easily. It is unwise to let Leftovers get Knocked Off, since Empoleon gets worn down very quickly without it. Empoleon should be kept healthy to wall special attackers and spread burns.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Empoleon manages to fit on both balanced and stall team archetypes thanks to its unique typing and great utility, and it doesn't need very much support. Volcanion and Gyarados are two Pokemon that greatly appreciate Stealth Rock removal through Defog. Gyarados also takes Ground- and Fighting-type moves that threaten Empoleon while the latter takes Rock-type moves for Gyarados. Gyarados's access to Intimidate further boosts Empoleon's ability to take hits. Rotom-W is a perfect partner for Empoleon due to its Ground-type immunity, access to Will-O-Wisp, and physical bulk. Will-O-Wisp hinders physical attackers greatly, something Empoleon appreciates. Rotom-W also takes neutral damage from Electric-type attacks, which greatly benefits Empoleon. Mega Sharpedo, Azumarill, Manaphy, and Mega Gyarados are some amazing wallbreakers that appreciate Empoleon's ability to get up Stealth Rock. Azumarill's Fairy typing lets it take Fighting-type attacks aimed at Empoleon. Mega Sharpedo and Mega Gyarados appreciate Empoleon's ability to switch into Fairy-, Fighting-, Bug-, and Psychic-type moves. Swampert has good physical bulk and a great typing that synergizes well with Empoleon, but it has completely redundant utility in Scald, Roar, and Stealth Rock. Slowbro helps Empoleon greatly by being able to take on most physical attacks, especially Fighting-type moves.</p>"

    "overview": "<h3>Fire</h3> <p>Blessed with an amazing ability in Drought and an incredibly high Special Attack stat, Mega Charizard Y is one of the best wallbreakers in the metagame. Drought boosts its Fire-type moves while weakening Water-type moves, removing other weather effects such as rain and sand, and making Solar Beam a one-turn move. To complement this, Mega Charizard Y has been gifted fantastic coverage through which it can OHKO or at least 2HKO almost everything in the metagame. It can also clear away entry hazards through Defog to help its teammates. Additionally, its pretty decent Special Defense stat lets it survive most special attacks in sun. To take further advantage of this, Mega Charizard Y can run Roost to improve its longevity. It notably is blessed with an immunity to Ground-type moves thanks to its secondary typing, Flying. Although its base 100 Speed isn't bad, the metagame is crowded with base 100 Speed Pokemon, which leaves it Speed tying with Victini, which can KO it with Bolt Strike, and Manaphy, which can set up Rain Dance on an incoming Solar Beam. It also has a relatively low Defense stat and therefore does not like taking physical hits. As it is a Fire-type Pokemon, it is weak to Stealth Rock as is, but its secondary typing makes it even weaker to it, leaving it with only half of its health if it comes in on it. Besides this, Mega Charizard Y can easily be worn down through priority attacks and other forms of residual damage. Although it is mostly used as a wallbreaker, its wallbreaking capabilities are heavily reliant on sun being up.</p> <h3>Flying</h3> <p>Mega Charizard Y's great Fire typing and base 159 Special Attack make it a powerful wallbreaker. Its ability, Drought, raises the damage output of its Fire-type STAB moves and makes Solar Beam a one-turn move. It also halves the damage of Water-type moves, which helps against Mega Charizard Y's Water-type matchup, as well as allowing it to viably use Solar Beam as coverage for Pokemon such as Seismitoad, Slowbro, and Swampert. However, despite Mega Charizard Y's decent Speed tier, it's generally frail and doesn't have the best Defense and HP. It is also checked by Dragon-types such as Garchomp, Dragonite, and Latias. Finally, due to its typing, it is 4x weak to Stealth Rock, so a Defogger is always needed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Fire</h4> <p>Mega Charizard Y can use a Modest nature over Timid to further increase its Special Attack, but it misses out on outspeeding Pokemon such as maximum Speed Excadrill and Kyurem-B and the opportunity to Speed tie with other base 100 Speed Pokemon. Dragon Pulse can be used to hit Dragon-type Pokemon, but it is only useful in that matchup, as Fire Blast or Solar Beam will generally outdamage Dragon-types that are neutral to them. Tailwind and Will-O-Wisp can be used as support moves both for its teammates and to increase Mega Charizard Y's own Speed or wear down Pokemon that it has a difficult time facing.</p> <h4>Flying</h4> <p>A Modest nature can be run over a Timid nature for greater damage output, although losing the Speed boost makes Mega Charizard Y slower than Hydreigon and Kyurem-Black, which both tend to run a Speed-boosting nature. Mega Charizard Y can use Dragon Pulse to hit the Dragon-types that threaten it, although it doesn't do much to bulky Dragon-types. Earthquake can be used over Focus Blast to deal more damage to opposing Heatran, although it deals less damage to Tyranitar. A bulkier set with Will-O-Wisp, Fire Blast, and Roost can be used over the wallbreaking set, as Mega Charizard Y has better special bulk than Zapdos, and its typing gives it a neutrality to Ice, although Mega Gyarados does a better job as an Ice-resistant Pokemon for Flying teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Fire</h4> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey utterly counters Mega Charizard Y thanks to being able to always switch in and use status moves or set up Stealth Rock while wasting sun turns.</p> <p><strong>Mega Latias</strong>: Mega Latias, just like Chansey, can switch into all of Mega Charizard Y's attacks with ease. Then, it can cripple Mega Charizard Y with Toxic or Thunder Wave or set up with Calm Mind while wasting sun turns.</p> <p><strong>Gyarados and Sharpedo</strong>: Gyarados can take a Solar Beam before Mega Evolving, allowing it set up Dragon Dance in its regular forme and then OHKO Mega Charizard Y with a Crunch after Mega Evolving. On the other hand, Sharpedo can use Protect and gain a Speed boost and then Mega Evolve to have a good chance to KO Mega Charizard Y with Crunch.</p> <p><strong>Rock types</strong>: Rock-type Pokemon such as Mega Diancie, Terrakion, Aerodactyl, and specially defensive Assault Vest Tyranitar can all either outspeed Mega Charizard Y or take a Solar Beam and KO it in return.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Latios, Latias, Garchomp, and Dragonite can all take take one of Mega Charizard Y's attacks and KO it in return, although the former two need slight damage on it beforehand.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather Setters</strong>: Opposing weather setters such as Politoed, Tyranitar, and Hippowdon can be annoying for Mega Charizard Y to deal with, as it can't use an immediate Solar Beam if they switch in. However, Tyranitar and Hippowdon are 2HKOed by Focus Blast and Fire Blast in sand, respectively. Politoed is good at switching into Mega Charizard Y, although Focus Blast can 2HKO it after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: As Mega Charizard Y's Speed is not particularly spectacular, faster Pokemon such as Terrakion, Mega Diancie, and Choice Scarf Kyurem-B can easily outspeed and OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status effects such as poison, paralysis, and sleep heavily reduce Mega Charizard Y's wallbreaking capabilities. Poison compromises Mega Charizard Y's longevity, paralysis quarters its Speed, and sleep makes it unable to attack for at least one turn.</p> <h4>Flying</h4> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Bulky Dragon-types such as Latias, Goodra, and Dragalge can tank Mega Charizard Y's hits and retaliate with a hard-hitting attack. Faster Dragons such as Latios and Choice Scarf Kyurem-B can revenge kill it. Dragonite also resists all of Mega Charizard Y's attacks and OHKOes it with Outrage.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types generally don't have a switch-in to Mega Charizard Y, but Pokemon such as Mega Manectric and Thundurus can revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Faster threats such as Terrakion, Landorus, and Choice Scarf Victini can easily outspeed and revenge kill Mega Charizard Y with Stone Edge, Rock Slide, and Bolt Strike, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Pokemon such as Chansey and Tyranitar can wall Mega Charizard Y, forcing it to switch out. Chansey can stall it out with Toxic and Soft-Boiled. Tyranitar requires a sand boost to survive a Focus Blast, so if Mega Charizard Y tries to use Solar Beam, it can easily switch in, get rid of the sun with Sand Stream, tank Focus Blast, and retaliate with Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock removes half of Mega Charizard Y's health, keeping it from switching in safely.</p> <p><strong>Politoed</strong>: Politoed is quite a good check because its Drizzle removes sun, so if Mega Charizard Y tries to use Solar Beam when Politoed comes in, it can cripple it with Scald.</p>",

      "Wallbreaker (Fire)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast is Mega Charizard Y's main attack and gets boosted by sun, which allows it to OHKO or at least 2HKO almost every Pokemon in the metagame. Flamethrower can be used as a more accurate but severely weaker alternative STAB attack; using this over Fire Blast loses out on a lot of KOs such as 2HKOing opposing Charizard and Latios as well as losing the chance to OHKO Mega Gardevoir. Solar Beam is another move that takes advantage of the sun, as it becomes a one-turn move that is super effective against all of Mega Charizard Y's threats such as Slowbro, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon. Focus Blast 2HKOes even the most specially defensive Tyranitar or Heatran, which would generally pose a problem for Mega Charizard Y. Defog is mostly used on teams that lack hazard control to to clear away entry hazards that can create problems for Mega Charizard Y and its teammates. Roost can be used as an alternative to Defog to improve Mega Charizard Y's longevity and allow it to be used more freely. However, this should only be used if there is an alternative form of hazard control.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment lets Mega Charizard Y hit as hard as possible. A Timid nature with maximum Speed EVs is used to make it as fast as it can possibly be as well as to Speed tie with other base 100 Speed Pokemon. Blaze is chosen because Solar Power needlessly chips away at Charizard's health if it switches in while sun is set by the opponent and because it is not compatible with Defog. Charizard's HP stat should always be an odd number after investment so that it can come in on Stealth Rock twice.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As Mega Charizard Y is a wallbreaker, it should be sent out as soon as the opportunity arises to set up sun as well as to break opposing walls that could trouble its teammates. Because Charizard's Speed and bulk aren't particularly good, it should try to Mega Evolve primarily against slower Pokemon that either don't threaten it or can be taken out immediately. As it is 4x weak to it, Mega Charizard Y should not be sent out while Stealth Rock is still in the field. Keeping the hazard off the user's side also helps it switch in and out more. It can be sent out against Stealth Rock setters right away if it is running Defog so that it does not have to take the extra damage from Stealth Rock. Mega Charizard Y should avoid getting hit with any type of status, as that can severely reduce its wallbreaking capabilities. It must make full use of the sun turns that Drought provides, because once sun ends, Mega Charizard Y's damage output is cut significantly, allowing Pokemon such as Latios to use Roost to recover damage and stall out the remaining turns. It can use Roost to be able to switch into attacks freely and to recover off Stealth Rock damage if it is forced to switch into it. Mega Charizard Y can be sent out against Water-types, as it can take most special Water-type moves because of sun halving their damage and its decent Special Defense stat. Mega Charizard Y also can defeat most Water-type Pokemon one-on-one thanks to its access to Solar Beam; however, it must be careful when using Solar Beam if it is up against an opposing weather setter, which can lock Mega Charizard Y into the charge turn. Against Hippowdon, there isn't much of a worry because it can't really do anything back, but Politoed and Tyranitar will OHKO Mega Charizard Y with Scald and Stone Edge, respectively. Drought can also be used to remove weather effects such as sand and rain to stop potential Sand Rush or Swift Swim sweepers. However, Charizard must be already be Mega Evolved in order to do so, as the Swift Swim or Sand Rush user's Speed is calculated before sun is set.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Most Fire-type Pokemon appreciate Mega Charizard Y's ability to set up sun to boost their Fire-type moves. Some form of entry hazard control is absolutely crucial while using Mega Charizard Y. Torkoal in particular is a great partner, as it can not only clear away opposing Stealth Rock but also set up its own to help Mega Charizard Y break walls. Mega Charizard Y and Darmanitan work amazingly as an offensive core due to both having ridiculous offensive stats and Mega Charizard Y's sun boosting both of their STAB attacks. Darmanitan also clears out specially defensive walls such as Chansey for Mega Charizard Y to clean later in the match. Darmanitan can also pivot through U-turn to safely bring in Mega Charizard Y. Infernape has Fighting-type STAB to beat Normal-type Pokemon like Chansey, which would normally wall Mega Charizard Y. Like Darmanitan, Infernape can also pivot through U-turn and find good opportunities to bring in Mega Charizard Y safely. Heatran can set up Stealth Rock or use Toxic on the foe to deal chip damage throughout the game and make it easier for Mega Charizard Y to break the opposing team. It can also be used as a check to Mega Diancie through the Choice Scarf set. Entei can be used together with Mega Charizard Y because it can burn foes through Sacred Fire to weaken Pokemon for Mega Charizard Y to clean. Victini is another great partner, as it can sweep late-game if sun is up. Mega Charizard Y and Victini also can heavily pressure Water-type Pokemon with Solar Beam and Bolt Strike, respectively. Victini can also run utility-oriented moves, such as Glaciate, to hit foes such as Landorus-T and Garchomp, or U-turn, to pivot out to Mega Charizard Y. Volcanion is also an option, as it is immune to Water-type attacks, which Mega Charizard Y can be worn down by. Volcanion can also burn opposing pokemon through Steam Eruption, which cripples them to the point where Mega Charizard Y can clean up. Rotom-H's ability to switch into Electric-type attacks is very nice, along with its ability to set up Reflect and Light Screen, which enable Mega Charizard Y to survive attacks from faster foes that it otherwise couldn't, such as from Thundurus and even Choice Scarf Excadrill. Rotom-H can also pivot through Volt Switch and find opportunities to bring in Mega Charizard Y safely.</p>"

      "Wallbreaker (Flying)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast is Mega Charizard Y's best Fire-type STAB move, especially in sun, when it can OHKO or severely weaken anything that doesn't resist it. Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast for better accuracy, but Fire Blast is generally better, as it guarantees an OHKO on Mega Gallade while also being able to 2HKO Latios, OHKO Mega Gardevoir, and OHKO fast Zapdos after Stealth Rock damage. Thanks to Drought, Solar Beam hits in one turn and deals massive damage to bulky Water-types such as Swampert, Slowbro, and Azumarill. Focus Blast is great coverage for Pokemon like Tyranitar, Heatran, Hydreigon, and Mega Houndoom. Roost mitigates Stealth Rock damage and increases Mega Charizard Y's longevity.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack EVs are used to increase Mega Charizard Y's total damage output. 252 Speed EVs and Timid nature are used to maximize its Speed, allowing it to outspeed threats such as non-Choice Scarf Kyurem-B and Hydreigon and dent them with Fire Blast and Focus Blast, respectively. It also allows Mega Charizard Y to crucially Speed tie with opposing base 100 Speed Pokemon, such as -1 Choice Scarf Victini, Mega Gardevoir, and Entei.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Avoid switching Mega Charizard Y in when Stealth Rock is on the field, since it loses half of its health; therefore, a Defogger is necessary to maximize Mega Charizard Y's wallbreaking potential and to make it easier for it to switch in. Taking advantage of the Pokemon that Mega Charizard Y forces to switch in, such as Chansey and Latias, allows you to keep up offensive momentum by double switching into an appropriate teammate, such as Landorus-T. Mega Charizard Y has decent special bulk and can take some hits, allowing it to Roost to keep healthy and act as a better wallbreaker. Thanks to Mega Charizard Y's Ice neutrality, Choice Scarf Kyurem-B cannot 2HKO it, while it can retaliate with Fire Blast. Mega Charizard Y is better off coming in and out early-game to try to take out the opposing walls, letting its teammates act more freely.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defoggers such as Zapdos and Skarmory help Mega Charizard Y by removing Stealth Rock, allowing it to perform better as a wallbreaker and not lose half of its health. Zapdos has a slow Volt Switch that can help Mega Charizard Y come in safely; it also has Toxic to wear down walls that Mega Charizard Y cannot, such as Mega Latias and Assault Vest users such as Meloetta, Sap Sipper Azumarill, and Goodra. It also serves as a great specially defensive wall that can switch into Electric-type attacks safely. Skarmory is a great physically defensive wall and can switch into Rock-type attacks that are aimed at Mega Charizard Y. It's also very good for checking Mega Diancie that lack Hidden Power Fire, as it freely switches in and threatens it with Iron Head. Entry hazard setters such as Skarmory, Landorus-T, and Aerodactyl can give Mega Charizard Y an easier time wallbreaking.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Landorus-T is a good revenge killer that can help take on faster threats for Mega Charizard Y. Landorus-T can also set up Stealth Rock and is a nice check to physical attackers in general thanks to Intimidate. Dragonite is a good wallbreaker that pairs well with Mega Charizard Y. Together, they put a lot of pressure on opposing walls. Mega Charizard Y is weak to Electric, so having Landorus-T, Thundurus-T, or Gliscor as a partner is good, since they are immune to the type. Gliscor is a fantastic stallbreaker, assisting Mega Charizard Y in beating defensive cores. It's also helpful to have Rock-resistant Pokemon such as Skarmory, Gliscor, and Landorus-T to help versus fast Rock-type Pokemon that threaten Mega Charizard Y, such as Mega Diancie and Terrakion. Choice Scarf Togekiss is another revenge killer that really appreciates Mega Charizard Y breaking the special walls that it cannot defeat easily. Thundurus has access to Prankster Thunder Wave support and Nasty Plot, which benefits greatly from Mega Charizard Y's wallbreaking potential.</p>"

  "Pidgeot": {
    "overview": "<h3>Normal</h3> <p>Mega Pidgeot is an excellent Pokemon on Normal teams, chiefly for its ability to decimate Fighting teams with its STAB Hurricane. With its great base 121 Speed, it outruns not only every Fighting-type bar Mega Lopunny but also most of the unboosted metagame, as well as slower Choice Scarf users like Magnezone. It ties with Porygon-Z for having the highest Special Attack of all Normal-type Pokemon, so it can dish out a lot of damage. No Guard allows Mega Pidgeot to throw around perfectly accurate Hurricanes. There are no Pokemon that are immune to Flying-type moves, and the move also has a nice 30% chance to confuse the foe, which could bail Mega Pidgeot out of a tight spot.</p> <p>However, despite Mega Pidgeot having two immunities, its bulk is average at best, so it has a hard time switching in. Its special movepool is also woefully shallow, making it rather predictable. In addition, No Guard means opposing Stone Edge, Hydro Pump, and Thunder will always hit.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Normal</h4> <p>Work Up can be used to boost Mega Pidgeot's Special Attack, although it struggles finding time to set up. Toxic can cripple Pokemon like Zapdos that otherwise wall Mega Pidgeot, but the coverage of Hidden Power Ground and the utility of Defog, Roost, and U-turn make them superior options. Tailwind could be used as a last-ditch move to help Mega Pidgeot's teammates. However, Mega Pidgeot just doesn't have the space for the move and aside from Diggersby, there aren't that many Pokemon on a Normal team that would benefit from it. Hyper Beam can be used as a last resort to take out troublesome Electric-types, but it leaves Mega Pidgeot wide open to revenge killing or being set up on. Substitute can be run as a buffer against revenge killers; however, with Mega Pidgeot's Stealth Rock weakness and lack of Leftovers, it can find itself worn down very quickly when using the move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Normal</h4> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Defensive Heatran completely walls non-Hidden Power Ground Mega Pidgeot, and it can 2HKO Mega Pidgeot with Lava Plume, set up Stealth Rock in its face, or cripple it with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Most Electric-type Pokemon can easily take a Hurricane and OHKO Mega Pidgeot back with their STAB moves. Rotom-W and Zapdos wall it completely, and Mega Manectric outruns it and OHKOes with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Mega Pidgeot can't touch most Rock-types, notably Tyranitar and Mega Diancie, as they resist Hurricane and Heat Wave and can OHKO it with a Rock-type STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Strong priority users like Choice Band Dragonite, Choice Band Scizor, and Life Orb Mamoswine can revenge kill Mega Pidgeot after it has taken prior damage. Choice Scarf users that can hit Mega Pidgeot super effectively like Terrakion can also reliably revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls like Chansey, Porygon2, and Gastrodon can wall Mega Pidgeot and stall it out with Toxic. Chansey doesn't even care about Toxic from it due to Natural Cure.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock reduces Mega Pidgeot's HP by 25% each time it comes in, making it far easier to revenge kill.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hurricane is boosted by STAB and does good damage to anything that doesn't resist it or isn't a special wall. It also has a 30% chance to confuse the foe. Heat Wave hits the Steel-types that resist Hurricane super effectively. It OHKOes Bisharp and Mega Scizor, both of which are threats to Normal teams. Roost provides reliable recovery so that Mega Pidgeot can spam Hurricane for longer. Hidden Power Ground 2HKOes specially defensive Heatran, which would otherwise wall this set completely. Defog can be used to clear the field of entry hazards. However, it should not be used without Roost, as Mega Pidgeot will then find it harder to Defog throughout the match. U-turn allows Mega Pidgeot to scout switch-ins and grab momentum.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs maximize Speed to make the most of Mega Pidgeot's excellent Speed tier and maximize Special Attack to let it hit as hard as possible. As Mega Pidgeot isn't bulky, there is little point investing in bulk. Big Pecks is the least situational of Pidgeot's pre-Mega abilities. However, if you're running Defog, use Keen Eye instead, as Big Pecks is incompatible with Defog. Since Mega Pidgeot will be Mega Evolving as soon as possible anyway, the ability choice is largely immaterial, as No Guard overrides it anyway.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Evolve Pidgeot as soon as possible so it can take advantage of the new Speed and power as soon as it can. The extra Speed in particular lets it outrun Mega Gallade. More often than not, throwing around Hurricane is your best bet, as even Pokemon that resist the move have a 30% chance to be confused. Mega Pidgeot can't take hits very well, so when possible, bring it in after a revenge kill or through a slow U-turn.</p> <p>If running Roost, using it whenever a free turn presents itself is recommended to keep Mega Pidgeot's health up, allowing it to spam Hurricane for longer. Against Fighting teams, Mega Pidgeot should be brought in safely as often as possible, as it can 2HKO at worst every Fighting-type and naturally outruns all Pokemon on a Fighting team. U-turn can help Pidgeot Mega Evolve safely, as well as scout switch-ins.</p> <p>This set can perform a number of roles—it can be an early- to mid-game wallbreaker, a late-game cleaner, and a revenge killer due to its high Speed. Mega Pidgeot struggles to beat Stealth Rock setters like Empoleon and Heatran, so finding opportunities to use Defog can be difficult. On the other hand, though, the threat of a perfectly accurate Hurricane can force switches that Mega Pidgeot can take advantage of to use Defog. Mega Pidgeot can use U-turn to pivot out of Pokemon that would otherwise wall it like Zapdos and defensive Heatran (the latter can be 2HKOed with Hidden Power Ground, however).</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Mega Pidgeot struggles against Rock and Electric teams, Diggersby is a great teammate, as it can easily threaten those teams and is the best physical wallbreaker Normal has. The two can form a dual wallbreaking core, removing each other's checks. Chansey and Porygon2 can wall most of the Electric-types Mega Pidgeot struggles with. Chansey can also set up Stealth Rock to help Pidgeot get more KOs. Their presence on your team also lets Mega Pidgeot fire off powerful attacks and then pivot out to safety. Both can also spread Thunder Wave and Toxic to help Mega Pidgeot outrun otherwise faster foes and cripple walls it can't touch, respectively. Staraptor can remove the dreaded Stealth Rock with Defog, freeing up the moveslot for Mega Pidgeot. It can also bring it in safely with a relatively slow U-turn. Mega Pidgeot can work well with other U-turn and Volt Switch users like Diggersby and Heliolisk. They can both also switch in on the Electric-type moves it draws in. Meloetta can wallbreak alongside Mega Pidgeot while also soft checking Fighting-types.</p>"

  "Clefable": {
    "overview": "<p>The combination of Clefable's decent bulk, a good defensive typing in Fairy that leaves it only weak to Steel and Poison, its abilities, and its movepool makes it incredibly versatile and able to fulfill a lot of different roles on the team. Clefable is great at compressing many roles due to its vast movepool and good bulk backed by two great abilities. Its primary roles on the team can be to check Scizor, get entry hazards up, and be a wincon in a lot of match-ups. Its two primary abilities are Magic Guard and Unaware. Magic Guard is very nice for absorbing moves like Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, and Leech Seed, coming in on hazards without taking any damage, and even negating Life Orb recoil to let Clefable be used as an offensive tank. Unaware on the other hand lets it check setup sweepers such as Mega Gyarados and Mega Scizor and stop them from sweeping your team. Additionally, Clefable's wide movepool gives it many options. It has access to Stealth Rock, which not many other Fairy-type Pokemon do. It can be a cleric with access to Wish and Heal Bell, it has nice utility options in Encore, Knock Off, and Thunder Wave, it has very solid coverage in Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, Flamethrower, and Moonblast, and Calm Mind can turn it into a very dangerous setup sweeper that's not easy to deal with. It's one of the few Pokemon on Fairy that are able to survive an unboosted Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor and have access to Fire-type moves in Flamethrower and Fire Blast, and that makes it a very important asset to Fairy.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Using Stealth Rock over Thunder Wave or Fire Blast on the Calm Mind set is a viable option for teams that want the role compression. Unaware can be used to check setup sweepers such as Mega Gyarados and set up alongside them. It's only recommended to use Unaware if you're running Fire Blast so Clefable can check Mega Scizor, the biggest threat to Fairy. Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast for better accuracy and more PP. Stealth Rock can be used over Fire Blast or Thunder Wave on the Calm Mind set if you're unable to fit it anywhere else on the team and you already have something to check Scizor. Ice Beam allows Clefable to hit Gliscor, which shuts down Clefable if it has Taunt; however, by running Ice Beam you miss out on more important moves. On top of Calm Mind, Cosmic Power can be used to make Clefable an even more dangerous and bulky setup sweeper that's very hard to deal with for some types. Wish can provide great support to the rest of the team thanks to Clefable's high HP stat. Heal Bell is an option on the utility set for getting rid of status that may annoy your team; however, Togekiss is the superior option to use this move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Even if it's carrying Fire coverage, Clefable still can't touch Heatran and Empoleon, and numerous fast and powerful Steel-type Pokemon can potentially take it out such as Bisharp and Excadrill.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon resist Clefable's two standard moves, and a lot of Fire-type Pokemon are strong wallbreakers that are able to take on Clefable.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-type Pokemon resist Clefable's STAB Moonblast, and powerful Poison-type wallbreakers such as Gengar and Nidoking have no problem taking it out even if it has used Calm Mind a couple of times.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users prevent Clefable from setting up, healing, or spreading status, therefore forcing it to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey's amazing special bulk allows it to reliably check Clefable and eat up its attacks.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Clefable is only able to boost its Special Defense with Calm Mind, leaving it vulnerable to strong physical attackers such as Choice Band Azumarill.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Before setting up a Calm Mind, Clefable is quite vulnerable to strong special attackers such as Sludge Wave Landorus.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Certain setup sweepers such as Gyarados and Mega Scizor can set up against Clefable if it doesn't have the right move to deal with them.</p>",

Calm Mind boosts Clefable's Special Attack and Special Defense, which makes it very dangerous because it can be very hard to take out. Depending on the match-up, the game could already be over if Clefable gets to set up a few Calm Minds. Soft-Boiled allows Clefable to restore its HP, which is very helpful when it's trying to set up. Fire Blast allows Clefable to hit Steel-types, which otherwise wall it. It's especially useful for Mega Scizor, which otherwise can set up for free against Clefable. Unlike Flamethrower, which requires it to come in on Stealth Rock first, Fire Blast gets the OHKO on Mega Scizor at full HP. Thunder Wave is an alternative option that provides great support for the rest of the team, allowing it to handle faster Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, Terrakion, Victini and Mega Pinsir, and also supports the Calm Mind sweep. Stealth Rock applies a lot of pressure in certain match-ups such as against Flying, Bug, Fire, and Ice, and Clefable is one of the only Fairy-type Pokemon to get access to it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP EVs are used to make Clefable as bulky as possible, as it needs to be able to take hits to fulfill its many roles. Maximum Defense EVs allow Clefable to check physical attackers, which it's the go-to Fairy-type Pokemon to do, and it also helps it take both physical and special hits after setting up a Calm Mind. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 172 Def / 84 SpD with a Calm nature gives Clefable a little more Special Defense and allows it to avoid getting 2HKOed by Mega Diancie's Moonblast and Mega Manectric's and Thundurus's Thunderbolt. However, if that spread is used, strong physical attackers such as Mega Swampert and Mega Garchomp become hard to check or switch into, as they'll all be able to 2HKO Clefable. Leftovers allows Clefable to check Pokemon better by restoring a bit of health each turn and increasing its longevity. Magic Guard is very helpful for absorbing crippling status such as burn and poison and avoiding damage from entry hazards, Leech Seed, and weather.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Clefable can serve as a defensive pivot, as it takes neutral hits pretty easily for the most part, but it can't switch in on very powerful attackers such as Landorus, Choice Band Azumarill, and other strong wallbreakers, as they can all 2HKO it. It can also pivot into Pokemon that want to spread burns or poison due to Magic Guard, and those Pokemon are usually easy setup fodder. It can set set up with Calm Mind against Pokemon that aren't able to 2HKO it or aren't threats to it at all such as Rotom-W, Sableye, and non-Taunt Mew. It should not be used on physical attackers that 2HKO Clefable, as it's only able to boost its Special Defense. Before setting up a Calm Mind, though, Clefable is vulnerable to strong special attacks, as it's not able to tank them as well as it tanks physical attacks. Calm Mind doesn't always have to be used with the intention to sweep; it can be useful early-game for checking specially attacking threats and dealing with them more effectively. Although its Speed isn't high, Clefable should avoid getting paralyzed so it can be more reliable at fulfilling its roles. Clefable can survive a Bullet Punch from Choice Band Scizor and take it out with Fire Blast, but to do so its health has to be preserved. Thunder Wave can be used on any Pokemon whether it's faster than Clefable or not because the full paralysis chance is always nice, and it helps in beating Pokemon such as +1 Gyarados, which would otherwise beat Clefable one-on-one.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Klefki's ability to set up Reflect and Light Screen helps support the Clefable sweep a ton. Dual screens combined with Clefable's bulk allow it to use Calm Mind as much as it wants as well as slow down the foe with Thunder Wave and potentially just win the game right there. Pokemon that resist Moonblast can stop the Clefable sweep, notably Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Empoleon, which are very bulky and can even beat a +6 Clefable. Azumarill, being a very strong physical wallbreaker, can take care of Heatran and Empoleon, while Ferrothorn can be weakened by any Fire move such as Hidden Power Fire on Mega Diancie and Sylveon or Fire Blast on Togekiss. Gardevoir's Psychic typing allows it to check Poison-type Pokemon for Clefable to have an easier time setting up. When equipped with a Choice Scarf, its Trace ability also allows it to be a check to Sand Rush Excadrill, which is a big threat while sand is up. Gardevoir may also use Trick to cripple Pokemon that Clefable doesn't like, such as Taunt Mew. Choice Specs Sylveon is another great partner to deal with Taunt Gliscor, which shuts down Clefable.</p>"

Leftovers allows Clefable to check Pokemon better by restoring a bit of health each turn and increasing its longevity. Magic Guard is very helpful for absorbing crippling status such as burn and poison and avoiding damage from entry hazards, Leech Seed, and weather. Unaware lets Clefable check +2 Mega Scizor and take it out with Fire Blast.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Clefable is a great defensive pivot, as it takes neutral hits pretty well, but it cannot switch in on very powerful wallbreakers such as Mega Gardevoir, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcanion, because it's going to get 2HKOed. The given EV spread allows it to switch in on most Electric-types and Kyurem-B, thus covering the lack of good Electric switch-ins on Fairy. It can pivot into Pokemon that want to spread crippling status if it's running Magic Guard. If Unaware is the chosen ability, Clefable can check +2 Mega Scizor, but it still needs to be kept healthy, as it's not able to switch in on a Bullet Punch. It has a good match-up against most Defog users, so Stealth Rock should go up as early as possible to support the rest of the team. Thunder Wave can be used on any foe to cripple them, but it's especially useful against setup sweepers if not running Unaware.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Klefki's immunity to Poison and neutrality to Steel make it a great partner for Clefable. Steel-types that annoy Clefable such as Heatran and Empoleon are big threats to Fairy. Azumarill is a very strong physical wallbreaker that has the ability to deal with both of those two. Pokemon with Fire-type coverage such as Togekiss and Mega Diancie are good partners for dealing with Steel-types that threaten Clefable. Gardevoir checks Poison-type Pokemon that Clefable can't do much against. When it's equipped with a Choice Scarf, its Trace ability also allows it to be a check to Sand Rush Excadrill, which is a big threat while sand is up. Gardevoir can also use Trick to cripple Pokemon that Clefable doesn't like facing, such as Mew and Gliscor. Choice Specs Sylveon is a very strong wallbreaker that's able to 2HKO Gliscor.</p>"

  "Tentacruel": {
    "overview": "<h3>Water</h3> <p>Tentacruel's good defensive Water / Poison typing most notably allows it to resist Fairy and Fighting, both of which can have an easy time against Water, as well as Poison and Bug. Its high base 120 Special Defense, ability Liquid Ooze, and Grass neutrality allow it to switch into one of Water's biggest threats; Mega Venusaur. It also works well as a Clefable check, wearing it down with a combination of Acid Spray and Scald. In general, its great Special Defense stat allows it to switch into special attackers with relative ease. Furthermore, its base 100 Speed is above average for a rather defensive Pokemon. Despite Starmie being the more offensively suited option for a spinner, Tentacruel offers immense support as the superior defensive spinner and should definitely be considered should you be looking for one. Moreover, it functions as a good stallbreaker with Acid Spray, can set Toxic Spikes for its team, can reliably use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards, and forces switches on setup sweepers such as CroCune and Calm Mind Clefable, therefore providing a large and unique set of roles among Water-types.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Tentacruel is outsped by most Ground- and Psychic-types and hit super effectively by their STAB moves. Steel- and Flying-types are immune to Toxic Spikes, with the former walling Tentacruel and the most of the latter being able to hit it for good neutral damage. As a result of running no Special Attack investment, Tentacruel heavily relies on the foe's Special Defense drops from Acid Spray or other means to actually deal a decent amount of damage with its STAB moves. In addition, its below-average physical bulk prevents it from being able to face physical attackers without taking a lot of damage, and in most cases, it is simply setup fodder due to its inability to deal much damage back. It also lacks reliable recovery, meaning it is worn down very quickly and finds itself pressured to remove or set entry hazards, so team support is crucial.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Water</h4> <p>Ice Beam hits Flying- and Dragon-types, though it's generally subpar coverage. Knock Off is an option to remove Togekiss's Choice Scarf, as well as Eviolite and other items; however, Tentacruel's current moves are quite necessary and forgoing one will cause Tentacruel to miss out on something important. Tentacruel can run a physically defensive set to take on Fighting-types like Breloom better, but it will have a hard time checking threatening special attackers like Serperior and Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Water</h4> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Excadrill, Landorus, and Mega Garchomp all outspeed Tentacruel and can KO it with their STAB moves. Although most of them are 2HKOed by Scald, Quagsire and Mega Garchomp take little damage from it and can 2HKO and OHKO back, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Defensive Psychic-types, such as Latias and Starmie, can easily take Tentacruel's STAB moves and remove entry hazards with Defog or Rapid Spin. Offensive Psychic-types, such as Latios and Mega Gallade, which outspeed Tentacruel and can KO it with a Psychic-type STAB move, although Gallade would definitely not appreciate being burned by Scald.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Raikou have an easy time against Tentacruel; Rotom-W can easily cripple it with Will-O-Wisp and pivot out with Volt Switch, Thundurus OHKOes it with Thunderbolt, and Choice Specs Raikou has a good chance to OHKO Tentacruel, while Calm Mind Raikou can simply use Substitute and accumulate a couple of boosts with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Physical attackers such as Mega Sharpedo and Dragonite can take advantage of Tentacruel's passiveness by using it as setup bait and hitting Tentacruel on its weaker Defense stat; however, they are greatly crippled by a Scald burn.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Spinner (Water)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald, though weak without any Special Attack investment, allows Tentacruel to spread burns to the opposing team, forcing switches and dissuading physical attackers from switching in on it and setting up. Rapid Spin is an effective move thanks to Tentacruel's defensive typing and decent bulk, removing entry hazards for its team. Acid Spray forces switches and discourages setup sweepers, such as Calm Mind Clefable, from using Tentacruel as setup fodder. Toxic Spikes provides a great amount of support for your team, wearing down grounded foes and allowing a teammate to have an easier time breaking through the opposing team. Alternatively, in place of Acid Spray, Sludge Bomb can be used for a stronger Poison-type STAB move that lets Tentacruel threaten Serperior, which doesn't care about Scald and gets a Special Defense boost from Acid Spray, as well as OHKO Breloom. However, dropping Acid Spray prevents Tentacruel from being able to take on Clefable and Mega Venusaur.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs, a Calm nature, and 240 Special Defense EVs allow Tentacruel to be as specially bulky as possible. 16 Speed EVs allow Tentacruel to outspeed Adamant Bisharp and hit it with Scald, hopefully burning it. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 148 SpD / 108 Spe can be used to allow Tentacruel to outspeed Jolly Breloom by one point and take it out with Sludge Bomb. Black Sludge is used to restore Tentacruel's HP gradually. Liquid Ooze allows Tentacruel to switch into Mega Venusaur and cause it to take damage as a result of using Giga Drain.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switching Tentacruel in on resisted attacks allows it to then remove entry hazards or set hazards of its own without getting worn down too much. Removing hazards should be the main priority if you feel your team will be greatly hindered by them. Setting a single layer of Toxic Spikes is more than enough; don't set more if you think the foe will start setting up. Use Acid Spray against setup sweepers to force switches, after which Tentacruel should either set hazards or switch to a counter. Don't be too careless when switching Tentacruel in, and don't let it get worn down too quickly, especially if you urgently need to remove hazards. Spreading burns with Scald is another good way to force switches and ease Tentacruel's matchup against physical attackers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tentacruel fits well on balance and stall teams, alongside Quagsire and Alomomola. The former can help beat setup sweepers that take advantage of Tentacruel's passiveness, such as Bisharp, while the latter can keep Tentacruel healthy with Wish. Tentacruel pairs well with Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock, such as Volcanion and Gyarados. Rotom-W is a good partner thanks to its immunity to Ground and ability to help spread burns with Will-O-Wisp. Lanturn can keep Tentacruel free from status with Heal Bell and provides an Electric immunity, though it does exacerbate the Ground weakness. Swampert, on the other hand, can be a superior option for an Electric-immune teammate, as it provides Stealth Rock and is often physically defensive, being able to switch into physical attackers for Tentacruel. Tail Glow Manaphy and Belly Drum Azumarill can take advantage of the switches Tentacruel forces by setting up. Wallbreakers such as Crawdaunt and Volcanion also pair well with Tentacruel due to their ability to take advantage of Toxic Spikes. They also appreciate Tentacruel's Grass neutrality and ability to switch into Mega Venusaur. Mega Sharpedo can also take advantage of said hazard; it helps turn some of its 2HKOs into OHKOs and it can stall with Protect, causing the foe to take accumulating poison damage.</p>"

  "Slowbro": {
    "overview": "<h3>Psychic</h3> <p>Slowbro is easily the best option for a physical wall on Psychic teams. Its excellent physical bulk allows it to switch into physical attackers, such as Terrakion and Landorus-T, and threaten them with Scald or Thunder Wave. Slowbro's bulk also allows it to tank U-turn, which Psychic teams are especially weak to. Because it acts as a blanket check to physical attackers, Slowbro supports offensive Psychic-types really well, as they tend to have a low Defense stat. Slowbro has access to Regenerator, making it a great defensive pivot. It also has access to reliable recovery in Slack Off, making it a great defensive wall in general and maximizing its setup sweeping potential. It has a decent base 100 Special Attack stat and access to good coverage moves such as Fire Blast, Grass Knot, and Ice Beam. However, Slowbro's lackluster Special Defense makes it vulnerable to common special attackers such as Mega Gardevoir and Mega Charizard Y. Its useful Water typing allows it to act as a great check to Water-types such as Kingdra, which would otherwise break through Psychic teams with their powerful STAB Hydro Pump; however, it adds a weakness to Electric- and Grass-type moves, allowing Pokemon like Thundurus and Breloom to check it effectively. It has a terrible Speed stat, which leaves it outsped by almost the entire metagame and makes it vulnerable to Taunt. Slowbro is also very weak to status ailments such as burn and poison, as they hinder its ability to act as a defensive pivot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Psychic</h4> <p>Toxic can be considered over Thunder Wave, as it allows Slowbro to whittle down walls such as Porygon2 that defensive Slowbro cannot touch; however, Psychic teams prefer Slowbro crippling faster threats such as Choice Scarf Kyurem-B with paralysis, allowing wallbreakers such as Mega Gallade and Latios to clean up more easily.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Psychic</h4> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Common coverage moves, such as Fusion Bolt from Life Orb Kyurem-B, Solar Beam from Mega Charizard Y, and Thunderbolt from Mega Latias, all deal massive damage to Slowbro, with some even OHKOing it such as Thunderbolt from Thundurus.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Most special wallbreakers, such as Latios and Mega Gardevoir, can take advantage of Slowbro's mediocre Special Defense and put a dent in it with their strong STAB attacks; however, they hate being paralyzed by Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status conditions such as burns and Toxic poison limit Slowbro's ability to switch into physical attackers. Toxic in particular puts Slowbro on a timer and prevents it from stalling out Pokemon with Slack Off.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Stallbreakers like Gliscor and Mew can cripple Slowbro with Taunt, which prevents it from recovering health, inflict status on it, and continually recover health with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-type Pokemon, such as Serperior and Mega Venusaur, can switch into Slowbro and OHKO it with their Grass-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types like Mega Manectric, Magnezone, and Raikou can easily KO Slowbro with their strong Electric-type STAB moves and are immune to Thunder Wave. Volt Switch also allows Electric-types to take advantage of Slowbro and gain momentum.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: Bug-type Pokemon, such as Volcarona, Scolipede, and Heracross, can deal a huge chunk of damage with their STAB moves; however, most of them do not like switching into Scald.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-type Pokemon, such as Latios and Hydreigon, aren't bothered by Slowbro's STAB or coverage moves and can retaliate with their own strong STAB moves; however, they need to be wary of Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Offensive Ghost-types such as Chandelure and Gengar can easily KO Slowbro with their strong STAB Shadow Ball but need to be wary of Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-type Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Sharpedo can KO Slowbro with their strong Dark-type STAB moves; however, they need to play around the Colbur Berry set.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Colbur Berry": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is an extremely spammable STAB move due to its chance to burn the foe. Grass Knot is Slowbro's preferred coverage move, which in conjunction with Colbur Berry allows it to handle several threats to Psychic teams such as Mega Sharpedo and Mega Gyarados, as well as Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Seismitoad that would otherwise wall Slowbro. Thunder Wave gives Slowbro utility in paralyzing faster Pokemon and Scald switch-ins such as Choice Scarf Victini and Latios, respectively, as well as certain threats such as Mega Sharpedo and Hydreigon. Alternatively, other coverage options can be run; Fire Blast hits Bisharp, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor, whereas Ice Beam hits Dragon-types in general. It's fine to drop Thunder Wave, as Slowbro has the coverage to check the Pokemon Thunder Wave targets, primarily Mega Sharpedo. Slack Off is Slowbro's most reliable form of recovery, allowing it to stay healthy enough to check Dark-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The investment in HP and Defense along with a Bold nature allows Slowbro to switch into and check many physical attackers such as Choice Band Terrakion and Mega Gallade. 12 EVs in Special Defense let Slowbro avoid the OHKO from a Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor from Kingdra. Colbur Berry allows Slowbro to deal with a plethora of threats to Psychic teams; with Colbur Berry, it can revenge kill Mega Gyarados and Mega Sharpedo with Grass Knot, revenge kill Bisharp with Fire Blast, and paralyze Hydreigon with Thunder Wave without fear of taking significant damage from a Dark-type move. Regenerator heals Slowbro every time it switches out, allowing it to act as a great defensive pivot.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Slowbro should be used as a defensive pivot, switching into physical attackers that it threatens such as Mega Lopunny. With Regenerator, Slowbro can be used to switch into and scout Choice-locked foes with reduced negative repercussions, and then switch back out to the appropriate partner. The Colbur Berry should be preserved in matchups against threats such as Mega Gyarados and Mega Sharpedo. Slowbro should be careful when switching into Mega Sharpedo or Mega Gyarados on a prediction, as losing the Berry early can be a death sentence. Thunder Wave should be used on threats such as Hydreigon and healthy Mega Sharpedo. It also lets Slowbro neutralize sweepers in an emergency and allow its teammates to deal with them more easily. Grass Knot should be used to deal with Mega Gyarados, as it generally runs Substitute or Taunt, rendering Thunder Wave useless. Slowbro should be wary of weak Dark-type moves from Pokemon like Mandibuzz, as it wastes the Colbur Berry.</p> <p>In other matchups, it is recommended that Slowbro switch into Knock Off and U-turn users that threaten Psychic-types, such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Choice Band Mamoswine, as it can check them exceptionally well with Colbur Berry. Residual damage from entry hazards, status, or previous attacks can prevent Slowbro from checking threats such as Choice Specs Hydreigon. Therefore, Slowbro should avoid taking too much damage and use Slack Off liberally to stay healthy. Slowbro shouldn't be left in against setup sweepers that it can't touch, such as Lum Berry Bisharp, which it cannot effectively check without Fire Blast, and Calm Mind Clefable.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Many frail wallbreakers that are weak to priority moves, particularly Sucker Punch, appreciate Slowbro as a defensive partner. Mega Gallade can break through defensive Pokemon that normally wall or threaten Slowbro such as Chansey and Ferrothorn. Mega Gardevoir, in conjunction with Slowbro, can easily dismantle Dark teams. It can also help preserve Slowbro's Colbur Berry by removing weaker Dark-types such as Mandibuzz. Mega Gardevoir also beats many Dragon-types that threaten Slowbro, such as Latios. Choice Scarf Gardevoir can check the same Pokemon in addition to weather sweepers that Slowbro cannot switch into, such as Choice Band Excadrill and Choice Specs Kingdra. Victini, especially a Choice Scarf variant, is also a great partner to Slowbro by checking the Grass- and Bug-type Pokemon that threaten Slowbro such as Breloom, Heracross, and Volcarona. Choice Scarf Victini can also finish off a weakened Mega Gyarados with Bolt Strike if Slowbro goes down prematurely. Latios and Latias are great partners, as they can Defog away entry hazards, letting Slowbro switch into attacks more easily. This is particularly relevant due to this Slowbro set's lack of passive recovery from Leftovers. Latias can also support Slowbro with Healing Wish. Jirachi is a good defensive complement, as it can easily switch into strong special moves that threaten Slowbro out, such as Draco Meteor and Hyper Voice from Latios and Mega Gardevoir, respectively, due to its great defensive typing. As it tends to be setup bait for Mega Scizor and Bisharp, Jirachi appreciates having Fire Blast Slowbro as a partner. Mew is another great defensive Pokemon with access to a variety of utility moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Knock Off, and Taunt. Its stallbreaker set allows it to break through defensive Pokemon that Slowbro cannot touch, such as Chansey and Porygon2. With significant Speed investment, Mew can cripple Bisharp and Mega Gyarados with Will-O-Wisp, lessening the pressure on Slowbro.</p>"

  "Chansey": {
    "overview": "<p>Chansey is the best specially defensive wall in the metagame thanks to its great HP and Eviolite-boosted Special Defense. It forms one of the most powerful defensive cores with Porygon2, helping it fit onto almost any balance Normal team. Access to Soft-Boiled and Natural Cure easily keeps Chansey healthy and makes it incredibly difficult to chip down. Chansey is also the only reliable entry hazard user for balance teams, as it's able to set up the all-important Stealth Rock. In addition to this, Chansey can use many forms of utility: it can flexibly use either Thunder Wave or Toxic to support the team as it is needed. With Eviolite, Chansey actually still has acceptable physical bulk. However, this makes Chansey very reliant on Eviolite, and it can be completely crippled without it. Strong physical attackers such as Choice Band Dragonite are also much too powerful for it to stop, even with Eviolite's defensive boosts. Stallbreakers and Taunt users such as Mew and Sableye can easily beat Chansey, as it is very passive outside of its use of Seismic Toss and a potential status move.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Chansey can use an alternative spread of 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD to improve its mixed bulk but will take more damage from physical attackers, making it generally less useful. A Wish + Protect set can be used to pass huge Wishes to Chansey's teammates, but its delayed nature makes it less reliable for Chansey's own healing than Soft-Boiled, and it takes up more moveslots. Heal Bell is an option that lets Chansey cleanse the status of its team, but it does leave Chansey much more vulnerable to setup sweepers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Stallbreakers such as Mew and Gliscor are impossible for Chansey to handle, as they either can use Taunt or are immune to status, rendering Chansey incapable of stopping them from either setting up or slowly whittling it down.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Trick</strong>: Knock Off and Trick will cripple Chansey and make it much more difficult for it to switch into attacks, so users such as Bisharp, Tornadus-T, Mamoswine, Choice Scarf Gardevoir, and Choice Scarf Latias should be avoided at all costs.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Mega Gallade and Terrakion will eat right through Chansey's impressive defenses and take it down without a problem.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: By hitting Chansey on its lower Defense, the likes of Choice Band Dragonite and Diggersby can easily break it.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Although Chansey can cripple some setup sweepers, others such as Rain Dance Manaphy, Belly Drum Azumarill, Lum Berry Dragonite, and Mega Gyarados can generally ignore and set up on it.</p>",

Thunder Wave and Toxic are both very useful for punishing setup sweepers that try to take advantage of Chansey, such as Mega Gallade, Mega Pinsir, and Dragonite. Toxic works well with Chansey's stall-like nature and helps it cripple and combat opposing walls, such as Zapdos, on its own, while Thunder Wave is useful for slowing down fast threats, such as Victini.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread minimizes Stealth Rock damage and makes Chansey as physically bulky as possible, helping it survive powerful hits such as Terrakion's Close Combat after Stealth Rock damage and Mega Lopunny's High Jump Kick. Natural Cure removes any status effects Chansey may have when it switches out, allowing it to be a great status absorber and almost impossible to permanently cripple. Eviolite gives Chansey a huge boost to its Defense and Special Defense, making it an almost unbreakable special wall.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pivot Chansey into special attackers and opposing walls, like Mega Charizard Y and Gastrodon, as neither are actually capable of beating it, and set up Stealth Rock as soon as possible to start dealing chip damage. Spreading status is Chansey's second objective, as it can easily start paralyzing or poisoning its switch-ins, making it even more difficult to check. Once a foe has been hit by a status move, Chansey can slowly whittle it down with Seismic Toss. Don't be afraid to trade status conditions with opposing walls, as Chansey can often beat the likes of Zapdos and Gastrodon thanks to Natural Cure. Make sure to keep Chansey as healthy as possible, so use Soft-Boiled whenever necessary, and be willing to switch out to cure any debilitating status effects. A weakened Chansey cannot switch into attacks as easily, which may make it more difficult to find opportunities to heal. Although Chansey can cripple some setup sweepers with status, those with Substitute or Taunt, such as Mega Gyarados, have little to fear from Chansey, and Chansey should not try to challenge them. Beware of Knock Off and Trick users, such as Bisharp and Choice Scarf Latios, as Chansey is incredibly reliant on Eviolite's boosts. Try to avoid physical attackers whenever possible, as even with the most possible physical bulk, Chansey can still be broken by the likes of Choice Band Diggersby.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Chansey's ability to switch into special wallbreakers such as Landorus makes it pair best with physical walls, so Staraptor and Porygon2 are common teammates. Staraptor's use of Intimidate makes it a great switch-in to physical attackers such as Mega Sharpedo. It also serves as a fantastic Knock Off switch-in and can use Defog to clear entry hazards that can wear down Chansey. Staraptor's STAB Brave Bird also helps it check Fighting-types that beat Chansey. Porygon2's impressive mixed bulk allows it to check mixed attackers, such as Life Orb Kyurem-B. It can also use Foul Play to check sweepers that try to set up on Chansey, like Mega Scizor. Choice Scarf Ditto is another great option for soft checking many setup sweepers, as it can copy any boosts they might get and try to sweep the opposing team with its higher Speed. Mega Lopunny is one of the best Knock Off absorbers, as it both carries a Mega Stone and resists Dark-type moves. Meloetta is a fantastic offensive teammate for Chansey thanks to its unique typing and coverage, being able to use Psychic and Shadow Ball to check the likes of Doublade with ease. Diggersby has almost no defensive utility, but its incredible power makes it capable of defeating stallbreakers that beat Chansey like Gliscor.</p>"

  "Starmie": {
    "overview": "<h3>Water</h3> <p>Starmie is a premier addition to most Water teams thanks to its fantastic Speed and decent Special Attack stat. Its Speed lets it outspeed and KO many threats to Water teams such as Mega Diancie, Breloom, and Landorus. In addition to this, Starmie's Psychic typing makes it one of the few Mega Venusaur checks on Water that can also revenge kill Serperior. Other than its STAB moves, it has good coverage in Thunderbolt and Ice Beam. To complement its great movepool, Starmie has a fantastic ability in Analytic, which lets it capitalize on the fact that it can force switches and punish incoming foes. Starmie is not lacking on the support side either, as it can function as a reliable offensive Rapid Spin user and has access to Recover to improve its longevity. However, it is hugely let down by its rather average bulk, which makes it vulnerable to attacks from offensive Pokemon like Mega Gardevoir and Dragonite. Starmie's Psychic typing comes with drawbacks as well, as it makes Starmie weak to common moves like Knock Off, U-turn, and Sucker Punch. Without Natural Cure, Starmie is worn down very easily if inflicted with status effects like burn or poison, which, in accumulation with Life Orb damage and entry hazards, makes it very vulnerable to faster revenge killers and priority moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Water</h4> <p>Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Scizor. Power Gem can be used to OHKO Mega Charizard Y in the sun, though outside of that, it has no real use, as it can't even outdamage an unresisted Hydro Pump. A defensive set with Toxic and Recover can be used; however, it is very situational and Water teams prefer Starmie's offensive set more.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Water</h4> <p><strong>Jellicent</strong>: Jellicent is a reliable counter to Starmie. It can spinblock, is immune to Hydro Pump, and can easily switch into Psychic even after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Pokemon like Chansey, Mew, and Gastrodon easily take all of Starmie's attacks and can stall it out with Life Orb damage or Thunder Wave it. However, they fear Toxic from the rare defensive set.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, Weavile, and Choice Scarf Heracross outspeed Starmie and KO it. However, none of them like to switch into any of its attacks.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-type Pokemon such as Raikou, Zapdos, and Mega Ampharos all can take at least one hit from Starmie and OHKO back with a Thunderbolt, while faster threats like Mega Manectric outspeed and KO it. However, all of these Pokemon are checks to Starmie, as none of them can come in on its Analytic-boosted attacks.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Although most Grass-types can't switch into an Ice Beam from Starmie, most of them can easily tank one and KO back. Cradily, Celebi, and Ferrothorn all tank an Ice Beam from Starmie and KO back with their respective moves.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-type Pokemon like Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Weavile both outspeed Starmie and OHKO it, while Bisharp can play mind games with Sucker Punch and Knock Off. However, none of these Pokemon can switch into Starmie's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Unless Starmie is running Natural Cure, Life Orb damage in conjunction with entry hazard damage and status effects like burn and poison easily wear down Starmie, making it vulnerable to faster Pokemon and priority moves, while paralysis hinders its Speed greatly.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb Attacker (Water)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is Starmie's strongest move and lets it beat Ground-, Fire-, and Rock-type Pokemon like Hippowdon, Torkoal, and Mega Diancie. Psychic is Starmie's secondary STAB move and allows Starmie to beat Fighting-type Pokemon such as Breloom and Heracross while also being a 100% accurate STAB move. It is used over Psyshock to deal more damage to Mega Venusaur, which is a threat to most Water teams. Ice Beam lets Starmie threaten Flying- and Dragon-type Pokemon like Dragonite and Landorus, and it also hits Grass-types like Serperior super effectively. Rapid Spin allows Starmie to clear away entry hazards for its teammates. Thunderbolt can be used to threaten opposing Water- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Charizard, Gyarados, and Skarmory. Recover can be used as an alternative to Rapid Spin to increase Starmie's longevity for teams that already have an entry hazard remover.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature lets Starmie outspeed threats like Landorus, Latios, and Serperior. Maximum Special Attack investment lets Starmie hit as hard as it can without a boosting nature. Life Orb increases Starmie's Special Attack even more at the cost of losing a bit of HP at the end of every successful attack. Analytic is used to punish Pokemon that try to switch into Starmie, particularly faster threats, by boosting the power of the move it uses. 29 HP IVs are used to drop Starmie's HP value to 259; this reduces Starmie's Life Orb recoil from 26 to 25 at the cost of 2 HP points.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Starmie's wide movepool lets it be useful in almost every matchup. You should take advantage of this and try to weaken the opposing team as much as possible with it. Since Starmie's bulk is rather average, it should be sent out when a teammate faints or against a low HP foe that it outspeeds. Starmie functions great both early-game and late-game. Its good offensive movepool lets it weaken and KO most Pokemon, allowing its teammates to clean up later, while its good Speed lets it clean up late-game. Make use of Analytic and try to predict what the opponent is going to switch into, as most of the time, an Analytic-boosted hit will render most walls weakened. As Starmie will most of the time be the only form of hazard control on Water teams, Rapid Spin should be used liberally to get rid of entry hazards. If running Analytic, Starmie should avoid residual damage from status effects, as along with Life Orb damage, it will wear down Starmie very easily.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Most Water-types appreciate Starmie's ability to clear away entry hazards and wallbreak, letting it fit on most offensive teams easily. Empoleon can set up Stealth Rock for Starmie to help weaken opposing foes. Empoleon especially appreciates Starmie running Rapid Spin, as it then doesn't have to waste a moveslot on Defog and can run a more useful move. Along with Empoleon, Tentacruel provides a solid Grass-type move switch-in for Starmie. Tentacruel too can run Rapid Spin, allowing Starmie to run Thunderbolt over it. Tentacruel also can run Toxic Spikes to wear down walls that stall out Starmie. Lanturn and Swampert provide an Electric immunity for Starmie. Lanturn can even help with Starmie's problem with status effects through Heal Bell and pivot it in safely through Volt Switch, while Mega Swampert can set up Rain Dance or Stealth Rock to help Starmie KO Pokemon more easily. Rotom-W provides a Ground immunity and is neutral to Electric-type moves. Rotom-W can pivot out with Volt Switch and wear down Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp, allowing Starmie to clean up later. Keldeo and Azumarill are strong wallbreakers that beat Dark-type Pokemon with their respective secondary STAB moves, while also helping Starmie get past walls like Chansey and Porygon2. In return, Starmie gets rid of Flying-type Pokemon for Keldeo and Poison-type Pokemon for Azumarill. Mega Gyarados appreciates Starmie's ability to clear away Stealth Rock for it as well as its ability to beat physically defensive Pokemon like Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Mandibuzz. Volcanion is a fantastic partner for Starmie because it helps with Starmie's weakness to Grass-type moves, while Starmie can clear away entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, for Volcanion. Mega Sharpedo and Crawdaunt appreciate Starmie's ability to clear out Fighting-type Pokemon for them. On the other hand, Crawdaunt and Mega Sharpedo can beat Ghost-type Pokemon that might trouble Starmie.</p>"

  "Pinsir": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Pinsir is easily one of the most dangerous setup sweepers in the Monotype metagame thanks to its amazing Attack, good Speed, and access to Swords Dance. It has a great ability in Aerilate, which makes all of its Normal-type moves become Flying-type while giving them a boost, making Return a powerful STAB move and granting Mega Pinsir an excellent priority STAB move in Quick Attack. Furthermore, Mega Pinsir has access to good coverage moves such as Close Combat and Earthquake to hit Steel-types like Heatran, Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Bisharp, as well as Rock-type Pokemon like Tyranitar and Cradily. Its decent bulk lets it set up Swords Dance against most non-super effective attacks. However, Mega Pinsir's severe weakness to Stealth Rock heavily reduces its sweeping chances. It is also reliant on team support to break through its checks and counters. Mega Pinsir also has no form of recovery, which reduces its longevity even more. Furthermore, any type of status effect heavily compromises Mega Pinsir's sweeping capabilities.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An Adamant nature can be used with Sticky Web support from Galvantula, although this lets Mega Pinsir get outsped by airborne Pokemon such as Mega Charizard, which it would generally outspeed after Mega Evolution. It is also very reliant on Galvantula to set up Sticky Web. Hyper Cutter can be used over Moxie, although Intimidate isn't too common and it is more situational than Moxie.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Fast Electric-types such as Thundurus, Mega Manectric, Raikou, and Choice Scarf Rotom-W all outspeed Mega Pinsir and KO it with their STAB moves while taking resisted damage from Quick Attack. Thundurus in particular can paralyze Mega Pinsir with Thunder Wave, while defensive Rotom-W can take all of Mega Pinsir's attacks and burn it with Will-O-Wisp in return. Physically defensive Zapdos can also take all of Mega Pinsir's attacks and KO back with a STAB Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Doublade</strong>: Doublade completely walls Mega Pinsir if it isn't running Earthquake and can proceed to set up on it safely.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Physically defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Skarmory can take a Swords Dance-boosted hit and phaze Mega Pinsir with Whirlwind. Skarmory can even KO Mega Pinsir if it is weakened through Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status effects such as burn, poison, and paralysis can heavily hinder Mega Pinsir's sweeping capabilities. A burn will halve Mega Pinsir's Attack, while poison will cripple it and paralysis will quarter its Speed.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pinsir's Speed stat isn't particularly amazing before Mega Evolution. This makes it vulnerable to faster Pokemon such as Kyurem-B, Landorus-T, and Excadrill, as they are not weak to a Quick Attack from Mega Pinsir. Pokemon such as Terrakion, Thundurus, and Tornadus-T can outspeed Mega Pinsir and OHKO it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock pressures Mega Pinsir's chances to switch in, as it will heavily reduce its HP. This hinders its chances to sweep.</p>",

      "Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance increases Mega Pinsir's Attack tremendously and makes Mega Pinsir a great sweeper and late-game cleaner. Return is Mega Pinsir's main STAB attack, as it is boosted by Aerilate. Close Combat lets Mega Pinsir hit Pokemon such as Heatran, Tyranitar, and other Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon. Quick Attack is used to make Mega Pinsir a revenge killer. It also helps Mega Pinsir avoid getting revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Mega Gallade. Earthquake can be used over Close Combat to hit Doublade and Fire-type Pokemon such as Heatran, Torkoal, and Volcanion, although using Earthquake means Skarmory will easily wall Mega Pinsir.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack EV investment lets Mega Pinsir hit as hard as possible. A Jolly nature with maximum Speed EVs is used to make it as fast as it can possibly be and to outspeed the crowded base 100 Speed tier. Moxie gives Mega Pinsir an Attack boost by KOing a low-HP foe through Quick Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Pinsir is a great late-game sweeper and should generally be kept healthy until its checks and counters have been gotten rid of. Pinsir can be sent out against low-HP foes to get off the Mega Evolution safely or to get a Moxie boost. Quick Attack, in particular, lets Pinsir Mega Evolve safely against low-HP foes while KOing them. Mega Pinsir can set up with Swords Dance against non-super effective hits due to its decent bulk. Its ability to force switches can be used as a way to set up Swords Dance. Mega Pinsir can be used as an revenge killer thanks to its Aerilate-boosted Quick Attack. While it should generally wait until late-game to sweep, it can definitely still boost with Swords Dance early-game to gain wallbreaking power. This lets it weaken its checks for its later sweep. Pinsir's Mega Evolution can be delayed if there is Stealth Rock on the field or to take Rock-, Ice-, and Electric-type moves better. However, Mega Pinsir has far better Speed than non-Mega Pinsir, so it may be best in some cases to Mega Evolve early to get that Speed increase. Even though Pinsir can revenge kill a low-HP foe and gain a Moxie boost, it's not something that should be relied upon or sought after too hard. Letting a check switch into Pinsir may be a risk not worth the potential Attack boost. As it is 4x weak to Stealth Rock, it should not be sent out while Stealth Rock is still in the field. Mega Pinsir should not be kept in against checks such as Skarmory and physically defensive Zapdos, and it should avoid Pokemon that can use status moves, because even if it sets up on them, being hit by status can be sweep ending.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As it is severely weak to Stealth Rock after Mega Evolution, some form of entry hazard control is definitely a must. Forretress works as a Rapid Spin user while also being able to set up its own Stealth Rock and even Spikes. Forretress can also use Volt Switch to pivot out for Mega Pinsir and Explosion to weaken Pokemon for Mega Pinsir. Armaldo can be used over Forretress, as Armaldo too can Rapid Spin and set up its own Stealth Rock while being able to beat Pokemon like Zapdos on Flying-type teams with its Rock-type STAB moves. Galvantula can set up Sticky Web for Mega Pinsir, which lowers the Speed of opposing grounded foes. This lets Pinsir use an Adamant nature and also outspeed Pokemon such as Cobalion and Weavile after the Speed drop. If used with Jolly-natured Mega Pinsir, it can outspeed Choice Scarf base 100 Speed Pokemon, which is an important reason to still use Jolly over an Adamant nature, as being outsped by Choice Scarf Victini can be problematic. Galvantula also beats Skarmory, which would normally wall Mega Pinsir. Heracross is an excellent partner for Mega Pinsir, as both of them act as sweepers. This lets either Mega Pinsir or Heracross weaken their shared checks so that the other one can clean up late-game. Heracross also takes off pressure from Mega Pinsir against defensive Pokemon. Volcarona and Mega Pinsir work great together, as Volcarona can get rid of Skarmory for Mega Pinsir, while Mega Pinsir can get rid of Heatran for Volcarona. Scizor is another great partner for Mega Pinsir, as it can pivot with U-turn and find opportunities to bring in Mega Pinsir safely while also weakening the foe. Scizor also helps against Rock-types such as Terrakion, Mega Diancie, and Mega Aerodactyl, which would normally trouble Mega Pinsir.</p>"

  "Gyarados": {
    "overview": "<h3>Water</h3> <p>Access to a great setup move in Dragon Dance, a plethora of utility moves including Taunt and Substitute, and a fearsome Attack stat all help to set Gyarados apart from other physically offensive Pokemon on Water-type teams. With Intimidate to help it take physical hits even better, Flying-type coverage to beat Grass-types, notably Mega Venusaur, and a Ground-type immunity that Water teams have a lack of, Gyarados proves itself to be a valuable member to any Water-type team. That being said, its weakness to Stealth Rock and a 4x weakness to Electric hold it back. It suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, as it has access to excellent coverage moves, including Earthquake and Ice Fang, yet to use those, it has to miss out on either Substitute, which makes setting up much easier, or one of its STAB moves. It is unable to make use of its various good defensive traits, such as its helpful Ground-type immunity, its ability Intimidate, and its decent bulk, because of a lack of reliable recovery.</p> <p>Upon Mega Evolving, Mega Gyarados gains Mold Breaker, letting it break through annoying abilities such as Sturdy and Unaware. It gains an increase in defensive stats that helps in creating more opportunities to set up. It boasts a very high Attack stat coupled with a STAB combination that can create pressure on any team lacking a Pokemon that resists both. STAB Crunch in particular threatens Psychic-type teams greatly and limits possible switch-ins. Despite that, Mega Gyarados has a mediocre Speed stat when unboosted and gets worn down rather quickly because of its weakness to Stealth Rock while non-Mega. It also loses its immunity to Ground and becomes weak to Bug-, Fairy-, and Fighting-type moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Water</h4> <p>RestTalk Mega Gyarados is an alternative option to set up on walls such as Porygon2 and Chansey. However, it is very matchup dependent and is usually outclassed by standard offensive Mega Gyarados. Specially defensive Gyarados makes use of its support movepool, including Thunder Wave and Dragon Tail, along with Intimidate. Yet, just like RestTalk, it is extremely matchup dependent and useless in most games. On regular offensive Gyarados, Life Orb and Lum Berry are options to reach maximum power and get a free turn to set up a Dragon Dance against status moves users, respectively. However, those items fail to capitalize on Water-type teams' defensive synergy and are outshined by Leftovers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Water</h4> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types find it easy to revenge kill Mega Gyarados.

Both can recover their HP back easily while doing considerable damage to Gyarados.</p> <p><strong>Phazers</strong>: Gyarados requires Dragon Dance to become a significant threat and moves that force it out can completely shut it down. The Taunt variant can prevent Whirlwind and Roar, however.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types overall find it easy to shut down both Gyarados and Mega Gyarados. Some particularly annoying Fairy-types for Gyarados are Klefki, Clefable, Whimsicott, and Azumarill.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: Mega Venusaur can take on Mega Gyarados without taking much damage from Crunch while healing it back with Giga Drain.

      "Mega Dragon Dance (Water)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance bolsters Mega Gyarados's Attack and Speed stat to insane levels. Crunch is its primary STAB move that can hit hard with its fearsome Attack stat. Waterfall is the other STAB move, which Mega Gyarados mainly uses to hit Pokemon that resist Crunch or are weak to Waterfall. There are few Pokemon in the metagame that can switch in safely on its STAB combination after a Dragon Dance. Substitute eases prediction, protects Mega Gyarados from most status moves when setting up Dragon Dance, and allows it to set up on passive Pokemon. Earthquake is a decent option over Substitute to hit Electric-types, notably Rotom-W and Magnezone, bypassing Levitate and Sturdy thanks to Mold Breaker. Being able to hit Azumarill for neutral damage grants it another niche. However, Substitute's utility usually makes it the superior option, as being able to avoid status and set up on passive Pokemon is a lot more helpful in most matchups. Using Taunt over Substitute or Earthquake prevents Whirlwind and Roar users from phazing Mega Gyarados. It's also another option to prevent status moves, but it fails to protect Mega Gyarados from Scald burns and Prankster users such as Klefki, Thundurus, and Sableye. Ice Fang over Earthquake or Substitute hits Dragon- and Grass-types that take little damage from Crunch, notably Hydreigon, bulky Garchomp, and Breloom. However, Gyarados prefers Substitute by a lot, as it makes setting up Dragon Dances much easier, while Earthquake provides the much more needed coverage against Electric-types, as well as having far better Base Power compared to Ice Fang.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Intimidate is the preferred ability over Moxie, as it creates more opportunities for Mega Gyarados to set up a Substitute or a Dragon Dance. Maximum Attack and Speed EVs allow Mega Gyarados to make full use of its offensive potential. A Jolly nature permits it to outspeed Mega Manectric, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Beedrill after a Dragon Dance as well as Choice Scarf Gardevoir, Togekiss, and Hoopa-U. An Adamant nature can be used instead if you prefer the increase in power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Gyarados should not be switched in continuously while Stealth Rock is up, as it does not appreciate being worn down quickly, with its lack of access to recovery. Always Mega Evolve wisely. In some cases, it is much more preferable to preserve Intimidate and the Ground-type immunity, while in others you would like to remove the Stealth Rock weakness and be immune to Psychic-type moves. It can also create 50/50s with certain Pokemon like Mega Diancie. As said before, preserving Mega Gyarados's health can be the key to winning the game. If you set up while a check or a counter is still around, you will be forced to switch out and may not get any opportunities to set up a Dragon Dance again. Status heavily hinders Mega Gyarados. Burn halves its damage output, while paralysis allows common wallbreakers to outspeed and OHKO it. Toxic can wear it down quickly, something it dislikes. While Substitute manages to protect Mega Gyarados from most status moves, moves with secondary effects like Discharge, priority Will-O-Wisp from Sableye, and Stun Spore from Whimsicott, can inflict status on it before it sets up a Substitute. Mega Gyarados can take advantage of Choice-locked foes to easily set up. The likes of a Dark-type STAB move-using Hoopa-U or a Draco Meteor-locked -2 Choice Scarf Latios are prime examples.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swampert's immunity to Electric-type moves sets it apart from other Stealth Rock users available on Water. Tentacruel is an amazing option as a teammate for Mega Gyarados, being able to Rapid Spin away entry hazards that wear down Mega Gyarados very quickly. It also counters Clefable very well, something that threatens Mega Gyarados, and takes most other Fairy-type attacks easily. Toxic Spikes can very easily cripple most of Mega Gyarados's checks and counters, and Tentacruel is the premier user of it on Water. Choice Band Azumarill lures in and takes out most walls that Mega Gyarados can't do much against such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory; its Waterfall 2HKOes Skarmory after Stealth Rock damage. It also takes Fighting-type moves such as Close Combat from Terrakion easily and hits back with Play Rough. Lanturn is another Electric-immune Pokemon that helps Mega Gyarados by being able to Heal Bell away the status ailments that heavily hinder Mega Gyarados. It also helps it set up by providing a slow Volt Switch to safely bring it in. Empoleon is an alternative option as a Stealth Rock user, also being able to use Defog. It takes Fairy-type hits that threaten Mega Gyarados and removes Stealth Rock so it doesn't get worn down too quickly. However, using Empoleon stacks the Fighting-type weakness, and thus it is wise to have a Pokemon with Fighting-type resistance such as Azumarill along with it. Starmie is the best option for an offensive Rapid Spin user. Its Analytic-boosted attacks can create holes in the opponent's team, and it takes down Mega Venusaur, something that Mega Gyarados fails to break through. Choice Specs Volcanion can break Mega Venusaur as well. Moreover, it beats Ferrothorn and makes it much easier for Mega Gyarados to prepare a late-game sweep.</p>"

      "Dragon Dance (Water)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance boosts Gyarados's Attack and Speed to let it sweep easily. Waterfall is its primary STAB move that benefits from Dragon Dance. Bounce provides Flying-type coverage, which is extremely important to hit Grass-types. Substitute makes setting up Dragon Dance much easier, as it allows Gyarados to avoid status moves such as Thunder Wave, Will-O-Wisp, and Toxic. It also protects Gyarados from Scald burns.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>168 Speed EVs coupled with a Jolly nature allow unboosted Gyarados to outspeed Breloom and go for Bounce, which maximum Speed EVs with an Adamant nature fail to do. The EVs not put in Speed are instead put in HP to improve its overall bulk. If the slight increase in bulk isn't desired, the EVs can be put in Speed to allow Gyarados to outspeed Hoopa-U when unboosted and Choice Scarf Togekiss and Gardevoir after a Dragon Dance. Leftovers is the best item on this set, as Gyarados lacks any other reliable recovery and gaining health while it sets up Dragon Dance or Substitute is very helpful. It also works well in tandem with Bounce, as it gains HP on the turn it uses the move. Intimidate is the preferred ability, as it makes it easier to set up and sweep.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gyarados usually should not be sent in while Stealth Rock is up, as it does not like to get worn down too quickly. Make sure to get it out of the way before sending it in. Setting up while its checks and counters are still healthy is a bad idea because repeatedly switching it in and out lowers its health very quickly, and it rarely manages to find an opportunity to set up again. That being said, this Gyarados set can be sent in early-game to make use of Intimidate and support the team. Status badly hinders Gyarados and leaves it practically useless throughout the match unless you have Heal Bell support. Burn makes it too weak to cause damage, while paralysis leaves it slow enough to get outsped by most wallbreakers. Playing safely and going for Substitute against anything that could possibly inflict status on Gyarados is usually the right play. When using Bounce, make sure that the opponent doesn't have Substitute or any way to boost its stats, as Bounce basically provides the foe with a free turn to set up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swampert provides Stealth Rock to break Focus Sashes or Sturdy and wear Pokemon down to make it easier for Gyarados to sweep. Another benefit that Swampert provides is the Electric-type immunity, as Gyarados falls to any Electric-type attack even with Intimidate and its decent bulk. Tentacruel's ability to set up Toxic Spikes and Rapid Spin away Stealth Rock makes it a good match, as Gyarados can take the Ground-type moves aimed at it. Azumarill forms a great physical wallbreaking duo with Gyarados, as it lures in and KOes many of Gyarados's counters, such as Ferrothorn (Choice Band Superpower does a huge chunk) and Skarmory (Waterfall 2HKOes after Stealth Rock damage). Gyarados also manages to take down Mega Venusaur for Azumarill, which is very helpful. Using regular Gyarados frees up the Mega slot on the team. As such, Mega Sharpedo can make it much easier for Gyarados to set up and sweep, as it can weaken its checks and counters. Gyarados can also be used to wear down the opponent's team first before letting Mega Sharpedo come in and clean up. Empoleon's Defog support comes in handy when preserving health on Gyarados, as it is weak to Stealth Rock and does not like to get worn down quickly. Volcanion is a excellent special wallbreaker that can support Gyarados by taking out physical walls that it fails to break through. Lanturn helps Gyarados greatly by being able to absorb Electric-type attacks aimed at it. Additionally, being able to whittle down walls such as Porygon2 with Toxic and Heal Bell support makes it a perfect match. Its slow Volt Switch can help Gyarados greatly by being able to safely bring it in. Gyarados is a great fit on Water-type teams lacking a Mega Venusaur check.</p>"

  "Ditto": {
    "overview": "<p>With Imposter and a Choice Scarf, Ditto is an excellent revenge killer on Normal teams that is able to immediately change the outcome of a game. This is thanks to its ability to copy stat boosts of the foe, therefore discouraging the opponent from setting up. Ditto also works well as a scout, easing predictions, and it can also fit onto stall teams that need a Pokemon that can play mind games on and annoy the opposing team. However, the opponent can simply switch out its Pokemon and bring out a counter to the Pokemon that Ditto has transformed into. Furthermore, Ditto's unpredictability might not always be in your favor, as the foe might have a bad moveset to copy, forcing Ditto to switch out due to being dead weight and sapping a lot of momentum. In addition, the opponent knows what set their own Pokemon is running, so they can exploit this by playing around Ditto easily. Ditto's moves also have only 5 PP, so the foe can easily stall them out by using recovery moves. Finally, Ditto does not copy the foe's HP stat, leaving it forced to cope with its own appalling base 48 HP.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ditto is a very straightforward Pokemon that doesn't have many viable alternatives to run, although you can change its happiness from 255 to 0 in case your opponent runs Frustration instead of Return. This is a 50/50 chance, however.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Playing Around Ditto</strong>: Because the opponent knows what set Ditto is running after it has transformed, they can easily switch to a counter to then force Ditto out, or they can send out a Pokemon that can set up on a Ditto that can't do anything to it. The opponent can also play around a Choice-locked Ditto.</p> <p><strong>Untransformable Pokemon</strong>: Ditto cannot transform into Pokemon behind a Substitute, making it a sitting duck, complete setup fodder, and a huge momentum drain.</p> <p><strong>Walls</strong>: Pokemon like Porygon2 and Slowbro are not very useful for Ditto to transform into, as they are not very strong and can stall Ditto out with their recovery moves due to Ditto's low PP.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burns make it hard for Ditto to copy physical attackers and unable to deal much damage. Paralysis cripples Ditto by slowing it down. Accumulating Toxic damage can wear Ditto down quickly.</p>",

      "Revenge Killer": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Transform is simply a filler move, as Imposter does the exact same thing automatically upon switching in.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Choice Scarf is used so that Ditto is able to Speed tie with opposing Choice Scarf users, as well as outspeed non-Choice Scarf users. The given IVs give Ditto Hidden Power Fire. 0 Speed IVs allow Ditto to transform after opposing Ditto, making your Ditto unable to transform into them but at least stay with Transform's 16 PP compared to their copied moves of 5 PP. This, along with a Relaxed nature, also helps with Struggle wars against opposing Ditto. 252 HP EVs minimize damage taken from opposing Ditto's Struggle, although be aware that Ditto does not copy the foe's HP stat when transforming. The remaining EVs are put into Special Defense and Defense for bulk and to further decrease damage taken from opposing Ditto's Struggle.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ditto should transform into sweepers that have already boosted or powerful wallbreakers so that it can potentially sweep the opposing team. Choose what Pokemon to transform into wisely; Pokemon that have access to wide coverage, such as Mega Pinsir, Mega Gallade, and Heatran, are better than Pokemon that either have limited coverage or are a common mono-attacker. Never switch Ditto into attacks, as it is very frail; bring it in after a teammate has fainted or through momentum-gaining moves such as U-turn and Volt Switch. Keep it as healthy as possible in order to ensure a successful sweep. However, it is possible to switch Ditto into a move that the foe is immune to, such as into Gengar's Focus Blast or Heatran's Lava Plume, though your opponent can predict this and foil your plan. Use Ditto to scout the foe's moveset in order to gain information and ease prediction. This can be especially valuble against Pokemon that can run multiple sets, such as Lucario. Copying the movesets of clerics such as Lanturn in order to get access to Heal Bell, or entry hazard removers such as Starmie in order to get access to Rapid Spin, can be a good plan for supporting your team. Although Ditto's limited PP can be a problem, it can take advantage of this by switching in and out, replenishing its PP and thus becoming an effective stallbreaker. Be aware of the fact that Ditto does not copy the foe's HP stat, so don't misinterpret damage calculations due to this. Ditto's Imposter ability removes the Speed drop caused by Sticky Web, allowing it to safely copy wallbreakers that are often paired with Sticky Web users, such as Choice Band Terrakion + Shuckle on Rock teams.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ditto is a great addition to the Chansey + Porygon2 + Staraptor defensive core, as wallbreakers will try their hardest to break through the core, allowing Ditto to transform into them and force them out. Chansey and Porygon2 are both defensive partners that can be switched in if Ditto is forced out, the former being able to relieve Ditto of status with Heal Bell as well. Ditto doesn't only fit on defensive teams, though; it can also be used on offensive teams as a revenge killer. Diggersby, Heliolisk, Staraptor, and Mega Pidgeot can bring Ditto in safely through either U-turn or Volt Switch. Staraptor can also provide Defog support in order to prevent Ditto from being worn down by entry hazards. Ditto is quite unpredictable, so it doesn't really require a lot of support, and can fit well onto many kinds of teams without requiring major synergy.</p>"

  "Zapdos": {
    "overview": "<h3>Flying</h3> <p>Due to its good defensive Electric / Flying typing coupled with its decent defensive stats, Zapdos can act as an excellent specially defensive wall for Flying-type teams. Zapdos also has a great Special Attack stat, which, even when it is running a defensive set, allows it to not be passive and deal respectable damage to its foes. Its STAB Discharge lets it spread paralysis. It also provides crucial entry hazard removal in the form of Defog, which allows it and its teammates to switch in and out more often. Due to its typing, Zapdos is able to take Electric-type attacks that would otherwise threaten Flying teams, as it only takes neutral damage. It is also the only Electric / Flying type that has access to reliable recovery, which it gets in the form of Roost. However, Zapdos's somewhat lacking Defense stat can leave it weak to many physical attackers when running a specially defensive set, which should be taken into consideration when putting it into your team.</p> <h3>Electric</h3> <p>Zapdos acts as a special wall on Electric teams because of its reliable recovery, solid defensive typing, good bulk, and Defog. Thanks to its Ground immunity, Zapdos can situationally switch into Choice-locked Excadrill and wall Hippowdon and Landorus, assuming the latter doesn't have Gravity or Rock Slide. Its resistance to Fighting lets Zapdos tank hits from Mega Gallade and function as a situational switch-in to Heracross. Zapdos can also sponge special attacks from the likes of Latios, Gengar, and Hydreigon and spread status with Discharge and Toxic.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Flying</h4> <p>Substitute allows Zapdos to avoid status and thus act as a stallbreaker through the combination of Toxic and Substitute, allowing to to beat opposing walls that would rely on their own status moves. However, Zapdos struggles to fit Substitute onto its moveset, as it values all of its other moves more.</p> <h4>Electric</h4> <p>Zapdos can run 108 Speed EVs to outpace Jolly base 70 Speed and Adamant base 80 Speed foes like Mamoswine and Dragonite. Hidden Power Ice over Toxic allows Zapdos to lure Pokemon 4x weak to Ice like Dragonite and Mega Garchomp. On Hidden Power Ice sets, Zapdos should opt to run enough Speed to outspeed Adamant Dragonite. However, running Ice-type coverage on Zapdos is unnecessary, as many of its teammates already have it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Flying</h4> <p><strong>Mixed Attackers</strong>: Mixed attackers can prey on Zapdos's weaker Defense stat and hit it for large amounts of damage; for example, Landorus using Rock Slide or Mega Diancie using Diamond Storm greatly threatens Zapdos.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status effects such as Toxic and Will-O-Wisp threaten Zapdos greatly, as they cause residual damage, which Zapdos hates, as it needs to have as much health as possible to be able to reliably check most special attackers.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt prevents Zapdos from using Defog or Roost, leaving it incapable of performing its role on the team.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: While Zapdos has high bulk, it is not able to wall some of the stronger wallbreakers in the metagame, such as Mega Charizard Y and Dragonite. Zapdos also often fails to wall Choice Specs users such as Latios.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Kyurem-B take little damage from both of Zapdos's attacks and hit it back hard with Stone Edge and Ice Beam, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock will cause Zapdos to lose 25% of its health upon switching in, rendering it unable to switch into many common attackers such as Thundurus and Latios. Zapdos is also threatened by some Stealth Rock users such as Tyranitar and Chansey, the latter of which is able to shrug off any attack by Zapdos and cripple it with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Terrakion and Tyranitar take little damage from Zapdos and threaten it with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types such as Mamoswine, Weavile, and Kyurem-B are able to force Zapdos out due to their super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Walls</strong>: If Zapdos is not running any status moves, it often struggles to break through most walls such as Gastrodon and opposing Zapdos.</p> <h4>Electric</h4> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can switch into Zapdos, set Stealth Rock, and wear it down with Toxic and Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Calm Mind + Refresh Mega Latias uses Zapdos as setup fodder. Lum Berry Volcarona can also set up on Zapdos, but it fears Discharge and Toxic after using its Lum Berry.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Wallbreakers like Mega Heracross, Mega Garchomp, and Darmanitan can overwhelm Zapdos.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Stealth Rock, Toxic poison, and burn pressure Zapdos and make it easier to KO.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive (Flying)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog is crucial to this set, as it allows Zapdos to clear entry hazards, particularly Stealth Rock, from its side, which is extremely important for Flying, as most Flying-types are weak to Stealth Rock. Roost is an important move for Zapdos, as it provides it with reliable recovery, giving it the longevity to better utilize its typing and ability to clear hazards from the field. Discharge provides Zapdos with a reliable way to deal damage, and, due to its chance of paralyzing the foe, it can give opponents second thoughts about setting up against Zapdos. Volt Switch is also an option instead of Discharge, as it provides momentum. However, it has a lower Base Power than Discharge; forces Zapdos to keep switching, which can cause it to take heavy damage from Stealth Rock; and leaves Zapdos unable to paralyze foes, which can make it setup bait. Toxic will put foes on a timer, preventing them from stalling and often forcing switches, and helps Zapdos wear down opposing walls. Heat Wave is an option instead of Toxic, as it allows Zapdos to hit Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn, both of which can threaten Flying and switch into Zapdos easily otherwise.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment is used to greatly increase Zapdos's overall bulk. 16 Speed EVs are used to allow Zapdos to outspeed base 70 Speed Pokemon without a boosting nature, such as Adamant Bisharp. The rest of the EVs are put into Special Defense with a Calm nature to allow Zapdos to take as many special hits as possible. There is also the possibility of running an alternative spread of 252 HP / 148 SpD / 108 Spe with a Calm nature, as this allows Zapdos to outspeed maximum Speed base 70 Speed Pokemon with a boosting nature, such as Jolly Bisharp, Cloyster, and Breloom, and then potentially KO them before they get to attack. Pressure is used on this set, as it allows for more effective PP stalling with Roost, which can often be crucial; furthermore, if Static is used, Zapdos cannot use Defog, as it is illegal. Leftovers provides Zapdos with passive recovery, greatly increasing its longevity.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Zapdos can be used as a switch-in to a majority of special attackers including Pokemon like Hydreigon and Thundurus. Its reliable recovery means it is consistently able to switch into these attackers, so you should always try and keep it at full health by making you sure you use Roost as often as possible. However, it is unable to switch into extremely hard-hitting Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y. Zapdos is able to beat many opposing walls through a combination of Toxic and Pressure; Toxic is able to put the foe on a timer, forcing your opponent to either sacrifice the Pokemon or switch it out, while Pressure allows Zapdos to PP stall certain attacks. It is also important to make sure Stealth Rock is off the field as much as possible, as it prevents Zapdos from switching into lots of hits it otherwise would be able to wall, such as Gengar's Shadow Ball and Thundurus's Thunderbolt. This can be done by switching Zapdos in while the foe sets the Stealth Rock and then using Defog immediately. Zapdos is also capable of stalling out Stealth Rock users due to Pressure, as Pressure means Defog has more PP than the foe's Stealth Rock. It is also a good idea to try and spread status with Zapdos as much as possible earlier in the game so as to better support your team. To avoid being worn down too easily, it is best to use Roost often and to avoid status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, as they greatly reduce Zapdos's longevity. Zapdos should feel free to use its Electric-type STAB moves when it's safe, as Discharge's secondary effect of paralyzing can cripple foes and can dissuade switches or punish opponents attempting to switch in Pokemon that would counter Zapdos, whilst Volt Switch gives you momentum against switches and the ability to switch into a counter to whatever the opponent brings in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The most common teammate for Zapdos is Skarmory, as they form the \"SkarmDos\" core, which is seen on most Flying-type teams and is able to wall a majority of the metagame. The two Pokemon work together especially well, as they cover each others weaknesses; Skarmory is able to take Ice- and Rock-type attacks for Zapdos, and Zapdos is able to take Electric-type attacks for Skarmory. Their stats also complement each other, as Zapdos is a great specially defensive wall, and Skarmory is a great physically defensive wall. Thanks to its fantastic Speed tier and access to Knock Off and Hurricane, Assault Vest Tornadus-T can deal with certain special wallbreakers that Zapdos cannot handle properly, such as Choice Specs Latios. Tornadus-T can also form a pivoting core with Zapdos if the latter is running Volt Switch. As well as defensive options, Zapdos works well with offensive Pokemon. It pairs especially well with Mega Gyarados, as, due to its typing, Gyarados is able to take Ice-type attacks that would otherwise threaten Zapdos, and Zapdos is also able to remove entry hazards from the field to allow Gyarados to switch more freely as well as to wear down walls that may otherwise prevent Gyarados from sweeping through Toxic. Zapdos is also a good partner for Dragonite, as it can keep hazards off the field, which keeps Dragonite's Multiscale intact, allowing it to perform better. Another Pokemon that appreciates hazard removal from Zapdos is Mega Charizard Y, which would otherwise take heavy damage from entry hazards. It is also able to beat some Ice-types that would otherwise threaten Zapdos with their super effective attacks. Both Landorus formes work well with Zapdos. Landorus can set Stealth Rock and take care of problematic Steel-types like Heatran and Bronzong. Landorus-T forms a VoltTurn core with Zapdos. This core is especially potent because of Landorus-T's Intimidate and Ground / Flying typing. This means it is able to take Rock-type attacks for Zapdos, while Zapdos takes the special hits that Landorus-Therian is less oriented to take. Gliscor is also a potential partner, acting as a stallbreaker for Zapdos by using Taunt against opposing walls and also absorbing any crippling status for it.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Roost allows Zapdos to act as a reliable Defogger. With Discharge, Zapdos can paralyze and limit faster threats like Kingdra. Alternatively, Zapdos can use Volt Switch to provide pivot support. Toxic cripples opposing Zapdos, Latios, and Ground-types like Mega Swampert and Gastrodon. Heat Wave covers Breloom, Nidoking, and Steel-types like Excadrill and Ferrothorn. However, Zapdos prefers Toxic over Heat Wave, since its teammates can deal with the previously mentioned Pokemon. 16 Speed EVs allow Zapdos to outspeed Adamant base 70 Speed foes, namely Bisharp, Mega Swampert, and Breloom. Pressure works well with Defog, allowing Zapdos to keep entry hazards off the field against Stealth Rock setters like Empoleon, Hippowdon, and non-Toxic variants of Jirachi.</p> <p>All of Zapdos's teammates appreciate its ability to tank special attacks, clear entry hazards with Defog, and spread status with Discharge and Toxic. Rotom-W checks Ground-types like Choice Band Excadrill and Mamoswine, and it can switch into and threaten most physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp. It also provides a slow Volt Switch. Air Balloon Magnezone can trap and KO Steel-types like Excadrill and Ferrothorn with Hidden Power Fire. Given the opportunity, Substitute + Calm Mind Raikou can sweep through Psychic teams with Shadow Ball. Raikou also forms a dual Pressure stalling core with Zapdos. Thundurus's access to Grass Knot and Hidden Power Ice allows it to check Swampert and pose a massive threat to Ground teams. It can also use Prankster Thunder Wave to cripple faster threats like Choice Scarf Victini. Thanks to its fantastic Speed tier and Intimidate, Mega Manectric can wear down physical attackers and create momentum with Volt Switch. Additionally, Mega Manectric's Fire- and Ice-type coverage allows it to check Ferrothorn and dent Dragon-types like Mega Garchomp and Dragonite.</p>"

  "Dragonite": {
    "overview": "<h3>Flying</h3> <p>Dragonite is a very strong physical attacker, being able to wallbreak multiple threats with Choice Band or sweep with Dragon Dance. It has excellent offensive coverage options that make it a great asset to Flying teams such as Superpower, Fire Punch, and Earthquake. It also has access to Extreme Speed, which allows it to serve as a very reliable revenge killer. Dragonite has access to a great ability in Multiscale, which halves the damage it takes at full health, helping it in setting up Dragon Dance safely. This paired with its decent bulk means Dragonite can also switch into unresisted moves quite safely if necessary. Unfortunately, Dragonite has a huge weakness to Ice-type moves that can be exploited due to several Pokemon carrying Ice-type coverage moves, such as Mega Lopunny and Slowbro. Dragonite's weakness to Stealth Rock ruins Multiscale's effectiveness and makes it more difficult for it to set up. It also has a mediocre Speed tier and is usually useless in the Fairy matchup.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Flying</h4> <p>Weakness Policy can be used with Multiscale for Dragonite to get a huge boost in its Attack and Special Attack, making it a much bigger threat. However, it requires Dragonite to be hit by a super effective attack, meaning it will most likely be at low health after setting up and must have Multiscale intact before doing so. It can also run Fire Blast to ensure that it KOes Skarmory. Iron Head gives Dragonite coverage against Fairy- and Rock-types; however, Earthquake and Fire Punch are resisted by fewer types. Thunder Punch gives Dragonite coverage on Azumarill, Skarmory, and other Flying-types such as Togekiss super effectively; however, Fire Punch has superior coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Flying</h4> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Dragonite has a tough time breaking through physically defensive walls such as Skarmory, Trace Porygon2, and Hippowdon. Hippowdon and Skarmory can carry Rocky Helmet, which can break Multiscale; disrupt Dragonite's with Whirlwind; and easily recover damage dealt to them. Porygon2 can trace Dragonite's Multiscale and can either 2HKO it with an Ice Beam, set a timer on it with Toxic, or paralyze it with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Despite having Fire Punch and Superpower, Dragonite is still vulnerable to Ice-type Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, Weavile, and Avalugg; it cannot afford to take any Ice-type attacks due to its 4x weakness. Many Ice-types carry Ice Shard, which can easily KO Dragonite once its Multiscale is broken.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Dragonite's Outrage has no effect on Fairy-types, so they can use that opportunity to get a free switch in. Dragonite would have to rely on its coverage moves to deal damage to them. Choice Band Azumarill is able to OHKO Dragonite with Play Rough or use it as setup fodder with Belly Drum. Sylveon's Choice Specs- and Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice can easily KO Dragonite. Togekiss can Thunder Wave Dragonite and proceed to make it flinch with Air Slash.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock and Status</strong>: Both Stealth Rock and status can ruin Dragonite's Multiscale, hindering its effectiveness as a sweeper. Status can severely hinder Dragonite's longevity in battle. Burns will cripple Dragonite's Attack, and Toxic damage increases each turn. Dragonite should be wary of paralysis, especially when running Dragon Dance. Notable Pokemon that can spread status are Mandibuzz, Chansey, Thundurus, Porygon2, Zapdos, Sableye, and Mew.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon are a huge problem for Dragonite if it has not set up Dragon Dance. Mega Lopunny can break its Multiscale with Fake Out and use Ice Punch afterwards. Choice Scarf Landorus-T can lower Dragonite's Attack with Intimidate and use Stone Edge.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band (Flying)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>A Choice Band-boosted STAB Outrage from Dragonite hits extremely hard, generally OHKOing anything that isn't a wall or doesn't resist it. Extreme Speed allows it to pick off weakened Pokemon that have set up such as Mega Gyarados or revenge kill certain threats such as Weavile after Stealth Rock. Fire Punch is used to hit Steel-types that would otherwise wall Dragonite such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn and pick up KOs on Mega Scizor and Bisharp. Earthquake gives it great coverage, hitting Steel- and Rock-types for super effective damage, notably KOing Mega Diancie. Superpower can be used over Earthquake, although Dragonite then loses out on the ability to 2HKO Doublade and an effective way to damage Azumarill besides Extreme Speed: Earthquake has a very good chance of OHKOing Azumarill after it uses Belly Drum if it has taken Stealth Rock damage and always does after a little prior damage, while Extreme Speed cannot do the same. Superpower can be used to break the Normal-type defensive core of Porygon2 and Chansey, which can otherwise pose a problem to Flying teams, and hit Steel-types super effectively, picking up an OHKO on Air Balloon Heatran.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment maximizes Dragonite's sweeping potential. An Adamant nature is preferred in order to increase its offensive presence and becomes relevant when revenge killing threats with Extreme Speed. It also gives Dragonite a chance to 2HKO both Leftovers and Rocky Helmet Skarmory with Fire Punch. A Choice Band is the item of choice, increasing Dragonite's damage output. Multiscale ensures Dragonite can get off a hit on a Pokemon without the risk of being KOed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dragonite is best used as a hit-and-run attacker, doing damage and then switching out. It should be used early- or mid-game to wallbreak for its team, helping setup sweepers clean late-game. Preserving Multiscale should be the top priority, so the field should be kept clear of entry hazards. Dragonite should absolutely avoid status. Toxic poison and burn remove Multiscale, and a burn also halves its damage output. It can also work as a revenge killer with Extreme Speed and can clean late-game. Outrage should not be used when there are Pokemon that can revenge kill Dragonite such as Lopunny, Diancie, Magnezone, and Ditto, or when there are Steel-types, such as Scizor or Doublade, and Fairy-types, such as Belly Drum Azumarill, which can set up on it while it is locked into Outrage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because Skarmory and Zapdos have the ability to wall almost every hit and can set and remove entry hazards, which is invaluable for preventing Multiscale from breaking, they pair well with Dragonite. Additionally, Zapdos can help whittle down walls that Dragonite can't break with Toxic and can get off a slow Volt Switch to bring in Dragonite safely. Skarmory switches into the Rock-, Fairy-, and Ice-type moves that threaten Dragonite like Ice Shard and increases offensive pressure by setting up Stealth Rock; however, it should be careful around Fairy-types like Diancie and Clefable, which can run Fire-type coverage moves like Hidden Power Fire and Flamethrower. Thundurus can offensively support Dragonite by spreading status through Prankster Thunder Wave, allowing it to beat threats without having to risk breaking its Multiscale. Mega Charizard Y can be used to switch into a predicted Will-O-Wisp and deal with the Ice-types and the physical walls that Dragonite cannot break. Landorus also pairs well with Dragonite, as it can OHKO or 2HKO almost every physical wall that Dragonite cannot break through. Dragonite's wallbreaking capabilities are largely appreciated by Mega Gyarados, helping it sweep late-game. Landorus-T's Choice Scarf set can be used to revenge kill Rock- and Steel-type foes that resist Extreme Speed. The defensive set can work as a great defensive pivot and can set up Stealth Rock while providing a slow U-turn to bring Dragonite in safely. Gliscor can also pair well with Dragonite, using its stallbreaking capabilities to stall out walls that threaten Dragonite like Porygon2 and bulky Water-type Pokemon like Alomomola.</p>"

It's also good for picking off weakened Pokemon. Outrage is Dragonite's most powerful STAB attack, hitting multiple types that don't resist the move hard. Dragon Claw can be used instead of Outrage so that Dragonite doesn't get locked into the attack; however, there is a considerable difference in power, so Outrage gives Dragonite much-needed KOs that Dragon Claw cannot. Fire Punch allows Dragonite to deal massive damage to Skarmory, which otherwise walls Dragonite, and OHKO Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. Earthquake gives it coverage on Mega Diancie, Azumarill, and Heatran, although it is walled by bulky Steel-types like Skarmory and Ferrothorn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack EVs with an Adamant nature allow Dragonite to hit harder, notably almost always OHKOing specially defensive Zapdos after a Dragon Dance boost. Multiscale allows Dragonite to set up Dragon Dance more easily by halving damage at full health. A Lum Berry is needed for Dragonite to freely set up Dragon Dance once and avoid any status that will keep it from sweeping. Lum Berry keeps Multiscale's ability active in case a Pokemon tries to Will-O-Wisp or Toxic it. Alternatively, it helps cure Dragonite of confusion from Outrage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Always keep Dragonite away from status moves and Stealth Rock because they will ruin Dragonite's chances of setting up safely. The Lum Berry can be used to set up on Pokemon that threaten Dragonite with a burn, such as Slowbro and Alomomola, although it should be preserved for as long as possible. Dragonite can be used as a mid- or late-game cleaner once all of its threats are weakened or gone. Despite Multiscale halving the damage Dragonite takes, it's highly recommended that Dragonite does not stay in on any Ice-type attacks, as it will suffer heavy damage from or be OHKOed by them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Zapdos and Skarmory make for good partners because both are able to remove entry hazards with Defog. Skarmory can switch into physical attackers and Fairy-types while setting up or removing entry hazards for Dragonite. Zapdos can provide support with Toxic and a slow Volt Switch, which gives Dragonite an opportunity to come in safely and set up. Dragonite appreciates wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard Y as partners. Mega Charizard Y can also deal with Ice-types and switch into a predicted Will-O-Wisp that would be problematic for Dragonite. Landorus-T and Gyarados can soften attacks aimed at Dragonite with Intimidate, allowing for Dragonite to set up Dragon Dance more effectively. Landorus-T deserves a special mention, as it can break through walls with its fearsome Attack. Dragonite appreciates defensive Landorus-T's ability to set up Stealth Rock and use a slow U-turn so it can come in safely. Mega Gyarados can switch into predicted Ice-type attacks for Dragonite and check Psychic-types such as Mew, Jirachi, Slowbro, and Mega Medicham. Both Mega Gyarados and Dragonite can put offensive pressure on the opposing team, as both Pokemon can set up with Dragon Dance. Togekiss can switch into a predicted Dragon-type attack for Dragonite. With its access to Prankster, Thundurus can paralyze opposing Pokemon with Thunder Wave, providing speed control for Dragonite.</p>"

  "Lanturn": {
    "overview": "<h3>Water</h3> <p>Thanks to Volt Absorb, Lanturn has a rare Electric immunity, which is essential for all Water teams to function reliably. It's also unique in that its low weight makes it relatively unthreatened by Grass Knot, making it the only Electric-immune Pokemon able to beat Thundurus. To complement its immunity, Lanturn has fantastic mixed bulk, primarily due to its massive HP stat, and can switch into many special attacks safely. It's packed with many support options such as being able to spread burns with Scald, poison with Toxic, and even paralysis with Thunder Wave. Lanturn is also the only viable user of Heal Bell, which makes it a necessity for any defensive team, and is therefore difficult to take down via status. Lanturn is slow but uses that to its advantage by bringing a slow Volt Switch to the table, which helps it escape bad situations and pivot teammates in safely. It does lack reliable recovery, though, making it very easily worn down with no way to substantially heal. Lanturn has disappointing Special Attack, Defense, and Special Defense, making it more of a very weak pivot than a wall. Setup sweepers that don't fear Scald burns, such as Lum Berry Bisharp, can easily take advantage of Lanturn's lack of power. Lanturn is also weak to Ground-type attacks, which many other utility options on Water teams are weak to as well, making it somewhat difficult to have good type synergy.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Water</h4> <p>A more physically defensive spread is usable but makes Lanturn more easily worn down by special attackers such as Thundurus. Furthermore, Lanturn's physical bulk will still be subpar. More HP investment is also usable, taking out of Defense, to improve Lanturn's special bulk further, but the net gains are minimal in comparison to the loss of physical bulk. A RestTalk set is usable to provide Lanturn with some form of recovery but results in losing much of Lanturn's utility and causes it to be even more vulnerable setup fodder.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Water</h4> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Although few can switch into Scald for fear of being burned or taking serious damage, wallbreakers such as Landorus, Mega Garchomp, and Excadrill can easily threaten to OHKO Lanturn. They can also block Lanturn's Volt Switch attempts.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: While Lanturn is capable of burning them with Scald or Volt Switching out of harm, Grass-types generally don't fear Lanturn, and the likes of Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn, which are immune to Toxic, can easily switch in and threaten it.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Powerful attackers such as Mega Medicham, Hoopa-U, and Dragonite are capable of outright OHKOing Lanturn, although they generally hate to be burned by Scald or poisoned by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Stallbreakers that use Taunt such as Gliscor and Mew can cripple Lanturn and prevent it from cleansing its status. Others such as Rain Dance Manaphy and Calm Mind Clefable can easily set up on Lanturn as it pivots out. Gliscor and Manaphy in particular are notable for not being meaningfully affected by any status ailments.</p> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Because Lanturn lacks damage and typically relies on using status, Substitute users such as Mega Gardevoir can be difficult for it to handle. Substitute setup sweepers such as Raikou are especially problematic, as Lanturn cannot break their Substitute as it pivots out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support (Water)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald makes Lanturn difficult to switch into, thanks to its chance to burn, and gives Lanturn decent offensive presence, in spite of its lack of damage output. Heal Bell is used to provide cleric support to the team by healing status ailments. Toxic is the preferred status move to put the opponent's team on a timer and to deal meaningful damage to foes. Defensive Pokemon are crippled by the scaling damage, and when Toxic is combined with Heal Bell, Lanturn is capable of defeating opposing walls, even those that rely on status such as Zapdos, with it. Thunder Wave is an alternative to Toxic for more balanced teams, as Lanturn can slow down opposing threats such as Mega Charizard Y and Choice Scarf Kyurem-B to allow its teammates more breathing room. It does, however, make Lanturn lose to most walls such as Porygon2. As the final move, Volt Switch gives Lanturn an option to pivot out while keeping up momentum. Thanks to its low Speed and ability to force out foes, it can safely bring in teammates.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Volt Absorb is used to give Lanturn an Electric immunity, making it a very reliable switch-in to almost all Electric-type attacks. Leftovers is the preferred item to give Lanturn some form of recovery. Because of its bulk, Lanturn can often receive a great amount of recovery over a long match. The HP EVs put Lanturn at a Leftovers number, maximizing its only recovery option. Maximum Special Defense investment and a Calm nature help make Lanturn able to switch into more special attacks for the team. The rest of the EVs are put into Defense to try to give Lanturn as much mixed bulk as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Take full advantage of Lanturn's Volt Absorb to bring it into threatening Electric-type attacks. Volt Absorb also helps heal Lanturn on occasion, but this shouldn't be relied upon. Lanturn should mainly be used to pivot in between teammates by bringing it in and Volt Switching out. Lanturn can also use Volt Switch defensively to avoid its checks as they come in, such as Mew. While Lanturn is weak to Grass-type attacks, its low weight makes it take very little damage from Grass Knot, so freely pivot Lanturn into its users such as Thundurus. Because it relies heavily on Leftovers for recovery, do be careful of letting Lanturn be worn down too quickly, though, if its Electric immunity is critical for the matchup. It should avoid switching into and facing Knock Off users such as Bisharp in most cases, to protect its Leftovers. Lanturn should seek to spread status whenever it's in and doesn't want to immediately pivot out. Against more defensive teams, Toxic should be used liberally to wear down walls. However, if it's using Thunder Wave instead, be careful not to paralyze opposing walls, as burning them is preferred for the residual damage. Against more offensive teams, Thunder Wave and Scald can be used freely to cripple threats such as Kingdra and Togekiss. Use Heal Bell when necessary to cleanse status ailments. While conserving PP is important in matchups against stall teams, Lanturn cannot afford to take many turns of burn or poison damage due to its lack of recovery, so if Lanturn is afflicted by status, make sure to Heal Bell as soon as possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Thanks to its bulk, Lanturn fits on pretty much any balanced or stall team. Almost all of Water appreciates its Volt Absorb, and all stall teams will want its Heal Bell support. Physical attackers such as Azumarill and Mega Gyarados are much less afraid of Scald when Lanturn can use Heal Bell to cleanse their status. Alomomola is one of the best teammates for Lanturn, as it can pass huge Wishes to Lanturn and can also switch into most physical attackers that threaten Lanturn. Notably, Ground-type attackers such as Landorus-T are easily walled by it. Slowbro can also easily wall many physical attackers, including Mega Medicham. Both Alomomola and Calm Mind Slowbro hate status, which Lanturn can cleanse in return. Tentacruel provides a lot of utility that Lanturn needs: it can set Toxic Spikes, saving Lanturn the effort of poisoning foes, and use Rapid Spin, keeping Lanturn from needing to take extra damage from entry hazards. Tentacruel and Empoleon, a Stealth Rock setter, are very often paired with Lanturn for their ability to switch into Grass-type attacks, although they do compound the Ground weakness. Sap Sipper Azumarill is a notable teammate that can also serve as a counter to many Grass-types. Starmie is an entry hazard remover that can be used on more offensive teams. Swampert is a defensive option that can take Earthquakes quite easily while setting up Stealth Rock and acting as a secondary Electric immunity for the likes of Kyurem-B. As another physically bulky Ground-type, Quagsire is a good teammate for its Unaware ability, making it a very reliable answer to setup sweepers such as Bisharp. Attackers in general appreciate Lanturn's diverse status capabilities; poisoned walls are easier to break down, and paralyzed revenge killers are neutered. Setup sweepers such as Tail Glow Manaphy and Mega Gyarados are good receivers of Lanturn's slow Volt Switch, as they only need one or two free turns to become almost unstoppable after setting up. Bounce Gyarados is particularly good for its Ground immunity, which Lanturn appreciates being able to Volt Switch into, and its use of Bounce to take out Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur. Volcanion is a great wallbreaker that can also be brought in with Volt Switch to bring down clerics such as Togekiss and Chansey that try to switch into Lanturn.</p>"

  "Azumarill": {
    "overview": "<h3>Water</h3> <p>Huge Power—indisputably one of the best abilities in the game—has blessed Azumarill with enhanced wallbreaking capabilities and fierce offensive pressure, making it one of Water's best physical wallbreakers. This is complemented by its access to hard-hitting STAB moves in Play Rough and Waterfall, as well as its access to priority in Aqua Jet, utility in Knock Off, and setup in Belly Drum, which turns Azumarill into an extremely threatening wincon and late-game cleaner. Its above average 100 / 80 / 80 bulk allows it to find multiple opportunities to set up Belly Drum, often making it the go-to choice for a cleaner. While it's not running a Belly Drum set, Azumarill can run a Choice Band set, which, when coupled with Huge Power, allows it to devastatingly wreck unprepared teams with its STAB moves. Furthermore, its typing is great defensively; Azumarill resists Dark, Fighting, and Ice and is immune to Dragon. These resistances really help Water teams, as they let Azumarill take on Choice Band Gyarados and Mega Gyarados. Azumarill also has access to Superpower, making it a fine Ferrothorn lure. Furthermore, Azumarill's flexibility doesn't end there—it is able to even run a defensive set using its other ability, Sap Sipper, to be a great Grass-type counter to Pokemon like Serperior and Breloom.</p> <p>However, Azumarill is incredibly slow, unfortunately relying on a weak priority move in Aqua Jet to actually move before the foe in most cases, and this leaves it unable to do much to faster Pokemon like Magnezone and Serperior. Furthermore, if Azumarill runs a defensive set, it is incredibly weak, as it lacks the power granted from Huge Power, meaning it is unable to do much to Chansey and other walls.</p> <h3>Fairy</h3> <p>Azumarill is one of the few physically attacking Fairy-types, and it's a great one thanks to Huge Power. It can be a very threatening sweeper thanks to its access to Belly Drum and a priority move in Aqua Jet. Its typing gives it resistances to Fire, Water, and Ice and a neutrality to Steel, which is unusual for a Fairy. Its Water typing and access to Superpower allow it to check threats such as Heatran and Empoleon. Additionally, Azumarill's bulk is pretty good and allows it to take a hit before attacking or set up a Belly Drum more easily. However, Azumarill's Water typing brings a weakness to Electric, which Fairy-types don't appreciate as it is. Its Speed stat is also very low, which means it usually has to take a hit before being able to hit back or set up.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Water</h4> <p>Sap Sipper can be used on the Choice Band set to help against Grass-types, though Choice Band allows Azumarill to be much powerful, and this is usually preferred. To help stomach hits, Assault Vest may be used, though the power drop is noticeable and Azumarill's lack of recovery makes this set suboptimal.</p> <h4>Fairy</h4> <p>A Choice Band set can be used over Belly Drum for immediate power, but Fairy-type teams have the tools to make great use of Azumarill's Belly Drum set and its sweeping potential.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Water</h4> <p><strong>Volcanion</strong>: Volcanion's Water / Fire typing and ability Water Absorb make it an effective counter to Azumarill. Volcanion's average Defense allows it to take a Choice Band-boosted Superpower and Knock Off. Volcanion can then OHKO Azumarill with Sludge Wave.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory is one of the best physical walls, able to counter most Azumarill sets bar Belly Drum. It resists Play Rough, can use Roost to heal off health lost by Knock Off, and can use Whirlwind to phaze Azumarill in the event that it does manage to set up with Belly Drum. Superpower also only makes Azumarill more susceptible to being revenge killed.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: Mega Venusaur resists both of Azumarill's STAB moves and takes very little damage from both of its coverage moves. Furthermore, it can easily switch in and use Sludge Bomb (on Sap Sipper sets) or Giga Drain (on non-Sap Sipper sets) to take Azumarill out.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Kyurem-B and Serperior are both revenge killers that outspeed Azumarill (they aren't the only ones too; a lot of them do due to Azumarill's low Speed), resist Aqua Jet, and can threaten it with Fusion Bolt and Leaf Storm respectively.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Paralysis slows Azumarill down, and there is also a chance that Azumarill misses a turn, possibly changing the fate of the game. Burns decrease Azumarill's power and cause it to hit weaker while also wearing it down, while poison damage accumulates and causes Azumarill to be taken out easily as a result.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: If Azumarill forgoes Knock Off, it is walled by Quagsire, bulky Mega Scizor, physically defensive Mew, and Rotom-W. However, if Knock Off is chosen and Superpower is forgone, Ferrothorn becomes a massive problem for Azumarill. In addition, Rocky Helmet + Iron Barbs wear Azumarill down very easily, leaving it in KO range after a few attacks.</p> <h4>Fairy</h4> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: If it's at full HP, Skarmory can survive any hit from Azumarill after it sets up with Belly Drum and phaze it with Whirlwind.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Due to its weakness to Grass, Azumarill is unable to set up on most Grass-type Pokemon, and some are even able to survive a hit from it after it sets up such as Mega Venusaur.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Azumarill's weakness to Poison-types such as Gengar prevents it from setting up on them because it will take a lot of damage from their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Thundurus hit Azumarill really hard due to its weakness and prevent it from setting up on them. They don't appreciate switching in on a Play Rough or a Knock Off, however, and can no longer check it after it sets up.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: Mega Venusaur is a true counter to Azumarill because it can survive any attack even after the Belly Drum boost and knock it out with Sludge Bomb or Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Ditto</strong>: Ditto is able to copy Azumarill's stats after it sets up and revenge kill it with Play Rough.</p> <p><strong>Rotom-W</strong>: Rotom-W outspeeds Azumarill and can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp or take it out with Volt Switch if it's in range because it resists Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Volcanion</strong>: Volcanion is immune to Aqua Jet and is faster than Azumarill, allowing it to take it out with Sludge Wave.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Any status can strongly cripple Azumarill's ability to sweep or its longevity. Burn cuts Azumarill's Attack, poison wears it down, and paralysis cuts its Speed even more.</p> <p><strong>Water Absorb</strong>: Pokemon with the ability Water Absorb such as Seismitoad and Toxicroak prevent Azumarill from going for Aqua Jet and can take it out with a super effective Poison-type attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band (Water)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Play Rough is Azumarill's hardest-hitting STAB move, dealing great damage to Pokemon that don't resist it, and is used to hit Dragon-, Fighting-, and Dark-types such as Kyurem-B, Terrakion, and Mega Gyarados, all of which are OHKOed by the move. Aqua Jet provides Azumarill with both priority and the ability to revenge kill weakened threats; it also sets Azumarill apart from other Water-type wallbreakers like Dragon Dance Mega Gyarados. Waterfall is Azumarill's stronger Water STAB move and is used to hit types that resist Play Rough, such as Fire and Steel. For example, it OHKOes Heatran, Infernape, and Excadrill. Superpower hits Steel-types like Ferrothorn that take pitiful damage from the aforementioned STAB moves and also allows Azumarill to break past Normal's Eviolite core of Chansey + Porygon2. Knock Off provides great utility in removing items such as Choice items, Leftovers, and Eviolite and can help Azumarill break past Psychic-types like Jirachi. Aqua Tail, alternatively, can be used as a more stronger, albeit less accurate, Water-type STAB move over Waterfall that is able to 2HKO Skarmory.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack EVs with an Adamant nature, Huge Power, and Choice Band allow Azumarill to hit as hard as possible, turning it into a fierce wallbreaker thanks to the sheer amount of power it has under its belt. 164 Speed EVs are used to allow Azumarill to outspeed non-invested base 70 Pokemon such as Lanturn, Jellicent and Skarmory, though 84 Speed EVs can be used as an alternative option to outspeed base 60 Speed Pokemon such as Clefable. Another alternative is running 252 Speed EVs, which allows Azumarill to outspeed other Azumarill and uninvested Mega Scizor, though Azumarill loses out on bulk if it runs this. The remaining EVs are dumped into HP for general bulk. As this is a wallbreaking set, Huge Power is the best ability, as Sap Sipper Azumarill is ridiculously weak.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Azumarill should be used to revenge kill weakened Pokemon with Aqua Jet and also to sweep late-game. Don't switch Azumarill into non-resisted hits, as it should try to maintain as much health as possible. Avoid getting Azumarill burned, as burns cripple Azumarill and make it unable to deal a lot of damage. When Azumarill is not revenge killing, it should be wallbreaking as much as possible, weakening the opponent's team for either itself or a teammate to clean up afterwards. Avoid getting Azumarill paralyzed or poisoned, as Azumarill is already slow and does not at all appreciate losing more Speed, while poison puts Azumarill on a timer and thus prevents it from wallbreaking as much. Take advantage of Azumarill's Fairy typing by switching Azumarill into Dragon-types, such as Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, Choice-locked into a Dragon-type move like Outrage; Azumarill can then OHKO them with Play Rough. Use Knock Off as much as possible to cripple defensive walls by removing their item. For example, removing Leftovers from Alomomola or Eviolite from Porygon2 cripples them by either removing a source of recovery or removing a source of bulk. Sending out Azumarill early-game is also a good option so that it can begin wallbreaking.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Azumarill struggles against Grass-types, Empoleon makes for a good partner thanks to its Grass neutrality, although it can't do much against said Grass-types. Stealth Rock support by Swampert and Empoleon makes it easier for Azumarill to deal with the foe, as it breaks Focus Sashes and Sturdy and wears down the foe, while Defog or Rapid Spin support allows Azumarill to have an easier time switching in and prevents it from being worn down too much. Rapid Spin support can be provided by Starmie and Tentacruel, the former running Psychic to help versus Mega Venusaur. Swampert also provides an Electric immunity. Lanturn is another good partner thanks to its immunity to Electric; it also provides Heal Bell support, removing status ailments from Azumarill and allowing it to be played more aggressively without the fear of getting burned. Lanturn can also bring Azumarill in through slow Volt Switch, allowing it to preserve its health. Special attackers such as Volcanion can break through physically defensive Pokemon that give Azumarill a hard time such as Skarmory. Volcanion can use Fire Blast to attempt to break past Mega Venusaur. Rotom-W makes for a good partner, as it can safely bring Azumarill in through a slow Volt Switch and also cripple the foe with Will-O-Wisp. Tentacruel provides a Grass-type check for Azumarill while also providing hazard removal and Toxic Spikes support, which is very useful for wearing down the foe. Tail Glow Manaphy appreciates Azumarill wallbreaking so that it can sweep a bit more easily. Gyarados can run Bounce to help Azumarill deal with Grass-types, whereas Mega Gyarados can deal with Psychic-types for it, allowing Azumarill to then run Superpower in the final slot. Mega Sharpedo also helps versus Psychic-types and appreciates Azumarill weakening the foe.</p>"
      },
      "Belly Drum (Water)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Belly Drum turns Azumarill into a frightening sweeper, and Azumarill's good bulk allows it to find many opportunities to set up. Aqua Jet makes up for Azumarill's poor Speed and is able to deal a lot of damage after a Belly Drum boost, and Play Rough is Azumarill's strongest STAB move and deals a massive amount of damage to Dragon-, Fighting-, and Dark-types as well as Pokemon that do not resist it. Knock Off is used to provide utility in removing items, as well as providing a way to hit Psychic-types such as Jirachi super effectively. It also hits Ferrothorn neutrally if you decide to forgo Superpower, OHKOing it at +6. Superpower can be used instead, but the Attack and Defense drop is worrisome, and this set functions more as a late-game cleaner rather than a lure or wallbreaker.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>164 Speed EVs are used so that Azumarill outspeeds Clefable and base 70 Speed Pokemon, most notably Skarmory, Jellicent, and Lanturn. Maximum Attack EVs alongside an Adamant nature allow Azumarill able to break past anything after a Belly Drum boost. To improve its overall bulk, the rest of the EVs are dumped into HP. The amount of EVs invested in HP also make it so that the Sitrus Berry is consumed right after Azumarill uses Belly Drum. Sitrus Berry is used so that Azumarill escapes KO range after using Belly Drum, and without it, Azumarill is extremely vulnerable to being KOed or simply revenge killed. On such an offensive set, Huge Power is obviously chosen over Sap Sipper, as Sap Sipper Azumarill is horrendously weak even after Azumarill has boosted with Belly Drum.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ideally, Azumarill should be sent out after counters such as Volcanion have been eliminated so that setting up a Belly Drum is easier. As Azumarill will be using Aqua Jet most of the time to make up for its low Speed, defensive Water checks should be eliminated so that Azumarill can easily sweep. Azumarill's reliance on Sitrus Berry for recovery means that you shouldn't switch it into attacks, no matter how weak you might think they are, in order to keep it as healthy as possible. Similarly, by all means, prevent Azumarill from having its Sitrus Berry knocked off, as without it, Azumarill cannot set up Belly Drum safely. Utilize Azumarill's typing by switching it into Pokemon Choice-locked into a Dragon-type move, as it can then set up Belly Drum easily. Use Belly Drum on a predicted switch so that Azumarill can proceed to sweep. Use Aqua Jet when the foe is low on HP to easily take them out or when the foe is faster than Azumarill and might pose a threat. Spam Play Rough most of the time before the sweep, as it is Azumarill's strongest attack and not many Pokemon resist it. After the sweep, use Aqua Jet to clean up the team. If you opt for Superpower, be wary of how many times you use it; the more you use it, the more Azumarill suffers from stat drops, so using it once or twice to take out a troublesome Steel-type is often enough. Knock Off should be used to cripple Pokemon that rely on their item: Porygon2 or Chansey both require their Eviolite to properly function as walls, and removing it makes them much easier to take out. It's also a nice move to spam in general. Avoid status at all costs. Azumarill might lose a turn due to paralysis, which is incredibly risky; burns cripple it and cause it to hit less hard; and poison wears Azumarill down easily. Keep Stealth Rock and Spikes away from your side of the field, as Azumarill needs to preserve as much health as possible if you want a successful sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>When it hasn't used Belly Drum, Azumarill isn't really a wallbreaker, so it's best to have a wallbreaker like Manaphy in the back to break past Pokemon Azumarill struggles with. Manaphy can help with Mega Venusaur as well and can break past the opposing team when it is has set up with Tail Glow. Lanturn and Swampert both provide an Electric immunity, the former also providing Heal Bell support and the latter providing Stealth Rock support. Empoleon or Tentacruel can take Grass-type hits, making them usable teammates for Azumarill. Empoleon also provides Stealth Rock and Defog support, as Azumarill does not like getting worn down at all. Tentacruel provides entry hazard control also, as well as Toxic Spikes and a resistance to Grass. Choice Specs Volcanion is a good partner, as it can break through the foe's team with STAB-boosted Steam Eruption, softening them up as a result and allowing Azumarill to more easily take them out. Dragon Dance Gyarados can sweep alongside Azumarill and can also run Bounce to hit Grass-types. Volcanion helps against Mega Venusaur, a big counter to this set. Rotom-W and Lanturn both bring Azumarill safely in with a slow Volt Switch.</p>"

      "Defensive (Water)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is used to get the chip damage on foes, as well as possibly burn them, thus crippling them and wearing them down easily. Toxic can be used to put setup sweepers and walls on a timer, forcing them to switch out. Protect works well in conjunction with Scald + Toxic, as Azumarill can rack up burn and poison damage. It also helps scout for the foe's move. Rest can be used in this slot as a means of recovery, though it is unreliable and Azumarill can easily be taken advantage of when asleep. Perish Song can be used to immediately put both Azumarill and the foe on a timer, thus forcing switches, though Azumarill needs to switch out as well, which can often disrupt momentum. Encore is another option in the final slot to cripple setup sweepers and defensive Pokemon in general locked in a boosting move for the former and a status move for the latter, forcing them to switch out. Knock Off can be used for its utility and ability to hit Psychic-types decently. It removes Eviolites from Pokemon like Porygon2, making it easier for a teammate to deal with them later on.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread makes Azumarill as bulky as possible. 248 HP and 252 Special Defense EVs as well as a Calm nature are used to allow Azumarill to more easily take on Mega Charizard Y. Sap Sipper is used to make Azumarill a better Grass counter, which Water teams greatly appreciate. 248 HP / 152 Def / 108 SpD can be used, as it makes it easier to take physical attacks, notably from Mega Heracross or the rare Swords Dance + Rock Tomb Breloom, though more Special Defense EVs are appreciated for better special bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Azumarill into Grass-type attacks that would've taken a teammate out and to get a handy Attack boost to power up Knock Off. Use Toxic or Perish Song when up against a setup sweeper or a threat to your team to force them to switch out. Spam Scald most of the time in order to spread burns and gain chip damage on the opposing team. It's also useful to cripple setup sweepers and walls if they manage to get burned. Using Encore to lock a setup sweeper into a boosting move can be useful to then cripple them with Toxic or chip away at their health with Knock Off + Scald. Use Protect to stall Perish Song turns and also force the foe to take accumulating burn or poison damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Lanturn's a great partner, as it is able to remove status from Azumarill with Heal Bell, which is useful in conjunction with Rest. Lanturn also provides an Electric immunity. Alomomola is able to pass Wishes to Azumarill, improving its longevity. Empoleon is great for setting up Stealth Rock, which works well with the many switches that Azumarill forces. Tentacruel provides Rapid Spin support to keep the hazards you set while removing the ones on your side while also being able to set Toxic Spikes to wear down the foe. Quagsire is a great option for stopping setup sweepers and Taunt users, which would otherwise prevent Azumarill from using Encore, Perish Song, or Toxic to stop them. Pokemon that are able to break through stall teams, which don't mind poison and Azumarill's moves, are appreciated, so Rain Dance Manaphy is a good partner. Since Gliscor is a threat to this set, so Manaphy is a good partner thanks to its ability to take care of it.</p>"
      },
      "Belly Drum (Fairy)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Belly Drum maximizes Azumarill's Attack and lets it become a very threatening sweeper. Aqua Jet is its Water-type STAB move and the move it's most likely to use after setting up because of its +1 priority. Play Rough is Azumarill's Fairy-type STAB move and hits very hard even without setup. Knock Off provides great coverage that hits threats such as Doublade, and it also gets rid of the foe's item. Superpower is an alternative option to hit Pokemon such as Empoleon, Ferrothorn, and Chansey harder, but it does lower Azumarill's Defense, making it easier to revenge kill.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>164 EVs in Speed allow Azumarill to outspeed Skarmory and take it out with +6 Knock Off after Stealth Rock. Running 252 EVs in Attack with an Adamant nature maximizes Azumarill's power and wallbreaking capabilities. The remaining 92 EVs give Azumarill an even HP stat, allowing Sitrus Berry to activate after using Belly Drum at full health. Sitrus Berry restores 25% of Azumarill's health when it gets bellow 50%, which is useful when setting up a Belly Drum. Huge Power doubles Azumarill's Attack to make up for its abysmal base 50 stat.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Azumarill should be used as a late-game Belly Drum sweeper. It should be kept as healthy as possible and not switched in on attacks if it wants to set up with Belly Drum. If the intention is not to clean with Belly Drum, it can be used as an offensive pivot on moves it resists and pressure the foe, or just set up early-game and wallbreak to open the door for a teammate to clean up. A good opportunity for it to set up would be against Pokemon locked into moves that don't threaten it or against passive Pokemon. It should not attempt to set up against Pokemon that can hit it for super effective damage or inflict it with status, as they will neuter its potential to sweep with Belly Drum. Azumarill should be careful when using Knock Off if it wants to sweep later on because Pokemon such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn are able to survive a +6 Knock Off if their item is gone. Before setting up and attempting to sweep, all threats to Azumarill, such as Mega Venusaur, should be removed. It can pick off weakened foes with Aqua Jet, but the move is pretty weak without the Belly Drum boost, so it should be used carefully.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Klefki has the ability to set up Light Screen and Reflect, which help Azumarill take hits better and set up a Belly Drum. Other things Klefki can do for Azumarill include spread paralysis with Thunder Wave to alleviate its Speed problem and set up Spikes to put foes in range of its attacks. Klefki also has an immunity to Poison, which Azumarill appreciates. Clefable is another Pokemon that can help Azumarill's Speed issue by paralyzing foes with Thunder Wave, and it also has access to Stealth Rock, which breaks Focus Sashes and allows Azumarill to get more OHKOs. Other than that, Clefable can serve as a Calm Mind sweeper, which puts additional pressure on the opposing defensive backbone and makes it much easier to sweep with Azumarill, and a status absorber, which Azumarill heavily appreciates. Togekiss checks Grass-types, which threaten Azumarill and prevent it from setting up, and it has access to Heal Bell, which can get rid of Azumarill's status. Gardevoir can deal with Poison-types that threaten Azumarill. It can also run Healing Wish to give Azumarill another chance at sweeping. Sylveon is a great partner thanks to its wallbreaking capabilities that can let it rip holes in the opposing team and allow Azumarill to sweep. Whimsicott is a stallbreaker and teammate that can provide a lot of utility. Its ability to spread status, Encore foes, and even use Leech Seed for healing creates many extra opportunities to sweep with Azumarill. Mega Diancie prevents entry hazards and status spreading with its Magic Bounce ability, something that Azumarill appreciates because it preserves its health and lets it set up more comfortably.</p>"

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<h3>Steel</h3> <p>Mega Scizor's fantastic typing, which boasts a neutrality to Fighting- and Ground-type moves, along with its bulk that rivals even Skarmory's, provides an amazing amount of defensive synergy to Steel teams, especially coupled with its access to reliable recovery in Roost. It's no slouch offensively either, as it has a high Attack stat with access to strong Technician-boosted STAB moves like Bullet Punch and Bug Bite, with the former even giving it access to priority. It also has access to Swords Dance, making it a threatening sweeper that is difficult to revenge kill thanks to Bullet Punch, and in addition has great coverage moves like Superpower and Knock Off to hit the Pokemon that resist both of its STAB types. Unfortunately, Mega Scizor is near useless against Fire teams, as it is decimated by any of their STAB moves and can only hope to revenge kill a weakened Pokemon with Bullet Punch. Mega Scizor also has an underwhelming Speed stat, and while this is usually mitigated by its access to Bullet Punch, it can be easily revenge killed by Pokemon with typings that resist Bullet Punch, mostly notably Water-types and most Fire-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Steel</h4> <p>Mega Scizor can use a Defog set with no Swords Dance, but Skarmory is generally a better Defog user, and such a set is setup fodder for many Pokemon. Regular Scizor can try using a Life Orb Swords Dance set, as it is slightly more powerful than Mega Scizor, but it is almost always outclassed by Mega Scizor because of the great amount of extra bulk, which gives far more opportunities to set up. Quick Attack is another priority option with better neutral coverage than Bullet Punch, hitting Water- and Fire-type Pokemon neutrally, but it is very weak compared to STAB Bullet Punch and is matchup dependent.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Steel</h4> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon are far and away the largest threat to all Mega Scizor sets. They resist both of Scizor's STAB moves, including Bullet Punch, and are generally faster, meaning they can easily revenge kill Mega Scizor with their 4x super effective STAB moves. The most notable Fire-type Pokemon that beat Mega Scizor are Mega Charizard Y, Volcanion, Rotom-H, Entei, and Torkoal. All of these Pokemon are able to take numerous Bullet Punches and are not 2HKOed by Superpower or Knock Off. Other Fire-type Pokemon like Victini, Heatran, and Infernape are able to check Mega Scizor effectively but must be wary of switching into Knock Off and Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-type Pokemon resist Mega Scizor's STAB Bullet Punch and thus often make reliable checks and counters to it. Zapdos in particular resists both of Mega Scizor's STAB moves, takes little damage from Knock Off and Superpower, and can hit it with Heat Wave. Rotom-W and Mega Ampharos are great checks to bulky Mega Scizor variants, being able to switch into Knock Off, Bug Bite, and Superpower and burn them with Will-O-Wisp or 2HKO them with Thunderbolt, respectively. They must be wary of offensive variants, however, as +2 maximum Attack Bug Bite comes close to OHKOing with prior damage. Finally, Mega Manectric is able to reliably check Mega Scizor with Fire-type coverage moves and a resistance to Bullet Punch, but it will take a lot from Bug Bite from offensive sets.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Offensive Water-type Pokemon like Kingdra and Manaphy are able to muscle past Mega Scizor with strong Hydro Pumps or Scalds and resist Bullet Punch, making them good revenge killers if Mega Scizor has taken prior damage. Bulky Water-type Pokemon like Suicune, Alomomola, Gastrodon, and Jellicent are able to avoid the 2HKO from most moves and can fish for Scald burns, which will completely cripple Mega Scizor, but they all lose one-on-one if they do not get the burn. Quagsire is perhaps the best Water-type counter to Mega Scizor, as it ignores Swords Dance due to Unaware, is not 2HKOed by Bug Bite, and can fish for Scald burns or boost alongside Mega Scizor with Curse. It does still take a decent amount from Bug Bite, however, and can be defeated with prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Physically bulky Pokemon like Skarmory, Nidoqueen, and bulky Garchomp are also able to beat Mega Scizor; Skarmory avoids the 2HKO from +2 Superpower from offensive variants and can respond with Counter or Whirlwind, and Nidoqueen and Garchomp both avoid the OHKO from +2 Bullet Punch quite easily and can respond with Fire-type coverage moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance (Steel)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Mega Scizor's Attack to insane levels, making it a formidable wallbreaker and sweeper. Bullet Punch is a strong STAB priority move that can hit faster Pokemon, enables Mega Scizor to revenge kill Pokemon throughout the game, and can OHKO many offensive threats after a Swords Dance boost. Superpower has great coverage alongside Bullet Punch, as it hits Steel-type Pokemon like Heatran, Empoleon, and Magnezone super effectively and lands a good neutral hit against other Mega Scizor. Bug Bite is Mega Scizor's strongest STAB move and hits Water-, Psychic- and Dark-type Pokemon hard. It notably lets Mega Scizor muscle past Pokemon like Mandibuzz, Rotom-W, and Slowbro. Knock Off can also be used to get past Doublade while having good general utility in removing items.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>136 Speed EVs lets Mega Scizor outspeed Victini after a V-Create. Light Metal is the preferred pre-Mega Evolution ability to reduce Low Kick damage. Scizorite greatly improves Scizor's bulk and gives it many more opportunities to set up while also boosting its Attack and giving it Technician.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As this Mega Scizor set lacks Roost and has no HP investment, it can be easily worn down. Do not recklessly switch into entry hazards or Fighting- and Ground-type moves, as this set is not the most reliable check to them. Try to avoid switching Mega Scizor into a potential burn, as it will be crippled Mega Scizor and prevented from sweeping. It can be very beneficial to preserve Mega Scizor's health for a late-game sweep; however, this set can also be used early- and mid-game to wallbreak. It is a good idea to weaken checks like Rotom-W and Infernape before attempting to set up a Swords Dance. Mega Scizor can sweep Fighting-type teams easily after a Swords Dance boost and with Stealth Rock up. As this Mega Scizor set has maximum Attack investment, its Bullet Punch can be quite strong even without a boost, so it can be used as a revenge killer as well.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Mega Scizor set works great on more offensive hazard-stacking Steel-type teams; in general, entry hazard support in the form of Stealth Rock and Spikes is extremely appreciated, as they turn many 2HKOs into OHKOs and can wear down common switch-ins. Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Heatran can all set Stealth Rock, and the former two can also set Spikes. The Custap lead Skarmory set with dual hazards pairs fantastically with Mega Scizor and often finds itself on the same offensive Steel-type teams. Heatran in particular is also an amazing teammate, as it can absorb Fire-type moves for Scizor along with setting up Stealth Rock. Ferrothorn can also deal with Water-type Pokemon, which can prove to be a problem with their Scald burns. Magnezone can trap Skarmory, which can be especially useful if Scizor is not using Superpower. Finally, Choice Scarf Excadrill can easily deal with the Fire- and Electric-type Pokemon that resist Bullet Punch with its Mold Breaker Earthquake and Rock Slide coverage.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive Swords Dance (Steel)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Mega Scizor's Attack to high levels, and this set finds many opportunities to set up due to its bulk. Bullet Punch is Mega Scizor's STAB move that hits faster Pokemon, and it can become quite powerful with a few Swords Dance boosts. Roost gives longevity and lets Mega Scizor turn many Pokemon that cannot 2HKO it into setup fodder. Knock Off works well on this set, as it lets Mega Scizor act as a utility Pokemon throughout the game, switching in on Pokemon it checks and knocking off items. In addition, it has great coverage alongside Bullet Punch, hitting most Pokemon at least neutrally. Superpower can be used to hit Steel-types like Heatran, Magnezone, Empoleon, Ferrothorn, and Bisharp, but since this set is slow, it can only hit the former two on a predicted switch in. U-turn and Bug Bite can be used as Bug-type STAB moves, with the former letting Mega Scizor pivot around and weaken its checks so it can sweep with Swords Dance late-game, and the latter providing a stronger option to hit many Pokemon neutrally; however, Steel and Bug together is very mediocre coverage offensively, and Mega Scizor is walled by a plethora of Pokemon when using these moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP and 44 Defense EVs with an Impish nature let Mega Scizor survive two High Jump Kicks from Mega Lopunny, allowing Mega Scizor to effectively check it. They also help Mega Scizor reliably check Ground-type Pokemon like Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Excadrill. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Defense, letting Mega Scizor avoid the OHKO from Latios's and Mega Diancie's Hidden Power Fire. Maximum Defense investment is also an option to let Mega Scizor check physical Fighting- and Ground-type Pokemon more effectively. Light Metal is the optimal ability for Scizor to reduce Low Kick damage. Scizorite provides Mega Scizor with Technician and a large boost to its bulk as well as its Attack. This set can be used with more Attack investment if the Mega Lopunny benchmark is not of concern.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set can switch in on many big threats like Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, Choice Scarf Terrakion, and Choice Scarf Heracross to reliably check them due to Roost. Knock Off is a very spammable move early-game; as Mega Scizor switches in to check Pokemon, use Knock Off to cripple switch-ins and wear down checks. This Mega Scizor set is not very powerful, so be wary of trying to sweep too early, as it needs two or three Swords Dance boosts to do so effectively. Because of this set's considerable bulk and Roost, Mega Scizor can avoid a 2HKO from many Pokemon and use them as setup fodder. Although this set is bulky enough to take on most Water-type Pokemon, be wary of Scald and burns in general, as they cripple Mega Scizor tremendously.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Mega Scizor set acts as a good glue Pokemon to balanced Steel teams, providing a Fighting- and Ground-type check and a bulky wincon. Heatran is a great teammate, as it can absorb Fire-type moves and set up Stealth Rock. In return, Mega Scizor can take Ground- and Fighting-type moves aimed at Heatran. Ferrothorn is another Stealth Rock setter that can also set up Spikes and deal (keep) with Water-type Pokemon that can (keep) prove to be an annoyance with Scald burns. In the same vein, Empoleon can switch into most Water-type Pokemon and set up Stealth Rock, use Defog, or Roar out Pokemon like Gyarados and Manaphy that try to set up on Mega Scizor. Magnezone can also check Water-type Pokemon and can trap physically defensive Skarmory, which easily walls this set. Choice Scarf Excadrill can check the Fire-type Pokemon that have no trouble with this set, and it also does well against Fire teams in general, where this Mega Scizor is especially deadweight. Doublade and Skarmory can relieve pressure on Mega Scizor by checking Fighting- and Ground-types, respectively.</p>"

    "overview": "<h3>Rock</h3> <p>With access to Sticky Web and Stealth Rock, Shuckle becomes an amazing utility option for Rock teams. Shuckle's part-Bug typing negates its weakness to Ground, Grass, and Fighting, allowing it to survive attacks from Pokemon like Nidoking, Mega Venusaur, and Hawlucha. Sticky Web slows down faster threats like Choice Scarf Excadrill and Mega Gallade for teammates like Mega Diancie and Terrakion. Shuckle's insane defensive stats give it longevity and the chance to set up both entry hazards. Sturdy guarantees Shuckle gets at least one entry hazard up by allowing it to survive a super effective attack from Pokemon like Kingdra. Shuckle should be utilized on early turns to perform its role due to its lack of recovery stacked with its Stealth Rock weakness. As one would expect, this set isn't meant to do damage whatsoever, as its best form of damage is through its utility, leaving it reliant on teammates to pick up KOs.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Rock</h4> <p>Shuckle can utilize a Custap Berry alongside its ability in Sturdy to set up a second entry hazard; however, without Mental Herb, Shuckle is more vulnerable to being stopped by Taunt users like Mew and Gliscor.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Breloom</strong>: Breloom can put Shuckle to sleep with Spore, set up Swords Dance, and sweep the entire team with Mach Punch.</p> <p><strong>Mega Diancie</strong>: Mega Diancie can easily switch into Shuckle's attacks thanks to Magic Bounce and make its moves useless.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Once Mental Herb has been used or removed by Knock Off, Shuckle is at risk of being shut down by Taunt users like Cobalion, Mew, and Gliscor.</p>",

Stealth Rock chips down Flying-types and Levitate Pokemon like Landorus-T and Latias, which are unaffected by Sticky Web, and breaks the Focus Sash of Pokemon like Breloom. Encore is important to prevent Shuckle from being used as setup fodder to Pokemon like Mega Scizor and Mega Gyarados while also opening up opportunities to bring its teammates in safely. Knock Off is a great utility move that cripples defensive Pokemon like Chansey, Porygon2, Tentacruel, and Rotom-W as well as revenge killers like Kyurem-B, Choice Scarf Heracross, and Landorus. Toxic allows Shuckle to cripple bulky Pokemon like Slowbro, Mandibuzz, and Swampert. Mental Herb is needed so Shuckle isn't shut down by stallbreakers like Mew and Gliscor carrying Taunt. 248 HP EVs allow Shuckle to be 5HKOed by Stealth Rock while the rest of the EVs are dumped into Shuckle's Defense to grant it more longevity against physical attackers like Mega Gallade and Garchomp.

Furthermore, its ability in Magic Bounce allows it to prevent entry hazards that could otherwise wear down Shuckle. Tyranitar can get rid of Psychic- and Ghost-types like Slowbro, Jirachi, and Jellicent and Pursuit trap faster Pokemon like Latios. Additionally, Tyranitar sets sand, which benefits Shuckle's longevity and in return, Shuckle can switch into Fighting-types like Hawlucha and Infernape for Tyranitar. Cradily can absorb Water-type attacks and threaten defensive Water- and Ground-types like Slowbro and Hippowdon with Giga Drain. Mega Aggron can target Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn with Fire Punch and KO Fairy- and Rock-types like Mega Gardevoir, Mega Diancie, and Cradily with Heavy Slam. Thanks to Solid Rock, Rhyperior can eat attacks from physical attackers like Garchomp and Mega Scizor and KO them with Ice Punch and Fire Punch. Omastar can utilize Sticky Web to outspeed Excadrill in sand after a Shell Smash, and it notably excels in the Ground matchup thanks to its Air Balloon and its coverage alongside Hidden Power Grass for Water-immune Pokemon like Gastrodon and Seismitoad.</p>"

Heracross is also one of the only viable users of Knock Off, giving it great utility for the team. Heracross can use Moxie to potentially sweep late-game after its checks are dealt with. While its Speed is middling and nothing impressive, it becomes a strong revenge killer with a Choice Scarf. It does have competition from the likes of Choice Scarf Terrakion, which is both faster and more powerful, but Heracross's resistances to Ground- and Grass-type moves, which few other Fighting Pokemon have, alongside its offensive presence help it fit on almost any Fighting team.</p>",

Close Combat is its other most powerful STAB attack, having good coverage with Megahorn to hit most types at least neutrally. Pursuit allows Heracross to specifically hit Victini that try to switch out. Alternatively, Heracross can use Knock Off to hit Ghost-type Pokemon, which resist its STAB moves, while also removing items such as Eviolite or Leftovers from its foes. Stone Edge allows Heracross to deal meaningful damage to Flying- and Bug-type Pokemon, which also resist its STAB moves, and also hits Fire-type Pokemon that seek to threaten Heracross.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EV investment alongside a Jolly nature and a Choice Scarf lets Heracross outspeed +1 Jolly Gyarados, Choice Scarf-using base 80s such as Togekiss and Gardevoir and all unboosted Pokemon except for Deoxys-S. 252 Attack EVs make Heracross as powerful as possible, which is important for helping it revenge kill foes and clean late-game. Moxie gives Heracross the additional power to set up a sweep late-game Moxie Choice Scarf Heracross is especially devastating to Psychic teams after Victini is taken care of.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Heracross should mainly be used to revenge kill slower threats, such as Latios. Knock Off should be used liberally early-game to remove key items from threats, such as Eviolite from Doublade, Leftovers from Skarmory, and Choice Scarf from Togekiss. Since its defenses are unimpressive, Heracross should avoid switching into unresisted attacks to keep itself healthy for cleaning late-game. Moxie Heracross should be especially careful, as chip damage adds up and makes its late-game sweep much harder to set up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Heracross fits on almost any Fighting team, thanks to its ability to take on Psychic teams. It does greatly appreciate Stealth Rock support, though, as it commonly just barely lacks the power to KO certain threats, making Infernape and Cobalion great teammates for that purpose. Cobalion can additionally help handle the Fairy-types that outright wall Heracross and can act as a good defensive pivot. Infernape on the other hand is a more offensive Stealth Rock user and beats the certain Steel-types that wall Heracross such as Doublade, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor.

  "Skarmory": {
    "overview": "<p>Skarmory is a necessity on Steel teams because of its invaluable defensive utility. Skarmory's Flying typing gives it a Ground immunity and Fighting neutrality, which, along with its massive Defense stat, helps check major threats to Steel teams such as Excadrill and Mega Gallade. With Roost and Leftovers, Skarmory can stay healthy throughout most games to check multiple threats, and Whirlwind prevents it from being setup fodder. Skarmory can also provide Spikes to help wear down the opposing team through the switches it forces. However, Skarmory is very vulnerable to special attackers, and it can fall short in checking wallbreakers such as Nidoking and Landorus.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Flying</h4> <p>Spikes allows Skarmory to chip down foes such as Kyurem-B and Volcarona so teammates such as Landorus, Tornadus-T, and Dragonite can revenge kill them with ease. Counter can be used over Whirlwind to score a surprise OHKO against physical threats such as Mega Gallade, Bisharp, and Mega Heracross.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Flying</h4> <p><strong>Magnezone</strong>: Magnezone takes on Skarmory with its Electric STAB moves and prevents Skarmory from switching out with Magnet Pull.</p> <p><strong>Bisharp</strong>: Defiant from Bisharp makes using Defog difficult for Skarmory. On top of this, the best Skarmory can do is phaze Bisharp with Whirlwind to prevent Bisharp from using it as setup bait.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers such as Latios and Volcarona can easily break past Skarmory due to its low Special Defense without much it can do in return. However, they do not appreciate being Toxic poisoned if Skarmory has Sturdy intact. Volcarona also needs to watch out for Brave Bird if Skarmory's Sturdy is intact.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Stallbreakers with Taunt such as Mew, Mega Gyarados, Sableye, and Gliscor prevent Skarmory from using its utility moves, completely shutting it down.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Pokemon such as Choice Band Dragonite and Choice Band Diggersby can 2HKO Skarmory with Fire Punch, and special attackers such as Porygon2 can take it on with Discharge.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Skarmory does not appreciate burn wearing it down quick or paralysis making its job as a Defogger and physical sponge more difficult.</p>",

Spikes allows Skarmory to chip away grounded Pokemon. Whirlwind forces out setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Mega Tyranitar, and it can also help rack up residual damage on the enemy team. Sturdy provides Skarmory with a way to guarantee an attack or status move against threats such as Victini and Volcarona.</p> <p>All teammates on Steel, particularly offensive ones, appreciate Skarmory's Spikes support and defensive utility. Heatran can switch into Fire-type moves, exert pressure against Bug and opposing Steel teams, and check Fire-types like Victini, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona with Earth Power + Stone Edge. Ferrothorn can take care of bulky Ground / Water types like Gastrodon and Swampert and switch into Electric- and Water-type attacks from threatening special attackers such as Thundurus and Kingdra. Both Heatran and Ferrothorn are alternative Stealth Rock setters that allow Skarmory to run Spikes. Choice Scarf Magnezone can provide pivot support and help eliminate Water- and Flying-types like Slowbro, Landorus, and Mega Charizard Y. Choice Scarf Excadrill is a spinner that pressures Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Choice Band Victini, as well as switching into Electric-types such as Mega Manectric and Thundurus. Mega Scizor is a setup sweeper that benefits from Skarmory's Spikes support and provides defensive utility with its Bug typing and access to Roost and U-turn. Bisharp provides utility with Knock Off, takes advantage of Defoggers with Defiant, and wears down offensive threats on types like Flying and Psychic with Sucker Punch. Choice Band Durant is another wallbreaker that can take advantage of Skarmory's Spikes, particularly to wear down Psychic teams. Bronzong is a special tank that can set Stealth Rock and help relieve some pressure from Skarmory by wearing down Fighting- and Ground-types like Landorus.</p> <h4>Other Options</h4> <h5>Steel</h5> <p>A lead set with Stealth Rock / Spikes / Taunt / Brave Bird and Custap Berry can be used on hyper offense teams; however, it is not a good option for balance teams.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <h5>Steel</h5> <p><strong>Magnezone</strong>: Magnezone can freely switch into Skarmory, trap it with Magnet Pull, and OHKO it with its STAB Electric-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Because of Skarmory's poor special bulk, powerful special attackers such as Kingdra, Landorus, and Kyurem-B threaten it.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Pokemon with super effective coverage such as Hydreigon, Deoxys-S, and Dragonite threaten Skarmory.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Pokemon with Taunt such as Mew, Thundurus, Gliscor, and Gyarados force Skarmory to use Brave Bird, which puts it into a bad position against bulky or Flying-resistant Pokemon.</p> <h5>Flying</h5> <p>Skarmory's sky-high physical bulk that allows it to wall threats such as Excadrill and reliable recovery cement it as a staple on Flying teams. Sturdy allows it to survive any attack from full health, allowing it to clear entry hazards with Defog and phaze threats with Whirlwind. Its Steel typing provides Flying teams with a neutrality to Ice- and Rock-type attacks and lets Skarmory check threats in Weavile and Terrakion. Its neutrality to Rock also allows it to take minimal damage from Stealth Rock and act as a reliable Defogger for Flying teams. However, Skarmory's downfall is its poor special bulk and low Speed, which allow a myriad of special attackers such as Latios, Zapdos, Volcarona, and Gengar to easily beat it. Skarmory is also reliant on its utility moves to succeed in battle, meaning Taunt users such as Mega Gyarados completely shut it down and prevent it from making any progress for Flying teams.</p>"

Toxic allows Skarmory to cripple other walls such as Porygon2, Mandibuzz, Cradily, and Hippowdon and lets its teammates such as Landorus more readily break through them. Rocky Helmet allows Skarmory to punish important contact moves such as Chansey's Seismic Toss, Mega Lopunny's High Jump Kick, and Mega Swampert's Waterfall. Maximum HP and Defense investment alongside an Impish nature allows Skarmory to take on physical threats such as Bisharp, Mega Gallade, and Choice Band Dragonite.</p> <p>All of Skarmory's teammates appreciate its ability to act as a physical sponge and tank attacks from Dragon-, Rock-, and Ice-types such as Choice Scarf Latias, Mega Diancie, and Mamoswine. Zapdos can form a Defog core with Skarmory and provide a switch-in to Electric-types such as Mega Manectric and Magnezone. Assault Tornadus-T can cover Skarmory's allergy to special attackers by tanking hits from powerful wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Latios while removing items from other walls with Knock Off and taking out special attacking threats. Landorus can take on Life Orb Kyurem-B and Victini as well as Steel-types such as Heatran, Empoleon, Ferrothorn, and Bronzong. Mega Charizard Y can break through common Stealth Rock setters such as Hippowdon and Swampert with Fire Blast and Solar Beam, respectively. Mega Charizard Y is also able to take on Volcarona and unboosted Deoxys-S for Skarmory. Mega Gyarados can act as a wincon in the Psychic matchup with Substitute + Dragon Dance + Crunch. It can also take on Ground teams single-handedly after two Dragon Dances, prevent walls such as Chansey from recovering HP with Taunt, and prevent phazers such as Swampert and Hippowdon from forcing it out. Thundurus is a great teammate in the Flying and Water matchup, hitting every single Pokemon for super effective damage with Thunderbolt, Grass Knot, and Hidden Power Ice. Additionally, it can act as an emergency check to faster threats such as Deoxys-S thanks to Prankster Thunder Wave. Dragonite can break through Dragon- and Steel-types Pokemon with STAB Outrage and coverage in Superpower and Fire Punch. It can also clean up weakened threats such as Volcarona, Deoxys-S, and Kyurem-B with Extreme Speed.</p>"

  "Kingdra": {
    "overview": "<h3>Water</h3> <p>Kingdra's claim to fame is in its Swift Swim ability, which allows it to outspeed almost the entire metagame in the rain. The rain will also boost the power of its already strong Water-type STAB attacks, making Kingdra an almost unstoppable wallbreaker as well as a very reliable sweeper, especially against offensive teams that rarely have easy ways to stop it. With access to Draco Meteor and Hydro Pump, Kingdra can deal massive damage to almost any target. While not spectacular, Kingdra has passable bulk, letting it shrug off attacks from most defensive Pokemon, making it safe to 2HKO many walls. That being said, Kingdra is overly dependent on having rain support to function. Without it, Kingdra is useless because it lacks speed and its Special Attack is rather unimpressive. Because of this, Kingdra all but requires at least one more teamslot to have a dedicated and reliable rain setter to reach its full potential.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Water</h4> <p>Kingdra doesn't have any viable other options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Water</h4> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey all but ignores everything Kingdra can throw at it and can set Stealth Rock, paralyze or poison Kingdra, and stall all of the turns of rain easily.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Because Kingdra relies heavily on switching in and out, entry hazard damage will add up very quickly and whittle its health down. When this is combined with priority moves or status such as burns or Toxic poison, Kingdra can take a lot of damage.</p> <p><strong>Gardevoir</strong>: As the main offensive user of Trace, Gardevoir is faster than Kingdra and can copy Swift Swim to outspeed Kingdra and OHKO it with Moonblast or Hyper Voice as it Mega Evolves, keeping the Speed boost for that turn. Furthermore, due to its Fairy typing, Gardevoir is immune to Kingdra's Draco Meteor, making it risky for Kingdra to Choice-lock into it.</p> <p><strong>Specially Invested Walls</strong>: Cradily and Gastrodon, on Rock and Ground teams respectively, can choose to heavily invest into Special Defense in order to prevent Kingdra from sweeping their teams, as their abilities prevent Kingdra from using its reliable Water-type STAB attacks and they will avoid the 2HKO from Draco Meteor. Ferrothorn utterly stops Kingdra short with or without investment due to its typing and defensive stats and can safely set up entry hazards, inflict status on Kingdra, or use Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: While it cannot switch directly into Draco Meteor, Mega Venusaur can check Kingdra easily by using Giga Drain to restore any lost health to avoid the 2HKO. Its Thick Fat ability also prevents Kingdra from taking it out with Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralysis will completely cripple Kingdra, as Kingdra will no longer have the speed to sweep. Walls do still need to be careful, though, as its strength is not diminished in the slightest.</p>",

      "Rain Sweeper (Water)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump deals ridiculous damage in rain and can 2HKO most walls, such as Mew, Zapdos, and even Slowbro, which resists it. Draco Meteor is a second STAB move to hit foes that resist Hydro Pump, such as Mega Venusaur and Slowbro. Signal Beam allows Kingdra to check Celebi. Ice Beam provides good coverage for hitting Grass-types without Draco Meteor's Special Attack drops and hits them harder than Dragon Pulse does. While Dragon Pulse lacks the power of Draco Meteor, it is exceptional in the Dragon matchup for sweeping. It's also generally a good Dragon-type STAB attack that can be used without the loss in momentum of Draco Meteor. Surf is the most reliable STAB attack for Kingdra, being more accurate than Hydro Pump and lacking the Special Attack drops of Draco Meteor. Instead of Surf, though, Scald can be used to try to burn switch-ins, but the damage Surf provides is generally more useful for cleaning purposes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EV investment makes sure Kingdra can at least Speed tie with opposing Kingdra in rain. Kingdra will also outspeed almost every viable Pokemon in the metagame including up to Choice Scarf Latios. A Modest nature is used with maximum Special Attack investment and Choice Specs to make Kingdra as strong as possible. Swift Swim is used to give Kingdra its incredible Speed in the rain so that it can sweep easily.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kingdra should mainly be used while rain is up, as its damage output and Speed are nothing impressive without the boosts. So, any time rain is up, try to bring Kingdra in safely so that it can fire off a strong STAB attack. Early-game, Kingdra can wallbreak to set up its, or a teammate's, late-game sweep. To make it easier for Kingdra to sweep, it should be kept as healthy as possible, so Kingdra should avoid taking damage, such as when rain is not up. Hydro Pump is generally safely used, as even Pokemon that resist it will take a serious amount of damage thanks to the rain boost. Be careful of using Draco Meteor, as turns of rain can be wasted when Kingdra is forced to switch out due to the Special Attack drop. Instead, it is a great tool for wallbreaking when there isn't rain, as it is stronger than Hydro Pump. Dragon Pulse is much more useful for sweeping Dragon teams, as Kingdra outspeeds their entire team and can OHKO every Dragon-type Pokemon except for Mega Latias. Unlike when it uses Draco Meteor, Kingdra won't need to keep switching out, so after Mega Latias is weakened, Kingdra has a quick sweep in the rain. Surf should only be used when revenge killing or cleaning, as Hydro Pump's damage is necessary to break many walls. Similarly, Ice Beam's main targets are only those weak to it and resistant to both of Kingdra's STAB attacks, as Hydro Pump in the rain and Draco Meteor outdamage it in most cases. Because it is so dependent on its Speed, Kingdra needs to avoid paralysis, which would make it incapable of sweeping at all.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Politoed is a necessary teammate to set rain with Drizzle. Notably, Eject Button Politoed can save a turn of rain and bring Kingdra in safely. It can carry Toxic for the few walls Kingdra cannot break, such as specially defensive Cradily, which can relatively safely Recover off Ice Beams while Toxic stalling, and specially defensive Gastrodon. To support it with Stealth Rock, Swampert and Empoleon are two great options. Mega Swampert also appreciates Kingdra being able to take out most of its checks and can sweep late-game easily. In return, it can even set Rain Dance to support Kingdra if it isn't already using Stealth Rock. Empoleon is an alternative Stealth Rock setter that pairs well defensively with Kingdra. Thanks to its Steel typing and good bulk, it can easily switch into Dragon- and Fairy-type attacks aimed at Kingdra. It can also run Defog to remove entry hazards such as Toxic Spikes to keep Kingdra healthy. Manaphy is a versatile option that can defeat many of Kingdra's few checks. With Tail Glow, it is capable of breaking Chansey with Scald; Mega Venusaur with Psychic; and Cradily, Gastrodon, and Ferrothorn with Ice Beam. It can also serve as another Rain Dance user to give Kingdra more opportunities to be useful. Choice Band Azumarill is the best physical wallbreaker to use with Kingdra, as Azumarill is capable of breaking most special walls that stop Kingdra. Specifically, with Superpower, it can break Chansey, Empoleon, Cradily, and Ferrothorn. As Kingdra needs to switch in and out due to the low number of rain turns and Draco Meteor stat drops, Starmie's Rapid Spin support can be greatly beneficial. It can also run Psychic to 2HKO Mega Venusaur, or even OHKO it on the switch thanks to Analytic. Starmie also serves as a fast Pokemon outside of rain, which can help with defeating opposing weather setters. As sweepers, Mega Gyarados and Mega Sharpedo are good teammates that easily take advantage of the holes in the opponent's team that Kingdra opens up, as Kingdra can easily take out most of their checks.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Porygon2 is the premier physically defensive wall for Normal-type teams, forming one half of the infamous Eviolite core that Normal-type teams are often built around. Even without EV investment, Porygon2 also boasts a respectable Special Defense stat when holding an Eviolite, which allows it to take hits from many special attackers such as Thundurus and Mega Diancie. Despite its role as a defensive Pokemon, Porygon2 has a diverse movepool that includes great attacking coverage, with moves such as Ice Beam and Discharge, and excellent support moves such as Recover and Toxic. Its wide range of options lets it check a wide variety of threats while also supporting both offensive and defensive teammates. However, Porygon2 exacerbates a Normal-type team's weakness to Knock Off users such as Bisharp because of its reliance on Eviolite. Additionally, its typing leaves it weak to the same attacks as the rest of the team and provides no useful resistances, which means Porygon2 must rely on its natural bulk when switching into attacks. Overall, Porygon2 is a staple on Normal teams because of its excellent bulk and diverse movepool.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Porygon2 may run Thunder Wave to support its offensive teammates with suboptimal Speed tiers. Foul Play is an option to prevent Mega Gallade from using Porygon2 as setup bait. Trace allows Porygon2 to better deal with Gliscor and Tornadus-T.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types can hit Porygon2 for super effective damage with STAB attacks to deal significant damage. Terrakion, Mega Gallade, and Mega Heracross are all especially threatening.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Trick</strong>: These remove Porygon2's Eviolite, leaving it unable to switch in on attacks and, in the case of Trick, locking it into one move, which prevents it from effectively utilizing its support movepool. Bisharp and Tornadus-T are common Knock Off users, while Latias and Gardevoir often run a Choice Scarf set with Trick.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Pokemon with Taunt prevent Porygon2 from spreading status or recovering off damage, which severely limits its effectiveness. Stallbreaker Mew is particularly troublesome, while a lead Infernape set threatens to set entry hazards and severely weaken Porygon2's teammates with its Fighting-type attack after Taunting Porygon2. Sableye is also a major threat; it can Taunt Porygon2, burn it with Will-O-Wisp, and Knock Off its Eviolite.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Status and entry hazards can whittle down Porygon2, preventing it from switching in on threats.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Pokemon such as Choice Specs Hydreigon and Mega Charizard Y can 2HKO Porygon2.</p>",

Ice Beam provides excellent attacking coverage and checks specific threats that are troublesome for Normal teams, such as Landorus, Gliscor, and Choice Band Dragonite. Toxic wears down opposing Pokemon, pairs nicely with Porygon2's natural bulk, and meshes well with the other defensive Pokemon on many Normal-type teams, such as Chansey and Staraptor. Discharge allows Porygon2 to hit Flying- and Water-types like Skarmory, Gyarados, and Empoleon. Hidden Power Fire is useful for luring and eliminating Steel-types, especially Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Bisharp.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite boosts Porygon2's defensive stats and is the only option for an item. Maximum HP and Defense investment with a Bold nature lets Porygon2 take physical hits. Despite Porygon2's excellent mixed bulk, mixed investment isn't preferred because Porygon2 is almost always paired with Chansey. Download grants Porygon2 a Special Attack boost against physically defensive foes. +1 Porygon2 2HKOes Skarmory with Discharge, OHKOes Mega Scizor with Hidden Power Fire after prior chip damage, 2HKOes Bisharp with Hidden Power Fire, and deals more damage to notable targets such as Tornadus-T, Excadrill, and Zapdos.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Utilize Porygon2's excellent Defense to switch in on opposing physical attackers. It can stand up to some of the most powerful physical wallbreakers in the metagame. Attacks such as Choice Band Excadrill's Earthquake do under 50% with maximum investment, while stronger wallbreakers like Choice Band Diggersby only have an approximately 20% chance to 2HKO. Because Porygon2 finds many opportunities to pivot in throughout a match, use it to spread status. As you're pivoting, use Recover liberally to keep Porygon2's health near full so it can switch in on opposing offensive threats. Eviolite grants Porygon2 good mixed defenses, which should be used to status mixed attackers that otherwise threaten the team. However, it must watch out for opposing Knock Off users, as it needs its Eviolite to reliably check opposing physical attackers. Porygon2 can stall out most physical attackers, notably the Dragon-types that threaten the rest of a Normal-type team, with Toxic + Recover.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Chansey makes an excellent teammate for Porygon2. It absorbs special attacks, sets entry hazards, spreads status, and is the perfect complement to Porygon2's physical bulk. Chansey's ability Natural Cure also makes it an excellent sponge for the status moves that are often aimed at Porygon2. Staraptor also makes an excellent defensive partner. It takes neutral damage from the Fighting-type attacks that threaten Porygon2 and has passable physical bulk thanks to Intimidate. Additionally, Staraptor can use Defog to clear entry hazards. Ditto complements Porygon2's defensive capabilities by punishing opponents that choose to utilize boosting moves to break through Porygon2. As a complement to the defensive partners listed above, Diggersby, Heliolisk, and Meloetta make great offensive partners for Porygon2. They appreciate the paralysis Porygon2 can spread and use it to outspeed potential revenge killers in the late-game. Mega Lopunny is an excellent Normal-type Mega Evolution to pair with Porygon2. It can take on Bisharp and Steel-types in general, which Porygon2 struggles against.</p>"

  "Tyranitar": {
    "overview": "<h3>Dark</h3> <p>Tyranitar forges its place on most Dark teams due to not only the defensive backbone it provides but also its offensive presence, allowing it to put pressure on the opponent's team. Tyranitar's defensive capabilities lie in its capacity to sponge special attacks thanks to its great special bulk and its ability Sand Stream giving it a Special Defense boost. It is also one of the most reliable Stealth Rock setters for Dark teams. Tyranitar also has great moves such as Thunder Wave, Fire Blast, and Stone Edge, helping it accomplish its role. Its secondary type in Rock brings Dark teams a key resistance to Fire-types, though it also opens up holes against Fighting-types, as it cannot withstand a STAB attack from them, and also makes it suffer weaknesses to a lot of types, notably Water and Ground. In addition, Tyranitar is cursed with a lack of reliable recovery, hindering its defensive capabilities. Despite its weaknesses, though, Tyranitar is one of the best options that Dark teams have, as it can check a plethora of specially offensive Pokemon that threaten Dark such as Volcarona and Gardevoir while also pressuring common Defog users like Zapdos and Skarmory.</p> <p>Mega Tyranitar can be utilized not only for defensive purposes but also for offensive purposes thanks to Dragon Dance. It is blessed with more bulk, allowing it to find more opportunities to set up. It also brings more offense to the table to 2HKO a lot of defensive threats such as Skarmory and Porygon2, although it is still crippled by its mediocre Speed compared to other offensive Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Dark</h4> <p>An offensive non-Mega Tyranitar set with Dragon Dance can be used, but it is too slow and Tyranitar's bulk and utility are more valuable.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Tyranitar is the most reliable setter of Stealth Rock for Dark teams. Stealth Rock is one of the best entry hazards in Monotype, as it deals lots of damage to types such as Flying and Fire and, more importantly for Dark teams, Bug. Thunder Wave cripples the opponent's Pokemon; it's great combined with Tyranitar's special bulk, crippling specially offensive Pokemon on the switch in and Kingdra. Stone Edge allows Dark teams to wear down not only Bug-types but also other important threats to Dark teams such as Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y. Rock Slide is an alternative option, as it nails the OHKO against the same threats with greater accuracy, but the difference of power is noticeable against bulkier Pokemon. Fire Blast helps Tyranitar take on annoying Steel-types such as Skarmory, Scizor, and Ferrothorn. Pursuit can also be used to trap Pokemon such as Victini and Gardevoir that would rather switch out against Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximized EVs in Special Defense and HP combined with a Sassy nature boost Tyranitar's capabilities in tanking special attacks, allowing it to survive super effective moves. Sand Stream gives Tyranitar a Special Defense boost under the sand, increasing its bulk while also breaking potential Focus Sashes on opposing Pokemon. Three items can be used to great effect on Tyranitar, the first being Leftovers, giving it passive recovery, since it lacks reliable recovery. The second item is Chople Berry, allowing it to not only withstand non-STAB Fighting-type moves but also survive Mega Gardevoir's Focus Blast and cripple them with Thunder Wave. Tyranitarite gives it slightly more bulk, Speed, and Attack and allows it to beat specially offensive Pokemon such as Mega Gardevoir, which falls into Pursuit's KO range after some switches into Stealth Rock. The only downside is that, by using Tyranitarite, you won't be able to use other Dark-type Mega Evolutions such as Mega Sharpedo.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tyranitar is a good lead, as it can cripple a Pokemon with Thunder Wave, set up Stealth Rock, and beat common Defoggers such as Zapdos, Mandibuzz, and Skarmory. Don't recklessly let Tyranitar faint, as it is helpful for the whole game to easily sponge most special attacks, but do not hesitate to switch it in on such moves, as it can give you momentum. The usage of both Stone Edge and Fire Blast helps a lot in the matchup against Bug teams. Keep Tyranitar healthy, especially against Psychic and Bug teams to deal with threats such as Volcarona and Mega Gardevoir. If Pursuit is ran, keep Tyranitar alive and switch it into Choice-locked Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Gardevoir, and Victini. Tyranitar's Sand Stream is used to deter the opponent's Focus Sash Pokemon, such as Breloom and Infernape on Fighting; break Multiscale on Dragonite, which is a threat to Dark teams; and deny Mega Venusaur's ability to easily heal up with Synthesis.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sableye is a good Pokemon alongside Tyranitar not only due to its Ghost typing granting it immunity to both Fighting-type moves and Rapid Spin but also thanks to Prankster Will-O-Wisp, which can weaken physically offensive Pokemon for Tyranitar. Mandibuzz is another Pokemon that pairs well with Tyranitar, as it doesn't take sandstorm damage thanks to Overcoat and can tank physical Fighting-type moves while Tyranitar sponges special attacks directed towards Mandibuzz such as Ice Beam and Thunderbolt. Hydreigon mitigates Tyranitar's weaknesses to Grass, Water, and Ground thanks to its secondary typing in Dragon and ability in Levitate. It also has access to great coverage moves such as Flamethrower and Earth Power against Steel-types and Flash Cannon against Fairy-types. Cacturne is an option to OHKO Water-types like Rotom-W and Crawdaunt with Seed Bomb. Bisharp is another good choice, as thanks to its ability in Defiant, it can switch in on a potential Defog to boost its Attack.</p>"

      "Dragon Dance (Dark)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance boosts Tyranitar's already high Attack and its low Speed. Stone Edge provides coverage against a lot of types that trouble Dark such as Flying, Fire, and Bug. Crunch is another good STAB move that hits a lot of types neutrally, and without it, Tyranitar has trouble taking out bulky Psychic-types such as Slowbro and Mew. For the last move, Fire Punch notably takes on bulky Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Scizor, Magnezone, and Bisharp and is a more reliable move against Skarmory, while Ice Punch can be used to hit Ground- and Dragon-types such as Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximized EVs in Attack and Speed turn Tyranitar into a monster, as it has a phenomenal Attack when fully invested. Tyranitarite offers an increase in both bulk, giving it easier time setting up, and offense. Mega Tyranitar is slow compared to other offensive Pokemon, so a Jolly nature is used to outspeed some Pokemon after a Dragon Dance such as Alakazam, Tornadus, and Weavile.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tyranitar is best used at the end of the game, as it can serve as a powerful late-game sweeper after its checks, such as Breloom, Mega Lopunny, Scizor, and Choice Scarf users, have been removed. It is better to set up on specially offensive Pokemon that don't have effective coverage against Tyranitar, such as Zapdos, Hydreigon, and Latias. Don't let Tyranitar take damage prior to setting up, as it has no means of recovery, and don't let it fall victim to a status move, since it is also heavily crippled by status conditions. It can also be used as a strong wallbreaker mid-game after a Dragon Dance, allowing it to remove physical walls, which gives opportunities to Weavile and Bisharp to sweep late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard setters, such as Krookodile, are preferred on the team as it allows weakens the foe allowing Mega Tyranitar to achieve easier OHKOs especially against Flying-, and Fire-type teams. Sableye can absorb Fighting moves and spread burns, allowing Tyranitar to set up on offensive Pokemon more easily. Mandibuzz is another great Pokemon by Tyranitar's side because it is able to sponge attacks, especially from Fighting-types, has a useful move in Foul Play, and can utilize Defog to remove hazards, such as Sticky Web. Tyranitar has no way of taking on Fighting-types, so Choice Scarf Honchkrow appreciated, as they can clean the field for it. Crawdaunt can be used alongside Tyranitar to take on bulky Ground-types, which are troublesome for Tyranitar. Bisharp can take on Fairy-types, especially Sylveon and Clefable, and also has access to Sucker Punch, which can weaken or OHKO faster threats.</p>"

  "Breloom": {
    "overview": "<h3>Fighting</h3> <p>Breloom is the only Fighting-type with access to Spore, which allows it to set up easily and has perfect accuracy. Its ability Technician gives a boost to its attacks that have less than 60 Base Power such as Mach Punch, Bullet Seed, and Rock Tomb. Breloom's typing helps Fighting's Ground and Water matchup, and due to its access to a priority STAB move in Mach Punch, it is able to check many faster threats. With a Focus Sash and access to Mach Punch, Breloom can effectively check many threats to Fighting-type teams, including weather sweepers like Kingdra, Excadrill, and Mega Swampert. Its access to Swords Dance also lets Breloom wallbreak more efficiently, and it works especially well with Mach Punch. On the other hand, Breloom has low defensive and Speed stats, which means it often has to rely on priority to attack the foe before they can attack it. It can get revenge killed without difficulty, and it can't switch into most unresisted attacks. Breloom relies on Rock Tomb as coverage due to its STAB types being mediocre offensively. Lastly, Breloom's typing is pleasant but opens up more weaknesses.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Fighting</h4> <p>Toxic Orb + Poison Heal can be used over Focus Sash and Technician. Poison Heal allows Breloom to be a stallbreaker and can actually make it very threatening to slow balanced teams, with moves such as Swords Dance, Substitute, Focus Punch, Leech Seed, Facade, and Seed Bomb being used. Naturally, it is a bit more of a liability against fast offensive teams. The downside to this set is that it can be easily revenge killed and is no longer a good lead.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Fighting</h4> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types tend to resist both of Breloom's STAB attacks, and they check Breloom defensively but need to be careful of Rock Tomb and Spore. Skarmory especially resists Bullet Seed and takes little damage from Mach Punch. It does need to be careful of Spore + Swords Dance variants, because Breloom can potentially boost enough to break it. Faster Flying-types such as Togekiss and Tornadus-T are good checks to Breloom because of its 4x weakness to Flying.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Venusaur, Celebi, and Whimsicott are immune to Spore, resist both of Breloom's STAB moves, and can retaliate with a super effective STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types resist Breloom's Fighting STAB moves and can OHKO with their own STAB moves. They generally do need to be careful of switching in, however. Spore and Bullet Seed threaten any Fairy-type that does not resist them such as Azumarill or Diancie.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Charizard, Volcarona, and Victini can generally switch into a Mach Punch and OHKO Breloom with a Fire STAB move, though they need to avoid Rock Tomb.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-type Pokemon resist both of Breloom's STAB moves and can easily KO it in return with their STAB moves. Pokemon like Nidoking and Gengar take neutral damage from Bullet Seed, and they can OHKO Breloom with Sludge Wave.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types resist Breloom's Mach Punch. Latias, Latios, Victini, and Jirachi, in particular, resist Bullet Seed and are especially problematic for Breloom to handle.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Breloom can use Mach Punch against faster threats, but Pokemon that don't take super effective damage generally don't care. This includes Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Victini, Choice Scarf Heracross, and Kingdra.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types ignore Mach Punch completely. Chandelure also has a Fire typing, Gengar is faster and is part Poison, and Doublade resists Rock Tomb and Bullet Seed and does not fear Swords Dance.</p>",

      "Technician (Fighting)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spore puts the foe to sleep, forcing switches, and covers weaknesses by allowing Breloom to easily eliminate threats. Mach Punch is a great priority move, as it is boosted by both STAB and Technician. It also allows Breloom to act as a very powerful revenge killer and late-game sweeper. Bullet Seed is another STAB move, which breaks through Substitute and Focus Sash and also gets boosted by Technician. It notably breaks through the many bulky Water- and Ground-type Pokemon that give Fighting trouble, such as Huge Power Azumarill, Hippowdon, Gastrodon, Jellicent, and Slowbro. Rock Tomb provides nice coverage to hit Fire- and Flying-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Victini, Togekiss, and Zapdos, and it can pressure the opponent into switching out. Swords Dance is used to increase Breloom's damage output, allowing it to easily sweep late-game. The Attack boost also allows Breloom to break walls it normally wouldn't be able to. Swords Dance has good synergy with Spore, as Breloom can easily set up on most sleeping targets.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Technician is used to increase the damage output of Breloom's weaker attacks. Focus Sash allows Breloom to take a hit and retaliate, allowing it to OHKO threats such as Mega Charizard Y. It also allows Breloom to act as a great anti-lead in conjunction with Spore. Most leads do not threaten Breloom, with the exception of some Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Togekiss and Grass-types. Life Orb is also an option, as it increases Breloom's damage output. The EVs maximize Breloom's attacking potential, as well as its Speed. A Jolly nature is used to outspeed threats like Zapdos. An Adamant nature can be used to increase damage done to Pokemon such as Excadrill and Chansey.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Breloom can be used as a lead to beat out other leads such as Tyranitar and Shuckle and put them to sleep, as well as force them to switch out. Faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Victini and Choice Scarf Landorus-T are required to U-turn out to avoid Spore, allowing you to either use Rock Tomb and slow down the switch-in or put it to sleep for free. If Swords Dance is being run, it should mainly be used against sleeping foes or very passive walls that cannot touch Breloom, because Breloom's bulk is very poor and it cannot take hits from anything. Once its Spore has been used, it should aim to do as much damage to the team as possible. Spore should be saved for either Breloom's checks or threats to the team in general. Doublade and Mega Scizor are particularly notable threats, as they both beat Breloom and can threaten to sweep a weakened Fighting team, so it's best to put them to sleep first. At times, it's better to preserve Breloom to revenge kill foes with Mach Punch later in the game. Breloom should be cautious when switching into attacks, as even resisted attacks are a serious problem. Breloom doesn't appreciate any status; for example, it needs to avoid burns, which cripple it entirely. In spite of Mach Punch's priority, paralysis is also still a big issue for it. Try to prevent entry hazards from being set, as they break Breloom's Focus Sash, meaning Breloom loses most of its pressure when hazards are up. Grass-type Pokemon, Overcoat users, and Magic Bounce users can avoid Spore, so be cautious when using it against these Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cobalion provides Stealth Rock, which wears down a good variety of Pokemon, and it can assist Breloom with Fairy-types. Breloom pairs very well with setup sweepers such as Mega Gallade and Hawlucha that can take advantage of the free turns provided by Spore. Since Breloom gets walled by Pokemon that resist its attacks, such as Mega Venusaur and Mandibuzz, wallbreakers such as Mega Gallade are appreciated. Mega Gallade is used to break Skarmory, Venusaur, and Zapdos. Both appreciate Breloom beating Water-types such as Slowbro. Infernape can easily beat up Doublade and Mega Scizor with its Fire-type STAB moves, both of which are problematic for Breloom. Faster revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Terrakion and Choice Scarf Heracross are very useful for helping Breloom against the faster foes that it generally has more problems with, and Terrakion checks Fire- and Flying-types.</p>"

  "Manectric": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Manectric is Electric's fastest pivot, sporting a base 135 Speed stat that lets it outspeed most of the unboosted metagame, including Weavile and Latios, allowing it to gain momentum off of the opponent's switches with Volt Switch. Prior to Mega Evolving, Manectric still has a good base 105 Speed, which lets it outspeed threats such as Garchomp and Landorus along with the highly populated base 100 Speed tier. Mega Manectric also has decent base 135 Special Attack and access to Overheat and Flamethrower, which allow it to deal with Grass-types that could switch into its Electric-type attacks such as Ferrothorn. Before it Mega Evolves, Manectric can use Static to fish for paralyzes against Pokemon attacking it with a contact move. Mega Manectric gains Intimidate when it Mega Evolves, which it can use to support its teammates by lowering the opposing Pokemon's Attack. However, its main asset is its high Speed, as its Special Attack is too low to break through most walls. Mega Manectric also can’t use Intimidate to its best effect because of poor physical bulk, and it doesn't add any particularly good resistances to Electric-type teams. Using Mega Manectric comes with the price of not using Mega Ampharos, which has a better defensive typing and more Special Attack. Nevertheless, Mega Manectric is still a viable option for offensive Electric teams because of its high Speed and offensive coverage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mega Manectric doesn’t have a wide movepool; its common set runs almost all of the coverage it has. Hidden Power Grass can be used over Hidden Power Ice to 2HKO physically defensive Gastrodon and sometimes OHKO non-Assault Vest variants of Seismitoad, but then Mega Manectric is completely walled by Dragon-types. Protect is also an option to let Mega Manectric safely gain Speed on the turn that it Mega Evolves, but then it can't use either Thunderbolt or Volt Switch, so it's usually not worth it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Mega Manectric is unable to break through most of the tier's specially defensive walls such as Zapdos and Clefable, and the latter can set up on it with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can recover health with Soft-Boiled and wear down Mega Manectric with Toxic and Seismic Toss while taking minimal damage due to its unmatched special bulk.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: Mega Venusaur takes little damage from all of Mega Manectric's moves because of Thick Fat and can recover its health with Synthesis.</p> <p><strong>Lanturn</strong>: Because of its Water typing and Volt Absorb, Lanturn is able to safely switch into all of Mega Manectric's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers and Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Mega Manectric is susceptible to being revenge killed by faster Pokemon, such as Choice Scarf Excadrill.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon</strong>: Most Ground-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Mamoswine check Mega Manectric because they are immune to its STAB moves and can KO it with their Ground-type STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Residual damage from poison, burn, and entry hazards tends to stack up when Mega Manectric uses Volt Switch often, making it easier for priority users to pick it off.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon</strong>: Most Dragon-type Pokemon resist Electric- and Fire-type moves, aren't OHKOed or 2HKOed by Hidden Power Ice, and can OHKO Mega Manectric in return.</p>",

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch can be used to pivot out of Mega Manectric's checks as well as gain momentum by forcing switches. Thunderbolt is a secondary STAB move and is stronger than Volt Switch that also doesn't force Mega Manectric to switch. Hidden Power Ice is used to hit Ground- and Dragon-types that resist or are immune to Mega Manectric's other moves, such as Landorus and Dragonite. Flamethrower hits Grass-types such as Breloom harder than Hidden Power Ice. Overheat can be used instead for more power and to OHKO Ferrothorn and Excadrill, but it lowers Mega Manectric's Special Attack, which can force it to switch out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature are used to maximize Mega Manectric's Speed to better revenge kill opposing Pokemon. 252 Special Attack EVs are used to hit as hard as possible. Static gives Manectric a chance to paralyze Pokemon making contact with it. Manectite is required to Mega Evolve, which gives Mega Manectric a huge Speed increase and Intimidate, enabling it to outspeed threats such as Mega Diancie and patch up its poor Defense, respectively.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is better to Mega Evolve Manectric early-game to gain the Speed increase and force Pokemon such as Landorus out. Intimidate helps force out frail physical attackers such as Weavile, but bringing Mega Manectric into attacks isn’t a good idea because it has a bad defensive typing and is frail even with Intimidate. However, Mega Manectric can still Intimidate the foe and then use Volt Switch to gain momentum by switching to another Pokemon that can deal with the foe's weakened attacks. Instead of trying to unsuccessfully break through walls, Mega Manectric should use Volt Switch to switch to a teammate that can break through the opposing Pokemon.  If the opponent has an Electric immunity, be careful when using STAB attacks because Manectric is unlikely to OHKO most Ground-types with Hidden Power Ice if they switch into an Electric-type attack, and Mega Manectric will be KOed in return. Bringing Mega Manectric in before entry hazards have been removed is generally a bad idea because it will easily get worn down by them and, when combined with constant damage from status, left susceptible to priority such as Weavile's Ice Shard.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Manectric forms a great VoltTurn core with most Electric-types. It can apply constant pressure by pivoting into wallbreaking teammates such as Thundurus and Magnezone with Volt Switch. Magnezone is an invaluable teammate because, with Choice Specs, it can break through walls that Mega Manectric cannot and also 2HKOes Mega Venusaur with Flash Cannon. Life Orb Thundurus is a good partner because it can cripple faster threats to Mega Manectric with Prankster Thunder Wave. Thundurus can also use Grass Knot, which hits most Ground-type Pokemon relatively hard, or use a physical set to help beat the Porygon2 plus Chansey core. Thundurus and Mega Manectric can also allow one of them to sweep by the other weakening their similar checks. Zapdos is a great partner for Mega Manectric because it is bulky enough to take attacks that are directed at Mega Manectric, especially after Intimidate. Zapdos is immune to Ground-type moves, can Defog the entry hazards that would chip away at it, and can spread status with Toxic, which can break walls Mega Manectric can't such as Gastrodon. Rotom-W has Levitate and can use its STAB Hydro Pump to deal with Ground-type Pokemon that would threaten Mega Manectric, as well as spread burns with Will-O-Wisp while greatly appreciating Mega Manectric's Intimidate. Eelektross has Levitate and is a physical attacker with access to Knock Off and Drain Punch, allowing it to pressure Porygon2 and Chansey.</p>"

  "Sharpedo": {
    "overview": "<h3>Water</h3> <p>With a deadly combination of Speed Boost before Mega Evolution and power after, Mega Sharpedo has cemented itself as the best sweeper on Water teams and one of the most dangerous Pokemon to play around. It also sits at a great Speed tier, allowing it to clean and outspeed threats like Choice Scarf Victini, Deoxys-S, Thundurus, and Latios after a Speed boost. However, its paper-thin defenses leave it prone to revenge killing from priority users like Breloom and Dragonite. Sharpedo also needs to have the opposing team weakened sufficiently before Mega Evolving or risk losing its Speed boost if it's forced out after Mega Evolution. Finally, Mega Sharpedo competes with Mega Gyarados and Mega Swampert for a Mega slot. Mega Gyarados is a bulkier setup sweeper that offers a Ground immunity to Water teams prior to Mega Evolving, whereas Mega Swampert acts as a fantastic wallbreaker and sweeper on rain teams.</p> <h3>Dark</h3> <p>Through its great offensive stats that prevent it from being hard walled by physically defensive Pokemon and its access to Speed Boost pre-Mega Evolution, Mega Sharpedo is one of the best Mega Evolutions available to Dark teams. Its ability, Strong Jaw, allows it to run Ice Fang effectively and boosts the damage output from Crunch immensely. Although it gains slight boosts to its defensive stats, Mega Sharpedo still isn't able to take even resisted attacks well and it has to give up a moveslot in order to run Protect to make use of its base forme's ability. Mega Sharpedo also faces competition for the Mega slot from Mega Tyranitar, as both play the role of a sweeper. Regular Sharpedo can be run with with Life Orb as a great special attacker, allowing it to sweep late-game or weaken opposing teams for another teammate to clean. Both Sharpedo and Mega Sharpedo also rely heavily on teams being weakened in order to net KOs on most Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Water</h4> <p>Destiny Bond is a viable option on more offensive teams that allows Mega Sharpedo to act as an emergency check to an immediate threat, like Ferrothorn. However, Destiny Bond is extremely situational and the additional coverage in Ice Fang or Hydro Pump is more useful.</p> <h4>Dark</h4> <p>Destiny Bond can be utilized to gain a potential KO on a threat to the team that Sharpedo can't KO; however, it limits Sharpedo's coverage options even further. Poison Jab is an option to hit Fairy teams harder, although the coverage sees little use outside of that matchup and Fairy-types are generally handled better by Mega Sharpedo's teammates. Zen Headbutt is another option but only offers coverage against Fighting-type Pokemon, as Crunch does more damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Timid is a viable nature for Sharpedo but the drop in damage output is very noticeable and the only notable benefit from running it is being able to outspeed and deal a decent amount of damage to Choice Scarf Heracross after only one boost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Water</h4> <p><strong>Colbur Berry Lures</strong>: Psychic-types like Slowbro, Reuniclus, and Celebi often carry Colbur Berry to lure in and either OHKO Mega Sharpedo or cripple it with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur can take a hit from Mega Sharpedo and KO it back.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types like Terrakion can take a hit from Mega Sharpedo and KO it back. However it needs to be wary of Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Most Fairy-types, like Azumarill and Clefable, can easily switch into and KO Mega Sharpedo. In particular, Calm Mind Clefable, a huge threat to Water teams, can use Mega Sharpedo as setup bait.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Attacks like Mach Punch from Breloom, Extreme Speed from Dragonite, and Quick Attack from Diggersby can either OHKO Mega Sharpedo or KO it after some prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Generally bulky Pokemon like Porygon2, Mandibuzz, and Alomomola can switch into and KO or status Mega Sharpedo. Although it cannot switch into Mega Sharpedo, defensive Mega Gardevoir can live a hit from Mega Sharpedo and OHKO it with Hyper Voice, even if Mega Sharpedo is behind a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Any form of status can effectively end Mega Sharpedo's sweep.</p> <h4>Dark</h4> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Heracross can take any standard attack from full HP and OHKO back with their STAB attacks, though Zen Headbutt can threaten them.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Azumarill and Clefable can take any attack from Sharpedo and OHKO it back with their STAB move, although they can't switch in on a Poison Jab.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Many Grass-types are capable of taking the standard Ice-type coverage move run by Sharpedo if they are at full HP and can OHKO back with their STAB moves. Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur in particular can take any attack and OHKO with Power Whip and Giga Drain, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Mach Punch from Breloom and Extreme Speed from Choice Band Dragonite threaten to OHKO Mega Sharpedo without any prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Paralysis makes Sharpedo more susceptible to being revenge killed as a result of the drop in Speed. Poison and burns wear down Sharpedo, making it harder for it to sweep.</p> <p><strong>Mixed Walls</strong>: Pokemon that are bulky in both Defense and Special Defense are able to beat Sharpedo by slowly whittling it. Alomomola and Porygon are both able to Toxic stall it, and the latter has also access to Discharge and Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Unexpected Items</strong>: Slowbro and Mew can both tank any attack from Sharpedo with Colbur Berry and use Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp, though the latter just wears down the Life Orb set.</p>",

      "Speed Boost Sweeper (Water)": {
        "description": "<p>Protect is a necessity on the set to grab a safe Speed boost prior to Mega Evolving. Crunch is Mega Sharpedo's strongest and most spammable move, allowing it to easily run through Psychic and Ghost teams and clean up weakened teams. Substitute gives Mega Sharpedo a way to take advantage of the switches it forces. Alongside Protect, Substitute lets Sharpedo stack up Speed boosts and stall out a foe's attack. Ice Fang gives Mega Sharpedo a Strong Jaw-boosted coverage move against Ground-, Dragon-, and Flying-types like Garchomp, Dragonite, and Landorus. Hydro Pump is an alternative to Ice Fang that lets Mega Sharpedo break through the defensive Flying core of Skarmory and Zapdos. If choosing to use Hydro Pump, a Naughty nature is preferred to net crucial KOs against Flying Pokemon, most notably OHKOing Thundurus with Crunch. An optional 28 EVs can be invested into Special Attack to guarantee a 2HKO on Leftovers Skarmory. 4 EVs in Special Defense prevents Download users like Porygon2 from getting a Special Attack boost before Sharpedo Mega Evolves. Make sure to not Mega Evolve too early in a game when defensive checks to Mega Sharpedo haven't been weakened enough or priority users like Breloom are still alive.</p> <p>Mega Sharpedo fits on a wide variety of Water teams due to its ability to easily sweep through teams with minimal support. Tentacruel is a fantastic partner to Mega Sharpedo thanks to Toxic Spikes, which Mega Sharpedo's Substitute and Protect use to wear down foes into its OHKO range. Similarly, Suicune has great synergy with the Mega Sharpedo + Tentacruel core because it can stall the opposing team with Substitute + Protect, making it easier for Mega Sharpedo to clean up later. Empoleon can set Stealth Rock to gradually wear teams down and phaze Calm Mind Clefable with Roar. Empoleon and Tentacruel can also lure Colbur Berry users, like Slowbro and Celebi, with Knock Off. Furthermore, both of them can remove entry hazards for Mega Sharpedo. Swampert also sets Stealth Rock and can lure in and KO Mega Venusaur with Rindo Berry + Mirror Coat. Seismitoad is an alternative Electric-immune Stealth Rock setter that can cripple bulky answers to Mega Sharpedo, like Mandibuzz and Porygon2, with Toxic and check foes like Thundurus in rain. Wallbreakers like Azumarill and Manaphy can soften up the opposing team for Mega Sharpedo and weaken checks like Porygon2, Ferrothorn, and Mandibuzz. Starmie can take care of Fighting-types that wall and check Mega Sharpedo, such as Terrakion as well. Kingdra and Mega Sharpedo complement one another as cleaners on rain teams; Kingdra can wallbreak for Mega Sharpedo with its strong rain-boosted Hydro Pump. Shell Smash Cloyster can weaken shared checks and frees up the Ice Fang moveslot for Hydro Pump. Rotom-W can bring Mega Sharpedo safely into play through Volt Switch and can set screens to support its sweep. It can also cripple foes unaffected by Toxic Spikes with Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

      "Sweeper (Dark)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Protect is necessary in order to acquire boosts from Speed Boost before Mega Evolving and is also an option for scouting for an opposing Pokemon's set. Crunch is Mega Sharpedo's strongest attack and hits anything that doesn't resist it extremely hard due to Strong Jaw. Waterfall hits Ground, Rock, and Fire teams for more damage than Crunch and is also a good option for hitting Pokemon such as Heracross and Bisharp that resist Crunch. Waterfall also has a 20% flinch chance, which is really useful for Mega Sharpedo considering its high Speed and inability to take attacks well. Hydro Pump can be opted for over Waterfall to hit Skarmory and Hippowdon for a 2HKO. Ice Fang hits Grass, Dragon, and Flying teams for super effective damage and is also boosted by Strong Jaw, allowing Mega Sharpedo to get past Garchomp, Hydreigon, Shiftry, and Dragonite.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment allows Mega Sharpedo to deal as much damage as possible. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly Nature allows Mega Sharpedo to outpace any Choice Scarf user under base 105 Speed after just one Speed boost. A Naive Nature can be opted for when running Hydro Pump in order to make full use of Mega Sharpedo's Special Attack while still not taking increased damage from common physical priority such as Extreme Speed and Sucker Punch. Speed Boost is mandatory on Sharpedo in order to accumulate the necessary Speed for Mega Sharpedo to sweep. An Adamant nature can be used over a Jolly one for more damage output, but it leaves Mega Sharpedo outpaced by Choice Scarf Victini post-Mega Evolution and Choice Scarf Heracross pre-Mega Evolution if it has only acquired one Speed boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Sharpedo should utilize its base forme's ability to the fullest and accumulate as many boosts in Speed as possible in order to sweep. As a result of losing Speed Boost after Mega Evolving, Mega Sharpedo only has one opportunity to sweep with the boosts it gained. Protect also finds utility in allowing Mega Sharpedo to avoid damage from Fake Out and scouting for the move the opposing Pokemon is going for. Attempting a double Protect is an option if Mega Sharpedo needs to outspeed faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Terrakion or Choice Scarf Gengar. Mega Sharpedo should avoid switching in on attacks or taking status moves, as even with the boosts in its defenses gained by Mega Evolution it is still a frail Pokemon and its usefulness is hampered greatly by status. Sharpedo can be used early-game without Mega Evolving in order to chip away at teams or revenge kill in order to make it easier for it to clean late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Sharpedo appreciates Stealth Rock support offered by Tyranitar or Krookodile, as it puts Pokemon such as Mega Gallade into range of being OHKOed. Tyranitar is able to spread paralysis through Thunder Wave, making it easier for Mega Sharpedo to sweep even if it has not accumulated many Speed boosts. Mandibuzz is another great partner that offers both entry hazard control and physical bulk to lessen Mega Sharpedo's susceptibility to priority. It is also a good check for Fighting-type Pokemon, and a notable niche it has is being able to take on Breloom due to Overcoat blocking Spore. Sableye can also take Fighting-type attacks directed towards Mega Sharpedo and can spread burns in order to whittle teams down for Mega Sharpedo to clean later. Sableye and Bisharp can also function as hazard control deterrents, since Sableye's typing allows it to spinblock and Bisharp's ability Defiant helps it punish Defoggers. Bisharp and Crawdaunt are hard-hitting physical attackers that can weaken checks to Mega Sharpedo such as Porygon2, Ferrothorn, and Mandibuzz, although the latter's coverage is redundant with Mega Sharpedo's. Bisharp in particular is very threatening to Fairy-type Pokemon that trouble Mega Sharpedo. Knock Off support from users such as Weavile and Bisharp is generally appreciated, as items such as Eviolite and Leftovers can make it harder for Mega Sharpedo to sweep. Hydreigon and Weavile are able to beat physical walls like Mandibuzz, Porygon2, and Mega Venusaur.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb (Dark)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Protect must be run in order for Sharpedo to safely accumulate the boosts in Speed that it needs. Hydro Pump is Sharpedo's hardest hitting move and is able to OHKO most Fire-, Rock-, and Ground-types. Ice Beam offers good coverage by being able to hit Flying, Dragon, and Grass teams for more damage than any other of its moves. Dark Pulse completes Sharpedo's coverage by hitting Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon for more damage, as well as being its best option to hit Pokemon that resist its coverage. Dark Pulse also has a 20% chance to make the opposing Pokemon flinch, allowing Sharpedo to not have to take a hit that would likely OHKO it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb gives Sharpedo's attacks more power in exchange for its HP; however, Sharpedo isn't capable of taking most attacks and greatly appreciates being able to deal as much damage as possible while still having the ability to change moves. Maximum Special Attack investment gives Sharpedo's attacks as much damage output as possible. Maximum Speed investment allows Sharpedo to outspeed Choice Scarf base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Togekiss and Gardevoir. A Modest nature is utilized in order to maximize damage output. Speed Boost must be ran on Sharpedo in order for it to accumulate the Speed it needs to outpace and clean opposing teams.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Protect can be used for scouting and avoiding damage from Fake Out users like Mega Lopunny. Sharpedo should be used as a late-game cleaner, but it can also be used as a revenge killer against slower Pokemon on teams that can't switch into its coverage. Using Sharpedo early-game is an option to make it easier for it or a teammate to clean late-game. Sharpedo's mediocre defenses make it hard for it to even take resisted attacks well, and as a result it shouldn't be switched in on any attacks. Sharpedo is also extremely susceptible to priority, making it necessary for priority users to be gone when you attempt a late-game sweep. Sharpedo should avoid taking any form of status, as paralysis quarters its Speed and thus makes it easy to deal with it, while poison and burn wear it down quickly if considering Life Orb recoil as well. As a result of most people expecting Mega Sharpedo on Dark teams, Sharpedo can deal with the physical walls it lures in and can help pave the way for another sweeper on the team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sharpedo generally functions best on a more offense-oriented teams and appreciates Stealth Rock support from Tyranitar, Krookodile, or Bisharp in order to net the OHKOs it needs to sweep weakened teams. Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar is a great teammate for Sharpedo, as both of them are able to sweep and either one can be sacrificed to make it easier for the other to sweep. Tyranitar can also be used to tank special attacks and spread status through Thunder Wave while Sableye can spread burns to whittle opposing teams for Sharpedo. Sableye, and Mandibuzz can both serve as Fighting-type checks. Mandibuzz offers a form of entry hazard control and can run Toxic in order to weaken Pokemon like Gastrodon, Porygon2, and Cradily to help Sharpedo sweep late-game. Mandibuzz and Hydreigon are able to function as pivots with U-turn to bring in Sharpedo safely. Hydreigon is able to pressure teams and weaken them for Sharpedo to clean late-game. Sharpedo appreciates Mega Houndoom as a teammate, as the two are capable of weakening their shared checks and Mega Houndoom is also able to take on the Grass-type Pokemon that trouble Sharpedo such as Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur. Bisharp is able to take on Fairy-types, like Clefable and Klefki, that trouble Sharpedo and also weaken teams early-game for Sharpedo to clean. Sharpedo can also be used to get rid of checks to Bisharp such as Hippowdon, Gliscor, and Skarmory. Knock Off support is greatly appreciated, as there are many viable users of it, including Bisharp and Krookodile, and the removal of the opposing Pokemon's item makes it easier to pressure teams by getting rid of troublesome items like Eviolite and Assault Vest.</p>"

  "Latios": {
    "overview": "<h3>Psychic</h3> <p>With fantastic Special Attack, amazing Speed, and great STAB moves in Draco Meteor and Psyshock, Latios is easily one of the best wallbreakers in the Monotype metagame. Its great Speed allows it to outspeed common threats such as Galvantula, Landorus, Garchomp, and Mega Pinsir and function as a great revenge killer. Most teams in the format lack a solid Pokemon that resists Dragon; this makes Latios a fantastic wallbreaker and turns Draco Meteor into a very spammable move. To complement this, Latios has fantastic coverage moves in Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, Surf, and Hidden Power Fire to threaten its checks. Even though it has great offensive moves, Latios is not lacking in support moves either, as it has access to Defog to clear away entry hazards and Roost to improve its longevity. Furthermore, its decent defensive typing combined with an immunity to Ground-type moves due to Levitate lets it switch into most moves with ease. However, because of Latios's relatively average physical bulk, it is vulnerable to Choice Scarf users with U-turn such as Landorus-T and Victini and can be worn down and revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny and Weavile. Even though Latios has great Speed, it still faces Speed ties against other fast Pokemon such as Gengar, Mega Diancie, Latias, and opposing Latios.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Psychic</h4> <p>Latios can run a Calm Mind set to turn into a sweeper and further enhance its wallbreaking capabilities. Earthquake can be used on non-Surf variants to hit Steel-type Pokemon such as Heatran super effectively, which would otherwise wall it. Shadow Ball lets Latios hit Pokemon such as Doublade and Jirachi super effectively. Choice Specs can be used over Life Orb to give Latios more power, allowing it to KO most Pokemon. Although the extra power from Choice Specs is very beneficial, it locks Latios into one move. Choice Scarf is another viable item on Latios, as it boosts its Speed to amazing heights but locks it into one move while offering far less power than Life Orb. Furthermore, Victini outclasses Latios as a Choice Scarf user due to its STAB Fire-type moves on a Psychic team.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Psychic</h4> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Weavile can easily take Latios out, with Tyranitar tanking most of its hits and KOing with Crunch, Bisharp playing mind games against Latios with Sucker Punch and Knock Off, and Weavile outspeeding Latios and KOing it with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-type Pokemon such as Clefable and Klefki are all immune to Draco Meteor and take little damage from Psyshock. Azumarill and Mega Gardevoir can easily take a Psyshock from Latios and then KO it in return with their STAB Fairy-type moves. Clefable can set up Stealth Rock or Thunder Wave Latios, while Klefki can set up dual screens on it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Most Steel-type Pokemon wall Latios's STAB combination and can only be beaten with Hidden Power Fire. Additionally, Pokemon such as Mega Scizor and Doublade can easily set up on Latios.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Weavile, and Mega Lopunny all outspeed Latios and can weaken or even KO it with Knock Off and Ice Punch, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Mew and Porygon2 can all take Latios's attacks and stall it out, while Heatran can also set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can easily tank all of Latios's attacks and proceed to KO it with Seismic Toss or set up Stealth Rock against it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb Attacker (Psychic)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is Latios's strongest STAB move and can be used freely against most Pokemon. Psyshock is used to hit Fighting-type Pokemon such as Infernape and Terrakion and Poison-type Pokemon such as Nidoking, Mega Venusaur, and Tentacruel. It is also used to prevent a Special Attack drop and hit Dragon-resistant Pokemon. Psyshock is preferred over Psychic to threaten specially defensive Pokemon such as Zapdos by attacking their physical defense. Defog is used to clear away entry hazards for Latios's teammates. Roost improves Latios's longevity and allows it to switch in and out more easily. Hidden Power Fire can be used instead of Roost to beat Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Bisharp, and Scizor, the latter two being huge threats to Psychic teams. Using Hidden Power Fire, however, drops Latios's Speed by one point, making it incapable of Speed tying with Mega Diancie, Gengar, and opposing Latios. Surf allows Latios to threaten Fire-type Pokemon such as Heatran and Ground-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Excadrill while also hitting Steel-types for neutral damage. Ice Beam lets Latios threaten Flying-type Pokemon such as Togekiss, Zapdos, and Landorus without dropping its Special Attack through Draco Meteor but leaves it unable to damage the Steel-type Pokemon that severely threaten a Psychic team. Thunderbolt can be used to hit bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Azumarill, Gyarados, and Empoleon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment boosts Latios's Special Attack as much as possible without a boosting nature. A Timid nature with maximum Speed EVs is used to make Latios as fast as possible and allows it to Speed tie with other base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Latias, Gengar, and Mega Diancie. Life Orb boosts the power of Latios's attacks at the cost of having recoil damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Most teams in the Monotype metagame don't have great Latios counters, so playing aggressively with it can often break down opposing teams quickly. Because of its amazing Special Attack, Latios can easily KO or weaken Pokemon heavily with Draco Meteor early-game to help its teammates or itself clean up later, but one should be wary of overusing it, as it severely reduces Latios's Special Attack each time it's used. Latios should be kept until late-game because it's an excellent cleaner. If Latios has Roost, it should be liberal with using Defog; if it doesn't, however, one needs to be more careful with managing its health, as Life Orb will slowly chip away at its HP, so making sure it can Defog when it's necessary. If Latios has Roost, furthermore, it can freely switch in and out against most non-super effective hits and use it to heal itself. Latios is Pursuit bait and one should be careful if there is a Pursuit user on the opposing team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Latios and Mega Medicham work together greatly as an offensive duo. They can work together to break each other's checks and counters. Mega Medicham can threaten Dark-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Bisharp, while Latios can take care of Mandibuzz and Sableye. Mega Medicham also wears down Pokemon through its sheer power and use of Fake Out, letting Latios clean up late-game. Mega Gardevoir is another Mega Pokemon that can break cores together with Latios. Especially against Dark teams, Mega Gardevoir can deal with most Pokemon to let Latios clean up. Victini is another good partner for Latios, as it helps it deal with Bug-type Pokemon, which generally pose a problem for Latios. Furthermore, Victini is a good Choice Scarf user and can KO threats like Choice Scarf Heracross and Mega Pinsir with its STAB Fire-type moves. Victini can pivot through the use of U-turn and bring in Latios safely. Victini also appreciates Latios's ability to clear away entry hazards for it. Hoopa-U forms a great offensive partnership with Latios by using a mixed set to beat Pokemon that could trouble Latios such as Steel-type Pokemon like Heatran, Doublade, and Ferrothorn. Hoopa-U also deals with Latios's weakness to Ghost-type Pokemon such as Gengar and Choice Scarf Chandelure. Mew sets up Stealth Rock for Latios, allowing it to break through Pokemon more easily. Using Defog on Latios also frees up a moveslot on Mew, letting it run more useful moves. Mew also generally walls and beats most Fairy- and Dragon-type Pokemon that threaten Latios; the likes of Mega Diancie and opposing Latios can't break through it. Jirachi is an alternative Stealth Rock user that is particularly great due to resisting Fairy- and Dragon-type moves, which Latios is weak to. Like Victini, Jirachi can also be used as a Choice Scarf user and pivot through U-turn to bring Latios in safely. Slowbro is a great defensive backbone for Latios, as it can easily switch into U-turn and take Knock Off if it runs Colbur Berry.</p>"

  "Jirachi": {
    "overview": "<h3>Psychic</h3> <p>Jirachi fills a supportive role on Psychic teams as a specially defensive pivot and Stealth Rock setter thanks to its solid bulk, part-Steel typing, and access to U-turn, Serene Grace, and support moves in Toxic, Healing Wish, and Thunder Wave. Jirachi's part-Steel typing makes it immune to Toxic, neutral to Bug, and resistant to Dragon, Rock, and Fairy, allowing it to better take on Heracross, Latias, Mega Aerodactyl, and Gardevoir. However, it also adds weaknesses to Ground and Fire, rendering Jirachi useless in those matchups. Its solid bulk allows Jirachi to survive Choice Specs Hydreigon's Dark Pulse, Choice Specs Kingdra's rain-boosted Hydro Pump, and Volcarona's Fire Blast. However, Jirachi lacks healing moves and is reliant on Leftovers for passive recovery.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Psychic</h4> <p>Jirachi may run 108 Speed EVs to outspeed neutral base 80 Speed foes like Mamoswine and Dragonite and positive base 70 Speed foes like Breloom. Alternatively, it can choose to run no Speed investment for a slower U-turn against Staraptor, Rotom-W, and opposing Jirachi. Colbur Berry allows Jirachi to survive Mega Gyarados's and Mega Sharpedo's Crunch as well as Weavile's Knock Off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Psychic</h4> <p><strong>Toxic-immune Ground-types</strong>: Gliscor's reliable recovery, high Defense, and immunity to Toxic and paralysis allows it to easily switch into Jirachi. Excadrill and Nidoking can also come in on Jirachi without fearing status, although the latter fails to OHKO Jirachi and takes noticeable damage from Iron Head.</p> <p><strong>Steel-resistant Setup Sweepers</strong>: Steel-resistant setup sweepers like Mega Scizor, Bisharp, Gyarados, and Raikou can take advantage of Jirachi's poor offensive capabilities. The latter two Pokemon typically run Substitute, so they don't fear Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Stallbreakers such as Heatran, Mew, and Sableye can shut Jirachi down with Taunt. Compared to the latter two Pokemon, Heatran is a more suitable switch-in since it only fears being crippled by Thunder Wave variants of Jirachi.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Although Jirachi is resistant to Stealth Rock and immune to Toxic, it still gets worn down by burn, Spikes, and contact damage punishers.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Iron Head combined with Serene Grace complements both of Jirachi's status inflicting moves. With U-turn, Jirachi can provide pivot support to its teammates. Toxic cripples opposing walls such as Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Gastrodon. Healing Wish lets Jirachi cure a teammate of its status ailment and bring it back up to full health. Thunder Wave paralyzes faster threats like Kingdra, Latios, Mega Latias, and variants of Volcarona without Lum Berry. Leftovers provides Jirachi with its only means of recovery on this set. 16 Speed EVs allow Jirachi to outpace neutral base 70 Speed foes like Mega Swampert.</p> <p>All of Jirachi's teammates benefit from its ability to set Stealth Rock, act as a specially defensive pivot, and fully heal a teammate with Healing Wish or spread status with Toxic or Thunder Wave. Colbur Berry Slowbro can tank physical attacks directed at Jirachi, deal with Ground-types like Excadrill, and check Mega Sharpedo, Mega Swampert, and Mega Gyarados with Grass Knot. Celebi is an alternative Colbur Berry user that can run a Nasty Plot set since Jirachi is carrying Stealth Rock. Latios and Latias are Ground-immune teammates that can also clear entry hazards. Thanks to its good coverage and high Speed and Special Attack coupled with Choice Specs, Latios can check many slower attackers and threaten Fire- and Ground-types such as Victini, Mega Charizard Y, Landorus, and Garchomp. Mega Latias provides useful defensive utility to Jirachi; it can switch into Mega Charizard Y's Fire Blast and Landorus's Knock Off. Victini forms a pivoting core with Jirachi and takes out most Steel-types and stallbreakers outside of Heatran. With its Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice, bulky Mega Gardevoir decimates Dark teams and acts as a secondary countermeasure to Mega Sharpedo and Mega Gyarados. It can also extend Jirachi's longevity with Wish support and use Will-O-Wisp to cripple physical attackers. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Gardevoir can be used to provide Healing Wish support and check weather users such as Excadrill, Mega Garchomp, and Kingdra. If Gardevoir is running Energy Ball, then it can also check Ground-types like Mega Swampert and Gastrodon. Mega Gallade can set up with Swords Dance and break through Steel- and Normal-types like Heatran and Chansey. It also proves to be useful against opposing Psychic teams with its combination of Knock Off + Shadow Sneak. With Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off, Mew can wear down Steel-, Ground-, and Normal-types such as Heatran, Mega Garchomp, and Diggersby. Deoxys-S's outstanding Speed tier and fantastic coverage enable it to threaten Ground-, Flying-, and Water-types such as Garchomp, Landorus, and Sharpedo.</p>"

    "overview": "<h3>Normal</h3> <p>Staraptor is a staple on Normal-type teams as a physically bulky hazard remover. Staraptor is able to run a bulky set to provide team support with its access to Intimidate and Defog, being the only viable option for removing entry hazards on Normal-type teams. With its Flying typing, Staraptor gains a neutrality against Fighting-type attacks and becomes able to check types such as Bug, Fighting, and Grass, along with being a good switch-in to Ground-type attacks, especially against Choice item users locked into a Ground-type attack such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Diggersby. Unfortunately, Staraptor cannot afford to take multiple hits, especially from special attackers due to its subpar Special Defense. Staraptor is also hindered by Stealth Rock, which reduces its effectiveness as a Defogger.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Normal</h4> <p>Close Combat grants Staraptor Fighting-type coverage against Rock- and Steel-types, such as Tyranitar and Bisharp. Feather Dance can be used to cripple physical attackers and allow Staraptor to recover more easily with Roost. Whirlwind can also be used to keep sweepers, such as Mega Scizor, from setting up on Staraptor and deal passive damage while Stealth Rock is on the field. Toxic can also be used to cripple bulky Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Normal</h4> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Due to Staraptor's weak special bulk, it won't be able to take multiple hits from powerful special attackers such as Volcanion, Landorus, and Mega Diancie.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Physically bulky Pokemon such as Skarmory, Slowbro, and Hippowdon can tank several hits from Staraptor and recover damage with their reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: If not careful, Staraptor can be crippled by Thunder Wave, Toxic, or Will-O-Wisp from Pokemon such as Klefki, Porygon2, and Mew, which hinders its longevity and forces it to waste turns using Roost to keep itself alive.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Staraptor has trouble breaking through the majority of Steel-types, as most of them resist its STAB moves. If defensive Staraptor doesn't carry Close Combat, Bisharp will be very troublesome due to having Defiant.</p> <p><strong>Support Pokemon</strong>: Support Pokemon from opposing teams can be very problematic for Staraptor. Mew is an excellent example, as it has nothing to fear from either the bulky or Choice Scarf set and can cripple Staraptor with Will-O-Wisp while setting up Stealth Rock.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive Defog (Normal)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird is Staraptor's main STAB move, heavily damaging Pokemon that don't resist the attack. Roost gives Staraptor reliable recovery, replenishing its health throughout the match to prolong its longevity and help it continuously switch into physical attackers to wall them. Defog lets Staraptor to act as a reliable entry hazard remover for its team. U-turn allows Staraptor to provide slow pivot support.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>240 HP EVs give Staraptor minimize Stealth Rock damage and maximize Leftovers recovery. 252 Defense EVs with an Impish nature allow Staraptor to take physical attacks much more effectively. The remaining 16 EVs are used in Speed for Staraptor to outspeed neutral-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Bisharp and Breloom. Intimidate provides Staraptor and its team support by softening attacks from physical attackers. Leftovers gives Staraptor passive recovery every turn and works well in conjunction with Roost. Rocky Helmet can be used instead of Leftovers to punish Pokemon attacking Staraptor with a contact move like Mega Lopunny and Mega Gallade.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set fits best on balanced and stall Normal-type teams. Because of Intimidate, Staraptor should mainly be used as a switch-in to physical attackers. Staraptor must be careful of physical attackers switching into it instead because Intimidate will not work then, so it will have difficulty in tanking their attacks. Staraptor should never be used as a switch-in for special attackers because of its low Special Defense. Despite having Defog, try not to have Staraptor continuously switch in on Stealth Rock without using Roost to keep its health high. Make sure you keep Staraptor away from status moves such as poison, paralysis, and burns, as they greatly hinder its longevity. If there's a Pokemon that can't do much do Staraptor such as Choice Scarf Heracross after an Intimidate, it's safe to go for either a Brave Bird, Roost, or Defog to remove any entry hazards from your side of the field. Be wary of switching into Bisharp because it can get a boost from Defiant after an Intimidate. U-turn helps Staraptor escape switch-ins and bring its teammates in safely.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Chansey is an excellent partner for Staraptor, as it can make for a great status absorber due to Natural Cure, switch into special attacks that Staraptor won't be able to handle, and use Stealth Rock, which provides great utility. Porygon2 can wear down defensive Pokemon with Toxic and deal with pestering Flying-types that can easily handle Staraptor such as Zapdos and Skarmory. Foul Play Porygon2 also works nicely as a check against Mega Scizor. Both Chansey and Porygon2 appreciate the removal of entry hazards with Defog.  Mega Lopunny can assist in removing foes that threaten Staraptor with its powerful High Jump Kick such as Dark-, Ice-, Normal-, Rock-, and Steel-types. Staraptor also appreciates a teammate that has an Electric immunity such as Diggersby. Additionally, Diggersby can break through walls with its fearsome Huge Power-boosted attacks. Setup sweepers and special attackers will be very troublesome for Staraptor, so Choice Scarf Ditto can be very helpful in getting rid of these Pokemon due to having Imposter and being able to copy the threat's stat changes. Other special attackers such as Heliolisk and Meloetta are also wonderful options for dealing a lot of damage to the opposing team for Staraptor. Meloetta deserves a special mention because it can defeat Steel-types that Staraptor struggles against with Focus Blast.</p>"

    "overview": "<h3>Ground</h3> <p>Gastrodon acts as a specially defensive wall on Ground teams thanks to its solid defensive typing, decent bulk, reliable recovery, and Storm Drain. Gastrodon's Water immunity prevents fast Water-types like Swift Swim Kingdra in rain from sweeping through Ground teams. Its Ice neutrality allows Gastrodon to switch into Kyurem-B and tank an Icicle Crash from Choice Band Weavile and Choice Band Mamoswine. Gastrodon's high HP and serviceable Special Defense let it tank hits from powerful special attackers like Landorus and Mega Diancie. However, as a result of its terrible Speed and poor Defense, Gastrodon is subject to being taken out by wallbreakers such as Mega Heracross and Dragonite. Gastrodon competes with Seismitoad for a spot, since they can both provide a Water immunity. Seismitoad lacks reliable recovery, but it's faster and has a better offensive movepool to check Belly Drum Azumarill.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Ground</h4> <p>Protect over Earth Power lets Gastrodon scout Choiced users and punish High Jump Kick users like Mega Lopunny and Hawlucha. It can also stall out turns against statused foes and allow Gastrodon to safely heal with Leftovers. However, giving up Earth Power makes Gastrodon much more passive against Skarmory and Zapdos. Acid Armor boosts Gastrodon's poor Defense enough to take on physical attackers like Mega Sharpedo. However, even after attaining Defense boosts, many wallbreakers, phazers, and status users will still force out Gastrodon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Ground</h4> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can easily switch into any of Gastrodon's moves, heal with Soft-Boiled, and wear it down with Toxic and Seismic Toss. Natural Cure ensures Gastrodon cannot permanently cripple Chansey with Toxic or Scald burns.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Powerful physical attackers like Choice Band Diggersby and Mega Heracross can overwhelm Gastrodon's mediocre Defense.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers such as Mega Gyarados, Volcarona, Clefable, and Mega Latias can take advantage of Gastrodon's poor offensive capabilities. However, Mega Gyarados fears Scald burns unless it has Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Stallbreakers like Mew, Crobat, and Sableye have access to Toxic and Taunt, allowing them to wear down Gastrodon.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic poison and burn harm Gastrodon's longevity, drastically limiting its ability to function as a special wall.</p>",

Earth Power targets Steel- and Electric-types like Bisharp and Heliolisk and punishes Flying-types like Skarmory and Zapdos for attempting to recover HP with Roost. Gastrodon prefers Earth Power, since it can take advantage of Special Attack boosts from Storm Drain, but Earthquake can break though Calm Mind-enhanced Substitutes and deal more damage to specially defensive walls like Tentacruel and Empoleon. Toxic cripples opposing walls that aren't bothered as much by Scald burns like Porygon2 and Zapdos.</p> <p>Gastrodon's immunity to Water gives Ground teams a chance against fast Water-types such as Swift Swim Kingdra. Mega Garchomp's access to Stone Edge and Fire Blast allows it to deal with Mega Scizor, Flying-types like Mega Charizard Y and Gyarados, and Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Breloom. Excadrill in sand can take out offensive threats like Choice Specs Latios, Deoxys-S, and Celebi. Hippowdon can switch into physical attackers like Terrakion and Excadrill, phaze setup sweepers such as Mega Scizor and Mega Gallade, and passively damage foes by setting sand and Stealth Rock. Mamoswine revenge kills weakened threats with Ice Shard and checks physical attackers like Mega Garchomp and Dragonite. Landorus uses its powerful special attacks and Knock Off to take care of stallbreakers like Mew and Sableye. Nidoking can check Grass-types such as Breloom and Ferrothorn with Flamethrower.

  "Lopunny": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Lopunny has an excellent base 135 Speed, outpacing the majority of the unboosted metagame. It also has an impressive base 136 Attack, being able to deal a lot of damage to Pokemon that don't resist its STAB moves. Together, the high Attack and Speed stats of Mega Lopunny make it an excellent cleaner. Mega Lopunny's Fighting-type STAB moves allow it to hit Dark-, Ice-, Normal-, Rock-, and Steel-types super effectively. Thanks to its STAB combination, Mega Lopunny can hit every type within the metagame for at least neutral damage. With Scrappy, Mega Lopunny is also able to hit Ghost-types such as Sableye, Gengar, and Doublade. In conjunction with Fake Out, this guarantees that Lopunny can safely Mega Evolve. Mega Lopunny can also switch into a predicted Knock Off from users such as Bisharp and Weavile, which helps item-reliant Pokemon such as Chansey and Porygon2. However, Mega Lopunny's bulk is pretty average for an offensive Pokemon, and its Normal / Fighting typing makes it weak to common types such as Fairy, Fighting, and Psychic. Mega Lopunny is also easily worn down by entry hazards, such as Spikes and Stealth Rock, and status effects, such as burn and poison. Due to its lack of power, Mega Lopunny has trouble breaking through physical walls such as Slowbro, Skarmory, and Hippowdon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Focus Punch lets Mega Lopunny punish Flying-types like Skarmory and Mandibuzz for attempting to recover HP with Roost. Power-Up Punch is a niche option that can increase Mega Lopunny's Attack by one stage while dealing some damage. Substitute can allow Mega Lopunny to avoid any status moves and be used on predicted switches. Substitute can also be used in conjunction with Encore to attack while the opposing Pokemon is locked into an unfavorable move. Encore annoys the opposing Pokemon by having them use the same move for three turns, granting Mega Lopunny the upper hand. Mega Lopunny can either switch out into a more threatening Pokemon against the foe or force the opposing Pokemon to switch out, giving it a free turn to attack. Quick Attack grants Mega Lopunny double priority if used with Fake Out, letting it pick off weakened foes and revenge kill.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Skarmory can easily wall Jolly Mega Lopunny, as High Jump Kick is only a 3HKO. Many defensive variants of Skarmory carry Rocky Helmet, which will damage Mega Lopunny upon contact. Mega Venusaur doesn't take much damage from Ice Punch due to Thick Fat and resists High Jump Kick, and Mega Lopunny rarely 3HKOes Mega Venusaur with Return. Slowbro can easily switch into Mega Lopunny, as it is not bothered by any of its attacks and has Regenerator. Bulky Garchomp is also a common user of Rocky Helmet, and it can damage Mega Lopunny with Rough Skin as well.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Choice Scarf Heracross and Terrakion can OHKO Mega Lopunny with Close Combat. Mega Gallade resists Mega Lopunny's High Jump Kick and can KO it with Close Combat or Drain Punch. Hawlucha isn't KOed by Mega Lopunny's Ice Punch or Return and, once Unburden is activated, can threaten Mega Lopunny the next turn with Acrobatics. However, many of the Pokemon mentioned above cannot switch into Mega Lopunny.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Many Fairy-types can eliminate Mega Lopunny. Klefki can paralyze Mega Lopunny with Thunder Wave, removing its speed control. Azumarill is able to OHKO it with STAB Play Rough. Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Togekiss can revenge kill it with Moonblast and Air Slash, respectively. Sylveon can easily remove Mega Lopunny from the field with Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice. Clefable can cripple Mega Lopunny with Thunder Wave and KO it with Moonblast. However, most of these Pokemon cannot safely switch into Mega Lopunny.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Mega Lopunny doesn't enjoy taking any type of passive damage from opposing teams. Examples include Ferrothorn and Rocky Helmet users like Skarmory and Slowbro. Slowbro can tank Mega Lopunny's STAB Return and paralyze it with Thunder Wave or continue using Slack Off while it takes damage from Rocky Helmet. Both Will-O-Wisp and Toxic can leave Mega Lopunny greatly hindered, limiting its effectiveness and shortening its longevity.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Despite Fake Out outprioritizing other moves, Mega Lopunny is outsped and revenge killed by Choice Scarf users such as Victini, Latias, and Gardevoir. Mega Lopunny is also vulnerable to Mach Punch from Breloom, which OHKOes it most of the time.</p>",

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fake Out allows Lopunny to safely get a Speed boost after Mega Evolving. Lopunny can use that to its advantage when facing faster Pokemon such as Latios, Gengar, and Galvantula. The chip damage from Fake Out in conjunction with High Jump Kick or Return can also help Mega Lopunny secure KOs against Pokemon that otherwise wouldn't be KOed by its powerful STAB attack alone. High Jump Kick is Mega Lopunny's best Fighting-type STAB attack, hitting Dark-, Ice-, and Normal-types such as Bisharp, Mamoswine, and Chansey, while also hitting Rock- and Steel-types, which resist Return, such as Tyranitar and Heatran. With Scrappy, Mega Lopunny can also hit Ghost-types such as Sableye and Doublade. Return is Mega Lopunny's Normal-type STAB move of choice, hitting Pokemon such as Gengar for neutral damage. Ice Punch grants Mega Lopunny coverage against Dragon- and Flying-types such as Garchomp, Dragonite, Gliscor, and Landorus.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack EVs increase Mega Lopunny's damage output. Maximum Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Mega Lopunny to outspeed Adamant Gyarados and Dragonite after one Dragon Dance, along with slower Choice Scarf users such as Magnezone. Limber gives Lopunny immunity to paralysis, allowing it to switch into predicted Thunder Waves before Mega Evolving. Lopunnite is needed to increase Lopunny's Attack, bulk, and Speed. An Adamant nature can be used instead of a Jolly one to increase Mega Lopunny's damage output, allowing it to almost always 2HKO Skarmory after Stealth Rock damage and sometimes OHKO Mega Garchomp with Ice Punch; however, Mega Lopunny will lose out on the extra Speed that would allow it to outspeed Tornadus-T and Weavile.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Lopunny should be used on offensive and balanced teams, as it can apply pressure on opposing teams. Fake Out is an excellent way to get some damage on opposing Pokemon and makes Mega Lopunny a dedicated lead, as it allows Mega Lopunny to break the Focus Sash and Sturdy of Pokemon such as Breloom and Galvantula. Fake Out also allows Lopunny to avoid the risk of having to switch into an attack prior to Mega Evolving. Always use it immediately as Mega Lopunny switches in to get chip damage on the opposing Pokemon. Be wary, however, of Pokemon using Rocky Helmet that can switch into Fake Out such as Skarmory and Slowbro. Using the chip damage from Fake Out, Mega Lopunny can KO Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y with Return and weaken opposing Pokemon to help its teammates later in the match. Furthermore, Fake Out is great for stalling out turns of weather effects, Reflect, and Light Screen, as well as racking up damage with additional turns of poison and burn. Despite High Jump Kick being a very powerful move, Return is much safer to use because High Jump Kick has a chance to miss, and upon doing so, Mega Lopunny loses half of its health. Only use High Jump Attack if you need to get major damage off, if the target is weak to Fighting, or if Mega Lopunny is about to faint. Scout for Protect on Pokemon that can potentially carry it, such as Ferrothorn, as High Jump Kick will damage Mega Lopunny if Protect is used.</p> <p>Lopunny should Mega Evolve immediately because it's dangerous to keep Lopunny in its base forme due to its low Attack stat and mediocre bulk. The only reason to use Lopunny's base forme is to switch into Thunder Wave from the likes of Thundurus and Chansey. Due to its frailty, Mega Lopunny should come in after an ally faints or from a slow U-turn user such as Staraptor. It's recommended to keep Mega Lopunny away from status moves such as Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Will-O-Wisp, as they all hinder it, giving it less time on the field. Mega Lopunny should also avoid taking any unnecessary damage, so use Chansey or Porygon2 to switch into attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Porygon2 is a good partner for Mega Lopunny because it can switch into physical attackers thanks to its physical bulk. In return, Mega Lopunny can take on Steel-types that Porygon2 would struggle against. With access to Foul Play, Porygon2 can check Mega Scizor and Mega Pinsir for Mega Lopunny. Chansey can take special attacks for Mega Lopunny and act as a status absorber with Natural Cure. Chansey also has Stealth Rock, which deals chip damage to the foe upon switching in, making it easier for Mega Lopunny to KO other Pokemon. Both Porygon2 and Chansey can inflict status effects such as paralysis and poison, making Mega Lopunny's job easier as a cleaner. Meloetta can act as a great special wallbreaker, breaking through walls such as Skarmory in case Mega Lopunny can't deal with them. In return, Mega Lopunny can handle Dark-types for Meloetta. Diggersby is a great partner for Mega Lopunny, as both can apply pressure on the opposing team, allowing for Mega Lopunny to clean up afterwards, and Diggersby can also check Skarmory with Fire Punch for Mega Lopunny. Staraptor is great for crippling physical attackers with Intimidate for Mega Lopunny, and it can also check Bug-, Fighting-, and Grass-types such as Heracross, Breloom, and Mega Venusaur. It can also let Mega Lopunny switch in safely with a slow U-turn. Ditto can be very helpful in getting rid of a Pokemon that threatens Mega Lopunny due to having Imposter and being able to copy the threat's stat changes, allowing it to punish setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Mega Pinsir and Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragonite.</p>"

    "overview": "<h3>Ground</h3> <p>Mega Garchomp is a staple on Ground teams as a mixed wallbreaker because of its good typing, solid coverage, and fantastic offensive stats. Thanks to its part-Dragon typing and solid physical bulk, Mega Garchomp survives +6 Azumarill's Aqua Jet and +2 Mega Gyarados's Waterfall. With Stone Edge and Fire Blast, Mega Garchomp threatens Skarmory and fast offensive Flying-types like Gyarados and Mega Charizard Y. Sand Force strengthens Earthquake and Stone Edge, making Mega Garchomp a more potent wallbreaker under sand. Garchomp's Speed tier allows it to outspeed Landorus and base 100 Speed foes such as offensive Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y. However, upon Mega Evolving, it no longer outpaces base 95 Speed foes like Hydreigon. Despite its decent Speed and good bulk, Mega Garchomp is still vulnerable to revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny and Kyurem-B.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Ground</h4> <p>Special Attack investment allows Mega Garchomp to deal more damage to bulkier foes such as Mega Heracross, Rotom-W, and Bronzong. However, maximum Attack investment lets Mega Garchomp more appropriately deal with Gyarados and Azumarill. Using Substitute instead of Stone Edge helps Mega Garchomp avoid status and proves useful when facing Bisharp's Sucker Punch and Sharpedo's Protect, but it makes Mega Garchomp unable to check Flying-types with high Special Defense like Mega Charizard Y and Assault Vest Tornadus-T. Mega Garchomp may opt to use Stealth Rock over Draco Meteor, as its offensive presence helps it keep Stealth Rock up more easily against Flying teams than Hippowdon. Although, without Draco Meteor, Mega Garchomp can't deal significant damage to Latios, Rotom-W, and opposing Garchomp. Swords Dance is a niche option over Draco Meteor that helps Mega Garchomp break through Mega Venusaur and Porygon2; however, Mega Garchomp's middling Speed tier makes it a lackluster setup sweeper.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Ground</h4> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Porygon2 easily tanks Mega Garchomp's attacks and threatens to OHKO it with Ice Beam. Gliscor can freely switch into Mega Garchomp and wear it down with Toxic and Earthquake. While Slowbro can answer Mega Garchomp outside of sand, its inability to survive Sand Force-boosted Earthquake + Draco Meteor makes it an unreliable check in sand.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Thundurus can threaten to KO after Stealth Rock with Hidden Power Ice. Mega Garchomp also has to watch out for faster threats that sometimes carry Hidden Power Ice, like Cobalion and Landorus.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burn inhibits Mega Garchomp's ability to operate as a mixed wallbreaker. It lacks recovery, so Toxic will put Mega Garchomp on a timer and allow walls like Chansey and Hippowdon to outlast it.</p>",

Stone Edge hits Flying-types like Mega Charizard Y, Gyarados, Tornadus-T, and Zapdos. Fire Blast targets Ground-immune Steel-types such as Skarmory and Bronzong, Bug-types like Heracross and Mega Scizor, and Grass-types such as Breloom and Celebi.

It can also use Eject Button to safely bring in Mega Garchomp while maximizing the number of sand turns it can use. Excadrill in sand checks most of Mega Garchomp's offensive answers, including Latios, Mega Diancie, Weavile, and Deoxys-S.

  "Lucario": {
    "overview": "<h3>Fighting</h3> <p>With a great offensive typing that provides Steel-type STAB, Lucario is one of Fighting's best offensive checks to Fairy-types. It has decent Attack and Special Attack stats and access to both Swords Dance and Nasty Plot, making its set quite unpredictable. Further, thanks again to its Steel typing, Lucario is able to take neutral damage from Flying-type moves. This combined with its Inner Focus ability allows Lucario to survive and avoid flinches from Togekiss's Air Slash, making it a great check to Choice Scarf Togekiss. Lucario is also blessed with Extreme Speed, which has +2 priority, allowing Lucario to beat most priority users. Lucario is also one of the few special attackers on Fighting and can serve as a check to common problems such as Doublade and Jellicent. Unfortunately, Lucario is lacking in Speed and will suffer from severe four-moveslot syndrome regardless of whether it chooses to run a physical or special set. The physical set also is forced to use the inaccurate Iron Tail to check Fairy-types and if it doesn't run Crunch as coverage will find itself walled by physically defensive Pokemon that resist its STAB moves such as Jellicent and Doublade. The special set is forced to use relatively low-Base Power attacks, and Vacuum Wave is quite weak in particular, making Lucario more easily revenge killed and reliant on setting up.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Fighting</h4> <p>The Swords Dance set can use Ice Punch over Iron Tail or Crunch to hit Dragonite, but it is generally a far inferior coverage option and not worth running. A Jolly nature can be considered for the Swords Dance set, but without the boost in damage from Adamant, Lucario lacks the power to easily break Clefable and many other physical walls, and thanks to Extreme Speed, physical Lucario rarely needs the extra Speed. The Nasty Plot set can use Psychic to catch Mega Venusaur off guard, as a +2 Lucario will always OHKO it, or it can try using Hidden Power Ice to hit Dragonite, which can be OHKOed after Multiscale is broken, but losing one of its standard moves is a huge blow to its sweeping abilities. Steadfast can be used on a special set with a Timid nature to outspeed Choice Scarf Togekiss after one flinch, but it is incredibly unreliable and does not assist Lucario against Choice Scarf Jirachi, which Lucario needs boosts to KO with Dark Pulse. The Nasty Plot set can also potentially use Choice Specs and replace Nasty Plot with an additional coverage move. This will give it enough damage to always OHKO Togekiss and almost always OHKO physically defensive Clefable with Flash Cannon, but the loss of sweeping potential is a huge blow. While it is tempting to use Focus Sash to help Lucario set up either Swords Dance or Nasty Plot, neither set can afford the severe drop in power that losing Life Orb results in, making it a generally very poor item to use.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Fighting</h4> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Depending on the set, Lucario is frustrated by the corresponding walls, such as Doublade for physical sets and specially defensive Gastrodon for special sets. Pokemon that cannot directly damage Lucario should be careful of being set up on, however.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Lucario is very slow, making it an easy target for revenge killers when it lacks boosts for its priority. Faster Pokemon such as Victini, Landorus-T, and Mega Pinsir while healthy or those that resist Extreme Speed such as Mega Diancie and Terrakion can take even a +2 Extreme Speed and OHKO Lucario.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos can generally beat most special Lucario, since it resists Lucario's STAB moves and Dark Pulse does very little, with even Discharge if it lacks Heat Wave. However, Zapdos cannot safely switch into physical sets, as Close Combat after a Swords Dance will 2HKO.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Most Ground-type Pokemon are naturally bulky, such as Garchomp and Landorus, and those that are faster than Lucario can switch into one unboosted hit to OHKO Lucario back with super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Although sometimes unable to switch into physical Lucario, Flying-type Pokemon such as Thundurus and Mega Charizard Y can generally check unboosted Lucario with their powerful STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fire- and Fighting-types</strong>: Although they must be wary of boosted Extreme Speed and cannot switch into even resisted attacks, faster Fire- or Fighting-type Pokemon can easily revenge kill Lucario with their STAB attacks.</p>",

      "Swords Dance (Fighting)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance is used to boost Lucario's Attack to make it both a strong wallbreaker and a sweeper. Close Combat is Lucario's most powerful and accurate STAB attack to wallbreak with. In spite of its low accuracy, Iron Tail is used to hit Fairy-types super effectively and also gives Lucario an option to hit Ghost-types such as Sableye. Extreme Speed is powerful priority that covers up Lucario's low Speed and can protect Lucario from +1-priority moves such as Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave. Bullet Punch is an option to be used over Extreme Speed to hit Pokemon that resist Normal such as Mega Diancie and Terrakion, but it makes Lucario weaker in most matchups. Crunch can be used to beat Slowbro, but one of Lucario's main niches is to beat Fairy-types, which now wall its set, so it is rarely worth using without significant team support, and the special set uses Dark-type coverage better.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack EV investment, an Adamant nature, and Life Orb make Lucario as powerful as possible, giving it the best chance to OHKO Clefable and the potential to OHKO Skarmory at +2 and after Stealth Rock. Life Orb also helps Lucario deal meaningful damage without boosting, notably helping it revenge kill targets such as weakened Hawlucha and Gardevoir with Extreme Speed. With maximum Speed investment, Lucario is faster than Timid Heatran and can also outspeed Adamant Dragonite in order to use Extreme Speed first. Inner Focus is used to avoid flinches from Togekiss, which is OHKOed by +2 Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock damage, and Jirachi, which cannot even 2HKO Lucario with Heart Stamp, so that they can both be set up on. Steadfast might be tempting to sweep with a Speed boost, but it is simply not reliable in most cases, as Choice Scarf Jirachi requires two Steadfast activations to be outsped and Togekiss cannot be set up on without Inner Focus. While the Attack boost from Justified might benefit Lucario, Dark attacks are almost never used against Fighting teams, making it almost impossible to use.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lucario should be preserved until late-game, as Life Orb recoil and entry hazard damage will slowly chip away its health. That being said, do not hesitate to use Extreme Speed to revenge kill weakened foes such as Thundurus and Victini safely. As Lucario's bulk is quite poor, it should avoid being switched into any attack that isn't resisted. It will primarily set up Swords Dance against passive Pokemon like Forretress or Ferrothorn that cannot threaten Lucario. While bulky Water-types can be set up on and KOed with Close Combat, Scald can potentially cause a burn, ending Lucario's sweep, so they must be played around with caution. In general, burns and paralysis should be avoided, as they both spell the end of Lucario's sweep by halving its Attack or quartering its Speed. Because Lucario can at worst 2HKO most walls including even Mega Venusaur and Mandibuzz after a Swords Dance, setting up as the opponent sends out a defensive switch-in can allow Lucario to break its checks. Inner Focus should be taken advantage of to allow Lucario to set up Swords Dance against Choice Scarf Jirachi safely. Weakened Choice Scarf Togekiss can be used to set up a Swords Dance, as Extreme Speed will be able to take out Togekiss after one boost and Stealth Rock damage, although Iron Tail will always OHKO Togekiss even if no prior damage was dealt. If Lucario is running Crunch, it should not reveal it before the primary target, namely Slowbro, Doublade, or Jellicent, is switched in expecting a different coverage move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A second Swords Dance sweeper such as Hawlucha or Mega Gallade can work with Lucario to put huge pressure on shared checks. Stealth Rock support is necessary for getting many KOs, such as against Skarmory and Flying-type Pokemon in general. In addition to providing Stealth Rock, Cobalion is also useful for its Volt Switch and Thunder Wave support, both of which make Lucario's job much easier by giving it safe switches and easing the burden of its low Speed, respectively. Infernape, on the other hand, is a more offensive Stealth Rock user capable of checking Doublade, Mega Scizor, and Skarmory that can also run Grass Knot to heavily damage Slowbro and Gastrodon. Breloom is a great partner thanks to its Grass-type STAB moves making it easy to handle certain walls such as Slowbro and Jellicent, both of which Lucario has trouble with when it lacks Crunch. Breloom's Technician Mach Punch can be used to revenge kill Excadrill and in conjunction with Lucario's Extreme Speed can take out weakened threats such as Unburden Hawlucha and Swift Swim Kingdra. Finally, Breloom's unique access to Spore gives Lucario free turns and switches, helping it find chances to set up in spite of its lack of bulk.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot (Fighting)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot is used to boost Lucario's Special Attack, making it a formidable sweeper. Flash Cannon is Lucario's most powerful special Steel-type STAB attack, capable of KOing Fairy-types. Dark Pulse is useful for hitting the Psychic- and Ghost-types that naturally threaten Fighting teams. Aura Sphere is the most reliable Fighting-type attack and deals great damage to anything that doesn't resist Fighting. Vacuum Wave is an alternative to Aura Sphere, giving Lucario priority to patch up its Speed. Focus Blast is a final option with huge power, capable of OHKOing Skarmory after breaking Sturdy and potentially OHKOing Klefki that don't predict the Lucario set correctly and use Reflect instead of Light Screen, but lacks accuracy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack EV investment, a Modest nature, and Life Orb make Lucario as powerful as possible, giving it the best chance to OHKO physically defensive Clefable and allowing +2 Lucario to OHKO Mew after Stealth Rock damage. In addition to being needed for certain KOs, Life Orb is necessary to give Lucario enough damage output to sweep, as its moves are quite lacking in Base Power. Maximum Speed EV investment makes Lucario faster than Timid Heatran and Excadrill out of sand. A Timid nature can also be used to outspeed certain threats such as Adamant Entei, Jolly Mamoswine, and Timid Chandelure without losing too much power. Inner Focus is used to avoid flinches from Togekiss and Jirachi so that Lucario can KO them in return with the appropriate move.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lucario should be saved for late-game so that it can sweep after its checks have been removed. Variants that lack Vacuum Wave should generally avoid being sent out early, as Life Orb recoil and entry hazard damage can slowly chip away at its health, putting it in more danger of being revenge killed. Nasty Plot is almost necessary to deal meaningful damage, so Lucario should be brought in safely against passive Pokemon to set up while generally not attacking before getting a boost. Due to its poor bulk, Lucario shouldn't be switched into even most resisted attacks, as any amount of damage can hurt Lucario's sweeping potential. Variants with Vacuum Wave can attempt to use it to revenge kill for their team, but generally setting up Nasty Plot on a retreating foe is more beneficial, as Vacuum Wave does very little damage. Lucario can bait defensive switch-ins that expect a physical set such as Skarmory, Doublade, and Slowbro and surprise them with the appropriate coverage. Lucario must avoid paralysis at all costs, as it cannot afford to be any slower than it already is.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock support is necessary to chip away at foes to put them in range of Lucario's attacks. Cobalion can set up Stealth Rock, and its Volt Switch and Thunder Wave support is incredibly important for Lucario, which has a hard time switching in. Infernape can also set up Stealth Rock for Lucario, and with its Fire-type STAB moves it can handle Mega Scizor. Mega Gallade and Lucario pair up nicely, as they can set up easily on each other's checks, making it more likely that one of them can sweep late-game. Breloom can help Lucario find setup opportunities with its Spore support while providing more powerful priority in the form of Technician-boosted Mach Punch.</p>"

  "Hippowdon": {
    "overview": "<p>Hippowdon features as one of the best Ground-type walls, with great 108 / 118 / 72 defenses and reliable recovery in Slack Off. Hippowdon's unique access to Sand Stream makes it a mandatory member of any sand team, as it is necessary to reliably activate Excadrill's Sand Rush. Furthermore, Sand Stream is a big help against opposing teams that take advantage of other weather such as rain, which are naturally difficult to defeat. With its great bulk, Hippowdon can often supply great utility for the team as a Stealth Rock user and a phazer with Whirlwind. Unfortunately, it is easily worn down by special attackers and cannot actually beat the other weather setters in Mega Charizard Y and Politoed. Taunt also makes it almost useless, as its Earthquake is not particularly powerful and cannot even hit some Taunt users such as Gyarados. Its incredibly low Speed, even for a wall, can make setting Stealth Rock very difficult in the face of offensive or Taunt-using leads such as Breloom and Mew. Due to its usual lack of status moves, it can be easily beaten by most other defensive Pokemon that do carry Toxic, such as Chansey and Zapdos.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stone Edge allows Hippowdon to take out Flying-type threats such as Mega Pinsir and Mega Charizard Y while also hitting Zapdos and Volcarona. Rock Slide is a weaker, but more accurate, alternative for hitting specifically Mega Charizard Y. Hippowdon can run an alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 140 Def / 116 SpD to always avoid the OHKO from Mega Charizard Y's Fire Blast or Solar Beam in the sun, allowing Hippowdon to reliably hit back with Stone Edge. As the primary physical wall of the team, Hippowdon generally uses the standard spread better, though. Instead of Whirlwind, Toxic can help Hippowdon chip away at opposing walls while also threatening some setup sweepers, but it also leaves Hippowdon vulnerable to Substitute users such as Mega Gyarados.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Hippowdon is incapable of doing much to Water-types that can easily break it such as Kingdra, and Manaphy.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt from stallbreakers such as Mew and Sableye will shut down Hippowdon and force it out. Offensively, Mega Gyarados is an especially threatening user of Taunt, as it prevents Hippowdon from being able to phaze it and can freely set up due to Hippowdon's lack of substantial damage output. Some leads such as Custap Berry Skarmory and Aerodactyl can prevent Hippowdon from setting up its own entry hazards with their use of Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather Setters</strong>: Politoed and Mega Charizard Y are both huge threats to Hippowdon. When Charizard Mega Evolves, it overrides the sand with its sun, allowing it to use Solar Beam to deal massive damage. Politoed can also switch into Hippowdon to activate its Eject Button on an Earthquake to bounce to a Swift Swim user, which will force Hippowdon out.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Hippowdon is vulnerable to Grass-type attackers, including Breloom and Serperior, that can not only switch into it but can deal significant damage to it as well. Defensive Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn take very little damage from Hippowdon and can easily take advantage of it or force it out.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: As a wall, Hippowdon needs to keep its health high, which burns and Toxic poison prevent. Specifically, burns will make Hippowdon even weaker than it already is, and Toxic poison will prevent Hippowdon from walling almost anything reliably in the long run.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is necessary on every team, and Hippowdon is one of the best users on Ground teams due to its amazing defenses. Earthquake is Hippowdon's strongest attack and deals respectable damage off its base 112 Attack, preventing Hippowdon from being complete Taunt fodder. Slack Off is used for improving Hippowdon's longevity, allowing it to serve as a wall throughout a battle. Whirlwind serves to phaze sweepers that might try to set up on Hippowdon and can allow it to shuffle the opposing team into the Stealth Rock it sets.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum EV investment in HP and Defense and an Impish nature make Hippowdon as physically defensive as possible, allowing it to switch into physical attackers with great ease. The Sand Stream ability is used to activate Excadrill's Sand Rush while also giving Ground teams a way of trying to combat other weather. Leftovers is the preferred item to give Hippowdon extra recovery alongside Slack Off. Offensively, Eject Button is another good option to allow Hippowdon to jump straight to a teammate such as Mega Garchomp or Excadrill after setting sand, but it can only be used once and can even sometimes be detrimental. Rocky Helmet is a defensive item that deals chip damage to contact attackers, but it and Eject Button are generally not as useful as the passive recovery that Leftovers provides.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hippowdon should try to set up and keep Stealth Rock on the opposing side of the field to support the team with its damage. Hippowdon's use of Sand Stream and Stealth Rock puts a lot of pressure on Pokemon that use Focus Sash, and it should try to take advantage of this fact, as the likes of Breloom and suicide leads such as Deoxys-S can be difficult to play around otherwise. Throughout the match, Hippowdon should pivot in and out to set sand for Excadrill as often as possible. It's especially good at pivoting into physical attackers and forcing them out, allowing it to have free turns to set Stealth Rock or double switch into Excadrill or another teammate safely. On the other hand, Hippowdon should generally avoid special attackers, as it has a hard time taking their hits. Specifically, try to avoid ending up facing against opposing weather setters, as both Mega Charizard Y and Politoed beat it heads up. Instead, double switch to an appropriate answer to force them out and allow Hippowdon to reset sand later. If using Eject Button, try to bring Hippowdon in on an attack, as both it and the turn can be wasted if it's is hit while already in play. Slack Off should be used liberally, as keeping Hippowdon's health high is important for allowing it to switch in often to set sand. Because of how important its health is for walling and safely using its utility, Hippowdon hates taking burns and Toxic poison and should avoid them at all costs. Hippowdon should try to switch into setup sweepers as they are attempting to boost in order to phaze them, as, while it does have good bulk, it cannot take many boosted attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hippowdon provides mandatory support to Excadrill, as its Sand Rush ability requires sand to be active. While Hippowdon doesn't particularly need Excadrill's support, Excadrill can easily break through the walls that it cannot touch and can Rapid Spin away entry hazards that make it harder for Hippowdon to wall foes. Gastrodon is a fantastic teammate due to its Storm Drain ability, making it capable of switching into Water-type attacks that threaten Hippowdon. Specially defensive Gastrodon is also a great teammate for soaking up the special attacks that Hippowdon cannot take. Seismitoad is an alternative Water-immune teammate with a more offensive focus, capable of using a Choice Specs-boosted Sludge Wave to take out many of the Grass-types that threaten Hippowdon, but it lacks recovery options and is easily worn down. As an offensive option, Mamoswine can help take out Grass-type Pokemon, although it cannot switch into them, and also greatly appreciates the Stealth Rock support that Hippowdon provides, allowing it to net KOs on targets such as Breloom with Ice Shard after minimal chip damage. Mega Garchomp's Sand Force allows it to also take advantage of the sand that Hippowdon sets; notably, it puts Chansey into 2HKO range of Earthquake. Landorus is another powerful wallbreaker that is a great teammate for Hippowdon because its damage with Earth Power allows it to break through slow and bulky Water teams that Hippowdon is fearful of, and its access to Sludge Wave makes it a very good check to many Grass-types. It can also use Gravity, which can allow it to take out airborne Pokemon such as Skarmory and Zapdos that try to Defog away Hippowdon's Stealth Rock.</p>"

Pursuit allows Drapion to trap and revenge kill Psychic- and Ghost-types like Victini and Gengar, while quirky coverage moves in Rock Slide and Ice Fang allow Drapion to revenge kill faster threats to Poison teams like Volcarona and Landorus. Unfortunately, faster Choice Scarf users like Darmanitan and Terrakion can KO Drapion.

Toxic can be used to cripple defensive Pokemon like Mandibuzz and Porygon2 on the switch. A Jolly nature is usable to outspeed Mega Aerodactyl and certain Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T and Excadrill. However, using a Jolly nature makes it even harder for Drapion to pick up KOs on the likes of Mega Garchomp and Mega Gallade. Poison Jab is an option to let Drapion do more damage to Dark-resistant Pokemon like Whimsicott and Weavile, but Drapion's teammates can usually handle such Pokemon well.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Poison</h4> <p><strong>Dark-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Fighting-, Dark-, and Fairy-types like Terrakion, Mega Tyranitar, and Mega Diancie easily wall Drapion's attacks and retaliate in their own way.

Additionally, it provides Stealth Rock and an Electric immunity. Gengar forms a Psychic-breaking core alongside Drapion. It can take out threats like Slowbro, Hydreigon, and Diggersby and notably use Substitute on Chansey to decimate Normal teams.

Its Speed tier lets Weavile outpace Hawlucha and base 110 Speed foes such as Mega Gallade, Mega Diancie, and Latios. Weavile's STAB Ice-type coverage allows it to check Dragon-, Flying-, and Ground-types such as Garchomp, Hawlucha, and Landorus. However, Weavile is difficult to bring in due to its very poor defensive typing, weakness to Stealth Rock, and mediocre bulk. It is also susceptible to being revenge killed by Scizor and faster threats like Mega Lopunny and Choice Scarf Gardevoir.</p> <h3>Ice</h3> <p>Being one of the few fast Pokemon that Ice teams have access to, Weavile easily establishes its position in the Monotype metagame. Its fantastic Speed stat and access to Pursuit let it outspeed and KO or trap common threats to Ice-type teams such as Landorus, Latios, and Starmie, while its great Attack combined with an amazing offensive typing and good STAB moves in Knock Off, Icicle Crash, and a priority move in Ice Shard make Weavile a threat to any team. It also packs a wide movepool with access to coverage moves like Low Kick and Poison Jab as well as a setup move in Swords Dance, which makes it a deadly sweeper. However, due to its horrid bulk, it faints to most strong attacks and often cannot utilize Swords Dance. Furthermore, its poor defensive typing brings a weakness to Stealth Rock and common priority moves like Bullet Punch and Mach Punch. It is also shut down by common status effects like burns.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Dark</h4> <p>There are no viable other options on Weavile.</p> <h4>Ice</h4> <p>Poison Jab can be used over Low Kick to threaten Fairy-type Pokemon like Azumarill and Clefable. However, it otherwise does minimal damage, and Icicle Crash is still better against Pokemon like Mega Diancie and Togekiss. Swords Dance can be used with Focus Sash to turn Weavile into a sweeper. Using Focus Sash lets Weavile utilize Pickpocket; however, as Weavile has horrible bulk, it rarely finds an opportunity to set up. A Choice Band set can be run to increase Weavile's Attack even more and have a guaranteed OHKO on Heatran after Stealth Rock, but it locks Weavile into one move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Dark</h4> <p><strong>Mega Scizor</strong>: Mega Scizor's great defensive typing, good bulk, and access to Roost allow it to switch into Weavile and OHKO it with Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gyarados</strong>: Mega Gyarados's decent bulk, access to Intimidate before it Mega Evolves, and its Ice and Dark resistances allow it to use Weavile as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Ice-resistant Fighting-types</strong>: Cobalion can switch into Weavile, cripple it with Thunder Wave, and then 2HKO it with Iron Head.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Skarmory can switch into Weavile and threaten with Iron Head, although it fears Icicle Crash flinches.

Icicle Crash is Weavile's secondary STAB move; it has a decent flinch chance and lets it threaten Dragon- and Flying-type Pokemon like Dragonite, Zapdos, Hydreigon, and Landorus while also hitting Fighting-types and Mega Evolutions such as Mega Gallade. Ice Shard is a good priority move that lets Weavile revenge kill weakened Pokemon and deal massive damage to Choice Scarf users such as Garchomp and Landorus-T. Low Kick allows Weavile to beat Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon like Heatran and Tyranitar. Pursuit can be used to hit retreating foes like Gengar, Victini, or and Chandelure, all of which are threats to Ice teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature lets Weavile outspeed threats like Latios, Mega Diancie, and Mega Gallade, while maximum Attack investment lets Weavile hit as hard as it can without a boosting nature. Life Orb is used to increase Weavile's damage output even more at the cost of losing a bit of HP at the end of every successful attack. Pressure is used over Pickpocket, as Weavile would have to first lose its own item to effectively make use of it. On the other hand, Pressure can drain Stone Edge and Close Combat PP, both of which are problems for Ice-type teams.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As Weavile has poor bulk, it should be sent out when a teammate faints or against weakened foes to revenge kill them with Ice Shard. Weavile functions as great late-game cleaner due to its excellent Speed and Attack. Most defensive Pokemon hate losing their item, so Weavile can easily capitalize on that and weaken them. It should not be sent in when Stealth Rock is on the field, as it will get worn very easily when combined with Life Orb damage. Weavile should be wary of any type of status effect, as they heavily reduce its offensive presence. Weavile can be worn down easily, making it very vulnerable to priority moves like Infernape's Mach Punch and Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mamoswine is a fantastic partner for Weavile, as it can set up Stealth Rock and pressure Fire- and Steel-type Pokemon like Heatran. On the other hand, Weavile can make up for Mamoswine's average Speed and take out faster threats like Latios. Piloswine can be used as a bulkier version of Mamoswine to pivot into attacks more easily. Running Piloswine also allows Mamoswine to use a more offensive set. Avalugg gets rid of entry hazards for Weavile while acting as a defensive backbone for it. Aurorus can spread paralysis through Thunder Wave and act as an alternative Stealth Rock user. Froslass provides a Fighting-type immunity and can set up Spikes to help Weavile break through certain Pokemon more easily. Kyurem-B is a great wallbreaker and can easily weaken most Pokemon so that Weavile can clean up later. It can also threaten Fairy- and Water-type Pokemon for Weavile through Iron Head and Fusion Bolt. Lapras greatly helps Weavile deal with Water-type Pokemon, as its access to Freeze-Dry lets it easily break the Water-types that Weavile has a hard time against, such as Mega Swampert, Gyarados, Azumarill, and Quagsire. Walrein threatens Fire-type Pokemon like Victini, Torkoal, and Darmanitan, all of which are annoying for Weavile. It also beats Scizor with a Choice Specs-boosted Hidden Power Fire, which is especially helpful. Cloyster appreciates Weavile's ability to weaken Pokemon and remove their items, as it runs a setup sweeper set. Rotom-F can pivot with Volt Switch and safely bring in Weavile. It also beats and cripples bulky Water-type Pokemon like Gyarados and Azumarill through Thunderbolt and Will-O-Wisp, respectively. Both Mega Glalie and Abomasnow are good partners, as they help Weavile against Water-type Pokemon through Freeze-Dry and Giga Drain, respectively.</p>"

  "Rhyperior": {
    "overview": "<h3>Rock</h3> <p>Since Rock-types struggle to cover their shared weaknesses, Rhyperior is amazing on Rock teams because it serves as a blanket check for the many physical attackers that could otherwise plow through the team, like Mega Scizor, Mega Medicham, and Excadrill. Rhyperior's Ground typing provides it with a useful Ground STAB that complements its Rock STAB by hitting Steel-types and many other Pokemon for at least neutral coverage. Because of the good coverage that Rhyperior possesses with its STAB combination, it has some flexibility with its other moveslots. On paper, Rhyperior's Rock / Ground typing and low Speed would severely hinder it from a defensive standpoint, but Solid Rock allows it to overcome this somewhat and even check Mega Medicham, one of Rock Monotype's greatest threats. Even with Solid Rock, however, Rhyperior still crumbles against Water- and Grass-types. Although Rhyperior has amazing physical bulk, special attackers can easily take advantage of its much lower Special Defense. Rhyperior struggles to consistently check physical attackers throughout a match because of its lack of reliable recovery. Because Rock teams need Rhyperior to check a wide range of physical attackers, Rhyperior is often under a lot of pressure and needs to be used very carefully. Rock teams often cannot fit reliable hazard control on teams, and Rhyperior is vulnerable to all types of entry hazards; its lack of recovery makes this even worse. Despite these flaws, Rhyperior still possesses a crucial niche which allows it to act as a defensive glue for most Rock teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Rock</h4> <p>There are a few possible minor set changes that could be made. Avalanche could be used instead of Ice Punch for its greater power. However, Avalanche is not consistent and requires the target to hit Rhyperior, making it less effective if the foe decides to switch out or to use status moves. Another change would be Rock Blast instead of Stone Edge because of its greater accuracy, but it is usually considerably weaker than Stone Edge. It is only more useful against a few targets like Mega Pinsir and the occasional Substitute user. As for more drastic set changes, an offensive Rock Polish set could be used to allow Rhyperior to make use of its great offensive STAB moves and Attack stat. Rhyperior could also utilize an offensive Choice Band set, but it still suffers from slower Speed. This set does lure in certain physical walls especially well, though, as it 2HKOes Alomomola, Mega Venusaur, and Slowbro. However, Rhyperior isn't fast enough to pull either set as effectively as one would hope. These sets also forfeit much of Rhyperior's bulk, and finding another answer for the myriad of physical attackers that Rhyperior keeps in check is difficult. If used, these sets would be best utilized on an offensive Sticky Web team, as that helps remedy some of the their problems.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Rock</h4> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Most Water-types, like Slowbro, Alomomola, and Mega Gyarados, can either 2HKO or OHKO Rhyperior with ease even with Solid Rock. Rhyperior fails to do much back if it hasn't activated its Weakness Policy.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Similarly to Water-types, Grass-types like Breloom, Serperior, and Mega Venusaur generally aren't bothered by Solid Rock and can usually 2HKO or OHKO Rhyperior regardless.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Rhyperior's poor Special Defense makes it an easy target for most special attackers, such as Sylveon, Magnezone, and Hydreigon, which simply KO or cripple Rhyperior.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Ground-types</strong>: Gliscor, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon threaten Rhyperior with their STAB attacks or Toxic, and Rhyperior can't do enough back even if it carries Ice Punch.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>:  Clefable, Skarmory, and other physical walls can take advantage of Rhyperior and possibly set up entry hazards since they avoid the 2HKO from any of its moves and can heal off any damage they take. Skarmory does need to be careful when using Roost, though, as Earthquake will 2HKO.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Residual damage limits Rhyperior's capacity to handle physical sweepers. Because Rhyperior lacks reliable recovery, burns, poison, and entry hazard damage can easily stack up.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Tank (Rock)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is a reliable STAB attack that notably hits Steel-types for great damage. Stone Edge is another STAB attack, and it complements Earthquake by hitting Flying-types and most Pokemon that resist Ground. Fire Punch helps Rhyperior check Steel-types that are neutral to Earthquake, most notably Mega Scizor, which is one of the biggest threats for Rock Monotypes. Counter allows Rhyperior to surprise and KO a wide range of physical attackers, like Mega Medicham, Mega Gallade, and Garchomp. Ice Punch nails Ground-types that most other Rock-types struggle against, like Gliscor, Garchomp, and Zygarde.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread capitalizes on Rhyperior's impressive physical bulk by maxing it out, allowing it to check physical attackers more effectively. The 8 Speed EVs allow Rhyperior to outspeed and hit Politoed after Sticky Web, which forces Politoed out with its own Eject Button and allows Rhyperior to avoid Politoed's Scald. Leftovers helps improve Rhyperior's longevity and is its sole source of recovery. If Leftovers is used, Counter should be used alongside it; this way, Rhyperior still has a way to KO Mega Medicham after taking a hit. However, since Counter is largely prediction-based and thus harder to use in some situations, Weakness Policy + Ice Punch is an alternative over Leftovers + Counter. Initially, Weakness Policy does seem strange on a set that is primarily defensive, but it is necessary to guarantee important KOs after taking a hit from certain Pokemon, like the aforementioned Mega Medicham as well as Mega Scizor. For example, Rhyperior cannot utilize an EV spread that allows it to take a High Jump Kick from Mega Medicham and also OHKO. By using a Weakness Policy, it can use an EV spread that allows it to take a hit while still securing an OHKO. This option also provides Rhyperior with Ice coverage, allowing it to handle Ground-types more easily. Solid Rock mitigates many of Rhyperior's weaknesses and works especially well alongside Weakness Policy.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>From Team Preview, it is important to determine Rhyperior's value in the match. If the opponent has a threatening sweeper such as Mega Scizor or Mega Medicham, keep Rhyperior healthy until it is needed to check it. It should only switch into attackers directly in dire situations; repeated chip damage hinders Rhyperior's effectiveness late-game. Rhyperior utilizes well-planned double switches and free switches well. If Rhyperior has limited use in a matchup, it can switch in more freely and does not need to carefully preserve its health. In this case, it could function more as a defensive pivot. Counter should be used carefully, since preserving its element of surprise can pay off in a few situations. Making smart predictions and knowing when to opt for a different move can pay off in the end. If using Weakness Policy, remember that it only activates once, so make sure that you preserve Rhyperior's health and Weakness Policy until it is needed to check more dangerous sweepers. Certain weaker physical attackers, like specially defensive Gliscor and Hippowdon, should be left for Rhyperior's teammates to handle, like Omastar and Cradily. Prevent Rhyperior from having to take special attacks, as it still has very poor Special Defense. Rhyperior also hates burns and Toxic poison, as they continually chip away at Rhyperior's health. Burns are particularly crippling, since they prevent Weakness Policy Rhyperior from beating what it is supposed to. The Counter set does have more leeway with this, but a burned Rhyperior is very easy to work around.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rhyperior tends to fit easily on most Rock Monotypes because most Rock teams struggle to break through Steel-types and need several countermeasures to physical attackers in general. Because Rhyperior checks several physical attackers in one slot, it affords its teammates the ability to focus on other tasks. This is the case for Mega Aggron; by using it alongside Rhyperior, it can more freely use a RestTalk Curse set, since it doesn't need to run coverage to hit Steel-types. In return, Mega Aggron checks Grass-types for Rhyperior like Breloom and Mega Venusaur. The other Mega Evolutions, like Mega Diancie and Mega Aerodactyl, also appreciate Rhyperior's presence. If you use Mega Diancie or Mega Aerodactyl over Mega Aggron, the team will likely be weaker to a wide range of physical attackers. Mega Diancie desperately needs a teammate to check Mega Medicham and Mega Scizor, and Rhyperior allows you to check these threats without using Mega Aggron. In a sense, Rhyperior helps free up the Mega slot because it essentially fills the same role as Mega Aggron, although admittedly not as effectively. Choice Band Terrakion is another great partner for Rhyperior; Rhyperior struggles against physical walls, like Clefable, Empoleon, and Porygon2, and Terrakion can break most of them for Rhyperior. It can also revenge kill faster threats that Rhyperior struggles with, like Life Orb Kyurem-B. Omastar is yet another offensive Pokemon that pairs nicely with Rhyperior because it can break through most physical walls, act as an amazing wincon against Ground Monotypes, and appreciate Rhyperior's ability to take on Electric-types and most priority users. Cradily is perhaps one of the most useful defensive partners for Rhyperior. Because of Storm Drain and its Grass typing, it can check most Water- and Grass-types that Rhyperior struggles against. In particular, Cradily can soft check Mega Gyarados, which can use Mold Breaker with Waterfall to simply ignore Rhyperior's Solid Rock or even set up. It also has a good matchup with Ground-types like Garchomp, Hippowdon, and Landorus-T, which allows Rhyperior to focus on checking other threats. Cradily appreciates having Rhyperior around to beat Steel-types, like Jirachi and Scizor. Tyranitar also forms a great defensive core with Rhyperior. With Sand Stream and an Assault Vest, Tyranitar acts like the special parallel of Rhyperior and serves as a great blanket check for several special attackers. If absolutely needed, Rhyperior can also utilize Tyranitar's sand itself and take considerably powerful attacks, such as Landorus's Earth Power.</p>"

  "Togekiss": {
    "overview": "<h3>Fairy</h3> <p>Togekiss possesses great bulk, decent typing, and a variety of offensive and utility moves. It's the only Fairy-type with access to Defog and can support its team with moves such as Heal Bell and Thunder Wave. Its access to Air Slash and Serene Grace gives it a 60% chance to make slower foes flinch, which makes it an excellent stallbreaker and Choice Scarf user. Its access to offensive moves such as Fire Blast and Aura Sphere allows it to deal with Steel-types that threaten Fairy such as Heatran, Empoleon, Ferrothorn, and even an unboosted Mega Scizor. Togekiss's Flying typing gives Fairy a Ground switch-in and a check to Pokemon like Mega Garchomp and Landorus, which Fairy would normally struggle with. With most Fairy-type Pokemon being slow, Togekiss can provide a great revenge killer with a Choice Scarf. Despite the many things it has going for it, Togekiss is weak to many common types such as Ice, Electric, and Rock, the latter of which gives it a Stealth Rock weakness, which hurts its defensive capabilities. It also has a mediocre Speed stat, leaving it outsped by many other Pokemon and faster Choice Scarf users. It also faces competition as a Choice Scarf user from Gardevoir, which has access to Healing Wish and stronger STAB moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Fairy</h4> <p>Heal Bell can be used on the Choice Scarf set over Aura Sphere or Dazzling Gleam to get rid of status on its teammates, but Togekiss will miss out on the coverage. A specially defensive utility set can be used with Air Slash, Thunder Wave, Roost, and either Defog or Heal Bell to spread paralysis and remove entry hazards or status, but it's very passive and throws away momentum from the offensive nature of most Fairy-type teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Fairy</h4> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Bulky Steel-type Pokemon such as Heatran, Empoleon, Jirachi, and Metagross resist both of Togekiss's STAB moves, take little from coverage moves, and can retaliate with their strong Steel-type STAB moves. Pokemon like Excadrill and Mega Scizor are able to check Togekiss, but they must be wary of Babiri Berry variants with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-type Pokemon resist Togekiss's STAB Air Slash and don't take much damage from its other moves because they're not boosted by STAB. In return, they can deal super effective damage to Togekiss and take it out. Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Lanturn are notable defensive threats, as they don't take much damage from any of Togekiss's coverage moves. Offensive checks include faster Pokemon such as Thundurus and Raikou.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Although Togekiss carries super effective coverage for Ice-type Pokemon, a lot of them carry Ice Shard and some even outspeed non-Choice Scarf Togekiss such as Weavile, Kyurem-B, and Mega Glaile.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-type Pokemon resist Togekiss's STAB Air Slash and threaten it out with a STAB move. A lot of Rock-type Pokemon also are able to survive Togekiss's Aura Sphere, especially with sand support.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types like Nidoking, Gengar, and Scolipede can outspeed and threaten Togekiss, but they must be wary of Choice Scarf Togekiss and potential flinches from Air Slash.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Sets without Heal Bell are easily crippled by status, especially the Choice Scarf set. Paralysis makes Togekiss slower than most Pokemon, preventing it from immobilizing the foe. Poison and burn wear it down pretty fast and make it harder for it to check threats because its health needs to be preserved in those match-ups.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Taking damage from entry hazards or health-crippling status is bad for Togekiss because Fairy teams have no hazard removal, and it prevents Togekiss from checking Pokemon reliably, as it gets worn down pretty fast, especially by poison and burn.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf (Fairy)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Air Slash is the move that Choice Scarf Togekiss is going to lock itself into most of the time because of it being a STAB attack with a 60% chance to flinch thanks to Togekiss's Serene Grace ability and having hardly any drawbacks other than its imperfect accuracy. Fire Blast deals with Steel-type Pokemon like Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Magnezone, and Doublade, which are big threats to Fairy. Flamethrower is an option for consistent accuracy, but it fails to OHKO Magnezone and bulky variants of Mega Scizor after Stealth Rock. Aura Sphere is a good move for hitting Steel-types that Fire Blast won't be as effective against such as Heatran and Empoleon. It's also a more reliable way of hitting Bisharp. Dazzling Gleam can be used as a secondary STAB move against Pokemon that resist Air Slash, but Togekiss usually doesn't need a Fairy-type STAB attack. Trick allows Togekiss to give its Choice Scarf to another Pokemon, potentially locking them into a non-attacking move. Trick is especially useful for breaking the Eviolite core of Chansey + Porygon2 on Normal and crippling other Pokemon that are annoying to Fairy such as Mew and Lanturn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Togekiss to outspeed as many threats as possible and Speed tie with other base 80 Speed Choice Scarf users, allowing it to be as effective as it can be at revenge killing. Maximum investment in Special Attack maximizes Togekiss's offensive capabilities and allows it to deal as much damage as possible to the foe. Choice Scarf increases Togekiss's Speed and its stallbreaking and revenge killing potential. Serene Grace increases the chance of secondary effects, which Togekiss strongly takes advantage of with Air Slash's high chance to flinch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Togekiss can switch in on neutral or resisted hits well thanks to its decent bulk. It can also switch into Ground-type attacks thanks to its immunity. Togekiss can be used as a revenge killer thanks to its Choice Scarf and access to Serene Grace Air Slash, which has a high chance to flinch. It's able to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Zapdos, Skarmory, Chansey, and Porygon2 with Trick. It can deal massive damage to Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Bisharp with Fire Blast or Aura Sphere; however, it cannot switch in on a Steel-type attack. Togekiss has to be played carefully if Stealth Rock is up due to its Rock weakness.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Diancie can prevent Stealth Rock from going up with its Magic Bounce ability, giving Togekiss more freedom in switching in. Klefki is a great answer to many of Togekiss's weaknesses, as it has a resistance to Ice and Rock, an immunity to Poison, and neutrality to Steel. Klefki is also able to spread paralysis, which Togekiss takes advantage of by combining it with Air Slash flinches. It can also set up dual screens to let Togekiss take hits better, allowing it to survive a Iron Head from Excadrill or a Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor to OHKO it with Fire Blast. Clefable can set up Stealth Rock and, like Klefki, spread paralysis. It's also able to help Togekiss deal with Steel-types if it's carrying Fire-type coverage, because otherwise Togekiss is under serious pressure when it comes to beating teams with cores such as Mega Scizor + Doublade + Bisharp, (pluses) which all take advantage of priority and have access to Swords Dance. Azumarill can break through Heatran and Empoleon, two Pokemon that switch into Togekiss easily and wall a lot of Fairy-types. Mega Gardevoir and Choice Specs Sylveon help in breaking walls that require many flinches for Togekiss to beat.</p>"
      },
      "Babiri Berry (Fairy)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Air Slash is a reliable STAB move with a high chance to flinch the foe. Fire Blast hits Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, which are threatening to Fairy-type teams, and OHKOes Mega Scizor. Aura Sphere hits Heatran and Empoleon harder than Fire Blast and also hits Bisharp more reliably. Roost allows Togekiss to replenish its health after getting weakened by an attack or entry hazards.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Babiri Berry weakens a super effective Steel-type move, which allows Togekiss to check Choice Band Scizor, +2 Mega Scizor, and Excadrill. Full investment in HP and 52 EVs in Defense allow Togekiss to survive a +2 Bullet Punch from Adamant Mega Scizor after Stealth Rock. 32 EVs in Special Attack allow Togekiss to always OHKO offensive Mega Scizor from full HP and specially defensive Mega Scizor after Stealth Rock. 176 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Togekiss to outspeed positive-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon, notably Bisharp and Breloom. Serene Grace increases the chance of secondary effects, which Togekiss strongly takes advantage of with Air Slash's high chance to flinch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Thanks to the Babiri Berry, Togekiss can take any one Steel-type move, but it should still not be switched into one. It is one of the few Mega Scizor checks that Fairy teams have to offer, and it can also check other Steel-type threats such as Excadrill and Cobalion if they have taken prior damage. It struggles to get past specially defensive Steel-type Pokemon such as Heatran and Empoleon due to its lack of Special Attack investment. It can switch in on neutral or resisted hits well thanks to its decent bulk, but it needs to be kept healthy if the opposition has a Mega Scizor so it can check it as effectively as possible. Togekiss can switch into Ground-type attacks thanks to its immunity. It has to be played carefully if Stealth Rock is up due to its weakness to it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Thanks to its Magic Bounce ability, Mega Diancie can prevent Stealth Rock from going up and pressuring Togekiss. Klefki is a great partner for Togekiss, as it resists many of its weaknesses, has an immunity to Poison, and is neutral to Steel. Klefki can also spread paralysis, allowing Togekiss to have an easier time incapacitating the foe. Clefable sets up Stealth Rock and is also able to spread paralysis and check Steel-type Pokemon with Fire Blast if Togekiss has already used its Babiri Berry. Azumarill is able to break through some Pokemon that Fairy-types don't like facing such as Heatran and Empoleon thanks to its high Attack and access to Superpower. It can also deal with specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, which this set struggles to beat. Gardevoir is a common Choice Scarf user on Fairy-type teams that can outspeed Choice Scarf Magnezone and take it out with Focus Blast, removing a big threat to Togekiss and its team. It also checks Sand Rush Excadrill thanks to its Trace ability. Mega Gardevoir and Choice Specs Sylveon are two strong wallbreakers that can assist Togekiss in breaking walls that take a lot of flinches for Togekiss to beat. These two Pokemon do particularly well against bulky Electric-type Pokemon such as Zapdos, Lanturn, and Rotom-W, which wall Togekiss.</p>"

      "Stallbreaker (Fairy)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot boosts Togekiss's Special Attack and turns it into an excellent stallbreaker, being able to take down even the bulkiest of Pokemon through flinches with boosted Air Slashes. Air Slash is Togekiss's main STAB attack with a high chance to flinch thanks to Serene Grace. Heal Bell lets Togekiss get rid of its own status as well as status inflicted on teammates. Roost allows Togekiss to replenish its health when it's weakened. Fire Blast, Aura Sphere, or Thunder Wave can be used over Heal Bell to hit Steel-types or spread paralysis, but this set prefers Heal Bell because it's crippled by status.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full investment in HP and 80 EVs in Defense allow Togekiss to always survive a Bullet Punch from Choice Band Scizor at full HP. 176 EVs in Speed with a Timid nature let Togekiss outspeed positive-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Bisharp and Breloom. Leftovers allows Togekiss to restore a bit of health each turn, increasing its longevity. Serene Grace boosts the chance of secondary effects of moves activating and lets Togekiss take better advantage of Air Slash, which now has a 60% flinch chance.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Togekiss is a great status absorber thanks to Heal Bell. This set works really well against bulkier types such as Psychic, Water, and Normal, as it can get past Togekiss's usual checks such as Lanturn, Chansey, and even Heatran thanks to Heal Bell and Nasty Plot. Fairy lacks a good Water-resistant Pokemon, so the difficulties Togekiss provides for Water-types is very useful. It's the only Ground-immune option Fairy has, which is useful due to the lack of Fairy-type Ground-resistant Pokemon. It has to be played carefully if Stealth Rock is up due to its weakness to it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Klefki's resistances to many of Togekiss's weaknesses, as well as an immunity to Poison and a neutrality to Steel, make it a great partner for Togekiss. Klefki also has the ability to set up dual screens, allowing Togekiss to take hits even better. Clefable can set up Stealth Rock, spread paralysis, and check Electric-types such as Zapdos, Thundurus, and Rotom-W, which threaten Togekiss. Togekiss's ability to deal with Water-types makes Belly Drum Azumarill a great partner because it hates facing Water-types. Mega Diancie prevents the use of Stealth Rock thanks to its Magic Bounce ability, which Togekiss appreciates because it has a weakness to Rock. Choice Scarf Gardevoir can deal with Poison-types that outspeed and threaten Togekiss such as Gengar and Nidoking.</p>"

Thanks to Thick Fat, Mamoswine can also offensively check Ice-type attackers like Cloyster.

STAB Ice Shard can revenge kill weakened threats and is powerful enough to OHKO Latios after Stealth Rock and break Mega Sharpedo's Substitute. Knock Off targets Psychic-types, cripples Eviolite users such as Porygon2, and deals more damage to Pokemon that switch into its STAB moves like Rotom-W. Thick Fat allows Mamoswine to deal with Ice-type attackers such as Cloyster and tank STAB moves from some Fire-type Pokemon like V-create from Victini and Fire Blast from offensive Volcarona. Mamoswine utilizes Choice Band to maximize its potential as a wallbreaker and revenge killer, becoming powerful enough to 2HKO physically defensive Swampert with Earthquake and OHKO Hawlucha with Ice Shard after Stealth Rock. Fully investing in Attack and Speed with an Adamant nature allows Mamoswine to deal as much damage as possible while outpacing Adamant Diggersby, physically defensive Staraptor, and specially defensive Jirachi.</p> <p>Mamoswine threatens Dragon-, Ground-, and Flying-types like Garchomp, Landorus, and Hawlucha and is one of the very few Ground-type Pokemon capable of dealing with Gliscor. Mamoswine can assist Landorus and Mega Garchomp by offensively checking Ice-types like Cloyster. It may help Excadrill by taking out weakened threats with Ice Shard and using Knock Off to cripple Eviolite users like Porygon2 and Chansey. Hippowdon can passively damage foes by setting sand and Stealth Rock and works as a switch-in to the likes of Mega Lopunny and Terrakion. Excadrill in sand can check faster threats like Kyurem-B for Mamoswine and provides a switch-in to Grass Knot from Thundurus and Heliolisk. Mega Garchomp is a Fire-resistant teammate that can check Mega Charizard Y and utilizes its mixed set to wear down walls like Rotom-W. Landorus uses its powerful special attacks to chip physical defensive walls like Skarmory and may set Gravity so that Rotom-W can no longer switch into Mamoswine. Gastrodon is immune to Water, which proves immensely useful against Pokemon like Rotom-W and Kingdra. It can also tank special attacks with its average bulk, reliable recovery, and great defensive typing while spreading status with Scald and Toxic. Seismitoad is an alternative Water-immune teammate that can check Belly Drum Azumarill.</p>"

  "Rotom-Wash": {
    "overview": "<h3>Electric</h3> <p>Rotom-W is the premier option for a physical wall on Electric-type teams. Its Electric / Water typing is great defensively and, when combined with access to a strong STAB move in Hydro Pump and an excellent ability in Levitate, makes Rotom-W one of the best Ground-type checks on Electric-type teams. Rotom-W also has access to Volt Switch, allowing it to be a great pivot and scout opposing threats. Rotom-W's great physical bulk paired with Will-O-Wisp allows it to switch into and cripple a large number of physical attackers such as Excadrill, Landorus-T, Mamoswine, Azumarill, and Mega Swampert. However, its rather low HP stat and lack of reliable recovery prevent it from lasting long on the field. Rotom-W's typing makes it almost useless in the Grass matchup, being beaten by several threats to Electric-types such as Mega Venusaur, Breloom, and Serperior. Its Speed is also mediocre, and therefore it has to rely on Choice Scarf to outspeed faster threats.</p> <h3>Water</h3> <p>Rotom-W's great defensive typing allows it to take neutral damage from Electric-type moves and only super effective damage from Grass-type attacks. It also has access to a very useful ability in Levitate, something Water teams appreciate, as they tend to have a lack of Pokemon immune to Ground-type moves. Great utility moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split, and a slow Volt Switch make Rotom-W a fantastic defensive pivot. This enables it to make full use of its great defensive stats and prove itself to be a valuable member on Water teams. Furthermore, its offensive stats aren't too shabby either; decent Speed and Special Attack along with its access to Trick make it a good Choice Scarf user. On the downside, Rotom-W suffers from a dreadful HP stat and a lack of reliable recovery. Status also wears down Rotom-W quickly. It also faces competition from Lanturn, which is immune to Electric-type moves and has access to great utility moves. Dual screens from Rotom-W enable non-rain hyper offense Water teams, featuring dangerous setup sweepers such as Mega Gyarados and Manaphy, to become viable.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Electric</h4> <p>A Choice Scarf set can be run with Trick, although it is outclassed by other attackers such as Raikou and Magnezone, as they have better coverage options and base Special Attack stats, and it wastes Rotom-W's defensive capabilities. Thunder Wave can be run over Pain Split or Will-O-Wisp; however, without Pain Split, it loses its most reliable way to recover health, and Will-O-Wisp is generally better, as it can catch threats that usually switch into it like Mega Venusaur. It can run dual screens with Light Clay, but without Leftovers and Pain Split, it reduces Rotom-W's longevity.</p> <h4>Water</h4> <p>Rest along with Chesto Berry can be used on the physically defensive set, as Pain Split is very unreliable. However, Chesto Berry can only be used once, so Rest will leave Rotom-W unable to move for at least two turns if used after Chesto Berry is consumed. Thunder Wave is another suboptimal option instead of Pain Split and allows Rotom-W to deter fast threats that aren't hindered by Will-O-Wisp, such as Mega Charizard Y, Latios, Gengar, and Hydreigon. Another set that may be used on Rotom-W is a dual screens set with Light Clay. Water-type teams, however, prefer the physically defensive or Choice Scarf set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Electric</h4> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-type Pokemon resist both of Rotom-W's STAB moves, and none of them are threatened by a Will-O-Wisp except Breloom.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Rotom-W cannot switch into and can barely survive a hit from wallbreakers such as Choice Band Dragonite, Mega Gardevoir, Choice Specs Meloetta, Mega Charizard Y, and Life Orb or Choice Band Kyurem-B.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Rotom-W doesn't do anything to most Dragon-type Pokemon, as they resist both of its STAB moves, although a few Pokemon such as Garchomp and Dragonite do need to be wary of Will-O-Wisp. Common special wallbreakers like Latios and Life Orb Kyurem-B can KO it, and setup sweepers such as Mega Latias can set up Calm Mind on it.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Due to lack of reliable recovery, Rotom-W cannot switch into Stealth Rock often. It also gets worn down very quickly by status ailments such as burns and Toxic poison.</p> <h4>Water</h4> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Resisting both of Rotom-W's STAB moves and hitting it super effectively, Grass-types, such as Mega Venusaur, Serperior, and Breloom, are ideal counters for Rotom-W. Ferrothorn sets up entry hazards on Rotom-W, although it does somewhat mind Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types, particularly those that do not fear Will-O-Wisp, such as Latios, Latias, and Hydreigon, do a great job at beating Rotom-W, taking little damage from its STAB moves. However, most of them fear the rare Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Specially defensive walls, such as Chansey and Gastrodon, are excellent at wearing down Rotom-W with Toxic while being able to heal off any damage taken. However, they need to watch out for the Choice Scarf set, as it gets access to Trick, completely crippling them.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Most wallbreakers, such as Mega Charizard Y, Choice Specs Meloetta, and Mega Heracross, find it easy to break through Rotom-W after Stealth Rock damage.</p>",

      "Defensive Pivot (Electric)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch allows Rotom-W to slowly pivot into a wallbreaker, such as Magnezone or Luxray, while also hitting threats like Belly Drum Azumarill and Crawdaunt hard. Hydro Pump is Rotom-W's strongest Water-type STAB move and allows it to hit most Ground-type Pokemon that it checks, such as Landorus-T, Mamoswine, Mega Camerupt, and Hippowdon. Will-O-Wisp lets it cripple physical attackers such as Dragonite, Bisharp, and Landorus-T, all of which are threats to Electric-type teams. Pain Split is Rotom-W's most reliable way to recover HP, but it is very inconsistent. Rest can be used with a Chesto Berry to heal HP back completely and get rid of status conditions; however, it can only be used once, whereas Pain Split can be used multiple times.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum EVs in Defense with a Bold nature allow Rotom-W to switch into physical attackers such as Victini, Mega Swampert, Landorus-T, and Excadrill much more easily. 248 EVs in HP maximize Rotom-W's bulk and also allow it to take less damage from Stealth Rock. 8 EVs in Speed allow it to outspeed Adamant Crawdaunt and standard Belly Drum Azumarill, both of which can be threats once they have set up. Leftovers gives Rotom-W passive recovery, as it is worn down rather easily by Stealth Rock damage and status ailments, reducing its effectiveness. Levitate gives Rotom-W an immunity to Ground-type attacks, which is very important in the Ground matchup. An alternative EV spread of 128 HP / 252 Def / 128 Spe can be used to Speed creep neutral base 70s such as Breloom and Bisharp, although it loses a significant amount of bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-W can be switched into most Pokemon it checks, such as Azumarill and most physical Ground-type Pokemon, but it should be wary of special attackers. While it does not have a terrible Special Defense stat, it takes more damage than it can afford to due to its lack of reliable recovery. Rotom-W should limit the damage it takes, as it needs to be at a decent amount of health to take neutral STAB moves from strong wallbreakers such as Dragonite and Terrakion. Rotom-W should be careful of Mold Breaker users such as Excadrill and Kyurem-B that can break through Levitate and hit it hard with powerful Ground-type moves. It should use Pain Split on walls that have a high HP stat, such as Chansey, to steal more health. It also should take advantage of Volt Switch to break potential Focus Sashes and Sturdy, as well as pivot into its teammates to check other threats that oppose Rotom-W. Rotom-W should not switch into Stealth Rock very often; because of its lack of reliable recovery, it loses a lot of health, which reduces its ability to switch into physical attacks. Rotom-W should also try to avoid status conditions, as they wear it down very quickly. Rotom-W should always use Will-O-Wisp on physical attackers to cripple them so its teammates have an easier time KOing them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom-W fits well on every Electric build and is a huge part of its Volt Switch core. Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Magnezone, Choice Specs Raikou, and Choice Band Luxray appreciate Rotom-W's slow Volt Switch, which allows them to come into threats without taking damage. Zapdos is a great defensive complement to Rotom-W, being able to take special hits and get rid of Stealth Rock with Defog. Zapdos can also whittle down walls that Rotom-W can't touch, like Gastrodon and Seismitoad, with Toxic. It appreciates having Rotom-W to switch into Ice- and most Rock-type attacks, too. Mega Ampharos also pairs well with Rotom-W; its defensive set complements it in alleviating the pressure of being the only physically defensive Pokemon, and it is a good switch-in to Grass-type moves. The RestTalk variant also acts as a great status absorber for Rotom-W.</p>"

      "Physically Defensive Pivot (Water)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch is Rotom-W's main STAB move, allowing it to gain momentum for the team and pivot into an appropriate check. Will-O-Wisp allows Rotom-W to inflict burn on the foe and hinder physical attackers, such as Mega Gallade, that may threaten it or the team. Hydro Pump is a strong secondary STAB move that also hits Ground-types that may try to switch in on a Volt Switch, such as Mold Breaker Excadrill. Pain Split can be used when Rotom-W is worn down to regain some HP, but it tends to be very inconsistent due to being dependent on the foe's HP.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs, maximum Defense EVs, and a Bold nature let Rotom-W take physical hits as best as it can while taking less passive damage from Stealth Rock and status. Leftovers is Rotom-W's best recovery option throughout the match, as it lacks a reliable way to regain its health besides Pain Split, which is situational. 8 Speed EVs let Rotom-W outspeed and OHKO Adamant Crawdaunt, which may otherwise threaten it. Levitate makes Rotom-W a good switch-in to Ground-type moves, something most Water teams lack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-W can be used early-game to scout and gain momentum with Volt Switch. It can spam Will-O-Wisp, as almost nothing likes to switch in besides Guts users, such as Heracross and Conkeldurr, or Fire-types, such as Mega Charizard Y. However, Rotom-W should be protected from status, as that wears it down very easily. It should avoid Knock Off, as Leftovers is its main method of recovery because of how unreliable Pain Split is. Rotom-W needs to watch out for Mold Breaker users and their variants, such as Kyurem-B and Excadrill, which can negate Levitate and hit it with strong Ground-type coverage in the form of Earth Power and Earthquake, respectively. Rotom-W should be switched in on Pokemon that it can pivot on, such as Volcanion and Garchomp. Even though it has decent Special Defense, this set does not appreciate getting worn down by special attacks. Thus, it is generally wise to switch out against strong special attackers. Due to its lack of recovery, Rotom-W is an unreliable check to wallbreakers and should almost never switch directly into them, as the likes of Mega Heracross and Mega Charizard Y can easily break it with two attacks. Pain Split is best used against walls with a large amount of HP; in fact, using it on a full HP Chansey can actually restore Rotom-W to maximum health. Rotom-W does not appreciate Stealth Rock damage, as it usually switches in and out quite often. If it loses too much health, it fails to wall most of the Pokemon that it is supposed to. Thus, keeping Stealth Rock away is a wise idea.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Empoleon is a great partner, as it is able to take Grass-type moves and most special attacks with ease. It benefits from Rotom-W's immunity to Ground-type moves that threaten it. Rotom-W's physical bulk helps Empoleon, as Empoleon does not like staying in on most physical hits. As Rotom-W forces a lot of switches, Stealth Rock on the opposing side of the field is very helpful. Likewise, Rotom-W feels the need to switch in and out quite a lot, and Empoleon and Tentacruel's ability to get rid of Stealth Rock is highly appreciated. Tentacruel also has a great Special Defense stat to sponge special hits that threaten Rotom-W, Toxic Spikes, which is extremely useful to take full advantage of the switches Rotom-W forces, and a neutrality to Grass-type moves. On the other hand, Rotom-W takes most Ground- and Electric-type hits with ease. Setup sweepers, such as Mega Gyarados and Manaphy, appreciate the slow Volt Switch and Will-O-Wisp Rotom-W provides, the latter of which hinders physical attackers, making it easier to set up on them. Volt Switch makes Rotom-W a premier pivot and scout, something that wallbreakers such as Azumarill, Mega Sharpedo, Crawdaunt, and Volcanion appreciate. Volcanion also benefits from Rotom-W's immunity to Ground-type moves, while it can take out Grass-type Pokemon that threaten Rotom-W. Swampert and Lanturn are great for their Electric immunity, as Rotom-W's lack of special bulk makes it incapable of switching into common special Electric-type attacks. Slowbro is another great partner, as it is able to take on Choice Band Dragonite, which is one of the few Pokemon that can threaten Rotom-W.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf (Water)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch helps Rotom-W fulfill its role as a pivot by being able to inflict damage, switch out to an appropriate counter, and scout what move the opponent goes for. Hydro Pump is a stronger STAB move that deals with Ground-types that might switch in, such as Landorus and Excadrill. It deals the most damage out of any of Rotom-W's moves and is most suitable for cleaning up late-game, although its poor accuracy is something to watch out for. Trick allows Rotom-W to deter walls that may switch in, such as Chansey and Gastrodon, as Choice Scarf severely limits their utility. Finally, Thunderbolt gives Rotom-W a stronger, reliable Electric-type attack that doesn't force it to switch out, unlike Volt Switch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack EVs are a must, permitting Rotom-W to make full use of its offensive capabilities. A Timid nature allows Rotom-W to outspeed certain base 80 Speed Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Gardevoir and Togekiss. Levitate makes Rotom-W capable of switching into Ground-type attacks, allowing it to pivot offensively into Ground-types.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-W should be used early-game to scout the foes' sets with Volt Switch. Hydro Pump or Thunderbolt should not be spammed early-game while Rotom-W's counters are still present, as it can result in a huge loss of momentum. Alternatively, when its check and counters are weakened, Rotom-W can clean up the opponent's team late-game. One of the cons of using a Choice item is becoming setup bait for Pokemon that do not take much damage from its Choice-locked STAB moves. Thus, it is wiser to use Volt Switch in most scenarios. Trick should usually only be used when you are sure that the opponent is going to switch out to the wall that you plan on hindering, as giving a Choice Scarf to the foe isn't always beneficial. Rotom-W should serve as a fast pivot or as a revenge killer, as it lacks power. Because this set lacks defensive investment, it has a harder time switching into attacks. Try to take advantage of Rotom-W's Ground immunity to safely bring it in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Empoleon is a great teammate for Rotom-W because it takes the Grass-type hits aimed at Rotom-W rather easily. Likewise, Empoleon benefits from Rotom-W's ability to switch into Ground-type attacks. Being able to scout the foes' sets proves to be beneficial to setup sweepers such as Manaphy and Mega Gyarados. It can also weaken the opponent's team to let the aforementioned Pokemon have an easier time sweeping. Rotom-W appreciates the support that wallbreakers such as Azumarill, and Volcanion provide, as punching holes in the opponent's team can permit a late-game sweep. Azumarill breaks through Dragon-types very easily, most of which Rotom-W cannot touch. Volcanion's ability to take down Grass-types is equally appreciated. Choice Scarf Rotom-W makes a great addition to Swift Swim teams as a fast pivot because Swift Swim users, such as Mega Swampert, Seismitoad, and Kingdra, benefit from Rotom-W's ability to scout the opposing team. Politoed is mandatory, as Swift Swim teams need it for its ability, Drizzle. Mega Sharpedo appreciates the support provided by Choice Scarf Rotom-W in scouting and weakening the opposing team to make it easier for Mega Sharpedo to clean up late-game. Rotom-W needs to switch in and out continuously while performing its role as a scout. Thus, it benefits from Starmie's ability to get rid of entry hazards.</p>"

      "Dual Screens (Water)": {
        "description": "<p>Reflect allows Rotom-W's teammates to better take on physical threats such as Mega Gallade and Dragonite, while Light Screen allows them to take on fearsome special wallbreakers such as Latios and Landorus. Thunder Wave halts faster threats such as Nasty Plot Deoxys-S and Manaphy from sweeping the team. Volt Switch allows Rotom-W to bring in teammates to take advantage of limited dual screens turns. The EV investment allows Rotom-W to always survive Choice Specs Latios's Draco Meteor and almost always survive Choice Band Dragonite's Outrage. 0 Speed IVs alongside a Relaxed nature allow Rotom-W to pivot with Volt Switch after the opposing Rotom-W, allowing it to keep momentum. Manaphy and Mega Gyarados are the two prominent setup sweepers on hyper offense Water teams due to their natural bulk and strong setup moves; they can easily turn the tides of a game behind dual screens. Mega Gyarados is particularly helpful in the Psychic and Flying matchups, while Manaphy can take on opposing Water teams with ease due to Energy Ball.</p>"

  "Victini": {
    "overview": "<h3>Fire</h3> <p>Victini's good Speed and amazing STAB move in V-create turn it into one of the most fearsome Choice Scarf users in the Monotype metagame. To increase Victini's offensive presence, it has access to fantastic coverage moves in Bolt Strike, Glaciate, and Energy Ball and a move to pivot with in U-turn. Defensively, Victini's decent bulk due to its all-around base 100 stats makes it one of the few bulky offensive Pokemon Fire teams have access to. This is only supported by its rare Psychic typing, which lets it switch into Fighting-type attacks from the likes of Mega Medicham and Breloom. However, since V-create lowers Victini's defensive stats and Speed, it is left vulnerable to revenge killers. Victini still suffers from the dreadful weakness to Stealth Rock, which hinders it from effectively pivoting with U-turn and switching in and out due to the stat drops from V-create. Victini is also weak to common moves like Scald, Knock Off, and Sucker Punch. Lastly, Victini's Speed stat puts it in the populated base 100 Speed tier, which creates Speed ties against other Choice Scarf base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Jirachi.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Fire</h4> <p>Victini can run Energy Ball to deal with Rock- and Water-type Pokemon that can otherwise easily wall it, such as Gastrodon, Omastar, and Slowbro. However, Victini prefers running Zen Headbutt because it is a decent STAB attack that hits targets like Terrakion, which Victini can use to clean consistently late-game. Glaciate can be used to threaten Dragon-type Pokemon and lower their Speed; however, with 0 Special Attack investment, it won't deal much damage to most bulky Dragon-types such as Latias, Kyurem-B, and Hydreigon. Trick can be used to cripple walls such as Porygon2, Chansey, and Zapdos. However, Trick will leave Victini with a less useful item than Choice Scarf in most cases. A specially offensive set can be run with Choice Scarf to utilize Victini's fantastic special movepool, but the physical set is much more stronger and acts as a better wallbreaker. Similarly, a Choice Band set can be run to increase its Attack even more but misses out on outspeeding Pokemon such as Weavile and Terrakion.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Fire</h4> <p><strong>Gastrodon</strong>: Gastrodon's Water / Ground typing allows it to be immune to or resist Victini's attacks barring Zen Headbutt and the rare Energy Ball. Even then, Zen Headbutt does minimal damage and Gastrodon can easily Recover it off.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-type Pokemon like Hippowdon and Garchomp easily tank both of Victini's STAB moves and can either stall it out or KO it with their Ground-type STAB move although they need to be cautious of Energy Ball or Glaciate.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Although Dragonite and Garchomp fear Glaciate, most Dragon-types such as Latias, Latios, and Kyurem-B barely take any damage from it. For non-Glaciate sets, all Dragon-types resist V-create and take little damage from Zen Headbutt. Latias can stall Victini out with Roost, while Garchomp and Dragonite can OHKO Victini with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Tyranitar, Terrakion, Aggron, and Mega Diancie can take one hit from Victini and OHKO back with their respective Rock-type move.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Heatran is immune to V-create and takes little damage from Victini's other moves. It can then Toxic stall Victini, damage it with Earth Power, or set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralysis hinders Victini's role as a revenge killer and makes it easy to revenge kill instead. Pokemon with paralysis that can take on Victini would include Rotom-W, Lanturn, and Porygon2.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, heavily hinder Victini's ability to switch in and out freely with U-turn. Other types of entry hazards such as Spikes and Toxic Spikes reduce Victini's longevity greatly.</p> <p><strong>Revenge killers</strong>: Speed and defensive stat drops from V-create make Victini incredibly easy to revenge kill. Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Landorus outspeed Victini after one V-create, while Choice Scarf Terrakion and Choice Scarf Latios outspeed it anyway. Sucker Punch users such as Bisharp also trouble Victini.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf (Fire)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>V-create is Victini's strongest STAB move and turns Victini into a wallbreaker. The sheer power of V-create lets Victini OHKO or at least weaken most Pokemon, such as 2HKOing Mew and OHKOing Zapdos after Stealth Rock damage. Bolt Strike is used to KO Flying- and Water-type Pokemon like Gyarados, Togekiss, and Azumarill. Zen Headbutt is Victini's secondary STAB move and allows it to beat Fighting- and Poison-type Pokemon such as Infernape, Terrakion, and Dragalge. Zen Headbutt is also useful for cleaning up late-game, as it does not have any drawbacks, unlike V-create. U-turn lets Victini pivot and gain momentum, and it is also useful to lure in Dark-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Hydreigon and then switch out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature and Choice Scarf allows Victini to outspeed Choice Scarf Kyurem-B and Speed tie with other Choice Scarf-using base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Jirachi. Maximum Attack investment allows Victini to maximize the power of its moves. Victory Star is used to increase the accuracy of V-create, Bolt Strike, and Zen Headbutt.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Victini can be used early-game to scout and pivot out with U-turn. Victini functions as an excellent revenge killer due to its Choice Scarf, which lets it outpace and KO most Pokemon that are weak to its STAB moves. V-create turns Victini into a fantastic wallbreaker and can even help Victini break through a few walls due to its sheer power, which lets its teammates clean up later. Against some setup sweepers that boost their Speed, try to switch Victini in as soon as possible. For example, if an opposing Gyarados is allowed to set up Dragon Dance twice, it will outspeed and OHKO Victini. Try to avoid status effects like poison and paralysis, as they can heavily hinder Victini's chances to revenge kill. Even though Victini can function as a wallbreaker, it has a hard time actually switching into walls, as it hates status, and has a more difficult time breaking physical walls such as Hippowdon and Porygon2. Victini can get worn down very easily if Stealth Rock is on the field. This also hinders its ability to U-turn in and out freely, so removing them before bringing in Victini is a must. Due to V-create's stat drops, Victini needs to be careful of locking itself into it. Setup sweepers that resist V-create such as Mega Gyarados and Belly Drum Azumarill can easily take advantage of Victini once it's locked into it. Similarly, you need to be wary of being locked into Bolt Strike, as this gives Ground-types such as Diggersby, Landorus, and Gliscor a free switch in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Torkoal is a reliable entry hazard remover for Victini. Torkoal can also set up its own Stealth Rock to deal chip damage throughout the game and acts as a defensive backbone for Victini. Mega Charizard Y is another good entry hazard remover and provides a Ground immunity. Mega Charizard Y works exceptionally well with Victini due to its great offensive stats, which let it take out counters to Victini such as Slowbro and Swampert, and its ability to set up Drought for Victini. Under the sun, Victini turns into an excellent wallbreaker. Volcanion provides a Water immunity and can cripple Pokemon with Steam Eruption burns. Volcanion can also KO and threaten Ground- and Rock-type Pokemon that normally threaten Victini. Victini can U-turn into Volcanion and Mega Charizard Y, both of which take great advantage of being able to break down Victini's switch-ins. Heatran can be used as an alternative Stealth Rock user, cripple defensive Pokemon that wall Victini with Toxic, and also help Victini against Fairy-type Pokemon such as Mega Diancie, Gardevoir, and Togekiss. Rotom-H forms a VoltTurn core with Victini; helps Victini against Flying-type Pokemon like Landorus-T, which would otherwise beat Victini; and provides a Ground immunity. Volcarona works exceptionally well with Victini, as it appreciates Victini's wallbreaking ability to help it clean up easier late-game. On the flip side, Volcarona can take out bulky Psychic- and Dark-types that could wall Victini. Infernape can run a number of roles to better suit Victini. Infernape turns into a fantastic counter to Dark- and Rock-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Cradily with an offensive Life Orb set, while it can also run a more supportive set with Stealth Rock and Taunt to deal with Pokemon that could wall Victini. Infernape also has access to Mach Punch, which lets it pick off threats weakened by Victini. Entei functions as a great wallbreaker and late-game cleaner, threatening Flying- and Fairy-type Pokemon for Victini that beat Victini such as Landorus-T and Diancie. Like Infernape, Entei too has access to a priority move in Extreme Speed.</p>"

  "Excadrill": {
    "overview": "<h3>Ground</h3> <p>Excadrill is an unrivaled Sand Rush sweeper on Ground teams as a result of its outstanding Attack stat and good offensive typing. Sand Rush lets Excadrill outpace +1 base 110s and any unboosted Pokemon in sand, allowing it to check many offensive threats to Ground with its coverage such as Mega Gallade, Latios, Deoxys-S, and Weavile. Its Steel typing allows Excadrill to potentially come in on certain moves from threats, such as Grass Knot and Hidden Power Ice from Thundurus and Heliolisk and a predicted Toxic from Zapdos. Excadrill's low Speed stat along with its poor bulk makes it subject to revenge killing outside of sand. Getting it in after setting sand may also prove to be troublesome in some scenarios. In sand, its lackluster bulk leaves it open to priority moves like Mach Punch from Breloom and Sucker Punch from Bisharp.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Ground</h4> <p>Excadrill can run Rapid Spin as a niche option over Shadow Claw for entry hazard removal. However, setting sand and bringing in Excadrill only to lock into Rapid Spin loses momentum. There aren't many situations where Ground teams desperately need to get rid of entry hazards, and using Rapid Spin over Shadow Claw makes the Psychic matchup considerably worse.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Ground</h4> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory is able to reliably switch into any of Excadrill's moves as long as Gravity isn't up and recover any negligible damage done with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Physical walls like Hippowdon, Rotom-W, Mandibuzz, Slowbro, Swampert, and Porygon2 can all tank at least one hit from Excadrill and threaten it in some way.</p> <p><strong>Burn</strong>: Will-O-Wisp users such as Sableye and Mew can burn Excadrill, limiting its potential as a sweeper and revenge killer severely.</p> <p><strong>Weather Setters</strong>: Fast weather setters like Mega Charizard Y, assuming it has already Mega Evolved, are able to eliminate Excadrill's Speed advantage by nullifying Sand Rush and can often OHKO it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Fast revenge killers like Landorus and Victini can outspeed and OHKO Excadrill outside of sand. Trace users like offensive Gardevoir and Mega Alakazam, assuming the latter has already Mega Evolved, are able to outpace Excadrill in sand and OHKO with Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: After some chip damage, Excadrill is subject to being taken out before it has a chance to attack by priority moves like Aqua Jet, Mach Punch, and Sucker Punch from Pokemon like Azumarill, Breloom, and Bisharp, respectively.</p>",

      "Choice Band (Ground)": {
        "description": "<p>Earthquake is Excadrill's most powerful STAB move, and it becomes highly spammable after eliminating Ground-immune foes like Rotom-W and Staraptor. Iron Head lets Excadrill pick up KOs against Pokemon that resist or are immune to Earthquake such as Heracross and Gengar, and it targets Ice-, Fairy-, and Rock-types like Weavile, Togekiss, and Terrakion without having to lock into Earthquake. Rock Slide hits Flying-types like Zapdos, Thundurus, Mandibuzz, and Mega Charizard Y. Shadow Claw allows Excadrill to dominate against Psychic teams, being able to at least 2HKO every relevant Pokemon with Stealth Rock up outside of Meloetta. X-Scissor is a niche option over Shadow Claw to hit Meloetta and do more damage to Slowbro and Celebi. However, giving up Shadow Claw leads to Excadrill losing momentum against Psychic-types that take neutral damage from X-Scissor like Jirachi, Victini, Mega Gallade, and Mega Gardevoir. Choice Band increases Excadrill's potential as a sweeper and revenge killer, allowing it to net important OHKOs against threats like Kyurem-B, and Mega Gallade after prior chip damage. Maximum Attack and Speed investment with an Adamant nature allows Excadrill to do as much damage as possible and reach a fantastic Speed tier in sand, outpacing the likes of Deoxys-S and Choice Scarf Latias.</p> <p>Excadrill offers Ground teams its ability to offensively check Ice-types like Weavile and Mamoswine that would inhibit Garchomp and Landorus, function as a switch-in and check to Thundurus, which sweeps through the rest of the team outside of Mamoswine, and check fast offensive Psychic-types with good coverage like Life Orb Deoxys-S and Choice Specs Latios, which would otherwise overwhelm Ground's defensive core. Hippowdon provides indispensable support for Excadrill by setting sand and Stealth Rock and is able to switch into physical attackers like Mega Lopunny and Mega Gallade. Landorus can chip physical walls for Excadrill such as Skarmory, Rotom-W, and Hippowdon. Landorus can also set Gravity for Excadrill, allowing it to spam Earthquake freely, albeit briefly since sand and Gravity won't be up for long. Gastrodon is immune to Water, which proves to be very useful against threats like Kingdra, and can sponge special attacks with its decent bulk, good typing, and reliable recovery. Seismitoad is an alternative Water-immune teammate that has a better Speed tier and offensive movepool, including Sludge Wave for checking Belly Drum Azumarill and Knock Off, which can cripple various foes such as Eviolite holders like Chansey and Porygon2 or Leftovers users like Skarmory and Ferrothorn. Mega Garchomp's mixed wallbreaking proves useful against many common defensive cores, working with Landorus to take out physical and mixed walls, paving the way for Excadrill to sweep. Mega Garchomp is also another Fire-resistant teammate and can check Mega Charizard Y with Stone Edge. Mamoswine can easily threaten bulky Ground-types like Hippowdon, Gliscor, and bulky Garchomp with its Choice Band-boosted Icicle Crash. Additionally, it's the only source of priority on most Ground teams, being able to reliably take out weakened threats like Hydreigon and Yanmega with Ice Shard. Nidoking utilizes its wide array of Life Orb- and Sheer Force-boosted special attacks to break through certain walls for Excadrill, namely Skarmory and Gliscor. Furthermore, Nidoking may drop one of its coverage moves for Toxic Spikes to passively chip some of Excadrill's checks like Slowbro and Porygon2.</p>"

  "Seismitoad": {
    "overview": "<h3>Ground</h3> <p>Seismitoad's Water / Ground typing and access to Water Absorb give it a neutrality to Ice and an immunity to Water-type attacks. This makes it incredibly valuable for any Ground-type team, letting it check threats such as Crawdaunt and Azumarill. Seismitoad is one of the few viable special attackers that Ground teams have access to. However, without a boosting item, its Special Attack is not that impressive. It has a decent movepool with access to solid coverage options in Sludge Wave, which lets it target Grass- and Fairy-types, and Grass Knot, allowing it to hit other Pokemon with access to Water Absorb. It has decent bulk and is a great Assault Vest user. Although its typing and ability let it tank Water- and Ice-type attacks, it also has a 4x weakness to Grass. Seismitoad faces competition as a Water-type check from Gastrodon, which has better bulk and access to reliable recovery; however, Seismitoad has better coverage options and a lot more Speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Ground</h4> <p>A Leftovers set can be used with Knock Off, Toxic, Scald, and Stealth Rock; however, this set lacks the power to check Azumarill and is generally outclassed by Gastrodon, which possesses a reliable recovery move and has better bulk than Seismitoad. Stealth Rock is also more appropriate on Hippowdon, as it can reliably reset the hazard if it has been removed due to its better bulk and reliable recovery. A mixed Life Orb set is also a possibility but the damage output would be underwhelming especially compared to better mixed attackers such as Landorus and Mega Garchomp, and it isn't worth compromising Seismitoad's bulk. Hidden Power Fire is another option that is specifically used to break Scizor and Ferrothorn; however, it's difficult to fit onto Seismitoad's limited moveset.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Ground</h4> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-type Pokemon such as Whimsicott and Breloom resist Seismitoad's STAB moves and can force Seismitoad out. Some Grass-types have to watch out for Sludge Wave, however.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Even with maximum Special Attack investment and Choice Specs, Seismitoad still gets completely shut down by a large amount of common specially defensive walls, such as Chansey, Zapdos, Latias, Latios, and Mega Latias.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Meloetta and Mega Pinsir do a massive amount of damage to Seismitoad due to its subpar defenses.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types resist Seismitoad's Water-type attacks and most of them are immune to Ground, such as Latios, Latias, Dragonite, and Hydreigon. They threaten Seismitoad with their powerful attacks.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Seismitoad doesn't appreciate getting inflicted with status because status cripples its longevity and wears it down.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs (Ground)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald's ability to burn is particularly useful in breaking walls such as Porygon2 or Mew, along with crippling switch-ins that would normally counter it. Hydro Pump is a much stronger Water-type alternative; however, it lacks the ability to burn and has low accuracy, which are major drawbacks. Earth Power is Seismitoad's secondary STAB attack. It targets Pokemon that Scald doesn't do well against, such as Kyurem-B. Grass Knot is useful for taking on Water-types such as Swampert and Mega Gyarados. Sludge Wave targets Grass-types such as Whimsicott and Breloom that resist Seismitoad's other attacks, and Fairy-types such as Clefable and Azumarill.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>228 EVs in Speed allow Seismitoad to outspeed Adamant Breloom and Adamant Bisharp and OHKO them, while also outspeeding and 2HKOing Zapdos after Stealth Rock damage. 4 EVs in Special Defense make Porygon2's Download boost Attack rather than Special Attack. Full investment in Special Attack with Choice Specs maximizes Seismitoad's damage output. The remaining EVs are put into HP to increase bulk. Water Absorb makes Seismitoad immune to Water-type attacks, allowing it to check Water-type threats such as Swampert and Rotom-W. An alternate spread of 152 HP / 252 SpA / 104 Spe can be used so Seismitoad has just enough Speed to outpace Jolly Crawdaunt as well as Adamant Azumarill.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Seismitoad can switch in on Water-type attacks that threaten every other Pokemon on the team due to its immunity. However, it should be careful from other attacks the foe can go for if they predict Seismitoad to switch in. For example, Azumarill can punish Seismitoad with a Play Rough and Kingdra can go for Draco Meteor. Due to Seismitoad's lack of recovery, it's important to use it carefully and preserve its health in matchups where a Water-type switch-in is needed such as against Psychic teams with Slowbro. Avoid status because it cripples Seismitoad's longevity. In some matchups such as against Dark-type teams or Steel-type teams without Ferrothorn, Seismitoad can be used as a wallbreaker thanks to its Choice Specs because usually those types don't have solid resistances to Seismitoad's attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Seismitoad fits best on offensive teams that enjoy keeping up momentum. Seismitoad does not require much support defensively, as it is the one supporting the team by absorbing Water-type attacks and striking back with its offensive pressure. Most team options are instead to help Choice Specs Seismitoad's offensive wallbreaking capabilities. Mega Garchomp and Mega Camerupt help with Seismitoad's weakness to Grass-type attacks while Seismitoad can help with their Ice-type and Water-type weaknesses respectively. Mamoswine is a great partner due to its ability to check many Grass- and Dragon-type Pokemon that check Seismitoad such as Breloom and Latios, respectively. Excadrill is a great partner for Seismitoad because of its amazing wallbreaking capabilities and its ability to threaten specially defensive walls that Seismitoad has trouble getting past such as Chansey and Cradily. Hippowdon is a good teammate that appreciates Seismitoad's ability to switch into Water-type attacks. It also sets up Stealth Rock to put many foes such as Mega Gyarados and Zapdos into range of Seismitoad's powerful attacks. Landorus is useful as it can break walls that Seismitoad cannot such as Ferrothorn and Cradily. Together, they put a lot of pressure on the opposing team by weakening their shared checks over time. Landorus can also run Gravity, which helps Seismitoad break Flying teams with great ease, thanks to its powerful Earth Power.</p>"
      },
      "Assault Vest (Ground)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is one of Seismitoad's most reliable moves due to its decent Base Power and high chance to burn. Earth Power is Seismitoad's option for targeting Pokemon that resist its Scald such as Tentacruel and Kyurem-B. Grass Knot is great for hitting Water-type threats such as Swampert and Slowbro. Alternatively, Sludge Bomb can be used for hitting Grass- and Fairy-type Pokemon such as Serperior and Azumarill. Knock Off provides great utility by removing items such as Chansey's Eviolite and Ferrothorn's Leftovers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack with a Modest nature allows Seismitoad to deal as much damage to its foes as possible. 16 EVs in Speed allow Seismitoad to outspeed 0 Speed Mega Scizor as well as Walrein and Lapras that Speed creep Mega Scizor. The remaining EVs are put in HP to maximize Seismitoad's bulk. Water Absorb gives Seismitoad a Water-type immunity and allows it to switch in on most Water-types that threaten the rest of the team. Assault Vest increases Seismitoad's Special Defense and allows it to take special hits better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Assault Vest allows Seismitoad to pivot into a variety of special attacks with ease, while Water Absorb grants immunity to Water-type attacks, allowing it to check Water-type threats to the entire team such as Slowbro. It does have to watch out for other moves Water-types might go for if they expect Seismitoad to come in, however. Although Seismitoad's bulk is outstanding with an Assault Vest and large investment in HP, it still lacks reliable recovery, so it can only take a few hits before being worn out. It can take advantage of Water-type attacks to heal up in order to remedy this. It's important to avoid letting Seismitoad get inflicted with status because this wears Seismitoad down easily and cripples its longevity. Entry hazards can be a major issue, as they take a toll on Seismitoad's pivoting potential, and a weakened Seismitoad is easily defeated. Even with its Assault Vest, foes with Grass-type attacks can almost always easily OHKO or severely damage Seismitoad, so they should be played around cautiously. Scald and Knock Off are both fantastic moves for hitting switch-ins, as Scald can burn opposing Pokemon and Knock Off can remove their items. They can both be spammed pretty safely to wear down checks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive physical wallbreakers are necessary to work with Seismitoad, as many specially defensive walls shut it down. Wallbreakers also pair well with Seismitoad because they appreciate their checks having their items removed and being burned by Seismitoad. Landorus and Mega Garchomp are good examples of this, as they take out the walls that Seismitoad cannot touch such as Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur. Hippowdon is a good physical wall to work with Seismitoad in a defensive core. It can set up Stealth Rock and can force out setup sweepers with Whirlwind. Hippowdon also comes with Sand Stream to boost Mega Garchomp's Earthquake or double Excadrill's Speed, which both help Seismitoad by providing physically offensive pressure. Gliscor is a notable defensive partner for Assault Vest Seismitoad, as it can alleviate Seismitoad's major Grass-type weakness. Gliscor is also a great stallbreaker that takes out most of the walls that can stop Seismitoad. Landorus-T is particularly useful, as it can work as a powerful physically offensive pivot with Intimidate to weaken physical attackers while also helping with Seismitoad's Grass-type weakness. Mamoswine is a good offensive teammate that can beat Grass- and Dragon-types that threaten Seismitoad, although it cannot switch into them. Excadrill appreciates Seismitoad's ability to switch in to Fire- and Water-type attacks while providing powerful wallbreaking power.</p>"

  "Scolipede": {
    "overview": "<h3>Poison</h3> <p>Scolipede is very reliable on Poison teams because of its ability Speed Boost, which makes it a great cleaner and allows it to outspeed common Choice Scarf users such as Victini, Latios, and Kyurem-B. Scolipede also has access to reliable coverage moves such as Superpower, Aqua Tail, Rock Slide, and Earthquake, which allow it to check many Pokemon in the metagame. Scolipede's base 100 Attack stat coupled with Choice Band, Life Orb, or Swords Dance lets it function as an effective wallbreaker. Scolipede's typing sets it apart from other Poison-types, as its Bug typing and STAB Megahorn allow it to check Psychic-types that pose a huge threat to Poison teams, and it can take a couple of Ground-type attacks from powerful attackers.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Scolipede's typing makes it weak to Stealth Rock, limiting its opportunities to switch in. Scolipede also lacks reasonable bulk, meaning it can't take advantage of its neutrality to Ground-type attacks and can be revenge killed by priority moves. Despite being immune to Poison, Scolipede is vulnerable to other status effects such as burn and paralysis, both of which prevent Scolipede from being a late-game sweeper by hindering its effectiveness to either deal a lot of damage or outspeed other Pokemon. Scolipede also suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, which makes it unable to check every single type.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Poison</h4> <p>Poison Jab is a STAB attack that allows Scolipede to hit Fairy-types such as Togekiss, Sylveon, Whimsicott, and Azumarill; however, Scolipede has no use for the move because Nidoking, Mega Venusaur, and its other teammates run a Poison-type attack. Substitute allows Scolipede to avoid status moves such as Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp, shield itself from incoming attacks, and take advantage of a predicted switch or a non-attacking move. Spikes and Toxic Spikes assist in wearing down the opposing team much more quickly. However, Nidoqueen and Tentacruel fit the role of entry hazard setter better. Endeavor works very well with Focus Sash because Scolipede can bring the foe down to 1 HP for it or any of its teammates to eliminate. This can work well against a very threatening Pokemon or a Pokemon that tends to use it as setup fodder.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Poison</h4> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Scolipede is vulnerable to burn and paralysis, and they both greatly hinder its capabilities. Will-O-Wisp can shorten Scolipede's longevity and decrease the power of its attacks, making it useless. Priority paralysis from Pokemon such as Whimsicott, Klefki, and Thundurus can cut Scolipede's Speed and ruin its ability to outspeed other Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Scolipede doesn't appreciate switching into entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, making it more easier to KO and vulnerable against priority moves. Scolipede should also be wary of potential Rocky Helmet Pokemon such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Garchomp, and Slowbro.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Physically defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Mandibuzz, and Avalugg can all tank Scolipede's attacks very well. Hippowdon can use Whirlwind to disrupt Scolipede's attempt to set up Swords Dance and recover back any lost damage with Slack Off. Mandibuzz and Avalugg can deal passive damage when carrying Rocky Helmet and retaliate with Foul Play and Avalanche, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory can tank Scolipede's attacks very well and set up entry hazards without any trouble. It's not threatened to switch out by Scolipede's Swords Dance, even after a couple of boosts, and Skarmory can use Whirlwind to prevent it from setting up.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sweeper (Poison)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Megahorn is Scolipede's most powerful STAB move, allowing it to hit Dark-, Grass-, and Psychic-types such as Tyranitar, Celebi, and Mew. Protect allows Scolipede to scout the opposing Pokemon's moves while also activating Speed Boost. It's highly recommended to use Protect, because with an Adamant nature, Scolipede can't outspeed Mega Charizard Y and Cobalion pre-boost. Swords Dance can be used instead of Protect to boost Scolipede's Attack to higher levels, making it a dangerous sweeper. Earthquake gives Scolipede more coverage against Rock- and Steel-types, such as Mega Diancie and Magnezone, and Fire-types that aren't immune to Ground-type attacks, such as Heatran, Victini, and Entei. Rock Slide gives Scolipede coverage against Fire- and Flying-types that resist Megahorn, such as Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Togekiss.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack EVs with an Adamant nature augment Scolipede's damage output. Maximum Speed EVs allow Scolipede to outrun Jolly Gyarados, Mamoswine, and Timid Meloetta. A Jolly nature allows Scolipede to outspeed Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Latios and Swift Swim Kingdra after a Speed boost; however, without an Adamant nature, Scolipede misses out on the extra damage to secure a KO against Mega Gallade after Stealth Rock. Life Orb can be used to increase Scolipede's damage output even further at the cost of a bit of health with each successful attack, but Focus Sash can be used instead to guarantee that Scolipede will be able to survive an attack. Swords Dance should definitely be used with Focus Sash because this ensures that Scolipede is able to set up at least once; however, Scolipede misses out on the extra damage from Life Orb and has to find an opportunity to set up Swords Dance.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Scolipede should use Protect against potential Choice Scarf Pokemon to activate Speed Boost so it can outspeed them. It should also stay away from status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave, as they cut Scolipede's Attack and Speed, respectively. Keep Scolipede away from entry hazards because it is worn down fast and lacks reliable recovery. Preserve Scolipede early-game because it can't sweep late-game if it's already worn down. If Scolipede is running Focus Sash and Swords Dance, it should switch in after a fallen teammate to avoid taking any damage so its Focus Sash isn't negated.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Drapion is a great partner for Scolipede, as it can provide utility with Knock Off, removing items from Pokemon such as Chansey and Porygon2, as well as set up Toxic Spikes. Skuntank, Crobat, and Tentacruel can remove entry hazards with Defog or Rapid Spin. Crobat can also be a switch-in to Ground-type attacks thanks to its Flying typing and is a great pivot with U-turn, which helps gain momentum for Scolipede, especially if the opposing Pokemon tends to switch out. Gengar can switch into Ground-type moves and check Ghost-types for Scolipede along with being a great special wallbreaker. Both Nidoking and Nidoqueen can take on physical walls that tend to tank Scolipede's attacks such as Skarmory. Nidoqueen can provide entry hazard support with Stealth Rock, making it easier for Scolipede to KO threats. Mega Venusaur can take on Ground- and Rock-types that threaten Scolipede.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band (Poison)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Megahorn is Scolipede's primary STAB attack, denting anything that doesn't resist it. Rock Slide gives coverage against Bug-, Fire-, Flying-, and Ice-types. Earthquake provides great coverage for Steel-types that resist Megahorn such as Heatran, Doublade, and Magnezone. Superpower allows Scolipede to specifically hit Normal-types such as Chansey and Porygon2 for more damage, as both of these threats give Poison teams trouble. Aqua Tail can be used instead of Superpower if your team fears Ground-types more, hitting Pokemon such as Landorus and Gliscor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Scolipede to outpace Pokemon such as Latios, Gengar, Mega Gallade, and Terrakion. 252 Attack EVs and Choice Band maximize Scolipede's damage output, which makes it a potential wallbreaker, as it can 2HKO Chansey and Ferrothorn with Superpower while also having a chance to 2HKO Mega Venusaur with Megahorn, which is important because these three Pokemon are very annoying to Poison teams. Speed Boost is needed to outspeed Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Victini, and Magnezone.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Scolipede can be sent out early-game to wallbreak or be used as a revenge killer later in the match. Prediction is very important to anticipate what Pokemon is going to be sent out, so Scolipede can use the appropriate coverage move. Do not leave Scolipede on the field against physically defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory, Hippowdon, Mandibuzz, and Avalugg, as they're able to tank its attacks very well. It's best to have Scolipede avoid entry hazards as much as possible, as the residual damage will wear it down much quicker. Scolipede should not be switching into attacks, since its lack of reasonable bulk makes it take significant damage, and it hates to be inflicted with status.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Venusaur is a great partner for Scolipede, as it can help check Ground- and Rock-types. Special attackers such as Nidoking and Nidoqueen can take on physically defensive Pokemon that threaten Scolipede, such as Skarmory, Sableye, Avalugg, and Staraptor. Nidoqueen can also set up Stealth Rock, allowing Scolipede to KO threats much easier. Drapion can provide utility with Knock Off, crippling item-reliant Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Chansey. Entry hazard removers such as Tentacruel, Crobat, and Skuntank allow Scolipede to gain more opportunities to switch in and stay healthy. Gengar can switch into Ground-type moves and check Fighting-types with Dazzling Gleam while also taking on Ghost-types. It also has access to Destiny Bond, which will help take down a major threat that can potentially stop Scolipede. Together, Scolipede and Gengar can form a powerful offensive core, as they can break each other's checks. Weezing can provide support with Will-O-Wisp to cripple opposing Pokemon and weaken physical attackers for Scolipede to tank more effectively. It also has access to Pain Split, which is great for wearing down the foe.</p>"

  "Darmanitan": {
    "overview": "<p>Darmanitan is one of the best wallbreakers Fire has access to thanks to its amazing Attack and decent Speed. It has a great ability in Sheer Force, which increases the damage of its attacks that have a secondary effect such as its main STAB move, Flare Blitz, to go with its amazing Attack. To complement this, Darmanitan has a pretty decent movepool, which can help it threaten types that Fire generally has a difficult time facing. One of these moves is U-turn, which allows it to pivot thanks to its ability to force switches, gaining momentum for the user. Thanks to all these great offensive capabilities, Darmanitan rivals Victini as the physical Choice Scarf user that Fire uses. Despite its great offensive stats, though, it lacks severely in the defensive department with its awful bulk and no form of recovery. It also gets worn down very easily due to Stealth Rock and Flare Blitz recoil.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Darmanitan can also use Choice Band or Life Orb as its item while bluffing a Choice Scarf, as its ability Sheer Force negates the recoil from Life Orb if it uses a move with a secondary effect. These sets can be used if there is already a designated Choice Scarf user on the team, but due to Darmanitan's relatively average Speed, it's not advised.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types in general give Darmanitan a hard time, as it doesn't really have a good move to hit them with, while they can easily weaken it with a STAB move. Water-types such as Gyarados can easily set up on it with Dragon Dance, while bulkier ones such as Swampert, Gastrodon, Suicune, and Slowbro all easily take its moves and KO it back.</p> <p><strong>Garchomp</strong>: Garchomp can easily tank all of Darmanitan's moves while OHKOing it back with a super effective Earthquake. Other variants such as Tank Garchomp deal significant residual damage with Rocky Helmet + Rough Skin.</p> <p><strong>Terrakion</strong>: Choice Scarf Terrakion outspeeds Darmanitan and OHKOes it with a Stone Edge. It also survives all of Darmanitan's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: In general, most Dragon-types can take one hit from Darmanitan and OHKO it back with just their STAB attacks, although most of them can't switch into it.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physically defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Porygon2, and Slowbro can all take Darmanitan's hits and and cause it to take a lot of Flare Blitz's recoil damage.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status effects such as poison and paralysis heavily reduce Darmanitan's longevity and usability, as it becomes vulnerable to recoil damage and priority moves, and paralysis makes its item useless.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks</strong>: Due to its main attack causing high recoil damage, Darmanitan is very likely to put itself into range of priority attacks such as Sucker Punch from Bisharp or Extreme Speed from Dragonite, and its poor Defense doesn't help either.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: As Darmanitan's Speed is nothing spectacular and it lacks real bulk, it's easily outsped and KOed by faster Choice Scarf users such as Latios, Terrakion, and Hydreigon.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Darmanitan can easily get worn down due to recoil from Flare Blitz, as well as due to chip damage from Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Rocky Helmet.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is boosted by Sheer Force and STAB and 2HKOes most walls if not OHKOing them. U-turn is a great move for pivoting, as it scouts for the opponent's play and creates momentum for the user. Rock Slide hits Flying-types such as Gyarados and Dragonite while also being boosted by Sheer Force. Earthquake hits Steel-types and Rock-types, the latter of which Fire is weak to. Earthquake also hits opposing Fire-types super effectively without risking the miss with Rock Slide. In particular, after Stealth Rock damage, Earthquake OHKOes Mega Diancie, which Fire has a difficult time facing. Alternatively, Superpower is very useful so that Darmanitan does not have to take recoil against bulky Normal-type Pokemon. It also hits Air Balloon Heatran but misses out on the OHKO on other variants. Superpower hits almost the same types as Earthquake but is better against Dark, as it OHKOes Tyranitar, while being very spammable versus Normal as well.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>As Darmanitan is a Choice Scarf user, maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows it to become as fast as it can possibly be. It allows it to outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Choice Scarf Hoopa-U and to Speed tie with Choice Scarf Kyurem-B. Sheer Force is used to boost the power of Flare Blitz and Rock Slide to make Darmanitan a potential wallbreaker. Running maximum Attack investment allows it to hit as hard as possible even without an Attack-increasing ability.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Darmanitan should be used carefully to preserve its health, as it is prone to getting worn down by residual damage. Darmanitan can be sent out on the first turn to scout for the opponent's intentions then U-turn out. As it is a pure Fire-type, it is naturally weak to Stealth Rock, and as Flare Blitz has recoil, it should generally not be sent out with Stealth Rock on your side of the field. Darmanitan should avoid getting inflicted with status such as poison, which will heavily cripple its health. Paralysis is another huge status Darmanitan should avoid due to it quartering Darmanitan's Speed, which makes its Choice Scarf useless. Rock Slide and Earthquake are coverage moves and should only be used against Pokemon that are weak to them, as Flare Blitz will generally outdamage them, although they can be used to take out low-health foes to avoid recoil and preserve Darmanitan's health. Due to its amazing power, Darmanitan often forces switches, which you can predict and use U-turn on to gain momentum. Darmanitan can be used as a revenge killer to KO weaker Pokemon, but the user should be aware of Flare Blitz's recoil. Darmanitan can also be used as a wallbreaker due to its ridiculous power, although the recoil taken from Flare Blitz if it attacks bulky walls will reduce its sweeping chances.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Darmanitan is a Fire-type, a hazard-removing partner like Torkoal or Charizard is absolutely crucial. Torkoal in particular is a great partner due to its ability to set up its own Stealth Rock, which helps cripple opposing Pokemon by breaking Focus Sashes and dealing chip damage throughout the battle, helping Darmanitan take them out easier. Mega Charizard Y and Darmanitan work amazingly as an offensive core due to both having ridiculous offensive stats, and Mega Charizard Y's sun increases the power of the already ridiculously strong Flare Blitz. Mega Charizard Y also helps clear out Rock- and Water-types due to its access to Solar Beam, which makes Darmanitan even better as a late-game sweeper, and is immune to Ground-type moves, which Darmanitan is weak to and doesn't want to stay in against. Infernape has great Fighting-type STAB moves, which helps with Normal-type walls, such as Porygon2 and Chansey, as well as Rock-types, letting Darmanitan use Earthquake as its coverage move. Infernape can also be used as an offensive Stealth Rock setter. Entei heavily weakens the opposing team due to its great coverage, and tt also has access to Extreme Speed, which can KO weakened Pokemon. Furthermore, Entei running Iron Head helps deal with Fairy-types, as most of them have high HP stats, which causes Darmanitan to be worn down by Flare Blitz recoil and prevents it from freely spamming the move. Victini and Darmanitan can also be used together with one weakening the opposing team through its STAB attacks and the other cleaning up late-game. They both also create a nice VoltTurn core, as they can pivot easily due to their ability to force switches. Volcanion is immune to Water-type attacks, which Darmanitan is weak to. It can also burn opposing Pokemon through Steam Eruption, allowing Darmanitan to clean up. Choice Scarf Chandelure is another good offensive partner, as it OHKOes Slowbro with Shadow Ball after Stealth Rock damage. It also has access to Energy Ball and Hidden Power Ice, which can scare off the Ground- and Dragon-types that Darmanitan usually has problems with.</p>"

  "Alomomola": {
    "overview": "<p>Alomomola is a premier Wish passer on Water thanks to its many great qualities. Firstly, its gargantuan HP stat allows it to pass gigantic Wishes. Secondly, its decent physical bulk allows it to take on physical attackers such as Azumarill, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Pinsir, all of which fail to OHKO it. Thirdly, its ability Regenerator further complements its role as a Wish passer and lets it frequently switch in and out of the battle. Moreover, its pure Water typing doesn't add any new weaknesses to your team. It can also take on special attackers by taking advantage of its high HP stat in tandem with Mirror Coat, notably taking a Solar Beam from Mega Charizard Y and OHKOing back. Finally, it has access to an extremely useful move in Knock Off, which only a few Water-types have access to.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Alomomola's poor Special Attack means that its damage output is pathetic. In addition, while its HP stat is great, its Special Defense is rather dreadful. Its Speed is also rather subpar. Setup sweepers like Nasty Plot Thundurus can easily take advantage of Alomomola when it passes Wishes. Alomomola also heavily relies on Scald burns to actually threaten a foe and force it out. Finally, it is shut down by Taunt and is inclined to then switch out or deal poor damage with Scald.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Alomomola doesn't really have any notable options due to being a fairly one-sided and bland Pokemon, and it cannot carry out any role apart from a Wish passer.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Toxic Poison</strong>: Toxic poison is the most notable method of wearing down Alomomola, as the accumulating damage necessitates its switching out and this can often give the opponent a free turn to switch to a threat or set up.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Burns and entry hazards hamper the HP recovery from Regenerator, wearing down Alomomola and forcing it to switch out to regain health, disrupting a lot of momentum.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Special setup sweepers such as Thundurus, Serperior, and Substitute + Calm Mind Raikou can easily take advantage of Alomomola's passiveness, set up, and sweep its team. They also hit it on its subpar Special Defense stat. Physical setup sweepers such as Bisharp must be wary of potential Scald burns but are threatening nonetheless.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Magnezone, Raikou, Thundurus, Zapdos, and Mega Ampharos all OHKO Alomomola with their STAB moves, while Rotom-W can use Volt Switch to pivot out. Rotom-W can also burn Alomomola with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Alomomola does pathetic damage to Grass-types, while they can easily 2HKO it with their STAB moves. For example, Mega Venusaur 2HKOes Alomomola with Giga Drain. Breloom can put Alomomola to sleep, set up, and sweep its team. Serperior can also set up with Contrary Leaf Storm. Finally, Whimsicott can lock Alomomola into Wish or Protect with its Prankster Encore and then use Giga Drain to steal its HP.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Mandibuzz, Sableye, Mew, and Froslass are all faster than Alomomola and can immediately Taunt it, preventing it from using Wish or Protect. Mandibuzz can simply phaze Alomomola, Sableye can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp, Mew's Synchronize will burn Alomomola if it is burned, and Froslass can proceed to use Alomomola as entry hazard fodder, though it hates taking Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Alomomola can do absolutely nothing to Pokemon behind a Substitute such as Hoopa-U and Mega Gardevoir. Special attackers behind Substitute won't have to worry about Mirror Coat hitting them back.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "WishPass": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Although it's weak, Scald deals a bit of chip damage to the foe and potentially spreads burns that Alomomola can utilize by taking the opportunity to set up a Wish. Wish allows Alomomola to restore the HP of one of your Pokemon and works well with Protect, which allows Alomomola to regain a bit of Leftovers recovery, scout for the foe's item, stop High Jump Kick users such as Hawlucha and Mega Lopunny, and receive its own Wish when necessary. Mirror Coat lets Alomomola strike special attackers back with a twice-as-powerful move if it tanks their hit. Knock Off is an alternative to remove items like Eviolite, Leftovers, and Choice items from their holders, as well as deal a bit of chip damage. Toxic is another alternative that can be used to wear down walls; it is also Alomomola's only way of beating said walls.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given spread allows Alomomola to survive not only a Solar Beam from Mega Charizard Y but also a Giga Drain from Mega Venusaur, both of them then being OHKOed by Mirror Coat. A Bold nature provides Alomomola with a bit of defensive bulk. Regenerator makes Alomomola a better Wish passer, allowing it to switch in and out many times during the battle; this is further boosted by Leftovers, which provides Alomomola with gradual recovery. Rocky Helmet is an alternative item to punish physical attackers such as Choice Scarf Terrakion and Mega Lopunny by wearing them down.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Alomomola should almost always use Wish to heal a teammate that lacks recovery whenever it's on the field and then switch immediately to them. Spreading burns helps wear down the opposing team and force switches, creating opportunities to pass Wishes. Alomomola's main focus is to tank a hit and then immediately Wish and switch to a teammate. Furthermore, switching Alomomola in and out helps keep its HP as high as possible, though this tends to drain a lot of momentum. Keep Alomomola away from strong special attackers like Thundurus due to its poor Special Defense. Moreover, be wary of status ailments, most importantly Toxic poison, which wears it down a lot. Keep it away from Substitute-using setup sweepers that will use it as setup bait. Alomomola can otherwise switch into attacks pretty safely, use Protect, or just recover up while scouting what the foe does.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Alomomola fits on stall and balance teams only due to its passiveness. Teammates that are able to use Toxic if it isn't running it are appreciated. Lanturn and Swampert are both good partners due to their Electric immunity. Lanturn also has Heal Bell to rid Alomomola of status and has a slow Volt Switch to safely bring it in. Swampert has Stealth Rock to wear down the foe. Tentacruel is able to take on Grass-types thanks to its Poison typing, provides Rapid Spin support to stop Alomomola from being worn down, and has Toxic Spikes to slowly wear down the foe. Sap Sipper Azumarill is a good partner that switches into the Grass-types Alomomola hates. It is also a counter to Mega Charizard Y, allowing Alomomola to run a utility move other than Mirror Coat. Empoleon provides Stealth Rock and Defog support and often runs specially defensive spreads, meaning it can switch into special attacks for Alomomola, and it also appreciates Wish.</p> <p>Many Pokemon pair well with Alomomola due to its ability to pass Wishes. Rotom-W spreads burns with Will-O-Wisp and can use Volt Switch to slowly bring Alomomola in. Starmie can remove hazards with Rapid Spin, while Quagsire can counter setup sweepers with Unaware. Azumarill, Mega Sharpedo, Manaphy, Volcanion, and Mega Gyarados all appreciate the HP restoration granted by Wish. Manaphy also works as a good stallbreaker with Rain Dance + Toxic if Alomomola doesn't run Toxic.</p>"

  "Galvantula": {
    "overview": "<h3>Bug</h3> <p>As one of the few Pokemon with access to Sticky Web, Galvantula establishes its position on Bug-type teams in the Monotype metagame. It has great Speed to help it set up Sticky Web, as well as a great ability in Compound Eyes to boost Thunder's accuracy, which makes it somewhat of an offensive threat as well. Galvantula can also threaten Ground-type Pokemon, such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon, and Water-type Pokemon, such as Swampert and Lanturn, with Energy Ball and Giga Drain. Although it can pivot with Volt Switch, its high Speed doesn't help bring its teammates in safely, and it doesn't force switches either to create momentum. Galvantula also has terrible defensive stats, meaning it does not like staying in against offensive Pokemon. In spite of its decent coverage moves, Galvantula's poor Special Attack means none of them are actually going to do much damage. Lastly, Galvantula faces competition from Shuckle as a Sticky Web setter, which has further access to Stealth Rock and is able to set up entry hazards multiple times in a battle because it's far more defensive. However, Galvantula is the superior offensive option, although since its only niche is being a Sticky Web user, it is very predictable.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Bug</h4> <p>Life Orb can be used over Focus Sash to increase Galvantula's Special Attack, but Galvantula might not get up Sticky Web against faster Pokemon if used. Giga Drain is an alternative to Energy Ball as a Grass-type coverage move, but it is weaker and Galvantula is unlikely to actually be able to use the paltry healing with its awful defenses.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Bug</h4> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos can easily tank all of Galvantula's attacks and even Defog away its Sticky Web. Zapdos can then use Heat Wave to KO it or Toxic to wear it down.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Excadrill, Hippowdon, and Swampert are great checks to Galvantula that lack Energy Ball, as Bug Buzz does very little and Hidden Power Ice generally does even less.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, Mega Venusaur, Lanturn, and Clefable can all take any of Galvantula's attacks and KO it afterwards with their respective moves.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: If Galvantula's Focus Sash is broken at any point, a fast revenge killer such as Choice Scarf Terrakion, Tornadus-T, or Weavile can KO it. Mega Lopunny in particular can stop Galvantula in its tracks even with a Focus Sash with Fake Out + Return.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Any form of entry hazards breaks Galvantula's Focus Sash and makes it vulnerable to faster Pokemon and priority moves. Sand Stream from Tyranitar and Hippowdon can nullify its Focus Sash, and they can both KO after with their respective STAB moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sticky Web (Bug)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sticky Web reduces the Speed of grounded foes. Thunder is Galvantula's main STAB move and strongest attack, as its accuracy is boosted by Compound Eyes, and it has a good chance to paralyze the foe. It is also the only way it's really going to deal any meaningful damage. Bug Buzz is used to beat Dark- and Psychic-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Hydreigon, and Mew. It is also Galvantula's most reliable move, as it has perfect accuracy. Hidden Power Ice is used to hit Dragon-type Pokemon such as Garchomp and Dragonite and Ground-type Pokemon such as Landorus and Gliscor super effectively. Energy Ball lets Galvantula hit Ground-type Pokemon like Swampert, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon, which are immune to Thunder and take little to no damage from Hidden Power Ice. Volt Switch can be used to pivot and gain momentum, although its damage is awful and Galvantula is generally just a bad Volt Switch user due to its high Speed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature with maximum Speed EVs is used to make Galvantula as fast as it can possibly be and Speed tie with other base 108 Speed Pokemon such as Infernape and Cobalion. Maximum Special Attack investment boosts its average Special Attack as much as possible without a boosting nature. Compound Eyes is used to increase Thunder's accuracy. Focus Sash allows Galvantula to always get up Sticky Web, if used as a lead.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Galvantula should be sent out as soon as possible to set up Sticky Web to reduce the Speed of opposing foes, although it needs to be careful of Fake Out anti-leads, such as Mega Lopunny, and Taunt users, such as Infernape. Galvantula is especially good against Water-type teams, as most Water-types struggle to check the offensive threats on Bug-type teams, such as Mega Pinsir and Mega Heracross, with their Speed reduced. Galvantula can also dent Water-type teams with Thunder and Energy Ball, if it is running it. Its coverage options should generally only be used on weakened foes, as Galvantula lacks the power to actually take most of them out. Galvantula can often fish for paralysis with Thunder, as it has a good chance of paralyzing the foe. As it is running a Focus Sash, it should not be sent out with entry hazards on the field. Galvantula can revenge kill somewhat decently thanks to its powerful Thunder and its good Speed. Due to it having below average defensive stats, most of the time, Galvantula will not be able to take more than one non-super effective hit, so it is better to switch out against faster offensive foes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Most Bug-type Pokemon appreciate Galvantula's ability to set up Sticky Web. Forretress and Galvantula work great together as an entry hazard-stacking duo. Forretress can set up Stealth Rock and Spikes while being able to Rapid Spin away opposing entry hazards for Galvantula. Armaldo can also Rapid Spin and set up its own Stealth Rock, and it can beat Pokemon like Zapdos on Flying-type teams thanks to its Rock-type STAB. Mega Heracross greatly appreciates Galvantula's Sticky Web, as it has below-average Speed. Sticky Web lets Mega Heracross outspeed most grounded foes and KO them with its moves. Galvantula and Mega Heracross work greatly together to beat Water-type teams if they are running Thunder and Bullet Seed, respectively. Mega Pinsir is another Mega Evolution that appreciates Galvantula's Sticky Web. With this, Mega Pinsir can outspeed Choice Scarf base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Victini, which is problematic for Bug-type teams. Volcarona also likes having Sticky Web support from Galvantula. After a Sticky Web, Volcarona outspeeds most grounded Pokemon and can run a more bulky EV spread. Mega Scizor and Galvantula can be used together as a VoltTurn core if Galvantula is running Volt Switch. Scizor can also find good opportunities to bring in Galvantula safely. It is able to take advantage of Sticky Web to sweep teams. It's also a counter to Mega Diancie, which can be difficult for Galvantula to play around due to its Magic Bounce.</p>"

Calm Mind lets it muscle past bulky Pokemon like Heatran and Porygon2. Unfortunately, Chandelure's Fire typing and poor bulk cause it to be worn down constantly, which is made worse by Ghost teams' lack of viable entry hazard removal.

Spooky Plate helps it break through Fire-resistant defensive Pokemon like Heatran and Tentacruel. Leftovers alternatively gives Chandelure passive recovery behind Substitute, improving its overall longevity. Flash Fire allows it to check Fire-types like Mega Charizard Y and Victini. Avoid repeatedly switching into entry hazards, notably Stealth Rock, as it wears down Chandelure to a great extent. Chandelure should utilize Substitute to play mindgames with Bisharp to avoid being revenge killed by Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Golurk sets Stealth Rock to chip foes, break Focus Sash from Pokemon like Breloom, and break Dragonite's Multiscale, allowing Chandelure to pick up KOs more easily. It can also get rid of threatening Rock-types like Tyranitar and Terrakion with Earthquake and support Chandelure in beating Steel-types with its coverage moves. In return, Chandelure can get rid of Ice- and Grass-types that Golurk is unable to deal with, like Avalugg and Mega Venusaur. Choice Scarf Gengar serves as a Ground immunity and revenge kills faster threats to Chandelure like Mega Diancie and Mega Lopunny. Chandelure notably forms a Fire / Water / Grass core with Jellicent and Gourgeist-XL so each can handle the others' weaknesses. Jellicent takes on offensive Water-types, while Gourgeist beats Water- and Ground-types, most notably being able to take a hit from Mega Sharpedo and Mega Gyarados and retaliate with Power Whip. Sableye can prevent entry hazards from going up with Taunt and cripple physical attackers like Bisharp and Excadrill with Will-O-Wisp. Furthermore, Sableye can remove items like Eviolite from Porygon2 and Chansey and Leftovers with Knock Off to assist Chandelure in beating defensive Pokemon. Doublade is an option to beat Dark- and Rock-types that can KO Chandelure, like Bisharp and Tyranitar, with Sacred Sword.</p>"

  "Bisharp": {
    "overview": "<h3>Dark</h3> <p>Bisharp is a threatening Pokemon in the ORAS Monotype metagame due to the buffing of Knock Off, its strongest STAB move, priority with Sucker Punch, its strong STAB Iron Head, and its access to Swords Dance, which creates potential sweeps. Its Dark / Steel typing allows Dark teams to apply offensive pressure on Fairy-types, which are extremely threatening due to the lack of switch-ins. Bisharp should be run on Dark teams because of the favorable matchup it grants versus many common types, threatening nearly every type barring Fighting. Bisharp is a useless Pokemon in the Fighting matchup because its STAB priority is not very effective and all the commonly run Fighting-type Pokemon outspeed Bisharp easily. However, this minor setback does not decrease Bisharp's viability because of the usefulness it has in the Fairy matchup.</p> <h3>Steel</h3> <p>Bisharp is a physical attacker with a high base Attack stat that it can boost further with Swords Dance. By using its offensive presence to pressure the opponent into switching, it gains many opportunities to set up. It also has STAB Knock Off, which allows it to beat Pokemon like Porygon2, and Sucker Punch, which gives it powerful priority. Furthermore, Bisharp's great ability in Defiant discourages the use of stat-lowering moves and abilities like Defog and Intimidate. This trait allows it to work well on both hyper offense and balanced teams. However, it has weaknesses to Fighting, Ground, and Fire, and all are common coverage in Monotype. It is also useless against Fighting-types, as they all resist Sucker Punch and will outspeed Bisharp otherwise. Bisharp also has poor Special Defense and Speed, and Sucker Punch is somewhat unreliable.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Dark</h4> <p>Bisharp can run Pursuit over Swords Dance; however, that takes away its sweeping capabilities and is not as helpful for Dark teams, only allowing you to Pursuit trap a Gardevoir or Victini if played correctly. Low Kick is another option over Swords Dance that Bisharp can use to hit Pokemon like Mega Gyarados or bulkier Steel-types. A lead set with Focus Sash and Stealth Rock is an option if you need to take the burden off of Tyranitar or feel like getting rid of Tyranitar completely. Thunder Wave is used to cripple leads, Stealth Rock improves poor matchups, Knock Off is Bisharp's strongest STAB move, and Iron Head helps versus Fairy-types. This set should only be used if your team lacks a Stealth Rock setter.</p> <h4>Steel</h4> <p>Pursuit can also be used to trap threatening Ghost- and Psychic-types. Psycho Cut can be used to hit the Fighting-types that Bisharp lures in, although most will outspeed and KO Bisharp anyway. Low Kick can be used for Mega Gyarados and opposing Bisharp. Using Focus Sash and Stealth Rock might seem like a good idea for a suicide lead, but it is outclassed as a Stealth Rock user by Pokemon such as Skarmory and Heatran, and Bisharp is more suited to offensive roles anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Dark</h4> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Pokemon like Cobalion resist both of Bisharp's STAB types, so they are able to reliably switch into it and can retaliate with a Fighting move. Pokemon like Terrakion and Heracross outspeed and OHKO it, but they cannot switch into Iron Head.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: While Bisharp's STAB Iron Head is extremely threatening to Fairy-types, faster Pokemon like Mega Diancie and Togekiss resist Bisharp's priority and can OHKO it back. Fairy-types are unable to reliably switch in to Bisharp's STAB Iron Head without taking lots of damage.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Most Fire-type Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y and Rotom-H can survive a Sucker Punch without investment and knock out Bisharp in one hit. Pokemon like Infernape and Torkoal are able to survive any hit from Bisharp and OHKO it back.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-type Pokemon like Excadrill and Landorus easily force out unboosted Bisharp, as they can survive any hit and outspeed and KO it. A few Pokemon like Hippowdon and Mega Camerupt can easily switch into a Knock Off and check Bisharp.</p> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Pokemon like Mega Gardevoir that run Substitute can surprise Bisharp by revealing the move or force Bisharp into mind games if Substitute has already been revealed.</p> <h4>Steel</h4> <p><strong>Burns</strong>: Burns can cripple Life Orb sets, and repeated burns can still cripple Lum Berry sets.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Infernape can easily switch into Bisharp and force it out or KO it.</p> <p><strong>Mega Evolutions</strong>: Mega Pokemon such as Mega Swampert and Mega Garchomp take less damage from Knock Off and little damage from Sucker Punch and Iron Head, and both OHKO back.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Alomomola and Gastrodon resist Iron Head and can fish for burns with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Quagsire</strong>: Quagsire walls Bisharp because of Unaware, which allows it to ignore Bisharp's Attack boosts, and takes negligible damage from Iron Head and Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Gliscor, and Gastrodon wall Bisharp because it is unable to do enough damage to them to KO and is outstalled or knocked out by them.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Dark-types</strong>: Offensive Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Weavile resist Sucker Punch and can easily revenge kill Bisharp.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance (Dark)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Bisharp to potentially set up on a predicted switch and sweep. Knock Off is Bisharp's strongest STAB move against Pokemon that hold an item due to the 1.5x boost. Sucker Punch is Bisharp's only priority move and is extremely powerful with 80 base power and STAB. Sucker Punch and Swords Dance coupled together can create many sweeping opportunities. Bisharp's final move, Iron Head, is a nice STAB move used in order to threaten Fairy-types, which have the advantage versus Dark-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature, maximum Attack, and maximum Speed are necessary for Bisharp to hit as hard as possible and to outpace as many walls as possible, such as bulky Landorus-T and Mandibuzz. Jolly can be used to outspeed Adamant threats such as Dragonite and Diggersby. Defiant makes Bisharp especially threatening for teams weak to hazards, such as Flying teams, as it raises Bisharp's Attack by two stages should the opponent choose to Defog. Defiant also scares away Bug and Rock teams from using Sticky Web because they do not want to give Bisharp automatic boosts in Attack. Lum Berry provides more sweeping opportunities, as it allows Bisharp to take a potential status from a Pokemon such as Sableye or Mew. However, Life Orb is another viable option for immediate powerful damage. Lum Berry is generally run over Life Orb because people would rather trade immediate damage for more setup opportunities. However, if you decide to run Lum Berry, note that Bisharp misses out on possible KOs against Pokemon like Mega Gardevoir and frail offensive attackers such as Thundurus after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bisharp is generally not used as a switch-in to many attacks due to its frail defenses and low HP stat. However, if played correctly, Bisharp can switch into a Defog and activate Defiant, raising its Attack by two stages and creating an enormous threat. Bisharp is a solid revenge killer due to its priority Sucker Punch. Generally, when playing Bisharp, try to apply pressure and force the foe out, allowing Bisharp to set up with Swords Dance if possible. Bisharp creates many mind games with Sucker Punch. If not used to revenge kill, Bisharp should be used late-game in order to weaken actual counters or threats, setting up the sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dark-type hazard setters like Tyranitar and Krookodile are nice options because they can bait in the Defog. Mandibuzz is one of the best partners for Bisharp because it has the ability to cover 2 major weaknesses to Bisharp, Ground and Fighting. Sableye is recommended because it is immune to Fighting moves and can use Taunt and Knock Off to defeat defensive Pokemon Bisharp has trouble with, such as Hippowdon. Pokemon that revenge kill or clean like Hydreigon, Weavile, Crawdaunt, and Sharpedo are also recommended. Physical wallbreakers such as Crawdaunt and Weavile break down similar threats for each other while Hydreigon is able to check Steel-types alongside Bisharp.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance (Steel)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Bisharp's Attack to incredibly high levels and allows it to break through walls. Knock Off is a powerful STAB move that has the added benefit of removing items. Sucker Punch is a powerful but sometimes unreliable priority move that makes up for Bisharp's low Speed stat. Iron Head is a powerful secondary STAB move that is useful for dealing more damage to Mega Evolutions, which don't take 1.5x damage from Knock Off, and has a decent flinch chance.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature is used to maximize Bisharp's Attack and is preferred because it allows Bisharp to OHKO threats to it such as Zapdos at +2, even without a Life Orb. Life Orb is used for more power and allows it to OHKO offensive Heatran at +2, though Lum Berry can be used to cure status and allow Bisharp to set up on status spreaders such as Mew. Defiant discourages the use of Defog and Sticky Web, and it boosts Bisharp's Attack if any of its stats are lowered. Black Glasses and Dread Plate are other options that boost the power of Knock Off and Sucker Punch without Life Orb's recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bisharp has many opportunities to get to +2, such as switching in when you expect Defog to be used or when Sticky Web is on your side of the field. Swords Dance can be used on Pokemon that are threatened out or can't touch Bisharp, such as Chansey and Choice-locked Pokemon. If an opposing Pokemon can inflict burns, use the turn you predict your opponent to try to burn your Pokemon to bring Bisharp in, cure the burn with the Lum Berry, and KO the opposing Pokemon right away, or else Bisharp will be crippled for the rest of the game. Bisharp is best used to sweep late-game with Sucker Punch. However, it can also be used as an early-game wallbreaker with Knock Off, which has the added benefit of weakening Pokemon by removing their item. Bisharp can also revenge kill foes with Sucker Punch, but you must be wary of status and Substitute users, as well as of other 50/50 scenarios such as guessing whether your opponent will switch or not.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Doublade is immune to Fighting and completes an entry hazard preservation core with Bisharp by utilizing Ghost typing and Defiant. Choice Scarf Magnezone forces out the Water-types that wall Bisharp, like Mega Gyarados, and it also traps the Steel-types that could also wall Bisharp, like Skarmory and Ferrothorn. Jirachi is neutral to Fighting-type attacks and also has Healing Wish to heal Bisharp for late-game sweeps, which allows it to be more reckless early-game. Heatran is immune to Fire-type moves and therefore can switch into Fire-type attacks or Will-O-Wisp. Swords Dance Mega Scizor shares similar checks with Bisharp; one can weaken them for the other to sweep. Nasty Plot Lucario is one of the few special setup sweepers on Steel and can set up on Bisharp's defensive checks. Skarmory has an immunity to Ground-type attacks and can set entry hazards, which pressure the opponent into using Defog. Ferrothorn also sets hazards to force the opponent to use Defog and has a nice Water resistance and Ground neutrality. Choice Scarf Excadrill helps eliminate the Fire- and Electric-type Pokemon that might threaten or wall Bisharp.</p>"

  "Mandibuzz": {
    "overview": "<h3>Dark</h3> <p>With its high base Defense and HP combined with its secondary typing in Flying that lets it take neutral damage from Bug- and Fighting-type attacks, Mandibuzz is one of the most important Pokemon on Dark teams. Its ability in Overcoat makes it immune to not only residual damage from weather but also powder moves such as Spore, letting it check Breloom, a significant threat to Dark teams. Mandibuzz has access to great utility moves such as Taunt, Defog, and Foul Play, making it the only viable hazard remover and premium physical wall for Dark teams. However, even though Mandibuzz helps against Bug- and Fighting-types, it still suffers a weakness to Fairy-types, which gives it a hard time when accomplishing its role. Additionally, its secondary typing in Flying gives it a weakness to Ice-, Electric-, and Rock-types, making it unable to keep on switching into Stealth Rock a lot of the time, thus hindering its role.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Dark</h4> <p>A spread of 248 HP / 136 Def / 108 SpD / 16 Spe is also usable on Mandibuzz, making it a great mixed wall and switch-in to Landorus, as its Focus Blast doesn't Mandibuzz without Stealth Rock support. Whirlwind and U-turn are both underrated moves on Mandibuzz but can be used; the former lets it phaze setup Pokemon, while the latter is used to grab momentum on a predicted switch-in.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Dark</h4> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types, such as Mega Gardevoir and Mega Diancie, can hit Mandibuzz super effectively and KO it easily.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types, such as Weavile and Kyurem-B, are able to hinder Mandibuzz easily, as they are blessed with high attacking stats and hard-hitting STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Terrakion and Tyranitar in particular both resist Foul Play, and the former utilizes it to boost its Attack with Justified, while the latter can take advantage of this by setting Stealth Rock. However, slower Rock-types can be checked due to Roost, which removes Mandibuzz's Flying typing.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Most Electric-types are special attackers like Zapdos and Mega Ampharos, which means that they take little damage from Foul Play and can retaliate with their super effective STAB moves. Electric-type physical attackers have to be wary of Foul Play though.</p> <p><strong>Manaphy</strong>: Manaphy is a specially oriented Pokemon that makes great use of Tail Glow and its coverage moves such as Ice Beam. Even if it doesn't have Ice Beam, Scald is enough to take down Mandibuzz.</p> <p><strong>Mega Heracross</strong>: Mega Heracross has coverage in Rock Blast, which hits Mandibuzz super effectively, and high-Base Power physical attacks that still handle Mandibuzz without Rock Blast.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive (Dark)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Foul Play is one of the most important moves Mandibuzz needs to fulfill its role as a physical wall. With it, Mandibuzz is able to stop physical setup sweepers and attackers in general, allowing it to check a lot of threats such as Mega Scizor, Mega Gallade, Mega Swampert, and Gyarados, all of which can otherwise easily punch holes in Dark teams. Roost allows Mandibuzz to replenish its health, increasing its longevity on the field. Thanks to Defog, Mandibuzz is the only viable hazard remover on Dark teams. Brave Bird deals super effective damage to Fighting- and Bug-types, most notably Breloom and Mega Lopunny, all of which are huge threats to Dark teams. Taunt is another good move for Mandibuzz, which, combined with its great Speed stat for a defensive Pokemon, lets it stop slower, bulkier Pokemon from using a status move, healing, or setting entry hazards. Toxic is another alternative that allows Mandibuzz to deal more damage to specially defensive Pokemon that Foul Play doesn't hurt, as well as making Mandibuzz annoying for bulkier types such as Water.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP and 244 Defense EVs as well as a Bold nature maximize Mandibuzz's bulk, enabling it to check physical Pokemon better, while 16 EVs in Speed allow it to check maximum Speed Belly Drum Azumarill and 2HKO it with Foul Play. Rocky Helmet punishes Pokemon that use a contact move such as Mega Lopunny and Heracross, both of which are big threats to Dark teams, easing its job in checking them. Leftovers can be used instead of Rocky Helmet if you wish to opt for passive recovery and not residual damage on contact move users. Overcoat blocks weather damage, allowing Mandibuzz to be a great partner for Tyranitar. Overcoat also blocks powder moves, most notably Spore from Breloom, one of the most threatening Pokemon for Dark teams.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mandibuzz's primary role is to sponge physical attacks, so switch it in on physical attackers often trying to boost. Don't recklessly use it when in the presence of Bug- and Fighting-type threats, such as Heracross, Mega Scizor, Mega Pinsir, and Breloom, because Mandibuzz is one of the only ways of checking them. Play carefully around entry hazards, since Mandibuzz is weak to Stealth Rock, which hinders its capabilities if it is constantly switching in and out. It also hates status conditions, so avoid them at all costs, since they cripple Mandibuzz.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mandibuzz's high physically defensive capabilities can fall short against specially offensive Pokemon; this is why Tyranitar is a great partner, as it is able to sponge special attacks directed towards Mandibuzz and can set Stealth Rock, pressuring opposing Pokemon. Mandibuzz is weak to Ice-, Rock-, and Fairy-types, so Bisharp can be paired with it, as it can effectively take on such Pokemon. Hoopa-U is another Pokemon that fits well with Mandibuzz, as thanks to Hoopa-U's good Special Defense, it can take some special attacks but shouldn't be switched often into them. It is also capable of defeating Fighting- and Fairy-types, which eases Mandibuzz's job.</p>"

  "Volcarona": {
    "overview": "<h3>Fire</h3> <p>Quiver Dance Volcarona is a phenomenal setup sweeper for Fire teams thanks to its great natural special bulk and ability to take on Psychic teams with ease. Its STAB combination and coverage options threaten Water-type defensive cores as well. While Volcarona is blessed with phenomenal special bulk, its physical bulk is rather lackluster and makes it rather hard to time a Quiver Dance sweep properly, often forcing Volcarona to rely on its Focus Sash. While its Bug typing does help Fire teams in the Psychic matchup, it stacks the type's natural weakness to Rock-type attacks and Stealth Rock.</p> <h3>Bug</h3> <p>Volcarona is the premier option for a setup sweeper on Bug teams, with access to Quiver Dance to boost three of its already high stats to higher levels, a great offensive typing, a great movepool that helps it patch up its most of its weaknesses, and reliable recovery in Roost. Volcarona can pick apart Steel teams, which are a huge threat to Bug-types, especially if it runs Hidden Power Ground. It also serves as a great wincon against Psychic and Water teams if Bug Buzz and Giga Drain, respectively, are run. Its great base 100 Speed tier allows it to outspeed troublesome Choice Scarf users such as Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Heracross after one boost. Volcarona is a very frail Pokemon physically, however. Therefore, it can be easily revenge killed by priority moves such as Sucker Punch, Extreme Speed, and Aqua Jet; however, Volcarona's ability Flame Body can punish physical attackers that try to revenge kill it. Volcarona suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, as it cannot run all the coverage moves it wants to alongside Quiver Dance. Its huge 4x weakness to Stealth Rock severely hinders its sweeping capabilities.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Fire</h4> <p>Lum Berry can be used over Focus Sash to have a better matchup against Pokemon that spread status such as Thunder Wave Jirachi and Toxic Mandibuzz.</p> <h4>Bug</h4> <p>Hidden Power Ice is an interesting coverage option that can allow Volcarona to lure in and KO Pokemon like Dragonite and Mega Garchomp, which would otherwise take at least one hit from a +1 Volcarona and retaliate with a strong physical attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Fire</h4> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock is Volcarona's greatest weakness, taking half of its health and effectively making its Focus Sash useless.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Physical attackers such as Victini, Mega Diancie, Dragonite, and Mega Garchomp threaten to OHKO Volcarona with their STAB attacks, with little it can do in return. However, all of them bar Dragonite can be defeated with enough Quiver Dance boosts.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Heatran completely walls Volcarona without Hidden Power Ground, stopping it from sweeping Steel-type teams.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Chansey is able to take any attack from Volcarona, even after multiple Quiver Dance boosts, and retaliate with Toxic. Bulky Mega Tyranitar and Piloswine can check Volcarona with Stone Edge and Rock Slide, and Mega Tyranitar's Sand Stream also breaks Volcarona's Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks</strong>: While Volcarona's special bulk is impressive, it still has trouble dealing with super effective attacks such as Tornadus-T's Hurricane.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster revenge killers such as Excadrill in sand, Kingdra in rain, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Weavile are able to easily take care of Volcarona. It can also be easily picked off by priority attacks such as Azumarill's Aqua Jet, Dragonite's Extreme Speed, and Bisharp's Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Bug</h4> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Volcarona's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock severely hinders its offensive capabilities, making it more easily revenge killed by common priority moves.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can easily wall a boosted Volcarona and can proceed to cripple it with Thunder Wave or Toxic while repeatedly using Soft-Boiled.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: All variants of Heatran, whether an offensive set with Stone Edge or a defensive set with Toxic, can wall all Volcarona sets that lack Hidden Power Ground.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster threats such as Choice Scarf Victini, Choice Scarf Terrakion, and Swift Swim Kingdra can easily revenge kill a Volcarona at +1. Priority users such as Bisharp, Dragonite, and Mega Pinsir can also revenge kill Volcarona, but only after prior damage. Azumarill does not require any chip damage to OHKO offensive Volcarona with Aqua Jet. However, the defensive set does not fear Bisharp.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Most special walls, like Chansey and Zapdos can easily tank Volcarona's attacks and retaliate with status.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Both offensive and defensive variants of Volcarona are very weak to status, even with the former having a Lum Berry. Thunder Wave can permanently put a stop to its sweep, and Toxic decreases its already poor longevity by putting it on a timer.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-type Pokemon like Cradily and Tyranitar can easily take a Giga Drain and OHKO back with a Rock-type STAB move. If Volcarona lacks Giga Drain, Pokemon like Mega Diancie, Rhyperior, and even Omastar can check it.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Volcarona generally needs to get to +2 in order to check Water-type Pokemon. This makes Pokemon like Manaphy, Volcanion, and Tentacruel great checks to it.</p>",

Giga Drain targets Water- and Ground-types such as Rotom-W, Swampert, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon. Swarm makes Bug Buzz stronger in a pinch, OHKOing Victini after a Quiver Dance boost. Focus Sash allows Volcarona to safely set up Quiver Dance against physical attackers such as Victini while also activating Swarm. Maximum Speed allows Volcarona to Speed tie with threats such as Choice Band Victini and outspeed Choice Specs Latios and Tornadus-T after Quiver Dance.</p> <p>Mega Charizard Y can help Volcarona in the Steel matchup by beating Heatran with Focus Blast, assists against Water-types such as Swampert with Solar Beam, preserves Focus Sash with Defog, and empowers Volcarona's Fire Blast thanks to Drought.

Choice Scarf Darmanitan is an incredible revenge killer that can OHKO threats such as Landorus with Flare Blitz after chip damage from Stealth Rock. Earthquake allows it to take on Tentacruel and Empoleon on Water teams, giving Giga Drain Volcarona an easier time cleaning. Additionally, Darmanitan can safely bring in Volcarona on a forced switch with U-turn. Infernape is the premier suicide lead on Fire teams. It provides Stealth Rock, which allows Volcarona to break through Flying-types like Zapdos and Tornadus-T with ease, and prevents slower foes such as Swampert from setting entry hazards with Taunt. Close Combat allows Infernape to take care of problematic bulky Normal-, Dark-, and Steel-types such as Chansey, Tyranitar, and Heatran. Heatran can take on Mega Diancie with Flash Cannon and eliminate Chansey through Magma Storm + Taunt. Choice Scarf Victini can revenge kill threats such as Kyurem-B, Landorus, and Tornadus-T and also weaken Water-types such as Empoleon with Bolt Strike. U-turn allows it to safely bring Volcarona in against Swampert or Gastrodon. Victini is also able to remove faster threats such as Mega Garchomp and Mega Diancie with Final Gambit or cripple walls with Trick, which prevents them from disrupting Volcarona's setup.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Quiver Dance boosts Volcarona's Special Attack, Speed, and Special Defense stats to high levels. At +1, Volcarona can outspeed common threats to Bug teams such as Choice Scarf Excadrill. Fire Blast is Volcarona's strongest Fire-type STAB move. It can nab many KOs on Pokemon such as Landorus. Alternatively, Fiery Dance can be run for its better accuracy and chance to raise Volcarona's Special Attack stat. However, it misses out on certain KOs, such as Kyurem-B after Stealth Rock damage, at +1. Bug Buzz is Volcarona's strong secondary STAB move, which is more reliable than Fire Blast due to its better accuracy and PP. It allows Volcarona to act as a wincon against Psychic and Dark teams, targeting threats such as Mega Tyranitar, Latios, and Victini. Giga Drain covers Water- and Rock-types, particularly Mega Diancie. It also gives Volcarona some form of recovery, which this set lacks. Hidden Power Ground allows Volcarona to hit Heatran and deal more damage to Tentacruel and Fire-types like Darmanitan and Infernape.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack is used in order to maximize Volcarona's damage output. Maximum Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow it to outspeed threats such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Choice Scarf Excadrill, and Mega Sharpedo while also Speed tying with Choice Scarf Victini after one boost. Flame Body allows Volcarona to punish physical attackers,  priority users in particular, such as Dragonite, Diggersby, Azumarill, and Bisharp, with a chance to burn them. Volcarona can opt to use Swarm on Focus Sash sets with Bug Buzz to deal more damage to Pokemon like Mega Garchomp and Kingdra. Lum Berry gives Volcarona a free turn of setup against Pokemon that would try to status it such as Jirachi and Slowbro. Focus Sash can be run to guarantee a Quiver Dance boost and get Volcarona into Swarm range; however, it requires reliable entry hazard control, which Bug teams lack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Entry hazard control is key when using Volcarona, especially due to the lack of Roost on this set, hindering its ability to set up. It's best to start setting up with Volcarona mid- or late-game, when its checks have been weakened, because its lack of recovery only allows one chance to attempt a sweep; however, setting up early-game can be considered in some situations, as Volcarona can boost its power up to wallbreaking levels, which helps take out checks earlier. Volcarona's great Special Attack can be used early-game to weaken its checks before actually setting up. Because of Volcarona's bad defenses, it is generally better to bring it in after a fallen teammate rather than directly switching it into an attack. Volcarona can take advantage of defensive Pokemon like Mew and Mega Latias, which do nothing to it, and proceed to set up on them. Lum Berry should be preserved until it is time for Volcarona to sweep. While Lum Berry does cleanse status once, Volcarona needs to be able to take out its foe before it gets the chance to permanently cripple Volcarona, as Pokemon like Zapdos can status it twice.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bug teams rely on Volcarona to deal with physically defensive Pokemon like Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Doublade. Armaldo and Forretress are spinners that can also set Stealth Rock. Thanks to its part-Rock typing and Knock Off, Armaldo can cripple Eviolite users and better deal with Flying-, Fire-, and Bug-types like Zapdos, Victini, and Volcarona. Forretress can provide slot pivot support, switch into Rock-type attacks, and set other entry hazards such as Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Choice Scarf Heracross and Mega Heracross can break through Pokemon like Chansey, Heatran, and Tyranitar. Mega Pinsir can outspeed and OHKO Mega Charizard Y, which walls Volcarona. Yanmega is a nice partner to Volcarona, as, together, they can share coverage moves such as Giga Drain and Bug Buzz and can free each other's moveslots. Galvantula can pressure the opposing side with Sticky Web, allowing Volcarona to outspeed and Speed tie with certain Choice Scarf Pokemon that would normally be used to check it like Choice Scarf Victini. Both regular and Mega Scizor can pivot into a plethora of physical attacks that threaten Volcarona and begin to set up. Their ability to clean up Rock teams is invaluable to Volcarona. Scizor can also find opportunities to bring Volcarona in with U-turn.</p>"

      "Bulky Quiver Dance (Bug)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Quiver Dance boosts Volcarona's Special Attack, Speed, and Special Defense to high levels. Fiery Dance is the STAB move of choice, giving Volcarona a good chance to raise its Special Attack stat whenever it's used. Roost keeps Volcarona healthy and somewhat mitigates Stealth Rock damage. The last slot is generally coverage for what the team needs. Bug Buzz is a strong secondary STAB move that allows Volcarona to check Psychic- and Dark-types while also being able to hit Dragon-type Pokemon. Giga Drain can be run to hit Water-types, especially bulky Water / Ground Pokemon like Swampert and Gastrodon, which could otherwise phaze Volcarona with Roar or status it with Toxic. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ground can be used to deal with Heatran, but its damage output is quite underwhelming, and it is useless in most other matchups.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 EVs in HP maximize Volcarona's bulk and allow it to switch into Stealth Rock twice. 104 EVs in Speed with a Timid nature let it outspeed maximum Speed Mega Gyarados and other threats such as Togekiss. The rest of the EVs are put in Defense, allowing Volcarona to take physical hits much better, such as Aqua Jet from Azumarill and V-create from Choice Scarf Victini. Flame Body is the ability of choice, which can punish physical attackers with a decent chance to burn. Leftovers is the preferred item, which gives Volcarona passive recovery. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 244 Def / 16 Spe with a Timid nature can be run to outspeed base 70s such as Breloom and Bisharp while retaining more bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Entry hazard control is essential when using Volcarona. Its 4x weakness to Stealth Rock is no joke, hindering its ability to switch into weak attacks and its setup sweeping capabilities. Avoid status conditions such as poison and paralysis, which would cripple Volcarona and ruin its sweep. Due to the bulky nature of this set, Volcarona would usually need more than one boost to become a real threat. Therefore, it is recommended that Volcarona set up mid- to late-game when its checks have been weakened. The added bulk along with access to recovery in Roost allows Volcarona to set up on a plethora of Pokemon such as Magnezone and Rock Slide-less Landorus. Volcarona should take care of its health with Roost if it gets used early-game. It usually needs to be able to take at least one hit before it sets up and can start walling special attackers. Even with the extra bulk, it is still recommended to bring in Volcarona safely through a pivot or a fallen teammate.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Forretress is a great switch-in to Rock-type moves that threaten Volcarona while also being able to get rid of entry hazards. Forretress can also set entry hazards of its own, such as Spikes and Stealth Rock, letting Volcarona's checks be slowly whittled. Armaldo can also support Volcarona through hazard control. Yanmega is a great partner to Volcarona, as it can run a variety of coverage moves that this set lacks, such as Air Slash and Hidden Power Ice, while also being able to weaken Volcarona's checks. Mega Heracross can easily break through balanced teams and some of Volcarona's checks such as Zapdos, Chansey, Heatran, and Tyranitar. Choice Scarf Heracross can also deal with Volcarona's defensive checks such as Chansey, Tyranitar, and Heatran. Mega Scizor is a great complement to Volcarona in being able to switch into most Rock-type Pokemon and threaten them out with Bullet Punch. It can also find opportunities to safely bring in Volcarona with U-turn. Regular Scizor is also a good partner in being able to check the same Pokemon that Mega Scizor does but also freeing up a Mega slot. Mega Pinsir assists Volcarona in being able to beat Fighting-types, revenge kill threats with Quick Attack, and deal with Heatran, Chansey, and Tyranitar thanks to its access to Close Combat. Conversely, Mega Pinsir enjoys having Volcarona to deal with Pokemon like Doublade and Skarmory, which otherwise wall it, allowing it to clean up late-game more easily. Having both a special and a physical setup sweeper, such as Volcarona and Mega Scizor or Mega Pinsir, can put tremendous pressure on the opposing side. Galvantula's access to Sticky Web helps Volcarona a lot due to its lower Speed, allowing it to run the bulky spread freely.</p>"

  "Cobalion": {
    "overview": "<h3>Fighting</h3> <p>Cobalion acts as an excellent support, lead, and anti-lead Pokemon on Fighting teams, as it has access to moves such as Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, and Taunt. It hits a great Speed tier with a base Speed of 108, letting it tie with opposing lead Pokemon like Infernape and Galvantula. Its part Steel typing allows it to check Fairy-types, such as Diancie, Gardevoir, and Sylveon, and gives it an immunity to Poison-type moves, which makes it an excellent switch-in to predicted moves such as Toxic. Cobalion also has impressive physical bulk, allowing it to take multiple unresisted hits. Unfortunately, it lacks reasonable offensive stats, being less reliable in dealing a lot of damage. Cobalion's Special Defense isn't that great either, and it can't afford to switch into strong special attackers. It also lacks reliable recovery, shortening its longevity on the field.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Fighting</h4> <p>A mixed Life Orb set with Hidden Power Ice, Stone Edge, and Focus Blast can be used to lure in Pokemon like Gliscor, defensive Landorus-T, Garchomp, Mega Charizard Y, Mega Pinsir, Volcarona, and Quagsire and KO them. An offensive Swords Dance Cobalion variant can also be run, although Fighting has Pokemon that can do the job better, like Swords Dance Mega Gallade and Swords Dance Terrakion. Cobalion can be used as a Calm Mind setup sweeper.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Fighting</h4> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types are immune to Cobalion's Thunder Wave and Volt Switch, limiting its options. Landorus, Gastrodon, Seismitoad, Mamoswine, Excadrill, Hippowdon, and Mega Garchomp can apply pressure on Cobalion with their attacks and KO it with their Ground-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Fast Electric-types such as Thundurus, Galvantula, and Choice Scarf Magnezone aren't threatened by Cobalion's moves and can either set up or KO it safely.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types are not threatened by Cobalion's STAB Iron Head, and Choice Scarf Pokemon like Victini, Darmanitan, and Chandelure can KO it before it sets Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types resist Cobalion's Iron Head and can threaten it with Scald burns. Pokemon like Swampert and Lanturn completely wall Cobalion and can absorb Thunder Wave and Volt Switch too.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users such as Thundurus and Sableye have access to Prankster and can stop Cobalion from using its support moves. Thundurus can use that to its advantage to set up Nasty Plot. Sableye can go for Will-O-Wisp and burn Cobalion or any of its teammates if it switches out. Faster leads like Azelf and Aerodactyl can Taunt Cobalion and set up Stealth Rock.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility (Fighting)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock lets Cobalion pressure the other side of the field by breaking potential Focus Sashes on Pokemon such as Gengar and Breloom and getting chip damage. This offensive pressure is appreciated by an offensive type like Fighting. Iron Head is a STAB move and gives Cobalion coverage against Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir and Mega Diancie, which Fighting teams struggle against. Thunder Wave allows it to cripple faster threats such as Choice Scarf Latios, Kyurem-B, and Hoopa-U. Taunt lets it stop setup sweepers such as Gyarados and Belly Drum Azumarill from setting up, prevents defensive walls such as Porygon2 and Skarmory from recovering, and prevents entry hazards from being set up on your side. Cobalion notably is able to outspeed and Taunt leads like Mew, Skarmory, and Swampert as well as Speed tie with Galvantula to prevent entry hazards from being set up. The move also prevents status from Pokemon like Chansey, Rotom-W, and Mew. Volt Switch can be used to pick up momentum, which is useful on offensive types like Fighting.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>76 Attack EVs are given to OHKO Mega Gardevoir with Iron Head after Stealth Rock. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature is used to maintain Cobalion's fantastic Speed tier, letting it tie with leads such as Galvantula and Infernape while outspeeding Pokemon like Mega Gardevoir and Mew. The rest of the EVs are put into HP, giving Cobalion decent bulk and letting it survive hits such as Hyper Voice from Mega Gardevoir and Earth Power from Mega Diancie. Leftovers is the item of choice, as it increases Cobalion's longevity because it has no access to reliable recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cobalion can be used as a dedicated lead against other leads such as Galvantula, Skarmory, Mew, Forretress, and Tyranitar, which tend to set up entry hazards. Cobalion can keep these Pokemon from using their utility moves, as it's able to outspeed and Taunt them. It can also use that to take advantage of defensive Pokemon with Taunt and Thunder Wave. Cobalion should try to set up Stealth Rock as soon as possible if there is no Pokemon trying to set up entry hazards. It should also try to spread status with Thunder Wave early-game to support its team. Depending on the matchup, this can also be very crucial in paralyzing a threat that tends to switch in to Cobalion to check it. Cobalion should use Volt Switch as a way to gain momentum on predicted switches or any Pokemon that it can't beat such as Zapdos and Mega Charizard Y. Cobalion can be very useful as a pivot because it can switch in and out of attacks, which will be helpful in bringing out its teammates safely. Thunder Wave should be used to cripple faster threats like Choice Scarf Latios, Kyurem-B, and Hoopa-U. Cobalion should stay as healthy as possible in a match in order to check certain threats such as Mega Diancie and Latios; however, it needs to be at full health to do so, so you also should try to keep Cobalion from taking too much damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Terrakion checks the Fire- and Flying-types that threaten Cobalion with its STAB Stone Edge and acts as a great late-game cleaner in general. Breloom pairs well with Cobalion, since it can check bulky Water- and Ground-types like Hippowdon, Gastrodon, Swampert, and Lanturn, as well as spreading status with Spore. It can be considered a dedicated anti-lead in some matchups where leading with Cobalion is unsafe, such as against Flying-type teams with Mega Charizard Y or Landorus-T, Fire-type teams, and Ground-type teams. Heracross has the ability to sweep through Psychic-type teams that Cobalion struggles against with its STAB Megahorn. It also acts as a status absorber for Cobalion with its ability Guts.</p> <p>Hawlucha deals with opposing Fighting-types with its STAB Acrobatics, as well as being able to switch into predicted Ground-type attacks. It appreciates Cobalion's support in Thunder Wave and Stealth Rock letting it set up and sweep easier. Both Mega Medicham and Mega Gallade also pair well with Cobalion; with their powerful Psychic-type STAB attacks, they can check threats like Mega Venusaur as well as opposing Fighting-types. Mega Medicham deserves a special mention due to having priority in Fake Out and Bullet Punch, which lets it pick off weakened Pokemon or check threats such as Mega Diancie and Mega Gardevoir after Fake Out damage. Mega Gallade can sweep unprepared teams with its access to Swords Dance. It can also hit Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon with Knock Off or Shadow Sneak. Infernape is a good partner to Cobalion as well because it has a vast movepool with access to moves like Gunk Shot, Fire Blast, Close Combat, and Grass Knot. Fire Blast and Close Combat give it coverage to beat Steel-types, all of which wall Cobalion, while Grass Knot surprises Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Slowbro and 2HKOes them.</p>"

  "Terrakion": {
    "overview": "<h3>Rock</h3> <p>As one of Rock's most flexible offensive Pokemon, Terrakion provides an invaluable presence on Rock teams and contributes to the success of many teams. Its unique Rock and Fighting STAB combination supplemented by powerful attacks in Close Combat and Stone Edge provides useful coverage and makes it difficult to wall. In particular, Fighting STAB is extremely useful for beating Steel-types, which most of Terrakion's offensive teammates will have trouble breaking through. With base 108 Speed, Terrakion is one of the fastest Rock-types available and effectively takes advantage of this by acting as an ideal wallbreaker and revenge killer. However, Terrakion is still limited in what it can do, as both of its main STAB attacks have drawbacks, and although it provides great STAB coverage, it doesn't add much defensive synergy to the team. Despite this, it has the ability to fit what most Rock teams need and can improve almost any Rock team.</p> <h3>Fighting</h3> <p>With useful STAB coverage, good Speed, and a Flying neutrality, Terrakion fits well on Fighting teams, which tend to be offensively inclined. Terrakion's great Speed tier lets it outspeed most common Choice Scarf Pokemon, most notably Victini and Togekiss. Although it might not have the bulk to take too many hits, Terrakion has enough natural bulk to check Flying-types that the team might struggle with if it needs to and thus eases pressure off its teammates. Mega Pinsir is a great example of this, as Terrakion is Fighting's only real check for it. However, since Terrakion typically holds a Choice Scarf in order to revenge kill Pokemon more easily, it may find itself lacking power against defensive Pokemon, such as Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Gliscor, so it relies on its teammates to help weaken these walls first. Late-game, however, is when Terrakion shines and shows why most Fighting teams don't go without it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Rock</h4> <p>Terrakion can make use of other sets such as Substitute + Swords Dance to dodge debilitating status moves like Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave from Mew and other status users, which Terrakion otherwise loses to. Life Orb is an option because, although weaker than Choice Band, it provides useful, immediate power without locking Terrakion into a move, making it harder for setup sweepers to take advantage of it. It also opens up more options for the final moveslot, such as Taunt. Missing out on the 2HKO against Skarmory is a serious problem, however. A Focus Sash lead set with Taunt and Stealth Rock quickly gets Stealth Rock on the field and usually has enough Speed to Taunt opposing leads before they can act. However, it is best to allow Terrakion to fill other roles, as there are many other better options that can set Stealth Rock, like Aerodactyl and Shuckle, and using it on Terrakion presents a high opportunity cost. Choice Scarf forfeits the immediate power presented by Choice Band, making it harder for Terrakion to break through Skarmory and Hippowdon, and misses out on the OHKO on major threats such as Mega Gardevoir. The higher immediate Speed does allow Terrakion to revenge kill a wider range of Pokemon, though, which is especially useful because Rock Monotype typically lacks fast Pokemon.</p> <h4>Fighting</h4> <p>Life Orb and Choice Band make Terrakion harder to wall, with a decent chance to 2HKO Skarmory after Stealth Rock. With Substitute + Swords Dance, Terrakion could squeak past status users such as Will-O-Wisp Mew and Thunder Wave Porygon2 and easily set up on them. It could also use Salac Berry on this same set, which makes it even more difficult to revenge kill. Taunt + Stealth Rock lets Terrakion use its great Speed to quickly set up Stealth Rock while preventing the opponent from setting their own entry hazards, but teammates such as Infernape and Cobalion pull this off more effectively, and Terrakion would rather keep its Choice item. Using any item other than the Choice Scarf sacrifices Terrakion's ability to check quicker, more dangerous threats, like Tornadus-T and Volcarona. If your team needs a wallbreaker, it is recommended to utilize something else, like Swords Dance Breloom, and if you need a Stealth Rock lead, look to Infernape or Cobalion.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Rock</h4> <p><strong>Offensive Steel-types</strong>: Choice Scarf users like Jirachi, Excadrill, and Magnezone can outspeed Terrakion and OHKO it. Doublade also walls Terrakion's STAB attacks and only needs to watch out for a stray Earthquake, which doesn't even touch one of Doublade's most common partners, Skarmory.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Life Orb Gengar, Mega Diancie, Latias, Latios, and Choice Scarf Heracross outspeed and OHKO Choice Band Terrakion.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Defensive Mega Venusaur avoids a 2HKO from Stone Edge and retaliates with Giga Drain, healing back most of the damage dealt. Slowbro also avoids a 2HKO from anything other than X-Scissor. Landorus-T can also beat Terrakion and possibly even set up on it, while Choice Scarf variants simply outspeed and OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Azumarill and Breloom also have access to super effective priority moves that easily KO Terrakion if has lowered its defenses after a Close Combat. Mega Scizor does the same, but it can start setting up with Swords Dance as well.</p> <h4>Fighting</h4> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Skarmory, Doublade, Forretress, Klefki, and Jirachi can easily take any of Terrakion's attacks if it hasn't nabbed an Attack boost. They also can force Terrakion out and use those turns to set up entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Grass-types</strong>: Mega Venusaur, Serperior, Breloom, and Whimsicott can OHKO Terrakion with their respective Grass STAB attacks while either tanking a hit or attacking before Terrakion can.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types</strong>: Mew and Slowbro can tank any hit and cripple Terrakion with Will-O-Wisp or Scald.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Landorus-T, Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Swampert have access to Earthquake and aren't immediately threatened by Terrakion, so they can switch in fairly comfortably. They also freely set up Stealth Rock on Terrakion.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Mega Scizor, Conkeldurr, and Azumarill have super effective priority which allow them to easily revenge kill Terrakion, especially if it has lowered its defenses after a Close Combat.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band (Fighting)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat, as a STAB attack with a high Base Power, breaks through Dark-, Normal-, and Steel-types or simply anything that doesn't resist Fighting, just at the cost of lowering Terrakion's defensive stats, which Terrakion doesn't need to worry about too much. Stone Edge is a secondary STAB move that rounds out Terrakion's coverage by hitting the Pokemon that Close Combat misses out on, such as Poison-, Flying-, Fairy-, and Ghost-types. This power comes with some risk, as Stone Edge has unreliable accuracy. Because Terrakion already has great coverage between its two main STAB moves, the final two moveslots are very flexible. Although Earthquake generally has redundant coverage alongside Close Combat, it fits on this set because it hits Doublade, Nidoking, and Golurk, which wall Terrakion otherwise and pose a threat to Rock as a whole, and it has reliable accuracy, good power, and no drawbacks. X-Scissor allows Terrakion to OHKO Celebi and 2HKO Slowbro after Stealth Rock. Iron Head hits Clefable, Sylveon, Mega Gardevoir, and other Fairy-types more reliably than Stone Edge with a nifty chance to flinch. Rock Slide can be used as a more reliable Rock STAB move with a respectable accuracy that KOes weakened foes with a useful chance to flinch, which may make a difference when wearing down sturdier physical walls.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band raises Terrakion's Attack to dangerous levels so it needs much less support to defeat physical walls, 2HKOing Skarmory with Close Combat. The given EV spread maximizes Attack and Speed and helps Terrakion hit as hard and fast as possible, which is Terrakion's main function. A Jolly nature is used to maximize Terrakion's Speed and allows it to Speed tie with other base 108 Speed Pokemon such as Cobalion, Infernape, and Galvantula. Justified is Terrakion's only ability, but it provides a useful Attack boost in a few situations.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set operates with high risk and high reward; wise positioning of Terrakion throughout the game through proper double switches and free switches will allow it to find more opportunities to chip away at physical walls or earn valuable KOs by using its teammates to eliminate its checks and counters. Terrakion has decent bulk, but be careful when hard switching Terrakion into battle, as it has weaknesses to common attacking types and can't take powerful neutral attacks. Prevent Terrakion from locking itself into moves that allow the opponent to set up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sticky Web Shuckle helps patch up Terrakion's slight Speed issue, allowing it to outspeed and OHKO Mega Lopunny, and prevents several Choice Scarf Pokemon from easily revenge killing Terrakion,like Togekiss and Gardevoir. Mega Diancie helps protect Terrakion from status by bouncing back Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave with Magic Bounce and removes Sableye and Fighting-types. Pursuit Tyranitar traps Psychic- and Ghost-types in order to allow Terrakion to spam Close Combat more easily. Shell Smash Omastar takes advantage of Ground-types and physical walls that Terrakion struggles with, like Skarmory, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon. Cradily also beats many Ground-types and deals with bulky Water-types that Terrakion struggles with thanks to Storm Drain. Rhyperior can help check physical Steel-, Ground-, and Fighting-types like Mega Scizor while also absorbing Thunder Wave. RestTalk Mega Aggron is another great status absorber and checks the Fairy-, Grass-, and Steel-types that Terrakion hates. Mega Aerodactyl handles the bulky Grass-types that Terrakion doesn't like taking on and can also provide Tailwind support while appreciating Terrakion's ability to remove bulky Steel-, Normal-, and Rock-types.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf (Fighting)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stone Edge is a useful STAB attack that lets Terrakion nail the Flying-types that Fighting Monotype dreads, but its infamously poor accuracy makes it difficult to rely on. Close Combat is another STAB attack but one with higher accuracy and power that also complements Stone Edge's coverage. It also has the side effect of lowering Terrakion's defenses, however. Iron Head hits Fairy-types like Mega Diancie, Choice Scarf Gardevoir, and Clefable harder than Stone Edge, which can be difficult to revenge kill otherwise. The final moveslot can be altered to whichever you prefer, as Terrakion only needs Stone Edge, Close Combat, and Iron Head to perform well. Earthquake generally offers redundant coverage with Fighting STAB, as they both hit Rock- and Steel-types, but it does hit Doublade for decent damage. Relying on Stone Edge's accuracy to check certain threats can be detrimental in some cases, so Rock Slide could be used alongside it, as its improved accuracy and chance to flinch allow it to be effective against Pokemon that are weakened or easy for Terrakion to OHKO, making it more useful late-game.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf helps Terrakion keep many setup sweepers in check, boosting its Speed to a fantastic level. Outspeeding Tornadus-T, Mega Diancie, Mega Pinsir under Sticky Web, and many more, this offensive support tremendously helps out Fighting Monotype teams. Terrakion also has higher Speed than many other Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Togekiss and Victini. A Jolly nature is used to outspeed base 100 Speed Choice Scarf Pokemon and below, most notably Hydreigon and Kyurem-B. Justified has the potential to provide a useful Attack boost, but it is very situational, so it shouldn't be relied upon. The EV spread maximizes Attack and Speed, as Terrakion doesn't have any viable reason to invest in other stats.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Terrakion is best utilized late-game, when its checks have been weakened. Playing offensively early-game through double switches and utilizing Terrakion's teammates make it easier to reach the point where Terrakion can clean more easily. Terrakion also takes full advantage of free switches after a teammate faints, as it revenge kills several targets effectively. If Terrakion is needed to check dangerous sweepers like Mega Pinsir, keep it healthy until then, as, in Mega Pinsir's case, falling into +2 Quick Attack's KO range is devastating. For dangerous fast setup sweepers, it is important to safely send Terrakion in before they become faster than Terrakion with moves like Quiver Dance or Dragon Dance. Dragonite, Mega Gyarados, and Giga Drain Volcarona beat Terrakion at +2. Avoiding status is important for Terrakion, as burns halve its Attack, paralysis quarters its Speed, and Toxic wears it down quickly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Breloom and Mega Heracross are good offensive Pokemon to pair up with Terrakion. They keep Ground- and Water-types in check while improving the team's matchup against opposing weather teams that utilize faster sweepers like Mega Swampert and Sand Rush Excadrill. Mega Gallade helps pave the way for Terrakion's sweep by weakening Terrakion's checks through the sheer power provided by Swords Dance, by using Knock Off to weaken Psychic-types as well as Doublade, and by removing bulky Poison-types like Mega Venusaur with its Psychic-type STAB moves. Conkeldurr absorbs status for Terrakion and helps remove Doublade and other Ghost-types with Knock Off. Both Cobalion and Infernape can set up Stealth Rock, which is integral for Terrakion's sweep. Infernape can also remove Skarmory and Doublade with its Fire STAB attacks. Hawlucha possesses a handy Fighting resistance and Ground immunity, and it works well late-game with Terrakion because they both weaken each other's checks decently well. Lastly, Guts Heracross can eliminate bulky Psychic-types like Slowbro and Mew that Terrakion can't break past while also absorbing status.</p>"

    "overview": "<h3>Flying</h3> <p>A blessing in the form of Regenerator, in conjunction with Assault Vest and a blistering Speed tier, makes Tornadus-T one of the best pivots and checks to some of the most dangerous threats to Flying teams, such as Latios. Additionally, Regenerator lets Tornadus-T act as a sponge to moves like Scald and Toxic, which are typically annoying for Flying teams. Tornadus-T also has an extremely vast movepool, with coverage options like Heat Wave and utility moves like Knock Off and U-turn. However, Tornadus-T's poor physical bulk leaves it vulnerable to revenge killing from faster Pokemon like Weavile and Choice Scarf Terrakion and priority users like Bisharp and Mamoswine. Furthermore, its lackluster Special Attack makes it overly reliant on the unreliable Hurricane to have an offensive presence.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Hurricane is Tornadus-T's most spammable move, notably allowing it to check Mega Gallade. Air Slash is an alternative option on teams that run Mega Charizard Y. U-turn and Knock Off let Tornadus-T take advantage of its ability to switch into and force out threats. This combination of moves is particularly great against Psychic teams. Knock Off's utility is especially appreciated on Flying teams, as it threatens the Normal defensive core of Porygon2 + Chansey, wastes Colbur Berry on Pokemon like Slowbro, and cripples walls with no other recovery like Bronzong and Heatran. Heat Wave covers Steel-types like Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Excadrill. The given EV spread allows Tornadus-T to outspeed threats like Raikou, Starmie, and Choice Scarf Magnezone, with the rest being put into HP and Special Defense to take full advantage of Assault Vest. Specifically, Tornadus-T is able to switch into Choice Specs Latios's Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock damage. Tornadus-T also takes any hit from a +2 Expert Belt Deoxys-S at full HP.</p> <p>Being a reliable pivot and a check to important threats, Tornadus-T is easy to fit on any Flying team. Defoggers like Skarmory and Zapdos make it easier to pivot with Tornadus-T. The trio also form a great defensive core. Zapdos and Tornadus-T, in particular, form a strong VoltTurn core that supports the rest of the team. Wallbreakers like Mega Charizard Y, Landorus, and Dragonite appreciate Tornadus-T's ability to bring them in safely with U-turn and cripple defensive switch-ins with Knock Off. In return, they can break through common defensive answers to Tornadus-T like Zapdos and Empoleon. Choice Scarf Landorus-T notably forms a great Knock Off + U-turn spamming core with Tornadus-T, which is powerful against Psychic teams. Mega Aerodactyl helps against other Flying teams by dealing with Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y, Thundurus, and Zapdos. Its Pursuit trapping Victini also makes it a formidable partner to Tornadus-T against Psychic. Furthermore, Mega Aerodactyl and both Landorus formes can set Stealth Rock, making Tornadus-T's pivoting with U-turn more effective. Mega Gyarados appreciates Tornadus-T's ability to bring it in safely to start its sweep. Tornadus-T's Knock Off also wastes Colbur Berry, making sure Mega Gyarados won't be surprised by any lures. Gliscor is a great stallbreaking partner that can deal with defensive answers to Tornadus-T, like Cradily and Mandibuzz, as well as Mega Garchomp. Tornadus-T appreciates Thundurus's ability to cripple faster revenge killers with Prankster Thunder Wave. The two also form a menacing VoltTurn core.</p>"

Thundurus's Expert Belt-boosted Electric-, Ice-, and Grass-type coverage hits many Pokemon super effectively, including troublesome Water / Ground-types such as Gastrodon. However, because of its fragility and weakness to Stealth Rock, Thundurus is susceptible to revenge killing from faster threats like Deoxys-S, Choice Scarf Heracross, and Choice Scarf Victini.</p>",

Thundurus has plenty of other options that it can run over Thunder Wave, although being able to paralyze faster threats is one of its biggest niches. Focus Blast allows Thundurus to OHKO Hydreigon and offensive Mega Tyranitar and hit Steel-types such as Excadrill, Magnezone, and Ferrothorn. With Taunt, Thundurus can deter Stealth Rock setters such as Cobalion and Bronzong and prevent problematic Pokemon from recovering like Mega Latias, Zapdos, and Mega Venusaur. Nasty Plot hones Thundurus's sweeping prowess and allows it to break through specially defensive walls like Zapdos. Knock Off can be used with a Naive or Hasty nature to cripple Eviolite users like Chansey and Porygon2 and deal more damage to Ghost- and Psychic-types like Gengar and Latios. A Choice Band set with Knock Off, U-turn, and Superpower allows Thundurus to check Psychic-types like Latios and Celebi and deal significant damage to Chansey. Compared to the standard set, Choice Band variants contribute less in most matchups outside of Normal and Psychic.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Electric</h4> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can set Stealth Rock, tank attacks from Thundurus, and 3HKO it with Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: Mega Venusaur switches into Thundurus and wears it down with Sludge Bomb or Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Mega Latias</strong>: Mega Latias can use Thundurus as setup bait; however, mono-attacking Stored Power sets should be wary of Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Zapdos avoids being 2HKOed by Thundurus after Stealth Rock and pressures it with Discharge. Other Pokemon with good special bulk like Heatran and Mega Gardevoir can survive two hits from Thundurus and threaten it with Lava Plume and Hyper Voice, respectively. Rindo Berry Swampert can also tank an Expert Belt-boosted Grass Knot from Thundurus and OHKO it with Mirror Coat.</p> <p><strong>Electric-resistant Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types resistant or immune to Electric like Magnezone, Ferrothorn, and Excadrill can wall Thundurus's coverage and threaten it in various ways. However, all of them need to watch out for uncommon Focus Blast variants.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Weavile, Choice Scarf Victini, and Choice Scarf Heracross outspeed and OHKO Thundurus while surviving at least one attack from it. The latter two Pokemon, however, need to be wary of paralysis.

  "Landorus": {
    "overview": "<h3>Flying</h3> <p>Landorus is an incredible and versatile wallbreaker due to its ability Sheer Force, great offensive stats, solid natural bulk, and great complementary coverage. Its raw power allows it to check nearly every slower Pokemon bar Chansey. Landorus breaks Steel teams with ease for its teammates, OHKOing Skarmory with Focus Blast after Stealth Rock and 2HKOing bulky Mega Scizor with Earth Power. Its Speed tier allows it to threaten base 100 Pokemon such as offensive Volcarona and Manaphy; however, it is still easily revenge killed by faster threats such as Latios and Thundurus. Landorus's part Ground typing grants it an immunity to Electric attacks such as Raikou's Thunderbolt and Victini's Bolt Strike. However, it compounds Flying's natural weakness to Ice-type attackers such as Weavile, which folds Landorus with Ice Shard. While Landorus is a strong wallbreaker, using it comes at the opportunity cost of running Landorus-T, which is a better form of Speed control, can pivot with U-turn, and can take on threats such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Manectric with its Choice Scarf set.</p> <h3>Ground</h3> <p>Landorus is the best special attacker on Ground teams because of its fantastic movepool, good offensive stats, and powerful combination of Life Orb and Sheer Force. Thanks to its part-Flying typing, Landorus is one of the very few Ground-immune Pokemon on Ground teams, allowing it to better check Pokemon like Garchomp and Excadrill. Its resistance to Fighting allows Landorus to situationally switch into Choice Scarf Terrakion's Close Combat. Landorus's wide offensive movepool gives it unpredictability, and there are very few Pokemon that can counter all of its sets. Landorus suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, often wanting to use support moves like Gravity but having to drop an attack. Landorus's Speed tier allows it to outpace base 100 Speed foes like Volcarona and Choice Band Victini, although Landorus's Speed and bulk still leave it vulnerable to revenge killing from faster threats like Deoxys-S and Thundurus.</p>",

Rock Slide hits Flying-types with high Special Defense like Mega Charizard Y, Tornadus-T, and Zapdos. Hidden Power Ice targets Flying-, Ground-, and Dragon-types like Gliscor, opposing Landorus, Garchomp, and Dragonite. U-turn deals more damage to Celebi and Mega Latias while also allowing Landorus to provide pivot support to its teammates. A combination of Rock Polish and Psychic can be used to decimate Fighting teams. Psychic also covers Fighting- and Poison-types like Heracross, Hawlucha, Mega Venusaur, and Gengar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Flying</h4> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Ground-immune Pokemon such as Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Mega Latias can easily tank any of Landorus's attacks, shrug off the damage with recovery, and retaliate with their own attacks. However, Zapdos and Tornadus-T cannot switch into Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls, especially Chansey and Gastrodon, can easily tank any of Landorus's attacks.

Focus Blast pairs nicely with Earth Power to hit the Steel-types Earth Power cannot handle such as Skarmory while also covering Dark- and Normal-types such as Hydreigon, Tyranitar, Porygon2, and Staraptor. Knock Off allows Landorus to remove items such as Chansey's Eviolite, Tornadus-T's Assault Vest, and Bronzong's Leftovers. Rock Slide allows Landorus to OHKO Fire-type threats such as Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona, which can otherwise tank its attacks once. It, in tandem with Focus Blast, is also useful in the mirror matchup, letting Landorus break the core of Skarmory and Zapdos. Stealth Rock allows Landorus and its teammates to better take on foes such as Mega Charizard Y and Life Orb Kyurem-B. Due to its offensive prowess, Landorus forces a ton of switches, allowing it multiple opportunities to safely set up Stealth Rock throughout the match. Sheer Force in combination with Life Orb allows Landorus to hit with devastating power, OHKOing Staraptor after chip damage from Stealth Rock and 2HKOing bulky walls such as Mega Venusaur. Sheer Force also negates Life Orb's damage recoil. Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment alongside a Naive nature allows Landorus to outpace threats such as Hydreigon and Volcarona while not reducing the power of Knock Off. Additionally, Landorus can tank a single V-create from Choice Scarf Victini at full health and revenge kill it.</p> <p>All of Landorus's teammates appreciate its ability to set Stealth Rock, provide a switch into Electric-type attacks, and remove items such as Latios's Choice Specs with Knock Off on the switch. Skarmory can switch into Ice-type attackers such as Mamoswine and Weavile for Landorus while also being able to sponge physical attacks from threats such as Terrakion and Mega Pinsir. Additionally, Skarmory can cripple foes such as Zapdos on the switch with Toxic, allowing Landorus to break them easier down the road. In return, Landorus can handle offensive threats that can overwhelm Skarmory such as Hydreigon and Kyurem-B. Tornadus-T acts as a special pivot thanks to Regenerator and Assault Vest allowing it to sponge special attacks such as Choice Specs Latios's Draco Meteor with ease. Additionally, it can safely pivot in Landorus with U-turn on forced switches as well as form a Knock Off core with Landorus. Zapdos is another special wall that can switch to alleviate Landorus's pressure to check faster Electric-type Pokemon, which often carry Hidden Power Ice, thanks to its Electric neutrality and access to Roost. It also provides Defog support, can weaken foes such as Wish Mega Gardevoir with Toxic, and can pivot Landorus in safely with Volt Switch. Mega Charizard Y forms the ultimate Steel-breaking core with Landorus, absolutely demolishing every Steel-type alongside it with Fire Blast and Focus Blast. Its ability Drought and coverage in Solar Beam also allow it to act as a soft check to offensive Water-types. Mega Gyarados is a phenomenal setup sweeper and can clean through Psychic teams with Crunch or Ground teams with Waterfall. Additionally, it can prevent passive Pokemon such as Mandibuzz, Staraptor, and Skarmory from clearing entry hazards with Taunt. Thundurus breaks through Ground, Water, and Flying teams with Grass Knot, Thunderbolt, and Hidden Power Ice. It becomes a phenomenal wallbreaker that is able to take on threats such as Zapdos after a Nasty Plot boost and Stealth Rock chip. Dragonite can break special walls such as Zapdos, Chansey, and Tyranitar with Outrage and Superpower as well as revenge kill boosted threats such as Volcarona, Mega Sharpedo, and Cloyster with Extreme Speed.</p>"

    "overview": "<h3>Normal</h3> <p>With impressive stats, an enormous movepool, great special bulk, and a solid typing, Meloetta can fulfill roles such as a wallbreaker and Calm Mind sweeper, making it a great asset to Normal-type teams. As a wallbreaker, Meloetta gives a much-needed offensive presence to the passive balanced Normal archetype of Eviolite Pokemon, Ditto, and bulky Staraptor. Meloetta's high Special Defense allows it to take several hits from special attackers such as Zapdos, Clefable, and Magnezone and provides further opportunities to set up Calm Mind more effectively. This is further benefited by Meloetta's decent base 90 Speed, which can allow it to outspeed defensive Pokemon such as Zapdos. Its unique Normal / Psychic typing grants it an immunity to Ghost-type moves and lets it check Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Heracross.</p> <p>However, Meloetta has trouble switching into physical attacks due to its mediocre Defense stat. While its Normal / Psychic typing is unique, it leaves Meloetta weak to Dark-types and Knock Off users. In addition, despite its base 90 Speed, Meloetta is still left outsped by threats such as Mega Gallade, Garchomp, and Landorus. Finally, due to its lack of reliable recovery, it is often vulnerable to status effects such as poison and burn, which hinders its longevity in battle.</p> <h3>Psychic</h3> <p>With its unique typing shared by no other Psychic-type Pokemon, Meloetta is one of the best Ghost checks that Psychic teams have to offer, taking on significant threats like Gengar, Chandelure, and Doublade. Meloetta is also blessed by good stats and a large movepool and thus becomes much more than just a Ghost-type check; its huge Special Defense stat combined with its decent HP lets it serve as a great blanket check to a variety of special attackers in the Monotype metagame, and its great Special Attack and impressive coverage options transform Meloetta into a formidable wallbreaker. Meloetta's Defense, however, leaves much to be desired and makes it extremely vulnerable to common physical moves that it is already weak to, like Knock Off, U-turn, and Pursuit. In addition, Meloetta has rather low Speed for a wallbreaker and thus finds itself being forced out by faster Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Normal</h4> <p>Thunderbolt can target Flying- and Water-types such as Skarmory and Gyarados. Hidden Power Fire is mainly used against Steel-types, especially Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. Trick can be used as a way to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Mew, Chansey, Mandibuzz, and Ferrothorn.</p> <h4>Psychic</h4> <p>Meloetta's base 100 HP combined with its solid bulk lets it use a Substitute + Calm Mind set effectively, as it can make 101 HP Substitutes that cannot be broken by Seismic Toss and can boost reliably against bulkier types like Normal, Water, and Flying. Such a set, however, takes a long time to set up, is very matchup reliant, and often becomes dead weight against types like Dark, Bug, and Steel. Meloetta also has an interesting support movepool, with utility options like Thunder Wave, so a defensive set with these moves could be used. Finally, Thunderbolt can hit Skarmory more reliably, but Meloetta already has trouble fitting moves into its moveset and is often better off using its dual STAB moves and its more common coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Normal</h4> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Meloetta has a huge problem against Dark-types and has to rely on Focus Blast to KO them, which poses a significant risk due to Focus Blast's low accuracy. Meloetta can easily faint to a STAB Knock Off or be KOed by other attacks such as Bisharp's Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Status and Residual Damage</strong>: Status effects, such as burn, poison, and paralysis, greatly hinder Meloetta's presence on the field. With no reliable recovery options, Meloetta's longevity gets cut short from burn and poison and it becomes outsped by most other Pokemon if paralyzed. Meloetta also can't afford to switch into entry hazards such as Spikes, Stealth Rock, and Toxic Spikes either because it has no reliable recovery, which limits its opportunities to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and Zapdos can tank several of Choice Specs Meloetta's special attacks. Chansey can inflict Meloetta with status conditions from either Thunder Wave or Toxic and proceed to KO it with Seismic Toss while recovering health with Soft-Boiled. Zapdos has access to reliable recovery, so it can wear Meloetta down with Toxic and Discharge. However, they need to be wary of Calm Mind Meloetta, as they're poor checks to that set. They also must watch out for Meloetta that carry Trick.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Because of Meloetta's base 90 Speed, it's easily outpaced by Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Victini. Bisharp is able to easily OHKO Meloetta with Sucker Punch, as can Victini with a powerful STAB V-create.</p> <h4>Psychic</h4> <p><strong>Fast Physical Attackers</strong>: Since Meloetta is relatively slow and has an easily exploitable Defense stat, faster physical attacking Pokemon can usually force it out with ease. Examples of these Pokemon are Victini, Landorus-T, and Mega Pinsir.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-type Pokemon</strong>: Steel-type Pokemon resist both of Meloetta's STAB types and force Meloetta to rely on the unreliable Focus Blast. Mega Scizor in particular is neutral to Focus Blast and can use sets without Choice Specs as setup fodder. Specially defensive Jirachi all take on most Meloetta sets with ease, but it must be wary of Choice Specs-boosted Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can switch into most of Meloetta's moves, but it must be wary of the Choice Specs set, as it's crippled by Trick.</p>",

      "Choice Specs (Normal)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic is Meloetta's primary STAB move, hitting Fighting- and Poison-types such as Terrakion and Mega Venusaur super effectively. Alternatively, Psyshock can be used instead of Psychic to target the foe's Defense stat, which makes it a great check to Chansey, Quiver Dance Volcarona, and Calm Mind users such as Clefable. Hyper Voice is necessary as a secondary STAB move to hit several types for neutral damage. It can also hit foes that tend to set up Substitute such as Gyarados. Focus Blast provides Meloetta with Fighting-type coverage to hit threats such as Tyranitar, Mamoswine, Porygon2, Heatran, and Skarmory. Shadow Ball allows Meloetta to hit Psychic-types such as Jirachi and can 2HKO Mew. Alternatively, Energy Ball hits Ground- and Water-types such as Hippowdon, Seismitoad, Swampert, and Gastrodon super effectively. It also OHKOes Rotom-W and Azumarill.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs along with a Modest nature maximize Meloetta's damage output. Maximum Speed EVs are used to outspeed Jolly Breloom, Adamant Choice Band Diggersby, and Timid Heatran. Choice Specs is used to increase Meloetta's damage output even further. Choice Scarf with a Timid nature can be used instead of Choice Specs for Meloetta to be as fast as possible, outspeeding Pokemon such as specially defensive Tentacruel, physically defensive Staraptor, and Adamant Mamoswine. This also enables Meloetta to act as a revenge killer against Dark- and Fighting-types. However, Meloetta completely misses out on the extra damage potential and is unable to wallbreak. The Speed EVs can instead be put into HP to increase Meloetta's bulk. A Timid nature can be used instead of a Modest nature to outspeed Jolly Gyarados, Mamoswine, and Timid Nidoking; however, Meloetta needs a Modest nature in order to wallbreak.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set allows Meloetta to function as a hard-hitting wallbreaker, but status effects such as poison, burn, and paralysis can cripple its effectiveness. It can be brought in early-game to dent the opposing team and break down physical walls. Meloetta can also come into weak special attacks, creating an opportunity for it to deal enormous damage, so it should be played aggressively. Keep Meloetta healthy if there is an opposing threat it needs to check such as Mew or Clefable.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Lopunny helps against Dark-type Pokemon with its Fighting-type STAB moves. It can provide chip damage with Fake Out and deal with Pokemon such as Chansey, which otherwise walls Meloetta. Mega Lopunny can also switch into a predicted Knock Off to sponge the attack. Porygon2 is a great switch-in for physical attackers due to Eviolite and can spread status with moves such as Thunder Wave and Toxic, allowing Meloetta to wallbreak more effectively. Staraptor can help against Bug-types such as Volcarona, Mega Scizor, and Mega Pinsir. Diggersby is a great physical wallbreaker that complements Meloetta's special attacks. Ditto's ability Imposter allows it to threaten many setup sweepers that tend to set up on Choice-locked Meloetta. Chansey helps absorb status moves aimed at Meloetta with Natural Cure and also set up Stealth Rock to get chip damage on opposing Pokemon so that Meloetta can KO them more easily, especially Pokemon with a Focus Sash.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Calm Mind (Normal)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute keeps Meloetta from being affected by any status moves and allows it to safely set up Calm Mind. Calm Mind boosts Meloetta's Special Attack and Special Defense by one stage, making its attacks more powerful while also granting increased bulk against special attackers. Psyshock helps Meloetta break through special walls and hit Chansey. Shadow Ball hits Psychic-types such as Mega Gardevoir and Latias super effectively. It also hits Steel-types, which resist Psyshock, such as Heatran, Skarmory, and Jirachi. However, Shadow Ball leaves Meloetta unable to threaten Dark-type Pokemon. Focus Blast can be used instead to provide coverage against Dark-, Ice-, Normal-, and Steel-types such as Bisharp, Kyurem-B, Porygon2, and Ferrothorn at the cost of coverage for Psychic-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP EVs grant Meloetta more bulk. This also prevents Chansey from breaking Meloetta's Substitute with Seismic Toss, making it a great target to set up Calm Mind on. Maximum Speed EVs along with a Timid nature maximize Meloetta's Speed, letting it outspeed Jolly Gyarados, Excadrill, and Timid Heatran. The remaining EVs are invested into Special Attack to increase damage output. Leftovers provides passive recovery each turn, increasing its longevity and giving it more opportunities to set up Substitute. Serene Grace increases the chance to activate the secondary effects of Shadow Ball and Focus Blast.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set has Meloetta function as a Calm Mind sweeper. Depending on which coverage move Meloetta is using, make sure to eliminate threats that resist it. For example, if Meloetta has Shadow Ball instead of Focus Blast and battles against a Dark-type team, it needs to rely on its partners such as Mega Lopunny to clear the field of the opposing Pokemon. Meloetta should usually set up Substitute on predicted status-inflicting moves, as they can cripple its sweeping capabilities. Meloetta can also use Substitute to its advantage against specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey. A fallen teammate provides a good opportunity for switching in so that Meloetta doesn't take any damage upon doing so. Meloetta needs to avoid status moves as much as possible, as when inflicted, its sweeping capabilities will be ruined. It's not always recommended to use Meloetta early-game, as this set serves more as a late-game wincon, which means it should be kept healthy. Meloetta can, however, set up early-game if its checks have already fainted.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removers such as Staraptor keep Meloetta from taking damage when switching in. Meloetta will have trouble against Dark-types, which Mega Lopunny can handle. Diggersby can help wallbreak against specially bulky Pokemon such as Zapdos and Chansey for Meloetta. Chansey and Porygon2 can help wear down walls with Toxic or by inflicting paralysis with moves such as Thunder Wave and Discharge, which assists Meloetta in setting up. Chansey can also set up Stealth Rock to rack up chip damage for Meloetta.</p>"
      },
      "All-out Attacker (Psychic)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shadow Ball targets Psychic-types like Jirachi. Focus Blast hits Steel-type Pokemon like Heatran and Magnezone that resist both of its STAB types and also hits Dark-type Pokemon like Tyranitar and Bisharp super effectively. Psyshock is a strong STAB move that hits specially defensive Pokemon like Togekiss, Lanturn, and specially defensive Zapdos much harder than Psychic, but Psychic can also be used because it is stronger and can hit physically defensive Pokemon like Landorus-T and Hippowdon harder. In addition, Psychic is affected by Serene Grace. Dazzling Gleam rounds off Meloetta's coverage, letting it get past Mandibuzz while also providing a more reliable way to hit other Dark-type Pokemon in general. Hyper Voice can still be used as a good neutral STAB attack but does not help Meloetta's coverage. Trick can be used to cripple walls and Pokemon that Meloetta can't get past. U-turn can be an interesting option that lets Meloetta pivot around Pokemon that it can't beat, but Meloetta struggles to fit it in its moveset.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread is simple; maximum Speed and maximum Special Attack make Meloetta as fast and as powerful as possible. A Timid nature is preferred to outspeed base 80 Speed Pokemon like Mamoswine and Chandelure along with outspeeding maximum Speed, neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon. A Modest nature can be used if the above threats are not a concern to the team, however. Meloetta can opt for a slower EV spread if a more reliable Ghost-type switch-in is needed: 188 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed positive-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon, most notably Breloom, and 96 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed neutral-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon and below like Bisharp and Mega Swampert. Serene Grace increases Shadow Ball's, Focus Blast's, and Psychic's chances of dropping Special Defense, making Meloetta harder to switch into. Choice Specs greatly increases Meloetta's power, letting it OHKO most offensive threats and 3HKO most defensive threats at worst. Life Orb is an option so that Meloetta can freely switch moves, but the recoil limits Meloetta's utility as a Ghost check.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use this set as a wallbreaker, using its very powerful STAB moves or unresisted coverage moves to break holes in the opposing team. Meloetta has very good natural special bulk, so freely switch it into weak special attacks like Scald. Keep Meloetta healthy if the opposing team has a Chandelure or Gengar so they are not free to spam Shadow Ball.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Victini complements this Meloetta set perfectly; its strong V-create hits the specially defensive Pokemon that are likely switching into Meloetta hard, and it can use U-turn to pivot into Meloetta on the Water- and Ground-type Pokemon that give Victini trouble. Victini is also able to take weak Bug-type moves for Meloetta, and Meloetta can switch into most Water-type moves for Victini. Slowbro is a good teammate for Meloetta as well, as its high physical defense complements Meloetta's weaker defensive stat and it can take on most U-turn and Knock Off aimed at Meloetta. If Meloetta is not using Dazzling Gleam, Mega Gardevoir pairs well with it, as it is able to get rid of Mandibuzz for Meloetta while also dealing with other Dark-type Pokemon and taking Dark- and Bug-type moves neutrally.</p>"

  "Diggersby": {
    "overview": "<h3>Normal</h3> <p>Diggersby is Normal-type's best physical wallbreaker and setup sweeper, as most Pokemon cannot switch into its strong Ground- and Normal-type STAB moves. Diggersby has a great offensive ability in Huge Power, which doubles its mediocre Attack stat to monstrous levels. Its STAB Earthquake makes it great check to Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon, and it has great coverage in Fire Punch, and a priority move in Quick Attack, which also helps with its subpar Speed tier. Diggersby's nearly paper-thin defenses coupled with its Ground typing, giving it additional weaknesses to Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type moves, make it hard for it to switch into most attacks and also make it weak to common priority moves such as Aqua Jet, Ice Shard, and Mach Punch. Diggersby has a below average Speed tier that is just barely beaten by the heavily populated base 80 Speed tier, which includes big threats such as Dragonite, Mamoswine, and Gallade. It is also very weak to status like burns and Toxic poison, which ruin its sweeping and wallbreaking capabilities.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Normal</h4> <p>Knock Off is coverage for Ghost-type Pokemon, particularly Gengar, which is immune to both of Diggersby's STAB moves, and also gives general utility in removing the foe's item. Wild Charge is a strong Electric-type move that can be run to hit Flying- and Water-types like Skarmory and Gyarados harder, although one should be wary of its recoil damage. A Choice Scarf set with U-turn can be run to scout the opponent's play and switch into the appropriate Pokemon; however, its damage output is rather low and it still cannot outspeed common Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Excadrill, Victini, and Heracross. Diggersby may opt to run a Life Orb Swords Dance set with its STAB moves and a Jolly nature, although it generally appreciates being able to break through walls immediately with Choice Band.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Normal</h4> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Most Fighting-types, like Mega Gallade, Terrakion, and Heracross, are faster than Diggersby and can KO it with their strong Fighting-type STAB moves; however, most of them cannot switch into Diggersby's powerful STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory walls Diggersby's STAB moves; however it cannot switch into a Choice Band-boosted Fire Punch.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic hinders Diggersby's ability to sweep, as it slowly whittles it down, and burn halves its Attack stat, rendering it useless.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-type Pokemon can wall Diggersby according to what it is locked into. For example, Ferrothorn can switch into a Return, Mega Venusaur can switch into a Fire Punch, and they can revenge kill it due to its low bulk. Offensive Grass-types such as Breloom and Serperior can outspeed Diggersby and KO it with strong STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes rack up damage on Diggersby every time it is brought in, and Sticky Web decreases its already low Speed stat.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>:  Gengar is an exceptional offensive check to Diggersby, as it can completely wall Diggersby's STAB moves and KO back with Focus Blast; however, it cannot switch into a Choice Band-boosted Fire Punch.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Victini, Latios, and Choice Scarf Gardevoir can outspeed Diggersby and revenge kill it. Priority users such as Azumarill, Weavile, and Breloom can also revenge kill it with Aqua Jet, Ice Shard, and Mach Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band (Normal)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is Diggersby's strongest STAB move. Earthquake is its secondary STAB move that hits Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon, like Magnezone, Heatran, and Tyranitar, that resist Return. Quick Attack is a priority STAB move that can revenge kill weakened Pokemon. Fire Punch is coverage to hit Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, which would otherwise survive an Earthquake, while also 2HKOing Skarmory.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack EVs with an Adamant nature are used to maximize Diggersby's damage output. Maximum Speed EVs are used to outspeed most defensive Pokemon like slow Mew and slow Zapdos and other threats such as Adamant Bisharp and Adamant Mega Scizor. 4 EVs in Special Defense prevent Download users like Porygon2 from getting the Special Attack boost. Huge Power allows Diggersby's Attack stat to be boosted to high levels. Choice Band is the item of choice that, coupled with Huge Power, makes Diggersby one of the best wallbreakers in the Monotype metagame.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Diggersby can be sent in early to wallbreak for its team. It should be sent in on a slower wall, like Zapdos, that can't hurt it. Entry hazards, such as Spikes and Stealth Rock, bring some Pokemon that would normally be 2HKOed by Diggersby into OHKO range, such as Mega Swampert after one layer of Spikes. Diggersby can be sent in when a teammate has fallen for a free switch in, as it is very frail, and possibly revenge kill with Quick Attack. Diggersby should be kept away from status, as a burn can cut its Attack stat and a poison will reduce its longevity. Diggersby should be careful when using one of its STAB moves against teams that have immunities, as both Return and Earthquake have Pokemon that are immune to them, such as Gengar and Rotom-W.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Chansey sponges most special attacks and has access to Stealth Rock, which can help exert more pressure on the opposing side. Chansey can also cripple fast threats with Thunder Wave or whittle down walls that Diggersby cannot break through such as Porygon2 with Toxic. Porygon2 can switch into most physical attacks that threaten Diggersby. It can also cripple faster threats with Thunder Wave and Discharge, whittle Diggersby's checks down with Toxic, and punish setup sweepers with Foul Play. Defensive Staraptor covers most Fighting-type attacks that Diggersby cannot stay into as well as removes entry hazards with Defog for Diggersby to switch in more easily. It also has access to U-turn, which can be used to bring in Diggersby more. Ditto is a great check to setup sweepers that threaten Diggersby such as Cloyster. Choice Specs Meloetta is also a good offensive partner to Diggersby, as they can break each other's checks down. Meloetta can deal with the Ghost-types that wall Diggersby with Shadow Ball, while Diggersby can break through the walls that Meloetta has a tough time with such as Zapdos and Chansey. Mega Lopunny appreciates having Diggersby break its checks so that it can clean up much more easily. In return, Mega Lopunny can check some Ghost-types with its ability Scrappy, as well as certain Pokemon with Fake Out + Return.</p>"

  "Doublade": {
    "overview": "<h3>Steel</h3> <p>Doublade is a fantastic pick on many Steel-type teams because it can check Fighting-types such as Mega Heracross and Terrakion that would normally run through any Steel-type team due to its secondary Ghost typing. Because of its fantastic base 150 Defense, Doublade can switch into any physical attack to which it is not weak, and Eviolite's enhancement of this stat is just the icing on the cake. It can even take some physical attacks it is weak to, including Excadrill's Earthquake and Victini's V-create. Furthermore, access to Swords Dance characterizes Doublade as a late-game sweeper.</p> <p>However, Doublade's Special Defense is quite terrible at base 49, meaning it is easily KOed through its Eviolite by special wallbreakers such as Landorus and Mega Charizard Y. Furthermore, an utterly abysmal Speed stat of base 35 makes Doublade outsped by nearly the entire metagame and forces it to rely on the weak Shadow Sneak to hit before the foe. Doublade also has no reliable recovery, a massive flaw. Finally, No Guard, a wasted ability, actually harms Doublade, since it makes attacks like Mega Charizard Y's Fire Blast hit all of the time.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Steel</h4> <p>Because its movepool is quite shallow, Doublade has very few other options. The only plausible alternate set is a physically defensive RestTalk set that can be a decent physical wall and check Fighting-types throughout the match on bulkier Steel-type builds. However, it is very passive and easily walled due to Defense investment cutting into its power. Doublade could run Gyro Ball over Iron Head, but Iron Head is more reliable against slower threats like Clefable and Rhyperior and Gyro Ball's low PP is a deterrent to using it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Steel</h4> <p><strong>Burns</strong>: Burns from the likes of Sableye, Rotom-W, and Volcanion completely cripple Doublade, halving its Attack stat. If Doublade is ever burned, it is usually best to sack it, gaining momentum and giving a free switch to a revenge killer or counter. Many bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Slowbro can also counter Doublade by burning it with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Extremely powerful special attackers can blast through Doublade's Eviolite, outspeeding and OHKOing it. Examples include Mega Charizard Y and Landorus. However, they cannot hard switch in due to their frailty. Doublade is also significantly damaged even by special attacks to which it is not weak, such as Thundurus's Thunderbolt and Manaphy's +3 Scald.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Volcanion can hit Doublade super effectively with their STAB moves. No Guard also prevents their STAB attacks from missing. Fire-type coverage moves also heavily damage Doublade, with Choice Scarf Latios's Hidden Power Fire 2HKOing.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Many physical walls, such as Torkoal, Skarmory, Swampert, and Hippowdon, can stall out Doublade and chip away at it with their weak STAB moves, but Doublade can set up on those with neither burning moves nor phazing, such as Porygon2. The previously mentioned ones can all phaze it, set hazards against it, or burn it with Lava Plume or Scald, however.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Since Doublade is crippled without its Eviolite, Knock Off users such as Weavile, Bisharp, Mew, and Azumarill check it. However, many of them cannot switch in, due to their Dark typing which makes them weak to Sacred Sword. Mew is especially notable, since it can burn Doublade with Will-O-Wisp, although it is also weak to Ghost-type moves. Additionally, a Choice Scarf Tricked from Latios, Rotom-W, or Togekiss cripples Doublade by removing its Eviolite and preventing it from using Swords Dance. Furthermore, the Speed boost of the Choice Scarf Tricked to Doublade is wasted due to its low Speed.</p> <p><strong>Stat Boost Removers</strong>: Pokemon that can remove Doublade's stat boosts with Whirlwind or Roar, including Staraptor and Suicune, can counter it. Furthermore, these can tank any attack from Doublade and proceed to do whatever they want.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dancer (Steel)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Doublade to double its Attack, letting it attack powerfully. Shadow Sneak is Doublade's primary STAB move and somewhat makes up for its atrocious Speed, since it has boosted priority. Sacred Sword has perfect neutral coverage with Shadow Sneak and hits Normal-types immune to Ghost-type attacks, such as Chansey and Porygon2. It can also hit Dark-types that resist Shadow Sneak and threats that don't take much from Ghost-type moves, such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Ferrothorn. Shadow Claw is used because it is a strong STAB attack that has perfect neutral coverage with Sacred Sword. It also OHKOes Slowbro after two Swords Dances and helps against opposing Doublade. Iron Head can be used instead of Shadow Claw to hit Fairy-types such as Clefable and Togekiss harder, but they already take a lot of damage from Shadow Claw, and without Shadow Claw, Doublade loses to Slowbro and itself.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Doublade's Attack is maximized and boosted with an Adamant nature in order to hit as hard as possible, OHKOing Victini with a +2 Shadow Sneak after Stealth Rock, for example. 36 Speed EVs let Doublade outpace Gastrodon and place it directly below Rhyperior, a target one wants to underspeed due to its use of a Weakness Policy. An alternative speed benchmark is 44 EVs, which lets Doublade outpace Rhyperior and potentially hit it with two +2 Shadow Claws, allowing Mega Scizor to clean up. The remaining EVs are placed into HP to boost Doublade's all-around bulk. Eviolite is Doublade's choice of item, as it makes Doublade's already great Defense stellar while patching up its horrible Special Defense. No Guard is Doublade's ability simply because it is the only option; it provides no added utility whatsoever, since all of Doublade's moves are perfectly accurate.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because Doublade can wall and set up on many physical attackers and Fighting-types such as Mega Heracross and Hawlucha, switch it into them. Also, switch Doublade into predicted Fighting-type moves and into Choice item users whose moves it resists or is immune to, including Choice Band Terrakion's Close Combat. However, due to its lack of recovery, preserve Doublade's health early-game, since it cannot sweep late-game if it is worn down earlier in the match. Doublade can also switch into certain Rapid Spin users, including Avalugg. Because the opponent will then most likely switch due to Doublade walling his or her Pokemon, either use an attack that hits the switch-in the hardest or set up a Swords Dance for free. If Doublade is a massive threat to the opponent's team and can exert offensive pressure from the beginning, such as against Psychic-type teams, it can do heavy damage early and allow a teammate to clean.</p> <p>Two fantastic niches Doublade has are checking all Terrakion and non-Choice Band Victini, both of which are massive threats to Steel-type teams. It can force out the former by threatening super effective hits and tank the latter's V-create from full health to use Swords Dance and OHKO it with Shadow Sneak. It is best to keep entry hazards up on the opposing side, because they allow Doublade to more easily get crucial KOs, such as a guaranteed 2HKO against Victini and a guaranteed 2HKO against Latias and Latios after Stealth Rock. Conversely, keep hazards off one's own side of the field, since Doublade dislikes getting worn down due to a complete lack of recovery. Furthermore, keep Doublade away from Knock Off at all costs, since Doublade's Eviolite getting Knocked Off is disastrous for it. Additionally, zealously avoid Doublade getting burned, since a burn will negate any Swords Dances Doublade has set up and make it hit very weakly. It also dislikes the chip damage due to having no reliable recovery. Doublade can also be used as a pseudo-revenge killer, since it can KO a threat low on health with an unboosted Shadow Sneak.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because Doublade is easily KOed by many special attacks, specially defensive Heatran is a fantastic teammate, since it can tank them and receives free switches off of Doublade's weakness to Fire-type attacks while also providing chip damage with Toxic and Stealth Rock. Doublade's role in this partnership is to tank physical attacks that hit on Heatran's weaker defense while also being immune to Fighting-type attacks, to which Heatran is weak. Doublade partners well with entry hazard setters like Skarmory and Ferrothorn due to its immunity to Rapid Spin. Both can switch into Ground-type attacks that Doublade is weak to and net easier KOs for Doublade with the chip damage from entry hazards, a Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs, and Leech Seed, respectively. Skarmory can also share the burden of checking Fighting-types with Doublade, while Ferrothorn allows it to outspeed Choice Scarf Hoopa-U and Choice Scarf Togekiss with Thunder Wave. Excadrill offensively synergizes excellently with Doublade, since it can outspeed and KO Choice Band Victini, Mega Charizard Y, and Bisharp, all of which are massive threats to Doublade. On the other hand, Magnezone can break bulky Water-types that Doublade struggles with, such as Suicune and Politoed. It can also gain momentum for Doublade's team with Volt Switch and trap Steel-types that beat Doublade, such as Knock Off Mega Scizor and Skarmory. Sweepers such as Bisharp and Mega Scizor work well with Doublade, since they share checks and can whittle them down until a sweep is possible. The former can deter Defog with Defiant, which Doublade dislikes due to hazards helping it sweep, while the latter can switch into Knock Off due to its irremovable item. Additionally, Mega Scizor can KO Choice Band Terrakion and TrickScarf Togekiss with Bullet Punch, two Pokemon Doublade dislikes.</p>"

  "Dragalge": {
    "overview": "<h3>Poison</h3> <p>Dragalge's unique Poison / Dragon typing grants it several resistances, making it a reliable switch-in to Pokemon such as Volcarona, Rotom-W, Cobalion, Mega Charizard Y, Breloom, and Politoed. Coupled with its solid bulk, this makes Dragalge a great defensive pivot on Poison-type teams. Dragalge has a rather enormous movepool that allows it to check multiple types within the metagame such as Steel, Flying, Dark, Normal, and Ice. Adaptability gives Dragalge a niche over other Poison-types, further boosting the power of its STAB attacks and making it a threatening wallbreaker. Thanks to Choice Specs, Dragalge is able to check Mega Scizor, as it can survive a +2 Bullet Punch and OHKO back with Hidden Power Fire; most of the time, its defensive spread can do the same after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>However, Dragalge's base 44 Speed stat is rather poor, leaving it outsped by almost the entire metagame, which makes it more susceptible to taking damage first. Due to having a lack of reliable recovery, Dragalge becomes vulnerable to entry hazards and attacks from opposing threats, limiting its opportunities to switch in. Its Special Attack isn't that great either, leaving its coverage moves rather weak. Dragalge also faces tough competition from other special wallbreakers such as Nidoking, as they have more Speed, better STAB attacks, and superior coverage moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Poison</h4> <p>Assault Vest makes Dragalge more specially bulky, but it unfortunately loses out on the extra damage output that Choice Specs offers and is still worn down by residual damage. Toxic Spikes can poison the opposing team, making it easier for Dragalge to KO them; however, other entry hazard setters such as Tentacruel fit the role much better, as Dragalge relies too much on its wallbreaking power to use Toxic Spikes. Sludge Bomb can be used instead of Sludge Wave because it has a 30% chance of poisoning the foe at a cost of 5 Base Power. Dragon Pulse can be used instead of Draco Meteor for perfect accuracy and decent Base Power with no drawbacks, but it is much weaker and won't be able to get potential OHKOs that Draco Meteor is able to obtain. Thunderbolt can be used instead of Scald to hit Flying-types such as Skarmory; however, it's not all that useful and Focus Blast does a better job of damaging Skarmory, especially after it uses Roost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Poison</h4> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types are very problematic, as they resist Dragalge's Dragon-type STAB move and are immune to its Poison-type attacks. Dragalge has no other way of dealing damage to them besides Focus Blast and Hidden Power Fire. They also require prediction, as the Doublade + Heatran core can be annoying to break without the help of Scald.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types resist Dragalge's Sludge Wave, and Pokemon such as Excadrill, Landorus, Seismitoad, and Mamoswine can easily eliminate it with their Ground-type STAB moves. However, pure Ground-types can't switch into a Draco Meteor, and Excadrill is 2HKOed by the move.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Dragalge is very unlikely to attack first due to its terrible Speed stat. The majority of Pokemon, especially Latios, Latias, Excadrill, Weavile, and Garchomp, are able to outspeed and deal damage to it, making Dragalge less useful in battle.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Dragalge hates taking damage from entry hazards, as they leave it greatly hindered, give it less opportunities to switch in, and put it in KO range for opposing Pokemon. Dragalge also needs to be wary of Will-O-Wisp and other sources of burns such as Scald, as they shorten its longevity.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Almost every Psychic-type outspeeds Dragalge, and many of them such as Mega Medicham, Mega Gardevoir, Starmie, Latios, and Latias can OHKO it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Despite Dragalge being a great special wallbreaker, Umbreon can take its STAB moves very well and stall with Wish + Protect while dealing damage to it with Foul Play. Mew can burn Dragalge with Will-O-Wisp, recover any health that was lost with Roost, and remove its item with Knock Off to make its attacks much weaker. Jirachi is immune to Dragalge's Poison-type STAB attacks and resists its Draco Meteor. It can replenish its health with Wish and get flinches thanks to Serene Grace Iron Head.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Dragalge won't be able to break through Pokemon such as Chansey, as it can tank any of Dragalge's attacks and stall with Soft-Boiled while dealing damage back by using Seismic Toss.</p>",

      "Choice Specs (Poison)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is a powerful attack that is boosted by Adaptability and Choice Specs, allowing it to OHKO or 2HKO Pokemon that don't resist it. Sludge Wave is another STAB move that allows Dragalge to hit Fairy- and Grass-types such as Togekiss, Azumarill, and Serperior. Hidden Power Fire allows Dragalge to OHKO Mega Scizor and has a chance to OHKO physically defensive Ferrothorn. Focus Blast gives Dragalge more coverage for hitting Steel-types that resist its STAB moves such as Bisharp and Magnezone. It's also useful in 2HKOing specially defensive Heatran and OHKOing offensive variants and Tyranitar. Scald gives more coverage by hitting both Mega Diancie and Heatran. It also has a chance to burn the opposing threat; however, it's much weaker than Focus Blast, which Dragalge needs to eliminate other threats such as Tyranitar and Bisharp.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature maximize Dragalge's damage output, allowing it to hit as hard as possible as well as take advantage of Adaptability and Choice Specs. 224 HP EVs increase Dragalge's bulk in order to let it tank attacks much more effectively. The remaining EVs are added towards Speed, allowing Dragalge to outspeed uninvested Hippowdon and KO it with Draco Meteor. Choice Specs increases Dragalge's damage output even further, earning much-needed KOs but locking it into a move. Adaptability is needed to hit even harder with Dragalge's STAB moves, as it allows Dragalge to OHKO Volcanion, Slowbro, Mandibuzz, and Rotom-W, as well as OHKO Mega Venusaur and specially defensive Armaldo after Stealth Rock damage, with Draco Meteor.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dragalge functions well as a wallbreaker, being able to deal a lot of damage to the opposing team. Thanks to its great typing, Dragalge should mainly switch into attacks that it resists and Pokemon that it's able to beat such as Mega Charizard Y, Mega Venusaur, and Rotom-W. Due to a lack of reliable recovery, Dragalge can also come in after a fainted teammate without taking any damage. Dragalge hates entry hazards, as they can wear it down quite easily due to Draco Meteor's stat drops forcing it out often. Despite not being bothered by paralysis and poison, Dragalge should also be kept away from burns because they reduce its longevity. Dragalge should mainly be using its STAB moves for the Adaptability boost, especially Draco Meteor, as it is the most reliable attack in most matchups. It's a very spammable move, as most teams don't have a Pokemon with a Dragon-type resistance, and therefore it can wear them down very quickly. When playing against Bug- or Steel-types, Dragalge's health should be preserved long enough to revenge kill Mega Scizor with Hidden Power Fire, as none of its teammates enjoy taking damage from its Technician-boosted attacks, especially after a Swords Dance boost.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Venusaur can take on Ground- and Rock-types such as Excadrill, Garchomp, and Terrakion as well as check Ice-types for Dragalge thanks to Thick Fat. Mega Venusaur is also physically defensive, which makes it great for switching into incoming physical attacks. Weezing is also great for switching into physical attackers and using Will-O-Wisp to burn them. Gengar and Crobat can switch into Ground-type moves thanks to their immunity, and Gengar can specifically check Psychic-types such as Mega Medicham and Mew. Skuntank and Drapion both have an immunity to Psychic-type attacks and thus can freely switch into them. Skuntank can punish Pokemon that switch out with Pursuit or get extra damage with Sucker Punch. Drapion can provide utility with Knock Off to cripple item-reliant Pokemon such as Chansey and Porygon2. Drapion can also be reliable in setting up Toxic Spikes to make it easier for Dragalge to KO the opposing threat. Teammates such as Crobat, Skuntank, and Tentacruel can remove entry hazards with Defog or Rapid Spin, giving Dragalge more opportunities to switch in. Nidoqueen and Tentacruel can provide entry hazard support with Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes, respectively. Nidoqueen is also able to check many types with its coverage moves. Both Nidoking and Nidoqueen can check Steel-types that Dragalge struggles against such as Heatran, Mega Scizor, Magnezone, and Doublade. Scolipede is also a good candidate, taking on Psychic-types and Cradily with its powerful Megahorn and applying pressure on Pokemon such as Volcarona, Chansey, and Zapdos.</p>"

  "Heliolisk": {
    "overview": "<h3>Normal</h3> <p>Heliolisk is very underrated on Normal teams; however, this Pokemon possesses several strong points that make it viable. Its impressive base 109 Speed stat allows it to outspeed Pokemon such as Garchomp and Landorus and to easily gain momentum against opposing Pokemon that are unable to outspeed it with Volt Switch, escaping situations where it would otherwise be KOed by a threat. Heliolisk's part Electric typing allows it check Flying- and Water-types, both of which are prevalent in the Monotype metagame, which makes matchups easier for Normal. Its base 109 Special Attack stat gives it a great offensive presence, allowing it to hit hard with even its coverage moves. Heliolisk has access to great coverage moves such as Grass Knot and Focus Blast, allowing it to check types such as Dark, Ground, Ice, Normal, and Steel. Heliolisk is gifted with the wonderful ability Dry Skin, which grants it immunity to and therefore a free switch into any Water-type moves.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Heliolisk has paper-thin defenses, making it vulnerable to any hard-hitting attacks. Its Electric / Normal typing comes with a cost: while being immune to Ghost-type attacks, Heliolisk stacks another Fighting-type weakness on Normal teams. Heliolisk faces a lot of competition from Mega Pidgeot and Meloetta, as they both have higher Special Attack stats and wider movepools. However, Heliolisk is better at pivoting, checks Flying- and Water-types, and survives a Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor after a Swords Dance boost.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Normal</h4> <p>Hyper Voice gives Heliolisk a secondary STAB move, which hits the majority of types for neutral damage; however, Heliolisk needs to rely on its coverage moves to check other types that threaten it. Expert Belt is useful for bluffing a Choice item while still increasing damage for super effective hits; however, it doesn't deal as much damage as Choice Specs. Dark Pulse gives Heliolisk coverage to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Doublade, Mew, and Victini; however, Dark Pulse isn't too useful because Meloetta has Shadow Ball to hit both types, Heliolisk prefers to use its other coverage moves, and Dark Pulse can't 2HKO Mew. Hidden Power Fire is great for reliably checking Mega Scizor. Choice Scarf gives Heliolisk the extra Speed to outpace Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Sceptile, Weavile, and Thundurus, along with Choice Scarf users such as Victini, Kyurem-B, and Terrakion; however, Heliolisk will miss the extra damage it can deal with Choice Specs.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Normal</h4> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Heliolisk is frail, which makes it a prime target for Choice Scarf users such as Victini, Latios, Kyurem-B, Heracross, and Terrakion, all of which can KO it.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Zapdos is only 3HKOed by Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice and can stall out Heliolisk with Toxic + Roost, Clefable can use Heliolisk as a setup fodder with Calm Mind + Soft-Boiled, and Mew can burn it with Will-O-Wisp and begin to stall with Roost. Mega Venusaur also gives Heliolisk trouble, as the only move that Heliolisk is able to hit it with is Hyper Voice. Even that isn't enough to stop Mega Venusaur, as it can recover back health with Synthesis.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: All Fighting-types are an issue for Heliolisk, as they can easily KO it with their STAB moves. Choice Scarf Heracross and Terrakion can eliminate Heliolisk with Close Combat, Hawlucha outspeeds and KOes with High Jump Kick, Infernape carries Focus Sash, which will allow it to survive a hit from Heliolisk's attacks and KO it back with Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Many Dragon-types such as Latios, Latias, Kyurem-B, and Hydreigon resist Heliolisk's Electric-type STAB attacks, while Garchomp is immune to them. This makes Heliolisk heavily reliant on Hidden Power Ice to KO them.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Heliolisk is vulnerable to Breloom and Conkeldurr's Mach Punch as well as Bisharp's Sucker Punch. It also needs to be wary of Choice Band Dragonite due to its access to Extreme Speed.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive (Normal)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt is a great STAB move that can hit most types for neutral damage as well as 2HKO Pokemon such as Cobalion, Sableye, and specially defensive Drapion. Thunderbolt also has a chance to OHKO Mandibuzz and Bisharp. Volt Switch allows Heliolisk to deal damage before switching out to a more reasonable counter to the opposing threat, gaining momentum for its team. Grass Knot is Heliolisk's way of checking Ground-types, as the move OHKOes Mega Swampert, Mamoswine, and Gastrodon. Focus Blast hits Dark-, Ice-, and Steel-types such as Tyranitar, Hydreigon, Avalugg, and Magnezone. Hidden Power Ice can be used instead of Focus Blast, as it allows Heliolisk to hit Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Latios super effectively, as well as hitting Landorus-T and Gliscor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs along with a Timid nature allow Heliolisk to be as fast as possible, allowing it to outspeed Pokemon such as Mega Pinsir, Garchomp, and Landorus. Maximum Special Attack increases Heliolisk's damage output. Dry Skin is preferred, as the ability grants Heliolisk immunity to Water-type moves. Choice Specs is preferred over Life Orb for more power but locks Heliolisk into a move. It notably allows Heliolisk to OHKO Mega Gyarados after Stealth Rock damage. Life Orb can be used instead of Choice Specs to have more freedom in using any move; however, after each successful attack, Heliolisk loses a bit of health.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Heliolisk can function well as a dedicated lead due to its Speed and access to Volt Switch, which allow it to pivot in and out against powerful threats that could otherwise easily eliminate it. Despite being fast, Heliolisk should be wary of potential Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Kyurem-B, Gardevoir, Excadrill, and Terrakion. Depending on which Pokemon carries a Choice Scarf, switch out to Porygon2, Chansey, or defensive Staraptor. Due to its frailty, Heliolisk should come in after a fallen teammate or on a U-turn. Heliolisk should always use Volt Switch in matchups that are unfavorable to switch out to a more threatening Pokemon against the foe. For example, use Volt Switch on Mega Venusaur and switch into Staraptor. Heliolisk shouldn't attempt to stay in on specially defensive Pokemon that it can't beat, such as Zapdos, Mew, and Clefable, because Heliolisk won't be able to deal much damage. Heliolisk can take advantage of incoming Water-type attacks to get a safe switch thanks to Dry Skin. It's a great pivot early-game, but late-game, it can transition into being a cleaner once its checks are suitably weakened, thanks to its good Speed and Special Attack. Heliolisk needs to avoid status effects such as burn and poison, as these along with Life Orb damage can wear down Heliolisk very easily, making it even more vulnerable to priority moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny, Staraptor, and Diggersby can apply pressure on Pokemon such as Chansey, Mega Venusaur, and Zapdos, respectively. Mega Lopunny can clear the field of Steel-types such as Bisharp and Doublade while Staraptor can take on Bug-, Fighting-, and Grass-types such as Volcarona, Heracross, and Breloom. Staraptor deserves a special mention because it can be a reliable entry hazard remover with Defog, soften attacks for Heliolisk with Intimidate, and provide a neutrality to Fighting-type attacks thanks to its Flying typing. Porygon2 can switch into physical attacks aimed at Heliolisk. It can inflict status such as Toxic and Thunder Wave and check Swords Dance users such as Mega Scizor with Foul Play. It can also check Dragon-types very well, making it an incredibly important teammate for Heliolisk that lack Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p>Entry hazard setters such as Chansey and Smeargle can set up Stealth Rock, which makes it easier for Heliolisk to KO other Pokemon and apply pressure with Volt Switch. Smeargle can also set up Sticky Web for Heliolisk to gain the Speed advantage over opposing Pokemon, especially Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion, Heracross, Victini, Gardevoir, and Kyurem-B, along with Mega Swampert in the rain. Chansey is able to sponge special attacks for Heliolisk and is a great status absorber thanks to Natural Cure. It also has access to Heal Bell in case Heliolisk does get poisoned, burned, or frozen, and just like Porygon2, it can use Toxic and Thunder Wave on other foes. Other special attackers such as Mega Pidgeot, Meloetta, and Porygon-Z are all great partners for Heliolisk, as they can help in dealing with physical walls such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Porygon2, and Armaldo. Specifically, Meloetta can take on Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Gengar, Doublade, and Mew. Porygon-Z has access to a plethora of coverage moves that allow it to check several types. Heliolisk has trouble against Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn, but Mega Pidgeot can eliminate both of these Pokemon with Heat Wave.</p>"

  "Sylveon": {
    "overview": "<p>Sylveon has great Special Attack, impressive bulk, and a good movepool, all of which allow it to perform a number of roles effectively. It can be a great wallbreaker with Choice Specs thanks to its access to STAB Pixilate Hyper Voice. Its access to Heal Bell, Wish, and Calm Mind allow it to function as a cleric and bulky setup sweeper user. It has decent coverage options in Shadow Ball and Psyshock, the latter of which can hit Poison-types that would try to switch in on a Fairy-type attack. However, Sylveon's low Defense limits its defensive capabilities. Its low Speed makes it easy to revenge kill and means that it will often need to take a hit first before it can attack. Its good Special Defense makes this less of a problem, but physical attackers can still take advantage of it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A utility set with Wish, Protect, Hyper Voice, and Toxic or Heal Bell can be used, but it's heavily inferior to Sylveon's other sets because Clefable is much more effective at running that type of set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey's massive special bulk allows it to switch in on any variant of Sylveon and check it effectively.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Bulky Steel-types such as Heatran and Empoleon can switch into all of Sylveon's moves and force it out, while offensive Steel-types such as Excadrill and Bisharp outspeed and OHKO it with Iron Head but don't want to switch into a Choice Specs-boosted attack. Heatran does need to be careful of Hidden Power Ground, however.</p> <p><strong>Scizor</strong>: Any variant of Scizor can check Sylveon with Bullet Punch, but it should be careful of switching in because Choice Specs-boosted Hyper Voice does a lot of damage, and Sylveon can possess Hidden Power Fire. If Sylveon isn't locked into Hidden Power Fire, Mega Scizor can use it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Mega Venusaur and Tentacruel can eat up Hyper Voice and check Sylveon. They have to watch out for Psyshock, however.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Sylveon's Defense is not that impressive, so it should be used carefully around physical attackers and revenge killers such as Entei and Diggersby.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Sylveon doesn't appreciate status conditions because they can cripple its longevity and its wallbreaking or sweeping potential.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: The Choice Specs set lacks recovery, so residual damage from entry hazards and status strongly cripples Sylveon's longevity.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hyper Voice is Sylveon's strongest attack, as it is a STAB move, is boosted by Pixilate, and hits the Pokemon regardless of Substitute. Psyshock hits Poison-types that try to switch in on a Fairy-type attack such as Mega Venusaur and Tentacruel. Hidden Power Fire hits Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Scizor, while Hidden Power Ground can be used to hit Heatran, which otherwise walls Sylveon. However, hitting Scizor is far more important than hitting Heatran because Diamond Storm 2HKOs offensive Heatran most of the time. Shadow Ball hits Pokemon such as Jirachi and Doublade, which are big threats to Sylveon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in HP and Special Attack with a Modest nature allows Sylveon to hit as hard as possible and tank hits more effectively. 16 EVs in Speed are useful for outspeeding uninvested base 60 Speed Pokemon such as Clefable. This is especially helpful against Pokemon like Tyranitar, which Sylveon can take out with Hyper Voice without having to take a Stone Edge first. Pixilate increases the power of Hyper Voice and turns it into a Fairy-type STAB move. Choice Specs increases Sylveon's Special Attack, making it an amazing wallbreaker.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>There aren't many Pokemon that appreciate taking a Choice Specs-boosted Hyper Voice from Sylveon, so it can be used to wallbreak at any point of the game. It excels at breaking down most passive walls unless they're very bulky and resist Fairy. The boosts from Pixilate and STAB make Hyper Voice the superior attack most of the time because Sylveon's other coverage moves need to be super effective in order to deal more damage than it. Even though it's going to get outsped most of the time, thanks to its great Special Defense, Sylveon can eat up special attacks and hit back very hard. Sylveon's good Special Defense also lets it be a decent pivot to neutral or resisted attacks. Due to its low Speed and Defense, it should watch out for physical attackers and only come in after a teammate faints unless it can deal really well with the Pokemon it's switching in on. Sylveon should avoid coming in on entry hazards and getting inflicted with status because it can be crippled and worn down easily.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Klefki is a great partner for Sylveon because it can set up dual screens, allowing Sylveon to take hits even better, spread paralysis, which Sylveon greatly appreciates, and stack Spikes. Klefki also has an immunity to poison and takes neutral damage from Steel-type moves, which all Fairy-type teams appreciate. Clefable also has the ability to spread paralysis and set up Stealth Rock, which helps Sylveon wallbreak more easily. Clefable also functions as a status absorber thanks to its Magic Guard ability. Azumarill can deal with Pokemon that wall Sylveon such as Heatran and Empoleon thanks to its Water typing, high Attack, and access to Superpower. Gardevoir is a great Choice Scarf user that checks Poison-types that threaten Sylveon such as Gengar and Nidoking. It also checks Sand Rush Excadrill thanks to its Trace ability. Togekiss is immune to Ground, which helps Fairy's lack of Pokemon that resist Ground, and it has access to Fire Blast and Aura Sphere, which allows it to check Steel-types. Togekiss can also spread paralysis with Thunder Wave, cure Sylveon's status with Heal Bell if it's a support variant, and get rid of entry hazards with Defog, which helps Sylveon's longevity. Mega Diancie's Magic Bounce ability helps Sylveon dodge status moves and keeps hazards off the field. Mega Diancie also appreciates Choice Specs Sylveon's wallbreaking power, as it's unable to get past walls such as Mew and Gliscor on its own.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind boosts Sylveon's already decent Special Attack and Special Defense, making it bulkier and more powerful. Hyper Voice is Sylveon's powerful STAB attack, which is Pixilate boosted and hits Pokemon regardless of Substitute. Substitute allows Sylveon to dodge status moves from slower Pokemon or gain momentum when forcing a switch. Wish can be used for recovery or to pass to a teammate.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>16 EVs in Speed allow Sylveon to outspeed uninvested base 60 Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Clefable, and Swampert. The rest of the EVs are invested in HP and Defense to make Sylveon as bulky as possible so it can take both physical and special hits after it uses Calm Mind. Maximum investment in HP also helps it pass bigger Wishes and improves the bulk of its Substitute. Leftovers gives Sylveon some longevity and is its only form of recovery if not running Wish. Pixilate boosts the power of Hyper Voice and makes it a Fairy-type STAB attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Sylveon should be used as a bulky setup sweeper once its checks have been removed or weakened. Thanks to the Defense investment and its natural special bulk, it can be used as a bulky pivot. Sylveon can get up a Substitute against slower and passive Pokemon such as Slowbro and Porygon2 or when it forces the foe to switch out, which can also be done by bluffing a Choice Specs set. If running Wish, Sylveon should be kept as healthy as possible, giving it more chances to use Substitute or pivot into attacks. It should be kept away from status moves because they can cripple its sweeping potential or longevity.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Klefki is a great partner for Sylveon thanks to its immunity to Poison-type attacks and neutrality to Steel. Klefki is also able to spread paralysis, stack Spikes, and get up dual screens, which give Sylveon more opportunities to set up. Clefable works well with Sylveon because its Magic Guard ability allows it to absorb statuses. Clefable is able to spread paralysis like Klefki, but it can also set up Stealth Rock. Furthermore, Clefable is free to run a utility set due to Sylveon already acting as a wincon with Calm Mind. Azumarill is a great partner for Sylveon because it can get rid of bulky Steel-types that wall Sylveon such as Heatran and Empoleon. Azumarill also has more freedom throughout the match because it doesn't need to stay passive and preserve its health to set up late-game thanks to Sylveon's ability to pass Wishes. Gardevoir is a great Choice Scarf user on Fairy and works well with Sylveon because it can get rid of Poison-type threats such as Nidoking. Togekiss's access to Fire Blast and Aura Sphere makes it a decent partner for Sylveon because it can dent Steel-types that annoy Sylveon, as well as hit Mega Venusaur with Air Slash. Togekiss is also immune to Ground-type attacks, which Fairy-type teams appreciate, since they don't have another solid answer. Another thing that Sylveon appreciates from Togekiss is its access to Heal Bell, which helps Sylveon's issue with status. Mega Diancie is a solid partner for Sylveon because its Magic Bounce ability bounces back status and entry hazards, which annoy Sylveon. It's also an excellent receiver of Sylveon's Wish passes due to its high Speed, wallbreaking abilities, and lack of recovery.</p>"

  "Klefki": {
    "overview": "<h3>Fairy</h3> <p>Klefki's Prankster ability and access to Light Screen, Reflect, Thunder Wave and Spikes make it very effective as a support and utility Pokemon. Dual screens are very important, as Fairy is a setup-oriented type. Klefki's Steel / Fairy typing gives it an immunity to Poison, a neutrality to Steel, and many resistances allowing it to switch in to strong wallbreakers such as Weavile, Mega Gardevoir, Alakazam and Meloetta. It is also a situational switch-in to Hydreigon, Kyurem-B, Tornadus-T, Gengar, and more, allowing it to cripple them with Thunder Wave. Its access to Foul Play allows it to check Mega Scizor, the biggest threat to Fairy-type teams. Klefki should be played with carefully, as it lacks offensive presence and its stats all around are subpar without support from screens; it is also walled by any Ground- and Electric-type Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Fairy</h4> <p>Toxic is a good option for hitting Pokemon immune to Thunder Wave and whittling down notable walls such as Slowbro, Hippowdon, and Zapdos. Magnet Rise is an option to safely set up screens against Ground-type Pokemon. Switcheroo lets Klefki steal the foe's item and is especially useful against Pokemon holding a Choice item. It's also able to give the foe a crippling item such as Flame Orb or Lagging Tail. Flame Orb is especially useful for burning Bisharp and Choice Band Scizor, but it prevents Klefki from pivoting in because it will get itself burned. Additionally, Mega Scizor cannot have its item taken, so it becomes a bigger threat. A set with Calm Mind and Iron Defense, a STAB attack, and Rest with a Chesto Berry can tear through unprepared teams. However, it loses out on screen support, Thunder Wave, and Foul Play, making Mega Scizor and Kingdra bigger threats. Sitrus Berry can be used to give Klefki more longevity, but you lose out on the longer duration of screens.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Fairy</h4> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-type Pokemon such as Gliscor and Excadrill are immune to Klefki's Thunder Wave and can deal super effective damage to it. To alleviate this problem, though, Klefki can run Magnet Rise.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-type Pokemon like Zapdos and Rotom are immune to Klefki's go-to crippling move Thunder Wave, and there's not much Klefki can do to them in return due to its lack of offensive presence. Magnezone is especially threatening to Klefki, as it can trap it with Magnet Pull and prevent it from setting up more rounds of screens, spreading paralysis, and stacking Spikes later in the game.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon can easily break Klefki, as it doesn't have much to defend itself with against them and the most it can do is cripple them with Thunder Wave, barring Rotom-H.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with the Magic Bounce ability such as Mega Diancie prevent Klefki from spreading status and setting up Spikes, therefore forcing Klefki to switch out after setting up screens.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Pokemon with Taunt such as Mew, Gliscor, and Thundurus prevent Klefki from using any of its utility moves and completely shut it down.</p> <p><strong>Defog</strong>: Defog users are able to get rid of Klefki's screens and Spikes. Some of them even counter Klefki, such as Zapdos, which cannot be crippled by Thunder Wave and often carries Heat Wave, and Mandibuzz, which can carry Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Powerful wallbreakers such as Gengar can take on Klefki by continually attacking it, even with screens being up; however, they're vulnerable to being crippled by Thunder Wave.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dual Screens (Fairy)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Reflect and Light Screen boost both defenses of the entire team, which they can take advantage of by setting up or doing some serious damage to the opposing team while taking a hit they otherwise wouldn't be able to. Foul Play punishes physical setup sweepers such as Mega Scizor and prevents Klefki from being setup fodder. Thunder Wave can be used over one of Klefki's other utility options, as it has priority thanks to its Prankster ability and can paralyze a lot of fast threats, especially set-up sweepers, and make them easy to revenge kill. Setup sweepers become an issue if you choose to drop Foul Play, however. Spikes can help break Focus Sashes such as Breloom's and can also stack with other entry hazards, allowing your other Pokemon to have an easier time cleaning up.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full investment in HP is used to maximize Klefki's bulk, and the Defense investment with a Bold nature allow it to take on Mega Scizor better as well as other Steel-types, which are most often physical. Light Clay increases the duration of Reflect and Light Screen. Prankster gives Klefki's utility moves +1 priority, making them much more effective.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Klefki is an amazing lead that's able to get up screens and stack Spikes early on. It can switch into many threats such as Scizor and Mega Gardevoir thanks to its great defensive typing. It can pivot into Poison-type attacks to give teammates a safe switch in as well. When on the field, its main job is to set up screens and paralyze the foe, which it can do against many Pokemon. Fairy-type teams are generally pretty slow, so spreading paralysis would alleviate the Speed woes. Klefki should be kept relatively healthy so it can set up screens if they're not up. Its health should mostly be preserved in matchups where there is a Mega Scizor so it can take it on with Foul Play. It can also be an emergency check to dangerous set-up sweepers by crippling them with Thunder Wave or setting up screens, allowing another Pokemon to survive an attack and take it out. It can't do its job as effectively against Pokemon it's weak to, as they're most often able to 2HKO it even through screens. The most it can do against Ground-type Pokemon is set up screens, as they're immune to Thunder Wave and therefore cannot be crippled by Klefki.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Azumarill and Slurpuff are the Pokemon that can take advantage of Klefki's ability to set up screens the most, as they're both Belly Drum sweepers. Azumarill also threatens Ground-type Pokemon, which wall Klefki, and can check Fire-types including Heatran, which is very annoying for Fairy-types to face. If Klefki isn't running Foul Play, Pokemon that can check Mega Scizor such as Unaware Clefable with Flamethrower and Babiri Berry Togekiss are great partners. Togekiss appreciates Klefki's resistances to Ice and Rock, as well as its immunity to Poison and neutrality to Steel like all Fairy-types do, while Klefki takes advantage of Togekiss's Ground immunity. Clefable can reliably set up with Calm Mind under screens, as it's nearly impossible to 2HKO. Strong wallbreakers like Mega Diancie, Mega Gardevoir, and Choice Specs Sylveon become dangerous with the screen support Klefki can provide. Mega Diancie also puts a lot of offensive pressure on Fire-types, which threaten Klefki.</p>"

  "Diancie": {
    "overview": "<h3>Rock</h3> <p>Diancie is the best Trick Room setter on Rock, as well as a decent Stealth Rock setter, and it performs well as both a bulky attacker and Trick Room sweeper thanks to its decent attacking stats and magnificent 50 / 150 / 150 bulk; on the other hand, Mega Diancie is a great mixed attacker with the ability to OHKO many threatening Pokemon in the Monotype metagame thanks to its spectacular attacking stats and Speed, as well as decent 50 / 110 / 110 bulk. On Rock teams, Mega Diancie is one of the best wallbreakers due to its mixed STAB attacks, Diamond Storm and Moonblast. Its Fairy typing also makes it a great offensive check to most Fighting-types, and it outspeeds most of them too; it puts offensive pressure on Dragon teams too because it prevents them from using their Dragon-type attacks against Rock teams reliably. Mega Diancie is also a decent stallbreaker as well due to Magic Bounce, as it can reflect status moves and damage most status users with its attacks. However, while a Rock / Fairy typing is great for Rock teams, it makes Diancie doubly weak to Steel-type moves, of which Bullet Punch is especially threatening. Diancie's awful base 50 Speed also means that it almost always needs to use Protect upon Mega Evolving to guarantee that it can survive until the next turn to begin sweeping.</p> <h3>Fairy</h3> <p>Upon Mega Evolving, Diancie gains amazing Attack and Special Attack combined with a great Speed stat, making it a dangerous mixed attacking threat to many teams. However, it loses some of its bulk. Its Fairy / Rock typing gives it key resistances to Fire and Flying, and allows it to hit every type except Steel for at least neutral damage, but it does give it weaknesses to Water, Ground, Grass, and Steel. It can, however, run a move to hit Steel-types with in Hidden Power Fire or Earth Power. Mega Diancie has access to a very reliable Fairy-type STAB attack in Moonblast, as well as a Rock-type STAB move in Diamond Storm, which allows it to check Fire- and Flying-types. It also has access to setup moves such as Calm Mind and Rock Polish, but running one of those means it has to sacrifice Protect. Despite its great Speed, Mega Diancie has a weakness to some priority moves such as Bullet Punch and Aqua Jet. Its Magic Bounce ability allows it to reflect status moves such as Thunder Wave and Toxic, as well as entry hazards. Before Mega Evolving, Diancie's Speed is very low, so it has to rely on Protect to get the boost in Speed. Although Mega Diancie has decent Defense and Special Defense, its HP is very low, which means it can't take non-resisted hits that well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Rock</h4> <p>Explosion can be used on Diancie as a last resort to deal as much damage to the foe as possible before Diancie's KOed. Calm Mind or Rock Polish can be used over Protect on Mega Diancie, as they make it into a potent sweeper. However, the loss of Protect could result in Diancie getting KOed while Mega Evolving or after it Mega Evolves due to the inability to scout for moves. Hidden Power Fire allows Mega Diancie to break Skarmory and KO offensive Mega Scizor on the switch, but losing better coverage is annoying, and Protect is very hard to give up.</p> <h4>Fairy</h4> <p>Mega Diancie can use Stealth Rock over Protect if preferring to run a Calm Mind variant of Clefable rather than a support one, but it really needs the safe Mega Evolution. It can also use a setup move such as Calm Mind or Rock Polish over Protect, but its Speed and wallbreaking capabilities are already very solid so it's better off running Protect to always get a safe Mega Evolution, as well as stall out sand turns against Ground-type teams. Hidden Power Ice is an option to lure in and KO Gliscor and Landorus. A non-Mega Diancie can be used on Trick Room Fairy teams as a lead Trick Room setter with Stealth Rock and Explosion.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Rock</h4> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Revenge killers like Choice Scarf Terrakion, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Swift Swim Kingdra can come in and OHKO Mega Diancie with Close Combat, Earthquake, or Scald. Swift Swim Kingdra specifically is a threat because even after its Speed is lowered by Sticky Web, it still outspeeds Mega Diancie. Mega Scizor can OHKO Mega Diancie with Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Mixed Walls</strong>: Porygon2 is barely 4HKOed by both Diamond Storm and Moonblast and is 5HKOed by Earth Power, and even after taking Stealth Rock damage, it is still not guaranteed to get 3HKOed by Mega Diancie. Chansey takes laughable damage from Moonblast, as it is barely 6HKOed by the move, even after Stealth Rock, and it can 3HKO Mega Diancie with Seismic Toss. Mew isn't even 3HKOed by any of Mega Diancie's moves after Stealth Rock and can PP stall it with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mega Scizor OHKOes Mega Diancie with Bullet Punch and can set up on Diancie with Swords Dance and continue to OHKO it with Bullet Punch. Excadrill and Jirachi both OHKO Diancie and Mega Diancie with Iron Head. Heatran OHKOes Mega Diancie with Flash Cannon and 2HKOes Diancie, and Choice Scarf Magnezone OHKOes both with Flash Cannon.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Manaphy survives any hit from Mega Diancie and OHKOes it in return with Scald, and Manaphy it also sets up on Diancie with Tail Glow and continues to OHKO it. Azumarill's Aqua Jet OHKOes Mega Diancie, and its Waterfall 2HKOes Diancie. Starmie OHKOes Mega Diancie with Hydro Pump and 2HKOes Diancie with it. Volcanion survives an Earth Power and Diamond Storm from Mega Diancie and OHKOes it in return, and it 2HKOes Diancie with Steam Eruption. Mega Sharpedo can gain the Speed boost on the first turn and proceed to OHKO Mega Diancie with Waterfall. Swampert can OHKO Mega Diancie with Earthquake and 2HKO it with Scald, 2HKOing or 3HKOing non-Mega Diancie with the same moves.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Landorus OHKOes both Diancie and Mega Diancie with Earth Power. Landorus-T OHKOes Mega Diancie and 2HKOes Diancie with Earthquake. Gastrodon 2HKOes Mega Diancie with both Earthquake and Earth Power and can survive repeated hits from both formes. Seismitoad OHKOes Mega Diancie with Earth Power and 2HKOes Diancie with it. Garchomp OHKOes Mega Diancie with Earthquake on the switch and 2HKOes Diancie with it and survives a Moonblast; Choice Scarf Garchomp outspeeds and KOes both formes. Mega Garchomp 2HKOes regular Diancie with Earthquake; however, Mega Diancie outspeeds and KOes Garchomp with Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Ferrothorn survives any hit from Mega Diancie and OHKOes it with either Power Whip or Gyro Ball and 2HKOes Diancie with Power Whip. Mega Venusaur isn't even 3HKOed by any move Mega Diancie throws at it and OHKOes Mega Diancie and 2HKOes Diancie with Giga Drain. Breloom can come in on weakened Mega Diancie and KO it with Mach Punch. Mega Diancie is 2HKOed by Cradily's Giga Drain, and Diancie is 3HKOed. Serperior outspeeds and OHKOes Mega Diancie with Leaf Storm and has a chance to OHKO Diancie when unboosted. Rotom-C takes any hit from both Diancie and Mega Diancie and OHKOes them both with Leaf Storm.</p> <h4>Fairy</h4> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Despite Mega Diancie's amazing Attack and access to Diamond Storm, Chansey still counters it very well due to its massive bulk and the fact that Seismic Toss 3HKOs Mega Diancie.</p> <p><strong>Mixed Walls</strong>: Mixed walls such as Mew, Gliscor, and Porygon2 can eat up Mega Diancie's attacks and slowly beat it. In Mew's case, it stalls out Mega Diancie with burn damage from Will-O-Wisp thanks to its Synchronize ability.</p> <p><strong>Scizor</strong>: Both regular Scizor and Mega Scizor always carry Bullet Punch, which OHKOs Mega Diancie, but they can't switch in due to the possibility of Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Excadrill</strong>: On Steel-type teams, Excadrill is almost always running a Choice Scarf, which allows it to outspeed and OHKO Mega Diancie, and on Ground-type teams, Excadrill is a Sand Rush variant, which also lets it outspeed and KO Mega Diancie.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Although Mega Diancie has the coverage to beat some Steel-types, other ones like Iron Head Skarmory, specially defensive Jirachi, Air Balloon Heatran, and Empoleon can potentially beat it. Skarmory and Heatran can only beat it if it's lacking the appropriate coverage move, however, as only Hidden Power Fire variants beat Skarmory, and only Earth Power variants beat Heatran.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Mega Diancie's weakness to Grass leaves it vulnerable to faster or bulky Grass-types such as Serperior, Celebi, and Choice Scarf Rotom-C.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types that either outspeed Mega Diancie or can tank any hit from it such as Starmie, Empoleon, and Choice Scarf Volcanion are good checks due to Mega Diancie's weakness to Water.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Landorus and Hippowdon can survive one attack from Mega Diancie and revenge kill it with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Mega Diancie's poor bulk, faster Pokemon or Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T, Volcanion, and Magnezone can revenge kill it, but they don't switch into Mega Diancie's attacks very well. However, Mega Diancie can use Protect to scout what move Choice Scarf users will lock themselves into and make the appropriate switch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wallbreaker (Rock)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Moonblast is Mega Diancie's primary STAB move, which lets it hit Pokemon on Fighting and Dragon teams super effectively, notably  Breloom and Latios, and also provides decent neutral coverage. Diamond Storm is Mega Diancie's other STAB move, letting it hit Fire-, Bug-, Flying-, and Ice-types like Volcarona, Mega Pinsir, Mega Charizard Y, and Weavile super effectively, and, like Moonblast, provides decent neutral coverage. Mega Pinsir is an important Pokemon to hit, as after a Swords Dance, it's really threatening to Rock teams. Earth Power lets Mega Diancie hit opposing Electric-, Rock-, and Steel-types that can possibly threaten it or its teammates, such as Magnezone, opposing Mega Diancie, and Heatran. Protect lets Diancie safely Mega Evolve and allows it to scout the foe's moves and for potential Choice item users.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Clear Body lets Diancie switch into Intimidate and Sticky Web before Mega Evolving. Magic Bounce is the ability Diancie obtains after Mega Evolving, which lets it switch into any possible Klefki, Whimsicott, or Sableye, as well as most entry hazard setters; Magic Bounce is especially useful because it prevents Mega Diancie from being inflicted with a status ailment. Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment, as well as 4 Attack EVs and a Naive nature, allow Mega Diancie to hit as hard and as fast as possible. A Naive nature is preferred over a Hasty one because it guarantees that Mega Diancie will never get OHKOed by Mega Lopunny's High Jump Kick.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If you haven't Mega Evolved Diancie yet, switch it in on any potential Intimidate switch-ins, Mementos, or stat-lowering moves. Use Mega Diancie to wallbreak early-game to help set up a late-game sweep from a teammate. Try preserving Mega Diancie's health so it can sweep late-game after faster threats have been removed or Sticky Web is up and the opposing team is weakened. For example, Mega Diancie can potentially sweep Fighting teams quickly after Sticky Web is set up. It is recommended to use Protect while Mega Evolving to prevent any severe damage loss, even if Diancie will outspeed the foe on the first turn, to prevent it from taking any excessive damage. Try to Mega Evolve early-game to prevent entry hazard setters from getting entry hazards up on your side thanks to Magic Bounce. Rather than switching in on attacks, switch Mega Diancie in on various status users like Sableye to bounce the status ailments back, as those are more reliable opportunities to switch in safely.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Diancie appreciates the sand that Tyranitar provides with Sand Stream because of the boost in Special Defense that sand gives to make up for a Naive nature; Assault Vest Tyranitar specifically is a good specially defensive wall that can pivot into attacks intended to hit Mega Diancie. In return, Tyranitar appreciates Mega Diancie's ability to take care of Fighting-types. Cradily can absorb Grass- and Water-type attacks for Mega Diancie and use Toxic to wear down walls that Mega Diancie can't break, and physically defensive Cradily is good to take on Mega Gyarados, because regular Gyarados's Intimidate lowers Mega Diancie's Attack, which allows it to survive a Diamond Storm after Mega Evolving. Omastar appreciates Mega Diancie's wallbreaking help, as it allows Omastar to switch in and set up on weakened teams. Mega Diancie appreciates Shuckle's ability to set up Stealth Rock and Sticky Web and drain the HP and PP of bulky and threatening Pokemon with Toxic and Encore, respectively; Sticky Web is especially important, as it lets Mega Diancie become a major threat to Fighting teams. Rhyperior is an outstanding teammate because it can survive multiple Bullet Punches from Scizor and Mega Scizor due to its great bulk and access to Solid Rock, making it almost a required teammate for Mega Diancie. Choice Band Terrakion is a good teammate because it takes care of walls that Mega Diancie cannot, such as Porygon2, Skarmory, and Chansey. All of Mega Diancie's teammates appreciate its ability to reflect status and entry hazards.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Attacker (Rock)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room lets Diancie and its teammates easily outspeed and KO a plethora of foes. Moonblast is Diancie's primary STAB move, letting it hit Pokemon on Fighting and Dragon teams like Breloom and Latios super effectively and providing decent neutral coverage. Diamond Storm lets Diancie hit Bug-, Flying-, and Ice-types like Mega Pinsir, Volcarona, Mega Charizard Y, and Weavile super effectively and also provides decent neutral coverage. Earth Power lets Diancie hit opposing Electric-, Rock-, and Steel-types that can possibly threaten it or its teammates like Magnezone, Mega Diancie, and Heatran. Stealth Rock is an alternative to Trick Room and lets Diancie support its teammates by allowing them to get easier KOs, and it annoys the opponent by causing their Pokemon to take residual damage. However, Stealth Rock is better used on teammates like Shuckle if possible for more reliability on slower Rock teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers provides Diancie with a reliable form of passive recovery. Clear Body grants Diancie with an immunity to Intimidate and various stat-lowering moves. A Quiet nature, alongside maximum Special Attack investment and 252 HP EVs, allows Diancie to survive as many hits as possible while still maintaining a decent offensive presence. Use a Relaxed nature and an EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD if you're running Stealth Rock on Diancie; this allows it to make use of both its offensive and its defensive stats.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Setting up Trick Room as early as possible is key to allow for as much fast attacking as possible on slower Rock teams. Try to use Diancie as a switch-in to Intimidate or any other stat-lowering conditions that are applicable. Avoid Steel-type attacks as much as possible, as Diancie is 4x weak to Steel. If you're running Stealth Rock over Trick Room on Diancie, take advantage of its ability to bluff a Mega Diancie set to force switches to allow for more opportunities to set up. This Diancie set can be used to switch into resisted attacks; however, be careful while doing so, as chip damage makes it more difficult for Diancie to reliably set up Trick Room throughout the match. Try to set up Trick Room against more passive Pokemon mid-game to keep Diancie healthy enough to repeatedly set it up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>All slow Rock-types appreciate Diancie's ability to set up Trick Room, as most of them benefit from it. The team should not be focused entirely on Trick Room, as Diancie is the only viable Rock-type with access to the move, so once it's KOed, the team loses out on future uses. Tyranitar is a good teammate because it provides Diancie with sand, which gives it more special bulk. In return, Tyranitar appreciates Diancie's ability to get rid of Fighting-types. Cradily can absorb Grass- and Water-type attacks for Diancie to help it survive longer. Mega Aggron is immune to Poison-type moves, resists Steel-type moves, and has Filter to take care of Ground-types, making it perfect to deal with threats like Scizor for Diancie. Diancie appreciates Shuckle's ability to set up Stealth Rock and Sticky Web and drain the HP and PP of bulky and threatening Pokemon with Toxic and Encore, respectively; however, Shuckle's Sticky Web can backfire on Trick Room Diancie teams, as the Pokemon might be slow enough after switching into Sticky Web to outspeed Diancie under Trick Room. Terrakion is a nice wallbreaking teammate that operates well outside of Trick Room, giving your team a useful Pokemon for when Diancie cannot set it up.</p>"
      },
      "All-out Attacker (Fairy)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Moonblast is Mega Diancie's strongest Fairy-type attack and does a lot of damage to most Pokemon that don't resist it due to Mega Diancie's amazing Special Attack. It's great for hitting Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Dragon-types such as Mega Garchomp. Diamond Storm is Mega Diancie's secondary STAB move, which is very useful for hitting Bug-, Flying-, and Fire-types such as Mega Pinsir, Zapdos, and Volcanion, as well as specially defensive walls. Hidden Power Fire hits Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Scizor on the switch, but it misses out on hitting Heatran. Alternatively, Earth Power can be used for hitting non-Air Balloon Heatran, although Diamond Storm deals with any offensive variants of Heatran pretty well and hitting Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Scizor is more important. Protect allows Diancie to safely Mega Evolve and gain its base 110 Speed, as well as scout for which move Choice-locked Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Diggersby will go for.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full investment in Speed with a Hasty nature allows Mega Diancie to be as fast as possible. 20 EVs in Attack allows Mega Diancie to almost always 2HKO offensive Heatran with Diamond Storm. The remaining EVs go into Special Attack to increase the damage output of Mega Diancie's special moves and allow Mega Diancie to OHKO offensive Mega Scizor with Hidden Power Fire. A Hasty nature allows Mega Diancie to always survive Sludge Wave from Life Orb Gengar and Thunderbolt from Life Orb Thundurus after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>In pretty much every matchup, Diancie should Mega Evolve as soon as possible so it can prevent entry hazards from going up and status from being spread. It's guaranteed to get off a safe Mega Evolution with Protect, although that's very predictable and can be taken advantage of. Mega Diancie can use Protect to its advantage in any point of the game to scout Choice item-using foes and stall out weather such as sand against Ground teams with Hippowdon and Excadrill, rain against Swift Swim Water teams, and sun against Mega Charizard Y teams. Mega Diancie should be used to wallbreak early-game in some matchups such as against Flying, Bug, and Water so one of its teammates can clean up late-game. However, it can also serve as a late-game cleaner itself in matchups such as against Fighting and Dragon if faster threats have been removed, and as a result, needs to be kept healthy. Due to its lack of recovery and poor bulk, switching it in on strong attackers should be avoided. Mega Diancie can take advantage of its Magic Bounce ability and get free switches to bounce back entry hazards and status moves from passive Pokemon like Shuckle and Sableye. In matchups such as against Flying and Grass, revealing Hidden Power Fire early should be avoided to potentially lure in and KO Pokemon such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn, which wall Mega Diancie if it's not running Hidden Power Fire. Despite Mega Diancie's great wallbreaking capabilities, it's threatened by mixed walls such as Porygon2.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Klefki is a great partner for Mega Diancie because of its ability to set up Reflect and Light Screen, which let Mega Diancie take hits better, set up Spikes, which let Mega Diancie wallbreak a lot more easily, spread paralysis, which Mega Diancie appreciates, and serve as a semi-reliable check to Mega Scizor if it's running Foul Play. Klefki also has an immunity to Poison and takes neutral damage from Steel-type attacks, which make it valuable for any Fairy-type team. Clefable also has the ability to spread paralysis with Thunder Wave, but it can also set up Stealth Rock to potentially put the foe in range of Mega Diancie's attacks. An Unaware variant of Clefable can serve as a reliable check to Mega Scizor, while a Calm Mind variant can serve as a sweeper that benefits from Mega Diancie's ability to get rid of Zapdos and Skarmory. Azumarill's physical wallbreaking capabilities allow it to get past specially defensive walls that may be an issue for Mega Diancie. Azumarill is also capable of dealing with Heatran and Empoleon, which are potential threats to Mega Diancie. Its access to Knock Off allows it to cripple Chansey and Porygon2, as well as hit Mew, all of which are great counters to Mega Diancie. Azumarill also appreciates Mega Diancie's ability to get rid of Pokemon such as Volcanion and Skarmory, which threaten its Belly Drum sweep. Togekiss has a Ground immunity, which helps Mega Diancie's Ground weakness. Another valuable thing that Togekiss possesses is the ability to threaten Steel-types with its access to Fire Blast and Aura Sphere, which it does more effectively when holding a Babiri Berry. Togekiss appreciates Mega Diancie's ability to bounce back Stealth Rock due to its weakness to Rock. A Nasty Plot variant of Togekiss can break through walls such as Mew, Porygon2, and Chansey, which Mega Diancie has issues dealing with. Choice Specs Sylveon is a great partner for Mega Diancie because it can break Pokemon such as Mew and Gliscor. Sylveon and Mega Diancie can split the coverage between themselves, as Mega Diancie can run Earth Power for hitting Heatran, while Sylveon can use Hidden Power Fire to hit the likes of Scizor and Ferrothorn. Choice Scarf Gardevoir is a solid partner due to its Trace ability, which lets it check Sand Rush Excadrill and Swift Swim Kingdra. Gardevoir is also able to check Poison-types such as Nidoking and Mega Venusaur, which threaten Mega Diancie, although physically defensive variants of Mega Venusaur almost never get 2HKOed by Gardevoir's Psyshock. Gardevoir's access to Healing Wish allows Mega Diancie to be played more recklessly and be healed up later in the game. Whimsicott is another great partner for Mega Diancie because it checks two of its weaknesses in Water and Ground thanks to its Grass typing. It can also use Encore against setup sweepers, such as Mega Scizor and Volcarona, and spread paralysis with Stun Spore.</p>"

  "Volcanion": {
    "overview": "<h3>Water</h3> <p>Volcanion's unique Fire / Water typing brings several advantages to the table for Water teams. Its half Fire typing allows it to revenge kill most Grass-types that threaten Water, including Whimsicott and Serperior. It also gives Water a Fairy-type switch-in other than Empoleon. Furthermore, it effectively checks Bug-types, which are very threatening to Water teams. Its stats are generally good as well; its decent 80 / 120 / 90 bulk, decent Speed for its bulk, very high Special Attack, and good Attack make it a premier choice on Water teams. Volcanion is able to run a range of sets, such as Choice Scarf, Choice Specs, Assault Vest, and even defensive. Its Choice Scarf set provides it with Speed and allows it to revenge kill Mega Diancie, Gengar, Serperior, and Galvantula. Its most powerful set, Choice Specs, makes it a threatening wallbreaker that is able to break past defensive Grass cores with Fire Blast. It's also immune to Will-O-Wisp and functions as a Scald switch-in thanks to Water Absorb, providing great support for its teammates. One of its most notable traits is its ability to 2HKO Mega Venusaur, which walls Water teams.</p> <p>However, Volcanion is quite slow and is outsped and threatened by Hoopa-U, Gyarados, and Mamoswine; even with a Choice Scarf, it's outsped by Mega Lopunny and Mega Manectric. It also can't take full advantage of its good Attack stat due to lacking a physical Water-type STAB move, and it's weak to common attacking types in Electric, Rock, and Ground. Due to lacking reliable recovery, it can get worn down very easily. Finally, it is weak to Stealth Rock and therefore requires Defog and Rapid Spin support if it wants to switch in and out more often.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Water</h4> <p>A specially defensive RestTalk set can be used with Steam Eruption and Flamethrower to effectively cripple physical attackers, spread burns easily, and switch into Grass-type attacks. A defensive variant of this set can be used to serve as a Breloom switch-in. Assault Vest can be used for more special bulk. The downside of said sets, however, is that Volcanion lacks power with them, which it really cannot afford to give up. Life Orb, while making Volcanion slightly weaker, allows it to switch between moves, which can be very useful. Hidden Power Ice can be used to prevent Dragon-types from walling Volcanion, though it's weak and doesn't hit anything else that Volcanion's other coverage moves already deal with. Expert Belt can be used to bluff Choice Specs and give Volcanion the freedom to switch between moves; however, it doesn't give Volcanion a reliable boost in power. Air Balloon gives Volcanion an immunity to Ground to mitigate its weakness and give Water another Ground-immune Pokemon. Finally, a Choice Scarf set that utilizes a Modest nature can be used to outspeed base 110 Speed Pokemon and Serperior. However, Volcanion is slower than Weavile, Raikou, Mega Pidgeot, and Alakazam if it runs this.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Water</h4> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Chansey's incredibly high Special Defense allows it to tank all of Volcanion's moves with ease while it recovers its health with Soft-Boiled and cripples Volcanion with Toxic or Thunder Wave or sets up Stealth Rock. Jellicent is immune to Steam Eruption thanks to Water Absorb and can also cripple Volcanion with Toxic. Due to the Choice Scarf set lacking as much power as the Choice Specs set, Pokemon like Cradily and Gastrodon are also threats.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types such as Latias and Latios resist all of Volcanion's coverage moves; Latias and Latios can use Roost to heal off the damage they take and can wear Volcanion down with Psyshock or a coverage move. Garchomp can fire off super effective Earthquakes and OHKO Volcanion before it even has a chance to attack.</p> <p><strong>Faster Super Effective Attackers</strong>: Pokemon that carry super effective coverage moves and are faster than Volcanion pose a threat to it. Rock-type coverage from the likes of Mega Diancie, Electric-type coverage from the likes of Raikou and Mega Manectric, and Ground-type coverage from Excadrill and Garchomp are all threatening to Volcanion.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Due to Volcanion's lack of reliable recovery, it is worn down extremely fast by entry hazards, most notably Stealth Rock, due to its typing, and Toxic Spikes, due to the accumulating damage from Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Jellicent, Slowbro, and Gastrodon all wall the Choice Scarf set and any non-Hidden Power Grass variant and can cripple Volcanion by inflicting it with a status condition.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Despite Steam Eruption's low PP, it is chosen over Scald due to its insane power, which can cripple the foe and allow Volcanion to muscle past and beat some of its counters. Sludge Wave hits certain Fairy-types such as Azumarill, which would otherwise switch into Volcanion with ease, and Gardevoir, whose ability Trace allows it to copy Water Absorb and become immune to Steam Eruption. Fire Blast is Volcanion's secondary STAB move, while slightly inaccurate, and hits Ferrothorn, which doesn't take much from Volcanion's other moves and can otherwise set up entry hazards with ease. It also hits Grass- and Bug-types, preventing them from safely switching into Volcanion. Rock Slide is used to hit Mega Charizard Y, one of Water's biggest threats.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Volcanion checks a lot of threats to Water teams, including Breloom, Serperior, and Mega Charizard Y. With it, Volcanion is able to outspeed Thundurus and +1 Dragonite, as well as Weavile. 40 EVs are put into Attack so that Volcanion gets the guaranteed KO on Mega Charizard Y with Rock Slide. The remaining EVs are put into Speed and Special Attack for speed and power. A Naive nature is chosen over Timid to boost the power of Rock Slide; it is also chosen over a Hasty nature to help Volcanion take physical priority moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because this set functions as a revenge killer, it's vital that you keep Volcanion as healthy as possible and not let it get worn down by status ailments or entry hazards. Otherwise, it becomes vulnerable to being revenge killed itself. Steam Eruption's PP is limited, so using the move sparingly is important and helps you spread burns more efficiently. Use Volcanion's other coverage moves when necessary: use Sludge Wave against Azumarill and Breloom to reliably take them out, and against Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y, use Rock Slide. Send Volcanion out early-game to spread a few burns with Steam Eruption and weaken checks with Fire Blast, as well as to use its coverage to deal with threats to your team. You can also send it out late-game to clean up after its teammates have done the hole punching.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock support from Swampert and Empoleon is appreciated to break opposing Focus Sashes and allow Volcanion to safely check Breloom without the fear of it taking a hit. Volcanion appreciates hazard removal to assuage its Stealth Rock weakness, so Starmie, Tentacruel, and Empoleon are good partners. Tentacruel also provides Toxic Spikes support, Empoleon can take on some Dragon-types for Volcanion, and Starmie is Water's best offensive spinner. Lanturn and Swampert are good partners too, as they help mitigate Volcanion's Electric weakness, with the former also being able to cleanse Volcanion of status. It can also help spread burns with Scald, allowing Volcanion to save up Steam Eruption's PP. Physically defensive walls like Swampert, Slowbro, and Rotom-W, which can also spread burns, are appreciated to take Earthquakes for Volcanion. Gyarados is a good partner in a similar manner, as it can switch into Ground-type moves thanks to its immunity to them. Azumarill can help Volcanion deal with the Dragon-types it fails to touch. Rotom-W and Lanturn both are able to bring Volcanion in through slow Volt Switch, thus generating momentum. Mega Gyarados and Mega Sharpedo appreciate Volcanion's ability to deal with Fairy- and Grass-types.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Steam Eruption is Volcanion's best STAB move thanks to its high Base Power, accuracy, and chance to burn, which is extremely useful to cripple the foe. Despite its low PP, its ability to decimat Pokemon that don't resist Water is highly beneficial. Sludge Wave hits Fairy-types for super effective damage, though it is not the only move used to do so; Fire Blast can be used against Klefki and Steam Eruption KOes Mega Diancie, preventing any Fairy-type from safely switching into Volcanion. Fire Blast is another powerful STAB move, hitting Bug- and Grass-types, most notably Ferrothorn. Ground-types immune to Water are the only Pokemon not hit neutrally by the above moves, so Hidden Power Grass is a viable coverage option. Alternatively, Earth Power can be used to hit opposing Volcanion, but it doesn't really offer unique coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Specs turns Volcanion into a threatening wallbreaker, giving it immense power and the ability to destroy teams. Maximum Speed EVs alongside a Timid nature are used so that Volcanion Speed ties with Breloom, a huge threat to Water. However, a Modest nature can be used for extra power, though Volcanion will be unable to Speed tie with Breloom and fails to outspeed Adamant Mega Scizor and Diggersby.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Volcanion in on passive Pokemon that can't do much to it, such as Skarmory, and begin firing off attacks. Do not switch Volcanion in on strong attackers, as it becomes difficult to wallbreak at low HP. Instead, get it in on free switches or through a slow Volt Switch or U-turn. You can also switch it in on predicted Scalds or Will-O-Wisps aimed at a partner such as Azumarill. Be conscious of what move you click; don't use up all of Steam Eruption's PP to take out a Pokemon that can be dealt with using a different coverage move, as PP is limited and therefore should be preserved to deal with more important threats. Volcanion has an easy time against physical walls, so they should be Volcanion's main targets to eliminate. Make sure you play wisely when up against teams carrying Pokemon immune to one of Volcanion's coverage moves, as being locked into a move that deals no damage to the foe is useless and saps a lot of momentum. For example, against Steel, instead of using Fire Blast—if they are carrying a Heatran on their team—use Steam Eruption in case they switch into it. Send Volcanion out early-game to punch as many holes in the opposing team as possible and break through bulky cores such as Slowbro + Mew, since spreading burns early-game creates opportunities for a setup sweeper to set up and sweep later on.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As with any hazard-weak Pokemon, entry hazard removal is mandatory and highly appreciated by Volcanion to allow it to switch in and out of the field easily. This can be provided by Empoleon, which provides Stealth Rock as a bonus. Starmie and Tentacruel also provide Rapid Spin support. Hazard support from Swampert in the form of Stealth Rock, which also provides an Electric immunity, and Tentacruel in the form of Toxic Spikes is appreciated to break Focus Sashes and ease wallbreaking. Volcanion breaks through physically defensive walls, so setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Mega Gyarados and Belly Drum Azumarill make for good partners, as they can easily clean the opposing team late-game. Lanturn and Rotom-W make for good teammates, as they serve as Electric checks and can spread burns with Scald. Lanturn can also use Heal Bell to rid Volcanion of status ailments like poison and paralysis, thus preventing it from being worn down. In addition, Lanturn and Rotom-W can use slow Volt Switches to bring Volcanion in safely. Choice Band Azumarill can break past Chansey which walls Volcanion. Manaphy is a good stallbreaker and can put a lot of pressure on special walls if it has multiple boosts under its belt.</p>"
