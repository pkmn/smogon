Psyshock lets Cresselia threaten Pheromosa, Nihilego, Naganadel, and Galarian Zapdos. Moonlight provides Cresselia with recovery, allowing it to outlast foes such as Indeedee, Volcanion, and Tapu Lele. Ice Beam hits Zygarde, Landorus, Rillaboom, and Landorus-T. Icy Wind is a weaker alternative that provides speed control. Trick Room allows Cresselia and its teammates to move before faster foes. Helping Hand allows damaging partners like Diancie and Volcanion to OHKO Galarian Moltres and Assault Vest Rillaboom. Protect is an effective answer to Fake Out, allowing Cresselia to safely set Trick Room on turn 2. The Special Defense EVs ensure Cresselia survives a +1 Bug Buzz from Life Orb Genesect, while the Defense investment allows it to deal with physical attackers like Rillaboom better. Using a Calm nature is optimal for sets without Trick Room, while sets opting for Trick Room should use a Sassy nature to ensure Cresselia is as slow as possible.</p> <p>Cresselia is found on slow, bulky teams that appreciate Trick Room's or Icy Wind's speed control and Cresselia's ability to outlast foes. Fire-types such as Incineroar, Heatran, and Volcanion are great partners, since they deal with the Steel-types that Cresselia struggles against such as Genesect and Metagross. Volcanion in particular also defeats Incineroar. In return, Cresselia can deal with Landorus, Landorus-T, and Zygarde with Ice Beam or Icy Wind. Rock-types such as Diancie and Rhyperior also make fantastic partners, as they can defeat Incineroar and Galarian Moltres. In return, Cresselia can threaten Zygarde, Landorus, and Landorus-T with Ice Beam.</p>"

        "description": "<p>In 2v2 Doubles, Tyranitar primarily plays the role of a Tailwind beneficiary. Its convenient Speed tier, high Attack stat, and good coverage moves allow it to OHKO many prevalent Pokemon such as Pheromosa, Genesect, Naganadel, and Kyurem-B. Its typing allows it to deal with metagame staples such as Victini and Incineroar defensively. Secondarily, it provides utility by targeting the main redirectors in Indeedee-F and Togekiss, as well as negating foes' Berries with Unnerve—this is very important in 2v2 Doubles due to many Pokemon like Zygarde, Kyurem-B, Indeedee-F, and Togekiss using Berries. Crunch allows Tyranitar to OHKO the incredibly bulky Indeedee-F, while Stone Edge OHKOes Togekiss. Fire Punch allows Tyranitar to reliably OHKO Pheromosa and Genesect. Rock Slide also OHKOes Pheromosa while ignoring redirection, but in turn does less to Genesect. 252 Speed EVs allow Tyranitar to outspeed Pheromosa in Tailwind.</p> <p>Tyranitar's Unnerve allows Pheromosa to OHKO Chople Berry Kyurem-B and Tanga Berry Indeedee-F. Genesect is similarly able to OHKO Tanga Berry Indeedee with the help of Unnerve. Tyranitar's ability to OHKO two of the metagame's best Follow Me users helps teammates that struggle against redirection such as Dracovish and Naganadel. Tyranitar benefits from Talonflame's Gale Wings Tailwind, or from other fast Tailwind setters such as Naganadel, since Tyranitar outspeeds Pheromosa, Genesect, Kyurem-B, Naganadel, and Cinderace under Tailwind and OHKOes them all. Tyranitar pairs especially well with Talonflame, which can OHKO threats to Tyranitar such as Rillaboom and Amoonguss—a redirection user that Tyranitar cannot OHKO. Tyranitar also pairs well with redirection, since it has many common weaknesses. For this reason, Indeedee-F, Togekiss, and Amoonguss are all good partners.</p>"

Weavile has the second-fastest Fake Out behind Zeraora, allowing it to almost always outspeed opposing Fake Out users. Icicle Crash is Weavile's main source of damage, picking up OHKOs on Galarian Moltres, Naganadel, and Regidrago. Triple Axel is a stronger STAB move, bypassing the effects of Yache Berry to pick up the OHKO on Zygarde, but is less consistent due to its lower accuracy. Knock Off is another strong STAB attack, removing items on Pokemon that rely on them like Porygon2 and Cresselia, as well as threatening OHKOs on Mew, Metagross, Victini, and Indeedee-F. Ice Shard allows it to pick up easy KOs on Zygarde and Landorus, as well as clean up anything that may have been weakened. 24 HP EVs minimizes Life Orb recoil, and 232 Speed with a Jolly nature outspeeds Naganadel.</p> <p>Weavile works very well on more offensive teams, as its high Speed and Attack pair well with much of the metagame. Due to Fake Out, Weavile helps slower, offensive allies such as Metagross get an attack off, clearing out threats to Weavile such as Diancie and Tyranitar, and in return Weavile can also remove Ground-type Pokemon that would threaten to KO Metagross. Weavile can also be used well with redirectors like Blastoise and Togekiss, allowing it to easily hit Pokemon that will OHKO your redirector, such as Rillaboom and Metagross. Without redirection, Weavile struggles to handle Pokemon like Zeraora and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, as they will always outspeed and KO it. Other Pokemon that work well as teammates are Water-types such as Blastoise and Tapu Fini that help deal with opposing Fire-types, as well as Fairy-type Pokemon like Tapu Fini and Togekiss to deal with Fighting-type Pokemon. Another solid teammate is Galarian Zapdos, which is able to clear out Rock- and Steel-types, as well as dissuade Intimidate users such as Incineroar. Due to Weavile's poor bulk and defensive typing, it is incredibly weak to Pokemon that outspeed it. Pokemon like Regieleki, Zeraora, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele make it extremely difficult for Weavile to get any attacks off, so Weavile can also benefit from immediate Tailwind support from Talonflame, which can also help deal with Fire-, Steel-, and Fighting-type Pokemon, especially hitting Pheromosa with a priority Brave Bird thanks to Gale Wings.</p>"

However, they can still be outspeed and KOed with proper speed control.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Naganadel, Latios, Regidrago, and Kyurem-B each resist Volcanion's STAB attacks; they each hit it hard in return with their respective STAB moves.</p>",

Steam Eruption is Volcanion's most consistent STAB move, hitting metagame staples like Incineroar and Landorus super effectively, as well as threatening other physical attackers like Dracovish and Galarian Zapdos with a burn. Heat Wave allows Volcanion to hit Pokemon that resist Steam Eruption such as Ferrothron and Kyurem-B while also KOing common threats such as Genesect and non-Assault Vest Rillaboom. Earth Power can be used to OHKO Naganadel and hit Dracovish and opposing Volcanion harder. Overheat ensures maximum damage output against Pokemon such as Kyurem-B and Wide Guard Celesteela in exchange for being a single target move. Sludge Bomb hits Tapu Fini, Tapu Lele, and Togekiss super effectively, while the poison chance helps break Dracovish. Sitrus Berry maintains Volcanion's longevity., while Wacan Berry is an option to surprise unsuspecting Regieleki and Zeraora and OHKO them. Life Orb can be used if the aforementioned checks are covered to maximize damage.</p> <p>Volcanion's great typing and bulk means that it has few consistent checks outside of Regieleki and Kyurem-B. To patch up these weaknesses, Volcanion is usually paired with Tsareena, Diancie, or Naganadel to eliminate Electric- and Dragon-types. Fake Out pressure from Incineroar or Rillaboom helps cover for Volcanion's low Speed. Zygarde is also an excellent teammate, as it checks Regieleki, Zeraora, and Tyranitar for Volcanion, which in return beats bulky Grass- and Ground-types that hinder Zygarde. Metagross also checks those same Pokemon, while threatening Dragon-types Latios, Regidrago, and Kyurem-B. Tailwind support from Talonflame can beat Nihilego and Landorus which are OHKOed by Steam Eruption. Redirection from Amoonguss enables Volcanion to beat Electric-types and Thunderbolt Genesect.</p>"

Incineroar also enjoys the speed control they provide, and its Intimidate weakens Rillaboom so they do not have to fear Grassy Glide. Bulky setup Pokemon like Celesteela, Cresselia, and Mew appreciate Intimidate supplementing their already tremendous bulk. All three also match up well versus various threats to Incineroar, such as Nihilego, Diancie, Volcanion, and Galarian Zapdos.

Follow Me lets Indeedee-F redirect attacks to itself, an essential strategy in 2v2 Doubles, to keep its hard-hitting partner alive for multiple turns; for example, it can stop Naganadel's Draco Meteor from hitting Zygarde and give Zygarde the opportunity to KO back. Expanding Force is Indeedee-F's best attacking move for cases where extra chip damage might be useful in finishing off the foe. Helping Hand is used when Indeedee-F's partner needs an increase in power to secure a KO on an opposing Pokemon; for example, it allows Choice Scarf Zygarde to secure the KO on Cinderace with Thousand Arrows. Protect is useful on Indeedee-F because the opponent will sometimes focus on Indeedee-F to eliminate the possibility of redirection, so Protect grants it extra survivability. It can also be useful to block a slower Rillaboom's Fake Out in Grassy Terrain. Fake Out can be used instead of Protect as a way to prevent Flying-types from using their first move, which is useful against top-tier threats like Tornadus's Tailwind and Togekiss's Follow Me, and also is useful for when the opponent prevents Indeedee-F's Terrain with Pokemon like Iron Ball Rillaboom. Iron Ball can be used to make Indeedee-F as slow as possible, giving it the best chance that its Terrain will go up after Rillaboom, as Rillaboom loses power and Grassy Glide priority when Grassy Terrain is not active. Imprison can be used to prevent opposing Indeedee-F and Togekiss from using Follow Me.
