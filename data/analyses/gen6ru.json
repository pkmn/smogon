  "Qwilfish": {
    "overview": "<p>Qwilfish possesses a great defensive typing that lets it take on Steel-, Fighting-, and Fire-types such as Hitmonlee and Emboar very efficiently, a neat ability in Intimidate that allows it to neuter many physical attackers, and great utility moves such as Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Thunder Wave. For a defensive Pokemon, Qwilfish sits in a decent Speed tier, outspeeding the likes of Jolly Scrafty and Adamant Emboar. Sadly, Qwilfish has subpar Special Defense and thus cannot take on some specially offensive Water- and Fire-types such as Samurott and Houndoom, which makes this Pokemon a suboptimal option for stall teams. Qwilfish's typing also leaves it vulnerable to common Psychic- and Ground-types such as Meloetta and Flygon. Furthermore, Qwilfish does not have reliable recovery, which makes it very easy to wear down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Qwilfish can choose to run a suicide lead set, with Spikes, Taunt, Explosion, and either Scald or Toxic Spikes to get as many hazards as possible onto the field while opposing enemy leads with Taunt, before finishing its role with Explosion. Haze can be used to halt setup, but Qwilfish generally does not have much room for the move. Pain Split is an alternative for Qwilfish to have a form of recovery, but it is extremely unreliable. Aqua Jet is an option to pick off weakened Fire-types such as Delphox and Houndoom that naturally outspeed Qwilfish.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Eelektross, Rotom-C, and Jolteon are immune to Thunder Wave and can take any hit from Qwilfish. They can then proceed to KO it with their STAB Electric-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Specially offensive Psychic-types such as Sigilyph, Meloetta, and Mesprit can outspeed defensive variants of Qwilfish, take a hit from the lead set, and OHKO both variants with their STAB attacks. Delphox does not like taking a hit from Qwilfish but can outspeed it and OHKO it with Psychic. While physically offensive Psychic-types such as Gallade do not appreciate burns from Scald, they can take any hit from Qwilfish and 2HKO it easily with Zen Headbutt. Defensive Psychic-types such as Xatu, Musharna, and Uxie can wall Qwilfish and heavily dent it with their attacks, and the first can reliably shut down Qwilfish due to Magic Bounce. Slowking is also able to take any hit from Qwilfish and can OHKO it with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Because Qwilfish does not have the best defenses and lacks a form of recovery, it is vulnerable to common wallbreakers. Flygon, Emboar, and Gallade can 2HKO or OHKO Qwilfish with ease when it is weakened.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Rhyperior does not like taking burns from Scald but can heavily dent Qwilfish with Earthquake while surviving any hit. Gastrodon and Seismitoad are immune to Scald and Waterfall due to their abilities and can OHKO Qwilfish with Earth Power.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes wears down the opposing team's Pokemon each time they come in. Taunt is used to stop opposing entry hazard setters from setting up while also shutting down Pokemon such as Alomomola and Dragon Dance Scrafty. In the third moveslot, Scald is preferred if players would like to punish physical attackers even further with burns. Alternatively, Waterfall allows Qwilfish to heavily damage Fire- and Ground-types such as Mega Camerupt and Rhyperior. Poison Jab is an option in order to catch Virizion and Rotom-C on the switch while dealing decent damage to Aromatisse. Thunder Wave is used to cripple Qwilfish's foes and forms a nasty paraflinch combination with Waterfall. Toxic is an alternative to hinder bulkier Pokemon such as Jellicent.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs and 216 Defense EVs are used to maximize Qwilfish's physical bulk. The given Speed investment ensures that Qwilfish outspeeds Jolly Scrafty and Adamant Emboar in order to Taunt them before they can set up. An alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 80 Def / 176 Spe with a Speed-boosting nature is an option in order to outspeed and Taunt Smeargle before it can set up entry hazards or put Qwilfish to sleep. Black Sludge provides Qwilfish with passive recovery and punishes any Trick users that attempt to cripple Qwilfish.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Qwilfish is mainly used on offensively inclined teams, though it also fits on some balance teams. Players should pivot Qwilfish into Fighting-, Fairy-, and Steel-types such as Hitmonlee, Aromatisse, and Registeel, which cannot do much against it. From there, Qwilfish can start setting up Spikes. Preserve Qwilfish for potential setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Scrafty and Bulk Up Gurdurr in order to Taunt them. Do not expose Qwilfish to any status-inflicting moves such as Thunder Wave and Scald, as they can severely cripple it. If there are a decent number of entry hazards on the field already, Qwilfish can proceed to wear down the opposing team with Thunder Wave, Scald, or Waterfall. Qwilfish is also a pretty good Toxic Spikes absorber.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dark-types such as Spiritomb, Sneasel, and Houndoom work well with Qwilfish, as they are able to Pursuit trap Psychic-types, which it loses to. Scrafty in particular is a great partner, as it benefits from not only the entry hazards that Qwilfish provides but also its ability to weaken Fighting- and Fairy-types to ease setup. Specially defensive Rhyperior also makes for a great partner, as they can deal with Exploud, Jolteon, and Meloetta with ease while Qwilfish handles Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee and Emboar that trouble them. Setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Virizion appreciate Qwilfish's entry hazards, which ease setup for them. Because Qwilfish does not have a reliable form of recovery, Wish passers work well with it. For more offensive teams, Jolteon is able to replenish Qwilfish's health, while on more balanced teams, Aromatisse is a great Wish passer. Grass-types such as Venusaur and Rotom-C have great defensive synergy with Qwilfish, as they handle Ground- and Electric-types while Qwilfish can take on Fire-types that annoy them.</p>"

  "Pelipper": {
    "overview": "<p>Pelipper sports a great defensive typing, as it can check Steel-, Fighting-, and Ground-types such as Escavalier, Hitmonlee, and Mega Camerupt, respectively. Furthermore, Pelipper has access to reliable recovery in Roost, which makes it a great defensive pivot. Pelipper also has decent Defense, which, along with Scald, allows it to beat most physical attackers in the tier. Sadly, Pelipper has a nasty 4x weakness to Electric-type attacks, which is particularly problematic against Electric-type Pokemon such as Rotom-C and Jolteon. Pelipper's mediocre Special Defense also does not help it against many special attackers. In addition, Pelipper's role as a Defogger is greatly hindered by its weakness to Stealth Rock, and it faces heavy competition as an entry hazard remover from Flygon, Mantine, and Hitmontop.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic can be used to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Jellicent and Alomomola that Pelipper usually cannot do much against. Knock Off can be used to provide utility for the team, but is very weak. Tailwind can be used to increase the Speed of Pelipper's team. An offensive set with Hydro Pump is usable, as it can take advantage of Pelipper's decent Special Attack, but it is mainly outclassed by other Water-types such as Samurott and Seismitoad. Finally, a set with maximum Special Defense investment with a Bold nature is a viable option to pivot into more offensive teams with ease while still being able to check Fighting-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-type Moves</strong>: Electric-types such as Rotom-C, Lanturn, Magneton, Eelektross, and Jolteon can take a hit from Pelipper and easily OHKO it with their respective Electric-type STAB moves because of Pelipper's 4x weakness to Electric-type. All of them can also generate momentum with Volt Switch if Pelipper opts to switch out. Pokemon that carry Electric-type moves such as Wild Charge Emboar can also greatly damage Pelipper.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Status such as poison and burn can wear down Pelipper rather quickly. Pelipper is forced to take Stealth Rock damage the majority of the time because of its role as a Defogger, which can be a problem given its weakness to it.</p> <p><strong>Jellicent and Alomomola</strong>: Jellicent is one of Pelipper's hardest counters due to its immunity to Scald and the fact that it takes very little damage from Hurricane and U-turn, though it has to be careful of Hurricane confusions. Jellicent can Taunt Pelipper, which prevents it from recovering and removing entry hazards, or burn it with Will-O-Wisp to wear it down. Alomomola does not appreciate Scald burns or Hurricane confusions but takes minimal damage from Pelipper's moves and can proceed to use Toxic to wear it down.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Powerful special attackers such as Meloetta, Flygon, Exploud, and Clawitzer can deal a lot of damage to Pelipper with their respective STAB moves due to Pelipper's subpar Special Defense.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Roost is used to provide longevity and lets Pelipper check physical attackers more reliably. Scald can burn and cripple physical attackers that try to switch into Pelipper. Defog removes annoying entry hazards on both sides of the field and is one of Pelipper's main niches. U-turn is used in the last slot to generate momentum for Pelipper's teammates and to allow Pelipper to switch out of unfavorable situations. Hurricane is an option over U-turn to have a stronger STAB move that hits Grass- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Virizion and Medicham for large amounts of damage, but it has rather low accuracy. Air Slash can be used in the last slot if accuracy on Hurricane is an issue, but it fails to guarantee the 2HKO on Scrafty and does not OHKO Virizion.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers are used to provide passive recovery for Pelipper every turn. Rocky Helmet is an option in order to further punish physical attackers that try to attack Pelipper. Keen Eye is the only ability that should be used, because Rain Dish is incompatible with Defog. The given EV spread with a Bold Nature is used to maximize Pelipper's Defense and the HP EVs grant it the ability to switch into Stealth Rock four times from full health as opposed to three times. A spread of 248 HP / 216 Def / 44 Spe can be used to outspeed uninvested base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Hitmontop. A set with 0 Speed IVs with a Relaxed nature is another option to guarantee that Pelipper can get off a slow U-turn against a majority of the Pokemon in the tier.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>You should not carelessly switch Pelipper into status-inflicting moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave, as these can heavily cripple it. Pelipper should be used as a defensive pivot against Fighting-, Bug-, and Steel-type Pokemon that cannot inflict much damage on it. Pelipper should use Roost when it is low on health in order to check physical attackers more reliably. Pelipper should constantly use Scald against physical attackers to cripple them and support its teammates. It can also use U-turn on predicted switches or to provide momentum for the team if Pelipper faces an unfavorable matchup.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pelipper dislikes status, so clerics such as Roselia and Aromatisse make good partners. The former can deal with Electric- and Water-types that give Pelipper trouble, while Pelipper deals with Steel- and Fire-types that plague Roselia. The latter also appreciates Pelipper's ability to beat Escavlier and Mega Camerupt. Fire-types such as Delphox and Emboar appreciate Pelipper's ability to remove entry hazards for them Ground-types. Rhyperior resists Electric- and Rock-type attacks and can provide Stealth Rock support for Pelipper. Pokemon that are weak to Fighting-type moves, such as Scrafty and Sneasel, greatly benefit from Pelipper's ability to beat Fighting-types and also appreciate Pelipper's ability to generate free switches with U-turn. Wallbreakers such as Exploud appreciate Pelipper's ability to give them a safe switch in via a slow U-turn, while they can easily dent defensive Pokemon that trouble Pelipper. Because Pelipper is very vulnerable to Taunt users such as Qwilfish and Drapion, Pokemon that can heavily pressure them, such as Delphox, Seismitoad, and Flygon, make excellent partners.</p>"

  "Vivillon": {
    "overview": "<p>Vivillon is an offensive Bug / Flying-type that primarily functions as a setup sweeper and a late-game cleaner. Its decent movepool features one of the best boosting moves, Quiver Dance, as well as Hurricane and Sleep Powder. Vivillon's ability Compound Eyes is also very helpful in this regard, boosting the accuracies of these moves. Vivillon also has decent Speed, as without any boosts it can outspeed threats such as Venusaur, Medicham, and Hitmonlee. Because of these traits, Vivillon works best on hyper offensive and bulky offensive builds. Unfortunately, because of Vivillon's typing, it is 4x weak to Stealth Rock and weak to a plethora of common types including Ice, Rock, Fire, Flying, and Electric. Additionally, its low bulk makes almost any neutral attack bring it down to its Focus Sash; thus, it needs entry hazard control to work effectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Endeavor can be used over Energy Ball to wear down Pokemon once Vivillon is at 1% HP; however, Vivillon prefers dual coverage to help with Pokemon that resist Flying. Bug Buzz can be used over Energy Ball to hit Psychic- and Electric-types harder. U-turn can be used to make Vivillon a pivot because the opponent usually won't let their Flying-resistant Pokemon fall asleep; therefore, Vivillon can put another Pokemon to sleep and then U-turn out against their Flying switch-in into something that beats it. Even with all of this, U-turn is reliant on having the proper support and the right matchup to support it; therefore, it is not preferable. Substitute and Leftovers can be used over Energy Ball to function as a mono-attacking sweeper with some insurance against priority users; however, Vivillon needs Focus Sash to function most effectively. Tailwind can possibly be used to assist other Pokemon in sweeping late-game. Finally, Giga Drain can be used over Energy Ball to regain health and to make Focus Sash intact. However, the drop in power is usually not worth it for something this situational.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Priority users can easily pick off Vivillon when it is not at full health, the most threatening being Fletchinder, as its STAB move is super effective and has +1 priority. Sneasel, Mega Glalie, and Piloswine are also threatening priority users because of their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types resist both of Vivillon's moves and can threaten it. In particular, Registeel's high Special Defense makes it a huge threat, and it can inflict status or deal damage to Vivillon with Seismic Toss. Steelix and Bronzong can also effectively check Vivillon, while Escavalier is immune to sleep, isn't 2HKOed by Hurricane, and can KO Vivillon in return.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types are problematic due to them resisting Vivillon's Flying-type STAB moves. Diancie is a specially defensive threat that can take Vivillon's attacks easily and retaliate with Diamond Storm. Aerodactyl and Aggron can beat a +1 Vivillon after it has put a Pokemon to sleep, survive any attack after Stealth Rock damage, and KO back.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Jolteon, Manectric, and Eelektross can all take a hit at +1 and KO due to them resisting Vivillon's Flying-type STAB moves and Energy Ball doing little damage. Magneton, in particular, resists Energy Ball and 4x resists Hurricane, making it an even bigger threat to Vivillon.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Vivillon is 4x weak to Stealth Rock and coming in on it makes it take 50%, rendering Focus Sash useless. Therefore, entry hazards should be cleared before you send out Vivillon.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Quiver Dance allows Vivillon to boost its Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed by 1 stage. Hurricane hits Fighting-, Bug-, and Grass-types super effectively. It also has a decent chance to confuse the foe and a 110 Base Power, which makes it so spammable. Energy Ball hits Rock-, Ground-, and Water-types super effectively and is most important for hitting Rock-types, such as Rhyperior, which resist Hurricane. Finally, Sleep Powder works in conjunction with Quiver Dance to put an opposing Pokemon to sleep, allowing Vivillon to set up easily.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Due to Vivillon being an offensive Pokemon, maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs are used to maximize offensive presence. A Focus Sash is required, as any decently strong attack will bring Vivillon down to 1 HP, and it needs to be able to use Sleep Powder on faster Pokemon to set up. Compound Eyes is the preferred ability, as it increases the accuracy of Sleep Powder and Hurricane. A Timid nature is preferred over Modest to outspeed Timid Rotom-C, Timid Venusaur, Jolly Life Orb Medicham, and maximum Speed Jolly Braviary. Furthermore, a Timid nature also lets Vivillon outspeed Choice Scarf Jolly Medicham, Choice Scarf Jolly Hitmonlee, and Choice Scarf Adamant Flygon at +1, unlike a Modest nature.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Vivillon should not be brought in when Stealth Rock is present due to its crippling weakness to Rock. Do not set up with Quiver Dance until Steel-types, such as Registeel, are out of play, as they resist both of Vivillon's attacks. Make sure to use Sleep Powder before trying to set up with Quiver Dance, as keeping the Focus Sash intact is very important. Try to keep Vivillon at full health until opposing priority users, such as Sneasel and Fletchinder, are gone, as they can easily pick off Vivillon once it is weakened. In particular, Fletchinder should be dealt with before switching Vivillon in due to its Flying-type priority STAB move. Be wary of VoltTurn cores, as they can easily take advantage of Vivillon by dropping it to 1% with Volt Switch and then switching into a Pokemon with Lum Berry or a Grass-type to absorb Sleep Powder. Take caution against Choice Scarf users such as Jolly Flygon and Delphox, as they can easily revenge kill +1 Vivillon. Against offensive teams, it is recommended to put something to sleep then to spam Hurricane, as this does a lot of damage on its own due to the lack of walls. Vivillon will have difficulty sweeping if there are excessive priority users or a fast Choice Scarf user.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removers such as Blastoise and Flygon are heavily recommended because Vivillon is 4x weak to Stealth Rock. Pokemon that can take down Steel-types, such as Registeel and Steelix, are good partners; prime examples are, strong Fighting- and Ground-types such as Scrafty, Emboar, Virizion, Flygon, and Rhyperior. VoltTurn Pokemon are good teammates, because Vivillon is frail and likes to come in freely. Pokemon that can check or counter Vivillon checks, such as Fletchinder and Ice Shard variants of Sneasel are good; other such partners include Rhyperior, Blastoise, and Alomomola.</p>"

  "Meowstic": {
    "overview": "<p>Other than being adorable, Meowstic-M has a very specific niche that makes it viable in the RU metagame: access to Prankster along with Reflect, Light Screen, and Thunder Wave. Thanks to Prankster, all three of those moves get priority. However, despite having the edge over other dual screen users by having priority, Meowstic-M still faces heavy competition from the likes of Uxie, which have access to Memento to give free switches to its teammates, as well as Stealth Rock to further support its team, and is thus often a better choice if priority dual screens isn't something you're interested in. Additionally, Meowstic-M can be exploited easily by a lot of common Pokemon in the RU metagame such as Scrafty and Drapion. Finally, despite being good at what it does, Meowstic-M's only niche is dual screens, which leaves it to be very predictable.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Meowstic-M has very few viable options outside of its dual screens set. Safeguard can be used for immunity against status for a few turns, but it's generally not a useful move and not worth running over any of Meowstic-M's moveslots. Heal Bell is useful to cure your team of status and has nice priority thanks to Prankster, but there are better users of the move and again, Meowstic-M has no space for it. A set using Sunny Day or Rain Dance with Heat Rock or Damp Rock respectively can be a good addition for weather teams. Torment is a gimmicky option, but it can create opportunities for other Pokemon on your team to come in for free. Finally, Yawn can force switches and possibly put a Pokemon to sleep.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Almost Anything</strong>: Meowstic-M can't really harm most Pokemon unless they're weak to Psyshock or have really low defenses, so by definition just about anything can take it on, but it will usually be able to set up dual screens, which is the job it's supposed to accomplish. The issue will be dealing with Meowstic-M's teammates after screens are up.</p> <p><strong>Defog</strong>: Defog removes dual screens, and two common users of the move, Shiftry and Skuntank, are immune to Psyshock and have Dark STAB moves to scare Meowstic-M out.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types are immune to Psyshock and have super effective STAB moves. Scrafty and Drapion can set up on Meowstic-M and KO it with Knock Off, while Spiritomb, Shiftry, Skuntank, and Houndoom can all switch in directly and threaten Meowstic-M.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types don't take much damage from Psyshock and can capitalize on Meowstic-M by either setting up or simply pressuring it. Registeel can set up Stealth Rock or Curse, while Escavalier can threaten to KO with Megahorn.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Reflect halves the damage of physical attacks, and Light Screen halves the damage of special attacks directed at Meowstic-M. Thunder Wave can stop sweepers at their tracks, and gives Meowstic-M some utility outside of just using dual screens. Psyshock is a STAB move that can OHKO Hitmonlee, but Psychic is also an option, although it can't get the OHKO.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment is used to maximize bulk, with enough Speed to let Meowstic-M outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Hitmonlee and OHKO with Psyshock before it can go for Knock Off. The remaining EVs are put into Defense to be able to live hits such as Assault Vest Escavalier's Megahorn or Knock Off from various Pokemon. Light Clay is used to extend Reflect and Light Screen's duration from 5 to to 8 turns, and Prankster gives priority to all non-attacking moves and is the reason to use Meowstic-M in the first place.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Meowstic-M on hyper offense teams with Pokemon that appreciate the dual screens it provides; an example would be a Pokemon that relies on setting up to sweep, such as Scrafty. Thunder Wave should be used as either a last-ditch move or to stop a Pokemon from sweeping. Meowstic-M can also be kept for late-game if a quick Reflect or Light Screen is needed, or to check sweepers with Thunder Wave.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Generally speaking, Pokemon that rely on setting up to sweep make for incredible partners, as they can use the dual screens to safely set up. These can include Dragon Dance Scrafty, Nasty Plot Houndoom, Shell Smash Omastar, and Swords Dance Virizion. Something that can deal with Dark- and Steel-types such as Drapion and Escavalier respectively is appreciated; Rhyperior makes for a solid check to both of those Pokemon, which can also use Meowstic-M's screens to set up Rock Polish or Swords Dance. Braviary also makes for a good teammate, seeing as Defog removes dual screens, and Braviary, thanks to Defiant, can get a +2 Attack boost as it switches into Defog.</p>"

Weezing also has a very colorful movepool, with moves like Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, Toxic Spikes, and Flamethrower letting it provide great utility to its team. Unfortunately, Weezing is quite easy to wear down due to its only form of recovery being the unreliable Pain Split. While it does have a great Defense stat, its Special Defense stat is quite poor even when invested, meaning that it struggles to take on strong special attackers; mediocre offensive stats coupled with a reliance on Will-O-Wisp to do damage worsen this problem, as special attackers can usually switch into Weezing with impunity. Weezing also faces competition from Garbodor due to the latter's higher Special Defense and access to Spikes, though it maintains its niche with not only its unique movepool but also its ability in Levitate, which lets it take on Ground-type Pokemon like Rhyperior and Steelix better.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Clear Smog lets Weezing deal with setup sweepers like Gurdurr and Scrafty better. Haze does the same while also dealing with Pokemon behind Substitutes and Steel-type Pokemon like Swords Dance Escavalier and Curse Steelix. Weezing's expansive support movepool has many other interesting options like Memento and Destiny Bond, but it struggles to fit these into its moveset and other Pokemon generally use these moves more effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon</strong>: Specially offensive Psychic-type Pokemon like Sigilyph, Delphox, Hoopa, and Meloetta do not mind Will-O-Wisp, take little damage from Sludge Bomb, and can force Weezing out with their powerful STAB moves. Sigilyph in particular is not affected by burns due to Magic Guard, can Roost off damage from Sludge Bomb, and can hit Weezing hard.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon like Mega Camerupt, Emboar, and Houndoom are unaffected by Will-O-Wisp and can retaliate with strong STAB moves that score easy 2HKOs on Weezing. The latter two Pokemon are 3HKOed by Sludge Bomb, however.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Strong special attackers like Exploud and Jolteon can switch into Weezing because they are not crippled by burns and can target Weezing's lower defensive stat, but they are 3HKOed by Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Since Weezing performs its role by spreading burns and laying entry hazards, Pokemon with Taunt like Qwilfish, Drapion, and faster variants of Jellicent can shut down Weezing by forcing it to use its weak Special Attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp is one of Weezing's greatest selling points and is used to cripple physical attackers and deal passive damage to switch-ins. Sludge Bomb is Weezing's best STAB option, as it not only hits Grass- and Fairy-type Pokemon super effectively but also threatens Fire-type Pokemon like Emboar, Houndoom, and Delphox with a neutral hit. Sludge Bomb also has a nice chance to poison, further pressuring the Pokemon that attempt to switch in. Pain Split gives Weezing a semi-reliable form of recovery that has the added bonus of wearing down other Pokemon. Toxic Spikes provides great utility in wearing down Pokemon and crippling opposing walls. Taunt prevents Pokemon from using Weezing as setup fodder, particularly targeting slower entry hazard setters like Diancie, Registeel, Steelix, and Rhyperior along with slower boosting Pokemon like Gurdurr. Flamethrower is also an option to let Weezing hit Steel-type Pokemon like Steelix and Escavalier, though these Pokemon are already neutered by Will-O-Wisp and Taunt.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Black Sludge provides passive recovery for Weezing. The mixed EV spread lets Weezing check both Grass- and Fighting-type Pokemon; specifically, 28 Defense EVs with a Bold nature let Weezing always avoid the 2HKO from Adamant Life Orb Hitmonlee's High Jump Kick and +2 Virizion's Stone Edge after Stealth Rock. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Defense to better deal with specially offensive Grass-type Pokemon like Venusaur. Weezing's EV spread can be changed depending on the team's needs; for example, alternate EV spreads with more investment in Defense or Special Defense let Weezing better deal with Fighting-types and Grass-types, respectively. Using 44 Speed EVs is also an option, as they let Weezing outspeed Alomomola so that it can Taunt it before it uses Wish.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Weezing as a pivot by switching into Grass-, Fighting-, and Fairy-type Pokemon like Venusaur, Virizion, and Diancie and spreading burns with Will-O-Wisp or setting up Toxic Spikes. Take caution before using Will-O-Wisp, however, as Fire-type Pokemon like Houndoom, Emboar, and Mega Camerupt and status absorbers like Sigilyph can switch in and force Weezing out with their strong STAB moves. When you see these Pokemon or others that do not fear Will-O-Wisp, use Sludge Bomb liberally, as it is backed by STAB and has a chance to poison. Weezing performs particularly well against slower, defensive teams because its access to Taunt and Will-O-Wisp coupled with its immunity to Toxic makes it a formidable stallbreaker.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dark-type Pokemon like Sneasel, Drapion, and Houndoom pair fantastically with Weezing, as they threaten the Psychic-type Pokemon that beat Weezing and they appreciate Weezing's ability to deal with Fighting-type Pokemon. Pokemon that can switch into Fire-type Pokemon are also good partners; Alomomola in particular loves Weezing's ability to deal with Grass-types, and it vastly improves Weezing's longevity with Wish support in addition to checking Fire-type Pokemon and many special attackers in general. Jellicent also does the latter with its great special bulk while also blocking Rapid Spin and taking advantage of the Toxic Spikes support that Weezing provides with Hex. Diancie also has tremendous special bulk, letting it take on most special attackers like Exploud while also giving cleric support to heal burns and having access to Stealth Rock.</p>"

  "Flygon": {
    "overview": "<p>Flygon is easily one of the best Pokemon in the RU tier thanks to its typing, movepool, and well-rounded stat distribution. Flygon's solid Attack and Speed in combination with its great offensive typing and access to U-turn means that it can easily run Choice sets. These sets are made even better by Flygon's incredible resilience to entry hazards, taking a negligible 6.25% from Stealth Rock thanks to its Ground typing and immunity to all other entry hazards because of Levitate. Flygon also has the high-powered STAB moves in order to make these kinds of sets very effective. However, Flygon's support movepool shouldn't be overlooked either. Thanks to access to Roost, a solid defensive typing, and its resilience to entry hazards, Flygon is arguably the most reliable entry hazard remover in the tier with Defog. All of this enables Flygon to find a home on a wide variety of RU teams without the need for a lot of team support. Flygon doesn't have many weaknesses to account for, but there are a few you should keep in mind. Well-rounded stats are great, but this leads to Flygon sometimes being a little underwhelming offensively or defensively. There are many physically bulky Water- and Grass-type Pokemon in RU that are capable of switching into Flygon multiple times to give it issues, regardless of the set it uses. Despite its otherwise good Speed, Flygon also is unable to outspeed key threats like Delphox, Sneasel, Virizion, and Jolteon without the help of a Choice Scarf. Finally, Flygon's typing does have a couple of holes in it defensively, most notably a 4x weakness to Ice in a tier where Sneasel, Mega Glalie, and Abomasnow are very serious threats to most teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flygon can utilize a more offensive Defog set with Earthquake, Draco Meteor, Defog, and U-turn to keep from draining as much momentum when Defogging, but it will not be nearly as reliable at removing entry hazards or dealing damage to the opposing team as its other sets are. Note that Earth Power can be used on such a set to make it purely special, but the higher damage output on Registeel is usually preferred. Flygon can use Fire Punch on the Choice Band set to 2HKO Bronzong, but chipping it with U-turn and having a Pursuit user in the back generally works well enough. Dragon Tail is a noteworthy option on the support set, as it can prevent the opponent from trying to use Flygon as setup fodder. Hone Claws is the only boosting move Flygon has in its movepool, and while it does let Flygon use Dragon Rush and Iron Tail more reliably thanks to the accuracy boost, it generally lacks the Speed to reliably sweep. Flygon can use the combination of Substitute and Dragon Tail to shuffle through the opposing team, but Druddigon is generally preferred for phazing due to its better overall bulk and more raw power. Flygon's offensive movepool includes some colorful options, like Superpower, Bug Buzz, Giga Drain, and Thunder Punch, but they simply don't allow Flygon to beat much of anything that its main moves miss out on. Finally, Flygon has a decent typing and access to Sunny Day and Defog for sun-based teams. However, strategies with Sunny Day are rare in RU and are heavily matchup reliant.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Togetic</strong>: Unless it carries Iron Tail or the uncommon Stone Edge on the Choice Band set, Flygon can do very little to Togetic, while Togetic can heal itself with Roost or support its team with Heal Bell.</p> <p><strong>Bronzong</strong>: Although Flygon has an easier time chipping it with U-turn than it does Togetic, Bronzong is able to handle Flygon's STAB moves and Toxic support sets or Gyro Ball offensive sets in return.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Aromatisse, Granbull, and Mega Audino are able to discourage Flygon from using its Dragon-type moves and have the bulk to stomach an Earthquake or two. However, they are all very vulnerable to Iron Tail due to either no reliable recovery in the case of Granbull, or delayed recovery in the cases of Aromatisse and Mega Audino.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with good natural bulk and no weakness to Ground- or Dragon-type moves can usually pivot into Flygon. Alomomola is the best example, but physically defensive Slowking, defensive Venusaur, and Jellicent are also useful, albeit a little more susceptible to chip damage from U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Pokemon with a 4x weakness to a good attacking type are prone to being lured in by specific threats, and Flygon is no different. Jolteon, Mega Camerupt, and Manectric can easily use Hidden Power Ice to OHKO Flygon without losing much effectiveness, if any. However, Mega Camerupt is slower and must hit Flygon on the switch, while Jolteon and Manectric have to hit the Choice Scarf set on the switch as well. Rhyperior is another great example, as it can easily fit Ice Punch onto most sets in order to keep Flygon from getting a free attack or Defog off on it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>By donning a Choice Band, Flygon is able to fix its issue of being unable to break through more defensive Pokemon due to its decent, but not amazing, Attack stat. Earthquake is the best move on this set, as it's a 100 Base Power STAB move that hits anything that lacks a resistance hard. Outrage is an important secondary STAB move due to its ability to crush the Flying-types, Grass-types, and Levitate users that attempt to switch into Earthquake. U-turn gets valuable chip damage on checks and counters to Flygon while also building momentum for its team. Since Flygon has most of its bases covered in just three moves, Dragon Claw is chosen as the last move in order to give Flygon a reliable Dragon-type STAB move to use early in a game where there are numerous Pokemon with a Ground-type resistance but few Dragon-type resistances outside of a possible Fairy-type. There are a few other notable options if Dragon Claw is unnecessary, but keep in mind that Flygon will very rarely need to use its last move, so don't edit the moveslot just on account of not using Dragon Claw much. Iron Tail is an option to hit Togetic and Granbull much harder than any other move Flygon has, but simply pivoting out to a teammate usually suffices. Stone Edge covers Togetic and allows Flygon to at worst 2HKO all variants of Sigilyph and Braviary without locking into Outrage. Defog can be used to rid the field of all entry hazards, but it is often an undesirable move to lock into unless Flygon outspeeds the opposition and is likely to faint to the next attack it takes. Finally, Tailwind can be used to provide Flygon's team a temporary boost in Speed, but it has similar issues to Defog.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Flygon simply needs an EV spread that maximizes its Attack and Speed stats in order to hit as hard and as fast as possible. A Jolly nature is used so that Flygon can outspeed key threats like Drapion, Sigilyph, Houndoom, and Meloetta. A Choice Band is required so that Flygon is capable of breaking down bulky foes with its powerful STAB moves and U-turn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Band Flygon absolutely loves to chip away at the opponent's Dragon- and Ground-type switch-ins with U-turn early on in the game. Flygon is able to easily switch into predicted Ground- and Electric-type moves as well as weaker Fire-type moves and either build momentum with U-turn or threaten the opponent with its powerful STAB moves. Once the opponent has lost of their Ground- or Dragon-type checks, Flygon can quickly rip into the opposing team with its strong STAB moves. Outrage is Flygon's strongest move, but also the most dangerous due to it locking Flygon in for two or three turns, possibly leading to a premature KO. For this reason, it should only be used when the power of Dragon Claw isn't enough or when the opponent has lost all of their Dragon-resistant Pokemon and you're simply exploiting that. Flygon's fourth move should not be revealed until it is necessary to eliminate a target or to support its team, as it can lead to Flygon possibly lulling a key threat, such as Granbull or Sigilyph, into a false sense of security. Flygon should be kept away from possible Scald or Knock Off users unless it can eliminate them before being hit. The loss of its Choice Band or a possible burn will rob Flygon of the power it needs to break through bulkier foes. Be careful around Hidden Power users, especially Manectric and Jolteon. Due to its 4x weakness to Ice, Flygon can easily be lured in if it isn't careful, so make sure that you scout for Hidden Power Ice even if you don't see Life Orb recoil due to them possibly using Expert Belt to feign a Choice item.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This particular Flygon pairs very well with Magneton, as the two form an extremely threatening VoltTurn core that synergizes well offensively and defensively. Due to many of Flygon's checks and counters being grounded, it benefits greatly from Spikes support to not only wear them down faster but also amplify the effects of U-turn. Mega Glalie is a fantastic option thanks to its ability to push past bulky Water- and Grass-types and pressure the best forms of entry hazard removal in the tier, Blastoise and opposing Flygon. Venusaur is a solid teammate for its ability to handle most opposing bulky Water-, Fairy-, and Grass-types, and it can also catch Flying-types and Bronzong with Sleep Powder, making them much less threatening if they switch into Earthquake. Jolteon and Manectric are solid options for a VoltTurn core with Flygon. While they don't have as much synergy with Flygon as Magneton does, they are able to handle most variants of Sigilyph and Braviary more reliably due to their higher Speed stats. Escavalier is able to handle Fairy-types, check Sneasel, and Pursuit trap Bronzong, all of which Flygon appreciates having weakened or removed. Most Choice item users appreciate defensive pivots to fall back on whenever they encounter a bad matchup, and Flygon is no different. Slowking and Registeel are more traditional defensive pivots that Flygon can fall back on when it's locked into an unfavorable move. If using Flygon on a more offensive VoltTurn team, Uxie is a worthy addition due to its ability to check Virizion and Choice Scarf Medicham while also setting up Stealth Rock and building momentum with its combination of Yawn and U-turn.</p>"
      },
      "Defog Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set capitalizes on Flygon's great entry hazard resilience and access to Defog to create a fantastic support set. Defog removes all entry hazards from play, and Flygon can easily do this multiple times throughout a match to keep its team from being worn down or crippled. Roost is necessary reliable recovery so that Flygon can continue to pivot into attacks and remove entry hazards over the course of a match. Earthquake allows Flygon to reliably handle the likes of Delphox, Houndoom, and Mega Camerupt. U-turn gives Flygon the ability to build momentum for its team once it has removed entry hazards, thus keeping it from bogging down more offensive teams as much as most other entry hazard removers do. If U-turn isn't necessary, Dragon Claw is a fine alternative in order to allow Flygon to hit Fletchinder, Sigilyph, and opposing Flygon for decent damage. Toxic is another alternative that allows Flygon to prevent Braviary from setting up on it as easily while also putting more pressure on defensive Pokemon, such as Slowking and Alomomola, by effectively limiting their walling abilities.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread maximizes Speed while also allowing Flygon to 2HKO Meloetta and offensive variants of Venusaur with Earthquake. The rest is put into HP so that Flygon can pivot into hits better. Due to Flygon's Speed tier, there are multiple benchmarks that you can aim for depending on team needs. 232 Speed EVs allow Flygon to outspeed Sigilyph, while 216 EVs ensure that Flygon outspeeds Houndoom and Drapion. 176 Speed EVs keep Flygon ahead of Meloetta, thus allowing it to 2HKO with Earthquake or dent Meloetta with U-turn. If significantly more bulk is required to handle the likes of Mega Camerupt and Delphox, Flygon can opt for a Careful nature and use 108 Speed EVs to outspeed positive-natured base 70s, such as Hoopa and Magneton. However, it is usually advised to have at least 176 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature so that Flygon can handle the likes of Meloetta, Rotom-C, and Hitmonlee without any issues. Leftovers is the preferred item so that Flygon doesn't have to rely as much on Roost to stay healthy. Earth Plate and a more offensive spread can be used to power up Earthquake, but this should only be considered if the team doesn't have Pokemon, such as Scyther and Fletchinder, that are completely reliant on entry hazard removal in order to function.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Even with Leftovers, Roost, and some HP investment, Flygon's bulk is decidedly average, so find opportunities to switch in against Pokemon using Rock-, Fire-, Ground-, or Electric-type moves. Due to Defog letting opposing Pokemon in for free, it's usually best to attempt to whittle down opposing entry hazard users before using Defog in earnest unless the team has a Pokemon, such as Scyther or Fletchinder, that absolutely needs Stealth Rock removed in order to function well. Earthquake is extremely low risk to use at most points in the game due to Flygon's lack of a Choice item and the solid power it has against offensive neutral targets and anything weak to it; it's easily the move of choice on most occasions when Flygon is just being used to check a threat on the opposing team and it's still healthy. Roost is a reliable recovery move, but you shouldn't wait to use it until Flygon is in dire need of it as it will become very predictable at that point. It's generally best to use the move when Flygon is around half HP and very likely to withstand the next attack from the Pokemon it just switched into. This allows Flygon to stay healthy to check dangerous foes and keeps it from becoming too predictable with Roost. U-turn is a fantastic momentum-building move that turns Flygon into a defensive pivot thanks to its solid typing and great Speed tier. Dragon Claw should only be used when the opponent sends in the likes of Sigilyph or Fletchinder and Flygon is healthy enough to take a hit from these Pokemon. Make sure to scout for Ice-type coverage moves from the likes of Mega Camerupt, Jolteon, and Rhyperior, as these are common Pokemon that Flygon can handle in most other situations due to its resistance or immunity to their STAB moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to being arguably the best entry hazard remover in the tier, Flygon works well with any Pokemon that dislikes Stealth Rock and other entry hazards on the field. Fletchinder and Scyther are obvious options due to their 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, but Sneasel, Aerodactyl, and Braviary are other key offensive Pokemon that love not having to deal with Stealth Rock every time they switch in. Thanks to Levitate, Flygon can easily remove Spikes and Toxic Spikes due to not being pressured by them at all and having a solid matchup against most users of the moves. For this reason, defensive Pokemon like Alomomola, Registeel, and Diancie appreciate Flygon's support so that they can preserve as much HP as possible to handle dangerous threats on the opposing team. Flygon works well with bulky Stealth Rock users due to the possibility of it using Defog multiple times throughout a battle, so Rhyperior, Registeel, and Diancie can be useful due to their solid bulk and ability to set up Stealth Rock multiple times. Diancie and Rhyperior can check the likes of Fletchinder, Sigilyph, and Braviary for when Flygon lacks Dragon Claw, while Registeel is generally a good response to most Ice-types that threaten Flygon. Having teammates that can pivot into opposing Flygon is very useful so that Flygon doesn't have to risk a Speed tie if it's running Dragon Claw. Alomomola, Togetic, and Slowking are all reliable options for this. Alomomola and Slowking have Regenerator to stay healthy and appreciate not having to deal with the prospect of Spikes and Toxic Spikes, while Togetic appreciates not having to switch into Stealth Rock and can provide cleric support if Flygon is caught by stray status moves. Pokemon that can threaten Ice-types with their powerful STAB moves, such as Emboar, Escavalier, and Medicham, are very useful teammates, as Flygon is quite vulnerable to them due to most having Ice Shard.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>While Flygon doesn't have the greatest of Attack stats, its great Speed tier, strong STAB options, and great entry hazard resilience make a Choice Scarf set possible. Earthquake is the main STAB move on this set, as it doesn't force Flygon to stay in and has solid coverage overall. U-turn is a great tool for Flygon to maintain offensive pressure and to chip away at its checks and counters. Outrage is Flygon's stronger STAB option, but it should generally only be used when Flygon is capable of cleaning with it due to the lock-in effect it comes with. As Flygon has most of what it needs in three moves, the last moveslot is designed to give some extra support to the team. Aerial Ace is the primary option because it allows Flygon to revenge kill Virizion without fail. Tailwind is a fine option if Virizion is not a big concern for your team, as it can give the rest of the team doubled Speed for three turns, thus allowing slower hard hitters such as Hitmonlee, Medicham, and Meloetta to clean up the opposing team. Finally, Defog can be used as a means to remove entry hazards in tight situations. Keep in mind that Tailwind and Defog can very easily be exploited by setup sweepers and should only be used when Flygon is about to be KOed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Flygon simply needs its Attack and Speed maximized in order to hit as hard and as fast as possible. Jolly is the preferred nature so that Flygon can outspeed opposing Choice Scarf Drapion and Hitmonlee as well as to Speed tie with opposing Choice Scarf Flygon. Adamant nature is an option to power up Flygon's moves some, but it generally isn't worth losing out on the Speed necessary to outspeed Drapion and Hitmonlee. Choice Scarf gives Flygon the Speed it needs to revenge kill threats and possibly clean late-game.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf enables Flygon to fulfill multiple roles based on what the team needs it to do. Thanks to the boost in Speed and access to U-turn, Flygon can be used as a scout lead to put some early pressure on the opposing team or as a safety net if you can't really determine what the opponent might lead with just by looking at Team Preview. Flygon's STAB moves each have their major drawbacks early-game, so it's generally best to use U-turn to begin chipping away at the opponent's responses to Flygon. Earthquake is easily the safer STAB move for Flygon to use in order to revenge kill opposing Pokemon, as Flygon can freely switch out after using the move. Due to its slightly higher Base Power, Outrage is a good cleaning move for Flygon, but the lock-in effect makes the move very risky to use when the opponent has Pokemon that resist it or priority users remaining on their team. As Flygon's last moveslot is used for general utility, it should be treated as such and only used when the selected move is needed. Aerial Ace is almost exclusively for revenge killing Virizion and should be used if all other answers to Virizion on the team have either been KOed or weakened to a point where they can no longer take hits from it. The move is very weak otherwise, and just about any Pokemon outside of Virizion can take it and retaliate. Tailwind and Defog are great in late-game situations where Flygon can't clean up the opposing team but a teammate can if supported by one of said moves. However, these moves have a very obvious drawback of doing no damage, making it easily exploitable for the opponent should Flygon not be KOed immediately after using the moves; therefore, make sure that Flygon is almost guaranteed to be KOed by whatever move hits it next. Finally, remember that, of all entry hazards, Flygon only takes Stealth Rock damage, thus allowing it to be played more aggressively than other Choice Scarf users in the tier, such as Medicham, Drapion, and Hitmonlee.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Flygon doesn't need a lot of support to function at maximum capabilities, but it obviously appreciates Pokemon that can remove Fairy- and Flying-types so that it can spam its STAB moves more easily. Magneton is a top option, as it fares well against most of them, heavily pressures bulky Water-type Pokemon, and forms a powerful VoltTurn core with Flygon. Escavalier and Venusaur are other solid options to break down the opposing team and pressure Fairy-types in particular. Venusaur can also pressure opposing bulky Grass- and Water-types. Rhyperior and Diancie are also good teammates, as they can set up Stealth Rock and handle most Flying-types in the tier. Mega Glalie can put pressure on bulky Water- and Grass-types and set up Spikes to amplify the pressure U-turn can cause. However, make sure that Flygon is using Tailwind or Aerial Ace in the last moveslot should you go this route, as Defog would be counterproductive. While they can't safely switch into Flygon, Ice Shard users give it a very difficult time due to a 4x weakness to Ice and the fact that Ice Shard ignores Flygon's boosted Speed. Diancie is able to check Sneasel while Escavalier is able to handle Abomasnow as well as Mega Glalie should it be using a more defensive set than Choice Band. Registeel is able to check all three of these Ice-types, but it has to be wary of Low Kick and Focus Blast from Sneasel and Abomasnow, respectively. As Flygon can work on most types of teams, defensive pivots such as Alomomola, Slowking, defensive Venusaur, and Registeel can be used to switch into attacks for Flygon on more balanced teams. Wallbreakers, such as Medicham, Meloetta, and Hitmonlee can break down walls for Flygon and take advantage of a late-game Tailwind should Flygon be carrying the move. On the flip side, Aerodactyl and Fletchinder are notable sweepers that can take advantage of a late-game Defog that can keep them from worrying about Stealth Rock. Life Orb Druddigon doesn't share much defensive synergy with Flygon, but it can form a double Dragon core to heavily pressure Steel- and Fairy-types.</p>"

  "Gallade": {
    "overview": "<p>Gallade boasts an expansive movepool including Trick, Swords Dance, and Bulk Up, which makes it extremely versatile. Gallade's great type combination lets it beat Poison-, Steel-, and Fighting-types such as Venusaur, Registeel, and Hitmonlee, all of which are common in RarelyUsed. Furthermore, Gallade has access to Knock Off, which complements its dual STAB moves and hits Psychic-types such as Uxie and Sigilyph for heavy damage. Gallade's high-Base Power STAB moves are supported by its monstrous Attack stat, which turns it into a fearsome wallbreaker that can easily threaten defensively oriented teams. Gallade also sports a great Special Defense stat that allows it to switch into many special attacks comfortably. Moreover, Gallade's ability Justified gives it a free Attack boost when it is hit by a Dark-type attack. Unfortunately, Gallade's subpar physical bulk coupled with its low base HP makes it very physically frail, especially after a Defense drop from Close Combat. Its average Speed leaves it vulnerable to revenge killers and priority users such as Flygon and Fletchinder. Finally, in a tier saturated with Fighting-types, Gallade faces tough competition from the likes of Medicham, Virizion, and Hitmonlee.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An Assault Vest set is an option that takes advantage of Gallade's great Special Defense and lets it take many special attacks comfortably. A bulky Swords Dance set can also be used, but it will be very susceptible to revenge killers. Choice Scarf can be used on Gallade to make it a great revenge killer, but Medicham generally does the job better. Gallade can also utilize a specially defensive set with Wish + Protect and Will-O-Wisp to make it a decent special wall, with Will-O-Wisp helping it to punish physical attackers. Because Gallade has a wide movepool, it can run many alternate moves. Leaf Blade can be used to hit Alomomola and Seismitoad very hard. Stone Edge is a great alternative to nail Togetic, Braviary, and Fletchinder. Memento and Destiny Bond can be used on the Choice Band set in order to cripple or potentially knock out Gallade's foes, respectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to Gallade's average Speed, it is very vulnerable to revenge killers. Pokemon that naturally outspeed Gallade such as Virizion and Mega Glalie can heavily damage Gallade or KO it with their powerful STAB moves. Fletchinder can also easily revenge kill Gallade with its priority Acrobatics. Choice Scarf users such as Emboar, Braviary, and Flygon all outspeed Gallade and deal a lot of damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Gallade is extremely susceptible to status. If Gallade gets burnt through Scald or Will-O-Wisp, its Attack is cut in half, crippling it for the rest of the game. Paralysis cuts Gallade's Speed to a quarter of its original, making it even easier to be revenge killed as well as giving it a chance to be fully paralyzed. Poison puts Gallade on a timer, slowly reducing its longevity.</p> <p><strong>Spiritomb</strong>: Spiritomb can survive any attack from Gallade even at +2, and thanks to Infiltrator it can burn Gallade even through a Substitute or threaten it with STAB Sucker Punch and Pursuit when it switches out. Furthermore, it can 2HKO Gallade with Foul Play and OHKO it when Gallade attempts to set up a Swords Dance against it. However, if Spiritomb does not run Foul Play, it loses to Gallade's Safeguard + Bulk Up set.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Gallade's Attack by two stages, turning it into a fearsome wallbreaker. Close Combat has a very high Base Power and can punch holes in opposing teams. Zen Headbutt has great coverage with Close Combat, as it hits Poison-types such as Venusaur and Weezing super effectively. Knock Off rounds off Gallade's great coverage by hitting Psychic-types such as Uxie, Sigilyph, and Musharna hard, and it has the additional utility of removing its target's item.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb is used to give Gallade additional damage output. Lum Berry is an option, acting as a safety net against status moves such as Thunder Wave and Scald burns. Justified is the ability of choice in case Gallade is hit by a Dark-type move, giving Gallade a free Attack boost. A Jolly nature is used to Speed tie with Jolly Glalie before it Mega Evolves. An Adamant nature is an alternative for more firepower. The maximum Attack investment is used to maximize Gallade's wallbreaking capabilities while the rest is put in Speed for Gallade to outspeed Jolly Emboar and Modest Exploud.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is recommended for players not to expose Gallade to status moves of any kind, as they can cripple it for the entirety of the match. If Gallade is facing defensive teams, players should set up a Swords Dance to threaten foes. If Gallade is facing offensive teams, Gallade need not set up a Swords Dance, as its natural raw power can threaten them with ease. Because Gallade has great natural special bulk, it can safely switch or pivot into weak special attacks. Gallade should switch out most of the time against revenge killers, especially after a Defense drop from Close Combat, as they can KO it or heavily damage it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gallade is very weak to offensively oriented teams, so Pokemon that have great matchups against them such as Choice Scarf Rotom-C and Jolteon are helpful for Gallade. In turn, Gallade can deal with defensive Pokemon that they have trouble against. Gallade appreciates Healing Wish support from the likes of Mesprit and Musharna, as it can then be played more aggressively early-game and be revived late-game to get a second chance at wallbreaking. Spiritomb is a problem for this set, so Pokemon such as Emboar, Exploud, and Aromatisse are helpful in beating it. Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee and Virizion are great partners, as Gallade can weaken Psychic-types for them to ease the opportunity for them to sweep late-game. Though Uxie shares a Ghost weakness with Gallade, it pairs well with Gallade, as it can provide Thunder Wave and Stealth Rock support and generate momentum with U-turn. In addition, Uxie can provide dual screens support to ease setup for Gallade.</p>"
      },
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bulk Up is used to boost Gallade's Attack and subpar Defense. Drain Punch is a decent STAB move that works well with the slow-boosting nature of this set by providing longevity. Knock Off provides great coverage with Drain Punch, nailing Mesprit, Uxie, and Sigilyph, and has the additional utility of removing the target's item. Substitute is used to block status as well as to make Gallade very difficult to revenge kill. Safeguard is an interesting move that gives Gallade another method to block status without having to reduce its health. It also allows Gallade to set up on Spiritomb variants that do not carry Foul Play and prevents 50-50s with Jellicent.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers provides plenty of longevity alongside the recovery provided by Drain Punch, which is very important when making Substitutes. Justified is the ability of choice in case Gallade is hit by a Dark-type move, giving Gallade to get a free Attack boost. Near-maximum HP investment is used to augment Gallade's bulk. The Speed investment is used to outspeed Modest Exploud and Jolly Scrafty in order to get off a Drain Punch before they can heavily damage Gallade. The rest is put in Special Defense with a Careful nature to make Gallade as specially bulky as possible. A spread with maximum HP and Special Defense is an option to make Gallade more bulky.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gallade should not be exposed to status ailments, as they could cripple it severely. If Gallade is running Substitute, it should be careful of Spiritomb and Exploud, as the former can burn Gallade through Substitute thanks to Infiltrator while the latter can use its STAB Boomburst to damage it severely. Set up Substitute, Safeguard, or Bulk Up on Pokemon that cannot do much against Gallade, such as Alomomola and Jellicent. Gallade should not recklessly set up on Pokemon that carry Roar or Whirlwind, as they can phaze Gallade even through a Substitute. It should be noted that even though Gallade can set up on Spiritomb, it needs to be careful of Foul Play variants, as they can 2HKO it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can get rid of Toxic Spikes, such as Flygon and Drapion, are great partners, as poison cripples Gallade; the latter can also provide its own Toxic Spikes support to help wear down opposing foes for Gallade. Alomomola in particular makes for a great partner, as it can handle physical attackers that beat an unboosted Gallade as well as provide Wish support. Pokemon that can take care of Spiritomb, such as Aromatisse and Togetic, work well with Gallade, and both of them can provide Heal Bell support to keep Gallade safe from status. Wallbreakers such as Mega Glalie can still heavily dent Gallade even at +1 Defense, so Pokemon that can beat them are great teammates. Registeel is a great partner; it can also provide Stealth Rock support, and it has the benefit of being able to beat Fairy-types that annoy Gallade, such as Mega Audino and Aromatisse.</p>"

  "Gourgeist-Small": {
    "overview": "<p>Gourgeist-S's niche in RU comes from its very good Speed stat, which, in combination with its access to Will-O-Wisp and Leech Seed, allow it to Substitute stall easily. It also has a nice Defense stat even without investment, as well as a helpful defensive typing that resists Ground-, Grass-, and Water-type attacks and is immune to Fighting-type attacks, meaning that it doesn't have any trouble switching in and taking attacks. Unfortunately, most fast special attackers have no trouble beating it, which means that it can have trouble against certain teams. Gourgeist-S is also completely reliant on residual damage to be effective; as such, Taunt and Magic Guard completely shut it down. Finally, a weakness to Knock Off really hampers its ability to switch into Fighting-types, which it would otherwise beat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Pain Split can be used for healing, though it's unreliable and Leech Seed tends to do a better job of healing. Rock Slide can be used to hit the Fire-, Ice-, and Flying-types which tend to pester Gourgeist-S and can also flinch, though it isn't very strong. Shadow Sneak can be used as a priority attack, though it's extremely weak. Finally, Toxic can be used to wear down the opponent more easily, though Will-O-Wisp's ability to cripple physical attackers is usually preferred.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Most Grass-types such as Venusaur and Rotom-C are immune to Leech Seed and don't mind Will-O-Wisp. Venusaur can also fire back with Sludge Bomb, making it one of the best counters to Gourgeist-S.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Delphox and Emboar are immune to Will-O-Wisp and can defeat Gourgeist-S with a super effective STAB attack. Leech Seed in combination with Substitute and either Phantom Force or Protect can do a number to them, however.</p> <p><strong>Fast Special Attackers</strong>: Most fast special attackers can switch into a Will-O-Wisp and Leech Seed with relative ease and retaliate with a special attack.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Taunt Users</strong>: Bulky Pokemon with Taunt such as Drapion and Skuntank can Taunt Gourgeist-S and render it near useless. However, they don't like being burned.</p> <p><strong>Sound Moves</strong>: Sound moves such as Exploud's Boomburst and Accelgor's Bug Buzz go through Substitute, which means that they can easily deal with Gourgeist-S.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic damage can prevent Gourgeist-S from stalling out its opponent effectively. Toxic Spikes is a great way to inflict poison, as Gourgeist-S can't avoid it with Substitute like it can with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Magic Guard</strong>: Pokemon with Magic Guard such as Sigilyph take no damage from Leech Seed and Will-O-Wisp. They can also take a Phantom Force and KO Gourgeist-S back.</p>",

      "SubSeed": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute is used to avoid incoming attacks and stall for Leech Seed and Will-O-Wisp damage. Leech Seed can heal off most of the damage from Substitute when used with Leftovers and also wears down the opponent. Will-O-Wisp is used not only to cripple physical attackers, but also to wear down the opponent even more in combination with Leech Seed. Protect is used to stall for Leech Seed and Will-O-Wisp damage without having to take a hit like Gourgeist-S would with Phantom Force. Protect does, however, leave Gourgeist-S very vulnerable to Taunt. Phantom Force can be used in the last slot to stall for Leech Seed and Will-O-Wisp damage while also making sure that Gourgeist-S isn't complete Taunt bait. However, it gives Normal-type Pokemon, most notably Exploud, a free switch-in. Seed Bomb is an option, though it does pitiful amounts of damage to Grass-types which are immune to Leech Seed and Fire-types which are immune to Will-O-Wisp. Additionally, Seed Bomb doesn't give Gourgeist-S the ability to stall for Leech Seed and Will-O-Wisp damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread with a Jolly nature allows Gourgeist-S to outspeed max Speed base 95 Speed Pokemon such as Drapion in order to use Will-O-Wisp, Leech Seed, or Substitute against them. The given HP EVs maximize Leech Seed recovery while also providing good bulk, with the leftover EVs being added to Defense to better take physical hits. Jolly is preferred if Phantom Force is being used; otherwise, a Timid nature is preferred to reduce Foul Play and confusion damage. Frisk is the ability of choice, as it lets Gourgeist-S scout the opponent's item. Leftovers is a necessity, as in combination with Leech Seed, it heals off much of the HP lost from using Substitute.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to bring Gourgeist-S in on a slow Ground-, Water-, or Fighting-type that can't hurt it and set up a Substitute. From there, use the combination of Substitute, Leech Seed, Will-O-Wisp, and Protect or Phantom Force to slowly whittle away at the opponent's health. It's important to avoid Knock Off at all costs, as Leftovers recovery is a big part of what makes Gourgeist-S successful.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Toxic Spikes support is amazing, as Gourgeist-S can stall entire teams with Leech Seed in combination with Toxic Spikes. Drapion not only sets up Toxic Spikes but can also take the Dark- and Ghost-type moves that Gourgeist-S hates. Weezing and Roselia are other Pokemon that can use Toxic Spikes. With no reliable recovery move, Gourgeist-S greatly appreciates Wish support. Alomomola and Aromatisse are two of the best Wish passers in the tier and also pair really well with Gourgeist-S: the former takes Fire- and Ice-type attacks for Gourgeist-S, while the latter can take Dark-type attacks with ease. Rhyperior is great at absorbing Fire- and Flying-type attacks for Gourgeist-S, while Gourgeist-S can take Water- and Grass-type moves for Rhyperior. Qwilfish has good synergy with Gourgeist-S, as it takes Fire- and Ice-type attacks for Gourgeist-S, while Gourgeist-S can take Ground- and Electric-type attacks for Qwilfish in return. Qwilfish can also set up Spikes to further wear down the opponent. Because Grass- and Fire-types are immune to Leech Seed and Will-O-Wisp, respectively, Pokemon that can deal with these types make for good partners. Slowking counters most Fire-types and also has a super effective STAB move to beat Venusaur, and can even lure in other Grass-types with Fire Blast. Golbat 4x resists Grass-type moves and can retaliate back with Brave Bird. It can also clear entry hazards via Defog, helping to extend Gourgeist-S's lifespan.</p>"

  "Shiftry": {
    "overview": "<p>Shiftry is one of the few Defog users in the tier with a good offensive presence. Thanks to its high Attack stat, Shiftry is dangerous when carrying a Life Orb, as it can wear down defensive Pokemon with Knock Off and act as a late-game revenge killer with Sucker Punch. Shiftry also has a good Special Attack stat and can use Leaf Storm as a mixed attacker. Unfortunately, Shiftry's mediocre Speed makes it hard to Defog against offensive teams, and its poor Grass / Dark typing which makes it 4x weak to U-turn along with its paper thin defenses means it is KOed easily. As a Defogger, Shiftry also faces competition from Flygon, which has better bulk and Speed but lacks priority, unlike Shiftry. Shiftry is also walled by common walls such as Togetic and Aromatisse, reducing its effectiveness. Nevertheless, Shiftry can make use of its typing to check Pokemon such as Alomomola, Clawitzer, Jolteon, and Delphox.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Nasty Plot set with Giga Drain and Dark Pulse is an option to use, but it's outclassed and inferior to the Swords Dance set, as it lacks priority. Leaf Blade can be used, but the move is illegal with Sucker Punch, which is extremely valuable to Shiftry. Explosion can be utilized on any set to go out with a bang and possibly allow Shiftry to take something with it, especially Scrafty or Togetic after Knock Off; it can also prevent foes from successfully using Rapid Spin, but Shiftry doesn't really have a spare moveslot for it. Shiftry can run Bullet Seed to beat lead Omastar and prevent it from setting up entry hazards, but the move is only useful in that scenario. Shiftry can utilize a Sunny Day set with Solar Beam for sun teams, but it loses Defog and Swords Dance, which give Shiftry its niche.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Virizion</strong>: Virizion appreciates a Justified boost, can take anything Shiftry throws at it, and can retaliate with Close Combat. Virizion can also set up on Shiftry with Swords Dance or Calm Mind and attempt to sweep.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon that Resist Shiftry's STAB Moves</strong>: Pokemon that resist Knock Off, Leaf Storm, or Sucker Punch can easily counter Shiftry. This includes Drapion, Skuntank, Emboar, Druddigon, and Togetic.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon that can take a Sucker Punch can easily revenge kill Shiftry. This includes Choice Scarf Braviary, Jolly Hitmonlee, and Flygon, although they must be wary, as a +2 Sucker Punch may KO them.</p>",

      "Offensive Defogger": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog removes entry hazards from both sides of the field, supporting Shiftry's teammates. Knock Off is a strong STAB move that cripples a lot of Pokemon, removing their items, making it very difficult to switch into. Sucker Punch has +1 priority and is a STAB move: it makes Shiftry a great revenge killer, especially against frail foes such as Jolteon and Delphox. Leaf Storm gives Shiftry the ability to KO Pokemon such as Alomomola and Rhyperior, as well as making Shiftry a mixed attacker; paired with Knock Off, it makes it extremely hard for foes to switch into Shiftry.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs are to used maximize Attack and Speed, with the remaining EVs dumped into Special Attack, allowing Shiftry to outspeed Pokemon like Hitmontop, Adamant Hitmonlee, Modest Meloetta, and Adamant Kabutops. Life Orb boosts Shiftry's damage output. A Hasty nature is used to let Shiftry Speed tie with Jolly Kabutops, Medicham, Gallade, and non-Mega Glalie.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Shiftry is a Pokemon that can be used throughout the entire match. If you see an opportunity to Defog, use it; otherwise, Knock Off is a generally safe move. Shiftry should be used to cripple defensive cores of Rhyperior and Alomomola with Leaf Storm; it also can hit Amoonguss hard on the switch and remove Eviolite from Togetic with Knock Off. If possible, save Shiftry for late-game cleaning or revenge killing. It can also come in mid-game to Defog if needed. If predicted right, Shiftry can come into Rhyperior, Clawitzer, Alomomola, and Jellicent and can KO them, but beware of Scald burns, as well as coverage moves that could KO Shiftry.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Delphox, Fletchinder, and Mega Glalie love to have entry hazards removed and therefore make for great partners. They can deal with Shiftry's checks, such as Virizion, while Shiftry can deal with their common switch-ins, such as Alomomola and Jellicent. Uxie is a great partner, as it can deal with Virizion and spread Thunder Wave, helping Shiftry deal with faster threats. Alomomola can deal with Fire-types, such as Mega Camerupt, Delphox, Typhlosion, and Fletchinder, as well as pass Wishes to Shiftry.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Shiftry's Attack to high levels, making it a great sweeper. Knock Off is a great STAB move that deals heavy damage and removing the target's item. Sucker Punch makes up for Shiftry's mediocre Speed, as it has +1 priority; it also can OHKO Adamant Hitmonlee at +2 as well as threaten any faster Pokemon. Seed Bomb allows Shiftry to deal with Rhyperior and Alomomola, hitting them super effectively. It also allows Shiftry to deal with Aromatisse, which otherwise walls it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs make Shiftry as fast and powerful as it can be. A Jolly nature is used to outspeed Adamant Hitmonlee and to Speed tie with base 80 Speed Pokemon, most notably Glalie before it Mega Evolves. Life Orb is used to maximize damage output as well as give Shiftry the liberty to switch moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swords Dance Shiftry should be used as a late-game sweeper, and it should only attempt to sweep after all its checks and counters, such as Virizion, Mega Glalie, and Drapion, have been weakened or beaten. Shiftry can also be used early-game for its strong Knock Off or to revenge kill with Sucker Punch. This will also lead the opponent into thinking that Shiftry is not carrying Swords Dance, only to be surprised with a late-game sweep. Knock Off should be spammed freely, as it cripples a lot of Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazards aid the sweep of Swords Dance Shiftry by inflicting residual damage on the opponent's Pokemon. As such, Spikes users such as Omastar, Accelgor, and Qwilfish are recommended. Omastar also has access to Stealth Rock, while Qwilfish can stack Toxic Spikes as well. Special wallbreakers, such as Clawitzer, Choice Specs Meloetta, and Choice Specs or Calm Mind Delphox, are good to wear down the opponent's walls, giving Shiftry an easier time sweeping. Hitmonlee also makes for a good partner, as it is a wallbreaker and has access to Rapid Spin to remove any entry hazards on Shiftry's side of the field.</p>"

  "Venusaur": {
    "overview": "<p>Venusaur boasts a good typing that grants it useful resistances to Water, Fairy, Grass, Fighting, and Electric, as well as an immunity to Toxic and powder moves plus the ability to absorb Toxic Spikes. It also has high Special Attack and powerful STAB moves in Leaf Storm and Sludge Bomb that prove to be very troublesome to a large majority of slower Pokemon, giving it amazing wallbreaking potential. Venusaur's Speed tier lets it outspeed most other wallbreakers as well, such as Exploud, Emboar, and Magneton. All of these traits give Venusaur great offensive and defensive presence. If that weren't enough, Venusaur can also be a potent Chlorophyll sweeper, using its bulk to set up Growths and overwhelm foes with +2 Giga Drains. However, Venusaur has several common weaknesses in Fire, Psychic, Flying, and Ice, of which many users outspeed Venusaur. Despite that, Venusaur has relatively minor flaws when its stats, typing, and movepool complement it so well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Venusaur may attempt to run a physical set due to its access to Swords Dance, Power Whip, and Knock Off, but it faces too much competition from Virizion and Torterra, which are faster and have better neutral coverage, respectively. Unfortunately, Weather Ball is incompatible with Chlorophyll, which is why it is not listed on the Chlorophyll sweeper's moveset.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Golbat shrugs off anything Venusaur wants to throw at it, Roosts off the damage, and retaliates with STAB Brave Bird; Golbat's only real annoyance is losing its item to Knock Off or getting put to sleep, but it still does not weaken its matchup against Venusaur. Drapion can check Venusaur due to its higher Speed, but Leaf Storm still stings a lot and the Speed advantage is lost against Chlorophyll Venusaur. The likes of Weezing and Garbodor can retaliate with Flamethrower or Gunk Shot, although being slower than Venusaur can limit their ability to check it, and boosted Solar Beams really sting. While a risky switch-in due to the threat of Sludge Bomb, opposing Venusaur can switch into Leaf Storm and force the -2 Special Attack Venusaur out.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Registeel can easily tank all of Venusaur's moves, even surviving a sun-boosted +2 Hidden Power Fire with some health to spare, and can cripple Venusaur with Thunder Wave. Escavalier counters Venusaur variants that lack Hidden Power Fire and can still check Hidden Power Fire Venusaur if it switches into Leaf Storm, as well as being immune to Sleep Powder and threatening back with powerful STAB attacks. Do note that while Bronzong can take Venusaur's STAB moves, it detests taking Knock Off or +2 sun-boosted Hidden Power Fire, and it struggles to take down bulkier variants with Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Delphox and Houndoom both have high-powered STAB moves that can OHKO Venusaur without trouble, and they can switch into Venusaur's Grass-type STAB attacks and Hidden Power Fire, as well as Knock Off in Houndoom's case, though Life Orb-boosted Sludge Bomb threatens to 2HKO and being poisoned cripples them, nor do they like being put to sleep. Non-Choice Scarf Emboar and Mega Camerupt can also easily KO Venusaur, but their lower Speed means they have to be ready to eat a big hit from offensive Venusaur.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Fletchinder is a huge threat to Chlorophyll Venusaur, as it can easily snipe it down with priority Acrobatics before Venusaur can do anything. Aerodactyl and Braviary also hit Venusaur hard, while Calm Mind Sigilyph and Golbat can shrug off Venusaur's hits.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: The likes of Delphox, Meloetta, Sigilyph, Medicham, Gallade, and Mesprit can all take down Venusaur, although Medicham's frailty and risk of a Speed tie mean it may well be KOed in return. Switching into Venusaur can be a difficult task for most of them, and none of them bar Gallade appreciate switching into a Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Sneasel and Mega Glalie can outspeed Venusaur and threaten it with their powerful Ice-type attacks, but they cannot switch in directly unless they predict Synthesis or Knock Off. Abomasnow risks being OHKOed by Sludge Bomb, but its Snow Warning reduces Synthesis's effectiveness and cancels out sun. All of these Ice-types can attempt to pick off a weakened Chlorophyll-boosted Venusaur with Ice Shard.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm is Venusaur's nuking attack, doing substantial damage to all but the bulkiest of Pokemon that resist it, although it harshly drops Venusaur's Special Attack per use. Sludge Bomb is a reliable and safe to throw out STAB move, as well as having a chance to poison foes. Synthesis keeps Venusaur healthy, which is important to help Venusaur last against the numerous defensive Pokemon it threatens. Sleep Powder allows Venusaur to shut down an additional threat or prevent foes from exploiting Venusaur, especially after Leaf Storm's Special Attack drop. It can also stop Steel- and Poison-types that wall or check Venusaur, namely Bronzong, Registeel, Eviolite Magneton, Golbat, defensive Drapion, Weezing, and Garbodor, from doing what they want, as well as allowing teammates to take advantage of them. Knock Off removes items and softens up the aforementioned Steel- and Poison-types to be KOed easier by teammates or Venusaur itself. Knock Off also OHKOes Hoopa and helps to ward off faster Psychic-types such as Delphox and Sigilyph from switching in.</p> <p>Giga Drain gives Venusaur an additional Grass-type move that doesn't lower its Special Attack while also recovering some health. It is not strongly advised to use replace Leaf Storm with Giga Drain, though, as Venusaur's offensive potential would suffer greatly. Hidden Power Fire pretty much targets only Escavalier and Magneton, as Knock Off or Leaf Storm is better or sufficient against every other notable Steel-type.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment maximizes Venusaur's offensive prowess. A Timid nature lets Venusaur outrun the likes of positive-natured Magneton, Hoopa, Magneton, Absol, and Smeargle, as well as the likes of neutral-natured Medicham, Gallade, Braviary, Hitmonlee, and opposing Venusaur. A Modest nature gives Venusaur even more power for efficient holepunching and consequently better odds of OHKOing Pokemon such as Aromatisse and Exploud, though this is usually less meaningful than the speed boost granted by a Timid nature. Life Orb grants Venusaur's attacks a substantial boost in power. Black Sludge can be used for longevity, although Venusaur's power drops noticeably. Overgrow is the most useful ability, as it can bolster Venusaur's power even further. Chlorophyll can be used as a safeguard against sun teams, as opposing Chlorophyll Venusaur's use of Hidden Power Fire renders it slower than Venusaur without it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Venusaur can switch into several defensive Pokemon such as Alomomola, Aromatisse, Hitmontop, Poliwrath, Qwilfish, and Seismitoad and even some stronger defensive Pokemon such as Diancie. It can threaten a large majority of Pokemon slower than it, including the likes of Rhyperior, Slowking, defensive Flygon, Steelix, Samurott, Abomasnow, and Exploud. Venusaur may also get attacking opportunities against certain faster offensive Pokemon, such as Virizion, Hitmonlee, Rotom-C, and Flygon. Once Venusaur is in a position to threaten a KO on a slower Pokemon, which isn't difficult, it can start punching holes in defensive cores, making it a terror against stall and balanced teams. Venusaur best fits on balance or offensive teams, which appreciate its wallbreaking prowess and defensive utility.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A core of Venusaur, Steelix, and a bulky Water-type, such as Alomomola, Slowking, or Jellicent, makes for an easy start to an effective balanced team combination. Venusaur doesn't have a terrific matchup against offensive teams, as its weaknesses are easily targeted, so Venusaur's partners should be suited to handle faster teams for it. Choice Scarf Medicham, Aerodactyl, Sneasel, Fletchinder, and Unburden Hitmonlee are examples of Pokemon that pose an immense threat to offensive teams, and most defensive measures the opponent has for these Pokemon get preyed upon by Venusaur. Particularly, Fletchinder has Will-O-Wisp to make it easier for Venusaur to switch into Fletchinder's counters, whereas Sneasel can Pursuit trap Psychic-types, such as Bronzong, Meloetta, Sigilyph, and Delphox, that would threaten Venusaur. Pursuit support from the likes of Sneasel, Spiritomb, Houndoom, Drapion, and Absol can be useful for Venusaur in general, though this is slightly less important should Venusaur carry Knock Off.</p> <p>Venusaur especially appreciates teammates that resist or can capitalize on its weaknesses. Most Stealth Rock users, such as Rhyperior, Seismitoad, Steelix, Bronzong, Diancie, and Mega Camerupt, resist and can threaten most of Venusaur's checks, as well as set up Stealth Rock to make it easier for Venusaur to attain KOs. The aforementioned Aerodactyl is an especially appealing offensive teammate due to its Fire and Flying resistances. The likes of Houndoom, Steelix, Slowking, and Rhyperior can enter battle by switching into Venusaur's weaknesses.</p>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Giga Drain does good damage while replenishing some of Venusaur's health. Sludge Bomb is Venusaur's stronger STAB move and has a chance to poison foes. Synthesis keeps Venusaur healthy when Giga Drain's recovery would not suffice, which is important to help Venusaur keep up against the numerous defensive Pokemon it threatens. Leech Seed gives Venusaur a much easier time fending off boosting Fighting-types, such as Scrafty and Gurdurr, and allows it to wear down bulky Steel- and Poison-types, as well as making it easier for Venusaur's teammates to switch into its checks. Knock Off also wears down Steel- and Poison-types, as well as putting pressure on Psychic-type switch-ins. Venusaur has access to Roar, which can phaze setup sweepers, particularly Fighting-types, especially if Venusaur has been Knocked Off prior, meaning those Fighting-types have little chance to break through Venusaur later.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>24 Special Attack EVs ensure Venusaur 2HKOes Virizion with Sludge Bomb. The HP, Defense, and Special Defense investment, coupled with a Bold nature, is tailored to prevent or minimize the chances of a 2HKO from the likes of Adamant Life Orb Reckless Hitmonlee's High Jump Kick, Choice Band Sawk's Close Combat, and Jolteon's super effective Hidden Power, all after Stealth Rock damage. The 16 Spe EVs allows Venusaur to outspeed Adamant Aggron and hit it with a Knock Off to remove its Choice Band before taking a Head Smash or take out a weakened Aggron with Giga Drain, although the Defense investment should not fall below 72 Defense EVs, as it hits a useful jump point; Special Defense and Special Attack EVs can be shifted for additional Speed as well. Venusaur can invest up to 180 Speed EVs to outrun positive-natured Abomasnow and a bit less to still outpace neutral-natured Samurott, Hoopa, Exploud, or Emboar. Any higher than 180 Speed EVs would begin to compromise its ability to take weaker hits, such as tank Rhyperior's Earthquake, +2 Virizion's Stone Edge, and super effective Hidden Powers from Jolteon. Black Sludge is used for greater longevity. Overgrow is the chosen ability because it can boost Venusaur's Giga Drain in a pinch to keep it healthy, and Chlorophyll is not as useful on a Venusaur set that does not fully invest in Speed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Defensive Venusaur acts mainly as a glue for teams that appreciate its typing. Bulky Venusaur can switch into several defensive Pokemon such as Alomomola, Diancie, Aromatisse, Hitmontop, Poliwrath, Qwilfish, and Seismitoad and can handle more offensive Pokemon, such as Hitmonlee, Sawk, tank Rhyperior. Venusaur's typing and longevity allow it to harass defensive teams, and its ability to absorb Toxic Spikes can be very useful for balanced teams relying on the likes of Blastoise and Hitmontop for entry hazard control. Venusaur can act as a soft Fighting-type check, particularly against the likes of Gurdurr, Scrafty, and Swords Dance Virizion lacking Zen Headbutt, though it is paramount that Venusaur isn't used as the team's lone Fighting-type response.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Venusaur primarily fits on bulkier, slower balanced teams, where its respectable offenses and decent Speed are helpful to provide fewer openings for opposing wallbreakers. Wish users such as Alomomola and Aromatisse make for good partners, keeping Venusaur healthy so that it does not have to use Synthesis as often. Alomomola has helpful Fire and Ice resistances, whereas Aromatisse provides a more solid Fighting-type switch-in to relieve Venusaur's burden and has Aromatherapy support; Venusaur in turn can help deal with their Electric, Grass, and Poison weaknesses.</p> <p>Venusaur can form a pivot core with bulky wallbreakers such as Choice Band Scrafty, Meloetta, Rhyperior, Aggron, and Druddigon. Stealth Rock users such as Steelix, Rhyperior, Seismitoad, Diancie, Mega Camerupt, and Mawile have good defensive synergy with Venusaur and provide Stealth Rock to help Venusaur put more pressure on switch-ins. Many offensive Pokemon like Venusaur's ability to prey on Fairy- and Water-types and can wear down Steel-types for each other; the likes of Swords Dance Absol, Dragon Dance Scrafty, Emboar, Virizion, Sigilyph, and Houndoom provide immediately threatening offensive presences, while Venusaur helps to pivot into their weaknesses.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Growth doubles Venusaur's Attack and Special Attack in the sun. Giga Drain does damage and replenishes Venusaur's health, making it very easy to set up Growth, as Venusaur can simply heal off any damage it takes while setting up. Sludge Bomb is Venusaur's main weapon against Fire- and Flying-types and is its strongest attack outside of sun.</p> <p>Sleep Powder puts foes to sleep, which allows Venusaur to circumvent Sucker Punch and get free Growth turns, though one should be aware of the remaining usable sun turns while using this move to help set up. Sleep Powder is also great to use on the final turn of sun, allowing Venusaur's sun-setting teammates to switch in safely. Solar Beam is used as a disgustingly strong nuke; a Modest +2 Life Orb Solar Beam is able to cleanly OHKO offensive Drapion, for instance, much less Pokemon that do not resist Grass. Hidden Power Fire is primarily used to smack Steel-types that resist both of Venusaur's STAB moves, such as Escavalier, Bronzong, and Registeel, while also receiving a boost from sun.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment maximizes Venusaur's offensive potential. Chlorophyll is the obvious ability of choice for a set that relies on sun to function. A Modest nature gives Venusaur the most damage output; Timid can be used to outspeed opposing Chlorophyll Venusaur, but be aware that Venusaur's use of Hidden Power Fire means that its Speed IVs would be imperfect, rendering it always slower than opposing Timid Chlorophyll Venusaur without Hidden Power Fire. Life Orb is used to enhance Venusaur's power, and Venusaur cares very little about the recoil when it can simply override it with Giga Drain.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Venusaur's first priority as a Chlorophyll sweeper is to set up and sweep while remaining healthy. Using its bulk and typing, Venusaur should be able to find a target that cannot threaten it with an immediate KO and use Growth in the sun, after which it can Giga Drain foes for the OHKO while recovering a majority of its health back, making it that much harder for the opposing team to revenge kill Venusaur. Of course, KOing the foe can take precedence, as Venusaur would not like to waste precious sun turns. Should Sludge Bomb, Solar Beam, or sun-boosted Hidden Power Fire be able to KO a foe that Giga Drain would fail to, Venusaur should prioritize the KO, although a weakened Venusaur can use its target to replenish health if Venusaur is at no risk of taking more damage than Giga Drain can heal.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Venusaur's first choices of teammates are those that can set up sun, of which there are some noteworthy candidates. Mesprit, Uxie, and Diancie can set up Stealth Rock in addition to Sunny Day, and all have their own methods of allowing Venusaur to enter battle safely, whether via U-turn, Healing Wish, Memento, or Explosion. Memento in particular synergizes well with Venusaur, as it gives Venusaur more setup opportunities. Liepard and Volbeat have Prankster Sunny Day and can give Venusaur a potential free switch in by virtue of Encore and U-turn.</p> <p>Venusaur highly appreciates teammates that can make use of sun in order to weaken each other's checks. Other Chlorophyll sweepers, such as Shiftry, Victreebel, and Exeggutor, are fine choices, while Fire-types such as Delphox, Houndoom, Emboar, and Mega Camerupt can wallbreak with sun-fueled Fire-type attacks, easily demolishing anything that Venusaur may have trouble breaking through.</p> <p>Pokemon that can circumvent Fletchinder are of utmost importance, as Venusaur would otherwise get its sweep impeded. Diancie can keep Fletchinder at bay, although its longevity on a sun team can be questionable. Electric-types such as Jolteon and Magneton are worth consideration because they can bring Venusaur into battle via Volt Switch and have sun fuel their Fire-type coverage moves.</p>"

  "Blastoise": {
    "overview": "<p>Blastoise is the most reliable spinner in the RU tier. With a solid pure Water typing, good defenses, and access to Foresight, Blastoise is bound to successfully use Rapid Spin multiple times during matches. It has favorable matchups against many common entry hazard setters in RU, such as Rhyperior and Bronzong, which not only can grant it opportunities to switch-in, but also allows it to remove the source of the entry hazards while also removing entry hazards themselves. Blastoise's typing is also favorable for taking physical attacks, and it has pretty good physical bulk when fully invested. However, Blastoise's lack of reliable recovery and vulnerability to status ailments constantly threaten to shorten its lifespan. RU also has plenty of bulky Water-types to choose from, such as Slowking, Alomomola, and Seismitoad, so Blastoise has a hard time fitting onto teams that don't specifically need Rapid Spin support. While the threat of Scald burns and a respectable base 85 Special Attack make it tricky for most Pokemon to switch into it, Grass-types such as Venusaur and Virizion have next to no issues switching into Blastoise and threatening its team with their powerful attacks. While Blastoise is almost always used exclusively as a spinner, it does the job well and won't let you down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Easily the most notable alternative option on Blastoise is a more offensive EV spread for bulky offense teams. Such a set should consist of Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, Rapid Spin, and an extra utility option, such as Dark Pulse or Foresight. This set makes Blastoise play more aggressively with its passable base 85 Special Attack. Blastoise can attempt to utilize Choice Specs and Choice Scarf sets with the powerful Water Spout. However, Choice Specs sets are too slow to utilize this, while it generally doesn't have enough power with Choice Scarf. The combination of Rest and Sleep Talk is the only form of recovery Blastoise has access to. However, its unreliability makes it an inferior option compared to Wish support, which can be easily provided. Dragon Tail is an option over Roar if you're concerned about Taunt users, but Blastoise's generally low damage output invites Substitute users more often. Haze can allow Blastoise to stop \"last Pokemon\" setup sweepers, such as Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary, but the move is inferior to Roar and Dragon Tail otherwise.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Not many Pokemon directly \"counter\" Blastoise, as its job is to use Rapid Spin and it has Foresight to nullify Ghost-types. However, taking advantage of it is a completely different story:</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Even with Ice Beam, most Grass-types, such as Virizion and Venusaur, can switch into Blastoise freely and do as they please. It's even worse if Blastoise lacks Ice Beam, which it will most of the time.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: If Blastoise is not running Foresight, Ghost-types prevent it from spinning. Rotom is the most notable Ghost-type, as it threatens Blastoise with Electric-type moves - even if it's caught with Foresight upon switching in. Jellicent and Gourgeist-XL are also noteworthy options, but they can't deter Blastoise as easily if it has Foresight. While not too relevant, Choice Band Trevenant also makes for a good stop to Blastoise, as it can OHKO it with a boosted Wood Hammer.</p> <p><strong>Status Ailments</strong>: Blastoise lacks reliable recovery and is vulnerable to Toxic poison and burn. Toxic Spikes users can make Blastoise suffer from poison just to get rid of the entry hazard if it lacks a grounded Poison-type partner. Ghost-types can punish its Rapid Spin with Toxic or Will-O-Wisp, while anything neutral to Scald and indifferent to a burn can generally stay in to afflict Blastoise with a status ailment.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: With no reliable recovery, anything that can hit Blastoise for high damage can at least check it and make it think twice about using Rapid Spin. Electric-types, such as Manectric, Rotom-C, and Eelektross are especially notable due to their super effective STAB moves, as are powerful Pokemon that can hit Blastoise neutrally, such as Meloetta and Absol. Keep in mind that most of the Pokemon that fall under this category don't exactly like Scald burns.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: If all else fails, you can throw out your own Water-type against Blastoise. While they typically can't do much back themselves, they can at least absorb a possible Scald burn and threaten Blastoise out with their own Toxic or Scald burn. Samurott and Slowking are notable for being able to use Blastoise as setup fodder or outright deal heavy damage with a Life Orb-boosted Grass Knot and a Choice Specs-boosted Psychic, respectively.</p>",

      "Bulky Spinner": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Blastoise's standard set in RU takes advantage of its good defensive typing and access to Rapid Spin to support its team. Scald is Blastoise's STAB move of choice, as the 30% chance to burn the foe is useful in deterring most physical attackers from trying to take advantage of it. Rapid Spin is Blastoise's main niche, and its solid bulk means it can find multiple chances to get rid of entry hazards for your team. Toxic allows Blastoise to put defensive Pokemon on a timer, which can help offensive teammates push past them. This is especially useful for crippling Uxie and Seismitoad, as they are common Stealth Rock users that Blastoise has a hard time wearing down otherwise. Refresh is the best move in the last slot, as it guarantees that Blastoise beats prolific Stealth Rock users such as Seismitoad and Bronzong while also allowing Blastoise to spin with impunity against defensive Pokemon and not be crippled after removing Toxic Spikes. Protect can also be run in the last slot, allowing Blastoise to gain extra passive recovery, scout for moves from powerful Choice item users, and stall for burn or poison damage. Foresight is an option if your team absolutely needs Blastoise to use Rapid Spin in the face of Ghost-types. However, Ghost-types are not very common in RU, and one of the most common ones, Rotom, beats Blastoise anyway. Roar is an option to prevent the likes of Calm Mind Sigilyph and Substitute users in general from setting up on Blastoise. This is best used with Spikes support, but Blastoise's main job is to ensure entry hazards are off its side of the field. Ice Beam is an option if you want Blastoise to punish Grass-types such as Virizion and Venusaur for trying to switch into it while preventing setup from Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary. However, it has a relatively low damage output against even intended targets due to the lack of Special Attack investment on this set.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread maximizes Blastoise's physical bulk, giving it the best possible matchups against entry hazard users in RU. Leftovers is the only item worth considering, as Blastoise lacks reliable recovery of any sort outside of this. While a specially defensive EV spread is can be used, Blastoise's typing doesn't let it beat notable special attackers with the investment, making it a poor option. Torrent is used over Rain Dish, as rain teams are incredibly rare in RU and Blastoise is one of the faster defensive Pokemon in the tier, thus allowing it to use a stronger Scald against most other defensive Pokemon in the tier when it's low on health.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Perhaps the best tip is to make sure your team needs Rapid Spin support before choosing to put Blastoise on your team, as outside of Rapid Spin, it doesn't have much over other bulky Water-types in RU. Blastoise can handle the likes of Rhyperior, Bronzong, and most other entry hazard users in RU, so try to switch it into them to prevent them from having a huge impact with their entry hazards. As Blastoise is a Water-type, it has the typical decent matchup against most Fire-types. Make sure Blastoise isn't exposed to status ailments or Knock Off, as Leftovers is the only source of recovery it has. Blastoise has a very poor matchup against most Grass-types, so make sure it has backup against them. If you're in doubt, click Scald. That 30% burn chance is enough to make most Pokemon think twice about trying to switch into Blastoise, especially physical attackers. Catch defensive Pokemon switching in with Toxic. This is especially nice if Blastoise is generally an \"easy\" switch-in for the defensive Pokemon that is holding back your win condition from pushing through the opponent's team. When running Protect, it's never a bad move to use if you suspect that the foe is holding a Choice item. In the process, it also provides Blastoise extra Leftovers recovery and can possibly stall for a turn of burn or poison damage as well. If Foresight is being used, make sure to catch Ghost-types with it as they switch into Blastoise trying to block Rapid Spin.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Blastoise is most vulnerable to Grass-types, it appreciates any teammate that matches up well against them. Roselia is very notable because it can not only set up Spikes but also utilize Natural Cure to absorb status moves aimed at Blastoise. Venusaur also generally fares well against Grass-types thanks to its powerful STAB Sludge Bomb. All three of these choices can also absorb Toxic Spikes to lessen pressure on Blastoise to get rid of entry hazards. While they have to be more wary of coverage options or secondary STAB moves, Fire-types can more aggressively remove Grass-types from play. Houndoom and Emboar are powerful options that appreciate Rapid Spin support and have no issues with getting rid of most Grass-types. Wish and cleric support is nice if it can be afforded, as Blastoise lacks reliable recovery and is vulnerable to all status ailments. Aromatisse provides both and is a stronger choice with Blastoise than Alomomola due to Alomomola having redundant defensive synergy with Blastoise. Togetic and Diancie have great mixed bulk and are able to easily fit Heal Bell into purely defensive sets, although Togetic isn't very good with Wish. Any offensive Pokemon that appreciates Rapid Spin support can be used with Blastoise to varying degrees. The most notable are Fletchinder, Aerodactyl, Mega Glalie, and the previously mentioned Fire-types. Choice item users, such as  Meloetta and Aggron, appreciate Rapid Spin so that they can be more aggressive with switching in.</p>"

  "Golbat": {
    "overview": "<p>As a guaranteed means of removing entry hazards, Defog is one of the most important moves in the RU metagame—and as a fairly bulky Pokemon with a good defensive typing and a reliable recovery move, Golbat is one of its best users. It also has serious utility with Infiltrator Toxic, which allows it to cripple threatening boosters such as SubCM Meloetta right through their Substitutes, as well as Super Fang and Taunt, which let it wear down Steel-types like few others and take on defensive Pokemon and hazards users, respectively. Although Golbat walls Grass-types quite well and takes on Fighting-types pretty well with a STAB Brave Bird, its typing unfortunately leaves it open to being hit super effectively by a whole heap of strong offensive types, specifically Electric, Ice, Rock, and Psychic. While Golbat is capable of tanking hits and Defogging away hazards, it often lets entry hazard users, especially the prominent Mega Steelix and Rhyperior, switch back in and reset their hazards, and it certainly can't come in on them to Defog; it also lets most Steel-types do whatever they want, though Taunt and Super Fang generally help in these regards. Because Golbat is weak to the Stealth Rock it is tasked with removing, and because the Fighting-types it walls often carry Knock Off to remove its Eviolite and thus slash its defenses, Golbat can be hard-pressed to stay alive and keep doing its job, but it can definitely fill the needs of your team if used correctly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Golbat can use Haze or Whirlwind to confound setup Pokemon or Curse to become one itself. U-turn is an interesting option, but the thought of potentially taking Stealth Rock damage multiple times just to keep momentum is a bracing one. Golbat can break stall with a moveset of Taunt / Super Fang / Roost / Brave Bird, with the option to use Toxic over either attacking move, but this set ultimately either fails to stallbreak consistently or lacks a STAB move and thus is ineffective in most other situations. Hypnosis is an interesting option to inflict the prized sleep status, but its inaccuracy makes it an unappealing choice, though Defog's evasion drops can ease accuracy concerns.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Setters</strong>: Any entry hazard setter that Golbat cannot defeat annoys it; many Steel- and Rock-types, as well as Mega Glalie, fall under this aegis. Registeel, Bronzong, Rhyperior, and Mega Steelix, as well as Regirock, can more or less switch in on Golbat and reset their entry hazards, though the Rock-types won't appreciate Toxic and none of them will appreciate Super Fang or to a lesser extent Taunt. Pokemon such as Qwilfish, Accelgor, and Kricketune can set up dangerous entry hazards while discouraging Golbat from coming in or stopping it from Defogging with Thunder Wave + Taunt, Final Gambit, and Knock Off + Taunt + Endeavor, respectively. However, Golbat has ways to come out on top as well, as it can Taunt Qwilfish first, Roost off much of the Final Gambit damage, and Brave Bird Kricketune to death while forcing it to choose between keeping up Sticky Web or actually damaging Golbat.</p> <p><strong>Braviary</strong>: Braviary can switch in on Defog and gain a +2 Attack boost thanks to Defiant, letting it plow through Golbat and quite possibly its entire team, although Physically Defensive Golbat can simply Toxic it as it comes in, Roost away as it attacks with futility, and possibly even Defog as it switches out, a risky maneuver that can nonetheless transfer the advantage to your side, both game-wise and mentally.</p> <p><strong>Type Advantage</strong>: As in most aspects of Pokemon, if the foe has a super effective move, its likelihood of coming out on top against Golbat is quite high. Pokemon such as Jolteon and Tyrantrum can switch in on Brave Bird or even Toxic or Super Fang if necessary and proceed to force Golbat out via the threat of setup or an OHKO. Mega Glalie, Mesprit, and Rotom-C are some examples of Pokemon that don't necessarily want to switch in but can if they must, and they can deal hefty amounts of damage to Golbat even if it has investment in the defensive stat they're striking.</p> <p><strong>Sheer Strength</strong>: Despite Golbat's good bulk, powerful offensive threats can still muscle through it, with or without super effective coverage. Some examples include Clawitzer, Exploud, and Life Orb Druddigon; in some cases, these attackers may falter if Golbat has investment in the defensive stat relevant to them, but extremely strong attackers such as the aforementioned Exploud may simply punch through Golbat despite its buffed-up defense stat.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Status</strong>: As a defensive Eviolite user whose STAB attack is physical, Golbat has serious problems with both Knock Off and burn. The former irrevocably slashes its bulk by 50%, while the latter wears away at it while reducing its offensive presence quite seriously; note that a teammate with Aromatherapy or Heal Bell can cure Golbat's burn, but burn is a serious, if short-lived, problem even with one of these teammates present. Knock Off users include Eelektross, Drapion, and Escavalier; note that some Knock Off users are actually countered by Golbat, such as Tangrowth and Hitmonlee, but can of course reduce its bulk seriously nevertheless. Pokemon such as Alomomola, Clawitzer, and Mega Banette can inflict burn upon Golbat.</p>",

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog gets rid of entry hazards, while Roost gets rid of incurred damage. Brave Bird prevents Golbat from being entirely Taunt bait and hits Fighting-, Bug- and Grass-types super effectively, which is convenient since Golbat also has a 4x resistance to those types. Toxic provides general wearing-down utility and specifically gives Golbat a tool to status foes behind a Substitute, ending any chance of them sweeping, while Super Fang does a lot of damage overall and gives Golbat a way to threaten Steel-types; Taunt messes with defensive Pokemon and lets Golbat defeat entry hazard users.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP EVs and an Eviolite confer general bulk, while 252 Defense EVs along with an Impish nature crucially buff up Golbat's physical bulk. Infiltrator allows Golbat to penetrate Substitutes for the team's benefit.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to Defog whenever you can, though if your opponent is likely to switch in a Stealth Rock user that beats Golbat, it may be best to just Roost and keep its health high, especially if your opponent also has a dangerous threat Golbat needs to stay alive for. In general, hitting a foe Golbat walls with Toxic and stalling it out with Roost is better than taking it out with Brave Bird, as the latter option can leave Golbat fairly low on HP, though feel free to finish it right away if Golbat has no other role to fill. If your opponent has a Fighting-type such as Hitmonlee or Sawk, Golbat will be hit by Knock Off; make peace with this, although trying to switch into Fighting-type moves is still a good idea. Watch out for coverage moves such as Stone Edge from Hitmonlee, and when faced with bulky Substitute boosters, simply hit them with Toxic and switch out to a teammate that walls them, which you should have considering the lack of power of most Substitute boosters. Golbat can take advantage of a fair few defensive Pokemon to Defog, including Amoonguss, Aromatisse, and even other Golbat, as well as Alomomola and Tangrowth, though you might want a cleric for the former and both can easily Knock Off Golbat's Eviolite.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Golbat appreciates special walls as partners, especially if they resist one of its weaknesses. Almost any Steel-type makes a good partner for Golbat in some fashion or another, as does any Knock Off absorber. Mega Steelix is both, and it's also a bulky Stealth Rock setter that can come in multiple times to reset Stealth Rock while taking Rock-type attacks and warding off Steel-types. Mega Steelix can also take general physical attacks as well as Psychic- and Electric-type attacks while thwarting Substitute boosters with Roar so Golbat can preserve its health and Toxic them only in lastmon situations or forgoing Stealth Rock entirely for a Curse set that defeats bulky boosters Golbat cannot. Some other Knock Off absorbers are Alomomola, Aromatisse, and (Mega) Audino. Alomomola can take on various special Pokemon or physical Knock Off users such as Hitmonlee and take on Clawitzer while healing Golbat with Wish, while Aromatisse can take on many Fighting-types and special attacks while healing Golbat with Aromatherapy or Wish. (Mega) Audino can do much of the same or act as a bulky win condition that works well with Super Fang Golbat; Mega Audino minds Knock Off not at all, and Audino can pass Wish and not mind thanks to Regenerator. Finally, Rhyperior can take on Rock- and Electric-types such as Tyrantrum while sponging Knock Off, essentially acting as a discount Mega Steelix in this role, though it is a very viable Pokemon.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog is a stellar way of getting rid of entry hazards and Roost keeps Golbat alive so it can keep Defogging. Brave Bird smacks around Grass- and Fighting-types and ensures Golbat is not made useless by Taunt, while Toxic lets Golbat cripple a multitude of Pokemon, notably dangerous threats like SubCM Meloetta, hitting it even behind a Substitute thanks to Infiltrator, and dangerous special attackers such as Clawitzer and Houndoom. Super Fang and Taunt let Golbat heavily wear down Steel-types that normally wall it and defeat and Defog on many defensive Pokemon and hazards setters that usually defeat it, respectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP EVs maximize overall bulk, while 176 SpD EVs and a Careful nature enhance Golbat's special bulk quite emphatically; 80 Speed EVs let Golbat outspeed Modest Exploud. Eviolite boosts Golbat's bulk by a ridiculous 50%, and Infiltrator allows it to Toxic or attack foes behind a Substitute.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Golbat should switch in on Hitmonlee, as well as on Clawitzer and weaker special attackers that cannot hit it super effectively. Try to come in on defensive Pokemon such as Aromatisse and Amoonguss, though for sleep-inducers you may want another Pokemon to take the sleep first. Switch in on Substitute boosters such as SubCM Meloetta, hit them with a Toxic, then either switch out to a teammate that walls them or stay in and Roost stall if Golbat does.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Physical walls like Alomomola and Aromatisse complement Golbat nicely, taking the hits it cannot and providing it with Wish support; Alomomola can more easily pass Wishes due to Regenerator, while Aromatisse can take over Fighting-type wall duty and keep Golbat status-free with Aromatherapy. Mega Steelix can consistently and continually set up Stealth Rock while taking Knock Off, as well as many other attacks Golbat is weak to, and checking Exploud and Steel-types. Mega Steelix can also Roar or Curse to take care of Substitute boosters to preserve Golbat's life, and Golbat in return takes on Fighting-types. Audino can form a specially defensive core with Golbat, passing Wishes to it and curing its status while sponging Volt Switch and using Knock Off on pesky Steel-types; Golbat returns these favors by stopping Fighting-types in their tracks. Meloetta is an interesting partner, able to take on opposing Psychic-types, absorb status, and check Fighting-types, while appreciating a solid Hitmonlee and Drapion check on its team.</p>"

Poliwrath's access to the rare move Circle Throw also makes it stand it out from other Water- and Fighting-types by limiting the amount of Pokemon that are capable of setting up on it. However, it is weak to common Grass- and Psychic-type moves and is generally passive, that allows very threatening Pokemon such as Meloetta, Sigilyph, and Venusaur to switch in and scare it out, often multiple times. Poliwrath also lacks reliable recovery, forcing it to rely on unreliable methods to keep itself healthy.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A specially offensive set with Hydro Pump, Focus Blast, Ice Beam, and Vacuum Wave holding Life Orb or Choice Specs can turn Poliwrath into a surprise attacker. Swift Swim turns Poliwrath into a threatening sweeper under rain, but it is outclassed by stronger Swift Swimmers such as Ludicolo and Kabutops. Hypnosis can disrupt the opponent while providing some momentum, but its accuracy is too much of a liability. The combination of Substitute and Focus Punch can be used to pressure opponents, but being unable to immediately use it is a letdown, along with that fact that most Pokemon that resist Fighting can deal with Poliwrath's other attacks. Lastly, Poliwrath could attempt to run certain coverage options such as Earthquake for Electric-types and Ice Beam for Grass-types, but they're usually hard to fit with its other moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Venusaur and Roselia shrug off Scald and have super effective moves to hit Poliwrath with in return.</p> <p><strong>Electric- and Flying-types</strong>: Although they can't switch into Poliwrath's attacks directly, Electric-types such as Manectric and Jolteon and Flying-types such as Braviary and Fletchinder threaten Poliwrath with their respective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Jellicent</strong>: Jellicent is immune to both Circle Throw and Scald, countering Poliwrath in nearly any situation.</p> <p><strong>Aromatisse</strong>: Aromatisse resists Circle Throw, can cure itself from burns with Heal Bell, and threatens Poliwrath with its STAB Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-type Pokemon such as Meloetta and Sigilyph have little trouble switching into Poliwrath, and from there can force it out with the threat of a super effective Psychic.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Circle Throw is a STAB move that forces switches and racks up entry hazard damage. Scald is used for its high chance to inflict a burn rather than for its power. Rest, in conjunction with Sleep Talk, allows Poliwrath to recover all lost health and cures it from any status ailments, although Sleep Talk is a tad unreliable. Waterfall is an option over Scald for a stronger STAB move, but it isn't very powerful and the burn chance from Scald outweighs any additional benefits that Waterfall provides. The combination of Protect + Toxic is a good alternative over RestTalk, as it makes so that Poliwrath doesn't get worn down as quickly and suck up momentum for balanced teams, while exploiting Scrafty's reliance on High Jump Kick. In addition, Poliwrath is able to cripple opposing bulky Water-types and other such Pokemon with Toxic, thereby limiting the amount of Pokemon capable of switching in on it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The listed EVs maximize Poliwrath's physical bulk. A Relaxed nature is chosen because it adds to Poliwrath's bulk without lowering the damage output of Poliwrath's attacks, and the drop in Speed is not very important, as Poliwrath doesn't outspeed anything notable. Leftovers gives Poliwrath a form of consistent recovery, although Rocky Helmet is also an option because it adds chip damage. However, using any other item besides Leftovers means Poliwrath gets worn down even quicker than usual.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Poliwrath is best used as a wall against physical attackers such as Sneasel. Poliwrath should try and stay at high health to avoid using Rest, as Sleep Talk can be unreliable. Try to avoid using Poliwrath against physical attackers that have super effective moves, as even though Poliwrath is bulky, it doesn't enjoy stomaching these hits. Spamming Circle Throw is what Poliwrath does best, so try to use it as often as possible. Use Protect on High Jump Kick users such as Scrafty and Hitmonlee when needed. Against Pokemon that can threaten it but are incapable of setting up, taking a turn to use Protect to garner Leftovers recovery, stall for status damage, and possibly scout for their next possible move is a good idea. Use Toxic when forcing a switch from the likes of Houndoom to cripple bulky Water-types. Additionally, if you can predict when the opponent is going to use a Water-type move, you can switch Poliwrath into it and regain health.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support such as Stealth Rock from Registeel and Diancie, which can also switch into Flying-type attacks for Poliwrath, and Spikes from Roselia and Ferroseed can help Poliwrath rack up more damage with Circle Throw. Psychic-types such as Meloetta and Delphox appreciate the pressure Poliwrath puts on Pokemon that threaten them such as Sneasel and Houndoom, while they can threaten Grass-types such as Venusaur. Clerics such as Togetic, Aromatisse, and Diancie, the latter of which can also alleviate pressure from Houndoom and check Flying-types, allow Poliwrath to use Rest more freely, making it less reliant on Sleep Talk.</p>"

Magneton works the best on offensive and balanced builds and possesses the ability to function in a VoltTurn core. All of Magneton's abilities are of great assistance to it, whether it be through the extra power Analytic brings, the ability to take a hit with Sturdy, or the ability to trap an opposing Steel-type with Magnet Pull. Furthermore, Magneton can work as one of the best offensive Braviary, Fletchinder, and Vivillon checks. However, because of its mediocre Speed tier, many faster Pokemon can revenge kill Magneton. Furthermore, it has a crippling 4x weakness to Ground-type attacks and a weakness to Fire- and Fighting-type moves. Ground-types also stop Magneton from actively using Volt Switch and Thunderbolt. Finally, Magneton has relatively poor bulk.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Magnet Pull with Eviolite and Magnet Rise can be used to trap Pokemon like Escavalier, Steelix, and Bronzong in conjunction with Hidden Power Fire. Eviolite, in general, can be used to increase bulk and give Magneton the ability to switch up moves; however, Choice Specs is preferred due to the power it provides. Choice Scarf can be used to revenge kill and surprise faster Pokemon like Sneasel. Magneton can run Hidden Power Ice to OHKO all Flygon variants.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-type Pokemon like Flygon, Rhyperior, and Mega Camerupt are all of annoyance to Magneton due to their access to Ground-type STAB moves and their ability to stop Volt Switch and Thunderbolt from being spammed through their typing. Mega Camerupt, Seismitoad, and Steelix are especially annoying due to them resisting Flash Cannon as well.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-type Pokemon like Hitmonlee, Medicham, and Virizion often outspeed Magneton and can easily revenge kill it. Also, many of these Pokemon such as Gurdurr have priority Fighting-type STAB moves like Mach Punch, which can easily whittle Magneton down. Virizion can take advantage of Magneton if it is locked into an Electric-type STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon like Houndoom, Delphox, and Choice Scarf Emboar can threaten Magneton with their super effective STAB moves. Furthermore, they resist Flash Cannon outspeed and KO back.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Eelektross and Jolteon can survive any attack from Magneton and threaten to OHKO in return, while bulky Pokemon like Lanturn can eat up any attacks Magneton has to offer and retaliate with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Bulky Pokemon like Bronzong, Ferroseed, and Registeel can easily withstand Magneton's hits and whittle it down with moves like Earthquake, Seismic Toss, and Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Magneton's mediocre bulk and the fact that it is locked into an attack with Choice Specs, it becomes very predictable and easy to revenge kill. For this reason, it is it recommended to switch out against faster Pokemon.</p>",

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch is the primary Electric-type STAB move, as it allows Magneton to gain momentum by switching to an appropriate counter against its checks. Furthermore, it inflicts more damage when foes switch out, as they usually do, through Analytic. Thunderbolt is another Electric-type STAB move that allows Magneton to deal more damage while not having to switching out. It allows Magneton to function as a more effective late-game cleaner. Both of these STAB moves primarily target Flying- and Water-types. Flash Cannon targets Pokemon that resist or are immune to Electric-type STAB attacks while also hitting Fairy-, Rock-, and Steel-types super effectively. Hidden Power Water allows Magneton to hit Mega Camerupt and Steelix, both of which resist its STAB moves; alternatively, Hidden Power Grass allows Magneton to hit Seismitoad, Lanturn, and Gastrodon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack and 252 Speed EVs are used to maximize Magneton's offensive presence. Analytic works well on Magneton, as opponents often switch to a check fearing the Steel- and Electric-type coverage. Sturdy can be used an alternative ability to let Magneton stay in on any Pokemon, tank a move, and KO back, functioning as effective revenge killer. Choice Specs is used because Magneton appreciates the extra power, allowing it to act as a decent wallbreaker. A Timid nature allows Magneton to outspeed neutral-natured Hoopa, Braviary, Gallade, Medicham, Venusaur, Samurott, Ludicolo, and Absol as well as positive-natured Abomasnow and Emboar. A Modest nature is used when Speed is not needed and power is of more concern in whittling walls, as well as checks with Volt Switch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring in Magneton on slower Pokemon, as faster Pokemon can revenge kill it easily, unless it's using Sturdy. Magneton can be brought in and used to check a variety of Flying-type Pokemon like Braviary, Fletchinder, and Vivillon. Analytic will primarily be taken advantage of through foes switching out rather than moving last. Avoid Electric-type STAB move usage when a Ground-type Pokemon is present on opposing teams. Instead, use Flash Cannon. Volt Switch to checks and counters of Pokemon that are switched in, or to faster Pokemon like Scyther that carry U-turn, as they can effectively pivot to one another. Watch out for Pokemon that might surprise Magneton with a Choice Scarf such as Emboar and Hoopa. Avoid staying in on Pokemon that carry Earthquake like Mega Glalie and Flygon unless you are sure Magneton outspeeds and can KO them or has full health and can KO back thanks to Sturdy.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>VoltTurn partners like Flygon and Scyther can form an effective core with Magneton. Water- and Ground-type Pokemon are good partners, as they can beat Mega Camerupt. Examples include Slowking, Seismitoad, and Flygon. Pokemon that beat Seismitoad are also beneficial partners, so Grass-types work well, examples including Virizion and Venusaur. Pokemon that can switch in on Ground-type moves also pair well with Magneton; therefore, Grass- and Flying-types are good partners. Examples include Braviary and Sigilyph. Alomomola can be a beneficial partner, as Magneton likes receiving Wish support and it also has good defensive synergy with Magneton. Pokemon that appreciate coming in for free due to Volt Switch such as Hoopa are also good teammates. Setup sweepers like Virizion and Fletchinder can be used with Magneton, as it can pivot out to them on something they can set up on. Flygon and Blastoise are valid partners because they can clear entry hazards and thereby allow Sturdy to remain intact. Healing Wish and Heal Bell support is recommended so Magneton doesn't get worn down easily by Will-O-Wisp and Acrobatics if it's being used as a primary Fletchinder check, and Healing Wish also works well with Sturdy.</p>"

  "Hitmonlee": {
    "overview": "<p>Hitmonlee is a big presence in RU thanks to its solid base 120 Attack stat and the great combination of Reckless and High Jump Kick as well as a bunch of cool moves including Knock Off and Rapid Spin, which make it a great wallbreaker and partner for Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon. Hitmonlee also has another useful ability in Unburden, which makes it a formidable late-game sweeper. However, Hitmonlee's average base 87 Speed and low HP and Defense leave it easily stopped by common Pokemon such as Aromatisse, Togetic, and Fletchinder.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hitmonlee can run two Unburden sets; one takes advantage of Endure, Liechi Berry, and Reversal, and the second, albeit less useful, set uses Fake Out and a Normal Gem. Double-Edge can work well with Reckless to 2HKO Aromatisse after Stealth Rock, though the recoil wears down Hitmonlee too quickly. Earthquake hits some Poison-types such as Garbodor and Qwilfish, and Blaze Kick can be used for Venusaur. Hitmonlee can also use a Choice Band, which lets it hit really hard; however, it won't be able to switch moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-type Resistances</strong>: Pokemon that can reliably tank Hitmonlee's STAB moves and other attacks include Qwilfish, Aromatisse, Togetic, Granbull, and Garbodor. However, Ghost-types, such as Jellicent, and NFE Pokemon that hold Eviolite, such as Togetic and Golbat, all detest Knock Off; the latter also dislikes Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Protect Users</strong>: Protect Users can Protect against a predicted High Jump Kick and cause Hitmonlee to lose half of its HP; Alomomola is a great Protect user.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon, especially physical attackers, can easily revenge kill Hitmonlee because of its low Defense stat, though they should be wary of its priority moves and Choice Scarf set.</p> <p><strong>Spiritomb</strong>: Spiritomb is immune to High Jump Kick, Mach Punch, Reversal, and Rapid Spin, and it doesn't care about Knock Off much; it also threatens Hitmonlee with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority attacks such as Fletchinder's Acrobatics can take down Hitmonlee easily because of its low Defense stat.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Reckless": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>High Jump Kick is Hitmonlee's best STAB move, OHKOing a lot of bulky Pokemon, such as Escavalier, thanks to the boosts from Reckless and Life Orb. Knock Off is a great coverage move that can deal with Ghost- and Psychic-types and also cripples a lot of Pokemon, such as Golbat and Togetic, by removing their items. Mach Punch is a nice STAB priority move that can revenge kill a weakened Cinccino or Scrafty, and Sucker Punch can be used to surprise threats, such as Meloetta, Fletchinder, and Delphox, alongside Knock Off. Rapid Spin removes entry hazards from Hitmonlee's side of the field. Alternatively, Stone Edge can be used to hit Golbat, while Poison Jab is an option to hit Fairy-types, such as Aromatisse and Togetic, on the switch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With maximum Attack and Speed EVs, Hitmonlee hits hard and fast with the remaining 4 EVs put in Defense. An Adamant nature provides more power, specifically letting Hitmonlee always OHKO Druddigon and Escavalier, but Jolly can be used to outspeed Braviary, Kabutops, and Rotom-C, along with opposing Adamant Hitmonlee. Reckless powers up High Jump Kick and Life Orb lets Hitmonlee do more damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Beware of using High Jump Kick if the opponent has a Ghost-type or may have Protect, as Hitmonlee will lose 50% of its health in these cases, though you can safely spam High Jump Kick if they don't. You should try to use Knock Off on Ghost-types and Protect users, though it can be easily spammed in general to remove items and hurt Ghost-types, especially considering Hitmonlee's checks, such as Golbat, rely on their items. Rapid Spin can be used to remove hazards when needed, and Hitmonlee can be saved to revenge kill some Pokemon, such as Nasty Plot Houndoom or Delphox, with its priority moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hitmonlee appreciates having entry hazard support because it forces a lot of switches, so Omastar, Accelgor, Crustle, and Qwilfish are nice teammates to have. Poison-types like Drapion and Steel-types such as Escavalier can be used to deal with Fairy-types such as Aromatisse and Togetic. Grass-types, such as Virizion and Venusaur, can take on Alomomola, which can be a threatening check for Hitmonlee. Pokemon that appreciate having entry hazards removed by Hitmonlee's Rapid Spin are also nice teammates to have; some of these Pokemon include Fletchinder, Houndoom, and Mega Glalie.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hitmonlee hits really hard with Reckless High Jump Kick. Knock Off hits Ghost- and Psychic-types that don't care about High Jump Kick and can be used to revenge kill some of them, such as Delphox, or to remove Golbat's Eviolite on the switch. Stone Edge deals with Golbat, which doesn't care much about the other two moves. Close Combat can be used to late-game clean safely without risking High Jump Kick's chance to miss, and Rapid Spin can be used to remove entry hazards, though you won't want to get locked into it very often.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf boosts Hitmonlee's average Speed and outspeeds some fast Pokemon, such as Delphox and even Jolteon, even with an Adamant nature, allowing it to perform really well as a revenge killer. Jolly is used over Adamant to outspeed Choice Scarf Braviary and Rotom-C, but the power given by an Adamant nature can be appreciated, too.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set lets Hitmonlee function as a revenge killer for threats such as Delphox and a late-game cleaner once the opposing team is weakened enough. Avoid using High Jump Kick if the opponent has a Ghost-type or may use Protect, as Hitmonlee will lose half of its HP along with a lot of momentum, so go with Knock Off if you predict a Ghost-type coming in. Also, don't use Rapid Spin unless you're facing something that Hitmonlee forces to switch out and the foe lacks a Ghost-type.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Omastar, Accelgor, Crustle, and Qwilfish can provide Hitmonlee with the entry hazard support that takes its switch-forcing game to the next level. Psychic-types including Delphox and Meloetta can take on Poison-types such as Golbat as well as Aromatisse, though Drapion and Skuntank are immune to Psychic-type attacks, so having a Ground-type on your team such as Rhyperior that can take on those is also a good idea. Having wallbreakers such as Life Orb Druddigon and Exploud is also cool, as they weaken the opposing team, allowing Hitmonlee to late-game clean more reliably.</p>"

  "Scyther": {
    "overview": "<p>Scyther has a generic Bug / Flying typing, but its stat spread is very different from other Pokemon of its type. It is a good pivot with access to STAB U-turn coming off of its base 110 Attack, which, when coupled with a Choice Band, can provide free switches for your team. Additionally, Scyther is a nice check to Fighting- and Grass-type Pokemon by virtue of its typing, and it pretty much guarantees that your team won't have to worry about Malamar from the start of the match, as a Choice Band-boosted U-turn is very threatening to Malamar. Scyther possesses a solid base 105 Speed tier, outspeeding all but a few Pokemon in the tier. Defensively, Scyther can pivot into Ground-, Fighting-, and Grass-type moves because of the lack of damage those moves inflict upon Scyther. However, Scyther's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock really stops it from switching in a lot without good entry hazard removal support or a team that applies a lot of offensive pressure on opposing Stealth Rock users. Scyther also has unfortunate weaknesses to common attacking types in Ice, Electric, Rock, and Flying, so it can lack defensive utility in some situations. Additionally, its mediocre 70 / 80 / 80 bulk can limit its ability to pivot in and fire off attacks without slow VoltTurn support, which, when coupled with its weaknesses, can make it a liability defensively at times. Lastly, Scyther doesn't possess the mind-boggling power of Medicham or Hitmonlee as a wallbreaker, so it has a hard time breaking through bulkier teams without proper support and ends up being more of a pivot than anything else.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An additional option could be using an Eviolite set with Swords Dance, but the hit-and-run tactic employed by Choice Band has more immediate power and doesn't leave Scyther strapped for offensive moveslots. A Choice Scarf set could be used for its surprise factor to pick up KOs against faster Pokemon such as Jolteon, and Accelgor, but it lacks the power of Choice Band, and U-turn frankly doesn't do that much damage without a boosting item. Reversal can also be used on Scyther to surprise Steel-types that usually beat it after coming into Stealth Rock twice, since it becomes a super powerful 200-Base Power move, but this means that Scyther can't switch in again and is super situational and can often be a wasted moveslot. An additional STAB option that Scyther can use is Bug Bite since sometimes having U-turn as Scyther's only Bug-type STAB can be really harmful in late-game situations against Psychic-types that can take a U-turn and OHKO a Fighting-type you might have in the back for another member of their team. However, Aerial Ace can usually do a better job at this due to its superior offensive typing. Brick Break is also nice for breaking through Rock-types and Steel-types that normally counter Scyther in the right situations; however, it can only be used against defensive Pokemon that lack reliable recovery or are close to or 2HKOed by the move such as Registeel and Magneton, or else it becomes a waste of time in the long run. Quick Attack can be an option for teams that need priority and is boosted by Technician, so it can get some clutch late-game revenge kills versus offensive Pokemon like Fletchinder and Jolteon, but it can cause Scyther to become setup bait for threats like Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary and Swords Dance Virizion. Lastly, Steel Wing could also be used to lure and KO Diancie and Aerodactyl, but it's too situational to justify using most of the time.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Perhaps the best way to check Scyther is by keeping Stealth Rock on the field, as Scyther takes 50% from it any time that it comes in, which can really limit when Scyther can switch into the battle.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Defensive Rock-types can switch into Scyther pretty freely. Rhyperior and defensive Diancie are both excellent switch-ins to Scyther because they basically take nothing from most of its moves, but they have to be wary of coverage moves. Aerodactyl and Trick Room Diancie can also do a really good job, being able to offensively check Scyther by outspeeding and OHKOing it with their Rock-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types make great Scyther switch-ins. Registeel and Steelix can switch into basically any move, but they have to be wary of being worn down too much by Choice Band-boosted U-turn and giving up momentum to wallbreakers, and Registeel has to be wary of Brick Break.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon</strong>: Jolteon is a solid Scyther check because it can outspeed Scyther and KO it with its STAB Electric-type attacks, but it has to be wary of switching into U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Sneasel in particular can outspeed Scyther and OHKO it with STAB Icicle Crash while Mega Glalie, which is really threatening can OHKO Scyther with STAB Ice Shard if Scyther has already taken Stealth Rock damage. Mega Glalie is also bulky enough to tank an Aerial Ace late-game if it has to and can fire back a Refrigerate-boosted STAB move to destroy Scyther.</p> <p><strong>Fast Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that can outspeed or outprioritize Scyther and are strong enough to really threaten it can check Scyther on offensive teams. Examples of these include Choice Scarf Thunder Punch Medicham, Fletchinder, and Virizion with Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Garbodor</strong>: Rocky Helmet Garbodor can also be a really strong check to Scyther because it resists U-turn, can cause Scyther to take chip damage every that it comes in or attacks Garbodor with a contact move, is able to tank an Aerial Ace and can threaten Scyther with STAB Gunk Shot.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn lets Scyther gain momentum for your team by getting switch initiative against defensive checks like Registeel. Aerial Ace is Scyther's strongest STAB move and can make it a nice late-game wincon that can clean up the game when your opponent's Flying-type checks are weakened, and it can threaten a lot of important Grass-type threats such as Venusaur. Knock Off can really hurt defensive Pokemon that appreciate recovery such as Alomomola while also hitting defensive Ghost-types that attempt to switch into Scyther's Bug-type attacks. Knock Off can also generally smack Psychic-types like Delphox really hard in situations where Scyther does not want to switch out of the battle. Lastly, Pursuit is very useful for trapping frailer offensive Pokemon like Hoopa that threaten the rest of your team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in Attack and Speed maximize Scyther's offensive abilities. A Jolly nature lets Scyther outspeed positive-natured Flygon, Glalie, and Delphox, as well as neutral-natured Manectric and other Scyther. An Adamant nature might be considered for additional hole punching ability, but the ability to outspeed Delphox and Flygon in particular is very valuable. Choice Band gives Scyther a significant boost in power and lets it do a much better job at wearing away at Pokemon as it uses U-turn. Lastly, Technician is easily the only ability that should be used here because it boosts the power of both Aerial Ace and Pursuit to noticeably higher levels than normal and can help net crucial KOs on offensive Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When there are no entry hazards on the field, you will probably be clicking U-turn most of the time in the early-game and mid-game, as it gains offensive momentum and can really get the drop on your opponent. However, you can also click Knock Off during the early-game when against a defensive team with a check that really appreciates Leftovers recovery like Wish + Protect Alomomola or when a Ghost-type like Cofagrigus is going to come in to try and take a Bug-type attack. Scyther can clean during the late-game with Aerial Ace, but you can use it at any point of the game if it's going to take a chunk out of the foe and if it does significantly more damage than U-turn. Make sure not to send Scyther into Stealth Rock when it is up unless it's a late-game situation that requires you to if you wish to win the game or if you desperately need to revenge kill a foe like Malamar and no other Pokemon on your team can kill it. Pursuit should frankly only be used against frail offensive Pokemon that are going KOed by U-turn, as they might otherwise stay in and eliminate Scyther. Lastly, because of its mediocre bulk, if you can't get Scyther in with a Volt Switch or U-turn, only attempt bring in Scyther either against Grass-types that lack coverage options or strong secondary STAB moves or Fighting-types that are only going to be using Fighting-type moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Scyther tends to work best on offensive VoltTurn teams, since it can get many opportunities to switch in, and it has good type synergy with Electric-types, being immune to Ground-type attacks. However, the ability to check Psychic-, Fighting-, and Grass-types while also being able to Pursuit trap key threats is really valuable and is good enough for Scyther to be featured on balanced teams as well. Magneton is an excellent teammate and is probably the best Volt Switch user to pair with Scyther; its common Choice Specs set can do a really good job breaking down Steel- and Rock-types that normally wall Scyther as well as having solid offensive and defensive synergy with Scyther by resisting Ice-, Electric-, and Rock-type attacks, while Scyther can handle Fighting- and Ground-type attacks. Venusaur is also a solid teammate because it can help check Virizion, which Scyther doesn't really want to stay in on because it usually has coverage for Scyther. Venusaur also eliminates common checks for Scyther in Diancie, Rhyperior, and Alomomola. Entry hazard removers in general are mandatory teammates, since they can remove Stealth Rock, giving Scyther more chances to come in without having to worry about losing half of its health. Flygon, Blastoise, Xatu, and Hitmonlee in particular can be used with Scyther depending on the team you build. However, Sneasel can quickly become a threat to the team if Scyther is paired with Venusaur, Flygon, or Xatu, so you should make sure that you include a solid Sneasel switch-in. Stealth Rock setters are nice to wear down the opposing team, especially with all the switches that U-turn forces. A Stealth Rock user that pairs really well with Scyther is Rhyperior because it can do a good job of checking Fire-, Ice-, Steel-, and Flying-types decently well for Scyther and has the potential to run other sets in tandem with Scyther due to its versatility of running a possible Choice Band set. If you are using a VoltTurn team, Uxie is another really good Stealth Rock user because it has U-turn to keep up momentum and is a reliable Medicham check so that Scyther doesn't have to worry about Choice Scarf Medicham revenge killing it. If you want to run a Spikes Stacking team, Mega Glalie is an excellent option to use as a Spikes user because most of Scyther's checks are grounded, so they will be worn down very quickly by the Spikes. Offensive Fighting- and Ground-types also make excellent partners, as they can do an excellent job breaking down the Steel- and Rock-types that are commonly used as switch-ins to Scyther. Two Pokemon in particular that love Scyther's U-turn support and can break down Rock- and Steel-types include Choice Band Rhyperior and Life Orb Medicham. One offensive Fire-type in particular that works well with Scyther is actually Mega Camerupt, as it limits the spamming of Electric-, Fire-, and Rock-type attacks against Scyther just by sitting in the back and threatening to take out a Pokemon with its insane power along with being a situational check to Flying- and Ice-types.</p>"

  "Ditto": {
    "overview": "<p>Ditto can automatically transform into the opposing Pokemon upon switching in, copying their moves, nature, EVs, and any stat boosts. However, Ditto does not copy their HP, meaning that it has to live with a horrible base 48 HP. Ditto also can't transform into Pokemon behind Substitutes. However, the main draw of using Ditto is that it can transform into an opposing sweeper and take their boosts to turn the situation against the opponent, a strategy that appreciates Choice Scarf, which can make sure that Ditto outspeeds its foe. Ditto still loses to most Calm Mind or Bulk Up sweepers, as they can beat Ditto one on one with their higher HP stat. Ditto is almost completely useless against stall teams besides sometimes using utility moves such as Defog or Heal Bell. Another problem Ditto faces is that the moves it copies only have 5 PP, meaning it can be PP stalled, especially as it almost always holds a Choice Scarf.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Focus Sash gives Ditto the option of counter sweeping while also being able to switch moves, but it requires entry hazard removal as a result and can stll potentially lose to priority users. Other Hidden Power types can also be used, such as Hidden Power Fire for Escavalier, Hidden Power Ground for Magneton and Jolteon, and Hidden Power Flying for Virizion.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Jellicent and Aromatisse won't mind their own attacks much and can easily stall Ditto out of its 5 PP with their recovery moves.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Bulky setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Meloetta, Virizion, and Curse Registeel can tank Ditto's attacks thanks to their boosted defenses, and then hit Ditto back hard by virtue of its base 48 HP and inability to change moves while holding Choice Scarf.</p> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Ditto cannot transform into Pokemon behind a Substitute, so as long as the opposing Pokemon is behind a Substitute, Ditto is rendered useless.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Imposter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Transform is literally the only move Ditto learns, but it is also useless because Imposter does everything it does except automatically, making it just filler.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs give Ditto an entry hazard damage number, and investing in HP is important, as HP is the only stat Ditto keeps when it transforms. 252 Defense EVs and a Relaxed nature make sure that Ditto will underspeed other Dittos in a stall war and take less damage from their Struggle. Choice Scarf allows Ditto to outspeed non-Choice Scarf opponents after transforming into them. Ditto's IVs can be tweaked for certain Hidden Powers, such as 30 Defense IVs, 30 Special Defense IVs, and 1 Speed IV for Hidden Power Rock to hit Scyther and Fletchinder, or 30 Defense IVs, 30 Special Attack IVs, and 1 Speed IV for Hidden Power Grass to hit Seismitoad, Quagsire, and Rhyperior.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Never send in Ditto against a Pokemon behind a Substitute unless you are using it as fodder because it cannot do anything back. Be cautious of switching Ditto into Pokemon that can potentially hit hard, either because of a super-effective move in the case of transforming into Druddigon or having high offenses versus low defenses in Aerodactyls's case. Use Ditto to revenge kill dangerous set up sweepers, although Ditto's presence can act as a deterrent from attempts at setting up. Ditto should not be used to revenge kill bulky sweepers such as Calm Mind Spiritomb or Meloetta because defensive boosts mean that Ditto will lose, as it only has base 48 HP. Ditto can have some utility against more defensive teams by coming in and setting or removing entry hazards or by acting as a cleric. Remember that Ditto can be used to scout opposing movesets on more versatile Pokemon, although Ditto should not be switching in purely to scout for moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ditto is best used as a glue and it can work on many teams, but is best used with offensive teammates that also have problems with set up sweepers. Ditto appreciates entry hazard removal to increase its longevity, as it is susceptible to all entry hazards, and it also appreciates the setting of entry hazards to help it if it ever attempts to counter sweep. Partners that can annoy Substitute sweepers, such as Golbat or Exploud, are good partners as Ditto cannot get past Substitute alone. Partners such as Emboar and Exploud work well with Ditto because they can wallbreak against stall, an archetype Ditto is not very useful against.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With a blistering base 130 Speed, Jolteon outspeeds the entire unboosted RU metagame, barring Accelgor. In combination with its respectable base 110 Special Attack, this makes Jolteon a great choice for any team desiring a late-game cleaner and revenge killer. Volt Absorb allows Jolteon to block Volt Switch, making it a great tool to kill off opposing momentum. On the downside, base 110 Special Attack is good but not great, so dedicated special walls give Jolteon a hard time. It is also extremely frail both physically and specially, making it vulnerable to revenge killing from priority attackers and Choice Scarf users. Nonetheless, Jolteon's offensive versatility means it is worthy of a spot on nearly any offensive or balanced team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shadow Ball can be used to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types hard, though Jolteon typically prefers its other coverage moves. Heal Bell can work on the offensive set to help Jolteon clear its team of status ailments if need be. Rain Dance allows Jolteon to function as an offensive supporter; Jolteon can also take advantage of rain itself by using Thunder and Hidden Power Water. Roar allows Jolteon to phaze special walls that try to heal themselves with Wish.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to Jolteon's frailty and vulnerability to being worn down, priority attackers such as Fletchinder and Hitmonlee as well as Choice Scarf users such as Delphox and Mesprit can pick it off easily.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Dedicated special tanks such as Registeel, Uxie, Meloetta, Druddigon, and Escavalier take pitiful damage from most of Jolteon's attacks, easily forcing it to exit the battlefield. Fortunately, Jolteon can still use Volt Switch to maintain momentum against opposing walls.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: If running Life Orb, Jolteon is vulnerable to being worn down rapidly. Even without Life Orb, repeated switching into Stealth Rock and Spikes, as well as burn and poison damage, will quickly take its toll on Jolteon.</p>",

      "Offensive Wish": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute sets up a shield for Jolteon against weak attacks and status moves. Thunderbolt prevents Jolteon from being Taunt bait; the move is also used to scare out Water- and Flying-types such as Alomomola and Fletchinder. It's also a good move for sweeping in general thanks to Jolteon's decent Special Attack and blazing Speed. Wish further cements Jolteon's role as an offensive supporter by restoring a teammate's health. The move can also be used to heal off Substitute damage.  Hidden Power Ice nails Flygon and Grass-types, both of which are common switch-ins to Jolteon, while Hidden Power Grass lets Jolteon do something against Rhyperior, Seismitoad, Gastrodon, and Lanturn. Heal Bell is another option for Jolteon to further support its team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>80 HP EVs are just enough to avoid the OHKO from +2 Fletchinder's Acrobatics after Stealth Rock and Adamant Drapion's Knock Off. The remaining 176 EVs go into Special Attack to maximize the power of Jolteon's attacks. Volt Absorb lets Jolteon switch into stray Electric-type attacks and block Volt Switch. Leftovers gives Jolteon passive recovery, making it less reliant on Wish and allowing it to set up Substitute several times in the battle if it needs to.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should be used on offensive teams as an early- and mid-game momentum grabber. Bring Jolteon in against Pokemon that it forces out, and then set up Substitute on the predicted switch. However, don't switch Jolteon directly into the foe; its frailty along with Substitute damage will cause it to be worn down quickly. Jolteon is the only offensive Wish passer in the entire metagame, allowing it to maintain momentum for the team. After setting up a Substitute, pick off the opposing wall with Thunderbolt or use Wish to heal an offensive teammate that has been worn down. Alternatively, simply use Wish instead of Substitute as the foe switches should the situation call for it. If running Hidden Power Grass, use it to hit Rhyperior on the switch so that Jolteon does not get phazed, and if running Hidden Power Ice, be sure to utilize its ability to surprise Flygon on the switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>You need teammates that Jolteon can support and that have good synergy with Jolteon. Mega Glalie enjoys Jolteon's Wish support to heal off Stealth Rock damage and takes on the Ground- and Grass-types that Jolteon struggles against. Other physical attackers that can break down Grass-types include Druddigon, Escavalier, Emboar, and Fletchinder. Grass-types such as Virizion and Rotom-C can smash Seismitoad, Rhyperior, and Gastrodon should Jolteon lack Hidden Power Grass.</p>"
      },
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt is Jolteon's reliable STAB attack, dealing massive damage to Pokemon such as Qwilfish, Fletchinder, and Alomomola. Signal Beam allows Jolteon to take on the Grass-types that resist Thunderbolt, such as Rotom-C; it also sees use against Malamar. Hidden Power Ice hits Flygon and Virizion super effectively, all of which are common switch-ins to Jolteon. Hidden Power Grass can be used instead to hit Gastrodon, Quagsire, Seismitoad, and Rhyperior. Volt Switch allows Jolteon to bail out of a bad matchup and maintain momentum for your team. Charge Beam can be used instead to discourage opponents from sacrificing their Pokemon to Jolteon. Hidden Power Water is also an option to hit Ground-types hard, particularly Rhyperior and Mega Camerupt.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment allows Jolteon to hit as hard and as quickly as possible. A Timid nature is necessary to Speed tie with opposing Jolteon so that your own Jolteon can finish off a weakened one. Volt Absorb lets Jolteon switch into stray Electric-type attacks and block Volt Switch. Life Orb increases Jolteon's damage output without forcing it to change moves, though Choice Specs can be used if Life Orb's recoil damage is unappealing. However, because specially defensive Pokemon give Jolteon a hard time, locking it into a single move can be detrimental.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Jolteon should only enter the battlefield on a free switch or a predicted Electric-type attack, particularly a Choice-locked one from the likes of Rotom-C and Magneton. With Life Orb, this set is best used as a mid-game revenge killer and a late-game cleaner. With Choice Specs, however, this set fulfills the role of a powerful early- and mid-game wallbreaker. If the opponent has a Pokemon that is immune to Electric, be sure to take it out early on in the match so that Jolteon can freely spam Volt Switch. When revenge killing a foe, try to KO it with Volt Switch in order to maintain momentum. If the opponent switches Pokemon, use Volt Switch to bring in a response to the opponent's Jolteon check. You can also attempt to hit the switch-in with the appropriate coverage move, which is especially important when trying to surprise Flygon with Hidden Power Ice.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Jolteon pairs well with VoltTurn staples such as Rotom-C, Meloetta, Braviary, and Eelektross, as it is adept at wearing down foes and maintaining momentum for your team. Dedicated wallbreakers such as Mega Glalie can break down bulky Pokemon, paving the way for Jolteon to switch in and clean up. Hitmonlee can also break special walls and provide Rapid Spin support, preventing Jolteon from being worn down as easily. Fire-types such as Houndoom, Mega Camerupt, and Emboar appreciate Jolteon's ability to smash Water-types, particularly Alomomola. Fire-types can also destroy Bug-neutral Grass-types such as Virizion and Venusaur; however, Houndoom loses to Virizion. Entry hazard support is necessary to inflict passive damage on opposing walls, giving Jolteon an easier time cleaning them up. Druddigon is a great Stealth Rock setter because it can take on the Steel- and Grass-types that wall Jolteon, while Jolteon beats the physical walls that Druddigon cannot break.</p>"

  "Omastar": {
    "overview": "<p>Omastar finds its place on most teams as a deadly late-game cleaner thanks to its great base 115 Special Attack and access to Shell Smash, one of the best boosting moves in the game. Its solid base 75 / 125 physical bulk combined with its Rock / Water typing gives it a decent number of setup opportunities against Pokemon such as Fletchinder, Drapion, and Choice-locked Emboar. Sadly, its below-average special bulk and low Speed prior to using Shell Smash mean it can get KOed by decently strong special attacks before it manages to get a boost up. Its typing also gives it uncomfortable weaknesses to Fighting- and Electric-type moves on top of a 4x weakness to Grass-type ones. This is further worsened by the presence of Pokemon such as Venusaur and Virizion, which are bulky enough to tank an unboosted Ice Beam from Omastar and can OHKO it with their Grass-type STAB moves. Omastar's access to both Stealth Rock and Spikes makes it a decent suicide lead, although it struggles heavily against Blastoise, the tier's most popular spinner.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thanks to Swift Swim and its high base 115 Special Attack, Omastar functions very well as a Choice Specs wallbreaker for rain teams. A physically defensive set with Stealth Rock, Spikes, Scald, and Ice Beam could be opted for, but Omastar lacks reliable recovery and has too many common weaknesses in Fighting, Electric, and, most importantly, Grass. Earth Power guarantees the 2HKO on Registeel after Stealth Rock, but Hidden Power Grass is the preferred coverage option, as it covers more targets. Ancient Power could be used if a Rock-type STAB move is desired, although Ice Beam and Hidden Power Grass provide better overall coverage. A Modest nature could be used on the Shell Smash set for further power, although Omastar then fails to outspeed base 80 Speed Choice Scarf users such as Medicham. Chople Berry can let Omastar survive a Fighting-type priority move once it's weakened, although it still takes too much damage from other Fighting-type attacks, such as Medicham's and Hitmonlee's High Jump Kick. Toxic Spikes can be opted for on the lead set although Venusaur's popularity makes it less appealing, aside from the fact Omastar would have to forgo a coverage move in order to have all three entry hazards.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: While they can't directly switch into the Shell Smash set, Meloetta and Registeel can survive a +2 Hydro Pump from Omastar and OHKO it with a powerful Psychic-type STAB move or cripple it with Thunder Wave, respectively. Assault Vest users such as Hariyama also tank Omastar's boosted attacks from full health and OHKO it with STAB attacks of its own.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Due to Omastar's low base 55 Speed, faster attackers such as Venusaur, Meloetta, and Jolteon can KO it with their STAB attacks. Choice Scarf Delphox, Flygon, and Drapion all manage to outspeed Omastar even after a Shell Smash boost and can heavily damage it with their strong STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Although they have to watch out for +2 Hidden Power Grass, bulky Water-types such as Slowking and Jellicent can sponge Omastar's other attacks and heavily damage it with Scald. Blastoise stops the suicide lead set cold, as it resists all of Omastar's attacks and can get rid of hazards with Rapid Spin.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Strong priority attacks such as Hitmonlee's Mach Punch and Absol's Sucker Punch can pick off Omastar after a Shell Smash boost, although Omastar can manage to survive them if it's healthy enough.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash boosts Omastar's Special Attack and Speed by two stages, making it a fearsome sweeper. Hydro Pump is Omastar's main STAB move and hits incredibly hard after a boost. Surf can be used over Hydro Pump if the latter's imperfect accuracy is concerning, although it misses out on a few benchmarks such as a chance to OHKO Meloetta and 2HKO Registeel after Stealth Rock. Ice Beam allows Omastar to hit Grass-types such as Virizion, Venusaur, and Rotom-C super effectively, which would otherwise switch into Hydro Pump comfortably. Hidden Power Grass hits the plethora of bulky Water-types in RU such as Alomomola, Slowking, and Jellicent, which completely tank Omastar's other moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature with maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs ensures Omastar is as fast and strong as possible while allowing it to outspeed base 80 Speed Choice Scarf users after a boost. Shuca Berry lets Omastar survive Rhyperior and Flygon's Earthquake after a Defense drop, giving it an opportunity to set up Shell Smash or OHKO them with the respective coverage move. Alternatively, Life Orb increases Omastar's overall damage output, making it much more offensively threatening, although it compromises its longevity. Focus Sash gives Omastar a chance to set up against any one hit that would OHKO it, although it makes it much easier to be picked off by priority attacks. Lum Berry can be used in order to let Omastar set up on Pokemon such as Registeel, Alomomola, and Uxie, which would otherwise cripple it with status ailments.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is best used as a late-game cleaner, once Omastar's checks and faster attackers have been weakened or KOed. Take advantage of its typing by setting up on attacks such as Fletchinder's Acrobatics and Choice-locked Emboar's Flare Blitz. Be wary of Choice Scarf users faster than +2 Omastar such as Delphox and Flygon and strong priority users such as Hitmonlee and Absol before setting up. Omastar should be brought in on predicted resisted attacks, via pivoting moves such as U-turn and Volt Switch, or after a teammate has been KOed so as to keep it from being worn down too much.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support lets Omastar achieve useful KOs, such as on Meloetta and Uxie after Stealth Rock and a bit of prior damage, which would otherwise KO Omastar or cripple it with Thunder Wave, respectively. Options include Stealth Rock from Registeel and Uxie and Spikes from Garbodor and Glalie, the last of which can wear down Water-types with Freeze-Dry. Other Pokemon that can deal with bulky Water-types such as Venusaur and Virizion are greatly appreciated too. Fire- and Flying-types such as Emboar and Braviary can take down Grass-types for Omastar. Wallbreakers such as Exploud and Hitmonlee, which can further wear down special walls, are valuable teammates as well. Barbaracle can be used alongside Omastar, as they both weaken each other's checks. U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Flygon, Scyther, Magneton, and Jolteon can give Omastar an easier time coming in to set up.</p>"
      },
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock damages the opponent's Pokemon as they switch in. Spikes further damages grounded Pokemon regardless of typing, which can be useful for offensive teams, as it makes late-game cleaning easier. Scald is a useful STAB move due to its 30% burn chance, which can cripple physical attackers for later in the match. Ice Beam serves as coverage for Grass-types and OHKOes the tier's most popular Defog user, Flygon. Icy Wind, although weaker than Ice Beam, allows Omastar to slow down certain key targets such as Venusaur and Virizion and outspeed them after a Weak Armor boost, and it also provides support for slower wallbreakers such as Exploud. Shell Smash and Earth Power instead of Stealth Rock and Ice Beam can also be an option to dissuade Blastoise, which would otherwise easily spin on Omastar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>As this Omastar set is a suicide lead, a Timid nature is used and EVs are invested in Speed and Special Attack in order to get the most opportunities to set up entry hazards while dealing as much damage as possible. Weak Armor boosts Omastar's Speed after being hit by a contact move. Focus Sash allows Omastar to set up at least one layer of entry hazards unless it gets hit by Taunt.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is usually best to lead with Omastar to ensure its Focus Sash remains intact. However, if there is a Pokemon that can easily clear the entry hazards Omastar sets up, Omastar can be saved for later in the match. Weak Armor should be taken advantage of when Omastar leads or can switch into weak physical moves, thereby letting it force out certain would-be faster threats with the Speed boost.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set best fits on hyper offensive teams, which don't mind losing a teammate early-game. Most offensive Pokemon appreciate the entry hazard support Omastar provides, especially Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Magneton, Flygon, and Scyther and late-game cleaners such as Virizion, Delphox, and Jolteon. Spinblockers such as Hoopa, Rotom, and Choice Band Trevenant are great partners to have, as Blastoise easily spins against Omastar. Grass-types that can directly pressure Blastoise such as Venusaur and Virizion are also useful. Pokemon that dissuade Flygon from using Defog such as Glalie and Defiant Braviary are valuable teammates as well.</p>"

  "Kabutops": {
    "overview": "<p>With good offensive stats and access to Rapid Spin, Kabutops makes its place in RU as not only an entry hazard remover but also an offensive threat that resists certain types that most spinners do not, such as Fire and Flying. When it's not removing entry hazards, Kabutops can hit the majority of the tier very hard with its strong STAB moves. Unfortunately, Kabutops has a very lackluster base 80 Speed outside of rain but it does make up for it with access to a priority STAB move in Aqua Jet. Even then, however, it faces stiff competition from the likes of Hitmonlee and Flygon. Kabutops also has rather low Special Defense, so it's relatively hard to pivot it into Fire-types such as Delphox and Houndoom.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swords Dance could be used to boost Kabutops's Attack to massive levels and improve its wallbreaking ability. You could use Lum Berry over Life Orb, as any kind of status ailment completely cripples Kabutops. Rock Slide can be used in place of Stone Edge, but the significant power decrease means that Kabutops may miss out on some 2HKOs or OHKOs that Stone Edge usually gets. You could use the combination of Natural Gift and Liechi Berry to give Kabutops a 100-Base Power Grass-type move to surprise Pokemon such as Seismitoad and Gastrodon, which Kabutops often lures in. An Assault Vest could be used to boost its special bulk a bit and let it check Pokemon such as Houndoom and Meloetta.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Virizion and Rotom-C can come in and either force Kabutops out or KO it. Gourgeist-Super and Trevenant can come in and block Rapid Spin but are threatened by Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Jellicent, Trevenant, and Gourgeist-Super can prevent Kabutops from spinning at all, but they are threatened by Stone Edge and Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Hitmonlee and Virizion can come in against Kabutops and KO it with Close Combat. Hitmontop and Gurdurr can also threaten Kabutops with their bulk and priority in Mach Punch.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Alomomola and Quagsire, with reliable recovery in Wish and Recover, respectively, can take any attack Kabutops uses and then cripple it with a burn or Toxic. Other Pokemon such as Weezing and Uxie can take a hit from Kabutops and cripple it with a status move such as Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave unless it runs Lum Berry.</p> <p><strong>Seismitoad and Gastrodon</strong>: These two can easily come in on Kabutops's STAB moves, as they absorb Water-type moves and resist Stone Edge, and they can easily KO it with an Earthquake or Earth Power. Scald can also burn variants that lack Lum Berry.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin provides great team support for Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock. Stone Edge is a very strong STAB move that hits Grass-, Flying-, and Ice-types very hard. Waterfall is Kabutops's other strong STAB move, and it hits bulky Ground- and Fighting-types such as Rhyperior and Hitmontop. Superpower enables Kabutops to prevent Pokemon such as Scrafty from setting up and to hit Steel-types very hard on the switch; it can also catch Virizion or Seismitoad off-guard for some nice damage. Aqua Jet can be used to hit fast Fire-types such Delphox and Houndoom. Knock Off could also be utilized as a more accurate way to threaten Ghost-types than Stone Edge and also to remove items from bulky Pokemon that switch into Kabutops, such as Alomomola.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This set focuses on Kabutops's offensive prowess as well as its ability to support the team with Rapid Spin. A Jolly nature and maximum Speed investment help it outspeed as many Pokemon as possible, such as Adamant Hitmonlee and Modest Meloetta, and also gives it more chances to spin to help teammates weak to entry hazards. An Adamant nature can be used to give it a significant boost in power but hinders its Speed, which means it would be able to spin against fewer Pokemon. Weak Armor is preferred over Swift Swim unless Kabutops is used on a dedicated rain team. The ability allows it to tank a hit with its decent Defense from the likes of Sneasel and Mega Glalie and outspeed them the turn after. Life Orb gives a boost to all of Kabutops's moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kabutops is best used on a team that needs entry hazard removal as well as a Pokemon that resists Fire- and Flying-type moves. It's best to use Kabutops early- and mid-game to pressure the opponent's walls with very strong STAB moves and to remove any entry hazards. It is extremely important to spin hazards away for teammates that would otherwise be crippled by them. If running Aqua Jet, Kabutops can revenge kill Fire-types such as Delphox and Houndoom with ease.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Any Pokemon that appreciate entry hazards being removed, such as the Ice- and Fire-types in the tier, pair well with Kabutops. These Ice- and Fire-types, such as Mega Glalie, Delphox, and Fletchinder, can remove the bulky Grass-types that Kabutops has trouble with in return. Grass-types, such as Virizion and Rotom-C, make for good teammates, as they have great defensive synergy with Kabutops, covering its Electric, Grass, and Ground weaknesses. Any Thunder Wave user can help Kabutops outspeed foes and use Rapid Spin on them or KO them later in the game. Other entry hazard setters, such as Accelgor or any Sticky Web user, synergize well with Kabutops, as Rapid Spin doesn't remove their entry hazards, unlike Defog. If Kabutops is running Swift Swim, other Swift Swim users could be paired with it, such as Ludicolo and Seismitoad, to form an offensive rain core.</p>"

  "Aerodactyl": {
    "overview": "<p>Aerodactyl's fantastic Speed tier allows it to outpace almost the entire metagame including Virizion and Sneasel, as well as Choice Scarf Hoopa and Emboar, making it a stellar revenge killer and late-game cleaner. It is only outsped by Accelgor and Choice Scarf users with a base Speed over 70 like Medicham. Its decent Attack stat coupled with a colorful offensive movepool and utility options like Stealth Rock allows it to mix up its moveset quite a bit. It is also the fastest viable Pursuit user in the tier, and its Rock typing allows it to check Fletchinder that try to switch out. Unfortunately, Aerodactyl has very mediocre bulk that prevents it from taking even neutral hits well. It is also weak to common offensive types like Rock, Steel, and Ice. Aerodactyl struggles against many physically defensive Pokemon, either due to their defensive typing resisting Aerodactyl's Rock STAB moves or because they can heal off the damage faster than Aerodactyl can deal it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hone Claws can make Aerodactyl a threatening sweeper, but its bulk doesn't allow it to set up reliably. Ice Fang lets Aerodactyl do more damage to Flygon, which takes Stone Edge really well and can Roost off the damage. A lead set looks appealing at first glance, but the extra Speed in the end is not worth it when compared to Archeops, which has Endeavor and Head Smash to play a more effective role as a suicide lead. Aqua Tail can be used over Earthquake in order to hit Rhyperior harder but has imperfect accuracy. Tailwind and Defog are options that Aerodactyl can use before fainting in order to support its teammates. Double-Edge + Rock Head gives Aerodactyl good neutral coverage that can damage Flygon and Seismitoad as well Fighting-types in one moveslot. Toxic can cripple walls that aren't Steel-types on the switch. Taunt can be used in tandem with Roost to take advantage of passive Pokemon like Weezing and Registeel.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Aerodactyl can get chip damage on bulky Steel-types through Earthquake, but due to their large amount of bulk and super effective STAB moves, Aerodactyl will more than likely lose the matchup. Bronzong also has Levitate, meaning it is immune to Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types like Flygon and Seismitoad only fear Aerodactyl's more uncommon coverage moves and resist its hardest-hitting move, Stone Edge. They also tend to carry coverage that is strong enough to OHKO Aerodactyl.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Slowking and Alomomola can shrug off most of Aerodactyl's attacks with ease. Some also have recovery and can stall out Stone Edge's PP, leaving Aerodactyl unable to use its most prized STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users and Priority</strong>: Aerodactyl's less than optimal bulk means that it can get KOed quite easily by faster Pokemon whether it would be through Sucker Punch or Ice Shard or because of a Pokemon wielding a Choice Scarf like Hitmonlee.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stone Edge is Aerodactyl's strongest STAB move, which is especially good at hitting Fire- and Ice-types like Houndoom and Abomasnow. Earthquake gives Aerodactyl a way to hit Steel- and Rock-types like Registeel and Diancie while also providing a more accurate attack against Fire-types. Pursuit lets it trap Psychic-types like Sigilyph and Hoopa as well as Fletchinder, which don't want to stay in on Aerodactyl. Aerial Ace lets Aerodactyl OHKO Virizion and Hitmonlee as well as deal a large amount of damage to other bulkier Pokemon that are weak to the move, such as Gurdurr. Roost gives Aerodactyl a way to recover HP after it has lost some from weaker hits, Stealth Rock, and Life Orb recoil.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and a Jolly nature let Aerodactyl outpace the majority of the metagame, including prominent threats such as Virizion, Sneasel, Choice Scarf Hoopa, and Choice Scarf Emboar as well as be able to Speed tie with Jolteon. Maximum Attack and Life Orb increase Aerodactyl's damage output. Unnerve lets Aerodactyl ignore damage-reduction Berries like Colbur Berry for Pursuit and Charti Berry for Stone Edge, the former being very common for escaping Aerodactyl's Pursuits.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Aerodactyl is very frail and thus doesn't like coming in on attacks. Try to bring it in after a teammate has fainted or through a slow Volt Switch or U-turn. Aerodactyl can also try to come in on a Ground-type attack like Earthquake, but this should only be done if Aerodactyl can KO the Pokemon back. Be wary of priority users, as Aerodactyl can get chipped down pretty easily, and its opportunities to use Roost are very rare. Aerodactyl should be using Roost on a predicted switch, usually when Aerodactyl is threatening a Pokemon with a move that will OHKO it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Aerodactyl appreciates hazard control because it doesn't want to come in on Stealth Rock repeatedly, so partners like Blastoise and Flygon can work well with it. Aerodactyl helps out against Fire- and Fighting-types, and Steel-types like Registeel and Mawile appreciate having those removed so they can come in safely. Magneton helps to remove Registeel and Bronzong, two Pokemon that don't mind taking Aerodactyl's STAB moves. It helps against bulky Water-types as well, which are also capable of taking Aerodactyl's moves. Aerodactyl has a hard time against bulky Ground-types, so Grass-types like Venusaur, which can deal with Seismitoad and Rhyperior, couple well with it. While Aerodactyl can get repeated chip damage on Steel-types via Earthquake, it makes it a lot easier to just have partners to deal with the likes of Steelix and Bronzong, such as Fire-types like Houndoom and Delphox. Fighting-types such as Sawk and Medicham help to remove some of Aerodactyl's checks like Rhyperior and Registeel. Aerodactyl in return provides an offensive check to Fletchinder, which threatens common Fighting-types.</p>"

Despite having a great offensive typing in Ice / Flying, Articuno's highest stats are Special Defense and Defense. However, Articuno is able to use this effectively in RU thanks to the tier's lack of solid specially bulky Pokemon capable of resisting its STAB types. Freeze-Dry is the biggest tool in Articuno's arsenal, as this unique Ice-type move allows Articuno to significantly pressure the likes of Alomomola and Slowking. Articuno's solid Speed is great in a tier where most wallbreakers hang around the base 70 and base 80 range, and Articuno happens to perform well against all of them thanks to its good offensive typing and raw bulk. Access to reliable recovery in Roost only helps to ensure Articuno can take repeated powerful neutral attacks. It also has access to nice support options in Heal Bell and Haze, which are not that common in RU, and Articuno has the bulk to pull off such a set. Articuno's most glaring issue is a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock in a tier with plenty of reliable users and limited options for entry hazard removal. As good as Articuno's typing is offensively, it's about as bad defensively with only one resistance or immunity Articuno can reliably take advantage of in Grass. Its vulnerability to Steel-types, such as Registeel, Magneton, and Escavalier, only makes it harder to use, as these are very good and common Pokemon in the tier. Articuno can be a very good Pokemon, but it must be supported very well to get the most out of it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ground can be used on the offensive set to OHKO Magneton, while Hidden Power Fire OHKOes most variants of Escavalier and 2HKOes Magneton. However, neither does much to Registeel due to its high special bulk. Agility can turn the offensive set into a late-game sweeper, but Articuno would lose a fair bit of its mid-game utility, as such a set would need to use a Modest nature in order to have the necessary power to reliably sweep. Tailwind is another option on the offensive set to allow Articuno to give its team a temporary Speed boost when it's about to go down. U-turn can be useful if Articuno has trapping support from Pokemon such as Spiritomb alongside it. However, do note that Articuno generally doesn't have the room to run these moves due to the need of Ice Beam or Substitute on the offensive set. Roar can be used on the defensive set to shuffle through the opposing team, but this will often lead to unfavorable matchups due to Articuno's suspect defensive typing. Choice Specs and Choice Scarf can give Articuno a boost in power or Speed, but both make Articuno suffer from its 4x Stealth Rock weakness even more as well as other distinct issues; Choice Specs keeps Articuno from switching moves, while Choice Scarf sorely misses the power boost from Life Orb.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Articuno is 4x weak to Stealth Rock, and thus it has much of its raw bulk stripped away if it has to switch in with the hazard up. Registeel and Bronzong are by far the best setters against most Articuno sets, since they can beat Articuno one-on-one and set Stealth Rock. Be careful, though. Setters that Articuno can easily switch into on the Stealth Rock turn, such as Seismitoad and Mesprit, aren't as reliable to punish Articuno.</p> <p><strong>Diancie</strong>: While it can be worn down some due to a lack of reliable recovery, Diancie's Rock typing lets it resist Hurricane, and it isn't weak to Ice-type moves like most other Rock-types. It can then OHKO Articuno with a STAB Diamond Storm or set up Stealth Rock as Articuno switches out.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Jolteon, Houndoom, Choice Scarf Emboar, and Aerodactyl all resist one of Articuno's STAB types and are able to outspeed Articuno and OHKO it with their powerful STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Escavalier, Eelektross, and Meloetta can take a hit or two and retaliate with heavy damage or an OHKO to Articuno. However, Meloetta can struggle to get past the specially defensive set.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Although Articuno is not weak to the move, it relies heavily on Life Orb for its damage output. Without Life Orb, Articuno is no longer capable of pushing past Slowking and specially defensive Alomomola reliably with Freeze-Dry. Venusaur is a great choice to lure in Articuno with, since the bird will sometimes be switched into Venusaur in an attempt to maintain offensive momentum for its team. Alomomola is another good option to simply put Knock Off on without losing much functionality. The specially defensive set is not hurt nearly as much by Knock Off, but like with any other defensive Pokemon, it is pressured much more easily without Leftovers recovery.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set makes use of Articuno's unique qualities as an offensive Pokemon in RU, namely its Speed tier and access to STAB Freeze-Dry. Freeze-Dry is the main STAB move and it allows Articuno to 2HKO Alomomola, Blastoise, and Slowking while also OHKOing Seismitoad. Hurricane is Articuno's best Flying-type STAB move, and it is able to deal with the likes of Hitmonlee, Sawk, and non-Choice Scarf Medicham with ease. Roost gives Articuno reliable recovery in order to mitigate Life Orb recoil and damage from resisted attacks it comes in on. Ice Beam is the primary option in the last slot to give Articuno a reliable STAB move to use when there isn't a Water-type present on the opposing team. Substitute is a viable alternative if Articuno's team doesn't need that and would prefer it if Articuno isn't forced out by status users or revenge killers. However, using Substitute makes it much more difficult to keep Life Orb on Articuno, and its reliable damage output will suffer against neutral targets, such as Hoopa, Exploud, and Mesprit.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment is used because Articuno needs all the power and speed it can get in order to make use of its unique tools. A Timid nature is used over Modest, as Articuno outspeeds key threats in Venusaur and Medicham with its base 85 Speed. Life Orb is mandatory so Articuno can push through bulkier foes it typically targets with Freeze-Dry. If Substitute is being used, Articuno can opt for Icicle Plate in order to maintain Freeze-Dry's power and not be forced to Roost as often, but Hurricane's power will suffer quite a bit.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Articuno should never be brought in if Stealth Rock is up because it'll lose 50% of its maximum HP just upon switching in. Once Articuno finds its way in, preferably against Grass-types or weak special attacks, Freeze-Dry or Ice Beam is a great opening move; Freeze-Dry is preferred when there's a Water-type on the opposing team. Due to its raw special bulk, Articuno is capable of handling an attack from powerful special attackers such as Hoopa, Exploud, and Meloetta in a pinch while 2HKOing in return. As strong as Hurricane is, Articuno should only use it when the power is absolutely necessary, as the shaky accuracy and Articuno's subpar defensive typing could lead it to being KOed early if it misses. Articuno should utilize Roost when it's between 40% and 60% HP to avoid being too predictable when it uses the move, and it's also good to use when the opponent has a Registeel or Bronzong due to Articuno's inability to deal much damage to them anyway. Substitute is best used when Articuno is able to force a switch or when the opposing Pokemon isn't able to break Articuno's Substitute with any move it commonly carries.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to being 4x weak to Stealth Rock, Articuno absolutely needs entry hazard removal to function well. Blastoise and Flygon are easily the two best sources for that, and they are both able to take Fire-type moves for Articuno. Flygon can even handle Electric- and Rock-type moves aimed at Articuno as well while also keeping itself healthy with Roost. Fire-types, such as Delphox and Emboar, as well as fast physical attackers, such as Aerodactyl and Sneasel, appreciate Articuno's ability to remove bulky Water-types. However, do note that Emboar is the only one of these Pokemon that will not stack weaknesses with Articuno. As Articuno's defensive typing is fairly subpar, it appreciates Volt Switch and U-turn from Pokemon such as Eelektross, Magneton, and Flygon to bring it in safely. Although it's somewhat shaky, Articuno can provide a decent offensive response to Venusaur, thus making the likes of Diancie, Samurott, and Alomomola nice partners. Registeel and Bronzong are key Stealth Rock users that also happen to wall Articuno for days, so ways of removing them are a must. Fighting-types such as Virizion, Sawk, and Medicham can easily pressure these Steel-types while also taking some stray Rock-type moves for Articuno. Spiritomb is able to reliably Pursuit trap Bronzong to inflict heavy damage on it. Setup sweepers, especially Substitute + Calm Mind Meloetta and Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary, can use Registeel as setup fodder. Steelix or a Registeel of your own can be useful to take on Diancie, which can OHKO Articuno with Diamond Storm and is able to handle a couple of Ice Beams reliably. Spikes from the likes of Garbodor, Mega Glalie, and Accelgor can make it much easier for Articuno's team to break down the likes of Registeel and Diancie.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With a good support movepool, Pressure, and fantastic special bulk, Articuno can pull off a defensive set rather well. Roost is necessary so that Articuno is able to reliably keep itself healthy throughout a match. Heal Bell is an uncommon move outside of Fairy-types in RU, and Articuno is able to use it to keep its team healthy, most notably in the face of Venusaur. Freeze-Dry is the chosen STAB move for Articuno so that it can still put some pressure on Alomomola and Slowking. Toxic is generally preferred in the last slot to aid Articuno in pressuring the bulky Water-types Articuno targets with Freeze-Dry, but Haze is a perfectly usable alternative, as Articuno can easily stop Substitute + Calm Mind Meloetta and other setup sweepers with it. Protect can allow Articuno to scout for stray Rock-type moves, as its 4x weakness can otherwise leave it susceptible to lure moves, and Substitute can allow Articuno to more easily exploit Pressure in combination with Roost.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread is chosen to maximize Articuno's special bulk considering it has higher Special Defense and lacks any physical resistances it can reliably take advantage of. Leftovers gives Articuno some passive recovery to aid it in its defensive endeavors. There are a couple of Speed benchmarks Articuno can shoot for if it's helpful for its team. 56 Speed EVs allow Articuno to outspeed Abomasnow, but do keep in mind that this could expose Articuno to Focus Blast due to Roost removing Articuno's Flying typing. Alternatively, 44 Speed EVs can be used in order to outspeed Golbat so that Articuno can always hit it with Freeze-Dry before Golbat can Roost. However, Golbat isn't a very common threat in RU, so it's unlikely that this situation will arise very often.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to its 4x weakness to Rock-type moves, it would be wise to make sure that the Pokemon Articuno switches into isn't carrying any Rock-type moves. Keeping Articuno healthy is crucial, as even the strongest of neutral special attacks from Life Orb Hoopa, Choice Specs Exploud, and Choice Specs Meloetta can struggle to 2HKO Articuno from maximum HP when factoring in Leftovers. Due to its unique combination of STAB Freeze-Dry and Heal Bell, Articuno can very easily switch into most Water-types in the tier. It is arguably the only defensive answer to Venusaur in the tier that can also threaten it offensively and stay healthy, so exploit this whenever the chance arises. Thanks to Pressure and access to Roost, Articuno can easily sap the PP of Leaf Storm and weaker Fire Blasts to help its team deal with powerful attackers. Haze and Toxic should only be used on an as-needed basis so that the opponent can't take advantage of a lack of a move early in the game. Although you should not rely on this, it should be noted that Articuno is able to stall out Toxic with its Heal Bell thanks to Pressure.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Articuno is 4x weak to Stealth Rock as a defensive Pokemon, so entry hazard control is an absolute must. Blastoise is able to take Fire- and Steel-type moves for Articuno, can spin away Stealth Rock, and can even run a different move over Refresh with Articuno carrying Heal Bell. Flygon can Defog Stealth Rock, resists Fire- and Rock-type moves, has Roost to keep itself healthy, and can block Volt Switch and other Electric-type moves aimed at Articuno. Articuno is unable to do anything against the likes of Registeel, Magneton, Escavalier, and Bronzong, so it appreciates teammates that can handle them. Mega Camerupt is a great catch-all answer to these Steel-types thanks to its typing and powerful STAB moves. Emboar and Delphox can also beat these Steel-types, but they have a harder time switching into Magneton and, in the case of Delphox, Escavalier as well. Pursuit support from Spiritomb and Sneasel can quickly wear down Bronzong. Articuno is a great check to most special attackers, specifically Venusaur, so teammates that appreciate it being covered are useful. Alomomola can provide Wish support, while Diancie can not only provide Stealth Rock but also use Earth Power over Heal Bell to wear down Steel-types; both are able to take Fire-type moves for Articuno. Registeel is able to check most Rock-types in the tier and appreciates Articuno's Heal Bell support in order to prevent burns from wearing it down. Calm Mind Slowking typically struggles with Toxic users, but Articuno can alleviate this issue while luring in Fire- and Steel-type Pokemon for Slowking to set up on.</p>"

  "Typhlosion": {
    "overview": "<p>Typhlosion is a Pokemon with little to no incentive to be used. Though it functions decently on its own as an offensive Fire-type, it has little to differentiate itself from other Fire-types in the tier such as Delphox, Houndoom, and Emboar, all of which offer far more utility than it. Typhlosion's main selling point is Eruption; however, being easily worn down by entry hazards and common priority moves such as Sucker Punch and Aqua Jet makes it difficult for Typhlosion to keep its health high enough to utilize it effectively. It also has a narrow movepool, lacking significant coverage to muscle through common Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Slowking, Jellicent, and Druddigon. While Typhlosion may not be a completely terrible Pokemon, you should always consider your options before using it, as such options contribute far more to matches than Typhlosion will.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Typhlosion can run Solar Beam + Sunny Day, but it uses up a moveslot and means that Typhlosion loses out on a coverage move, and the extra turn it takes to set up leaves it vulnerable to attackers. Typhlosion can run a Choice Scarf set, but it is heavily outclassed by Choice Scarf Delphox, as Delphox has more coverage, higher Speed, and access to Trick.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Jellicent and Alomomola can take most of Typhlosion's moves very well, though the rare Flash Fire-boosted maximum HP Eruption can put a huge dent into both of them.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types such as Flygon and Druddigon can switch into Typhlosion's moves fairly well, though they struggle to switch in more than once against maximum HP Eruption. Flygon has to be wary of Hidden Power Ice as well.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Typhlosion takes a lot of damage from Stealth Rock, which invalidates the main reason to use it: a fast Eruption.</p> <p><strong>Other Fire-types</strong>: Other Fire-types in RU such as Delphox, Houndoom, and Mega Camerupt can handle Typhlosion fairly well. The only move Delphox fears is full HP Eruption, while Houndoom fears Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Aerodactyl, Choice Scarf Flygon, and Meloetta-P can outspeed and OHKO Typhlosion.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Eruption is an extremely powerful STAB move when Typhlosion is at full HP, reaching a base power of 150 and dealing huge damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Fire Blast is a more consistent STAB move that should be used once Typhlosion falls below 73% HP, as it will outdamage Eruption at that point. Hidden Power Grass hits Water- and Ground-types that will try to switch into Typhlosion's Eruption or Fire Blast. Focus Blast hits Rock-types such as Aggron and hits other Fire-types such as Houndoom and Mega Camerupt. Hidden Power Ice can be used over Hidden Power Grass, as it allows Typhlosion to catch defensive Flygon off guard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Specs along with Typhlosion's solid Speed tier allows it to act as a wallbreaker. The EV spread is very basic, with maximum Speed investment as well as maximum Special Attack investment maximizing its Speed and power. Charcoal can be used, as it doesn't heavily rely on prediction like Choice Specs and allows Typhlosion to OHKO its usual switch-ins such as Houndoom after they switch into Eruption or Fire Blast.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Even though Typhlosion normally shouldn't be considered over other Fire-types, mainly Delphox and Houndoom, Eruption gives it a tiny niche in RU, and for it to work, dedicated entry hazard removal is necessary. Typhlosion should try to switch in only when entry hazards have been removed. Slow U-turns and Volt Switches can get Typhlosion in safely against Pokemon such as Mega Glalie and Houndoom.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Flygon, Togetic, Pelipper, Shiftry, and Skuntank are good teammates for Typhlosion, as they provide Defog support, removing the entry hazards that give Typhlosion a hard time. Similarly, Pokemon such as Hitmontop and Hitmonlee can provide Rapid Spin support. Flygon resists Rock-type moves and is immune to Ground-type moves, while Typhlosion, in return, takes little damage from Ice- and Fairy-type moves. Togetic and Pelipper are both immune to Ground-type moves, but they stack a Rock-type weakness with Typhlosion. Grass-types such as Virizion, Rotom-C, and Shiftry can beat the bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Alomomola that can beat Typhlosion. Pokemon that can set up Spikes, such as Qwilfish, Accelgor, and Omastar, can utilize Typhlosion's ability to force switches, though this is not recommended with a teammate that uses Defog.</p>"

  "Lanturn": {
    "overview": "<p>Lanturn's coveted resistances to common offensive types such as Fire, Flying, Ice, and Water, as well as an immunity to Electric, grant it the unique ability to wall powerful threats such as Magneton, Fletchinder, and Emboar. Its slow Volt Switch allows frailer teammates to switch in without fear of attack, and on top of this, Lanturn packs STAB Scald to ward off Ground-types that may want to block Volt Switch or even just physical attackers that may want to set up on it. Lanturn can further support its team with Heal Bell, and unlike other clerics such as Aromatisse, it does not necessarily sacrifice momentum to do so.</p> <p>That said, Lanturn is held back by middling Special Attack and Defense stats. It is very easily worn down due to its lack of recovery and vulnerability to all forms of entry hazards, as it is generally needed to switch into dangerous threats constantly. It is a bit of a liability against Grass-type threats, such as Virizion and Shiftry.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunderbolt and Discharge have some merit as STAB Electric-type attacks that do not force Lanturn to switch out. Substitute and Charge Beam can take advantage of slower teams and boost Lanturn's Special Attack, but this set would be less than useful against offensive teams. Rest and Sleep Talk alleviate some of Lanturn's issues with recovery and status, but such a set is inherently unreliable. Ice Beam is one of Lanturn's more threatening options against Grass-types such as Rotom-C, though it's generally weak against targets that are hit neutrally. Choice Specs gives Lanturn some extra power behind its attacks. Confuse Ray in conjunction with paralysis can force damaging switches when coupled with Spikes-stacking. An Agility set can sweep extremely frail teams late-game.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gastrodon and Seismitoad</strong>: Though they don't appreciate Toxic, Gastrodon and Seismitoad can block Volt Switch and are immune to Scald. They can use these free turns to Recover, spread status, set up Stealth Rock, or remove items from Lanturn and its teammates.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Though they are usually susceptible to Scald burns, Grass-types such as Shiftry, Rotom-C, and Venusaur resist both of Lanturn's STAB types and can hit hard back. Virizion can even threaten to set up on Lanturn.</p> <p><strong>Druddigon</strong>: Druddigon is one of the most threatening Pokemon that Lanturn does not significantly threaten. While Lanturn can potentially burn it with Scald, Druddigon does not otherwise mind switching into anything Lanturn uses and can use the turns to fire off powerful attacks or set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: As Lanturn lacks much offensive pressure, it risks giving free turns to Pokemon such as Curse Registeel or Calm Mind Meloetta, and Dragon Dance Scrafty.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Support Pokemon</strong>: Lanturn's poor offensive pressure also allows bulkier support Pokemon to take advantage of free turns. Aromatisse, for instance, is not threatened by Lanturn and can pass Wishes or cure its allies of status.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attacks</strong>: Lanturn relies on its typing and has middling physical defense, so it is generally vulnerable to strong attackers such as Gallade or Life Orb Hitmonlee. It threatens most physical attackers with a Scald burn, however.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch is the main draw of using Lanturn. Lanturn forces many switches and can gain momentum with Volt Switch, and because of its low Speed, it is often able to allow a teammate to come in unscathed even if the opponent does not switch. Its second move, Scald, is highly threatening to Fire-types, such as Emboar. Very few Pokemon are willing to switch into Scald due to its burn chance, which also deters Ground-types that may want to block Volt Switch. Protect allows Lanturn to secure Leftovers recovery, which is important because Lanturn often must take many attacks over the course of a battle and has no other recovery of its own. It also incurs possible burn or poison damage inflicted on Lanturn's foes and scouts for attacks, which is especially useful against enemies holding Choice items. Heal Bell removes any status conditions Lanturn's teammates have incurred, but if the team does not require a cleric or already carries another one, Lanturn can use Toxic to wear down bulky foes that are not immediately threatened by Lanturn's attacks, such as Jellicent. Thunder Wave is another option, crippling fast offensive Pokemon and supporting Lanturn's slower teammates, but be advised that Lanturn personally cannot take advantage of paralysis, as it prefers having a slow Volt Switch and relies somewhat on residual burn or poison damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Volt Absorb is preferred over Water Absorb because Lanturn already packs a resistance to Water, while it is otherwise neutrally hit by Electric; furthermore, Volt Absorb allows Lanturn to block enemy Volt Switches. Leftovers regenerates Lanturn's health passively, which is crucial, as Lanturn possesses no recovery of its own. Lanturn's EV spread is flexible and can be adjusted to suit your team's needs; you can opt for a more physically defensive spread or a more specially defensive spread. The suggested EV spread aims to maximize Lanturn's overall defenses while minimizing residual damage, with a bias towards Special Defense, as Lanturn primarily takes special attacks. A slightly more physically defensive spread of 104 HP / 224 Def / 180 SpD with a Calm nature can be used so that Lanturn can take certain attacks better, such as Psyshock, U-turn, Houndoom's Crunch, Emboar's Flare Blitz, or Fletchinder's Acrobatics, though this comes at the cost of some Special Defense. Dropping Lanturn's Speed IV to 26 allows minimum Speed Alomomola to outspeed Lanturn so that Lanturn's Volt Switch brings in a teammate unscathed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lanturn is a great switch-in to special attackers whose moves it resists, such as Magneton, Clawitzer, and offensive Jolteon. It is not incredibly physically bulky, however, so while you shouldn't hesitate to switch it into Fletchinder, whose attacks Lanturn generally resists, be careful when switching Lanturn into powerful wallbreakers such as Emboar. Take advantage of Lanturn's ability to wall and force out many Pokemon by using Volt Switch to set up an advantageous matchup, but don't use Volt Switch blindly against teams with Pokemon immune to Electric. Lastly, if Lanturn is slower than a certain Pokemon that does not threaten it at all (such as Alomomola, which might hit your other team members with a Scald burn or Toxic) you may want to switch in Lanturn so you can then Volt Switch out to another Pokemon safely.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Lanturn is mostly a support Pokemon itself, it generally does not require too much support. It should be coupled with Pokemon that appreciate the free switches Lanturn's slow Volt Switch provides, Pokemon that despise status, such as Uxie, or Pokemon that rely on Rest for recovery, such as Curse Registeel. Lanturn personally hates Toxic Spikes and Spikes-stacking in general, so some entry hazard control is advised, especially paired with grounded Poison-types. Furthermore, it can create VoltTurn chains with teammates that possess U-turn or Volt Switch of their own, including Flygon, Meloetta, and Rotom-C. As Lanturn is easily worn down, it appreciates Wish support on more defensive teams, although be wary of using Alomomola due to redundancy in its role and typing. In addition to Wish, Aromatisse can use Heal Bell, taking pressure off of Lanturn and freeing up a moveslot for it to use Toxic. One particularly good teammate for Lanturn is Golbat, which can handle Grass-types, Defog away entry hazards, and if desired, use U-turn. It is also immune to Ground-type attacks, which Lanturn is weak to, though Golbat should not switch directly into Rhyperior.</p>"

  "Togetic": {
    "overview": "<p>Togetic is generally used as a bulky Fairy- and Flying-type, as it sports high defensive stats aside from having a decent Special Attack. Its defensive typing allows it to check Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee and Medicham, Dark-types such as Scrafty, Spiritomb, and Malamar, and Dragon-types like Flygon. Togetic is a nice defensive pivot, as it has access to moves such as Roost and can also act as a cleric with Heal Bell. It is able to easily switch in on Flygon and prevent it from doing anything, making it the best answer for it in the tier. Eviolite further enhances its Defense and Special Defense; however, it makes Togetic severely crippled by Knock Off, which is troublesome because many of the Pokemon Togetic switches into utilize Knock Off. Furthermore, Togetic's typing leaves it vulnerable to common offensive types such as Steel-types like Magneton, Rock-types like Aerodactyl, and Rhyperior, Electric-types like Jolteon, and Ice-types like Sneasel and Mega Glalie, as well as leaving Togetic weak to Stealth Rock.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Defog is a possibility, although due to Togetic's weakness to Stealth Rock, it's not recommended, as Flygon and Blastoise are superior methods of hazard removal. Wish + Protect can be used, although Alomomola and Aromatisse are generally preferred as Wish passers due to their greater HP. A specially defensive variant can be used to check Houndoom, Delphox, and Meloetta, although it is a relatively weak check and physically defensive variants check more foes. An offensive set with Nasty Plot, Fire Blast, Dazzling Gleam and Roost can be used; however, it often lacks the power and Speed to clean up late game. Encore can be used on the support set to stop Pokemon that use Togetic as setup bait.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Stealth Rock takes 25 percent from Togetic's HP each time it switches in and therefore limits its longevity. Status ailments can be a problem because of how Togetic is consistently needed as a check, and non-Heal Bell variants should be wary of this.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Trick</strong>: Knock Off can limit Togetic's longevity by a lot, as Togetic relies on Eviolite for bulk. Trick users like Medicham and Delphox should be played around with caution because Choice items will severely cripple Togetic.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users like Jellicent can severely cripple Togetic, as its only attacking moves are Dazzling Gleam and Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Strong special attackers like Hoopa, Mega Camerupt, and Venusaur threaten Togetic a lot, and it should not be switched in on these Pokemon. Mega Camerupt is particularly dangerous due to its immunity to Thunder Wave and resistances to Dazzling Gleam and Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types can wall and severely damage Togetic with their STAB moves. Magneton in particular isn't vulnerable to Toxic and Thunder Wave. Flygon and Scrafty can lure Togetic in and surprise it with their Steel-type coverage.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Rhyperior and Aerodactyl are threatening to Togetic, and it should not stay in on these Pokemon due to their hard-hitting STAB moves. Furthermore, Rhyperior is not vulnerable to Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Jolteon and Manectric can hit Togetic with super effective Electric-type STAB moves. Electric-types are also not vulnerable to Thunder Wave and can take advantage of it through Lightning Rod and Volt Absorb.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Pokemon like Drapion and Venusaur should be feared because of their Poison-type STAB moves, which hit Togetic super effectively. However, Venusaur fears Thunder Wave, as it needs its Speed to work efficiently, and Drapion can be worn down by Dazzling Gleam.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Togetic should not stay in on Sneasel and Mega Glalie because of its weakness to their Ice-type STAB moves. However, in dire situations, Togetic can stay in on Sneasel and hit it with Dazzling Gleam, as it survives one Icicle Crash.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Roost is a primary move on Togetic used to maintain longevity and let it act as a consistent check to Fighting- and Dark-types. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple faster Pokemon such as Medicham and Hitmonlee and helps Togetic check Pokemon that try to set up on it. Dazzling Gleam works as Togetic's STAB move and hits Dark- and Fighting-types super effectively. Heal Bell allows Togetic to act as a cleric.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP and 252 Defense EVs maximize Togetic's bulk and allow Togetic to check Pokemon such as Scrafty, Hitmonlee, Medicham, and Spiritomb. A Bold nature assists in increasing Togetic's bulk, while the remaining EVs are invested in Special Defense for additional bulk. Furthermore, an Eviolite is used to increase Togetic's defensive stats.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Togetic set is most effective when used on semi-stall or balance builds. Try to remove hazards before switching in Togetic due to its weakness to them. Aim to switch into resisted moves or weak coverage moves, as Togetic is needed throughout the battle to act as a check to a variety of threats. Be wary of Knock Off because many of the Pokemon Togetic checks, such as Hitmonlee and Gurdurr, carry this move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hazard removers such as Flygon and Blastoise are generally appreciated to mitigate Togetic's weakness to Stealth Rock. Strong physical attackers that take on specially defensive walls, such as Medicham, Sneasel, and Mega Glalie, are great partners alongside Togetic. Pokemon that get rid of Steel-types, such as Emboar and Virizion, are great partners for Togetic and allow it to freely use Dazzling Gleam. Pokemon crippled by status, such as Alomomola and Venusaur, work very well with Togetic thanks to its Heal Bell support. Pokemon that can switch in to absorb Knock Off are needed, as Togetic relies heavily on its item.</p>"

  "Xatu": {
    "overview": "<p>Xatu is primarily known for its ability Magic Bounce, which allows it to bounce back moves like Will-O-Wisp, Toxic, and Taunt and more importantly allows it to bounce entry hazards back to the opponent's field. Xatu has a very good matchup against two common hazard setters in Uxie and Registeel, while its access to U-turn also allows it to act as an effective pivot. Furthermore, Xatu's Psychic / Flying typing gives it a 4x resistance to Fighting and a Ground immunity. It has a decent Speed tier even without investment, allowing it to invest in bulk. It also has a vast movepool, with moves such as Heat Wave, Grass Knot, Night Shade, and Roost. Unfortunately, Xatu is weak to a variety of types including Dark, Rock, Ice, Electric, and Ghost. Furthermore, all Dark-types other than Spiritomb outspeed Xatu and can threaten it with a combination of Knock Off and Pursuit. The popular hazard setter Diancie can be troublesome due to the combination of Heal Bell and Diamond Storm. If the opponent finds out the moveset Xatu is running, it becomes relatively easy to check. Finally, Pokemon like Drapion, Scrafty, and Fletchinder can take advantage of Xatu and set up on it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Xatu can run Heat Wave as a coverage move for hitting Pokemon like Escavalier, Registeel, and Bronzong super effectively. Furthermore, Grass Knot or Giga Drain can be run to hit Rhyperior and Seismitoad. Haze can be used to stop setup sweepers such as Scrafty and Drapion. 40 Speed EVs can be invested to outspeed Exploud, although Xatu cannot do much to it and prefers the added bulk. Wish + Protect can be used to let Xatu act as a cleric, but Alomomola and Aromatisse are better for such a role. Tailwind can be used to support wallbreakers, while Calm Mind can be used in conjunction with a Psychic STAB move to make Xatu a wincon. Finally, Future Sight can be used as a filler option, as it works well with Xatu's ability to U-turn into teammates and threaten Pokemon out.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: All Dark-type Pokemon aside from Spiritomb outspeed Xatu and can threaten it with Knock Off while also being able to potentially Pursuit trap it. Drapion is particularly threatening, as it is not affected by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types like Aerodactyl, Diancie, and Rhyperior can threaten Xatu with their STAB moves. Diancie can also use Heal Bell to treat Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types like Mega Glalie and Sneasel threaten Xatu with their super effective STAB moves. Both of these Pokemon outspeed it, and Sneasel can also use Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types can usually OHKO Xatu and can pivot out on it with Volt Switch. Magneton is also frightening, as it is not affected by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Mega Banette and Rotom can threaten Xatu with super effective moves, so it must be wary of them.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Trappers</strong>: Pursuit trappers can trap Xatu and deal severe damage to it. Thus, Pokemon like Aerodactyl, Spiritomb, and Sneasel should be feared.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers such as Fletchinder, Drapion, and Scrafty can take advantage of Xatu and set up. Scrafty's Shed Skin makes it a particularly dangerous threat.</p>",

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn allows Xatu to pivot out on predicted checks or counters, as well as predicted Pursuit trappers. U-turn also allows it to pivot out of Pokemon that can threaten or trap it with Pursuit. Roost is used to maintain longevity, as Xatu needs to provide hazard control throughout the game. Night Shade is used to deal consistent damage to opposing Pokemon and helps whittle down bulky walls without recovery moves that set hazards like Uxie and Registeel. Finally, Toxic can be used to chip at Pokemon that attempt to set up on Xatu such as Fletchinder and Braviary or walls like Alomomola, Rhyperior, and Slowking.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers is used for passive recovery, which paired with Roost allows Xatu to remain as a stable check towards Fighting-types and hazard setters. Colbur Berry can be used instead to mitigate Dark-type damage from moves such as Knock Off and Pursuit. Rocky Helmet can also be used because it helps to cripple physical attackers, which Xatu usually switches easily on due to its bulk. Magic Bounce allows Xatu to provide hazard control and bounce back status ailments as well as moves like Taunt. An Impish nature is used to boost Xatu's Defense without lowering its Attack, which would make U-turn weaker. Maximum HP and Defense EVs are used, as this is a defensive set, while the rest of the EVs are put into Special Defense for extra bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to switch in Xatu on hazard setters to bounce back hazards. It is very safe to switch Xatu into Pokemon like Uxie and Registeel, as Uxie's only attacking move is a Psychic move, while Registeel only carries Seismic Toss. Therefore, Xatu can easily use Roost on them as well as Night Shade to whittle them down, especially because they have no method of recovery besides Leftovers. Against Diancie and Rhyperior, Xatu should be played more cautiously because of moves like Diamond Storm and Rock Blast. However, if you get a Toxic on Rhyperior, you can spam Roost and win from there. Use U-turn when predicting the opponent to switch into a check to go to an appropriate answer. Use Toxic either on Pokemon that you fear are going to set up on Xatu such as Fletchinder or on bulky walls such as Alomomola and Slowking rather than immediately going for Night Shade. Use Roost when Xatu is low on health, as it needs to healthy to be useful throughout the game. Switch in on Pokemon that you expect to inflict status, such as Alomomola and Jellicent. Try not to lose Xatu until the opposing hazard setter has fainted.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teammates that appreciate hazard control like Fletchinder, Mega Glalie, Aerodactyl, and Vivillon are excellent teammates, as Xatu offers a form of hazard control on teams that don't want momentum to be sapped. Pokemon that check Dark-types such as Fighting-types, like Medicham, Sawk, and Gurdurr, and Fairy-types, like Aromatisse and Granbull, are good partners. Bulky Fairy-types are also good because they can usually switch into Knock Off. Registeel is a good partner, as it resists Ice- and Rock-type moves while also taking on Electric-types well due to them usually using special attacks. Hazard removers such as Blastoise and Flygon can be used if Stealth Rock does get set up, as Xatu has a hard time getting in with Stealth Rock up.</p>"

  "Slowking": {
    "overview": "<p>Slowking is one of the best Pokemon for bulky offensive teams, as it can check Fighting- and Ground-types while still having respectable offensive presence thanks to its good Special Attack. Slowking's solid 95 / 80 / 110 bulk, combined with reliable recovery in Slack Off and Regenerator, ensures it will be around for a long time. Its good all-around base stats and excellent movepool let it run offensive and defensive sets equally as well. Its typing is nice too, granting it useful resistances to Fire, Fighting, Ice, and Water.</p> <p>However, Slowking's typing also gives it five bad weaknesses to Grass, Electric, Dark, Ghost, and Bug, with weaknesses to Knock Off and Pursuit being especially notable. Base 30 Speed is also pitiful, meaning Slowking will often have to rely on sponge-and-hit tactics.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A purely defensive set using Thunder Wave or Toxic can be used. It can be a physical, special, or mixed wall. Slowking can wield Choice Specs, although that does make it very susceptible to Pursuit. Signal Beam can be used to hit Malamar and opposing Slowking. Ice Beam and Shadow Ball are other coverage moves Slowking can run, although their targets are rather niche.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Jellicent is immune to Scald thanks to Water Absorb and can cripple Slowking with Taunt. Registeel is only 3HKOed by a Life Orb-boosted Fire Blast and can stall Slowking out with Toxic. Alomomola can cripple Slowking with Toxic and stall it out with Wish and Protect.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Absol can often OHKO non-Colbur Berry versions of Slowking with a Life Orb-boosted Knock Off, and it can smash Trick Room Slowking with Sucker Punch. It can also survive a +1 Scald. Scrafty can set up a Dragon Dance in Slowking's face and OHKO non-Colbur Berry versions with a +1 Knock Off. If it's running Shed Skin, even Scald burns might not hamper it. Lum Berry Drapion can set up on Slowking and OHKO it with a +2 Knock Off if Slowking lacks Colbur Berry.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Choice Specs Rotom-C outruns Slowking and OHKOes the Assault Vest set with Leaf Storm after a little prior damage. Venusaur can do much the same and can prevent Slowking setting up with Sleep Powder. Swords Dance Virizion can endure an unboosted Psychic and OHKO with a +2 Leaf Blade. However, they all take major damage from Fire Blast, and in Venusaur and Virizion's case, Psychic or Psyshock.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Choice Specs Magneton, Life Orb Manectric, and Life Orb Jolteon outrun and 2HKO Slowking with Thunderbolt. However, Magneton is OHKOed by Fire Blast and Jolteon and Manectric are both 2HKOed by Psyshock.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald has a 30% chance to burn the foe, and Slack Off is used to recover HP. Calm Mind is used to boost Slowking's Special Attack and Special Defense, letting it sweep. Psyshock is an alternate STAB move and helps in winning Calm Mind wars. Thunder Wave can be used instead to cripple faster frail attackers like Absol on the switch in.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs maximize Slowking's physical bulk, since Calm Mind boosts Special Attack and Special Defense, so they don't need investment. A spread of 248 HP / 224 Def / 24 SpA with Psychic in place of Psyshock can be run instead if you wish to beat Bulk Up Gurdurr. The remaining EVs are placed in Speed to outrun opposing uninvested base 30s. Leftovers provides Slowking with a form of recovery. A Colbur Berry can be used to endure a Knock Off. Leftovers makes Slowking more adept in checking the likes of Emboar and Medicham, while Colbur Berry helps deal with Pokemon with Dark-type coverage such as Hitmonlee and Sawk. It also makes Slowking less susceptible to Pursuit. Regenerator keeps Slowking healthy until it's ready to start boosting.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Unlike other boosting sweepers, Slowking should be played as a defensive tank early- and mid-game. Then, when your opponent's team has been weakened, Slowking can boost and try to a sweep. Avoid setting up while Slowking's counters, like Jellicent and Rotom-C, are still standing. Be wary of status, as Slowking has no means of curing itself. This set is best used on bulky offense teams as a check to Fighting-types that still has offensive presence.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Clerics like Aromatisse and Diancie are appreciated, as poison and burns will worsen Slowking's ability to check opposing Fighting-types. They can both also check Dark-types for Slowking. Specially defensive Druddigon can take the Grass- and Electric-type moves Slowking draws in, while Slowking can take the Ice-type moves Druddigon attracts. Pokemon like Scrafty and Mega Glalie that appreciate having a check to Fighting-types pair well with this set. Registeel appreciates having a teammate that can switch into the Fighting- and Fire-type moves it is weak to. It can also set up Stealth Rock and switch in on Grass- and Bug-type moves for Slowking. Mega Camerupt can also wall most Electric-types and set up Stealth Rock for Slowking. Escavalier can switch in on the Grass-type moves Slowking is weak to (even Sleep Powder courtesy of Overcoat), while Slowking can switch in on the Fire-type moves Escavalier fears.</p>"
      },
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald hits decently hard and has a good chance to burn. Future Sight hits extremely hard and helps Slowking force switches. Fire Blast toasts bulky Grass- and Steel-types. Dragon Tail is used to phaze foes and prevents Slowking from becoming setup fodder. It can also prevent your opponent from switching to a Dark-type to tank Future Sight if used at the right time. Grass Knot can also be used to hit opposing Slowking as well as Seismitoad and Gastrodon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs give Slowking good overall bulk while also giving it a HP stat divisible by 3, thus maximizing the recovery gained through Regenerator. 92 Defense EVs let Slowking survive Fletchling's Acrobatics after Stealth Rock and OHKO with Scald. The remaining EVs are placed in Special Attack for more firepower. An Assault Vest gives Slowking amazing special bulk, making it virtually impossible to OHKO with special attacks. Regenerator provides Slowking with a form of recovery that many Assault Vest users lack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is best used as a special tank, so pivot Slowking into special attackers that it can wall like special Flygon and Meloetta. Scald is generally the go-to move, as its high chance to burn can cripple many of the physical attackers Slowking draws in. This set is more susceptible to Pursuit due to its lower physical bulk, so be wary of physically inclined Dark-types like Absol and Spiritomb.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon with low Special Defense like Rhyperior enjoy having this set around, as it can take many of the special moves they draw in. Fighting- and Fairy-types like Virizion and Granbull are also good teammates, as they can check the Dark-types Slowking lures. They can also force out the Dark-types that might try to tank a Future Sight. Registeel and Rhyperior can set up Stealth Rock for Slowking; they can switch in on the Electric-type moves Slowking is weak to, with the former also being able to tank Grass- and Bug-type attacks that Slowking fears. In turn, Slowking can switch in on the Fighting- and, in Rhyperior's case, Water-type moves they are weak to. Escavalier can beat Venusaur that lack Hidden Power Fire due to its 4x Grass resistance and Overcoat, making it immune to Sleep Powder.</p>"

      "Offensive Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room turns Slowking's poor Speed into a strength, letting it strike before anything not using a priority move. Scald lets Slowking perform its role as a tank before setting up Trick Room. Psychic is the alternate STAB move, dealing heavy damage to physical walls like Golbat and Alomomola, though Psyshock can be used to OHKO Virizion. Fire Blast gets great coverage with Slowking's STAB moves, OHKOing Assault Vest Escavalier. However, if you don't need the coverage, Nasty Plot can be used to boost Slowking's Special Attack to massive levels. Grass Knot can also be used to hit opposing Slowking as well as Seismitoad and Gastrodon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs maximize Slowking's HP to give Slowking good bulk, with Special Attack maximized to do as much damage as possible. The rest of the EVs are put in Defense to cushion Slowking slightly from priority moves. A Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs are used to make Slowking as slow as possible. A Life Orb is used as the item to give Slowking as much power as it can get. However, Leftovers should be used if running Nasty Plot, as it can make setting up easier. If Slowking is forced out, Regenerator heals a good chunk of health, possibly giving it another chance to sweep.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is best used as a late-game sweeper, so ideally, don't send Slowking in until your opponent's walls have been weakened or removed. You use this set much like any other sweeper: come in on something Slowking forces out, like a Choice-locked Fighting-type locked into their STAB move or a defensive Poison-type (watch out for Sleep Powder from Venusaur, though), use Trick Room, and KO as many Pokemon as you can. While Slowking isn't frail, it shouldn't be used to sponge hits, as it doesn't have Defense or Special Defense investment.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As with any sweeper, strong wallbreakers like Choice Specs Exploud and Choice Band Rhyperior make for good teammates to soften up the opponent's team. Entry hazards are always appreciated. Rhyperior and Druddigon can both set up Stealth Rock for Slowking to help it get KOs more easily. Additionally, they can both switch into the Electric-type moves Slowking is weak to, while Slowking in return can switch into the Water- and Fighting-type moves Rhyperior is vulnerable to and the Ice-type moves Druddigon should be wary of. Escavalier can take out most of the Grass-types Slowking fears, and due to its base 20 Speed it can take advantage of Trick Room well too. Mega Camerupt walls most Electric-types and can also utilize Trick Room.</p>"

  "Steelix": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its unique typing, Steelix manages to check certain Pokemon other Ground-types would struggle to deal with, such as Meloetta and Magneton, and it has two handy immunities to Poison and Electric, meaning that it is immune to status-inducing moves in Toxic and Thunder Wave, with the former giving it another notable advantage over other Ground-type Pokemon such as Rhyperior by preventing it from getting worn down as easily. Steelix's massive Defense stat lets it focus on investing mainly in Special Defense to make the most efficient use of its EVs and improve its bulk. Steelix is also much more immediately threatening than other defensive Steel-types like Bronzong and Registeel, make Steelix a nice choice for some teams.</p> <p>However, compared to other Ground-types, it is much more passive and really struggles to beat opposing Ground-types, since most of them can beat it one-on-one pretty easily. An unfortunate neutrality to Ice-type attacks means it won't be dealing with Pokemon like Abomasnow and Mega Glalie anytime soon unlike its Steel-type comrades. Furthermore, unlike Rhyperior, Flygon, and Seismitoad, Steelix lacks the offensive presence to threaten Grass-types, and this is another thing to be aware of when using this Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Roar is a pretty nice option to prevent Pokemon like Rotom and Substitute + Calm Mind Meloetta from using Steelix as setup bait. More offensive Stealth Rock sets have impressive surprise potential thanks to Steelix's access to Sheer Force and a sufficient movepool to take advantage of it; physical sets like Stealth Rock / Crunch / Iron Tail / Earthquake with an Adamant nature and special sets like Stealth Rock / Dark Pulse / Earth Power / Flash Cannon with a Modest nature, all equipped with a Life Orb, are really nice options to catch a good number of Steelix's checks by surprise. Protect is another option, making the prediction game against Choice item users easier. Meloetta, Emboar, Magneton, and Flygon, among others, are examples of Pokemon Steelix can scout for what move the opponent decides to go for, so the user can switch into the appropriate Pokemon that resists the attack or stay in. A set with Custap Berry and Explosion makes for a nice suicide lead, effectively blocking Rapid Spin and Defog after Sturdy activation. Ice Fang is an option to deal more damage to Flygon, but that's the only purpose of this move, being a really team-specific choice.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: While Pokemon like Slowking, Jellicent, Alomomola, and Blastoise hate switching into Toxic, they can easily switch into any other move Steelix might use and easily beat it or force it out.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Steelix has a really hard time against other Ground-types like Seismitoad and Rhyperior, since they can easily pressure Steelix and beat it in a one-on-one situation. Flygon, in particular, is really annoying to go against, since bulky sets can easily Defog away the Stealth Rock Steelix sets up, Roost off the damage, and pressure it with Earthquake. Even though Gyro Ball does significant damage to Choice sets, Flygon can 2HKO Steelix before Steelix can 2HKO back.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Sawk, Medicham, Hitmonlee, Gurdurr, and Poliwrath can easily take advantage of Steelix, and some of them can even just destroy it with their STAB moves. Gurdurr in particular prevents Steelix from just using Toxic, since it gives it a free Attack boost.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Steelix really struggles to deal with Grass-types like Virizion, Venusaur, and Rotom-C due to an unfortunate neutrality to Grass-type attacks that means it won't be taking Leaf Storms too well. Furthermore, most of them resist Earthquake, take very little from Heavy Slam, and in some cases, are able to take advantage of Steelix through moves like Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: While all Fire-types fear switching into Earthquake, if they are provided a safe switch in, Pokemon like Houndoom, Delphox, Emboar, and Mega Camerupt can KO Steelix with their STAB moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is mandatory on Steelix to pressure the opposing team through the residual it provides. Earthquake is a reliable STAB move capable of dealing decent damage to neutral targets like Water-types and is Steelix's main tool against Fire-types like Emboar and Mega Camerupt, Electric-types like Jolteon and Manectric, and opposing Steel-types like Registeel and Escavalier. Toxic is perhaps the most important move on Steelix's arsenal, being its main way to punish switches in from Water-types like Slowking and Jellicent and Grass-types like Venusaur, Rotom-C, and Virizion and somewhat patching Steelix's passivity. Heavy Slam is the Steel-type STAB move of choice thanks to Steelix being heavier than its intended targets, dealing big damage to Fairy-type Pokemon such as Diancie, Granbull, and Aromatisse and Psychic-types like Sigilyph and Meloetta. Gyro Ball is a secondary option that can be used to deal greater damage to heavier and faster Pokemon such as Mega Glalie, Flygon, and Virizion.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment is used in order to improve Steelix's bulk, since its massive Defense stat makes this the more efficient EV distribution. Leftovers is the item of choice, providing a means of passive recovery and improving Steelix's longevity. Sturdy lets Steelix grab a clutch revenge kill by surviving a hit and retaliating if it can stay at full health, getting rid of obnoxious Fire- and Fighting-types. When you're using Heavy Slam, Careful is the preferred nature. However, when you're running Gyro Ball, it is recommended to run a Sassy nature, preferably with 0 Speed IVs, in order to increase Gyro Ball's damage output.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Steelix finds better use on more defensively inclined teams thanks to the valuable role compression it provides, as being a Stealth Rock user able to block Volt Switch unlike other Steel-types is a huge plus. Make sure to preserve Sturdy if the opportunity arises, as threatening Fire-types like Emboar and Delphox and obnoxious Electric-types like Jolteon and Manectric can be easily removed from play if Steelix's Sturdy remains intact. Steelix also finds a good number of opportunities to set Stealth Rock up against Flying-types like Fletchinder, Braviary, and Aerodactyl and Electric-types like Jolteon and Magneton, but one has to be careful because all those Pokemon have means to considerably wear down Steelix. Toxic is a really safe move to utilize early- or mid-game, since many of Steelix's switch-ins are crippled by it, and Steelix has the typing and power to threaten most Steel- and Poison-types, which are immune to Toxic, by itself.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Water-type Pokemon such as Slowking, Jellicent, and Blastoise make for great partners , as they are capable of dealing with the Fire-types that Steelix hates to face while being a huge help against the Ground-types that can easily overwhelm the iron snake, and in return, Steelix can effectively handle most Electric-types. Psychic-types like Delphox, Sigilyph, Medicham, Hoopa, Slowking, and Meloetta help Steelix against threatening Fighting-types, and Steelix proceeds to handle Dark-types like Sneasel and Drapion, which are really troublesome for Psychic-types to face. Even though most Water-types and Ground-types fear switching into Toxic, Steelix struggles to beat them in the long run, so Grass-types such as Venusaur, Virizion, Rotom-C, and Roselia make excellent partners in order to effectively get rid of Water- and Ground-type Pokemon. Fairy-types such as Granbull, Aromatisse, and Togetic are really nice partners for Steelix for the same reason Psychic-types are to take on Fighting-types. However, they make for better Knock Off switch-ins, something Psychic-types really can't do. Poison-types such as Garbodor, Drapion, Golbat, and Skuntank help with the Grass-types Steelix has trouble dealing with. Steelix also loves cleric support in the form of Wish or Heal Bell, so Pokemon like Alomomola, Aromatisse, Audino, and Diancie make for fantastic partners to increase Steelix's longevity.</p>"

  "Granbull": {
    "overview": "<p>Due to how common Fighting- and Dragon-types are in RU, as well as the recent popularity of Sneasel, Granbull has a niche on both defensive and offensive teams thanks to its typing, ability, and raw power. Unlike other Fairy-types in the tier, Granbull boasts an offensive presence thanks to its fantastic base 120 Attack. Intimidate drastically improves Granbull's respectable base 90 HP and 75 Defense and weakens common setup sweepers, such as Scrafty and Swords Dance Virizion. Granbull has a great movepool that allows it to fill many different roles on a team, including Heal Bell and Roar for defensive teams and coverage attacks such as Fire Punch and Close Combat to act as a lure on offensive teams.</p> <p>Granbull's defensive set faces competition from Aromatisse and Togetic, which offer Wish and Defog support, respectively, and have access to active recovery, though neither of them provides offensive pressure the way Granbull does. While Granbull excels in terms of physical defense, it boasts a lackluster base 60 Special Defense, giving common special attackers such as Meloetta and Delphox an easy time picking it off after a bit of prior damage. Granbull has a disappointing base 45 Speed, which leaves it slower than the majority of the tier. This is particularly crippling for its offensive set, as it's outsped by common walls such as Jellicent and Alomomola.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bulk Up can be used on both sets if Leftovers is held, but Granbull's lack of instant recovery hinders it from fully utilizing this option. Stone Edge can be used over Wild Charge as a more powerful option to take on bulky Flying-types such as Golbat and Togetic, though Wild Charge is generally better despite the recoil damage because of its broader coverage and 100% accuracy. Toxic is an option over Roar or Thunder Wave on the defensive set, though this isn't optimal because Steel- and Poison-types are common switch-ins for Granbull. Thunder Punch can be used as a weaker alternative to Wild Charge to avoid recoil damage. Crunch hits Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Bronzong and Cofagrigus harder, but it's difficult to find room for it and it is generally better to check them with a teammate. Taunt makes Granbull a stallbreaker, but it's too slow to be effective in the role. Super Fang is an option on the defensive set to help wear down physically bulky switch-ins, Escavalier, Bronzong, and Rhyperior.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types, such as Registeel and Escavalier, are particularly threatening to Granbull's defensive set. Bronzong is immune to Earthquake and takes very little from Play Rough, though due to Granbull's low Speed, Gyro Ball deals little damage to it. Magneton is faster and can OHKO both offensive and defensive Granbull, though Earthquake on the switch OHKOes Magneton. Offensive Granbull with Choice Band has an easier time, as, with proper prediction, it outspeeds and 2HKOes Registeel and Bronzong.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: With a mediocre base 60 Special Defense, common special attackers such as Meloetta, Delphox, Exploud, and Mega Camerupt can either OHKO or 2HKO Granbull.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water- and Ghost-types</strong>: Granbull's Attack drops significantly when burned by Scald or Will-O-Wisp from bulky Water- or Ghost-types, respectively, such as Alomomola, Qwilfish, Jellicent, Cofagrigus, and Gourgeist-XL. The offensive set is effectively neutered by a burn, while the defensive set allows Granbull to use Heal Bell to cure itself, though it's unable to deal significant damage to these foes.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: In addition to bulky Water- and Ghost-types, there are several physical walls that neither the defensive nor offensive set can effectively break through, such as Togetic, Aromatisse, and Golbat, though Wild Charge helps against Togetic and Golbat. Additionally, the defensive set struggles against Venusaur, Roselia, and Rhyperior.</p> <p><strong>Fletchinder</strong>: Granbull's defensive set can't OHKO Fletchinder with Play Rough even with Stealth Rock damage, though Earthquake on a predicted Roost has a chance to OHKO. Fletchinder is also capable of inflicting a burn on Granbull with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Braviary</strong>: Be careful when switching Granbull in against an opponent running Braviary, as Defiant gives it an Attack boost from Intimidate.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Play Rough allows Granbull to OHKO most Fighting-types in the tier, with the exception of Hitmontop, Emboar, and Gurdurr; it also OHKOes Sneasel and nearly all variants of Flygon. Earthquake hits the Fire-, Poison-, and Steel-types that resist Play Rough, such as Delphox, Qwilfish, and Registeel, and gives Granbull nearly perfect neutral coverage with Play Rough, only missing out on Bronzong. Heal Bell lets Granbull provide valuable team support. Roar adds phazing support to your team and helps by racking up entry hazard damage on expected switch-ins, but keep in mind that the brought-in foe won't suffer a penalty to their Attack from Intimidate. On balanced teams, Thunder Wave is a better option for Granbull's last moveslot because it cripples setup sweepers and expected switch-ins. RestTalk can be used as an alternative over Heal Bell and Roar, but Granbull isn't fast or bulky enough to really take advantage of Rest, and Sleep Talk is unreliable.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Intimidate is one of the big advantages Granbull has over Aromatisse and Togetic, as it artificially improves Granbull's bulk and lowers physical threats' offensive presence. 248 HP and 252 Defense EVs allow Granbull to take as many physical hits as possible, while an Impish nature further boosts Granbull's bulk. The remaining 8 EVs are invested into Attack. Leftovers gives Granbull passive recovery, making it less reliant on Wish support.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Granbull acts best as a pivot into physical attackers, including setup sweepers such as Scrafty and Swords Dance Virizion and wallbreakers such as Hitmonlee and Medicham. Granbull is one of the better switch-ins to Knock Off because it resists Dark-type attacks, drops the foe's Attack with Intimidate, and, unlike Togetic, does not rely on its item for its bulk. This set generally works best on stall and balanced teams. On balanced teams, it's often better to use Aromatisse or Togetic to consolidate your cleric support with Wish passing or Defogging, though Granbull does offer phazing support.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because Granbull lacks instant recovery, Wish support is helpful. Alomomola makes for a strong partner, especially because Granbull can use Heal Bell to cure Alomomola of Toxic, which is often used to wear it down. Granbull often causes the opponent to switch, so entry hazard support helps. Rhyperior and Bronzong are great defensive Stealth Rock users that help deal with opposing Poison- and Steel-types. Cradily is another solid option for its ability to take special hits and recover off the damage it received. Specially defensive Drapion, Roselia, and Cofagrigus can provide Toxic Spikes support, which helps wear down the opposing team. Drapion and Roselia also help by absorbing Toxic Spikes. Cofagrigus is especially helpful in combination with Granbull, as they can cripple most physical attackers with the combination of Intimidate, Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, and Mummy. Granbull's ability to absorb Knock Off makes it a good partner to Psychic-types such as Meloetta, Sigilyph, and Delphox, Ghost-types such as Cofagrigus and Gourgeist-XL, and Eviolite holders such as Roselia and Golbat. Granbull tends to switch in a lot, so hazard removal from Flygon and Hitmontop helps Granbull stick around longer and they take care of the Steel-types Granbull attracts. In return, Flygon benefits from Granbull's immunity to Dragon-type attacks, and Hitmontop forms a \"double Intimidate\" core with Granbull.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Play Rough puts a serious dent in nearly every Pokemon that doesn't resist Fairy-type attacks; with Choice Band, Granbull 2HKOes Jellicent, mixed defensive Quagsire, and Aromatisse after Stealth Rock damage. Fire Punch allows Granbull to OHKO or 2HKO common switch-ins, such as Venusaur, Escavalier, and Bronzong. Granbull's Choice Band-boosted Earthquake OHKOes Drapion after Stealth Rock damage, as well as Fire-types such as Mega Camerupt and Emboar. Choice Band-boosted Close Combat 2HKOes Registeel, Rhyperior, and Piloswine. Thunder Wave is an option if running Leftovers, as it cripples fast foes, helping to clear the way for late-game cleaners such as Choice Scarf Delphox. Wild Charge with Choice Band can be used to 2HKO several bulky Water- and Flying-types that normally wall Granbull, such as Alomomola, Jellicent, Qwilfish, Golbat, and Togetic, but keep in mind that this is at the cost of one of Granbull's other coverage moves. Wild Charge can also be used with Leftovers, but all of the listed foes except for Qwilfish can heal themselves of more health than Granbull can inflict.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full investment in Attack, as well as an Adamant nature, helps Granbull rip through most foes. 44 Speed EVs allow Granbull to outspeed uninvested base 50 Speed Pokemon such as Piloswine and Registeel. The remaining 212 EVs go into HP to improve Granbull's bulk, giving it more opportunities to switch in and a chance to bluff a defensive set. Choice Band is the preferred item because of the incredible power and ability to net surprise KOs that it provides. Leftovers is a solid alternative option for its flexibility and passive recovery, though it makes Granbull deal far less damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Offensive Granbull is far less common than defensive ones, helping it lure in common checks such as Registeel and Bronzong and net surprise KOs. If Granbull runs Choice Band, the loss of passive recovery and lack of Defense investment reduces the number of times Granbull can switch in, so choose carefully when to bring it in. Physically offensive Flygon and many Fighting-types, such as Medicham and Swords Dance Virizion, are generally good foes to switch in on, though many Fighting-types also run Knock Off, such as Hitmonlee, Gurdurr, and Gallade. With Leftovers, Granbull plays similarly to a defensive set but with greater offensive presence and more varied coverage, though it's susceptible to status if lacking Heal Bell.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Granbull punches holes in the opponent's team, so late-game cleaners that struggle against bulky Steel-types, such as Vivillon, Klinklang, and Fletchinder, make for good partners. Knock Off support from Hitmonlee, Scrafty, or Gallade helps Granbull wear down bulky Water- and Flying-types that it struggles against when not running Wild Charge, such as Alomomola, Jellicent, Qwilfish, Golbat, and Togetic. Knock Off also helps against bulky Ghost-types, such as Cofagrigus and Gourgeist-XL. Dedicated checks for bulky Water- and Flying-types also make for good partners. Venusaur and Virizion check Water-types; Rhyperior and Mega Glalie check Flying-types; and Rotom-C, Eelektross, and Jolteon check both. Status absorbers such as Sigilyph and Gurdurr work well with Granbull, especially because Sigilyph counters most Poison-types, such as Qwilfish and Venusaur, and Gurdurr helps break through bulky Ghost-types. Scald absorbers such as Seismitoad, Lapras, and Poliwrath are helpful as well. Seismitoad and Lapras are also good for taking on Fletchinder. Seismitoad also provides Stealth Rock support, while Lapras helps take out bulky Water-types thanks to Freeze-Dry and benefits from Granbull's ability to check Fighting-types.</p>"

  "Sneasel": {
    "overview": "<p>In RU, there are no Pokemon that possess the incredible revenge killing and Pursuit trapping capabilities that Sneasel does. These strengths bring invaluable utility to nearly every team archetype. As a unique offensive Dark- and Ice-type attacker, Sneasel can force switches against Pokemon that wouldn't normally be concerned about Pursuit, such as Flygon and Venusaur. This capability puts Sneasel a step ahead of other Pursuit users, since it naturally threatens a wider range of targets. Furthermore, Sneasel's Speed tier and access to STAB Knock Off, among other good coverage moves, allow Sneasel to consistently revenge kill slower offensive threats or Dark-weak Pokemon, such as Mega Glalie, Sigilyph, and Jellicent, and hold its own against defensive teams. While good offensively, however, poor defensive typing and paltry bulk mean Sneasel can neither switch into nor withstand many attacks. It is also easily worn down by entry hazards and Life Orb recoil. These factors inhibit Sneasel's overall performance and prevent it from excelling as a Pursuit user.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Swords Dance set with either Eviolite or Life Orb may be used, but Sneasel either has difficulty setting up or is still not strong enough after doing so. Counter + Focus Sash can be used on Sneasel to get a surprise KO on the likes of Emboar and Mawile and can catch Choice Scarf users such as Medicham off guard. Toxic is an option on the main set, as it can cripple bulky Water-types such as Alomomola and make them easier to break.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Diancie, Mawile, Granbull, Mega Audino, and Aromatisse can all switch into Sneasel at least twice and KO it. In the case of Mawile, it can hard wall Sneasel while setting up Stealth Rock to further trouble it in the long term. Mega Audino is the most notable of the Fairy-type checks, as it is not fazed by Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Gurdurr, Poliwrath, and Emboar can revenge kill or wall Sneasel while switching into its STAB moves without much concern; however, aside from Poliwrath, they don't fair too well against Sneasel in the long term, as they all can be worn down quickly.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Alomomola, Blastoise, Qwilfish, and Seismitoad can all switch in at least twice on Sneasel and threaten it with Scald, set up entry hazards, or pass Wishes in the case of Alomomola. None of them like getting their items removed, though.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types Carrying Colbur Berry</strong>: Psychic-types carrying Colbur Berry should not be used as your primary Sneasel checks; however, they can lessen your team's weakness to Sneasel due to the fact that many, including Meloetta, Mesprit, and Slowking, can sponge its primary STAB moves and either KO back with the appropriate coverage move or cripple Sneasel with Thunder Wave.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is Sneasel's best STAB move due to its secondary effect and high Base Power, making it useful in nearly any situation by stripping Leftovers from defensive targets and taking out various Psychic-types such as Slowking and Meloetta. Icicle Crash lets Sneasel rip into various Fighting-, Dark-, and Fairy-types resistant to Knock Off and allows it to take out Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin users such as Druddigon and Garbodor without incurring contact recoil. In addition, Icicle Crash's useful 30% flinch rate has the potential to let Sneasel come out of a sticky situation. With its high base Speed and secondary Ice typing, Sneasel makes a fantastic Pursuit user capable of disposing of a wide variety of Pokemon such as Meloetta, Rotom, Flygon, and Venusaur. Low Kick lets Sneasel take out Steel-types such as Registeel, Aggron, and Steelix while dealing significant damage to would-be checks such as Emboar and opposing Ice-types such as Mega Glalie and Piloswine. Ice Shard allows Sneasel to pick off Choice Scarf Flygon, Aerodactyl, and Quiver Dance Vivillon and gives Sneasel the upper hand against weakened priority users such as Hitmonlee and Absol. Iron Tail may be used so that Sneasel can destroy various Fairy-types such as Diancie, Granbull, and Mega Audino, in addition to targeting opposing Ice-types like Low Kick.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sneasel thrives on its ability to switch moves due to its great coverage, so using Life Orb is imperative to make the best use out of its offensive capabilities. Sneasel can, however, use Choice Band instead of Life Orb to give it a fair boost in power that allows it to OHKO Gallade, Bronzong, and Choice Specs Magneton after a layer of Spikes or Stealth Rock while preventing Sneasel from being worn down by Life Orb recoil. Sneasel's abilities tend to be useless in most situations, but Pickpocket has the potential to be useful in very specific scenarios should Sneasel switch into or take a weak Knock Off from a defensive Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Sneasel should be brought in with Volt Switch users such as Magneton and Rotom in order for it to get in safely, as its frailty prevents it from switching in on much of anything. Use Sneasel to Pursuit trap Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Hoopa and Meloetta. Sneasel's Ice typing also allows it to force out Grass- and Dragon-types, so it is capable of slicing a significant chunk of damage off of Venusaur and Flygon with Pursuit too. Sneasel is also good to use as a revenge killer, as it can take out several troublesome threats such as Virizion, Manectric, and Houndoom.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that appreciate Pursuit support generally go very well with Sneasel. Virizion is capable of taking out bulky Water-types that Sneasel detests, while Sneasel gets rid of Sigilyph, Hoopa, and Delphox and weakens Venusaur for Virizion. Sigilyph appreciates Pursuit support too, as the removal of Meloetta and Hoopa lets it pull its weight more easily, and in exchange, Sigilyph can check the Fighting-types Sneasel is forced out by. Finding a way to bring Sneasel in safely on the foe is recommended when running it. Volt Switch users such as Magneton, Rotom, and Rotom-C can help get Sneasel in safely, while Sneasel can dispatch Grass-types for Rotom-C and weaken Ground-types for Magneton, and Magneton has the added benefit of being able to deal with Fairy-types. Entry hazard removal is recommended when running Sneasel due to its propensity to being worn down quickly. Blastoise and Flygon are the best at this job; however, Blastoise has better synergy with Sneasel due to the fact that it's not pressured by Fairy-types and opposing bulky Water-types while Sneasel can provide Pursuit support to let it get off a Rapid Spin more easily. Sneasel also likes entry hazard support on its side of the field to make its job as a late-game cleaner and revenge killer go off more smoothly. Mesprit and Uxie provide Stealth Rock support and check Fighting-types for Sneasel. Mesprit can also provide Sneasel with invaluable Healing Wish support, while Uxie can make use of its U-turn to get Sneasel in safely. Both Mesprit and Uxie benefit from Sneasel's ability to deal with opposing Psychic-types. Qwilfish can check physical Fighting- and Fire-types for Sneasel and provide it with Spikes support, while Sneasel can wear down Rapid Spin users with Knock Off, take out Psychic-types, and keep Defog users such as Flygon from easily removing the entry hazards Qwilfish sets.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its good Eviolite-boosted bulk and unique typing, Piloswine finds its place in the RU metagame as a reliable Stealth Rock setter that beats common entry hazard removers such as Flygon and Togetic. Piloswine has a great STAB combination that allows it to hit a large portion of the metagame for super effective damage. Piloswine also checks Electric-types, due to most of them having weak coverage moves to hit Piloswine with. Although it does have pitiful Speed, Piloswine somewhat remedies this issue with its access to Ice Shard, which allows Piloswine to pick off weakened foes. However, because Piloswine relies on its Eviolite for its bulk, it is susceptible to Knock Off. Piloswine is also weak to common Water- and Fighting-types such as Jellicent, Seismitoad, and Hitmonlee.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Roar can be used to phaze foes and rack up entry hazard damage. Curse is an option to boost Piloswine's Attack and Defense, and it doesn't particularly mind the drop in Speed. These are both appealing options on paper, but Piloswine is pressed for moveslots as it is, and they are more situational than Piloswine's other choices.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bronzong</strong>: Bronzong deserves a special mention, as it resists Ice and is immune to Ground, as well as Toxic, leaving Piloswine hopelessly walled.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: While they certainly do not appreciate switching in on Piloswine's attacks, Fighting-types threaten Piloswine with their high-powered STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Alomomola and Seismitoad can threaten Piloswine with Scald and switch in on any attack Piloswine wants to go for, with the exception of Toxic.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock allows Piloswine to provide invaluable team support. Ice Shard allows Piloswine to heavily damage Pokemon weak to Ice-type attacks such as Flygon, Virizion, and Sigilyph while also being able to pick off a weakened foe. Earthquake is Piloswine's strongest STAB attack, and it allows Piloswine to hit common Pokemon such as Houndoom, Drapion, and Emboar super effectively. Icicle Crash is a powerful Ice-type STAB move that has excellent neutral coverage alongside Earthquake. Toxic is an option to cripple Piloswine's conventional checks and counters, particularly Alomomola, although it loses out on hitting Togetic and defensive Flygon for immediate damage. Icicle Spear is an alternative to Icicle Crash, with the added bonus of being able to break through Substitutes, but its power is inconsistent, making it less reliable.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment alongside Eviolite allows Piloswine to take both physical and special hits, and maximum Attack investment alongside an Adamant nature lets Piloswine hit as hard as possible. However, EVs can be taken out of Attack to add to Piloswine's bulk in order to check threats such as Mega Glalie better, but the loss of damage output is noticeable.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If possible, sending Piloswine in early-game to use Stealth Rock is recommended, as inflicting passive damage to foes as they switch in is incredibly useful. Due to Piloswine's reliance on its Eviolite in order to take hits well, avoiding Knock Off is crucial for Piloswine to effectively check the Pokemon it needs to. Due to no reliable means of recovery, Piloswine is worn down easily, and as such, Piloswine is susceptible to status; burns in particular cut Piloswine's Attack while also dealing residual damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Clerics, particularly Aromatisse and Mega Audino, provide Wish support, which can provide Piloswine with much-needed recovery, and use Heal Bell to cure status, which Piloswine is easily worn down by. Aromatisse and Mega Audino also have a resistance to Knock off, which Piloswine is very susceptible to due to its reliance on Eviolite. Grass-types such as Venusaur appreciate Piloswine's ability to check Mega Glalie, while in return, Venusaur checks Water- and Grass-types. Alomomola can use Wish to potentially heal Piloswine, while Piloswine checks the Electric-types that give Alomomola problems; however, they stack a Grass-type weakness.</p>"

As a Nasty Plot sweeper, Houndoom is second to none and is capable of making use of its obscene power and excellent STAB combo to rip apart defensive cores. However, Houndoom is let down by its paper thin defenses, which render it unable to take anything but resisted hits. On top of this, Houndoom has many checks that fit on a wide variety of teams, such as Flygon and Diancie, meaning that the opponent will likely have at least one good response to Houndoom, rendering it from pulling its weight.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Scarf set can be used to revenge kill various attackers such as Virizion, but is outdone by other Choice Scarf-wielding Fire-types such as Delphox and Emboar. Sunny Day Houndoom with Solar Beam can help deal with bulky Rock- and Water-types, but it is generally inferior to the Nasty Plot set in terms of sweeping prowess. A set utilizing Counter and a Focus Sash is viable, but it isn't that useful and requires a lot of team support to be done successfully. Houndoom could also utilize Reversal alongside a Focus Sash, but it doesn't really hit anything that significant. Taunt is a cool option on teams that rely heavily on entry hazard stacking, as it can prevent Defog; however, Houndoom has a favorable matchup against most Defoggers in RU anyway. Alternate Hidden Powers such as Ice can be used to lure Flygon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting and Fire-types</strong>: Emboar resists Houndoom's STAB moves and can retaliate with a super effective STAB Fighting-type move. Mega Camerupt is capable of tanking any hit at least once and can retaliate with Earth Power. Scrafty, Hitmonlee, Gurdurr, and Hitmontop can come into any move barring Fire Blast and take Houndoom out with their STAB attacks. Hitmonlee and Gurdurr are more effective ways of handling Houndoom due to their access to Mach Punch.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Specially defensive variants of Rhyperior and Diancie can take on all sets lacking Hidden Power Grass or Hidden Power Steel and strike back with STAB Rock-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Virizion, Choice Scarf Medicham, and Flygon are capable of revenge killing Houndoom. Sneasel can switch in on a predicted Nasty Plot or Dark Pulse and OHKO Houndoom after some prior damage with Low Kick.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Specially defensive Alomomola and Blastoise are capable of taking Houndoom's STAB moves and striking back with a super effective STAB move.</p>",

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot boosts Houndoom's Special Attack to extremely high levels, which allows Houndoom to easily blast its way through defensively oriented teams. Fire Blast spares only the bulkiest of Pokemon that resist Fire, as nothing else is capable of switching into a Fire Blast at +2. Dark Pulse has 100% accuracy, a chance to flinch, and nice coverage with Fire Blast, hitting key special walls such as Jellicent. In the last slot, Houndoom has quite a few options. Sucker Punch will also catch your opponent off-guard if you have already revealed that you have Nasty Plot. Hidden Power Water allows Houndoom to hit Pokemon that don't take significant damage from by the rest of its coverage, such as Diancie and Emboar, while also taking out Rhyperior. Hidden Power Steel on the other hand allows Houndoom to get past its main check, Diancie. Hidden Power Grass is capable of OHKOing Rhyperior and Gastrodon at +2, which Houndoom otherwise struggles to do. Sucker Punch allows Houndoom to pick off faster, weakened Pokemon, allowing Houndoom to retain more utility against offense. Flame Charge can increase Houndoom's utility against offensively oriented teams. If Houndoom manages to get to +2 / +1, it is often game over.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs are placed into both Speed and Special Attack, allowing Houndoom to hit as hard and fast as possible. A Hasty nature allows Houndoom to more easily set up on special threats while also allowing Houndoom to Speed tie opposing positive-natured maximum Speed base 95s. Houndoom appreciates Life Orb's power boost and doesn't mind the loss of HP, given its frailty. The final 4 EVs are placed in Attack for Sucker Punch, though if you forgo Sucker Punch for Hidden Power Grass, these 4 EVs should be placed into Special Defense, and a Timid nature should be used.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Against defensively oriented teams, set up a Nasty Plot against Pokemon that can't do much damage to Houndoom, or on forced switches. Against offensively oriented teams, it is not necessary to set up a Nasty Plot, and Houndoom's best option is to fire off its powerful Life Orb boosted STAB attacks and pick off weakened threats with Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Houndoom really appreciates the chip damage provided by entry hazards, which allow it to pick up some key OHKOs, such as Rhyperior with one layer of Spikes and Stealth Rock. Omastar and Accelgor are both good choices for setting up Spikes. Houndoom appreciates Pokemon that can take on bulky Water-types as well as clean up after Houndoom has punched holes in the opponent's team. Choice Scarf Rotom-C and Jolteon are both good options for cleaning up after Nasty Plot Houndoom and give it switch-in opportunities with Volt Switch. Hazard removal from Flygon or Blastoise is helpful given Houndoom's weakness to Stealth Rock. Flash Cannon Sigilyph can also help Houndoom by removing one of its bigger checks, Diancie, allowing Houndoom to run other coverage moves.</p>"

Sadly, its extremely low offensive and defensive stats mostly limit its options to status moves. Even with said drawbacks, though, it finds a niche as an entry hazard setter due to the fact that it is the only Pokemon with access to both Stealth Rock and Spore and is also the most viable Sticky Web setter in the tier. Although not bad, Smeargle's base 75 Speed leaves it slower than several offensive Pokemon in the tier, usually limiting it to a single entry hazard once it puts a foe to sleep. Smeargle's low offensive stats also make it setup fodder for many Pokemon in the tier, although this can be taken care of depending on its moves. Smeargle also happens to struggle against Taunt users due to the fact that it uses status moves most of the time, although Magic Coat can be used to help mitigate this.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Spikes or Toxic Spikes can be used to rack up even more entry hazard damage. Rapid Spin can be used to get rid of entry hazards set up by the foe. Icy Wind with Technician and 188 Special Attack EVs can 2HKO non-Choice Scarf offensive Flygon variants, and it also has the benefit of slowing down the foe. Extreme Speed and Endeavor can be used as an emergency check against a setup sweeper, but these moves are inconsistent seeing as Smeargle must rely on its Focus Sash being intact. Memento can be used to safely bring in a setup sweeper, although Smeargle's subpar Speed means that it will likely be KOed before it gets to use it. Mental Herb can be used to avoid Taunt once, but Smeargle can already utilize Magic Coat and running Mental Herb means that it will have to forgo Focus Sash.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Magic Bounce and Magic Coat Users</strong>: Xatu with Magic Bounce and, in some cases, Magic Coat users can prevent Smeargle from setting up entry hazards, rendering it useless.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Seeing as Smeargle's main role is to set up entry hazards, Taunt shuts down Smeargle completely, although Taunt users should be wary of Magic Coat.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: After Smeargle faints, Defoggers and Rapid Spin users such as Flygon, Hitmonlee, Hitmontop, and Kabutops can get rid of entry hazards, although the latter three must be wary of Ghost-types.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attackers</strong>: After Smeargle's Focus Sash is broken and it manages to put an opponent's Pokemon to sleep, a priority user such as Hitmonlee or Glalie can finish Smeargle off, usually limiting it to setting up one entry hazard. Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch won't work because Smeargle is immune to the former and the latter only works against damaging moves, which Smeargle will not be using much.</p> <p><strong>Faster Sleep Absorbers</strong>: Grass-types such as Virizion and Rotom-C as well as faster Pokemon holding a Lum Berry do not mind Spore and can 2HKO Smeargle, limiting its opportunity to set up entry hazards. It should be noted that Rotom-C and non-Lum Berry Virizion are susceptible to Dark Void, however.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Inducers</strong>: Faster Pokemon with access to sleep-inducing moves, such as Jynx and Vivillon, can put Smeargle to sleep and 2HKO it, although they should be wary of Magic Coat.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spore gives Smeargle some extra time to set up entry hazards while also crippling an opponent's Pokemon by putting it to sleep. Stealth Rock helps secure KOs for Smeargle's teammates and punishes Flying-types and Levitate users. Sticky Web slows down the opponent's grounded Pokemon, which gives Smeargle's teammates a good advantage against faster attackers. Explosion deals some chip damage and grants momentum to the rest of Smeargle's team while also blocking Rapid Spin and Defog for one turn. Whirlwind forces out Pokemon that might want to set up on Smeargle. Nuzzle could be used to paralyze the foe and has the added benefits of not being halted by Taunt and breaking Focus Sashes, giving Smeargle an advantage over Accelgor and Qwilfish, which can otherwise incapacitate Smeargle with Encore and Taunt, respectively. Dark Void could be used if you are worried about Pokemon that are immune to Spore such as Venusaur and Virizion, although the move's imperfect accuracy is concerning. Magic Coat bounces back entry hazards and status moves, such as Stealth Rock and Taunt; however, Qwilfish is the only Taunt user in RU that is faster than Smeargle, and most Stealth Rock users are slower than Smeargle, so they can be put to sleep beforehand. Taunt can be used to prevent slower entry hazard setters from laying down entry hazards of their own as well as prevent Defog users from switching in and removing Smeargle's entry hazards.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature along with maximum Speed EVs allows Smeargle to outspeed as much as possible. As Smeargle has little use for its defenses, 252 EVs can be invested into Attack to boost Explosion's damage output. Focus Sash allows Smeargle to survive any one hit, giving it an extra opportunity to set up entry hazards. Due to the fact that Smeargle has no offensive presence, Own Tempo is its most useful ability, although Technician can be used to boost Nuzzle's power. If Smeargle isn't carrying an attacking move, the Attack EVs should be moved to Defense or Special Defense.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Smeargle works most effectively as a lead, as leading with it keeps its Focus Sash intact and its low bulk means that it will likely be KOed early in the game. Smeargle should focus on putting the foe to sleep first, and then it should set up entry hazards during the free turns it receives. In the case your opponent decides to lead with a Pokemon that Smeargle can put to sleep but can switch into a Pokemon immune to Spore afterwards, it is most optimal to set up entry hazards immediately, prioritizing Sticky Web against offensive teams and Stealth Rock against more defensive ones. It should be noted that several Pokemon immune to Spore in the tier can be hit by Nuzzle, with the exceptions being Rotom-C and Torterra, which are immune to it, as well as Roselia and Trevenant, which can heal themselves with Natural Cure. Taunt should be used against slower entry hazard setters to prevent them from laying down entry hazards of their own as well as Defog users switching into Smeargle such as Flygon and Togetic.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that pressure entry hazard removers, such as Glalie against Defog users and Hoopa and Spiritomb against Rapid Spin users, are great partners for Smeargle to have. Wallbreakers such as Meloetta and Exploud appreciate the entry hazards Smeargle provides, as Stealth Rock's chip damage makes punching holes in the opponent's team easier. Setup sweepers such as Virizion and Houndoom also benefit from entry hazard support, as Stealth Rock damage ensures some key OHKOs and Sticky Web helps them outrun some of their checks. Entry hazard support also makes cleaning much easier for fast attackers such as Delphox and Jolteon. Braviary works well with Smeargle, as it appreciates Sticky Web support and can deter Defoggers with Defiant.</p>"

  "Hitmontop": {
    "overview": "<p>Hitmontop stands as one of the premier defensive entry hazard removers in the tier. With access to both Rapid Spin and Foresight, Hitmontop has no trouble removing these entry hazards either, even against Ghost-types. Intimidate and good 50 / 95 / 110 bulk give it merit on defensive and balance teams alike and help it take on common Pokemon such as Drapion, Shiftry, and Kabutops. Unfortunately, a lack of recovery outside of Leftovers and only above-average bulk mean that Hitmontop can struggle to continually switch into offensive Pokemon without Wish support. Hitmontop is also very vulnerable to status, which many of the common Ghost-types Hitmontop spins against carry. This is exemplified by Toxic Spikes, as Hitmontop often has to switch into them in order to spin them away. Finally, Hitmontop faces decent competition from Golbat, Pelipper, and Togetic, all of which have reliable recovery to keep them healthy throughout the match.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Protect is another option in the fourth slot in order to accumulate Leftovers recovery and scout out the foe's moveset. Sucker Punch can be used to give Hitmontop a decently powerful priority move to pick off weakened Pokemon, though it's pretty weak overall and many Pokemon have ways to get around it. Stone Edge is also an option to hit Flying-types, such as Fletchinder and Braviary, on the switch. However, many of these Pokemon can outspeed Hitmontop and Roost off the damage. Rest with or without Sleep Talk can give Hitmontop a healing option and help it rely less on Wish support, though it takes up precious moveslots that Hitmontop would rather use for other moves. Finally, an offensive Technician set with moves such as Mach Punch and Fake Out might look appealing, but it's 100% outclassed by Medicham, Sawk, and especially Hitmonlee, all of which are stronger, faster, and, in Hitmonlee's case, have access to Rapid Spin.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Sigilyph has access to Magic Guard which allows it to avoid damage from Toxic and status in general, but must be wary of the rare Stone Edge. Other than that, Meloetta has super effective attacks but hates Toxic, and Delphox can either OHKO Hitmontop or set up on it assuming it's not carrying Earthquake or Stone Edge. Hitmontop can do decent damage to some of these Pokemon with Sucker Punch, however.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Fletchinder can both burn Hitmontop and use it as setup bait as long as Hitmontop doesn't have Stone Edge. However, Fletchinder hates Toxic, and it must be careful with using Roost against Hitmontop, as unburned Hitmontop's Earthquake does a lot of damage. Golbat can wear Hitmontop down with Toxic and Super Fang, as well as hit it with a super effective Brave Bird. Both Golbat's specially and physically defensive spreads take little from Stone Edge and Earthquake, meaning Golbat can continually Roost off the damage. Finally, Braviary receives a Defiant boost from Intimidate and can OHKO Hitmontop with Brave Bird. It can also use Hitmontop as Bulk Up fodder, even if Hitmontop carries Stone Edge, and can avoid Toxic with Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Status moves, such as Toxic and Will-O-Wisp, can slowly wear Hitmontop down into KO range for another Pokemon. Ghost-type Pokemon have the easiest time getting these moves off, as Hitmontop will have to stay in for two turns in order to Rapid Spin against them. While Hitmontop does resist Stealth Rock, multiple layers of Spikes and Toxic Spikes will make quick work of Hitmontop, especially if it's not given the opportunity to Rapid Spin. Otherwise, constant pressure from most offensive Pokemon will whittle down at Hitmontop's HP enough to where KOing it should be little trouble.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin gives Hitmontop a way to remove harmful entry hazards for its team, helping many different Pokemon switch in. Close Combat provides a strong STAB move that hits decently hard and prevents Hitmontop from becoming setup fodder. Foresight allows Hitmontop to use Rapid Spin against opposing Ghost-types, guaranteeing entry hazards are removed. Toxic is the preferred move in the fourth slot, crippling common switch-ins such as Mega Banette, Alomomola, and Jellicent by putting them on a timer. Earthquake is a strong option over Toxic that can hit Garbodor and Qwilfish.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment with an Impish nature ensure that Hitmontop can take physical attacks, such as Knock Off and Stone Edge, as easily as possible. Intimidate also assists Hitmontop in better taking physical attacks. Leftovers provides passive recovery, which is important, as Hitmontop has no reliable recovery and will usually be switching into entry hazards to remove them.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If your opponent has entry hazards up on your side of the field and a Ghost-type, it can be smart to use Foresight as your opponent switches so that Hitmontop can immediately Rapid Spin. Some people may even try to play around Foresight by switching in a non-Ghost-type, so it's important to play smart and continually mix your opponent up with your Foresight usage. Keep a careful watch of Hitmontop's HP at all times, and be sure Hitmontop can deal with any Pokemon it switches into. For example, don't switch Hitmontop in on a Hitmonlee not using Knock Off, or Hitmontop will get worn down quickly. Finally, be wary of spamming Close Combat, as the defensive drops can allow opposing Pokemon to secure a KO.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Alomomola, Aromatisse, and Audino are some of the best Wish passers in the tier and are great at keeping Hitmontop healthy throughout the match. Status conditions, such as poison and burn, remain a constant annoyance throughout the match should Hitmontop be afflicted. This makes Aromatisse, Audino, and Lanturn good partners, as they can all utilize Heal Bell to cure Hitmontop's status conditions. Hitmontop struggles against Psychic-types, making Spiritomb, Drapion, and Escavalier good partners to deal with them. Flying-types can be troublesome for Hitmontop, making Rhyperior, Bronzong, and Eelektross helpful teammates. Pursuit users such as Spiritomb, Houndoom, and Drapion can trap Ghost-types and help Hitmontop rely less on Foresight. Houndoom is especially noteworthy, as it appreciates Hitmontop's ability to Rapid Spin away Stealth Rock. Finally, Poison-types such as Drapion, Qwilfish, and Garbodor pair extremely well with Hitmontop, as they soak up the Toxic Spikes Hitmontop hates. Hitmontop's access to Rapid Spin also makes it a much better fit for these Pokemon than a Defog user.</p>"

  "Sceptile": {
    "overview": "<p>Sceptile is a unique Pokemon in RarelyUsed due to being the fastest Grass-type, with a high base 120 Speed that lets it outpace most of the unboosted metagame. Sceptile also has access to moves such as Leaf Storm and Focus Blast that are backed up by its great base 105 Special Attack, making it a pain for offensive teams to handle. Sadly, Sceptile is very frail and has weaknesses to common attacking types such as Fire, Ice, and Flying. It is also prone to being outsped and revenge killed by Choice Scarf Pokemon like Emboar and has trouble breaking through bulky Grass- and Poison-types like Venusaur and Weezing. It faces competition from Virizion as a fast offensive Grass-type due to the latter's secondary Fighting typing and from Accelgor and Aerodactyl as fast offense breakers, since Accelgor can outspeed Choice Scarf Pokemon from the base 80 Speed tier or lower and has access to Spikes, while Aerodactyl is resistant to Fletchinder's priority Acrobatics and has good coverage. Sceptile's only notable niche over these two is in its Grass-type STAB moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A physically attacking set with Swords Dance and Unburden with a Sitrus Berry can be used, as a +2 Unburden-activated Sceptile outspeeds all relevant Choice Scarf users and is nearly impossible to stop. However, Sceptile has trouble setting up with its poor bulk, and it is mostly outclassed by Virizion, which has a secondary STAB type and defensive stats that let it set up easier. A SubSeed set can be used to wear down defensive Pokemon, but it lacks coverage and relies on forced switches in order to work, making it inferior to Sceptile's other sets. Choice Specs can be used as an alternative to Life Orb for higher damage output and no recoil, but being locked into a move is quite unfavorable for Sceptile in most situations, especially against defensive teams. Protect can be used on the Life Orb set to scout for Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Medicham, which would try to revenge kill Sceptile. Leaf Storm + White Herb with Unburden is an option that lacks the power of Life Orb but allows Sceptile to use Leaf Storm once without drawbacks and, with Unburden activated, can make Sceptile a scary threat late-game. Earthquake is an option to hit Poison-, Steel-, and Fire-types hard within a single moveslot, but it doesn't hit as hard as Focus Blast, and many Poison-types such as Garbodor and Drapion can take an Earthquake and hit Sceptile hard.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with higher Speed than Sceptile, such as Accelgor and Aerodactyl, and Choice Scarf users, such as Medicham and Emboar, can revenge kill it due to Sceptile's poor bulk.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Priority moves can KO a weakened Sceptile thanks to Sceptile's low defenses. Fletchinder has super effective priority against Sceptile and can switch in on a Grass-type move. Ice Shard from the more uncommon Piloswine can also be used to revenge kill Sceptile.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Emboar and Delphox resist Sceptile's STAB moves, can usually take a Focus Blast, which Delphox resists as well, and can KO Sceptile with their STAB moves. Houndoom has to watch out for Focus Blast, however.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Golbat and Fletchinder are good checks to Sceptile, as they can take its Grass-type STAB moves rather easily, heal up the damage with Roost, and hit Sceptile back hard with their STAB moves. However, some of the less bulky ones, like Fletchinder, have to worry about the occasional Rock Slide or Hidden Power Ice, especially after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types like Venusaur resist Sceptile's Grass-type STAB moves, and they can take a Hidden Power Flying or Hidden Power Ice and fight back with Sludge Bomb. They also have recovery moves or abilities, so they make for good checks to Sceptile. However, offensive Venusaur risks getting 2HKOed from Hidden Power Flying on the switch after Stealth Rock, and Virizion does not take a Hidden Power Flying well at all.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Garbodor and Weezing resist both Leaf Storm and Focus Blast, take little from Hidden Power Flying, and can retaliate with their STAB moves, but all of them bar Weezing have to look out for Earthquake variants of Sceptile. They also usually don't have reliable recovery, so they can get worn down by repeatedly switching into Sceptile.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Steel-types</strong>: Specially bulky Steel-types such as Registeel and Bronzong can tank any of Sceptile's moves, even Focus Blast, and hit it hard with their STAB moves, or set up Stealth Rock on it. Registeel can cripple it with Thunder Wave or set up Curse on it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm is Sceptile's most powerful STAB move, dealing huge damage to anything that doesn't resist it, but it has a nasty effect of lowering Sceptile's Special Attack upon use. Focus Blast provides great coverage, hitting Steel-types that could otherwise wall Sceptile like Registeel, as well as Houndoom, super effectively. Hidden Power Flying is Sceptile's best way of hitting Grass-types such as Venusaur and deals huge damage to Virizion, an otherwise decent check to Sceptile. Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit Dragon-types like Druddigon while also hitting Grass-types and Flying-types, but it doesn't hit Virizion very hard, which is the main purpose of using Hidden Power Flying. Giga Drain is a secondary STAB move that has no drawbacks unlike Leaf Storm and helps Sceptile heal damage taken from Life Orb recoil. Rock Slide is also an option over Hidden Power Flying or Giga Drain to OHKO Fletchinder on the switch and do serious damage to Delphox and Sigilyph, but it doesn't have much coverage outside of that, and Sceptile needs to use a Naive or Hasty nature in order to 2HKO Delphox with the combination of Leaf Storm and Rock Slide.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb gives Sceptile much-needed power, letting it become a powerful offensive threat. Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature makes Sceptile as powerful as it can be and lets it outspeed the threats it needs to, like Sigilyph and non-Choice Scarf Delphox. If you run a physical coverage move on Sceptile, a Hasty nature is preferred over Timid to keep the physical moves fairly strong, and Sceptile doesn't care about lowering its Defense stat, since it's already frail. Overgrow gives Sceptile's Grass-type STAB moves a power boost when Sceptile is at low health, and this works greatly in tandem with Giga Drain to heal more of Sceptile's health. Sceptile doesn't need Unburden because of its great Speed stat.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Sceptile has trouble switching into many attacks due to its frailty, so try to bring it in with VoltTurn or after a teammate has fainted. Sceptile should be used as a revenge killer and late-game cleaner, picking off weakened threats with its great Speed. It can also be used as a wallbreaker mid-game with Leaf Storm due to the move's high Base Power. Sceptile is worn down quite easily from entry hazards and Life Orb recoil, so Giga Drain is a great move to use to take advantage of Overgrow and give Sceptile more longevity in a match.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Generally, entry hazard removers pair well with Sceptile due to its vulnerability to entry hazards and the fact that it gets worn down by Life Orb easily. Therefore, Pokemon like Blastoise and Flygon make for great partners due to their reliability in removing entry hazards and their abilities to take care of some of Sceptile's other weaknesses, such as Fire-types. Flygon can even get Sceptile in safely with U-turn and can break down some of Sceptile's checks and counters with its offensive Life Orb set. Rhyperior is a great partner for Sceptile due to it countering Fletchinder, a huge thorn in Sceptile's side, checking Fire-types, and setting up Stealth Rock. Fire-types such as Houndoom and Emboar make for great partners as well, beating bulky Grass-types that Sceptile can't muscle through, and in return, Houndoom and Emboar benefit from Sceptile's great matchup against offense due to their mediocre Speed. Water-types like Samurott and Blastoise check Fire-types for Sceptile, and Samurott benefits from Sceptile's high Speed and can wallbreak through a lot of Sceptile's checks and counters with its high power and good coverage moves. Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Flygon and Manectric pair well with Sceptile because they bring it in safely. Checks to Poison-types such as Sigilyph and Flygon are also useful, as Sceptile has trouble getting past them.</p>"

  "Ludicolo": {
    "overview": "<p>Ludicolo finds its niche in the tier as a rain sweeper alongside Kabutops and Omastar, due to its ability Swift Swim. Ludicolo possesses outstanding coverage with its Water- and Grass-type STAB moves and Ice Beam, making it very difficult to switch into. However, even with a Swift Swim boost, Ludicolo is outsped by common Pokemon if it runs a Modest nature, such as Choice Scarf Delphox, Choice Scarf Flygon, and Unburden Hitmonlee, all of which can deal solid damage to it. Strong priority moves such as Fletchinder's Acrobatics and Shiftry's Sucker Punch can take Ludicolo down as well. Ludicolo is also severely hindered by status, as paralysis cripples its Speed, while burns and poison can weaken it quickly in combination with Life Orb damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs can be used over Life Orb to deal more damage, with the drawback of locking Ludicolo into a move and disabling it from using Rain Dance on its own. Assault Vest might seem like a plausible item due to Ludicolo's stat distribution, but it loses out on the power of Life Orb and the utility from Rain Dance. A Swords Dance set can be used to catch foes off-guard, although it is only made remotely viable due to its surprise factor and is weak until it gets a boost. Ludicolo can run a defensively based SubSeed set with Rain Dish, recovering almost a quarter of its health per turn, but due to rain being limited, using such a set isn't a good idea. Focus Blast can be used to take on Ferroseed, but that is its only target. Energy Ball can be used over Giga Drain for more damage at the cost of recovery, but it doesn't gain any notable KOs.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Venusaur and Registeel can easily take Ludicolo's attacks, with the former being able to retaliate with its Poison-type STAB moves and the latter crippling it with Thunder Wave. Similarly, Aromatisse can stall out rain turns with a combination of Wish and Protect, although it has to look out for a rain-boosted Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority</strong>: Priority moves such as Fletchinder's Acrobatics and Spiritomb's and Shiftry's Sucker Punch can deal solid damage to Ludicolo, with the former OHKOing it and the latter 2HKOing it.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Ludicolo despises all status problems, as they can all cripple it in their own ways. Paralysis from Pokemon such as Druddigon, Registeel, and Uxie can compromise its speed, while Toxic from Togetic or Bronzong can weaken it quicker. Druddigon in particular can either deal massive damage to Ludicolo or paralyze it and take its STAB moves well.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Fletchinder can outpace and OHKO Ludicolo with Gale Wings Acrobatics. Other Flying-types such as Sigilyph and Braviary can outpace Ludicolo if rain is not up, but they fear an Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Virizion</strong>: Virizion, with its high natural special bulk, takes very little damage from Ludicolo's STAB moves, while it loses around three-fifths of its health from Ice Beam. In return, Virizion can deal massive damage to Ludicolo with its Fighting-type STAB moves. This situation often ends with both of the Pokemon being KOed, or with one being severely weakened.</p>",

Surf is a more reliable option over Hydro Pump, although it lacks a lot of power, while Scald can burn and cripple physical attackers, at the cost of even more power. Giga Drain gains a STAB boost, can take on Water-types, and offers a bit of recovery, which works well with Life Orb. Ice Beam takes on opposing Grass-types and Dragon-types, forming perfect coverage with Ludicolo's Grass- and Water-type STAB moves. Rain Dance allows Ludicolo to activate Swift Swim so that it can attempt to clean an opposing team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs paired with a Modest nature allow Ludicolo to hit as hard as it can while still outspeeding all it needs to under rain. A Timid nature can be used to outspeed Choice Scarf Delphox, Choice Scarf Flygon, and Unburden Hitmonlee. Life Orb raises Ludicolo's damage output but at the cost of HP. Swift Swim allows Ludicolo to become a dangerous threat under rain, allowing it to outpace Pokemon it normally wouldn't.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ludicolo does best under rain and should be used under it if attempting to clean an opposing team. Attempt to keep Ludicolo away from status, as status can either shorten its longevity or compromise its Speed. Ludicolo should be brought in with slow momentum moves, such as Volt Switch from Eelektross and U-turn from Pelipper.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rain Dance users, such as Liepard, Bronzong, Uxie, and Volbeat, can set up rain for Ludicolo so that it doesn't have to set it for itself. In particular, Liepard and Volbeat have Prankster to set up rain with priority. Bronzong and Uxie can set up Stealth Rock and Rain Dance, with the former using Explosion and the latter using Memento to give Ludicolo a free switch in after both are set up. Other rain abusers, such as Omastar, Kabutops, and Seismitoad, can work well with Ludicolo to break down an opposing team. Slow momentum users, such as Pelipper and Eelektross, can allow Ludicolo to enter the field without taking damage. Memento and Healing Wish support from Spiritomb and Mesprit, respectively, can either weaken the foe's offensive presence or heal Ludicolo and remove its status. Rock-types such as Rhyperior, Kabutops, and Omastar can take on Flying- and Bug-types for Ludicolo, while Ludicolo can take on Grass- and Water-types for them in return. Electric-types such as Eelektross, Rotom-C, and Jolteon can take on Flying-types for Ludicolo, as well as pivot to it with Volt Switch.</p>"

Exploud excels against slower defensive teams, as those without a specific check are blown apart by its monstrously strong Boomburst. Exploud, however, has limited opportunities to switch in due to its lack of resists, average defenses, and vulnerability to all status conditions. Although Exploud is too slow to sweep, it is still extremely good at wallbreaking and supporting faster Pokemon by ripping apart most balanced and stall cores with minimal support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Scarf is an option over Choice Specs, as Exploud outspeeds Choice Scarf Emboar with it. Soundproof can be used, as it allows Exploud to switch into other Exploud and Meloetta, and it can also be used with a Choice Scarf to surprise the latter two. However, without Scrappy, Exploud will have problems with most Ghost-types. Shadow Ball is an option if using Soundproof in order to hit Jellicent, which would otherwise wall Exploud. Taunt can be used to prevent walls from recovering, but Exploud would rather have more coverage. Work Up is a decent option when combined with a boosting item such as Silk Scarf or Life Orb, as it helps Exploud work around teams trying to pivot around it while assuming it is Choice-locked.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel- and Rock-types</strong>: Most Steel- and Rock-types can take a Boomburst; for example, Rhyperior and Diancie can take it and hit back hard with their STAB attacks, Bronzong can take multiple Boombursts and whittle away at Exploud, and Escavalier can trap Exploud with Pursuit. However, Rhyperior and Diancie must be wary of Surf, while Bronzong and Escavalier must be wary of Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: While they have problems coming in on Boomburst, almost all Fighting-types, such as Hitmonlee, Medicham, Sawk, and Virizion can force Exploud out.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Some faster threats such as Choice Scarf Emboar and Delphox can take advantage of Exploud being Choice-locked into the wrong move to switch in and force it out.</p>",

Fire Blast hits Steel-types that are designated to sponge Boomburst, which include Escavalier and Bronzong. Focus Blast can target Rock-types such as Rhyperior and Cradily, whereas Surf can be used to KO Rhyperior in one shot and provides accurate coverage against weakened foes. However, Sleep Talk can be used instead to absorb sleep for the team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Scrappy is the best ability, as it allows Exploud to hit Ghost-types with Boomburst. Choice Specs makes Exploud hit harder, and because Exploud will mainly be spamming Boomburst, it does not mind being locked into the move. Maximum Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature make Exploud hit as hard as possible, although a Timid nature is an option to outspeed threats such as Adamant Absol. Maximum Speed EVs let Exploud outspeed some threats such as uninvested Xatu.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Exploud has bad bulk, so it should be brought in after a teammate has fainted or on a double switch. It is also a good idea to bring Exploud in through the use of Volt Switch or U-turn, although you should be careful if this means Exploud has to take a hit. Exploud should be played as a hit-and-run attacker, as it is easy to revenge kill. That being said, the main move Exploud should be using is still Boomburst. Because Exploud has limited opportunities to attack, try to hit switch-ins such as Bronzong and Diancie with the appropriate coverage move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fast sweepers such as Fletchinder and Jolteon appreciate how Exploud can break down walls for them. Fletchinder can also lure in Steel-types and weaken them with Will-O-Wisp. Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Eelektross, Rotom-C, and Meloetta can bring Exploud in for free. Other options for teammates include Sticky Web users such as Smeargle to help Exploud with its bad Speed.</p>"

  "Hariyama": {
    "overview": "<p>Hariyama finds a place for itself in RU with good 144 / 60 / 60 bulk and Thick Fat, which allows it to reliably check threats such as Sneasel and Houndoom that can otherwise be troublesome for offensive teams. It also has a good offensive typing as well as decent coverage with moves such as Knock Off and Heavy Slam. However, Hariyama has a poor base 50 Speed meaning that it will usually have to take a hit before it can attack. On top of that, it has competition from other Fighting-types in the tier such as Emboar. It also has no way to regain health without Drain Punch, so it needs Wish support to repeatedly switch into the Pokemon it wants to, making it very prone to being worn down. Lastly, its main STAB attack, Close Combat, lowers its important defensive stats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hariyama can run a Belly Drum set, which can be problematic for bulkier teams to face, but this is somewhat gimmicky. It can also run a Sheer Force set but is outclassed by other Fighting-type wallbreakers in that regard. A SubPunch set is an option due to Hariyama's massive HP but is unreliable. Guts can be run, but Thick Fat provides Hariyama with its main niche in RU. Cross Chop can be run over Close Combat to avoid lowering Hariyama's defenses, but its iffy accuracy and lower Base Power make Close Combat more reliable. Force Palm is also an option to potentially spread status, but it is significantly weaker. Lastly, Stone Edge is an option that allows Hariyama to OHKO Fletchinder.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Fletchinder outspeeds Hariyama and can do massive damage with its Flying-type STAB move. Togetic and Golbat both 4x resist Fighting-type attacks but don't appreciate their items being removed and then having to take a Ice Punch or Heavy Slam.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Similarly to Flying-types, Psychic-types can do lots of damage to Hariyama. Colbur Berry Slowking and Musharna deserve special mentions, since they don't fear Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Qwilfish and Venusaur don't fear much except for Earthquake and Ice Punch, respectively. However, both of them don't like their items being removed.</p> <p><strong>Spiritomb</strong>: Spiritomb can take anything Hariyama throws at it and then cripple it with a burn.</p> <p><strong>Granbull</strong>: Granbull resists Fighting-type attacks and has good physical bulk, allowing it to avoid the 2HKO from Heavy Slam. However, if it has a bit of prior damage Heavy Slam can potentially 2HKO.</p> <p><strong>Mawile</strong>: Mawile avoids the 2HKO from Close Combat with Intimidate and can do a lot of damage with Play Rough or set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burns and Toxic poison wear Hariyama down, with burns also reducing its Attack unless it opts for Guts as its ability.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat hits targets that don't resist it hard coming off of Hariyama's solid 120 Attack stat and is easy to spam late-game when Fighting-resistant foes are gone or weakened. Knock Off provides good coverage alongside Close Combat as well as utility by getting rid of Leftovers from Hariyama's switch-ins. Heavy Slam rounds out Hariyama's coverage, hitting Fairy-types hard, while Bullet Punch can be used to pick off weakened targets as well as Focus Sash and Sturdy users such as Sawk. Ice Punch hits Venusaur harder than any of Hariyama's other moves, making them a lot less problematic, while Fake Out can provide decent chip damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>152 Defense EVs allow Hariyama to avoid the 3HKO from Sneasel's Low Kick as well as the 2HKO from Mega Glalie's Double-Edge after Spikes damage. 136 Special Defense EVs with an Assault Vest allow Hariyama to avoid the 3HKO from Flygon's Earth Power as well as the OHKO from Choice Specs Meloetta. The rest is put into Attack to make Hariyama hit as hard as possible. Thick Fat gives Hariyama an invaluable pseudo-resistance to Ice and Fire.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Hariyama in against Pokemon such as Houndoom that can't do much against it and fire off Close Combats if there are few Fighting-resistant Pokemon on the opposing team. Otherwise, use Knock Off to cripple switch-ins, getting rid of Leftovers and the like. Knock Off is going to be used more often during the early- and mid-game, while late-game you can just use Close Combat. Hariyama usually performs best mid-game when it can weaken the opposing team as well as take advantage of already weakened Pokemon. Make sure to keep Hariyama healthy enough to take a hit in order to take advantage of Wish support. Keep Hariyama away from Scald, since burns wear it down and cut its Attack in half.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Hariyama pressures Steel-types, Pokemon that can take advantage of this such as Fletchinder work well. Pokemon that have a good matchup versus Flying-types, such as Diancie, Manectric, and Steelix, are also good teammates. Switch-ins to Psychic-types such as Spiritomb and Drapion can synergize well with Hariyama. Answers to Regenerator cores that Hariyama struggles with are useful. Sigilyph provides a good answer to Poison-types and can be a great status absorber with Magic Guard, which is incredibly useful. Wish support allows Hariyama to repeatedly switch into what it wants to check, and Alomomola in particular is a good answer to Fletchinder.</p>"

  "Aggron": {
    "overview": "<p>Aggron is one of the strongest wallbreakers in the RU tier. With a great Attack stat, Rock Head, and access to STAB Head Smash, it can be one of the single hardest Pokemon to switch into. This is amplified by the fact that Aggron has options for most of the Pokemon in the tier that can handle its powerful Head Smash. Secondary options, such as Heavy Slam, Low Kick, and Fire Punch, allow Aggron to push through potent Rock-resistant Pokemon, like Flygon, Rhyperior, and Bronzong, with the greatest of ease. Aggron's typing also provides it with key 4x resistances to Normal- and Flying-type moves to grant it some opportunities to switch in. However, with that typing comes some severe drawbacks. 4x weaknesses to Fighting- and Ground-type moves combined with a subpar base 50 Speed stat mean Aggron will almost always be forced out after it gets a KO. While it has a fantastic Defense stat, its somewhat low HP and lackluster Special Defense are certainly not doing it any favors, which lets many significant special attackers force it out. While its Head Smash is incredibly powerful and it does have coverage for many of the Rock-resistant Pokemon in RU, the likes of Seismitoad and Poliwrath can stand up to it most of the time.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Aggron has a colorful movepool, it generally doesn't need it, and it doesn't have the stats to use a lot of it effectively anyway. Easily the most notable is a set with Sturdy and Stealth Rock that utilizes a Custap Berry. Such a set should consist of Stealth Rock, Metal Burst, Head Smash, and Endeavor or Thunder Wave in an attempt to get Stealth Rock up early, and keep it up through the use of Head Smash to block Rapid Spin and Defog attempts. While Aggron has access to Toxic to spread poison throughout the opposing team, it would much rather ram into defensive Pokemon with Head Smash. Hone Claws can boost Aggron's Attack stat and make Head Smash perfectly accurate, but Aggron is too slow to actually sweep with the boost. Double-Edge is the only other move Aggron has to take advantage of Rock Head, but it doesn't provide any notable coverage and is barely stronger than a resisted Head Smash. A set with Substitute + Focus Punch can catch some Rock-resistant Pokemon off guard, and Aggron is no joke behind a Substitute, but Aggron usually just wants to launch a Choice Band-boosted Low Kick at predicted Rhyperior switch-ins. Aggron does have access to Rock Polish to fix its Speed, but it has to use a Jolly nature to outspeed Choice Scarf Medicham. Aqua Tail is an alternate option for coverage, but only OHKOes offensive variants of Rhyperior.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poliwrath</strong>: Poliwrath doesn't care about anything Aggron has to offer and threatens it with both STAB moves. Notably, Scald can burn Aggron, crippling it for the rest of the match.</p> <p><strong>Seismitoad</strong>: Defensively invested variants of Seismitoad stand up nicely to Aggron and threatens it with both STAB moves; Earth Power OHKOes Aggron, and Scald might burn it.</p> <p><strong>Rock-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Aggron generally wants to use Head Smash, so Hitmontop, Rhyperior, and Bronzong make for nice initial switch-ins. They should be wary of coverage moves, though.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Aggron is slow and is forced out by most faster special attackers and any Pokemon with strong Ground-, Fighting-, or Water-type moves, including Medicham, Flygon, and Samurott.</p> <p><strong>Cofagrigus</strong>: While it doesn't take Head Smash that well, Cofagrigus forces Mummy onto Aggron to make it suffer the ridiculous recoil of Head Smash and can burn Aggron with Will-O-Wisp.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Aggron's potency as an offensive Pokemon in RU is shown here with a powerful Choice Band set. With a Choice Band equipped and an Adamant nature, Aggron will 2HKO even the bulkiest of Pokemon without a Rock-type resistance with Head Smash. The rest of Aggron's moveset is basically there for covering what can survive Head Smash. Heavy Slam is a good secondary STAB option thanks to Aggron's high weight and is able to take care of Fairy-types more reliably as well as Flygon. Its perfect accuracy may also make it optimal in scenarios where Aggron can't afford to miss with a move. Low Kick is a very important move for Aggron and is arguably the second biggest reason to fear it. It 2HKOes Rhyperior, the primary Rock-resistant Pokemon in RU, without the need for entry hazard support. Aggron's last move targets specific Pokemon that can stand in the way of Head Smash. Fire Punch is preferred, as Bronzong is quite common and it also OHKOes Escavalier without having to risk a miss with Head Smash. Ice Punch is an option if defensive Flygon is a problem for your team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread maximizes Aggron's offensive potential with maximum Attack and Speed investment. Adamant is the preferred nature for the power boost, as Jolly does not give Aggron any notable Speed advantages. Choice Band is the best item for Aggron, as it will be using Head Smash most of the time anyway. Rock Head is the only ability that should even be considered for this set, as the recoil from Head Smash would be absolutely ridiculous otherwise. As Aggron does have some nice resistances to Normal-, Flying-, and Fairy-type moves, it could utilize a bulkier EV spread. However, Aggron's low Special Defense and various weaknesses will usually make this investment very inconsistent.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Using Aggron is relatively simple. It has notable resistances to Normal-, Flying-, and Fairy-type moves, so try to switch it into those attacks. Unless the situation calls for something else, you'll generally want to let Aggron unleash its powerful Head Smash once it's in battle. If the opponent has a healthy Rhyperior, Low Kick is a good choice to go for, as that is their likely switch-in. If you can't afford a miss but still want to use a powerful STAB move, Heavy Slam should be used. Fire Punch is great for catching Bronzong wanting to switch in if Aggron is using it. If Aggron has Fire Punch, make sure to catch Bronzong on the switch in. Finally, make sure Aggron has good pivots to fall back on, as its low Speed will often mean Aggron is forced out once it scores a KO.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Aggron is a powerful wallbreaker, so fast sweepers and late-game cleaners, such as Aerodactyl, are go-to options to take advantage of this. With weaknesses to common Fighting-, Ground-, and Water-type moves, Aggron appreciates teammates it can fall back on when these types of Pokemon come in. Slowking has Regenerator to allow it to keep switching into Water- and Fighting-type moves for Aggron and can run Thunder Wave to slow down the opposing team, run a Choice Specs set to maintain offensive pressure, or give Aggron Trick Room support to help fix its low Speed. If utilizing Trick Room support, make sure Aggron's nature and EVs are adjusted accordingly. Specifically, use a Brave nature, move all the Speed EVs to HP, and reduce the Speed IVs to 0. Virizion resists Water- and Ground-type moves and can maintain offensive pressure with Swords Dance or Calm Mind sets. Seismitoad and Mesprit are good Stealth Rock users to use with Aggron, as Seismitoad is immune to Water-type moves, while while Mesprit is immune to Ground-type moves. Seismitoad can reliably check Rhyperior if Aggron doesn't predict their switch in with Low Kick during a match, while Mesprit can provide Healing Wish support or function as a Rhyperior lure with the right coverage move.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Medicham's good offensive typing in Fighting / Psychic and access to powerful moves in High Jump Kick and Zen Headbutt as well as good coverage with moves like Thunder Punch, Ice Punch, and Bullet Punch make it an excellent physical attacker. It can act as a revenge killer or even a wallbreaker with Choice Scarf or Life Orb. However, its awkward tier results in ties with Pokemon like Venusaur. It also is checked by a variety of Pokemon like Uxie and Spiritomb, and a lack of access to Knock Off makes Pokemon like Sigilyph relatively good checks. A lack of bulk makes it very hard for Medicham to switch into attacks, leaving it mainly reliant on being pivoted in. Finally, High Jump Kick is risky to use with Ghost-types on opposing the team because of recoil, so it cannot be spammed easily.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Punch can be used to OHKO more defensive variants of Flygon that survive High Jump Kick. Fake Out can be used on the Life Orb set to do some chip damage; however, it usually isn't recommended. A Bulk Up set can be used; however, the two given options are usually better. Choice Band can be used over Life Orb to bluff Choice Scarf and do major damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fletchinder</strong>: Fletchinder's priority Acrobatics can OHKO Medicham, which usually has to switch out if this Pokemon is sent out.</p> <p><strong>Spiritomb</strong>: Spiritomb is immune to both of Medicham's STAB types and Pursuit traps it.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types resist both of Medicham's STAB moves and can usually inflict status or deal a good amount of damage; examples include Uxie and Sigilyph.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types and Protect Users</strong>: Ghost-types and Protect users prevent Medicham from freely spamming High Jump Kick because of the threat of recoil and make Medicham more reliant on its teammates to finish them off.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>High Jump Kick allows Medicham to break through a variety of walls and do plenty of damage on neutral hits. Zen Headbutt hits Poison-types that resist High Jump Kick like Venusaur and is safer to use when there is a Ghost-type present. Thunder Punch hits Pokemon like Sigilyph and Slowking that resist both of Medicham's STAB attacks as well as other bulky Pokemon like Jellicent. Trick allows you to cripple opposing bulky checks and counters as they switch in, such as Slowking, Spiritomb, Alomomola, and Sigilyph.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Choice Scarf allows Medicham to act as a revenge killer and outspeed a variety of Pokemon that would normally give it trouble. Pure Power is the best ability on Medicham, doubling its Attack stat. Jolly allows Medicham to tie with positive-natured base 80s like Venusaur. Maximum Attack and Speed EVs are used for maximum damage output and speed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use High Jump Kick when opponents lack Ghost-types, as Medicham takes recoil from missing it; expanding on this, only use it when needed, as the consequences of missing are very unfortunate. Do not normally bring in Medicham on strong attackers, not even on a predicted resisted attack, due to its lack of bulk. Avoid paralysis and burns the most, as they cripple Medicham a lot. Watch out for Protect users like Registeel when using High Jump Kick. If an opponent has a Pokemon like Sigilyph or Slowbro, it is important to predict the right time to use Thunder Punch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dark-type Pokemon such as Sneasel work well with Medicham, Pursuit trapping bulky Psychic-types that check it. Fairy-types like Diancie help with Spiritomb, as well as provide cleric support, as Medicham is vulnerable to status, and, in Diancie's case, check Fletchinder. Grass-types like Venusaur help remove threats like Protect Alomomola that can make using High Jump Kick risky. Pokemon like Registeel and Rhyperior can also check Fletchinder and set up Stealth Rock, which is beneficial for whittling down opposing Pokemon.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>High Jump Kick is Medicham's main and most spammable move, hitting the hardest. Zen Headbutt hits Poison-types that resist High Jump Kick as well as Fighting-types super effectively. Bullet Punch acts as a priority attack due to Medicham's lack of Speed, targeting Pokemon like Mega Glalie, Sneasel, and Aerodactyl, as well as hitting Diancie 4x super effectively. It also targets weakened Choice Scarf users like opposing Medicham and Hitmonlee. Thunder Punch hits Pokemon like Sigilyph and Alomomola.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb is used to enhance Medicham's power and be able to switch moves. A Jolly nature allows it to Speed tie base 80s like Venusaur. 252 Attack and Speed EVs are used to maximize offensive pressure. Pure Power is the obvious ability choice, doubling Medicham's Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Avoid spamming High Jump Kick with Ghost-types and Protect users on opposing teams. Do not switch Medicham in on even a neutral attack from an offensive Pokemon. Make sure that Medicham's attack will KO if it is up against a Pokemon that can inflict status. Use Bullet Punch on weaker Pokemon to finish them off and on faster foes like Sneasel and Aerodactyl. You can bluff a Choice Scarf set before Medicham attacks. However, you still have to predict well, as most Pokemon outspeed Medicham and can do a lot of damage to it; for example, use Thunder Punch on a Sigilyph switch-in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that check Flying-types like Fletchinder are helpful, such as Diancie and Rhyperior. Faster Pokemon are good partners, as they can help deal with fast threats like Virizion and Flygon. Running a Heal Bell user or a Wish passer like Alomomola or Aromatisse can be helpful. A Fairy-type to check Spiritomb and a Dark-type to help against Ghost-type Pokemon like Jellicent and Cofagrigus is also beneficial.</p>"

  "Manectric": {
    "overview": "<p>Manectric has solid Speed and Special Attack to go along with great Electric + Fire coverage. Fire-type coverage is particularly good for an Electric-type in RU, as it prevents the likes of Registeel and Venusaur from reliably checking Manectric. As with other Electric-types, Manectric has STAB Volt Switch to easily build or maintain momentum for its team in order to keep up offensive pressure. Lightning Rod allows Manectric to switch into any Electric-type move in order to boost its Special Attack to become even more threatening than normal. It's also a check to Fletchinder that can fit on offensive teams in an attempt to keep the bird from sweeping through a team. However, Manectric is frail, with even lower bulk than Jolteon, and falls just behind key threats in Virizion and Sneasel, thus limiting its effectiveness against very fast teams it would otherwise be able to pressure. Manectric also faces a fair bit of competition as an Electric-type from Jolteon, Rotom-C, and Eelektross, although Manectric boasts the good Speed of the former two and the Fire-type coverage of the latter.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Manectric's movepool is somewhat sparse, but there are a couple of other options to consider. Iron Tail can severely damage lured Diancie; however, it has next to no use otherwise, and Manectric can simply pressure Diancie by Volt Switching into a reliable check or counter. Substitute can be used on Expert Belt sets to punish sacrificial switches by the opponent, but this causes Manectric to lose some of its utility by forcing it to drop Volt Switch. Choice items can be used on Manectric, but Choice Scarf leaves Manectric incredibly weak while Choice Specs keeps it from utilizing its coverage to the fullest extent. With that said, Manectric does have Switcheroo to allow it to cripple defensive Pokemon, most notably Aromatisse, that it wouldn't be able to get through otherwise. Discharge is a little weaker than Thunderbolt, but it does have a 30% paralysis chance if a team requires some speed control. Thunder Wave can accomplish similar things, but Manectric is frail and would much rather spend its time taking advantage of its coverage in order to punch holes into opposing teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mega Camerupt</strong>: Barring the rare Hidden Power Water, Manectric can't do much against Mega Camerupt and is forced out due to Mega Camerupt's ridiculously powerful STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Regardless of the set, Manectric will be walled off by certain Ground-types. Rhyperior and Seismitoad only fear Hidden Power Grass, and Flygon can win if Manectric opts not to run Hidden Power Ice. Be sure to scout for Manectric's Hidden Power type before sending in these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Special Tanks</strong>: Pokemon with decent Special Defense and a neutrality to Electric-type moves, such as Meloetta, Gallade, Mega Audino, Diancie, and Audino, can usually stomach a single hit from Manectric and KO back or support their team reliably.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Anything faster than Manectric can usually threaten a KO due to its lackluster defenses. Virizion, Aerodactyl, and Sneasel are examples of notable faster threats.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>A simple attacking set gets the most out of Manectric's coverage, speed, and power in order to allow it to pressure more balanced teams significantly. Volt Switch allows Manectric to wear down the likes of Diancie, Aromatisse, and Meloetta into KO range of the proper move later while also building or maintaining offensive momentum for its team. Thunderbolt allows Manectric to stay in later in the game when its checks and counters are sufficiently weakened, and it's also useful for when the opponent simply lacks a reliable switch-in. Manectric's choice of Fire-type coverage comes down to whether the team needs Manectric to have a better chance of cleaning or to have a stronger move off the bat to wear down or KO walls quicker. Flamethrower is generally preferred for its accuracy and it keeps Manectric from becoming setup fodder. However, Overheat hits much harder on the first turn, thus making it better for teams that simply need Manectric to quickly remove Steel- and Grass-type Pokemon. Hidden Power Ice rounds off the coverage by allowing Manectric to deal with Flygon and also to hit Druddigon harder than any other move on this set. Hidden Power Grass is an option if Manectric's team is weak to Rhyperior and Seismitoad, while Hidden Power Water can be used to maintain coverage on Rhyperior and also KO Mega Camerupt, one of Manectric's most feared offensive checks, after it has been lured in. Keep in mind that Manectric needs some chip damage to KO specially defensive Rhyperior with the proper Hidden Power thanks to Solid Rock. Although it sounds a bit unorthodox, Ice Fang can be used over Volt Switch or Thunderbolt to allow Manectric to run Hidden Power Grass in order to cover both Flygon and Rhyperior, but it usually isn't worth giving up the utility of Volt Switch or the power of Thunderbolt.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>There isn't much of a point in going with anything other than maximum Speed and Special Attack, as Manectric is quite frail. Life Orb is the primary item choice thanks to the overall power boost that it gives to Manectric's moves. Manectric won't be standing up to many hits anyway, so the recoil doesn't matter. Expert Belt is a viable alternative due to the super effective coverage Manectric possesses and can be especially useful if Manectric is the team's offensive check to Fletchinder. Lightning Rod should be the only ability to consider, as it gives Manectric a Special Attack boost if it finds the chance to switch into a stray Electric-type move like Volt Switch or Thunder Wave.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Manectric is quite frail and won't survive many attacks, so try to switch it in after a KO, via Volt Switch or U-turn, or on predicted double switches by the opponent. Stray Electric-type moves, such as Thunder Wave from Uxie and Slowking, can also give Manectric opportunities to switch in and a boost to its Special Attack via Lightning Rod. Alomomola and Qwilfish are generally two of the very few Pokemon that Manectric fears very little from offensively due to their tendency to run Scald as their only attacking move. Volt Switch is a good move to use early on to see what the opponent intends to do against Manectric. Should Manectric have the ability to push past the initial response, keep that in mind for when Manectric comes in next time. Although Manectric's primary role should be a balance breaker, it can reliably clean should it be running Flamethrower once faster Pokemon are removed. When using Overheat, Manectric should aggressively try to eliminate or heavily damage Venusaur and Registeel after they've taken a little bit of chip damage from entry hazards or Thunderbolt. Manectric's Hidden Power type should not be revealed until the proper target switches into battle, as it's quite a weak move against most Pokemon that aren't 4x weak to it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Manectric is able to reliably remove bulky Grass- and Steel-type Pokemon, so it stands to reason that its teammates should be able to take advantage of this. Aerodactyl and Fletchinder can greatly benefit from a fallen or severely damaged Steelix and Registeel while a KOed or weakened Venusaur can help Virizion flourish offensively. Manectric struggles to get past Rhyperior, Seismitoad, and Mega Camerupt due to their Electric-type immunity and its tendency to not run the proper Hidden Power for them in order to cover Flygon. Grass-types, Virizion in particular, generally fare well against Rhyperior and Seismitoad. Venusaur is a more offensive answer, but it's a bit shakier against Rhyperior than the former two Grass-types. Flygon and Slowking can stomach Mega Camerupt's STAB moves reliably. In particular, Flygon can work especially well with Manectric due to being able to form an offensive VoltTurn core with Manectric and it can also run a Choice Scarf set with Tailwind to let Manectric clean up offensive teams late-game with a crucial Speed boost. Other Pokemon to consider for a VoltTurn core are Scyther and Magneton, as Scyther appreciates Steel- and bulky Water-type Pokemon being removed and Magneton shares similar checks and counters to Manectric. Although it isn't weak to Stealth Rock, Manectric likes to switch in and out a lot and is vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards. This makes Flygon, Blastoise, and Hitmontop solid options, as they can utilize Defog and Rapid Spin to get rid of entry hazards. Meloetta and Diancie are key specially bulky Pokemon that can take a hit or two from Manectric and hit back pretty hard. Spiritomb makes Meloetta's life miserable due to being immune to both of its STAB moves, while Choice Band Escavalier can maintain offensive pressure against both of them as well as less common specially bulky checks to Manectric, such as Mega Audino and regular Audino. Although they are not as common as they used to be, Toxic Spikes can be a big help to Manectric in wearing down common answers, such as Mega Camerupt and Seismitoad. Qwilfish is most notable, as it can use Mega Audino and Aromatisse as Toxic Spikes fodder, even able to Taunt the former to keep it from setting up Calm Minds or supporting its team, while also drawing in Electric-type moves for Manectric to switch into.</p>"

  "Roselia": {
    "overview": "<p>Access to Spikes and Toxic Spikes gives Roselia a niche as a bulky entry hazard setter on stall or heavily defensive balance teams. Thanks to its typing, Roselia is immune to poison and absorbs Toxic Spikes, and it can switch into most Water- and Grass-types and hit them super effectively. The combination of Natural Cure and a resistance to Water-type attacks makes Roselia one of the top switch-ins to Scald, only second to the likes of Jellicent, Cradily, Seismitoad, and Gastrodon, which are immune to Water-type attacks.</p> <p>Unfortunately, even with Eviolite, Roselia's terrible base 45 Defense makes it susceptible to physical attackers. Common Fire- and Psychic-types such as Emboar, Delphox, and Medicham can OHKO Roselia, and Calm Mind users such as Sigilyph and Meloetta are especially dangerous because they can switch into Roselia and set up on it. Roselia depends on Eviolite for its bulk, so Knock Off and Trick users such as Gurdurr, Rotom-C, and Escavalier severely threaten it. Because Defoggers like Flygon and Togetic are very common, keeping entry hazards on the field can be difficult. Toxic Spikes is particularly difficult for Roselia to keep on the field because it has trouble getting past grounded Poison-types such as Drapion and Venusaur, though it can 3HKO Qwilfish with Giga Drain. Roselia faces strong competition as a Spiker from Qwilfish, which is the better option on most teams because it can take Knock Off better and use its fast Taunt to prevent foes from setting up.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Roselia's EV spread can be changed to 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD or 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD; full Defense investment allows Roselia to take less damage from Rhyperior, while more investment in Special Defense helps it against Rotom-C, but neither of these spreads helps much against common wallbreakers such as Exploud and Emboar. Synthesis can be dropped in favor of Toxic Spikes, but you should keep in mind that this severely cuts down on Roselia's longevity, so Wish support is highly recommended for this build. Rest can be used as an alternative to Synthesis because Natural Cure removes sleep upon switching out, but switching Roselia out is predictable and gives the opponent a free turn. Leech Seed drains the health of predicted switches, but the active recovery of Synthesis is generally preferred. Stun Spore is another option to cripple predicted switch-ins. Leaf Storm can be used in conjunction with a more offensive EV spread to net surprise KOs on bulky Water-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon such as Delphox, Mega Camerupt, and Emboar can switch into any of Roselia's moves bar Sleep Powder and OHKO it. Unboosted Houndoom and Fletchinder also have a chance to OHKO Roselia from full health and can use it as setup bait.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Nearly all Psychic-types, such as Meloetta, Sigilyph, and Medicham, can either OHKO or 2HKO Roselia or set up Calm Mind on it. Tank Bronzong and support Uxie are exceptions because they deal little damage and are primarily used to set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Trick</strong>: Losing Eviolite drastically cuts Roselia's bulk. Knock Off users are extremely common in RU and include Scrafty, Eelektross, and Drapion. Rotom-C is the only common user of Trick in RU.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Despite Eviolite and Defense investment, Roselia is easily OHKOed by powerful physical attackers, particularly those with a type advantage such as Escavalier, Sneasel, and Mega Glalie. Reckless Hitmonlee can OHKO or 2HKO Roselia even without a super effective hit.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removal</strong>: The two most common Defoggers in RU, Flygon and Togetic, take no damage from both Spikes and Toxic Spikes and can remove them easily. While Togetic hates taking repeated Sludge Bombs and deals little damage to Roselia, mixed defensive Flygon takes little damage from Roselia's attacks and can U-turn out or pick off a weakened Roselia. Grounded Poison-types also absorb Roselia's Toxic Spikes merely by switching in, and barring Qwilfish, they take little damage from Sludge Bomb and Giga Drain.</p>",

      "Bulky Spiker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes can be used to gradually deal chip damage to grounded opponents such as Emboar and Registeel. Synthesis prevents Roselia from being worn down, allowing it to absorb status more easily and set up Spikes multiple times if needed. Giga Drain hits many common Stealth Rock setters super effectively, such as Seismitoad and Rhyperior, as well as Water- and Ground-types in general. Sludge Bomb lets Roselia damage common Grass- and Fairy-types, such as Rotom-C, Aromatisse, and Virizion. Hidden Power Fire is an option to hit Escavalier on the switch, either 2HKOing or 3HKOing it, depending on its set.</p> <p>If your team already has an answer to bulky Water-types or opposing Grass-types, you can opt to swap Giga Drain or Sludge Bomb for one of Roselia's other support moves. Toxic Spikes is particularly good against offensive teams and provides more passive damage throughout the match than Spikes does. Sleep Powder helps Roselia set up more entry hazards, cripple foes, and ensure that it can KO Jellicent, which would otherwise be able to recover the damage taken from Giga Drain. Aromatherapy is another solid option if you're having difficulty fitting cleric support on your team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs improve Roselia's overall bulk, while the Defense investment guarantees that Adamant Samurott's Megahorn will at best 3HKO Roselia even after Stealth Rock damage. The remaining 88 EVs go into Special Defense to improve Roselia's already solid bulk, making it a good switch-in to all common Grass- and Water-types except Clawitzer. Eviolite is the only item Roselia should ever hold because it drastically improves Roselia's bulk. A Calm nature further enhances Roselia's special bulk, giving it more opportunities to switch in.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Roselia can switch into many common defensive Pokemon, such as Aromatisse and Alomomola, lay down Spikes or Toxic Spikes, and apply pressure with Giga Drain and Sludge Bomb. Roselia also does well against common Stealth Rock setters, such as Seismitoad and Rhyperior, which are both 4x weak to Giga Drain, although Roselia can only 2HKO Rhyperior's tank set. If the opponent does not have a grounded Poison-type, it is generally best to start with a layer of Toxic Spikes. Against offensive teams, a single layer of Toxic Spikes is plenty, while two layers are often preferred against defensive teams to wear down walls with access to recovery, such as Alomomola and Jellicent.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Strong Dark-types make for good partners for Roselia, as they can take on Psychic-types. Spiritomb provides Pursuit support, hits through Substitute thanks to Infiltrator, spinblocks, and can Taunt setup sweepers. Drapion hits hard with Knock Off, lays down Toxic Spikes, and can use Whirlwind to phaze setup sweepers and rack up entry hazard damage. Houndoom is an option on more balanced teams, as it helps against opposing Fire-types, provides Pursuit support, and can KO Escavalier.</p> <p>Strong Ground-types help against Poison-, Fire-, and to a lesser extent Steel-types, which either threaten Roselia or resist its attacks. Rhyperior offers powerful Earthquakes and can phaze foes and set up Stealth Rock. Piloswine is a good partner for Roselia because it can set up Stealth Rock, check most Fire-types in RU, take on opposing Ice-types, and deter Flygon from switching in to remove entry hazards.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types such as Alomomola and Jellicent can help check Ice- and Fire-types, though Jellicent has terrible matchups against Houndoom and Sneasel and Alomomola offers next to no offensive presence. Alomomola pairs particularly well with Roselia if it is running Aromatherapy, as Toxic is a common way of wearing down Alomomola. Seismitoad pairs well too thanks to Stealth Rock, but they must both be careful of Mega Glalie's Freeze-Dry.</p> <p>Knock Off is very common in RU, so having a switch-in to the move, such as Aromatisse, Hitmontop, or Granbull, helps.</p>"

  "Camerupt": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Camerupt is a potent tank that rips through many common threats thanks to a combination of Sheer Force, a sky-high Special Attack, and powerful STAB attacks, as well as a unique Fire / Ground typing and impressive defensive stats. With five resistances and an immunity, Mega Camerupt checks many common threats, such as Escavalier, Eelektross, and Jolteon. Between Fire Blast and Earth Power, Mega Camerupt has solid coverage that allows it to run Stealth Rock to provide team support and Toxic to cripple checks such as Alomomola and Jellicent or Hidden Power Ice to hit Flygon.</p> <p>Mega Camerupt's typing may only give it two weaknesses, but unfortunately they are a 2x weakness to Ground-type attacks and a 4x weakness to Water-type attacks, both of which are extremely common. It's also easily worn down because it lacks any form of recovery and is hurt by all entry hazards, taking neutral damage from Stealth Rock. Additionally, with a wretched base 20 Speed, Mega Camerupt is easily one of the slowest Pokemon in RU, only outspeeding Ferroseed and Speed tying with Escavalier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A faster EV spread of 168 HP / 176 SpA / 164 Spe can be used to outspeed uninvested Rhyperior. Ancient Power can be used instead of Toxic or Hidden Power Ice to hit the rare Pelipper and Mantine, which otherwise wall Mega Camerupt, as well as to OHKO Fletchinder; against everything else, though, Fire Blast or Earth Power deals greater damage. RestTalk is an option to improve Mega Camerupt's longevity and make it less dependent on Wish support, though this comes at the cost of coverage and its support moves. Roar could be used to rack up entry hazard damage and to provide your team with a phazer, but generally it is better to either attack or cripple the foe. Yawn is a similar option that forces the opponent to decide whether they want to switch or let their Pokemon fall asleep.</p> <p>Nearly all other options are inferior to the main set. Eruption and Overheat do not receive a boost from Sheer Force, making them weaker than Fire Blast. Earthquake also does not receive a boost from Sheer Force, which means that Earth Power deals more damage even against specially defensive foes. Sheer Force negates the burn chance from Lava Plume, making it a weaker version of Flamethrower. Heat Wave sacrifices Flamethrower's perfect accuracy for a minuscule increase in power. Rock Slide gets a Sheer Force boost, but it only hits the relatively obscure Mantine for more damage than Ancient Power. Stone Edge does not get a Sheer Force boost and therefore should never be used. Rock Polish with full Speed investment and a Timid nature might at first seem appealing to patch up Mega Camerupt's poor Speed, but in reality, it's still too slow to outspeed a significant portion of the tier even at +2 Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Alomomola, Jellicent, Seismitoad, Poliwrath, Gastrodon, and Quagsire all resist Fire Blast and either OHKO or 2HKO Mega Camerupt with Scald, though all of them are 2HKOed by Earth Power on the switch. Even more terrifying for Mega Camerupt are Mantine and Pelipper, which, in addition to resisting Fire Blast, are immune Earth Power. Samurott, Omastar, Clawitzer, and Kabutops each OHKO Mega Camerupt with Hydro Pump, Scald, or Waterfall, though they're all OHKOed by Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: While they often have difficulty switching into its attacks, Ground-types such as Torterra, Piloswine, Choice Band Flygon, and Rhyperior can OHKO Mega Camerupt with Earthquake. Flygon's other sets 2HKO Mega Camerupt with either Earthquake or Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Attackers</strong>: Life Orb Hitmonlee can OHKO Mega Camerupt with High Jump Kick even without Stealth Rock damage. Choice Band Emboar and Granbull both OHKO Mega Camerupt with Earthquake. Exploud OHKOes Mega Camerupt with Surf, and unboosted Swords Dance Drapion OHKOes Mega Camerupt after Stealth Rock damage with Aqua Tail.</p> <p><strong>Mega Audino</strong>: Mega Audino, while uncommon in RU, has enough special bulk that Mega Camerupt has trouble breaking through it. Mega Audino can use the combination of Wish and Protect until Mega Camerupt runs out of PP for Fire Blast. Toxic can help Mega Camerupt break through Mega Audino, though Mega Camerupt is hampered by Mega Audino's access to Heal Bell.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast does tremendous damage against nearly all foes that are weak or neutral to it. It OHKOes Virizion, Mega Glalie, Escavalier, Rotom-C, and Sigilyph, it has a chance to OHKO Scrafty after Stealth Rock damage, and it 2HKOes Aromatisse and most Meloetta sets. Earth Power hits the Fire- and Rock-types that resist Fire Blast super effectively, as well as Electric- and Poison-types. It OHKOes Emboar, Delphox, Houndoom, Choice Band and Rock Polish Rhyperior, Qwilfish, Swords Dance Drapion, and Jolteon, and it 2HKOes Alomomola, Seismitoad, and Jellicent, though Jellicent can use Recover repeatedly to stay ahead of Mega Camerupt's damage output and has a high chance to OHKO Mega Camerupt with Scald after Stealth Rock damage. Stealth Rock provides valuable team support. Toxic cripples many of Mega Camerupt's switch-ins, such as Alomomola, Flygon, and Seismitoad. Hidden Power Ice is a guaranteed OHKO against offensive Flygon and has a good chance to OHKO defensive Flygon after Stealth Rock damage. Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast for greater accuracy at the cost of power. Will-O-Wisp could also be used to cripple foes, but Toxic is better at wearing down Alomomola and Jellicent.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>176 EVs in Special Attack and a Modest nature allow Mega Camerupt to do massive damage and secure a 2HKO on Alomomola. 84 EVs in Speed allow Mega Camerupt to outspeed uninvested Cofagrigus. On the turn that Camerupt Mega Evolves, it outspeeds uninvested base 50 Speed Pokemon, such as Rhyperior and Registeel. 248 EVs in HP improve Mega Camerupt's overall bulk. Solid Rock on non-Mega-Evolved Camerupt helps it take less damage on a poorly predicted switch in. A more defensive spread of 248 HP / 176 Def / 84 Spe with a Bold nature can be used to check Emboar. Another alternate spread of 248 HP / 176 SpD / 84 Spe can be used to check Houndoom, Delphox, Jolteon, and Rotom-C, though these spreads come at a major loss in power and reduce Mega Camerupt's ability to break through Alomomola, Jellicent, and Mega Audino.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Camerupt pressures the opponent into switching, which gives it an opportunity to set up Stealth Rock or hit a foe on the switch. One of the major challenges of Mega Camerupt is knowing when to switch it in. As a result, Mega Camerupt benefits tremendously from good prediction. Predicting Volt Switches from Rotom-C, Magneton, Jolteon, and Eelektross gives you a free switch to Mega Camerupt and nets a free turn if the foe is holding a Choice item. Mega Camerupt is also a good sponge for a predicted Knock Off from Escavalier, Drapion, Sneasel, or Eelektross, as well as a predicted Trick from Rotom-C, Choice Scarf Delphox, or Choice Scarf Meloetta. Thanks to its typing, Mega Camerupt can also switch freely into Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave. Toxic should be used when anticipating a Water-type switch-in, such as Alomomola, Seismitoad, or Jellicent, as this will help wear them down throughout the rest of the match. If running Hidden Power Ice, try to hit Flygon on the turn it switches in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Healing Wish support from Mesprit, Audino, or Musharna helps Mega Camerupt survive longer and punch more holes into the opponent's team. Wish support from Alomomola, Aromatisse, or Audino helps Mega Camerupt last longer on more balanced teams. Mega Camerupt appreciates Heal Bell or Aromatherapy support to prevent it from being worn down by poison damage, so Uxie, Aromatisse, Audino, Vileplume, Togetic, Lanturn, Musharna, Granbull, and Lapras make for good partners. Trick Room turns Mega Camerupt's low Speed into an advantage, so setters such as Aromatisse, Cofagrigus, Musharna, Bronzong, Smeargle, and Uxie synergize well with it. Mega Camerupt appreciates switching in safely, so VoltTurn support from Jolteon, Rotom-C, Magneton, Lanturn, Eelektross, Flygon, Meloetta, and Uxie helps. A good way to mitigate Mega Camerupt's poor Speed is by paralyzing foes, so paralysis spreaders make for effective teammates, such as Qwilfish, Druddigon, Granbull, Uxie, and Jolteon.</p> <p>While Mega Camerupt generally runs Stealth Rock, it appreciates other Stealth Rock setters, such as Uxie, Mesprit, Druddigon, Seismitoad, Bronzong, Omastar, and Smeargle, so that it can run both Toxic and Hidden Power Ice. Spikes support from the likes of Qwilfish, Omastar, Garbodor, Accelgor, and Smeargle can help Mega Camerupt more easily OHKO or 2HKO foes. Qwilfish and Garbodor are also helpful for absorbing Toxic Spikes, which would otherwise wear Mega Camerupt down. Bulky Water-types, particularly those with Water Absorb or Storm Drain, help to patch up Mega Camerupt's weakness to Water-type attacks, so Seismitoad, Lapras, Mantine, Alomomola, Lanturn, Pelipper, and Qwilfish are great options that appreciate Mega Camerupt's ability to check Grass-types. Defog and Rapid Spin support prevents Mega Camerupt from being worn down as easily, so Flygon, Togetic, Shiftry, Hitmonlee, and Kabutops make for good partners.</p> <p>Electric-types such as Jolteon, Eelektross, Magneton, and Rotom-C pair well with Mega Camerupt for their ability to check Water- and Flying-types. Eelektross and Rotom-C synergize particularly well with Mega Camerupt because of their immunity to Ground-type attacks. Grass-types such as Shiftry, Vileplume, and Virizion also help against Water-types, as well as Ground-types. Mega Camerupt's offensive prowess is appreciated by late-game cleaners such as Sneasel, Hitmonlee, Fletchinder, and Medicham because it allows them to sweep more easily.</p>"

  "Banette": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Banette possesses the highest Attack stat in the current metagame, allowing it to function as an effective physical attacker. Between Knock Off, Will-O-Wisp, Shadow Claw, and its base 165 Attack, Mega Banette has very few counters and is therefore very good at breaking down defensive cores. Furthermore, its access to Knock Off and Shadow Claw makes it great against opposing Psychic-types such as Uxie, as well as Ghost-types such as Hoopa and Jellicent. Another reason to use Mega Banette is its ability, Prankster, which gives it priority on Will-O-Wisp and helps it against Dark-types and physical attackers in general. Prankster also works in conjunction with Destiny Bond and gives Mega Banette an effective way to KO opposing threats that may sweep, such as Virizion, Absol, Delphox, and Meloetta. Banette's movepool is also decent and includes moves like Gunk Shot, Sucker Punch, and Shadow Sneak. Mega Banette's Ghost typing allows it to work as a Fighting-type check for offense and a decent spinblocker. However, Mega Banette has a bad matchup against the main spinner in the tier, Blastoise, as it generally loses if Scald burns. Due to its lack of resistances, Mega Banette cannot switch in on many attacks. Furthermore, Mega Banette has an awkward Speed tier and mediocre bulk, and, as Prankster does not activate the turn of Mega Evolution, it can be hard to choose when to Mega Evolve.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Protect can be used to Mega Evolve and gain Prankster without taking damage. Thunder Wave can be used in conjunction with Prankster to cripple threats; however, many Pokemon such as Liepard can do this without using up a Mega slot. Toxic can be used to cripple bulky Pokemon that may switch in such as Alomomola. Taunt can be used on a stallbreaker set, while Pain Split can be used to maintain Mega Banette's longevity. A combination of Substitute and Pain Split with Prankster can be used; however, this leaves it with little space for a variety of other moves. A Substitute + Disable set can also be used, but it has similar issues.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fast Fire-types are immune to Will-O-Wisp, allowing them to switch in. Houndoom, Mega Camerupt, Emboar, and Fletchinder are all threatening Pokemon. Houndoom can easily threaten with Dark Pulse, Mega Camerupt and Emboar can take any attack and KO back, and Fletchinder can cripple Mega Banette with Will-O-Wisp itself. However, all of these Pokemon are scared of Destiny Bond, and Shadow Claw does big damage to Emboar, Fletchinder, and Mega Camerupt while 2HKOing Houndoom.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Venusaur, Magneton, Rotom-C, Abomasnow, and Exploud are very threatening to Mega Banette, being able to heavily damage it while not being that affected by Will-O-Wisp. However, slower Pokemon have to watch out for Shadow Claw and weakened attackers fear Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch, while Destiny Bond can catch all of them off guard.</p> <p><strong>Status and Bulky Walls</strong>: Mega Banette is greatly crippled by Thunder Wave and burn. Thunder Wave lowers Mega Banette's Speed, making it very easy to revenge kill, while burning Mega Banette makes it almost useless, as the burn cuts its Attack stat. Toxic is particularly bad for the Destiny Bond set. Most bulky walls carry status moves and can also take several hits from Mega Banette, such as Alomomola and Registeel. However, most bulky walls, especially Registeel, dislike having their Leftovers removed. Unfortunately, Mega Audino is particularly worrisome for Mega Banette, as it resists Knock Off, is not affected by Shadow Claw and Shadow Sneak, and can Heal Bell away Will-O-Wisp burns.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is primarily used for removing items, allowing Mega Banette to cripple bulky walls and hit most Pokemon neutrally. Knock Off is also important as an offensive move on Mega Banette, hitting Ghost- and Psychic-types super effectively. Will-O-Wisp is used in conjunction with Prankster to cripple physical attackers and bulky Pokemon. Shadow Claw is used to hit opposing Ghost- and Psychic-types for more damage than Knock Off while also hitting Mega Evolutions, such as Mega Glalie and Mega Camerupt, and Pokemon with their items Knocked Off. Shadow Claw's main targets consist of physically defensive Slowking and Jellicent, as well as bulky Steel-types such as Escavalier and Steelix. Shadow Sneak is a STAB priority move that circumvents Mega Banette's lacking Speed tier. Shadow Sneak is usually preferred over Sucker Punch because it hits Fighting-types, such as Virizion, neutrally. It is also effective against Pokemon like Delphox, Hoopa, Medicham, and Sigilyph. Sucker Punch can be used over Shadow Sneak to hit Meloetta, as well as potentially OHKO Delphox and Sigilyph. Destiny Bond is an alternative move to stop opposing Pokemon from sweeping, or for securing a KO with a weakened Mega Banette. Finally, Gunk Shot can be used to hit Fairy- and Grass-types super effectively. It most notably hits Pokemon such as Virizion, Granbull, and Mega Audino, but it has a chance of missing and low PP.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Banettite is used to Mega Evolve to gain Prankster and enhanced stats. Insomnia is preferred prior to Mega Evolution to ensure Banette is unaffected by Yawn Uxie and Sleep Powder Venusaur. However, Frisk can be used to scout for items held by opposing Pokemon. 252 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature are used to maximize Banette's damage output. 28 Speed EVs allow Banette to outspeed 44 Speed Jellicent prior to Mega Evolution, as well as outspeed Blastoise after Mega Evolution to mitigate the fear of Scald burns. The rest of the EVs are dumped into HP to maximize bulk. An alternative set of 252 Atk / 56 Def / 200 Spe can be used to allow Mega Banette to outspeed Exploud, Emboar, and Abomasnow. This spread also allows Mega Banette to defeat Fletchinder, as Mega Banette will outspeed it and be able to use Destiny Bond before Fletchinder can use Acrobatics.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Banette should not Mega Evolve if it is possible that Pokemon such as Uxie will try to put it to sleep, as Insomnia can be helpful. In other cases, Mega Evolution should be a top priority. Try to Mega Evolve on slower Pokemon or Pokemon that Banette can afford to take damage from. In other cases, it can be useful to Mega Evolve while using Shadow Sneak or Sucker Punch to not take damage. Try to avoid staying in on Pokemon that can inflict status ailments, as paralysis, burn, and poison are all troubling for Mega Banette. Aim to use a combination of Knock Off and Will-O-Wisp when the opponent switches in a wall such as Alomomola, Aromatisse, or Registeel to remove their means of passive recovery. Shadow Claw can be used to pressure bulky Pokemon even further after their item has been Knocked Off and they have been burned. Will-O-Wisp should be used against physical attackers such as Flygon, Aerodactyl, Rhyperior, and Escavalier. Destiny Bond is hard for setup sweepers to work around, as Mega Banette can easily alternate between an attack and priority Destiny Bond to create mind games for the opponent. Be wary of Lum Berry Drapion, as it can absorb a Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers such as Meloetta, Exploud, and Emboar are helpful in allowing Banette to clean late-game, as they can whittle down the majority of bulky walls on the opposing team. Fighting- and Fairy-type partners such as Virizion, Medicham, Sawk, Granbull, and Diancie that can deal with opposing Dark-types for Mega Banette are also appreciated. Furthermore, specially defensive walls such as Diancie and Registeel are useful, as specially offensive Pokemon can take advantage of Banette's mediocre bulk because it can't cripple them with Will-O-Wisp. Since Banette is a Ghost-type, it can spinblock decently and also appreciates entry hazard stacking due to the residual damage entry hazards provide; therefore, Garbodor and Qwilfish make for good teammates. Finally, Banette can benefit from having setup sweeper partners such as Fletchinder and Scrafty, and it can ease setup for them by crippling physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

  "Absol": {
    "overview": "<p>Absol is one of RU's strongest wallbreakers and is backed up by many positive traits. Its combination of STAB Knock Off and great coverage options in Superpower, Play Rough, and Iron Tail make it extremely hard to switch into. Absol's Sucker Punch is the strongest priority move in RU, giving it a favorable matchup versus offensive teams in addition to mitigating its mediocre base 75 Speed. It can also run a Swords Dance set, making it a formidable sweeper if left unchecked, or Pursuit, helping it support its team by taking out threatening Pokemon such as Slowking and Meloetta more easily. Sadly, Absol's defensive stats are quite poor, and its relatively low Speed stat means it has to rely on Sucker Punch to deal with faster threats, which can play around it with Substitute or priority moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Absol can run a Choice Scarf set in order to patch up its mediocre Speed, but the ability to switch moves and effectively use Sucker Punch is too significant to pass out on. Choice Band allows Absol to hit ridiculously hard off that bat, especially with its STAB Knock Off, but Absol's low Speed makes it an inferior option. Substitute can be used to block status and ease prediction, giving Absol more opportunities to set up with Swords Dance, but keep in mind that it would have to forgo a coverage move to do so.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Virizion, Poliwrath, and Emboar can switch into Absol's STAB moves, with Virizion receiving an Attack boost from Justified, and OHKO Absol with their own STAB moves. It should be noted that the former two cannot switch into Play Rough, however. Hitmontop can switch into Absol while also reducing its Attack with Intimidate and proceed to OHKO with Close Combat. Gurdurr can switch into Play Rough at full health and OHKO Absol with Mach Punch, although it doesn't like losing its Eviolite.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Aromatisse, Diancie, Togetic, and Granbull resist Absol's STAB moves and can easily KO it with STAB moves of their own, but they should be careful of switching into Iron Tail.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Mega Steelix can take Absol's STAB moves well, but it does not like being hit by Superpower or Fire Blast. Alomomola can generally take most of Absol's moves and burn it with Scald, although it should be wary of the Swords Dance set. Tangrowth can switch into Absol at full health and OHKO it with any strong attack, but it should be wary of Fire Blast.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is Absol's most powerful STAB move and has the added benefit of removing a foe's item. Sucker Punch is Absol's best tool, allowing it to revenge kill faster Pokemon and prevent it from being revenge killed itself. Superpower allows Absol to heavily damage Mega Steelix, and Fire Blast is an alternative that also damages Tangrowth. Play Rough hits Fighting- and other Dark-types for super effective damage, while Iron Tail can be used to deal with Fairy-types. Pursuit turns Absol into a powerful trapper, allowing it to pick off weakened Psychic-types such as Meloetta and Slowking.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature with maximum Attack and Speed EVs allow Absol to hit as hard as possible. If Fire Blast is being used, a Naughty nature should be opted for. Super Luck is Absol's only ability with offensive merit. Life Orb slightly boosts the power of Absol's moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Absol should be used early- to mid-game to punch holes through the opposing team, although its powerful Sucker Punch is also quite useful late-game. Be careful when attempting to Pursuit trap a Pokemon, as Pursuit's low Base Power means some targets are very likely to survive a hit if they don't switch out. Pursuit is also a gamble against faster Psychic-types such as Meloetta and Sigilyph, which can outspeed and OHKO Absol if it uses Pursuit. To alleviate this, try using another coverage move earlier in the game so your opponent takes into consideration whether you're sending in Absol to Pursuit trap its foe or simply to attack it with Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teammates will usually depend on the coverage moves Absol lacks. Mega Steelix is a great partner regardless, as it can provide Stealth Rock support and can pressure Fairy-types. Pokemon that pressure Fighting-types, such as Fletchinder and Slowking, are greatly appreciated. Fighting-types such as Medicham and Hitmonlee appreciate the pressure Absol puts on Psychic-types. Most late-game cleaners can take advantage of the holes Absol can punch through the opposing team.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Absol's already great Attack stat to sky-high levels. Knock Off is a powerful STAB move that gets rid of a foe's item. Sucker Punch mitigates Absol's underwhelming Speed while also providing it with a way to avoid being revenge killed. Superpower allows Absol to get past Mega Steelix. Other options for coverage include Play Rough for Fighting-types and Iron Tail for Fairy-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature with maximum Attack and Speed EVs make Absol as fast and powerful as possible. Alternatively, a Jolly nature can be run in order to Speed tie with Adamant Hitmonlee, potentially allowing Absol to hit it with Sucker Punch. Life Orb boosts the power of Absol's moves, but Dread Plate can be used in order to slightly increase Absol's longevity at the cost of only increasing the power of its Dark-type attacks. Lum Berry can provide Absol with more opportunities to set up at the cost of power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As its poor bulk means it will be difficult to find opportunities to set up throughout the match, Absol should only attempt to do so once all of its checks and counters are gone or significantly weakened. Absol's best method of getting setup opportunities is by forcing out switches from Pokemon that fear getting hit by its powerful STAB Knock Off.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock support helps immensely, as it allows Absol to achieve some otherwise unachievable KOs such as the OHKO on Alomomola with Knock Off after a Swords Dance boost. Mega Steelix stands out, as it can also help check Fairy-types for Absol. Fighting-types should be taken care of before Absol attempts to set up, so Pokemon that can deal with them such as Fletchinder and Slowking are great partners. Wallbreakers that can pave the way for Absol to sweep and cleave through the likes of Alomomola and Tangrowth, which can burn Absol or KO it, are appreciated; these include Exploud and Meloetta. Venusaur can check Fighting- and Fairy-types for Absol while also providing support with Sleep Powder.</p>"

  "Glalie": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Glalie gains an amazing ability in Refrigerate and high offensive stats when it Mega Evolves, becoming a potent wallbreaker that's able to destroy defensive cores, as well as a great Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed the likes of Meloetta and Sigilyph. Mega Glalie also offers utility with Spikes, which means that it even if it may be walled, it will not be useless. Furthermore, Mega Glalie has access to a very important priority move in Ice Shard, which allows it to revenge kill many important threats in RU such as Flygon and Virizion. Unfortunately, Mega Glalie's horrid defensive typing and average defensive stats leave it weak to common Fire- and Steel-types such as Emboar and Escavalier. In addition, Mega Glalie is extremely easy to wear down due to its vulnerability to entry hazards and the recoil damage that it inflicts on itself with Double-Edge. Mega Glalie's mediocre Speed tier before it Mega Evolves also means that it has a very difficult time switching in safely.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt can be used to prevent Defog users from removing Mega Glalie's Spikes. Super Fang is an alternative for Mega Glalie to wear down its usual checks and counters such as Bronzong and Escavalier by cutting their HP in half. Facade can also be used to prevent Mega Glalie from being as hindered by burns. Toxic is an option to cripple bulky Water-types such as Alomomola and Jellicent that Mega Glalie lures in. Body Slam can be used to have a chance to paralyze Pokemon that like to switch into Mega Glalie such as Emboar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types Neutral to Ground</strong>: Steel-types that are neutral or immune to Ground, such as Escavalier and Bronzong, are able to take any hit from Mega Glalie with ease and proceed to KO it with their STAB attacks. While Steelix does not reliably beat Mega Glalie one-on-one, as Heavy Slam is only a 3HKO, it can still tank Mega Glalie's Earthquake and Double-Edge with relative ease.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: If Mega Glalie does not pack Freeze-Dry, bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Alomomola completely wall it and can proceed to aim for a burn with Scald. Slowking takes very little damage from Freeze-Dry and can heavily damage Mega Glalie in return. Qwilfish does not like Earthquake, but it can survive one and proceed to paralyze Mega Glalie with Thunder Wave and set up its own entry hazards. Cofagrigus can take a hit from Mega Glalie and remove Refrigerate thanks to Mummy, rendering Mega Glalie useless on the battlefield.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Emboar and Hitmonlee are able to easily OHKO Mega Glalie with their STAB attacks. Pokemon that naturally outspeed Mega Glalie such as Delphox and Sneasel are also able to dent it with Fire Blast and Low Kick, respectively. Mach Punch users such as Gurdurr and Hitmonlee are able to pick off a weakened Mega Glalie.</p>",

      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Double-Edge is an extremely powerful STAB move when boosted by Refrigerate, being able to dent many Pokemon that do not resist Ice. Return can be used for a safer STAB move if the recoil from Double-Edge is unfavorable, but it is significantly weaker, notably failing to 2HKO Aromatisse. Ice Shard allows Glalie to pick off Flygon and somewhat compensate for its above-average Speed by taking out weakened Virizion, and Chlorophyll Venusaur. Freeze-Dry is used for Mega Glalie to hit bulky Water-types such as Alomomola, Slowking, Blastoise, and Qwilfish that would otherwise be able to wall and severely weaken Mega Glalie. Spikes is used to capitalize on the switches that Mega Glalie forces by using the few Pokemon that can stomach its attacks as Spikes bait; in addition, Glalie makes a proficient Spikes user in general thanks to its ability to pulverize the premier hazard removers in the tier, Flygon and Blastoise. Earthquake has great complementary coverage, being able to smash Steel- and Fire-types such as Registeel and Emboar that can take Mega Glalie's STAB attacks with ease. Ice Shard turns Mega Glalie into a great revenge killer, being able to take out Flygon and pick off weakened Pokemon. Explosion is an alternative in the last slot to heavily damage a Pokemon after Mega Glalie has done its job.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Glalitite is used to Mega Evolve Glalie. Maximum Speed investment with a Speed-boosting nature ensures that Mega Glalie outspeeds Sigilyph, Houndoom, and Meloetta when it Mega Evolves and Speed ties with Gallade before it Mega Evolves. Maximum Attack investment is used for maximum damage output. If a Naive nature is chosen, the 4 Defense EVs can be moved to Special Attack to slightly boost Freeze-Dry's power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Glalie should typically be used on offensively inclined teams, and it appreciates getting a safe switch-in via U-turn, Volt Switch, or double switches. Players can try to predict Fire-type switch-ins by nailing them with Earthquake, though Mega Glalie should be clicking Double-Edge or Return most of the time due to its nature as a wallbreaker. When facing Pokemon such as Flygon, try to predict them switching out and either set up Spikes or switch out to another Pokemon. If running Explosion, it should be used if Mega Glalie is not needed anymore and can also be used to block Defog.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard control, though not mandatory, is nice to have. Flygon and Hitmonlee are able to remove entry hazards with Defog and Rapid Spin, respectively, and have great offensive synergy with Mega Glalie. Late-game cleaners such as Delphox and Scrafty appreciate Mega Glalie's wallbreaking so that they can sweep more easily. Pokemon that can deal with Fire-types with ease such as Flygon and Rhyperior work well with Mega Glalie, and they also benefit from Mega Glalie's ability to weaken bulky Water- and Grass-types for them. Steel-types such as Bronzong annoy Mega Glalie, so it appreciates Pokemon that can take them on such as Emboar, Seismitoad, and Fletchinder. If Mega Glalie does not run Freeze-Dry, bulky Water-types can give it trouble, making Electric- and Grass-types such as Jolteon and Virizion ideal partners in this case.</p>"

  "Registeel": {
    "overview": "<p>Registeel acts as an important wall in RU thanks to its excellent mono-Steel typing and amazing 80 / 150 / 150 bulk, allowing it to wall threats that present problems to stall and balance teams like Exploud, Meloetta, Mega Glalie, Abomasnow, Venusaur, and Fletchinder. It also boasts a solid support movepool, including Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, and Toxic. However, Registeel suffers from weaknesses to common types in Ground, Fire, and Fighting and has horrible offensive presence, needing to rely on Toxic and Seismic Toss to do damage. This allows Pokemon like Flygon, Flame Orb Sigilyph, and Emboar to come in on Registeel with relative ease and start firing off attacks or set up or remove entry hazards. Finally, Registeel's low offensive presence makes it bait for status-resilient setup sweepers such as Virizion, and Pokemon that can make 101 HP Substitutes, like Braviary and Meloetta.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Curse set using Rest for recovery can be used as a bulky wincon on stall-oriented teams, but Registeel's pitiful offensive presence, its overreliance on Rest for recovery, and the prevalence of Flygon and other Ground-types in the tier make this difficult to pull off. Block can be used over Stealth Rock to trap Pokemon weak to Toxic, but this strategy is unreliable due to most Pokemon that lose to Registeel simply switching out in the first place. If Block is run, such a set needs to run Protect alongside it. A set of Thunder Wave, Toxic, Protect, and Seismic Toss can be used if Registeel's team already has a Stealth Rock user. A physically defensive spread can be used to take on a different pool of threats, but such a set is largely outclassed by Steelix and is overall less effective than a specially defensive one. Counter can be used to take advantage of physical attackers targeting Registeel, but this strategy requires Registeel to take a large amount of damage. Finally, Earthquake can be used to target Jolteon, Manectric, and Magneton but has little use outside of that.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types are immune to Thunder Wave and can target Registeel with their super effective STAB moves. Flygon, Mega Camerupt, and Rhyperior can quickly defeat Registeel, giving them opportunities to grab momentum, stack or remove entry hazards, or smash a switch-in hard. Steelix gets a special mention, as it is also immune to Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Despite Medicham, Sawk, and Hitmonlee being bothered by Protect and crippled by Thunder Wave, most Fighting-types, especially those resilient to status, can make short work of Registeel with their STAB moves. Virizion, while not threatening an OHKO, can still easily set up on Registeel due to commonly holding Lum Berry and can become very threatening to Registeel's entire team. Scrafty can usually set up on Registeel due to Shed Skin removing status.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types can threaten Registeel with their STAB attacks. Delphox, Houndoom, and Emboar all easily 2HKO Registeel, while Mega Camerupt can do the same and has an immunity to Thunder Wave, which the former three all despise.</p> <p><strong>Status-immune Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that can Taunt or set up a Substitute against Registeel can easily muscle past it due to its heavy reliance on Thunder Wave and Toxic. Taunt Jellicent can take advantage of Registeel's passivity and wear it down with Scald or Hex. Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary and Substitute + Calm Mind Meloetta can make 101 HP Substitutes, making it impossible for Registeel to break them with one Seismic Toss, leaving it as setup bait. Sigilyph can muscle past Registeel if it lacks Thunder Wave or if Sigilyph is holding Flame Orb.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Seismic Toss, while weak, is a consistent form of damage output that can chip away at switch-ins, such as Steelix. Iron Head can be used over Seismic Toss to target Hoopa and keep it from setting up a Substitute on Registeel and can also be used to attempt to paraflinch foes in conjunction with Thunder Wave. Stealth Rock can chip at foes as well as break Focus Sashes and Sturdy. Toxic is useful for whittling down Pokemon that aren't vulnerable to Seismic Toss, like Flygon, Fletchinder, and Alomomola. Protect is used for scouting what move Choice-locked Pokemon are using or for dangerous coverage moves, stalling for Toxic damage and Leftovers recovery, and potentially blocking High Jump Kick from Hitmonlee and Medicham. Thunderbolt allows Registeel to beat Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary. Thunder Wave can be used to slow down faster threats like Delphox, Hoopa, and Mega Glalie. Thunder Wave is especially important to allow Registeel to outlast Venusaur and Sigilyph.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A specially defensive spread with a Calm nature allows Registeel to take on as many attackers as possible. If Iron Head is run, a Careful nature should be run instead. Leftovers is mandatory on Registeel, as it has no form of reliable recovery. 24 Special Attack EVs allows Registeel to break Bulk Up Braviary's Substitute so that Registeel can hit it with Toxic.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Registeel can be used to set up Stealth Rock early in the game. Registeel should be switched into Pokemon that it can wall, such as Venusaur, Exploud, Fletchling, and Choice Specs Meloetta. Be careful when switching in on Exploud and Meloetta, however, as Registeel can be 2HKOed by the appropriate coverage move. Once Registeel gets in against a Pokemon that can do little to it, it can spread status throughout the opposing team. Although certain Pokemon are unable to 2HKO Registeel, it's good to not let it take on foes that can do significant damage to it, as Registeel can be easily whittled down by attacks. If the opponent lacks status-immune Pokemon, don't hesitate to spam Toxic or Thunder Wave. One should be careful, however, to inflict a convenient condition on the foe, such as Toxic on Alomomola, Slowking, and Fletchinder or paralysis on Sigilyph. Inflicting the wrong condition can make it hard for Registeel to adequately take on that Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Alomomola is easily one of the best partners for Registeel, patching up Registeel's lack of recovery by passing it massive Wishes. Registeel and Alomomola also have solid defensive synergy, since Alomomola is able to take on Fire- and Ground-types for Registeel while Registeel can handle Exploud and Venusaur for Alomomola. Fighting-type switch-ins, like Granbull, Aromatisse, and Garbodor, can take on Hitmonlee and Sawk well. Diancie, Aromatisse, Togetic, and Granbull can supply cleric support to allow Registeel to take on weak Scald users without serious fear of a burn. All of these Fairy-types have very good defensive synergy with Registeel, as Registeel can easily take Steel- and Poison-type moves for them, while they can take on Fighting-types for Registeel. Users of Haze and Clear Smog, like Garbodor and Weezing, can check Fighting-types and take on the setup sweepers that can use Registeel as bait, like Virizion.</p>"
      },
      "Curse": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Curse boosts Registeel's Attack and Defense, gradually making it stronger while also making it quite physically tanky, allowing it to take attacks like Flygon's Earthquake much better after a couple of boosts. Iron Head is Registeel's most reliable STAB move and helps it beat Fairy-types more safely while also becoming decently powerful after Curse boosts. Rest heals all of Registeel's health and rids it of pesky status effects, helping it stick around longer for a sweep. Sleep Talk makes Registeel much less passive while asleep, granting it a chance to nab a Curse boost or attack with Iron Head. Toxic is an option over Sleep Talk, as it helps Registeel in the matchup against other bulky setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Slowking, prevents Alomomola from PP stalling Iron Head, and cripples several other checks like Mega Camerupt and Emboar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A specially defensive EV spread with a Careful nature allows Registeel to take on as many special attackers as possible, including Venusaur and Exploud. Leftovers is used to give Registeel some passive recovery so it is not forced to use Rest as often.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Registeel set, while primarily acting as a bulky wincon, can still work as a defensive pivot early-game by switching into the Pokemon that it walls, like Venusaur. Registeel can even take advantage of Sleep Powder Venusaur by using Sleep Talk to potentially set up Curse on it. This set usually finds itself on defensive teams due to Registeel checking many Pokemon that can threaten these types of teams, like Venusaur and offensive Diancie, while also acting as a wincon. Registeel can set up Curses on the Pokemon it checks, like Meloetta, and on weaker attacks, like Blastoise's Scald. However, even at +6 Attack, Registeel is still relatively passive against Pokemon that resist Iron Head. It is best to set up Curses and attempt to sweep mid- to late-game when Registeel's checks and counters have been weakened or taken out. However, Registeel can use Curse to apply pressure in the earlier stages of the battle by taking physical hits better and having more offensive power with Iron Head.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Alomomola is a great partner to this set, as it checks many of the Pokemon that can threaten Registeel, like Emboar and Rhyperior, and can pass Wishes to Registeel so it doesn't have to use Rest as often, while Registeel can take on special wallbreakers like Venusaur for Alomomola. Entry hazard removers such as Hitmontop and Blastoise can help take on Fire-, Steel-, and Ground-types for Registeel while also removing Spikes, which can wear Registeel down quickly. Flygon is a great partner for Registeel, as it resists Fire-type moves and has an immunity to Ground-type moves while also removing entry hazards with Defog. Fighting-type switch-ins, such as Aromatisse and Weezing, can take on Pokemon like Sawk, which are big threats to Registeel. Uxie is an example of a good Fighting-resistant teammate and also possesses a Ground-type immunity and can set up entry hazards for Registeel. Cleric support from Pokemon like Granbull and Aromatisse helps with Registeel's overreliance on Rest so it isn't as passive early-game.</p>"

  "Torterra": {
    "overview": "<p>Torterra is valued in RU primarily for its ability to break through common balance cores, such as Registeel + Alomomola, with its high-power STAB moves in conjunction with Swords Dance. Torterra is also a decent Volt Switch stop due to its Ground typing, but it has to be wary of switching into Hidden Power Ice, a common coverage move among Electric-types. Additionally, its above average bulk provides Torterra with several opportunities to set up Swords Dances throughout the match. Torterra's typing also makes it a strong check to various Ground-types such as Rhyperior and Flygon. Compared to Virizion, another Swords Dance balance breaker, Torterra's Wood hammer is significantly stronger than the former's Leaf Blade. However, Torterra is weak to U-turn, which prevents it from being a consistent VoltTurn answer. Torterra is also unfortunately very susceptible to Ice-type attacks, which makes it easy to lure. Additionally, its mediocre Speed tier means that it often has to take a hit before firing off one of its powerful STAB moves. While its STAB move combination is effective at pressuring premier balance cores, Torterra can't pressure Flying-types well, as they resist Wood Hammer and are immune to Earthquake. Its lack of a resistance to Water and vulnerability to Scald burns really hurts Torterra as an offensive Grass-type as well; it renders it unable to switch into offensive Water-types as well as it can switch into defensive ones such as Alomomola.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Band is a potentially useful item because of the more immediate power it gives Torterra; it also gives it the ability to hit Flying-type Pokemon with Stone Edge. However, being locked into one move can make it extremely difficult to break the Registeel + Alomomola core, which relies on Protect. Additionally, a bulky Stealth Rock set can be used because it sets up Stealth Rock on a common Rapid Spin user in Blastoise, but there are generally many better options for this in the tier. Torterra also doesn't have very much power if it does not boost its attack with Swords Dance. Lastly, Lum Berry can be used on teams without a Heal Bell user to set up on Alomomola more consistently, but the extra longevity from Leftovers is usually appreciated more in the long run.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: The two main Ice-types in the RU tier, Mega Glalie and Sneasel, outspeed Torterra and OHKO it with their Ice-type STAB moves, but they cannot switch into Torterra very well. Other Pokemon with Ice-type coverage moves can usually KO Torterra as well.</p> <p><strong>Weezing</strong>: Weezing resists Wood Hammer and has Levitate along with a really good Defense stat, making it a solid counter. It can also cripple Torterra with Will-O-Wisp, ensuring that Torterra cannot break through the Pokemon that it's supposed to.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Sigilyph and Braviary resist Wood Hammer and are immune to Earthquake; they can also threaten Torterra with super effective Flying-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Bronzong</strong>: Bronzong's resistance to both of Torterra's STAB moves coupled with its impressive bulk allows it to be a consistent Torterra counter. It can even Toxic Torterra to wear it down.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wood Hammer is a powerful STAB move that beats Water- and Ground-types with the unfortunate side effect of dealing recoil damage. Similarly, Earthquake is a more reliable STAB move that hits Steel- and Electric-types without the nasty recoil effect of Wood Hammer. Swords Dance allows Torterra to set up on Pokemon such as Alomomola and Registeel, allowing it to dismantle common bulky teams and apply pressure to more offensive ones. Lastly, Synthesis allows Torterra to reliably check certain threats and remain healthy throughout the match, allowing it to set up on a wider variety of Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Foremost, maximum HP EVs coupled with 180 Special Defense EVs ensure that Torterra avoids the 2HKO from Choice Specs Magneton's Flash Cannon after Leftovers recovery. Additionally, the Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Alomomola, allowing Torterra to Swords Dance before Alomomola can attempt to burn it. Lastly, Leftovers is the best item for this set, as it gives Torterra extra longevity and provides it with passive healing to somewhat mitigate Wood Hammer recoil. Additionally, an EV spread of 252 HP / 24 Atk / 156 SpD / 76 Spe can be used with an Adamant nature to guarantee the OHKO on Registeel after a Swords Dance. However, you have to be more careful when switching into Magneton because Torterra cannot take an Analytic-boosted Flash Cannon followed by a normal Flash Cannon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>First, always try to bring in Torterra on defensive Pokemon such as Diancie and Registeel that can't really threaten it. Also, be cautious when switching into Electric-types, since many run Hidden Power Ice; Magneton also does a large amount of damage to Torterra with Flash Cannon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Torterra is traditionally featured on slow, bulky offensive teams that rely on a solid defensive backbone to function effectively. Torterra has a crippling weakness to Ice-type Pokemon and coverage moves, so Pokemon that resist Ice such as Jellicent, Houndoom, and Slowking make excellent teammates. Torterra struggles to break past Flying-types, so offensive Pokemon that can beat them, such as Jolteon, Sneasel, and Mega Glalie, are helpful team members for this role. As a wallbreaker, Torterra appreciates VoltTurn users that can get it in for free against Pokemon that it enjoys setting up on. A perfect example of this is Flygon, which lures in Alomomola and can allow you to bring in Torterra for free. Uxie is another useful U-turn user that can get Torterra in with slow U-turns. Uxie can also set up Stealth Rock to wear down Torterra's checks. Mesprit another is more offensively oriented than Uxie, but it can give Torterra a second chance at a sweep with Healing Wish. Magneton is a particularly helpful partner, as it resists Ice-type attacks and can also break past Flying-types fairly easily while providing Volt Switch support. Lastly, Heal Bell users such as Diancie and Mega Audino are good partners for Torterra because Torterra can often get burned from switching into defensive Water-types. It also despises Toxic from defensive Pokemon, especially since Torterra is usually featured on slower bulky offense teams.</p>"

It has a fantastic ability in Storm Drain, giving it an immunity to Water-type moves and a Special Attack boost if hit by one. It also has access to Recover, which allows it to stay healthy throughout the match. However, Gastrodon is extremely slow and is very vulnerable to status.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An offensive set can also be used, but it is generally outclassed by other Water-types such as Clawitzer. Yawn can be a nice choice to force switches, though Toxic has more utility. Memento can also be used, but Gastrodon is too slow to utilize this effectively. Stockpile can be used to make Gastrodon really bulky, but it is redundant and Gastrodon is still KOed by Grass-type moves. Lastly, Mirror Coat and Counter can be used to surprise special and physical attackers, respectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Because Gastrodon is 4x weak to Grass-type attacks, Grass-types such as Sceptile and Virizion can easily KO Gastrodon with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status such as poison or burn wears down Gastrodon very easily, as it has no way of curing it.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Aromatisse and Lickilicky take pitiful damage from Gastrodon's moves and can Wish pass or cure status with Aromatherapy and Heal Bell, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Strong special attackers such as Meloetta and Delphox can take advantage of Gastrodon's uninvested special bulk and KO with their powerful attacks.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is the STAB move of choice, and its high chance to burn allows Gastrodon to handle many physical attackers. Recover lets Gastrodon heal the HP lost from entry hazards or status such as poison or burn and improves its longevity. The third move is a toss up. Toxic is the preferred choice, putting a timer on deadly walls and sweepers. Clear Smog allows Gastrodon to check many setup sweepers in the tier such as Calm Mind Delphox, Swords Dance Drapion, and Nasty Plot Cofagrigus. Ice Beam, however, lets Gastrodon hit Grass-types such as Rotom-C and Virizion super effectively. Earth Power is the secondary STAB move of choice, as its power can be boosted thanks to Storm Drain.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread with a Bold nature aims to maximize Gastrodon's physical bulk, allowing it to take on the majority of physical attackers in the tier, as well as allowing it to outspeed minimum Speed Rhyperior so it can KO with Scald or Recover before it attacks. Leftovers gives Gastrodon passive recovery and can help it stall out poisoned or burned foes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Do not stay in Grass-types, because they will usually OHKO Gastrodon. Try not to get Gastrodon inflicted with status, such as poison and burn, as it has no way of curing it. Predict well, as Gastrodon is extremely slow, and it will usually move last. In addition, switch into Water-type moves to get the Storm Drain boost. Use Toxic often to cripple opponents. Likewise, use Scald often to cripple the physical attackers in the tier. Also switch into Pokemon that Gastrodon can check or counter such as Magneton, Drapion, and Jolteon lacking Hidden Power Grass. Bear in mind that Gastrodon is somewhat weak and will be dealing only decent damage at best.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gastrodon fits easily onto stall and defensive teams, and because of this, bulky Grass-types such as defensive Venusaur and Roselia make excellent partners, taking the Grass-types aimed at Gastrodon. In return, Gastrodon can switch in on the Fire-type moves directed at them. Since Gastrodon is uninvested in Special Defense, specially defensive Pokemon such as Aromatisse and Mega Audino make excellent partners. Both of them can Wish pass, and they can also remove status that troubles Gastrodon with Aromatherapy and Heal Bell, respectively.</p>"

  "Ambipom": {
    "overview": "<p>To be frank, Ambipom is not a great Pokemon: Technician STAB Fake Out just isn't a good enough niche. Ambipom faces stiff competition from a lot of other Normal-types, including Cinccino, Tauros, and Zangoose, which boast more effective coverage and/or greater power. While Ambipom is fast, it has poor bulk and no resistances, so it must rely heavily on dealing damage while taking none in return. However, this is not easy, as Ambipom usually struggles to KO foes due to its mediocre power and its reliance on neutral coverage over super effective damage. While it can do some damage to offensive teams, it can hardly contribute against bulkier teams, while its Normal-type brethren can at least threaten both team archetypes. Ambipom is very outclassed, and other options should always be considered first.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ambipom can use the Fake Out + Last Resort combo, but its mono-coverage makes it easy to wall, Last Resort has low PP, and the fact that it must use Fake Out every time it enters battle can allow opponents to easily play around it. Ambipom has Nasty Plot, but it is too frail to set it up safely a vast majority of the time, and it is far too weak without or sometimes even with the boost. Ambipom does have a large amount of physical coverage options, though they are very situational over the main ones listed: Seed Bomb hits Rhyperior, Fire Punch hits Escavalier, and Ice Punch hits Flygon, but Ambipom hesitates to get rid of its main moves and risk leaving itself open to even more threats.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Anything that can take a hit or two from Ambipom already makes for an adequate response, especially when considering Ambipom lacks good power. Anything that has at least decent physical bulk, such as Alomomola, Spiritomb, Bronzong, and Rhyperior, can switch into Ambipom and stop it from doing much damage. Attackers with natural physical bulk, such as Druddigon and Escavalier, can survive Ambipom's attacks and easily retaliate for huge damage. Normal-resistant or immune Pokemon are especially good at stopping Ambipom.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: There aren't a lot of Pokemon faster than Ambipom, but the ones that are can easily threaten Ambipom due to its terrible bulk, though they should be wary of Fake Out if they lack Substitute. Swellow, Jolteon, and Accelgor are such examples of faster Pokemon, threatening Ambipom with powerful STAB or super effective Fighting-type attacks. Kabutops is notable, as it resists Fake Out and makes use of Weak Armor to outspeed and KO Ambipom. Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Emboar, Rotom-C, Gallade, and Delphox, can easily KO Ambipom with their STAB moves. Speed boosting Pokemon such as Unburden Hitmonlee can also get the drop on Ambipom.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority attacks bypass Ambipom's high Speed, greatly shortening its overall lifespan. Powerful STAB priority such as Sucker Punch, Gale Wings Acrobatics, Aqua Jet, and Mach Punch cleave off a huge portion of Ambipom's health. It should be noted that Fake Out outprioritizes all of these moves, so note if Ambipom can use it.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Paralysis and burn absolutely ruin Ambipom by crippling its best stats, Speed and Attack, respectively. Poison, alongside Life Orb recoil, drastically reduces Ambipom's time on the field. Bulky status users such as Alomomola, Registeel, and Cofagrigus can also tank Ambipom's attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "DON'T USE AMBIPOM": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fake Out is Ambipom's main niche, scoring free, powerful damage on the foe due to STAB and Technician. However, it very easily telegraphs Ambipom's attack, and the overwhelming presence of Pokemon such as Alomomola and Rhyperior means that Ambipom will often be nothing more than a free switch to a top threat. Return is Ambipom's most reliable attack and main way of dealing damage. Low Kick trips up Pokemon that resist Normal-type moves such as Registeel and Rhyperior, and it can do serious damage due to their high weights. Knock Off strikes Ghost-types while also removing the items of defensive Pokemon to soften them up and make them easier to KO. U-turn can be used to gain momentum on foes wanting to escape from Fake Out, while Pursuit targets the fleeing foes themselves and is especially effective on Dark-weak targets such as Delphox and Meloetta. Double Hit can be used to break Substitutes, but its chance to miss makes it unappealing for such a frail Pokemon that already has access to a much more accurate attacking option with similar power in Return, and Cinccino does this better anyway.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment allows Ambipom to outrun speedy Pokemon such as Delphox and Virizion, while max Attack investment maximizes Ambipom's damage output. The rest of the EVs go into either defensive stat, preferably Defense to take priority moves better, because Ambipom's current HP is an optimal Life Orb number, so it would be a waste to throw the leftover EVs in HP. Silk Scarf is a perfectly viable alternative to Life Orb, as Silk Scarf does not cause recoil and still boosts Ambipom's main attacks, although its coverage moves will be substantially weaker.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ambipom is a very straightforward attacker. It checks frail sweepers that lack Protect with its powerful Fake Out regardless of their Speed. From there, Ambipom dishes out quick, reliable damage, with few foes outright resisting its attacks. Although Fake Out is usually quite safe to throw out, it is advisable to only use it if an opponent is certain to stay in, as the threat of a strong Fake Out can easily force out most frail attackers, and nailing the switch-in with the appropriate coverage move can be more practical. Ambipom can struggle to safely revenge kill Pokemon that are behind a Substitute, such as Meloetta, as they can dodge Fake Out's flinching effect. Ambipom also shouldn't switch into non-Ghost-type attack, as it thrives on revenge killing, or if it must be switched in it should at least be brought into battle via slow U-turns or Volt Switches.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Ambipom forces switches so easily, entry hazards support is really useful to discourage switch-ins as well as soften up Ambipom's counters. Qwilfish makes for an amazing teammate, since it easily takes Fighting-type moves for Ambipom and lays down Spikes, which is effective because the majority of Ambipom's switch-in are grounded; Accelgor is also an effective user of Spikes for more offensive teams. On the other hand, Fighting-resistant teammates with Toxic Spikes, such as Qwilfish, Cofagrigus, and Weezing, are more plentiful. Toxic Spikes are potent against Regenerator users but they do not work against Steel-types and airborne Pokemon. Ambipom struggles against physically bulky Pokemon, so wallbreakers such as Clawitzer, Eelektross, and Calm Mind Delphox can help Ambipom clean without much hindrance by dismantling the opponent's defensive cores. Fighting-types such as Virizion and Hitmonlee can take out the Rock- and Steel-types that Ambipom cannot break through, while Ambipom can lure out problematic Ghost-types and weaken them with Knock Off. While not essential, slow Volt Switch or U-turn users can help bring Ambipom in safely; Clawitzer, Eelektross, and Magneton can all provide this support, and pack enough power and/or coverage to threaten bulkier foes that Ambipom cannot take down.</p>"

  "Bronzong": {
    "overview": "<p>Numerous helpful and unique resistances and two immunities give Bronzong the unique ability to hard check several relevant threats such as Abomasnow and Venusaur in one slot. It has numerous forms of utility, as access to Stealth Rock and the ability to wall every Defog user in the tier make it one of the most reliable setters in RU, and its extremely low Speed and access to Trick Room and Gyro Ball make it an ideal Trick Room setter and attacker. However, while Bronzong is a good glue Pokemon that handles several common threats, it cannot be counted on as a reliable catch-all check without cleric support, as it is easily worn down due to its total lack of recovery and offensive presence as well as a crippling weakness to the ubiquitous Knock Off and Pursuit. In addition, poor Speed and mediocre offensive stats make it setup bait for a number of threats, and it faces competition as a bulky Steel-type from Registeel due to inferior bulk and lack of access to Seismic Toss and Thunder Wave.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Colbur Berry can be equipped over Leftovers to give Bronzong a leg up on Dark-types if it's not weakened, although this removes its only form of recovery. Bronzong can also be used as a suicide screens lead with a moveset of Reflect / Light Screen / Earthquake / Explosion. Stealth Rock can also be used over Earthquake to maximize utility. Bronzong has the bulk and typing ideal for a setter for rain teams, although it faces considerable competition from Uxie due to this Pokemon's access to Thunder Wave as well as momentum moves such as U-turn and Memento. Hypnosis can cripple opposing switch-ins, preventing them from setting up and freeing up turns for teammates to do so. Grass Knot is an option that 2HKOes Rhyperior and Seismitoad; however, its damage output is pitiful against foes that do not take 4x super effective damage. Using Trick with a Toxic Orb or an Iron Ball can surprise and cripple offensive and defensive Pokemon alike. Psywave allows Bronzong to put out semi-consistent damage on Pokemon that it normally could not touch, such as opposing Bronzong.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Absol, Spiritomb, and other Dark-types seriously threaten Bronzong with their STAB attacks and are capable of Pursuit trapping it, virtually guaranteeing a KO if they manage to come in for free on an even slightly weakened Bronzong.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Although they must be wary of switching directly into Bronzong due to Earthquake, every Fire-type in the tier outspeeds Bronzong and deals it massive damage. Fire-type coverage, particularly from Pokemon such as Flygon and Druddigon that Bronzong typically switches into, is also problematic.</p> <p><strong>Burn</strong>: Although Bronzong is immune to Toxic and not particularly bothered by paralysis, a burn from Scald or a Will-O-Wisp from Ghost-types such as Cofagrigus will seriously hinder its defensive capabilities and make its attacks even less threatening.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt prevents Bronzong from setting Stealth Rock or Trick Room, which prevents it from supporting its team, and using Toxic, which makes it easy setup bait for bulky sweepers. Jellicent is an extremely threatening Pokemon that often carries Taunt and also has Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Levitate Users</strong>: Rotom and Weezing in particular completely wall Bronzong, as both take minimal damage from Gyro Ball, can burn Bronzong with Will-O-Wisp, and can easily avoid Toxic (the former with Substitute, the latter with an immunity).</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Offensive teams will often not have a hard time wearing Bronzong down, even with Pokemon it's supposed to check such as Registeel, because it fails to threaten back anything that it cannot hit for good damage with Gyro Ball and cannot recover. Furthermore, Knock Off is not uncommon on certain Pokemon such as Venusaur that it normally switches into, and even if it does not do a massive amount of damage, it removes Bronzong's only form of recovery.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock allows Bronzong to support its teammates by racking up chip damage and weakening their checks and counters. Gyro Ball, backed by Bronzong's extremely low Speed, deals serious damage to many offensive threats and setup sweepers. Earthquake hits the Fire-, Electric-, and Steel-types that resist Gyro Ball super effectively as well as gaining neutral coverage on Water-types. Toxic prevents Bronzong from being setup bait for bulky sweepers such as Slowking. If you have another Stealth Rock setter, Protect can be run in the first slot, enabling Bronzong to scout and stall for Toxic damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers constitutes Bronzong's sole form of recovery, while Levitate grants Bronzong a vital immunity to Ground-type attacks, nullifying one of its weaknesses. Near maximum investment in Special Defense along with a Sassy nature allows Bronzong to more comfortably check threatening special attackers such as Venusaur and Magneton. 0 Speed IVs and a Sassy nature maximize Gyro Ball's damage output, keeping Bronzong from being overly passive. The Defense EVs allow it to avoid the 3HKO from Choice Band Flygon's Outrage and Mega Glalie's Double-Edge after Stealth Rock. In addition, the EV spread enables it to survive Life Orb Sneasel's Knock Off from full, allowing it to trade a one-for-one if necessary.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bronzong can pivot into resisted attacks liberally due to its immunity to Spikes and Toxic and resistance to Stealth Rock; however, be wary of switching it into even relatively weak neutral attacks, as it can get worn down quickly. Although special bulk is preferable for Bronzong's typing, the fact that it is one of the rare Pokemon that resist the vaunted EdgeQuake combination makes it a stellar check for dangerous physical threats such as Aerodactyl. The numerous switches Bronzong forces and the fact that it walls every Defogger in the tier bar Fire Blast or Fire Punch Flygon allow it to set up Stealth Rock multiple times throughout a match. Take care to avoid Taunt, which renders Bronzong useless against certain foes because it is unable to use Toxic, and burn, which will wear it down very quickly and make its attacks pitifully weak. Also be wary of opposing Pursuit trappers, which can prevent Bronzong from setting up Stealth Rock repeatedly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Alomomola and Aromatisse, whose typings synergize well with Bronzong's, can also relieve Bronzong's lack of recovery with Wish support. Grass-types such as Virizion appreciate Bronzong's ability to deal with Flying-types and can switch into bulky Water-types that wall it and threaten it with a Scald burn, including Blastoise, the main entry hazard remover that Bronzong loses to. Togetic, Granbull, Diancie, and other Fairy-types are vital as ways of handling Dark-types that would try to Pursuit trap Bronzong. These three can also provide Heal Bell support, which is helpful for keeping Bronzong healthy, and Diancie can free up a slot for Bronzong to run Protect by running Stealth Rock itself. Spiritomb makes for an excellent partner as well—the combination of Taunt and spinblocking ability enables it to prevent opponents from removing Bronzong's Stealth Rock, and Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers that Bronzong struggles to switch into. Emboar is capable of checking all of Spiritomb, Absol, and Sneasel, which seriously threaten Bronzong. Qwilfish synergizes well with Bronzong, as it switches into the Fire- and Fighting-types that pressure Bronzong while appreciating Bronzong's ability to switch easily into Ground- and Psychic-type attacks.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room takes advantage of Bronzong's extremely low Speed, allowing it to punish offensive teams. Gyro Ball is incredibly powerful due to Bronzong's very low Speed and Macho Brace. Earthquake provides great coverage with Gyro Ball, hitting Fire-, Electric-, and Steel-types super effectively. Explosion allows Bronzong to deal massive damage to the opposition without killing momentum and prevent opposing hazard removal. If necessary, Stealth Rock can be run over Earthquake, although lack of Earthquake will worsen Bronzong's matchup against a large number of Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Macho Brace halves Bronzong's Speed, significantly increasing the power of Gyro Ball. A Brave nature and the given EVs maximize Bronzong's Attack and contribute to its bulk to maximize its offensive prowess while making it as slow as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should be primarily played as a powerful late-game sweeper, catching offensive teams off guard and smashing any foes of 186 Speed or greater with a STAB 150-Base Power attack. While Bronzong should be kept relatively healthy, it is still bulky enough to use its numerous resistances to switch into certain threats until the optimal time to set up Trick Room and sweep. Before you even attempt a sweep, any Sucker Punch users absolutely must be taken care of, as they can circumvent being slower in Trick Room, and common users of it such as Absol can OHKO Bronzong. Similarly, avoid setting up and revealing your set until Bronzong's hard counters, including other Bronzong, have been dispatched and the opposing team as a whole has been weakened.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slower attackers such as Emboar, Rhyperior, and Mega Camerupt are ideal partners for this set. Granbull in particular is very slow and has good type synergy with Bronzong. Alomomola enjoys excellent defensive synergy with Bronzong and can pass it Wishes to cover its total lack of recovery. Slowking and Diancie can serve well as secondary Trick Room setters due to their good defensive synergy with Bronzong, as the former sets up on Fire-types and the latter sets up on Fire- and Dark-types, including most Taunt users.</p>"

  "Spiritomb": {
    "overview": "<p>When compared to most Pokemon in the tier, Spiritomb is unique in that it possesses three immunities and a lone weakness to Fairy thanks to its Ghost / Dark typing, allowing to check a myriad of Pokemon, including Meloetta, Malamar, and Gallade. Its typing is further complemented by its decent natural bulk, allowing to remain a consistent answer to the Pokemon it checks. It has a relatively wide movepool as well, with support options such as Will-O-Wisp, Calm Mind, and Taunt, priority in the form of Sucker Punch, and access to Pursuit, allowing it to trap the Pokemon it forces out. In addition, Infiltrator allows Spiritomb's attacks to bypass Substitute, enabling it to revenge kill Pokemon behind one with Sucker Punch or cripple them with Will-O-Wisp. Spiritomb's access to Calm Mind also allows it to act a bulky setup sweeper for defensive teams, giving it a valuable niche. However, Spiritomb is hindered offensively due to its low Speed, causing it to rely heavily on Sucker Punch to deal meaningful damage and therefore leaving it to be easily exploited by threatening Pokemon such as Houndoom and Emboar. Furthermore, its lack of a strong Ghost-type STAB move means that its type coverage is limited to only Dark-type attacks. Defensively speaking, Spiritomb is hindered by a low HP stat and a lack of reliable recovery, making it fall short in effectiveness when compared to other defensive Pokemon in the tier such as Jellicent and Alomomola.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Destiny Bond + Custap Berry is another option to potentially net a KO before Spiritomb goes down. Protect can be used to scout for the opponent's next move and to stall Pokemon out when they are inflicted with burn or poison. Memento is an interesting support option that weakens the opponent's Pokemon, giving a teammate a free opportunity to set up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Houndoom</strong>: Houndoom is the biggest threat to Spiritomb, as it resists any move that Spiritomb has, gains a Flash Fire boost from Will-O-Wisp, and sets up Nasty Plot on Spiritomb freely.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Emboar and Camerupt are both immune to Will-O-Wisp and easily force Spiritomb out with their powerful Fire-type STAB moves. Emboar also resists Spiritomb's Dark-type attacks, allowing it to switch in freely and threaten it with Flare Blitz. Fletchinder is also notable in that it is immune to burn and avoids being hit by Sucker Punch thanks to priority Acrobatics.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Togetic, Mega Audino, and Aromatisse can all easily switch in and force out Spiritomb with their STAB moves. All of them are also able to heal damage taken with Roost or Wish, as well as heal off any status conditions with Heal Bell. Though the former two are shut down by Taunt, Aromatisse is immune to it thanks to Aroma Veil.</p> <p><strong>Exploud</strong>: Exploud hits Spiritomb very hard with Boomburst thanks to Scrappy, naturally outspeeds it, and does not mind being burned.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users that Resist Dark</strong>: Pokemon such as Drapion and Skuntank stop Spiritomb in its tracks by preventing it from setting up Calm Mind, healing with Rest, and spreading burns with Will-O-Wisp.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sucker Punch is a powerful priority move and is Spiritomb's most powerful physical Dark-type STAB attack. Unlike most users of the move, Spiritomb is not rendered useless by Substitute users thanks to Infiltrator. Pursuit allows Spiritomb to trap Pokemon such as Meloetta and Uxie, and the move pairs well with Sucker Punch, forcing the opponent into mind games. Taunt is a great move to prevent Pokemon from healing, spreading status, or setting up, and it also eases prediction when using Sucker Punch. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers such as Hitmonlee, Virizion, and Gallade and lands residual damage on Pokemon that check Spiritomb.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack EVs and an Adamant nature allow Spiritomb to hit as hard as possible. 44 Speed EVs are used to outspeed uninvested Rhyperior to either burn it before it attacks or Taunt it to prevent Stealth Rock from going up. The rest of the EVs go into HP to let Spiritomb take hits much better. Infiltrator lets Spiritomb burn Pokemon or pick off weakened Pokemon with Sucker Punch when they're behind a Substitute. Black Glasses increases the damage output of Spiritomb's Dark-type moves while letting it switch between its moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is to be played like a hit-and-run attacker that switches in to tank hits and threaten frail offensive Pokemon such as Gallade. Pursuit should be used when anticipating the foe to switch or if Spiritomb has switched into Meloetta locked into either Hyper Voice or Psychic to trap it. Sucker Punch is best used to pick off faster Pokemon, but be wary that a Pokemon can set up or cripple Spiritomb with status, and other Pokemon with priority such as Fletchinder, Mega Glalie, and Sneasel can bypass Sucker Punch. Taunt should be used to prevent Pokemon from setting up or from recovering HP from Spiritomb's attacks. It also works well with Sucker Punch to ease prediction against foes that are able to set up. Will-O-Wisp is great to cripple Pokemon such as Hitmonlee and Virizion, though if the opponent has Houndoom on their team, be cautious when using the move, as Houndoom can gain a Flash Fire boost from it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to Spiritomb's vulnerability to Fairy-types, Poison-types such as Drapion pair very well with it. Both Pokemon also appreciate Spiritomb's ability to cripple physical attackers including Flygon and Escavalier. Registeel is another good partner, as Spiritomb can cover its weakness to Fighting-types, while Registeel resists Fairy-type attacks and provides Stealth Rock support. Mega Camerupt pairs well, as it is able to switch in on problematic Pokemon for Spiritomb such as Houndoom. Pokemon vulnerable to Psychic-types appreciate Spiritomb's ability to switch in freely against them and trap them with Pursuit, so Virizion and Hitmonlee pair very well. Wish passers such as Aromatisse and Alomomola are very helpful because Spiritomb has no reliable recovery, and the former is able to heal status via Aromatherapy, while the latter is able to take on Emboar.</p>"

      "Mono-attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind raises Spiritomb's Special Attack and Special Defense, slowly making it more powerful and harder to take down with special attacks. Dark Pulse is the main STAB move because it has good neutral coverage and no immunities, unlike Shadow Ball. Snarl is an alternative STAB move that trades some power for the ability to lower the foe's Special Attack, easing setup against powerful special attackers. Rest is Spiritomb's only means of recovery and lets it restore its HP to full while ridding itself of status such as poison or burn, which would otherwise greatly hamper this set's functionality. Sleep Talk is needed to make sure Spiritomb is able to still make moves while its asleep, ensuring that it does not become setup fodder. Will-O-Wisp, on the other hand, cripples physical attackers such as Virizion and Hitmonlee at the cost of utilizing sleep turns.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense EVs are used to make Spiritomb as physically bulky as possible, as it will already be raising its Special Defense with Calm Mind. Leftovers is needed for consistent passive recovery, increasing Spiritomb's longevity and giving it a means of recovery while asleep. Infiltrator is used to hit through a Pokemon's Substitute. Due to the defensive nature of the set, Pressure is viable alternative to stall out low-PP attacks such as Fire Blast and Stone Edge.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Spiritomb plays the role of pivot that is able to set up Calm Mind on Pokemon that it walls, such as Meloetta. Pokemon that use phazing moves are problems for this set because they get rid of any Calm Mind boosts that Spiritomb has attained as well as forcing it to switch out when it's still asleep, so it's best not to set up Calm Mind and instead get chip damage with Dark Pulse until these Pokemon have been eliminated. If paired with Toxic Spikes, use Spiritomb to easily stall out Pokemon that have been afflicted with Toxic poison. Keep in mind that being put to sleep with Rest leaves Spiritomb asleep for exactly two turns, so make sure to only use Sleep Talk twice after using Rest.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fairy-types are an issue for this set, as they resist Dark Pulse, and most are able to heal burns with Heal Bell. As such, Registeel makes for a great partner for this set, as it resists Fairy-type attacks and can support Spiritomb with Stealth Rock. It is worth noting that both are threatened by Emboar and Houndoom, so pairing them with Alomomola is recommended. Due to Spiritomb only using Dark Pulse as its main attacking move, Pokemon such as Virizion, Emboar, and Houndoom can easily take advantage of this, so Pokemon that are able to take these three out are very helpful. Fletchinder resists both of Virizion's STAB moves while threatening with Acrobatics, and it can also burn foes, making it easier for Spiritomb to set up against physical attackers. Clerics such as Aromatisse and Togetic also make for great partners because both are able to get rid of sleep should Spiritomb still be asleep after switching out. Both are also able to switch in on and threaten Dark- and Fighting-types that resist Spiritomb's Dark Pulse with Moonblast and Dazzling Gleam, respectively. Entry hazard setters, particularly those that are able to set up Toxic Spikes, such as Qwilfish, Drapion, and Roselia, make for great partners, as Toxic Spikes lets Spiritomb easily stall out grounded Pokemon.</p>"

Furthermore, Drapion can function in a variety of roles, including setup sweeper, revenge killer, and occasionally a specially defensive set. Drapion possesses a variety of effective moves such as Knock Off, Poison Jab, Pursuit, and Toxic Spikes. This gives Drapion plenty of utility as a Pursuit trapper and a Toxic Spikes setter. Furthermore, Drapion checks and counters many top-tier Psychic-type threats, such as Meloetta and Sigilyph, while also being able to revenge kill troublesome Pokemon like Virizion with Choice Scarf. Accordingly, Drapion fits on a plethora of builds. However, Drapion's awkward Speed tier leaves it outsped by Pokemon like Flygon and Sigilyph, and its low base Special Defense makes it hard for Drapion to switch into even resisted moves like Leaf Storm from a Life Orb Venusaur frequently.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A specially defensive set can be run with Taunt, Toxic Spikes, Poison Jab, and Pursuit, with Whirlwind as another option. Choice Band can be run with the same moves as the Choice Scarf set to provide immediate power in wearing down checks more easily.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-type Pokemon like Rhyperior and Mega Camerupt can threaten Drapion with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Virizion and Sneasel can be threatening if Drapion has low health because they can do a big chunk of damage.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burns and paralysis are very crippling for Drapion, as it relies on its Attack and Speed.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Drapion to act as a wincon and break through a variety of bulky walls that it would normally have trouble beating. Knock Off functions as a solid STAB move that hits Ghost- and Psychic-types super effectively, while also possessing the ability to rid the foe of its item, which is particularly helpful against bulky targets. Poison Jab is another solid STAB move, hitting Grass- and Fairy-types like Virizion and Aromatisse super effectively, which resist Dark-type moves. Aqua Tail acts as coverage in hitting opposing Rock-, Ground-, and Fire-types super effectively; this is particularly important in hitting Rhyperior, which can take any of Drapion's STAB moves and OHKO it back with Earthquake. Earthquake can be used over Aqua Tail to allow Drapion to hit Steel- and Poison-types super effectively, most notably targeting opposing Drapion, Magneton, and Registeel.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Lum Berry allows Drapion to set up on moves like Scald without fearing burns or sustain burns from moves like Will-O-Wisp once, which could stop a potential sweep. Shuca Berry helps with opposing Flygon and Rhyperior. Battle Armor protects Drapion from critical hits, which is important when setting up. Sniper gives Drapion increased critical hit damage. A spread of 252 Attack and 252 Speed is used to maximize offensive presence and speed. A Jolly nature is used over Adamant to outspeed Pokemon like Meloetta.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Wait until the opponent's checks and counters to Drapion are weakened mid- or late-game to start setting up. Watch out for Pokemon that may carry Colbur Berry like Slowking and Jellicent. Make sure to scout for potential Choice Scarf users that may stop Drapion's sweep, such as Hitmonlee. Knock Off is very spammable early-game, as many of Drapion's checks and counters do not appreciate losing their item. Although Drapion is immune to Psychic-type attacks, make sure to not carelessly switch it on a Psychic-type that may take advantage of this, like Sigilyph using Heat Wave or Meloetta with Hyper Voice. Shuca Berry Drapion can be used to bait Pokemon like Rhyperior and Flygon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Drapion fits on a wide variety of builds. Teammates that can switch into Ground-type attacks like Braviary work well. Pokemon that help with faster Pokemon such as Fletchinder and Virizion can be good teammates. Furthermore, Pokemon that appreciate Drapion's Poison- and Dark-type STAB moves to beat their checks pair well with it, making Fighting-, Water-, and Psychic-types good partners. Electric-type Pokemon like Jolteon and Magneton are good partners for the Shuca Berry set because Drapion can lure and weaken Ground-types and help them clean more easily. Finally, Pokemon with Healing Wish like Mesprit are helpful.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off functions as the primary Dark-type STAB move, getting rid of items while also dealing high damage and hitting Ghost- and Psychic-types super effectively. Poison Jab functions as a strong Poison-type STAB move, dealing high amounts of damage to Fairy- and Grass-type Pokemon, hitting multiple types that resist Dark, and being able to revenge kill Pokemon like Virizion. Pursuit allows Drapion to come in on and trap Pokemon like Hoopa and Sigilyph, which fear Knock Off. Earthquake allows Drapion to hit opposing Magneton, Drapion, and Registeel. Ice Fang is primarily for hitting Flygon and other Ground-types like Rhyperior. Aqua Tail hits opposing Rhyperior and Mega Camerupt super effectively and can be run in the fourth slot over Earthquake. Toxic Spikes can be used over Earthquake or Ice Fang to spread status.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf is the item of choice, allowing Drapion to outspeed a variety of threats like Virizion. Sniper is used in order for a greater chance of getting a critical hit. An Adamant nature is preferred for more power; however, you lose out on outspeeding Choice Scarf Hitmonlee and Choice Scarf Meloetta with positive Speed natures. Therefore, you can run Jolly to outspeed these threats. 252 Attack and 252 Speed EVs are invested to maximize offensive prowess and speed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try not to reveal Drapion's Choice Scarf too early on, such as by switching into a Virizion's Close Combat, which makes the item obvious. Knock Off is very spammable early-game to get rid of a foe's item. Be careful of Pokemon that commonly carry Colbur Berry, as they can tank a Knock Off and retaliate. Use Drapion to revenge kill the foe with Pursuit if the opponent has a weakened Psychic- or Ghost-type Pokemon on the field. Be wary of which move you are locking Drapion into, as your opponent can take advantage of Drapion if it is locked into an unfavorable move in order to set up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Drapion is usually used to fill slots on a team and help eliminate weaknesses to Pokemon like Virizion. Grass-type Pokemon help eliminate Ground-types if you need to switch out; examples include Virizion and Venusaur. Pokemon that can switch into Drapion, such as Alomomola and Registeel, can be taken care of by Virizion and Magneton. Pokemon that appreciate Toxic Spikes and a Toxic Spikes absorber are also helpful. Pokemon like Jolteon that appreciate fast Ground-types removed have favorable synergy with Drapion. Rotom, Gurdurr, and Sigilyph are good partners because Toxic Spikes can wear down their checks.</p>"

  "Abomasnow": {
    "overview": "<p>Abomasnow is a Pokemon that does not look great whatsoever on paper. Its awful defensive typing leaves it weak to some of the most common offensive typings in RU, such as Fire, Rock, and Fighting. Moreover outside of decent HP and mixed offensive stats, Abomasnow's stats are all mediocre. Despite these shortcomings, Abomasnow still remains a potent wallbreaker in this metagame. Though Abomasnow's typing is extremely poor defensively, it is stellar offensively. Abomasnow is able to take advantage of its ability Snow Warning by spamming Blizzard, which has 100% accuracy in hail, and use its Grass-type STAB moves to stop bulky Water-types from countering it. Furthermore, Abomasnow gets fantastic coverage outside of its STAB moves in either a Ground- or Fighting-type attack to hit Steel-types, as well as a priority STAB move in Ice Shard, which can be extremely helpful in certain situations. With proper team support, Abomasnow is extremely dangerous against balance teams thanks to the many opportunities it gets to punch holes into them, but without the proper support it can become dead weight.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Wood Hammer over Giga Drain is a possibility to check Calm Mind Slowking, but it makes Abomasnow KO itself really quickly, which is unfortunate. Abomasnow can also run a Choiced set with either Choice Specs or Choice Scarf. A Choice Specs set spams Blizzard even more so than the normal set and is even stronger, which can be a huge plus. Choice Scarf can make Abomasnow a pretty decent lure because it can KO Pokemon that think they outspeed it such as Virizion, Venusaur, and Houndoom; the downside to this set is that it only outruns up to base 110 Speed Pokemon, so Sneasel and Aerodactyl can easily revenge KO it. Furthermore, once it is revealed that it is carrying Choice Scarf, it is automatically less threatening and can become dead weight. Abomasnow can run 156 Attack and 100 Speed EVs instead of the standard spread to OHKO Flygon after Stealth Rock, but this is extremely situational and the Speed is much more helpful most of the time. Abomasnow also has access to Swords Dance, but generally speaking this set is pretty bad, since its checks are abundant and normal Abomasnow doesn't have the bulk needed to set up on many things.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: The only two Pokemon in this tier that counter Abomasnow to an extent, Bronzong and Escavalier, are both Steel-type. Other Steel-types such as Registeel and Magneton can all work as solid checks, though they must be wary of Abomasnow's coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types usually should not switch into Abomasnow unless they absolutely need to because Blizzard does a lot of damage to all of them. That being said, Pokemon such as Delphox, Houndoom, and Emboar all make for good checks to Abomasnow, since they resist Ice Shard and easily OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Every Fighting-type in the tier, excluding unboosted Scrafty and uninvested Hitmontop, outspeed and OHKO Abomasnow, making all of them outside of the ones mentioned reliable checks.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Abomasnow has no way of beating Pokemon faster than it that can KO it. The best Abomasnow can do is Ice Shard, which will bounce off of anything that is not weak to it. Pokemon such as Exploud, Meloetta, Fletchinder, and Mega Glalie all fall into these categories.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Abomasnow is extremely weak to hazards to the point where Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes pressures it heavily. After a few switches and rounds of Life Orb recoil, Abomasnow just KOes itself.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Abomasnow takes advantage of its fantastic coverage and ability to freely spam Blizzard to break down slower teams. Blizzard is used as one of its main STAB moves; it is Abomasnow's hardest-hitting attack and can be difficult for a foe to switch into. Giga Drain is used as Abomasnow's second STAB move and works really well in collaboration with Blizzard. Not only does it hit the many bulky Water-types in RU that Blizzard would not dent, but it also helps make up for Life Orb recoil. Ice Shard is used as a tool to revenge kill weakened threats as well as just generally threaten Pokemon that would be used to revenge kill Abomasnow if it lacked Ice Shard such as Virizion, Flygon, and Aerodactyl. Focus Blast and Earthquake are used in attempt to cover Pokemon that resist both Grass- and Ice-type coverage. Focus Blast is good to hit bulky Steel-types such as Registeel and Bronzong either for neutral or super effective damage but comes with the great risk of misses. Earthquake hits almost the same Pokemon but can also catch Pokemon such as Delphox on the switch in and can not miss, although it does not hit Bronzong. Furthermore, Earthquake does not hit Registeel as hard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack EVs make Abomasnow as strong and as fast as possible. For the nature, you can either run Mild, which adds some always appreciated extra power to Blizzard, or Hasty, which can be used to catch Pokemon such as Exploud and neutral-natured Samurott of guard. Life Orb is the preferred item to maximize Abomasnow's power and the recoil damage does not really matter because it gains back a lot of HP by using Giga Drain.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When using Abomasnow, you should attempt to get it in as early as possible to try to put dents into teams early in the game. Abomasnow should be put onto teams that are looking for a strong wallbreaker that also has priority, since it is one of the only Pokemon that fit this description in RU. If Abomasnow risks taking a lot of damage without picking up a KO, it is often better to switch out and preserve Abomasnow's HP. Furthermore, Abomasnow should almost never be used as a switch-in unless the opponent is obviously going to do something that does a very small amount of damage to it. It should also not be used as a switch-in to Volt Switch users even though it does resist this move because that just gives the opponent a free switch into a Pokemon that can KO Abomasnow. Abomasnow can only really switch into bulky Water-types such as Alomomola, Slowking, and Jellicent, since most of the time they will only be clicking Scald and the burn for the most part does not matter, since this set is mostly special attacks. That being said, even switching into these Pokemon can be risky, since they can also use moves that hinder Abomasnow such as Thunder Wave, Knock Off, and Toxic.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Abomasnow is bothered by entry hazards with its weakness to Stealth Rock as well as its vulnerability to Toxic Spikes and Spikes. Because of this, Abomasnow appreciates being paired with Rapid Spin or Defog users such as Flygon, Pelipper, and Blastoise. With this being said, Abomasnow also appreciates hazard users of its own such as Qwilfish, Garbodor, and Roselia, which help further weaken and wear down its switch-ins. It is worth mentioning that the combination of Spikes and Defog is counterintuitive, so a spinner is preferred if going down this route. Abomasnow, as well as with most wallbreakers, appreciates Pokemon that can use Volt Switch or U-turn such as Flygon, Choice Specs Meloetta, Eelektross, and Manectric to gain momentum, as they can lure Pokemon in and let Abomasnow get a free attack off. Abomasnow's main checks and switch-ins are Steel-types, so Magnet Rise Magneton can work pretty well with Abomasnow by trapping Pokemon such as Escavalier and Bronzong. If you use Magneton, make sure to add Pokemon that deal with Fighting-types, since you are doubling up on that weakness.</p>"

  "Rhyperior": {
    "overview": "<p>With an extremely high Attack stat and a great STAB combination, Rhyperior makes its mark on RU as one of the most reliable offensive Pokemon in the tier. Thanks to Solid Rock and access to Stealth Rock, Rhyperior is able to run an efficient tank set that allows it to be one of the best offensive users of Stealth Rock in the tier. However, one shouldn't just focus on Rhyperior's abilities to tank hits and set up entry hazards. Thanks to its incredible Attack and STAB combination, Rhyperior can don a Choice Band to become one of the most terrifying wallbreakers in the tier, capable of 2HKOing any Pokemon with the proper prediction. Defensively, Rhyperior offers key resistances to Normal-, Fire-, and Flying-type moves, as well as an immunity to Electric-type moves. However, Rhyperior has unfortunate 4x weaknesses to Water- and Grass-type moves in a tier chock full of Pokemon such as Slowking, Venusaur, and Virizion. While Solid Rock helps Rhyperior with its Ground- and Fighting-type weaknesses to an extent, Pokemon like Flygon, Hitmonlee, and Medicham can still readily exploit these weaknesses. These common weaknesses are compounded by Rhyperior's lackluster Special Defense, especially when it's not invested, and poor Speed stat. In spite of this, Rhyperior is a great choice for many teams, as there are multiple ways to circumvent the issues it suffers from depending on the type of team Rhyperior is used on.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rock Polish is another way to fix Rhyperior's low Speed, but Trick Room is generally a more reliable way to fix this problem and Rhyperior can't even outspeed Choice Scarf Medicham at +2 Speed with a Jolly nature. Swords Dance can turn Rhyperior into a terrifying stallbreaker that no team can hope to wall, but it obviously suffers from Speed issues. Both Rock Polish and Swords Dance can be used on the same set to form a double dance set, but such a set would miss coverage or a STAB move. Assault Vest may seem tempting considering Rhyperior also has access to Metal Burst, but the boosted Special Defense generally doesn't help Rhyperior deal with threats that the tank set can't take hits from. Protect and Roar are alternative options for the tank set, but Ice Punch and Toxic are more useful in most situations. Weakness Policy sounds like a great idea in theory thanks to Solid Rock and Rhyperior's high raw physical bulk, but its low Speed makes for inconsistent results for such a strategy.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water- and Grass-types</strong>: Slowking, Alomomola, defensive Venusaur, and Blastoise can all take on Rhyperior due to hitting it with 4x super effective STAB moves and not being weak to either of Rhyperior's STAB moves. However, all of them have to be more careful around the Choice Band variant due to its high-powered STAB moves. Slowking in particular must be careful due to the threat of being met with a Choice Band-boosted Megahorn on the switch. It's worth noting that Venusaur and Blastoise outspeed max Speed Rhyperior, thus allowing them to immediately retaliate before taking another hit.</p> <p><strong>Bronzong</strong>: Bronzong is the only common Pokemon in RU that can deal with Rhyperior's STAB moves without being weak to any common coverage move. It can set up Stealth Rock, slowly wear down Rhyperior with Toxic, and chip away at it further with Earthquake or Gyro Ball. However, it is 2HKOed by Choice Band-boosted Megahorn.</p> <p><strong>Virizion</strong>: Although it fears Ice Punch and Choice Band-boosted Megahorn, Virizion can switch into Rhyperior's STAB moves and threaten it with STAB Leaf Blade or Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Flygon</strong>: Flygon is immune to Earthquake and resists Rock-type moves, and it can use Defog to get rid of Stealth Rock. However, it must scout for Ice Punch before staying in to Defog. It can also deal notable damage to Rhyperior with Choice Band-boosted Earthquakes.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Rhyperior has low Speed and a subpar defensive typing, so most faster Pokemon that can exploit its weaknesses can force it out. Magneton, Medicham, offensive Venusaur, Hitmonlee, and even defensive Pokemon like Blastoise and Speed invested Jellicent can easily force out Rhyperior with their STAB moves, although almost none of them can actually switch in safely due to their frailty or the incredible power of the Choice Band set.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rhyperior is very reliable at setting up Stealth Rock, especially considering it has a favorable matchup against the best Defogger in the tier, Flygon. Earthquake is the main STAB move for this set due to its reliable power and accuracy. Thanks to Rhyperior's high Attack stat, it's still capable of OHKOing Pokemon weak to it while 2HKOing most offensive threats that don't resist it. Rock Blast is the chosen Rock-type STAB move for this set to more reliably check Bulk Up Braviary as well as to break potential Focus Sashes on Accelgor and Smeargle. Ice Punch is the preferred move in the last slot in order to OHKO opposing Flygon as well as to pressure Virizion significantly. If these Pokemon aren't a major issue for your team, Toxic is a fine alternative to catch the likes of Alomomola and Slowking upon switch-in. Megahorn is less useful overall than Ice Punch and Toxic, but it can 2HKO all Slowking variants. Stone Edge is usually stronger than Rock Blast, but the lower PP and inability to break through Substitutes and Focus Sashes are generally not desirable for this set.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The listed EV spread maximizes Rhyperior's special bulk while also hitting a boost point with Attack. Adamant is the chosen nature in order to allow Rhyperior to reliably achieve the OHKOs and 2HKOs it needs to get, such as the OHKO on bulkier variants of Mega Camerupt, with Earthquake. Due to Rhyperior being in the middle of a crowded Speed tier, you can opt to invest in some Speed for specific targets should it benefit the team. Investing 28 Speed EVs is enough for Rhyperior to outpace negative Speed nature Diancie, 84 Speed EVs are enough for Registeel and neutral nature Diancie, and 96 Speed EVs get the jump on the odd maximum Speed Mega Camerupt should Rhyperior's team fear it. A more physically defensive spread can be used should Rhyperior's team be weaker to the likes of Sneasel and Emboar. If necessary, it can even take a powerful hit from Medicham and Sawk in a pinch with such a spread. Leftovers is the only item that should be considered for this set, as Rhyperior has no other form of recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Attempt to switch Rhyperior into the likes of Jolteon, Braviary, and defensive Diancie so that it can set up Stealth Rock or chip down the opposing team without taking too much damage. Stealth Rock is usually a good opening move once Rhyperior gets into the battle, especially for Ice Punch variants. Earthquake is a safe STAB move to use, as most Pokemon that are immune to it aren't switching into Rhyperior often due to the threat of Rock Blast. On that subject, Rock Blast really gets a chance to shine against Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary and Focus Sash users, so be sure use it to limit the effectiveness of these Pokemon. It's a good idea to keep Ice Punch hidden so that Rhyperior can potentially lure Flygon into a false sense of security. The exception is if you feel an opposing Virizion may be trying to switch into Rhyperior, since the 4x Grass weakness means Rhyperior won't be able to safely stay in the turn after to hit Virizion. Toxic's main use is against Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary and bulky Water-types. Be sure to catch bulky Water-types on the switch, as Rhyperior has a 4x weakness to their STAB attacks. When Megahorn is used, attempt to keep it hidden until Slowking switches into Earthquake. Hitting it with Megahorn on the switch is largely unproductive thanks to Regenerator.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to its glaring 4x weaknesses to Water- and Grass-type moves, it stands to reason that Rhyperior works well with Pokemon that can handle these attacks. Defensive Venusaur is a great option, as it doesn't mind Scald burns due to its multiple forms of recovery, and it can easily shrug off Grass-type moves. More offensive variants of Venusaur are hurt more by Scald burns, but they appreciate Stealth Rock cutting into Flying- and Fire-type Pokemon. Other Grass-types, specifically Virizion and Rotom-C, are also perfectly capable of handling Water-type Pokemon, but they struggle more with opposing Grass-types. Granbull can reliably check most Fighting-types and provide Heal Bell support to keep Rhyperior from being hindered by Toxic or Will-O-Wisp. Hoopa and Jellicent are solid options depending on the kind of team Rhyperior is used on, as they can keep Blastoise from removing Stealth Rock. Hoopa should be used on more offensive teams while slower teams can utilize Jellicent. Note that Jellicent should run Hex as its STAB move if Rhyperior's team is using it to spinblock Blastoise consistently. Emboar and Delphox are notable Fire-types that can check Grass-types with their powerful offensive presences, but they can't take too many hits. Accelgor and Mega Glalie can utilize Spikes more effectively if Rhyperior is carrying Ice Punch to smack Flygon, and they can even reduce the pressure on Rhyperior to catch Flygon as they can pressure it themselves. While Hitmonlee, Medicham, and Virizion can all put heavy pressure on Rhyperior as adversaries, they can make for great offensive partners thanks to Rhyperior's ability to keep most Flying-types, especially Fletchinder, in check. Knock Off users, particularly Alomomola, can make it easier for Rhyperior to wear down opposing bulky Water-types with repeated Earthquakes or Toxic. This is especially helpful against Blastoise, as it rarely has reliable recovery outside of Leftovers.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>While Rhyperior is quite capable of tanking hits and dishing them back out effectively, this set focuses on brute strength. With the proper prediction, this Rhyperior is capable of 2HKOing the entire tier. Stone Edge and Earthquake are the STAB moves of choice, as both clock in at 100 Base Power and 2HKO any Pokemon without a resistance or immunity to them. Megahorn is key so that Rhyperior can 2HKO Bronzong, OHKO Slowking, and still smack bulky variants of Flygon. Ice Punch is usually preferred in the last slot to OHKO bulky variants of Flygon as well as to OHKO Virizion without relying on shaky accuracy. However, Rock Blast is a fine alternative if Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary is a problem for Rhyperior's team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread simply maximizes Attack and Speed for Rhyperior. The Speed is necessary to outspeed defensive threats such as Alomomola and Hitmontop so that Rhyperior can 2HKO them as they switch in before being hit with a move itself. Adamant is the nature of choice to give Rhyperior an even bigger power boost. Jolly is an option if outspeeding Blastoise is useful for your team, but most variants of Blastoise run slight Speed investment for neutral nature base 50 Speed Pokemon, which Jolly Rhyperior falls just short of. Choice Band is the best item for this set, as Rhyperior will often be forced out after a KO anyway.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rhyperior should be switched into physical Normal-, Fire-, and Flying-type moves as well as any Electric-type moves whenever possible. Once Rhyperior has switched in, simply pick the move that's most effective against the likely switch-in in order to 2HKO it most of the time. Both of Rhyperior's STAB moves have some drawback to using them, but nothing is immune to Stone Edge despite its imperfect accuracy. Once Flying-types and Levitate users have been removed from battle, it's very easy for Rhyperior to simply spam Earthquake; even Virizion, the only Grass-type that resists Ground-type moves, is 2HKOed without question. Megahorn won't be used that often, but you definitely need to try to catch Bronzong with it, as it fears nothing else Rhyperior has. It's also extremely helpful catching unsuspecting Slowking, as all variants are OHKOed after Stealth Rock. Ice Punch OHKOes bulky variants of Flygon, most Flying-types, and Virizion, all of which prevent Rhyperior from using Earthquake freely. Despite the high HP stat, Rhyperior is surprisingly frail specially, so don't test your luck against STAB attacks that hit Rhyperior for neutral damage. Even strong resisted hits such as Exploud's Boomburst and Meloetta's Hyper Voice can 2HKO Rhyperior.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Like with many wallbreakers, having a late-game sweeper is ideal in order to take advantage of the holes Rhyperior punches. Virizion, Fletchinder, and Aerodactyl are the best options, since Rhyperior tends to lure in their checks and counters as it is. Slowking is a solid pivot to fall back on due to its Fighting- and Ice-type resistances, and it can provide paralysis support to improve Rhyperior's effectiveness against faster teams. Granbull can function similarly with regards to checking Fighting-types and providing paralysis support, but it's less durable in exchange for providing cleric support to keep Rhyperior from being crippled by burns. Defensive Venusaur can switch into Grass-, Water-, and Fighting-type moves for Rhyperior while also giving Rhyperior openings to switch into battle thanks to its Fire- and Flying-type weaknesses. Stealth Rock is very helpful as it ensures Slowking is OHKOed by Megahorn and it chips down most Earthquake switch-ins very quickly. Registeel and Druddigon are most notable thanks to having decent defensive synergy with Rhyperior, and they both provide paralysis support. Spikes support isn't exactly mandatory per se, but it's very useful in limiting the Regenerator recovery that the likes of Slowking and Alomomola gain by switching out. Accelgor and Mega Glalie are great for offensive teams and pressuring Flygon, while Garbodor can check Fighting- and Grass-types for Rhyperior on bulkier teams. While paralysis support is the most common way to fix Rhyperior's Speed against faster opponents, Trick Room is another way. Slowking is a very good setter to use with Rhyperior due to their type synergy. If this route is taken, make sure to move all Speed EVs to either HP or Special Defense, change to a Brave nature, and consider using Life Orb so as to not waste Trick Room turns by being forced out due to being locked into a move.</p>"

  "Rotom": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its superb defensive typing and decent base 91 Speed, Rotom is a threatening status spreader in RU. Its typing grants it five resistances and three immunities, which allow it to deal with influential walls in RU such as Registeel and Alomomola and sweepers such as Fletchinder. Sadly, Rotom is quite frail due to its low HP and subpar defenses, making a majority of matchups dependent on its foe's typing, and while its typing gives it several resistances, Rotom's weakness to common Dark-type attacks makes it an easy target for Pursuit trapping.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set with Choice Specs or Choice Scarf alongside Trick can be used, but Rotom's Special Attack is too low to deal significant damage through this method. Rotom could afford running a fully offensive set with a Life Orb or an Expert Belt, but it is completely outclassed by Mismagius due to the latter's higher Special Attack and Speed, better coverage, and access to Nasty Plot. Hidden Power Water is an option to hit Mega Camerupt, which otherwise walls Rotom, though Rotom doesn't have an extra moveslot and Mega Camerupt is generally better handled by a teammate.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mega Camerupt</strong>: Mega Camerupt takes minimal damage from Rotom, as it is immune to both Discharge and Will-O-Wisp and takes little damage from Hex; in return, it OHKOes Rotom with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Clerics</strong>: Aromatisse and Audino take little from Rotom's attacks, with the latter being immune to Hex as well, and can heal themselves through Wish and Heal Bell. It should be noted that Aromatisse does take a considerable amount of damage from Hex when it is burned.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Although they should be wary of switching into Discharge due to its paralysis chance, Drapion, Sneasel, and Houndoom take little damage from Hex, with Houndoom also being able to switch into Will-O-Wisp, and they can OHKO Rotom with their Dark-type STAB moves or Pursuit trap it. Scrafty can set up on Rotom thanks to its natural bulk and Shed Skin. Spiritomb can bypass Substitute and cripple Rotom with Will-O-Wisp or Pursuit trap it.</p> <p><strong>Special Attacking Normal-types</strong>: Meloetta and Exploud can switch into Hex, are not completely crippled by Will-O-Wisp, and can heavily damage Rotom with Psychic-type STAB moves and Boomburst, respectively; it should be noted that Boomburst bypasses Substitute, thereby threatening Rotom more. Neither of these Pokemon appreciates being paralyzed by Discharge, though.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With Will-O-Wisp, Rotom is capable of crippling various physical attackers, Dark-types, and subduing certain tanks such as Steelix. Hex goes well with Rotom's ability to spread burns, making it a dangerous attack versus even defensive targets. Volt Switch + Pain Split can be used to make Rotom less prone to being Pursuit trapped while maintaining its longevity, whereas Substitute + Discharge allows Rotom to dodge status and safely spread paralysis.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature is needed so that Rotom can take advantage of its Speed tier to outspeed base 90s such as Meloetta, thus giving it more opportunities to spread status or quickly Volt Switch away before getting hit by a Shadow Ball. Max HP investment is used as it allows Rotom to withstand various attacks more easily and sustain its Substitute versus weaker attackers; however, Spell Tag with max Special Attack investment is an option, as it allows Rotom to be significantly more dangerous.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Thanks to its various resistances and immunities, Rotom can find several opportunities to switch in during a match. Substitute provides Rotom with a decent matchup against many common leads, though you must be wary of fast Pursuit trappers, such as Sneasel and Drapion; it also gives Rotom the opportunity to lure out and cripple bulky threats that might switch into it. Rotom should avoid switching continually, as it is worn down by Stealth Rock and risks being Pursuit trapped.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that handle Mega Camerupt such as Slowking and Alomomola are greatly appreciated, as it completely walls Rotom. Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee, Hariyama, and Emboar help deal with Dark-types that might threaten Rotom. Rotom excels at beating bulky Water- and Steel-types, so Pokemon that appreciate them gone such as Swords Dance Samurott and Meloetta, respectively, are valuable partners. As Rotom handles Steel-types and can cripple some Dark-types and Meloetta, Sigilyph is a great partner that also works well with the teamstyles Rotom fits on. Toxic Spikes allows Rotom to stall out its foes with Substitute more easily while also boosting Hex's power.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-F is an interesting Pokemon in RU. It stands out with its fantastic STAB combination, which allows it to hit nearly the entire tier for neutral damage and to run support moves, such as Trick, Volt Switch, and Pain Split over additional coverage. It's a potent stallbreaker and good Choice Scarf wielder with a good base 105 Special Attack and usable base 86 Speed. Rotom-F can also act as the premier Blizzard spammer on hail teams. Finally, Levitate gives it a helpful immunity to Earthquake and Earth power, allowing it to take on threats such as Flygon a bit more easily. Despite these positive traits, Rotom-F's decent bulk is undermined by a bad defensive typing, which includes a crippling weakness to Stealth Rock. Furthermore, it has to rely on the shaky accuracy of Blizzard to target many Pokemon, making it unreliable as a check to the likes of Rhyperior. Finally, bulky Mega Evolutions such as Mega Audino are immune to Trick, and can switch into Rotom-F and threaten to set up or fire off attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Will-O-Wisp can be used on the SubSplit set if the healing of Pain Split isn't useful. Thunder Wave can also be used on the SubSplit set, but it is generally not useful against the stall-oriented Pokemon the set is meant to bring down. Choice Specs is an option, but there are better Choice Specs users such as Jolteon and Meloetta. A defensive Leftovers or ChestoRest set is possible, but Rotom-F generally lacks the resistances to pull it off and is easy to whittle down with Stealth Rock. Hidden Power Fire is an option to nail Assault Vest Escavalier, but it possesses little utility outside of that. Finally, Hidden Power Grass is an option to smack Seismitoad and Gastrodon super effectively, as well as hit Lanturn harder than any other move Rotom-F normally runs.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: While some special walls are beaten by the Substitute + Pain Split set, Gastrodon can stall out Rotom-F, while Diancie can check it and threaten to KO back with Diamond Storm. Assault Vest users such as Eelektross and Escavalier can come in and massively threaten Rotom-F back with a powerful STAB or a super effective coverage move. Mega Audino, while not really appreciating the SubSplit set, can deal with Choice Scarf Rotom-F with ease, as it's immune to Trick.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Magneton has the luxury of resisting both of Rotom-F's STAB moves and can hit hard back with Flash Cannon. Aggron can take any one attack from Rotom-F and OHKO it with Head Smash.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Toxic, burns, Life Orb recoil, Substitute damage, and especially Stealth Rock can severely cut into Rotom-F's bulk and make it much easier to take down, putting it into KO range of common priority attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fast Attackers</strong>: Against the SubSplit set or once Choice Scarf has been Tricked away, fast attackers such as Houndoom, Delphox, and Manectric can maul Rotom-F with their STAB attacks. Pokemon such as Sneasel and Flygon can KO it once Rotom-F has taken the slightest amount of residual damage. The Choice Scarf set is threatened by faster Choice Scarf users such as Delphox and Flygon, as well as priority moves from the likes of Absol, Medicham, and especially Hitmonlee, which can hit it with a super effective Mach Punch.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch is a decently powerful STAB move that maintains momentum and is generally the go-to on this set, unless it is necessary to heavily damage the opposing Pokemon. Thunderbolt is a more powerful STAB move that doesn't switch Rotom-F out, and is useful for targeting the likes of Alomomola and Fletchinder. Blizzard, while inaccurate, is Rotom-F's best way to take down Flygon and Rotom-C. Finally, Trick is an amazing utility move for shutting down walls such as Diancie, which would otherwise be able to take on Rotom-F.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Speed and Special Attack allows Rotom-F to hit as hard and as fast as possible. A Timid nature is used to Speed tie with Choice Scarf Rotom-C and to outspeed Choice Scarf Medicham, unboosted Accelgor, and Aerodactyl. It also makes Rotom-F as fast as possible should it lose its Choice Scarf, outspeeding Adamant Hitmonlee and Timid Venusaur. Choice Scarf is the chosen item for a large boost in Speed as well as the ability to cripple walls with Trick.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Against offensive teams, Rotom-F should primarily be used to grab momentum and revenge kill. Against stall or balance teams, however, it should attempt to cripple Pokemon such as Diancie and Gurdurr with Trick. Rotom-F can switch in on resisted hits, but super effective or powerful neutral hits should be avoided. Rotom-F also appreciates Stealth Rock off its side of the field, as it tends to go in and out of the battle quite a bit.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removers are very useful to Rotom-F, as they can keep it healthy and out of range of priority attacks. Flygon makes a fantastic partner, removing hazards and relieving its Rock and Fire weaknesses. Rotom-F, in return, can take on bulky Water-types and pressure opposing Flygon. Blastoise can make for another good option on more defensive teams, still removing hazards and also checking Fire-types and benefiting from Rotom-F's positive matchup against Grass-types. Other entry hazard removers, such as Kabutops and Pelipper, are also acceptable choices. Wallbreakers that can defeat or heavily damage Registeel, such as Delphox and Emboar, work well with Rotom-F's ability to take down bulky Water-types for them, such as Alomomola. Users of U-turn and Volt Switch, such as Uxie, Flygon, and Manectric, can form a VoltTurn core with Rotom-F. Manectric makes for an especially solid teammate for its ability to pressure Steel-types with Flamethrower or Overheat. Hazard setters such as Rhyperior, Qwilfish, Garbodor, and Accelgor can help whittle down Rotom-F's checks and counters. Hail support from Abomasnow is very helpful to allow Rotom-F to spam Blizzard without fear of missing, and it can also break down defensive Pokemon for Rotom-F. Keep in mind that Abomasnow and Rotom-F will stack weaknesses to Fire, Fighting, and Rock on your team, but the offensive synergy they provide is more important.</p>"
      },
      "SubSplit": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt is a reliable, powerful STAB move that hits neutral and super effective targets hard. Blizzard is a secondary, more powerful STAB move that hits Rhyperior and Venusaur for good damage. Pain Split is the closest thing Rotom-F has to reliable recovery and can do a large chunk to walls with a high HP stat, such as Mega Audino and Aromatisse. Substitute not only shields Rotom-F from status conditions but also can cut the foe's HP thanks to Pain Split.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Life Orb is the item of choice to hit as hard as possible, and the lost HP can be recovered by way of Pain Split. A Timid nature is essential to outspeed Jolly Braviary, Jolly Absol, and Adamant Hitmonlee. The EVs are standard, allowing Rotom-F to hit as hard and as fast as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should generally be used to defeat or force out opposing walls, as it excels against bulky, passive Pokemon. Pokemon that fail to break Rotom-F's Substitute, such as Scald Alomomola, or ones that it can force out, such as Braviary, are prime targets to set up Substitutes on. Substitute can also dodge an incoming status move, such as Toxic from Seismitoad. While Rotom-F can switch in on weak or resisted hits, it should avoid coming in on powerful neutral and super effective hits. Substitute is a safe option to go for most of the time, as even if the foe manages to break it, Rotom-F can dish out more damage with Pain Split. Rotom-F should generally be brought in early in the game to set up Substitute and punch holes in the opposing team. Against more offensive teams, Rotom-F should generally just stick to firing off powerful attacks rather than attempting to use Substitute or Pain Split. Finally, Pokemon that use sound moves and have the ability Infiltrator can hit Rotom-F through its Substitute, so be weary of Hyper Voice Meloetta, Bug Buzz Accelgor, Boomburst Exploud, and Infiltrator Spiritomb.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Flygon makes for an exceptional partner, grabbing momentum for Rotom-F, removing entry hazards from your side of the field, and resisting the Rock- and Fire-type attacks that trouble Rotom-F. Blastoise is also a solid entry hazard remover to use alongside Rotom-F, resisting Fire-type attacks and removing hazards from your side of the field without removing your own. Late-game sweepers such as Fletchinder, Sneasel, and Absol appreciate Rotom-F's ability to pressure Alomomola and Aromatisse. Hazard support is very useful to capitalize on the large number of switches this set forces. Toxic Spikes support from the likes of Weezing and Qwilfish in particular can pressure opposing walls even more. Hail support from Abomasnow is very useful to give Rotom-F's Blizzard flawless accuracy.</p>"

  "Rotom-Mow": {
    "overview": "<p>With great typing in Electric / Grass, Rotom-C has a good STAB combination as well as a few useful resistances to Water-, Electric-, and Grass-type attacks. To complement its great typing, Rotom-C has a fantastic ability in Levitate, which grants it an immunity to Ground-type attacks as well as all entry hazards bar Stealth Rock. Additionally, it has good Speed, good Special Attack, and solid defensive stats. Despite its decent Speed, it is still left outsped by many threats in RU such as Houndoom, Hitmonlee, and Drapion when not holding a Choice Scarf. Rotom-C also is limited to running Choice sets because it is outclassed by Pokemon such as Venusaur and Virizion in other roles. Its movepool is very limited as well, and it does not help that its main STAB attacks, Leaf Storm and Volt Switch, are not very reliable. Rotom-C also has issues with many Grass-types because they resist both of its STAB types and Rotom-C's coverage options to hit them are weak.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Though Rotom-C does not have many options in terms of moves, it also can run a defensively oriented set that uses Rest / Pain Split, Will-O-Wisp, Volt Switch, and Leaf Storm with either a Chesto Berry or Leftovers, but this set is very limited because its recovery options are either one-time use or unreliable and it has inconsistent STAB moves. A SubSplit set consisting of Substitute, Pain Split, Will-O-Wisp, and Thunderbolt also has use, but Rotom-C is better off used as either a revenge killer or wallbreaker. Hidden Power Ice is another decent option when paired with an Expert Belt because it deals with the Dragon- and Grass-type Pokemon that Rotom-C often lures in. Charge Beam is a nifty move that can be a decent gimmick for an Expert Belt set, but its Base Power is very weak and it boosts Special Attack unreliably. Lastly, Rain Dance with a Damp Rock along with Thunder has use for rain teams because Rotom-C is one of the best rain setters, pairing well with Swift Swim users such as Kabutops, Omastar, and Ludicolo.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Venusaur and Virizion can switch in on both of Rotom-C's STAB moves very easily, and Virizion also potentially uses it as setup bait.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Camerupt switches into Rotom-C's Volt Switch or Thunderbolt, making Rotom-C lose momentum, and it is also immune to Trick, though it does not like taking a Choice Specs-boosted Leaf Storm. In return, Mega Camerupt can either OHKO with a Fire-type attack or set up Stealth Rock predicting Rotom-C to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Houndoom, Delphox, Hitmonlee, and Choice Scarf Emboar have no problem outspeeding and taking down Rotom-C, although all of them must watch out for its Choice Scarf set. Flygon naturally outspeeds Rotom-C's Choice Specs set and is able to block Rotom-C's Volt Switch, but Flygon takes a lot of damage from Leaf Storm. Mega Glalie also outspeeds and OHKOes Rotom-C with either Return or Double-Edge and picks off weakened Choice Scarf Rotom-C with Ice Shard.</p>",

      "IN THE CUT (Choice Scarf)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm is a very strong STAB attack that severely hurts everything weak to it and deals heavy damage to some neutral targets. Volt Switch does decent damage and also lets Rotom-C retain offensive momentum. Thunderbolt is a secondary Electric-type STAB move that is mainly used for its reliability, as Leaf Storm lowers Rotom-C's Special Attack by two stages and Volt Switch forces Rotom-C to switch out of battle. Trick is used to cripple walls that might switch into Rotom-C, such as Aromatisse, heavily crippling them for the rest of the match. Will-O-Wisp is another option that can be used over Thunderbolt because it lets Rotom-C cripple Pokemon with burns after it gets rid of its Choice Scarf via Trick, though it is worth noting that Rotom-C cannot sweep late-game without Thunderbolt.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs are used to let Rotom-C outspeed as many Pokemon as possible, including Choice Scarf Braviary, Accelgor if Rotom-C is running a Timid nature, and Adamant Hitmonlee after Rotom-C has Tricked away its Choice Scarf. Maximum Special Attack EVs make Rotom-C hit as hard as possible. The choice between Timid and Modest depends on whether you want Rotom-C to outspeed more Pokemon or have some more power behind its attacks. Choice Scarf lets Rotom-C act as a revenge killer as well as a late-game cleaner.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If Rotom-C is sent out early-game, use Volt Switch to grab momentum if Ground-types and Jolteon are not present. Use Leaf Storm on predicted switches to Ground-types, though be cautious in using the move, as the Special Attack drop leaves Rotom-C as setup bait for Pokemon such as Houndoom and Virizion. Once the opponent's Pokemon are weakened and Pokemon with Electric immunities are eliminated, use Thunderbolt to clean up late-game. Use Trick on walls that switch in, as it cripples them immensely; however, before getting rid of Rotom-C's Choice Scarf, make sure there are not any faster Pokemon that Rotom-C needs to keep its Choice Scarf for.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because this set serves as a revenge killer and a late-game cleaner, Rotom-C pairs excellently with powerful wallbreakers. Notable examples include Exploud, Houndoom, Mega Camerupt, and Emboar, which all appreciate coming in unscathed due to Rotom-C's Volt Switch. Other Pokemon that use either Volt Switch or U-turn, such as Meloetta, Braviary, and Flygon, are also great teammates because they can constantly retain offensive momentum against the opponent's team. Fire-types pair especially well with Rotom-C because Rotom-C takes Water- and Ground-type attacks aimed at them while Fire-types such as Emboar resist Bug-, Fire-, and Ice-type attacks aimed at Rotom-C. Setup sweepers such as Rock Polish Tyrantrum also pair well with Rotom-C because they can take advantage of walls that have been Tricked and gain free setup turns. Finally, entry hazards are very helpful, as they make it easier for Rotom-C to clean late-game, so Rhyperior and Druddigon are good to pair with Rotom-C. Additionally, Qwilfish, Accelgor, and Mega Glalie are great partners because all of them are able set up Spikes; the former also is able to set up Toxic Spikes.</p>"
      },
      "IN THE CUT (Choice Specs)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm backed by Choice Specs hits insanely hard with a drawback of lowering Rotom-C's Special Attack by two stages. Volt Switch is the main Electric-type STAB move, as it retains offensive momentum while hitting decently hard. Thunderbolt is a reliable Electric-type STAB attack that has no drawbacks and still hits really hard. Trick is used to cripple switch-ins such as Torterra and Aromatisse. Hidden Power Fire is useful if used over Trick for Grass-type switch-ins such as Virizion and Venusaur. It also OHKOes Choice Band variants of Escavalier from full health while easily 2HKOing Assault Vest variants.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs let Rotom-C outspeed everything up to Adamant Hitmonlee if Rotom-C is running a Timid nature, Mega Glalie before it Mega Evolves, and Mesprit. Maximum Special Attack EVs are used to let Rotom-C hit as hard as possible. The choice of either a Timid or Modest nature is up to whether you want more speed or more power. Choice Specs allows Rotom-C to act as a wallbreaker with Leaf Storm and Thunderbolt that can also dish out good damage with Volt Switch. Expert Belt also has use, as it lets Rotom-C bluff having a Choice item, luring in Ground-types that think Rotom-C is locked into one of its Electric-type STAB moves. It also is useful when paired with Hidden Power Fire to surprise the Grass-types the Rotom-C lures in.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Volt Switch early-game if Ground-types and Jolteon are not present to grab offensive momentum. If the opponent has a Pokemon immune to Electric on their team, try to predict their switches with a well-timed Leaf Storm. Use it carefully, though, because the Special Attack drop means Rotom-C becomes setup bait for the likes of Virizion and Houndoom. Unlike the Choice Scarf set, this set is a wallbreaker rather than a late-game cleaner, so using it early- and mid-game is best to weaken teams for your team's sweeper to capitalize on.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Strong Fire-types such as Emboar and Houndoom are great teammates because they can switch in on Grass-types that force Rotom-C out, while Rotom-C beats bulky Water-types that give them trouble, such as Qwilfish and Alomomola. Flygon is also a great partner for Rotom-C because they have decent synergy and form a VoltTurn core. Fletchinder takes on Grass-types as well while Rotom-C threatens Rhyperior, allowing Fletchinder to sweep late-game. Entry hazards work well with Rotom-C, so Druddigon and Rhyperior are good options for Stealth Rock users and Qwilfish and Accelgor make for good Spikes users. Mega Glalie in particular is a very good partner because it beats problematic Grass-types for Rotom-C while also being able support Rotom-C by setting up Spikes. Because Rotom-C is a wallbreaker, setup sweepers such as Rock Polish Tyrantrum and Nasty Plot Houndoom all make for excellent partners.</p>"

  "Uxie": {
    "overview": "<p>Uxie is a rather unique Pokemon for RU, as it is a defensive Pokemon with a base Speed stat of 95, which is high for such Pokemon. With access to U-turn and Stealth Rock, Uxie works best on offensive teams, as it can check common threats to offense, such as Medicham and Venusaur. Uxie also benefits from having access to many utility moves, most notably Yawn and Thunder Wave, which let it cripple the foe and pivot out with U-turn afterwards. Due to its 75 / 130 / 130 bulk, Uxie is pretty hard to take down, which means it can disrupt the momentum of the opposing team. However, Uxie has very poor offensive presence, as its base 75 offenses are rather low. Uxie is also susceptible to being worn down, as it does not have reliable recovery.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dual screens Uxie can be used, but it is mediocre because there are few Pokemon that can actually benefit from this support. Uxie can run a set consisting of Calm Mind, Psychic, Hidden Power Ground, and Rest with Chesto Berry to act as a setup sweeper, but this is still pressured by Dark-types, as Uxie fails to KO most of them with its coverage move. Uxie acts as the premier weather setter for sun or rain teams, with Rain Dance / Sunny Day, Knock Off / U-turn, Stealth Rock, and Memento. A specially defensive set can be used to fare better against Venusaur, Mega Camerupt, Abomasnow, and Meloetta. Dazzling Gleam can be used over U-turn, as it makes Uxie hit Dark-types harder, while running Heal Bell over Thunder Wave allows Uxie to act as a cleric, making it a somewhat decent choice in some balance teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Houndoom, Scrafty, Drapion, Sneasel, Spiritomb, and Absol are immune to Uxie's STAB moves and can hit hard in return. Houndoom, Drapion, Sneasel, and Absol can heavily weaken it, although they need to watch out for Thunder Wave. Scrafty can use it as setup fodder if it is running Shed Skin, and Spiritomb can Pursuit trap it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Alomomola, Slowking, Jellicent, and Blastoise can shrug off any damage from Uxie, and in return they can attempt to burn it with Scald or cripple it with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Registeel and Bronzong resist Uxie's attacks, don't mind a Thunder Wave, and can cripple it with Toxic</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Hoopa, Exploud, and Mega Camerupt can 2HKO Uxie with their STAB moves, while Uxie can only pivot out. Choice Band Escavalier can OHKO Uxie and should be watched out for.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary and Gallade can set up on Uxie if they're behind a Substitute, since Uxie cannot do anything to stop them.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock deals damage every time a Pokemon switches in, and Uxie's above-average Speed ensures it sets up the hazard reliably. U-turn and Yawn allow Uxie to pivot out of threats, gaining momentum for the team. Alternatively, Thunder Wave can also be used instead of Yawn to cripple faster threats, such as Sneasel, Virizion, Choice Scarf Medicham, and Delphox, which are common threats. Psyshock is used to hit Venusaur, Virizion, Hitmonlee, and Sawk, all of which are prominent threats in the metagame. One of the main reasons to use Psyshock over other Psychic-type STAB moves is that the Pokemon Uxie wants to hit are physically less bulky, and running Psyshock allows Uxie to switch into Scald without much hesitation. However, Zen Headbutt could be used in conjunction with an Impish nature to have a stronger U-turn, which will deal more damage to Dark-types that will try to switch in on Uxie, while Psychic can be used to fare better versus Gurdurr. Dazzling Gleam can be used over U-turn, as it makes Uxie hit Dark-types harder, while running Heal Bell over Thunder Wave allows Uxie to act as a cleric, making it a somewhat decent choice in some balance teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Speed EVs allow Uxie to outspeed Timid Venusaur and other Pokemon with a base Speed stat of or lower than 80, while the rest of Uxie's EVs are put into HP and Defense to maximize its overall bulk. It does not need much investment in defenses due to its high defensive base stats. Colbur Berry is used because of the plethora of Dark-types in the tier, so Uxie can either cripple them or pivot on them. Alternatively, a spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with 30 Speed IVs can be used with a Bold nature to have a slower U-turn, which allows Uxie's teammate to have a safe switch in.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Uxie is a great lead, and it is almost always safe to lead with, unless the opponent has an Escavalier or Hoopa on their team. Uxie is a very consistent Stealth Rock user and can generate momentum with U-turn after it has set up the hazard. Uxie should be used as a defensive pivot, usually switching into Fighting-type Pokemon. Yawn should be used to cripple walls or put setup sweepers on a timer. Try to take advantage of the free turns Yawn provides. Thunder Wave should be used to cripple faster threats such as Virizion, Aerodactyl, Sneasel, and Drapion. Preserving Colbur Berry to cripple Sneasel and Drapion is recommended. Keep in mind that Uxie has no reliable recovery, so it shouldn't be used too recklessly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Yawn forces switches, hazard-stacking Pokemon such as Garbodor, Qwilfish, and Mega Glalie are great partners for Uxie. Slow wallbreakers such as Mega Camerupt, Exploud, and Hoopa appreciate Uxie's ability to spread Thunder Wave. Despite not being a wallbreaker, Gurdurr also benefits from Thunder Wave support, as it gets an easier time to sweep. As Uxie has no reliable recovery, Wish passers such as Alomomola and Aromatisse are good partners for it. However, these Pokemon aren't good for offense, and they should be used in balanced builds instead. Fighting-types such as Emboar, Virizion, Gurdurr, Sawk, and Medicham are good partners, as they can take care of the Dark-types that threaten Uxie.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Sporting a well-rounded stat distribution, a plethora of coverage moves such as Ice Beam, Knock Off, and Thunderbolt at its disposal that give it a good amount of unpredictability, great utility moves in the form of Stealth Rock and Healing Wish, and traits that distinguish itself from other Psychic-types, Mesprit carves a niche for itself on offensive teams in the RU metagame. Having an above-average Speed tier is very notable, as it helps Mesprit outspeed notable threats like Jolly Absol and Adamant Hitmonlee and Speed tie with Timid Venusaur and Jolly Medicham.</p> <p>However, despite having Levitate and a resistance to Fighting, Mesprit must watch out for most relevant Ground-types, since it doesn't have the ability to handle them, and it also needs to stay healthy to check Fighting-types. Moreover, it faces competition from its close relative, Uxie, which possesses better overall bulk, doesn't struggle to fit U-turn on its moveset, and isn't enclosed into an offensive archetype. In addition, Mesprit struggles against common Psychic-types like Sigilyph and Meloetta.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mesprit can make really good use of Knock Off to successfully weaken opposing Psychic-types and remove items, which helps it have a better matchup against bulkier Pokemon. U-turn gives it a tool to pivot around the Psychic-, Steel-, and Ground-types it struggles to handle. However, Mesprit lacks a moveslot for it, and the move is generally used better by Uxie. Grass Knot deals great damage to Pokemon like Seismitoad, Rhyperior, and Blastoise, but that comes at the cost of being unable to do significant damage to Dark-types. A Choice Scarf set consisting of Trick, Healing Wish, Psyshock, and Dazzling Gleam is a viable alternative, since it can effectively cripple many relevant defensive Pokemon and has pretty decent revenge killing potential while keeping its Healing Wish utility. Ice Beam can OHKO every Flygon variant but it doesn't do nearly as much damage as Dazzling Gleam against Dark-types. Thunder Wave is another option to slow down faster threats, but Mesprit struggles to find a place for it on its moveset and Uxie pulls it off much more effectively. Psychic is an option to hit Pokemon with higher Defense stats harder but it is generally outclassed by Psyshock, which does more damage to Virizion.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Pokemon like Steelix, Escavalier, and Registeel have a really easy time switching into Mesprit, as its moves deal negligible damage to them whereas they can easily take advantage of it either by setting Stealth Rock themselves, in the case of Steelix and Registeel, or by Pursuit trapping it and forcing the use of Colbur Berry, in the case of Escavalier.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Mesprit really struggles against opposing Psychic-types, as it is unable to do meaningful damage to Pokemon like Delphox, Meloetta, Uxie, Sigilyph, and Musharna. They can easily advantage of it by either using Calm Mind or just beating it one-on-one thanks to Mesprit's lack of recovery.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Due to Mesprit's lack of staying power, it doesn't have the ability to get past any defensive staples like Alomomola, Diancie, and Slowking. It will have to either switch out or use Healing Wish in such a situation.</p> <p><strong>Blastoise</strong>: Despite being a bulky Pokemon on its own, Mesprit despises facing Blastoise, since it can easily outlast the pixie by wearing it down with Scald and constantly removing the Stealth Rock it sets thanks to Blastoise being slower.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types That Are Neutral to Dazzling Gleam</strong>: Drapion and Houndoom are example of Dark-types Mesprit can't withstand even with a Colbur Berry, with both being able to easily outdamage whatever attack it throws at them and set up Swords Dance and Nasty Plot, respectively.</p>",

      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock punishes switch-ins, breaks Focus Sashes, and puts immediate pressure on the opposing team. Mesprit has the ability to set it up a good number of times throughout the match if it happens to get removed thanks to the decent offensive pressure it applies. Healing Wish is the reason why Mesprit distinguishes itself from other Stealth Rock setters in RU. The move comes with the ability to bring a weakened Pokemon back into the game and completely change the outcome of the match. Psyshock is Mesprit's preferred STAB move, since it hits most of its intended targets, such as Virizion, Venusaur, and Hitmonlee hard on their weak Defense stats. Dazzling Gleam hits a good number of opposing Dark-types like Spiritomb, Absol, Scrafty, and Sneasel for some significant damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment is used to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed EVs and a Timid nature are preferred so that Mesprit can outspeed Jolly Absol, Adamant Hitmonlee, and Adamant Sawk, as well as Speed tie with Timid Venusaur and Jolly Medicham, which can be crucial in a one-on-one matchup. Investing 40 EVs in Defense makes switching into Medicham a bit easier while still allowing Mesprit to outspeed Jolly Absol, Adamant Hitmonlee, and Adamant Sawk. However, Mesprit misses out on the Speed tie against Venusaur, which can be detrimental, especially on offense teams, where switch-ins aren't a luxury. Colbur Berry lets Mesprit effectively lure and weaken opposing Dark-types by taking any one unboosted Dark-type attack and retaliating; at the same time, it becomes a better Fighting-type check by being able to tank Knock Off.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Thanks to it being pretty difficult to OHKO, having an average Speed tier, and being able to generate good offensive pressure inmediately, Mesprit is a very safe Pokemon to lead with. It can also force out pretty much every Fighting- and Poison-type, so see this as an opportunity to set up Stealth Rock. Don't switch it around too hastily, as having decent bulk but no method of recovery means that it can easily be put into KO range by unboosted Dark-type attacks and be left unable to check Fighting-types like Virizion anymore, so be wary about Mesprit's health. Use Healing Wish as a way to generate offensive momentum by curing a Pokemon from a crippling status condition such as burn, sleep, or paralysis. Alternatively, use it so that a weakened Pokemon gets back to full HP in case you need it throughout the match or, when Mesprit's role has been fulfilled for the game, as a way to safely bring in a Pokemon on your team, even if it isn't severely weakened.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers like Mega Glalie and Emboar really appreciate the Healing Wish support Mesprit provides, since their main STAB moves cause them to take recoil, so getting them back to full health to keep spamming their STAB moves is really appreciated. Spikes setters like Accelgor, Qwilfish and Mega Glalie form a great offensive hazard-stacking core alongside Mesprit—Qwilfish through its utility with Taunt and Thunder Wave, Accelgor and Mega Glalie through offensive pressure. All these Pokemon appreciate Healing Wish, since they don't have any means of reliable recovery. Setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Virizion, Dragon Dance Scrafty, Swords Dance Drapion,, Shell Smash Omastar, and Swords Dance Fletchinder really appreciate being able to be played more recklessly and having a second chance to sweep thanks to Mesprit's support.</p> <p>Dark-types like Sneasel, Spiritomb, Absol, Houndoom, and Drapion pair really well with Mesprit, since it appreciates these Pokemon getting rid of Psychic-types like Sigilyph, Meloetta, and Delphox. Fighting-types such as Gurdurr, Hariyama, Virizion, Sawk, Medicham, and Poliwrath are also good partners so that Mesprit doesn't feel pressured to use its Colbur Berry to check Dark-types. Other Psychic-types also pair really well with Mesprit, since it can weaken opposing Dark-types, giving Pokemon like Delphox, Meloetta, and Sigilyph an easier time.</p>"

  "Emboar": {
    "overview": "<p>Emboar is one of the most fearsome wallbreakers in the tier thanks to its ability Reckless. This ability significantly powers up Emboar's main STAB move, Flare Blitz, allowing it to hit extremely hard even against resisted targets. Apart from its excellent STAB type combination, Emboar has a solid offensive movepool with coverage options such as Wild Charge and Sucker Punch. Emboar's typing allows it to check common offensive threats such as Escavalier and Houndoom. In addition, Emboar sports a fair amount of versatility, as it can use a Choice Band to wallbreak, a Choice Scarf to revenge kill faster threats, as well as a defensive set to take advantage of its unique typing. However, common Water-types such as Qwilfish, Jellicent, and Alomomola prevent Emboar from continually spamming its strongest attacks. Unfortunately, Emboar has a fairly average Speed stat, leaving it outsped by common offensive Pokemon such as Meloetta, Delphox, and Mesprit; Emboar is also quickly worn down by Flare Blitz recoil and entry hazards.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A mixed set with Superpower, Fire Blast, Sucker Punch, and Grass Knot plays as a wallbreaker in a slightly different way, but is significantly weaker with Blaze over Reckless. Flame Charge can be used as an alternate way to alleviate Emboar's lackluster Speed. Bulk Up boosts Emboar's Attack and Defense, but Emboar struggles to fit it into a moveset. Endeavor cripples bulky Pokemon after Emboar has been brought down to low HP, and also works well in tandem with Substitute. Emboar can also run the combination of Substitute + Focus Punch, alongside other moves like Flare Blitz and Toxic, in order to gain an advantage against statusing Pokemon such as Alomomola, making sure to at least run both 176 HP EVs and 224 SpD EVs in order to not have your Substitute broken by Seismic Toss and to allow Emboar to always be able to use Substitute against Alomomola's Scald.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Emboar is quickly worn down from entry hazards, potential poison damage, and Flare Blitz recoil, which is generally its main attack.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Delphox, Meloetta, and Mesprit can revenge kill non-Choice Scarf Emboar with ease. However, none of these can switch in, especially if Stealth Rock is up. Note that all of these Pokemon must be wary of a Sucker Punch from Expert Belt Emboar. Fletchinder OHKOes Emboar with Acrobatics and can take advantage of Choice Scarf Emboar locked into Superpower in order to set up a Swords Dance. In most cases, non-Choice Scarf Emboar is usually outsped by most opposing offensive Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon that Resist Fire</strong>: Bulky Water- and Rock-type Pokemon such as Quagsire, Qwilfish, Seismitoad, Alomomola, Jellicent, Rhyperior, and Regirock can switch into some of Emboar's STAB moves, but must be wary of coverage moves. Alomomola takes a massive amount of damage from a Choice Band-boosted Wild Charge, but has no trouble taking a Flare Blitz or Superpower. Rhyperior and Regirock deter Emboar from spamming Flare Blitz, but must be cautious of Superpower.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is an extremely powerful STAB move backed by Reckless, and deals massive damage to anything that does not resist it. Superpower is a strong secondary STAB move that hits Rock-types such as Rhyperior and Scrafty for solid damage. Superpower also hits Houndoom, which can potentially switch into a Flare Blitz and gain a Flash Fire boost. Wild Charge provides important coverage on bulky Water-types, particularly Alomomola and Jellicent. Sucker Punch alleviates Emboar's lackluster Speed as a form of priority, hitting faster Pokemon such as Meloetta and Hitmonlee.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread is standard for an offensive Pokemon, with maximum Attack investment to hit as hard as possible and maximum Speed investment to outspeed the majority of defensive Pokemon. An Adamant nature is used for the significant boost in power, but a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed threats such as neutral-natured Exploud and Samurott. Reckless is Emboar's best ability, providing a heavy boost in power to Flare Blitz and Wild Charge. Choice Band amplifies Emboar's wallbreaking ability, while an Expert Belt can be used to bluff a Choice item. Life Orb is also an option, but keep in mind that Emboar gets worn down incredibly fast when using it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is generally the best move to go for, as it deals heavy damage to anything that does not resist it and still puts a hefty chunk in bulky Pokemon such as Jellicent. Use the appropriate coverage move to hit the respective target, such as using Wild Charge on a predicted switch into a bulky Water-type such as Qwilfish, Jellicent, and Alomomola. Emboar does a solid job of forcing out various Bug-, Dark-, and Steel-types such as Houndoom and Escavalier, but Emboar is not the most reliable switch-in to them in fear of losing its item or taking a heavy hit.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Psychic-types such as Mesprit and Meloetta appreciate Emboar's ability to check and consistently pressure Dark-, Bug-, and Steel-types. Mesprit is a notable partner that provides Stealth Rock support to wear down Emboar's switch-ins as well as Healing Wish to heal Emboar after it has taken damage from attacks and Flare Blitz recoil. Setup sweepers such as Samurott make for good teammates, as they appreciate Emboar's incredible wallbreaking ability. A slow Volt Switch or U-turn from the likes of Flygon, Lanturn, and Rotom-C is helpful to get Emboar in safely.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is a powerful STAB move that OHKOes or at least deals massive damage to the offensive Pokemon that Choice Scarf Emboar is used to revenge kill such as Virizion. Superpower is a secondary STAB move that targets Rock- and Dark-types such as Rhyperior and Houndoom, and also has the added benefit of not having recoil damage. Wild Charge hits bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Alomomola, but it is fairly weak without a boosting item. Toxic is mainly just filler, but it can be used as a last-ditch effort to hinder Pokemon Emboar cannot dent, such as Seismitoad.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread is standard for an offensive Pokemon with maximum Attack and Speed investment to hit as hard as possible. A Jolly nature is necessary to outspeed threats such as Sneasel and Virizion. Reckless is the preferred ability to boost the power of Flare Blitz and Wild Charge.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>With a Choice Scarf equipped, Emboar acts as a great revenge killer to threats such as Sneasel, Houndoom, and Virizion, and should be played as such. Flare Blitz is generally the best attack to go for, as even Pokemon that resist it take a hefty chunk of damage. Use the appropriate coverage move to hit their targets, such as using Superpower on a predicted switch into Rhyperior or Houndoom, aiming to absorb a Flare Blitz. Despite resisting their STAB moves, Emboar should avoid switching into the likes of Escavalier and Shiftry, as losing its item to Knock Off is extremely detrimental because Emboar would no longer be able to revenge the threats it is supposed to.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As this set works best as a late-game cleaner, wallbreakers such as Clawitzer pair well with it. Psychic-types in general make for solid partners, as they greatly appreciate Emboar's ability to check Dark-, Steel-, and Bug-types. Mesprit is a notable one, as it provides Healing Wish support to heal Emboar after it has been weakened from Flare Blitz recoil. Pokemon with Volt Switch or U-turn are good teammates to bring Emboar in safely, such as Lanturn, Meloetta, and Liepard.</p>"

  "Samurott": {
    "overview": "<p>Samurott is a somewhat underrated Water-type in RU, but it has quite a few things going for it, such as its great offensive stats and access to both physical and special STAB moves, allowing it to use physical and special sets. Its large movepool also includes Swords Dance, Megahorn, Ice Beam, Grass Knot, and Knock Off, which lets it deal with most defensive Pokemon. It is particularly noteworthy that Samurott can fill the archetype of an offensive Water-type while simultaneously beating Slowking with the aforementioned Megahorn. Special sets are capable of using Taunt to break through most defensive cores, while physical sets can utilize Aqua Jet to defeat revenge killers. Also, Samurott's decent bulk and Water typing are both useful defensively. However, Samurott's Speed is quite low for a sweeper, which holds back Swords Dance sets. Special sets face stiff competition from Clawitzer, another Water-type wallbreaker with higher Special Attack and stronger coverage thanks to Mega Launcher, though Samurott boasts a higher Speed tier, a stronger Water-type STAB move for neutral targets, and key access to Taunt and Aqua Jet for utility over Clawitzer.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Samurott has a pretty neat movepool but lacks the stats to effectively use it. Substitute is usable on the special set in conjunction with a Salac Berry to surprise offensive teams. However, Samurott would need to give up coverage and would absolutely need Toxic Spikes support to make it work reliably. Samurott can utilize Substitute + Dragon Tail in conjunction with Scald and Taunt for a more defensive set, but there are better defensive bulky Water-types in RU and Samurott lacks reliable recovery options. Surf can be used on the special attacker set, but the large power reduction from Hydro Pump is generally never worth it. Aqua Tail is stronger, but less accurate than Waterfall. Shell Armor can prevent Samurott from being KOed by an untimely critical hit, but Torrent generally has better use, powering up Samurott's STAB moves. Choice Band and Choice Specs are options that Samurott can use. However, the Choice Band set suffers from a STAB move with a somewhat low Base Power, while a Choice Specs set hurts Samurott, as it cannot utilize its coverage moves. Encore or Taunt can be used on the Swords Dance set, but Samurott doesn't really have the room to fit either move on the set. Finally, Hidden Power Fire can be used on the special set if getting past Assault Vest Escavalier is an absolute must for Samurott's team; however, it offers nothing useful outside of this.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Outside of a few Pokemon, outright countering Samurott is very difficult until you figure out the set it's running. Checks and counters to the Swords Dance set tend to lose to the special set and vice versa. However, both sets are perfectly manageable once they're revealed.</p> <p><strong>Virizion</strong>: Virizion only fears Ice Beam from the special set and a possible boosted Megahorn from physical sets. It outspeeds and threatens to deal heavy damage or a KO with its Grass-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Quagsire</strong>: Quagsire stops Swords Dance Samurott cold thanks to Unaware and Samurott's lack of a physical Grass-type move. It's completely useless against the special set, however, being OHKOed by Grass Knot.</p> <p><strong>Specially bulky Pokemon</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon are generally the safest initial switch-ins, as the Swords Dance set needs a turn to set up. Mega Audino, Aromatisse, Bronzong, and Registeel are among the specially bulkiest Pokemon in RU. However, all of them except Aromatisse can be shut down by Taunt and are forced out if Samurott reveals Swords Dance on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Samurott's average base 70 Speed, faster foes that can survive an Aqua Jet, such as Rotom-C and Meloetta, can easily revenge kill Samurott. However, only the strongest of neutral physical attacks will OHKO Samurott with no prior damage thanks to its respectable physical bulk.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Samurott's solid base 100 Attack to extremely high levels. Waterfall is the most reliable physical STAB move Samurott gets, and it comes with a 20% flinch chance, which can prove useful at times. Megahorn is generally preferred for coverage, allowing Samurott to push past Alomomola, Gastrodon, Slowking, and Seismitoad reliably. However, Knock Off also is a viable option if a more reliable way to deal with Jellicent and Qwilfish is needed; its ability to remove items can also help Samurott or a teammate later on. Aqua Jet is required in the last slot due to Samurott's mediocre Speed. With Aqua Jet, Samurott is able to pick off weakened revenge killers. Razor Shell deserves a mention for its 50% chance to lower the foe's Defense, which can allow Samurott to push past Quagsire, an otherwise difficult task. Waterfall, however, is better in virtually every other situation.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs allow Samurott to hit as hard and as fast as possible. An Adamant nature is preferred for the power boost; with it, Samurott still outspeeds prominent wallbreakers such as Exploud, Scrafty, Adamant Emboar, and Clawitzer. Lum Berry is the preferred item on Samurott thanks to the protection it grants Samurott when setting up. Life Orb is a viable option for the increase in damage output, as well as being able to ease Samurott into Torrent range for even stronger STAB moves with the recoil damage. A bulkier spread of 132 HP / 252 Atk / 124 Spe with an Adamant nature can be used to give Samurott some extra bulk while still outspeeding defensive variants of Qwilfish. With this spread, Mystic Water is advised over Life Orb if you want the power boost, as passive damage would be detrimental to such a set. Finally, Samurott can make use of a Rindo or Wacan Berry, which reduce damage taken from Grass- and Electric-type moves, respectively, allowing Samurott to potentially get past the likes of Virizion or Jolteon in a pinch. These are especially useful with the bulkier spread, as Samurott has more HP to work with.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Samurott typically wants to force out Pokemon weak to Water-types, such as Rhyperior and Mega Camerupt, and use the opportunity to set up a Swords Dance on the switch. Thanks to its high Attack, Samurott can also pick off weakened Pokemon with Aqua Jet if needed. As Samurott can avoid status once thanks to Lum Berry, setting up on defensive Pokemon, such as Alomomola and Uxie, that depend on status to stop Samurott is highly advised. With Life Orb, Samurott wants to preserve as much of its HP as possible to handle Life Orb recoil and priority attacks. Samurott can take some neutral physical attacks during setup with the bulkier spread if it has to. When using a Rindo or Wacan Berry, make sure Samurott is kept in relatively good health so that it can make use of them against Virizion and Jolteon at the right moment. As is the case with most other setup sweepers, you will generally want to avoid using Swords Dance until Samurott's checks and counters are removed or sufficiently weakened. Make sure that faster Pokemon that can usually survive Aqua Jet can be KOed by it or removed entirely before trying to sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Samurott appreciates having support from wallbreakers, such as Emboar, Meloetta, and Flygon, most of which also have some defensive synergy with Samurott as well. Pokemon capable of providing paralysis support, such as Uxie, defensive Druddigon, and some Togetic variants, are also useful. Druddigon is the most notable thanks to its Grass and Electric resistances and tendency to lure in bulky Water-types, especially Alomomola, for Samurott to set up on. However, Sticky Web support can also be used in place of paralysis support, so Sticky Web users such as Smeargle can also make for good partners. Without Knock Off, Samurott appreciates teammates that can handle Jellicent, as well as Qwilfish to a lesser extent. Pursuit users, such as Drapion, Spiritomb, and Houndoom, make for great partners, as they can remove Jellicent with ease. Most special attackers have little to fear from Qwilfish and can 2HKO it reliably due to its low special bulk, so they also are useful partners. If Samurott doesn't carry Megahorn, answers to Venusaur and Alomomola are appreciated. Fire- and Flying-types, such as Emboar, Delphox, and Braviary, generally force out Venusaur, while Grass- and Electric-types, such as Jolteon and Virizion, generally handle Alomomola well. Though Samurott can handle Grass-types with a Rindo Berry, a check to fast Grass-types such as Rotom-C and Virizion is still appreciated. Rotom-C is usually handled by Grass-types of your own, such as Venusaur and Virizion, whilst Virizion can generally be handled by Sigilyph and Choice Scarf Delphox.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is used as a STAB move, as it is extremely powerful. Ice Beam allows Samurott to easily KO common checks to physical Samurott such as Druddigon and Flygon; faster Grass-types, such as Virizion, Venusaur, and Rotom-C, need to be caught on the switch, however. Grass Knot handles every common Water-type immunity, OHKOing Seismitoad and Gastrodon, as well as 2HKOing Jellicent, while also providing a reliable move to handle Rhyperior with. Taunt is generally preferred for the final slot, as it can shut down the likes of Bronzong and Registeel, which Samurott cannot get past easily, as well as being effectively used thanks to Samurott's great Speed stat as a wallbreaker. Aqua Jet is quite weak without investment, but it allows Samurott to pick off a weakened revenge killer, possibly forcing the opponent to take a heavy hit to KO Samurott. While Knock Off, Megahorn, and Superpower seem like interesting options, they are simply not worth it, as the primary targets of Knock Off and Megahorn are already 2HKOed by Samurott's moves and Registeel is better handled by Taunt than Superpower.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack EVs are used to make Samurott an effective special wallbreaker. 252 Speed EVs are also used with a Modest nature, allowing Samurott to outspeed Exploud, Scrafty, Clawitzer, and Adamant Emboar. Samurott should use a Rash nature if Aqua Jet is used and the 4 Defense EVs should be shifted to Attack. Life Orb is used for the boost in damage output and is the best item for this set due to Samurott's reliance on its coverage moves and Hydro Pump's raw power to get around its checks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Samurott should heavily damage walls whenever possible, so actively seek out chances to bring it in against passive Pokemon it forces out, such as Rhyperior, Alomomola, and Jellicent. Hydro Pump is Samurott's safest move to use, as every common Pokemon immune to Water-type moves in RU is beaten by Grass Knot. Ice Beam can catch Grass-types such as Venusaur and Virizion on the switch, which otherwise can survive a hit and KO Samurott. Hitting Rotom-C on the switch isn't as necessary due to their lower special bulk, but it is still useful to take less recoil damage from having to hit twice. Grass Knot should only really be used against Pokemon immune to Water-type moves, such as Jellicent and Seismitoad, as well as against Rhyperior, being a 100% accurate move that still OHKOes it. Taunt should be used to shut down defensive Pokemon Samurott can't immediately break through such as Bronzong and Registeel. Without the ability to use Toxic and Thunder Wave, respectively, Samurott can either choose to push past them on its own or bring in a teammate with relatively no risk to possibly sweep. Aqua Jet shouldn't be used until Samurott enters Torrent range unless it's absolutely necessary to use to remove a threat, as it is somewhat weak without investment. Torrent also makes Hydro Pump extremely powerful, so Hydro Pump can be spammed with greater ease.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Samurott can easily KO Ground-, Water- and Grass-type Pokemon, so teammates that appreciate the removal of these types are ideal. Choice Scarf Delphox enjoys Rhyperior and Jellicent dealt with; Samurott can Taunt slower entry hazard users while Delphox checks Virizion with a Choice Scarf. Jolteon and Rotom-C are notable Electric-types that enjoy the removal of bulky Ground- and Grass-types which can also switch into Electric-type moves aimed at Samurott. Taunted walls are rendered setup bait for powerful sweepers. For example, a Taunted Hex Jellicent can do nothing to prevent Calm Mind variants of Meloetta from setting up. Other setup sweepers to consider taking advantage of under such circumstances include Nasty Plot Houndoom, Fletchinder, and Virizion. While not mandatory, paralysis support allows Samurott to perform better against offensive teams. Uxie, defensive Druddigon, and certain Togetic variants can provide paralysis support while Samurott can Taunt clerics, with the exception of Aromatisse, to prevent them from healing their team. Sticky Web support from Smeargle is also viable, and Samurott can Taunt slower Defog users, such as Golbat, Togetic, and Pelipper, preventing the removal of Sticky Web.</p>"

  "Liepard": {
    "overview": "<p>Liepard fits mostly on offensively based teams, providing support with Encore or Thunder Wave. As a Prankster user, Liepard faces competition from Mega Banette, which has superior bulk and Attack and access to Will-O-Wisp, but Liepard has U-turn, a good Speed tier, Encore, and Dark-type STAB over Mega Banette. Liepard is frail and can be taken out by faster threats or certain priority moves, but it can outpace most of them with a Prankster Encore and its high base Speed. Liepard is overshadowed by Shiftry, Houndoom, and Scrafty offensively, but it has a niche in its utility, U-turn, and Encore.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A weather support set in combination with Prankster could be effective on either rain or sun teams, but it is only good on those specific archetypes, although it still should be considered for any weather team. Taunt could also be used to prevent status and setup moves, but Liepard's mediocre bulk and defensive typing can make it difficult to use. Foul Play can punish physical attackers, but Liepard's moves hit as hard as needed already. A Nasty Plot + Copycat combination can be used, but it is a questionable gimmick that is further held back by Liepard's frailty. Toxic can help Liepard deal with annoying walls such as Alomomola. Hone Claws can be used to boost Liepard's Attack, but Liepard's frailty makes it hard to set up without being KOed. Trick can be used alongside an unfavorable item, such as Iron Ball or Ring Target, to cripple foes, but Liepard prefers an item it can benefit from. Leftovers could be used over Black Glasses to recover from weak hits, but running it takes away from Liepard's damage output.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Aromatisse, Togetic, and other Fairy-types resist Liepard's Dark-type moves and can fire back with status or their Fairy-type STAB attacks. Aromatisse in particular can block Encore and Taunt due to Aroma Veil and can recover with Wish, while Togetic can cripple Liepard with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Virizion, Gurdurr, and other Fighting-types resist Liepard's Dark-type moves and can OHKO it with Fighting-type moves. Virizion in particular easily walls it. Choice Scarf users can outpace it as well.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Burn and paralysis cripple Liepard, as the former halves its Attack and the latter quarters its Speed. Alomomola has great physical bulk and access to Scald to potentially burn Liepard.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Encore allows Liepard to stop setup sweepers such as Virizion or cripple annoying walls such as Alomomola. Similarly, it can prevent the use of Rapid Spin or Defog by locking a foe into a different move. Due to Prankster and Liepard's high Speed, Encore can lock setup sweepers into their boosting moves before they can do anything; for example, it can lock Kabutops and Fletchinder into Swords Dance and disallow them to use their dangerous attacks. Knock Off is a reliable STAB move that removes a foe's item and knocks out Pokemon such as Meloetta, Delphox, and Sigilyph. U-turn works great in combination with Encore, as it almost guarantees a free switch if a foe has been locked into an unfavorable move by Encore and will get damage on the opponent's switch-in. Sucker Punch is useful for picking off weakened threats and can outprioritize other priority moves due to Liepard's high Speed. Pursuit is an option in place of Sucker Punch, as it can trap and deal massive damage against Ghost- and Psychic-types attempting to switch out. Thunder Wave can also be used in the last spot to cripple fast attackers such as Virizion and Sneasel.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack EVs paired with a Jolly nature allow Liepard to be as fast and hit as hard as it can. An Adamant nature might seem tempting, but the boost in power is simply not worth being outsped by threats such as Houndoom and Delphox. Black Glasses is used to give a boost to Liepard's STAB moves and is what makes Liepard's Knock Off capable of OHKOing and 2HKOing Pokemon such as Meloetta and Medicham.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Liepard relies on offensive presence to keep foes from getting free switches, while Encore can cripple a Pokemon attempting to set up. Liepard is severely crippled by status, as a burn takes away its offensive presence and paralysis lessens its speed. Switch in Liepard against Pokemon with low offensive presence or if you predict a sweeper to use a boosting move; however, be cautious of an attacking or status move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Seeing as Liepard tends to force switches, entry hazard setters such as Rhyperior, Accelgor, and Qwilfish can set up Stealth Rock and Spikes, respectively, and get more damage per switch. For the same reason, Liepard can allow offensive threats such as Delphox, Virizion, and Gurdurr to come into the field without taking damage. Liepard is countered by Virizion, which can gain a Justified boost from switching into its Dark-type moves, as well as outpace and OHKO it. Fletchinder and Venusaur can take on Virizion and other Fighting-types that trouble it.</p>"

  "Audino": {
    "overview": "<p>Audino's decent bulk, okay typing, ability, and wide defensive movepool allow it to fill certain roles; for example, it is able to function as an effective Wish passer. Audino faces competition from Alomomola, from whom Audino sets itself apart through its access to Heal Bell. Mega Audino can take on the role of a Calm Mind sweeper with Rest and Sleep Talk. However, Audino and Mega Audino both have little to no offensive presence and are thus extremely passive. In offensive roles, Aromatisse is a huge competitor thanks to its higher power and the fact that it doesn't need to Mega Evolve. Mega Audino trades Regenerator for Healer, which also means that it faces problems recovering health due to its lack of Leftovers. Non-Mega Audino's is blessed and cursed with a Normal typing, which provides no resistances in exchange for just one weakness. Audino suffers from a case of four-moveslot syndrome in both forms and is very easily set up on thanks to this; it is also completely shut down by Taunt.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Blast is useful to hit Steel-types, but once it is revealed it loses its usefulness. Psyshock hits Poison-types and beats other Calm Mind users one-on-one but gets fairly poor coverage and lacks STAB. Reflect and Light Screen are options as a Regenerator pivot, but it's generally not that useful of a combination and better Pokemon such as Uxie can pull it off. Thunder Wave and Toxic are useful to spread status. Audino can fit on Trick Room teams, as it has access to Trick Room. Shadow Ball could be used as coverage but it's pretty average as a whole. As a weather pivot, Audino could be used, as it learns Rain Dance and Sunny Day, but it's generally mediocre in this role.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Setup Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that are able to set up walk all over Audino because Mega Audino's offensive presence is nonexistent and thus Pokemon such as Substitute + Calm Mind Meloetta, Dragon Dance Scrafty, Swords Dance Escavalier, and Nasty Plot Houndoom give it problems. Scrafty is hit very hard by Dazzling Gleam from Mega Audino, so it must be wary.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Dazzling Gleam and Knock Off are weak, so without boosts Audino will fail to hurt much. Taunt also prevents Audino from using Wish or Heal Bell, its main niche. Taunt could come from Qwilfish, Drapion, or Golbat.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types, such as Bronzong and Escavalier, resist Dazzling Gleam and smack Mega Audino with their STAB moves. These Pokemon are able to pivot into Dazzling Gleam and shrug it off with ease.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types hit non-Mega Audino for super effective damage; though they cannot easily break through Mega Audino. These Pokemon have to watch out for Dazzling Gleam, though.</p> <p><strong>Phazing and Haze</strong>: Getting Audino off the field will mess up its Wish chain and remove any boosts it has on the Calm Mind set. This could come from Whirlwind Drapion or Roar Rhyperior.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wish keeps Audino healthy and can be passed to Audino's teammates for them to recover a large chunk of health. Heal Bell rids Audino's team of status, and is especially helpful for removing poison caused by Toxic. Protect can be useful to scout for moves but is mainly used to ensure Wish takes effect and to allow Audino to slowly recover health via Leftovers; in just two turns, Audino is able to recover 62% of its health, on top of Regenerator, making Audino able to recover 95% health in just three turns. Knock Off is extremely weak, but it is used for its utility in removing Leftovers, Eviolite, and other items. Instead of Knock Off, both Encore and Return are options. Encore prevents Audino from becoming setup fodder, while Return is a consistent and semi-powerful STAB move. However, if you choose to run Encore, Audino will be stopped by Taunt. When using Audinite, Dazzling Gleam should be run in the last slot. If another teammate is already providing Heal Bell or Aromatherapy support, then Toxic is a very useful option in this slot because it means Audino can actually cripple Pokemon it's supposed to wall.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Audinite is an option because it provides Audino with a fantastic Fairy typing and much more bulk. However, Leftovers and Regenerator give it fair competition. Maximum Special Defense investment is used to better take and pivot out of special attacks from the likes of Choice Scarf Rotom-C, Sigilyph, Jolteon, Choice Scarf Meloetta, and Mega Camerupt. A Careful nature is chosen to further increase Audino's bulk. Regenerator is extremely useful because it allows Audino to regain health just by switching and works well in tandem with Wish.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Audino should be played like a typical defensive Pokemon: switch into hits it's able to take and go from there. Abusing Regenerator to the fullest is a good place to start when using Audino; it shouldn't be afraid to switch. If you fear that a setup sweeper is coming in, the best course of option is to immediately switch out to a partner. Wish can be used to recover health, but it's often going to be passed to a teammate. Heal Bell is a bit rarer because status isn't nearly as widespread, but it's useful nonetheless; just don't expect to be using it too often. Protect is useful to scout for Fighting-type coverage and ensure Wish is received, so be sure to take advantage of its uses!</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steel-types, such as Registeel, and Bronzong when not running Audinite, make for good partners because of the synergy between them and Audino. Audino is best used on balanced teams for its cleric capabilities and ability to pass Wish. Alomomola can be run alongside Audino to form a Regenerator core, but it and Audino's roles are very similar and it is a bit redundant to use them together. Typical defensive Pokemon, such as Registeel, Lanturn, Bronzong, and Spiritomb, that lack instant recovery are good partners as well. Not-so-defensive Pokemon that also appreciate Wish support include Kabutops, Seismitoad, Druddigon, Rhyperior, and Escavalier.</p>"
      },
      "Mega Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Mega Audino's fantastic coverage moves and decent base 80 Special Attack stat make it a great lure and a proficient tank that is capable of dishing out some serious damage while utilizing its great bulk and support movepool to pivot out of weaker offensive threats and support its team. Dazzling Gleam is Mega Audino's best STAB move and is used to take out Hitmonlee and Medicham and deal good neutral damage to Drapion and Jolteon. Fire Blast is used to fry the various Steel-types that like to switch in on Mega Audino, such as Cobalion and Bronzong, and do a significant amount of damage to Grass-types such as Virizion and Rotom-C. Surf pulverizes both Rhyperior and Mega Camerupt while dealing with the Pokemon that can stomach Mega Audino's other two attacks, mainly Fire-types such as Fletchinder and Delphox. Healing Wish is used late-game to restore a teammate of choice to full health and is used when Mega Audino is worn down or has done its job in luring out a specific target.</p> <p>Psychic is an alternative coverage move that can be quite useful by preventing Garbodor, Qwilfish, and other Poison-types from freely switching in on Mega Audino and setting up multiple layers of entry hazards. Grass Knot is another workable coverage move that can OHKO certain Rhyperior sets and hit Omastar and Seismitoad for good damage. Thunder Wave can also work well by preventing overly ambitious setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Delphox from coming in on Audino and setting up. Knock Off can also find use by crippling the various defensive Pokemon that can freely switch in on Mega Audino otherwise, mainly Alomomola, Aromatisse, and Uxie. Hyper Voice may seem tempting to use, but keep in mind that Mega Audino is absolutely dependent on hitting its targets super effectively in order to deal any real damage, so more often than not, Mega Audino will usually find Hyper Voice a waste of a moveslot in contrast to its various coverage and support moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A base 80 Special Attack stat with no boosting item is far from impressive for a Mega Evolution; as such, Mega Audino needs to max out its Special Attack stat in order for it to not hit like a wet paper bag. The rest of the EVs are best invested into its HP stat, as Audino appreciates the ability to pivot out of weaker offensive threats via Regenerator before it Mega Evolves. Furthermore, there aren't many specific targets that Mega Audino must outspeed, making Speed investment unnecessary. Audinite is a given as the item of choice, as Audino needs it to Mega Evolve and gain Fairy STAB and the extra 20 points in its Special Attack stat.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Contrary to what would usually be expected, Audino does not need to Mega Evolve immediately, as it can make use of Regenerator to pivot in and out of weaker special attackers such as Choice Scarf Rotom-C and Mesprit; in fact, it is advised to only Mega Evolve Audino if the Special Attack boost, extra bulk, or Fairy typing is needed. This Audino works best as a lure for certain offensive threats that appreciate bulky Steel-types out of the way in order to sweep, such as Drapion. Mega Audino can also be a very helpful teammate for Escavalier by weakening Rhyperior and Mega Camerupt.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Getting rid of Steel-type walls and other bulky Pokemon with exploitable weaknesses is what this Pokemon excels at, so pairing it with Swords Dance Drapion is a good place to start, as Audino can draw in some of their strongest checks while they can turn the tables on the bulky Psychic-types that threaten to exploit Mega Audino's middling offenses. Choice Scarf users such as Emboar that require certain tanks out of their way to clean would appreciate Audino as a teammate, as it can take out Rhyperior for Emboar.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind boosts Mega Audino's Special Defense to very great heights and boosts its mediocre Special Attack to a somewhat threatening level. Rest and Sleep Talk restore Mega Audino's health and remove any harmful status instantly. Sleep Talk can also pick Calm Mind while Mega Audino is asleep to continue to boost. Dazzling Gleam is Mega Audino's attacking move and is used over Hyper Voice because nothing is immune to it and Dazzling Gleam gets very good neutral coverage. Flamethrower is an option to hit Steel-types, but then Mega Audino is walled by Houndoom and gives it free setup turns, and Dazzling Gleam is more useful in general.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Defense and HP investment and a Bold nature increase Mega Audino's physical bulk because Calm Mind boosts Mega Audino's Special Defense. Audinite boosts Audino's bulk all-around and gives it a useful Fairy typing. Regenerator is super useful pre-Mega Evolution because it allows Audino to shrug off damage and recover health for later in the match.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Save Mega Evolving Audino until later in the match so it is able to take advantage of Regenerator. After Mega Evolving, Mega Audino is better equipped to take on Dragon-types so keep this in mind when choosing the specific time to Mega Evolve. Mega Audino faces massive competition from Aromatisse, which is more powerful off the bat, has a better typing, and is immune to Taunt, so Audino has to be careful to use Regenerator and its ability to Mega Evolve to the fullest or it runs the risk of being outclassed. Mega Audino's only coverage is Fairy, so don't try to set up too early or Mega Audino will be forced out. Thus, beginning to set up with Calm Mind mid- or late-game is often best so Mega Audino can attempt a sweep on weakened teams. Mega Audino should only use Rest when it is nearing a bit under 40% health if possible, as Sleep Talk can be a bit unreliable and select Rest instead of Calm Mind or Dazzling Gleam. Mega Audino can switch into Knock Off with ease, so it can also take a pivotal role pre-Mega Evolution.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that eliminate Steel-types, which resist Dazzling Gleam, such as Emboar, makes for good partners. Other Calm Mind users such as Meloetta work well because they can use their coverage moves to be a pain for the opposing team. Golbat takes on Fighting-types for non-Mega Audino and is a useful partner to keep entry hazards away and pivot in with U-turn. Powerful hitters such as Mega Glalie and Mega Camerupt are pains for Mega Audino, thus making defensive Pokemon such as Bronzong and Lanturn good partners. Lanturn is also able to bring in Mega Audino via Volt Switch and can use Heal Bell in case Mega Audino is forced out after using Rest.</p>"

  "Gurdurr": {
    "overview": "<p>Boasting good bulk with an Eviolite, Gurdurr has the ability to take on many of the top threats in RU. With a great boosting option in Bulk Up, it has the power to become a heavy-hitting tank, with access to recovery in the form of Drain Punch. Its movepool also gives it access to Mach Punch, a great priority move that means Gurdurr is not hampered by its low Speed. Knock Off allows Gurdurr to hit most of the tier for neutral damage, aside from Fairy-types. Gurdurr also is less vulnerable to status with Guts, which raises Gurdurr's Attack, allowing it to recover more HP with Drain Punch. However, even with Eviolite, Gurdurr's Special Defense stat is still very low, and most super effective, or even neutral, special attacks have the power to KO it. It is also very reliant on its Eviolite to set up Bulk Up, and therefore Knock Off severely cripples it, lowering both of its defenses.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gurdurr's movepool is extremely expansive and it has multiple other choices, but only a few are viable. Rock Slide or Stone Edge could also be considered to hit Fletchinder. An all-out attacking set with Sheer Force or Iron Fist with a Life Orb is possible, but it really misses out on the bulk provided by Eviolite. It also loses out on the sweeping potential of the Bulk Up set, as it must rely on Mach Punch to hit faster Pokemon, and it has no real way to take hits.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types, such as Venusaur, which only fears Ice Punch, can switch into most of Gurdurr's moves and proceed to stall it out, as Gurdurr cannot recover enough with Drain Punch to outlast the damage it takes. Golbat can come in, as it has a 4x resistance to Fighting-type moves, but has to watch out for Ice Punch and Stone Edge, and it does not really like having its Eviolite taken away.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types are usually able to win in a 1v1 situation; Aromatisse, for example can easily heal off damage taken from Gurdurr and deal damage with Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Fletchinder can switch in on Gurdurr quite easily, only fearing Rock Slide, and hit it super effectively.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: If Gurdurr begins taking too much damage from entry hazards, it becomes much easier to KO, and even the constant damage it gets through attacks can be hard to heal off with Drain Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Drain Punch allows Gurdurr to recover its HP while attacking. Mach Punch gives Gurdurr much-needed priority to back up its low Speed stat and allows it to hit faster special attackers that threaten it. It also allows Gurdurr to act as a revenge killer early-game, as Gurdurr can switch in and KO an opposing Pokemon with Mach Punch before switching out. Knock Off gives Gurdurr very good neutral coverage, only losing out on Fairy- and Dark-types. By removing opposing Pokemon's items, Gurdurr can have an easier time setting up. Poison Jab can be used over Knock Off, as it allows Gurdurr to hurt Fairy-types, but it loses out on coverage against Ghost- and Psychic-types, and loses a lot of utility against stall teams. Bulk Up boosts both Gurdurr's Attack and Defense stats at the same time, allowing it to become almost untouchable with physical attacks. With Ice Punch Gurdurr can more reliably get past Venusaur and Flying-types such as Golbat and Togetic.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs allow Gurdurr to be as bulky as possible, which in turn gives it more chances to set up and tank hits. 252 Attack EVs along with an Adamant nature allow Gurdurr to hit hard before any boosts, which makes it a viable revenge killer along with Mach Punch. This also allows it to recover more HP with Drain Punch before it sets up. Guts gives Gurdurr an Attack boost when affected by a status condition. Eviolite is used to give Gurdurr a boost to its defenses. Maximum Special Defense EVs with a Careful nature is another option, as this allows Gurdurr to set up against special attackers a lot easier. However, Gurdurr then misses out on its role as a revenge killer, and it is forced to set up in order to recover more HP.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>While most of its checks are still around early-game, Gurdurr can be used as a revenge killer with Mach Punch. However, Gurdurr should not be just sent out, as if it is not able to KO the opposing Pokemon it will usually be taking quite a bit of damage, which makes it harder to set up early-game. It should also be careful when it is setting up, as if Poison- and Fairy-types are still around, it has a very hard time getting through them. Against bulky and slower teams, Gurdurr should use Knock Off early-game to remove the opposing team's items.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because Gurdurr hates going up against bulky Poison- and Fairy-types, Pokemon that can remove these are helpful. Meloetta is notable because it can easily remove pokemon such as Golbat and Venusaur which get in Gurdurr's way. Pokemon such as Escavalier pair up nicely with Gurdurr, as it can handle Fairy-types such as Aromatisse for it. With its ability Guts, Gurdurr helps other setup sweepers that do not like taking status themselves. Mega Glalie gets a mention, as it cannot hold a Lum Berry due to it being a Mega Evolution. Because Gurdurr has a hard time getting past bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Meloetta and Cofagrigus, Pursuit users such as Spiritomb and Skuntank, which also carry Sucker Punch, generally pair up well with it.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its excellent Water / Ground typing and ability granting it an immunity to Electric- and Water-type moves, Seismitoad is able to function as a reliable Stealth Rock setter, excelling against the likes of non-Toxic Alomomola and opposing Stealth Rock setters such as Rhyperior. With access to Scald and Toxic, it is able to cripple common Defoggers, and its decent bulk allows it to switch into many physical attackers. Its wide coverage options also make offensive sets viable, although it is hindered by its mediocre Special Attack and 4x weakness to Grass. Notably, it struggles against the likes of Venusaur and Virizion, both of which can freely switch in on it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rocky Helmet is an option on the defensive set to punish physical attackers, specifically U-turn pivots, but this is generally inferior to the passive recovery provided by Leftovers. An offensive set with Life Orb and Swift Swim is an option for rain teams, taking advantage of Seismitoad's coverage options. Finally, an offensive Stealth Rock set can be used but largely decreases its ability to get it up reliably due to fewer opportunities to switch in.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types hit Seismitoad 4x super effectively with their Grass-type STAB moves and thus almost always beat it one-on-one, as it can't do much in return. Furthermore, Pokemon such as Virizion are able to use it as setup fodder. However, Grass-types have to be wary of taking a Toxic on the switch in if not immune or carrying a Lum Berry.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers</strong>: Seismitoad's special bulk is nothing to boast about, so powerful special attackers, such as Delphox, Exploud, Meloetta, and Sigilyph, can all 2HKO or OHKO it. Strong physical attackers such as Choice Band Sawk, Life Orb Hitmonlee, and Choice Band Medicham can also 2HKO it on the switch in.</p> <p><strong>RestTalk Tanks</strong>: Sleep Talk users such as Malamar and Spiritomb can easily take hits from Seismitoad and use it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Status Users</strong>: Status quickly wears Seismitoad down, lowering the ability of the defensive set to get up Stealth Rock reliably and making Substitute on the offensive set a liability.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Seismitoad's ability to reliably get up Stealth Rock makes it essential on this set. Scald is one of the obligatory STAB moves, with an additional 30% chance to burn the foe. Earthquake is the secondary STAB move, hitting Registeel, Jolteon, Drapion, and Jellicent, and is preferred over Earth Power for its ability to OHKO Jolteon and deal more damage to Registeel. Alternatively, Toxic puts defensive walls, such as Alomomola, Slowking, Jellicent, and bulky Grass-types on a timer. Knock Off can cripple bulkier and offensive Pokemon alike by removing their item.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment is used with a Bold nature so that Seismitoad can take on physical attackers effectively by maximizing physical bulk. However, shifting some EVs to Special Defense is an option so Seismitoad can tank hits from Magneton and Diancie better. Water Absorb is used as the ability to deter opposing Pokemon from using Water-type attacks, allowing this set to function excellently against rain teams. Leftovers is used as the item to provide passive recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Seismitoad into resisted moves or non-Choice Band physical attackers to set up Stealth Rock or spread status. Try to wear down opposing walls with Knock Off and Toxic to pave the way for a teammate to sweep late-game. Keep Seismitoad away from Grass-types, as they can all OHKO it, but if you have a dedicated Grass-resistant Pokemon of your own, your opponent might sometimes go for a different coverage option or double switch their Pokemon. However, high-risk plays such as leaving Seismitoad in should only be made if you would lose too much momentum or have a severe matchup disadvantage otherwise. Seismitoad can also stop VoltTurn cores by absorbing Volt Switch from the likes of Jolteon and Magneton, but be wary of a potential Hidden Power Grass from both. This set especially dislikes status, since it can quickly wear Seismitoad down and turn 3HKOs into 2HKOs, so keep it away from poison and burn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Garbodor is an excellent partner for its ability to switch into offensive Fighting- and Grass-types, absorb Toxic Spikes, and form a hazard-stacking core with Seismitoad. Emboar also synergizes well with it, dealing with Grass-types, notably Virizion, while Seismitoad can counter Fletchinder, one of Emboar's biggest checks, and absorb Water-type attacks while wearing down its checks and counters. Additionally, clerics, such as Aromatisse and Diancie, can heal Seismitoad of the status it despises. Pokemon vulnerable to common physical attackers, such as Hoopa, Malamar, and Venusaur, appreciate Seismitoad's ability to take on such attackers. Late-game sweepers and wallbreakers, such as Drapion, Virizion, and Braviary, appreciate the Stealth Rock support Seismitoad provides in wearing down their checks and counters.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Substitute": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is the obligatory STAB move, with a 30% chance to burn the foe, making it Seismitoad's best option for hitting physical attackers. Earth Power is the secondary STAB move, hitting Registeel and Diancie super effectively and Venusaur neutrally. Substitute allows Seismitoad to avoid detrimental status, scout a foe's moveset, and sometimes achieve more than one KO, as it can let Seismitoad easily take Pokemon that would otherwise cripple it, such as Alomomola, on one-on-one. Toxic is the preferred option in the last moveslot, crippling bulky Water- and Grass-types that like to switch in on Seismitoad more reliably than Scald. Finally, Endeavor is an option for Seismitoad to weaken or pick off slower Pokemon while behind its Substitute and can also put faster offensive threats in range of priority.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment allows Seismitoad to deal as much damage as possible, and maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature allow it to put in a Substitute against most defensive Pokemon and outspeed threats such as Adamant Gallade, Sawk, Adamant Absol, Choice Specs Magneton, Substitute Braviary, and Choice Band Emboar. Leftovers is the preferred item the majority of the time, providing passive recovery, which is essential to maintaining Seismitoad's longevity behind a Substitute. Alternatively, Salac Berry allows it to function as a late-game sweeper once it can no longer put in Substitutes, as it allows it to outspeed Jolteon, Aerodactyl, Sneasel, and Choice Scarf Emboar. Water Absorb is used as the ability to ease switching in on opposing Water-types.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Avoid switching Seismitoad in on potential status-inducing moves, which drastically decrease the effectiveness of this set, rendering Substitute practically useless. As such, bring it in on resisted hits or a predicted utility move, such as Wish or Stealth Rock. Set up Substitute on Pokemon that don't threaten Seismitoad; common examples are bulky Water-types and defensive walls that rely on status, such as Alomomola. A benefit of having maximum Speed investment is that this set can bluff a defensive spread, lure Choice Specs Magneton trying to go for Hidden Power Grass, and eliminate it with Earth Power.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types, such as Alomomola, Flygon, and Diancie, make for good partners, as they appreciate Seismitoad's ability to lure Grass- and Water-types and threaten or eliminate them. Fletchinder especially benefits from this set's ability to weaken its common checks, notably Alomomola and Diancie. Pokemon like Venusaur, Garbodor, and Braviary that take on the Grass-types that force Seismitoad out also synergize well with it. Magneton is able to deal with Pokemon this set struggles to break, such as Golbat and Venusaur. Clerics such as Diancie, Mega Audino, and Aromatisse can heal this set of any status, which is especially detrimental to it. Mega Audino has the added bonus of being able to switch in on Venusaur before it Mega Evolves thanks to Regenerator.</p>"

  "Sawk": {
    "overview": "<p>Sawk is a fantastic wallbreaker in RU thanks to its great STAB in Close Combat and wide array of coverage moves that make it extremely threatening against defensive teams. Furthermore, it has a decent Speed stat, allowing it to outspeed all defensive Pokemon in the tier such as Uxie and Venusaur, as well as some offensive ones such as Medicham and Meloetta. Sawk also has a good ability in Sturdy, allowing Sawk to take any one hit and retaliate, making it especially dangerous for offensive teams and a great revenge killer too.</p> <p>However, Sawk faces stiff competition from other offensive Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee. It is also relatively frail and, as a result, it is susceptible to being revenge killed, which is compounded by its less than stellar Speed stat that leaves it outsped by offensive Pokemon such as Flygon, Rotom, and Delphox.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mold Breaker in tandem with Earthquake can be used to bait in Weezing and KO it, but it is a predictable lure because the Mold Breaker message shows up; Mold Breaker also allows Sawk to guarantee the OHKO on Rhyperior, however. Life Orb can be used if you want Sawk to hit hard and have the possibility to switch moves, but it breaks Sturdy, so Mold Breaker will be the superior ability if you opt for this. Expert Belt can be used to bluff a Choice Band set and have the possibility of switching moves, too, but then Sawk loses power on its moves. A Jolly nature allows Sawk to outpace Shiftry, Medicham, and Mesprit, but it causes Sawk to lose significant power. Ice Punch is a catch-all move, allowing Sawk to hit Flygon and Druddigon for great damage, as well as Togetic. Choice Scarf allows Sawk to be a good revenge killer, but Hitmonlee is more adept at that. Stone Edge is an option to hit Flying- or Bug-types such as Pelipper and Scyther hard, but it is rather useless otherwise.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pokemon that Take Advantage of Choice-locked Sawk</strong>: Sawk is easily taken advantage of when locked into certain moves. When locked into Close Combat, the move that Sawk will be using most of the time, Pokemon that resist it, such as Togetic, Spiritomb, Venusaur, Qwilfish, Granbull, and Aromatisse, can take advantage of that and use Sawk as setup fodder or outright KO it. Uxie also deserves a special mention, as it switches into Close Combat comfortably and can cripple Sawk with Thunder Wave or outright KO a weakened Sawk with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Because Sawk has underwhelming Speed and bulk, faster threats such as Delphox, Fletchinder, and Meloetta can all come in on a free switch and proceed to OHKO Sawk with their respective moves.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Sawk is heavily crippled by status ailments such as burn or paralysis, as this makes it even easier to pick off.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat is Sawk's main STAB move and severely dents even Pokemon neutral to it. Knock Off deals with Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Uxie and Jellicent, which resist or are immune to Close Combat, in addition to providing useful utility in depriving the foe of its item. Poison Jab targets Fairy-types such as Granbull, Togetic, and Aromatisse, which resist both Close Combat and Knock Off. Zen Headbutt hits Poison-types such as Weezing, Venusaur, and Qwilfish.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band greatly improves Sawk's damage output, making it a fearsome wallbreaker. An Adamant nature in tandem with maximum Attack investment makes Sawk extremely powerful, as it needs all the power it can get, while 252 Speed EVs make Sawk as fast as possible. Sturdy allows Sawk to take any one hit and retaliate. A Jolly nature is generally preferred as outspeeding Venusaur is extremely important.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Close Combat is an extremely spammable move and, coupled with its high Base Power and Choice Band, it will severely dent even Pokemon neutral to it. As Sawk has quite underwhelming bulk, try to bring it in on a double switch or after a teammate has fainted to preserve Sturdy. Try to predict opposing Pokemon switching in—for example, use Knock Off as the opponent switches to Uxie—as Sawk does not have too many chances to attack and mispredicting means Sawk will get forced out. Entry hazards will break Sturdy, so it is advised to remove them. If Sturdy is intact, Sawk can function as a good emergency stop to opposing setup sweepers such as Drapion and offensive Trick Room Diancie.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support from the likes of Qwilfish, Mesprit, and Rhyperior is helpful, as Sawk appreciates the extra damage on the ample switches it forces. Sawk does not like entry hazards breaking Sturdy, so entry hazard removers such as Flygon and Blastoise are appreciated; in particular, Flygon pressures hazard setters such as Qwilfish with its Ground-type coverage. Sawk is a great wallbreaker, so late-game cleaners such as Fletchinder, Jolteon, and Sneasel are good partners to take advantage of the large dents Sawk puts in the opponent's team. As Sawk has poor bulk and switches in and out a lot, pivots such as Magneton and Rotom-C can provide Sawk with free switches. Fast Fighting-types, such as Swords Dance Virizion and Choice Scarf Medicham, are good partners, as Sawk can punch holes in the opponent's team early on for them to clean up. Uxie is a great partner in general, providing momentum with U-turn, Stealth Rock support to whittle down switch-ins, and Thunder Wave to slow down faster threats such as Mega Glalie. Pursuit support from the likes of Drapion and Sneasel is also appreciated to deal with Psychic-types that take Close Combat relatively easy. Pokemon that resist Flying, such as Magnetons, Registeel, and Aerodactyl, are good partners to mitigate Sawk's weakness to Flying-types such as Fletchinder and Braviary.</p>"

  "Scrafty": {
    "overview": "<p>Scrafty is a threatening Dragon Dance sweeper in RU. It sets up easily against bulkier teams thanks to its decent 65 / 115 / 115 bulk and great abilities; Shed Skin and Intimidate help Scrafty set up, whereas Moxie assists in sweeping. Scrafty's Dark / Fighting typing makes it a good answer to Dark-types such as Sneasel and Drapion and grants it great STAB options in High Jump Kick, Knock Off, and Drain Punch. Scrafty also possesses useful coverage options in Iron Head and Zen Headbutt, making it an overall versatile setup sweeper. Sadly, Scrafty requires a Dragon Dance or Life Orb boosts to thoroughly sweep due to its unimpressive base 90 Attack. It also has an uncomfortable weakness to Fighting-type moves, which is further worsened by the presence of the many Fighting-types in RU such as Medicham, Virizion, Hitmonlee, and Sawk, which are all faster than an unboosted Scrafty. Scrafty is also held back by its underwhelming base 58 Speed, meaning it fails to outspeed every relevant Choice Scarf user in the tier even after a Dragon Dance boost.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Zen Headbutt allows Scrafty to better deal with bulky Fighting- and Poison-types like Poliwrath and Venusaur. Head Smash can be an option to surprise Flying-types like Golbat, Fletchinder, and Togetic, although its imperfect accuracy and 50% recoil can prove troublesome. Iron Tail can be an option over Iron Head if power is desired, as a Life Orb-boosted Iron Tail OHKOes Diancie, but just like with Head Smash its imperfect accuracy can be annoying. Rest + Chesto Berry can be used so that Scrafty can opt for Moxie or Intimidate over Shed Skin. Bulk Up can be used as a more defensive means of setting up, but the lack of Speed boosts means that Scrafty will have a harder time dealing with more offensive threats, aside from the fact that Malamar performs this role much better. An Adamant nature can be used for more power, but Scrafty then fails to outspeed maximum investment base 100 Speed Pokemon after a Dragon Dance boost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Aromatisse, Togetic, and Granbull resist both of Scrafty's STAB moves and can easily KO Scrafty with their own Fairy-type STAB moves, although they should be careful of switching into Iron Head. Both Togetic and Granbull also dislike switching into Knock Off, as Togetic loses its Eviolite and Granbull its only form of recovery in Leftovers. Dazzling Gleam from the likes of Delphox, Meloetta, and Sigilyph, which can also use Air Slash, can easily OHKO Scrafty.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Faster Fighting-types such as Virizion, Sawk, and Hitmonlee can OHKO Scrafty with Fighting-type STAB moves of their own, but they can't switch into any of its moves bar Knock Off in Virizion's and Sawk's case. Virizion and Hitmonlee must also be wary of Chople Berry Scrafty, as it survives a super effective Close Combat and Mach Punch, respectively. Hitmontop can switch into Scrafty while also reducing its Attack with Intimidate and can heavily damage it with Close Combat. Gurdurr can tank one High Jump Kick and retaliate with Drain Punch, or it can finish Scrafty off with Mach Punch if Scrafty is weak enough. While they can't switch in directly, maximum HP Hariyama and Poliwrath can tank a +1 High Jump Kick and OHKO Scrafty and phaze it, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to its low base 58 Speed, Scrafty can be revenge killed by Choice Scarf users carrying super effective moves such as Medicham, Emboar, Braviary, and Delphox. Scrafty should also be wary of super effective priority attacks such as Fletchinder's Acrobatics and Hitmonlee's Mach Punch.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Poison-types</strong>: Defensive Venusaur can sponge most of Scrafty's attacks well while wearing down Scrafty with Leech Seed and Giga Drain. Garbodor can wear Scrafty down with Rocky Helmet and Aftermath recoil and remove its boosts with Haze. Golbat switches into any of Scrafty's Fighting-type attacks with impunity, although it must be wary of Knock Off and Stealth Rock damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance raises Scrafty's Attack and Speed by 1 stage, making it a threatening sweeper if left unchecked. High Jump Kick is the preferred STAB move due to its great 130 Base Power. Knock Off hits Psychic- and Ghost-types that might try to switch into High Jump Kick such as Sigilyph and Hoopa. Iron Head lets Scrafty hit Fairy-types such as Diancie and Granbull super effectively, which would otherwise switch into its STAB moves easily. Rest works very well in conjunction with Shed Skin, giving Scrafty the opportunity to fully recover its HP in one turn. Drain Punch provides Scrafty with a secondary Fighting-type STAB move that is safer than High Jump Kick due to its perfect accuracy and lack of recoil and helps preserve Scrafty's longevity by mitigating Life Orb recoil.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature with maximum Attack and Speed EVs makes Scrafty as fast and strong as possible while outspeeding Virizion after a boost. Life Orb increases Scrafty's overall power, making it more threatening prior to setting up. Do note Life Orb compromises its overall longevity unless it opts to run Rest or Drain Punch. Leftovers lets Scrafty set up on defensive Pokemon more easily, although the difference in power compared to Life Orb is noticeable. For example, Life Orb Scrafty can OHKO Diancie with High Jump Kick, while Scrafty holding Leftovers fails to do so. It should be noted that if Leftovers is chosen, 8 HP EVs should be invested in order to maximize recovery. Chople Berry lets Scrafty survive Virizion's Close Combat and Emboar's Superpower as well as avoiding the 2HKO from Life Orb Hitmonlee's Mach Punch, giving Scrafty the opportunity to attack or set up another Dragon Dance. Shed Skin mitigates Scrafty's worry about status conditions, letting it set up on passive Pokemon such as Registeel and Alomomola more easily. Moxie increases Scrafty's Attack stat after it knocks out a Pokemon, making it even more threatening after achieving a KO. Intimidate lets Scrafty set up on some physical attackers upon switching in, although the benefits that Shed Skin and Moxie provide are much more useful.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Scrafty's item and coverage move of choice can be pretty customizable depending on the coverage its partners provide. Scrafty should attempt to set up once checks and faster attackers have been weakened or KOed. However, Knock Off can be used early-game to generally cripple the opponent's Pokemon, making late-game cleaning easier. Scrafty should attempt to set up on passive Pokemon such as Registeel and Alomomola and offensive Pokemon that can't break past it such as slow Psychic-types such as Slowking and Dark-types such as Sneasel, Spiritomb, and Drapion. If against a Fairy-type, Scrafty should not stay to use Iron Head unless it is sure to KO. If it lacks Shed Skin, Scrafty should be wary of status ailments, which would cripple its sweeping potential. High Jump Kick should not be used recklessly if the opponent has a Ghost-type Pokemon such as Hoopa or Jellicent.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazards such as Stealth Rock from Diancie and Uxie and Spikes from Garbodor and Mega Glalie are very useful, as they weaken Scrafty's checks and counters, making them easier to handle later in the match. Psychic-types like Delphox, Meloetta, and Sigilyph can wear down Fighting- and Poison-types for Scrafty. In return, Scrafty can dissuade Dark-types from switching in. Pokemon that can wear down Fairy-types such as Escavalier and Venusaur allow Scrafty to break past the opposing team more easily. Partners that can deal with Flying-types for Scrafty such as Magneton, Choice Band Rhyperior, and Rotom are greatly appreciated. Wallbreakers to pave the way for Scrafty to sweep late-game are quite useful. Examples include Hoopa, Choice Specs Meloetta, and Choice Band Escavalier.</p>"

  "Sigilyph": {
    "overview": "<p>Sigilyph is one of the strongest Psychic-types in RU thanks to its great coverage, versatility, and access to Magic Guard. It has a solid Special Attack and good Speed, as well as a wide assortment of offensive moves that includes Psychic, Heat Wave, Energy Ball, Air Slash, and Dazzling Gleam, as well as niche options in Flash Cannon and Dark Pulse for specific threats. This allows Sigilyph to generally tailor its coverage to whatever your team might need, which is something few offensive threats can do. Sigilyph is also able to utilize a more defensive set with Calm Mind thanks to its ability Magic Guard, which allows it to push past many of its typical checks and counters. Magic Guard also makes it more annoying to take down than at first glance, as this means Sigilyph can only be damaged by direct attacks, which makes it difficult to KO in tandem with access to reliable recovery in Roost. However, Pursuit users are a common sight in RU and Sigilyph has issues with the most prominent of them, such as Spiritomb, Sneasel, and Houndoom. Sigilyph's Speed is good, but it still leaves it outpaced by key Pokemon like Delphox, Flygon, and Mega Glalie. Sigilyph also faces stiff competition from other potent Psychic-types, such as Meloetta, Delphox, and Slowking. Finally, Sigilyph has fairly exploitable weaknesses to Dark, Electric, Rock, and Ice, which can be taken advantage of by common threats, such as Diancie, Eelektross, Drapion, and Absol, should Sigilyph not be carrying the proper move to dispose of them before being hit.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sigilyph can use a Focus Sash set with Thunder Wave + 3 Attacks to take advantage of Magic Guard, which ensures that Sigilyph's Focus Sash isn't broken by any form of passive damage. Signal Beam is an option to hit opposing Psychic-types, especially Malamar, at least neutrally. Calm Mind can be used in a more offensive manner with a Life Orb; such a set, however, compromises Sigilyph's coverage due to mandating Roost to stay healthy. Tinted Lens normally is a fantastic ability on an offensive Pokemon like Sigilyph, but it benefits much more from Magic Guard, which lets it run Life Orb or Flame Orb easily and negates its Stealth Rock weakness. Colbur Berry can be used to lure in and take out Dark-types, but this is generally better done by Meloetta, a Psychic-type that has much more raw power than Sigilyph does. Sigilyph has a solid Speed tier for a Choice Scarf set, but it lacks a strong STAB move to power through opposing teams during the late-game. Substitute can be used in conjunction with Roost to ease prediction; however, Sigilyph's typing hinders the effectiveness of such a set. Sigilyph has access to Cosmic Power to boost both defenses and Magic Guard to avoid passive damage, but a Cosmic Power set takes too many turns to get going and is generally outclassed by the Calm Mind set, which requires much fewer turns to be threatening and can also utilize a better offensive type, Flying.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Houndoom</strong>: Houndoom is easily the best Sigilyph switch-in. It beats both of Sigilyph's sets reliably and has Sucker Punch and Pursuit to threaten it. Furthermore, Houndoom is immune to Psyshock and Heat Wave, resists Energy Ball, and is only hit neutrally by Dazzling Gleam and Air Slash. It can then use Sucker Punch, Pursuit, or Dark Pulse to threaten Sigilyph directly or simply set up with Nasty Plot while Sigilyph is forced out.</p> <p><strong>Diancie</strong>: Outside of the rare Flash Cannon, Sigilyph generally doesn't have enough firepower to push past Diancie, while Diamond Storm cleanly OHKOes offensive Sigilyph with minimal investment. Diancie even has Heal Bell to keep the Calm Mind set from crippling it.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: While Dark-types struggle to deal with the Calm Mind set, the likes of Spiritomb, Drapion, and Sneasel can beat the offensive set easily between Knock Off, Pursuit, and Sucker Punch. Aside from Drapion, however, they must be careful of Dazzling Gleam hitting them on the switch or Sigilyph predicting Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types, such as Meloetta, Hoopa, and Delphox generally fare well against Sigilyph. However, Delphox can struggle with the Calm Mind set, while Meloetta will need Shadow Ball to handle it. All Psychic-types need to be careful of Dark Pulse, though it is uncommon.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon faster than Sigilyph, such as Aerodactyl, Manectric, and Mega Glalie, can easily revenge kill the Life Orb set, but Manectric can struggle to deal with the Calm Mind set if Sigilyph has had a couple of boosts, while Glalie needs to have already Mega Evolved earlier in the match to outspeed Sigilyph. It should be noted that most faster Pokemon will usually fail to safely switch into Sigilyph due to their frailty.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set is Sigilyph's most prominent in RU, taking advantage of its great coverage options, solid Speed, and Magic Guard ability to block Life Orb recoil and all other forms of passive damage. Psyshock is the primary choice for a STAB move, as it hits Virizion, Gallade, and Assault Vest Eelektross harder than Psychic would. Heat Wave allows Sigilyph to push past bulkier Steel-type Pokemon, such as Registeel and Bronzong. Roost allows Sigilyph to heal off damage it takes upon switching in or from weaker attacks in general while it attempts to break down opposing teams. Sigilyph's final slot allows it to pressure specific defensive Pokemon more easily. Energy Ball is usually preferred to hit Alomomola and Slowking harder while also OHKOing Rhyperior and Seismitoad. Dazzling Gleam is a worthy alternative that can catch Spiritomb on the switch and hit all Dark-types at least neutrally. Psychic should be used with Dazzling Gleam to hit Rhyperior and Alomomola harder than Psyshock. Air Slash is another STAB option Sigilyph can use to keep Dark-types from having a switching in freely. Dark Pulse allows Sigilyph to beat Hoopa and heavily pressure Delphox and Meloetta. Finally, Flash Cannon is a niche option that allows Sigilyph to immediately push past Diancie should it be required.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sigilyph should always stick to a simple spread of maximum Special Attack and Speed in order to hit as hard and fast as possible. A Timid nature should always be used, as Sigilyph is only slightly faster than Pokemon that threaten it, such as Houndoom and Drapion, thus allowing it to possibly KO them if it carries the proper move. Magic Guard helps Sigilyph break through defensive teams due to being immune to Life Orb recoil and other forms of passive damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Sigilyph should look for opportunities to switch in against passive Pokemon where it can utilize Magic Guard to absorb possible status moves; such Pokemon include Registeel, Blastoise, and Alomomola. it is quite difficult to switch into Sigilyph, so expect Sigilyph to truly shine against slower, more balanced teams that have fewer Pokemon to outspeed it. Be careful with Pursuit users, such as Spiritomb and Houndoom, and try to deny them any opportunities to switch in by using the appropriate move if Sigilyph has it. If the opposing team lacks a likely Pursuit user, Sigilyph can afford to be played much more aggressively thanks to Magic Guard shielding it from passive damage from status, Life Orb, and entry hazards.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sigilyph has a very difficult time dealing with Houndoom, as it can't OHKO it with any move whilst Houndoom can either Pursuit trap it, Sucker Punch if Sigilyph catches it with the right move on the switch, or simply use Dark Pulse on a predicted Roost. Thus, Diancie and Poliwrath make for solid teammates due to their strong matchup against Houndoom. Diancie can also set up Stealth Rock and lure in bulky Water- and Grass-type Pokemon for Sigilyph to switch into, while Poliwrath can switch into powerful Rock-type attacks from Rhyperior. Without Dark Pulse and Air Slash, Sigilyph will struggle against opposing Psychic-types, such as Delphox, Hoopa, and Meloetta. Pursuit support from Spiritomb, Sneasel, and Aerodactyl can be very beneficial for this reason. Houndoom is another option; it is immune to both of Delphox's STAB moves and also resists Hoopa's Ghost-type STAB moves. Manectric and Aerodactyl cause issues for Sigilyph, as they are faster and have super effective STAB moves to hit Sigilyph with. Mega Camerupt tends to lure in passive Water-type Pokemon and easily checks Manectric, and Aerodactyl has problems with Escavalier; hence, they make for good teammates. Virizion is a fantastic offensive partner for Sigilyph due to its resistances to Dark-, Electric-, and Rock-type moves. It also tends to be checked by bulkier Psychic-types, thus allowing both it and Sigilyph to wear down those Psychic-types for one of them to sweep. Spikes support from Accelgor, Garbodor, and Mega Glalie is appreciated to drop bulkier targets, such as Jellicent and Diancie, into KO range of the proper coverage move. Although it's not a common strategy in RU, Sigilyph can greatly benefit from Sticky Web support due to how well it performs against Pokemon slower than it. Smeargle is generally the best Sticky Web user due to being able to put an opposing Pokemon to sleep to nearly guarantee getting up Sticky Web early.</p>"
      },
      "Flame Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This is a much different take on Sigilyph that focuses on Flame Orb and Magic Guard to push past many of Sigilyph's common checks and counters. Calm Mind allows Sigilyph to boost its Special Attack and Special Defense to high levels to deal major amounts of damage and avoid revenge killing attempts from special attackers. Psycho Shift allows Sigilyph to burn opposing physical attackers, such as Absol, Spiritomb, and Drapion, that are often used to check Sigilyph. Roost allows Sigilyph to recover HP lost from setting up on defensive Pokemon. Air Slash rounds off the set by giving Sigilyph a solid STAB move nothing is immune to.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread simply maximizes Sigilyph's overall bulk while also keeping it ahead of dangerous threats such as Drapion and Houndoom that are only slightly slower than it. Magic Guard is absolutely necessary for this set to work, allowing Sigilyph to avoid the passive damage normally caused by holding Flame Orb. A more offensive EV spread of 140 HP / 116 SpA / 252 Spe can be used in order to always OHKO Virizion with Air Slash without a Calm Mind boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Sigilyph should be brought in on passive Pokemon such as Alomomola, Registeel, and Blastoise in order to activate its Flame Orb and begin setting up. However, make sure Alomomola isn't carrying Knock Off before attempting to use it as setup bait. While Sigilyph can simply burn slower threats, such as Spiritomb and Drapion, after they switch into Sigilyph, catching faster physical attackers, such as Sneasel and Aerodactyl, as they switch in can greatly improve Sigilyph's chances to sweep later in the game. While setting up to sweep, make sure to keep Sigilyph in good enough health with Roost to endure possible revenge killing attempts. Sigilyph should generally avoid using Air Slash before it has a couple of Calm Mind boosts unless a phazer or Haze user has switched in. Even with the alternate spread, Sigilyph's damage output will generally be somewhat low until it can get a boost or two, so it's imperative to get some safe setup opportunities.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sigilyph has problems with faster Pokemon that can hit it with super effective attacks, such as Sneasel and Choice Scarf Medicham. Registeel checks Sneasel, though Low Kick will do a fair amount to it. Medicham has many issues dealing with Spiritomb due to Spiritomb's access to Pursuit and immunity to Medicham's STAB moves. Houndoom can be extremely problematic for this set if Sigilyph doesn't have many Calm Mind boosts, so Diancie and Emboar can be valuable teammates to check it reliably. Sigilyph appreciates entry hazard support, especially Spikes, to lessen the number of boosts it needs to sweep. Diancie and Rhyperior are capable of setting up Stealth Rock and they resist certain super effective moves aimed at Sigilyph. Garbodor, Qwilfish, and Mega Glalie can provide Spikes support; Mega Glalie can even weaken the opposing team with its powerful attacks. Wallbreakers such as Meloetta, Venusaur, and Absol are also quite helpful to weaken opposing defensive cores for Sigilyph to push past later.</p>"

  "Cofagrigus": {
    "overview": "<p>Cofagrigus has a high amount of bulk that allows it to serve as an effective wall. Its Ghost typing allows it to spinblock the likes of Hitmontop and Blastoise, and it also bears a few disruptive moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Haze, and Toxic Spikes. Its unique ability, Mummy, is decently useful and allows it to neutralize the abilities of common threats such as Fletchinder, Mega Glalie, and Medicham that rely on them, severely reducing their threat level. However, Cofagrigus is extremely slow, which makes it very easy to revenge kill. Its Dark and Ghost weaknesses leave it vulnerable to numerous common Pokemon in the tier, as well as the ever-popular Knock Off. In addition, it lacks reliable recovery outside of Pain Split, which makes it easy to wear down with entry hazards, status, and repeated attacks. Its lack of a varied offensive movepool also leaves it highly vulnerable to common threats such as Meloetta, Mega Camerupt, Braviary, and Drapion. Additionally, it faces stiff competition from Spiritomb and Jellicent as a bulky Ghost-type.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cofagrigus has a very sparse movepool, which leaves its other capabilities extremely limited. It can run an offensive set with Trick Room and Nasty Plot, which allows it to use its bulk and low Speed to its advantage to become a sweeper that hits hard and fast. However, as it requires two turns to become a threat, such a set is difficult to use. Curse is an interesting option that can wear down an foe and force it out, but it cuts Cofagrigus's HP in half, leaving it highly vulnerable to being KOed afterwards. Destiny Bond is also a usable move that can take down a foe as it KOes Cofagrigus, but it is highly situational. Disable is also a unique move that can disable a powerful attack used on Cofagrigus. Either Energy Ball or Grass Knot can be used to deal heavy damage to certain Pokemon, such as Rhyperior and Seismitoad, though Cofagrigus lacks the room to use such moves. Imprison is also usable to disable moves that Cofagrigus shares with other Pokemon, such as Will-O-Wisp, though Cofagrigus lacks the moves to make Imprison useful. Memento is also usable to sacrifice Cofagrigus to provide a free setup opportunity for threats such as Fletchinder and Virizion. Magic Coat is a passable option to allow Cofagrigus to reflect entry hazards and status back to the foe.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Houndoom is immune to Will-O-Wisp and resists Shadow Ball, and it can KO Cofagrigus with Dark Pulse or boost its Special Attack with Nasty Plot. Drapion, Absol, and Sneasel are also relatively common and can hit Cofagrigus quite hard with Knock Off or Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Hoopa</strong>: Hoopa cannot switch into Cofagrigus but is faster than it and can OHKO Cofagrigus with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types</strong>: Meloetta, Exploud, Braviary, and Mega Audino can all take advantage of Cofagrigus and are immune to Shadow Ball. Exploud can bypass Cofagrigus's immunity to Normal and OHKO with Boomburst, while Meloetta, Braviary, and Mega Audino can use Cofagrigus as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burn and poison can wear down Cofagrigus fairly quickly over the match, especially with its lack of reliable recovery and Cofagrigus's poor Speed forcing it to take attacks first. Paralysis and sleep also render it potentially incapable of doing anything.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Emboar, Manectric, Venusaur, and Mega Camerupt can all overwhelm Cofagrigus by dealing more damage to it than it can handle, and most of these Pokemon do not fear a burn at all.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp inflicts burns on opposing Pokemon, allowing Cofagrigus to cripple several physical attackers such as Mega Glalie and make itself much harder to take down. Hex is a strong Ghost-type move that takes advantage of Cofagrigus's ability to spread status, hitting hard against anything that doesn't resist it. Shadow Ball, however, is a more consistent STAB move, albeit sometimes weaker. Pain Split serves as a shaky yet usable form of recovery if Cofagrigus is weakened, healing its own HP and damaging opposing threats, which works well with Cofagrigus's low base HP. Haze prevents Cofagrigus from becoming setup fodder, resetting the stat boosts of setup sweepers. Toxic Spikes allows Cofagrigus to spread poison to the opposing team, although with Venusaur being relatively common, it must be used carefully. Knock Off allows Cofagrigus to remove items and cripple or weaken certain Pokemon, such as Togetic and Gurdurr.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in HP and Defense along with a Bold nature maximizes Cofagrigus's physical bulk to allow it to effectively take on common physical attackers in the tier, such as Mega Glalie, Medicham, Escavalier, and Rhyperior. Leftovers serves as a form of passive recovery for Cofagrigus and allows it to take hits slightly more effectively.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cofagrigus should be used to switch into something it can check, such as Accelgor, Hitmonlee, Medicham, or Mega Glalie, and attempt to wall it. From there, it should be used to spread burns or use Toxic Spikes as a means of spreading crippling status. If Cofagrigus carries Knock Off, it is advised to use it to cripple opposing Pokemon by removing their items. When Cofagrigus's HP reaches a low point from a powerful attack, Pain Split should be used to restore it. Haze should also be used when necessary to prevent opposing Pokemon from using Cofagrigus as setup bait.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Diancie is a very good teammate for Cofagrigus, since it has the sheer special bulk to deal with special attackers that Cofagrigus cannot and also has access to Stealth Rock. Thanks to its resistances, it can take on Dark-types such as Houndoom that trouble Cofagrigus, overall providing solid synergy with it. Mega Audino is also a viable candidate for this job, since it can pass a Wish to compensate for Cofagrigus's lack of reliable recovery. Other Wish users such as Alomomola are also useful to help keep Cofagrigus healthy. Steelix and Registeel also make for good teammates, since they can take on several of the threats that trouble Cofagrigus, such as Jolteon and, in the latter's case, Venusaur. Both can also set up Stealth Rock to utilize Cofagrigus's ability to force switches. In addition, Spikes is also a useful form of support. Qwilfish and Roselia can both lay down Spikes effectively.</p>"

It outspeeds most relevant Taunt and Defog users, which can prevent entry hazards from being set up, and can even use Taunt and Endeavor to deal with stall teams. However, while Archeops seems able to run other sets, they are all unviable due to its bad defensive typing, which gives it a Stealth Rock weakness. Archeops's greatest downfall is its ability, Defeatist, which makes it unable to switch into even weak hits for fear of halving its offenses.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Knock Off can be used to remove items such as Eviolite from foes, but Archeops is better off crippling them with Endeavor. Quick Attack combined with Endeavor can finish off weakened Pokemon, but this likely will not work more than once in a match. Tailwind can be used as a last resort, but it is hard to find room for. U-turn can be used to allow Archeops to pivot out and switch in later in the game, but it is shut down by opposing Stealth Rock. A set with 3 attacks and Stealth Rock could possibly be used thanks to Archeops's high Speed but is worn down quickly by Stealth Rock and is not a reliable lead. A Defog set is somewhat viable, as it can potentially surprise an opponent while not losing any offensive presence.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Multi-hit Attack Users</strong>: Multi-hit attacks break through Focus Sash, rendering Archeops useless; Cinccino can shut down Archeops with Rock Blast, while Rhyperior can force mind games with Stealth Rock and Rock Blast.</p> <p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Xatu can switch into Archeops and bounce Stealth Rock back, but it is heavily damaged by Head Smash.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removal</strong>: After Archeops has fainted, Rapid Spin and Defog users, such as Hitmonlee and Shiftry, respectively, can remove Stealth Rock without much difficulty.</p> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore users such as Liepard and Accelgor can cause Archeops to lose momentum if it does not Taunt them first.</p>",

      "Suicide Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Archeops's ability to outspeed most Taunt and Defog users makes it easy for it to set Stealth Rock up. Taunt prevents opposing leads such as Druddigon from setting up entry hazards or boosting, and it denies Defog and status moves. Endeavor can cripple a foe once Archeops is knocked down to its Focus Sash, making it easy for a teammate to finish the foe off. Head Smash is used to block Rapid Spin and Defog when Archeops is down to its Focus Sash, as they fail when Archeops faints due to Head Smash's recoil; this also grants a teammate a free switch in. Rock Slide can be used over Head Smash, as it hits hard but doesn't break Archeops' Focus Sash; however, it cannot block Rapid Spin. Rock Tomb is also usable over Head Smash, as it slows down the foe, which can be useful against Choice Scarf users and can benefit a teammate.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack EVs maximize Archeops's damage output, while 252 Speed EVs and a Naive nature maximize Archeops's Speed. A Naive nature and a 0 Special Defense IV make it easier to get to 1 HP, though 0 Defense and HP IVs are not recommended, as Archeops would forfeit its chance to survive Rhyperior's Rock Blast. A Focus Sash is necessary to allow Archeops to take a hit while it sets up Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Archeops should almost always be used as a lead to set up Stealth Rock early-game. Always Taunt opposing leads to prevent them from setting entry hazards, and use Stealth Rock afterwards. It's a good idea to Taunt setup sweepers too, especially those that boost their Speed. Use Endeavor on Defog users if Archeops is at 1 HP to cripple them, and then set up Stealth Rock again. Against Rapid Spin users, Archeops should spinblock by knocking itself out with Head Smash instead of using Endeavor. Saving Archeops for later in the match is possible if you think Stealth Rock might be removed or you want to cripple bulky Pokemon with Endeavor. If the opponent has a Xatu and you predict it to switch in, use Head Smash instead of Stealth Rock, as Stealth Rock will be bounced back by Magic Bounce. Don't try to Taunt priority move users, as they can KO Archeops before it sets up Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Most offensive Pokemon such as Fletchinder and Houndoom appreciate Stealth Rock, as it allows them to KO Pokemon they otherwise would not be able to. Archeops can also prevent opposing leads from getting up Stealth Rock, which is helpful for Pokemon weak to it such as Houndoom, Mega Glalie, and Braviary. Wallbreakers, such as Exploud and Mega Glalie, which can break through bulky teams also make for good partners. A Rapid Spin user such as Hitmonlee can remove entry hazards from your side of the field without removing the Stealth Rock set up by Archeops. Braviary also makes for a great partner, as it deters Defog from being used with its ability Defiant. Priority move users such as Fletchinder and Mega Glalie can be used to pick off Pokemon weakened by Endeavor. Finally, a spinblocker such as Mismagius or Spiritomb is recommended to block Rapid Spin to prevent Stealth Rock from being removed.</p>"

  "Garbodor": {
    "overview": "<p>Garbodor's decent bulk and ability to set both Spikes and Toxic Spikes allow it to function well in a support role on many builds. With Rocky Helmet, Aftermath, and a resistance to Fighting-type attacks, it can punish U-turn pivots and most physical attackers. In addition, it is one of the most favorable defensive Spikes users due to its good special bulk and ability to take on Virizion. However, it gives common Defoggers, such as Flygon and Golbat, multiple opportunities to remove entry hazards from the field.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Drain Punch can be used to hit Magneton but rarely has further use. Seed Bomb is another coverage option that hits Rhyperior and Seismitoad for decent damage, but the loss in utility is generally not worth it. A more offensive spread with Normal Gem as the item and Explosion is an option to act as a suicide entry hazard setter, which can set hazards and Explode on slower Defoggers and spinners, providing momentum and weakening opposing hazard control.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Flygon takes little from any of Garbodor's attacks and can clear its entry hazards with Defog or deal massive damage with Earthquake. Rhyperior, Seismitoad, and Mega Camerupt can switch into anything barring Seed Bomb and set Stealth Rock or fire off an attack; however, the former two need to be wary of taking a Seed Bomb on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Psychic-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Hoopa, Delphox, Meloetta, and Sigilyph can take any of Garbodor's attacks and OHKO it with Psychic or Psyshock.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Most Steel-types, such as Magneton, are given free switches by Garbodor, and Garbodor will eventually be forced out, as most variants are walled by them.</p> <p><strong>Poison-resistant Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Drapion and Magneton can switch into any of Garbodor's moves and immediately threaten or set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Golbat</strong>: Golbat easily counters all Garbodor variants, being able to take any hit and clear its entry hazards with Defog or attack it with Brave Bird to whittle it down.</p>",

      "Defensive Hazard Stack": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes helps wear down teammates' checks and is a selling point of using Garbodor. Toxic Spikes is an added bonus that is heavily detrimental to teams without a Poison-type or adequate entry hazard control. Alternatively, Toxic can be used to cripple walls such as Alomomola and provides a more reliable way to status Flygon, which is otherwise given free switches by Garbodor. Gunk Shot is Garbodor's main STAB move, ensuring that it is not completely shut down by faster Taunt users and allowing it to counter Virizion while providing a 30% chance to poison. Pain Split is preferred in the last slot if Garbodor's already running Toxic, as it allows Garbodor to regain some health if it's low on HP. Finally, Haze can be used to make Garbodor an emergency check to setup sweepers such as Scrafty and Braviary.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Defense EVs give Garbodor just enough bulk to take a +2 Zen Headbutt from Virizion and two High Jump Kicks from Adamant Life Orb Hitmonlee, while the Special Defense investment allows it to take two Leaf Storms from Life Orb Venusaur. Rocky Helmet is the preferred item on this set, punishing Pokemon that use contact moves, notably U-turn pivots and the Fighting-types that Garbodor deals with by virtue of its typing. It can also allow Garbodor to function as a spinblocker in some scenarios, as a weakened spinner will be unable to remove hazards after taking Rocky Helmet recoil. Aftermath further discourages physical attackers, as any contact move that KOes Garbodor will cause the attacker to lose 25% of its HP. Black Sludge can be used in order for Garbodor to sustain itself more easily over the course of the match to check what it needs to or set additional layers of Spikes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If possible, switch Garbodor in on a predicted U-turn to inflict chip damage with Rocky Helmet. Bring it in on Pokemon that don't immediately threaten it, such as Venusaur and Virizion, to start stacking entry hazards. Additionally, as Garbodor gives many Defoggers, such as Golbat and Flygon, free switches by nature of its typing, double or triple switch around to avoid giving the opponent many opportunities to use Defog. It is generally best to set Toxic Spikes first if the opponent has no grounded Poison-types and most of the opposing team is vulnerable to it, and Spikes first if the aforementioned conditions do not apply. Finally, if Garbodor is low on health or has no further purpose in the game, it can be sacrificed on a predicted attack that makes contact to deal major chip damage with Rocky Helmet and Aftermath.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can force out or threaten Defoggers, such as Aurorus, Magneton, and Glalie, are greatly appreciated, whereas Pokemon that can pressure the Steel- and Ground-types that wall Garbodor, such as Sawk and Gallade, can help keep momentum. Similarly, Stealth Rock users that can break through common Defoggers, such as Ice Punch Rhyperior, work well with Garbodor due to their ability to pressure the opponent's hazard control and make hazard stacking easier. Most non-grounded Pokemon, such as Braviary, Uxie, and Togetic, are good partners for their ability to counter defensive Flygon and switch into Ground-type attacks. Additionally, Pokemon such as Sneasel, Spiritomb, and Escavalier are notable for their ability to Pursuit trap Hoopa, one of Garbodor's most threatening counters. Finally, setup sweepers, such as Scrafty, Virizion, Omastar, and Gallade, and attackers, such as Aerodactyl, appreciate the entry hazard support that Garbodor provides, which weakens their checks and counters.</p>"

  "Cinccino": {
    "overview": "<p>RU is not a kind metagame for Cinccino. Its mediocre base 95 Attack and inability to remotely dent Steel-types leave it outclassed by nearly all other offensive Pokemon in the tier. Cinccino is also extremely frail with an awful defensive typing, meaning it can only enter the battlefield on a free switch. Being Normal-type and having low Defense also makes Cinccino complete bait to Mach Punch users, particularly Hitmonlee and Gurdurr. Fortunately, because Cinccino has a vast array of multi-hit attacks, it is adept at breaking through foes that rely on Focus Sash and Sturdy. This makes Cinccino a decent anti-lead, preventing Omastar from setting up entry hazards and limiting Accelgor to one layer of Spikes. A blistering base 115 Speed also means Cinccino will nearly always strike first, allowing it to function as a late-game sweeper if it needs to.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An Adamant nature gives Cinccino a bit more attack power, but its ability to outspeed Pokemon such as Virizion is too critical to pass up. King's Rock gives Cinccino's multi-hit moves a 41% chance to cause a foe to flinch, but the loss in power is noticeable and its dependence on a flinch makes the item unreliable as a whole. Choice Scarf makes Cinccino an extremely fast revenge killer, but such a set lacks power and priority, so other dedicated revenge killers such as Fletchinder are better suited for the role. Wake-Up Slap gives Cinccino a chance against Steel-types, but even then, the move usually does not hit hard enough.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Most Steel-types such as Bronzong and Registeel are physically bulky enough to take a neutral hit from any of Cinccino's coverage moves. More offensive ones such as Escavalier can set up on Cinccino or OHKO it outright.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attackers</strong>: Due to Cinccino's frailty, it is very prone to being picked off by strong priority moves. In particular, Hitmonlee and Gurdurr both OHKO Cinccino with a STAB Mach Punch. Other priority attackers that can severely dent Cinccino include Mega Glalie, Fletchinder, and Shiftry.</p> <p><strong>Physical Tanks</strong>: Physically bulky Pokemon such as Gurdurr and Granbull can avoid the 2HKO from Cinccino's Tail Slap and deal serious damage back to it.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Spiritomb, Mega Banette, and Cofagrigus are all immune to Cinccino's Tail Slap. Cofagrigus's Mummy removes Cinccino's Skill Link ability if it tries to hit it with Knock Off as well.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Defensive Druddigon deters Cinccino from using Tail Slap with the combination of Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet. Entry hazard damage and Life Orb recoil wear Cinccino down quickly as well.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Tail Slap is a strong STAB attack that can reliably break Focus Sashes and Substitutes. Bullet Seed hits Rock-types such as Rhyperior and Omastar for solid damage. Rock Blast takes down Accelgor as well as Flying- and Fire-types such as Golbat and Delphox. Knock Off hits Ghost-types such as Cofagrigus and is a good move in general for removing foes' items. Alternatively, U-turn can be used to bail Cinccino out of a bad matchup and maintain momentum for your team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment is necessary so that Cinccino can hit as hard and as quickly as possible. A Jolly nature allows Cinccino to outspeed fast Pokemon such as Virizion. Choice Band maximizes Cinccino's damage output, while Life Orb can be used if the ability to switch attacks is preferred. However, the recoil from Life Orb will wear Cinccino down very quickly. Skill Link allows Tail Slap, Bullet Seed, and Rock Blast to always hit five times, thus maximizing their damage output.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If the opponent packs an obvious entry hazard lead such as Omastar, lead with Cinccino and break the foe's Focus Sash with the appropriate move. Upon defeating the opponent's lead, feel free to preserve Cinccino for the late-game. Once in the late-game, however, do not switch Cinccino into anything; only bring it into the battlefield on a free switch. Moreover, be sure to significantly weaken opposing Steel-types and physical walls before attempting a sweep, as Cinccino struggles to get past them. If you predict the foe will switch out, use U-turn or Knock Off on the switch to maintain momentum or directly punish the switch-in, respectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fire- and Fighting-types such as Delphox and Hitmonlee will annihilate the Steel-types that give Cinccino significant trouble. Pokemon that resist Fighting-types such as Aromatisse and Spiritomb can easily absorb Mach Punch from the likes of Hitmonlee and Gurdurr. Entry hazard setters such as Qwilfish will give Cinccino an easier time landing KOs. A slow U-turn or Volt Switch user such as Eelektross can be used to safely bring Cinccino into the battlefield. A Dark-type such as Drapion or Houndoom checks the Ghost-types that are immune to Cinccino's Tail Slap. Pokemon susceptible to entry hazards, such as Fletchinder, appreciate Cinccino's ability to thwart opposing entry hazard leads.</p>"

Unfortunately, Escavalier's lack of reliable recovery hinders its ability to tank hits, and this is furthered by its awful Speed stat. Common Fire-types in the tier are major issues for Escavalier, as they resist both of Escavalier's STAB moves and can consistently pressure Escavalier.</p>",

However, they should all be wary of Drill Run. Delphox can work too, but due to its Bug neutrality, Dark weakness, and overall physical frailty, it's not as good as Mega Camerupt or Emboar.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Alomomola counters the Assault Vest set, but is 2HKOed by Choice Band Megahorn. Qwilfish resists both of Escavalier's STAB moves, softens up its attacks with Intimidate, can prevent the Swords Dance set from setting up with Taunt, and can set up Spikes on Escavalier. However, Qwilfish takes a solid amount of damage from Drill Run.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Registeel dislikes losing its Leftovers to a potential Knock Off and takes heavy damage from Drill Run, but it can whittle away at Escavalier with Seismic Toss or set up Curse against it, if Drill Run isn't run.</p> <p><strong>Burns</strong>: Cofagrigus, Spiritomb, and Fletchinder can burn Escavalier and render it useless for the remainder of the match.

Iron Head is Escavalier's secondary STAB move that hits Rock-types such as Rhyperior and Aerodactyl as well as Fairy-types such as Aromatisse and Togetic. Pursuit provides important utility in trapping a fleeing Psychic- or Ghost-type such as Meloetta, Mesprit, Bronzong, and Mismagius. Knock Off cripples Escavalier's typical switch-ins such as Alomomola and Jellicent by removing their item, and dealing heavy damage to the latter.

Overcoat makes Escavalier immune to Sleep Powder from Venusaur.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pivot into weak or resisted special attacks and hit back hard with a strong STAB move or a coverage move. Knock Off can be spammed in the early-game, as it is very useful to cripple most of Escavalier's typical switch-ins, but should be used sparingly if your opponent has a Virizion, which benefits from taking the Dark-type attack. Escavalier should be kept away from Knock Off users, as losing its Assault Vest greatly hinders its ability as a pivot and tank.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teammates to handle Fire-types such as Delphox, Emboar, Mega Camerupt, and Houndoom are necessary. Bulky Water-types such as Alomomola, Qwilfish, and Jellicent check some of those Fire-types to some degree. Alomomola also provides Wish support for Escavalier to somewhat mitigate its lack of recovery. Houndoom sets itself apart from the other two Fire-types in that it can easily muscle past Water-types with Life Orb-boosted Dark Pulses, so other teammates such as Mega Camerupt, Rhyperior, and Emboar all fit this role.

Specifically, it is very easy to exploit Escavalier locked into Drill Run, so it should be used sparingly. However, it can be quite rewarding to hit Emboar on the switch with Drill Run to aid a teammate that may struggle getting past them. Use Pursuit to trap fleeing Psychic-types, but the move should also be used sparingly if your opponent has a Pokemon that can set up on Escavalier locked into Pursuit, such as Virizion and Fletchinder.

Overcoat makes Escavalier immune to Sleep Powder.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch into Pokemon that Escavalier can set up on, such as Venusaur, and proceed to use Swords Dance until Escavalier gets worn down or inflicted with status. Usage of Rest and Sleep Talk is rather straightforward; Rest should be used to heal Escavalier and cleanse it of any status ailments, and Sleep Talk should be used while asleep. These two moves also allow Escavalier to switch into and absorb status moves. It is important to get rid of Fire-type Pokemon such as Emboar and Mega Camerupt as well as Taunt users such as Drapion and Spiritomb before setting up, as they are significant roadblocks for Escavalier.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock support from Pokemon such as Rhyperior, Torterra, and Mega Camerupt is helpful to dissuade Fire-types from repeatedly switching in. In addition, Spikes support from the likes of Qwilfish and Roselia quickly wears down Mega Camerupt, a common answer to Escavalier. Teammates to check Fire-type Pokemon, such as Lanturn, Alomomola, and Rhyperior, are solid partners. Due to how this set matches up well versus defensive builds and struggles against offensive teams, Pokemon that have a good matchup against offensive teams such as Choice Scarf Emboar, Fletchinder, and Jolteon pair well with Escavalier. Clerics such as Aromatisse and Togetic are helpful so that Escavalier doesn't have to be completely reliant on Sleep Talk.</p>"

  "Jellicent": {
    "overview": "<p>As far as bulky Water-types are concerned, Jellicent deviates far from the norm due to its host of distinguishable characteristics that make it one of the most effective, self-sufficient defensive Pokemon in RU, while being a very potent stallbreaker at the same time. Its unique Water / Ghost typing makes Jellicent the go-to Pokemon for handling the likes of Mega Glalie, Flygon, Emboar, Escavalier, and many more, while also functioning as a suitable spinblocker. Unlike most defensive Pokemon in RU, Jellicent is neither passive nor easily exploitable thanks to its decent Special Attack stat and access to Taunt + Will-O-Wisp, which prevent it from getting statused and set up on, acting as quite the pest for more defensive teams, especially when Jellicent is making use of Hex. In addition to its merits as a defensive Pokemon, the key trait that makes Jellicent dangerous is its ability to easily spread burns and threaten almost all of the Pokemon designated to sponge them. Vulnerability to Knock Off and Pursuit keep Jellicent from being a perfect wall, though. Jellicent's unfortunate weakness to the very common Knock Off means that it has difficulty switching in on certain Fighting-types and can only hope to handle them one-versus-one, whereas its susceptibility to Pursuit may keep it from consistently checking what it needs to.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Offensive sets on Jellicent are viable options on more specific builds such as Spikes-stacking offense that require a special attacking Ghost-type to keep the momentum up. On those kinds of teams, Jellicent can incorporate Choice Scarf, Choice Specs, or simply a more offensive EV spread. Surprisingly, Jellicent has a wide array of offensive moves it can make use of when employing these sets, including Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, Energy Ball, Dazzling Gleam, and even Trick on Choice sets. Trick Room allows Jellicent to combine the supportive and offensive roles into one, allowing it to set up this type of support for wallbreakers such as Mega Camerupt or make use of Trick Room alongside its decent power and great coverage to sweep itself.</p> <p>On the main set, Jellicent can incorporate other defensive moves such as Toxic and Magic Coat. Toxic can stall out certain walls at a faster pace; however, Hex + Will-O-Wisp will generally suffice in taking down defensive Pokemon. Magic Coat, on the other hand, can be used over Taunt to render Qwilfish useless and turn the tables on faster Taunt and entry hazard users.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Offensive Grass- and Electric-types</strong>: Special attackers with super effective STAB attacks are the best way to combat Jellicent, as they won't be too hindered by a burn and can take at least one Hex. Examples include Venusaur, Jolteon, Abomasnow, Rotom, Rotom-C, and Magneton.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Choice Specs Meloetta and Hoopa can slaughter Jellicent with their powerful Shadow Ball and easily sponge a Scald; however, neither like being burned and Hoopa is destroyed by Hex on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Status, Knock Off, and Toxic Spikes</strong>: Jellicent is extremely vulnerable to status, so faster Pokemon with Toxic or Will-O-Wisp can strictly decrease its performance, while random Knock Offs from the likes of Alomomola will force Jellicent to Recover more often and make it easier to pressure and overwhelm. Toxic Spikes is also a great way to constrain Jellicent and overwhelm it, although make sure two layers are up before Jellicent comes in as opposed to just one layer, which will only be a slight bother for it.</p> <p><strong>Status-Resilient Attackers</strong>: Shed Skin Scrafty is one of the best ways to take on Jellicent, as it can shrug off any of Jellicent's attacks while being able to rid itself of status nearly every other turn. In a similar vein, Sigilyph also makes a strong check to Jellicent thanks to its Magic Guard ability; however, it will go down to Hex variants. Lum Berry users such as Drapion and Virizion can switch into a Scald, even if it burns, at least once and threaten Jellicent with their STAB moves.Gurdurr does not mind being burned and can pressure Jellicent with a Guts-boosted Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pursuit Users</strong>: Drapion and Sneasel make for good Pokemon that can eliminate Jellicent from the remainder of the match because, unlike other Pursuit trappers, they can attack Jellicent before it can status them. Be wary of Jellicent staying in and recklessly hitting the two Pokemon with a Scald or Will-O-Wisp though, as the effects can be devastating for both.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>The combination of Taunt and Will-O-Wisp allows Jellicent to stallbreak, prevent the spread of status effects and entry hazards, and cripple incoming checks with a burn. Recover makes Jellicent a consistent and support-free wall, as it can take the opportunity to replenish its health when a switch is forced or when a wall or passive Pokemon is subdued with Taunt. The choice of Hex or Scald depends entirely on the makeup of your team. For instance, if one carries additional checks to Fire-types such as Mega Camerupt, Fletchinder, and Emboar, then Hex makes Jellicent much more difficult to deal with; however, if one solely relies on Jellicent to check these Pokemon, then Scald must be used in order to do so and is more often than not the better default option. Hex Jellicent can also pressure Blastoise and other Rapid Spin users much better than Scald can when burned. Utilizing Hex does have additional special benefits though: it allows Jellicent to heavily damage Pokemon that otherwise have no difficulty switching in on most defensive threats, such as Venusaur and Sigilyph. Another variation of this set involves dropping Will-O-Wisp and instead going for dual STAB with Scald + Hex, the advantage being that Jellicent gets the best of both worlds in beating Fire-types and destroying statused Pokemon; however, relying on Scald to inflict status isn't always the best approach, especially when Jellicent needs an instantaneous burn to bring down Escavalier, among other threats.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With 44 Speed EVs, Jellicent outspeeds minimum Speed Alomomola and can then Taunt it before it can hit Jellicent with a Toxic or get a Wish off. Jellicent can also opt for more Speed EVs—84 specifically—in order to outspeed Hitmontop, Taunt it, and prevent it from using Foresight or Toxic; this helps keep entry hazards up on team builds that rely more on Spikes to win games. The rest of the EVs are focused on Defense, as Jellicent works best by checking physical attackers such as Rhyperior, Flygon, Escavalier, Fletchinder, and Emboar; however, a specially defensive spread can find use by allowing Jellicent to more easily switch in on Mega Camerupt and Diancie and pivot out of more ferocious special attackers such as Exploud. Water Absorb should be the only ability Jellicent uses, as the immunity to Scald burns is crucial for it to function. Colbur Berry compromises Jellicent's passive recovery in exchange for a much better matchup against Knock Off-wielding Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee. In addition, Colbur Berry makes Jellicent much less vulnerable to Pursuit and allows it to beat Dark-types such as Sneasel one-on-one.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Jellicent can switch in on many physical attackers, including Mega Glalie, Rhyperior, Samurott, Fletchinder, and Druddigon, and threaten them with a Scald or Will-O-Wisp. While Jellicent has no trouble switching in on various physical and special attackers, avoid getting Jellicent statused at all costs because it will be forced to Recover more often and have difficulty staying in to stallbreak. Speaking of which, the combination of Taunt + Will-O-Wisp should only be used versus slower targets; against faster teams, it's simply better to attack or anticipate a switch and use Will-O-Wisp. Be wary of using Will-O-Wisp too recklessly with a Houndoom on the opposing team, though. Jellicenet may also switch in on certain defensive Pokemon such as Diancie and prevent it from using Heal Bell or setting up Stealth Rock and spin block Rapid Spin users such as Blastoise.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fairy-types such as Mega Audino work well with Jellicent by sponging Knock Offs, whereas Diancie can check Fire-types such as Houndoom and allow Jellicent to use Hex freely in addition to soft-checking certain Psychic-types such as Meloetta, Hoopa, and Sigilpyh. Both can also offer cleric support on the off-chance Jellicent does end up getting crippled by status. Steel-types such as Registeel make for good partners as well due to the fact that they can check Electric-types that bother Jellicent. Both can also provide Stealth Rock support that is useful in chipping away at the opposing team in tandem with Jellicent's ability to spread status. Bulky Dragon-types such as Druddigon and defensive Flygon also make for good partners with their ability to keep Electric-types in line. Druddigon can provide some unique support by spreading paralysis with Glare, which aids Hex variants of Jellicent, while Flygon can clear off entry hazards such as Toxic Spikes.</p> <p>On balanced teams, offensive partners such as Emboar can check Grass-types and Houndoom for Jellicent, whereas Virizion has excellent defensive synergy with Jellicent and appreciate its ability to spread burns so that they have an easier time busting through their checks. On more defensive teams, bulky Venusaur and Roselia make for fantastic partners due to their great synergy, as well as hold the ability to absorb Toxic Spikes and spread around status. Roselia in particular can sponge any status move thanks to Natural Cure and give Jellicent Toxic Spikes support, which is especially effective when Jellicent is using Hex.</p>"

  "Alomomola": {
    "overview": "<p>Alomomola is one of the best mixed walls in the tier because of its extremely high HP, high Defense, and amazing typing. It has access to Regenerator and Wish, which enable it to heal itself and its teammates upon switching out. It also has access to Scald and Knock Off, which make it able to check common threats such as Sneasel, Delphox, Flygon, Glalie, and Houndoom. However, due to its horrible offensive presence, it becomes a setup fodder for many sweepers and entry hazard setters. It also faces competition from Jellicent, which has better offensive presence as well as access to Taunt and Recover, but Jellicent lacks Regenerator and Wish and is weak to Knock Off.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Waterfall can be used over Scald for more power to check Houndoom and Delphox much more easily, but Scald's 30% chance to burn foes is more valuable. Mirror Coat can be used to punish special attackers that try to KO Alomomola, but its other moves are too valuable to be replaced. Magic Coat can be used to avoid status ailments, Taunt, and entry hazards, as well as gain residual recovery from Leftovers because Alomomola can use it repeatedly. Healing Wish can be used on offensive teams to recover win conditions while not losing momentum as well as act as a defensive pivot. Refresh can be used to cure Alomomola from status ailments, which otherwise reduces Alomomola's longevity. Tickle can be used to stop setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Scrafty and Bulk Up Gurdurr by PP stalling them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Venusaur, Roselia, Virizion, and Rotom-C take minimal damage from Scald and are potentially immune to Toxic. Roselia does not care about getting burned due to Natural Cure. These Pokemon can threaten Alomomola with a super effective STAB move or, in Roselia's case, use free turns to set up Spikes. Even though Virizion and Rotom-C hate being burned, Virizion can still use Alomomola as setup fodder, while Rotom-C can Volt Switch out to provide momentum for the team.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Jolteon and Eelektross don't care about Alomomola's attacks and can set up Substitutes or OHKO Alomomola with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users</strong>: Setup sweepers such as Substitute + Calm Mind Meloetta, Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary, and Shed Skin Scrafty can set up on Alomomola easily, as it cannot inflict status ailments against Pokemon behind Substitutes and lacks the offensive power to break the Substitute. Shed Skin Scrafty can set up and rely on its ability to cure it from status.</p> <p><strong>Status Ailments</strong>: Toxic cripples Alomomola, reducing its longevity and its ability to Toxic stall foes, forcing it to either switch out frequently or rely on a cleric.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wish lets Alomomola heal itself as well as its teammates fairly easily. Protect is used to safely heal Alomomola with Wish, rack up Toxic damage, scout Choice-locked Pokemon, and gain an extra turn of recovery from Leftovers. Although Scald is extremely weak due to Alomomola's base 40 Special Attack, it has a 30% chance to burn the foe, crippling physical attackers such as Escavalier, Rhyperior, and Virizion on the switch. It can also burn common switch-ins such as Venusaur, which doesn't like the residual burn damage. Toxic puts any Pokemon that's not immune to it on a timer and stops them from setting up freely, as well as allowing Alomomola to win stall wars easily. Knock Off can also be used as a utility move to remove Choice items and break the Substitute of Substitute + Calm Mind Meloetta, which otherwise sets up on Alomomola.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs increase Alomomola's overall bulk and give an extra turn of recovery from Leftovers. A spread of 104 HP / 252 Def / 152 SpD with Bold nature can be used to check physical threats such as Life Orb Druddigon and Choice Band Flygon better. Leftovers gives Alomomola residual recovery, which is great when combined with Wish and Protect. Regenerator is used to recover HP while switching out and passing Wish; letting Alomomola focus less on healing itself throughout the match. An Impish nature is used alongside Knock Off to break Substitute + Calm Mind Meloetta's Substitute. A Bold nature increases Alomomola's physical bulk, making it able to deal with heavy hitters such as Swords Dance Samurott better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Alomomola should be used as a mixed wall, switching into any move it's not weak to, as well as providing Wish support for itself and for its teammates that lack reliable recovery. Alomomola should focus on wearing down its foes by burning or poisoning the foe, depending on whether they're physically or specially oriented, as it has poor offensive prowess. The combination of Alomomola's great bulk and Regenerator gives it the opportunity to switch into a lot of attackers, scout their set, and then switch out relatively harmlessly. Remember that Alomomola usually kills momentum, so it should not be used on an offensive team; it is suited better on balanced or stall teams.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can take Electric- and Grass-type attacks are great teammates for Alomomola, such as Venusaur, Roselia, and Virizion. Roselia can use common Alomomola switch-ins as Spikes fodder, while Virizion can use them as setup fodder. Escavalier, Druddigon, Flygon, Houndoom, and Scrafty can also defeat the Pokemon that trouble Alomomola while providing offensive pressure with their sheer power and good bulk. These Pokemon also appreciate Wish support from Alomomola, as they get worn down easily. Clerics such as Aromatisse, Togetic, and Granbull are good partners to Alomomola, as they can remove status that can wear down Alomomola. Bronzong or Registeel can make a great defensive core with Alomomola, as they can counter a good portion of Grass- and Electric-types while Alomomola takes Fire- and Ground-type attacks for them and provides Wish support.</p>"

  "Ferroseed": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its typing that grants it a whopping total of nine resistances and one immunity, as well as its ability to use Eviolite, Ferroseed is an effective defensive Pokemon that is able to check threatening offensive RU Pokemon such as Sneasel and Aerodactyl. In addition to being able to use Spikes, which is much less common than Stealth Rock, Ferroseed has access to a good deal of supporting moves such as Leech Seed and Thunder Wave. Sadly, Ferroseed is weak to two common offensive types in Fire and Fighting and must rely on Leech Seed or Wish support to regain health, as it lacks any other method of consistent recovery. Ferroseed is also greatly crippled if it loses its Eviolite via Knock Off or Trick. Lastly, due to its defensive nature and poor offensive presence, Ferroseed can be easily taken advantage of with Taunt or Substitute.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Due to Ferroseed's rather limited movepool and defensive nature, it doesn't have much else to work with. Ferroseed is capable of using  Stealth Rock if no other teammates have it, but if it's using only Stealth Rock, it faces stiff competition for a teamslot from other bulky Steel-types such as Registeel and Bronzong, and it can be tough to fit both on the same moveset. Toxic can be used to hit Pokemon like Flygon that would otherwise freely remove entry hazards, but Ferroseed's other moves are too important to pass up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Houndoom, Mega Camerupt, and Emboar can easily switch into Ferroseed's attacks and threaten it with their powerful Fire-type moves, although none of them appreciate switching into Thunder Wave, save for Mega Camerupt, or Leech Seed, and Emboar is quickly worn down by Iron Barbs and Flare Blitz recoil.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee, Virizion, and Medicham threaten Ferroseed with their powerful Fighting-type moves. It should be noted, however, that none of these Pokemon except Lum Berry Virizion can switch into Thunder Wave or Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt prevents Ferroseed from using its supporting moves, rendering it nigh useless. Taunt users are scarce in RU, however.</p> <p><strong>Flygon</strong>: Flygon can reliably remove all entry hazards Ferroseed sets up with Defog, is immune to Thunder Wave, and can threaten it with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off Users</strong>: Ferroseed hates losing its Eviolite at the hands of Knock Off users such as Absol and Scrafty, as this drastically reduces its bulk.</p> <p><strong>Magneton</strong>: Magneton can easily switch into Ferroseed, as it resists all of its attacks, is immune to Thunder Wave, and can trap it with Magnet Pull; it can then OHKO Ferroseed with Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types with Fire-type Coverage</strong>: Eelektross and Manectric take little damage from Gyro Ball, are immune to Thunder Wave, with Manectric even receiving a Special Attack boost upon switching into it, and can OHKO Ferroseed with Flamethrower or, in Manectric's case, Overheat.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes damages grounded Pokemon as they switch in. Leech Seed gradually drains the foe's health, providing Ferroseed with a method of recovery. Protect helps Ferroseed gain more recovery from Leech Seed and allows it to scout for coverage moves such as Hidden Power Fire and attacks from Choice-locked Pokemon. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple fast attackers such as Aerodactyl. Gyro Ball hits decently hard thanks to Ferroseed's low Speed and can pressure faster attackers such as Meloetta and Sneasel. Seed Bomb can be used if a more consistent method of direct damage is desired in addition to hitting Water-types such as Samurott more effectively. Knock Off is also a good option to cripple Pokemon like Sigilyph by removing their items. It should be noted that paralyzed foes take less damage from Gyro Ball, so running Thunder Wave and Gyro Ball together is rather counterproductive.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Sassy nature with maximum HP and Special Defense EVs, and 0 Speed IVs maximize Ferroseed's bulk and allow it to take reduced damage from entry hazards while also increasing Gyro Ball's power. If Seed Bomb or Knock Off is chosen over Gyro Ball, a Careful nature with maximum Speed IVs is more effective. Iron Barbs wears down the foe every time it uses a contact move, which works well in conjunction with Leech Seed. Eviolite greatly increases Ferroseed's bulk, making it much harder to KO.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ferroseed's typing is its greatest asset, allowing it to force out common attackers that can't damage it thoroughly such as Sneasel and Aerodactyl, which gives it an opportunity to set up entry hazards or cripple its foes with Thunder Wave. Leech Seed is also useful for putting a timer on most setup sweepers, as it forces them out most of the time, giving Ferroseed even more opportunities to set up entry hazards. Protect can be used to provide an extra turn of Leech Seed recovery and scout for possible coverage moves and Choice-locked Pokemon such as Exploud; it shouldn't be relied on, however, as the foe can set up on the turn Ferroseed uses Protect. Avoid Knock Off at all costs, as losing its Eviolite greatly neuters Ferroseed's defensive capabilities. Iron Barbs punishes the foe for trying to remove the entry hazards that Ferroseed has set up with Rapid Spin. As a bonus, if the foe faints from Iron Barbs recoil after using Rapid Spin, all entry hazards will remain on the field.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Water-types are great overall partners for Ferroseed due to their resistance to Fire-type moves. Alomomola provides Wish support for Ferroseed, while Ferroseed provides a useful resistance to Grass-type attacks in return. Slowking and Jellicent can switch into both Fire- and Fighting-type moves, although neither of them can switch into Knock Off. Diancie can also switch into Fire-type moves for Ferroseed as well as providing Stealth Rock and cleric support. Ghost-types such as Jellicent and Rotom are helpful for spinblocking and switching into Fighting-type attacks. Wish support from Alomomola and Aromatisse, the latter of which can also provide cleric support, is quite appreciated, as Leech Seed is a rather unreliable method of recovery. Fighting-type checks such as Slowking and Granbull are also appreciated to alleviate the pressure that Fighting-types put on Ferroseed. Mega Camerupt can switch into Knock Off and Fire-type attacks to an extent for Ferroseed, while in return, Ferroseed switches into Water-type attacks.</p>"

Its solid defensive typing and decent natural bulk combined with HP investment makes it a soft check to Psychic- and Flying-types that also performs well as an offensive Venusaur check. However, it's easily stopped by common RU physical walls like Druddigon and Steel-types due to its quite limited movepool. Plus, it's weak to common types in the metagame such as Fighting, Ground, and Fire, but it still performs as a unique sweeper in the RU metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Return can hit Water-types neutrally and avoid recoil damage. Magnet Rise lets Klinklang avoid Ground-type attacks and makes it easier for Klinklang to set up versus Pokemon like Flygon or Rhyperior, but Substitute can fulfill this purpose better most of the time. Volt Switch can support the team with momentum. A Shift Gear / Gear Grind / Rest / Sleep Talk set seems appealing, but it requires a heavy amount of team support, and Curse Registeel is better most of the time.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet Users</strong>: Klinklang loses half its HP just attacking defensive Druddigon, which usually runs Fire Punch or Earthquake for coverage as well.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Most Steel-types can take care of Klinklang easily.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shift Gear allows Klinklang to do its job, boosting its Attack by one stage and boosting its Speed by two stages. This lets Klinklang outspeed every relevant Pokemon in the tier. Gear Grind hits twice, breaking Substitutes, Sturdy, and Focus Sashes. Substitute allows Klinklang to set up more easily, avoid status, and check a fair amount of Pokemon, especially slow U-turn pivots. Wild Charge hits bulky Water-types like Alomomola, Blastoise, and Slowking super effectively and hits Steel-types neutrally. Keep in mind that this move causes recoil damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature and full investment in Attack give Klinklang a nice 328 Attack stat, and 148 Speed EVs allow Klinklang to reach 253 Speed, enough to outspeed Adamant Absol. After one boost, Klinklang is able to outspeed Choice Scarf Delphox, the fastest Choice Scarf user in the tier. An alternative spread of 160 HP / 252 Atk / 96 Spe grants more bulk and still allows Klinklang to outspeed Choice Scarf Jolly Drapion as well as Adamant Choice Scarf Flygon after one boost. Clear Body is the only relevant ability Klinklang has, which helps versus Intimidate users and random stat drops. Leftovers is chosen for passive recovery, giving longevity and allowing Klinklang to set up more Substitutes throughout the game.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Klinklang shines as a cleaner when all its checks are weakened enough late-game. However, if you are forced to use it early- or mid-game, Klinklang can also perform as a check to some threats in RU such as Diancie, Venusaur, and Glalie. Substitute lets Klinklang avoid status like Scald from Alomomola or Yawn from Uxie and allows Klinklang to set up versus Pokemon like Flygon. This is also great for scouting moves and sets, especially Choice-locked Pokemon like Choice Specs Magneton or Choice Band Escavalier. Try to avoid Knock Off as much as you can, as Klinklang really appreciates Leftovers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Venusaur works really well with Klinklang to take care of bulky Water-types, while Klinklang acts as a Flying-type sponge and as a soft Psychic-type check. Knock Off variants are especially useful to lure common Steel-types like Registeel or Escavalier and remove their Leftovers. Pursuit trappers like Drapion can take care of Bronzong; Drapion in particular provides Toxic Spikes support. Mega Glalie is the best Spiker in RU, which Klinklang really appreciates. Special Mega Glalie can deal with most bulky Water-types, defensive Druddigon, and the most common hazard removers in the tier, Flygon and Blastoise. Fighting-types like Emboar, Sawk, or Medicham can deal with Steel-types and lure physically defensive Pokemon, and Klinklang helps them by being a Fairy- and Flying-type check. Ground-types like Flygon or Mega Camerupt pressure bulky Steel-types and deal with Magneton, which is a great stop to Klinklang.</p>"

  "Eelektross": {
    "overview": "<p>Eelektross's base 115 Attack and base 105 Special Attack, as well as its large movepool, make it a very versatile Pokemon. Its decent bulk also lets it act as an offensive pivot, tanking hits from foes such as Bronzong and Meloetta whilst dealing significant damage in return. Furthermore, it has virtually no weaknesses thanks to Levitate, which also grants it an immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. However, it is extremely slow, making it difficult to use, as it gets outsped by most Pokemon, including those such as Jellicent and Alomomola which can easily inflict status on it. Furthermore, Pokemon such as Emboar are easily able to KO it, and its lack of reliable recovery outside of Leftovers makes it very easy to wear down through Stealth Rock and constant switching into Pokemon it would usually be able to check. Eelektross is also weak to status ailments, which hinder its performance in the long run, especially from status inducers, such as Alomomola and Jellicent.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dragon Tail can be effectively used with Toxic and entry hazards, dealing large amounts of residual damage. Flash Cannon together with Acid Spray lets Eelektross deal with Aromatisse and Mega Audino, which otherwise wall it. Eelektross can use Discharge instead of Thunderbolt for the increased chance to paralyze the foe in exchange for power. Charge Beam can be used to gradually increase Eelektross' Special Attack, making it more threatening. Eelektross can use Coil to boost its Attack, Defense, and accuracy, allowing Eelektross to use powerful moves with shaky accuracy, such as Rock Slide and Zap Cannon. Drain Punch can also be used to regain some HP, while Aqua Tail can be used to deal with Ground-types, such as Rhyperior and Mega Camerupt, making Eelektross a great Coil sweeper. Eelektross can run Choice Specs or Choice Band to hit extremely hard; alternatively, a Life Orb can also be used to avoid being locked into a move at the cost of some of Eelektross's HP. It can also run Leftovers to recover damage, which helps a lot due to its limited recovery. Eelektross can also run a physically offensive Assault Vest set with an Adamant nature. This would have Thunder Punch as its main STAB move, U-turn in place of Volt Switch so that it doesn't get walled by Ground-types, Knock Off to take out item-reliant foes, and Drain Punch to recover HP. Aqua Tail can be used over Drain Punch to hit Rhyperior and Mega Camerupt. An Adamant nature maximizes such a set's damage output.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Aromatisse, Lickilicky, and Mega Audino can take both physical and special attacks from Eelektross. They can, in return, inflict status ailments on Eelektross while being able to recover health with Wish. Aromatisse and Mega Audino are also immune to Dragon Tail and resist Knock Off, and they can stall Eelektross out with Toxic and pass Wishes to their teammates.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Druddigon resists Electric-type attacks, has great bulk, and can easily dispose of Eelektross with Outrage thanks to its high Attack. Defensive Flygon can stall out Eelektross with Toxic while Roosting off the damage easily, whereas offensive Flygon can take up to three Giga Drains while threatening to KO with Outrage. However, Flygon have to be wary of Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Mega Camerupt</strong>: Mega Camerupt can easily beat Eelektross, as it take little damage from all of its moves apart from Aqua Tail. Mega Camerupt can deal heavy damage to Eelektross in return while preventing it from gaining momentum thanks to its immunity to Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Status Ailments</strong>: Although Eelektross is immune to paralysis, Toxic and burns cripple Eelektross and reduces its longevity. Burns can render physical sets useless, while Toxic reduces puts a timer in Eelektross.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Emboar and Choice Band Flygon can easily KO or severely damage Eelektross.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch makes Eelektross a great pivot, allowing it to deal damage while taking advantage of entry hazard support to wear down its checks, such as Aromatisse, Druddigon, and Mega Audino, while retaining momentum. Flamethrower lets it hit Grass- and Steel-types such as Venusaur, Virizion, and Escavalier super effectively. Giga Drain deals with Ground-types, such as Rhyperior and Seismitoad, which are immune to Volt Switch, and it also allows Eelektross to recover HP. Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit Dragon-types which otherwise wall Eelektross super effectively, such as Flygon. Knock Off has strong utility, removing Leftovers and Eviolite from defensive Pokemon such as Aromatisse, Alomomola, and Togetic, making it easier to pressure them. Knock Off also breaks the Substitute of Substitute + Calm Mind Meloetta, which otherwise uses Eelektross as setup bait. Alternatively, Thunderbolt can be used in the last slot as a more powerful STAB move that OHKOes Clawitzer and Braviary and 2HKOes Spiritomb and Hitmonlee after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eelektross needs maximum HP and Special Attack to be an effective pivot. A Quiet nature boosts Eelektross's Special Attack. Assault Vest boosts Eelektross's Special Defense, letting it tank hits from Meloetta, Rotom-C, and special Virizion. Alternatively, Expert Belt can be used to increase Eelektross' damage output. If Knock Off is not used, the 4 Attack EVs can be moved into Special Defense, and a Modest nature should be used instead of a Quiet nature.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Eelektross should be used as an offensive pivot, switching in and out throughout the match while applying pressure with Volt Switch and coverage moves. If Eelektross has been inflicted with status, it should Volt Switch to a cleric, such as Aromatisse and Togetic. To maintain offensive pressure, Volt Switch to a sweeper such as Hitmonlee, Flygon, Virizion, or Emboar. You should not risk letting Eelektross stay in on hard-hitting foes, such as Hitmonlee and Emboar. Also, make sure that Eelektross doesn't get hit by Knock Off, which will reduce its longevity. If the opponent has a Ground-type Pokemon, you should try to correctly predict the opponent's actions and use the appropriate move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Eelektross is an offensive pivot, it should have a cleric as a partner in case it takes significant damage or is inflicted with a status ailment; examples include Aromatisse, which can provide both Wish and Heal Bell support, as well as Alomomola and Togetic, which can provide Wish and Heal Bell support, respectively. Entry hazard setters put a lot of pressure on the opposing team, as Eelektross forces many switches, racking up residual damage on its foes. Rhyperior and Bronzong are great partners, as they can set up Stealth Rock. Qwilfish, Roselia, and Mega Glalie can stack Spikes, while the former two can stack Toxic Spikes as well. Wallbreakers such as Life Orb Sigilyph, Choice Specs Rotom-C, and Choice Specs Meloetta can be used, as they appreciate Eelektross' ability to give them a free switch with its slow Volt Switch. Flygon is a great partner as well, as it forms a solid VoltTurn core with Eelektross and lures in Alomomola, allowing it to U-turn to Eelektross to gain momentum and pressure the foe.</p>"

  "Accelgor": {
    "overview": "<p>Accelgor's access to Spikes along with its incredible base 145 Speed makes it an effective suicide lead for hyper offense teams. In addition to Spikes, Accelgor also has access to useful moves such as Final Gambit, which lets it prevent entry hazard removal for a turn to keep momentum on your team's side, and Encore, which heavily discourages foes from trying to set up against Accelgor. Its offensive movepool is decent as well, with useful coverage options such as Focus Blast, Giga Drain, and Sludge Bomb, which gives it good late-game cleaning potential alongside its high Speed. In fact, with a Timid nature, Accelgor naturally outspeeds base 80 Speed Choice Scarf users, notably Medicham, as well as anything slower. However, Accelgor faces stiff competition for a teamslot from other Spikes setters such as Omastar, Mega Glalie, and Qwilfish. In addition to this, Accelgor is quite frail, especially physically, leaving it vulnerable to being revenge killed by strong priority moves and fast Choice Scarf users.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fire can be used on the offensive set to hit Escavalier much harder while retaining decent coverage against most other Steel-types. Yawn is a decent support option that can be used to force switches. Knock Off is a good utility move to remove items from Accelgor's switch-ins, but it doesn't have the room for the move, not to mention Accelgor's Attack stat is weak. U-turn is an option for Accelgor to pivot out of its checks, but the lead set is better off using Final Gambit and the offensive set doesn't enjoy giving up valuable coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Defog and Rapid Spin</strong>: Entry hazard removers can remove the Spikes set by Accelgor. They must be cautious of Final Gambit, however, and risk losing a lot of HP if Accelgor is at high health.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Taunt Users</strong>: Mega Banette and Spiritomb can limit Accelgor to one layer of Spikes with Taunt and are immune to Final Gambit.</p> <p><strong>Rhyperior</strong>: Rhyperior can KO Accelgor through its Focus Sash with Rock Blast, limiting it to one layer of Spikes. Keep in mind, however, that Final Gambit and Energy Ball can do serious damage to Rhyperior.</p> <p><strong>Xatu</strong>: Xatu's ability bounces back Spikes, preventing Spikes lead Accelgor from doing its job effectively.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Any Pokemon that is faster than Accelgor can do serious damage to it due to Accelgor's frailty. This mainly includes fast Choice Scarf users, such as Rotom-C, Houndoom, and Meloetta.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Due to Accelgor's frailty, powerful priority users such as Fletchinder and Mega Glalie can do considerable damage to Accelgor. Fletchinder in particular is able to OHKO Accelgor at full health with its priority Acrobatics.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Spikes Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Accelgor's high Speed makes it an effective Spikes lead for hyper offense teams. With Spikes set up, the opponent's grounded Pokemon take extra damage upon switching in, making it easier for Accelgor's teammates to break through walls and eventually sweep. Final Gambit is quite important to ensure Spikes stays set up on the other side of the field; its main use is preventing opposing Rapid Spin and Defog users from clearing entry hazards for one turn, after which an appropriate teammate can switch in and threaten the opponent's entry hazard remover. If Accelgor has high HP left, it will take out a large chunk of the foe's HP as well. Encore is useful for locking the foe into support moves and discouraging setup sweepers from setting up on Accelgor, as well as giving Accelgor opportunities to set additional layers of Spikes. It can also provide Accelgor's teammates with an opportunity to set up. Bug Buzz is Accelgor's strongest STAB move, giving it a way of dishing out damage without always resorting to Final Gambit, which is especially important if Accelgor is Taunted by a foe. Energy Ball is an option over Encore, as this allows Accelgor to heavily damage or KO Rhyperior, which might try to anti-lead against Accelgor. This can help clear the path for teammates such as Houndoom and Tauros.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature, Accelgor naturally outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame. Full investment in HP maximizes Final Gambit's potential damage output. An alternate spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe can be used to increase the damage output of Bug Buzz instead. Focus Sash allows Accelgor to survive any one hit, allowing it to set up two layers of Spikes against foes that attack it outright. Unburden doubles Accelgor's Speed after Focus Sash activates, allowing it to set up two layers of Spikes even against opposing Choice Scarf users.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Accelgor is best used as a lead for hyper offense teams. Be cautious of opposing priority users, such as Hitmonlee and Mega Glalie, as well as Rock Blast users, such as Rhyperior, as these Pokemon can limit Accelgor to a single layer of Spikes. If your opponent brings in a Rapid Spin user to try to remove Spikes, either switch to a teammate that can spinblock or use Final Gambit. If Accelgor is up against a Defog user and Spikes has already been set up, use Final Gambit. This blocks entry hazard removal for a turn, allowing you to bring in a teammate to threaten the foe out and keep entry hazards set up. Final Gambit can also take a serious chunk out of the foe's health if Accelgor is still at high HP, allowing Accelgor to heavily damage or KO a foe that is particularly threatening to your team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ghost-type Pokemon, mostly Jellicent and Mega Banette, are good teammates because they block Rapid Spin, making it easier to keep Accelgor's Spikes set up on the opponent's side of the field. Mega Banette also has priority Taunt, which can prevent Defog, although it should be kept in mind that it has to have already Mega Evolved for that to happen. A fast Stealth Rock user such as Archeops or Uxie can be useful on entry hazard-stacking offense teams. Strong wallbreakers, including Houndoom, Hitmonlee, Emboar, and Choice Specs Meloetta, can all put huge offensive pressure on the opponent and greatly benefit from the entry hazard support that Accelgor provides. Powerful Volt Switch users such as Choice Specs Rotom-C can help to wear down the opponent's team; entry hazard damage combined with Volt Switch can quickly wear down the foe, not to mention Rotom-C can also demolish Ground-types with Leaf Storm. U-turn users also pair well with Accelgor to keep momentum for your team and leave the opponent at a disadvantage, causing the opponent's team to be worn down by Spikes.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bug Buzz is Accelgor's strongest STAB attack, hitting Pokemon such as Sneasel for massive damage. Hidden Power Ground 2HKOes Qwilfish and Garbodor without any prior damage if Accelgor is running a Modest nature; it also OHKOes Magneton. Focus Blast might initially appear redundant in terms of coverage, but it's still useful because it hits Registeel much harder than Hidden Power Ground does. It also gives Accelgor a way to pressure specially defensive Normal-types. Giga Drain provides great coverage against Rhyperior, Gastrodon, and Seismitoad and can also 2HKO specially defensive Alomomola if Accelgor runs a Modest nature. Energy Ball is another option here, allowing Accelgor to OHKO Rhyperior after Stealth Rock, as long as Rhyperior doesn't have a Careful nature. It also ensures that Accelgor 2HKOes specially defensive Alomomola even when running a Timid nature. Spikes is a great option to capitalize on forced switches, helping to wear down your opponent's team. Sludge Bomb 2HKOes Aromatisse, which can otherwise wall Accelgor completely.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment maximizes Accelgor's offensive capabilities. Life Orb increases Accelgor's damage output even further. A Timid nature allows Accelgor to outspeed Timid Jolteon and Choice Scarf Medicham. A Modest nature can be used instead to give Accelgor's attacks even more power, allowing it to 2HKO specially defensive Alomomola with Giga Drain. Though it's situational, Sticky Hold is the chosen ability, as it prevents Trick or Switcheroo users from taking Accelgor's item.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Accelgor can be used at several points during the game. Its high Speed and good coverage allow it to act as a potent revenge killer as needed. Accelgor should not be directly switched into attacks, as its poor bulk means it struggles to take even resisted hits. Accelgor can potentially be used to clean late-game, but keep in mind that its frailty leaves it fairly easy to revenge kill with Choice Scarf or priority users. If running Spikes, it can punish the opponent's switches quite well, providing more residual damage on the opposing team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teammates that can remove entry hazards are appreciated, as Accelgor can be worn down quickly due to its frailty, weakness to Stealth Rock, and Life Orb recoil. Hitmonlee and Kabutops work well in this regard, as they can provide Rapid Spin support and help break past special walls for Accelgor. Wallbreakers such as Hitmonlee, Emboar, and Choice Specs Meloetta make for good teammates, as they can break past the special walls that Accelgor struggles with. If running Spikes, a spinblocker such as Mega Banette or Spiritomb can pair up nicely with Accelgor to help ensure entry hazards stay set up. Flying-types such as Golbat and Braviary are quite threatening to Accelgor, as it lacks super effective coverage against them and they threaten to KO Accelgor with Brave Bird. Strong Electric- or Rock-types such as Jolteon, Magneton, and Kabutops can all serve as great offensive Pokemon to deal with Flying-types.</p>"

  "Druddigon": {
    "overview": "<p>Druddigon boasts an incredible Attack stat with above average defenses, which can make it effective as either an offensive or defensive Pokemon. Its wide movepool provides coverage against threats such as Fairy-types, but it needs support to make effective use of this. Furthermore, access to support moves such as Stealth Rock, Glare, and Roar lets it stand out from the crowd. However, a low Speed stat with only Sucker Punch to compensate makes it vulnerable to being revenge killed easily. It also doesn't have the best matchup versus common entry hazard removers such as Flygon. A lack of reliable recovery hinders Druddigon's longevity. The presence of Fairy-types such as Granbull and Diancie can also hinder Druddigon's ability to freely use its STAB moves. With offensive Ice-types like Sneasel, Mega Glalie, and Abomasnow being common, it can be hard to use Druddigon without being pressured easily.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Druddigon is able to use many alternative coverage moves. On the Life Orb set, Aqua Tail can be used to handle Rhyperior and Mega Camerupt more effectively. Crunch provides more coverage against Psychic- and Ghost-types, but it comes at the cost of losing Sucker Punch's priority. Thunder Punch is a more effective way of dealing with bulky Water-types such as Alomomola and Blastoise as well as certain Eviolite users, mainly Golbat and Togetic. Although it comes at the cost of coverage, Substitute can be used on Life Orb and support sets to offer protection from status and damage, which can give Druddigon a free opportunity to attack. If your team already has a Stealth Rock setter, Druddigon's support set can run RestTalk to make up for its lack of recovery. However, Sleep Talk doesn't need to be run if your team has a cleric such as Aromatisse or Diancie.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Alomomola and Jellicent can safely switch into most of Druddigon's attacks and proceed to spread status. Jellicent may also be troublesome for the defensive set, as most of them carry Taunt. They are also able to pivot out of Outrage, as most are paired up with Fairy-types such as Diancie and Granbull.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Granbull, Togetic, Aromatisse, and Diancie can easily switch into any Druddigon set that lacks Gunk Shot or Iron Tail, though they must be careful because most Fairy-types can't OHKO Druddigon due to their defensive nature and lack of offensive investment.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Registeel, Escavalier, Bronzong, and Steelix resist Druddigon's STAB attacks, but they must be careful of sets with Fire Punch.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Though it's risky, Ice-type Pokemon can switch into Druddigon and threaten it with their STAB moves. They can also come in after their teammate has fainted and KO Druddigon. It does come at a cost, as most Ice-types can't switch into most of Druddigon's moves, hate paralysis from the support set, and can be caught off guard by Fire Punch on the predicted switch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Glare is the best status move Druddigon receives, paralyzing opposing Pokemon to cut their Speed and allowing Druddigon and other teammates to have a better chance against them during the battle. It also has the perk of paralyzing Ground-types. Stealth Rock allows Druddigon to cripple the opposing team's Pokemon by making them take chip damage and breaking potential Focus Sashes and Sturdy. Dragon Tail is Druddigon's main STAB move, which inflicts decent damage and phazes the foe, potentially racking up good damage if coupled with entry hazards. Alternatively, if Dragon Tail's low damage and negative priority annoy you, Dragon Claw can be used. Fire Punch is used to hit Steel-types that would otherwise tank Dragon Tail such as Escavalier and Registeel.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense with an Impish nature allows Druddigon to tank physical hits rather well and spread chip damage via Rough Skin more effectively. Maximum Defense notably avoids an OHKO from Hitmonlee, Medicham, and +2 Fletchinder after Stealth Rock damage. Alternatively, you can use a specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD, which allows Druddigon to take special attacks better and take advantage of its Fire and Electric resistances against Pokemon like Delphox and Jolteon. Rocky Helmet is useful to get more chip damage against physical attackers when coupled with Rough Skin. Leftovers gives Druddigon passive recovery and can work better with a specially defensive spread. Rough Skin is the choice of ability to allow Druddigon to get off some useful chip damage thanks to its defensive EV spread.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Druddigon as a lead to get Stealth Rock up early; if against a threatening Pokemon, you may have to switch multiple times to get it up. Also be cautious when leading, as the opponent may predict you and possibly force a switch out. Always switch out if Druddigon is in KO range against Fairy- or Ice-type Pokemon. Spread paralysis to slow down the opposing Pokemon while also phazing them out with Dragon Tail. Keep Druddigon healthy to have a good switch-in to physical attackers, primarily to resisted attacks. Don't play recklessly with this set, but identity certain Pokemon that may be threatening and use that knowledge to your advantage with Glare. Druddigon should be preserved until the opposing entry hazard remover has been taken care of, so it can freely set up Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes support is always useful to further cripple the opponent's team and can be effective with Dragon Tail, so Pokemon such as Mega Glalie, Qwilfish, Accelgor, and Garbodor are always recommended. This set is very helpful on bulky offensive and balanced teams, as these teams carry slow powerhouses and the support from paralysis is very useful for them. Wish and cleric support is always useful to help out with Druddigon's lack of recovery and remove status; Alomomola, Diancie, and Aromatisse are good options. Hard-hitting Pokemon are recommended to take advantage of the paralysis Druddigon spreads over the opposing team; Pokemon such as Hoopa, Hitmonlee, Escavalier, and Rhyperior are good examples. Pokemon that can handle Fairy-types are very useful to prevent them from threatening Druddigon; some examples are Venusaur, Magneton, and Escavalier. Hoopa is a great spinblocker, preventing Pokemon such as Blastoise and Hitmontop from removing your entry hazards.</p>"
      },
      "All-out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Outrage or Dragon Claw is Druddigon's main STAB move; Outrage is used for more power but unfortunately comes with a confusion effect, and the lock-in can make Druddigon easier to handle for the opponent, while Dragon Claw has no drawbacks but is much weaker. Sucker Punch is used for priority and can help revenge kill fast, weakened Pokemon as well as hit Psychic-types like Delphox and Hoopa super effectively. Fire Punch is used as coverage against Steel-types that can wall Druddigon like Registeel and Escavalier. Gunk Shot is used for coverage against Fairy-types like Aromatisse and Granbull; it can also hit Grass-type Pokemon like Virizion harder. You can use Iron Tail instead, which still handles Fairy-types, notably OHKOing Diancie, but can also 2HKO Rhyperior.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature maximize Druddigon's Attack stat and allow it to hit as hard as possible. 32 Speed EVs are used to outspeed base 50 Speed Pokemon like Registeel and Diancie as well as maximum Speed Mega Camerupt. The rest of the EVs are dumped in HP to give Druddigon some bulk. Life Orb is used to boost Druddigon's already hard-hitting attacks, and Druddigon doesn't incur any recoil on its coverage moves thanks to Sheer Force. Sheer Force is used to give Druddigon's attacks some more power at the cost of their side effects.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Thanks to the power boosts from Sheer Force and Life Orb, Druddigon should be used as a wallbreaker that can scare the opponent and limit their choice of plays. Use certain situations to your advantage to allow Druddigon to come into the battlefield; some of those are Choice-locked Pokemon, safe switches into certain Pokemon like Blastoise, and aggressive double switches if you have to. Use Sucker Punch against weakened Pokemon to potentially OHKO them and against faster Pokemon to get off some damage. Druddigon should avoid Ice-type Pokemon, as the most used ones are able to OHKO or significantly damage it. Do not lock Druddigon into Outrage early-game, as it can be easily revenge killed. Druddigon should be very cautious against Scald users such as Slowking and Seismitoad, as a potential burn severely cuts Druddigon's Attack stat, though it may be fine if they are in KO range. Thanks to Druddigon's bulk, it is able to tank a Fairy-type attack from defensive Fairy-type Pokemon and can strike back with a Gunk Shot or Iron Tail.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Druddigon is best paired up with Escavalier, which resists all of its weaknesses in Ice, Dragon, and Fairy, while Druddigon resists Escavalier's lone weakness to Fire. Escavalier can handle Fairy-types and use Knock Off to cripple bulky walls such as Alomomola, Jellicent, and Eviolite users, which allows Druddigon to threaten them; this creates good defensive and offensive synergy between these two. Wish users such as Alomomola and Aromatisse are great for supporting Druddigon due to its lack of recovery. Great Trick Room users such as Diancie and Slowking can allow Druddigon to outspeed and pressure most faster Pokemon. Entry hazard removers such as Blastoise and Flygon can allow Druddigon to safely switch in without having to take damage. Blastoise can lure in Grass- and Electric-types, which can allow Druddigon to come in and deal with them. Volt Switch and U-turn users are good for allowing Druddigon to come in safely and possibly check or counter the opposing foe. Sweepers really appreciate Druddigon's wallbreaking potential for weakening bulkier Pokemon that would otherwise be troublesome, so Virizion, Sneasel, Aerodactyl, and Jolteon are good partners. Flygon can make a great double Dragon core, as Flygon can keep up momentum with U-turn and send Druddigon onto the battle field, while Druddigon can take care of Fairy- and Grass-types.</p>"

  "Braviary": {
    "overview": "<p>Braviary has well-rounded stats that give it a few good traits like a decent Speed tier, a massive Attack stat, and the ability to create 101 HP Substitutes, which are important for its main set. Coupled with its high Attack, it also has strong neutral coverage provided by its STAB moves alongside some additional tools such as Superpower and Roost. It is one of the best stallbreakers, since very few Pokemon on defensive archetypes can break through its bulk or are faster than it. Defiant gives Braviary the ability to pressure Defoggers, a trait not many Pokemon have, making it great for teams that employ Spikes stackers. Unfortunately, offensive sets are worn down easily because of Brave Bird recoil and Stealth Rock. Braviary also has overlapping weaknesses with other hazard removers, putting some strain on teambuilding. Defensively, Braviary doesn't have a good set of resistances, so it can't be sent out easily without good prediction. It's also weak to common revenge killers such as Jolteon, Aerodactyl, and Sneasel. Finally, Pokemon it otherwise sets up on can run moves to bypass it, like Toxic Diancie and Thunderbolt Registeel.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf can be used to allow Braviary to revenge kill the foe, but there are many Pokemon that wall its STAB moves, forcing it to use U-turn often. Life Orb can be used to increase the power of all of Braviary's moves, but Brave Bird's recoil stacks up with the Life Orb damage, making it hard to use effectively. Sleep Talk can be used on offensive sets to check Sleep Powder Venusaur better. The EVs on the Bulk Up set are subject to change depending on the user; running more Speed can be useful for outpacing faster Pokemon like Exploud and Hoopa, and Special Defense investment could be used to better tank Registeel's Thunderbolt, giving it a 50% chance to break Braviary's Substitute instead of a 100% chance to. Tailwind could be used on Braviary's offensive set to help itself and slower partners break through offensive teams better.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Flying-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Flying-resistant Pokemon such as Steelix, Registeel, Rhyperior, and Diancie can all cover Braviary decently. The former three are able to phaze or break Braviary's Substitutes with the proper move, and the latter two excel at taking hits from the offensive set. They also get an opportunity to set up Stealth Rock, which pressures Braviary later in the match when it has to come back in. However, some of these Pokemon have the potential to get PP stalled if they lack the proper move to deal with Substitute + Bulk Up.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Bulk Up Braviary is more vulnerable to Toxic than offensive sets, but they both get worn down fast by Stealth Rock and dislike having to repeatedly use Brave Bird. Furthermore, some sets are too pressured by certain Pokemon to be able to Roost often if at all, forcing them to have to take hits or come back in on some.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon With Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Pokemon like Mega Glalie, Sneasel, Aerodactyl, Jolteon, Magneton, and Rotom all can pressure Braviary through their STAB moves. They can usually force Braviary out or make it let its Substitute be broken.</p> <p><strong>Substitute-bypassing Pokemon</strong>: Choice Specs Exploud, Meloetta, and Aurorus can all pressure Braviary with their sound-based STAB moves, which hit it regardless of Substitute. Golbat, while not directly breaking Braviary through attacks, can launch a Toxic with Infiltrator and force it to switch out eventually.</p>",

      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute lets Braviary block status from Pokemon such as Registeel and Blastoise. Bulk Up gives Braviary a boost to its Defense and Attack, letting it endure more hits. Roost provides instant recovery so Braviary can continue to set up Substitutes. Brave Bird is a powerful STAB move that, unlike Return, no Pokemon is immune to.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP EVs let Braviary set up 101 HP Substitutes, which cannot be broken by Seismic Toss. The Speed EVs let it outpace uninvested Golbat so that if it has enough Bulk Up boosts, it can KO Golbat before it lands a Toxic or Taunt. The rest of the EVs go into Special Defense so it can take hits from defensive Pokemon such as Jellicent and Mega Audino better. Leftovers gives it passive recovery to make up for the lost HP when creating a Substitute. Defiant lets it punish Intimidate Pokemon like Granbull and Qwilfish, which might try to weaken Braviary's attacks a little bit, and gives it a boost from Defog. 92 Speed EVs could be run instead to outspeed Pokemon like Hoopa, Xatu, and Exploud.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Braviary should only be setting up once all of its checks and counters are weakened enough to the point that it can win. This prevents Braviary from coming in later and being more pressured to Roost. It's also important to keep Stealth Rock off your side of the field so Braviary can come in at full HP. If your opponent has Flygon or any other Defogger, applying entry hazards to pressure them before Braviary sets up is a good idea, since it forces your opponent into a lose-lose situation. Almost always try to avoid status conditions while you can, as they hinder Braviary's ability to consistently be at a good amount of HP and keep a Substitute up at the same time.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removers like Flygon, Blastoise, and Hitmonlee are good options to prevent Braviary from being worn down too much. Flygon is capable of coming in on Electric-types and threatening all of them bar Eelektross with Earthquake. Blastoise can provide a decent Ice-type switch-in and a Rock-type check and can even give Braviary more setup opportunities by getting some Scald burns. Hitmonlee can also support Braviary through checking Registeel, Ice-types, and Rock-types. Lanturn synergizes really well with Braviary, since it is a good counter to Magneton, one of Braviary's biggest counters, and can provide Braviary with Heal Bell and Volt Switch support. Braviary can check Grass-types like Venusaur and be a decent Ground-type switch-in in return. Hazard setters such as Registeel and Rhyperior love Braviary's ability to pressure Defoggers, since they are forced to either leave them up or give Braviary a Defiant boost. Toxic Spikes setters also appreciate Braviary pressuring these foes and fending off two off the most common Poison-types in Venusaur and Qwilfish; since it often takes a long time to set up, Toxic Spikes helps to rack up extra damage. Pokemon that resist Ice like Alomomola, Hariyama, and Bronzong make for good partners to check one of Braviary's weaknesses. Mega Camerupt and Rhyperior can check another one of its weaknesses, Electric.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird is a very strong STAB move that helps to punch holes and KO Grass- and Fighting-types. Return is a secondary STAB move that has good neutral coverage against the metagame and doesn't cause recoil damage. Superpower nails the Pokemon that can switch into Braviary's STAB moves like Registeel and Magneton. U-turn can snatch some momentum for your team and apply pressure to Malamar. Roost can be used when holding Sharp Beak; it helps Braviary last longer on the battlefield and can sometimes weaken super effective hits by removing Braviary's Flying typing.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment lets Braviary outpace Pokemon like Hidden Power Fire Venusaur and non-Choice Scarf Emboar. Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature gives Braviary as much power as possible to break through teams. Alternatively, a Jolly nature can be used to help outspeed Absol, Sawk, and neutral-natured Gallade and Medicham. Choice Band gives a huge power boost to all of Braviary's attacks at the cost of not being able to switch moves. Alternatively, Sharp Beak only boosts Braviary's most important move, Brave Bird, but gives it the opportunity to run Roost if you wish to. Defiant allows Braviary to gain a +2 Attack boost if any of its stats are lowered by the foe, making it a great tool when combined with entry hazard setters.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to bring Braviary on resisted or weak attacks like Venusaur's Giga Drain and Aromatisse's Moonblast. For the most part, Braviary is going to want to use Brave Bird or U-turn as much as possible throughout the match to weaken the opponent's team and only use Return or Superpower on Electric- or Steel-types, respectively. Try to keep entry hazards off the field whenever possible, as Braviary is already taking enough recoil damage from Brave Bird. Inversely, try to always keep your hazards up if the opponent has a Defogger so you can force 50/50s and potentially get a boost off of Defog.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Braviary appreciates Speed control, whether through Thunder Wave or Tailwind, so Pokemon like Uxie and Tailwind Flygon make for good partners. Braviary fits best on VoltTurn playstyles, so having other Pokemon that use U-turn or Volt Switch like Jolteon, Scyther, and Rotom make for great partners. Braviary helps to check Venusaur, so Pokemon that can benefit from that like Virizion and Sawk make for good partners. In return, they can break down Registeel, Diancie, and Rhyperior, making Braviary less reliant on prediction to get past them. Entry hazard removers like Flygon and Kabutops make for good partners that help to keep Braviary healthy. Hazard setters like Smeargle, Garbodor, and Diancie appreciate Braviary's Defiant letting them potentially keep their hazards up for longer, giving Braviary a way to power through foes faster.</p>"

  "Virizion": {
    "overview": "<p>Virizion is one of the best offensive Pokemon in the RU tier. With a fantastic Special Defense stat and a solid set of resistances to common Grass-, Electric-, Water-, and Rock-type moves, Virizion is able to come in on a multitude of threats and begin setting up with Swords Dance or Calm Mind. While many setup sweepers struggle with a less-than-stellar Speed stat, Virizion doesn't have this issue, as its great base 108 Speed stat puts it in front of dangerous offensive Pokemon, including Flygon, Manectric, and Houndoom. While Virizion doesn't have the greatest attacking stats, its access to Swords Dance and Calm Mind makes up for this. These unique traits give Virizion a strong matchup against most teams that lack threats faster than it. However, while Virizion has high-Base Power STAB moves to utilize, it has an otherwise shallow offensive movepool. Its STAB combination is resisted by common Poison- and Flying-types, such as Weezing, Venusaur, and Togetic, which will almost always reliably check Virizion. While Virizion's typing is very good overall, it does leave it weak to common Fire-, Flying-, and Ice-type moves in a tier where plenty of dangerous Pokemon have access to them. If you can overcome these very few shortcomings, Virizion will be sure to do very well for you and it is a fantastic option for virtually any offensive team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Virizion's movepool is fairly shallow, but it does have a couple of other options to consider. It has access to Taunt and Synthesis to create a bit of a stallbreaker set, but this tends to waste Virizion's amazing offensive potential. Sacred Sword could be used over Close Combat if the defense drops are really bothersome for you, but the power drop is very significant and thus the move is generally not worth it. Substitute and Hidden Power Fire are options on the Calm Mind set; however, Substitute means Virizion is walled by virtually any Pokemon that resists its STAB combination, while Hidden Power Fire really only hits Escavalier and requires an imperfect Speed IV.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon, especially physically offensive ones, such as Aerial Ace Aerodactyl, can usually keep Virizion's damage to a minimum. Choice Scarf variants of Emboar and Medicham can also work well due to their super effective STAB moves. Sneasel, Mega Glalie, and Abomasnow all have Ice Shard to pick off Virizion after some chip damage or Close Combat defense drops.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Venusaur, Weezing, and Garbodor are notable Poison-types that can deal with Virizion. They resist both of its STAB types and only fear Zen Headbutt from the Swords Dance variant. Venusaur needs to be careful of boosted Hidden Power Ice from the Calm Mind set, however.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Sigilyph, Delphox, and Xatu resist both of Virizion's STAB types, but they need to be careful of Stone Edge. Delphox cleanly beats Calm Mind variants. Sigilyph and Xatu have a 4x resistance to Fighting, but they can be beaten by Hidden Power Ice from the Calm Mind set.</p> <p><strong>Fletchinder</strong>: Fletchinder has a 4x resistance to Grass and resists Fighting as well. Gale Wings Acrobatics ensures a Virizion sweep ends on the spot. A stray Stone Edge will instantly KO Fletchinder, though.</p> <p><strong>Togetic</strong>: Stone Edge and Hidden Power Ice hurt, but Togetic can switch into any of Virizion's STAB moves. It can cripple Calm Mind sets with paralysis and wear down Swords Dance variants with Dazzling Gleam or Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Granbull</strong>: Granbull has Intimidate to soften hits from Swords Dance sets and can use STAB Play Rough to OHKO Virizion. If it's at maximum HP, Granbull can take a +1 Giga Drain from Calm Mind sets and KO Virizion back in emergency situations.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Virizion's flagship set in RU is a simple Swords Dance set. The goal is to come in on a resisted attack, threaten out the foe with a super effective STAB move, and begin setting up with Swords Dance. Close Combat is Virizion's strongest STAB option, and it hammers the likes of Registeel, Mega Glalie, and Aggron very hard. Leaf Blade is a safer STAB move without any drawbacks that is used to deal with the common Water- and Ground-types Virizion can switch into, such as Alomomola, Blastoise, and Rhyperior. The last slot gives Virizion much-needed coverage against Pokemon that resist its STAB combination. Stone Edge is usually the preferred option because Fire- and Flying-types are typically harder to handle defensively, and hitting Pokemon, like Delphox, Sigilyph, and Togetic is generally the better way to go, as the former two are quite difficult to switch into, while the latter can't immediately KO Virizion while it gets 2HKOed by a +2 Stone Edge. Zen Headbutt is an option to beat Poison-types such as Venusaur, Garbodor, and Weezing more reliably. However, keep in mind that these are generally defensive in nature, making them easier to switch into.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs couldn't be any simpler for a physical sweeper. A Jolly nature is required to allow Virizion to outspeed the likes of Manectric, Delphox, and Flygon. Lum Berry gives Virizion more flexibility in setting up against more defensive Pokemon, especially bulky Water-types that Virizion loves to switch into. Life Orb is an option that makes Virizion less dependent on setting up with Swords Dance, and it notably allows Virizion to score a 2HKO on Granbull, but it will have a harder time switching into bulky Water-types due to the threat of Scald burns. Justified is Virizion's only ability, but the Attack boost from being hit by stray Dark-type moves is definitely useful.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Virizion is best saved for mid- or late-game situations in which it can set up on a defensive Pokemon and sweep once its checks and counters are weakened or outright removed. If you have to use it early-game to remove a dangerous threat, it's generally best to just use the appropriate move rather than setting up when the opponent likely still has a way of dealing with Virizion. Virizion can switch into bulky Water-types and set up Swords Dance reliably when it's wielding a Lum Berry. If Virizion is using Life Orb, you will likely need to wait until late-game to try to sweep with Virizion due to the recoil damage and lack of protection against status moves. However, due to the item's power boost, Virizion won't always need to use Swords Dance to facilitate a sweep. If possible, keep Virizion's coverage move hidden until the opponent sends in a Pokemon against which it is effective. The lone exception would be Fletchinder, as Gale Wings will force Virizion to catch it on the switch with Stone Edge due to the priority given to Acrobatics.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>When it comes to teammates, preferred ones will largely depend on the coverage move Virizion decides to use. Without Zen Headbutt, Virizion appreciates teammates that can remove Poison-types such as Venusaur, and Garbodor. Fire- and Psychic-type Pokemon, such as Sigilyph, Emboar, Meloetta, Hoopa, and Delphox, generally fare well against these foes. Fire-types are especially useful, as they tend to attract bulky Water-types that Virizion can use to set up on. If Virizion lacks Stone Edge, it will need partners to remove Sigilyph, Delphox, and Togetic. Houndoom can reliably beat Sigilyph and Delphox, while Steel-types, such as Aggron, have little to fear from Togetic. Fletchinder poses a major problem, as Virizion will be unable to sweep as long as it is around due to its access to Gale Wings and Acrobatics. Eelektross, Aggron, Diancie, and Aerodactyl can all beat Fletchinder reliably; however, the latter three need to be wary of Will-O-Wisp. Granbull can be troublesome thanks to Intimidate, a resistance to Fighting, and access to a super effective physical STAB move in Play Rough. Steel-types, such as Escavalier, Magneton, and Aggron can tank Play Roughs comfortably and KO back with their powerful STAB moves.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind boosts Virizion's Special Attack to very threatening levels while also making it extremely difficult to revenge kill with special attacks, and Virizion is able to utilize it quite effectively due to its good set of resistances, high Speed, and good STAB coverage. Giga Drain is Virizion's primary STAB option, as it deals solid damage and keeps Virizion in good health from Life Orb recoil and possible resisted attacks it takes while setting up. Focus Blast is a powerful STAB move that is extremely useful considering most Pokemon resistant to Fighting-type moves in RU focus on Defense; although it is inaccurate, it's the only special Fighting-type STAB Virizion has access to. Hidden Power Ice rounds out the set by hitting the many Grass- and Flying-type Pokemon that attempt to stop Virizion from sweeping.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Virizion needs all of the Special Attack and Speed investment it can get. 252 Speed EVs keep it ahead of Manectric, Delphox, and Flygon, while the Special Attack investment is necessary to maximize damage output. Life Orb is the item of choice, as Virizion needs all the power it can get, and it has a self-healing move in Giga Drain to help offset the recoil. It's tempting to use Leftovers with this set, but the drop in power is pretty significant and Giga Drain is usually enough to keep Virizion healthy enough to sweep late-game.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As Virizion carries Giga Drain on this set, it can come in more freely early-game to check threats. This will also help when Virizion attempts to sweep, as the continuous recovery will keep Virizion out of revenge killing range from the likes of Choice Scarf Flygon. While Focus Blast is the strongest move on this set, Virizion should only use it when absolutely necessary; its accuracy is shaky at best, and a miss against the wrong target could result in a premature end to Virizion's sweep. Keep Hidden Power Ice unrevealed until the opponent sends out a Grass- or Flying-type. You should seek out setup opportunities late-game against bulky Water- and Ground-types to send Virizion in to sweep the rest of the opposing team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fire-types can cause this set problems; Delphox, in particular, is the biggest issue, as Virizion lacks Rock-type coverage and is outpaced by Choice Scarf variants. Houndoom is a notable teammate, being immune to both of Delphox's STAB options. Slowking, Alomomola, Diancie, and Rhyperior are capable of handling most other Fire-types reliably. Meloetta, Manectric, and Aggron generally fare well against many common defensive cores in RU, thus weakening opposing teams for Virizion. Entry hazard support is useful to wear down Fire-types quicker. Rhyperior and Diancie can set up Stealth Rock and reliably beat Fletchinder; they also tend to lure in Water-types that Virizion can use as setup fodder late-game. Qwilfish and Garbodor can set up Spikes and tend to draw attention from Ground-types; the former also lures in Electric-types quite often. Virizion has no chance of sweeping if Fletchinder is left on the opposing team, so make sure you have Pokemon that can remove it reliably. Aggron, Aerodactyl, and Diancie fit the bill well, as does Rhyperior.</p>"

  "Meloetta": {
    "overview": "<p>Meloetta is one of the most dangerous Pokemon in RU due to its large movepool and excellent stats, allowing it to fulfill a myriad of roles such as a wallbreaker and Calm Mind user. As a result, Meloetta finds its place on a wide variety of teams. Meloetta also has a unique typing that grants it an immunity to Ghost-type attacks, a quality shared by no other Psychic-type, which in tandem with its immense Special Defense stat, allows Meloetta to serve as a blanket check to various special attackers such as Sigilyph and Venusaur. However, Meloetta has a weakness to common Dark-type attacks such as Pursuit, allowing Spiritomb, Sneasel, and Absol, among other Pursuit users, to trap it. Despite its decent Speed tier, Meloetta is still outsped by many offensive threats such as Houndoom, Drapion, and Virizion, making it a struggle to perform at its best in certain matchups.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Relic Song can be used to change Meloetta into its Pirouette forme with a set consisting of Relic Song, Return, Close Combat, and Knock Off and an EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe plus a Jolly nature. A specially defensive set has some merits on Meloetta due to its great Special Defense and access to support moves such as Thunder Wave, Heal Bell, and Perish Song, but it tends to struggle due to it being easily Pursuit trapped. Work Up is an interesting option to utilize both of Meloetta's formes, though it is strapped for moveslots, limiting its effectiveness. Hyper Voice and Shadow Ball are alternative moves to use on Substitute + Calm Mind sets, but Psychic and Focus Blast have better coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Spiritomb</strong>: Spiritomb is immune to both of Meloetta's STAB types, is immune to Focus Blast, and only takes neutral damage from Shadow Ball, though it must be wary of Dazzling Gleam. In return, Spiritomb is able to revenge kill Meloetta with Sucker Punch, Pursuit trap it, or set up Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel and Rock-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Bronzong fear nothing from Meloetta besides the rare Shadow Ball and can either use it to set up Stealth Rock or hit it with Gyro Ball. Assault Vest Escavalier can shrug off any of Meloetta's attacks and Pursuit trap it. Diancie is able to stomach many of Meloetta's standard attacks and retaliate with a Diamond Storm, whereas Rhyperior can switch into a Hyper Voice and tank most of Meloetta's attacks at least once and threaten it with its STAB moves or Megahorn.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Drapion is a decent check to Meloetta, as it naturally outspeeds Meloetta and threatens it with STAB Knock Off, but it really dislikes taking a boosted Hyper Voice or Focus Blast. It also has Toxic Spikes, which greatly hampers Meloetta's Substitute + Calm Mind set. Houndoom and Absol are also good checks that are capable of exploiting Meloetta's reliance on its Psychic-type attacks to swap in on it and threaten it with their ferocious Dark-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Many Pokemon are able to revenge kill Meloetta, such as Choice Scarf Flygon, Medicham, and Sneasel. Choice Scarf Flygon in particular is able to outspeed Meloetta regardless of its set and threaten it with U-turn.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute allows Meloetta to avoid status moves such as Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, and Thunder Wave, as well as letting it survive a hit without taking heavy damage. Calm Mind boosts Meloetta's Special Attack and Special Defense, which makes it hit much harder and makes its Substitutes harder to break with special attacks. Psyshock is the STAB move of choice as its use is imperative in order to allow Meloetta to beat opposing Calm Mind users such as Slowking and Diancie. Focus Blast has excellent coverage alongside Psyshock, allowing Meloetta to hit Pokemon such as Registeel, Scrafty, Absol, Drapion, Bronzong, and Houndoom.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP EVs significantly increase Meloetta's overall bulk and prevent its Substitutes from being broken by Seismic Toss. 48 Speed EVs plus a Timid nature allow Meloetta to outspeed important Pokemon such as Adamant Absol and Choice Specs Exploud. The rest of the EVs go into Defense to allow Meloetta to take physical attacks much better. Leftovers allows Meloetta to heal lost HP from Substitute.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to Meloetta's versatility, it is able to force a lot of switches, providing turns to freely set up a Substitute or Calm Mind. Switching into passive defensive Pokemon such as Uxie and Alomomola generally works best for setting either Substitute or Calm Mind, but be wary of switching into any status moves, as poison and burn greatly hinder this set's effectiveness. Knock Off is a problem for this set, as even a weak Knock Off can break Meloetta's Substitute and the move removes its Leftovers if Meloetta is not behind a Substitute. Though Houndoom and Drapion do check this set very well, it is worth noting that if Meloetta is at +1 and behind a Substitute, it is able to take down both after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Any grounded Poison-type such as Drapion or Qwilfish or entry hazard remover pairs well with Meloetta due to its ability to remove Toxic Spikes, which makes the set much less effective. Specially based Flygon works well with this set because it is able to take down problematic Steel- and Rock-types such as Escavalier and Rhyperior, as well as remove entry hazards from the field with Defog. Qwilfish is a great partner, as it absorbs Toxic Spikes and sets up Toxic Spikes of its own, allowing Meloetta to stall out Pokemon as it sets up Substitute and Calm Mind. Emboar is a great partner for this set, as it takes on Spiritomb, threatens Steel- and Rock-types, and lures in Pokemon that Meloetta can use as setup bait, such as Alomomola and Jellicent. Aromatisse is another great partner, as it freely switches into Spiritomb and threatens it with Moonblast while also providing Wish and Heal Bell support to keep Meloetta healthy and free of status. Alomomola pairs well with this set due to its ability to switch in on Pokemon that give this set problems, such as Escavalier, and heal Meloetta with Wish. Because Meloetta is forced out by faster Dark-types such as Houndoom and Drapion, pairing it with Hitmonlee works well because it threatens Houndoom with Mach Punch and is able to provide Rapid Spin support.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hyper Voice has great neutral coverage and has the added bonus of hitting Pokemon behind a Substitute. Psychic is a great secondary STAB move that hits Pokemon such as Venusaur and Virizion super effectively and is the most powerful move Meloetta has on the set to hit Ghost-types with. Focus Blast has great coverage with Meloetta's STAB combination, allowing it to hit Steel- and Dark-types such as Registeel, Bronzong, Escavalier, and Scrafty. U-turn is a great move for retaining momentum, allowing Meloetta to switch out of a check or counter for a teammate to take advantage of. Dazzling Gleam is mainly for hitting Spiritomb, but it has the added bonus of hitting Scrafty harder than Focus Blast. Grass Knot is another option to hit Rhyperior and Seismitoad while still scoring the 2HKO on Spiritomb.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs plus a Timid nature allow Meloetta to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible, while maximum Special Attack EVs ensure that Meloetta hits as hard as possible. Choice Specs is the item of choice, as it significantly increases Meloetta's damage output, allowing Meloetta to wallbreak. Colbur Berry or Assault Vest can be used over Choice Specs to take advantage of Meloetta's coverage and power, but using those items to lessen weaknesses to various threats.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Make sure to bring Meloetta in safely with U-turn or Volt Switch or after a Pokemon has fainted. Make sure to predict the opponent's switch-in and use the appropriate attack to deal heavy damage. For example, if the opponent has a Steel-type on their team, use Focus Blast to catch them on the switch. Due to Meloetta's naturally high Special Defense, it is able to take powerful neutral hits such as Exploud's Boomburst after Stealth Rock damage if needed. Against more defensive teams, U-turn is great move to use early-game, as Meloetta tends to bait in Steel- and Dark-types and switching out against these Pokemon ensures Meloetta keeps offensive momentum. Be wary of Knock Off, as it deals significant damage to Meloetta, if not outright OHKOing it, and reduces Meloetta's damage output by removing its Choice Specs. Try to be cautious when using Psychic, as Dark-types can switch in after a Pokemon has fainted to Pursuit trap Meloetta.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Setup sweepers such as Nasty Plot Houndoom pair well with this set, as they appreciate Meloetta's ability to wallbreak. Houndoom is also a notable partner due to its ability to use Meloetta's most common switch-in, Spiritomb, as setup bait. Emboar is a great partner for this set, as it is able to check the Pokemon that this set tends to have issues with such as Drapion, Houndoom, Escavalier, and Spiritomb. Rotom-C and Jolteon also pair well with Meloetta, as both form a VoltTurn core with it, allowing them to switch into each other's checks and counters. Due to Meloetta's ability to force many switches, entry hazard support makes this set even more potent, so Spikes users such as Accelgor, Mega Glalie, and Qwilfish pair well with Meloetta. It is also worth noting that Qwilfish in particular pairs well, as it checks many physical attackers that threaten Meloetta, while in return Meloetta covers Qwilfish's weakness to Psychic-type attacks. Paralysis support from either Uxie or Druddigon helps Meloetta take on offensive teams much more easily, and both are also capable of setting up Stealth Rock to support Meloetta. Kricketune and Leavanny are also good partners, as they both provide Sticky Web support, which allows Meloetta to tear through offensive teams.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind boosts Meloetta's already impressive power to incredible levels, allowing it to bypass most bulky Pokemon with greater ease. Psychic is the primary STAB move, as it has sufficient power while hitting neutrally and is stronger than Psyshock against the majority of the Pokemon in the tier and thus works better after a single Calm Mind boost. There are also few targets in RU that Psyshock would have a distinct advantage over Psychic against. Focus Blast deals massive damage to Steel- and Dark-types, OHKOing Houndoom and smacking Registeel and Drapion hard after a Calm Mind boost. Shadow Ball is used to cover Psychic-types, allowing Meloetta to easily check Sigilyph while hitting the bothersome Bronzong, Slowking, Uxie, and Delphox. Dazzling Gleam is primarily used to target Spiritomb, but it also takes down the likes of Scrafty, Absol, and Sneasel without having to risk Focus Blast's accuracy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed maximizes Meloetta's offensive potential, with a Timid nature making use of its Speed tier to avoid lagging behind the likes of positive-natured Hitmonlee, Rotom-C, Venusaur, and Medicham. The remaining EVs are placed into Defense to slightly improve Meloetta's weaker physical bulk, plus Meloetta's other stats do not really need improvement in comparison. Colbur Berry temporarily mitigates Meloetta's Dark weakness, which allows it to either survive a Dark-type STAB move to be able to retaliate, or to KO the likes of Hitmonlee and Emboar without the risk of being taken out by Sucker Punch. Serene Grace is Meloetta's only ability, but as many of Meloetta's attacks, most notably Psychic, have a chance to lower Special Defense, this can be notable, as it gives Meloetta the potential to overwhelm the foe with repeated hits.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Offensive Calm Mind Meloetta can put immediate pressure against most teams due to its high power and effective neutral coverage, and the fact that it isn't easily revenge killed by Dark-types can make it difficult to dispose of quickly. However, Meloetta's lack of a boosting item means it often needs to use Calm Mind before it can start doing significant damage. Meloetta's best opportunities to set up Calm Mind would be against Poison- and Fighting-types that it threatens to immediately KO, such as Venusaur, non-Choice Scarf Emboar, Qwilfish, Gurdurr, and Weezing. Alternatively, Meloetta can set up on special attackers that can't do much to it, such as Sigilyph, Calm Mind Virizion, and non-Knock Off Hoopa, or simply use its high Special Defense to set up and absorb a blow from slower special attackers. Keep in mind that offensive Calm Mind Meloetta is rather prone to status, which means it might not find many safe boosting opportunities or might fail to sustain a sweep for very long. This means that offensive Meloetta is meant to break down teams in a faster, more reckless fashion, and it usually only needs one Calm Mind boost to do so, making it a good fit for offensive teams.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting-types like Virizion, Medicham, and Sawk can help remove Dark-type threats for Meloetta and appreciate Meloetta checking or weakening Psychic-types for them. Dazzling Gleam Meloetta is a particularly appealing teammate for Medicham, as it can heavily cripple if not outright OHKO Spiritomb, allowing Medicham to rampage. Dark-types such as Sneasel and Drapion can help non-Shadow Ball Meloetta against opposing Psychic-types, especially with Pursuit, and like having Meloetta break down the opposing team for them to clean up. Meloetta can also be paired with a fellow Psychic-type, such as Delphox or Sigilyph, as it can lure in and weaken Pursuit users to give its brethren more breathing room, and the two Pokemon can help to weaken each other's checks. Stealth Rock support is generally favored, as Meloetta may fail to achieve key KOs otherwise, such as an OHKO on Drapion with +1 Focus Blast, as well as a significantly higher chance to OHKO offensive Spiritomb with +1 Dazzling Gleam. Examples of Stealth Rock users include Diancie, Rhyperior, Seismitoad, and Bronzong, which can help Meloetta against most problematic faster physical attackers. Will-O-Wisp from teammates also offers a form of residual damage and gives Meloetta potential setup opportunities against the physical attackers it cripples; some of its users even benefit Meloetta further, such as Fletchinder handling Escavalier or Spiritomb trapping Psychic-types.</p>"

  "Delphox": {
    "overview": "<p>Delphox is a great offensive Pokemon in RU; in fact, the fiery fox can hold its own against most playstyles, from full-out stall to hyper offense. Its Fire / Psychic typing grants it a decent STAB combination that hits Pokemon such as Bronzong, Escavalier, Hitmonlee, Registeel, and Poliwrath for super effective damage and helps it add a good amount of defensive synergy for an offensive Pokemon, resisting Grass-, Fighting-, Fairy-, Fire-, and Psychic-types. This is further complemented by Delphox's nice movepool, with gems such as Dazzling Gleam, Grass Knot, Calm Mind, and Trick in addition to its STAB moves.</p> <p>Sadly, although its 104 base Speed allows it to outrun many relevant Pokemon, such as Hitmonlee, Flygon, Mega Glalie, Hoopa, Qwilfish, and Sigilyph, it falls tantalizingly short of many other faster attackers, including Virizion and Aerodactyl. For all its resistances, Delphox doesn't have very good bulk and is easily worn down by entry hazards and status moves, notably taking 25% damage from Stealth Rock. Due to its secondary Psychic typing, it struggles against the common Sucker Punch and Knock Off, as well as Pursuit users, which give the Choice Scarf set a heck of a hard time. Houndoom is also a huge blockade for Delphox because it's immune to both of Delphox's STAB moves. Though it does compete for a teamslot with other Fire- and Psychic-types, including Houndoom, Delphox possesses keen versatility and a knack for breaking down defensive cores, which makes it a great pick in RU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An all-out attacking set with Life Orb and Fire Blast, Psychic, Dazzling Gleam, and Grass Knot could be useful if your team prefers the coverage, though this sacrifices Delphox's ability to beat more defensive teams. Psyshock is a viable alternative to Psychic because it hits with similar power, although Psychic hits the vast majority of Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Alomomola harder. Delphox can wield a Choice Specs along with the same moves as the Choice Scarf set, allowing it to hit insanely hard, but it usually prefers the Speed or ability to switch moves. Leftovers gives Delphox some passive recovery and works well in conjunction with Substitute on the Calm Mind set, but it comes with a notable decrease in power. If your team can handle Pokemon like +1 Speed Scrafty and Choice Scarf Flygon decently, several different moves can replace Dazzling Gleam on the Choice Scarf set. Will-O-Wisp burns troublesome Pokemon on the switch in, Calm Mind allows Delphox to boost up once it's gotten rid of its Choice Scarf, and Hypnosis is an option that, despite its low accuracy, can put Houndoom or a bulky Water-type out of commission for a few turns. Shadow Ball can be used to hit Jellicent and Hoopa harder than any of Delphox's other moves. Overheat is a decent option on a Choice Specs or the Choice Scarf set for more power. Consequently, Flamethrower can be used for the increased accuracy, but the power drop is not worth it. Will-O-Wisp cripples Delphox's offensive switch-ins, such as Spiritomb and Drapion. Running Sunny Day and Solar Beam is a pretty nice combination, although Delphox doesn't really have the bulk or Speed for the job and doesn't get access to Chlorophyll. Similarly, Magician + Power Herb and Solar Beam makes for a decent way to deal with Alomomola and Jellicent and steals the foe's item, but Knock Off puts this strategy in jeopardy, and running Magician means that Delphox loses out on the possible Blaze boost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Drapion, Houndoom, Sneasel, Absol, and Spiritomb can trap Delphox with Pursuit when it's Choice locked into a Psychic-type attack, although all but Houndoom should be careful of switching into Fire Blast. Absol, Skuntank, Houndoom, and Spiritomb possess Sucker Punch and can KO Delphox, though they should be wary of Substitute. Delphox is also prone to Knock Off, as many Fighting-types use the move for coverage. Though it's not a Dark-type, Aerodactyl can Pursuit trap Delphox as well.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Alomomola, Slowking, and Jellicent can take on most of what Delphox has to offer, but they should be careful about switching into Trick or Grass Knot. Delphox can also beat them with enough Calm Minds (two or more) under its belt, though Slowking can fend off and cripple the Calm Mind set and Waterfall Alomomola can soften Calm Mind sets considerably to allow a revenge killer to finish off Delphox.</p> <p><strong>Powerful, Faster Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Aerodactyl, Jolteon, Sneasel, and Virizion as well as Choice Scarf Hoopa and Hitmonlee can all outrun and defeat Delphox with a single swift move, though they should watch out if Delphox is holding a Choice Scarf.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Entry hazards are an excellent means of wearing Delphox down; Stealth Rock in particular shaves off 25% of its health and makes it quite a bit easier to knock out. Delphox also doesn't appreciate status effects of any kind, as Toxic wears it down and Thunder Wave users such as Slowking rob Delphox of its great Speed.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Powerful priority moves such as Sucker Punch, Aqua Jet, and Fletchinder's Acrobatics take advantage of Delphox's subpar Defense stat and are capable of felling Delphox with enough chip damage. Again, Sucker Punch users should watch out for Substitute.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set is probably Delphox's most well-known set and can be customized depending on your likings and what your team is trying to achieve. Fire Blast is Delphox's main method of roasting foes, as it's got a high 110 Base Power. Psychic is the best option in the second slot, as it's a powerful STAB option that hits Pokemon such as Alomomola, Qwilfish, and Gastrodon for good damage, making it better than Psyshock most of the time. Calm Mind gives Delphox the power to sweep through its checks while also giving it good matchups against stall and other defensive team archetypes. Grass Knot is the preferred move in the last slot, as it helps tie up a few loose ends left behind by Delphox's STAB moves. In particular, Grass Knot OHKOes Rhyperior and has a decent chance to OHKO Gastrodon after Stealth Rock. Substitute protects Delphox from status moves and shields it from heavier blows. It also gives Delphox a means of playing mind games with Sucker Punch users. Dazzling Gleam is another option in the third or fourth slot and allows Delphox to actually touch Houndoom, as well as hitting Dragons such as Flygon and Druddigon harder; it 2HKOes all three of them.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs are thrown into Special Attack and Speed to maximize Delphox's offensive capabilities, with a Timid nature to make use of its great Speed. The 4 remaining EVs go into HP to attain the Salac Berry boost after setting up only three Substitutes. Blaze gives a hefty boost to Fire Blast when Delphox is at 33% of its health or below, and thus is the preferred ability. Life Orb offers an appreciated boost to Delphox's Special Attack. Salac Berry is a decent option if you choose to run Substitute, as the Speed boost can help Delphox clean up faster teams. Colbur Berry could reduce the damage taken from a stray Knock Off or priority Sucker Punch, possibly preserving Delphox's sweep. However, Colbur Berry should really only be utilized if you're running Dazzling Gleam.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Since Delphox offers a good amount of defensive synergy to its team, it's fine to use it to switch into special resisted hits, such as Venusaur's Leaf Storm, any of Sigilyph's moves, and Abomasnow's Giga Drain or Blizzard; however, it has a hard time switching in if Stealth Rock is on the field, and a misprediction on your part can lead to an untimely death. Remember not to let Delphox take physical hits most of the time because its Defense is mediocre. Delphox can switch in throughout the battle to take on threats, but because Delphox is good at sweeping slower, weakened teams, it should usually be preserved for late-game. Delphox can usually find an opening to set up and sweep if you play well with the rest of your team early- to mid-game. Notably, Aromatisse and Togetic are practically an invitation to lunch, though you should be wary of the odd Toxic or Thunder Wave. Find ways to wear down Delphox's checks, especially Houndoom, before attempting to set up and sweep. Substitute should be used against more passive walls whose only means of touching Delphox is a move like Toxic; this would include Pokemon such as Aromatisse and Togetic. Against Pokemon that can hit Delphox harder, such as Alomomola or Venusaur, a good strategy is to use Calm Mind to boost Delphox's Special Defense and then use Substitute the following turn. After setting up on and taking out a Pokemon such as Togetic, you should aim to have a Substitute intact so that Delphox can take a hit from a hard-hitting attacker, such as Sneasel or Aerodactyl, without fainting.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defog or Rapid Spin support is very much appreciated, considering how easily Delphox is worn down by entry hazards. Flygon delivers the goods while taking on Ground- and Rock-types, and Blastoise can spin away hazards and synergizes well with Delphox, resisting Water-type moves and threatening Rock- and Ground-types. Hitmontop is another good option for hazard removal, as it offers a key resistance to Knock Off. Generally, you want to pick Pokemon that will synergize well and can cover Delphox's weaknesses. Virizion synergizes greatly with Delphox, taking on all the Knock Offs and Water-type attacks for Delphox while Delphox can take Ice, Fire, and Psychic moves in return. Virizion can also weaken Delphox's checks, and vice versa. Pokemon that can beat Houndoom are definitely recommended; in particular, Diancie can pivot into Houndoom and KO it with Diamond Storm or lay down Stealth Rock to limit Houndoom's opportunities to switch in. Similarly, Omastar, Rhyperior, and Accelgor can wear down Houndoom, Spiritomb, Drapion, and other checks to Delphox by laying down entry hazards.</p> <p>Since this set can get revenge killed by faster Pokemon, it's a good idea to run bulky pivots, such as Granbull, that can take hits throughout the match while keeping up momentum. Alomomola and Aromatisse are more passive but can stomach stronger hits and heal their team with Wish. In a similar boat, having some fast Pokemon of your own to KO opposing revenge killers isn't a bad idea. Hitmonlee and Accelgor are decent examples of such revenge killers. Defensive Slowking can be a problem for Delphox because it can stomach a +1 Grass Knot and retaliate with Dragon Tail or Thunder Wave, both of which Delphox doesn't like. Therefore, Steelix or similar leads can lure in Slowking and cripple it with Toxic, while Pokemon that resist Water, such as Jellicent and Virizion, can switch into Slowking without too much to fear.</p>"
      },
      "Speedy Roaster (Choice Scarf)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Equipped with a Choice Scarf, Delphox can fulfill the noble role of revenge killer for its team. Fire Blast is Delphox's main STAB move and attains great coverage, even on its own. Psychic is a powerful secondary STAB attack; though it doesn't roast opponents like Fire Blast does, it's useful when you encounter a Pokemon that resists Fire or when you can't afford to miss a move. Dazzling Gleam hits the majority of Dark- and Dragon-types hard, such as Scrafty, Spiritomb, Flygon, and Druddigon. Trick can cripple a member of the opponent's team and free up Delphox's moveslots when used correctly.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in Speed and Special Attack maximize Delphox's damage output and swiftness, with a Timid nature to make certain that Delphox can outrun Choice Scarf Flygon. Choice Scarf turns Delphox into a potent revenge killer and helps patch up some of its Speed problems versus offensive teams. Blaze is Delphox's only semi-useful ability; it provides a 1.5x boost to Fire Blast when Delphox is at 33% HP or below, which can happen often due to Delphox's mediocre but passable defenses.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Delphox mostly serves as a revenge killer for its team, but it can also step forward to mop up weakened parts of the opponent's team. Since Delphox is a revenge killer, don't make bold predictions and lose it too early. Most of the time, it's not good to subject it to strong hits in the early- or mid-game, though weaker resisted attacks are fine for Delphox to switch into. It's important to play with Trick the right way; only hand off the Choice Scarf to a passive or very slow Pokemon, and make sure Delphox has done its job first. One exception, though, would be if the benefit of crippling a certain wall, such as Quagsire, is greater than that of being able to KO a faster Pokemon later in the game. Another good idea is to avoid locking Delphox into Psychic if there are Pursuit users on the opposing team and the switch is really obvious. However, if you're fairly sure that your opponent is switching in a Fire-type check, such as Mega Camerupt, Psychic is a relatively safe play.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Delphox fits in well on balanced or offensive teams looking for a powerful revenge killer. Defog and Rapid Spin support are also a good idea to complement this set: Flygon, Blastoise, and Hitmontop can provide this. Since Choice Scarf Delphox doesn't have the offensive presence of a setup sweeper, strong wallbreakers such as Diancie, Virizion, and Sawk are highly recommended to pressure and break down the opposing team's defensive core. These Pokemon can also switch into Knock Off users, which is another necessity when running Delphox. Venusaur can tear down defensive cores well and offer some synergy with Delphox. Entry hazards from Registeel, Mega Glalie, and Steelix can help guarantee some key KOs for Delphox. For example, Stealth Rock guarantees the OHKO on Venusaur. Packing something that can take down Pursuit users is a good idea for this set, as Delphox can fold so easily to Dark-types if you predict wrongly. Virizion can take on most Dark-types and uses Spiritomb as setup fodder. Granbull and Mawile are also good defensive answers to Dark-types.</p>"

  "Fletchinder": {
    "overview": "<p>Fletchinder has an excellent ability in Gale Wings, giving +1 priority to Acrobatics and Roost and making it a great late-game cleaner. Though Fletchinder has a mediocre Attack stat, its access to Swords Dance mitigates this issue. Despite having a decent defensive typing, Fletchinder's frailty prevents it from taking too many hits, although it is able to set up on various Pokemon that can't OHKO it, such as Escavalier and Hitmontop. It also has a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, which takes away 50% of its health, meaning that Fletchinder always requires being paired with specific teammates that are able to remove entry hazards.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt can be used to stop the foe from healing or using status moves, but Acrobatics and Swords Dance are mandatory and Will-O-Wisp and Roost are better utility moves. U-turn allows Fletchinder to gain momentum and switch out of its checks and counters, but Fletchinder has no room for it either. A bulkier set with Eviolite and Tailwind, Will-O-Wisp, and Aerial Ace can be used as a team supporter, but Fletchinder still has mediocre bulk with Eviolite. Liechi Berry with Natural Gift can be used with Overheat and Acrobatics to surprise Rhyperior and Quagsire, but it is really situational, it works only once, and Acrobatics will not be boosted until the item is used.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Rhyperior, Omastar, Kabutops, Aurorus, and Regirock resist Acrobatics and can KO Fletchinder back with their super effective STAB attacks. However, physically offensive Rock-types do not enjoy a burn. Omastar and Aurorus can also set up on Fletchinder.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Eelektross and Jolteon resist Acrobatics and can beat Fletchinder in return with their super effective STAB attacks. The latter is OHKOed by +2 Acrobatics after a bit of prior damage, however.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Lanturn and Alomomola can wall and threaten Fletchinder with their STAB attacks. Clawitzer can take an unboosted Acrobatics and can KO Fletchinder back in return. Quagsire doesn't care about any boosts due to Unaware and can do massive damage to or inflict a status ailment on Fletchinder in return.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steelix can outpower Fletchinder even when burned, and it can set Stealth Rock and phaze Fletchinder as well as use Earthquake while Fletchinder uses Roost. If it paralyzes Fletchinder with Thunder Wave, Registeel has a chance of winning 1v1. Bronzong has access to Toxic and can also use Earthquake as Fletchinder uses Roost.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Fletchinder hates Stealth Rock, as it loses half of its health when switching into it, either forcing it to Roost or leaving it at low health, making setup difficult.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Fletchinder hates status ailments, as Toxic and Thunder Wave both hinder Fletchinder, as they limit its sweep.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Fletchinder's Attack to dangerous levels, letting it sweep through anything that doesn't resist Acrobatics. Acrobatics without an item has 110 Base Power, making it Fletchinder's strongest STAB move. Backed by Gale Wings, Acrobatics makes Fletchinder an excellent late-game cleaner. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers that try to switch into Fletchinder, such as Rhyperior and Aerodactyl, and lets Fletchinder set up on physical attackers, such as Escavalier and Scrafty, after burning them. Roost gives Fletchinder reliable recovery; it also has +1 priority due to Gale Wings, so Fletchinder can recover first most of the time.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Gale Wings gives priority to Flying-type moves, making Fletchinder a terrifying attacker. Fletchinder is not carrying any item so that Acrobatics will have 110 Base Power, and Fletchinder also can switch into Knock Off from Escavalier and Scrafty. The HP EVs give Fletchinder an odd HP number, meaning that it can come into Stealth Rock two times. 104 Defense EVs ensure Fletchinder will never be 2HKOed by any move from Choice Band Escavalier, assuming it gets burned after Fletchinder switches into it, as well as avoiding the 2HKO from Knock Off from the likes of Swords Dance Drapion and Dragon Dance Scrafty. Fletchinder can also run a spread of 72 HP / 252 Atk / 184 Spe with an Adamant nature in order to outspeed Adamant Absol, and therefore move first with priority Acrobatics to avoid mindgames with Absol's Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Swords Dance on a predicted switch or a Choice-locked Pokemon with a move that Fletchinder resists, and attempt to plow through the opposing team. Fletchinder forces Pokemon such as Hitmonlee, Emboar, Scrafty, and Virizion to switch, and it can set up while they are switching out. Fletchinder is also a great revenge killer for weakened foes or Pokemon that are weak to Acrobatics. During the early-game, Fletchinder should be used to spread Will-O-Wisp, weakening the opponent's team with burns. Remember that Fletchinder is really frail and should only be sent into resisted hits, such as Grass- and Bug-type attacks. A slow U-turn or Volt Switch should be used to give Fletchinder a safe switch, in as it doesn't have the bulk to take most attacks. Removal of Stealth Rock is recommended before switching Fletchinder in, as otherwise it will lose 50% of its health, making setup more difficult. Only set up after all of Fletchinder's counters are weakened or beaten, as Fletchinder will either beat the opposing Pokemon or be beaten due to its poor bulk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Blastoise, Hitmontop, Flygon, and Hitmonlee are great partners, as they can remove entry hazards as well as deal with bulky Rock- and Steel-types. Bulky Rock-, Electric-, and Steel-types wall Fletchinder. Eelektross can use Volt Switch to bring Fletchinder in safely, as well as deal with bulky Water-types and Ground-types with Thunderbolt, Flamethrower, or Giga Drain. Grass-types such as Shiftry, Virizion, and Rotom-C can deal with bulky Water-types as well. Physical wallbreakers such as Life Orb Hitmonlee and Life Orb Emboar are good teammates to dent the opposing team, allowing for an easier cleanup for Fletchinder.</p>"

  "Aromatisse": {
    "overview": "<p>Aromatisse functions as one of the best clerics in RU thanks to its very useful typing, good bulk, and bulky offensive utility thanks to Moonblast and RestTalk. With these qualities, Aromatisse can take on many common threats such as Hitmonlee, Druddigon, Virizion, and Scrafty well. It also has mild offensive presence with its base 99 Special Attack and access to STAB Moonblast to hit the things it checks fairly hard. Furthermore, Aromatisse is not vulnerable to Taunt and Encore thanks to its ability Aroma Veil, which grants it an immunity to said moves, making it harder to stop from setting up and healing off damage with Calm Mind and Rest, respectively. However, Aromatisse is relatively easy to pressure, as Rest is its only form of reliable recovery, leaving it to the mercy of Sleep Talk after it heals. Aromatisse is also vulnerable to many common Pokemon in the tier, such as Fletchinder, Escavalier, and Registeel. Aromatisse also has to deal with coverage moves, such as Gunk Shot from Druddigon and Trick / Switcheroo.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Trick Room is one of Aromatisse's most notable options. It makes for a great asset for Trick Room teams, as it possesses a Taunt immunity and a Dark resistance, which are key assets for such team archetypes. It also makes for a nice lure with Hidden Power Fire and Thunderbolt due to its base 99 Special Attack. Aromatisse has several miscellaneous offensive options such as Thunderbolt, Energy Ball, and Psychic, but none of these are particularly useful on Aromatisse. It also has Light Screen and Reflect to support its team, but Aromatisse would rarely actually find room to run such options. Beyond this, Aromatisse has a relatively barren movepool.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types, such as Escavalier, are all capable of taking down Aromatisse with Iron Head and can take on anything Aromatisse has to offer. Magneton can also take on Aromatisse using Flash Cannon. Curse Registeel can set up on Aromatisse and proceed to take it down.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types and Poison-type Moves</strong>: Venusaur can take on Aromatisse with Sludge Bomb, and prevent it from using Rest with Sleep Powder. Drapion can wear down Aromatisse with Poison Jab. Gunk Shot from Pokemon such as Druddigon and, to a lesser extent, Mega Banette, can also take Aromatisse down as it tries to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types are capable of enduring a Moonblast and, in many cases, use Aromatisse as complete setup fodder. Fletchinder, Delphox, and Houndoom can all set up on Aromatisse and proceed to take it down with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind Sweepers</strong>: Calm Mind variants of Meloetta and Sigilyph can use Aromatisse as setup fodder and proceed to remove it from the battle.</p>",

Aromatisse primarily aims to set up on Pokemon it can wall, as well as passive walls such as Alomomola. It can set up on several physical attackers such as Hitmonlee, Mega Banette, and, to a lesser extent, Druddigon. It can also set up on Alomomola with ease.

  "Malamar": {
    "overview": "<p>Malamar is an excellent stallbreaker thanks to its access to Contrary and Superpower, allowing it to quickly gain boosts when attacking and making it a major threat for the opponent to deal with after just a few turns. Malamar has decent bulk with investment, granting it easy setup opportunities against slower walls; it also has coverage options which aid it greatly once it has set up. Its ability allows it to take advantage of Defog, Intimidate and random Defense or Special Defense drops. Knock Off lets Malamar remove choice items and Life Orb allows Malamar to better check special attackers and gives it an advantage mid-game by removing Leftovers. However, Malamar's lackluster typing, extreme susceptibility to Bug-type moves, such as U-turn, disappointing speed, and average bulk hurt it a lot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hypnosis allows for added setup opportunities with Superpower by incapacitating foes. Psycho Cut provides Malamar with a solid option against Fighting-types instead of relying on boosting up with Superpower constantly. Taunt gives Malamar a solid option to prevent status and also halt slower hazard setters at the start of the game. Rock Slide is a nice option, enabling Malamar to OHKO Fletchinder, thus getting rid of a huge threat. A Choice Scarf set is usable and has the ability to use Malamar's support movepool, namely Switcheroo, but it's generally outclassed by other Choice Scarf users and Malamar is best used as a stallbreaker anyways. Destiny Bond allows for the removal of a slower threat that Malamar would not be able to OHKO. A Trick Room + Life Orb set can be used on a slower team in order to support the slow wallbreakers with Trick Room and take advantage of it too by being able to run maximum Attack investment to hit as hard as possible. Substitute provides a way for Malamar to block status while also allowing the option of boosting up against passive walls. Block is a cool option to prevent passive walls from switching and be able to boost up against such Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Defensive Fairy-types</strong>: Aromatisse, Mega Audino, Granbull, and Togetic can all easily tank any of Malamar's attacks, due to their Fairy typing resisting both of Malamar's attacking moves, and retaliate.</p> <p><strong>Bug-type Moves</strong>: Escavalier can check Malamar by threatening it out with a STAB Megahorn. Megahorn Rhyperior, SD Megahorn Samurott, and various U-turn users, particularly Flygon, can also keep Malamar in check.</p> <p><strong>Quagsire</strong>: Quagsire doesn't care for anything Malamar throws at it because of Unaware, although non-Curse Quagsire cannot actively beat Malamar.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Strong special attackers such as Signal Beam Jolteon, Mega Camerupt, etc., can easily OHKO Malamar.</p>",

      "Contrary Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Superpower is Malamar's best way of utilizing Contrary, as it makes Malamar bulkier and stronger while also allowing it to break past the likes of Drapion and Mega Steelix. Knock Off, Malamar's most ideal STAB attack, allows it to cripple and wear down its usual checks. The combination of Rest and Sleep Talk allows Malamar to boost in the face of more passive threats while not fearing status.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Speed EVs allow Malamar to outrun Jolly Scrafty, as well as Modest Exploud. 248 HP EVs allow Malamar to have as much bulk as possible with the Defense boosts from Superpower. The rest of the EVs are added to Special Defense to complement the Defense boost from Superpower. Maximum Special Defense investment can also be used, as it allows Malamar to take on stronger special attackers more easily, outlast standard defensive Togetic if it does not consistently get high rolls with Dazzling Gleam, and switch into Clawitzer in a pinch and remove Life Orb, therefore eventually outlasting it with RestTalk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Malamar in on passive walls and use either Knock Off if the opponent has a counter, such as Aromatisse, or Superpower if they lack a direct defensive check. Ideally, Malamar should be used as a check against Psychic-types and status sponge. Do be wary of random U-turn users that can take off a good chunk of health from Malamar, certain examples being Uxie and Meloetta. Be careful with using Superpower against defensive teams, as its PP is limited and easy to stall out by good switches. Rest should be used when Malamar has a status condition or is unhealthy, but do aim for a boost before doing so as a sleeping Malamar is very easy to take advantage of.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Malamar generally does not require support to function, any provided is usually auxiliary. Partners that can punish the use of U-turn such as Rough Skin Druddigon are good, as they discourage those Pokemon from using those kinds of moves in the face of Malamar. Steel-types that can handle Fairy-types, examples being Registeel and Escavalier, make for good partners. Registeel is also able to set up Stealth Rock on the switch, while Escavalier can trap foes with Pursuit. Pokemon that can lure in Spiritomb such as Dazzling Gleam Meloetta make for good partners too. Cleric support from options such as Aromatisse and Togetic is appreciated due to Malamar's reliance on RestTalk; Aromatisse and Togetic are also able to fend off Spiritomb. Qwilfish can be a nice partner due to the Toxic Spikes support it provides, allowing to wear down Malamar's checks by turn-per-turn poison damage.</p>"

  "Barbaracle": {
    "overview": "<p>Barbaracle's access to Shell Smash gives it a good niche in the RU metagame. With great base 105 Attack and Tough Claws, Barbaracle hits very hard, especially after a boost. Barbaracle's solid Defense and typing make it easier for it to set up. Furthermore, Barbaracle outspeeds the entire unboosted tier after one Shell Smash. However, the imperfect accuracy of Barbaracle's STAB moves can prove fatal at times, while its low special bulk can make setting up difficult. Barbaracle also receives competition as a Shell Smash user from Omastar, which shares Barbaracle's typing and has a stronger STAB move.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set with Focus Sash and the moves Stealth Rock, Shell Smash, Razor Shell, and Stone Edge can prove useful as a suicide lead. Barbaracle gets a variety of moves that get boosted by Tough Claws. Low Kick OHKOes Registeel and has a greater chance to OHKO Omastar than Barbaracle's STAB moves. Grass Knot 2HKOes Gastrodon and Quagsire and OHKOes Seismitoad, while the rest of Barbaracle's moves fail to do so. Shadow Claw has a chance to OHKO Jellicent and offensive Cofagrigus.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types, such as Virizion and Rotom-C, prevent Barbaracle from setting up and can OHKO Barbaracle with their respective Grass-type moves. Defensive Venusaur can take a boosted hits from Barbaracle and OHKO back with Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Seismitoad and Gastrodon can easily take most boosted hits from Barbaracle and Gastrodon can take a boosted Grass Knot if it's healthy, but standard Seismitoad is OHKOed by Grass Knot. Quagsire can completely wall Barbaracle unless it runs Grass Knot due to Unaware, but Barbaracle can break through Quagsire if it gets a Defense drop with Razor Shell. Poliwrath can take a boosted Poison Jab from Barbaracle and easily OHKO it with Focus Blast, and Scald from Choice Specs Poliwrath has a good chance to OHKO Barbaracle after a bit of prior damage. Alomomola can take a boosted hit from Barbaracle and cripple it with status. If Barbaracle's Lum Berry is intact, Alomomola can come in after switching out repeatedly and attempt to inflict status on it again due to Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Due to Barbaracle's solid Defense, it doesn't take too much damage from priority attacks even after Shell Smash's stat drops, but after Barbaracle has received enough chip damage, priority attacks can finish it off, most notably Mach Punch from Hitmonlee and Gurdurr and Vacuum Wave from Poliwrath.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash allows Barbaracle to sweep by boosting all of its offensive stats by two stages. Razor Shell is Barbaracle's most reliable Water-type STAB move and is boosted by Tough Claws. Stone Edge is a Rock-type STAB move that hits most Pokemon that resist or are immune to Razor Shell extremely hard. Poison Jab hits Aromatisse super effectively and prevents Grass-types such as Virizion and Rotom-C from revenge killing Barbaracle.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Tough Claws boosts the power of Barbaracle's contact moves. Lum Berry is useful, as status ailments, especially burn and paralysis, greatly hinder Barbaracle's effectiveness. Shuca Berry lets Barbaracle set up against a variety of Pokemon such as Mega Glalie without Freeze-Dry, Flygon, and Rhyperior. Barbaracle can run Focus Sash to set up against threats that would otherwise prevent and Rhyperior. Barbaracle can run Focus Sash to set up against threats that would otherwise prevent it from setting up such as Jolteon and Medicham. White Herb removes Shell Smash's Defense and Special Defense drops to make Barbaracle less prone to priority and enable it to take weaker attacks better. 252 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature are used to obtain as many KOs as possible, though a Jolly nature is also feasible, as it lets Barbaracle outspeed Jolly Choice Scarf Flygon and Timid Choice Scarf Delphox after a boost. With 252 Speed EVs, Barbaracle outspeeds the entire unboosted tier after a Shell Smash.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is best for Barbaracle to set up later in the match after its checks and counters have received a fair amount of chip damage or have been removed. Barbaracle can set up on Pokemon such as Emboar Choice-locked into Flare Blitz, unboosted Sneasel, and, with Lum Berry, Fletchinder. With Shuca Berry, Barbaracle gets ample opportunities to set up on Pokemon that would otherwise threaten it with Ground-type moves. Pokemon with strong priority, such as Hitmonlee, should be eliminated before attempting to sweep. The only Choice Scarf Pokemon that outspeed Adamant Barbaracle after a boost are Timid Delphox and Jolly Flygon, so these two should have their items scouted for before attempting to sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Exploud can easily break down walls for Barbaracle. Omastar and Barbaracle can break down each other's checks and counters, as they lure in some of the same Pokemon. Venusaur takes on most Grass- and Water-types and can put a foe to sleep with Sleep Powder. Mega Glalie can lure in and heavily dent bulky Water-types while also being able to set up Spikes to further wear down Barbaracle's checks and counters. Fire-types such as Delphox and Houndoom can break down Grass-types for Barbaracle.</p>"

  "Clawitzer": {
    "overview": "<p>Clawitzer is one of the best wallbreakers in RU thanks in part to its high base 120 Special Attack. While it does face some competition as a special Water-type wallbreaker from the faster Samurott, Clawitzer makes up for this with Mega Launcher and a wide range of coverage moves such as Aura Sphere and Dark Pulse. It also has decent bulk for a wallbreaker, allowing it to take some hits if need be and retaliate with a strong attack. On the downside, Clawitzer is slow, making it an easier target for faster bulky Pokemon such as Rotom-C. Additionally, its lack of recovery and susceptibility to all forms of entry hazards and Life Orb recoil make Clawitzer easy to be revenge killed in a weakened state.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Grass is an option for Clawitzer to hit Seismitoad and Gastrodon harder than any of its other moves, but neither Pokemon usually runs investment in Special Defense, so Life Orb-boosted Dark Pulse or Aura Sphere 2HKOes both after Stealth Rock damage regardless. Choice Specs or Choice Scarf can turn Clawitzer into a powerful wallbreaker or an unexpected revenge killer, but Clawitzer can be easily taken advantage of once locked into a move. U-turn could be utilized in conjunction with Choice Specs or Choice Scarf, but it would force Clawitzer to give up a coverage move. Water Pulse gets a boost from Mega Launcher and is stronger than Scald, but the chance to cripple physical attackers with a burn from Scald outweighs the added power and possible confusion chance that Water Pulse provides. Dragon Pulse also gets a boost from Mega Launcher and can hit Dragon-types such as Druddigon harder than Ice Beam, but it provides little coverage otherwise. Assault Vest, a seemingly good option, takes away from Clawitzer's ability to wallbreak, as Clawitzer would miss out on the extra power that Life Orb provides.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Despite being a threatening wallbreaker, Clawitzer is very slow even with maximum investment in Speed, so Pokemon such as Emboar and Exploud can easily outspeed and do away with Clawitzer with their strong attacks.</p> <p><strong>Virizion</strong>: Virizion can outspeed and handle Clawitzer with either Leaf Blade or Giga Drain, but it must be wary of switching in on a predicted Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: While they can't directly switch in to any of Clawitzer's attacks, Electric-types such as Jolteon and Rotom-C can outspeed and OHKO it with Thunderbolt. Assault Vest Eelektross can tank any hit from Clawitzer and can threaten to KO with its Electric-type STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Clawitzer is easily worn down by all forms of entry hazards, and the recoil from Life Orb makes it difficult to efficiently wallbreak over time. While Clawitzer doesn't mind being burned or poisoned, it will be worn down over time from other causes.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: While most special walls are 2HKOed by Clawitzer's attacks, specially defensive variants of Alomomola, Aromatisse, and Mega Audino can easily sponge any of Clawitzer's attacks and either restore their health using Wish or Rest or simply use Clawitzer as setup fodder in the case of the latter two.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald hits for ample damage and can cripple physical attackers such as Escavalier with a burn. Ice Beam provides coverage against Grass- and Dragon-types such as Venusaur and Druddigon while also hitting Flying-types such as Togetic; additionally, Virizion can be hit as it switches in. Dark Pulse gets a boost from Mega Launcher and allows Clawitzer to hit Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Meloetta and Jellicent for super effective damage. Aura Sphere also gets a boost from Mega Launcher and 2HKOes Dark-, Ice-, Normal-, and Steel-types such as Scrafty, Eviolite Sneasel, Audino, and Registeel and ensures an OHKO on Mega Glalie after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in Special Attack along with a Modest nature maximize Clawitzer's wallbreaking capabilities. 252 EVs in Speed allow Clawitzer to outspeed Pokemon such as uninvested Golbat, uninvested Meloetta, and Adamant maximum Speed Scrafty. While it might seem enticing to use a Timid nature to outspeed the likes of Adamant Emboar and Modest Exploud, it isn't worth the loss of power. Life Orb boosts the power of Clawitzer's attacks at the cost of some health. Mega Launcher is Clawitzer's only ability, providing a boost to all of its pulse moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Clawitzer is a wallbreaker first and foremost, so it should be used early- and mid-game to dent the opponent's team to make it easier for its teammates to come in and clean up. Scald is the primary attack to use to attempt to get a burn and deal out damage, while Ice Beam should be used on a predicted switch to a Pokemon that resists Water such as Virizion or Druddigon, and Dark Pulse is used to nail Jellicent, which is immune to Scald and Aura Sphere and resists Ice Beam. Despite having respectable bulk, Clawitzer should avoid switching in on strong attacks if you plan to use it at a later point. It is best to send Clawitzer in after a teammate has fainted or from a slow Volt Switch or U-turn from Pokemon such as Eelektross.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Clawitzer appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Uxie, Druddigon, and Bronzong, as this wears down foes switching in. Examples include being able to guarantee 2HKOs on Golbat and specially defensive Meloetta with Ice Beam and Dark Pulse, respectively, after Stealth Rock damage. Uxie and Druddigon can also provide paralysis support to make up for Clawitzer's low Speed, and Druddigon can switch in on Grass- and Electric-type attacks aimed at Clawitzer. Sticky Web support from either Kricketune or Leavanny also helps in making up for Clawitzer's low Speed. Setup sweepers that appreciate Clawitzer's wallbreaking capabilities, such as Houndoom and Fletchinder, make for good partners. Electric-types such as Jolteon and Rotom-C can switch in on Electric-type attacks aimed at Clawitzer while it handles Ground-types for them. Eelektross also makes for a good partner, providing a slow pivot for Clawitzer and taking Electric- and Grass-type attacks aimed at it. Though it isn't mandatory, Clawitzer can also function well under Trick Room with support from Pokemon such as Aromatisse and Bronzong. If you plan to use Clawitzer under Trick Room, then use an EV spread of 248 HP / 252 SpA / 8 SpD with a Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs.</p>"

  "Aurorus": {
    "overview": "<p>Aurorus's access to one of the best offensive STAB types in the tier, Ice, and Refrigerate, which boosts its Normal-type moves to monstrous power, make a potent offensive threat. It has a niche over similar wallbreakers such as Exploud with its useful utility moves, Stealth Rock and Rock Polish. Aurorus is a good user of Stealth Rock because it is able to threaten nearly every Defog user with its Ice-type STAB moves, and it can even clean offensive teams thanks to its ability to outspeed the entire tier after a Rock Polish boost. However, Aurorus still possesses an extremely horrible defensive typing that gives it six common weaknesses, including 4x ones to Steel and Fighting and a weakness to Stealth Rock. This, coupled with its low Speed before a Rock Polish boost, limits its ability to switch into attacks and set up. Finally, Steel-types such as Bronzong and Escavalier can easily counter Aurorus, meaning it needs team support to weaken these Pokemon before it can substantially threaten the opposing team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Using four attacks with a Life Orb can give Aurorus room to run coverage moves such as Dark Pulse and Hidden Power Fire, allowing it to threaten Bronzong and Escavalier; however, Aurorus generally prefers the utility of either Stealth Rock or Rock Polish, both of give it a niche over other wallbreakers like Exploud. Aurorus can also use Choice Specs to hit extremely hard, but this isn't preferred for the same reasons. Assault Vest can be tempting when looking at Aurorus's good special bulk, but Aurorus is a horrible user of the item. It is very prone to being worn down by entry hazards; has many common weaknesses; and with an Assault Vest, loses out on much-needed power and the ability to use crucial moves like Stealth Rock and Rock Polish. Finally, Nature Power is an option over Hyper Voice that allows Aurorus to avoid Sucker Punch and has a decent chance of inflicting a status condition, but Aurorus generally prefers the extra power.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Bronzong and Escavalier can easily shrug off any attack Aurorus throws at them, and retaliate with a 4x super effective move. Registeel can also take an Earth Power reasonably well and potentially cripple it with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers with a Super Effective Move</strong>: While almost no offensive Pokemon can directly switch into a Hyper Voice, many Pokemon can capitalize on Aurorus's numberous weaknesses and low Speed to revenge kill it, such as Magneton and Emboar.</p> <p><strong>Mach Punch Users</strong>: Due to Aurorus's 4x weakness to Fighting-type moves, Mach Punch users such as Hitmonlee and Gurdurr can easily end its sweep.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Aurorus's power can punch large holes in most Pokemon, but many specially bulky Pokemon can take a hit from Aurorus and cripple it in return. For example, Calm Mind Meloetta can use Aurorus as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Aurorus's susceptibility to all forms of entry hazard and Life Orb recoil lets it get worn down easily.</p>",

      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Aurorus is a good user of Stealth Rock because it can utilize its immense offensive presence to keep it on the field. Hyper Voice is Aurorus's strongest STAB move due to it being boosted by Refrigerate. Freeze-Dry hits Water-type Pokemon hard, being able to 2HKO Alomomola. Finally, Earth Power rounds out coverage by hitting Steel- and Fire-types such as Aggron and Houndoom. Dark Pulse and Hidden Power Fire can be used over Earth Power to hit Bronzong and Escavalier, respectively, both of which would otherwise have little to fear from Aurorus. Dark Pulse also hits Jellicent hard. However, Earth Power generally has the best consistency, as in addition to Houndoom, it deals with the less common Delphox and Registeel as well.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs with a Life Orb are used to hit as hard as possible. A Timid nature is usually preferred over a Modest nature in order to outspeed Adamant Scrafty and Speed tie with Jolly Scrafty. Aurorus will also be able to outspeed Modest Exploud, which it checks. However, a Modest nature can be used for greater power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is best used on teams looking for an offensive Stealth Rock user that can directly threaten Defoggers, due to its powerful Ice-type STAB moves, while also being able to punch significant holes in the opposing team. Because of its offensive presence, Aurorus can force many switches, which it should use to set Stealth Rock. Try to bring Aurorus in on a Pokemon it can threaten and wall. Such examples include Choice item users locked into an ineffective move, such as Meloetta, Exploud, and Delphox, or slower defensive Pokemon such as Golbat, and Aromatisse. Aurorus can also easily sponge hits from some offensively inclined Pokemon without a super effective move, such as Fletchinder. When possible, avoid switching Aurorus in on direct damage, as it is extremely vulnerable to being worn down by entry hazards and Life Orb recoil. After Stealth Rock has been used, the best move to spam is Hyper Voice, since it is immensely powerful and there are very few Pokemon that resist Ice and have reliable recovery. If your opponent has a defensive Steel-type such as Bronzong or Escavalier, it is very likely they will send it out to take a Hyper Voice, so predict accordingly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Aurorus loses one-fourth of its health whenever it switches into Stealth Rock, so entry hazard removers are essential. Hitmonlee can provide Rapid Spin support and threaten the Steel-types that Aurorus struggles with, while Skuntank can use Defog to remove hazards and Pursuit to weaken checks such as Bronzong, Uxie, and Musharna. In general, Pursuit users can help whittle down Aurorus's checks, most notably Bronzong. Houndoom can both threaten and Pursuit-trap on Escavalier, making it a good partner. Aurorus also works well with teammates that similarly dislike Steel-types, as it can weaken Steel-types for them. Examples include Choice Scarf Meloetta and Mega Glalie. Pivots such as Eelektross are able to get Aurorus in safely.</p>"

      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Polish allows Aurorus to outspeed every relevant Pokemon in the metagame after a boost. Hyper Voice is Aurorus's best Ice-type STAB move due to being boosted by Refrigerate. Freeze-Dry is super effective against Water-types like Alomomola, and Earth Power rounds out Aurorus's coverage by hitting Steel- and Fire-types such as Emboar and Houndoom. Dark Pulse and Hidden Power Fire are its strongest options against Bronzong and Escavalier, respectively, with Dark Pulse also being able to deal sizable damage to Jellicent. However, both of these moves cannot KO Bronzong or Escavalier without significant prior damage, so Earth Power is recommended due to its overall consistency.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allows Aurorus to outspeed Choice Scarf Medicham after a Rock Polish boost. Against defensive and slower teams, where Rock Polish is not as necessary, a Timid nature also ensures it can outspeed Pokemon such as Modest Exploud and Adamant Scrafty, allowing Aurorus to consistently check or force out these threats. 252 Special Attack EVs along with a Life Orb makes Aurorus hit as hard as possible, maximizing its chances of cleaning the opposing team.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This is set is designed to make Aurorus sweep late-game; therefore, do not try to set up until its counters are weakened to the point where Aurorus can OHKO them, as Aurorus's many weaknesses often mean it cannot survive a hit back. Early-game, try and weaken counters such as Bronzong and Escavalier, and maintain entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field. Try to set up on Pokemon that either cannot significantly damage Aurorus or get forced out by it, such as Fletchinder, Golbat, Aromatisse, Meloetta locked into Hyper Voice, and Exploud locked into Boomburst. Keep in mind that Aurorus has above-average bulk, so it can survive most neutral hits in order to set up. Also, keep in mind that Aurorus needs slight prior damage to OHKO Pokemon such as Scrafty and Rhyperior, among others. Against more defensive teams, Aurorus can be directly threatening without the use of Rock Polish, as it can outspeed most defensive Pokemon naturally and hit them hard.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because Aurorus is weak to Stealth Rock, entry hazard removers can maximize Aurorus's chances of setting up a Rock Polish. Hitmonlee can use Rapid Spin while also threatening the Steel-types that check Aurorus. Pursuit trappers can help weaken Aurorus's counters such as Bronzong, Uxie and Mesprit. Skuntank is a good user of Pursuit due to its access to Defog, while Houndoom can threaten Escavalier and use Pursuit on it as it switches out. A slow pivot, such as Eelektross, helps to get Aurorus into the field safely. Other attackers that can deal with Steel-types can help wear them down, such as Meloetta and Exploud.</p>"

It also has excellent physical bulk, allowing it to check many physical attackers in the tier, as well as being one of the best counters to Swords Dance Virizion, a premier threat. Gourgeist-XL is also able to spinblock, which is important for many defensive teams; this is further helped by Gourgeist-XL's decent matchup against the most common spinner Blastoise and its access to reliable recovery, allowing Gourgeist-XL to separate itself from other Ghost-types. However, Gourgeist-XL has weaknesses to common types such as Fire, Dark, and Flying and has mediocre special bulk, leaving it easily beaten by common special wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Meloetta and Life Orb Venusaur.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Blast can be used with a Relaxed nature to hit Grass- and Steel-types, notably 2HKOing Escavalier, but it is very weak against all other Pokemon, and Gourgeist-XL can usually take on Steel-types by using Will-O-Wisp or Leech Seed. Shadow Sneak can be used to OHKO Hoopa before it can KO Gourgeist-XL, which is very useful for stall teams that struggle against it. However, Shadow Sneak hits nothing else that is notable, making it a very niche move on Gourgeist-XL.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Houndoom and Delphox are immune to Will-O-Wisp and resist Seed Bomb, preventing Gourgeist-XL from spreading status and using its STAB moves. While they can be worn down by Leech Seed and Delphox and Houndoom can be damaged heavily by Rock Slide on the switch, they still threaten Gourgeist-XL out due to their STAB moves KOing it.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Absol and Sneasel heavily threaten Gourgeist-XL with their strong STAB moves and can Pursuit trap it if it tries to switch out. Houndoom is even better of a check, being immune to Will-O-Wisp while also not getting affected by Foul Play if it tries to set up with Nasty Plot. However, physical Dark-types such as Absol and Sneasel have to watch out for Colbur Berry variants that can take a Knock Off easily and burn them, crippling them for the rest of the match.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burn and poison constantly wear down Gourgeist-XL, making it harder for it to check strong physical attackers while also forcing it to use Synthesis much more in a match.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Fletchinder and Golbat can threaten Gourgeist-XL with their strong STAB attacks while also having ways to get around Will-O-Wisp in Fletchinder's immunity and Golbat's Taunt. Braviary can even use the combination of Substitute and Bulk Up to set up on Gourgeist-XL while also not having to worry about Will-O-Wisp, Leech Seed, or Foul Play, with the Defense boosts preventing its Substitute from being broken. While Rock Slide variants of Gourgeist-XL can threaten Fletchinder with a KO, other variants can't do much to it outside of Leech Seed and Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: While a rarity in RU outside of the common Sneasel, Ice-types such as Sneasel and Jynx can still prove to be massive threats to Gourgeist-XL with their STAB moves hitting It super effectively and only fearing Rock Slide or Will-O-Wisp in Sneasel's case. Sneasel even has Pursuit to trap and do deal massive damage to non-Colbur Berry variants if Gourgeist-XL tries to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Strong special attackers such as Choice Specs Meloetta and Life Orb Flygon can damage Gourgeist-XL heavily by hitting it on its mediocre Special Defense stat and easily 2HKOing or OHKOing it. Specially attacking setup sweepers, such as Substitute + Calm Mind Meloetta and Calm Mind Virizion, can also set up on Gourgeist-XL and deal massive damage afterwards.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Opposing Ghost-types such as Hoopa, Rotom, and Mega Banette can all threaten Gourgeist-XL with their STAB moves and usually pick up the KO. However, they have a hard time getting in, since they all dislike Foul Play or status effects. Hoopa more than others has to be wary of the uncommon Shadow Sneak as well, which can OHKO it.</p>",

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp is used to cripple physical attackers while also dealing residual damage to help wear down the opposing team. Synthesis provides Gourgeist-XL with reliable recovery, which helps keep it healthy. Foul Play allows Gourgeist-XL to hit physical setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Samurott and Swords Dance + RestTalk Escavalier, and it is Gourgeist-XL's best way of hitting Swords Dance Virizion, naturally hitting it for boosted damage due to Justified. Leech Seed allows Gourgeist-XL to gain some passive recovery while also putting pressure on switch-ins. Seed Bomb is a usable option over Leech Seed to deal with Ground- and Rock-types such as Rhyperior and Diancie much more quickly while also threatening Blastoise, enhancing Gourgeist-XL's spinblocking capabilities. Rock Slide is another option for the last moveslot to hit Fire-, Flying-, and Ice-types such as Houndoom, Sigilyph, and Sneasel, all of which are common switch-ins to Gourgeist-XL, while also OHKOing Fletchinder.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment with an Impish nature is used to make Gourgeist-XL as physically bulky as possible, allowing it to check physical attackers such as Medicham. Leftovers gives Gourgeist-XL extra passive recovery so it doesn't have to use Synthesis as often, and it works well in conjunction with Leech Seed to keep Gourgeist-XL more healthy. Colbur Berry is a good alternative option to help Gourgeist-XL more reliably check Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee by taking their Dark-type coverage much better; it also allows Gourgeist-XL to survive Sneasel's and Absol's Knock Off and cripple them with Will-O-Wisp in an emergency situation.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gourgeist-XL should be switched in on the Pokemon it checks, such as Fighting- and Ground-types. Gourgeist-XL must be wary of switching into Water-types, however, as even with its resistance to the typing, it can be crippled with a Scald burn or be taken out by offensive Water-types using Ice Beam. Once switched in safely, Gourgeist-XL can proceed to spread burns and Leech Seeds against the opposing team, crippling physical attackers and wearing down its switch-ins. Make sure to keep Gourgeist-XL healthy throughout the game with Synthesis and Leech Seed, as it needs to be able to take on strong physical attackers such as Life Orb Medicham. Gourgeist-XL can also spinblock thanks to its Ghost typing, so it can take on common spinners such as Hitmontop and Blastoise and keep entry hazards up on the field. However, Hitmontop and Blastoise both have ways of crippling Gourgeist-XL with Toxic and potential Scald burns, so do not switch in on them repeatedly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gourgeist-XL usually finds itself on more defensively oriented teams, so it should be used with defensive partners in mind. Specially defensive Pokemon that can take the special hits that Gourgeist-XL cannot, such as Registeel and Mega Audino, are great partners, as they also appreciate Gourgeist-XL taking on most physical attackers. Dark-type switch-ins such as Aromatisse and Diancie make for great partners, as Gourgeist-XL is weak to Dark-type moves, notably Knock Off and Pursuit, which Dark-types can take advantage of unless Gourgeist-XL is running Colbur Berry. Diancie synergizes very well with Gourgeist-XL, taking on the Dark-, Flying-, and Fire-types that Gourgeist-XL is weak to, while Gourgeist-XL takes on Ground- and Water-types for Diancie. Diancie also provides cleric support with Heal Bell so that Gourgeist-XL doesn't have to worry about Toxic as often. Alomomola takes on Fire-types for Gourgeist-XL while also taking on some special attackers like Exploud with a more specially defensive spread, and it appreciates Gourgeist-XL countering Swords Dance Virizion and checking Fighting-type wallbreakers.</p>"

  "Diancie": {
    "overview": "<p>Diancie is one of the most influential Pokemon in the RU tier, as it possesses phenomenal defensive capabilities and stellar offenses thanks to its good movepool and Fairy typing. With fantastic defensive stats and a decent support movepool, Diancie is able to provide plenty of team support throughout a match, including cleric support with Heal Bell, while holding back dangerous Fire-, Flying-, and Dark-types thanks to its typing. Solid high Base Power STAB moves in Moonblast and Diamond Storm alongside respectable attacking stats also means that Diancie can remove some opposing Pokemon, such as Fletchinder and Sigilyph, quickly before they cause too much trouble. However, providing defensive support isn't the only thing Diancie can do. Diancie even has good coverage moves, such as Earth Power, Psychic, and Hidden Power Fire, allowing it to put good use to a Trick Room sweeper set. Its access to Calm Mind, solid defensive typing, and high defenses also mean it can use a mono-attacking set to slowly wear down and sweep opposing teams. Diancie's fantastic defensive stats are undermined slightly by its low base HP, and a low base Speed stat means Diancie will really only be able to sweep offensively with Trick Room. Diancie's movepool gives it most of the things it wants, but it lacks a strong physical Fairy-type move and special Rock-type move, meaning it usually has to to resort to going mixed for many of its sets. Most importantly, it also lacks a reliable recovery move, reducing its longevity as a defensive stalwart.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Diancie's movepool is somewhat sparse, but there are still some decent alternatives to consider. Calm Mind can be used more offensively with three attacks or Substitute, Calm Mind, and two attacks. Diancie can choose to run Earth Power on its Specially Defensive set in order to hit the common Magneton, but this generally isn't worth it, as it could be only used to hit Magneton on the switch, and does not do damage to anything else in the tier. Diancie can run a more support-oriented variation of its Trick Room set with Stealth Rock and Explosion alongside Trick Room and Moonblast. Sunny Day can be used on the defensive set, but it's strapped for moveslots as it is despite Diancie's good typing for sun-based teams. Finally, Diancie has access to Rock Polish to fix its Speed. However, it's weaker than the Trick Room set, and Diancie would have to give up a lot of its bulk to make the set work, often making it an inferior way to fix Diancie's Speed compared to Trick Room.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Aside from Earth Power on the Trick Room set, Steel-types fear very little from Diancie. Bronzong is the most notable, as it doesn't even care for Earth Power thanks to Levitate. Escavalier and Magneton are other notable powerful Steel-types that can generally beat Diancie.</p> <p><strong>Water- and Grass-types</strong>: Most Water- and Grass-types aren't weak to any of Diancie's attacks and can hit it hard in return with super effective STAB moves. Slowking, Venusaur, and Samurott can pretty easily overpower Diancie, but they can't waste time with the mono attacker set. Qwilfish and Seismitoad are more passive Water-types that can set up entry hazards, but generally lose to the mono attacker set. Qwilfish can use Taunt to slow it down, though.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type coverage moves</strong>: With twin 150 base defenses and virtually all sets having some sort of defensive investment, 2x super effective moves usually aren't enough to 2HKO Diancie without a boost. However, Pokemon Diancie commonly switches into that are capable of using Steel-type moves can surprise it with an OHKO or very heavy damage. Iron Tail Absol is the most notable example, but Houndoom and Druddigon are also quite capable of catching Diancie by surprise with Iron Tail.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Diancie's typing and stats are put to good use with this set. Stealth Rock lets Diancie provide a team with entry hazards support. Moonblast is Diancie's main STAB option, allowing it to challenge and beat the likes of Flygon and Gurdurr. Diamond Storm is a good secondary STAB move that allows Diancie to pressure Delphox, Sigilyph, and Fletchinder. If Diancie has a teammate that can cover Stealth Rock, there are a few other options to consider. Heal Bell is useful as Diancie makes a decent cleric due to its ability to find free turns with its bulk; on the other hand, Toxic may be used so that Diancie can beat Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary and cripple Bulky Water-types that may switch in on it. Finally, Protect can be used to stall for Leftovers recovery and to scout for dangerous coverage moves the opponent might be trying to use after lulling Diancie into a false sense of security.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Diancie's EV spread focuses on its special bulk, as its typing is more conducive to walling special attackers. 36 Special Attack EVs allows it to break Bulk Up Braviary's Substitute with Moonblast, which it can then hit it with Toxic to defeat it. Leftovers is mandatory on this set, as Diancie lacks recovery of any other kind. A more physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 164 Def / 92 SpD with a Sassy nature can be used for more reliability against Absol, Gurdurr, and Choice Band Flygon, but keep in mind that Absol commonly carries Iron Tail and Gurdurr has Fighting-type STAB moves to still wear down Diancie quicker than it would like. A Sassy nature is used because Diancie uses both of its attacking stats and doesn't really miss out on much from reducing its Speed a little. If your team needs something to outspeed Druddigon, Calm can be used, but stick to Sassy otherwise.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Diancie is a strong defensive Pokemon, but one must be careful to not put too much pressure on it, as it lacks a reliable recovery move. Diancie should aim to set up Stealth Rock or provide Heal Bell support whenever it switches into the likes of Houndoom, Fletchinder, and Exploud. If Stealth Rock is already up and Heal Bell isn't needed, Diancie should just use the appropriate STAB move. Diancie's options over Stealth Rock should be used in specific situations, such as catching Alomomola and Slowking with Toxic or using Protect against Absol to see if it's carrying Iron Tail. As Diancie's only recovery is through Leftovers, it should not be exposed to Knock Off or super effective coverage moves early-game if it can be helped. Lastly, Diancie's STAB moves have notable secondary effects, especially Diamond Storm with its 50% chance to boost Diancie's Defense. While these shouldn't be relied upon, they can bail out Diancie in tight situations at times.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Diancie has a very difficult time fending off Steel-, Water-, and Grass-type Pokemon, so its teammates should ideally be able to handle most of these. Alomomola is an ideal partner, as it not only provides Wish support for Diancie but also can check most Steel-types and hit most opposing Water-types with Toxic without fear thanks to Diancie's Heal Bell support. Venusaur and Virizion can handle most Water-types and can threaten most Steel-types either with a coverage move or with a secondary STAB option. Venusaur is most notable, as it has STAB Sludge Bomb for opposing Grass-types. Diancie's Heal Bell also makes it much easier for these Grass-types to switch into Scald. The rest of Diancie's preferred teammates generally depend on the type of team this set is used on. When on a stall team, Diancie likes Toxic Spikes support from the likes of Qwilfish, Weezing, and Cofagrigus, while Diancie's Heal Bell can keep status ailments from crippling them. Roselia is very notable due to its strong matchup against most Grass- and Water-types and its ability to run both Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Bulky offensive Pokemon, such as Seismitoad, the previously mentioned Venusaur, and Escavalier, work very well on balance and bulky offense teams because they have good defensive synergy with Diancie and appreciate its Heal Bell support in return. Bronzong and Jellicent are notable defensive partners for Diancie. Bronzong can run Stealth Rock to free up a moveslot for Diancie, check dangerous physical threats, and even provide a secondary check to Exploud, and Jellicent can keep Blastoise and Hitmontop from spinning away Stealth Rock with its typing and access to Taunt.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set utilizes Trick Room to take advantage of Diancie's good coverage and low Speed to sweep. Trick Room is what makes a sweep possible, as it turns Diancie's low base 50 Speed into an asset by flipping turn order in order to turn the tables on fast offensive Pokemon. Moonblast is the primary move, as it has good Base Power, is backed by STAB, and has no drawbacks. Earth Power is necessary to hit Mega Camerupt and Qwilfish for heavy damage. Psychic is preferred in the last slot to deal serious damage to Venusaur, Weezing, and Fletchinder. Diamond Storm is another option, as it gives Diancie a physical attack to hit Meloetta a bit harder and ensure that Fletchinder is OHKOed. Explosion can be useful if neither Psychic nor Diamond Storm is needed, as it can let Diancie go out with a bang and possibly get a teammate in for free to sweep with Trick Room. Hidden Power Fire can be a neat option to hit Escavalier and Bronzong harder than any other move on the set, but it makes Diancie quite susceptible to Fletchinder.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread maximizes Diancie's overall bulk and damage output. If Diancie uses Diamond Storm or Explosion over Psychic, make sure the leftover EVs are shifted from Defense to Attack. Life Orb is the best item with this set to crank up Diancie's damage output.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As Diancie wields Life Orb and lacks full defensive investment, one needs to be much more selective about what to switch it into. Fletchinder and Houndoom are ideal targets that Diancie reliably checks and can use to set up Trick Room. Diancie is just below the base 30 Speed threshold at 94 Speed with this spread, but this means that Mega Camerupt and Escavalier not investing in Speed can still outspeed Diancie under Trick Room. While these are very rare occurences, it would be a shame to lose Diancie to these, so guard against this by hitting them with Earth Power upon switch in to try and wear them down. Remember that Trick Room's negative priority will make it go even after Roar and Whirlwind, so make sure to use the appropriate offensive move against users of these moves so that they can be worn down. This set's coverage can allow Diancie to sweep or break down defensive cores depending on the opposing team. Save it for late-game if possible if Diancie can sweep, but don't be afraid to use that coverage earlier if it can break down defensive cores more reliably. When using Explosion, it's best used after Diancie has set up Trick Room and is too low on HP to finish a sweep on its own so that a teammate can come in for free to finish the job.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Emboar and Abomasnow are perhaps the most notable teammates for Diancie. Both benefit from Trick Room, and Emboar is able to easily push past bothersome Steel-type Pokemon, while Abomasnow shares similar checks and counters to Diancie, thus allowing both to overwhelm them. Trick Room setters, such as Mesprit, Slowking, and Bronzong, are noteworthy to lessen the pressure on Diancie to keep Trick Room up. Mesprit provides added support with Stealth Rock and Healing Wish, Slowking is able to check Steelix while running Fire-type coverage for Escavalier, and Bronzong can utilize Stealth Rock and get Diancie in safely with Explosion. This set can still be used as a standalone sweeper, so non-Trick Room teammates are perfectly viable options. Samurott, Venusaur, Hitmonlee, and Gallade are more than capable of pressuring most defensive cores for Diancie. No matter what this set runs, Bronzong is a major annoyance, so make sure there's at least a couple of teammates that can pressure it or take it out. Emboar and Gallade are great options that have already been mentioned. Pursuit support from Absol, Spiritomb, Escavalier, and Houndoom is another option to quickly wear down Bronzong for Diancie.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock gives Diancie some utility, allowing it to support its team by racking up chip damage on the opposition. Moonblast is Diancie's strongest special STAB attack, which, combined with full investment, is capable of OHKOing many Dark-, Dragon-, and Fighting-types such as Spiritomb, Flygon, and Hitmonlee while also dealing solid damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Diamond Storm allows Diancie to check Flying-types such as Fletchinder and Togetic; combined with Moonblast, it gives Diancie perfect super effective coverage against every entry hazard remover in the tier except Blastoise. Earth Power hits the Fire-, Poison-, and Steel-types that resist Moonblast super effectively. Psychic can also be used in the last slot to deal serious damage to Poison-types such as Venusaur and Weezing that are not hit super effectively by Earth Power.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread and a Quiet nature maximize Diancie's offensive prowess and bulk. Shuca Berry allows Diancie to set up Stealth Rock on or potentially eliminate Ground-types such as Flygon and Rhyperior that would normally force it out. It additionally makes Diancie a solid answer to Mega Camerupt, especially if it's packing Earth Power. An alternate spread of 252 HP / 92 Atk / 164 SpA can be used to ensure that Diamond Storm OHKOes offensive Sigilyph, guaranteeing that it will not be able to potentially Roost stall or set up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set best fits on bulky offensive teams that require Diancie's unique set of resistances and utility without killing momentum. Because this set lacks the bulk of other sets and has no form of recovery, try to avoid switching Diancie into even neutral attacks, as it will otherwise quickly be worn down. Diancie at least 2HKOes every entry hazard remover in the tier except Blastoise and forces many switches due to its numerous resistances, so it is capable of setting Stealth Rock several times throughout a match. Be wary of Toxic and Will-O-Wisp users such as Alomomola and Jellicent, as these forms of status will wear down Diancie very quickly and prevent it from checking the threats it should. Make sure to scout for super effective coverage on Pokemon that could potentially have it; Iron Head Scrafty and Registeel and Iron Tail Absol are common examples. Make sure to preserve Diancie when it's needed as an emergency check for opposing Ground-types or Pokemon such as Aerodactyl that commonly carry Ground-type coverage, including avoiding switching it into Knock Off.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Any setup sweeper, especially fast or Speed-boosting ones such as Fletchinder and Rock Polish Rhyperior, appreciates the chip damage that Stealth Rock provides, which may allow it to break through its typical checks and counters. Weezing makes for a good partner, as it's capable of handling threatening Grass- and Ground-types such as Venusaur and Rhyperior and crippling them with a burn. Venusaur itself works as well, because it handles Water- and Grass-types like Blastoise (the one entryhazard remover that Diancie cannot 2HKO after Stealth Rock damage) and Rotom-C while appreciating Diancie's ability to deal with the Flying- and Fire-types, such as Golbat and Houndoom, that threaten it. Because Diancie can lure in and weaken or eliminate Steel- and Poison-types such as Steelix and Qwilfish that expect a defensive set lacking Earth Power, Choice Band Granbull can take advantage of these shared checks being removed and appreciates the chip damage from Stealth Rock. Choice Scarf Medicham and Fighting-types in general benefit from Diancie's ability to handle Spiritomb, threatening priority users such as Absol and Fletchinder, and other Flying-types while shoring up its incredibly low Speed and breaking through Steel-types like Registeel, which can quite comfortably absorb Earth Power and wear down Diancie with Seismic Toss and Toxic. Pokemon that can lure in bulky Water-types and afflict them with crippling status, such as defensive Emboar, Protect + Toxic Bronzong, and Fletchinder, are able to wear down these threats for Diancie's benefit. Flying-types such as Fletchinder and Sigilyph make for good partners due to their ability to deal with Grass-types like Venusaur and Virizion and to switch into Ground-type attacks aimed at Diancie. Diancie's ability to lure in and OHKO Flygon can clear the way for other threats such as Swords Dance Drapion and Expert Belt Emboar.</p>"

  "Hoopa": {
    "overview": "<p>Hoopa is a potent wallbreaker with a good offensive Psychic / Ghost typing and an enormous movepool. Possessing the highest Special Attack stat in RU, Hoopa is a fearsome Pokemon, with coverage moves such as Hyperspace Hole, Shadow Ball, and Focus Blast. Hoopa's Special Defense paired with its Ghost typing allows it to be an effective spinblocker against the primary Rapid Spin user in the tier, Blastoise. Unfortunately, Hoopa is particularly lacking in Speed and Defense and therefore should be switched in very carefully against strong physical attackers. Its typing may be useful offensively, but it makes it 4x weak to Dark- and Ghost-type moves. Pursuit trappers are a challenge for Hoopa, as they have a high chance to OHKO it even if it does not switch out. Furthermore, Hoopa should be wary of Pokemon like Meloetta, as they are known to carry Shadow Ball as coverage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Nasty Plot set can be viable, but Hoopa rarely sees an opportunity to set up due to its typing and low Defense. An offensive Trick Room set with Focus Blast, Hyperspace Hole, and Shadow Ball is an option; however, Hoopa has an awkward Speed tier and therefore has a hard time being effective with Trick Room. Choice Specs can be used for greater damage, although Hoopa generally likes using its coverage freely and therefore prefers an all-out attacker set. Fire Punch can be used over Knock Off, but it only has one target in Escavalier. The last slot can be filled with a multitude of moves over Knock Off, such as Taunt, Destiny Bond, Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Energy Ball, depending on your team's weaknesses. Finally, a Calm Mind set can be used; however, it is outclassed by Calm Mind Meloetta, and a Nasty Plot set is generally more effective.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pursuit Trappers and Sucker Punch Users</strong>: Pursuit trappers are the main enemy of Hoopa. Pokemon like Sneasel, Spiritomb, and Drapion can use Pursuit and OHKO Hoopa even if it doesn't switch out. Aerodactyl is a particularly threatening Pursuit trapper, as it can even outspeed Choice Scarf Hoopa. Even a Sucker Punch that isn't STAB-boosted almost always OHKOes Hoopa due to its 4x weakness to it, so it should be wary of Sucker Punch users, such as Emboar, Hitmonlee, and Druddigon.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Due to Hoopa's lackluster Defense, it should switch out against strong physical attackers such as Braviary, Choice Scarf Emboar, and Aerodactyl.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralysis severely cripples Hoopa, as it heavily relies on its Speed to maximize its effectiveness. Therefore, Hoopa should not stay in on Pokemon that carry Thunder Wave unless it is to KO them.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Hoopa has a 4x weakness to Dark, so Dark-type STAB moves easily KO it. Be wary of the fact that many of these Pokemon carry Pursuit and Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types should be feared because of Hoopa's 4x weakness to them. While RU lacks many Ghost-types, Pokemon like Rotom and Mega Banette still exist and can threaten Hoopa. Furthermore, many Pokemon, such as Meloetta, run Ghost-type coverage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shadow Ball targets opposing Ghost-and Psychic-types. Hyperspace Hole allows Hoopa to bypass Protect, which helps against clerics such as Alomomola and Aromatisse; it targets Fighting- and Poison-types super effectively as well. However, Psyshock can be used over Hyperspace Hole because it hits specially defensive Pokemon, such as Diancie, for more damage. Focus Blast allows Hoopa to hit several Pokemon super effectively, including Dark-, Ice-, Rock-, Normal-, and Steel-types; it is particularly important for hitting Dark-types, which resist Hoopa's Psychic- and Ghost-type STAB moves and can Pursuit trap Hoopa. Knock Off is used to cripple opposing Pokemon by getting rid of their items and particularly is needed for hitting Meloetta hard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Special Attack and Speed are maximized because Hoopa is an offensively oriented Pokemon and does not really require any bulk to optimally function. A Life Orb is used to maximize Hoopa's damage output. A Timid nature can be used to outspeed Pokemon like Modest Venusaur and Modest Magneton, but a Modest nature is preferred for the increase in power and still lets Hoopa outspeed threats like Modest Exploud and Jolly Scrafty. Modest and Timid are generally used over Mild and Hasty, as Knock Off still 2HKOes Colbur Berry-lacking variants of Meloetta without the boost, and the extra Defense can be useful to take less damage from physical attacks. However, they can be used to make sure Knock Off's power is not decreased and to increase the chance of 2HKOing Assault Vest Escavalier with the combination of Knock Off and Shadow Ball.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hoopa is primarily used as a wallbreaker and works well against balance, semi-stall, and stall builds. Thanks to its high Special Defense, Hoopa can usually be switched into Pokemon like Blastoise and Alomomola if they lack Knock Off. It is important to scout for Knock Off on Alomomola, as this can be very threatening to Hoopa, and it is one of the key Pokemon that you can take advantage of with Hyperspace Hole. Try not to reveal Hyperspace Hole until the opposing Wish user is pressured to use Protect, believing that it is safe to stay in to receive the Wish. Hoopa works well with hazard-stacking teams as a spinblocker and particularly appreciates Spikes and Toxic Spikes support. Furthermore, Hoopa should be not be sent into battle until the opposing Pursuit trapper has fainted. Because of its poor Defense, Hoopa should avoid staying in on strong physical attackers. Finally, try to avoid paralysis, as it heavily cripples Hoopa.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can help beat Pursuit trappers and Dark-types are extremely helpful partners. Thus, Fighting-types such as Virizion, Hitmonlee, and Gurdurr make for good teammates. Colbur Berry Meloetta can lure in and KO Pursuit trappers while also performing well against faster teams. Hoopa appreciates Spikes support to weaken opposing Pokemon and secure KOs. Pursuit trappers can be helpful in getting rid of Meloetta, which can survive Hoopa's STAB moves easily. Pokemon that appreciate Hoopa's wallbreaking potential and that can clean late-game such as Sneasel, Jolteon, and Fletchinder are extremely helpful. Partners that help in checking common fast physical attackers are appreciated due to Hoopa's lackluster Defense. Finally, Hoopa appreciates Pokemon with Volt Switch and U-turn, as it can switch in freely without taking damage; hence, Flygon, Jolteon, and Lanturn are good teammates.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shadow Ball is a strong STAB move that hits Ghost- and Psychic-types super effectively. Psyshock primarily targets Fighting- and Poison-types and is preferred over Psychic because it secures the OHKO on Virizion. However, Psychic can hit physically defensive Pokemon for much more damage and has a higher Base Power than Psyshock. Focus Blast is used to hit Ice-, Normal-, Rock-, Steel-, and more importantly Dark-types, which resist Hoopa's STAB moves and often can Pursuit trap Hoopa. Trick is used to cripple bulky Pokemon such as Alomomola and Registeel that Choice Scarf Hoopa cannot easily deal with.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf allows Hoopa to act as a revenge killer, though it can still function as a decent wallbreaker due to its very high Special Attack. Choice Scarf Hoopa's Speed tier allows it to outspeed most Pokemon besides Jolteon, Aerodactyl, Accelgor, and other Choice Scarf users with a higher Speed tier. Special Attack is maximized because this is an offensively oriented set, and maximum Speed is needed to outspeed several threats, such as +1 Scrafty. A Timid nature is essential to outspeed threats like Sneasel.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Hoopa should be primarily used as a revenge killer but can be used as wallbreaker due to its high Special Attack. Try to preserve Hoopa until opposing Pursuit trappers have fainted, as they pose a high threat to it. Only Trick Hoopa's Choice Scarf away when your team does not require speed control anymore or when you need to cripple a wall that is hard to break. Try not to switch in on Pokemon that can inflict paralysis, as it will cripple Choice Scarf Hoopa. Do not bring Hoopa in on super effective moves or physical attacks due to its lack of physical bulk. Be wary of Aerodactyl, which naturally outspeeds Choice Scarf Hoopa and can carry Pursuit.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Hoopa appreciates Pokemon that can get rid of Dark-types so that it can safely lock itself into a STAB move. For this reason, Fighting-types such as Scrafty, Gurdurr, and Virizion or Fairy-types such as Diancie, Granbull, and Togetic are helpful partners. Pursuit users work with Hoopa because they can get rid of its primary check, Meloetta. Hoopa works well with hazard-stacking Pokemon, as they appreciate a spinblocker. Choice Scarf Hoopa cannot wallbreak as easily as the all-out attacker variant and appreciates support from wallbreakers such as Venusaur and Exploud, which allow it to clean up late-game. Pokemon that can take on physical attackers that threaten Hoopa are also helpful. Hoopa also appreciates VoltTurn Pokemon because it wants to be able to switch in freely. Run Pokemon that can check Aerodactyl, such as Bronzong and Seismitoad, as it is faster than Choice Scarf Hoopa and can Pursuit trap it.</p>"
