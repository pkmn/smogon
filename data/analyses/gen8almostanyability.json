Toxic Spikes exerts tremendous pressure on opposing teams, quickly wearing down grounded offensive attackers and putting extra strain on walls. Stealth Rock is an option, but given the much more limited distribution of Toxic Spikes, it is generally easier to have a teammate supply it. Taunt and Super Fang further pressure opposing defensive cores, reliably reducing their health even with no Attack investment and denying recovery and Defog from foes like Corviknight and Mandibuzz. Poison Fang is an option in either of the last two slots to hit Levitate Tapu Koko and poison foes immune to Toxic Spikes, but the pressure exerted by Taunt + Super Fang is generally preferred. Black Sludge is the preferred item to increase Nidoqueen's longevity, but Rocky Helmet can be used to further accumulate chip damage on opponents and is especially punishing against opposing U-turn users. 36 Speed EVs allow Nidoqueen to outpace Mandibuzz so that it can deny its Defog and Roost.</p> <p>Nidoqueen is an excellent addition to balance teams looking to win the entry hazard war and shore up weaknesses to Terrakion and Tapu Koko.

Arcanine is often forced out by fast Ground-types that can threaten an immediate KO, such as Garchomp and Zygarde-10%. Pokemon like Dauntless Shield Mew that can reliably switch into these threats make strong defensive partners. Arcanine also struggles with bulky walls that are not weak to its coverage moves, such as Mew and Dauntless Shield Hippowdon, so teammates that can poison or overload these threats like Terrakion are appreciated. Entry hazard setters such as Swampert and Ferrothorn make it easier for Arcanine to break past its checks.</p> "

Substitute takes advantage of the switches that Alolan Marowak tends to force, especially with foes trying to waste Trick Room turns by switching into predicted attacks. Alolan Marowak can also set up a Substitute on defensive Pokemon like Blissey, Mew, and Kommo-o, which makes it harder to revenge kill even if Trick Room is no longer active.

Poltergeist hits most Pokemon neutrally and deals significant damage to prominent threats like Mew, Garchomp, and Tapu Fini and hits Primordial Sea Zapdos and Flash Fire Ferrothorn. Flare Blitz covers Ghost-resistant and -immune foes like Zarude, Mandibuzz, and Blissey and breaks through physically defensive Steel-types like Intimidate Corviknight and Dauntless Shield Skarmory. Low Kick cleanly OHKOes Hydreigon and Tyranitar, but Shadow Bone grants Alolan Marowak an accurate Ghost-type attack, especially notable since failing to hit a Poltergeist under valuable Trick Room turns can be very game-changing. Earthquake is its strongest attack for Heatran and hits Volcanion, Toxapex, and Nihilego without risking a Poltergeist miss, though Swords Dance can be used to boost Alolan Marowak's damage output enough to break through Dauntless Shield Hippowdon. Adaptability is the preferred ability to boost Alolan Marowak's damage output, especially as it tends to only use its STAB moves, but Magic Guard is a fine alternative that gives it more longevity by ignoring entry hazards and Flare Blitz recoil.</p> <p>Alolan Marowak is exclusively found on Trick Room teams.

Other offensive partners like Stakataka and Conkeldurr also take advantage of Trick Room, maintaining offensive pressure against Dark- and Normal-types like Hydreigon, Zarude, and Blissey so that Alolan Marowak can use Poltergeist as often as possible.</p> "

Tough Claws enables Galarian Zapdos to 2HKO defensive staples like Dauntless Shield Mew and Intimidate Corviknight after minor chip damage using Brave Bird and Close Combat, respectively. In addition, it can chip its switch-ins with U-turn when a KO isn't an option. With Throat Chop, Galarian Zapdos is even able to 2HKO would-be counters like Doublade and Runerigus. Thunderous Kick is an alternative to Throat Chop with built-in wallbreaking power due to the Defense drops, and it also avoids the recoil and self-inflicted negative stat stage changes from Brave Bird and Close Combat. Stomping Tantrum is also an option to OHKO Tapu Koko and still provide coverage against Doublade. While Tough Claws is the preferred ability, Adaptability is an option on Thunderous Kick sets for a slightly higher damage boost.</p> <p>Galarian Zapdos thrives on offensive teams that can get it in reliably. Pixilate Tapu Koko is particularly noteworthy as a partner, as it can pivot Galarian Zapdos into Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Heatran, which are its most common entry points. Knock Off and entry hazard support from the likes of Ferrothorn and Heatran chip targets into range for Galarian Zapdos. It also appreciates fast pivots like Barraskewda and Choice Scarf Regenerator Mew, since they can bring it in to wallbreak while providing revenge killing services. Zapdos threatens to OHKO its Galarian counterpart, so teammates that can switch into it such as Power Construct Zygarde-10% and RegenVest Jirachi make good partners. Galarian Zapdos often wears itself down over the course of a battle, so Healing Wish support from Jirachi and Latias can serve as a surprise factor to bring it back to full power. In addition to this, bulky teammates like Mandibuzz and Tapu Fini offer entry hazard removal and are able to switch into revenge killers for Galarian Zapdos.</p> "

Magic Guard avoids every form of chip damage, including Stealth Rock, Rocky Helmet, Toxic, Life Orb, and Brave Bird recoil, allowing it to fire off powerful attacks with low risk. Brave Bird is a strong Flying-type STAB move that has good neutral coverage and 2HKOes common defensive staples such as Tapu Fini, Swampert, and Mandibuzz. Thunderous Kick works particularly well in conjunction with Brave Bird, hitting Steel-types such as Heatran and Corviknight that resist Brave Bird; it also drops the foe's Defense, easing predictions, and lets Galarian Zapdos KO physically defensive Tapu Fini after Stealth Rock by following up Thunderous Kick with Brave Bird. Thunderous Kick is also good at wearing down Dauntless Shield users that can't reliably threaten Galarian Zapdos such as Hippowdon and Skarmory lacking Brave Bird. U-turn allows Galarian Zapdos to keep momentum even against its checks such as Zapdos and Dauntless Shield Mew, while chipping them a bit. It also severely damages Mew after a Defense drop, forcing it to recover health. Taunt is a neat option to shut down Pokemon such as Corviknight and Mew that would try to heal or burn Galarian Zapdos with Will-O-Wisp, allowing it to wear them down through the course of a game; however, Taunt is risky because the opponent might use Brave Bird or Ice Beam instead. Close Combat is another option to pass through Flash Fire Corviknight easily, as well as OHKOing some threats such as Ferrothorn or physically defensive Heatran that Thunderous Kick doesn't KO. Jolly nature is usually preferred to at worst tie with max Speed Kantonian Zapdos, allowing Galarian Zapdos to Taunt it or kill it if it's weakened, but an Adamant nature can be used to maximize damage while still outspeeding defensive Zapdos.</p> <p>Galarian Zapdos fits best on balance teams that can bring it in several times in order to wallbreak efficiently. It likes partners like Barraskewda, Zygarde-10%, and Lucario that share checks with it in order to overwhelm them, especially in conjunction with Taunt. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Heatran is greatly appreciated in order to wear down Galarian Zapdos's checks. Pokemon that can take advantage of Zapdos and Mew such as Desolate Land Heatran, Inteleon, and Tapu Lele are also good teammates. Galarian Zapdos appreciates strong answers to Pokemon that threaten it out such as Tapu Lele, Talonflame, and Azelf, so partners like Jirachi and Flash Fire Corviknight are good teammates. It also requires a check to Zapdos, which is its most consistent check, so specially defensive Pokemon like Blissey or RegenVest Swampert are mandatory.

Nidoqueen pairs exceptionally well with Umbreon by covering for its weakness to Pokemon like Terrakion and Tapu Koko; it also pressures foes with Toxic Spikes. Because Umbreon is prone to being PP stalled out of Wish, it also relies on the aforementioned defensive Pokemon to help it wall and chip foes. Regenerator Doublade and Runerigus are niche but synergistic partners that check particularly strong Fighting-types like Tough Claws Galarian Zapdos and Adaptability Terrakion to relieve pressure on Umbreon.</p> "

Close Combat is Heracross's primary attack and capitalizes on the lack of Ghost-types in the AAA metagame. Megahorn is a powerful tool to beat Dauntless Shield Mew, a feat most other physical breakers fail to accomplish, and other Psychic-types like Slowbro and Latias. Knock Off removes items from switch-ins such as Dauntless Shield Hippowdon and Intimidate Corviknight, making them easier to chip with entry hazard damage. The last moveslot is very situational, as Heracross usually just fires off powerful Close Combats. Spikes is an option to punish switches to a reliable check such as Dauntless Shield Hippowdon; alternatively, Focus Punch 2HKOes Corviknight on the switch and forces a lose-lose situation: Roost risks being OHKOed by a second Focus Punch, while Brave Bird or switching out leaves Corviknight at low health and unable to check physical attackers. The given EV spread maximizes Heracross's power and Speed, and an Adamant nature allows better rolls to 2HKO the likes of Landorus-T.</p> <p>Heracross fits best on balance teams that can bring it on the field often to wallbreak.

Heracross requires Stealth Rock and Spikes support from partners like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Heatran to wear down its checks, especially since Knock Off removes their passive recovery. It also appreciates Toxic Spikes from Toxapex and Nidoqueen in order to wear down grounded Pokemon such as Dauntless Shield Hippowdon and Palossand. Heracross's defensive utility is almost nonexistent and strong answers to Psychic-, Fire-, and Flying-types are needed, such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Heatran.

Brave Bird is an alternative that hits foes such as Dhelmise, Tapu Bulu, and Galarian Zapdos harder. Skarmory usually finds ample opportunities to set multiple layers of Spikes throughout a game to wear down the opposing team. Roost helps Skarmory stay healthy to continuously check threats like Zarude and Garchomp. Whirlwind prevents setup sweepers from exploiting Skarmory's passivity and also synergizes well with Spikes. Iron Defense is an option on Body Press sets that still checks setup sweepers and also makes Skarmory less passive. Another option is Toxic, which helps wear down both passive foes like Mandibuzz and setup sweepers like Dhelmise. Leftovers gives Skarmory extra recovery, while Rocky Helmet is an option that punishes contact moves. Skarmory can run several different abilities. Dauntless Shield maximizes Skarmory's defensive capabilities and Body Press damage. Wandering Spirit, especially combined with Rocky Helmet, deters U-turn and Flip Turn from Regenerator pivots such as Swampert and Landorus-T, and also lets Skarmory serve as an emergency check to sweepers that heavily rely on their ability such Magic Guard Talonflame and Triage Tapu Lele. Flash Fire negates one of its weakness and allows it to surprise dangerous Fire-type such as Volcarona and Desolate Land Heatran with Brave Bird and Body Press, respectively. It also allows Skarmory to check the plethora of physical Fire-types like Talonflame and Cinderace that can be hard to account for otherwise.</p> <p>Skarmory's ability to set Spikes make it a better fit on stall teams compared to Corviknight, in particular entry hazard stack teams. Powerful offensive threats like Tapu Lele and Terrakion appreciate Spikes to nab more KOs. Offensive threats with a pivot move like Tapu Koko and Barraskewda can also rack up Spikes damage while still keeping offensive momentum by forcing additional switches. Heatran can set entry hazards alongside Skarmory, threaten to eliminate entry hazard removers with Magma Storm and Taunt. In return, Skarmory can cover for Heatran's weakness to Ground, and Dauntless Shield variants can also handle dangerous Fighting-types like Terrakion. Many Ground-type Pokemon also make for good partners, as they can take on Electric attacks and set Stealth Rock. Swampert and Garchomp are notable partners thanks to their resistance to Fire. Special walls are needed, as Skarmory invites many special attackers in when it set Spikes. Blissey forms the famous SkarmBliss core, taking on dangerous special threats like Zapdos and Sheer Force Tapu Lele while regaining momentum with Teleport while Skarmory handles strong physical attacks that Blissey struggles against. Pixilate Tapu Koko is one of the most dangerous physical threats that Skarmory can't properly handle regardless of its ability choice, so it's vital to have a teammate that answers it such as Ferrothorn or Nidoqueen. Without Dauntless Shield, strong physical wallbreakers like Terrakion can 2HKO Skarmory, which partners like Mew and Palossand can deal with. Physical Fire-types such as Cinderace and Talonflame also pose a threat should it forgo Flash Fire, making Zapdos and the aforementioned Swampert great teammates.</p> "

Like them, it can still check offensive threats like Cinderace and Barraskewda. Substitute takes advantage of passive foes like Blissey, Mew, and Ferrothorn, keeping Suicune healthy by blocking their status moves like Toxic and Leech Seed and keeping its Leftovers safe from Knock Off. This also makes Suicune harder to revenge kill and stops Trick users like Azelf and Latios from neutralizing it with a Choice item. Scald is the STAB move of choice to debilitate checks, like Ferrothorn and non-Magic Guard Chansey, and dissuade physical attackers like Zarude and Zygarde-10% from switching in with burns. Weather Ball damages Desolate Land users like Heatran, Cinderace, and Volcarona that would otherwise wall Suicune thanks to their Water immunity. Ice Beam hits Grass- and Dragon-types like Zarude, Dhelmise, Kommo-o, and Latios, as well as Water Absorb users like Landorus-T and Hippowdon. Roar phazes opposing setup sweepers like Garchomp and Mew that try to overwhelm Suicune with their own boosted attacks. Regenerator alongside Leftovers gives it much-needed longevity to pivot into attacks early-game and still maintain enough health to set up and sweep late-game. The EVs let Suicune outspeed Modest Heatran and survive a Choice Band Adaptability Terrakion's Close Combat after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Suicune fits best on balance and semi-stall teams that appreciate its defensive qualities and ability to be a dangerous wincon. Suicune still struggles against physically offensive threats like Terrakion, Garchomp, and Zygarde-10% due to its not-exceptional bulk and lack of reliable recovery; teammates that can cover them like Ferrothorn, Dauntless Shield Mew, and Hippowdon pair well with it. Specially defensive walls such as RegenVest Landorus-T and Chansey can check special attackers like Tapu Koko, Azelf, and Latios that force Suicune to switch out; in particular, the former can also check Desolate Land users such as Heatran and Volcarona if Suicune is not running Weather Ball. Due to Suicune's propensity for being weakened by entry hazards, Defog users like Corviknight and Mandibuzz can help it. If not running Roar, Unaware users like Mandibuzz and Mew can check the physical setup sweepers that would otherwise overwhelm Suicune. Spikes from teammates like Ferrothorn and Mew, and Toxic Spikes from Toxapex and Nidoqueen, can debilitate Suicune's checks like Zarude, Unaware Chansey, and Water Absorb Hippowdon.</p> "

It soft checks numerous threats such as Talonflame and Tapu Koko as well as providing Stealth Rock, which lets it fit on a wide variety of balance and offense teams. Flip Turn is Swampert's main attack, letting it keep momentum, especially against Defoggers, and regain health with Regenerator. Earth Power is an option over Earthquake to be less crippled by burn, or if the team has a Grassy Terrain setter. Toxic punishes sweepers that would like to use Swampert as setup fodder, as well as a major Defogger in Tapu Fini. Roar is an option over Toxic to phaze foes, especially Magic Guard Pokemon, which don't fear Toxic. Regenerator keeps Swampert healthy throughout the game, and Rocky Helmet chips opposing pivots while punishing physical threats. Lastly, the 0 Speed IVs and Relaxed nature allow it to slow pivot on Corviknight.</p> <p>Swampert's capacity to sponge physical moves makes Pokemon such as Blissey or users of Assault Vest good partners. Coupled with Corviknight, Swampert can check almost all physical threats in the tier and, if you add Blissey, create a strong defensive core. Offensively, strong wallbreakers such as Terrakion and Sheer Force Tapu Lele appreciate Swampert bringing them safely against Pokemon that they can threaten, such as Zapdos or Corviknight, respectively. Solid answers to Grass-types like Zarude and Dhelmise are required when using Swampert, like Corviknight, as they can come in relatively freely on an expected Earthquake or Stealth Rock and threaten it. In addition, Swampert appreciates secondary switch-ins to Fire-types such as Volcarona, Talonflame, and Desolate Land Heatran, as it cannot reliably check most of them, so physically defensive Water-types such as Tapu Fini or specially defensive Pokemon like Blissey and RegenVest Silvally-Dragon are appreciated.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With Assault Vest equipped, Swampert becomes a solid special wall against various threats such as Zapdos and Azelf. Flip Turn keeps the momentum and lets Swampert recover health while doing decent damage due to its respectable Attack. Beyond Flip Turn, this set's moveset is quite flexible. Its secondary STAB move can be either Earthquake, for greater damage overall, or Earth Power, as Swampert is prone to being burned and sometimes pairs with Grassy Terrain setters. Thanks to its insane special bulk, RegenVest Swampert can use Mirror Coat to punish special threats that it cannot hit hard such as Zapdos or Tapu Fini; however, Counter is a neat option to punish Flip Turn from Barraskewda, which it handles thanks to its great overall bulk. Counter can also punish opposing Swampert's Flip Turn if you don't want to risk the Speed tie. Stone Edge is a great option to hit Primordial Sea Zapdos, as well as punishing Volcarona and Talonflame, but Scald can be used instead to burn defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight or opposing Swampert, and it also prevents physical threats such as Zarude from coming in freely. 0 Speed IVs and a Sassy nature allow Swampert to slow pivot on Corviknight.</p> <p>Swampert and Corviknight cover each other's typing weaknesses quite well, combine to handle both special and physical threats, and form a pivoting core. Tapu Fini is also a good teammate, providing Defog support and soft checking many of the physical threats of the tier, while Swampert checks most of the special threats. Offensively, all the Pokemon that greatly appreciate safe entry from slow pivoting make good partners, like Terrakion, Barraskewda, and Heatran. This set's main weakness is its dependence on Assault Vest to check special threats, which makes it particularly vulnerable to Knock Off. Pokemon that can absorb Knock Off such as Zamazenta-C make great partners, and both usefully resist Grass for Swampert as well.</p> <h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Utility Umbrella can be used over Rocky Helmet to check Primordial Sea Barraskewda, but it's a niche option and should be used only if your team is really weak to Barraskewda, as losing Rocky Helmet makes Swampert really passive. Several other move options are possible on the RegenVest set, depending on what you want to cover. Whirlpool allows Swampert to wear down or eliminate passive threats such as Tapu Fini and Skarmory that think they are safe against it—especially when they know it’s running Assault Vest. Ice Beam and Ice Punch hit Garchomp to prevent it from setting up in front of Swampert. Lastly, in offensive teams, Eject Button can be used to grab some huge momentum and immediately bring a powerful wallbreaker onto the field, but it too is a niche option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types and Grass-type Coverage: With Swampert's 4x weakness Grass, any Grass-type move will usually KO it. Zarude, Solar Beam Heatran, and Energy Ball Tapu Lele are all huge threats for Swampert.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off: Without its Assault Vest, RegenVest Swampert's special bulk is significantly decreased and it's much harder to answer special attackers such as Zapdos, so Knock Off from Pokemon like Tapu Fini or Incineroar cripples it.</p> <p><strong>Desolate Land: Desolate Land blocks Swampert's Flip Turn, resulting in a loss of momentum. However, Swampert can threaten most Desolate Land users like Heatran with its other moves.</p> "

Moreover, after activating Flame Orb, Salamence ignores status attempts from users like Mew, Toxapex, and Blissey, making it a menace to slower-paced teams; it can even switch in and absorb Knock Off from foes like Ferrothorn and Landorus-T for its teammates. Fire Blast complements Facade to significantly weaken common Steel-type checks such as Intimidate Corviknight and Dauntless Shield Skarmory, and it is not weakened by burn. The combination of Flying-type Facade + Fire Blast grants it sufficient coverage, which means Salamence can afford to run utility moves. Roost keeps it healthy by compensating for its Stealth Rock weakness and chip damage from burn. Dragon Dance lets Salamence sweep late-game, outspeeding faster foes like Tapu Koko, Cinderace, and Terrakion and OHKOing specially defensive Ferrothorn and Garchomp.

Adaptability is a good alternative that hits neutral targets like Blissey much harder at the cost of having a harder time against Steel-types. Dragon's Maw and Magic Guard are also viable options, the former boosting Draco Meteor's power and the latter improving longevity, but their inability to break Steel-types is very undesirable; to compensate for that, Mystical Fire can be used to hit Steel-types, or Thunder can be used to specifically hit Corviknight.

Psyshock is a more consistent STAB move that also conveniently hits special walls like Blissey and Assault Vest Swampert on their weaker Defense stat, as well as hitting Fairy-types such as Tapu Fini; additionally, it OHKOes Tapu Lele after one boost. Because Latios has a good Speed tier and Psyshock does not lower Special Attack, Latios is able to finish off weakened teams with Calm Mind and Psyshock. Roost provides much-needed recovery to offset damage from entry hazards and U-turn, which Latios will often be hit by while setting up on defensive Pokemon like Corviknight.

Fast revenge killers like Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Barraskewda are also good teammates, as they can revenge kill foes like Cinderace and Tapu Koko that threaten Latios. The Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor means Latios will often be forced out, so it requires a strong defensive backbone to absorb attacks after it uses Draco Meteor. This is compounded by its low Defense, meaning partners like Corviknight and Tapu Fini are required to switch into physical attackers like Zarude and Cinderace. Latios greatly struggles with the common RegenVest Jirachi, so teammates carrying Knock Off, such as Ferrothorn and Azelf, are useful to remove Jirachi's Assault Vest. Wandering Spirit users, notably Corviknight, are also helpful, as they can take away Jirachi's Regenerator while chipping it with Rocky Helmet. Physical attackers like Cinderace and Zarude are also helpful to threaten Jirachi and other soft checks to Latios like Blissey and Ferrothorn. Teammates that can set entry hazards are very useful, as Latios needs very minor chip damage to secure the OHKO on foes like Mew and Heatran after one boost. On the other hand, Defoggers are also good teammates, as Latios's hit-and-run nature means taking a lot of entry hazard damage if they are not removed. Lastly, teammates that can safely bring in Latios, such as Blissey and Corviknight, are helpful partners, so that Latios can minimize damage taken while switching in.</p> "

Swords Dance pressures bulkier teams, as Garchomp can set up on the switches it forces and, at +2, can beat defensive stalwarts like Ferrothorn and Tapu Fini that would otherwise check it. Stealth Rock is usually used in the last moveslot since common Defoggers, such as Corviknight and Tapu Fini, cannot OHKO Garchomp. Toxic is another option to punish would-be answers such as Unaware Mandibuzz and Dauntless Shield Hippowdon or just to wear down soft checks, such as Tapu Fini and Swampert. Lastly, Substitute can be used to capitalize on Garchomp's excellent bulk and freely set up on passive foes, such as Swampert and Corviknight, that would like to pivot out or to avoid status from various defensive Pokemon, such as Dauntless Shield Mew, Swampert, and Tapu Fini. The given Speed EVs allow Garchomp to outspeed Xurkitree and Modest Tapu Lele while maximizing its special bulk in order to reliably come in on Zapdos and Volcarona.</p> <p>Garchomp fits best on balance teams that appreciate its ability to soft check various special attackers with its numerous resistances, notably Heatran, Volcarona, and Zapdos. Particularly, Pokemon that are threatened by Zapdos and Heatran, such as Corviknight and Jirachi, are good partners. In return, they can check Fairy- and Dragon-types, such as Tapu Lele and Latios, that threaten Garchomp. Despite being a soft check to numerous threats, Garchomp is limited by its lack of reliable recovery outside of Regenerator, so secondary switch-ins to threats like Zapdos and Cinderace are useful. As such, it appreciates teammates like Jirachi and Primordial Sea users, such as Zapdos and Barraskewda, to help deal with powerful Fire- and Electric-type attacks. Garchomp also appreciates entry hazard removers, such as Corviknight, in order to maintain Regenerator's utility. Lastly, Garchomp appreciates partners that can wear down or threaten Intimidate Corviknight and Dauntless Shield Mew, so partners like Terrakion and Talonflame are appreciated.</p> "

With Life Orb, Garchomp's attacks are extremely powerful and able to 2HKO defensive staples of the metagame, such as Tapu Fini, Swampert, and Ferrothorn, after entry hazard damage; Garchomp's wallbreaking ability is only further augmented by Swords Dance. Scale Shot is a good Dragon-type STAB move that can break through Flying-types, such as Landorus-T and Zapdos, while boosting Garchomp's Speed, making it very hard to revenge kill without priority moves. Stone Edge is another option to hit Tapu Bulu and Flying-types without lowering its Defense. Stealth Rock capitalizes on the switches Garchomp forces as well as its ability to heavily damage most Defoggers with its coverage. Fire Fang and Stone Edge are also viable options to hit Corviknight and Tapu Bulu better, especially in conjunction with Swords Dance. An Adamant nature is preferred to maximize damage rolls on Tapu Fini and Swampert, but a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed Pokemon with base 100 Speed, such as Zapdos. A bulkier spread with 156 EVs in Speed and the rest in HP or Special Defense can also be used to allow Garchomp to take hits from threats like Heatran and Zapdos better while still outspeeding Timid Heatran.</p> <p>Offensive Regenerator Garchomp fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate its wallbreaking power and ability to switch in several times throughout a game. Pokemon that appreciate its ability to threaten Heatran and Tapu Fini, such as Tapu Koko and Barraskewda, are good partners. Fast, specially offensive pivots, such as Tapu Koko and Azelf, can bring Garchomp in on special walls, such as Blissey or RegenVest Jirachi. If Garchomp is not carrying Stealth Rock, entry hazards setters, such as Swampert and Ferrothorn, are good partners to wear down Garchomp's answers. It also appreciates entry hazards removers, such as Tapu Fini, to maximize the health given by Regenerator. Pokemon that can wear down Corviknight and Dauntless Shield Mew, such as Barraskewda and Zarude, are also good teammates. However, you need to be careful when pairing Garchomp with Zarude, as Grassy Terrain reduces Earthquake's power. Due to Garchomp's weakness to Fairy- and Dragon-types, Steel-types are often good teammates in order to check the likes of Tapu Lele, Togekiss, and Latios; accordingly, RegenVest Jirachi and Heatran make good partners. Since Garchomp is not particularly fast without Scale Shot's Speed boost, fast pivots, such as Scarf Azelf and Barraskewda, are appreciated to pressure faster foes.</p> "

It can also deter setup thanks to Whirlwind and Toxic, which can force out an opposing setup sweeper or put them on a timer. Earthquake is often Hippowdon's only attacking move and notably allows it to beat Tapu Koko. Body Press is another attacking option that provides solid coverage alongside Earthquake, notably hitting Zarude and Ferrothorn, which may try and switch in, but it usually comes at the expense of Toxic.

Hippowdon is unable to check Grass-type attackers, namely Zarude, Tapu Bulu, and Dhelmise, so Corviknight and Mandibuzz make excellent teammates.

Hippowdon is often unable to damage Talonflame, requiring a reliable switch-in such as Primordial Sea Zapdos. While Hippowdon does not particularly fear Stealth Rock, Spikes or Toxic Spikes can turn several key 3HKOs into 2HKOs, so a reliable Defogger like Corviknight is advised.</p> "

However, because it needs to rely on Draining Kiss for recovery instead of Roost, this set doesn't have as much longevity as the standard two attack set.

        "description": "<p>Togekiss acts as a late-game sweeper capable of outspeeding every non-Triage Pokemon with its +3 priority-boosted recovery moves. Draining Kiss acts as Togekiss's main STAB move, and despite its Base Power, its damage output can be increased greatly with Life Orb and Nasty Plot. Togekiss is able to effectively outspeed the entire metagame, meaning Pokemon that can effectively revenge kill it are few and far between, being limited to Fairy resistant Pokemon and Dazzling or Psychic Surge Pokemon. This gives Togekiss a uniquely good matchup versus pivot-heavy bulky offense teams that do not carry an offensive Fire- or Steel- type. Togekiss is also able to set up on and brute-force its way through passive switch-ins such as Corviknight and non-Toxic Blissey. In the late game, Togekiss especially shines as a setup sweeper and wincon when the opponent's team is sufficiently weakened. Because Roost is also a healing move, it benefits from the +3 priority boost provided from Triage as well, allowing Togekiss to sponge some attacks with its above-average bulk and excellent typing and allowing it to act as a check to key threats such as Zarude and Garchomp. Due to Togekiss's narrow niche and need for heavy chip damage on Pokemon that resist its moves to execute a successful sweep, it should be considered as a specialist, only being brought in when a KO can be guaranteed or to pressure exceptionally weak foes out. For coverage moves, Togekiss mainly chooses between Flamethrower and Psyshock. Flamethrower allows it to pressure and beat Steel-types more effectively, while Psyshock allows Togekiss to put a dent into special walls like Blissey and Poison-types like Toxapex. A Modest nature with maximum Special Attack investment aim to maximize Togekiss's offensive capabilities; since it is priority-reliant, Speed and HP investment can be customized, but the current spread allows it to outpace defensive Heatran.</p> <p>Because of its fast Fairy-type attacks, Togekiss acts as an excellent teammate for those that struggle to outpace Dragon-, Fighting-, and Dark-types like Garchomp, Galarian Zapdos, and Zarude. Bulky pivots like Regenerator Swampert and Blissey are both able to weaken those fast threats while switching into Togekiss to clean up with Draining Kiss. Togekiss also pairs nicely with offensive powerhouses like Tinted Lens Latios and Primordial Sea Barraskewda, which can put easily exploitable dents into an opponent's team composition, giving Togekiss a greater opportunity to overwhelm the opponent in the endgame. Because Fire-types are going to be some of Togekiss's first switch-ins, Fire resist-resistant teammates to tank attacks from Fire-types like Volcarona and Heatran are essential teammates. Regenerator Garchomp and Swampert are good teammates to tank attacks while also setting up Stealth Rock. On a similar note, setup sweepers that share the same offensive checks also make great teammates for Togekiss—Sheer Force Tapu Lele and Triage Tapu Bulu can help clear the way for Togekiss by threatening to sweep unless a Fire-type is brought in to revenge kill them, in which case they can chip it low enough that Togekiss can clean up in the lategame, or vice versa. Pokemon that are able to set up hazards and pivot out slowly are also essential teammates for Togekiss, as their hazards weaken Togekiss's offensive switch-ins and allow for more wiggle room for Togekiss to set up Nasty Plot and execute a sweep. Finally, physically offensive Ground-types like Landorus-T or Garchomp are able to threaten Togekiss's common Steel-type counters such as Assault Vest Jirachi, as well as harming specially defensive walls like Blissey, enabling Togekiss's late-game cleanup.</p> "

Earthquake provides reliable damage and OHKOes Tapu Koko, which Excadrill is often tasked with checking. Iron Head is a secondary STAB move that helps against Tapu Lele, but Rock Slide is an option to beat Defog Moltres and catch Talonflame on the switch. Toxic is also an option to poison Excadrill's common switch-ins like Tapu Fini and Garchomp. Stealth Rock makes Excadrill an all-in-one entry hazard control package and allows it to force chip damage onto Tapu Koko. Rocky Helmet is the preferred item to further chip Pixilate Tapu Koko and opposing pivots.

Knock Off is its most consistent attack, removing important items such as Leftovers and Rocky Helmet from foes. Spikes supports its teammates by providing chip damage, and combined with Knock Off can help chip Pokemon even if they carry Heavy-Duty Boots. Power Whip is a powerful STAB option that deals significant damage to Water-type Pokemon, notably Tapu Fini to prevent it from clearing Spikes with Defog, and also 2HKOes Tapu Koko. Body Press can be used instead to target Heatran and opposing Ferrothorn. Thunder Wave further cripples switch-ins, slowing them and potentially denying their entry hazard removal. If Ferrothorn runs Body Press, Iron Defense is an alternative that allows it to beat Corviknight one-on-one, which otherwise prevent it from setting Spikes. It can also beat some Fighting-type Pokemon like Terrakion and Mienshao if they switch in on the turn Ferrothorn boosts its Defense. Rocky Helmet helps it punish contact moves, usually U-turn and Flip Turn from the likes of Landorus-T and Barraskewda. Chople Berry allows Ferrothorn to survive a Close Combat from Terrakion and Barraskewda and OHKO back with Power Whip. Finally, Heavy-Duty Boots lets Ferrothorn ignore Spikes damage and pivot into attackers like Tapu Koko more reliably. The given EV spread allows it to avoid the 2HKO from Inteleon's and Primarina's Hydro Pump, the 4HKO from Pixilate Tapu Koko's Facade, and the OHKO from Barraskewda's Close Combat without Chople Berry intact.</p> <p>Regenerator Ferrothorn finds its place on almost all team styles. Primordial Sea Zapdos is a great partner for Ferrothorn, as it can take on Fire-types like Heatran that force Ferrothorn out, while Ferrothorn can handle Rock- and Water-type moves that threaten Zapdos. Zapdos also complements Ferrothorn's Spikes by threatening all common Defoggers and spinners such as Mandibuzz and Corviknight and pivoting with either U-turn or Volt Switch to rack up Spikes damage. Heatran can form a hazard stack core together with Ferrothorn and also deny Defog with Taunt. Together with Tapu Fini, they form a solid defensive Fire / Water / Grass core with a lot of useful utility options. Offensive threats appreciate Ferrothorn's Spikes to help them pick up more key KOs, especially those that can pivot to wear down their checks and counters such as Galarian Zapdos and Primordial Sea Barraskewda.

Leech Seed is mandatory because of its lack of a reliable recovery move, allowing it to chip switch ins such as Corviknight while restoring HP. Knock Off removes items from them, discouraging Pokemon that heavily rely on their item such as Zapdos from switching in. Body Press is another option which targets foes that don't mind losing their item such as opposing Ferrothorn, while also hitting Heatran. Power Whip lets Ferrothorn pressure Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Swampert; however, Gyro Ball is a good alternative that hits foes like Tapu Lele and Togekiss harder. Spikes is a great last option to support its teammates, as Ferrothorn forces many switches. Protect instead lets it scout moves from Choice item Pokemon such as Terrakion and get more health back from Leftovers and Leech Seed. If Ferrothorn runs Body Press and Gyro Ball, Curse can also be considered, potentially sweeping against unprepared opponents. Bulletproof allows Ferrothorn to comfortably wall Sheer Force Tapu Lele, and should be paired with Gyro Ball to OHKO it in return. Flash Fire and Primordial Sea negate Ferrothorn's Fire weakness, allowing it to check dangerous attackers such as Heatran and Entei, with Flash Fire being more vulnerable to Mold Breaker Heatran while Primordial Sea risks getting overridden by a Desolate Land switch-in and doesn't stop Will-O-Wisp. Leftovers helps Ferrothorn make up for its lack of reliable recovery. 252 HP EVs maximizes Leftovers recovery; if Gyro Ball is used, Ferrothorn should run 0 Speed and a Sassy nature to make it hit as hard as possible.</p> <p>Specially defensive Ferrothorn finds its place in teams that need an utility special wall that can also handle either Tapu Lele or Fire-type Pokemon.

For example, Intimidate Corviknight can form an entry hazard control duo with Ferrothorn and check Terrakion, while Ferrothorn takes on Heatran and Volcanion for Corviknight. Similarly, Tapu Fini can cover for Ferrothorn's weaknesses, provide a midground switch in case a Desolate Land Pokemon overrides Ferrothorn's Primordial Sea, and cripple defensive threats with Trick. Offensive threats with pivot like Galarian Zapdos and Talonflame utilize Ferrothorn's Spikes well. Tapu Koko, in particular, can take on Galarian Zapdos and pressure common entry hazard removers. Garchomp can stack entry hazards alongside Ferrothorn with Stealth Rock and also set up Swords Dance to punish hazard removal attempts.</p> "

Hydreigon's third move is flexible based on team needs. Flash Cannon hits Fairy-types such as Togekiss, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Bulu, Dark Pulse hits Assault Vest Jirachi—which otherwise can survive Hydreigon's attacks comfortably, and Shock Wave can OHKO Tapu Fini after minor chip damage. Roost allows Hydreigon to stay healthy over the course of a game to wallbreak multiple times, while running three attacks instead lets Hydreigon pressure more Pokemon.

Dauntless Shield Mew is one of the most reliable answers as it is never 2HKOed by any of Terrakion's common moves without a critical hit, but even Dauntless Shield Corviknight fails to check Terrakion reliably as Stealth Rock damage is enough to let it get 2HKOed by Close Combat. Terrakion's base 108 Speed is enough to outpace all common defensive Pokemon and a number of common breakers, including Zapdos and Garchomp, giving it plenty of Pokemon to force out if brought in via a slow pivot or after a KO. While Terrakion will almost always be using its STAB moves, Earthquake is a 100% accurate option to hit Toxapex and Doublade without getting PP stalled, Megahorn lets Terrakion 2HKO Dauntless Shield Mew and Slowbro after Stealth Rock, and Toxic is a nice option to cripple walls that Terrakion cannot 2HKO like Dauntless Shield Mew and Hippowdon. Stealth Rock is also an option to let Terrakion get entry hazards up on a predicted switch if the opponent has a reliable answer to it.

Defensive pivots also make good teammates as Terrakion is often forced out after it gets a KO due to its mediocre bulk and only slightly above-average Speed. Good offensive teammates include fast physical attackers that like to take advantage of the weakened or broken defensive cores that Terrakion creates such as Barraskewda and Zarude.

Offensive Pokemon like Barraskewda, Kommo-o, and Zarude appreciate Landorus-T's ability to switch into hits from strong offensive threats like Magic Guard Tapu Koko and Volcarona. Due to its average Defense, Landorus-T appreciates teammates like Intimidate Corviknight that can handle strong physical hits from Pokemon like Zarude. It can also be overwhelmed by particularly strong special attackers, like Volcanion and Inteleon, so more specially defensive teammates like Blissey can be used to take hits from them. Landorus-T relies on its Assault Vest to effectively perform as a special pivot, so teammates like Tapu Fini that can take Knock Off are appreciated so Landorus-T can preserve its bulk. Due to Regenerator being Landorus-T's only means of recovering HP, entry hazard removers like Excadrill and Mandibuzz are appreciated to minimize chip damage; it also benefits from entry hazard support like Spikes Mew to take advantage of the numerous switches it forces and item removal it provides.</p> "

Earthquake OHKOes many premier attackers, such as Tapu Koko, Terrakion, and Cinderace. It also forces out common defensive Pokemon like Heatran, Jirachi, and Blissey. U-turn takes advantage of the switches Landorus-T forces, allowing it to safely bring in a teammate like Tapu Koko. Knock Off offers useful utility in removing items from switch-ins, such as Corviknight and Ferrothorn, and is its best option against Dhelmise. Stone Edge keeps Talonflame, Zapdos, and unboosted Volcarona in check, but do note that Zapdos survives a hit from full health and can threaten an OHKO in return. Because of Stone Edge's limited use otherwise, Defog can be utilized instead as an emergency entry hazard removal option, and it takes advantage of Landorus-T's positive matchup against Heatran, one of the best Stealth Rock setters. Regenerator keeps Landorus-T healthy throughout a game to repeatedly pivot into threats like Tapu Koko and Talonflame, fulfilling its role as an offensive pivot. The given Speed investment in conjunction with a Choice Scarf allows Landorus-T to outspeed Barraskewda; the remaining EVs are put into HP and Defense to maximize bulk, which notably allows Landorus-T to survive a Stone Edge from Terrakion.</p> <p>Landorus-T fits on balance teams in need of a check to dangerous attackers like Tapu Koko, Terrakion, and Talonflame. It pairs well with defensive Pokemon like Corviknight, Jirachi, and Blissey, as they can invite the aforementioned wallbreakers in and then pivot into Landorus-T. At the same time, Landorus-T complements special attackers greatly by threatening special walls such as Heatran, Jirachi, and Blissey, further forming a VoltTurn core with the likes of Tapu Koko, Azelf, and Genesect. Zapdos forms a particularly stellar offensive core with Landorus-T, as it can come in on Corviknight, Tapu Fini, and Garchomp, among other foes that attempt to check Landorus-T; in return, Landorus-T outspeeds and checks revenge killers like Terrakion. Landorus-T is also weak to common Water- and Ice-type attacks from the likes of Genesect, Zapdos, and Swampert, so teammates like Tapu Fini and Desolate Land Heatran are essential to help cover them. Additionally, Blissey can switch into Zapdos and chip it via Seismic Toss, greatly helping Landorus-T in revenge killing Zapdos.

With a boost and STAB from Aerilate, Explosion can OHKO most foes that do not resist it, such as Tapu Fini, and severely dent resistant Pokemon like Corviknight and Zapdos. In addition, it provides teammates a free switch in while denying any Defog or Rapid Spin attempts, mainly by Corviknight. Earthquake hits Steel-types and Electric-types like Heatran, Tapu Koko, and Jirachi that resist Explosion. Swords Dance boosts Explosion damage to monstrous levels, notably giving a chance to OHKO Corviknight. Alternatively, Body Slam allows Landorus-T to threaten foes with paralysis before using Explosion, which is useful against more offensive teams. Focus Sash is preferred to give Landorus-T an extra turn to work with and guarantee it can set up Stealth Rock. Life Orb is suboptimal for a dedicated lead, but it instead provides extra wallbreaking power for Corviknight and Zapdos. A Jolly Nature is used to outspeed the likes of Genesect and Tapu Lele with a neutral nature.</p> <p>Landorus-T finds its home on hyper offense teams, where dangerous sweepers like Tinted Lens Genesect and Bulk Up Cinderace can take full advantage of a free switch in, as well as Stealth Rock support. Cinderace, alongside other Fire-types like Volcarona, is especially useful to immediately force out a Corviknight that took Landorus-T's Explosion, denying it any chance to use using Defog or Roost. Consequently, strong physical attackers like Terrakion, Zarude, and Garchomp fit well with the pairing, as they greatly benefit from Corviknight being weakened. Focus Sash variants do not require much support, as their main goal is to set up Stealth Rock and use Explosion, but Life Orb variants, being less of suicide leads, appreciate Desolate Land users like Volcarona to take on Water-types like Swampert and Barraskewda. Life Orb Landorus-T especially enjoys teammates like Terrakion and Garchomp, as they burden walls like Corviknight and Tapu Fini to check both them and Landorus-T; this pressure on the walls lessens the need for Landorus-T to heavily chip them but sacrifice itself via Explosion.</p> "

In a metagame that has few viable Rock-types, Talonflame's STAB moves provide fantastic coverage, with the only common resistant foes being Primordial Sea Zapdos or Tapu Koko and Flash Fire Corviknight. Thanks to its high Base Power moves and Life Orb, which have their recoil negated by Magic Guard, Talonflame hits surprisingly hard despite having a low Attack stat. For reference, fully physically defensive Swampert cannot safely switch into Talonflame if it is below 80% health, as it risks getting 2HKOed by Brave Bird. Talonflame possesses a great Speed tier for AAA, leaving it only outspeed by Barraskewda, Tapu Koko, and the rare Zamazenta-C. Additionally, it resists every common Triage move and Grassy Glide, making it difficult to revenge kill with priority. Swords Dance amplifies Talonflame's offensive presence, and it can often find time to set up safely against either offensive threats it forces out, like Volcarona and Zarude, or defensive stalwarts that are unable to KO it back like Corviknight and most Mew. Its power, access to setup, and longevity make it particularly effective at breaking down bulkier teams. Talonflame does really need to run maximum Attack and Speed with Jolly to maximize its offensive capabilities.</p> <p>Talonflame fits well on bulky offense or balance teams that want offensive pressure without having to provide much support. Since it is immune to all entry hazards, Talonflame doesn't require hazard control, and Magic Guard means it can't be worn down by stray Toxics or Rocky Helmets (although it does fear paralysis). Since its bulk is not fantastic, it does appreciate slow pivots like Swampert and Corviknight to bring it in safely; in exchange, it forces out foes like Cinderace or Volcarona that may have tried to come in on them. There are some common switch-ins that frustrate Talonflame, however; Primordial Sea Zapdos in particular can't be hit neutrally and forces it out, so teammates that can handle Zapdos like RegenVest Swampert, Blissey, and Silvally-Dragon are always appreciated. Additionally, while Talonflame is fast, most Choice Scarf users and a few faster threats—Tapu Koko and Barraskewda—can revenge kill it reliably. Good revenge killers or solid switch-ins to those are strongly advised; Choice Scarf Azelf is especially notable as a great revenge killer that lets Talonflame in often with U-turn.</p> "

Flare Blitz is the Fire-type move of choice, as it hits special walls like Blissey and Jirachi on their weaker defense while also having more PP and accuracy than other Fire-type moves. Earth Power nails Toxapex as well as Desolate Land users like Heatran and Cinderace. Substitute further increases Volcanion's wallbreaking prowess by allowing it to set up on Pokemon like Toxapex, Jirachi, and Ferrothorn lacking Power Whip and conveniently avoids the risk of its Life Orb being removed by Knock Off; alternatively, Sludge Bomb allows it to beat Tapu Fini more easily and threatens to inflict poison on Pokemon like Desolate Land Moltres and Choice Scarf Latias, which otherwise avoid the 2HKO from Volcanion. Magic Guard and Life Orb synergize well together and provide excellent longevity and power, notably giving Volcanion an immunity to entry hazards.

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its fantastic defensive typing and bulk, in conjunction with priority recovery and stat clearing with Haze, Prankster Toxapex is a great physical wall and setup deterrent. Its typing provides important resistances to Fire-, Fighting-, and Water-types, checking dangerous physical attackers like Cinderace, Terrakion, and Barraskewda. Toxapex's most significant role lies in deterring setup with Prankster Haze, which stops dangerous threats like Cosmic Power Mew and Quiver Dance Volcarona from making progress. It can also serve as an emergency check to threats it does not outright beat like Dragon Dance Power Construct Zygarde-10% and Swords Dance Garchomp by sacrificing itself to remove their boosts. Recover also benefits from Prankster, allowing Toxapex to switch in, sponge a hit, and heal off the damage before taking a second one. Knock Off provides utility by removing items, which can be especially useful against Choice Band users and defensive Pokemon that rely on utility items. The last move slot is more flexible; Scald threatens physical attackers that might consider staying in with a burn, Toxic Spikes help wear down offensive teams, and Toxic weakens potential sweepers. Black Sludge is the preferred item to provide extra recovery, while Rocky Helmet is an option to punish physical attackers, especially if Toxapex is the main Barraskewda switch-in. Maximum HP and Defense investment is necessary to repeatedly switch into dangerous physical attackers, while zero Speed IVs allow Toxapex to outspeed opponents in Trick Room; this is especially important to remove Marowak-Alola's Thick Club with Knock Off.</p> <p>Toxapex is best utilized on balance and bulky offense teams that want to counter a wide range of opposing setup sweepers without devoting space to an elaborate defensive core. Toxapex is a great backstop when an attacker gets forced out; Prankster Haze removes the threat of the opponent using the free turn to set up, and Prankster Recover, plus Toxapex's great bulk, makes it difficult to KO. As such, Toxapex makes a great partner to Choice item wallbreakers such as Terrakion and Azelf. These wallbreakers also appreciate Toxapex's Knock Off and Toxic Spikes, as they wear down the opposing team even faster. Toxapex can also cover for other passive defensive partners like Blissey by denying sweepers that can set up on Blissey. Due to its Ground weakness, Toxapex is unable to check Garchomp, Landorus-T, or Zygarde-10%, so a secondary physically defensive switch-in like Intimidate Corviknight or Dauntless Shield Mew is appreciated. Toxapex is also a poor switch-in to Psychic- and Electric-type attacks, but these tend to be specially-oriented and should be handled by a special wall like Jirachi instead. Since Toxapex is heavily reliant on using Recover to stay healthy, it is vulnerable to entry hazards and opposing pivots. Reliable Defog support from Corviknight and the ability to punish pivots with entry hazard support&amp;mdashwhich includes its own Toxic Spikes&amp;mdash is strongly advised. Since Toxapex does not have access to a pivot move and can often be a momentum drain, it pairs well with other defensive pivots, such as Corvikinght and RegenVest Jirachi, which can generate momentum.</p> "

It can run a physical Magic Guard set with Wild Charge, Brave Bird, U-turn, and Roost or Toxic; this set can beat special walls like Heatran, but is otherwise outclassed by the listed sets. Primordial Sea has a good niche in checking Fire-types, mainly Talonflame, and a perfectly accurate Thunder, while still offering decent power and revenge killing ability; however, it is unable to check other key Fire-types like Cinderace and Entei and is largely outclassed by Zapdos, which offers better bulk, higher power, and amazing coverage. Levitate is a decent alternative on Calm Mind sets, as it beats Tapu Koko's biggest check in Landorus-T, and turns other Ground-types into setup fodder. Calm Mind Magic Guard Tapu Koko is also able to forgo electric coverage for Iron Defense, enabling it to continue to boost towards a win even versus the Ground-types that typically force it out, but it loses its ability to defeat Toxapex and also struggles to KO Steel-types without a significant number of Special Attack boosts. Refrigerate Hyper Voice is another niche to beat Ground-types that is able to swiftly eliminate the likes of Landorus-T and Garchomp, though Ice-type coverage sees limited use otherwise. Additionally, both sets forgo Magic Guard, making them more susceptible to being worn down.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Common Ground-types such as Swampert and Landorus-T can switch into any move other than Facade and force out Tapu Koko with a Ground-type move. Specially defensive Garchomp can tank a Dazzling Gleam and KO back.</p> <p><strong>Volt Absorb</strong>: Volt Absorb users like Corviknight and Toxapex can also switch into any attack, but have to watch out for Taunt denying their recovery. Corviknight is also turned into setup fodder by Calm Mind Tapu Koko variants.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Tapu Koko crumbles to any faster Pokemon, such as Azelf, Barraskewda, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, given its middling bulk. The latter can also switch into most of Tapu Koko's attacks with ease. Priority users, namely Zarude and Dhelmise, threaten to severely weaken Tapu Koko with Grassy Glide.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Steel-types: Ferrothorn resists Tapu Koko's dual STAB move combination and threatens to 2HKO or set up Spikes. RegenVest Jirachi can soak up any attack and bring in a revenge killer via U-turn; Heatran take little from any of Tapu Koko's attacks and threatens to trap it using Magma Storm; however, non-Regenerator Heatran has to be careful not to take too much chip as its only source of recovery is Leftovers.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>With blazing speed, strong STAB move combination, access to Roost, and a useful set of resistances, Tapu Koko is one of the best offensive pivots in the tier. Its Speed tier allows it to revenge kill key threats such as Talonflame, Terrakion, and Latios. Dazzling Gleam is a good secondary STAB move that reliably hits Pokemon that resist Thunderbolt such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Zarude. Magic Guard and Roost give Tapu Koko decent longevity to offensively check threats like Talonflame and Zapdos throughout a game. Life Orb also pairs well with Magic Guard and gives Tapu Koko a free boost to make up for its mediocre attacking stats. U-turn allows it to pivot out of bad matchups such as the aforementioned Ground-types, as well as Heatran and Blissey.</p> <p>Tapu Koko easily fits on bulky offense and balance teams in need of a revenge killer or a pivot. Wallbreakers like Terrakion and Dhelmise are great offensive partners: the former capitalizes on the special walls Tapu Koko forces in, such as Heatran, and is extremely difficult to switch into; the latter covers Tapu Koko's weakness against Ground-types and turns them into setup fodder while also providing Grassy Terrain support. In return, Tapu Koko threatens their checks like Tapu Fini and Corviknight. Heatran also deserves special mention, as it is one of the best Stealth Rock setters in the tier and is able to chip down special walls like Landorus-T and Blissey. Furthermore, it lures in and poisons Zapdos, which lets Tapu Koko beat non-Weather Ball variants more reliably. Tapu Koko struggles with Ground-types in general, especially Choice Scarf Landorus-T, so it is necessary to pair it with Flying-types like your own Landorus-T and Corviknight. Wandering Spirit variants are especially helpful, as they can remove Regenerator from Swampert's and Landorus-T, eventually chipping them into KO range of Dazzling Gleam. Both Landorus-T and Corviknight also form potent VoltTurn cores with Tapu Koko and can switch into faster threats like Choice Scarf Azelf and Zarude.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With very few physically defensive walls that resist Fairy-type in the tier, and many of the relevant ones being weak to Electric, Pixilate Facade Tapu Koko excels in putting tremendous pressure onto defensive builds. Facade, when boosted by Flame Orb and Pixilate, is very strong and can 2HKO many neutral foes like Landorus-T, Zapdos, and Swampert. Volt Switch allows Tapu Koko to pivot out of unfavorable matchups like Heatran while hitting Corviknight and Toxapex super effectively; Thunderbolt allows it to actually beat the aforementioned Corviknight and Toxapex, as they can otherwise use a recovery move as Tapu Koko uses Volt Switch. Roost is mandatory to offset burn and entry hazard damage. Taunt prevents its switch-ins like Volt Absorb Corviknight from healing and pairs very well with Volt Switch to weaken foes. Work Up is usable to boost both of Tapu Koko's attacking stats, allowing it to function as a cleaner, though Facade is already strong enough to pick off weakened foes, and boosted Thunderbolt is still weak. A Jolly nature is preferred to preserve bulk; Hasty nature is also an option on Work Up variants, notably being able to 2HKO Toxapex.</p> <p>Tapu Koko fits on most balance and offense teams thanks to its top-notch Speed tier and its ability to keep opposing walls at low health. As such, it pairs well with entry hazards setters like Swampert and Heatran to chip down foes. Tapu Koko pairs well with strong attackers in general, as it is able to either wallbreak early-game or clean up late-game. Zygarde-10% is a prime partner to form a core with Tapu Koko where they both can either wallbreak or clean up; Tapu Koko can Taunt shared checks like Dauntless Shield Mew and keep them at low health, while using Volt Switch against checks like Heatran and Jirachi to bring in Zygarde-10%. Tapu Koko is frail, especially considering burn damage, so it appreciates a defensive pivot to safely bring it in. Vaporeon is remarkably a good partner as it can use Wish + Flip Turn to reliably heal Tapu Koko. A Flying-type like Landorus-T or Zapdos is also essential to alleviate Tapu Koko's glaring weakness to Ground-types; they are also helpful in checking Heatran, which is the single largest roadblock to Tapu Koko given its 4x Fairy resistance.</p> "

Taunt also prevents opposing leads like Heatran from setting up entry hazards, which is very useful for hyper offense teams that Tapu Koko finds home in. U-turn brings in teammates while preserving Tapu Koko to set up screens later in the game. Light Clay allows dual screens to last for an extra 3 turns, giving additional protection for its teammates. Aroma Veil protects Tapu Koko from opposing Taunt and Encore, while Prankster lets it use priority Taunt and dual screens. Maximum HP and Speed investment allow Tapu Koko to be as bulky as possible while outspeeding every Pokemon up to Talonflame to set up screens before the opponent attacks. 248 Speed EVs is also an option to move after opposing Tapu Koko, allowing it to bring in teammates safely.</p> <p>Tapu Koko is a great asset on hyper offensive teams, as dangerous sweepers like Tapu Lele, Genesect, and Togekiss can take full advantage of dual screens to set up Belly Drum, Shift Gear, and Nasty Plot, respectively, and become much harder to revenge kill. However, Tapu Koko might not be able to get both screens up against common Ground-type leads like Swampert, so switch-ins like Dhelmise are necessary to prevent the opponent from freely using Earthquake. Dhelmise also provides useful priority and good wallbreaking potential. Teammates that can pressure Corviknight and Tapu Fini, like Cinderace, are essential to prevent the opponent from bringing in their Defogger once Tapu Koko is switched out.</p> "

Thunderbolt and Dazzling Gleam are the main STAB moves of choice, hitting common metagame staples like Corviknight and Garchomp for super effective damage. Life Orb in conjunction with Magic Guard provides Tapu Koko with a free power boost as well as an immunity to passive damage, but Leftovers can be used to minimize the amount of times it needs to use Roost. The EV spread allows Tapu Koko to survive a Choice Band Grassy Glide from Grassy Surge Zarude and OHKO back with a boosted Dazzling Gleam while still Speed tying opposing Tapu Koko.</p> <p>Tapu Koko fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that can offer support as it tries to set up a sweep in the late-game. Teammates like Zarude and Heatran offer pivoting momentum and entry hazard support, while they appreciate Tapu Koko's ability to offensively check threats like Talonflame and Galarian Zapdos. Talonflame and Galarian Zapdos also benefit from being paired with Tapu Koko, as they capitalize on Ferrothorn and RegenVest Jirachi trying to switch into Tapu Koko. Tapu Koko struggles to break RegenVest Swampert and Landorus-T, so it does well with partners that can repeatedly switch into them like Regenerator Ferrothorn and Wandering Spirit Corviknight. Water-types like Suicune, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini prevent Barraskewda from revenge killing Tapu Koko, and Suicune, in particular, is also able to form a Calm Mind core with Tapu Koko that continuously pressures opposing teams.</p> "

Tapu Fini's typing and bulk allow it to serve as a blanket check to prominent physical attackers like Garchomp, Barraskewda, and Terrakion; the use of Rocky Helmet serves as a means for Tapu Fini to switch in and passively limit the amount of times they can attack successfully. Leftovers allows Tapu Fini to slightly increase its passive recovery so that it doesn't have to switch immediately versus opposing attackers. Tapu Fini also serves as one of the most effective counters to Barraskewda, as it can easily restore chip damage from Flip Turn with Regenerator while punishing Barrskewda with Rocky Helmet.

Thanks to its typing, it is able to check a unique array of threats, from Fairy-types like Tapu Koko to Fire-types like Talonflame and Chandelure. Furthermore, Nihilego can also pressure common Defoggers like Tapu Fini and Mandibuzz, making it a great Toxic Spikes setter. Stealth Rock is a good alternative, but it competes with other Pokemon like Garchomp as a setter. Sludge Bomb is a spammable STAB move that allows Nihilego to spread additional poison and hits Tapu Fini. Power Gem hits Flying-types like Mandibuzz and Corviknight, and Talonflame, as well as Cinderace. Knock Off pairs well with Toxic Spikes, threatening Pokemon that get around Toxic Spikes like Heavy-Duty Boots users, Magic Guard users, and Steel-types like Assault Vest Jirachi. Regenerator provides Nihilego with much-needed longevity, allowing it to repeatedly switch into foes and set entry hazards. The given EV spread and a Calm nature ensure that Chandelure never 2HKOes Nihilego with Shadow Ball, while the remaining EVs improve Nihilego's abysmal physical bulk, enabling it to check the likes of Pixilate Tapu Koko and Talonflame.</p> <p>Nihilego fits best on balance teams with wallbreakers that appreciate it setting entry hazards reliably and checking some of the most dangerous wallbreakers in the metagame. Poisoning Pokemon, especially Ground-types such as Swampert, Garchomp and Hippowdon, allows wallbreakers like Desolate Land Heatran, Inteleon, and Garchomp to overwhelm them. These Pokemon also provide immediate pressure, which Nihilego often struggles at delivering. It pairs equally well with defensive pivots like Corviknight and Blissey, as it can switch into powerful wallbreakers like Chandelure and Tapu Koko that they struggle with; in return, these Pokemon can check Ground- and Water-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Inteleon, which Nihilego struggles with. As Nihilego crumbles to any physical attack it does not resist, sturdy physical walls like Dauntless Shield Mew and Skarmory are necessary teammates. Both Pokemon can also set Spikes, forming a dangerous entry hazard-stacking core with Nihilego. An additional answer to Cinderace in particular is helpful, like Toxapex and Primordial Sea Zapdos, as it is able to 2HKO Nihilego and the aforementioned wall. Lastly, Nihilego and its offensive teammates appreciate pivots like Tapu Koko and Mew, as they can keep up momentum with Toxic Spikes on the field, maximizing chip damage and preventing the opponent from removing it.</p> "

Superpower rounds out its coverage by hitting Flash Fire Ferrothorn hard. Stone Edge, on the other hand, gives it a secondary STAB option that provides good neutral coverage on Steelworker variants; however, the coverage from Superpower is usually preferred. Steelworker maximizes Gyro Ball damage against neutral targets such as Hippowdon, while Tinted Lens helps Stakataka net important 2HKOs on foes such as offensive Heatran and specially defensive Swampert.

Be careful when attacking with Corviknight, however, as it may give your opponent their ability back if they have already activated Wandering Spirit.

However, using Choice Scarf instead of Choice Band severely limits Barraskewda's potential to KO, as it already outspeeds a majority of the format.</p> <p>Psychic Fangs is another coverage option, but its uses are limited to only hitting Toxapex. However, it only has a small chance to 2HKO, and Prankster Recover immediately heals any significant damage.</p> <p>Poison Jab can also be used to 2HKO Tapu Fini and can spread poison onto foes, but is generally outclassed by Close Combat.</p> <p>Ice Fang allows Barraskewda to OHKO Garchomp and Water Absorb Landorus-T, with the latter one completely blocking it otherwise.</p> <p>Magic Guard + Life Orb sets, while significantly weaker, help solve Barraskewda's biggest issue of longevity by bypassing hazards and Rocky Helmet. It offers much less breaking power, but better sustainability if that is what your team needs.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Toxapex: Toxapex is Barraskewda's worst nightmare, sporting sky-high physical bulk and a resistance to Water moves. Its chance to burn with Scald and access to Prankster healing and status-inducing moves mean it will usually come out on top.</p> <p><strong>Water-immune Pokemon</strong>: Desolate Land users such as Moltres and Water Absorb Pokemon such as Palossand are able to completely sap Barraskewda's momentum.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-type Checks: Pokemon that resist Water and aren't weak to Barraskewda's coverage options, such as Tapu Fini, are almost always free to switch in and heal the damage done.</p> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet Users</strong>: One of Barraskewda's largest weaknesses is residual damage, and Rocky Helmet users such as Mew, Tapu Fini, Swampert, and Corviknight are able to punish Barraskewda for using Flip Turn. This damage racks up over the course of the game, making Barraskewda less of a threat.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Barraskewda is a strong offensive pivot, revenge killer, and late-game cleaner with powerful rain-boosted STAB moves and an incredible Speed tier. Flip Turn is an especially deadly move as Barraskewda can pivot out while massively damaging non-Water-immune checks like Swampert. Liquidation is Barraskewda's main STAB move, guaranteeing the OHKO on Tapu Koko and allowing Barraskewda to stay on the field while doing great damages. Aqua Jet offers revenge killing against boosted foes such as Volcarona and Garchomp. Barraskewda's coverage moves are mostly used as insurance against Water Absorb users like Excadrill and Desolate Land users such as Heatran. Close Combat is the best coverage option due to its high Base Power and ability to hit Heatran and Ferrothorn hard.</p> <p>Barraskewda is often paired with special powerhouses like Sheer Force Tapu Lele and Psychic Surge Azelf, which succeed versus Pokemon that check Barraskewda like Tapu Fini and Corviknight. The combination of their special prowess and Barraskewda's pivoting leads to deadly offensive cores. Barraskewda commonly finds itself on VoltTurn cores, synergizing well with Landorus-T and offensive Zapdos. Barraskewda also benefits from teammates that check Fire-types and cover its Desolate Land weakness like Terrakion and Garchomp, which can punish them by setting entry hazards. Since Barraskewda's main job as a pivot and revenge killer involves a lot of switching, it benefits from entry hazard removers and slow pivots. Defensive pivots such as Swampert and Landorus-T are able to preserve momentum and set up entry hazards, softening up foes. Other defensive Pokemon like Dauntless Shield Mew, Intimidate Corviknight, and Tapu Fini are also great partners because of their access to Defog and reliable recovery.</p> "

Instead of Queenly Majesty, Polteageist can opt for Adaptability or Magic Guard + Life Orb to further boost its offensive presence, but this makes it easier to revenge kill; thus, it requires further amount of support such as Psychic Terrain from Azelf to protect it from priority attacks, which can also amplify Polteageist's Stored Power. Will-O-Wisp is an option to cripple physical attackers, which lets Polteageist's teammates set up easier.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Mandibuzz, Zarude, and Hydreigon can shrug off all of Polteageist's attacks and threaten significant damage to it with their STAB attacks. The former two can even grab momentum in the process via U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Prankster Toxapex: Toxapex's Prankster-boosted Haze limits Polteageist's sweeping attempts and makes sure it won't take significant damage from an otherwise boosted Stored Power. Haze's higher amount of PP means it can't be PP-stalled by Shell Smash either.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn and Bulletproof Heatran can survive Poltegeist's boosted attacks comfortably and threaten it with Knock Off and Fire-type STAB moves, respectively. However, the former has to be cautious of Strength Sap variants, which can muscle past it eventually.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Chansey: The combination of their remarkable special bulk, typing, and reliable recovery let them consistently stop Polteageist from sweeping. Unaware variants of Chansey can be even harder to break through. However, both of them need Toxic to beat Polteageist.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Without Strength Sap or Giga Drain, Polteageist is unable to restore its Focus Sash after taking entry hazard damage, making it harder to set up and easier to revenge kill.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Surge Surfer Xurkitree as well as Choice Scarf users like Azelf and Latios can reliably outspeed even a boosted Polteageist.

        "description": "<p>Queenly Majesty Polteageist is a niche but dangerous setup sweeper: After a Shell Smash, it outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame and avoids being revenge killed by the metagame's common priority users such as Barraskewda, Dhelmise, and Triage Tapu Lele. Stored Power is its strongest attack after Shell Smash, powering through neutral foes like Tapu Fini and defensive Garchomp. Shadow Ball is the STAB move of choice and complements Stored Power to hit common Psychic-types such as Mew, Tapu Lele, and RegenVest Jirachi. Self-Destruct severely weakens Polteageist's specially defensive and Dark-type checks like Blissey and Zarude to open up a sweep for a fellow teammate and give them free entry into the field afterwards, which is crucial to keep up offensive momentum. Strength Sap can be used to reinstate Polteageist's Focus Sash or defeat weak physical attackers like Ferrothorn and defensive Landorus-T one-on-one. Giga Drain is its strongest option against Tapu Fini and RegenVest Swampert and can, in rare cases, restore it to full health for Focus Sash, but otherwise has limited use. Focus Sash allows for safe setup at full health, even against powerful attackers like Tapu Lele and Tapu Koko.</p> <p>Polteageist generally fits on hyper offense teams, so Pokemon commonly seen on these archetypes also make great teammates. Dedicated leads like Aerodactyl and Azelf can reliably set up Stealth Rock to chip down foes into Polteageist's KO range and deny opposing entry hazards with Taunt to preserve Polteageist's Focus Sash. Polteageist also appreciates further entry hazard control from teammates such as Regieleki and Choice Scarf Latios with their Rapid Spin and Defog, respectively. Volcarona enjoys Polteageist weakening common specially defensive Pokemon like Garchomp, Blissey, and RegenVest Swampert with boosted Stored Power + Self-Destruct. Polteagiest is utterly unable to make progress against Prankster Toxapex and Unaware Mandibuzz, even if they are heavily damaged; dedicated lures like Galvanize Kommo-o and teammates that can overwhelm them like Swords Dance Garchomp are necessary teammates. Wallbreakers like Sheer Force Tapu Lele, Swords Dance Garchomp, and Belly Drum or Galvanize Kommo-o can open up holes early-game for Polteageist to sweep more easily; they also either overwhelm or threaten all of Polteageist's checks in Blissey, Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn, and Dark-types like Hydreigon. Polteagiest can also still be outsped by fast Choice Scarf users such as Azelf, so careful scouting is required before setting up.</p> "

While Leftovers lets Runerigus avoid the 2HKO from Tapu Koko's Pixilate Facade, it can use Rocky Helmet to wear down opposing attackers or Heavy-Duty Boots to more reliably switch in through entry hazards.

With Choice Band and a Terrain-boosted Grassy Glide, Zarude can force out the majority of relevant wallbreakers, such as Tapu Koko and Azelf, as they risk getting OHKOed. U-turn capitalizes on the switches Zarude forces, bringing in offensive partners like Heatran. Power Whip is the strongest STAB move available, OHKOing or 2HKOing common defensive pivots like Swampert, Tapu Fini, Zapdos, and Toxapex. Darkest Lariat is a spammable STAB move that also bypasses Dauntless Shield boosts, scoring 2HKOs on Heatran, Mew, and Moltres. However, Close Combat is a strong alternative over either Power Whip or Darkest Lariat, allowing it to break through specific checks like Ferrothorn and Incineroar. An Adamant nature is preferred to augment the power of Zarude's attacks, notably having a better chance to OHKO Tapu Koko with Grassy Glide; however, Jolly is an option to outspeed Zapdos.</p> <p>Zarude provides valuable utility including priority, Terrain control, and passive recovery, making it a great fit on balance and bulky offense teams. As Zarude cannot switch into most attackers, a strong defensive core often helps bring it in safely. Zarude also handily beats Swampert and Tapu Fini, making it a great partner for a multitude of wallbreakers, such as Heatran, Zapdos, and Tapu Koko. In return, Zarude gives them good switch-in opportunities by using U-turn on the Flying-types it invites in, mainly Corviknight and Mandibuzz. Zarude appreciates any teammates that can set entry hazards, chipping down foes like Ferrothorn and Corviknight into OHKO or 2HKO range. Teammates carrying Rocky Helmet such as Corviknight and Swampert also provide chip damage, and they can notably punish offensive pivots such as Landorus-T and Cinderace freely clicking U-turn on Zarude. Lastly, teammates running Knock Off such as Tapu Fini and Toxapex are useful to remove opposing Rocky Helmet and Heavy-Duty Boots, respectively allowing Zarude to attack more freely and better chip walls—especially Flying-types—in combination with hazards.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Choice Band + Tough Claws Zarude is a fast and powerful wallbreaker that puts tremendous pressure on the opposing team. Darkest Lariat is its most consistent attack and 2HKOes most of the metagame, as bulky Dark-resistant foes are few and far between; it has the added benefit of bypassing Dauntless Shield. Power Whip is Zarude's strongest attack, securing the OHKO against offensive Garchomp and 2HKO against Toxapex, and provides important coverage against Tapu Fini. U-turn generates momentum against Zarude's few reliable checks such as Kommo-o and Mandibuzz; Mandibuzz, in particular, will be unable to use Roost and is susceptible to being worn down by repeated pivots. Close Combat secures the OHKO against Heatran and has a high chance to OHKO common Ferrothorn variants. Jolly is the preferred nature to reliably force out other fast offensive threats like Zapdos, Garchomp, and Tapu Lele, but Adamant still outspeeds fully invested base 90 Speed Pokemon, and it gets more favorable 2HKO odds against Ferrothorn and Skarmory.</p> <p>Choice Band + Tough Claws Zarude functions best on pivot-heavy balance and offense teams, which can provide it with multiple switch-in opportunities. It pairs especially well with specially-oriented pivots like Azelf and Tapu Koko, as they can each pivot on their checks and put the other in an advantageous position. Defensive pivots like Corviknight and Blissey can switch in when Zarude gets forced out, and they safely bring it in against slower wallbreakers like Zapdos and Garchomp. Zarude struggles against bulky Dark-resistant foes like Kommo-o and Mandibuzz, making Fairy-type wallbreakers like Tapu Lele and Tapu Koko excellent partners. Physically defensive Steel-types like Intimidate Corviknight and Regenerator Ferrothorn hold up decently well against Zarude, so it pairs well with Zygarde-10% and Zapdos, which blow through them. Zarude greatly appreciates entry hazard and Knock Off support to weaken its checks and take advantage of the high number of switches it forces. Because Zarude is heavily threatened by U-turn, it risks getting forced out and pivoted on by faster threats such as Azelf, Talonflame, and Tapu Koko; reliable answers to these threats that do not need a turn to recover, like Regenerator Blissey and Heatran, are strongly recommended. As Zarude lacks any form of recovery, it appreciates reliable entry hazard removal to keep it healthy.</p> "
