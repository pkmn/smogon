Ice Fang is another option that is weaker against Dragon-types but also hits Zapdos, Landorus-T, and Garchomp for more damage. Iron Tail over Behemoth Bash offers higher PP but has lower accuracy. Rest + Howl is an option to both threaten offensive foes and set up on passive foes, but it lacks coverage, and the lack of Sleep Talk makes Zamazenta-C very passive when asleep.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Mew comfortably sponges any attacks from Zamazenta-C and can threaten it with Will-O-Wisp or pivot into a revenge killer; Intimidate Corviknight can repeatedly switch into Zamazenta-C, even against Wild Charge, and pivot into a revenge killer; and Toxapex can eliminate Howl boosts, stall out Wild Charge, and burn it with Scald. All of them commonly run Rocky Helmet, which chips down Zamazenta-C very quickly.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos resists both of Zamazenta-C's STAB moves, and threatens it with a strong Thunder, which also comes with paralysis chance. However, it has to be aware of Ice Fang, which will 2HKO it after one Howl boost.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: It is easy to wear down Zamazenta-C, especially with special attacks. After it has been weakened, faster Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Choice Scarf Azelf can revenge kill it fairly easily. While it can opt to run Rest to stay healthy, doing so greatly hinders its offensive capabilities.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Common Fire-types like Volcarona, Cinderace, and Volcanion can all survive a hit and OHKO or severely damage Zamazenta-C in return, though the latter two can be OHKOed if Zamazenta-C is boosted.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Despite having high, well-rounded stats, Zamazenta-C has a very limited movepool and must run Rusted Shield and Dauntless Shield, severely limiting its viability; however, it still carves itself a niche in bulky teams, as its blend of offense and bulk offers a unique check to common wallbreakers like Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, Zarude, and Terrakion. Furthermore, Rusted Shield cannot be removed, so it is a nice deterrent to Trick users like Azelf and Dhelmise. Its Speed tier also puts it above key threats like Cinderace and Terrakion, making it annoying for offensive teams to handle. Close Combat is Zamazenta-C's strongest STAB move, allowing it to revenge kill Zarude and Terrakion, while also OHKOing Heatran and Blissey. Behemoth Bash notably hits Fairy-types, namely Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Bulu. Wild Charge is its best option against Water- and Flying-types like Tapu Fini, Toxapex, and Talonflame. Howl is Zamazenta-C's only Attack-boosting move, though its bulk usually allows it to boost multiple times. After one boost, it can 2HKO Swampert and Tapu Fini and OHKO Talonflame and Cinderace. Alternatively, running RestTalk with both STAB moves gives Zamazenta-C a source of recovery while alleviating its low PP thanks to Sleep Talk; this sacrifices its ability to boost or hit Tapu Fini, however. A Jolly nature is preferred so that Cinderace and Talonflame cannot revenge kill it.</p> <p>Zamazenta-C best fits on bulkier teams in need of a Pokemon to close out games, as it can clean up after its teammates have sufficiently weakened the opposing team. Its combination of bulk, high Speed, and resistance or neutrality to most priority attacks makes it difficult for offensive teams to revenge kill reliably. It appreciates Wish and Heal Bell support on these teams, notably from Vaporeon, allowing it to come in multiple times throughout a game. To further alleviate Zamazenta-C's lack of recovery, teammates that can bring in Zamazenta-C safely are useful, such as Blissey, Jirachi, and Vaporeon; they also invite in Pokemon like Heatran, Terrakion, and Tapu Koko, all of which Zamazenta-C can force out. It also greatly appreciates entry hazards support from setters like Swampert and Garchomp, which let it rack up chip damage on switches that it forces. Furthermore, these setters can threaten Fire-types like Volcarona and Cinderace, as well as Zapdos, which force out Zamazenta-C. Lastly, it appreciates teammates that can wear down Corviknight and Dauntless Shield Mew, such as Zygarde-10% and Pixilate Tapu Koko, so that it can clean up more easily late-game.</p>"

Rock-type coverage in either Rock Tomb or Rock Slide can be used—with the former also providing utility for its team—to heavily damage other Desolate Land users like Volcarona and Moltres, though it has no other use outside of it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Even with Assault Vest, offensive Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zapdos can significantly damage Blastoise with their STAB attacks. They can even gain momentum on a forced switch with Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Zarude, Dhelmise, and Tapu Bulu can take on any of Blastoise's attacks and threaten it out with their super effective STAB moves. Moreover, Zarude can gain momentum on it via U-turn, Dhelmise can spinblock against it, and Tapu Bulu can use it as setup fodder thanks to its immunity to Dragon Tail.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Explosive physical wallbreakers like Choice Band Galarian Zapdos, Terrakion, and Zygarde-10% can take advantage of Blastoise's weaker Defense to threaten it easily.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: As Blastoise solely relies on Regenerator for recovery, any chip damage can rack up quickly and prove to be very detrimental. Even with Rapid Spin, its grounded nature and inability to hold Heavy-Duty Boots means it is a pivot that gets overwhelmed quickly by entry hazards. Flip Turn is also punished by Rocky Helmet from Pokemon like Corviknight and Skarmory, which can run Wandering Spirit to prevent Blastoise from recovering HP with Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Water-Immune Pokemon</strong>: Desolate Land Volcarona and Moltres and Water Absorb users like Hippowdon, Landorus-T, and Palossand can prevent Blastoise from pivoting freely with Flip Turn and don't fear any of its attacks as well. Palossand can also reliably set up Stealth Rock by spinblocking it.</p>",

The combination of Flip Turn and Regenerator makes it a solid defensive pivot, taking advantage of its Assault Vest-boosted bulk to switch into special attackers like Heatran, Inteleon, and Volcarona. Earthquake threatens common Desolate Land users like Heatran, Cinderace, and Volcanion that would otherwise stop Blastoise from pivoting freely with Flip Turn. Dragon Tail phazes out setup sweepers like Mew, Galarian Moltres, Salamence, and Kommo-o that try to exploit its passivity, even providing a super effective hit for the latter two. Dragon Tail also works well with Flip Turn; Dragon Tail can bring in an undesired foe into the field and then force them to switch out, allowing Blastoise to gain momentum with Flip Turn afterwards. Minimum Speed investment lets Blastoise have the slowest possible Flip Turn, underspeeding opposing pivots like Mandibuzz and Milotic.</p> <p>Blastoise finds a place in bulky offense teams that appreciate its unique role compression. Offensive teammates like Desolate Land Heatran, Primordial Sea Zapdos, and Choice Band Terrakion appreciate Blastoise bringing them in safely via Flip Turn into foes like Swampert, Tapu Fini, and Ferrothorn, respectively. Blastoise also relieves them of entry hazard damage to let them constantly enter the field and pressure the opposing team and grants Zapdos more freedom to forgo Heavy-Duty Boots and run an offensive item like Magnet or Sharp Beak. As one of the few viable spinners, Blastoise has excellent synergy with Spikes setters like Skarmory and Mew. Due to Blastoise's reliance on Assault Vest, Knock Off absorbers like Kommo-o and the aforementioned Skarmory make great teammates. Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T can help dissuade Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zapdos from using Volt Switch, with the latter also forming a VoltTurn core with Blastoise. Similarly, Corviknight can form a VoltTurn core with it and also help check Grass-types like Zarude, Dhelmise, and Tapu Bulu; in return, Blastoise deals with Fire-types like Heatran, Chandelure, and Volcarona. Landorus-T and Corviknight are good secondary entry hazard removers, preventing Blastoise from getting overwhelmed by entry hazards itself.</p>"

Toxic Spikes exerts tremendous pressure on opposing teams, quickly wearing down grounded offensive attackers and putting extra strain on walls. Stealth Rock is an option, but given the much more limited distribution of Toxic Spikes, it is generally easier to have a teammate supply it. Taunt and Super Fang further pressure opposing defensive cores, reliably reducing their health even with no Attack investment and denying recovery and Defog from foes like Corviknight and Mandibuzz. Poison Fang is an option in either of the last two slots to hit Levitate Tapu Koko and poison foes immune to Toxic Spikes, but the pressure exerted by Taunt + Super Fang is generally preferred. Black Sludge is the preferred item to increase Nidoqueen's longevity, but Rocky Helmet can be used to further accumulate chip damage on opponents and is especially punishing against opposing U-turn users. 36 Speed EVs allow Nidoqueen to outpace Mandibuzz so that it can deny its Defog and Roost.</p> <p>Nidoqueen is an excellent addition to balance teams looking to win the entry hazard war and shore up weaknesses to Terrakion and Tapu Koko.

Powerful wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos and Zarude appreciate Nidoqueen weakening opposing walls with Super Fang and generally inflicting chip damage on the opposing team. Nidoqueen is unable to check some common physical attackers like Barraskewda and Zarude, so it needs other physically defensive teammates like Kommo-o to cover these threats. Nidoqueen is also vulnerable to Ground-types like Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Zygarde-10%, so teammates that frustrate them like Zarude and Dauntless Shield Mew are encouraged.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Chansey serves both as a special wall and a slow pivot thanks to its titanic, Eviolite-boosted special bulk and Teleport. With Magic Guard, it avoids passive damage from both entry hazards and status moves like Toxic and, paired with Soft-Boiled, ensures that Chansey can switch into and wall dangerous foes like Primordial Sea Inteleon and Zapdos. Seismic Toss is Chansey's preferred attack, as the fixed damage is Chansey's best option to deal direct damage. There are a number of options for Chansey's last moveslot based on team need and preference. Toxic quickly wears down other walls and setup sweepers. Thunder Wave cripples opposing fast offensive threats, helping your own team outspeed and KO them. Stealth Rock provides passive damage and takes advantage of free turns; since all common entry hazard removers can switch into Chansey, it is a generally poor setter, but can be better than nothing. A Bold nature and maximum investment in Defense and HP, alongside the boost from Eviolite, helps Chansey's naturally low physical bulk and sets it apart from Blissey.</p> <p>Chansey easily fits on bulky offense and balance teams, as it can comfortably wall most special attackers and still generate momentum for its teammates. It pairs well with offensively-oriented teammates who are unable to take hits from faster special attackers and appreciate its ability to pivot them in with Teleport, such as Garchomp, Terrakion, and Galarian Zapdos. Even when physically invested, Chansey prefers not to take physical attacks and likes having teammates like Dauntless Shield Mew and Intimidate Corviknight that can withstand them instead. It also appreciates Pokemon that can easily absorb Knock Off, such as Tapu Fini, in order to preserve its Eviolite. In general, teams that have poor entry hazard control appreciate Magic Guard Chansey as a pivot, since it ignores entry hazard damage. Lastly, Chansey's ability to function as a bulky pivot without Regenerator leaves both slots available for the rest of the team, making it easier to fit offensive Regenerator users like Garchomp.</p>"

Flip Turn + Wish enables Vaporeon to avoid being a momentum sink as it passes a Wish to teammates like Tapu Lele, Zygarde-C, and Dauntless Shield Kommo-o, which would otherwise have a difficult time staying healthy over the course of a battle. Protect allows Vaporeon to reliably heal itself with Wish if needed, as well as scout against Choice-locked users, particularly those running Trick such as Azelf. Heal Bell is a great option that turns Vaporeon into a cleric, clearing status for offensive partners like Garchomp and Zapdos. Scald helps Vaporeon deal more damage to Talonflame while also threatening to burn physical attackers and Regenerator Pokemon trying to capitalize on a Wish pass or Heal Bell, and Haze prevents Vaporeon from being setup fodder. If the utility of the other moves is deemed unnecessary, Toxic can be used to poison opposing Regenerator Pokemon like Swampert and Tapu Fini. Heavy-Duty Boots ensures that Vaporeon can avoid entry hazard damage and keep itself healthy enough to avoid having to use Wish to heal itself, but Leftovers can be used to supplement Regenerator recovery. Minimum Speed investment makes it so Vaporeon can Flip Turn as slowly as possible, increasing the odds that it can safely pass a Wish to its team.</p> <p>Vaporeon primarily excels on balance teams that appreciate its services as a Wish passer. Power Construct Zygarde-10% benefits immensely from Heal Bell variants shortening its Rest duration post-transformation and providing it with Wish support. The aforementioned Kommo-o is able to forgo Regenerator for Dauntless Shield, relying on Vaporeon to keep it healthy throughout a battle. Kommo-o is also an excellent check to Grass-types like Zarude, Dhelmise, and Tapu Bulu, which would otherwise threaten Vaporeon. Wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos, Adaptability Zygarde-10%, and Zarude appreciate Vaporeon's ability to alleviate the effects of passive damage and status for them. Because Vaporeon checks Water-type Pokemon like Barraskewda, Inteleon, and Volcanion, Desolate Land users weak to them, such as Heatran and Moltres, are great teammates. Vaporeon is deadweight against common Desolate Land users like Volcarona, Heatran, and Cinderace as it cannot use Flip Turn against them, so Fire-resistant Pokemon like Garchomp and Primordial Sea Zapdos make excellent partners. Additionally, entry hazard removal from Dhelmise and Corviknight can prevent Vaporeon from being worn down if it loses its Heavy-Duty Boots.</p>"

Zapdos's EVs can vary significantly, mostly depending on what it wants to outspeed. As mentioned above, 72 Speed EVs allows Zapdos to outspeed Modest maximum Speed investment Heatran, allowing Zapdos to either pivot out via U-turn or deal a large amount damage with Weather Ball, while 56 Speed EVs allow Zapdos to outspeed Adamant Tapu Bulu and then KO it with Hurricane. Maximum Speed investment can also be run on Zapdos to help its team's matchup against Tapu Lele and Adamant Zarude. Additionally, Zapdos can opt to run a more defensive spread to better fit into its role as a check to physical attackers such as Talonflame. Defog can also be run on Zapdos, but it is usually not a good option, as Zapdos already struggles with fitting all of the moves it wants.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey, one of the tier's most common special walls, is very problematic for Zapdos, as it takes very little damage from both Hurricane and Thunder. This means that without an extreme amount of luck, Zapdos is never able to break it.</p> <p><strong>Desolate Land Users</strong>: Many Desolate Land users are able to comfortably switch in on Zapdos, taking its rain away and reducing the accuracy of its STAB attacks to 50% while also changing Weather Ball from a super effective hit to a resisted one.</p> <p><strong>RegenVest</strong>: Pokemon holding Assault Vest are difficult for Zapdos to break, as they take very little damage from Zapdos's attacks and can heal themselves easily thanks to Regenerator.

Weather Ball is another attacking option, most notably hitting Desolate Land Heatran for significant damage. U-turn allows Zapdos to pivot out on a predicted switch to a counter, which is a great trait to have in a momentum-reliant tier like AAA and allows it to still make progress against teams with reliable answers to it. Roost gives Zapdos significant longevity and allows it to absorb hits over the course of a longer battle. Zapdos's EVs are very customizable and can be changed depending on what a team needs it to do. The given spread maximizes Zapdos's bulk and power while still outspeeding Modest Heatran.</p> <p>Zapdos can fit on many different team archetypes because of its ability to take neutral hits while threatening powerful attacks back. If Zapdos is not running Weather Ball, it is very weak to Desolate Land users such as Heatran, as it resists Hurricane and takes neutral damage from Thunder, as well as lowering the accuracy of both of those moves to 50% due to the harsh sun. Thus, Zapdos appreciates Pokemon such as Assault Vest Silvally-Dragon that can switch in on the Fire-types safely and then pivot out. Zapdos pairs very well with Pokemon that can threaten specially defensive Pokemon such as Blissey and Assault Vest Swampert that take neutral damage from its STAB attacks. Good partners for this include Zarude and Terrakion. These attackers pair very well with U-turn, as they are able to take advantage of the momentum Zapdos creates.

In addition, it can chip its switch-ins with U-turn when a KO isn't an option. With Throat Chop, Galarian Zapdos is even able to 2HKO would-be counters like Doublade and Runerigus. Thunderous Kick is an alternative to Throat Chop with built-in wallbreaking power due to the Defense drops, and it also avoids the recoil and self-inflicted negative stat stage changes from Brave Bird and Close Combat.

Brave Bird is a strong Flying-type STAB move that has good neutral coverage and 2HKOes common defensive staples such as Tapu Fini, Swampert, and Mandibuzz. Thunderous Kick works particularly well in conjunction with Brave Bird, hitting Steel-types such as Heatran and Corviknight that resist Brave Bird; it also drops the foe's Defense, easing predictions, and lets Galarian Zapdos KO physically defensive Tapu Fini after Stealth Rock by following up Thunderous Kick with Brave Bird. Thunderous Kick is also good at wearing down Dauntless Shield users that can't reliably threaten Galarian Zapdos such as Hippowdon and Skarmory lacking Brave Bird. U-turn allows Galarian Zapdos to keep momentum even against its checks such as Zapdos and Dauntless Shield Mew, while chipping them a bit. It also severely damages Mew after a Defense drop, forcing it to recover health. Taunt is a neat option to shut down Pokemon such as Corviknight and Mew that would try to heal or burn Galarian Zapdos with Will-O-Wisp, allowing it to wear them down through the course of a game; however, Taunt is risky because the opponent might use Brave Bird or Ice Beam instead. Close Combat is another option to pass through Flash Fire Corviknight easily, as well as OHKOing some threats such as Ferrothorn or physically defensive Heatran that Thunderous Kick doesn't KO.

Mew can also pull off a wide range of offensive sets—No Guard + Zap Cannon, Dragon Dance + Guts + Facade, Dragon Dance + Tough Claws—that are all generally outclassed by other users, but can have a nice surprise factor on Mew. Mew is also one of the better dedicated weather or Terrain setters, but these teams are generally inconsistent. On stall teams, Mew can run both Roost and Recover for better longevity at the cost of being passive.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Defensive Mew sets heavily rely on Will-O-Wisp to check physical attackers, making them a poor check to Cinderace, Talonflame, and Entei.</p> <p><strong>Zarude and Dhelmise</strong>: Zarude and Dhelmise are powerful physical attackers that can threaten Mew with their super effective STAB options. Additionally, Zarude also ignores Dauntless Shield and Cosmic Power boosts thanks to Darkest Lariat. However, they fear switching into Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Pivoting Attackers</strong>: Galarian Zapdos and Barraskewda are hard for Mew to check, as they do respectable damage while pivoting, wearing it down.</p>",

      "Dauntless Shield": {
        "description": "<p>Dauntless Shield Mew is one of the sturdiest physical walls in the game. With its good natural bulk and Dauntless Shield, it can reliably switch into dangerous physical wallbreakers like Terrakion and Zygarde-10% and threaten them with a burn. Ice Beam allows Mew to hit Garchomp, Zygarde-10%, and Landorus-T hard, while Body Press deals more consistent damage and nails targets like Ferrothorn and Terrakion. Will-O-Wisp allows it to force out most physical attackers; Spikes turns Mew into a reliable entry hazards setter. The last moveslot is usually a pivoting move; Teleport allows it to bring in a teammate safely without being blocked by Ground-types, while Volt Switch deals chip damage and is not shut down by Taunt. U-turn is also an other option to avoid Taunt.</p> <p>Mew is a solid choice for any playstyle that is looking to patch up a weakness to strong physical wallbreakers. Frail attackers that have a hard time getting in like Barraskewda, Azelf, and Tapu Lele appreciate Mew getting them in safely with a slow pivot. Strong Defoggers like Corviknight and Tapu Fini are recommended to ease Mew's pivoting. Mew is also worse at checking Fire-types due to their immunity to Will-O-Wisp; Primordial Sea Zapdos makes a great partner to cover that weakness. Mew is also unable to check strong Dark- and Ghost-types like Zarude and Dhelmise, so partners like Corviknight that can switch into those are helpful.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf Regenerator": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its high natural bulk, Choice Scarf Regenerator Mew is a fantastic pivot and utility check to a wide range of threats like Terrakion, Zygarde-10%, and Tapu Lele. Mew can be switched in aggressively and rely on pivoting and Regenerator to stay healthy, preserving momentum for its team. For its pivoting move, U-turn has no immunities, but Flip Turn can pressure some key threats like Terrakion more if they try to stay in. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers, and Trick frustrates a bulky foe by giving them its Choice Scarf. Psychic allows it to actually do damage when needed, especially cleaning up weakened fast threats late-game, while Gunk Shot threatens Fairy-types like Tapu Lele and Tapu Koko. Mew's Speed investment allows it to outspeed Barraskewda while still having as much physical bulk as possible.</p> <p>Mew is useful on offensive teams to check a wide range of physical threats while maintaining momentum. It is especially potent against Choice Band users, as it is rarely OHKOed by any move, and it can then pivot to a proper check that resists the attack while recovering HP with Regenerator. Since Mew is efficient at pivoting, it pairs well with powerful wallbreakers like Tapu Lele and Terrakion, which enjoy the free turns it generates. Mew does struggle to check Fire-types, as they are immune to Will-O-Wisp and are often immune to Flip Turn with Desolate Land, so strong answers to them like Primordial Sea Zapdos make great partners. Mew can also be overwhelmed by repeated strong attacks, since it is reliant on Regenerator to recover, so other bulky switch-ins like Tapu Fini and Jirachi make good partners as well.</p>"

      "Cosmic Power": {
        "description": "<p>Cosmic Power Mew is a bulky wincon with Roost that can be extremely difficult to KO, allowing it to set up multiple times. Magic Guard provides a complete immunity to Toxic damage, such as from Toxic Spikes and Silvally's Poison Fang, and allows it to run Life Orb without a drawback. Cosmic Power boots its considerable bulk while powering up Stored Power and Body Press. Psychic is an other option to beat Prankster Toxapex, which otherwise walls Mew. Maximum physical bulk makes setup easier while also powering up Body Press.</p> <p>Cosmic Power Mew is commonly found on hyper offense teams, or as the wincon on bulky teams. Most of the support Mew needs is removing specific hard counters, after which it sweeps relatively reliably. Unaware users and Prankster Toxapex—if Mew lacks Psychic—stop it, so lures like Psychic Volcarona make great partners. Zarude ignores Defense boosts with Darkest Lariat, with Pokemon like Corviknight providing adequate counterplay. Tapu Fini can answer Dragon Tail users like defensive Garchomp.</p>"

      "Unaware Wall": {
        "description": "<p>Mew is a solid Unaware wall thanks to its good physical bulk, lack of common weaknesses, Foul Play, and wide utility movepool including reliable recovery. It can consistently check physical setup sweepers such as Garchomp, Talonflame, and Triage Kommo-o, as well as a few special threats like Triage Tapu Lele. Foul Play takes advantage of Mew's unpredictability, punishing reckless setup from foes that do not expect Unaware. Will-O-Wisp permanently debilitates physical attackers that stay in and provides chip damage against opposing walls. Spikes is preferred in the last moveslot to take advantage of the free turns Mew generates and accrue additional chip damage. U-turn and Volt Switch allow Mew to instead generate momentum; U-turn has the advantage of being unblockable via immunities, while Volt Switch avoids contact effects like Rocky Helmet damage. Heavy-Duty Boots is the preferred item to reliably switch in through entry hazards, especially as Spikes variants pair poorly with Defog support; Leftovers is an option with reliable entry hazard control. Since Unaware Mew forgoes a Defense-boosting ability, it needs maximum Defense investment to withstand opposing wallbreakers and sweepers.</p> <p>Unaware Mew fits best on bulky and balance teams that appreciate its role compression and ability to deter opposing setup; pivoting variants can still find a home on more offensive teams, however. While Unaware Mew effectively checks dangerous threats like Swords Dance Garchomp and Talonflame, it is easily overwhelmed by powerful wallbreakers like Choice Band Terrakion, Dhelmise, and especially its nemesis, Zarude; bulky physical walls like Intimidate Corviknight and Dauntless Shield Hippowdon are strongly recommended to cover its weakness to standard wallbreakers. Mew is also vulnerable to opposing pivots like Barraskewda and Cinderace, as they deny it a chance to recover by switching to some foe that forces Mew out; Regenerator Kommo-o effectively checks most common pivoting wallbreakers. If forgoing Heavy-Duty Boots, Mew requires reliable entry hazard support from Corviknight or Tapu Fini to avoid being 2HKOed as it switches in. Since Mew relies on Will-O-Wisp to neutralize physical attackers, it can struggle against Cinderace, Entei, and a well-played Talonflame; a reliable secondary answer to these threats like Primordial Sea Zapdos is encouraged. Since Mew cannot do meaningful damage to special attackers, reliable special walls like Blissey and RegenVest Jirachi make great teammates.</p>"

Heavy-Duty Boots can be used instead of Leftovers to make Umbreon less reliant on entry hazard removal, but the loss of recovery makes it difficult to check offensive foes as easily. Moonlight is an option that gives immediate recovery, but doesn't have much PP.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Pixilate and Magic Guard Tapu Koko can switch into Umbreon and KO it after minimal chip damage; however, the former must be wary of Toxic before its Flame Orb activates. Other Fairy-types like Tapu Lele and Togekiss threaten Umbreon with their respective Fairy STAB attacks, with the former OHKOing it with Sheer Force-boosted Moonblast. Just like Pixilate Tapu Koko, neither of them want to switch into Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Trick Users</strong>: Umbreon struggles to provide much defensive utility if it is tricked a Choice item by Pokemon like Tapu Fini, Mew, and Azelf, so Foul Play and Protect should be used strategically to prevent this from happening.</p> <p><strong>Offensive pressure</strong>: While Umbreon is able to win one-on-ones against certain setup sweepers, these sequences can cost a lot of PP, leaving it without many tools to further serve as a physical wall. Notable examples are common wallbreakers like Adaptability Zygarde-10% and setup sweepers like Talonflame which are happy to repeatedly attack Umbreon and force it to use up Wish PP.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Umbreon is a decent Wish passer and cleric that checks various setup sweepers like Cosmic Power Mew and Tapu Bulu for its teammates. Unaware + Foul Play gives Umbreon a way to reliably win the one-on-one against common Swords Dance users like Dhelmise, Garchomp, and Talonflame; most notably, it can even beat Belly Drum Kommo-o. Wish + Protect is Umbreon's main form of recovery and makes it able to scout Choice-locked foes like Azelf, Terrakion, and Barraskewda before switching to a check. While most teams prefer Heal Bell support, especially since there are few viable clerics, Toxic is good at weakening defensive foes like Regenerator Swampert and Tapu Fini. Leftovers gives passive recovery and has good synergy with Protect. Maximum Defense investment is recommended to more easily tank physical attacks like Drain Punch, Close Combat, and Earthquake from Kommo-o, Tapu Bulu, and Garchomp, respectively.</p> <p>Umbreon's lack of pivoting move and defensive utility past its niche land it exclusively on semi-stall and stall teams. Pokemon without reliable recovery options like Sheer Force Tapu Lele, Galarian Zapdos, and Swords Dance users like Garchomp and Dhelmise are wallbreakers who greatly benefit from Umbreon's Wish passing and status relief. Regenerator Kommo-o sets Stealth Rock, switches into U-turn, and tanks powerful attacks from Pokemon like Barraskewda and Terrakion, while Umbreon covers for its weakness to Psychic-type attacks from users like Psychic Surge Azelf and Alakazam. Other common defensive Pokemon like Corviknight, Chansey, and Ferrothorn give Defog support, check special attackers, and set entry hazards, respectively, while Umbreon ensures that they don't become setup fodder. Since Umbreon matches up poorly into the most common specially attacking threats like Tapu Lele and Primal Weather users, Jirachi and Chansey are coveted teammates. Nidoqueen pairs exceptionally well with Umbreon by covering for its weakness to Pokemon like Terrakion and Tapu Koko; it also pressures foes with Toxic Spikes. Because Umbreon is prone to being PP stalled out of Wish, it also relies on the aforementioned defensive Pokemon to help it wall and chip foes. Regenerator Doublade and Runerigus are niche but synergistic partners that check particularly strong Fighting-types like Tough Claws Galarian Zapdos and Adaptability Terrakion to relieve pressure on Umbreon.</p>"

Toxic is useful for wearing down setup sweepers and walls and punishing Pokemon that switch into Scizor, like Kommo-o and Swampert. Defog can be used instead for team utility, though Scizor struggles to punish most common entry hazard setters.

Close Combat is Heracross's primary attack and capitalizes on the lack of Ghost-types in the AAA metagame. Megahorn is a powerful tool to beat Dauntless Shield Mew, a feat most other physical breakers fail to accomplish, and other Psychic-types like Slowbro and Latias. Knock Off removes items from switch-ins such as Dauntless Shield Hippowdon and Intimidate Corviknight, making them easier to chip with entry hazard damage. The last moveslot is very situational, as Heracross usually just fires off powerful Close Combats. Spikes is an option to punish switches to a reliable check such as Dauntless Shield Hippowdon; alternatively, Focus Punch 2HKOes Corviknight on the switch and forces a lose-lose situation: Roost risks being OHKOed by a second Focus Punch, while Brave Bird or switching out leaves Corviknight at low health and unable to check physical attackers. The given EV spread maximizes Heracross's power and Speed, and an Adamant nature allows better rolls to 2HKO the likes of Landorus-T.</p> <p>Heracross fits best on balance teams that can bring it on the field often to wallbreak.

Brave Bird is an alternative that hits foes such as Dhelmise, Tapu Bulu, and Galarian Zapdos harder. Skarmory usually finds ample opportunities to set multiple layers of Spikes throughout a game to wear down the opposing team. Roost helps Skarmory stay healthy to continuously check threats like Zarude and Garchomp. Whirlwind prevents setup sweepers from exploiting Skarmory's passivity and also synergizes well with Spikes. Iron Defense is an option on Body Press sets that still checks setup sweepers and also makes Skarmory less passive. Another option is Toxic, which helps wear down both passive foes like Mandibuzz and setup sweepers like Dhelmise. Leftovers gives Skarmory extra recovery, while Rocky Helmet is an option that punishes contact moves. Skarmory can run several different abilities. Dauntless Shield maximizes Skarmory's defensive capabilities and Body Press damage. Wandering Spirit, especially combined with Rocky Helmet, deters U-turn and Flip Turn from Regenerator pivots such as Swampert and Landorus-T, and also lets Skarmory serve as an emergency check to sweepers that heavily rely on their ability such Magic Guard Talonflame and Triage Tapu Lele. Flash Fire negates one of its weakness and allows it to surprise dangerous Fire-type such as Volcarona and Desolate Land Heatran with Brave Bird and Body Press, respectively. It also allows Skarmory to check the plethora of physical Fire-types like Talonflame and Cinderace that can be hard to account for otherwise.</p> <p>Skarmory's ability to set Spikes make it a better fit on stall teams compared to Corviknight, in particular entry hazard stack teams. Powerful offensive threats like Tapu Lele and Terrakion appreciate Spikes to nab more KOs. Offensive threats with a pivot move like Tapu Koko and Barraskewda can also rack up Spikes damage while still keeping offensive momentum by forcing additional switches. Heatran can set entry hazards alongside Skarmory, threaten to eliminate entry hazard removers with Magma Storm and Taunt. In return, Skarmory can cover for Heatran's weakness to Ground, and Dauntless Shield variants can also handle dangerous Fighting-types like Terrakion. Many Ground-type Pokemon also make for good partners, as they can take on Electric attacks and set Stealth Rock. Swampert and Garchomp are notable partners thanks to their resistance to Fire. Special walls are needed, as Skarmory invites many special attackers in when it set Spikes. Blissey forms the famous SkarmBliss core, taking on dangerous special threats like Zapdos and Sheer Force Tapu Lele while regaining momentum with Teleport while Skarmory handles strong physical attacks that Blissey struggles against. Pixilate Tapu Koko is one of the most dangerous physical threats that Skarmory can't properly handle regardless of its ability choice, so it's vital to have a teammate that answers it such as Ferrothorn or Nidoqueen. Without Dauntless Shield, strong physical wallbreakers like Terrakion can 2HKO Skarmory, which partners like Mew and Palossand can deal with. Physical Fire-types such as Cinderace and Talonflame also pose a threat should it forgo Flash Fire, making Zapdos and the aforementioned Swampert great teammates.</p>"

Unaware can also be used in place of other abilities to catch setup sweepers by surprise, especially when used with Counter.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Given Blissey's abysmal Defense stat, many physical attackers like Talonflame and Pixilate Tapu Koko can easily 2HKO Blissey, while Terrakion, Cinderace, and Barraskewda can OHKO it with a Fighting-type move. They cannot directly switch into Blissey however, as they might get crippled by Toxic or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Trick</strong>: Pokemon carrying Knock Off, such as Tapu Fini and Toxapex, can remove Blissey's item, which is vital to keeping Blissey healthy and avoiding 2HKOs from powerful attackers like Inteleon. Others carrying Trick, such as Azelf and Chandelure, can cripple Blissey by locking it into one move.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Volcarona that use Magic Guard with setup are able to take advantage of Blissey's natural passivity, making them much more difficult to deal with.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: With the combination of Magma Storm and Taunt, Heatran can trap Blissey on the switch and deny its recovery if it's not running Shed Shell.</p>",

Utilizing Regenerator, Blissey functions as a long-lasting special wall and offset its natural passivity with frequent pivoting. Seismic Toss is Blissey's only attacking option and allows it to avoid being completely crippled by Taunt. Soft-Boiled provides Blissey with instant recovery and can help stall out opponents, although the Regenerator set usually prefers to recover health by pivoting. Teleport allows Blissey to slow pivot to bring in other team members that can deal with the present threat and has excellent synergy with Regenerator, allowing it to survive late into matches and spend fewer turns recovering. Blissey's 4th move slot is flexible and can be filled according to team needs. Toxic is useful to chip down switch-ins, while Thunder Wave cripples attackers such as Tapu Lele. Heal Bell provides cleric support to bulkier teams; however, this leads to Blissey being even more passive. Maximum HP and Defense EVs allow Blissey to improve its poor physical bulk, while a Calm nature improves the damage rolls from prominent special attackers such as Desolate Land Chandelure and Primordial Sea Primarina.</p> <p>Blissey fits well on balance and bulky offense teams that benefit from its ability to check special attackers and pivot with slow Teleports. Frail offensive Pokemon such as Terrakion, Barraskewda, and Cinderace enjoy having Blissey as a teammate due to its ability to switch into special revenge killers including Triage Tapu Lele, as well as special Primordial Weather users such as Heatran and Zapdos. Blissey is very vulnerable to strong physical attackers such as Terrakion, Zarude, and Barraskewda; Corviknight and Tapu Fini are able to sponge physical attacks aimed at Blissey. It also struggles to properly deal with special pivots like Zapdos, Azelf, and Tapu Koko that are able to repeatedly bring in these powerful physical attackers. Blissey struggles to deal with Mold Breaker Heatran despite its role as a special wall because of Heatran's access to Taunt, which cripples Blissey; Blissey likes having secondary switch-ins such as Swampert on its teams to handle these threats. Blissey rarely beats Pokemon itself and can struggle with setup sweepers, so it appreciates having priority users such as Zarude and Tapu Lele on its team to pivot into.</p>"

Magic Guard ignores damage from both entry hazards and status effects, and Leftovers gives it passive recovery to increase its longevity against strong special attackers, differentiating it from Chansey by not being reliant on Eviolite. Shed Shell is an option to switch out of trappers like Heatran. Soft-Boiled serves to give Blissey an immediate option for recovery and allows it to comfortably switch into special attackers like Primordial Sea Zapdos. Seismic Toss is Blissey's main method of dealing direct damage, taking advantage of the move's fixed damage output. Shadow Ball can also be used to hit Substitute Chandelure, which would otherwise set up on Blissey, but is otherwise outclassed by Seismic Toss. Blissey's fourth slot can be filled with different status moves based on your team's needs. Toxic pressures other walls and setup sweepers. Thunder Wave can hinder attempts by opposing sweepers such as Volcarona to set up, as well as cripple other Magic Guard users who are unaffected by Toxic. While Blissey isn't an ideal Stealth Rock setter due to poor matchups against common entry hazard removers, it is able to run the move if needed. Counter is a niche pick that allows Blissey to catch physical attackers by surprise; even relatively weak hits like U-turn can do big damage thanks to Blissey's titanic HP and miniscule Defense. A Sassy nature further increases Blissey's already enormous special bulk, allowing it to avoid being 2HKOed by powerful special threats like Primordial Sea Inteleon, while reducing its Speed to make it a slower pivot.</p> <p>Blissey fits well on bulky offense and balance teams thanks to its ability to switch into special attacking threats and pivot in its own team's strong attackers. It is appreciated as a teammate by more offensive Pokemon, such as Tapu Koko, Galarian Zapdos, and Garchomp, who have trouble switching into opposing specially offensive threats and make use of Blissey's utility as a pivot to get in safely. Blissey likes to be paired with other defensive Pokemon that can take strong physical attacks or absorb Psyshock from special attackers such as Azelf and Latios that Blissey would otherwise struggle with, like RegenVest Jirachi and Dauntless Shield Mew, to make up for its own lack of physical bulk. Magic Guard makes it a good pivot for teams without proper entry hazard removal or clerics thanks to ignoring all forms of passive damage. Magic Guard Blissey leaves both Regenerator slots free for its teammates, allowing greater flexibility in bringing offensive Regenerator users like Garchomp.</p>"

Recoil free Flare Blitz lets Entei force out common defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight and Jirachi, as well as common Grass-type Pokemon such as Zarude and Dhelmise. Entei’s Fire typing allows it to offensively check common Triage Pokemon such as Togekiss and Tapu Bulu, as it resists Draining Kiss and Horn Leech. Stomping Tantrum allows Entei to threaten Electric- and Fire-type Pokemon such as Primordial Sea Tapu Koko and opposing Entei. Extreme Speed allows Entei to KO weakened fast offensive threats such as Barraskewda and Zygarde-10%. Toxic is used to chip down defensive Pokemon such as Swampert and Tapu Fini, who otherwise take little damage from Entei’s attacks. Toxic has extra synergy with Stomping Tantrum, as if Toxic fails, Stomping Tantrum is doubled in power next turn, which is particularly valuable against Toxapex. Stone Edge can be run over Stomping Tantrum to hit Zapdos and Talonflame. An Adamant nature is used to take advantage of Entei’s high Attack stat while still outspeeding most defensive threats. If using Stone Edge, a Jolly nature can be run in order to Speed tie Zapdos.</p> <p>Entei can fit on most teams, but works best on balance and bulky offense teams. Entei appreciates Pokemon such as Zapdos and Tapu Koko that can force out checks like Toxapex. Entei pairs well with Terrakion and Zarude, as it can threaten out Corviknight for them, and in return they pressure Swampert, one of Entei’s most reliable checks. Primordial Sea users like Zapdos and Barraskewda threaten Entei tremendously, so reliable revenge killers and switch-ins like Tapu Fini make great teammates. Entei pairs well with Pokemon who can provide entry hazard support such as Swampert, helping Entei wear down its checks faster. Entei also appreciates Electric-type Pokemon such as Tapu Koko who can force out bulky Water-types and Flash Fire Corviknight who commonly switch in on Entei.

Like them, it can still check offensive threats like Cinderace and Barraskewda. Substitute takes advantage of passive foes like Blissey, Mew, and Ferrothorn, keeping Suicune healthy by blocking their status moves like Toxic and Leech Seed and keeping its Leftovers safe from Knock Off. This also makes Suicune harder to revenge kill and stops Trick users like Azelf and Latios from neutralizing it with a Choice item. Scald is the STAB move of choice to debilitate checks, like Ferrothorn and non-Magic Guard Chansey, and dissuade physical attackers like Zarude and Zygarde-10% from switching in with burns.

Roar phazes opposing setup sweepers like Garchomp and Mew that try to overwhelm Suicune with their own boosted attacks. Regenerator alongside Leftovers gives it much-needed longevity to pivot into attacks early-game and still maintain enough health to set up and sweep late-game.

Specially defensive walls such as RegenVest Landorus-T and Chansey can check special attackers like Tapu Koko, Azelf, and Latios that force Suicune to switch out; in particular, the former can also check Desolate Land users such as Heatran and Volcarona if Suicune is not running Weather Ball. Due to Suicune's propensity for being weakened by entry hazards, Defog users like Corviknight and Mandibuzz can help it.

Flip Turn is Swampert's main attack, letting it keep momentum, especially against Defoggers, and regain health with Regenerator. Earth Power is an option over Earthquake to be less crippled by burn, or if the team has a Grassy Terrain setter. Toxic punishes sweepers that would like to use Swampert as setup fodder, as well as a major Defogger in Tapu Fini. Roar is an option over Toxic to phaze foes, especially Magic Guard Pokemon, which don't fear Toxic.

Its secondary STAB move can be either Earthquake, for greater damage overall, or Earth Power, as Swampert is prone to being burned and sometimes pairs with Grassy Terrain setters. Thanks to its insane special bulk, RegenVest Swampert can use Mirror Coat to punish special threats that it cannot hit hard such as Zapdos or Tapu Fini; however, Counter is a neat option to punish Flip Turn from Barraskewda, which it handles thanks to its great overall bulk. Counter can also punish opposing Swampert's Flip Turn if you don't want to risk the Speed tie. Stone Edge is a great option to hit Primordial Sea Zapdos, as well as punishing Volcarona and Talonflame, but Scald can be used instead to burn defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight or opposing Swampert, and it also prevents physical threats such as Zarude from coming in freely. 0 Speed IVs and a Sassy nature allow Swampert to slow pivot on Corviknight.</p> <p>Swampert and Corviknight cover each other's typing weaknesses quite well, combine to handle both special and physical threats, and form a pivoting core. Tapu Fini is also a good teammate, providing Defog support and soft checking many of the physical threats of the tier, while Swampert checks most of the special threats. Offensively, all the Pokemon that greatly appreciate safe entry from slow pivoting make good partners, like Terrakion, Barraskewda, and Heatran. This set's main weakness is its dependence on Assault Vest to check special threats, which makes it particularly vulnerable to Knock Off. Pokemon that can absorb Knock Off such as Zamazenta-C make great partners, and both usefully resist Grass for Swampert as well.</p> <h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Utility Umbrella can be used over Rocky Helmet to check Primordial Sea Barraskewda, but it's a niche option and should be used only if your team is really weak to Barraskewda, as losing Rocky Helmet makes Swampert really passive. Several other move options are possible on the RegenVest set, depending on what you want to cover. Whirlpool allows Swampert to wear down or eliminate passive threats such as Tapu Fini and Skarmory that think they are safe against it—especially when they know it’s running Assault Vest. Ice Beam and Ice Punch hit Garchomp to prevent it from setting up in front of Swampert. Lastly, in offensive teams, Eject Button can be used to grab some huge momentum and immediately bring a powerful wallbreaker onto the field, but it too is a niche option.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Grass-types and Grass-type Coverage</strong>: With Swampert's 4x weakness Grass, any Grass-type move will usually KO it. Zarude, Solar Beam Heatran, and Energy Ball Tapu Lele are all huge threats for Swampert.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Without its Assault Vest, RegenVest Swampert's special bulk is significantly decreased and it's much harder to answer special attackers such as Zapdos, so Knock Off from Pokemon like Tapu Fini or Incineroar cripples it.</p> <p><strong>Desolate Land</strong>: Desolate Land blocks Swampert's Flip Turn, resulting in a loss of momentum.

Fire Blast complements Facade to significantly weaken common Steel-type checks such as Intimidate Corviknight and Dauntless Shield Skarmory, and it is not weakened by burn. The combination of Flying-type Facade + Fire Blast grants it sufficient coverage, which means Salamence can afford to run utility moves. Roost keeps it healthy by compensating for its Stealth Rock weakness and chip damage from burn. Dragon Dance lets Salamence sweep late-game, outspeeding faster foes like Tapu Koko, Cinderace, and Terrakion and OHKOing specially defensive Ferrothorn and Garchomp.

Mystical Fire not only reliably damages Intimidate Corviknight and Regenerator Ferrothorn, but also weakens strong special attackers like Desolate Land Heatran and Tapu Lele. With Future Sight, Latias can prevent Terrakion and Galarian Zapdos from taking advantage of free switches into Latias' teammates like Mandibuzz, Zarude, and Mew. Trick means Latias can debilitate RegenVest users, walls and other Pokemon that try to pivot into its attacking moves. Choice Scarf allows it to outpace Barraskewda and boosted setup sweepers like Scale Shot Garchomp, as well as making Trick potent. However, losing Choice Scarf stops Latias from revenge killing Dragon-types and weakened foes.</p> <p>Latias benefits from special walls such as RegenVest Swampert and Landorus-T that can switch into Tapu Lele, Zapdos, and Togekiss, which Latias is not able to check.

Physically defensive partners such as Intimidate Corviknight reliably switch into physical attackers that Latias struggles against, such as Dhelmise, Zarude, and Terrakion. Latias can pair with Heatran, Tapu Fini, and Garchomp to form aggressive Regenerator cores. Heatran is particularly noteworthy as a partner because it counters Tapu Koko, Latias's biggest offensive threat.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs with Trick fulfills Latios's role as a hit-and-run wallbreaker, but is easier to play around due to the lack of setup options and inability to soften up foes with Psyshock before using Draco Meteor. Adaptability is a good alternative that hits neutral targets like Blissey much harder at the cost of having a harder time against Steel-types. Dragon's Maw and Magic Guard are also viable options, the former boosting Draco Meteor's power and the latter improving longevity, but their inability to break Steel-types is very undesirable; to compensate for that, Mystical Fire can be used to hit Steel-types, or Thunder can be used to specifically hit Corviknight. Choice Scarf is also an option to serve as a revenge killer, though it does not reliably beat many key threats.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Jirachi</strong>: Jirachi is single-handedly the biggest roadblock to Latios, as it 4x resists Psyshock and loses barely over one-third of its health from Draco Meteor. It is free to set up Doom Desire or Future Sight, or simply bring in a faster Pokemon using U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Physical Moves</strong>: Latios suffers from being weak to common physical moves like U-turn and Knock Off, which are found on common Pokemon like Corviknight, Azelf, and Ferrothorn. Moreover, its mediocre Defense means even resisted moves like Zarude's Grassy Glide and Barraskewda's Liquidation will deal half of its health to Latios.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Latios is very susceptible to revenge killers, as all faster Pokemon, such as Tapu Koko and Talonflame, are able to KO Latios after some chip damage, which is very easy to obtain.</p>",

Draco Meteor is Latios's strongest move and is able to OHKO physically defensive Swampert, Corviknight, and Zarude after one Calm Mind boost. Psyshock is a more consistent STAB move that also conveniently hits special walls like Blissey and Assault Vest Swampert on their weaker Defense stat, as well as hitting Fairy-types such as Tapu Fini; additionally, it OHKOes Tapu Lele after one boost. Because Latios has a good Speed tier and Psyshock does not lower Special Attack, Latios is able to finish off weakened teams with Calm Mind and Psyshock. Roost provides much-needed recovery to offset damage from entry hazards and U-turn, which Latios will often be hit by while setting up on defensive Pokemon like Corviknight. Soul Dew boosts Latios's STAB moves without any negative effects. A Timid nature allows it to outspeed key offensive threats like Terrakion and Garchomp.</p> <p>Latios fits on balance teams that enjoy its ability to severely weaken defensive behemoths like Heatran and Mew. As such, it can work with wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos and Tapu Koko to overwhelm these defensive Pokemon. Fast revenge killers like Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Barraskewda are also good teammates, as they can revenge kill foes like Cinderace and Tapu Koko that threaten Latios. The Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor means Latios will often be forced out, so it requires a strong defensive backbone to absorb attacks after it uses Draco Meteor. This is compounded by its low Defense, meaning partners like Corviknight and Tapu Fini are required to switch into physical attackers like Zarude and Cinderace. Latios greatly struggles with the common RegenVest Jirachi, so teammates carrying Knock Off, such as Ferrothorn and Azelf, are useful to remove Jirachi's Assault Vest. Wandering Spirit users, notably Corviknight, are also helpful, as they can take away Jirachi's Regenerator while chipping it with Rocky Helmet. Physical attackers like Cinderace and Zarude are also helpful to threaten Jirachi and other soft checks to Latios like Blissey and Ferrothorn. Teammates that can set entry hazards are very useful, as Latios needs very minor chip damage to secure the OHKO on foes like Mew and Heatran after one boost. On the other hand, Defoggers are also good teammates, as Latios's hit-and-run nature means taking a lot of entry hazard damage if they are not removed. Lastly, teammates that can safely bring in Latios, such as Blissey and Corviknight, are helpful partners, so that Latios can minimize damage taken while switching in.</p>"

This, coupled with the fact that Jirachi’s most used move is U-turn, makes Wandering Spirit very problematic as it invalidates Regenerator. Common Wandering Spirit users such as Landorus-T and Corviknight can switch in on a Jirachi U-turn and steal its Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Primal Weather</strong>: Jirachi is unable to check common Desolate Land and Primordial Sea users, such as Heatran and Inteleon, due to its inability to switch into Fire- and Water-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Many fast physical wallbreakers including Barraskewda, Cinderace, Zygarde-10%, and Talonflame threaten OHKOs or major damage on Jirachi, and many can pivot on a predicted switch.

RegenVest Swampert checks primal weather wallbreakers such as Inteleon and Heatran while Rocky Helmet checks Tapu Koko and Garchomp. Blissey and Skarmory are also good partners due to them each blanketing most of the tier's special and physical wallbreakers, respectively.

In general, Toxic users can easily stop Togekiss from sweeping and let it get KOed from Toxic + Life Orb recoil.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pivots</strong>: Regenerator pivots such as Assault Vest Swampert can switch into Togekiss and pivot into adequate revenge killers.</p> <p><strong>Priority Blockers</strong>: Fast Pokemon with priority-blocking abilities such as Azelf are immune to Togekiss's Triage-boosted Draining Kiss, preventing Togekiss from safely sweeping until they are removed from the match.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Togekiss acts as a late-game sweeper capable of outspeeding every non-Triage Pokemon with its +3 priority-boosted recovery moves. Draining Kiss acts as Togekiss's main STAB move, and despite its Base Power, its damage output can be increased greatly with Life Orb and Nasty Plot. Togekiss is able to effectively outspeed the entire metagame, meaning Pokemon that can effectively revenge kill it are few and far between, being limited to Fairy resistant Pokemon and Dazzling or Psychic Surge Pokemon. This gives Togekiss a uniquely good matchup versus pivot-heavy bulky offense teams that do not carry an offensive Fire- or Steel- type. Togekiss is also able to set up on and brute-force its way through passive switch-ins such as Corviknight and non-Toxic Blissey. In the late game, Togekiss especially shines as a setup sweeper and wincon when the opponent's team is sufficiently weakened. Because Roost is also a healing move, it benefits from the +3 priority boost provided from Triage as well, allowing Togekiss to sponge some attacks with its above-average bulk and excellent typing and allowing it to act as a check to key threats such as Zarude and Garchomp. Due to Togekiss's narrow niche and need for heavy chip damage on Pokemon that resist its moves to execute a successful sweep, it should be considered as a specialist, only being brought in when a KO can be guaranteed or to pressure exceptionally weak foes out. For coverage moves, Togekiss mainly chooses between Flamethrower and Psyshock. Flamethrower allows it to pressure and beat Steel-types more effectively, while Psyshock allows Togekiss to put a dent into special walls like Blissey and Poison-types like Toxapex. A Modest nature with maximum Special Attack investment aim to maximize Togekiss's offensive capabilities; since it is priority-reliant, Speed and HP investment can be customized, but the current spread allows it to outpace defensive Heatran.</p> <p>Because of its fast Fairy-type attacks, Togekiss acts as an excellent teammate for those that struggle to outpace Dragon-, Fighting-, and Dark-types like Garchomp, Galarian Zapdos, and Zarude. Bulky pivots like Regenerator Swampert and Blissey are both able to weaken those fast threats while switching into Togekiss to clean up with Draining Kiss. Togekiss also pairs nicely with offensive powerhouses like Tinted Lens Latios and Primordial Sea Barraskewda, which can put easily exploitable dents into an opponent's team composition, giving Togekiss a greater opportunity to overwhelm the opponent in the endgame. Because Fire-types are going to be some of Togekiss's first switch-ins, Fire resist-resistant teammates to tank attacks from Fire-types like Volcarona and Heatran are essential teammates. Regenerator Garchomp and Swampert are good teammates to tank attacks while also setting up Stealth Rock. On a similar note, setup sweepers that share the same offensive checks also make great teammates for Togekiss—Sheer Force Tapu Lele and Triage Tapu Bulu can help clear the way for Togekiss by threatening to sweep unless a Fire-type is brought in to revenge kill them, in which case they can chip it low enough that Togekiss can clean up in the lategame, or vice versa. Pokemon that are able to set up hazards and pivot out slowly are also essential teammates for Togekiss, as their hazards weaken Togekiss's offensive switch-ins and allow for more wiggle room for Togekiss to set up Nasty Plot and execute a sweep. Finally, physically offensive Ground-types like Landorus-T or Garchomp are able to threaten Togekiss's common Steel-type counters such as Assault Vest Jirachi, as well as harming specially defensive walls like Blissey, enabling Togekiss's late-game cleanup.</p>"

Mamoswine can use High Horsepower when paired with a Grassy Surge user like Dhelmise, although this increases the likelihood of residual chip.

It can 2HKO almost every Pokemon without Intimidate or Dauntless Shield, such as Tapu Fini, Swampert, and Ferrothorn. Earthquake is the main STAB attack, allowing it to hit Steel- and Poison-types like Heatran and Toxapex for super effective damage, while Icicle Crash hits Ground-, Dragon- and Flying-types such as Landorus-T and Zapdos. Ice Shard is a useful Ice-type priority attack that allows it to revenge kill a plethora of Pokemon like Zygarde-10% and Landorus-T, as well as weakened faster threats like Tapu Koko and Talonflame. Toxic poisons Dauntless Shield Mew and bulky Water-types like Swampert and Tapu Fini to wear them down over the course of the game, while Knock Off removes important items from its checks, notably Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots, to weaken them more easily. Stealth Rock is an alternative as Mamoswine can reliably keep them up against Defoggers it can 2HKO like Tapu Fini and Moltres. Choice Band is the preferred option due to its lack of recoil and ability to guarantee the 2HKO on Tapu Fini, but it requires Mamoswine to rely on predictions, while Life Orb allows more flexibility at the cost of struggling to break bulkier walls without extensive team support. An Adamant nature allows Mamoswine to hit as hard as possible while still allowing it to outspeed fast defensive Pokemon like Tapu Fini and Mew.</p> <p>Mamoswine can break through special walls like Blissey and Jirachi with ease for special attackers such as Azelf and Zapdos. It can also break down Water-and Dragon-types like Tapu Fini and Silvally-Dragon for Cinderace, Talonflame, and other Fire-types; in return, these Fire-types can deal with Intimidate Corviknight, which would otherwise prevent Mamoswine from making progress. Dauntless Shield Mew is also another common check, so physical pivots like Cinderace and Barraskewda can help Mamoswine beat it. Special attackers such as Azelf and Volcarona force out Mamoswine, so Zapdos and Assault Vest Swampert are appreciated to tank their attacks. Revenge killers such as Cinderace and Terrakion threaten Mamoswine, so answers like Swampert, Zapdos, and Dauntless Shield Mew are all greatly appreciated. Zarude and Tapu Bulu also force out Mamoswine, so checks like Dauntless Shield Mandibuzz and Corviknight help in these matchups. Due to its mediocre bulk, Mamoswine likes coming in via pivots; as such, it appreciates partners like Corviknight and Mew that can slow pivot for it. Tapu Koko is also a great partner as it can outspeed and pivot on special walls that Mamoswine forces out like Blissey and Jirachi, along with being able to lure in Swampert and KO it with Grass Knot.</p>"

Equipped with a Choice Scarf, Azelf is able to outspeed naturally fast Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Talonflame, and Barraskewda.

Psychic Surge makes it a blanket check to many Triage and standard priority users, particularly Togekiss and Tapu Bulu.

Trick allows Azelf to cripple defenive Pokemon such as Blissey and Cosmic Power Mew, as well as offering an emergency option against setup sweepers such as Quiver Dance Volcarona. Fire Blast targets Steel-types that resist Expanding Force such as Ferrothorn and Corviknight, while Knock Off removes items from the likes of Blissey, Swampert, and Jirachi.

In addition to Desolate Land Heatran's offensive presence, its natural bulk and typing allow it to switch into and act as a soft check to various attackers such as Tapu Koko and Togekiss. Magma Storm is a powerful STAB move that enables Heatran to trap and eliminate Pokemon that would otherwise be able to switch into its Fire-type attacks comfortably, such as Tapu Fini and Assault Vest Swampert. Heatran is one of the most reliable Stealth Rock setters in the AAA metagame, as it pressures common Defoggers such as Corviknight and Tapu Fini. Toxic is useful for chipping down key Pokemon on the other team that may resist or be immune to Heatran's attacking moves, such as Primordial Sea Zapdos, while Taunt is useful to trap and eliminate Blissey, a common roadblock for Heatran. Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs with a Modest nature allow Heatran to hit as hard as possible, while a Timid nature allows Heatran to outspeed Pokemon that may try to outspeed Modest Heatran, such as Primordial Sea Zapdos.

In addition, Fairy-type attackers such as Tapu Koko often have trouble with the Steel-types that Heatran deals with handily. Desolate Land Heatran can also deal with Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Swampert, which many of the tier's attackers greatly appreciate. Heatran benefits from having teammates that can utilize Grassy Surge to weaken Earthquake from foes such as Garchomp, as well as increasing the passive recovery Heatran accumulates through Leftovers. Heatran enjoys having a teammate with a Ground immunity on its team, such as Corviknight, to switch into powerful Earthquakes. Corviknight and other Defoggers make good partners for Heatran to help it avoid chip damage from entry hazards.

Lava Plume is a STAB attack that can burn switch-ins such as Garchomp, generally deterring physical attackers from switching in. Earth Power hits other Fire-types, like Cinderace which are immune to burn, as well as Tapu Koko and Toxapex. Toxic can debilitate switch-ins that don't mind burn's Attack drop, such as Zapdos and Tapu Lele. Heavy Slam, when combined with Chople Berry, can let Heatran lure in special attackers with Fighting-type coverage, notably Tapu Lele.

Lava Plume can also give Dhelmise a chance to set up a Swords Dance against burnt physical attackers. Volt Absorb Corviknight helps against Primordial Sea Zapdos, which can destroy Heatran with Weather Ball. Since Heatran is an excellent check to Tapu Koko, it pairs well with Pokemon that are forced out by it, such as Terrakion and Garchomp.

Flare Blitz complements Icicle Crash by hitting non-Flash Fire Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Corviknight, and Skarmory, as well as Jirachi and Doublade. U-turn lets Galarian Darmanitan act as a pivot—which works exceptionally well with Magic Guard to avoid entry hazard damage—to safely bring in teammates that can deal with its switch-ins like Tapu Fini and Dauntless Shield Mew, even providing a strong hit for the latter. Earthquake provides important coverage for Toxapex, while Superpower covers other Steel-types like Flash Fire Ferrothorn. Magic Guard also provides solid longevity by letting Galarian Darmanitan avoid Life Orb and Flare Blitz recoil, as well as Rocky Helmet from users like Skarmory, Corviknight, and Ferrothorn. A Jolly nature is used to outspeed and OHKO Adamant Galarian Zapdos and, after minor chip damage, Modest Tapu Lele.</p> <p>Galarian Darmanitan fits mostly on offense and bulky offense teams. Defensive pivots like Corviknight and RegenVest Jirachi and Landorus-T make for great teammates, as they can bring it in safely on foes like Ferrothorn and opposing Landorus-T. They can also switch into threats that can revenge kill it reliably like Terrakion, Tapu Lele, and Volcarona, respectively. Offensive pivots like Zarude and Tapu Koko are also great options, as they form a potent VoltTurn core with Galarian Darmanitan; they pressure bulky Water-types and Dauntless Shield Mew, while Galarian Darmanitan threatens some of their best checks like Mandibuzz and RegenVest Landorus-T, respectively. Late-game cleaners like Swords Dance Talonflame and Choice Scarf Azelf appreciate Galarian Darmanitan pressuring Mandibuzz and Corviknight for them. A sturdy Fire-resistant or -immune teammate like Slowbro or Primordial Sea Zapdos is necessary to switch into fast Fire-type threats like Cinderace and Talonflame. Offensive teammates that can compensate for Galarian Darmanitan's average Speed like Choice Scarf Azelf and Choice Band Zarude are great partners, as they can revenge kill faster threats like Terrakion and Barraskewda, respectively.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Thanks to Belly Drum and a high Speed stat post-transformation, Zen Mode Galarian Darmanitan becomes a threatening cleaner when it is able to set up. Once Zen Mode is activated, its newfound Speed tier alongside Salac Berry allows it to outspeed the unboosted metagame, outpacing fast foes like Regieleki, Choice Scarf Azelf and Latios, and Surge Surfer Xurkitree. After Belly Drum, Icicle Crash threatens to OHKO prominent physically bulky Pokemon like Swampert, Flash Fire Ferrothorn and Corviknight, and Dauntless Shield Hippowdon. Even with Belly Drum and Ice Punch's reliability, Icicle Crash is still preferred to ignore debilitating Rocky Helmet from foes like Kommo-o and Hippowdon, and most importantly, guarantee the 2HKO on Unaware Mandibuzz, which ignores its Belly Drum boost. Boosted Fire Punch cleanly OHKOes physically defensive Steel-types like Dauntless Shield Skarmory and Corviknight, as well as Jirachi and Doublade. Earthquake is a fine alternative to also hit the latter two alongside Heatran, Volcanion, and Toxapex and is Zen Mode Galarian Darmanitan's strongest attack to hit other bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini and Vaporeon. Substitute lets it safely activate Zen Mode and Salac Berry, takes advantage of passive foes like Mew and Ferrothorn by blocking their status moves, and prevents it from being revenge killed by priority attacks like Triage Kommo's Drain Punch and Barraskewda's Aqua Jet.</p> <p>Zen Mode Galarian Darmanitan fits exclusively on hyper offense teams that appreciate its high offensive presence. Since it will, at best, get one chance to sweep, it needs pristine conditions to get both Belly Drum and the Salac Berry activation safely. Dual screens support from teammates like Regieleki and Tapu Koko are near-mandatory, as they allow Zen Mode Galarian Darmanitan to set up much more easily. They can also help alleviate its Stealth Rock weakness: Regieleki's Rapid Spin removes them, while Tapu Koko's Taunt can shut down attempts of setting them up from foes like Ferrothorn and Heatran. Galvanize Kommo-o is an amazing partner that can wallbreak early-game and lure in and potentially KO Prankster Toxapex and Dauntless Shield Skarmory for Zen Mode Galarian Darmanitan, especially if it is not running the right coverage move. Setup sweepers like Triage Tapu Bulu and Swords Dance Dhelmise appreciate Zen Mode Galarian Darmanitan threatening Unaware Mandibuzz, Dauntless Shield Kommo-o, and physically defensive Corviknight and Skarmory for them; moreover, they help pressure bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini, Slowbro, and Vaporeon for it in return. Psychic Surge Azelf provides Psychic Terrain to prevent Zen Mode Galarian Darmanitan from being revenge killed by priority attacks, especially as it tends to be at low health after setting up.</p>"

Ferrothorn can also run Stealth Rock, however in general there are better Stealth Rock users and it becomes too passive if it runs both entry hazards.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Strong Fighting-type moves such as Close Combat from Terrakion and Barraskewda or High Jump Kick from Cinderace can heavily damage Ferrothorn. However, they need to watch out for Chople Berry, especially Close Combat users since Ferrothorn can take advantage of the Defense drop and KO them back in return. They also don't want to switch in directly as they rely on their items and fear Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: If Ferrothorn doesn't have a Fire immunity, Fire-type moves like Fire Blast from Azelf and Flare Blitz from Talonflame threaten to OHKO it. Pokemon with Desolate Land such as Volcanion and Heatran can override Ferrothorn's Primordial Sea as they switch in, and Heatran in particular can also negate Flash Fire variants if it runs Mold Breaker.</p>",

      "Defensive Regenerator": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its excellent utility movepool and useful defensive typing, Regenerator Ferrothorn is an excellent support Pokemon. Knock Off is its most consistent attack, removing important items such as Leftovers and Rocky Helmet from foes. Spikes supports its teammates by providing chip damage, and combined with Knock Off can help chip Pokemon even if they carry Heavy-Duty Boots. Power Whip is a powerful STAB option that deals significant damage to Water-type Pokemon, notably Tapu Fini to prevent it from clearing Spikes with Defog, and also 2HKOes Tapu Koko. Body Press can be used instead to target Heatran and opposing Ferrothorn. Thunder Wave further cripples switch-ins, slowing them and potentially denying their entry hazard removal. If Ferrothorn runs Body Press, Iron Defense is an alternative that allows it to beat Corviknight one-on-one, which otherwise prevent it from setting Spikes. It can also beat some Fighting-type Pokemon like Terrakion and Mienshao if they switch in on the turn Ferrothorn boosts its Defense. Rocky Helmet helps it punish contact moves, usually U-turn and Flip Turn from the likes of Landorus-T and Barraskewda. Chople Berry allows Ferrothorn to survive a Close Combat from Terrakion and Barraskewda and OHKO back with Power Whip. Finally, Heavy-Duty Boots lets Ferrothorn ignore Spikes damage and pivot into attackers like Tapu Koko more reliably. The given EV spread allows it to avoid the 2HKO from Inteleon's and Primarina's Hydro Pump, the 4HKO from Pixilate Tapu Koko's Facade, and the OHKO from Barraskewda's Close Combat without Chople Berry intact.</p> <p>Regenerator Ferrothorn finds its place on almost all team styles. Primordial Sea Zapdos is a great partner for Ferrothorn, as it can take on Fire-types like Heatran that force Ferrothorn out, while Ferrothorn can handle Rock- and Water-type moves that threaten Zapdos. Zapdos also complements Ferrothorn's Spikes by threatening all common Defoggers and spinners such as Mandibuzz and Corviknight and pivoting with either U-turn or Volt Switch to rack up Spikes damage. Heatran can form a hazard stack core together with Ferrothorn and also deny Defog with Taunt. Together with Tapu Fini, they form a solid defensive Fire / Water / Grass core with a lot of useful utility options. Offensive threats appreciate Ferrothorn's Spikes to help them pick up more key KOs, especially those that can pivot to wear down their checks and counters such as Galarian Zapdos and Primordial Sea Barraskewda. Even with Chople Berry, Ferrothorn can't switch in directly against a strong Close Combat, so bulky Pokemon that resist Fighting make for great partners, such as Mew and the aforementioned Tapu Fini.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Specially defensive Ferrothorn is a solid answer to dangerous specially offensive threats such as Tapu Koko and Primarina. Leech Seed is mandatory because of its lack of a reliable recovery move, allowing it to chip switch ins such as Corviknight while restoring HP. Knock Off removes items from them, discouraging Pokemon that heavily rely on their item such as Zapdos from switching in. Body Press is another option which targets foes that don't mind losing their item such as opposing Ferrothorn, while also hitting Heatran. Power Whip lets Ferrothorn pressure Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Swampert; however, Gyro Ball is a good alternative that hits foes like Tapu Lele and Togekiss harder. Spikes is a great last option to support its teammates, as Ferrothorn forces many switches. Protect instead lets it scout moves from Choice item Pokemon such as Terrakion and get more health back from Leftovers and Leech Seed. If Ferrothorn runs Body Press and Gyro Ball, Curse can also be considered, potentially sweeping against unprepared opponents. Bulletproof allows Ferrothorn to comfortably wall Sheer Force Tapu Lele, and should be paired with Gyro Ball to OHKO it in return. Flash Fire and Primordial Sea negate Ferrothorn's Fire weakness, allowing it to check dangerous attackers such as Heatran and Entei, with Flash Fire being more vulnerable to Mold Breaker Heatran while Primordial Sea risks getting overridden by a Desolate Land switch-in and doesn't stop Will-O-Wisp. Leftovers helps Ferrothorn make up for its lack of reliable recovery. 252 HP EVs maximizes Leftovers recovery; if Gyro Ball is used, Ferrothorn should run 0 Speed and a Sassy nature to make it hit as hard as possible.</p> <p>Specially defensive Ferrothorn finds its place in teams that need an utility special wall that can also handle either Tapu Lele or Fire-type Pokemon. Fighting-types such as Terrakion threaten Ferrothorn, therefore teammates that can handle it are appreciated. For example, Intimidate Corviknight can form an entry hazard control duo with Ferrothorn and check Terrakion, while Ferrothorn takes on Heatran and Volcanion for Corviknight. Similarly, Tapu Fini can cover for Ferrothorn's weaknesses, provide a midground switch in case a Desolate Land Pokemon overrides Ferrothorn's Primordial Sea, and cripple defensive threats with Trick. Offensive threats with pivot like Galarian Zapdos and Talonflame utilize Ferrothorn's Spikes well. Tapu Koko, in particular, can take on Galarian Zapdos and pressure common entry hazard removers. Garchomp can stack entry hazards alongside Ferrothorn with Stealth Rock and also set up Swords Dance to punish hazard removal attempts.</p>"

Flamethrower provides coverage against Normal- and Dark-type Pokemon that can stomach a Shadow Ball such as Blissey, Chansey, and Mandibuzz, as well as Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Corviknight. Together, these two moves 2HKO almost every common Pokemon, with the exception of RegenVest Swampert, Chansey, and Blissey. Substitute helps Chandelure beat Blissey, who often can not threaten Chandelure with moves other than status, and eases predictions against pivots. Pain Split is used to recover HP against Chansey and Blissey, as Chandelure can be worn down due to its weakness to Stealth Rock and by Substitute, and beat them one-on-one.

Mandibuzz can check a wide range of physical attackers including Zarude, Zygarde-10%, and Talonflame; even the setup variants cannot overwhelm Unaware varients. Dauntless Shield provides significantly more physical bulk on switch in, especially allowing it to check Zygarde-10%, and still usually check opposing setup. It is also one of the few reliable checks to Dhelmise, one of the hardest wallbreakers to account for defensively. Foul Play lets the weak Mandibuzz deal significant damage, especially if foes attempt to set up. Roost keeps Mandibuzz healthy throughout the match, and U-turn lets it function as a slow pivot and generate momentum against foes it forces out. Mandibuzz is a solid Defogger as well, which gives it solid utility even when it's not needed to check a setup sweeper. Brave Bird is another option if a teammate is already providing entry hazard removal, and it hits targets like Zarude and Volcarona harder than Foul Play does, while Toxic punishes opposing walls and beats Togekiss without Life Orb. Heavy-Duty Boots is the preferred item to negate Stealth Rock damage, especially if Mandibuzz is the Defogger. Mandibuzz strongly dislikes Toxic and Knock Off, as they severely cut into its longevity, so it must be careful switching into defensive Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Toxapex that often carry them. Lastly, due to how ubiquitous Mandibuzz is as a physical setup check, lure sets like Galvanize Landorus-T are sometimes run to eliminate it; Mandibuzz should be careful about switching into attackers with unrevealed abilities, especially since Unaware allows it to safely come in even after the standard sets have set up.</p> <p>Mandibuzz fits best on balance and bulky offense teams due to its fantastic role compression; in a single teamslot it provides physical bulk, setup deterrence, entry hazard removal, and slow pivoting.

Mandibuzz struggles to check physical attackers that can hit it hard without needing to set up, like Terrakion and Cinderace, so strong checks to those like Dauntless Shield Mew make great partners. Mandibuzz is also usually unable to check special setup sweepers like Tapu Lele, so specially bulky teammates like RegenVest Jirachi are recommended.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Hydreigon is a powerful wallbreaker that can overpower common special walls such as Blissey, Assault Vest Swampert, and Jirachi. Nasty Plot and Dragon's Maw provide Hydreigon with obscene power; it has a chance to OHKO Blissey with Draco Meteor after one boost, as well as a guaranteed OHKO on Swampert, Corviknight, and Toxapex. Hydreigon's third move is flexible based on team needs. Flash Cannon hits Fairy-types such as Togekiss, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Bulu, Dark Pulse hits Assault Vest Jirachi—which otherwise can survive Hydreigon's attacks comfortably, and Shock Wave can OHKO Tapu Fini after minor chip damage. Roost allows Hydreigon to stay healthy over the course of a game to wallbreak multiple times, while running three attacks instead lets Hydreigon pressure more Pokemon. Life Orb maximizes its wallbreaking potential and is necessary for getting KOs against Blissey and Tapu Fini. A Timid nature allows it to outspeed common Pokemon such as Adamant Zarude, but a Modest nature still lets it outspeed many of the same foes.</p> <p>Hydreigon fits on balance teams and provides high damage while breaking through common special walls for them. Due to its middling Speed, it pairs well with teammates such as Zapdos and Zygarde-10% that can spread paralysis, enabling Hydreigon to outspeed and threaten even more Pokemon. Similarly, it also appreciates fast partners such as Barraskewda, Choice Scarf Azelf, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, which threaten other fast Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Terrakion. If lacking Flash Cannon, Hydreigon has trouble hitting Fairy-type Pokemon, thus appreciating strong teammates like Tapu Bulu that pressure the common Fairy-types. Assault Vest Jirachi is a problem if Hydreigon is not running Dark Pulse, so Knock Off users such as Azelf and Tapu Fini, which can remove Jirachi's Assault Vest, or Wandering Spirit users like Corviknight, which can remove Regenerator, are good partners. Defensive pivots that can safely bring in Hydreigon, such as Blissey and Swampert, are helpful partners. Hydreigon also appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Swampert and Heatran to secure important KOs, like against Blissey.</p>"

Nasty Plot gives Hydreigon the firepower to OHKO offensive threats like Talonflame and Zygarde-10% and boost past bulky walls like Blissey. Dark Pulse and Fire Blast are the preferred coverage options of choice, as at +2, they OHKO Barraskewda and Tapu Koko, respectively. Draco Meteor is also an option over Fire Blast to provide more immediate power versus Dark- and Fire-resistant Pokemon like Terrakion and opposing Hydreigon; it also 2HKOes Unaware Mandibuzz. Earth Power is another alternative that gives more accurate coverage for targets like Tapu Koko, Toxapex, and Heatran. A Modest nature is preferred, as Timid offers no notable benchmarks.</p> <p>Hydreigon fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate the Speed it provides. Physical wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos and Terrakion benefit from Hydreigon pivoting into Mew and Intimidate Corviknight that try to switch into them. Offensive Pokemon like Dhelmise and Tapu Lele with weaknesses to status spreaders like Toxapex and Blissey pair well with Hydreigon, since it has an effective immunity to their status and can use them as setup fodder. Also, Hydreigon is constantly taking chip damage from its burn and appreciates the Grassy Terrain recovery that Dhelmise offers. Pixilate Tapu Koko is a noteworthy partner for Hydreigon because Dark Pulse + Fire Blast coverage targets many of Tapu Koko's common switch-ins, such as Heatran, Jirachi, and Ferrothorn. In addition, entry hazard control from common users like Tapu Fini and Corviknight keeps Hydreigon as healthy as possible so it doesn't have to continuously use Roost.</p>"

Flamethrower is a STAB and weather-boosted option, allowing it to deal good damage even without any boosts. Giga Drain is a useful move for hitting Pokemon such as Swampert and Barraskewda super effectively, as well as being a secondary way to recover HP. Alternatively, Solar Beam's higher power makes up for the minimal Special Attack investment, notably being able to OHKO physically defensive Swampert without a boost; however, Solar Beam significantly worsens Volcarona'a match up against Primordial Sea users like Zapdos and Barraskewda. The EV spread allows Volcarona to avoid a 2HKO from Sheer Force Tapu Lele's Thunderbolt while outspeeding it; the remaining EVs are put into Special Attack to maximize damage output.</p> <p>Volcarona is often found on bulky offense teams with more than one Fire-type, so that they are able to break past each others' checks.

Close Combat damages Pokemon like Barraskewda and Zarude that would otherwise stay in on Cobalion. Toxic damages Pokemon like Zapdos and Swampert, which would otherwise use Defog or damage and status Cobalion with their STAB moves, while Taunt instead stops Defog or status moves from Pokemon like Corviknight and Ferrothorn. 112 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Timid Heatran as well as neutral Lucario.

Chople Berry allows Cobalion to survive a single powerful Fighting-type attack, including a Close Combat from Terrakion or Zarude, for a surprise KO back.</p> <p>As a pivot and entry hazard setter, Cobalion is easy to fit on most AAA teams, which highly value both qualities, espeically in one package. It forms a great defensive pivoting core with RegenVest Swampert, which is a great blanket check to many of the special attackers that would take advantage of Cobalion's weaker Special Defense. Because Cobalion's only form of recovery is Regenerator, it synergizes well with physical walls, which can switch into Pokemon that overwhelm and force Cobalion out. Mew, Zapdos, and Tapu Fini all perform this job well, and they appreciate Cobalion switching into Knock Off for them. Zapdos deserves special mention, as Primordial Sea Zapdos is immune to or resists all of Cobalion's weaknesses (and vice versa) while providing Defog and status support as well. Like AAA's other pivots, Cobalion pairs well with offensive Pokemon that struggle to switch in, such as Talonflame and Tapu Koko.

A Sniper set with Laser Focus allows Terrakion to beat every common defensive switch in, but once the set is revealed the foe can stay in and attack to deny the Laser Focus turn. Download is another option on bulky teams using fast breakers such as Tapu Koko that can bring Terrakion against Jirachi and Blissey to boost its Attack, allowing it to 2HKO Intimidate Corviknight with the Choice Band boost. However, it's dependent of the Download's boost to make great damages.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dauntless Shield Users</strong>: Dauntless Shield Mew and Hippowdon are two of the few reliable switch ins to Adaptability Terrakion, as they are not 2HKOed by any move even with Stealth Rock up and can heal reliably, counter back with strong super effective attacks, or inflict Terrakion with status. However, they both must watch out for Toxic while switching in.</p> <p><strong>Nidoqueen, Palossand, and Doublade</strong>: While Terrakion threatens every common wall in the meta, it should be noted that dedicated walls for it do exist.

With Regenerator, they are often able to do this multiple times per battle but can be overwhelmed if not kept at high HP.</p> <p><strong>Protect Users</strong>: Terrakion has a difficult matchup against defensive Pokemon that run Protect, notably Heatran, as Protect both reveals which move Terrakion is locked into, enabling the opponent to pick the correct switch-in, and drains precious PP. Both of Terrakion's STAB moves have only 8 PP and are prone to being stalled out over the course of longer games, and Protect accelerates that.

Rock- and Fighting-type STAB moves have near-perfect coverage by themselves, making Adaptability a fantastic damage amplifying ability for it. With a Choice Band equipped, very few defensive walls can safely switch into Terrakion. Dauntless Shield Mew is one of the most reliable answers as it is never 2HKOed by any of Terrakion's common moves without a critical hit, but even Dauntless Shield Corviknight fails to check Terrakion reliably as Stealth Rock damage is enough to let it get 2HKOed by Close Combat. Terrakion's base 108 Speed is enough to outpace all common defensive Pokemon and a number of common breakers, including Zapdos and Garchomp, giving it plenty of Pokemon to force out if brought in via a slow pivot or after a KO. While Terrakion will almost always be using its STAB moves, Earthquake is a 100% accurate option to hit Toxapex and Doublade without getting PP stalled, Megahorn lets Terrakion 2HKO Dauntless Shield Mew and Slowbro after Stealth Rock, and Toxic is a nice option to cripple walls that Terrakion cannot 2HKO like Dauntless Shield Mew and Hippowdon. Stealth Rock is also an option to let Terrakion get entry hazards up on a predicted switch if the opponent has a reliable answer to it. Terrakion runs maximum Speed and Attack investment with a Jolly nature to take advantage of its Speed tier and maximize the number of Pokemon it beats one-on-one.</p> <p>Terrakion fits well on bulky offense teams that can provide it with many opportunities to switch in and fire off strong attacks. While almost nothing can safely switch into Terrakion, it is also true that Terrakion does not want to switch in on many Pokemon either. Therefore, slow pivots like Corviknight, Swampert, and Blissey provide the safe switch in that Terrakion needs and make excellent teammates. Defensive pivots also make good teammates as Terrakion is often forced out after it gets a KO due to its mediocre bulk and only slightly above-average Speed. Good offensive teammates include fast physical attackers that like to take advantage of the weakened or broken defensive cores that Terrakion creates such as Barraskewda and Zarude. Other good offensive teammates include Azelf and Tapu Koko, as they can draw out and pivot on RegenVest Pokemon and Blissey that Terrakion can beat easily; Azelf can also set up Psychic Terrain to protect Terrakion from Triage. Lastly, Terrakion appreciates entry hazard support, as many of its checks can only check it from high health, and hazards help whittle them down until they can no longer switch in.</p>"

It can also be overwhelmed by particularly strong special attackers, like Volcanion and Inteleon, so more specially defensive teammates like Blissey can be used to take hits from them. Landorus-T relies on its Assault Vest to effectively perform as a special pivot, so teammates like Tapu Fini that can take Knock Off are appreciated so Landorus-T can preserve its bulk. Due to Regenerator being Landorus-T's only means of recovering HP, entry hazard removers like Excadrill and Mandibuzz are appreciated to minimize chip damage; it also benefits from entry hazard support like Spikes Mew to take advantage of the numerous switches it forces and item removal it provides.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Landorus-T is one of the best Choice Scarf users in the tier due to its combination of bulk, power, coverage, and access to U-turn. Earthquake OHKOes many premier attackers, such as Tapu Koko, Terrakion, and Cinderace. It also forces out common defensive Pokemon like Heatran, Jirachi, and Blissey. U-turn takes advantage of the switches Landorus-T forces, allowing it to safely bring in a teammate like Tapu Koko. Knock Off offers useful utility in removing items from switch-ins, such as Corviknight and Ferrothorn, and is its best option against Dhelmise. Stone Edge keeps Talonflame, Zapdos, and unboosted Volcarona in check, but do note that Zapdos survives a hit from full health and can threaten an OHKO in return. Because of Stone Edge's limited use otherwise, Defog can be utilized instead as an emergency entry hazard removal option, and it takes advantage of Landorus-T's positive matchup against Heatran, one of the best Stealth Rock setters. Regenerator keeps Landorus-T healthy throughout a game to repeatedly pivot into threats like Tapu Koko and Talonflame, fulfilling its role as an offensive pivot. The given Speed investment in conjunction with a Choice Scarf allows Landorus-T to outspeed Barraskewda; the remaining EVs are put into HP and Defense to maximize bulk, which notably allows Landorus-T to survive a Stone Edge from Terrakion.</p> <p>Landorus-T fits on balance teams in need of a check to dangerous attackers like Tapu Koko, Terrakion, and Talonflame. It pairs well with defensive Pokemon like Corviknight, Jirachi, and Blissey, as they can invite the aforementioned wallbreakers in and then pivot into Landorus-T. At the same time, Landorus-T complements special attackers greatly by threatening special walls such as Heatran, Jirachi, and Blissey, further forming a VoltTurn core with the likes of Tapu Koko, Azelf, and Genesect. Zapdos forms a particularly stellar offensive core with Landorus-T, as it can come in on Corviknight, Tapu Fini, and Garchomp, among other foes that attempt to check Landorus-T; in return, Landorus-T outspeeds and checks revenge killers like Terrakion. Landorus-T is also weak to common Water- and Ice-type attacks from the likes of Genesect, Zapdos, and Swampert, so teammates like Tapu Fini and Desolate Land Heatran are essential to help cover them. Additionally, Blissey can switch into Zapdos and chip it via Seismic Toss, greatly helping Landorus-T in revenge killing Zapdos. Entry hazards from setters like Heatran let Landorus-T win the pivoting battle long-term.</p>"

      "Aerilate Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Landorus-T is a stellar Stealth Rock lead as with its extremely strong Explosion. With a boost and STAB from Aerilate, Explosion can OHKO most foes that do not resist it, such as Tapu Fini, and severely dent resistant Pokemon like Corviknight and Zapdos. In addition, it provides teammates a free switch in while denying any Defog or Rapid Spin attempts, mainly by Corviknight. Earthquake hits Steel-types and Electric-types like Heatran, Tapu Koko, and Jirachi that resist Explosion. Swords Dance boosts Explosion damage to monstrous levels, notably giving a chance to OHKO Corviknight. Alternatively, Body Slam allows Landorus-T to threaten foes with paralysis before using Explosion, which is useful against more offensive teams. Focus Sash is preferred to give Landorus-T an extra turn to work with and guarantee it can set up Stealth Rock. Life Orb is suboptimal for a dedicated lead, but it instead provides extra wallbreaking power for Corviknight and Zapdos. A Jolly Nature is used to outspeed the likes of Genesect and Tapu Lele with a neutral nature.</p> <p>Landorus-T finds its home on hyper offense teams, where dangerous sweepers like Tinted Lens Genesect and Bulk Up Cinderace can take full advantage of a free switch in, as well as Stealth Rock support. Cinderace, alongside other Fire-types like Volcarona, is especially useful to immediately force out a Corviknight that took Landorus-T's Explosion, denying it any chance to use using Defog or Roost. Consequently, strong physical attackers like Terrakion, Zarude, and Garchomp fit well with the pairing, as they greatly benefit from Corviknight being weakened. Focus Sash variants do not require much support, as their main goal is to set up Stealth Rock and use Explosion, but Life Orb variants, being less of suicide leads, appreciate Desolate Land users like Volcarona to take on Water-types like Swampert and Barraskewda. Life Orb Landorus-T especially enjoys teammates like Terrakion and Garchomp, as they burden walls like Corviknight and Tapu Fini to check both them and Landorus-T; this pressure on the walls lessens the need for Landorus-T to heavily chip them but sacrifice itself via Explosion.</p>"

They also have pivoting and reliable recovery to consistently annoy Talonflame over the course of the match.</p> <p><strong>Flash Fire Corviknight</strong>: Talonflame can't hit Corviknight neutrally, and Corviknight can do more than 50% to Talonflame with Brave Bird or use U-turn to bring in a faster threat safely.</p> <p><strong>Unaware</strong>: Unaware Mandibuzz and Mew comfortably avoid being 2HKOed and ignore Swords Dance boosts. However, in a longer game, Talonflame can feasibly stall them out of recovery PP, especially if they lack the ability to punish Talonflame themselves with Foul Play or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Prankster Toxapex</strong>: Similarly to the Unaware checks above, Toxapex can prevent Talonflame from sweeping as long as it has PP for Recover; additionally, it can remove Talonflame’s Life Orb with Knock Off, which reduces its power considerably.

        "description": "<p>Talonflame has found a welcoming home in Generation 8 Almost Any Ability, being an attacker with good power and coverage that is hard to wear down. In a metagame that has few viable Rock-types, Talonflame's STAB moves provide fantastic coverage, with the only common resistant foes being Primordial Sea Zapdos or Tapu Koko and Flash Fire Corviknight. Thanks to its high Base Power moves and Life Orb, which have their recoil negated by Magic Guard, Talonflame hits surprisingly hard despite having a low Attack stat. For reference, fully physically defensive Swampert cannot safely switch into Talonflame if it is below 80% health, as it risks getting 2HKOed by Brave Bird. Talonflame possesses a great Speed tier for AAA, leaving it only outspeed by Barraskewda, Tapu Koko, and the rare Zamazenta-C. Additionally, it resists every common Triage move and Grassy Glide, making it difficult to revenge kill with priority. Swords Dance amplifies Talonflame's offensive presence, and it can often find time to set up safely against either offensive threats it forces out, like Volcarona and Zarude, or defensive stalwarts that are unable to KO it back like Corviknight and most Mew. Its power, access to setup, and longevity make it particularly effective at breaking down bulkier teams. Talonflame does really need to run maximum Attack and Speed with Jolly to maximize its offensive capabilities.</p> <p>Talonflame fits well on bulky offense or balance teams that want offensive pressure without having to provide much support. Since it is immune to all entry hazards, Talonflame doesn't require hazard control, and Magic Guard means it can't be worn down by stray Toxics or Rocky Helmets (although it does fear paralysis). Since its bulk is not fantastic, it does appreciate slow pivots like Swampert and Corviknight to bring it in safely; in exchange, it forces out foes like Cinderace or Volcarona that may have tried to come in on them. There are some common switch-ins that frustrate Talonflame, however; Primordial Sea Zapdos in particular can't be hit neutrally and forces it out, so teammates that can handle Zapdos like RegenVest Swampert, Blissey, and Silvally-Dragon are always appreciated. Additionally, while Talonflame is fast, most Choice Scarf users and a few faster threats—Tapu Koko and Barraskewda—can revenge kill it reliably. Good revenge killers or solid switch-ins to those are strongly advised; Choice Scarf Azelf is especially notable as a great revenge killer that lets Talonflame in often with U-turn.</p>"

These offensive Pokemon, in turn, appreciate Volcanion's ability to punch huge holes in opposing teams so they can clean up late-game. Other offensive Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Talonflame are also useful, as they cover up Volcanion's middling Speed and can force out revenge killers such as Galarian Zapdos. Lastly, entry hazards support pairs well with Volcanion as it forces many switches, and it is useful to secure the OHKO on Jirachi and the 2HKO on non-Assault Vest Garchomp. As such, setters like Garchomp and Ferrothorn make good teammates. Dauntless Shield Mew deserves special mention as a Spikes setter, as it checks many Pokemon that outspeed and threaten Volcanion, such as Terrakion and Zygarde-10%, and can bring it in safely with Volt Switch or Teleport.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Volcanion is one of the strongest wallbreakers in the metagame. It distinguishes itself from other Primordial Sea users with its secondary Fire typing, which allows it to keep its STAB boost on Weather Ball if a Desolate Land user switches in, notably being able to OHKO offensive Heatran, OHKO Cinderace after minor chip, and 2HKO Moltres. Weather Ball also offers higher accuracy and PP than Steam Eruption. That said, Steam Eruption is Volcanion's strongest move in rain and 2HKOes the likes of Ferrothorn, Assault Vest Swampert and Jirachi, and OHKOes Garchomp after minor chip. Moreover, the burn chance lets it eventually 2HKO Blissey and specially defensive Ferrothorn once they are burned. Earth Power is the strongest move against Toxapex, which can otherwise stall out Steam Eruption's PP. Sludge Bomb allows Volcanion to poison its checks like Silvally-Dragon and Blastoise and also hits Tapu Fini and Tapu Bulu. Choice Specs in conjunction with a Modest nature maximizes Volcanion's power.</p> <p>Volcanion finds home on balance and bulky offense teams in need of a strong wallbreaker, and it greatly benefits from the many slow pivots present on these types of teams, such as Corviknight and Mandibuzz, that can safely bring in Volcanion. Both are especially useful to switch into Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T attempting to revenge kill Volcanion, while also crucially providing Defog, as Volcanion can be chipped down quickly from entry hazards damage. Similarly, Tapu Fini and Excadrill are great partners, as they have access to Defog and Rapid Spin, respectively; in addition, the former provides Knock Off support, while the latter is an excellent check to Tapu Koko, a prime revenge killer to Volcanion. Volcanion also pairs well with offensive pivots like Landorus-T and Tapu Koko, which invite in defensive Pokemon like Corviknight and Heatran, respectively, and can bring in Volcanion safely to wallbreak. Azelf is also a useful teammate to Volcanion, as they both have similar checks, and Azelf threatens to cripple the likes of Chansey and Silvally-Dragon with Trick or Knock Off. All three Pokemon mentioned serve as excellent revenge killers to check Pokemon like Terrakion and Zygarde-10% that can revenge kill Volcanion. Furthermore, entry hazards setters like Ferrothorn and Mew are important teammates that can help wear down the opposing team, chipping Pokemon like specially defensive Ferrothorn into 2HKO range and Garchomp into OHKO range. Entry hazards are also very important to rack up damage on Silvally-Dragon, as Volcanion can eventually outdamage its Regenerator recovery and 2HKO it using Steam Eruption.</p>"

Bug Buzz nails Mew and also discourages Mandibuzz from using Roost. Thunder Wave instead cripples them and can be used in an emergency against setup sweepers like Kommo-o and Tapu Lele; however, it makes Vikavolt helpless against Ground-types. Focus Sash guarantees Vikavolt can set Sticky Web against wallbreakers that could OHKO it, namely Terrakion and Inteleon.

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its fantastic defensive typing and bulk, in conjunction with priority recovery and stat clearing with Haze, Prankster Toxapex is a great physical wall and setup deterrent. Its typing provides important resistances to Fire-, Fighting-, and Water-types, checking dangerous physical attackers like Cinderace, Terrakion, and Barraskewda. Toxapex's most significant role lies in deterring setup with Prankster Haze, which stops dangerous threats like Cosmic Power Mew and Quiver Dance Volcarona from making progress. It can also serve as an emergency check to threats it does not outright beat like Dragon Dance Power Construct Zygarde-10% and Swords Dance Garchomp by sacrificing itself to remove their boosts. Recover also benefits from Prankster, allowing Toxapex to switch in, sponge a hit, and heal off the damage before taking a second one. Knock Off provides utility by removing items, which can be especially useful against Choice Band users and defensive Pokemon that rely on utility items. The last move slot is more flexible; Scald threatens physical attackers that might consider staying in with a burn, Toxic Spikes help wear down offensive teams, and Toxic weakens potential sweepers. Black Sludge is the preferred item to provide extra recovery, while Rocky Helmet is an option to punish physical attackers, especially if Toxapex is the main Barraskewda switch-in. Maximum HP and Defense investment is necessary to repeatedly switch into dangerous physical attackers, while zero Speed IVs allow Toxapex to outspeed opponents in Trick Room; this is especially important to remove Marowak-Alola's Thick Club with Knock Off.</p> <p>Toxapex is best utilized on balance and bulky offense teams that want to counter a wide range of opposing setup sweepers without devoting space to an elaborate defensive core. Toxapex is a great backstop when an attacker gets forced out; Prankster Haze removes the threat of the opponent using the free turn to set up, and Prankster Recover, plus Toxapex's great bulk, makes it difficult to KO. As such, Toxapex makes a great partner to Choice item wallbreakers such as Terrakion and Azelf. These wallbreakers also appreciate Toxapex's Knock Off and Toxic Spikes, as they wear down the opposing team even faster. Toxapex can also cover for other passive defensive partners like Blissey by denying sweepers that can set up on Blissey. Due to its Ground weakness, Toxapex is unable to check Garchomp, Landorus-T, or Zygarde-10%, so a secondary physically defensive switch-in like Intimidate Corviknight or Dauntless Shield Mew is appreciated. Toxapex is also a poor switch-in to Psychic- and Electric-type attacks, but these tend to be specially-oriented and should be handled by a special wall like Jirachi instead. Since Toxapex is heavily reliant on using Recover to stay healthy, it is vulnerable to entry hazards and opposing pivots. Reliable Defog support from Corviknight and the ability to punish pivots with entry hazard support&amp;mdashwhich includes its own Toxic Spikes&amp;mdash is strongly advised. Since Toxapex does not have access to a pivot move and can often be a momentum drain, it pairs well with other defensive pivots, such as Corvikinght and RegenVest Jirachi, which can generate momentum.</p>"

Volt Absorb Toxapex is particularly efficient, as it can also stop Belly Drum Kommo-o with Haze and its immunity to Thunder Punch.</p> <p><strong>Psychic Surge</strong>: Psychic Surge Pokemon such as Azelf can prevent Kommo-o from using Triage Drain Punch and can easily outspeed and KO it with Expanding Force.</p>",

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Kommo-o's great bulk, alongside its unique typing, allows it to check a wide variety of Pokemon in the AAA metagame. It can reliably switch into several prominent attackers like Zarude and Barraskewda, often punishing their attacks with Rocky Helmet, while also staying healthy with Regenerator. Dauntless Shield can be used instead to better soft check foes like Terrakion, but it makes Kommo-o very dependent on Leftovers or team support to stay healthy. Running no item is another option to nullify Poltergeist to check Dhelmise. Kommo-o also has good offensive presence with its powerful STAB Body Press, potentially boosted by Dauntless Shield, which can threaten many offensive and defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Zarude. It also threatens common Defoggers and Magic Bounce users like Corviknight and Blissey, allowing it to reliably set Stealth Rock. Dragon Tail phazes setup Pokemon that resist Body Press, and racks up Stealth Rock damage. Iron Defense can be used to effectively give it +2 Attack and Defense, notably allowing it to beat Corviknight one-on-one. Poison Jab is another option to threaten Fairy-types such as Tapu Fini and Tapu Koko, which are immune to Dragon Tail and take very little damage from Body Press, as well as fishing for poison on Pokemon that resist Body Press like Zapdos. Toxic is yet another option to reliably cripple Pokemon such as Tapu Fini.</p> <p>This set fits well in bulky offense and balance teams, which enjoy Kommo-o's longevity and ability to reliably set up Stealth Rock. Offensive Pokemon that are forced out by Zarude and Barraskewda such as Heatran and Sheer Force Tapu Lele greatly appreciate Kommo-o coming in on them and chipping them with Rocky Helmet. Defensively, Kommo-o and Tapu Fini cover each other's weaknesses and can check most physical attackers together. Despite its decent special bulk, Kommo-o can't usually take hits from special threats, so partners like Blissey and RegenVest Silvally-Dragon are often required. Kommo-o is particularly weak to Flying- and Fairy-types as they don't fear Body Press; thus, good answers to threats like Zapdos, Tapu Koko, and Tapu Lele are needed, for example Heatran and RegenVest Jirachi. Lastly, Kommo-o is completely unable to threaten Talonflame, so answers to it such as Zapdos are also good teammates.</p>"
      },
      "Belly Drum + Triage": {
        "description": "<p>Belly Drum, paired with Triage, turns Kommo-o into a deadly sweeper. After Belly Drum, Kommo-o's maxed-out Attack and priority Drain Punch make it incredibly difficult to stop with few reliable checks other than Prankster Toxapex, Unaware, and Psychic Surge. Kommo-o's fantastic natural bulk lets it set up on passive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and defensive Landorus-T, along with Choice-item wallbreakers locked into a resisted move such as Zarude and Barraskewda. Drain Punch is the primary move, boasting +3 priority and making Kommo-o difficult to revenge kill thanks to its recovery. Thunder Punch hits Corviknight and Tapu Fini for super effective damage, who would otherwise tank Drain Punch. Substitute eases prediction and provides setup opportunities, while Dragon Claw gives Kommo-o a strong neutral attack on Pokemon such as Zapdos. X-Scissor allows Kommo-o to OHKO Dauntless Shield Mew at +6 with Life Orb. Sitrus Berry and 64 HP EVs allow Kommo-o to set up on Corviknight, while an Adamant nature gives it as much Attack investment as possible. Life Orb is a more aggressive option, allowing Kommo-o to OHKO Tapu Koko with Drain Punch.</p> <p>Belly Drum Kommo-o fits best on hyper offensive teams, but it can also effectively act as a lure on bulkier teams. Pairing Kommo-o with other physical threats such as Garchomp and Talonflame forms a nice physical spam core, letting each more easily overwhelm common defensive checks such as Zapdos and Tapu Fini. Tapu Koko and Regieleki provide dual screens support on hyper offensive, giving Kommo-o more opportunities to set up. On bulkier teams, slow pivots such as Swampert and Corviknight can bring in Kommo-o safely with their pivoting moves. Kommo-o is very weak to Triage Draining Kiss, so Assault Vest Jirachi is a valued partner; Jirachi also checks Psychic Surge Azelf. Finally, Zapdos and Tapu Koko can threaten Unaware Mandibuzz and Prankster Toxapex with their STAB Electric moves.</p>"

      "Galvanize": {
        "description": "<p>This set exploits Kommo-o's good offensive stats and Boomburst to make it a powerful and reliable mixed Stealth Rock setter that can threaten almost all the Defoggers in the metagame. Thanks to Galvanize, Boomburst is even stronger and threatens the metagame's most common Defoggers, Tapu Fini and Corviknight. Close Combat hits common Magic Bounce users such as Blissey and contributes to its strong offensive presence, threatening Ferrothorn and Heatran. The last moveslot is relatively flexible; Dragon Dance boosts Close Combat and turns Kommo-o into a dangerous sweeper, Clanging Scales hits opposing Kommo-o harder while threatening Ground-type such as Swampert, and Taunt shuts down recovery from Pokemon like Volt Absorb Corviknight, as well as blocking setup and entry hazards. Life Orb is usually preferred, but Magnet lets it do high damage to Tapu Fini and Corviknight without recoil. The given Speed EVs allow Kommo-o to outspeed Pokemon with 70 or less base Speed such as Bisharp, and a Rash nature alongside to the 28 EVs Attack EVs secure the 2HKO against RegenVest Swampert, while keeping its ability to take physical hits relatively well.</p> <p>Pivots such as Barraskewda appreciate entry hazards chipping their switch-ins. Despite being able to come in on Zarude one or two times, this Kommo-o set lacks longevity, and a secondary check to Zarude and Barraskewda is often required. Due to Kommo-o's weakness to common attackers such as Zapdos, Azelf, and Tapu Lele, strong answers to them like so RegenVest Jirachi and Blissey make great teammates; moreover, they can bring Kommo-o on the field to help it set up Stealth Rock.</p>"

  "Tapu Koko": {
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tapu Koko can run Grass Knot to 2HKO specially defensive Swampert, or OHKO physically defensive variants, though forgoing one of its STAB moves limits its power. It can run a physical Magic Guard set with Wild Charge, Brave Bird, U-turn, and Roost or Toxic; this set can beat special walls like Heatran, but is otherwise outclassed by the listed sets. Primordial Sea has a good niche in checking Fire-types, mainly Talonflame, and a perfectly accurate Thunder, while still offering decent power and revenge killing ability; however, it is unable to check other key Fire-types like Cinderace and Entei and is largely outclassed by Zapdos, which offers better bulk, higher power, and amazing coverage. Levitate is a decent alternative on Calm Mind sets, as it beats Tapu Koko's biggest check in Landorus-T, and turns other Ground-types into setup fodder. Calm Mind Magic Guard Tapu Koko is also able to forgo electric coverage for Iron Defense, enabling it to continue to boost towards a win even versus the Ground-types that typically force it out, but it loses its ability to defeat Toxapex and also struggles to KO Steel-types without a significant number of Special Attack boosts. Refrigerate Hyper Voice is another niche to beat Ground-types that is able to swiftly eliminate the likes of Landorus-T and Garchomp, though Ice-type coverage sees limited use otherwise. Additionally, both sets forgo Magic Guard, making them more susceptible to being worn down.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Common Ground-types such as Swampert and Landorus-T can switch into any move other than Facade and force out Tapu Koko with a Ground-type move. Specially defensive Garchomp can tank a Dazzling Gleam and KO back.</p> <p><strong>Volt Absorb</strong>: Volt Absorb users like Corviknight and Toxapex can also switch into any attack, but have to watch out for Taunt denying their recovery. Corviknight is also turned into setup fodder by Calm Mind Tapu Koko variants.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Tapu Koko crumbles to any faster Pokemon, such as Azelf, Barraskewda, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, given its middling bulk. The latter can also switch into most of Tapu Koko's attacks with ease. Priority users, namely Zarude and Dhelmise, threaten to severely weaken Tapu Koko with Grassy Glide.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn resists Tapu Koko's dual STAB move combination and threatens to 2HKO or set up Spikes. RegenVest Jirachi can soak up any attack and bring in a revenge killer via U-turn; Heatran take little from any of Tapu Koko's attacks and threatens to trap it using Magma Storm; however, non-Regenerator Heatran has to be careful not to take too much chip as its only source of recovery is Leftovers.</p>",

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>With blazing speed, strong STAB move combination, access to Roost, and a useful set of resistances, Tapu Koko is one of the best offensive pivots in the tier. Its Speed tier allows it to revenge kill key threats such as Talonflame, Terrakion, and Latios. Dazzling Gleam is a good secondary STAB move that reliably hits Pokemon that resist Thunderbolt such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Zarude. Magic Guard and Roost give Tapu Koko decent longevity to offensively check threats like Talonflame and Zapdos throughout a game. Life Orb also pairs well with Magic Guard and gives Tapu Koko a free boost to make up for its mediocre attacking stats. U-turn allows it to pivot out of bad matchups such as the aforementioned Ground-types, as well as Heatran and Blissey.</p> <p>Tapu Koko easily fits on bulky offense and balance teams in need of a revenge killer or a pivot. Wallbreakers like Terrakion and Dhelmise are great offensive partners: the former capitalizes on the special walls Tapu Koko forces in, such as Heatran, and is extremely difficult to switch into; the latter covers Tapu Koko's weakness against Ground-types and turns them into setup fodder while also providing Grassy Terrain support. In return, Tapu Koko threatens their checks like Tapu Fini and Corviknight. Heatran also deserves special mention, as it is one of the best Stealth Rock setters in the tier and is able to chip down special walls like Landorus-T and Blissey. Furthermore, it lures in and poisons Zapdos, which lets Tapu Koko beat non-Weather Ball variants more reliably. Tapu Koko struggles with Ground-types in general, especially Choice Scarf Landorus-T, so it is necessary to pair it with Flying-types like your own Landorus-T and Corviknight. Wandering Spirit variants are especially helpful, as they can remove Regenerator from Swampert's and Landorus-T, eventually chipping them into KO range of Dazzling Gleam. Both Landorus-T and Corviknight also form potent VoltTurn cores with Tapu Koko and can switch into faster threats like Choice Scarf Azelf and Zarude.</p>"
      },
      "Pixilate": {
        "description": "<p>With very few physically defensive walls that resist Fairy-type in the tier, and many of the relevant ones being weak to Electric, Pixilate Facade Tapu Koko excels in putting tremendous pressure onto defensive builds. Facade, when boosted by Flame Orb and Pixilate, is very strong and can 2HKO many neutral foes like Landorus-T, Zapdos, and Swampert. Volt Switch allows Tapu Koko to pivot out of unfavorable matchups like Heatran while hitting Corviknight and Toxapex super effectively; Thunderbolt allows it to actually beat the aforementioned Corviknight and Toxapex, as they can otherwise use a recovery move as Tapu Koko uses Volt Switch. Roost is mandatory to offset burn and entry hazard damage. Taunt prevents its switch-ins like Volt Absorb Corviknight from healing and pairs very well with Volt Switch to weaken foes. Work Up is usable to boost both of Tapu Koko's attacking stats, allowing it to function as a cleaner, though Facade is already strong enough to pick off weakened foes, and boosted Thunderbolt is still weak. A Jolly nature is preferred to preserve bulk; Hasty nature is also an option on Work Up variants, notably being able to 2HKO Toxapex.</p> <p>Tapu Koko fits on most balance and offense teams thanks to its top-notch Speed tier and its ability to keep opposing walls at low health. As such, it pairs well with entry hazards setters like Swampert and Heatran to chip down foes. Tapu Koko pairs well with strong attackers in general, as it is able to either wallbreak early-game or clean up late-game. Zygarde-10% is a prime partner to form a core with Tapu Koko where they both can either wallbreak or clean up; Tapu Koko can Taunt shared checks like Dauntless Shield Mew and keep them at low health, while using Volt Switch against checks like Heatran and Jirachi to bring in Zygarde-10%. Tapu Koko is frail, especially considering burn damage, so it appreciates a defensive pivot to safely bring it in. Vaporeon is remarkably a good partner as it can use Wish + Flip Turn to reliably heal Tapu Koko. A Flying-type like Landorus-T or Zapdos is also essential to alleviate Tapu Koko's glaring weakness to Ground-types; they are also helpful in checking Heatran, which is the single largest roadblock to Tapu Koko given its 4x Fairy resistance.</p>"

      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>Tapu Koko is one of the best screens setters in the tier thanks to a great Speed tier and access to Taunt, which is able to prevent Defoggers like Corviknight from removing its screens and setup sweepers like Genesect and Volcarona from boosting. Taunt also prevents opposing leads like Heatran from setting up entry hazards, which is very useful for hyper offense teams that Tapu Koko finds home in. U-turn brings in teammates while preserving Tapu Koko to set up screens later in the game. Light Clay allows dual screens to last for an extra 3 turns, giving additional protection for its teammates. Aroma Veil protects Tapu Koko from opposing Taunt and Encore, while Prankster lets it use priority Taunt and dual screens. Maximum HP and Speed investment allow Tapu Koko to be as bulky as possible while outspeeding every Pokemon up to Talonflame to set up screens before the opponent attacks. 248 Speed EVs is also an option to move after opposing Tapu Koko, allowing it to bring in teammates safely.</p> <p>Tapu Koko is a great asset on hyper offensive teams, as dangerous sweepers like Tapu Lele, Genesect, and Togekiss can take full advantage of dual screens to set up Belly Drum, Shift Gear, and Nasty Plot, respectively, and become much harder to revenge kill. However, Tapu Koko might not be able to get both screens up against common Ground-type leads like Swampert, so switch-ins like Dhelmise are necessary to prevent the opponent from freely using Earthquake. Dhelmise also provides useful priority and good wallbreaking potential. Teammates that can pressure Corviknight and Tapu Fini, like Cinderace, are essential to prevent the opponent from bringing in their Defogger once Tapu Koko is switched out.</p>"

Thunderbolt and Dazzling Gleam are the main STAB moves of choice, hitting common metagame staples like Corviknight and Garchomp for super effective damage. Life Orb in conjunction with Magic Guard provides Tapu Koko with a free power boost as well as an immunity to passive damage, but Leftovers can be used to minimize the amount of times it needs to use Roost. The EV spread allows Tapu Koko to survive a Choice Band Grassy Glide from Grassy Surge Zarude and OHKO back with a boosted Dazzling Gleam while still Speed tying opposing Tapu Koko.</p> <p>Tapu Koko fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that can offer support as it tries to set up a sweep in the late-game. Teammates like Zarude and Heatran offer pivoting momentum and entry hazard support, while they appreciate Tapu Koko's ability to offensively check threats like Talonflame and Galarian Zapdos. Talonflame and Galarian Zapdos also benefit from being paired with Tapu Koko, as they capitalize on Ferrothorn and RegenVest Jirachi trying to switch into Tapu Koko. Tapu Koko struggles to break RegenVest Swampert and Landorus-T, so it does well with partners that can repeatedly switch into them like Regenerator Ferrothorn and Wandering Spirit Corviknight. Water-types like Suicune, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini prevent Barraskewda from revenge killing Tapu Koko, and Suicune, in particular, is also able to form a Calm Mind core with Tapu Koko that continuously pressures opposing teams.</p>"

Hydro Pump can be run on Choice Scarf sets to pose a larger threat offensively and notably OHKOes Talonflame, but gives up burn chance, accuracy, and PP. Triage is an option that makes Tapu Fini a bulky setup wincon, but its 95 Special Attack makes it weak even when boosted.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Desolate Land Fire-types</strong>: Desolate Land users such as Moltres, Heatran, and Cinderace are not threatened by Tapu Fini's STAB moves. Offensive Heatran gets a special mention because it doesn't mind its item being removed by Tapu Fini in exchange for being able to trap and KO with Magma Storm. Cinderace either can pivot into a teammate or carry Gunk Shot to 2HKO Tapu Fini. Volcarona can use Quiver Dance repeatedly in the face of Tapu Fini, and offensive variants can 2HKO even with unboosted Solar Beam or Giga Drain. However, Knock Off or Trick from Tapu Fini can greatly cripple these Pokemon by removing their items of choice.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Zarude, Dhelmise, and Tapu Bulu can all threaten to outspeed and OHKO Tapu Fini.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Tapu Koko and Zapdos both threaten Tapu Fini with their strong STAB attacks, though they cannot switch into its attacks very easily.</p> <p><strong>Trick users</strong>: Although they would rather not be burned by Scald, Mew, Jirachi, and opposing Tapu Fini can run a Choice Scarf + Trick set of their own and thus switch into Tapu Fini with relative ease.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Tapu Fini's access to utility moves such as Defog, Haze, and Knock Off allows it to excel as a defensive pivot to a wide array of attackers. The combination of Moonblast and Knock Off in particular enables Tapu Fini to cripple Heavy Duty Boots and Assault Vest users while retaining a strong Fairy-type STAB move. Tapu Fini's typing and bulk allow it to serve as a blanket check to prominent physical attackers like Garchomp, Barraskewda, and Terrakion; the use of Rocky Helmet serves as a means for Tapu Fini to switch in and passively limit the amount of times they can attack successfully. Leftovers allows Tapu Fini to slightly increase its passive recovery so that it doesn't have to switch immediately versus opposing attackers. Tapu Fini also serves as one of the most effective counters to Barraskewda, as it can easily restore chip damage from Flip Turn with Regenerator while punishing Barrskewda with Rocky Helmet. Because common Stealth Rock users such as Swampert and Garchomp don't tend to carry moves that are immediately threatening to Tapu Fini, it's able to Defog Stealth Rock away consistently with the option of also removing potential Swords Dance boosts or threatening to burn with Scald. Tapu Fini also retains the ability to check setup sweepers in general: Quiver Dance Volcarona for example can be dealt with to an extent by resetting its stat changes with Haze, but Tapu Fini is not the most reliable long-term answer to them. Knock Off can also be used to potentially remove useful items like Leftovers and Rocky Helmet from Pokemon that rely on them, making Tapu Fini a very versatile utility user.</p> <p>Tapu Fini fits onto virtually any type of team; it can work on balance, offense, and even stall. Ground-types such as Swampert and Garchomp enjoy having Tapu Fini as a teammate because they cover for its weakness to Electric-type attacks and can make progress by going for Stealth Rock. Tapu Fini also largely benefits from teammates like Mandibuzz, Zapdos, and Moltres that can patch up its weakness to Grass-type attacks from common users such Volcarona, Tapu Bulu, and Zarude. It's also worth noting that despite being a Water-type, Tapu Fini struggles versus especially powerful Fire-type attacks from Pokemon like Choice Specs Volcanion and offensive Heatran, so Flash Fire and Primordial Sea users like Corviknight and Zapdos can alleviate the pressure for it.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf + Trick enhances Tapu Fini's defensive profile by making it an aggressively played revenge killer to offensive threats like Galarian Zapdos and Belly Drum Kommo-o, and it can also punish walls like Chansey, Ferrothorn, and Corviknight by severely limiting their utility. Having a Choice Scarf also allows Tapu Fini to play much more aggressively, as it can outspeed and threaten to KO foes like Galarian Zapdos and Terrakion. Moonblast and Scald are the preferred STAB options, dealing decent damage to or KOing everything Tapu Fini outspeeds, such as Barraskewda, Terrakion, and Talonflame; Scald also threatens to burn physical attackers that Tapu Fini outspeeds but cannot always beat one-on-one, such as Garchomp and Terrakion, and potentially punishes switch-ins like Blissey and Ferrothorn with extra chip damage from burn. Defog fills out the last slot by making sure Tapu Fini can still fulfill its role as one of best Defoggers in the tier. 8 Special Attack EVs are enough to OHKO Terrakion with Moonblast after it drops its defenses with Close Combat while 172 Speed EVs and Choice Scarf outpace Barraskewda; the rest of the EVs are dumped into HP and Defense to maximize bulk.</p> <p>Tapu Fini primarily excels on bulky offense and balance teams, most notably as a check to strong physical attackers like Terrakion, Galarian Zapdos, and Tough Claws Zarude. Fire-types like Volcarona, Heatran, and Moltres all appreciate its ability to switch into Fighting- and Water-type attacks for them; their Desolate Land variants can then pivot into the Water-type Pokemon, overriding Primordial Sea. Bulky teammates like Blissey and Swampert pair well with Tapu Fini since it can switch into opposing Trick users like Mew, Jirachi, and Tapu Fini for them; in return, they check Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zapdos. Other physically and specially defensive walls are important teammates: Dauntless Shield Mew, Intimidate Corviknight, RegenVest Jirachi, and Chansey are able to cover for Tapu Fini's lack of defensive investment. In particular, Intimidate Corviknight can switch into Grass-types like Zarude, Tapu Bulu, and Dhelmise for Tapu Fini. The versatility of Trick also means Tapu Fini can cripple common defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Ferrothorn, for teammates like Pixilate Tapu Koko and Primordial Sea Barraskewda. Any viable entry hazard setter, such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, or Garchomp, capitalizes on Tapu Fini forcing frail offensive threats to switch by weakening them with entry hazard damage. Secondary entry hazard control measures, such as Rapid Spin Dhelmise and Defog Mandibuzz, are useful to alleviate pressure off of Tapu Fini to remove entry hazards, especially in matchups where it would rather keep its Choice Scarf and does not want to be Choice-locked into Defog.</p>"

Thanks to its typing, it is able to check a unique array of threats, from Fairy-types like Tapu Koko to Fire-types like Talonflame and Chandelure. Furthermore, Nihilego can also pressure common Defoggers like Tapu Fini and Mandibuzz, making it a great Toxic Spikes setter. Stealth Rock is a good alternative, but it competes with other Pokemon like Garchomp as a setter. Sludge Bomb is a spammable STAB move that allows Nihilego to spread additional poison and hits Tapu Fini. Power Gem hits Flying-types like Mandibuzz and Corviknight, and Talonflame, as well as Cinderace. Knock Off pairs well with Toxic Spikes, threatening Pokemon that get around Toxic Spikes like Heavy-Duty Boots users, Magic Guard users, and Steel-types like Assault Vest Jirachi. Regenerator provides Nihilego with much-needed longevity, allowing it to repeatedly switch into foes and set entry hazards. The given EV spread and a Calm nature ensure that Chandelure never 2HKOes Nihilego with Shadow Ball, while the remaining EVs improve Nihilego's abysmal physical bulk, enabling it to check the likes of Pixilate Tapu Koko and Talonflame.</p> <p>Nihilego fits best on balance teams with wallbreakers that appreciate it setting entry hazards reliably and checking some of the most dangerous wallbreakers in the metagame. Poisoning Pokemon, especially Ground-types such as Swampert, Garchomp and Hippowdon, allows wallbreakers like Desolate Land Heatran, Inteleon, and Garchomp to overwhelm them. These Pokemon also provide immediate pressure, which Nihilego often struggles at delivering. It pairs equally well with defensive pivots like Corviknight and Blissey, as it can switch into powerful wallbreakers like Chandelure and Tapu Koko that they struggle with; in return, these Pokemon can check Ground- and Water-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Inteleon, which Nihilego struggles with. As Nihilego crumbles to any physical attack it does not resist, sturdy physical walls like Dauntless Shield Mew and Skarmory are necessary teammates. Both Pokemon can also set Spikes, forming a dangerous entry hazard-stacking core with Nihilego. An additional answer to Cinderace in particular is helpful, like Toxapex and Primordial Sea Zapdos, as it is able to 2HKO Nihilego and the aforementioned wall. Lastly, Nihilego and its offensive teammates appreciate pivots like Tapu Koko and Mew, as they can keep up momentum with Toxic Spikes on the field, maximizing chip damage and preventing the opponent from removing it.</p>"

Heat Crash punches holes in Steel-type foes that can handle Gyro Ball such as non-Flash Fire Ferrothorn and Intimidate Corviknight. Earthquake allows Stakataka to 2HKO Toxapex, which otherwise can stall out Gyro Ball PP and precious Trick Room turns with Prankster Recover. Superpower rounds out its coverage by hitting Flash Fire Ferrothorn hard. Stone Edge, on the other hand, gives it a secondary STAB option that provides good neutral coverage on Steelworker variants; however, the coverage from Superpower is usually preferred. Steelworker maximizes Gyro Ball damage against neutral targets such as Hippowdon, while Tinted Lens helps Stakataka net important 2HKOs on foes such as offensive Heatran and specially defensive Swampert. Minimum Speed makes Gyro Ball hit as hard as possible while also making Stakataka as fast as possible in Trick Room.</p> <p>Stakataka requires Trick Room to function, so multiple Trick Room partners are strongly recommended. Slowbro makes for a great partner as it has Trick Room and Teleport. In addition, it also resists common Water- and Fighting-type moves that threaten Stakataka outside of Trick Room. Similarly, Cresselia not only provides Trick Room, but also Lunar Dance to restore Stakataka's health and Gyro Ball's PP, which is helpful against priority attacks and bulkier teams. Conkeldurr and Stakataka have many shared checks, allowing one of them to break down the checks for the other to sweep. Vikavolt can break physically defensive Pokemon that wall Stakataka like Swampert, Palossand, and Slowbro and also pivot with Volt Switch. Alolan Marowak is another Trick Room wallbreaker that can break the aforementioned walls, which gives it good synergy with Stakataka.</p>"

      "Intimidate Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Intimidate Corviknight is one of the most consistent checks to physical attackers in AAA. With its already high natural bulk, fantastic defensive typing, and access to reliable recovery and Intimidate, it is difficult to break through physically without strong super effective hits. Choice Band Terrakion, Zarude, and Garchomp are all dangerous physical attackers that have a difficult time breaking through Corviknight. Additionally, thanks to Intimidate, Corviknight can soft check threats even when weakened by handing off a now-minus-one attacker to a teammate to check more easily. Corviknight is a fantastic role compressor, as it also offers entry hazard removal and slow pivoting with U-turn. It is very common for Corviknight to come in, eat a weak or resisted hit, and use U-turn as their opponent switches. Brave Bird is the obligatory STAB move and does decent damage to attackers like Zarude and Dhelmise, if required. It also prevents dangerous setup sweepers like Volcarona from setting up for free. Maximum Defense investment is required to ensure Corviknight avoids several key 2HKOs, most notably from Terrakion, and minimum Speed with no IVs allows Corviknight's U-turn to usually go last, bringing in a teammate for free.</p> <p>Corviknight fits well on a wide variety of teams due to its role compression and great defensive attributes, but it especially excels on balance and bulky offense teams that can take advantage of its slow U-turn. Dangerous but frail wallbreakers like Terrakion, Tapu Lele, and Barraskewda appreciate Corviknight getting them onto the field safely. While Corviknight can check a wide range of physical attackers, there are a few that it struggles with, such as Talonflame and Cinderace. Partners like Primordial Sea Zapdos and Swampert are appreciated as ways to handle these threats. Additionally, even though Corviknight is an excellent Defogger, it struggles heavily to Defog against Heatran, thus it greatly appreciates teammates that can reliably force it out like Primordial Sea Barraskewda and Zapdos. Tapu Koko and Zapdos are common switch-ins to Corviknight; therefore, partners like Blissey, which make a fantastic core with it that covers each others weaknesses, are good teammates. Lastly, a second physically defensive partner like Tapu Fini or Dauntless Shield Mew makes a great partner to handle the few physical attackers Corviknight cannot, such as Cinderace and Talonflame.</p>"
      },
      "Wandering Spirit Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Wandering Spirit Corviknight aims to punish opposing Pokemon that rely on their ability, especially Regenerator pivots like Swampert. For example, if Swampert uses Flip Turn on Corviknight, instead of recovering a third of its HP, it loses 16.7%, a massive difference that cripples Swampert's longevity. This also gives Corviknight Regenerator, allowing it to save a turn by not having to heal with Roost. Wandering Spirit is also great at denying Triage users their priority; this makes Corviknight a great emergency check to several popular sweepers like Triage Tapu Lele. It is also effective against Magic Guard users, as it can unexpectedly force them to take Rocky Helmet chip and Life Orb recoil, and users of damage-amplification abilities like Tough Claws and Adaptability. This moveset aims to provide as much utility as possible while utilizing Wandering Spirit: Roost gives recovery, Defog removes entry hazards, U-turn provides slow pivoting, and Brave Bird lets Corviknight avoid total passivity. Be careful when attacking with Corviknight, however, as it may give your opponent their ability back if they have already activated Wandering Spirit. It is also worth noting that Wandering Spirit only works on contact moves, so moves like Stone Edge will not trigger it. Maximum Defense EVs ensure it can check as many things as possible, while minimum Speed IVs allow for a slow U-turn.</p> <p>Corviknight's biggest asset is frustrating and denying recovery to RegenVest pivots like Swampert, Jirachi, and Silvally-Dragon. Special Attackers such as Zapdos and Tapu Lele make fantastic partners, as they can often blow through opposing teams when their RegenVest checks are at low health. Because this set lacks Leftovers and Intimidate, it is much easier to overwhelm with powerful attacks, so it is important to either back it up with a strong defensive teammate like Dauntless Shield Mew, or play aggressively enough to deny opposing breakers the chance to get in. In particular Corviknight struggles with attackers that don't mind having their ability removed temporarily like Grassy Surge Zarude or Primordial Sea Barraskewda, or are powerful enough to beat it without an ability like Choice Band Terrakion. Strong answers to these Pokemon, like Dauntless Shield Mew, are highly recommended.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Corviknight, when coupled with an immunity ability, can check a wide range of dangerous special attackers in AAA, and, furthermore, use them as setup fodder. With Volt Absorb, Corviknight becomes a fantastic switch-in to Tapu Koko and Zapdos, while Flash Fire makes it a great check to Desolate Land Heatran and Volcarona while even checking physical attackers like Cinderace and Talonflame. With access to Bulk Up and Roost, Corviknight is able to function as a fantastic late-game bulky wincon by taking advantage of the free turns it gets. U-turn still provides utility early-game and lets it function as a pivot before its checks are removed. The choice of Brave Bird or Iron Head generally comes down to power or sustainability; both STAB moves have no immunities, and while Flying generally has better coverage in AAA, Iron Head's consistency due to its lack of recoil is appreciated. Maximum Special Defense investment allows Corviknight to check special attackers as well as possible; since this Corviknight can often sweep, it does not run minimum Speed, as it can sometimes get a Bulk Up off against slow wallbreakers like Dhelmise.</p> <p>Specially defensive Corviknight is a great option for teams looking to patch up weaknesses to Tapu Koko, Zapdos, or Desolate Land Heatran. It is often found on balanced and bulkier teams as a great defensive pivot and late-game sweeper. Depending on its ability, it either needs teammates to help it beat Tapu Koko and Zapdos, like Assault Vest Swampert, or beat Fire-types, like Tapu Fini. Additionally, even if it is Flash Fire, Corviknight cannot beat Mold Breaker Heatran, so it needs teammates like Zapdos to either beat it outright or wear it down and beat it over the course of the game. This set also does not check physical attackers well nor utilize Defog, so additional team support from the likes of Tapu Fini is required to fill these roles.</p>"

Barraskewda commonly finds itself on VoltTurn cores, synergizing well with Landorus-T and offensive Zapdos. Barraskewda also benefits from teammates that check Fire-types and cover its Desolate Land weakness like Terrakion and Garchomp, which can punish them by setting entry hazards. Since Barraskewda's main job as a pivot and revenge killer involves a lot of switching, it benefits from entry hazard removers and slow pivots. Defensive pivots such as Swampert and Landorus-T are able to preserve momentum and set up entry hazards, softening up foes. Other defensive Pokemon like Dauntless Shield Mew, Intimidate Corviknight, and Tapu Fini are also great partners because of their access to Defog and reliable recovery.</p>"

Stored Power is its strongest attack after Shell Smash, powering through neutral foes like Tapu Fini and defensive Garchomp. Shadow Ball is the STAB move of choice and complements Stored Power to hit common Psychic-types such as Mew, Tapu Lele, and RegenVest Jirachi.

Because Zarude is heavily threatened by U-turn, it risks getting forced out and pivoted on by faster threats such as Azelf, Talonflame, and Tapu Koko; reliable answers to these threats that do not need a turn to recover, like Regenerator Blissey and Heatran, are strongly recommended.

Swift grants a special move to hit physically defensive Ice-weak foes like Dauntless Shield Kommo-o and Hippowdon harder without KOing itself, but its low BP makes it undesirable in other situations.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Triage users like Kommo-o, Tapu Lele, Tapu Bulu, and Togekiss can outprioritize even Regieleki's Extreme Speed, allowing them to reliably pick it off due to its poor bulk. Pokemon like Barraskewda, Zarude, Entei, and Lucario can use their own priority attacks to pick off a weakened Regieleki while also stomaching its Extreme Speed when healthy. However, none of them can safely switch into Regieleki.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: With Life Orb damage sticking in, being an entry hazard remover that is vulnerable to them, and forced to hit Rocky Helmet users like Swampert and Kommo-o with its contact moves, Regieleki is prone to being worn down quite fast.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: RegenVest Jirachi and specially defensive Heatran can take on any of Regieleki's attacks easily. Even though they don't like taking an Explosion, Ferrothorn can punish its contact moves with Rocky Helmet while Volt Absorb Corviknight can use it as setup fodder.</p>",

      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>Regieleki's unmatched Speed tier alongside an adequate utility movepool makes it one of the metagame's best dedicated dual screens leads. The combination of Reflect, Light Screen, and Light Clay gives its teammates plenty of opportunities to set up. Rapid Spin helps counter opposing entry hazard leads like Azelf and Swampert and works well with Refrigerate to prevent Ghost-types like Dhelmise and Chandelure from spinblocking. Refrigerate-boosted Explosion also prevents the aforementioned Ghost-types from blocking Regieleki entirely, punishes unsuspecting Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T, and generates momentum to give free entry for its teammates. Volt switch is an alternative support option to pivot Regieleki's teammates safely into the field without KOing itself, potentially to set up dual screens again later. Prankster might seem redundant, but it usually guarantees both screens are set against priority users like Grassy Surge Zarude and Dhelmise. The Speed EVs let Regieleki outspeed Choice Scarf Azelf; if forgoing Explosion, maximum HP investment is also an option.</p> <p>Regieleki fits exclusively on hyper offense teams that appreciate it reliably setting up dual screens and removing entry hazards. Setup sweepers like Kommo-o, Galarian Moltres, Volcarona, Polteageist, and Dhelmise love Regieleki's dual screens to set up easier. Rapid Spin also significantly helps Polteageist, Volcarona, and Galarian Moltres, preserving the former's Focus Sash and alleviating the latter two's Stealth Rock weakness to opt for more offensive items or abilities such as Sheer Force + Life Orb and Weakness Policy, respectively. Dhelmise's Grassy Surge also grants Regieleki with much-appreciated recovery, as well as weakening Earthquake from foes like Swampert and Garchomp, providing it with longevity to set up dual screens again.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>Regieleki's blazing Speed tier and coveted BoltBeam coverage thanks to Refrigerate allow it to be a solid pivot, revenge killer, and entry hazard remover all in one. Volt Switch threatens non-Volt Absorb Corviknight, Tapu Fini, and Toxapex, lets it pivot out of checks such as Ferrothorn and specially defensive Heatran, and works exceptionally well with its Refrigerate-boosted attacks that dissuade Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T from trying to block it. Refrigerate-boosted Extreme Speed revenge kills boosted threats like Garchomp, Galarian Moltres, and Salamence, outprioritizes Dhelmise and Zarude's Grassy Glide and Zygarde-10%'s Extreme Speed, and highly damages specially defensive Pokemon like Blissey. Explosion can surprise and cripple foes like Ferrothorn, Swampert, and Volt Absorb Corviknight and allow a teammate to come in freely afterwards. Rapid Spin supports its teammates with entry hazard removal, especially with Refrigerate to prevent spinblocking attempts from the likes of Dhelmise and Doublade. Never-Melt Ice can be used instead of Life Orb to boost Regieleki's Ice coverage without taking recoil. The Speed EVs let Regieleki outspeed +1 base 100 Speed Pokemon like Mew, Volcarona, and Jirachi.</p> <p>Refrigerate Regieleki fits in hyper and bulky offense teams by providing them with valuable offensive utility. It provides insurance for the team by reliably outspeeding and threatening fast threats like Barraskewda, Azelf, and Cinderace that would otherwise overwhelm its teammates prior to boosting. Teammates weak to entry hazards like Focus Sash Polteageist, Choice Band Cinderace, and Aerilate Salamence appreciate Regieleki's Rapid Spin support. Cinderace, in particular, can help pressure Regieleki's Steel-type checks in Heatran, Ferrothorn, and RegenVest Jirachi as well as forgo Court Change in favor of another attacking move. Due to Regieleki's inability to threaten Swampert outside of KOing itself with Explosion, teammates like Zarude and Dhelmise are necessary to pressure it. Without having to rely on Defog, hazard-stacking leads like Skarmory and Mew can freely set up Stealth Rock and Spikes, with Regieleki also threatening common Defoggers like Corviknight, Mandibuzz, and Tapu Fini. Barraskewda forms a fast and potent VoltTurn core with Regieleki by bringing it in safely on its bulky Water-type switch-ins like Slowbro and Tapu Fini. Wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos and Terrakion also appreciate Regieleki's Volt Switch to bring them in on foes like Heatran and Blissey.</p>"
